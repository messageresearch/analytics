[14:51] I sought the
[14:55] Lord and he answered
[14:59] me and delivered
[15:03] me from every
[15:07] fear. Those who look on

[19:33] Let's sing that together. Let's shall we
[19:35] stand and sing that to him as brother
[19:36] Israel would
[19:38] come.
[19:40] Yes. Sing the first verse on that. Lord,
[19:44] my heart can
[19:48] grow so far
[19:51] away and
[19:55] cold. And yet for me, your love is
[20:01] still the same.
[20:09] Lord, I bend my
[20:14] knee in awe and fear of
[20:20] thee. My head bowed
[20:23] down in reence to your name.
[20:33] I
[20:35] lift your
[20:38] name. Your
[20:42] holy
[20:45] name.
[20:48] Jehovah
[20:50] God.
[20:52] Follow
[20:56] him
[20:58] the
[20:59] great
[21:01] I
[21:03] am the
[21:07] risen
[21:09] lamb my
[21:15] comforter
[21:17] and oh
[21:19] hallelujah hallelujah
[21:23] Oh Lord, my heart's
[21:28] desire is to be filled with spirit.
[21:32] Isn't that your desire tonight? Oh, my
[21:36] purpose is to worship
[21:41] you alone.
[21:48] Oh, open up my

[22:36] How great.
[22:39] I

[22:45] ris
[22:47] lamb. My
[22:53] comforter
[22:54] and
[22:57] king. Oh Lord, I
[23:01] lift
[23:03] your name.

[23:15] Jehovah
[23:17] God.
[23:23] Elohim,
[23:24] the great.
[23:27] I
[23:30] am the reason I
[23:36] lamb my
[23:39] comfort. Let's harmonize
[23:42] together. Oh, sing it unto him.
[23:47] Oh Lord, I
[23:50] lift
[23:52] your name.
[23:55] your
[23:58] holy name.
[24:01] [Music]
[24:04] Hova
[24:08] God
[24:12] him
[24:13] the
[24:15] great
[24:17] I
[24:19] am the
[24:23] risen
[24:25] lamb my comforter
[24:31] Churcher and
[24:35] King. Oh Lord, I
[24:39] live
[24:44] your
[24:53] heart.
[24:55] God know him.
[25:02] The
[25:03] great I
[25:07] am the
[25:10] risen
[25:13] lamb my
[25:17] [Music]
[25:22] comfort.
[25:24] Amen. God bless you saints. So good to
[25:27] be in the house of the Lord with you
[25:29] tonight. God bless you richly. We like
[25:32] to go right into the word. Um, brother
[25:34] Bham is going to be finishing up the
[25:36] message influence that we started last
[25:39] week Wednesday and his scripture reading
[25:42] is in Isaiah chapter 6. If you'd like to
[25:44] turn there to go read from the
[25:48] word. Amen. We greet the Robson tonight
[25:51] and each of you. God bless you. Amen.
[25:58] Isaiah chapter 6 in a great vision
[26:11] here in verse number
[26:13] [Music]
[26:15] one. In the year that King Uzziah died,
[26:18] I saw also the Lord sitting up on a
[26:20] throne high and lifted up and his train
[26:23] filled the temple. Above it stood the
[26:25] saraphims. Each one had six wings. With
[26:29] twain he covered his face. With twain he
[26:31] covered his feet. With twain he did fly.
[26:36] And one cried unto another, saying,
[26:38] "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.
[26:42] The whole earth is full of his glory."
[26:45] And the post of the door moved at the
[26:47] voice of him that cried, and the house
[26:50] was filled with smoke. Then said I, "Woe
[26:53] is me, for I am undone, because I am a
[26:57] man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the
[26:59] midst of a people of unclean lips. For
[27:02] my eyes eyes have seen the King, the
[27:05] Lord of Hosts." Then flew one of the
[27:08] seraraphims unto me, having a live coal
[27:11] in his hand, which he had taken with the
[27:13] tongues from off the altar. He laid it
[27:17] upon my mouth and said, "Lo, this hath
[27:20] touched thy lips, and thy iniquity is
[27:22] taken away, and thy sin purged." Also, I
[27:27] heard the voice of the Lord, saying,
[27:29] "Whom shall I send and whom will go for
[27:32] us?" Then said I, "Here am I. Send me."
[27:38] Amen. Is that your answer to the Lord
[27:42] today? Lord, send me. Amen. So let's
[27:46] sing that old hymn. Only
[27:48] believe.
[27:50] Only
[27:54] believe.
[27:56] Only
[27:59] believe that all things are
[28:06] possible.
[28:08] Only believe.
[28:11] [Music]
[28:13] Only
[28:17] believe,
[28:23] only that all things are
[28:29] possible,
[28:32] only willing. God bless you. You may be
[28:35] seated, brother Brandham.
[28:43] the Lord. Right now, you've got
[28:47] something, but be careful with it.
[28:50] You'll ruin your influence if that thing
[28:52] doesn't come to pass.
[28:56] You know what I mean? Or you say, "I I
[28:59] don't care where you belong, brother,
[29:01] sister. It's got to happen exactly the
[29:04] way you said it.
[29:06] If it isn't, you've only made yourself a
[29:10] laughingtock. You've only brought
[29:12] disgrace upon yourself, ruined your
[29:14] influence, and ruined the testimony of
[29:17] Jesus Christ that you're bearing.
[29:23] Be
[29:24] careful. Now, your doctrine on them
[29:26] things are all
[29:29] right, but it goes by promise and under
[29:32] conditions. So be careful about your
[29:35] influence. You're God. Sometimes we find
[29:40] that someone spoke in tonesues, the
[29:41] other wants to imitate him. You speak in
[29:44] tonesues too. One sees one given
[29:46] interpretation and say, "I got it too."
[29:48] And you go by impressions and then say,
[29:50] "Thus sayith the Lord." Well, that's
[29:53] wrong. And God will never move you any
[29:55] further than what you are right now.
[29:56] Just an organization until you get out
[29:58] of that.
[30:01] Now, you might not like me now, but at
[30:04] the day of the judgment, you love me.
[30:10] Be sure. Don't you say it unless God
[30:14] says so and you know that it is the
[30:16] truth that God said so. Not your
[30:18] opinion, but not some impression because
[30:21] you can be impressed. Anyway, those
[30:23] prophets down there when Jehoshaphat and
[30:26] and Ahab were sitting in the gates, them
[30:28] men were sincere and they were inspired.
[30:30] But you see their inspiration didn't
[30:32] cope with the promise of the Bible
[30:34] because the prophet Isaiah beg pardon uh
[30:37] the prophet um had prophesied before
[30:40] them Elisha Elijah and cursed Ahab and
[30:43] Jezebel and said what would happen to
[30:45] him. So how could this blessing be on
[30:47] what God had cursed?
[30:50] And how can the blessing be upon people
[30:52] that's doing and acting the way God said
[30:55] not to do?
[30:59] Though we dance in the spirit, though we
[31:01] speak with tongues like men and angels
[31:04] and have not charity, it becomes as a
[31:06] sounding brass, a tickling sin. Now
[31:09] you've got truth, but you've got to come
[31:10] to a different just a a bigity. You know
[31:14] what I mean? Just something to be
[31:16] hollering about. And I believe in
[31:18] hollering about it. He's got something
[31:20] to holler about. But be sure you
[31:21] approach that with the very depths of
[31:24] sincerity. That's right. If you live a
[31:27] different life than what you should
[31:28] live, keep still until you get that life
[31:30] gets the living in you. Then
[31:31] automatically,
[31:33] do you know the sheep isn't asked to
[31:36] manufacture
[31:38] wool? No, he can't manufacture it. These
[31:42] gifts cannot be manufactured by
[31:45] emotion. This church cannot be
[31:47] manufactured by
[31:49] organization. A sheep bears wool because
[31:51] he is a sheep.
[31:55] He can't help bearing wool for his whole
[31:58] system's made up to bear wool.
[32:03] We must be what we are inside, not
[32:06] something outside. How can we know
[32:08] what's right and then speak something
[32:10] contrary? Did not Jesus say, "You
[32:11] hypocrites? How can you say good things
[32:14] when the abundance of the heart speak of
[32:16] the
[32:17] mouth?" We must be sure that when we
[32:20] speak these things that they're correct.
[32:22] now to hurry up and I must hurry because
[32:25] I guess I'm too late now. Will you bear
[32:28] with me just a minute longer? Sure.
[32:31] Yes. Isaiah learned right here. No
[32:33] matter how great the organization was,
[32:35] how great the man was, oh God, to give
[32:37] him thousands and millions of dollars of
[32:39] this uh age that we're living in, that
[32:41] meant not one thing before God. His word
[32:44] was it. His word is his ultimate.
[32:47] That settles it. You must keep his word.
[32:51] humble yourself with it. Notice then we
[32:54] find out that he done something contrary
[32:56] to the word and he was cursed by it. No
[33:00] matter how great he was, how great David
[33:02] was, a man after God's own heart, yet
[33:04] got away from the word, thou shalt not
[33:06] commit
[33:08] adultery. But David is lifted up. He
[33:10] thought, well, God don't pay no
[33:11] attention to this. God pays attention to
[33:13] every thought that you think of.
[33:16] Let your thoughts be exactly right. What
[33:19] was the matter?
[33:21] Now is because that he forgot it. He for
[33:25] he went away from it. Never forgot it
[33:27] because he was told better.
[33:30] Now God puts his man in a place and he
[33:33] will not accept another. There's no one
[33:35] can take the other man's place. A
[33:37] brother Green here a few moments ago.
[33:40] That music I long times I heard brother
[33:42] Green and it was really it thrilled my
[33:45] heart. A good man. But I was reading the
[33:48] days of Mrs.
[33:50] McFersonson. When I seen uh some of the
[33:54] things that went on, Mrs. McFersonson
[33:56] was a was a influential woman. But I
[34:00] noticed that every lady minister had to
[34:03] carry a Bible this way, Mrs.
[34:05] Mc. Oh my. And we we find the same thing
[34:10] as 10,000 Billy Grahams today. Do you
[34:13] ever notice them try to talk just like
[34:15] him?
[34:17] You be what you are.
[34:22] Stay what you are. You can't be Billy
[34:24] Graham and Billy Graham can't be you.
[34:26] Your place is just as important as Billy
[34:28] Graham. If you're working for the
[34:30] popularity of the world you might try to
[34:32] impersonate, you'll get nowhere in the
[34:33] kingdom of God. I'd rather be a doorman
[34:35] at the house of God.
[34:38] Stay with what you are, what God made
[34:40] you. Oh, how we can stay. The reason
[34:42] they do that is because they're not
[34:44] conscious that God's watching. See, you
[34:46] lose the very thought of of God being
[34:49] there listening at you. God's putting
[34:52] down everything you're thinking about.
[34:53] And he knows it in his recording book.
[34:56] Your thoughts are louder than heaven and
[34:58] your voice is on the earth. Think the
[35:01] right thing. As I said to little Joseph,
[35:03] I said, um, a little boy is born in this
[35:06] world. He stands right in the middle of
[35:07] a road and he's pointed to Calvary, to
[35:10] Christ. There's a tree on either side of
[35:12] the road, one on the left side, which
[35:14] I'll call the wrong. If he just starts
[35:16] smacking little boys in the face because
[35:18] they smack him. And if they start doing
[35:19] these things, it pulls that little boy
[35:21] with the influence and it makes him
[35:23] crooked. But if he takes his other side
[35:25] of the road, which is the Holy Spirit,
[35:26] it points him straight to Calvary and
[35:28] keeps him that way. It makes you grow
[35:30] straight. Your thoughts, it's just as
[35:32] easy to think good thoughts as it is to
[35:34] think bad. Just as easy to think good of
[35:36] those who speak evil of you as it is
[35:38] vice versa. And a lot better than make
[35:40] you grow
[35:41] straight. Stay straight with God. Now to
[35:44] hurry up. The vision at the temple, he
[35:47] saw God upon his throne lifted up. Oh
[35:52] no. The heavenly serapens uh which means
[35:55] burners uh special designed person. When
[35:59] this uh Isaiah went down to the temple,
[36:02] he had been leading up on the shoulder
[36:03] of of uh as K. And wherever the king
[36:08] went, he but he found out that when the
[36:11] king, no matter how influenced he had
[36:14] been, influential been to him and the
[36:16] things that he had done that was great.
[36:18] He found out that when he tried to take
[36:20] another's place, he failed.
[36:25] We have so much today of carnal
[36:28] impersonation. What does it do? Let me
[36:31] take
[36:35] ahead. Uh, notice today God sends
[36:40] something on the earth and when we do,
[36:43] what happens? Everybody has to be the
[36:46] same. Not long ago, they brought a
[36:48] little Pentecostal boy up by the name of
[36:50] little David Walker. And that little boy
[36:52] was a preacher. I've heard a little boy
[36:54] saying, "Uh, little baby Jesus born into
[36:56] me. Mama, what was that next?" See, but
[36:59] not that little boy. I went to hear him.
[37:01] He threw off his coat and tucked a text
[37:02] and handled like a
[37:04] virgin. But I believe he belonged to the
[37:07] oneness group. Well, now the Trinity
[37:09] group ain't going to stand stand up for
[37:11] that. I'll tell you that. So, they got
[37:12] them a little David. And when the little
[37:14] boy got down in Florida, he called me
[37:17] come down there and help him. And I took
[37:19] the front page of the paper and they had
[37:21] to put an extra section in it for the
[37:22] little Davids. Little boy, little girls,
[37:25] little B, three-year-old, 2-year-old,
[37:27] everybody trying to hold their little
[37:28] group together. It seems to me like it
[37:30] become a Pentecostal meal
[37:33] ticket. If all them brothers would have
[37:36] got around that little boy and kept him
[37:38] prayed over him and things, he wouldn't
[37:40] get exalted up and sent him into all the
[37:43] groups and make him keep his his
[37:45] doctrine to himself, but just go ahead
[37:46] and preach it for all, you know, one
[37:49] tens of thousands of little children.
[37:51] But they got little impersonations up in
[37:53] the outside world coming in here. They
[37:55] heard of a little David and here's one
[37:56] greater than little David. So they come
[37:57] around and look at it and say, well,
[37:59] they go over there and see a total flop.
[38:00] So then they go back and say, there you
[38:02] are. When they hear somebody speak in
[38:05] tongues and give an interpretation, say
[38:06] the Lord's going to do a certain thing
[38:08] and see it happen just like that. Then
[38:10] they go to another seat just a bunch of
[38:12] carnal impersonations come about. They
[38:14] go around say you're all mad.
[38:17] See, it's carnal comparisons. Don't do
[38:19] that. They that wait upon the Lord shall
[38:22] renew their strength. Let me humble my
[38:25] pride and just call on his name. Let me
[38:27] wait, Lord. If you never do no more for
[38:28] me and save me, that's what I want. If
[38:31] you have need for me, show me and that's
[38:33] what I'll know and then I'll go. But you
[38:35] tell me first. I'm your servant. Do that
[38:38] and your influence will be great.
[38:42] Notice God is all holy. This prophet had
[38:46] been leaning upon uh this uh king's
[38:48] arms. But when he found out that
[38:50] something taken place, no matter how
[38:52] much a man was blessed, yet when God he
[38:55] steps across that boundary line between
[38:57] error and truth, God calls his
[39:00] hand. Then Isaiah went down to the
[39:03] temple and he fell down on his knees. No
[39:06] doubt he had said, "Yes, honorable king,
[39:08] your holiness, sir," and so forth, but
[39:10] it was uh your majesty, sir, it would
[39:13] have been different now. He fell down on
[39:15] the temple on the altar and began to cry
[39:18] out. And as he cried, God came down in a
[39:22] vision and he saw angels going back and
[39:24] forth through the temple, wings over
[39:27] their feet and wings over their face,
[39:28] flying, crying, holy, holy, holy is the
[39:32] Lord God Almighty.
[39:35] And he said, "I saw God lifted up way up
[39:39] above any man here on earth, above a
[39:42] Solomon or a David or Hezekiah." God was
[39:45] lifted to a place that man cannot come.
[39:49] Praise God. Then he become influenced of
[39:51] another way. He saw God lifted up
[39:55] high and he's trained. And when he saw
[39:58] those mighty beings, the place was
[40:00] filled with smoke. and he looked at the
[40:03] pillars of the temple, the post begin to
[40:05] shake at their voice.
[40:07] He never saw that by
[40:10] Hezekiah. He saw that a mortal man can
[40:13] fall. No matter how much he's blessed,
[40:16] he can still fall. But he looked at one
[40:19] that can't fall, whose foundations is
[40:22] sure. Even the pillars of the temple
[40:24] moved at their
[40:25] voices. Think of it. Two wings that
[40:29] covered their faces. They even
[40:32] angels cover their holy faces.
[40:37] Those servants, they're next to
[40:38] cherabans. They are same as cherabans.
[40:40] They're the burners of the sacrifice.
[40:42] And that's making the the children the
[40:44] worshippers way in assuring them the
[40:46] way. And these sabs who stay in the
[40:49] presence of God have to cover their
[40:51] faces.
[40:54] Then we just take the name of God and
[40:56] use it anyway.
[40:58] Prophesy in it one means nothing but
[41:00] some kind of carnal influence and so
[41:02] forth and say things that never
[41:03] happened. Act like it never paid any
[41:05] attention. If you say something and
[41:06] honestly and it didn't happen, repent
[41:08] and tell it that you were wrong.
[41:11] Then your influence will come back. The
[41:13] man's
[41:15] honest. These angels, saraphans never
[41:19] know sin or nothing about sin. They just
[41:22] burn the sacrifice to make a way of the
[41:25] worshipper, the saints, and they have to
[41:27] have their faces covered. What would
[41:29] that be upside of
[41:31] Hezekiah? Cover their holy faces in the
[41:34] presence of God with
[41:35] reverence. Now, there's no reverence.
[41:39] There seems to be that we can just do
[41:40] anything in the name of the Lord and get
[41:42] by with it. Just so long as we belong to
[41:44] some certain group that got a good
[41:46] social standing and they don't take our
[41:47] papers away from us, the presbyvers and
[41:49] the bishops and so forth don't call our
[41:51] papers and we still have a good
[41:52] influence amongst the people. Well, what
[41:54] kind of an influence do we have in the
[41:56] presence of God? Does our prayers
[41:58] return? Are they answered? If you abide
[42:02] in me in my word and you ask what you
[42:04] will and it shall be done. He that
[42:06] believeth in me, the works that I do
[42:08] shall he do also, even more than this
[42:10] shall he do, for I go to the father.
[42:12] Where are we Pentecostal people find
[42:15] oursel on the road map this morning
[42:18] let's not get
[42:20] bypassed there's one road to heaven and
[42:23] that's the road of holiness
[42:26] the righteous walk in it the unbeliever
[42:29] laughs at it depends on what you are now
[42:34] the people don't have reverence and
[42:36] those who try to live right some of them
[42:38] it ought to be respecting that stand
[42:40] that the man is tuck or the woman is
[42:42] tucked laugh at
[42:47] him. A man the other day calls a woman
[42:49] had her hair pulled back and made a bun
[42:51] on the back, took Isaiah 5 and said,
[42:54] "Cut that hair off said because it said
[42:58] they're round
[43:00] tires." Any man that knows more about
[43:03] the word of God than that, when the word
[43:04] of God said it's a disgrace, a shame, a
[43:06] dishonorable thing for a woman to cut
[43:08] her hair.
[43:12] said deflate your spiritar if you're
[43:15] going to come to this church and women
[43:16] laughing at
[43:17] every there you are no reverence don't
[43:20] know the word don't respect it when it
[43:23] is told
[43:26] them
[43:28] ministers see the word of God and refuse
[43:30] to walk in it reminds me coming down I
[43:32] had a one of these cameras and it's it's
[43:35] kind of a new thing to me Billy works at
[43:37] rightmart and it's got one of these
[43:39] rangefinders said, "What is this?" And I
[43:41] looked through something, I seen three
[43:43] or four objects, and they all looked a
[43:45] whole lot alike. I said, "That can't
[43:46] be." So, I looked this way and I only
[43:48] see one. And I looked this way, I seen
[43:51] three or
[43:54] four. I got a hold of this little thing
[43:56] and focused it until it come into one.
[43:59] That's what the church needs.
[44:03] A rangefinder.
[44:06] Use your rangefinder. What is it? Here
[44:08] it is. Amen. For whosoever will take one
[44:11] word from it or add one word to it, the
[44:13] same will be taken his part.
[44:16] Your rangefinder, you got three or four,
[44:18] don't know what to do with it. Pull it
[44:19] down into one. Hallelujah.
[44:23] God is one. His word is one. His people
[44:25] are one. Not 50, 666 organizations.
[44:29] They're one.
[44:31] Just one.
[44:33] That day you'll know what I'm and the
[44:34] father and father and me. I and you and
[44:35] you and me. Right. Take your
[44:38] rangefinder, pull it in. No reverence.
[44:41] So people try to do right, man. Take a
[44:42] stand for the word of God and say, "I'm
[44:44] going to have my congregation cleaned
[44:46] up." The first thing you know, a
[44:47] complaint comes in from somebody else.
[44:48] And they oust him. Yes. Get out on the
[44:51] street. Why? They're not convinced of
[44:55] his presence. You ought to do like David
[44:57] said, "Put the Lord always before my
[44:59] face.
[45:01] I shall not be moved. Let the Lord be
[45:04] before me. I'll have him on my right
[45:07] hand. He'll be before my face. Wherever
[45:09] I see, I only want to see Jesus in it.
[45:11] I'll go no place. I'll do nothing. My
[45:13] influence just let it be for him. Then
[45:16] your rangefinder has found the truth.
[45:19] For if the life of Christ, let the mind
[45:21] that was in Christ be in you. And he
[45:24] always was about the father's word to do
[45:26] his business. Said, which one of you can
[45:28] accuse me of sin, unbelief? Everything
[45:30] the Bible said that I would do, I've
[45:32] proved it. God's proved it through me
[45:33] that I am the Messiah.
[45:36] Which one of you can accuse me of sin?
[45:38] Until you can do the things that I do
[45:40] and make the word prove by you that the
[45:42] words prove by me, then keep still.
[45:43] Because sin is unbelief in the word of
[45:45] God. He that believeth not is condemned
[45:47] already.
[45:50] Where we standing, church, where's it at
[45:53] now? They had two wings over their feet.
[45:56] What was
[45:57] that? Humility in his presence. Moses
[46:01] took off his shoes in the presence of
[46:04] God. Paul fell down to the ground to
[46:08] kiss the ground as it was. He was in the
[46:10] presence of God. John the Baptist said,
[46:12] "I'm not even worthy to loose the shoes
[46:14] on his feet."
[46:16] Wings over their feet, humility,
[46:18] watching where they walk, what they do,
[46:20] realizing they're on holy ground. Oh, if
[46:22] we would do that, we'd never walk in the
[46:25] these places. It's wrong. We'd never do
[46:27] these things. And that's wrong. Now
[46:30] notice, always listen, be conscious of
[46:34] your
[46:35] littleness. Who are you? Stick your
[46:38] finger in a bucket of water and pull it
[46:39] out and find the hole you put your
[46:40] finger
[46:41] in. Then say that was
[46:45] me. You're a
[46:47] nothing. You'll not be missed a little
[46:50] while after you're gone. They have a
[46:51] funeral possession out here and that's
[46:52] all.
[46:53] But your influence, we live on and on
[46:57] and on. That's why today in the midst of
[46:59] infidels, they've never been able to
[47:02] explain and get away from the influence
[47:04] of one man, Jesus Christ, who was God
[47:07] made flesh.
[47:08] When he stuck his life down here on
[47:10] earth, it made a suction of a place that
[47:12] draws all man under him in the great
[47:15] whirlpool of his life that was once on
[47:17] earth.
[47:21] You can't get near it without being
[47:22] drawn into it. Right?
[47:24] But you and I, we're
[47:27] nothing. We're
[47:29] nothing. Let's think what's drawing us.
[47:32] I'm my little boat up on the sea of
[47:34] time. Don't mean nothing, but that great
[47:36] thing is drawing me. It's what I'm
[47:37] trying to pour to you. This is it. Oh,
[47:40] good. Be conscious of your little.
[47:42] Thirdly, let's
[47:44] think. He with two wings he had over his
[47:47] face in the presence of God, humility
[47:50] and or reverence. And secondly, he had
[47:53] two wings over his feet. What was it? In
[47:56] humility. And third, he flew with them.
[48:00] Put himself in
[48:01] action. He he put himself in action with
[48:04] two wings while two more wings covered
[48:07] his face in reverence. Two wings covered
[48:09] his feet in humility. And two wings he
[48:12] was in action.
[48:14] What was he doing? He was showing the
[48:17] prophet. By this he was showing the
[48:20] prophet how his prepared servants must
[48:24] be God prepared service must be
[48:28] reverent, humble and inaction.
[48:34] Hallelujah. But now if you uncover your
[48:35] face, uncover your feet, your action
[48:38] isn't going to do no good because you're
[48:39] stirred
[48:41] wrong. Takes it all to guide you.
[48:44] Reverent, humble, and in action. That's
[48:47] what God wants this Pentecostal group to
[48:49] be. What God wants his church to be in
[48:52] action like the woman at the
[48:55] well as soon as she stood there and
[48:57] looked upon this Jew that was speaking
[48:59] to her and he said woman bring me a
[49:03] drink and she said well the the the well
[49:05] is deep and said you have nothing to
[49:07] draw with and by the way first said we
[49:09] have no dealings with one another. You
[49:11] know this segregation here. Well we
[49:14] don't have any dealings. You're I'm a
[49:15] woman of Samaria and and you're a Jew.
[49:17] We don't have anything. See, she went
[49:20] with the old trend. But he said to her,
[49:22] "If you knew who you were talking to or
[49:25] who was talking to you, you'd ask me for
[49:27] a drink." She said, "The well's deep.
[49:28] You have nothing to row with." He said,
[49:30] "Go get your husband and come here."
[49:32] Well, she said, "I have no husband." He
[49:34] said, "You told the
[49:35] truth. You've had five, and the one
[49:38] you're living with now is not your
[49:40] husband. Look quickly."
[49:43] She backed off. What was it? Not like
[49:46] the Pharisees when they seen that did.
[49:48] They said, "This man's beubb fortune
[49:50] teller. He has mental
[49:53] telepathy. We'll have nothing. We'll
[49:55] explain it all the way to our
[49:56] congregation. After all, he don't know
[49:57] the word. We come out of school. We have
[49:59] no record of him ever coming out of our
[50:03] seminaries." But he had truth.
[50:06] Vindicated Godgiven truth.
[50:09] Yes. What happened? Her wings quickly
[50:12] went over her face. The wings went over
[50:14] her feet. She said,
[50:16] "Sir," not Belub,
[50:20] "Sir, the best I know, you must be a
[50:23] prophet." Now, I know we haven't had a
[50:26] prophet for hundreds of years. But the
[50:28] scripture says that when the Messiah
[50:30] comes, he'll be a prophet like Moses.
[50:32] And we know when Messiah come, he'll do
[50:34] these things. But I don't understand who
[50:36] are you? You must be a prophet. when
[50:38] this Messiah comes, he's going to do the
[50:40] same thing that you did because he'll be
[50:42] the God prophet. He said, "I'm he that
[50:44] speaks to you." Then she went in action.
[50:50] Come see a man. Amen. What did he do
[50:53] today? What do you say today? You don't
[50:55] belong to
[50:57] organization. No reverence, no humility
[51:00] to join up with our groups. When they
[51:02] see a church rise up like that, it's
[51:04] it's a Pentecostal rank. Look where it
[51:06] come from. Birds of a feather. That's
[51:08] good. Doves always are together. So he
[51:11] pine
[51:12] said certainly they eat dove food too,
[51:15] not crow food. A crow's a hypocrite. He
[51:18] can eat dove food and be a vulture at
[51:20] the same time. But a dove can't eat crow
[51:23] food. He has got no
[51:25] gall, right? He'd eat the killing.
[51:30] But the old crow can sit down and eat a
[51:31] mess of of of his own scavenger appetite
[51:36] fill it and go right out and eat corn
[51:37] with the dove. But can't do that with a
[51:41] dove. He can only eat his own food. And
[51:42] a real dove of God only eats the word.
[51:45] He can't take the things of the world.
[51:46] No sir. He can't stomach it. It's all
[51:48] killing. So he just can't stand it. But
[51:51] they all set on the same roost. And
[51:53] there that's they did it in the ark and
[51:54] they've done it ever since. So there you
[51:56] are. Jesus said, "Let him alone." said
[51:58] at that day the wheat and will be taken
[52:00] to the garner and so forth. I'm holding
[52:03] you long, but I I hurry. If I can notice
[52:07] just quick, I don't mean to say it any,
[52:09] you know, this is not a joking
[52:10] paraphrase. This is scripture. See,
[52:12] humble. The woman went in action. Why?
[52:14] First, she revered. Sir, I perceive that
[52:18] you are a prophet. Wings over feet, over
[52:20] faith. She recognized you are a prophet.
[52:24] I believe that. We know when Messiah
[52:26] come. Now, we haven't had a prophet
[52:27] since Malachi. But we are taught down
[52:29] here that someday there will rise one on
[52:31] the scene among the Jews and he'll be
[52:33] the Messiah. And Moses said, the one
[52:35] that we're told, if there be a man among
[52:37] you who's spiritual or prophet, and what
[52:38] this man says comes to pass, then you
[52:40] know it. That's just the same thing that
[52:42] Jeremiah said to to Hannah and so forth.
[52:45] If this comes to pass and we know it's
[52:47] vindicated, that's the truth. And now
[52:48] here you tell me that I have five
[52:50] husbands and that's the truth and I'm
[52:52] living with another man now. So I know
[52:54] that you must be a prophet. I know it's
[52:56] time for the Messiah to come and he'll
[52:57] tell us those things. And he said, "I'm
[52:59] he." And as soon as he identified
[53:02] himself, she went in action right down
[53:05] through the city and said, "Come see a
[53:07] man who told me the things I've done.
[53:08] Isn't this the very Messiah? Don't miss
[53:11] it, man. He's setting out down the
[53:13] stump." Hallelujah. Oh, could I say it
[53:16] this morning? That same Messiah in the
[53:18] form of the Holy Ghost is right here
[53:20] now. Don't miss it, church. Glory to
[53:23] God.
[53:24] showing the same signs and same thing.
[53:27] The works that I do shall you do also
[53:30] same signs of if a life is in a grape
[53:34] vine growing if if you could transfer
[53:37] the life of a pumpkin into a grape vine
[53:40] well it would grow a pumpkin or
[53:42] watermelon whatever life is in it. If
[53:44] the life of Christ has been transferred
[53:46] into you by the Holy Spirit you bear the
[53:48] fruit you live the
[53:51] life. So you see if we're bearing
[53:54] pumpkins over here and should be bearing
[53:56] grapes, there's something
[53:58] wrong. See, so get that knife out of
[54:00] you. You don't have to take that. The
[54:02] transfusions open this morning. There is
[54:04] a fountain filled with blood. Gone
[54:07] crummy Emanuel's veins. Praise God.
[54:09] Where sinners plunge beneath the flood.
[54:11] Impersonators can plunge there and lose
[54:13] all their impersonation. You get
[54:15] something that's real. And then your
[54:17] influence will be greatly among the
[54:19] people in the presence of God. The woman
[54:21] went in action, Peter. One day he was a
[54:24] little in doubt. Maybe he loaned his
[54:26] boat to a Galilean man that was pretty
[54:29] well uh down in the low bracket amongst
[54:32] the people as a beelub, a fortune
[54:34] teller, some evil spirit was upon him.
[54:36] We know that thou art a Samaritan and
[54:37] mad. We know you have a devil. And all
[54:39] the churches that ousted him out and yet
[54:41] he was just as straight with the word as
[54:42] could be. Dare any of you say he
[54:45] wasn't. That's right. Don't say he
[54:48] wasn't. He was all contrary to any of
[54:49] their beliefs, but he had exactly the
[54:52] word could prove it right in the
[54:53] scripture. He said, "Who can accuse me
[54:54] of sin?" Now, he had it. And when Peter
[54:58] loaned him the boat, he said, "Cast out
[55:00] into the deep and let down for the
[55:02] draw." Said, "I'll feast all night.
[55:03] There ain't nothing out there." Said, I
[55:04] said, "Cast out into the deep." Well, if
[55:07] this man is the Messiah, he's prophet.
[55:08] So, I'll pull the boat out here. And he
[55:10] threw the net over and he said, "At your
[55:12] word, I'll take it because I don't know
[55:14] you, but your your your speech sound all
[55:16] right. So I'll throw the net out and
[55:18] see. And I throw the net out and when it
[55:20] went down, he said, "Depart from me,
[55:21] Lord. I'm a sinful man." Same thing
[55:24] Isaiah had to say. Depart from me, Lord.
[55:28] I'm a man of unclean lips. I dwell among
[55:30] unclean people. He found out that the
[55:33] word of God worked when you take God at
[55:35] his word. The blind man, when he was
[55:37] healed, he couldn't hold his peace. Why?
[55:41] He is in action. Peter went in action.
[55:44] The woman went in action. the blind man.
[55:46] He couldn't hold his peace. He said, "Is
[55:47] this man uh give glory to God? We know
[55:50] this man's a sinner." So, it's a strange
[55:52] thing that you all don't know who he is.
[55:54] And being leaders, it's a strange thing.
[55:56] The day has arrived on us that a man
[55:58] could open the eyes of a blind man and
[55:59] you clergymen don't know who he is. That
[56:02] man had some good
[56:04] theology. Said, "That's a strange thing
[56:06] among you people are supposed to be the
[56:08] spiritual leaders of the day. And a
[56:09] man's eyes has been open here. Me being
[56:11] blind, you know, I'm blind. You know, I
[56:13] was blind and now I can see." said
[56:14] whether he's a sinner or not, I don't
[56:15] know, but I do know one thing. I can see
[56:17] where I was blind before. He went in
[56:20] action. He covered his face, covered his
[56:23] feet. He said, "Lord, who is this that I
[56:25] might worship him?" Man, he wanted to
[56:27] know the blind man. Sure, he scattered
[56:30] his fame abroad everywhere. Listen, the
[56:33] people at
[56:34] Pentecost, they covered their feet. They
[56:36] covered their faces. They didn't care
[56:38] what the Jews said. They had a
[56:40] commission from God, a word of God to go
[56:42] up to the temple to Jerusalem and wait
[56:44] up there at Jerusalem until the Holy
[56:46] Spirit came. And there they was obeying
[56:50] his word. Humility bowing when the
[56:53] church is laughing at him. A bunch of
[56:54] heretics is in the upper room up there.
[56:56] Face is covered in the presence of God.
[56:58] Oh Lord, you gave the promise. If
[57:00] there's any evil in me, cleanse me,
[57:02] Lord. All at once, there came down wings
[57:05] of action and they went into action.
[57:08] They who were scared wouldn't give a
[57:09] testimony out on the street. They were
[57:11] in the street speaking with other
[57:13] tongues and and in action in so much as
[57:15] the people said, "These men are full of
[57:17] new
[57:17] wine." And then Peter, the one who could
[57:20] keep the scripture scriptures straight,
[57:22] said, "These are not full of new wine."
[57:24] But this is that.
[57:26] And I've always said, "If this isn't
[57:28] that, I'll just keep this to that
[57:29] comes." So I I like this. Well, I'll
[57:32] just stay with this until that gets
[57:34] here. I believe this is that.
[57:39] All right. Yeah. They seen God's promise
[57:42] fulfilled. It put them in action. And
[57:45] what we have seen, what we have seen
[57:49] these promises in these last days, what
[57:52] we have seen ourselves ought to put each
[57:54] one of us in action. But you know why?
[57:56] We don't cover our faces and our feet,
[57:59] right? Our wings won't work. See, we got
[58:02] these wings spread out and these wings
[58:04] spread out and trying to spread these
[58:05] two. We're just faning air.
[58:08] Cover yourself, humble
[58:10] yourself, then get in action. Amen. Oh
[58:14] my. What we've seen happen should put
[58:16] every soul in action. It should make a
[58:18] church that would make a revival here in
[58:20] Phoenix that people be flying in from
[58:22] Europe to see what taking place. They
[58:24] said there's a place in Arizona called
[58:25] the Maricopa Valley, a city called
[58:27] Phoenix. There's something broke out
[58:29] there until the seven thunders of
[58:32] Revelations 10 is not even wrote in the
[58:34] Bible is being manifested.
[58:36] The power of God, the end time is here.
[58:41] The angel has gathered up the loose ends
[58:42] and we're here.
[58:45] He's about to write those thunders. And
[58:46] he said, "Don't write them. Seal them
[58:48] up." And at that day of the sounding of
[58:50] this last seventh angel, seventh church
[58:52] age, the lady of sin church age, the
[58:54] mystery of God, all about God, how God's
[58:56] not a big bunch of gods but one God, and
[58:58] all these other things should all be
[59:00] finished in that time. The great battles
[59:02] back before it's got the loose ends
[59:03] hanging out at RP all racked up
[59:04] together. in this last age said then
[59:06] when that sound an angel come down and
[59:09] said time shall be no more I'll swear of
[59:11] him that lives forever and ever time
[59:12] shall be no more oh we are here brother
[59:15] sister we're at the time let's let the
[59:19] holy spirit influence us through the
[59:20] word of god let's let god do the
[59:23] influencing in our hearts and not be
[59:24] influenced by others see this ought to
[59:26] put us in action with reverence and
[59:28] humility the pillar of fire vindicated
[59:31] among us again like it was to bring the
[59:33] children of Israel signs of his coming
[59:35] is at hand. Oh my the word by the word
[59:39] being fulfilled. We see the promise the
[59:42] last days he pour out his spirit. Look
[59:44] at the Presbyterian Methodist and
[59:45] Baptist. They're coming into this move.
[59:48] Did you know that? Listen, brethren, do
[59:51] you not understand the scriptures? The
[59:53] Bible said when the sleeping virgin come
[59:55] to buy or that was the time that the
[59:57] bridegroom
[59:59] came. I notice in your full gospel
[1:00:02] businessman, how you bring in father so
[1:00:04] and so the Presbyterian, you bring in
[1:00:07] father so and so the Catholic and all of
[1:00:09] this. By the way, they're not fathers.
[1:00:11] The Bible said call no old man father on
[1:00:13] this earth. They're ministers and I
[1:00:16] respect them in every respect they can
[1:00:18] be respected, but you're not to call
[1:00:20] them fathers. And you businessmen, I
[1:00:22] hope that editor's here this morning.
[1:00:25] How comes you write a decoration on the
[1:00:27] back of what your creeds are and things
[1:00:29] like that and be in a denomination? You
[1:00:31] better get out of that.
[1:00:34] All right. Notice my brethren. Listen.
[1:00:38] When the bridegroom came, the sleeping
[1:00:40] virgin woke and the sound come. Behold,
[1:00:42] the bridegroom cometh. Is that the day
[1:00:44] we're living in? And the sleeping virgin
[1:00:46] rose. And the Methodist and
[1:00:48] Presbyterian, Catholic, all come. Oh,
[1:00:51] oh, give us some of this. We see it.
[1:00:53] They said, "We just got enough for
[1:00:54] yourself. Now you have to carry it for
[1:00:55] it yourself." And while they were
[1:00:57] carrying
[1:00:58] the bride come
[1:01:02] and never in the history of the church
[1:01:04] age, never in the history of the
[1:01:06] Pentecostal realm in these last 50 years
[1:01:08] has ever been a time that the
[1:01:10] denominational world is sweeping in like
[1:01:12] it is right now. Don't you realize that
[1:01:14] this is the last call? That's it.
[1:01:17] That's it. And yet we just haphazardly
[1:01:20] go on like it wasn't even nothing
[1:01:21] happened. Glory to God. I can dance in
[1:01:23] the spirit not oh my Jesus said many
[1:01:25] will come to me in that day say Lord
[1:01:27] Lord haven't I done these
[1:01:30] things sincerity your
[1:01:34] influence
[1:01:36] my yes what we've seen come to pass
[1:01:38] should put us in
[1:01:40] action we like the prophet Isaiah we
[1:01:44] have seen the self-exalted denominations
[1:01:46] lose their
[1:01:48] place what happened when the revival
[1:01:51] come with Luther What did they do? Just
[1:01:53] a little while and they organized, made
[1:01:54] a Lutheran organization, draw a little
[1:01:56] line, said we're Luther's arrested, he's
[1:01:57] out. God broke it up with John
[1:02:00] Wesley. And then when John Wesley left,
[1:02:02] Charles and John and Asbury one day left
[1:02:05] off the scene. They organized it. What
[1:02:07] did you do? Draw the same line like the
[1:02:09] Catholic Church did. Made an
[1:02:11] organization. There was an organization
[1:02:12] to the Catholic Church. It's the mother
[1:02:13] of all of it. You that know history
[1:02:16] knows Council. Now we find out there you
[1:02:20] organized. What did you do? It died.
[1:02:22] Methodist died right there. It's never
[1:02:24] moved
[1:02:25] since. Up come the Pentecostals and what
[1:02:27] did you do? The general assembly known
[1:02:29] as the Assemblies of God. Oh, you
[1:02:31] organized yourself. What did you do?
[1:02:33] Begin to quote. Then along come the one
[1:02:36] that's called the new issue. What did
[1:02:37] you do? Went out and organized yourself.
[1:02:39] God add a little something to the church
[1:02:40] and you Oh, we got it. You all are out
[1:02:42] of it.
[1:02:44] Oh my brother, that's not God.
[1:02:49] Don't you see? What did you do? died
[1:02:51] right in the track.
[1:02:53] God raised up the Christian businessman
[1:02:54] here in the last days and if they start
[1:02:57] the same thing, they'll die right there.
[1:03:00] Exactly right. You never do that. What?
[1:03:03] What happened? Isaiah saw a great man
[1:03:07] lose his influence and die.
[1:03:10] And so have we seen the time in this
[1:03:13] last day that when God is don't have to
[1:03:16] raise up a Pentecostal, he can raise up
[1:03:19] a Presbyterian apac. He could raise up
[1:03:22] somebody that's from none of it,
[1:03:26] right? He's able of these stones to rise
[1:03:28] children Abraham. Hallelujah. And we see
[1:03:31] him go right outside of the ranks of
[1:03:32] Pentecost and raise up a man that knows
[1:03:34] nothing about you and make a make you
[1:03:36] ashamed of yourself. Then you turn it
[1:03:38] down and say, "Oh, nonsense." While the
[1:03:40] praiser put me right out. Oh, brother.
[1:03:42] You see where you got? Isaiah saw that
[1:03:45] lose its hope. And we see those
[1:03:47] denominations lose their
[1:03:49] hold. Oh, you're great in number. That's
[1:03:52] true. You'd be better. God said, "When
[1:03:54] you was little, you revered me." And and
[1:03:56] I when you was little, I could talk to
[1:03:57] you, but when you got so big, I couldn't
[1:03:59] talk to you. Then you had to run on your
[1:04:00] own. That's what we're doing. Like a
[1:04:03] great Regina, a 16cylinder Duenberger.
[1:04:06] We got a political machine in the regime
[1:04:09] in the and the movements. It's presbyers
[1:04:12] and and all these other different things
[1:04:15] that dominate the thing and the Holy
[1:04:17] Spirit's counted out. You try to do
[1:04:19] something that's a little contrary to
[1:04:20] your doctrine, then say, "Oh, nonsense."
[1:04:22] Check it with the word. If it's a word,
[1:04:24] believe it. If it's not, leave it
[1:04:26] alone. God will vindicate his word.
[1:04:30] Right? how is seen that that man I'm
[1:04:35] going to say something and I don't want
[1:04:37] to hurt but I want to make it
[1:04:42] stick he saw a man with great influence
[1:04:45] what lose his hope because he failed to
[1:04:49] keep the word is that
[1:04:52] right now we have lived to see the same
[1:04:55] thing that all these great denominations
[1:04:58] are losing their influence Amen.
[1:05:02] God reaches over in another section
[1:05:03] somewhere, picks up something has
[1:05:04] nothing to do with you. See, we see it.
[1:05:07] These great denominations by their creed
[1:05:09] lose their hope. Why? They're trying to
[1:05:11] manufacture something to take the place
[1:05:14] of the office of the anointed.
[1:05:19] You know that's the truth.
[1:05:23] You'll never be able to do it.
[1:05:26] Hallelujah. God will take his anointing
[1:05:29] and you cannot impersonate that office.
[1:05:33] God anoints. He chooses who he wills. He
[1:05:35] condemns who he wills. It's God that
[1:05:37] does the justifying. It's God that does
[1:05:39] the choosing
[1:05:41] and he raises it
[1:05:43] up and we reject it. And then we see the
[1:05:47] influence lost. God moves right on in
[1:05:49] his humility and his way of humbleness
[1:05:51] and brings a group right out for his
[1:05:52] name's sake as he promised he would do.
[1:05:55] Yeah. We like you. We see the great
[1:05:58] denominations lose their place because
[1:06:00] they try to take the place of the
[1:06:02] anointed with the denomination instead
[1:06:04] of taking the anointed work.
[1:06:07] Hezekiah was a great king. God made him
[1:06:09] a king. That's all right. But when he
[1:06:11] tried to take himself and make himself a
[1:06:14] priest, he couldn't do it. We can make
[1:06:16] ourselves nothing. You can't make
[1:06:18] bishops and prophets and so forth. You
[1:06:21] can't manufacture them.
[1:06:23] It's got to be born in you. Amen. Got to
[1:06:26] be the spirit of God predestinated from
[1:06:28] the foundation of the world. God said in
[1:06:30] the church, God did what he did. And
[1:06:33] when we try to impersonate, we lose our
[1:06:35] influence. Oh, church, why can't we
[1:06:37] listen? It's like a ball game. Somebody
[1:06:40] in a football game, somebody gets the
[1:06:42] ball and every one of his own players
[1:06:43] try and take the ball away from him. You
[1:06:46] can't win the game. Be a guard. Guard
[1:06:49] the ball.
[1:06:51] Not try to take it away from the next
[1:06:52] man. Glory to God. If he can do it over
[1:06:53] here on this corner, God bless him. I
[1:06:55] I'm a oneness. I can do it. I'm a
[1:06:57] trinitarian. I can do it. He ain't got
[1:06:58] no business doing that. You're knocking
[1:07:00] the ball out of your own players hands.
[1:07:03] All you Methodist, Baptist,
[1:07:04] Presbyterian, Lutheran, oneist, tunist,
[1:07:07] if you're riding a one hump camel, two
[1:07:09] hump camels, or you got a dozen humps,
[1:07:11] what difference does it make? Let's all
[1:07:13] come to this well. A fountain filled
[1:07:15] with blood coming in.
[1:07:20] Let's guard the ball. This is the ball.
[1:07:22] The Holy Spirit's trying to pack it.
[1:07:25] It'll condemn communism. It'll condemn
[1:07:27] sin. It'll condemn unrighteousness.
[1:07:30] It'll manifest and glorify Jesus Christ
[1:07:32] and bring his person into the midst of
[1:07:35] the people. Amen. Praise God. Sure.
[1:07:38] Praise God. Oh, that's good. Yes, sir.
[1:07:41] The vision of the prophet caused a
[1:07:45] confession. You just get in the presence
[1:07:47] of God once. You see a vision, a true
[1:07:50] vision from God. You see how little you
[1:07:52] are. That's why I'm on the West Coast
[1:07:55] now. No, it's just get in the presence
[1:07:58] of God once and see what happens. That's
[1:08:00] it. See, it calls a prophet. What did
[1:08:02] this
[1:08:04] prophet really? I'm going to close. A
[1:08:07] prophet, a man of influence, a tall man
[1:08:10] beyond a bishop, beyond a state
[1:08:13] president, beyond a clergyman, a doctor
[1:08:16] of degree. He said, "I'm a
[1:08:19] sinner, and I'm a man of unclean
[1:08:23] lips, a man who had an office as a
[1:08:26] prophet, and when them angels come
[1:08:28] around him, he
[1:08:29] recognized that he was a sinner. And yet
[1:08:33] our women can wear short hair, dance in
[1:08:36] the
[1:08:37] spirit. The rain falls on the just and
[1:08:40] the unjust. Our men can clean their
[1:08:42] organizations and call everything else a
[1:08:44] devil. is not with them and still dance
[1:08:46] in the spirit and preach the gospel and
[1:08:48] call themselves. Oh brother, there's
[1:08:51] something
[1:08:52] wrong. It's right. Don't Don't get
[1:08:55] angry. You believe just just be sincere
[1:08:59] before God while I finish a minute. It
[1:09:01] calls this great prophet to say, "I'm a
[1:09:04] sinner. I'm a man of unclean
[1:09:07] lips." Then when he ready to confess,
[1:09:10] then come to cleanse him.
[1:09:13] Did you notice that? He said, "Oh, I'm a
[1:09:15] man undone. I'm a man of unclean lips.
[1:09:18] Oh, I'm the highest order of
[1:09:20] spirituality as a spiritual office in
[1:09:22] the land. I'm a prophet of this land,
[1:09:24] but I'm unclean. My lips are not clean.
[1:09:28] I'm all undone. Woe is me. I see the
[1:09:30] Lord God of hosts." Hallelujah. When
[1:09:33] them angels had their faces covered to
[1:09:35] stand in his presence, then you realize
[1:09:38] if the church could only realize that
[1:09:40] this Holy Spirit is the Lord God of
[1:09:42] hostise.
[1:09:44] Cover your face, your feet, get down. He
[1:09:47] confessed. Notice then come his
[1:09:50] cleansing. Now I'm going to say
[1:09:51] something, but don't get
[1:09:53] hurt. His cleansing never come by a
[1:09:57] creed. It come by fire. His cleansing
[1:10:01] never come by the declaration of some
[1:10:03] book. What so and so said, his cleansing
[1:10:07] came by the fire. The angel went and got
[1:10:10] fire off the altar and laid it on the
[1:10:12] prophet's lips. The cleansing comes by
[1:10:14] Holy Ghost and fire. Not a new bachelor
[1:10:16] of art or doctor's degree or something.
[1:10:19] As Paris Reed had said not long ago when
[1:10:21] he received the Holy Ghost in my front
[1:10:22] room, he said, "Brother Bram, I've got
[1:10:23] enough degrees to plaster your wall, but
[1:10:25] where's God in all of
[1:10:26] it?" He said, "Is the teachers been
[1:10:28] wrong?" I said, "Me with the seventh
[1:10:30] grade education say the teachers are
[1:10:31] wrong. I'm not that." They were right in
[1:10:33] what they taught against, but they never
[1:10:34] taught far enough. Like the man eating
[1:10:37] watermelon said that part was good, but
[1:10:39] he said, "More of it. Just give him a
[1:10:41] bite, then take it away from him." No,
[1:10:43] sir. It's like feeding a canary bird uh
[1:10:46] great big humps of vitamins to make
[1:10:48] great big fine speckle wings or wings
[1:10:50] and make fine bones and make him a big
[1:10:52] strong bird and then put him in a cage.
[1:10:55] You can't use it. Let him loose. Amen.
[1:10:59] Let God go to work on him. Put him in
[1:11:00] action. If he's ready to cover his feet
[1:11:02] and that's right, but remember it won't
[1:11:05] work until you cover your feet. You just
[1:11:07] stand fan. I'm assembly. I'm a one. I'm
[1:11:10] this. You just stand there faning the
[1:11:11] wind get nowhere. But once cover your
[1:11:13] faith, cover your feet. Then ain't going
[1:11:15] action. Lord God, you're here.
[1:11:17] Hallelujah. First there comes a
[1:11:19] cleansing.
[1:11:20] Notice and following the cleansing was a
[1:11:23] commission.
[1:11:24] Oh
[1:11:26] my. Yes.
[1:11:28] First a
[1:11:30] confession, then a cleansing, and then a
[1:11:34] commission. After the cleansed Isaiah
[1:11:37] was cleansed by the fire, then he cried
[1:11:39] out after he was cleansed, "Lord, here
[1:11:42] am I. Send me." Amen. Oh, church,
[1:11:47] businessman, let's not lose our
[1:11:49] influence. I'm
[1:11:51] closing. Let's cover our faces this
[1:11:53] morning. Thank you, Lord. Lord, I'm
[1:11:55] nothing, Lord. Mold me and make me a
[1:11:58] new. I'm down in the temple. Let me
[1:12:00] cover my feet. Lord, I'm nothing. I'm
[1:12:03] willing to forget all I ever know. Like
[1:12:05] Paul, I'll know nothing but save Christ
[1:12:07] and him crucified. Let me Lord humble
[1:12:10] myself. And then when you raise up from
[1:12:12] there with a real confession, real
[1:12:15] cleansing, then when the call comes, who
[1:12:17] will go forth? Then Isaiah, you can
[1:12:20] answer here am I send me. Your life will
[1:12:23] influence your family.
[1:12:25] It'll influence your neighbors. It'll
[1:12:27] influence your church. It'll you just
[1:12:29] put one or two good members in a church
[1:12:31] that's really on fire for God. It'll do
[1:12:33] something for that church more than 40
[1:12:35] revivals you could have. That's right. A
[1:12:38] good cleansed member. Set an example
[1:12:41] with a face shining with the glory of
[1:12:43] God, sweetness, and humility to stand
[1:12:45] there in the power of God and watch when
[1:12:46] somebody gets sick. They'll call that
[1:12:48] person to come pray. Or you might make
[1:12:49] fun of them and their tires deflated and
[1:12:51] so forth. You might all this nonsense
[1:12:53] say, "But let death strike you one
[1:12:55] time." You'll find out when them
[1:12:57] struggles begins to come who that real
[1:12:58] sincere person is in the
[1:13:01] church. Here am I, Lord. Send me. Let my
[1:13:05] influence be upon others. Lord, for me
[1:13:07] to live is Christ and to die as gain.
[1:13:10] Let this word influence me in my
[1:13:11] prayers. Lord, while I'm in this valley
[1:13:14] here of the Maricopa Valley, the little
[1:13:15] sunspot of the world, may I be able to
[1:13:18] be in contact with the son of God that
[1:13:20] would scatter sunshine of the Holy
[1:13:22] Spirit throughout the valley and will
[1:13:23] cause brethren and women, sisters, and
[1:13:26] even sinners to find this fountain
[1:13:28] filled with blood. May we all come to
[1:13:30] the place of the temple where we can
[1:13:32] recognize ourselves unclean and live
[1:13:34] such a life that'll influence others to
[1:13:36] love Christ. Let us pray.
[1:13:42] While we have our heads
[1:13:44] bowed, I'm going to hum real I can't
[1:13:47] sing. Y'all just hum it with me when I
[1:13:49] speak the words. When the coal of fire
[1:13:54] had touched the
[1:13:57] prophet, making him as pure as pure
[1:14:01] could be.
[1:14:04] When the voice of God said, "Who go for
[1:14:09] us?" Then he answered,
[1:14:13] "Master, here send
[1:14:17] me. Speak my lord." All together now.
[1:14:21] Speak my
[1:14:23] lord. Speak and I'll be quick to answer
[1:14:28] thee.
[1:14:30] Speak my
[1:14:33] Lord. Speak my
[1:14:38] Lord. Speak and I will
[1:14:44] answer.
[1:14:47] Lord sincerely now listen. Millions now
[1:14:52] and sin and shame are dying.
[1:14:57] Listen to their sad and bitter
[1:15:01] cry. Hasten, brother, hasten to their
[1:15:07] rescue. Quickly answer, Master, here am
[1:15:13] I. All it wants to go raise your hands
[1:15:15] now. Speak my
[1:15:19] Lord. Speak my Lord.
[1:15:23] Speak and I'll be quick to answer
[1:15:29] thee. Speak my
[1:15:33] Lord. Speak my
[1:15:38] Lord. Speak and I will
[1:15:44] answer.
[1:15:46] Lord, send me.
[1:15:50] Heavenly Father, let that be the depths
[1:15:53] of our
[1:15:54] heart. Truly millions now in sin and
[1:15:58] shame or
[1:15:59] dying. Right here in the city of
[1:16:01] Phoenix, literally thousands groping in
[1:16:04] sin. And here we stand this morning and
[1:16:07] shrouded with the presence of the Holy
[1:16:10] Spirit. We're all conscious of his
[1:16:13] august
[1:16:14] presence. I feel him in my heart. I feel
[1:16:17] him upon the people.
[1:16:20] Oh God, may a vision come to us that we
[1:16:24] can see the holiness of God, see how
[1:16:27] little we
[1:16:28] are. May the temple post be moved in our
[1:16:32] presence and there while we're in his
[1:16:34] presence. Lord, may the power of the
[1:16:36] Holy Spirit just shake us, oh Lord, that
[1:16:39] not only the temple post to be moved,
[1:16:41] but the post in our heart will be moved.
[1:16:44] the post of indifference that let the
[1:16:46] door of God's opportunity to come in be
[1:16:50] moved away the stone of unbelief taken
[1:16:54] away and let us Lord answer quickly
[1:16:57] master I humble myself I want wings over
[1:17:01] my feet and over my face first Lord
[1:17:05] humble me that I might be influenced to
[1:17:08] the others grant it Lord bless this
[1:17:10] convention bless this meetings coming on
[1:17:12] in these churches these is my brethren,
[1:17:14] Lord. In the face of opposition, they've
[1:17:17] called me and asked me to come down and
[1:17:18] speak in their churches. Oh God, light
[1:17:21] each candle. Granted, Lord, may there
[1:17:24] come such a light, such a great revival
[1:17:27] across Phoenix. Grant, Lord, that this
[1:17:29] will be done amongst all the churches
[1:17:31] and all your people and all the places
[1:17:34] and all the denominations. And many of
[1:17:36] those precious souls out there on the
[1:17:38] street are looking and wandering and
[1:17:40] waiting to see the life of Christ being
[1:17:42] manifested among these people. Granted,
[1:17:45] Lord, we might not be able to influence
[1:17:47] the whole city. Hardly ever that was
[1:17:50] ever done because in there the wheat and
[1:17:52] terriers are together, but Lord, may we
[1:17:54] be so enthused that we'll try to light
[1:17:57] one little candle each day by telling
[1:17:59] someone else, doing something that will
[1:18:02] influence others to know you and to love
[1:18:04] you. for to know you is life. We pray
[1:18:07] this blessing. Bless our brother
[1:18:09] Williams here, Lord, and Sister
[1:18:10] Williams. We love them. They they're
[1:18:13] they're your servants. We believe in
[1:18:15] humility, Lord. They are bowing at your
[1:18:17] feet. We're so glad to see how you are
[1:18:19] working among their family with their
[1:18:21] their daughters and their and their
[1:18:23] sons. How gracious you are to them.
[1:18:26] Brother Rose and so many of the others
[1:18:28] here, Lord, a man, a a great man and my
[1:18:31] minister brothers that's around over the
[1:18:34] town and my sisters, Lord, that's that
[1:18:37] they're your children and I I want to
[1:18:39] put my shoulder with the with them,
[1:18:41] Lord. I want to press hard. Help me, oh
[1:18:44] God. I'm small. I'm little and I can't
[1:18:47] push very hard. Lord, let me stand there
[1:18:48] and you do the pushing. Grant it, Lord,
[1:18:51] that we might be able to move the great
[1:18:53] load of God into the kingdom of God.
[1:18:55] Granted, Father, we commit this all to
[1:18:57] you now as we go forward from this day
[1:19:00] and we commit ourselves and we pray for
[1:19:03] a great revival and a may the Christian
[1:19:06] businessmen be able to pick up from
[1:19:08] there and go right on and may it as soon
[1:19:10] as they the convention's over. May the
[1:19:12] churches be all on fire and the revival
[1:19:15] moving on and on and on. May we be able
[1:19:17] to start the fire, Lord. May the Holy
[1:19:19] Spirit fan those blazes until the whole
[1:19:22] community around is burning with
[1:19:24] Pentecostal fire. Granted, Lord, we
[1:19:27] commit it all to you in the name of
[1:19:29] Jesus Christ, thy son.
[1:19:31] Amen. I'm sorry to have held you so long
[1:19:34] because now it's almost noon time. We
[1:19:36] might as well stay for dinner, I guess.
[1:19:38] And so, but I'm I'm grateful to be here.
[1:19:41] Your fellowship, your cooperation has
[1:19:43] been much. And my brothers, how many in
[1:19:45] here that I'm going to be in your
[1:19:46] churches this week? Raise your hands
[1:19:47] around. That's fine. Brothers and
[1:19:48] sisters around, thank you. And we all
[1:19:51] invite you over this week to the
[1:19:52] meetings. Now, I'll turn it to brother
[1:19:53] William now for the closing.
[1:19:57] He can do this job better. Bow your head
[1:19:59] just a minute.
[1:20:02] How many wants down to the altar this
[1:20:04] morning? Really truly wants an altar
[1:20:06] call in your heart. Raise up your hands.
[1:20:07] God, make me what I ought to be. I I'm
[1:20:09] the clay. You're the father. God bless
[1:20:12] you. God bless you. Now, as you put your
[1:20:15] hands down, is there someone here that
[1:20:18] never has accepted Christ? Don't know
[1:20:19] what it means? You maybe you just, oh,
[1:20:23] maybe under some influence that never
[1:20:25] did you a bit of good as soon as the
[1:20:26] influence like went off some little
[1:20:28] spell of emotion, but you went on living
[1:20:31] the same life. Or maybe you never have
[1:20:33] accepted him at all. and you'd like to
[1:20:35] say this morning, God, let that word
[1:20:38] sink into me until I can cover my face
[1:20:40] in humility and cover my feet and kneel
[1:20:43] at your altar until the the seraraphins
[1:20:46] will wave the glory of God over my soul
[1:20:49] and cleanse me with his holy fire. Would
[1:20:51] you raise up your hand say, "Brother
[1:20:52] Brand, pray for me. I'm here in need of
[1:20:54] prayer." But God bless you. God bless
[1:20:56] you. God bless you. Boy, God bless you.
[1:20:58] That you raise your hand. You make a
[1:21:00] decision in your heart. God bless you,
[1:21:01] my brother. Someone else some of our
[1:21:03] sisters here raise your hand say brother
[1:21:06] Brandham I don't believe it it's so that
[1:21:08] you're that you say that call you a
[1:21:11] woman hater I don't believe that I
[1:21:12] believe you love me as your sister and I
[1:21:14] do sister but I'm only trying to tell
[1:21:16] you I'm don't want you to be influenced
[1:21:18] by Marilyn Monroe I want you to be
[1:21:19] influenced by Jesus Christ and by his
[1:21:22] word he is the word and if the word
[1:21:24] don't influence you then Christ came
[1:21:26] because he is the word you know that I
[1:21:30] dreamed the dream not long ago vision
[1:21:32] rather it wasn't a dream. And I stand I
[1:21:34] was out in the woods on a patrol and I
[1:21:37] seen two women and one of them had one
[1:21:39] Pentecostal church wrote and the other
[1:21:41] and the other and he said one said
[1:21:42] sister do you think it's right for
[1:21:44] brother Brand to ball us out like that
[1:21:46] said if Jesus was here said he probably
[1:21:48] wouldn't say it and they didn't know who
[1:21:50] I was and I stand I said well now listen
[1:21:52] the man must be right no matter whether
[1:21:54] you've never seen Jesus yes or no or
[1:21:55] whether he sure he can't change his word
[1:21:57] he'd be just the same they said well
[1:21:59] that's really right isn't oh can't you
[1:22:01] see it's right brother sister can't you
[1:22:03] see it Christ can't change his word. He
[1:22:05] is the word. Would there be some more?
[1:22:06] Raise your hand. Say, "Remember me,
[1:22:08] Brother Brandham. I know I'm not right."
[1:22:09] Pray for me now. Would you just raise
[1:22:11] your hand? God bless you. You mean that.
[1:22:13] Bless you. Bless you. That's good.
[1:22:14] That's fine. God bless you. Just really
[1:22:16] mean it from your heart. We're coming to
[1:22:18] the end of the road now. Just a little
[1:22:21] while
[1:22:22] longer. Maybe in the convention, new
[1:22:24] nights to speak. And I have a night, one
[1:22:26] night at least in the convention. I want
[1:22:27] to speak on some of those things. Just
[1:22:29] something that's from my heart. And the
[1:22:30] very reason I'm standing here this
[1:22:32] morning, there's people riding here can
[1:22:34] say amen and amen. The reason I'm
[1:22:36] standing here this morning, something
[1:22:38] has happened that never happened before
[1:22:39] in my life. That's right. This happened
[1:22:42] and he called me right here to Arizona.
[1:22:44] I'm here for something.
[1:22:50] Millions now in sin and shame are dying.
[1:22:54] Just listen to their sad and bitter cry.
[1:22:57] What makes people do wrong is a thirst
[1:22:59] in them. God made them to thirst. See,
[1:23:02] thirst after him, and they're trying to
[1:23:04] satisfy that that holy call with things
[1:23:08] of the world, joining a church, being
[1:23:11] influenced to a dance or something.
[1:23:14] They're trying to satisfy that holy
[1:23:16] thing that God put in them to thirst
[1:23:17] after him. And what they're doing,
[1:23:19] they're trying to to let the devil uh
[1:23:21] satisfy him by giving them some other
[1:23:23] thing that isn't satisfying. Oh, God,
[1:23:25] let it be taken away this morning. Oh,
[1:23:27] how I'd like to see this group of people
[1:23:28] just so anointed with the Holy Spirit
[1:23:31] that you go out of here to just be
[1:23:32] something happen to you. Just something
[1:23:34] that would take us all from here, me
[1:23:36] with you, Brandon, all of us together go
[1:23:38] out of here under the influence of the
[1:23:39] Holy Spirit to win souls for Jesus
[1:23:43] Christ. Now, with been about 30 hands up
[1:23:46] that wants to come to get right with
[1:23:48] God, there's been at least eight or 10
[1:23:50] or more that sinners has never have
[1:23:52] accepted him. Let us pray. And down in
[1:23:54] your heart, you believe it. That's all
[1:23:56] you can do is believe. It's up to God to
[1:23:59] do the rest. Abraham believed God and it
[1:24:02] was imputed unto him for righteousness.
[1:24:04] That's all Abraham could do. He had to
[1:24:06] believe. God had to do the imput. That's
[1:24:09] all you could do is believe. Just
[1:24:10] sincerely now bow your head over your
[1:24:13] table or wherever you're at and let's
[1:24:15] pray. Lord God, I do realize if there
[1:24:19] had only been one hand, what sort of a
[1:24:22] prayer could I make for that person?
[1:24:24] Just as the Holy Spirit would lead my
[1:24:28] heart, I once set where they are as a
[1:24:33] sinner, knowing not Christ and his
[1:24:37] salvation. One day I accepted you, Lord.
[1:24:40] I didn't know how
[1:24:42] to. I'll never forget it. Lord, it
[1:24:45] changed my life. And I know that's not
[1:24:48] contrary to the word. It's with the
[1:24:50] word. So, Father, in my humble way of
[1:24:52] doing it, will you receive those who
[1:24:54] raised their hands? And even those who
[1:24:56] did not, if they have indeed receive it,
[1:24:59] Lord, take all the world out. Take all
[1:25:02] the desires of the world out. Take it
[1:25:04] from my brethren, from my sisters. Take
[1:25:05] it from me, Lord. I'm with them. We're
[1:25:08] all in the temple of God. And we realize
[1:25:11] that our littleness, how little we are,
[1:25:16] how small and insignificant we are and
[1:25:18] how great thou are. Oh Jehovah, be
[1:25:21] merciful to we sinners. I plead for us
[1:25:24] all, Lord. Take this little group and I
[1:25:27] this morning, cleanse us, Lord. Make us
[1:25:30] new creatures. Won't you plead? In my
[1:25:32] little humble way of asking you, Father,
[1:25:34] I offer this in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:25:37] that you'll receive us. I now commit
[1:25:39] myself to God. I commit my ways, all my
[1:25:43] thinking, my doing. May I not think the
[1:25:45] more my thoughts. May I not more have
[1:25:47] any ways of the world. May they all be
[1:25:49] cleansed. May I just have pure holy
[1:25:51] thoughts from this day on. May my whole
[1:25:53] life be his. Speak to
[1:25:56] me. I wouldn't say do that unless you
[1:25:59] had ordained it. You ordained your
[1:26:01] gospel to be preached by man. You could
[1:26:04] ordain the wind to preach it. You can
[1:26:06] ordain the stars to preach it. You could
[1:26:08] ordain the moon, the sun to preach it,
[1:26:10] but you ordained man. You won't change
[1:26:13] it. You're waiting on man. Amen. You're
[1:26:15] not waiting on the stars. They're
[1:26:17] obeying you. The winds are obeying us,
[1:26:20] but Lord, we man, we're no good. We
[1:26:23] don't obey you. Lord, forgive us. Won't
[1:26:25] you? Won't you forgive us? Forgive us,
[1:26:29] Lord, to make us ministers, all of us.
[1:26:32] Each one in his own his own way. Each
[1:26:35] one in these his own environment. Each
[1:26:37] one in his own way where you do the
[1:26:39] best. We just commit ourselves to you
[1:26:42] now. Make us servants of yours,
[1:26:45] ministers of the word. In Jesus name, I
[1:26:47] offer this prayer. And you taught us all
[1:26:50] that we must pray like this. Our father
[1:26:53] who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[1:26:57] Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on
[1:27:00] earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
[1:27:03] day our daily bread. And forgive us of
[1:27:06] our trespasses as we forgive those that
[1:27:09] trespass against us. Lead us not into
[1:27:12] temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[1:27:15] For thine is the kingdom, the power, and
[1:27:18] the glory forever.
[1:27:21] Amen. Don't never let it
[1:27:26] die.
[1:27:28] He careth for thee.
[1:27:31] [Music]
[1:27:34] He careth for
[1:27:37] you
[1:27:39] through sunshine our
[1:27:43] [Music]
[1:27:44] shadow.
[1:27:46] [Music]
[1:27:47] He for you. Did he not express it? Now
[1:27:52] right across the table, let's shake each
[1:27:54] other's hands. Just remain seated.
[1:27:56] He cared for. Say, "God bless you,
[1:28:00] pilgrim.
[1:28:04] [Music]
[1:28:22] Amen. We thank God for his word tonight.
[1:28:25] Amen. God bless you. Let's all stand. We
[1:28:27] have a few prayer
[1:28:29] requests. Of course, for Sister
[1:28:32] Lorie Snow, she was in the hospital with
[1:28:36] multiple surgeries for her heart and
[1:28:40] things in her body. Very serious. And
[1:28:43] the Lord has been with her all the way
[1:28:45] through. We thank the Lord for that.
[1:28:48] Amen. We've been praying for her. He's
[1:28:50] been praying for her. Oh my, it's so
[1:28:53] good to be in contact with people who
[1:28:56] will actually pray for you. That's
[1:28:59] really valuable and we thank God for it
[1:29:01] that she's a part of our family here and
[1:29:06] uh for the Randy and the whole situation
[1:29:09] there. So we'll keep continue to keep
[1:29:11] her in prayer. Is there another request
[1:29:13] you need to make known
[1:29:15] tonight
[1:29:19] sister?
[1:29:21] Okay, for that someone
[1:29:30] else sister Emma's traveling to
[1:29:33] Pennsylvania will be with
[1:29:36] her. Any other
[1:29:38] ones? I just sent a text to Aaron
[1:29:42] Melissa in the back there Timothy
[1:29:46] Williams pastor in Baltimore. He's been
[1:29:48] with us at the other building there. He
[1:29:52] um this church building there, someone
[1:29:55] ran into it at night and caught on fire
[1:29:58] and so forth. And so they uh have a need
[1:30:02] there in their building. And um he
[1:30:05] believes it's all of the Lord, but they
[1:30:08] have
[1:30:10] It'll be on the website there. There's a
[1:30:12] lot of pictures and stuff so we can post
[1:30:14] that. But Pastor Timothy Williams from
[1:30:17] Baltimore. Keep him in prayer in that
[1:30:19] church there. Remember brother James
[1:30:22] from Baltimore, good brother sings and
[1:30:25] then brother Timothy would come
[1:30:26] together. Yes. So you all know who he
[1:30:29] is. So this happened a couple of weeks
[1:30:31] ago and I fa to post that sent it again
[1:30:35] tonight. So we'll keep those requests in
[1:30:39] prayer. Yes, brother.
[1:31:07] Praise the Lord. Let's give the Lord
[1:31:09] hand of praise.
[1:31:12] Amen. Amen. See the the cloud like a
[1:31:16] man's hand. Not all the way. We're not
[1:31:18] all the way there, but we're certainly
[1:31:20] further than where she was before. So we
[1:31:23] just continue to pray for her sister.
[1:31:26] No. Okay. Just praising the Lord. Amen.
[1:31:29] Praise the Lord. So thank the Lord for
[1:31:32] his word tonight. May the Lord Jesus
[1:31:34] bless each of you. We have our youth
[1:31:36] meeting coming up this Friday. Uh the
[1:31:40] meetings in San Carlos. We want to pray
[1:31:41] for those. Um oh traveling to Africa,
[1:31:45] the Lord willing. Uh next Monday is when

[1:31:57] hear but um

[1:32:08] Church quite a trip for me. So I trust
[1:32:12] the Lord will bless the trip and this is
[1:32:16] not a trip that I just desire to go take
[1:32:19] pictures and so forth. Lord is
[1:32:21] on our heart this
[1:32:23] opportunity.
[1:32:26] So maybe seems like maybe a different
[1:32:29] time would have been better. But the
[1:32:32] Lord knows all things. So we have our
[1:32:35] concerns and our cares, little struggles
[1:32:38] and battles that we all have to go
[1:32:40] through and hear things and we just have
[1:32:43] to we just have to be faithful. And so
[1:32:46] that's what we want to do. And uh it's
[1:32:49] all in God's hands. Amen. And
[1:32:52] so the Holy Spirit is what we is is in
[1:32:56] charge of the church. He leads us and
[1:32:59] guides us by his holy spirit. So we
[1:33:02] trust in him. Amen. And so coveret your
[1:33:05] prayers. That'll be next Monday. I'll be
[1:33:08] gone for two weeks. We'll be well cared
[1:33:12] for. And I trust that you will pray for
[1:33:16] me. Amen. We'll keep that in prayer and

[1:50:25] to hear this positive report of Sister
[1:50:27] Lori. You know, you hear that and your
[1:50:29] heart and you just trust the Lord and we
[1:50:31] know where she would be, but her family
[1:50:33] needs her. We need her and believe we'll
[1:50:36] see her real soon.
[1:50:39] So, we'll just thank the Lord tonight.
[1:50:42] In moments like these, I sing out a love
[1:50:44] song to Jesus. Let's sing that together.

[1:54:19] time. Yes. In his
[1:54:26] time he makes all
[1:54:30] things
[1:54:33] beautiful in his time.
[1:54:36] [Music]
[1:54:41] God, show me every

[1:55:31] Lord, my life to you I
[1:55:36] bring. May each song I have to
[1:55:43] sing be to you a
[1:55:47] lovely
[1:55:49] thing in
[1:55:55] your Amen. I'm sure we get to be in
[1:55:58] church and go to the knee with each one
[1:56:00] of you. Maybe they could put those
[1:56:02] prayer requests back up there just as a
[1:56:04] reminder as we look up at those one more
[1:56:08] time and just run through for our
[1:56:10] complete recovery. We're believing for
[1:56:12] our sister Lorie Snow, for our precious
[1:56:14] brother Randy, for sister Heather's
[1:56:17] request, Sister Emma the Moors
[1:56:19] Traveling, Brother Timothy Williams
[1:56:21] Church, Brother Dave Cook Jr. don't have
[1:56:24] a report today, but I know he's real
[1:56:26] positive and just trusting in the Lord.
[1:56:27] We're going to trust the Lord with our
[1:56:29] precious brother in Canada, Sister
[1:56:31] Deborah McGinty. Is she still in the
[1:56:33] hospital? Uh, no. But we want to hold
[1:56:35] her up and u the battle that she's
[1:56:39] fighting. Sister Deborah McGinty, a
[1:56:41] Bible study on Friday, the San Carlos
[1:56:44] meetings with brother Will, uh,
[1:56:46] orchestrating, facilitating those with
[1:56:48] brother Daryl Ward and brother Nathaniel
[1:56:50] Barrett, I understand, will be speaking
[1:56:52] there. always remember our precious
[1:56:54] pastor and all the work that he does and
[1:56:57] and the the great work and I I give him
[1:57:02] I tease a little bit about I'm scared a
[1:57:03] little bit about that that long flight
[1:57:06] over across the seas but uh the Lord
[1:57:09] called him and he's going. I know each
[1:57:10] one of us would do that. We want to be
[1:57:12] in prayer for him in those meetings in
[1:57:14] Liberia. Anything else before we go
[1:57:18] saints? Then Sister Ellie, we've been
[1:57:20] missing her too. So, thank you, Sister
[1:57:22] Joy. We certainly want to hold her up.
[1:57:24] There's a few missing that we normally
[1:57:25] see. They're traveling, fighting some
[1:57:27] battle, or working or something. So, um,
[1:57:30] want to hold up each one of them. I want
[1:57:32] to do a hand clapping song. Nothing
[1:57:33] comes to mind. Um, the last page of the
[1:57:37] book has some good ones. We'll turn
[1:57:38] there unless someone has something else.
[1:57:43] Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good.
[1:57:45] Is that what she said? Okay, we could.
[1:57:47] That's a good one. We'd do that. He's
[1:57:48] been good to us, hasn't he?

[1:57:56] to

[1:59:32] the musicians play around, love it.

[2:00:54] uh sing? He knows my name.
[2:01:02] [Music]
[2:01:06] I have a
[2:01:12] maker. He's formed my
[2:01:19] heart. Before
[2:01:22] even time
[2:01:25] began, my life was
[2:01:29] in his
[2:01:34] hand. He knows my
[2:01:39] [Music]
[2:01:42] name. He knows my
[2:01:46] every thought.
[2:01:50] He sees each tear that
[2:01:55] falls and he hears me when I
[2:02:04] call. I have a
[2:02:11] father. He calls me his own.
[2:02:19] He'll
[2:02:20] never
[2:02:22] leave
[2:02:24] me no matter where I
[2:02:33] go. He
[2:02:35] knows my
[2:02:40] name. He knows my
[2:02:44] every thought.
[2:02:48] He sees each tear that
[2:02:53] fall and he hears me
[2:02:57] when I
[2:03:01] call. Dear
[2:03:05] Lord, you always hear us,
[2:03:09] Lord. And you see the tears, Lord, for
[2:03:13] our
[2:03:14] sister. Sister Snow, Lord Jesus.
[2:03:21] your true blessing, Lord. We can come to
[2:03:24] you, Lord, as a body of Christ,
[2:03:28] Lord, and ask you, Lord, for mercy,
[2:03:32] healing, Lord Jesus, and you'll hear us,
[2:03:35] Lord.
[2:03:38] We love you, Lord, and we thank you so
[2:03:42] much that you've chosen us, Lord. Given
[2:03:45] us this opportunity, Lord,
[2:03:48] to have the revealed word, Lord, in this
[2:03:52] day, Lord. What a blessing we have, Lord
[2:03:56] Jesus. To know the message is perfect
[2:03:59] and the word is perfect, Lord
[2:04:01] Jesus. What a what a gift that is, Lord
[2:04:06] Jesus. We thank you so
[2:04:08] much. And what a father we have, Lord. A
[2:04:13] maker,
[2:04:14] Lord. Thank you so much, Lord, for the
[2:04:18] healing you've done for our sister and
[2:04:21] comfort you bring into the family, Lord.
[2:04:23] The faith they have, Lord,
[2:04:26] just Lord, please continue,
[2:04:29] Lord. Thank you so much,
[2:04:32] Lord. We ask this all in Jesus Christ's
[2:04:35] name. Amen. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:04:39] Thank you, brother Chris. And all God's
[2:04:41] people say, "Amen." So be it. And
[2:04:43] there's a lot going on this week, a lot
[2:04:45] to participate in. If you can get up to
[2:04:46] the meetings in San Carlos, we sure want
[2:04:48] to be in prayer for those. It's a long
[2:04:50] drive. If we can't make it the Bible
[2:04:51] study, if you can't uh or are too old
[2:04:55] for the Bible study, you're welcome to
[2:04:56] join us at the home uh for a potluck on
[2:04:59] Friday night. Anything
[2:05:01] else? All right. You can be dismissed.
[2:05:03] We'll sing it as we go. Oh, he knows our
[2:05:05] name
[2:05:07] tonight. He knows my
[2:05:13] [Music]
[2:05:14] name. He knows my
[2:05:18] every
[2:05:22] thought. He sees each
[2:05:25] tear that falls and hears. Hears me when
[2:05:32] I call. I have a
[2:05:36] maker. I have a
[2:05:44] maker. He formed my
[2:05:47] [Music]
[2:05:51] heart. Before
[2:05:53] even time
[2:05:57] began, my life was in his hands.
[2:06:05] Oh, he knows my
[2:06:13] day. He knows my
[2:06:17] every
[2:06:20] thought. He sees each
[2:06:24] tear and
[2:06:26] falls and hears me
[2:06:29] when I call.
[2:06:32] [Music]
[2:07:13] Do it.
[2:07:31] Heat. Heat.
