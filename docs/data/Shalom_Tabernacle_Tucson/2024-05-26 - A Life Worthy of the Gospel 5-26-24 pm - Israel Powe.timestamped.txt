[45:47] someone someone normally will send me a
[45:49] text about that's not here they'll text
[45:52] and say my they were were they helping
[45:54] you out but they you know you Saints are
[45:56] there pooling I know that praise the
[45:59] Lord um so Matthew chapter 22 verse
[46:10] 8 this is portion of what we uh got into
[46:15] this
[46:16] morning brother random takes Luke
[46:18] chapter 14 and he reads that completely
[46:22] and we read a portion of it this morning
[46:24] we're going to take Matthew chapter 22
[46:28] two the kingdom verse two the Kingdom of
[46:30] Heaven is like a certain King which made
[46:32] a marriage for his son he sent forth his
[46:35] servants to call them that were bidden
[46:37] to the wedding and they would not come
[46:40] again he sent forth other servants
[46:42] saying tell them which are bidden behold
[46:45] I have prepared my dinner my oxen my
[46:47] fatales and killed and all things my
[46:51] fatling are killed and all things are
[46:54] ready come unto the marriage but they
[46:56] made light of it went their ways one to
[46:59] his farm another to his merchandise and
[47:02] the remnant took his servants and in
[47:04] treated them spitefully and slew them
[47:07] but when the king heard thereof he was
[47:09] wroth he sent forth his armies and
[47:12] destroyed those murderers burned up
[47:15] their City then said he to his servants
[47:18] the wedding is ready but they which were
[47:22] bidden were not worthy go ye therefore
[47:27] into the highways and as many as ye
[47:30] shall find bid to the marriage that's
[47:34] where we are today going into the
[47:36] highways let's pray Lord Jesus we ask
[47:38] your blessings upon this
[47:41] service committed into your hands now
[47:43] the reading of your word we thank you
[47:46] for the songs that have gone forth Lord
[47:49] we ask your blessings now your presence
[47:52] to come the angel of the Lord to
[47:55] accompany each belever believer to give
[47:58] them what they have need of spiritually
[48:01] we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you
[48:05] you may be seated A Life That's worthy
[48:07] of the Gospel the title of the message
[48:10] tonight A Life That's worthy of the
[48:12] gospel God bless you Sister hope good to
[48:14] see you and each of you God bless each
[48:17] of your life that's worthy of the Gospel
[48:21] now what brother bam does is he uh is
[48:25] taking his
[48:28] text from Matthew chapter 22 but he
[48:32] reads Luke chapter 14 in reference to
[48:37] this and I just pray you'll just hang
[48:40] right with me tonight and uh stay with
[48:43] me on this just for a few moments but
[48:46] there's these two um recordings of this
[48:50] marriage
[48:51] invitation now the reason I believe he
[48:53] uses these two he's he's reading from
[48:57] Luke but his title really comes out of
[49:00] Matthew chapter 22 that we read here
[49:03] tonight the wedding is ready but they
[49:06] which were bidden were not worthy and if
[49:10] you take your Bibles and turn into Luke
[49:13] Chapter uh 14 just for a
[49:16] moment and actually it's in the message
[49:18] is your life worthy of the Gospel
[49:20] paragraph number 31 brother randomist
[49:23] says now turn in your Bibles to the book
[49:25] of St Luke
[49:27] and we'll start at the 14th
[49:29] chapter and he goes down there and it
[49:32] says there and so the servant came and
[49:35] showed his Lord all these things then
[49:39] the master of the house being angry said
[49:42] to his servant notice it's not servants
[49:47] servant so brother Brandon brings out he
[49:50] takes the pl plurality of servants and
[49:54] he notes the scripture that it says
[49:57] servant
[49:59] singular and I think he does that for a
[50:02] purpose and that's where you can read in
[50:04] between the lines
[50:06] okay and so there's many of those places
[50:09] like that I can't tell you what it means
[50:11] but I know that he noted that and he
[50:14] continues on in paragraph number 32 and
[50:17] he says this here now did you notice
[50:21] there was three pools or three turns of
[50:24] it when they went out first and and
[50:28] called them or bidden to come they
[50:31] didn't do it so there went out a healing
[50:33] campaign went out to get the Blind and
[50:36] the Halt and still there were room so he
[50:39] went out and compelled the good bad and
[50:42] indifferent they should come in so The
[50:45] Good the Bad and indifferent were sent
[50:47] out under the third pool the third call
[50:52] brother Brandon brings it out takes this
[50:54] scripture and brings out the three pulls
[50:57] he goes a little bit further and this
[51:00] life is your life worthy of the gospel
[51:02] and says this in paragraph number
[51:05] 309 praise the Lord now him speaking
[51:09] directly to Israel the ones that was
[51:12] called To The Feast no I'm sorry you
[51:16] see let's see
[51:22] uh paragraph 51
[51:25] sorry he says
[51:28] he bid three times three times he sent
[51:33] out and they did not listen to The Feast
[51:36] then he sent out again and he said go
[51:39] and compel those people to come the
[51:41] table has got to be set the table is
[51:44] ready there is still room so we know
[51:48] when we talking about the first second
[51:50] and third polls we know that's
[51:53] directly uh brother Brandon's Ministry
[51:55] how many knows that now I can't preach
[51:58] this in the Baptist Church and I've
[52:01] spoken for them a number of times and
[52:03] the Pentecostal denominational churches
[52:06] they wouldn't know what I was talking
[52:07] about for me to say first pool second
[52:10] pull third pool but those of us who
[52:12] follow the message know what that
[52:15] is and um and so let's touch that just a
[52:20] little bit and then we'll get into um
[52:23] this life that is worthy of the gospel
[52:27] now just a little background on the
[52:30] third
[52:31] pull it is first brought up in the
[52:36] message now for us who follow the
[52:38] message the third pull was first given
[52:41] in
[52:42] 1956 January the 1 in the message why
[52:46] people are so tossed
[52:48] about and then the last time that he SP
[52:51] he speaks about it is in
[52:54] 1965 I believe it's what is the
[52:56] attraction on the mountain so this is 8
[52:59] years 7 months8 and a half years portion
[53:03] of time that brother Ram is referring to
[53:07] the third pool and here this scripture
[53:11] the New
[53:12] Testament um a parable that Matthew
[53:16] records and also Luke Rec records
[53:19] brother Brandon brings that in a type
[53:21] now and shows us that there were three
[53:24] calls or three pulls
[53:27] that Israel the nation of Israel was
[53:30] bidden to come to a spiritual feast and
[53:33] then he fast forwards it over into
[53:37] history not just Israel he includes
[53:40] Russia he includes England and he
[53:43] includes America right in this message
[53:46] is your life worthy of the Gospel
[53:47] beautiful message go back and read it
[53:49] what it does is it takes these new
[53:52] testament Parables and brings them the
[53:55] life to present day truth if you follow
[53:58] the message and believe the message if
[54:00] you believe brother bam message is true
[54:03] then these Parables how he opens or
[54:06] reveals them that's what a prophet does
[54:09] he's a revealer of the word and brings
[54:12] out the spiritual application of that
[54:15] Parable it's not just for Israel it
[54:18] meant for Israel yes then he brings out
[54:20] that it was to
[54:22] Russia and then he talked about England
[54:26] and then he says America and those three
[54:29] nations all rejected the spiritual feast
[54:33] or the call to come to this feast and in
[54:37] rejecting that they all end up in
[54:40] ruins the mo morality speaking moral
[54:44] wise this is the answer as to why the
[54:48] people have lost their minds morally
[54:51] speaking today not just you know not
[54:55] just a man is weak or a woman is weak
[54:58] and they live under the lust of the
[55:00] flesh but we're talking about lawmakers
[55:03] we're talking about college degrees
[55:05] educated people Leaders with a direct
[55:09] agenda trying to pour this down the
[55:14] people of this nation and make it force
[55:18] it upon us and this is a reality that we
[55:21] have to deal with and there's a reason
[55:23] for that and the reason for it is that
[55:25] they have rejected did the spiritual
[55:27] Feast that they was brought to this
[55:30] spiritual Feast is the feast that you
[55:33] and I have been called
[55:35] to that's why we're so fat spiritually
[55:39] speaking all fat and buttered up
[55:43] spiritually speaking because we've been
[55:45] eating on the fruits of canaan's land
[55:48] glory amen we can't walk around here all
[55:51] starved our rib cage showing spiritually
[55:55] like we ain't got nothing to eat
[55:57] we're solid we thank God for it our
[56:00] praise and worship service we don't have
[56:03] a piano we don't have an organ we still
[56:05] know how to praise the Lord don't we
[56:07] some people get mad they leave we still
[56:09] keep going on don't we why is it because
[56:12] we're better than someone else no it's
[56:15] the feast that we've been called to it
[56:18] makes us different we praise different
[56:22] we worship different we read our Bible
[56:26] on purpose we read it differently and we
[56:29] are grateful and we're thankful for it
[56:31] aren't you now look at it like that we
[56:34] have been called to a spiritual Feast
[56:38] now brother brandom talks about this
[56:41] third pool and we'll uh just bring it in
[56:45] just slowly and quickly at the same time
[56:49] all right let's look at the third pool
[56:52] as a spiritual Feast let's look at it as
[56:55] the promise
[56:56] land as the Old Testament Hebrews come
[56:59] out of Israel they come out of Egypt
[57:02] Israel came out of Egypt going to this
[57:05] promised land they had something to look
[57:06] forward to these were promises that were
[57:10] given Israel No Other Nation had it they
[57:14] didn't have those things to look forward
[57:17] to a pillar of fire something leading
[57:19] them at nighttime Mana coming down from
[57:23] heaven quailes just showing up out of
[57:25] nowhere
[57:26] who what other Nation had that going on
[57:29] the people that was following the
[57:31] prophet Moses had all these Supernatural
[57:35] things taking place in their life they
[57:37] wasn't worthy of it but God gave it to
[57:39] them anyway amen and that promised land
[57:43] is a promise so September of
[57:47] 1962 brother vam takes the message
[57:50] entitles it the present stage of my
[57:53] Ministry and this is what he says in par
[57:56] number 16 and remember this is
[57:58] 1962 he had already talked about what
[58:01] the third pool Vision was in
[58:05] 1956 okay so here's 62 and he says this
[58:09] here and so far as I know that every
[58:13] Vision that he's ever given me has been
[58:15] fulfilled except the one that I'm a
[58:18] change in my Ministry to where I'm to
[58:21] pray for people in a little place like a
[58:23] little room under a tent
[58:26] hallelujah or a big Auditorium or
[58:29] something it looked to me like a tent
[58:33] you remember don't let nobody tell you
[58:34] something else now he said it looked to
[58:36] me like a tent remember that two or
[58:39] three years ago most all of it was
[58:42] brought to pass I was to go down into
[58:45] Mexico and how it would rain that night
[58:47] and what would take place down there and
[58:50] he told me my Ministry of the first pool
[58:53] remember about catching the little bitty
[58:55] fish or missing it second one was a
[58:57] smallfish but then he told me on the
[58:59] third pool don't fail see and don't tell
[59:04] people so these Visions continue on and
[59:09] then a year later 1963 at the end of the
[59:12] year he had already preached the seals
[59:15] Angel of the Lord accompanied him with
[59:18] all the happenings in saino Canyon
[59:21] sunset Mountain and the commission to go
[59:24] back and bring forth the the greatest
[59:27] the greatest uh Ministry the greatest
[59:30] message of his ministry was bringing
[59:32] those Seven Seals here he is at the end
[59:35] of that year in the message Look Away to
[59:37] Jesus December and he says this here I
[59:41] have come to a place in my Ministry to
[59:44] where I've got to say
[59:46] something and
[59:48] I Jesus said it that what he heard that
[59:54] was what he spoke he Saidi called you my
[59:57] friends and a friend tells his friends
[1:00:01] all things so brother Ram is now
[1:00:04] continuing on in this message in
[1:00:05] paragraph 38 and he says this here and
[1:00:08] this is rather lengthly I just want you
[1:00:09] to get it though and he says so now I'm
[1:00:12] going to say something to you now that I
[1:00:15] haven't said all along and that is the
[1:00:18] thing that we've looked for to for so
[1:00:21] long for at least many years four or
[1:00:23] five years maybe longer the third pull
[1:00:25] has now been
[1:00:27] Vindicated and I'm sure you all know
[1:00:29] what it is now remember there'll never
[1:00:33] be an impersonation of
[1:00:36] that
[1:00:38] Hallelujah that's a amen point for
[1:00:40] everybody I'm like thank you Lord
[1:00:43] because the prophet somebody say well
[1:00:44] this is the third pool that's the third
[1:00:46] pool if it ain't the prophet if it ain't
[1:00:48] a quotation from the prophet then who's
[1:00:52] talking where' it come from who's
[1:00:55] speaking the prophet said there will
[1:00:57] never be an in an impersonation of that
[1:01:02] huh yes sir yes so nice because it can't
[1:01:07] be see it cannot be now it's in
[1:01:11] existence and I I am warned of this that
[1:01:14] soon right at this time now it's just
[1:01:17] happened so it could identify its
[1:01:19] presence among you see but it will not
[1:01:22] be used in a great way until this
[1:01:26] Council begins to tighten
[1:01:29] up and when it does when that does the
[1:01:32] Pentecostals and so forth can almost
[1:01:35] impersonate anything can be done but
[1:01:38] when that time comes when the squeeze
[1:01:41] comes down then you'll see what you've
[1:01:43] seen
[1:01:45] temporarily be manifested in the
[1:01:48] fullness of his power see see you know
[1:01:51] let me say this Saints I have to be now
[1:01:54] when I listen to this Look Away to Jesus
[1:01:57] and I hear that I've got to be
[1:01:59] responsible and relay that to the people
[1:02:02] that I'm preaching to now in in
[1:02:05] listening to any preacher or any news
[1:02:08] broadcast or whoever you feed or
[1:02:10] whatever you feed upon on it's not just
[1:02:13] the things that they are telling you
[1:02:17] it's the things they are not telling
[1:02:23] you exactly right yes the things that
[1:02:26] are covered up and hidden on purpose
[1:02:29] like brother why didn't you read I was
[1:02:31] listening to this message and I'm going
[1:02:33] to get to where I'm going I was
[1:02:35] listening to this message here just from
[1:02:37] this group they sent out this text this
[1:02:39] link and they they put in part of the
[1:02:42] quote and thank God I had been listening
[1:02:45] to the message myself I had studied
[1:02:47] through it and I thought man that quote
[1:02:50] it didn't seem like it finished just
[1:02:52] right so I I logged on and got into the
[1:02:55] message myself and sure enough they got
[1:02:58] most of the quote but they cut it off on
[1:03:01] purpose and then bring in the full
[1:03:04] balance of the
[1:03:06] quotes now who's doing that who's in
[1:03:10] charge of doing a thing like that who's
[1:03:13] got a problem with reading all the
[1:03:16] quotes a true Minister a true Pastor a
[1:03:19] true brother Christian wants to hear
[1:03:22] everything he said about it am I right
[1:03:25] about it saying
[1:03:26] am everything he says about it it should
[1:03:29] be valid and for us to to go forward and
[1:03:33] so he continues here and he says now I
[1:03:36] must continue in evangelism just as I
[1:03:39] was commissioned first I must continue
[1:03:41] on therefore you've had the word you
[1:03:44] know what to look for how to stand I
[1:03:48] must continue on in evangelism and
[1:03:50] friends of mine keep still and just keep
[1:03:53] moving on for the power is approaching
[1:03:57] swiftly see that when something is going
[1:04:00] to be done now you might see some little
[1:04:02] odd things happen for for me nothing
[1:04:05] sinful I don't mean that but I mean
[1:04:08] something odd to what the regular Trend
[1:04:11] because where I reach to now in the
[1:04:12] ministry I'm dropping back here watching
[1:04:16] that spot and waiting for the time to
[1:04:20] use it but it's going to be used
[1:04:27] and everyone knows that for as certain
[1:04:30] as the first was identified so as the
[1:04:33] second been identified and if you think
[1:04:36] real closely you who are spiritual as
[1:04:39] the Bible says here's to him that has
[1:04:41] wisdom the third is properly identified
[1:04:45] we know where it is so the third pool is
[1:04:51] here it's so sacred that I mustn't say
[1:04:54] much about it as he told me in the
[1:04:56] beginning said said this say nothing of
[1:04:59] it you remember that years ago it speaks
[1:05:02] for itself I've tried to explain the
[1:05:05] others and I made a mistake this will be
[1:05:08] the thing that to my opinion I don't say
[1:05:11] the Lord tells me this this will be the
[1:05:13] thing that will start the rapturing
[1:05:16] faith for the going
[1:05:18] away I must lay quiet for just a little
[1:05:21] while now remember and you listening to
[1:05:25] this t you might see such a change in my
[1:05:27] ministry right now dropping back not
[1:05:30] going up dropping back we're right at
[1:05:33] the age now and it can't be can't go any
[1:05:37] further we have to wait just a minute
[1:05:40] until this happens over here to catch up
[1:05:44] then the time comes but it's thoroughly
[1:05:48] identified there is coming a Time upon
[1:05:53] in this nation to where this nation is
[1:05:56] going to exercise all the power that the
[1:05:59] Beast had before it which was Pagan Rome
[1:06:02] when it become Papa roome see that this
[1:06:06] nation will do that Revelations 13
[1:06:10] plainly explains it the lamb will come
[1:06:13] up out of the Earth the other beasts
[1:06:15] come out of the water thickness
[1:06:17] multitudes of people this lamb come up
[1:06:20] where there was no people a lamb
[1:06:22] represents religion the Lamb of God
[1:06:25] remember it spoke like a lamb it was a
[1:06:27] lamb then after a while received power
[1:06:30] and spoke like a dragon and exercised
[1:06:33] the dragon power the dragon had power
[1:06:37] the dragon had before him and the dragon
[1:06:40] is Rome always so don't you see Roman
[1:06:44] denomination a mark Protestant
[1:06:48] denomination an image unto the beast
[1:06:51] making a power that will force all
[1:06:54] Protestants
[1:06:55] like a union you have to be in this
[1:06:58] Council of churches or you won't be able
[1:07:01] to have Fellowship amen well it's
[1:07:04] practically that way now how many can
[1:07:07] say Amen to that oh yeah it's czy you
[1:07:10] can't go to church and preach unless you
[1:07:13] have a fellowship card or some
[1:07:17] identification now on persones like
[1:07:19] ourselves we're going to be cut out all
[1:07:21] of that all together that's exactly
[1:07:24] because they won't be able to do it it's
[1:07:29] tightening and then when that time comes
[1:07:32] and the Press comes to a place where
[1:07:34] you're pressed out then watch what I'm
[1:07:36] fixing to tell you in a few minutes
[1:07:39] watch the third pull then see and it'll
[1:07:44] be absolutely to the total loss but it
[1:07:47] will be for the bride and the
[1:07:51] church now we are closer yes than seems
[1:07:56] to be I don't know when but it's real
[1:07:59] real
[1:08:01] close I may be building a platform for
[1:08:04] somebody else to step on I may be taken
[1:08:07] before that time I don't know and that
[1:08:10] time may be this coming week the holy
[1:08:12] spirit will come and bring Christ Jesus
[1:08:16] he may come this next week he may come
[1:08:18] yet tonight I don't know when he'll come
[1:08:21] he doesn't tell us that but I do believe
[1:08:24] that we are so close that I would never
[1:08:27] die with old age yet at 54 years old
[1:08:31] I'll never die with old age until he's
[1:08:34] here see unless I'm shot killed or some
[1:08:38] other someway killed just old age
[1:08:42] wouldn't kill me how many you know old
[1:08:43] age did not kill
[1:08:45] him all right let the word preach just
[1:08:48] old age wouldn't kill me until he comes
[1:08:52] and I'll believe that I I want to say
[1:08:56] this I've never said it before but
[1:08:59] according to the scripture according to
[1:09:01] what he said 33 years ago 33 years ago
[1:09:04] on the river down there in 1933 rather
[1:09:07] what he said everything has happened
[1:09:10] just
[1:09:11] exactly I may not do it but this message
[1:09:16] will
[1:09:17] introduce Jesus Christ to the world so I
[1:09:23] thought oh my I'm so happy right now I
[1:09:27] thought I thought when I thought we need
[1:09:29] to stop preaching the message and start
[1:09:31] preaching
[1:09:32] Jesus this message is what's going to
[1:09:37] introduce who Jesus Christ is see don't
[1:09:42] let nobody fool you Saints and don't get
[1:09:44] your eyes off the prize and don't let
[1:09:47] people change the rules to the game The
[1:09:50] Prophet brings the Mysteries and the
[1:09:53] pastors preachers teachers evangelist
[1:09:56] everybody else are supposed to repeat
[1:09:59] what he already brought us so I'm not
[1:10:02] ashamed of that and I Know It carves us
[1:10:05] out into a corner now because it's
[1:10:08] becoming more and more popular to
[1:10:11] disassociate yourself with these kind of
[1:10:14] statements but I'm not ashamed of it
[1:10:17] actually I thank God for them because
[1:10:22] God recorded it on purpose
[1:10:25] and this identifies who really believes
[1:10:29] every
[1:10:31] word
[1:10:34] amen every word the True Believer
[1:10:38] believes
[1:10:39] that and as it t get on and get more
[1:10:43] it's going to tighten even further it's
[1:10:45] going to squeeze us out even further but
[1:10:48] these are the things that prepare our
[1:10:52] hearts for the Rapture and the coming of
[1:10:55] the lord it's going to happen there will
[1:10:59] be a third pool
[1:11:01] manifestation he said so
[1:11:05] amen I know it will the message
[1:11:08] will he says I but this message will
[1:11:11] introduce Jesus Christ to the world as
[1:11:14] John the Baptist was sent to forun the
[1:11:16] first coming so is the message to
[1:11:19] forerun the second coming and John said
[1:11:23] Behold the Lamb of God that takes with
[1:11:25] the sin of the world see so it's
[1:11:28] paralleled in every way and I know it
[1:11:31] will the message will go
[1:11:36] on
[1:11:37] now in this
[1:11:39] message is your life worthy of the
[1:11:42] Gospel brother branon makes this
[1:11:43] statement in there and I never caught it
[1:11:46] I heard the message several times but
[1:11:48] brother Jim Dalton we were
[1:11:50] fellowshipping one day and he started
[1:11:52] quoting some things out of this message
[1:11:54] pastor Pastor Dalton up in
[1:11:57] flagy and he made the statement because
[1:11:59] brother man was talking about that life
[1:12:01] is not worthy of the Gospel a pastor
[1:12:03] that would not preach on these things
[1:12:05] that life is not worthy of the gospel
[1:12:08] and then brother Dalton says in he also
[1:12:11] says people that put up with it their
[1:12:14] life is not worthy of the Gospel I said
[1:12:16] whoa I never heard that but then I I
[1:12:18] went through the message uh sometime
[1:12:20] later and I've always highlighted it
[1:12:23] because it really stood out to me
[1:12:26] and the prophet of God is dealing with
[1:12:32] this and I'll just pick it up in
[1:12:34] paragraph 189 and he says this here are
[1:12:36] you blessed paragraph 189 he says this
[1:12:41] here is your life worthy of the Gospel
[1:12:44] beautiful message go back and hear it go
[1:12:46] read it listen to it digest it become
[1:12:50] one with it inhale it Hallelujah breathe
[1:12:53] it in that's what my had a uh uh he
[1:12:56] taught algebra Iranian guy or Arabic guy
[1:13:00] says you need to go ingustice and inhale
[1:13:02] it and internalize it breathe it make it
[1:13:06] become your breath I'm like I can't get
[1:13:08] the equation you need to eat it he tell
[1:13:11] me ingest it and make it become part of
[1:13:14] your life we talking about a math
[1:13:16] equation that's what he was talking
[1:13:18] about that's what I'm telling you to do
[1:13:20] with this message all right all right
[1:13:25] paragraph 189 the people of this day are
[1:13:27] a bunch of
[1:13:28] neurotics the people of this day are a
[1:13:32] bunch of neurotics they are afraid to
[1:13:35] take the promises of God churchmen
[1:13:39] Church organizations Church
[1:13:41] organizations are afraid to take the
[1:13:44] challenge of God's scripture for this
[1:13:46] day they realize they realize that their
[1:13:50] modern condition and their social gospel
[1:13:52] that they preach will not meet the
[1:13:55] challenge of this hour no more than
[1:13:58] Samson could meet it in his condition it
[1:14:00] took God and here is the program that
[1:14:05] promised it I'll get to it in just a
[1:14:09] moment paragraph
[1:14:11] 192 though they call themselves
[1:14:14] Christians they love to hold to the
[1:14:17] Creeds their Creeds all the Creeds
[1:14:22] institutes institutes and fulfills the
[1:14:25] thinking of the modern people of this
[1:14:26] day and a man that's going to be a
[1:14:29] success in this day has to go with the
[1:14:34] Modern Trend of
[1:14:36] thinking let me say that good and clear
[1:14:41] see a man if you're going to be a
[1:14:44] success you have to go with the modern
[1:14:47] thinking of this day they go around and
[1:14:50] say oh isn't he a darling isn't he
[1:14:54] wonderful
[1:14:55] he can just stay there so straight he
[1:14:58] never keeps us over 15 minutes and our
[1:15:01] pastor don't always ball us out about
[1:15:04] these things shame on that Pastor any
[1:15:08] man that can stand in the pull pit and
[1:15:10] look upon the sin of this day and not
[1:15:12] cry out there is something wrong with
[1:15:15] that man he's not worthy of the Gospel
[1:15:18] that he claims to be preaching that's
[1:15:21] right so by doing so they make
[1:15:23] themselves excuses
[1:15:25] now brother banam says that to be
[1:15:28] successful today you got to go with the
[1:15:31] Modern Trend of today so it's like
[1:15:34] pastors following other pastors churches
[1:15:37] following other churches and trends of
[1:15:40] what's the popular thing to do if you
[1:15:42] want to be successful quote unquote what
[1:15:45] they call successful but I thank God
[1:15:48] he's given us a message and he's given
[1:15:51] us a Divine call and he called us to to
[1:15:55] be a faithful servant to that
[1:15:59] calling and it might not be the most
[1:16:02] popular as we said before you know
[1:16:05] brother Brandon preached the message
[1:16:07] very clearly very open and it was very
[1:16:12] Unapologetic he wasn't rude or arrogant
[1:16:15] but you knew where he stood and nobody
[1:16:18] else is preaching it nobody else is
[1:16:19] taking that stand but he had to take
[1:16:22] that stand so you and I can have a clear
[1:16:24] clean message to preach on tonight and I
[1:16:27] thank God for it and that's what we're
[1:16:30] doing tonight
[1:16:32] amen oh my let's go a little bit further
[1:16:34] so he says shame on that Pastor he
[1:16:37] continues on and paragraph
[1:16:39] 194 said you see my denomination won't
[1:16:42] stand for that that's just as much a
[1:16:45] much as excuse I married a wife I
[1:16:48] brought a yok of box I don't care how
[1:16:49] many Doctor degrees you got and how much
[1:16:52] you looked up to by your nomination that
[1:16:55] sort of ministry it's not worthy of the
[1:16:58] Gospel that's wrote in this book right
[1:17:01] any church member here it is that asside
[1:17:06] in with such stuff as that and call
[1:17:09] themselves a Christian and go out here
[1:17:12] and live and the women bobbing their
[1:17:14] hair and wearing clothes that the Bible
[1:17:16] says for them not to men carrying on the
[1:17:19] way they're doing now a a form of
[1:17:22] godliness taking drinks and smoking
[1:17:25] cigars and marrying several times and
[1:17:29] becoming deacons of the church and even
[1:17:31] pastors and so forth and the people that
[1:17:35] put up with such as that that sort of
[1:17:38] life is not worthy of the
[1:17:45] Gospel it's pretty strong when you
[1:17:48] saying doesn't put it on the preacher it
[1:17:50] puts it on the people too that you allow
[1:17:53] it you put up with with
[1:17:55] it
[1:17:58] amen
[1:18:02] amen yes we want to take these things
[1:18:05] more serious than we do because we know
[1:18:07] we're at the end time we see the squeeze
[1:18:09] out there we see the laws changing
[1:18:11] before our eyes just the common attitude
[1:18:15] of of things that are decent and holy is
[1:18:18] just really squeezing us out the clean
[1:18:20] voices can't speak anymore and and and
[1:18:24] it's become harder to even just
[1:18:26] articulate these things even even
[1:18:30] amongst message people now becoming
[1:18:33] harder and the Bible said it would be
[1:18:35] that way but we want to be faithful
[1:18:37] don't we we wantan to we want our life
[1:18:40] to be worthy see God sent us something
[1:18:43] that nobody else has there there's no
[1:18:46] other message like this message nowhere
[1:18:49] they've tried to replicate they triy to
[1:18:51] impersonate they try to do whatever they
[1:18:53] can do there ain't nobody preaching a
[1:18:55] word like what we have on a recorded
[1:18:58] tape you could say he's dead you could
[1:19:00] say that old man is dead and that was
[1:19:03] years and years ago there is nobody
[1:19:05] preaching nothing that can compare to
[1:19:09] the
[1:19:10] message
[1:19:11] Glory from 1940s 50s 60s still there is
[1:19:17] no Ministry to
[1:19:20] compare to the Mysteries the signs the
[1:19:23] Wonders and the Miracles
[1:19:25] and then the devil would want me to be
[1:19:27] ashamed of that
[1:19:30] no this is my
[1:19:33] identification that's why I got a
[1:19:36] ministry that's why I'm in the
[1:19:38] lifeline is because of a message like
[1:19:42] this we're not ashamed of the
[1:19:46] Gospel
[1:19:47] no that's what's going to catch us up
[1:19:50] out of here that's our Rapture out of
[1:19:53] here the body change is in there the new
[1:19:57] name is in there the Capstone the
[1:20:00] ceiling is all in there rapturing Faith
[1:20:05] lays right in
[1:20:07] there come on
[1:20:09] Saints we're
[1:20:12] noten we're not ashamed of this
[1:20:15] gospel
[1:20:17] amen the modern churches do whatever
[1:20:19] they want to do yes sir we've been
[1:20:21] called to a spiritual Feast amen a third
[1:20:26] pool
[1:20:28] Feast
[1:20:30] yes that's why we act the way we
[1:20:34] act right
[1:20:39] now the call was to the compel to the
[1:20:42] hedges and highways that was the third
[1:20:43] pull first the first call was to come
[1:20:47] cuz all things are
[1:20:49] ready the second call was to get the
[1:20:51] poor the blind the Halt and there was a
[1:20:54] healing
[1:20:56] campaign the third was to the hedges and
[1:21:00] the
[1:21:01] highways just get anybody that will
[1:21:05] listen if it's a alley
[1:21:08] rat if it's a night rocker somebody you
[1:21:11] don't think is worthy bring it to them
[1:21:14] they might say Amen to it you did you
[1:21:20] said amen to it and that's the last call
[1:21:23] that's it
[1:21:25] that's it the the other groups it wasn't
[1:21:27] worthy they don't want it they don't
[1:21:29] care about it but I'm so glad that that
[1:21:33] bridegroom call came to the city of
[1:21:36] Sacramento one day found me on the South
[1:21:41] Side voiced itself to me and I accepted
[1:21:44] it with all of my heart and I thank God
[1:21:48] for it maybe there's one
[1:21:51] more out there in them Hedges and
[1:21:53] highways
[1:21:55] trailer park and those in the seven
[1:21:56] whatever neighborhood they in Rolling
[1:21:59] dice at the park wherever they doing go
[1:22:01] find them drop this message they ain't
[1:22:05] never seen or heard nothing like it drop
[1:22:08] this message on them and see what
[1:22:13] happens

[1:22:17] name remember that Saints no one has
[1:22:20] what we have I saying that boastfully
[1:22:23] that's just a matter of fact no one has
[1:22:25] what we
[1:22:27] have we have the
[1:22:29] truth and we know the neonics are on the
[1:22:34] rise and we know this nation's going to
[1:22:37] turn and we know there'll be a great
[1:22:39] squeeze it's already happening now and
[1:22:42] the great Council of churches will turn
[1:22:46] on the people that believe these
[1:22:49] things but we know where to
[1:22:51] stand we know what to look for
[1:22:55] That's A Life That's worthy of the
[1:22:56] Gospel now let me close by saying this
[1:22:59] how do you get this life in
[1:23:02] you the only
[1:23:04] way that you
[1:23:06] can live a life that's worthy of the
[1:23:14] Gospel is to let the gospel itself come
[1:23:18] in you
[1:23:20] amen and that is this gospel that we're
[1:23:24] preaching and teaching to you we're
[1:23:26] talking
[1:23:27] about this bridegroom call that a
[1:23:31] serpent was sent out remember many are
[1:23:34] called but few are
[1:23:38] chosen and we have been called and
[1:23:41] chosen now in paragraph 264 the prophet
[1:23:45] of God says this
[1:23:46] here now the only way to live a life
[1:23:49] Worthy is to let Christ and his word
[1:23:53] which he is the word word reflect itself
[1:23:55] so perfect in you till God vindicates
[1:23:59] what he said in the word for Christ died
[1:24:03] that he might present himself before God
[1:24:06] a sacrifice and a return back in the
[1:24:08] form of the Holy Spirit to reflect him
[1:24:11] himself through his people to carry on
[1:24:15] his work reflecting himself through you
[1:24:19] to fulfill his promised word in these
[1:24:22] Future Days that's in the message is
[1:24:23] your life worthy of the Gospel okay
[1:24:26] let's take a scripture here quickly and
[1:24:28] we'll get that one more one more time
[1:24:30] here just before we close
[1:24:33] now just back to
[1:24:36] this this third
[1:24:39] pool oh my how did I do
[1:24:41] that back to this third
[1:24:45] pool
[1:24:46] now brother bandam asked this question
[1:24:50] and souls that are in prison now
[1:24:52] paragraph number 310 in and he says this
[1:24:57] if the first and second pool is without
[1:25:02] question is there a question in your
[1:25:04] mind about the first and second
[1:25:07] pool
[1:25:09] huh no questions right we know what it
[1:25:11] is did it come to pass just like he said
[1:25:14] I'm reading congregation says amen amen
[1:25:18] then why question the third well because
[1:25:22] Reverend so and so said it don't mean
[1:25:24] that
[1:25:25] Pastor Soo said this is what it means
[1:25:27] today somebody said we've turned the
[1:25:31] corner somebody said you know this is
[1:25:33] what we doing this is how we church now
[1:25:36] we don't even go to church we stay home
[1:25:39] and if we do go we can't say you know
[1:25:42] nothing about the prophet thank you son
[1:25:45] amen and if we do go we just got to talk
[1:25:50] about
[1:25:52] Jesus because if we start talking about
[1:25:54] brother bandam you're going to confuse
[1:25:56] people guess what they already confused
[1:25:59] everybody's confused you start talking
[1:26:02] about the message that's where the
[1:26:04] confusion
[1:26:06] leaves it's called a
[1:26:09] revelation a revelation removes the
[1:26:13] confusion and you need a revelation of
[1:26:15] what's going on today what's going on
[1:26:17] today Hallelujah a shout a voice a trump
[1:26:22] of God Jesus does all
[1:26:25] three it's the
[1:26:27] Rapture yes a shout a voice what's the
[1:26:31] shout the message Gathering the people
[1:26:37] together how you going to get in the
[1:26:39] Rapture if you miss the
[1:26:41] shout how you gonna get the voice if you
[1:26:44] miss the
[1:26:45] shout how you gonna get in the Rapture
[1:26:47] if you miss the great Archangel that was
[1:26:49] to come
[1:26:54] they try to make us be ashamed of that
[1:26:56] brother Ezekiel but no no we're not
[1:27:00] ashamed of it we're embracing it more
[1:27:03] reading more
[1:27:07] quotes brother brandom said I'm saying
[1:27:09] that more than never before brother you
[1:27:12] got stop saying no no no no you have
[1:27:15] your ministry I have mine I'm going to
[1:27:18] say brother Brandon said amen say the
[1:27:22] Apostle Paul said it
[1:27:25] Moses said it it's written in the Psalms
[1:27:28] David said it Jesus quoted the prophets
[1:27:32] all of the prophets quoted the other
[1:27:34] prophets and if you got a Ministry you
[1:27:36] hopefully you're quoting some kind of
[1:27:38] prophet amen amen all right let me move
[1:27:43] forward 2 Corinthians 11:13 and 15 the
[1:27:47] Bible says this gives us warning this is
[1:27:49] the Apostle Paul on Wednesday I brought
[1:27:51] to you 1 Timothy 4 about the doctrine of
[1:27:54] Devils but 2 Corinthians 11135 says for
[1:27:57] such are
[1:28:00] what is it we we'll get it up there for
[1:28:03] such are
[1:28:05] what so we have Apostles that are false
[1:28:09] amen
[1:28:11] yes Paul identifies them for such are
[1:28:15] false Apostles deceitful workers
[1:28:20] transforming themselves into the
[1:28:22] Apostles of Christ
[1:28:25] and no Marvel for Satan himself is
[1:28:28] transformed into an angel of Light
[1:28:32] therefore it is no great thing if his
[1:28:37] ministers also be transferred as the
[1:28:41] Ministers of righteousness who in shall
[1:28:44] be according to their Works amen now we
[1:28:49] know that the first pull second pool is
[1:28:51] without
[1:28:52] question and
[1:28:55] let's take this in souls in prison now
[1:28:57] brother banam says this if the first and
[1:29:00] second pool is without
[1:29:03] question is there a question in your
[1:29:06] mind about the first and second pool did
[1:29:09] it come to pass just like he
[1:29:12] said amen then why question the third
[1:29:16] see why would you question it the first
[1:29:19] two was identified by the scripture I
[1:29:23] Pro to you this morning that the third
[1:29:26] is identified by the scripture too look
[1:29:29] upon the world see where she's at look
[1:29:32] how they have rejected the truth how
[1:29:34] it's been properly identified The
[1:29:37] Prophecy part now where we at oh God be
[1:29:41] merciful that makes my heart bleed on
[1:29:44] the inside what about it where we at
[1:29:50] brother bam asked the question so now
[1:29:53] how do we get to live this life that's
[1:29:55] worthy of the Gospel so we see that
[1:29:58] there was three calls there was three
[1:30:01] pools that that becomes our our Feast
[1:30:05] that we Feast around he brings it to us
[1:30:08] that Russia England and America they
[1:30:10] rejected it but this is the final call
[1:30:13] the last call that the people today are
[1:30:16] going into this neurotic State the
[1:30:20] pastors that are not preaching the truth
[1:30:23] their life isn't worthy and the people
[1:30:25] that put up with it their life is not
[1:30:29] worthy of the Gospel but we are those
[1:30:33] who have heard the call we believe that
[1:30:37] call and we stand with it is that right
[1:30:39] Saints amen is your life worthy of the
[1:30:42] Gospel brother Ram says this two places
[1:30:44] and then we'll close amen now the only
[1:30:47] way paragraph
[1:30:49] 264 the only way to live a
[1:30:52] life Worthy is to let Christ and his
[1:30:56] word which he is the word reflect itself
[1:30:59] so perfect in you till God
[1:31:04] vindicates what he said in his
[1:31:07] word only way to live a life Worthy is
[1:31:10] to let Christ and his word which he is
[1:31:13] the word reflect itself so perfect in
[1:31:15] you till God vindicates what he
[1:31:20] said in the word for Christ died that he
[1:31:23] might might present himself before God a
[1:31:26] sacrifice and it returned back in the
[1:31:28] form of the Holy Spirit to reflect
[1:31:31] itself through his people to carry on
[1:31:34] his work reflecting himself through you
[1:31:38] to fulfill his promised word in these
[1:31:42] future days now is this word reflecting
[1:31:45] itself in you how are you becoming one
[1:31:48] with it are you enjoying what the
[1:31:51] benefits of it are you are you feasting
[1:31:54] on what he's given to us in this day he
[1:31:57] says it again in paragraph number 22
[1:32:02] 271 pray God to let the light of this
[1:32:04] day raise in
[1:32:06] you to be an obedient servant to God as
[1:32:11] we spoke this morning and then let the
[1:32:14] fruit of the spirit ever remain in your
[1:32:17] life and that is a life is worthy of the
[1:32:21] Gospel let me say this in closing the
[1:32:25] only way the only way that you can live
[1:32:28] a life that's worthy of the Gospel is
[1:32:31] let the gospel itself every bit of the
[1:32:34] Gospel come into you and reflect his
[1:32:38] promises back make them Vindicated let
[1:32:42] God live in you Amen to vindicate the
[1:32:46] promises of this day Hallelujah isn't
[1:32:50] that nice it's very very simple he said
[1:32:54] brother isra I don't understand it all
[1:32:56] we don't have to understand it all you
[1:32:58] just let the gospel of Christ live and
[1:33:02] reflect itself in you every promise you
[1:33:06] say Lord let the word reflect itself in
[1:33:09] me I'm it's just a teenager I'm a a
[1:33:13] little taller seven 10 years old I just
[1:33:16] be I'm a new Christian whatever it is
[1:33:18] I'm a minister I'm a whatever I am I'm a
[1:33:22] pastor I'm a Deacon or Elder Lord let
[1:33:26] the promises of this day reflect itself
[1:33:29] in me and then that is a life that's
[1:33:35] worthy of all these
[1:33:37] visions that were
[1:33:39] spoken that we have direct a access to
[1:33:44] Lord let that be my life worthy of the
[1:33:47] Gospel is that your prayer the musicians
[1:33:50] come musicians may come let

[1:33:55] word manifest manifest itself in me

[1:34:06] Lord
[1:34:08] amen bless his wonderful name
[1:34:12] amen oh
[1:34:14] my amen let's bow our heads word of
[1:34:19] prayer Lord Jesus thank you for your
[1:34:21] word tonight
[1:34:23] we thank you for this small
[1:34:26] reminder of the order of
[1:34:29] things how we're in this last day
[1:34:33] truth oh God I pray that you would make
[1:34:37] us convinced and then concerned about
[1:34:41] these
[1:34:42] things as I think about it Lord and as
[1:34:46] our
[1:34:47] hearts
[1:34:49] have Lord we've just tasted it it's so
[1:34:53] much to it and yet it seems like we
[1:34:56] don't catch it
[1:34:58] all but Lord we want to be faithful to
[1:35:01] the portion that you gave to
[1:35:03] us oh Lord please Grant it raise my
[1:35:08] respect for it higher than it's ever
[1:35:11] been
[1:35:12] before Lord on the other side those
[1:35:15] people raised up the prophet set him up
[1:35:19] because he was a leader on
[1:35:21] Earth and he asked the question will PA
[1:35:23] have to be judged say yes will he make
[1:35:28] it yes he says if Paul makes it I'll
[1:35:31] make it
[1:35:32] too because I preach what Paul preached
[1:35:36] and the
[1:35:38] millions they screamed out we're resting
[1:35:41] on
[1:35:42] that if you didn't go we wouldn't even
[1:35:45] be here they said oh
[1:35:48] Lord father they wasn't ashamed of the
[1:35:51] message over there why should they be
[1:35:54] ashamed of it over
[1:35:56] here Lord I'm determined more in my mind
[1:35:59] in my heart to be faithful Lord to go to
[1:36:04] the hedges and the
[1:36:06] highways and rather than argue with the
[1:36:09] Pharisee or sadducee or religious man
[1:36:12] over and over and over again to go to
[1:36:15] someone who's never heard it and present
[1:36:17] it to them Lord that's our desire may
[1:36:21] you grant that to our hearts we pray
[1:36:24] we ask in Jesus
[1:36:27] name as you continue to play that softly
[1:36:30] sis let me take one more quotation for
[1:36:33] you send the message convince and then
[1:36:36] concern brother brandom says this I gave
[1:36:39] it to you back there I refrained from
[1:36:41] reading it but I want to read it for you
[1:36:43] now came on my mind just three or four
[1:36:47] little paragraphs paragraph number
[1:36:49] 71 it says so but it looks like there's
[1:36:53] not enough concern I wonder why why
[1:36:57] isn't there a concern like there used to
[1:37:01] be it's I believe the reason that if
[1:37:04] there's not as much concern as there
[1:37:06] used to be they're not as convinced as
[1:37:10] they used to be you have to be convinced
[1:37:14] before you can be
[1:37:16] concerned not concerned you take the
[1:37:20] time now instead of evangelizing and
[1:37:22] trying to do something
[1:37:24] everybody wants a great big school or a
[1:37:26] great big something that they can teach
[1:37:28] and make ministers have better pullit
[1:37:31] manners and so forth you know what I
[1:37:33] believe I believe that the people is not
[1:37:36] convinced that Jesus is coming soon I
[1:37:39] don't believe that they're convinced
[1:37:41] that he's coming in this age and I
[1:37:44] believe that's the reason that they're
[1:37:46] not
[1:37:47] concerned because they're not fully
[1:37:50] convinced right they're not convinced
[1:37:54] that he's with them if they were they
[1:37:57] would come back to the word that's right
[1:38:01] now many people might misunderstand it
[1:38:05] but Lord help us to be
[1:38:08] convinced and then if we're convinced
[1:38:11] we'll be concerned God bless you richly
[1:38:14] amen let's sing
