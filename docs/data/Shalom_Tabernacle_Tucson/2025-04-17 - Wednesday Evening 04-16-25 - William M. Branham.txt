A hopeless case, an empty place, if not for grace. Let's all stand. Amazing grace, how sweet the [Music] sound. I once was lost, but now I'm [Music] found. A hopeless case, an empty place if not for grace. Precious Lord, please take my hand and lead me on and help me stand. A hopeless case, an empty place. If not for grace, where would I be? You only know. I'm glad you see through eyes of love. A hopeless case, an empty place. If not for Let's sing one more time to him. Where would I be? He only knows. I'm glad you see through eyes of love. a hopeless case. If not, if not for grace, I was a hopeless case, an empty place if not for grace. [Music] Praise the Lord tonight. hopeless case you're looking at, but by the grace of God, so thankful to be in church tonight, Brother Edward, Sister Bethany, we sure been missing you. And just love to have you back and you heard the call and answered the call and as as Trevor was singing, you know, I want to answer the call as the Lord, you know, you look at your life and I have to go to work and I have to do this, but if he was called to call me to do something different, Brother Scott, whatever it is, I want to be receptive and respond to that call tonight. And I was a little worried I'd maybe be uh worshiping with just a few tonight. Even I sometimes the pastor not going to be here. Maybe I want to take the night off or so. But we're not doing this for the pastor. But we're going to hear from heaven tonight. I don't really believe that. And just a few things during a song service really touched me. Just little things that were coincidental. Ordained before the foundation of the world. Brother Trevor used the word once more. You didn't catch that probably, but I did. We're listening to that tonight. So that was neat. and then going into these things of the Lord and the worship. I so enjoyed that with you. And that Romans 8 I wanted to read because he he did the the song there that had some of these words and he went into that that love and the redemption. And we'll just read a few of those scriptures in Romans 8 before we go into once more. Romans 8:33, he was talking about being an overcomer tonight. Brother uh Trevor was singing about that and come home defeated, behind schedule, over budget, and all of these things. But by the grace of God, we're overcomers as he has told us tonight. 33 Romans 8:33 says, "Who," maybe we read this together altogether. Romans 8:33, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemnth? It is Christ that died, yay, rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword? As it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long. We are accounted as sleep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. And the people say, "Amen." Brother John, I think that covered it all. And I'm a conqueror through Christ Jesus. And he went into the love after that. So appreciate being able to worship with you tonight, Brother Trevor. Our young people always do a fine job and just love to be able to sing and worship with you kind of behind them. So uh welcome. God bless you. And we'll go right into the once more tape. We'll do a portion of this God willing tonight and then next Wednesday do our normal prayer meeting and remember those things. So be thinking of something you might mention to the church or unspoken. We'll do that in a moment. Um but only believe all things are possible. Only believe, only believe, all things are possible. Only believe. Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. Only I believe. So all things are possible. Lord, I believe. Yes. Lord, I believe. All things are possible. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. All things are possible. Yay. Lord, I believe. Stay standing and brother Brandham will seat us. God bless you. We are assembled again in the name of thy beloved child, the Lord Jesus, to express our love and worship to him. Again, we pray that his spirit will meet with us. Yes. and that he will give us each a portion of that spirit that might give us sustaining grace to finish the journey and fight the fight that's set before us, the fight of faith. Grant it, Father, and break to us this afternoon the bread of life to strengthen us. For it is written, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth from the mouth of God." May we hear that this afternoon in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You be seated. Commenting Brother Carlson, you just let me on about 10 minutes late. It's getting better. Another week's meeting would just I'd probably be here on time. We're so happy for the privilege. Now, tonight is our closing night of this certain service. And I want to let you out in time so you can have your your supper. I know a lot of you call it your dinner, but if I have dinner, then where's my supper coming from? Now, I was talking to a fellow. He said, "Oh, Brother Brandham, it's it's dinner." Well, it is. I said, "I want to prove you you're wrong." I said, 'We don't take the Lord's dinner. We take his supper. So we um we like to think of it as the Lord as our supper or the Lord's supper that night, not morning or afternoon. He he tucked it in the evening. It was his supper. Now, so we want to get back early and so we won't be late tonight. Brother Carlson's going to let me on just exactly on time. Faith is the substance of things hoped for. And um I don't know if the Lord willing, I might try to speak tonight if I get a little enough time on the countdown the for the it's a scientific little message the Lord's given me for the last days. And maybe the Lord willing I might be able to speak on that tonight. Now we had a grand time last night. kind of went over and said, "We're not going to pray for the sick and the Lord heal the sick anyhow." Sometimes we can say something, but the Lord can just upset that anytime he wants to. You see, he he's God. Now, I want to read quickly from the scriptures for a little text that I a thought that might be a help to us this afternoon. Now, if he let me on on time, I won't try to get out on time. And that would be about 4:30, which would be about 50 minutes from now. Let us turn now over to the book of Judges, the 16th chapter, and let's read um the um 27th and 28th verses as we look to the word. Now the house was full of men and women, and all the lords of the Philistines were there. And there were upon the roof about 3,000 men and women. The whole while Samson made sport. And Samson called to the Lord and said, "Oh Lord, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee. Only this once, oh Lord, that I might be avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes. Let's pray again. Lord Jesus, take this little text, water the church with it. Lord, we pray and commit it to you in Jesus name. Amen. There must have been about 3,000 Philistines uh looking down from the top of the galley this great arena when the couple entered the arena that afternoon. Must have been a hot day. All day long they'd been out there and in this great company on top of this great arena that was built something on an order of a upside down mushroom and the center post in the middle that went out something in this way and held the two post holding all the spectators around. Highly polished warlords and their fine jeweled women all lean forward at this certain event for they wanted to get a good look that was taking place. There had been preliminaries all the entertainment. They probably had little monkeys that that played little tricks and they had uh different things that they entertained themselves with fighting, rrestling, and and and maybe dueling to death and many other things that that they had been entertained with all day for it was a great day. But now the main event come. You know how we all wait patiently while the preliminaries are going on and they wait for the the main event and that's when everybody sets up and takes notice. We watch it in our religious services of when we have our our singing and our testimonials and the preaching and so forth. But the main event is see what the Lord's going to do. See why he's gathered us together for. We're all under anticipations to see just what the end's going to be. The main event. It's that way in anything. We always watch for the main event. And they all raised up to look forward to see what was taking place because the main event was being brought to them. What did they see but a blind man being led by a little boy. The halls that echoed all afternoon with drunken revery. How that they pass the whiskey and their high drinks and their fine painted up and jeweled women and great dignified warlords and all. It was a great celebration. They were celebrating the victory. Oh, how I hate to say this. The victory that the fish god Dagen had got over the servant of God. It just goes plummed down at the bottom of me to have to say that. But it's truth. Celebrating such a way as that of victory over Jehovah's servant. What a shameful thing. drinking, raing, painted women and jeweled up and great dignitaries, the fires is burning under the fish god and what a celebration it must have been. But the heartbreaking part as thousands of years later that we have to think back of such an event as that and when the great God of heaven who had purposed in his heart to destroy that nation because they were heathens and had sent a man to do the job. And here the fish god idol was celebrating a victory over Jehovah's uh servant. Jehovah never lost. The servant that he sent to do it lost the victory. What a sight. What a shameful thing it was. The lad led the stumbling blind man across the the hall to these big center post where on all the great upside down musherun or umbrella like set where the people look down like this from the great like pilasters run up and help the thing in order laid by stone that could not be reproduced again today. No one could build it like that. But what a great thing it was. And thousands of the celebrity priests who had served a idol with their chest all swelled out and all their ceremonies and rituals over their idle that he had conquered Jehovah. What a great day it was. drinking, reverying, and carrying on. And here comes Jehovah's servant, blind, stumbling, led by a little boy, out to this great post to make sport. The main event of entertainment was to make sport out of Jehovah's ordained purpose to destroy the nation. And yet the nation has taken the thing that God had placed in to destroy them. And now they had conquered him and was making sport out of him. The main event at their celebration. Doesn't that just kill you nearly to have to look at that? to think what could this story never really should have never had to be told but was probably told for for our admonition is wrote that way. humiliated, broken, standing now defeated right between the two posts that held the building. What a symbol that is of the church of this day. What a symbol that has sold out to the world and the very thing that we're here to conquer. The church that has sold its its moss, sold the Bible, sold its strength, soul surrendered its sword and standing humiliated in the hour when the approaching signs of the coming of Jesus Christ is at hand. when she ought to be washed, not a spot or a wrinkle, standing to receive her bridegroom. What a picture we see here. A symbol of moral decay that rest upon the nation, this nation. And I'm not going to try to stay with my scriptures too long so I can get through quick. But I could symbolize that with the church, with the nation, with politics, and with everything you can put your hands on today besides God's Bible. Morally decayed. The human race itself just in a terrible condition. And they're under atheists and unbelievers that can point their finger into the face of the church who should have the message for today and ask them, "What does all this mean?" And they don't have the answer. They don't have the answer. Wow. They did like Samson did. They've surrendered. So see him standing there and we'd say, "So this is Samson." Let's catch a picture of him. This great mighty warrior. Let's picture him this afternoon that he had wide shoulders, great framework. And here this big book of a man stands there blinded, tied with little strings and led to the middle of the floor, humiliated, broken, defeated with the great God of heaven looking down upon him. Down here is critics, drunken soldiers looking down. I'd imagine as he stood there, many Philistines had even shook in their shoes to hear his name. Samson was a mighty name one time. So was Christianity. The church was going to parallel it with the church. This scene Samson named people just fainted for he was some sort of a man that they had never seen a man like him. His strength was beyond anything that the world had ever had. There's nothing they had could match it. Many remember him as he looked on him standing there in that condition. Manny looked upon him from the galleys and remember seeing standing in another position one day standing with a jawbone of a mule in his hand with a thousand Philistines laying around him when they had fled to the rocks for safety standing motion his fingers. Come on if you want some of it. But now look at him. many of the Philistines that one night he was persuaded in by harlot and in the the city of Gaza. They took the great big gates that would weigh tons and fenced him in and caught him and sent out to the soldiers and said, "Now we've caught him. We've hemmed him in like the devil's always trying to do. Him you in on something. But remember when Samson awoke the next morning or that night rather seeing he was hemmed in, he could feel back on the back of his head and still know he was a covenant son of God. Amen. And there was nothing could he him in. The church once stood like that, too. What did he do? He rose up, walked down the street, pulled the gates out of its sockets, and put it up on his shoulders, and walked up the top of the hill and sat down. Many standing there that afternoon remember that event. But look at him now. Blinded, mocked, just a sport for the enemy. All his powers that he once had for his protection, for God's achievement that he had been born in the world to do had been stripped from him by a woman. I think that same thing could be applied today that a woman who pretends to be the bride of Christ uh and basing her teaching with a cup of the filthiness of her abominations of her fornications. She has tipped the cup of her fornications into the mouths of God's church been raised up to show his signs and wonders as Jesus last commandment was to do in Mark 16. And now we find that she has took God's little faithful group and organized them together just exactly the way she did herself. and got them standing stripped, denying the power thereof, denying the Holy Spirit, denying the power to speak with tongues, denying the power of of the Holy Spirit to raise the dead and heal the sick and cast out devils. And now the Philistines is up on thee. And what's he going to do now? strip all what must have went through that man's mind. We have seen what must have went through the Philistines mind. They didn't know when I've heard one reach over to another maybe say I remember the time when you say Samson every Philistine go like rats to a hole. I've heard the time they say a thousand men would be marching across the desert. They say Samson's coming. They'd drop their arms and run for safety as hard as he could. But now look at him. He's in a terrible condition, bound all because he compromised to a woman. That's what done it. She stripped him of his power. She kept trying to find out where his strength laid. She know he was a big man, but they had big man, too. But this Delila, she was a a real Jezebel. She knowed how to work on him to woo him to her and say that he she loved him. But all the time she was trying to fish along where his strength laden, that's the same thing that the Jezebel has done to the church. It's fished along until it's found out where the strength lead and it the strength is in the word. The word is God. Amen. And finally she found where that strength laid and she took him down to Na Rome and shaved off his locks. And now they've took what's left out of it and take them back to the World Council of Churches and got their locks shaved again. It's a constant shaving taking this out. This doesn't mean that in the days of miracles just passed. There is no such a thing as this that the other. They found where the strength went. Substituting baptisms and handshakes and all these other things for the true unadulterated word of God. This word is God that was given to his church to defeat the world and the devils and the sickness and to cast out devils and Amen. No denomination was given to the church. The word was given to the church. That's her strength. But they've cut this away. They cut that away and they shaved off this lock and shaved off that lock until she stands shoring today like a Catholic sister. Sure, until she's accepted a bunch of man-made creeds for her doctrine, just exactly what the prophet said she would do. And here she stands today humiliated when the God of heaven has chose the ignorant fisherman and so forth and has come down in that and proving it that he still remains God and they can't give an answer to their congregation for it because it's not connected with any denomination. and she stands humiliated where she ought to have been standing in her strength. If the church today stood like it did on the day of Pentecost. If the church today stood like it did in the days of Ireneius and in the days of St. Martin or in the days of Polocart where the church would march right into death before it would defy any word of God. Ireneius, Martin, all those men held tight to that water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ. Every one of them held tight to that baptism of the Holy Ghost with prophets, signs, and wonders. And they've got away from it today. What happened? Delilah and Node were the strength blade and if she could ever get those seminaries away from that word onto some man-made theology, she had it. Then it was easy to bind and lead them into the World Council of Churches. This economical council. You see, you ain't got no right. I'm still American citizen. I got a right to freedom of speech. That's right. Certainly is. Notice that's exactly the truth. Oh, how he must have felt what went through that man's mind as he stood there. Now, Jezebel knew, or not Jezebel, but Delilah knew if she could ever punch his eyes out, that was it. And that's exactly what Delilah of this last day has done to the church. Punch its eyes out to God's promise. and sold you to some great big intellectual denomination. Everybody likes to bl say, "I belong to the first church. I belong to down here." I see. As long as the devil can put your eyes out to the word of God and the promise of God, no matter how foolish it sounds, it's God's promise. I I'm not endorsing cults. Not at all. But them cults are known by their works. So is God's church known by its works. But I'm trying to say what Delilah has done to Samson. Now let's take Samson's side. What must have went through the man's mind as he stood there? All the great victories he had once had must have passed through his mind. The events on now the entertainment for the afternoon is fixing to start. The ones that's to be entertained are thinking of what he was. And here he is thinking are thinking of what he was. But because some woman lured him, the pictures changed to what it should been. God raised Samson up to destroy that nation. That was the very purpose of bringing him on. If God can only find one man, that's all he needs. One man that can fully surrender to him. He don't take an army. He never did use that. He only uses a man. Now, Samson gave God his strength to use, but he didn't give God his heart. He gave his heart to Goliath. and gave his strength to God. But you've got to surrender soul, body, spirit, spirit, everything you are to the will of God. Become a prisoner to him. You're going to be somebody's prisoner. That's right. You don't belong to yourself. You're somebody's prisoner. You're either a prisoner of the devil knowing this truth and won't surrender to it or a prisoner to to the world and surrender to God. One or the other. You're either devil's prisoner to sin or you're God's prisoner to righteousness. You're one of the other. And now Samson thinks of the great victories that he had won. No doubt it come to his mind. How that when he was a little boy that God had vindicated him, told his mother that how that she must uh uh do not drink strong drinks or or watch her diet that she was bringing forth a Nazerite. how she uh combed his hair and told him, "Son, through these locks, it's a covenant with God that your strength will lay in there. Don't never give it away. Don't never give away your secret. Don't never surrender it. Whatever you do, stay with it." Amen. Jesus Christ told the church that heavens and earth will pass away, but my word shall never pass away. Amen. And whosoever shall take one word from it or add one word to it, his part will be taken out of the book of life. Amen. The church ought to think of that now as we stand in this chaos and this hour. just prayer prior the coming of the Lord Jesus at any moment for a rapture. The great victories that we can point back in the days gone by and the reformation back in the days of Ireneius and St. Martin, Patrick and those who protested those organizations and when Luther came out and protested that first organization Catholic Church and the group that followed him come right back and organized behind him. When John Wesley come out of Anglicanism and the soon as Wesley left, they organize right behind him and the early Pentecost come out of the denominations. That was a cursed word to you. But as a dog goes to its bomb and a s to their wall, you went right back in the thing that you were born to defeat. Hallelujah. That hurts my heart too. Even more than to think of the victory honor that Dagon had over Samson. I see what Jezebel's got over the church. That's the reason every strength and ever fed my being. I'm trying time to protest that thing and call back that church to her place of repentance. Your mothers, your fathers were ousted out of those organizations. They come out of it and protested it. And here their children has turned right back around and went right back in the thing that they come out of. That ain't a picture of Samson. What Delilah did. how we ought to let the thoughts go through our mind of the great victories. I don't have time to get it and keep my word to you. And God's people say, "Amen." Maybe cut that a little short tonight. Hard to push pause on that one, but God willing, we'll we'll get the rest of it soon, Brother Chuck. So, let's uh remember their prayer requests tonight. We'll we'll give you plenty of time here with the We won't have to rush out. We can take some time and just pray for one another. Our precious brother Victor, he puts up a lot of circus nonsense at the house and we we bring them. We appreciate brother Vic you coming with us to church frequently and I know you've got a need on your heart. We just hold that up in faith believing for uh Victor Mickey there in the back. U a note to please remember um before we do that I'm getting ahead of myself. I get a little nervous up here. You forgive me think I wouldn't do that. But um I wanted to read a couple of these quotes that's full of nuggets. So if we could do that first and then we'll go to these prayer requests if you want to play something softly. Brother Brandon reminded us tonight, the strength is in maybe the one people, the young people can finish a couple of these sentences here, Timothy or someone. The strength is in the Where's the strength at Timothy? The strength is in the word and the word is God. Very powerful tonight. He said the word was gi to the church. That's her strength tonight. So, we have strength. We're made more than conquerors. This goes right along with what we were singing and reading earlier. And he reminds us to surrender everything you are to the will of God. If if they call you across the the United States, Brother Edward, to to do a work somewhere else, you just drop everything and you go do if if he calls you to Africa with brother Israel or these things, we want to just be responsive to the call. So just uphold these uh requests in in faith believing tonight for again brother Victor Mickey there in the back. A note to remember sister Ann, sister Ellie Troutman. She can't get out and and they would very much like to be here with us so badly. So remember them. I don't know if they're able to stream or anything, but we sure hold them up in prayer. We miss them. The Troutman's. A request for Michael Councilman Elizabeth Ericson husband is going to have in for emergency heart surgery even now. Did I get that right, Sister Barb? So certainly want to remember them. Everybody knows the Erikson family there in Jeffersonville and their ties here. So remember Michael Councilman. The Lord sure did a work for our precious sister Lori. She's been raised from the dead. She's doing much better, but a long way to go. And she has some rehab coming up. And the family requested some specific things there. I don't have them all written down, but we just trust the Lord to get her into rehab up there in Seattle and all that she has to go through. Brother Randy back here and uh things he's dealing with. So, and the family continue to hold up the snows. I like to tease her. We can't tease everybody, but Sister Rain, I call her. So, Sister Snow, Lori, we miss her and pray for the rehab there. Uh, we miss Brother Kim. He's giving me a big parking spot out here. And so I I told him that piece of junk. He got that out of here. So we're going to miss Brother Kim and Sister Hedi. I was kind of hoping he'd leave that piece of junk for me. But got a long road back to Canada. He's probably got more hours than any of us except for Aaron and brother Chuck. I think maybe there's some others, but we miss him and a big long road ahead. And he's one of those guys. He'll poke you a little bit and you just can't offend him and he does it in a way you just can't offend you. So I hope we're not offensive. I hope we're like that and I just pray that he'll have a safe trip. He's really a hero of the faith in my w mind. We watched the testimony. He's got another testimony and looking at his arm there the other day and he told the story of how it should have been cut off. He said when I wake up that arm better be attached I'm going to be real upset. He told a doctor and uh he said, "I just wanted to lay there if nothing else and the Lord will make that move and and it come out and it could barely move and it just the Lord worked in his life and ended a miracle there that that wasn't on the on the uh video that we watched." And so we're just thankful for that hero of faith and pray have a safe trip and Lord would bless him as he blessed us. Of course, we miss brother Israel tonight and doing the work of the Lord. And it's not all uh just easy. All that traveling. He's going across the country uh tonight of Africa and four layovers. If I got it right, and just a big long trip. I know he'll be a blessing, but time zones and different cultures and all the things. I just pray for him. Hold him up in your prayer life. He'll be a real blessing, I believe. So, what am I missing? Brother Chuck, Brother Levi, nothing there. Is there something you'd like to bring before the church saints out loud and mention? Is there anything we're we're missing? Yes. Little Chloe, you got something or you just want us to pray for you? Just pray for Chloe. It's good. We'll have faith with her. Maybe we'll stand and sing a song. There's some some folks missing. We miss our amen corner here, brother brother George and the missionary work and all that he's doing and going on for the moors. Just want to continue to hold them up and all the others that are missing there next to you. Anything else? Yes, sister. message to me They found ago. Praise the Lord. Thank you for that tonight. We appreciate that. I get so nervous. Like I said, I forgot to even mention that was Chicago in 60 I think it was. So appreciate that testimony of the Lord working in our sister Joyy's life through this message that's uh pertinent even today. Is there anything else that should be mentioned before we go to prayer? Yes, my sister. Yes. Thank you. That's brother Timothy Williams. That one that was in the prayer request. There's an email that went out. There's a way to support if you can do that. And for our sister Lori, people have been real responsive um to some of that. Some I think we could do a little bit better with just some reminders. So, we'll remind you and if nothing else, it's not to minimize the prayer. We can certainly hold them up and the Lord will move. Yes, my brother. Good. Definitely. Thanks for remembering our precious sister Deborah McGinty and the battles she's going through physically and um for a job and the things that she so desires. We delight ourselves in the Lord. He gives us the desires of our heart. Anything else? [Music] I cast all my cares upon you. Oh, I lay all of my burdens. Oh, lay them down tonight. Yes. And anytime.
