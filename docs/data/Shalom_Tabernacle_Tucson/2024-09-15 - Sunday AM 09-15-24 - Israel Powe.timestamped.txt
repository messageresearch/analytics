[4:49] he'll be here I'll know him and finally
[4:51] one day he said
[4:53] behold there he
[4:55] is there's a lamb of God that takes away
[4:57] the sin of the world
[4:59] 's up now I've introduced you to him I
[5:03] must decrease now I must go off the
[5:04] scene he'll take over from here the
[5:07] Millennium will be on
[5:09] right the time is hand then when he
[5:12] comes when even John said he's going to
[5:15] oh he's going to shut the hide off he's
[5:17] going to he's going to separate the
[5:18] wheat from the from the chaff and he's
[5:20] going to burn it up he's going to
[5:22] thoroughly Purge his floors and his B is
[5:24] in his hand but what it was it little
[5:27] bitty now they had all draw up oh man
[5:30] he'll have a spe reach a mile long
[5:32] you'll stand back over here in Palestine
[5:34] you stand up there just on one of these
[5:35] white clouds and pick up all these
[5:37] Romans like this and cast him into hell
[5:38] just keep on doing like that it gets it
[5:40] all over while they had that all fixed
[5:42] up and what it was a little lamb come
[5:45] moving out of M Meek and Jan pushed
[5:47] around this way and that
[5:49] way even John said now look at John the
[5:53] prophet he said go ask him is actually
[5:55] he the
[5:58] one so so humbl that Prophet
[6:02] missed said is he the one or do we seek
[6:04] for another now he never give him a book
[6:07] from them disciples and and Matthew 11
[6:09] come to ask him when John's disciple
[6:11] John is in prison so he' been all so
[6:14] scrupled up to the I believe his Pim and
[6:16] said his Eagle Eye got fmed over down
[6:19] see he could he he done come down to the
[6:21] Earth he' been up in the air but when
[6:22] his prophecy was over he dropped back
[6:24] down to the ground again see him prison
[6:27] see he didn't have no use for that big
[6:28] wings anymore so he just laid down there
[6:30] but he flew higher any the rest of them
[6:32] let me show you something God used him
[6:35] and Jesus knew he see because that was
[6:37] the that was the Incarnate God there see
[6:40] he was so he he said there and I never
[6:43] give him a book on how to behave himself
[6:45] in jail he said wait a minute I'll write
[6:46] a little essay here you take back and
[6:48] tell John how to behave himself when
[6:50] he's in jail for my sa see oh he never
[6:52] said that he didn't say go tell John
[6:54] that he ought to got his PhD degree
[6:57] before he come out if he would have rest
[6:59] of he been a rejector John was honest
[7:02] and asked the question and he said just
[7:04] wait till the meeting's over and then go
[7:06] show John what happen then he'll know if
[7:10] you tell him what's going on then he'll
[7:14] know just go let him tell him tell he's
[7:17] in prison couldn't be here but but you
[7:19] said in the meeting and you see what
[7:21] happen you go tell him so then the
[7:23] disciples said very well Master old the
[7:25] he he went Jesus Sitting on This Rock
[7:27] just watched him till he crossed over
[7:29] over and went up over the hill he turned
[7:31] out con said um who who' you go out to
[7:34] see in the time of John the what went
[7:37] you out to see did you go out to see a
[7:39] man that's got his collar turned around
[7:41] and soft clothed and highly polished and
[7:44] educated is that kind of man you went
[7:46] out to see no you know what them kind
[7:48] are they kiss the babies you know work
[7:52] in King's palaces they that's type gen
[7:55] well said then why' you go to see a man
[7:57] that's been given a Ministry and hook at
[7:59] R into an organization or something like
[8:01] that shaking whatever then if the if the
[8:03] on that's don't want him he go over to
[8:04] the Trinity the trity don't want him go
[8:06] Church of God any work is that kind of
[8:07] man you see Shake any read oh no
[8:12] joh he said then what did you go to see
[8:15] a prophet he said I say that's right but
[8:18] I'm going to tell you something that you
[8:19] don't know he was more than a
[8:21] prophet he was more if you can receive
[8:24] it this is who that was written of in
[8:26] the Bible back there in scripture I'll
[8:28] send my messenger before my face Malachi
[8:30] 3 see and he prepare the way before me
[8:33] see and they didn't understand even the
[8:35] disciples didn't get it see that's right
[8:38] oh my Simplicity be humble see go right
[8:42] down when God promises something big see
[8:44] it is big in his side now if you want to
[8:47] always keep this in mind I want you to
[8:50] you keep this in mind and when this
[8:52] happens then you can change it you reach
[8:55] down and pick up one of these little
[8:56] spring flowers that's coming this year
[8:59] or get a common blade of grass and hold
[9:02] it in your hand and say I'm going to
[9:05] hold this now and see that something so
[9:08] simple has made this I want to see the
[9:11] brain that can send a rocket to the moon
[9:13] make this blade of
[9:16] grass you'll always have it you can rest
[9:20] assure on that you'll always have it a
[9:22] blade of grass has life in it see it's
[9:26] so simple and humble you see if a man is
[9:30] a big man all right but if he's big
[9:32] enough that he can become
[9:34] simple see he'll find God but if he
[9:37] don't become simple he'll never see you
[9:40] got to become simple now verse in

[12:39] slain and here it is here it is I was
[12:42] wrong on that see thou has redeemed us
[12:46] to God by the blood I've ever that's
[12:49] right now what do you think about
[12:53] that oh if the presence of the Holy
[12:56] Ghost isn't here what is he let see I
[13:00] only read the first part of that verse
[13:02] see it's it's just a ver something wrot
[13:04] here and I trying to get through looking
[13:05] at that clock but you see him sto me on
[13:08] that

[13:24] tongue in nation sure that them
[13:29] oh my oh my see
[13:34] it and by the way there's another
[13:36] question down here
[13:38] too could
[13:42] you uh c o n r control those
[13:48] given or control those given white Robes
[13:51] of Revelation 611 with those who wash
[13:54] their robes in the blood of the lamb now
[13:56] let's see Revelation 6 I just can't
[13:59] hurry on this folks I see because it's
[14:02] going I'm go to answer something wrong
[14:04] and he didn't let you want me to do that
[14:06] that's the truth so help me the holy
[14:08] spirit of God knows that's the truth see
[14:11] I just there something just I I looked
[14:13] at I was look that clock 11:30 I thought
[14:15] if I don't hurry up now I won't get to
[14:16] pray for sick and I'm trying to get that
[14:19] because I my mind is so you how can't
[14:23] you remember you just have to understand
[14:24] I'm I'm a human see and I I've been in
[14:27] there for seven days and my and I got
[14:29] something yet this afternoon I've got
[14:31] toine from God but he was so determined
[14:34] that I wouldn't make that error they
[14:36] called me back to read the rest of that
[14:38] verse I just it just felt like something
[14:40] just rolled over me there and said go
[14:42] back go back I thought go back what stop
[14:44] right now start praying for the sick
[14:46] what what is it what have I done and
[14:47] just to start to reach for that somebody
[14:49] said read the verse over again I read it
[14:52] over and there at the bottom of this
[14:54] question there it was see Revelation 6
[14:58] see I read the first that does sound
[15:00] like it the first see and they sang a
[15:03] new song but down here see what it was
[15:06] the next coming on down has redeemed us
[15:09] short was the bride the raptured saint
[15:11] uh could you and here certainly the lamb
[15:15] had the book in his hand he done left
[15:17] the Throne of me the door of Grace see
[15:20] you see how the Holy Spirit watches that
[15:22] because exactly that's the same thing I
[15:24] said the other night when he had talked
[15:25] to me in the room and I come down here
[15:27] and preach to you all that one the lamb
[15:29] left the place oh my now believe just
[15:32] take a Tex see the lamb had left his
[15:35] seat and come forth see as I got up
[15:38] there when he was present that light
[15:40] which is Christ when he was present told
[15:43] me when the lamb leaves that seat of the
[15:46] throne to being a mediator he becomes
[15:49] out here and the day of redemption for
[15:51] the church is
[15:53] finished the next Redemption is opened
[15:56] is for the Jews 144 th is that right
[16:00] because he promised he cut the tree off
[16:02] you know now here now here he comes out
[16:05] the lamb and then the day of redemption
[16:08] is finished and all that's going to be
[16:09] redeemed has already been redeemed and
[16:11] put on the book and he's out here
[16:12] opening the book right oh thank you
[16:16] Lord forgive unnervous servant for
[16:19] trying to run over
[16:21] something now could you tolerate those
[16:25] given white Robes of Revelation 611 now
[16:28] let's see six and 11 all right where we
[16:33] at on this now white robes yeah that's
[16:35] the the crucified under the altar the
[16:38] the Jews between that time they were
[16:40] given white robes with those who wash
[16:42] their robes in the blood of the Lamb of
[16:44] Revelation 7:14 no now that is different
[16:48] sure enough course see here we find out
[16:51] here that these were given white robes
[16:53] over here in this time they were given
[16:56] white robes themselves by grace and
[16:59] these here had washed their robes and
[17:01] brother and over in Revelations over
[17:02] here this is that great multitude to
[17:04] come up before God of all Kinder tongues
[17:06] and Nations and these are directed
[17:07] exactly to the martyrs of the
[17:09] Jews now now that is correct now brother
[17:14] Brandon if all of The Godly was taken up
[17:17] in the
[17:18] Rapture where will the Elijah and Moses
[17:22] come from will they be Jews or will our
[17:27] Elijah given to us be be with them no
[17:32] the uh the Gentile that'll be Anointed
[17:36] with this Spirit to call out the Gentile
[17:39] will be taken away because you see the
[17:42] whole church all has been taken up and
[17:45] these two prophets of of the 11th
[17:48] chapter is brought down and the day of
[17:50] Grace is ended with the Gentile and been
[17:52] sent to the Jews no it won't be the same
[17:55] man I'm pretty sure of that I remember
[17:57] these are just the best of M knowledge
[17:59] let's see what this says question does
[18:02] the wheat and
[18:07] wine oh does w d
[18:10] a no I guess it meant what does it
[18:15] doesn't have the what there just says
[18:16] does the what and wine or wheat and wine
[18:19] what does
[18:21] the of Revelation 66 let's see how it is
[18:25] I
[18:26] get and I Heard a Voice in the midst of
[18:29] four be say a measure of wheat for a
[18:31] penny and a measure of barley for a
[18:35] penny see if that hurt not the wine or I
[18:38] guess that's mean the wheat and the wine
[18:40] that was one to the other re is a symbol
[18:43] the wine taken at the communion table of
[18:47] re of 1 Corinthians 11:24 does the
[18:51] wine the wine no one of them is a
[18:54] spiritual symbol seems uh and the other
[18:57] one is actually the
[18:59] the revelation of the word could it be
[19:02] that the reason many are sick because we
[19:07] did
[19:08] not discern the Lord's body correct but
[19:13] now reveal by the opening of The Sixth
[19:21] Seal let me see if I can get that now
[19:24] it's not you it's me you didn't you
[19:26] wrote it all right it's just me could it
[19:28] be be that the reason many are
[19:32] sick uh because we do not discern the
[19:35] Lord's body that's got a question mark
[19:37] at the end of that well the scripture
[19:40] says that many are sick and weakly among
[19:42] you because of the Discerning of the
[19:44] Lord's body that's exactly right because
[19:46] see the Lord's body is a bride and many
[19:48] of them go off and they don't go with it
[19:50] that's true see they don't know how to
[19:52] behave themselves lives any kind of life
[19:53] and take communion and things that's not
[19:55] right see when people take communion
[19:57] that lie and steal and drink and that
[20:00] that's that's terrible you shouldn't do
[20:01] that see uh but now reveal by the
[20:05] opening of the six seal the opening of
[20:08] The Sixth
[20:09] Seal let's see now no now you find out
[20:13] the Sixth Seal uh opening here was to
[20:17] the Jews see the the church has done
[20:20] gone this is a tribulation period so it
[20:23] wouldn't be the same no no it is one of
[20:26] them is a spiritual line it's a uh uh
[20:28] the revelation of the word then the the
[20:31] believer becomes stimulated by the
[20:34] revelation of the word the other is the
[20:35] symbol of the blood of Jesus is taken at
[20:38] the Lord's
[20:39] table now that's the best of my
[20:42] understanding of
[20:44] it will any that are not predestinated
[20:48] except the Lord if they do will they
[20:52] fall away not if they're predestinated
[20:54] no they couldn't Where is the scripture
[20:57] that shows that the
[20:59] the Catholicism will
[21:04] uh deceive the Jews and get their wealth
[21:09] now this words to say that that that the
[21:12] Beast will deceive for the wealth it
[21:15] doesn't say that but we're presuming
[21:17] that that was now the other night you
[21:19] remember you look at the tape real close
[21:20] H said that's what they would do I said
[21:23] see the Catholics is the richest group
[21:26] in the world nobody like that
[21:29] right and what they don't have the Jews
[21:31] has the rest that's right that's where
[21:33] the economics of this country now we're
[21:36] right now living on tax money according
[21:39] to Lifeline that will offer taxes that's
[21:42] come dve from Washington DC that'll be
[21:44] paid in 40 years since
[21:46] today that's what we're spanning now
[21:49] that's how far back we are giving notes
[21:51] see on taxes that will be paid in 40
[21:55] years from now the nation is broke
[21:58] he's
[21:59] done now Castro the only sensible thing
[22:03] that he ever done was when he
[22:05] counterfeited the ceny he paid off the
[22:07] notes the bonds and bur and changed the
[22:10] currency that's the only thing he could
[22:12] do and there's only one thing left for
[22:14] this United States to do now remember
[22:15] this is William Brandon see this is my
[22:18] idea it's only pursue
[22:20] me just looking at it in the natural
[22:23] standpoint which may be a million miles
[22:25] off I do believe it right there in that
[22:28] money the love of money is the root of
[22:30] all evil and I believe it right along in
[22:32] there will start the ball of rolling now
[22:35] the Catholic church back there from
[22:37] charging from Mass and so forth holds
[22:39] the wealth of the world you remember the
[22:41] Bible said she was rich and how she was
[22:43] and remember not only just on one nation
[22:46] she's rich on every nation there is
[22:48] under Heaven she reaches out she has the
[22:51] money now what they don't have Wall
[22:55] Street has which is control for the Jews
[22:57] right now and you remember he got the
[23:00] money when Jacob returned last now and
[23:02] you remember

[1:08:07] Psalms thank you
[1:08:10] musicians Psalms
[1:08:12] 107 good to see brother think goes
[1:08:15] brother Randy in the back there always
[1:08:17] nice to see him Psalms
[1:08:20] 107 and Psalms 13
[1:08:26] Isaiah 53 as well Psalms
[1:08:40] 107 David said I was glad when they said
[1:08:43] unto me let's go to the house of the
[1:08:45] Lord and so glad to be here with you
[1:08:52] today in verse
[1:08:55] number
[1:08:59] 20 he sent his word and healed them and
[1:09:03] delivered them from their
[1:09:05] destructions oh that men would praise
[1:09:07] the Lord for his goodness and for his
[1:09:10] wonderful Works to the children of men
[1:09:14] amen we'll take one more scripture in
[1:09:17] Psalms
[1:09:18] 103 very
[1:09:21] familiar
[1:09:24] Psalm vers 1 and
[1:09:29] two and
[1:09:32] three bless the Lord oh my soul and all
[1:09:35] that is within me bless His holy name
[1:09:38] bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not
[1:09:42] all his benefits who forgiveth all thy
[1:09:46] iniquities who Health all thy
[1:09:49] diseases let's all read uh those three
[1:09:52] verses all together out loud
[1:09:56] Psalms
[1:09:57] 103 sorry my fault Psalms 103 alog
[1:10:02] together bless the Lord oh my soul and
[1:10:05] all that is within me bless His holy
[1:10:08] name bless the Lord oh my soul and
[1:10:12] forget not all his benefits who
[1:10:15] forgiveth all thy iniquities who Health
[1:10:18] all thy
[1:10:20] diseases so the scripture tells us not
[1:10:22] to forget so it's telling us actually to
[1:10:25] to
[1:10:26] remember and remembering as we talked
[1:10:29] about is recording the word in your
[1:10:33] heart amen and then Isaiah 535 just to
[1:10:37] bring
[1:10:39] another witness along with us this
[1:10:42] morning as we speak on our subject
[1:10:44] Isaiah 53
[1:10:58] verse number four surely he hath borne
[1:11:01] our griefs and carried our sorrows yet
[1:11:05] we did esteem him stricken smitten of
[1:11:08] God and Afflicted but he was wounded for
[1:11:11] our
[1:11:12] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:11:15] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:11:18] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[1:11:23] healed amen and that
[1:11:26] the title of our message this morning is
[1:11:29] I am
[1:11:30] healed I am healed we've been talking
[1:11:33] about the whole man and this three ring
[1:11:36] man and I'm Healed in every level of a
[1:11:39] man and that's the real healing is when
[1:11:42] the whole man can be healed may God add
[1:11:43] a blessing to the reading of his word
[1:11:46] you may be seated good to see brother
[1:11:48] vidales and and then each of you I think
[1:11:52] it's brother Doug's birthday tomorrow so
[1:11:55] maybe we might shake his hand at the end
[1:11:57] of the service and say happy birthday or
[1:12:00] something he's been coming with us since
[1:12:02] covid I believe as where we met him in
[1:12:05] the park doing some preaching out there
[1:12:07] and he's brought a lot of visitors to
[1:12:09] the church and so we're happy to see him
[1:12:12] all the time when we see him and each of
[1:12:15] you always glad to be in the presence of
[1:12:17] the Lord
[1:12:19] amen um I am healed brother brandham
[1:12:24] takes uh the greatest battle of revault
[1:12:27] and he introduces to us this three- ring
[1:12:31] man he said when you get home paragraph
[1:12:34] 72 go home and draw these three rings I
[1:12:37] think it's in the lens book has a impr a
[1:12:42] diagram of that body and it says spirit
[1:12:46] and soul brother Brandon brings it body
[1:12:48] uh spirit soul that diagram says Body
[1:12:53] Soul then spirit and so they kind of
[1:12:55] switch it around but nevertheless and
[1:12:57] brother Adam did it both ways but the
[1:12:59] later years seems like it was body then
[1:13:03] your spirit then your soul how many can
[1:13:06] say Amen so he says draw this three-
[1:13:09] ring man now this these three rings
[1:13:12] these three portions that make up the
[1:13:14] man they're really different from one
[1:13:17] another but yet they're so
[1:13:19] interconnected and the interplay between
[1:13:22] them can
[1:13:25] um maybe make you think that uh you're
[1:13:29] just one being but you do have a
[1:13:33] spiritual man and that spiritual man is
[1:13:36] really the most important part of you
[1:13:39] not that the other parts are not but
[1:13:42] Satan uses well all levels that he can
[1:13:47] and the Battleground was chosen that you
[1:13:51] and I would battle him through our mind
[1:13:55] through the spirit man now brother rner
[1:13:59] makes this statement and I ended this on
[1:14:02] Wednesday night just a portion of it in
[1:14:05] the greatest battle OFA
[1:14:07] 1962 paragraph 128 and he says this
[1:14:11] there it is right there those
[1:14:15] channels you get them open up don't just
[1:14:20] bypass them then if Satan can get
[1:14:23] through there get by these conscience
[1:14:26] and all these other things then he gets
[1:14:28] right down here to the end of the soul
[1:14:31] in the mind now if he can just get you
[1:14:35] you'll never you'll never look at one of
[1:14:37] them until first you have to let him in
[1:14:41] here you have to let him in then when he
[1:14:46] gets in he gets
[1:14:48] control then what does he do he begins
[1:14:50] to use the conscience he begins to use
[1:14:52] this begins to use this Outlet what is
[1:14:55] it see taste feel smell hear
[1:14:58] imaginations conscience memories reasons
[1:15:01] affections he begins to use all those
[1:15:03] different little
[1:15:05] channels as long as he could get in
[1:15:09] above this one here he's got to come in
[1:15:12] your mind first and you have to accept
[1:15:16] it listen it can batter against you but
[1:15:21] it can't get to you until you accept it
[1:15:27] now this is really the free moral agency
[1:15:30] that we've talked about that brother vam
[1:15:32] brings to us so body in your body see
[1:15:36] taste feel smelling here and then that
[1:15:39] next Channel conscious memory reasons
[1:15:41] affections
[1:15:42] imaginations and then in the soul is
[1:15:46] Faith or doubt and that's governed by
[1:15:49] free moral agency that's you make the
[1:15:53] decision to do it he didn't make a us
[1:15:55] robots he could have made us robots he
[1:15:58] could have designed us where we never
[1:16:00] would tell a lie or never would make a
[1:16:02] mistake or never would do anything wrong
[1:16:05] he has the ability like he created the
[1:16:08] Sun and what's wrong with that I mean it
[1:16:11] raises perfectly on time all the time
[1:16:14] that was just the son and he could have
[1:16:17] made you and I that way but he didn't he
[1:16:20] gave us the ability to choose we chose
[1:16:23] we made the choice to get dressed and
[1:16:26] come to church this morning we made that
[1:16:28] choice even some obstacles even if we
[1:16:31] didn't feel so well we still made the
[1:16:34] choice to be here or somebody made the
[1:16:38] choice for us and Drug us here but it
[1:16:42] was all based on somebody's Choice okay
[1:16:45] and the choice is the free moral agency
[1:16:48] and that's the Cho that's the choice
[1:16:50] that you and I make to let him in or not
[1:16:53] and we talked about those channels and
[1:16:56] on Wednesday we talked about how don't
[1:17:00] give place to the devil don't give him a
[1:17:03] place and all these channels that he can
[1:17:06] come through now this man is made in the
[1:17:11] image of God God designed him and made
[1:17:14] him to be that way and in that man
[1:17:18] because of the Fall there's uh many many
[1:17:21] different elements in our bodies but the
[1:17:24] answer for all of our sicknesses and
[1:17:27] diseases was answered at Calvary amen
[1:17:31] good to have brother will back brother
[1:17:32] Will's been gone for almost a month in
[1:17:34] Brazil and good to see brother Angel in
[1:17:36] the back too amen can we all say praise
[1:17:39] the Lord prise the Lord are you happy to
[1:17:40] see
[1:17:41] them you get out yeah give them a hand
[1:17:46] clap I think the hand claps will ensure
[1:17:49] that they'll come more right it helps to
[1:17:52] encourage that but um this um healing
[1:17:57] all thy diseases and you know this um uh
[1:18:02] sicknesses in the body and him healing
[1:18:06] all of our diseases they're in the same
[1:18:09] scripture they're in the same scripture
[1:18:11] and if I ask you all here today how many
[1:18:14] of you are
[1:18:16] saved and you're not ashamed to lift up
[1:18:19] your hand in the congregation say I'm
[1:18:21] saved by the blood of Jesus Christ by
[1:18:23] salvation but then I'll come back and
[1:18:25] say how many of you are
[1:18:27] healed and it's like well wait a minute
[1:18:30] I kind of got a cold I kind of got a you
[1:18:32] know what is flu season I got to get my
[1:18:34] flu shot like who said that we have to
[1:18:36] catch the flu every year who told us
[1:18:39] that like it's like it's like we just
[1:18:42] accept sickness like it is the will of
[1:18:45] God and it is absolutely not the will of
[1:18:49] God it it is the it's a minor if he can
[1:18:53] save your soul
[1:18:55] the part of you that was on its way to
[1:18:59] hell and was completely separated from
[1:19:02] God what about your body healing your
[1:19:05] body it's far more easier far more
[1:19:08] easier and so um it's just a minor and
[1:19:11] we're going to talk about that minor
[1:19:13] part of how he is our healer remember
[1:19:17] Psalms 103 he forgiveth all our
[1:19:19] iniquities and he Health what
[1:19:23] all all of our diseases every one of
[1:19:26] them we're already healed and so we
[1:19:30] don't come to the Lord and pray Lord if
[1:19:32] it be your will to heal me no no no no
[1:19:35] no no he already declared in his word
[1:19:39] that you are already healed that's a
[1:19:41] declaration that's a law that's a
[1:19:43] principle just like gravity is not going
[1:19:46] to change now you might fast and pray
[1:19:48] and think you can fly and think you're a
[1:19:51] bird and you come jumping off of some
[1:19:53] building out here you going to fall
[1:19:55] right on your face because there's a law
[1:19:57] called
[1:19:59] gravity above the law of gravity is the
[1:20:02] word of God and God's word already
[1:20:04] declared to us that we are already
[1:20:08] healed and so we back up on it a little
[1:20:11] bit because you don't want to you know
[1:20:13] be embarrassed yeah I still got the
[1:20:15] symptoms and what if I don't get healed
[1:20:17] it's impossible you're already healed by
[1:20:21] his stripes we're already healed I
[1:20:24] Isaiah
[1:20:26] 53 says he was wounded for our
[1:20:29] transgressions bruised for our
[1:20:31] iniquities and by his stripes with his
[1:20:34] stripes we are healed that was uh 700
[1:20:39] years before Calvary ever happened so
[1:20:42] when was we healed when did this take
[1:20:44] place Isaiah declared it because it was
[1:20:47] the word of the Lord and then Calvary
[1:20:49] happened so we the believer we claim his
[1:20:54] promises and these promises is his word
[1:21:00] so what do we do uh my brothers my
[1:21:03] sisters what do we do we take the word
[1:21:06] of God and we know that the word of God
[1:21:09] is the will of God so it can't be like
[1:21:13] you know here he declares it in his word
[1:21:15] but I'm going to see if it's his will
[1:21:17] like out here over here in some feeling
[1:21:20] or some kind of emotion I'll see if it's
[1:21:21] the will of God over in the corner over
[1:21:23] here I'm going run over here and see if
[1:21:25] it's the will of God if he's already
[1:21:26] declared it in his word that is his will
[1:21:30] amen so when you find it in his word
[1:21:33] then you can say it before you feel
[1:21:36] anything see anything before anybody
[1:21:38] agrees with you before you can think it
[1:21:40] through you just say what the word says
[1:21:42] it's already settled in heaven amen amen
[1:21:46] am and so this
[1:21:49] healing brother random takes this now as
[1:21:53] I said I've embraced the internet and
[1:21:55] Technology to the
[1:21:56] fullest and uh so you should too so you
[1:22:00] should be able to take notes like nobody
[1:22:03] has ever taken notes in the history of
[1:22:05] the world because of the technology we
[1:22:07] have I'm not talking about foolishness
[1:22:09] I'm not talking about passing notes but
[1:22:12] I'm talking about taking something from
[1:22:15] the word that you can add to yourself
[1:22:19] and go feed on it again and read it
[1:22:23] again and and let it and then meditate
[1:22:25] on it as the scripture says and so this
[1:22:29] is one of those places many of you have
[1:22:32] heard this I'm going to refer to it it's
[1:22:34] this young lady that had she had got she
[1:22:37] was raised a Christian Deacon's daughter
[1:22:39] I think and then she got out in the Bad
[1:22:42] Company she started uh drinking someone
[1:22:46] put something in her drink and she rent
[1:22:47] down this terrible path in her morals
[1:22:51] and her life and she wanted to get
[1:22:53] recovered from that so she had been
[1:22:56] prayed for many times oil had been laid
[1:22:59] on oil been she's been Anointed with oil
[1:23:01] and it's in the message faith without
[1:23:04] works is dead
[1:23:06] 1950 I want you to go get that and hear
[1:23:08] the testimony I'm going to refer to it
[1:23:11] but when you go hear it for yourself
[1:23:14] it's going to it's going to bring you
[1:23:15] Faith because Faith cometh
[1:23:19] by hearing hearing what not the news not
[1:23:24] the news is not what everybody else is
[1:23:25] doing out there Faith cometh by hearing
[1:23:28] hearing by the word of God and so it's
[1:23:32] in that message faith without works is
[1:23:34] dead 1950 starting right around
[1:23:37] paragraph 33 those of you that would
[1:23:40] like to get that and brother randam is
[1:23:42] talking with her and then he brings her
[1:23:45] to the Altar and they go down and pray
[1:23:48] and then there the night Spirit comes on
[1:23:51] on them and she gets up and she says
[1:23:53] okay I'm good now I'm ready to go turn a
[1:23:57] new Leaf I'm ready to go and brother
[1:23:58] brand says no no it's not done yet that
[1:24:02] you're going to go back and do the same
[1:24:04] thing now her intentions were good her
[1:24:06] motives were good she wouldn't have came
[1:24:09] to the altar if she had bad intentions
[1:24:12] she didn't want this Spirit on her if
[1:24:14] you hear the conversation she didn't
[1:24:16] want to be that way and brother random
[1:24:19] explains to her and Faith cometh by
[1:24:21] hearing he says what you have on you is
[1:24:24] a
[1:24:25] devil and it's It Is possessing you to
[1:24:29] to make you do things you don't want to
[1:24:31] do and she said you know what I kind of
[1:24:34] always thought
[1:24:35] that and then like the light bulbs
[1:24:38] coming on now this is a devil that's
[1:24:40] making me do this so so stop it with
[1:24:44] making excuses it's a devil and I don't
[1:24:48] want a devil on me I want to go in the
[1:24:51] Rapture I want to be in part of the body
[1:24:54] change I want to go and live eternally
[1:24:57] and I don't want any demons Devils
[1:24:59] whatever on
[1:25:01] me so they go through this dialogue and
[1:25:03] then brother Brandon brings it here to
[1:25:05] paragraph
[1:25:08] 37 he
[1:25:14] says paragraph 35 says now look if
[1:25:17] you'll believe in the Lord and will pray
[1:25:20] she said I've done that brother I said
[1:25:22] I'm not talking about what you have done
[1:25:25] I mean now you just do as I tell you to
[1:25:28] do and you'll be free from that she says
[1:25:32] well can you free me I said no ma'am
[1:25:35] only Jesus Christ can free you she says
[1:25:39] well I've already come to him to give my
[1:25:41] life I said sister just a moment you
[1:25:44] just do as I tell you will you she said
[1:25:47] I said let's pray now and we got down
[1:25:50] and prayed she was crying she raised up
[1:25:53] a few minutes she said brother vom I'm
[1:25:56] going to go out tonight she says I'm
[1:25:59] going to try my best I says no you'll go
[1:26:01] right straight back again I said it's
[1:26:03] not over she says but I have I've done
[1:26:06] all that I know how to do I said but
[1:26:08] it's not yet sister it's got to be
[1:26:11] something to pull that nature from you
[1:26:15] and change you and she said well I
[1:26:18] prayed I've cried she began to cry and
[1:26:20] started out and so brother Adam goes a
[1:26:23] little bit further and you need to get
[1:26:25] that testimony I'll take paragraph
[1:26:28] 37 he says why by
[1:26:31] faith why the power of God that would
[1:26:34] change a prostitute to a saint a
[1:26:36] drunkard to a righteous woman why that
[1:26:40] by the same power will take any cancer
[1:26:45] deaf dumb blind for the same
[1:26:49] blood for the same man on the same day
[1:26:53] atone for your healing that atones for
[1:26:56] your salvation is that the truth he was
[1:27:00] wounded for our transgressions with the
[1:27:03] stripes you're healed The Blood Run
[1:27:06] exactly off the same man at the same day
[1:27:11] is that right so I want you to equate
[1:27:14] equate your salvation to your healing
[1:27:18] and any sickness or any ailment that
[1:27:22] would cause a disease or discomfort
[1:27:26] that's contrary to your original Health
[1:27:30] that God has provided for you if he
[1:27:33] saved you he's already healed you and
[1:27:37] this is the confidence I don't have any
[1:27:39] confidence that there's no con I don't
[1:27:41] have any you know there's no question
[1:27:42] about my salvation I know he saved me
[1:27:45] but then when it comes to Healing he
[1:27:47] like we kind of get we kind of lose it
[1:27:50] and healing is just a small exercise
[1:27:54] that we have to move into for the body
[1:27:56] change say brother Israel this is simple
[1:27:58] preaching you're talking about healing
[1:28:00] but I think that's where we're at this
[1:28:02] morning I think that's where we're at
[1:28:04] because you can't you can't you can't
[1:28:06] get into the deeper things if the
[1:28:09] Simplicity of him being your healer
[1:28:12] hasn't been established in your heart
[1:28:14] and you got to know that that is not my
[1:28:17] will not somebody else's will this is
[1:28:19] the will of God that you be completely
[1:28:23] healed
[1:28:26] now you can live your life and be saved
[1:28:30] and live underneath your PR Privileges
[1:28:33] and live under a sickness longer than
[1:28:36] you have to but that's not God's will
[1:28:38] for you and we'll get into there's times
[1:28:41] where like Paul he prayed to Lord to
[1:28:44] take this away but it was the will of
[1:28:46] God that that stayed in his life for a
[1:28:49] purpose and there's other places brother
[1:28:51] banam with his stomach you know that
[1:28:54] gift wasn't for him and there's places
[1:28:56] where you know God might allow a curse
[1:28:59] to be on someone and that's for a
[1:29:01] purpose for a period of time but
[1:29:04] generally speaking all sicknesses and
[1:29:08] diseases come from somewhere and when
[1:29:11] you know that it's not from heaven then
[1:29:15] you can take the promises of God now for
[1:29:18] some of you you you won't believe it but
[1:29:20] this is in the word it's all through the
[1:29:22] message it's people who don't even know
[1:29:24] know the message of the hour that have
[1:29:26] walked in this principle Tommy Osborne I
[1:29:29] was listening to his testimony he said
[1:29:31] the denominations didn't want him to go
[1:29:33] to brother Brand's meeting but his wife
[1:29:36] went anyway I think her name was Daisy
[1:29:38] Osborne she gives her testimony she saw
[1:29:41] the Miracles saw them singing the old
[1:29:43] hymns and she came back and told her
[1:29:45] husband and he went anyways outside of
[1:29:49] his his denomination told them not to
[1:29:51] not to have brother brandom so he went
[1:29:53] into the meeting there in Oregon and he
[1:29:55] says when he saw the signs wonders and
[1:29:58] miracles he said the voices like 10,000
[1:30:01] voices spoke to him it says you can do
[1:30:03] that you can do that you can how many
[1:30:05] heard this
[1:30:07] testimony it's on the
[1:30:11] internet okay it's
[1:30:15] available uh how many of you of I'm not
[1:30:19] I was going to bring up a latest show
[1:30:20] but I don't know any of them but many of
[1:30:23] you all know that
[1:30:25] the late what's the latest show somebody
[1:30:27] help
[1:30:30] me y'all
[1:30:33] smooth you all are very sharp okay you
[1:30:37] know what I'm saying if I if I blurted
[1:30:39] out the latest whatever people watch
[1:30:41] many of you all know that but this was
[1:30:43] associated with brother bram's Ministry
[1:30:45] and he said the Thousand 10,000 voices
[1:30:47] says you can do that you can do that you
[1:30:49] can do that and then you hear what
[1:30:51] brother brandham said about Tommy
[1:30:52] Osborne's Ministry
[1:30:54] without an angel and a gift in his life
[1:30:57] just simply taking the word of God on
[1:31:00] healing and thousands upon thousands of
[1:31:05] people were healed under this man's
[1:31:07] Ministry who doesn't have the seven seal
[1:31:10] who don't have 1200 tapes don't have
[1:31:12] prayer line after prayer line after
[1:31:14] prayer line of literal examples of folks
[1:31:17] being healed how should I be walking
[1:31:20] when it comes to Healing right amen amen
[1:31:24] so this word is what brings our healing
[1:31:29] it is the will of
[1:31:31] God I'll take a few scriptures for you
[1:31:34] talking about his word healing we s read
[1:31:38] it in Psalms 107 he sent his word and
[1:31:42] healed them and delivered them from
[1:31:45] their destructions Matthew
[1:31:49] 8 verses 8-10 the Centurion asks and
[1:31:52] says Lord I'm not worth worthy that thou
[1:31:54] sh come under my roof but speak the word
[1:31:58] only and my servant shall be healed I'm
[1:32:02] under Authority having soldiers under me
[1:32:05] I say this man go he go another one come
[1:32:08] he come and to my servant do this he
[1:32:10] doeth it when Jesus heard it he marveled
[1:32:13] and said to them that followed verily I
[1:32:15] say unto you I have not found what he
[1:32:18] call it so great of what faith not n
[1:32:22] what was his faith see faith without
[1:32:25] works is dead if you believe it then you
[1:32:30] will speak it if you believe it then
[1:32:34] you'll live it you'll go do it so you're
[1:32:37] not quoting one thing out here and
[1:32:39] leaving it out there if you believe it
[1:32:42] you will do it faith without works is
[1:32:45] dead Matthew 8 verse 16 it says they
[1:32:50] brought unto him many that were
[1:32:52] possessed with devils and he cast out
[1:32:54] the spirits with his word and healed all
[1:32:59] that were sick so he used his word to
[1:33:01] cast out Spirits he uses the word by the
[1:33:05] word my daughter will recover he sends
[1:33:09] his word and his word is his will his
[1:33:12] word is the law is what his ideas are
[1:33:16] about sicknesses and diseases all of
[1:33:19] them all of sicknesses all
[1:33:22] diseases now we know it is the will of
[1:33:25] God is that right
[1:33:27] Saints God's word is his
[1:33:32] will is it's it's in Mark 3:35 it says
[1:33:38] whosoever shall do the will of God the
[1:33:40] same as my brother my sister and my
[1:33:44] mother Acts
[1:33:46] 13:36 says that David he had served his
[1:33:49] own Generation by the will of God Romans
[1:33:54] 8:26 verse 28 says likewise the spirit
[1:33:58] also helpeth our infirmities for we know
[1:34:01] not what we should pray for as we ought
[1:34:04] but the spirit itself maketh
[1:34:06] intercession for us with groanings we
[1:34:10] think we know what we need to pray for
[1:34:11] but we don't know scripture says which
[1:34:13] cannot be uttered and he that searcheth
[1:34:16] the hearts knoweth what the mind of the
[1:34:20] spirit because he maketh intercession
[1:34:24] for the Saints according to
[1:34:27] what so he has a will and he's making
[1:34:31] intercession to the Saints according to
[1:34:34] his will and his will is his word
[1:34:36] according to the will of God and we know
[1:34:40] that all things work together for the
[1:34:41] good to them that love God to them who
[1:34:44] are the called according to his purpose
[1:34:47] Romans chap 12 verse number
[1:34:51] two it be not conformed to this world
[1:34:54] but be ye transformed by the renewing of
[1:34:56] your mind that you may prove what is the
[1:34:59] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[1:35:03] God there's um one see Corinthians
[1:35:07] Ephesians Colossians and Timothy Paul
[1:35:10] addresses himself or he closes his
[1:35:13] letter by saying Paul called to be an an
[1:35:17] apostle of Jesus Christ through the will
[1:35:20] of God so he knew he was an apostle
[1:35:23] through the will of God it was by the
[1:35:26] will of God that he was Apostle that's
[1:35:28] not boasting that's not bragging that's
[1:35:30] just saying what it is I'm an American
[1:35:33] citizen I'm not bragging I'm not
[1:35:35] boasting in fact I can say whatever I
[1:35:38] want to say if bragging and boasting is
[1:35:40] in my heart it doesn't matter what I say
[1:35:43] because the spirit is on me to be proud
[1:35:45] anyways and so I might say words that
[1:35:48] make me sound humble but I got the most
[1:35:50] proudful demon in my heart because I
[1:35:52] want to sound own humble it's always a
[1:35:55] heart issue and when Paul made the
[1:35:57] comment that he is an apostle by the
[1:36:01] will of God he knew where he was
[1:36:04] standing he knew his position in the
[1:36:07] scriptures he know that he was a son or
[1:36:10] a daughter of God and so do you and I
[1:36:14] have to know who we are and once we know
[1:36:16] who we are we know what the word of God
[1:36:18] says about us and then we say what the
[1:36:21] word say we don't even say what we feel
[1:36:24] we don't say what we think we don't get
[1:36:26] in the emotion of the moment we stay
[1:36:29] with the word of God and when we declare
[1:36:33] that it heavens and earth will pass away
[1:36:36] but it will never pass away
[1:36:39] amen Romans 8 Romans 12 all the
[1:36:45] scriptures all these Witnesses Galatians
[1:36:47] 1:4 says this who gave himself for our
[1:36:52] sins that he might Deliver Us from this
[1:36:54] present evil world according to the will
[1:36:58] of God and our
[1:37:00] father 1 Thessalonians 4
[1:37:04] 2-4 says this you want to note this one
[1:37:07] you want to take this one home with you
[1:37:09] says for we know that what Commandments
[1:37:12] we gave you by the Lord
[1:37:14] Jesus for this is the will of God even
[1:37:17] your sanctification that you should
[1:37:20] abstain from
[1:37:22] what from from fornication that every
[1:37:25] one of you should know how to possess
[1:37:29] his vessel in
[1:37:31] sanctification and honor so fornication
[1:37:35] is that talking about the body or the
[1:37:37] spirit or is it talking about
[1:37:39] both see fornication you can do that in
[1:37:43] your heart and this is what Jesus says
[1:37:46] he that lookth and lusted after a woman
[1:37:49] he's already committed fornication so
[1:37:51] there's a double commitment there when a
[1:37:54] man falls or a woman falls into
[1:37:56] fornication you sin against your body
[1:37:59] but in your spirit you can fornicate too
[1:38:02] and this is the whole man that God wants
[1:38:06] to heal it's not just you're not doing
[1:38:09] things wrong but we want to move over to
[1:38:11] where I'm not even thinking or Desiring
[1:38:14] to do what's wrong it's this inner man
[1:38:18] that we want healed from the bruises the
[1:38:20] scars and the unbelief it's the Inner
[1:38:23] Man and it's the whole man that God is
[1:38:25] taking with us into the Rapture the word
[1:38:28] of God is speaking to your inner man
[1:38:32] that the heart of a man will be molded
[1:38:35] into the image of go image of Christ
[1:38:39] that your desires desires would be pure
[1:38:42] they would be clean they would be
[1:38:45] healthy amen it's the will of God that
[1:38:49] you abstain from
[1:38:51] fornication so you don't have to leave
[1:38:53] your house you don't have to leave from
[1:38:55] the presence of your phone or tablet or
[1:38:59] whatever and this scripture has to be
[1:39:02] valid to you abstain from it all right 1
[1:39:06] Thessalonians 5:116 verse
[1:39:10] 18 says this Rejoice
[1:39:13] Evermore pray without
[1:39:15] ceasing in some things the good things
[1:39:19] the things you like give thanks is that
[1:39:21] what it says it says it
[1:39:24] everything and everything give thanks
[1:39:27] why why should I give thanks for this is
[1:39:31] the will of God that's not somebody's
[1:39:34] idea on what you how you should be
[1:39:37] positively think about this and how you
[1:39:39] should do it's the will of
[1:39:42] God that you give thanks in everything
[1:39:46] Hebrews
[1:39:47] 10:36 says this after you you need need
[1:39:51] patience after you have done the will of
[1:39:54] God so now let's get into this just for
[1:39:57] a moment all right I just take uh I
[1:40:00] won't go long this morning
[1:40:03] okay amen and so you know what I really
[1:40:06] don't go long am I a long with it
[1:40:08] preacher thank you so stop it putting
[1:40:13] that long wited preacher look on me I'm
[1:40:15] I never preach long I always stop before
[1:40:19] I should one of these days I'm going to
[1:40:21] do a two-hour sermon and I'm going to do
[1:40:23] it on on purpose and I'm going to take
[1:40:25] names and take
[1:40:27] notes I'll come see you for dinner all
[1:40:32] right all right
[1:40:35] okay the word of God says this here's
[1:40:38] what brother Ram says and who hath
[1:40:39] believe our report 1951 he says this
[1:40:42] here paragraph number 20 no no I'm sorry
[1:40:44] this is the ministry explained in 1950
[1:40:48] he says this here paragraph number 20
[1:40:51] first we must be sure
[1:40:54] that it is that it's the will of God to
[1:40:56] heal we ought to take some time on that
[1:41:00] in the meetings which the managers
[1:41:02] probably will upon the will of God to
[1:41:05] heal how Jesus died to heal how that
[1:41:09] commission was given first to heal the
[1:41:12] first thing he said when he sent out his
[1:41:15] disciples heal the sick cleans the
[1:41:17] lepers raise the dead freely as you
[1:41:20] receive freely give that was his first
[1:41:22] Commission
[1:41:23] Matthew 10 Mark 16 the last commission
[1:41:27] he said go into all the world and preach
[1:41:29] the gospel he that believeth and is
[1:41:32] baptized shall be saved these signs
[1:41:35] shall follow them that believe why all
[1:41:38] the world in my name they shall cast out
[1:41:41] Devils they'll speak with new tongues
[1:41:44] they'll take up serpents or drink deadly
[1:41:46] things shall not harm them and if they
[1:41:49] lay their hands on the sick they shall
[1:41:51] recover
[1:41:53] what's the matter is we Christians get
[1:41:57] too weak when it comes to The
[1:42:00] Showdown if it's real it's real if it's
[1:42:05] not it's not and if I didn't believe him
[1:42:09] with all my heart and know it was real I
[1:42:12] wouldn't I would not be here tonight but
[1:42:15] I believe it and not only that I know
[1:42:17] it's real see and I've seen it over
[1:42:21] thousands of places so how do you you
[1:42:23] increase your strength in this you take
[1:42:25] these promises and you start exercising
[1:42:28] them every
[1:42:29] day you start claiming those promises
[1:42:33] every day you get the scriptures you
[1:42:35] start reading them read them out loud
[1:42:37] Faith comth by hearing it don't come by
[1:42:39] no other way faith comes by hearing the
[1:42:41] word of the lord your intentions might
[1:42:43] be good you might emotionally be
[1:42:45] connected to wanting these things to
[1:42:47] happen but it's not going to happen
[1:42:49] until you hear the word of God and many
[1:42:52] times you have to be the one speaking
[1:42:54] it you spend more time with yourself
[1:42:58] than probably you spend here at church
[1:43:00] or hearing it preach and more times than
[1:43:02] not you're in a walk between you and the
[1:43:04] Lord and you have to internalize the
[1:43:06] word of God for yourself you can't wait
[1:43:10] for other people to agree with you you
[1:43:13] can't wait till other people start doing
[1:43:15] it and then you start doing it if he's a
[1:43:18] Healer he is actually your healer and
[1:43:22] when you're sick in your body you claim
[1:43:24] those
[1:43:26] promises more times than not we have
[1:43:28] more faith in the doctors or more faith
[1:43:31] in the prescription or the drugs that
[1:43:33] are out there when God already declared
[1:43:36] in his word before anybody ever gave any
[1:43:39] kind of medication or anything I'm the
[1:43:42] Lord that heals all thy diseases all of
[1:43:47] them he's the Healer of your
[1:43:51] body amen and he heals your
[1:43:55] soul it's the will of
[1:43:58] God anybody says we Christians are weak
[1:44:02] who hath believed our report 1951 he
[1:44:05] says this
[1:44:10] here paragraph number six six the spirit
[1:44:13] of the Lord come into the audience and
[1:44:16] just sap my strength and just as I
[1:44:18] started to go down my brother run to me
[1:44:20] to catch me and I looked I seen
[1:44:23] Congressman Upshaw and he been in my
[1:44:25] meetings since he was a lad when I first
[1:44:29] when he first fell and hurt himself he
[1:44:31] wanted to be healed then by
[1:44:34] God he he'd been in meetings ever since
[1:44:38] he was aad when he first fell and hurt
[1:44:41] himself he wanted to be healed then by
[1:44:43] God he listened to Mr Roberts he been
[1:44:46] with Mr Freeman's meetings Mr Ogle be
[1:44:50] and many of them had prayed for him
[1:44:54] friends I've got something to say along
[1:44:56] them lines after a bit no matter how
[1:44:59] much Faith you have it'll never change
[1:45:03] the
[1:45:04] predestinated will of God it's got to be
[1:45:08] by Vision to see what happens so here
[1:45:12] the prophet of God brings to us the
[1:45:15] predestinated will of
[1:45:18] God it's got to be by that so here's
[1:45:21] Congressman of Shaw and here's a one of
[1:45:23] these cases he desired to be healed all
[1:45:27] of his life all of his life and the Lord
[1:45:29] refrained from that he had a purpose
[1:45:31] behind it uh sister Hattie writes Edith
[1:45:34] right she never fully received her
[1:45:36] healing there is a reason and and
[1:45:38] brother R says the Lord didn't reveal to
[1:45:40] him the reason but you know and some
[1:45:43] people say well look she was never
[1:45:45] healed but and use that as an example
[1:45:47] but look at the tens of thousands that
[1:45:49] came and were healed so if you're going
[1:45:52] to weigh out the evidence let's be fair
[1:45:55] there's far more
[1:45:57] healed than those that are not healed by
[1:46:00] trusting in the Lord and the
[1:46:03] scriptures amen and we have to Proclaim
[1:46:07] that and declare it and believe it with
[1:46:09] all our heart brother brandham continues
[1:46:12] on in this will of God he says faith the
[1:46:16] Africa trip report 1952 he says I
[1:46:19] believe it's written in the scripture
[1:46:21] one of the writers says above all things
[1:46:24] I would that you would prosper in health
[1:46:27] and I pray that God will let every sick
[1:46:30] person in here tonight be well I'm sure
[1:46:36] it's the will of God that all of you
[1:46:39] would be well he wants you to be well if
[1:46:43] you and I can only have faith if we just
[1:46:47] sometimes wonder what that great article
[1:46:49] Faith what it is you know to my surprise
[1:46:52] I say this with reverence in my heart
[1:46:54] fearing lest I would say something wrong
[1:46:56] I find that about 80% of the people say
[1:47:00] they believe just has hope instead of
[1:47:04] faith faith is just so sure it's
[1:47:09] positive it never moves it just got to
[1:47:12] be faith is an element it's a sense it's
[1:47:17] the six sense of the human body it's the
[1:47:19] one sense the human soul has two senses
[1:47:23] part of the man that's his five senses
[1:47:26] to control the human body see taste feel
[1:47:28] smell here and the inward man has two
[1:47:31] senses that's Faith unbelief one of them
[1:47:37] governs amen so this is this is the the
[1:47:42] man that that makes us this is what
[1:47:45] motivates us this is who we are today I
[1:47:49] see you in your body but there's a
[1:47:51] spiritual man in you to too and that
[1:47:54] spiritual man is governed by faith or
[1:47:58] doubt I mean what are we thinking do we
[1:48:01] think the Rapture and coming into the
[1:48:03] body change is going to be um you know I
[1:48:07] haven't believed all these years and all
[1:48:09] of a sudden out of nowhere I'm going to
[1:48:12] somehow believe no it never happens that
[1:48:15] way you you believe God right here and
[1:48:18] then he causes your faith to grow even
[1:48:21] more and then you exercise that faith
[1:48:24] and then your faith is put to the test
[1:48:27] just like our a this age is putting our
[1:48:29] faith to the test like we say we believe
[1:48:32] every word and then things happen and
[1:48:34] people do things that's contrary to the
[1:48:36] word then you have to make a decision
[1:48:39] and that's challenging your faith do you
[1:48:42] really believe every word and this is
[1:48:44] what brother bam talks about in The
[1:48:47] Showdown many Christians are
[1:48:50] weak and it's sad but but his word is
[1:48:55] there to heal us this morning is there
[1:48:57] to bring us up to that next level of
[1:49:01] believing that all things are possible
[1:49:04] if we have a problem believing in Divine
[1:49:07] Healing I mean we would have a problem
[1:49:09] believing because everything that we
[1:49:11] receive from God Is by faith and Divine
[1:49:14] Healing is just the minor the the
[1:49:16] medical field knows that there's people
[1:49:18] that heal through herbs and they heal
[1:49:20] through you know being nice and through
[1:49:23] love and through you know showing
[1:49:25] kindness and getting someone to believe
[1:49:28] in you and people have been healed by
[1:49:31] that what about us that have the word of
[1:49:34] the Lord amen healing is the children's
[1:49:39] bread this
[1:49:41] morning and so it's the will of God it's
[1:49:44] in the word of God it's his will it's
[1:49:47] his perfect will to heal but now he
[1:49:50] brings in these details brother brandham
[1:49:53] does about the predestinated will of God
[1:49:56] and how you have to know what God is
[1:49:59] doing and and and he goes further and he
[1:50:02] says this here in the Africa trip report
[1:50:05] he says this here um I'm sorry in the
[1:50:08] message Elijah paragraph
[1:50:12] number
[1:50:14] 10 says we're speaking tonight about
[1:50:16] Elijah and making it a preview of our
[1:50:19] prayer meeting coming now Elijah was a
[1:50:22] man many many times when someone speaks
[1:50:24] of a man like Elijah they would expect
[1:50:27] him to be a great angel or some sort of
[1:50:29] a sainted person that was dropped out of
[1:50:31] Heaven the but the Bible said he was a
[1:50:34] man subject to like passions as we are
[1:50:38] he has his ups and downs his trials his
[1:50:43] indifference but he prayed earnestly
[1:50:46] that it wouldn't rain and it didn't rain
[1:50:48] for 3 years and 6 months and after 3
[1:50:51] years 6 months he prayed again in the
[1:50:54] heavens gave rain now he was a man just
[1:50:58] like we are not an
[1:50:59] angel not no more than what you or I he
[1:51:04] had his differences and things his ups
[1:51:06] and downs in life his life like we do
[1:51:10] but God answered his prayer because he
[1:51:13] prayed earnestly and
[1:51:16] sincerely and before that kind of a
[1:51:18] prayer can be made for sick or for the
[1:51:20] end of a drought for anything that we
[1:51:23] have need of there must be a perfect
[1:51:26] understanding that we're praying in the
[1:51:29] will of
[1:51:30] God that's the reason he can close the
[1:51:33] heavens that it didn't rain because God
[1:51:36] had told him it was going to happen so
[1:51:39] it's easy to say anything's going to
[1:51:41] happen when God says it's going to
[1:51:44] happen because it's got to be that way
[1:51:47] God's word cannot fail so
[1:51:52] Elijah's Vision now becomes the word of
[1:51:55] the
[1:51:56] Lord and he has faith in it so Faith
[1:52:00] Works a bit like this it's contagious
[1:52:04] it's called
[1:52:05] influence and so is fear very influenced
[1:52:10] people follow and and fear you know is
[1:52:14] taught to people many times and and many
[1:52:17] times you you're working with people
[1:52:19] that are fearful and Afraid and the
[1:52:21] things of God God they will damage your
[1:52:24] faith can hinder your faith and this is
[1:52:27] why in the Old Testament all them going
[1:52:29] into battle he told them to fear not and
[1:52:31] if you are fear stay at home because
[1:52:34] it's not a question of you just being
[1:52:35] afraid somebody might lose their life
[1:52:38] that's how serious it is it's not a
[1:52:40] question that you know this is just you
[1:52:42] no your negativity and your fear might
[1:52:46] cause someone to lose like majorly lose
[1:52:52] so we're in the Battleground we're in
[1:52:54] the we're in the battle of the greatest
[1:52:57] battle ever fought and this is the time
[1:53:01] that we have to really um take into
[1:53:05] consideration you know the things that
[1:53:07] we speak the way we pray the way we go
[1:53:10] about and conduct ourselves you know the
[1:53:14] other people are watching us how we
[1:53:16] handle the word and other people are are
[1:53:19] watching how we conduct ourselves we
[1:53:22] influence
[1:53:24] others and you know with this
[1:53:29] healing it goes even further from years
[1:53:32] ago some of you may remember years and
[1:53:34] years ago I did a study I did a message
[1:53:37] preached a message on God is no
[1:53:39] respector of persons and how in that
[1:53:43] message that the scripture says that he
[1:53:46] treats Every Nation the same he's no
[1:53:48] respector of persons if a man turns to
[1:53:50] God he will heal them he will save them
[1:53:52] he'll deliver them and in that message
[1:53:56] you'll notice sister Georgie Carter when
[1:53:59] she was calling for healing she was a
[1:54:01] little lamb caught up in miltown she had
[1:54:05] got a hold of a little book Jesus Christ
[1:54:08] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:54:10] in that book there was another little
[1:54:12] girl the male girl that was healed now
[1:54:15] she's in a church that didn't believe
[1:54:18] but she got a hold of this book that
[1:54:20] this little girl was healed K and here
[1:54:23] she was 9 years old on her bed of
[1:54:26] Affliction in a church that didn't
[1:54:28] believe her family didn't believe but
[1:54:30] she got a hold of this book that Jesus
[1:54:33] Christ healed this other girl that she
[1:54:35] never saw and Faith cometh by what and
[1:54:39] you don't even it could just be a
[1:54:41] testimony that you heard and she be to
[1:54:45] cry out to God for healing and while
[1:54:48] she's calling for healing God in his
[1:54:51] mercy and Grace sends a vision to the
[1:54:54] prophet and in the vision he sees a
[1:54:57] little lamb crying he didn't know her
[1:54:59] name didn't know who she was he just
[1:55:01] sees a little lamb in mil toown so he
[1:55:03] goes to the town he's trying to find her
[1:55:06] who is this and he has a Revival people
[1:55:09] get saved brother Hall gets saved
[1:55:11] establishes a church he's still trying
[1:55:13] to find and and then he gets into prayer
[1:55:16] real deep prayer and the Holy Spirit
[1:55:18] tells him to go to the Carter's home and
[1:55:22] when he gets to the Carter's home he
[1:55:24] said it was then that the Lord revealed
[1:55:25] to him I know who you
[1:55:28] are you're that lamb I saw caught up in
[1:55:33] this you know the you know this
[1:55:39] unbelief Rise Up from your
[1:55:42] bed and the devil said no you she can't
[1:55:44] rise she's been sick nine years it's
[1:55:46] never happened her church don't believe
[1:55:48] this one doesn't believe rise up
[1:55:50] anyways why because Faith cometh by
[1:55:53] hearing now she didn't maybe have
[1:55:56] examples in her church she didn't have
[1:55:58] an atmosphere of people patter her on
[1:55:59] her back come on Georgie she didn't have
[1:56:02] anything else other than a testimony
[1:56:05] that somebody else was healed and if God
[1:56:08] will do it for one person he will do it
[1:56:11] for another all you got to do is find
[1:56:13] how God ever acted throughout human
[1:56:17] history find one case when you find that
[1:56:20] case you can attach your Faith to that
[1:56:23] and say Lord you did it over here now do
[1:56:26] it over
[1:56:28] here absolutely cuz he's no respector of
[1:56:31] person so it's
[1:56:34] influenceable it
[1:56:36] spreads you just got to find it if God
[1:56:39] can can save and you know and deliver
[1:56:42] you know the next brother's family and
[1:56:45] you have faith and you believe he'll do
[1:56:46] that for your family say well my
[1:56:48] family's all Renegades they all don't
[1:56:50] say that out loud my family did this my
[1:56:53] family find an example somewhere find
[1:56:55] someone in the scripture take Rahab to
[1:56:58] harlot find something in the scriptures
[1:57:00] or somebody in your congregation or
[1:57:03] somebody in Canada or somebody that's
[1:57:05] around the message somewhere where God
[1:57:08] moved on their behalf then grab it and
[1:57:12] say Lord if you did it for them you can
[1:57:14] do it for me too that's our
[1:57:16] faith and it's just the elementary
[1:57:20] portion of believing but it's not so
[1:57:23] Elementary today but he equates it right
[1:57:26] with
[1:57:27] iniquities and
[1:57:30] diseases he deals with them both in the
[1:57:34] same the same blood the same scripture
[1:57:38] the same event deals with it so let's go
[1:57:40] into the will of God a little bit more
[1:57:42] take a little bit more time here
[1:57:44] paragraph 47 and how the angel come to
[1:57:47] me watch how brother Anna handles this
[1:57:50] here he says and you're watch on the
[1:57:51] platform form you seldom hear me say
[1:57:55] anything about I cast out this devil I
[1:57:59] have to see first whether it's the will
[1:58:01] of God to do that first I'll pray for
[1:58:06] the person but never call over that
[1:58:10] demon continues on paragraph 49 same
[1:58:13] message now you see what I mean that's
[1:58:15] the reason I go easy I watch what I'm
[1:58:17] doing once God puts something on
[1:58:19] somebody if God didn't put it on on
[1:58:22] there he permitted Satan to do it to put
[1:58:25] the curse on the person because of
[1:58:28] something he's trying to do so you see
[1:58:30] the context
[1:58:32] there are you with me this morning do
[1:58:34] you see the there's a context on why God
[1:58:37] allows sicknesses and diseases on one
[1:58:40] and maybe not the other and so instead
[1:58:42] of you thinking well brother so and so
[1:58:45] had the same sickness he had to go in
[1:58:48] and go through the treatment you know so
[1:58:50] I got the same thing brother so and so
[1:58:51] has I got to go through who told you
[1:58:53] that you know the scripture says he's
[1:58:55] the Lord that heals all diseases and I'm
[1:58:58] not brother so and so but I can take the
[1:59:01] scriptures for my sickness and claim my
[1:59:05] healing how many can say Amen to that
[1:59:08] otherwise we all sick we all follow one
[1:59:10] another it'd be great if we all be
[1:59:12] getting healed and we all follow one
[1:59:14] another how about
[1:59:17] that and so brother manam brings this
[1:59:20] context in casting out devil
[1:59:23] that you know there's a reason why he's
[1:59:25] got to watch he doesn't curse or
[1:59:27] something that God put on the man you
[1:59:29] can get in trouble by doing that he says
[1:59:32] so that's the reason that I go easy I
[1:59:34] watch what I'm doing when I find the
[1:59:36] will of God then I know where I'm
[1:59:38] setting my foot but until I know the
[1:59:41] will of God now I'm not condemning
[1:59:44] people who doesn't that God don't hold
[1:59:47] them responsible if they don't know
[1:59:50] that's exactly right they're just is
[1:59:52] doing what they can but that's the
[1:59:54] reason I go very easy and watch what I'm
[1:59:57] doing you understand now all right jerus
[2:00:01] and Divine Healing so I'm bringing these
[2:00:04] the context the balance on Divine
[2:00:06] Healing you say brother Israel all
[2:00:08] sicknesses you know he heals all
[2:00:10] diseases so nobody in our church should
[2:00:13] ever be sick well that's a good
[2:00:16] start if we're going to error on
[2:00:19] something that's a great start and you
[2:00:22] let the let down happen later but let's
[2:00:25] say you know that's out of balance like
[2:00:27] nobody ever will get sick everybody sh
[2:00:30] at all times should always be healed and
[2:00:33] if there's any sickness it's because
[2:00:35] they got some sin in their life well
[2:00:37] these are some of the details as why
[2:00:40] there is sickness and why it lingers
[2:00:43] because God has a purpose and a plan and
[2:00:46] he uses that sometimes to correct his
[2:00:50] children and he has other reasons that
[2:00:53] he uses or allows sickness to
[2:00:57] linger like the children of in Israel
[2:00:59] were in bondage all those years there
[2:01:02] was a reason for
[2:01:04] it so brother bandom takes us a little
[2:01:07] bit further inuus and Divine
[2:01:11] Healing paragraph s he says for instance
[2:01:15] let me see I'll take a little time here
[2:01:18] going yeah paragraph s he says this for
[2:01:21] instance like Comm man going goes
[2:01:23] overseas let's stop here just a minute
[2:01:26] we're going overseas and we get in the
[2:01:28] ship now the man that really runs the
[2:01:31] ship goes down in the bowels of the ship
[2:01:33] the
[2:01:34] engineer but he takes orders from this
[2:01:36] man
[2:01:37] upstairs well what if he gives orders
[2:01:40] two knots to the left and the man down
[2:01:42] in here turns two knots to the right he
[2:01:46] said straight ahead and then the man
[2:01:48] down here ships runs backwards but see
[2:01:52] they've got to get in harmony see you've
[2:01:56] got to be or the ship Will Never Move
[2:01:59] well now many people has hope and cus it
[2:02:03] Faith but now when God says a certain
[2:02:06] thing and you say a certain uh the same
[2:02:09] thing and down here it says the same
[2:02:12] thing something's going to happen you
[2:02:15] see when it gets all
[2:02:18] together but then the ship will move the
[2:02:21] Lord will will move but you've got to be
[2:02:23] in perfectly in harmony with the will of
[2:02:27] God the word of God your subc conscience
[2:02:30] you're real your first conscience with
[2:02:33] the spirit of God all that moving
[2:02:36] together and everything just clears the
[2:02:38] way and you move out you've got to do
[2:02:41] that amen so brother banam is showing us
[2:02:46] those three elements though you know you
[2:02:48] got the man down in your subconscious
[2:02:51] you have your mind saying one thing and
[2:02:53] you want all that moving in Harmony and
[2:02:56] you could pray for that God move me in
[2:02:59] harmony with your word let my
[2:03:01] subconscious be really connected to the
[2:03:04] word of God and how can I achieve that
[2:03:08] if I'm pumping my conscience in with
[2:03:12] what Hollywood has it's just very very
[2:03:15] difficult you're conflicting yourself
[2:03:17] and so God has provided his way brother
[2:03:19] vom says this here
[2:03:23] Israel when they were down in Egypt they
[2:03:25] were in bondage and in trouble and they
[2:03:27] begin to cry for God for deliverance
[2:03:29] notice the way God will provide is when
[2:03:32] we're in God's
[2:03:34] word Israel had God's word that they
[2:03:36] were going out of there someday so they
[2:03:40] went to crying to God according to the
[2:03:42] will of God for God to provide what he
[2:03:44] had promised to do there you are you're
[2:03:47] praying for something that's out of the
[2:03:50] will of God you can't have faith for it
[2:03:54] but when God promises anything I believe
[2:03:57] that he'll keep his word so they knew
[2:04:00] that's the reason Abraham knew that God
[2:04:02] was going to deliver him somehow because
[2:04:04] he had promised that through Isaac all
[2:04:08] nations in the world will be blessed the
[2:04:11] children of Israel down in Egypt they
[2:04:13] knew God had promised them Deliverance
[2:04:15] so they went to praying for the promise
[2:04:19] so you see that you take the promises of
[2:04:21] healing this is what God says about it
[2:04:24] and then you go to pray for that healing
[2:04:26] to be manifested in you because that is
[2:04:29] the will of God that you're praying for
[2:04:32] you're not praying for something outside
[2:04:35] of his will amen can I get a witness
[2:04:38] that's for your family that's not
[2:04:40] outside of his will that's for your
[2:04:43] healing that's for deliverance you're
[2:04:45] praying in the will of God then and then
[2:04:49] you can have faith for what you're
[2:04:51] praying for
[2:04:52] and then don't be discouraged stay with
[2:04:54] it and God will bring it to pass
[2:04:57] amen he that is in you he says this in
[2:05:01] paragraph 173 where many of our Brethren
[2:05:04] gets
[2:05:05] excited they get impressed that God says
[2:05:09] do a certain thing they say it's thus
[2:05:11] say the Lord when it isn't that's the
[2:05:13] reason it don't happen but when it's God
[2:05:17] really telling you it's got to happen
[2:05:20] it's got to be that way see when God
[2:05:22] speaks it it has to
[2:05:25] be so we don't have that problem when we
[2:05:28] find the words of the Lord in our Bible
[2:05:31] amen the word that God says about
[2:05:35] it is in his word his word is what heals
[2:05:40] the people now this health that the
[2:05:45] Lord wishes that we'd all would prosper
[2:05:48] and be in health John 31 verse vers two
[2:05:52] says behold beloved I wish above all
[2:05:55] things that thou mayest prosper and be
[2:05:59] in health even as thy Soul Prosper so we
[2:06:03] think of Health most of the time or many
[2:06:07] times as the health in our
[2:06:09] body but really the Divine Health that
[2:06:12] we want is the real you to be
[2:06:16] healthy where your spirit is whole where
[2:06:20] your spirit is has been
[2:06:22] healed where the Lord has touched your
[2:06:25] inner man and you're walking in his
[2:06:29] perfect plan and his purpose for your
[2:06:31] life and Psalms 4211 says this why art
[2:06:36] thou cast down oh my soul why art thou
[2:06:40] disquieted within me hope thou in God
[2:06:44] for I shall yet praise him who is the
[2:06:47] health of my countenance and my God say
[2:06:51] Lord Heal My countenance first not just
[2:06:55] my body heal the out heal my the the way
[2:06:58] I conduct and carry myself and some of
[2:07:03] us need that all of us need it at one
[2:07:05] point some of us need it right now some
[2:07:07] of us definitely need our countenance
[2:07:11] our you know the energy that we are
[2:07:15] possessing that we move in Lord Heal Me
[2:07:18] There Psalms 43:5 says why are thou cast
[2:07:21] down on on my soul why art thou disqui
[2:07:25] within me kind of a repeat hope in God
[2:07:28] for I shall yet praise him who is the
[2:07:30] health of my countenance my
[2:07:33] God Proverbs 4:20 ver 23 says my son
[2:07:37] attend to my words incline thine ear
[2:07:41] unto my sayings let them not depart from
[2:07:44] Thine Eyes keep them in the midst of
[2:07:47] thine heart for they are life unto those
[2:07:49] that find them and Health to all their
[2:07:53] flesh keep thy heart with all diligence
[2:07:56] for out of it are the issues of
[2:08:00] Life Proverbs 12:18 tells us there is
[2:08:04] that speaketh like a piercing of a sword
[2:08:07] but the tongue of the wise is
[2:08:11] Health pleasant words are the Proverbs
[2:08:14] thir Proverbs 16:24 tells us pleasant
[2:08:17] words are as a honeycomb sweet to the
[2:08:21] soul
[2:08:22] and health to the
[2:08:23] bones Jeremiah 8:22 is there no bomb in
[2:08:27] Gilead is there no physician there why
[2:08:31] then is not the health of the daughter
[2:08:33] of my people
[2:08:36] recovered Jeremiah 317 says for I will
[2:08:40] restore Health unto thee and I will heal
[2:08:44] thee of thy wounds sayeth the Lord
[2:08:47] because th called thee because they
[2:08:50] called thee an outcast saying this is
[2:08:52] Zion whom no man seeketh after Jeremiah
[2:08:57] 33:6 tells us behold I will bring it
[2:09:02] health and cure I will cure them and
[2:09:06] will reveal unto them the abundance of
[2:09:10] peace and
[2:09:12] Truth beloved I wish above all things
[2:09:17] John 3 veres 1 and 2 3rd John 1- 2
[2:09:20] beloved I wish above all things that
[2:09:24] thou mayest prosper and be in health
[2:09:29] even as thy Soul prospereth if you take
[2:09:32] that word health and prosper you'll see
[2:09:36] that it's connected with
[2:09:40] praise in a few of those songs
[2:09:43] Psalms there's a a quotation is very
[2:09:46] short I don't think I gave it to you all
[2:09:48] in the back but brother rer makes this
[2:09:50] statement that the quote here he says
[2:09:52] take God at his word start thanking him
[2:09:55] for it amen praise him until it comes so
[2:10:01] there's a there's a health in the praise
[2:10:05] because your praise is according to the
[2:10:08] word your praise is like the Lord is
[2:10:11] good his mercy endureth forever I Praise
[2:10:13] You Lord because you're my salvation
[2:10:16] you're my strength you're the Healer of
[2:10:18] my body you're the Healer of of my
[2:10:21] family you're the Healer of all my
[2:10:24] issues you're the Healer I praise you I
[2:10:27] lift my hands I give you praise now
[2:10:29] that's healthy that's healthy talk
[2:10:32] that's Health to your bones that makes a
[2:10:36] better you that makes a better man a a
[2:10:38] lot of the Deliverance is in the praise
[2:10:40] and we miss that the praise service
[2:10:43] comes on we looking around arms folded
[2:10:46] won't say a peep but your words are in
[2:10:50] your words there's Health out of the
[2:10:52] mouth of the just there's a there's a
[2:10:55] blessing when you start to take the
[2:10:58] words of the Lord and it comes out in
[2:11:00] praise it brings health to the bones and
[2:11:04] this is the will of God
[2:11:07] now where does sickness and disease come
[2:11:10] from my time is
[2:11:12] going but brother banam makes this
[2:11:15] statement now first I'll read the
[2:11:17] scripture for you and I'm GNA close on
[2:11:19] this but I'm gonna read this scripture
[2:11:21] and second Timothy chapter 1 and verse
[2:11:25] 7 if they get it on the screen then you
[2:11:27] can see
[2:11:29] it and it says this that for God had not
[2:11:32] given us the spirit of fear but of power
[2:11:38] and of love and of a sound
[2:11:41] mind so the spirit of fear and fear is
[2:11:46] the spirit we know that the spirit of
[2:11:49] fear God didn't give it to you
[2:11:51] it came from
[2:11:53] somewhere and brother bman goes forward
[2:11:55] in the message enticing spirits and he
[2:11:58] makes this statement and this is a
[2:12:00] powerful one and I know I don't I knew I
[2:12:02] wouldn't have time to get into it so I'm
[2:12:04] I'm reserving I reserved it for my last
[2:12:07] portion of quotes but he deals with the
[2:12:12] fourth dimension diseases how diseases
[2:12:14] come from
[2:12:16] there and it really it really uh shows
[2:12:20] you
[2:12:22] that um it's much greater than the
[2:12:25] sickness in your body there's a sickness
[2:12:28] in the soul that's the really the part
[2:12:32] of you that needs to get
[2:12:33] healed you know and I'm going to read
[2:12:35] for you here brother Bram says here in
[2:12:37] enticing Spirits paragraph 38 now we've
[2:12:41] applied it in healing service always to
[2:12:43] the healing side cancer tumor cataract
[2:12:48] tuberculosis and all these things are
[2:12:50] not natural
[2:12:51] things they are
[2:12:54] Supernatural and are
[2:12:57] demons the scripture plainly vindicates
[2:13:00] that but that is demons in the body
[2:13:04] which with growths like cancer got life
[2:13:08] in it and the life of that is a demon
[2:13:11] growth of a c cataract the spread of
[2:13:14] tuberculosis other diseases it's demons
[2:13:18] that's in physical form now this morning
[2:13:21] we're going to talk about demons in
[2:13:24] spiritual form in the soul they're in
[2:13:27] the soul the same as they're in the body
[2:13:31] and we're bound to admit that we see
[2:13:34] them in people's body such as cancers
[2:13:36] and different diseases that's in the
[2:13:38] human body just recently even cancer has
[2:13:41] been declared to be a fourth dimension
[2:13:45] disease that's it's in another
[2:13:48] dimension sure it's
[2:13:52] demonology every disease is a fourth
[2:13:54] dimension disease the beginning of
[2:13:57] it now but now cancer in the body or
[2:14:01] cancer in the
[2:14:03] soul the demon can come in either
[2:14:07] place now there's many times and many
[2:14:09] people with good thoughts good people
[2:14:11] who try many times to rest upon some
[2:14:15] little theology they have or something
[2:14:17] they have been taught since a child and
[2:14:20] still find that down in their being down
[2:14:23] in their soul that they still have
[2:14:26] something that's not right you uh you
[2:14:30] men many are here this morning no doubt
[2:14:33] wherever you find Christians gathered
[2:14:36] together you find people who has those
[2:14:39] Spirits in them it's
[2:14:42] undesirable they don't want them they
[2:14:44] say oh if I can only quit lying if I can
[2:14:46] only quit lusting if I can only quit
[2:14:49] this or that now that is devil s and now
[2:14:51] they come in the form of religion many
[2:14:54] times being at Sunday school it's time
[2:14:56] of teaching so let's look into this now
[2:14:59] they come in the form of religion many
[2:15:02] times so that's pretty
[2:15:05] strong that's pretty strong cancer in
[2:15:09] the
[2:15:10] soul have you ever heard that term that
[2:15:13] he's a cancer on this
[2:15:16] job or she's a cancer in the
[2:15:19] family are they are can they're becoming
[2:15:22] a cancer you know it's talking on a on a
[2:15:25] spiritual level there but he's he's my
[2:15:29] healer he's our healer he's the Healer
[2:15:33] of all our diseases in our body and in
[2:15:38] the soul and I would submit to you that
[2:15:41] getting the healing in your soul is the
[2:15:44] most important healing that can take
[2:15:45] place to you and that comes by the holy
[2:15:49] spirit that comes by a will willing
[2:15:51] heart to take God at his word what does
[2:15:55] his word say about being born again what
[2:15:58] does he say about the new man in the
[2:16:00] heart what does he say about him
[2:16:03] delivering you from the former things of
[2:16:06] the world that darkness and bringing you
[2:16:09] over into the Kingdom of Light what does
[2:16:11] the word say about it these are the
[2:16:13] promises is that we that we um that we
[2:16:17] claim and we ask God for the heal
[2:16:20] healing right there right in there and
[2:16:23] he's our healer today and we thank God
[2:16:26] for it and he
[2:16:29] is he is the
[2:16:33] health to our bones he's
[2:16:36] Health naturally he's Health spiritually
[2:16:40] and it was his great desire that we
[2:16:42] would prosper in our
[2:16:46] health we prosper and also prosper in
[2:16:49] our health how me thank the Lord for
[2:16:52] that he is our
[2:16:55] healer he's the Healer of the whole man
[2:16:57] and that's the
[2:16:59] man that his word heals us by that so
[2:17:04] God bless you richly let's bow our heads
[2:17:06] the musicians
[2:17:14] come you remember the word of the Lord
[2:17:21] it's nigh thee it's in your
[2:17:23] heart it's in your mind it's in your
[2:17:26] mouth that word has already been
[2:17:31] settled it is the will of God for
[2:17:35] you and you know as we climb
[2:17:39] into uh the perfect will of God for our
[2:17:43] lives it starts by taking God at his
[2:17:47] word let's bow our heads
[2:17:51] start by it starts by taking God at his
[2:17:53] word finding what his word says knowing
[2:17:57] that's the will of God and then that
[2:17:58] becomes a
[2:18:01] standard today we're in such a day of
[2:18:05] many many
[2:18:07] Christians are weak when it comes to
[2:18:10] just the
[2:18:12] Simplicity of a toothache I'm including
[2:18:16] myself brother random gives the
[2:18:18] example of faith for for a
[2:18:23] toothache and Faith for just any little
[2:18:27] element in our
[2:18:29] bodies and we have
[2:18:33] somehow allowed the enemy just to have
[2:18:36] that and we suffer through
[2:18:39] it and it's not a Salvation issue please
[2:18:42] don't misunderstand me it's not that
[2:18:44] you're not saved or you're less of a
[2:18:47] Christian I'm just saying and I believe
[2:18:49] the word of God is saying saying that
[2:18:51] your muscles are
[2:18:53] weak but you got the muscles he gave
[2:18:56] them to
[2:18:57] you and you can use your
[2:19:00] muscles to claim your god-given
[2:19:04] rights as a Believer and I believe
[2:19:07] that's the smallest form of exercising
[2:19:10] our faith and that same faith is the
[2:19:13] faith that Enoch had that Daniel had
[2:19:16] that Moses had that Abraham had it's the
[2:19:18] same faith that we're going to need for
[2:19:21] the body change and the Rapture and this
[2:19:23] is the faith that was once delivered to
[2:19:26] the Saints it was restored back to the
[2:19:29] believer it's been restored gifts of the
[2:19:32] Spirit are here they're in the church
[2:19:34] and they will be used as God wants to
[2:19:36] use them I believe that with all of my
[2:19:39] heart and the muscles our faith muscles
[2:19:42] are weak because we don't exercise them
[2:19:45] and I just pray that this little the
[2:19:48] Simplicity of Isaiah
[2:19:51] and Psalms
[2:19:52] 103 that all of our sicknesses and
[2:19:55] diseases he's already healed us from it
[2:19:57] now we can exercise that and then move
[2:20:00] on to the next exercise of our
[2:20:04] faith he's the high priest of our
[2:20:08] confession we find it in the word we
[2:20:11] profess it out of his word and he brings
[2:20:13] it to pass it's just that it's just that
[2:20:16] real it's like a law that's been
[2:20:21] established father we thank you for your
[2:20:23] word this
[2:20:25] morning you said that it would not
[2:20:28] return void but it would accomplish what
[2:20:30] it was sent for and Lord St John 5:19 he
[2:20:36] said the son can do nothing in himself
[2:20:38] but what he seeth the father doing that
[2:20:42] he doeth
[2:20:43] likewise and so the prophet told us that
[2:20:46] he saw by Vision he saw by Vision first
[2:20:50] what to
[2:20:51] do and Lord we have the vision in in
[2:20:55] written Pages called the Bible it's your
[2:21:00] word so we see it and then we can say
[2:21:04] what we see we claim it Lord and I pray
[2:21:07] those that are haven't walked into that
[2:21:10] Faith Lord and they need that would you
[2:21:12] raise their faith up our little church
[2:21:15] needs it our church needs this Faith
[2:21:18] Lord that you're the same yes today
[2:21:20] today and forever may you grant it we
[2:21:23] pray in Jesus

[2:23:34] about God's got everything under
[2:23:40] control amen I was thinking of brother
[2:23:43] Billy Paul's his birthday was the other
[2:23:45] day I remember he shared a testimony
[2:23:48] with me he said that he would um hand
[2:23:52] out prayer cards for Jack Co he's done
[2:23:55] that for a couple of times there in
[2:23:57] Florida he said Jack Co had him to hand
[2:24:00] out prayer cards for his meeting and he
[2:24:03] said brother Jack would stand up and
[2:24:05] tell the
[2:24:06] people I'm going to preach for 22
[2:24:08] minutes don't anybody leave from the
[2:24:12] building and I'll be done in 22 minutes
[2:24:14] and he command the honesty and he preach
[2:24:16] faith and if people will come up for
[2:24:19] prayer and if they had reading glasses
[2:24:21] he' take out a little hammer and he
[2:24:23] would smash
[2:24:24] them and pray for them to not have to
[2:24:27] use those reading glasses
[2:24:29] now that's pretty extreme but did God
[2:24:32] honor his faith oh yes oh yes God
[2:24:37] honored his faith and it's amazing how
[2:24:39] many of us in the message we've heard
[2:24:42] things about squirrels being created but
[2:24:45] then we mention something like that we
[2:24:47] just we're weak we're weak at our faith
[2:24:50] but Lord I'm in the gym now working out
[2:24:53] with my faith muscles I'm in the gym and
[2:24:56] you know one day Enoch he walked by
[2:24:59] faith he walked by faith until God took
[2:25:02] him that was the Rapture and that's you
[2:25:05] and I today amen and so God operates by
[2:25:08] our faith he's already so you brother
[2:25:11] Israel do do I have to wear reading and
[2:25:14] glasses I don't know do
[2:25:18] you it's according to your
[2:25:21] faith not a Salvation issue but I
[2:25:24] believe many of us myself included are
[2:25:27] living underneath our
[2:25:29] Privileges and take God at his word he's
[2:25:32] already declared it in his word you take
[2:25:34] Those portions that are declared for you
[2:25:36] and believe it with all your heart let's
