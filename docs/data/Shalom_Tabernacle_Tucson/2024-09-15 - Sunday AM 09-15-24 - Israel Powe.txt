and he'll take the wheat to the gar he'll separate the weeds in the wheat oh my what a message they said this guy what do you say what what what time it was oh ignorance we got the man right up there brother Jones he's the guy will do that anybody say Bishop s do Holy Father s oh my see God in Simplicity working in Simplicity then first thing you know he stand there one day and he said yes he's standing in your midst he was so sure he was that Runner he know who he was that's the reason he could shake the hide off of him but not don't tremble but just go ahead and continue on You Soldiers you obey your masters and if you done any evil you take that what should we do should we quit uh doing this should we stop doing this he said it's go on like you are continue on continue on go ahead if you're raising potatoes raise them You Soldiers don't do no violence and and you do this and whatever we do just continue on as you are obey your masters and so forth Rabbi what should we do just continue on as you are see but there's one in your midst that you don't know he know that the hour of his message he know he was to introduce that person he know he was there one in your midst you don't see things are going on you know nothing about and uh so then there's something going to happen he says you see and he'll be here I'll know him and finally one day he said behold there he is there's a lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world 's up now I've introduced you to him I must decrease now I must go off the scene he'll take over from here the Millennium will be on right the time is hand then when he comes when even John said he's going to oh he's going to shut the hide off he's going to he's going to separate the wheat from the from the chaff and he's going to burn it up he's going to thoroughly Purge his floors and his B is in his hand but what it was it little bitty now they had all draw up oh man he'll have a spe reach a mile long you'll stand back over here in Palestine you stand up there just on one of these white clouds and pick up all these Romans like this and cast him into hell just keep on doing like that it gets it all over while they had that all fixed up and what it was a little lamb come moving out of M Meek and Jan pushed around this way and that way even John said now look at John the prophet he said go ask him is actually he the one so so humbl that Prophet missed said is he the one or do we seek for another now he never give him a book from them disciples and and Matthew 11 come to ask him when John's disciple John is in prison so he' been all so scrupled up to the I believe his Pim and said his Eagle Eye got fmed over down see he could he he done come down to the Earth he' been up in the air but when his prophecy was over he dropped back down to the ground again see him prison see he didn't have no use for that big wings anymore so he just laid down there but he flew higher any the rest of them let me show you something God used him and Jesus knew he see because that was the that was the Incarnate God there see he was so he he said there and I never give him a book on how to behave himself in jail he said wait a minute I'll write a little essay here you take back and tell John how to behave himself when he's in jail for my sa see oh he never said that he didn't say go tell John that he ought to got his PhD degree before he come out if he would have rest of he been a rejector John was honest and asked the question and he said just wait till the meeting's over and then go show John what happen then he'll know if you tell him what's going on then he'll know just go let him tell him tell he's in prison couldn't be here but but you said in the meeting and you see what happen you go tell him so then the disciples said very well Master old the he he went Jesus Sitting on This Rock just watched him till he crossed over over and went up over the hill he turned out con said um who who' you go out to see in the time of John the what went you out to see did you go out to see a man that's got his collar turned around and soft clothed and highly polished and educated is that kind of man you went out to see no you know what them kind are they kiss the babies you know work in King's palaces they that's type gen well said then why' you go to see a man that's been given a Ministry and hook at R into an organization or something like that shaking whatever then if the if the on that's don't want him he go over to the Trinity the trity don't want him go Church of God any work is that kind of man you see Shake any read oh no joh he said then what did you go to see a prophet he said I say that's right but I'm going to tell you something that you don't know he was more than a prophet he was more if you can receive it this is who that was written of in the Bible back there in scripture I'll send my messenger before my face Malachi 3 see and he prepare the way before me see and they didn't understand even the disciples didn't get it see that's right oh my Simplicity be humble see go right down when God promises something big see it is big in his side now if you want to always keep this in mind I want you to you keep this in mind and when this happens then you can change it you reach down and pick up one of these little spring flowers that's coming this year or get a common blade of grass and hold it in your hand and say I'm going to hold this now and see that something so simple has made this I want to see the brain that can send a rocket to the moon make this blade of grass you'll always have it you can rest assure on that you'll always have it a blade of grass has life in it see it's so simple and humble you see if a man is a big man all right but if he's big enough that he can become simple see he'll find God but if he don't become simple he'll never see you got to become simple now verse in Revelations verse 5 and9 who are these found sing singing when the lamb takes the book out of the out all the takes the book or or these the raptured Saints no Revelations uh 6 5 and N rather no if you notice these are not the Saints they he has never claimed his property yet see this is not the Saints if you notice they're the elders and the Beast and they saying let's read it so that person and then I'm going to try I've got about half a dozen more here and I think I can get him in a few minutes let's see Revelations 5 and N let's read just a little bit before I'm so the person not honest about this they want to know what and when he had taken the taken the book The Four beasts and the four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps golden vows full of oders which are the prayers of saints and they sing a new song see see saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the thou just made his priests and Kings that's the Heavenly group not yet the redeemed all right now brother brandom if all the just a moment I guess oh pardon me brother BR if if all the Godly yeah Godly be taken up in the Rapture where will Elijah and the and Moses come from there something wrong it's something wrong I just all stood that Something's Happened see there's something that went wrong somewhere everybody feeling all right sick let see Revelations 4 was it brother five oh the question oh the question is answered now let's see thou and when he had open the book The Four Beast and the four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sang a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seal thereof for thou H has was slain and here it is here it is I was wrong on that see thou has redeemed us to God by the blood I've ever that's right now what do you think about that oh if the presence of the Holy Ghost isn't here what is he let see I only read the first part of that verse see it's it's just a ver something wrot here and I trying to get through looking at that clock but you see him sto me on that Glory I never read the other part of that see I got here and look here and they and they sang a new song now stop see but look here the song they sing ining We have redeemed us ever Kinder tongue in nation sure that them oh my oh my see it and by the way there's another question down here too could you uh c o n r control those given or control those given white Robes of Revelation 611 with those who wash their robes in the blood of the lamb now let's see Revelation 6 I just can't hurry on this folks I see because it's going I'm go to answer something wrong and he didn't let you want me to do that that's the truth so help me the holy spirit of God knows that's the truth see I just there something just I I looked at I was look that clock 11:30 I thought if I don't hurry up now I won't get to pray for sick and I'm trying to get that because I my mind is so you how can't you remember you just have to understand I'm I'm a human see and I I've been in there for seven days and my and I got something yet this afternoon I've got toine from God but he was so determined that I wouldn't make that error they called me back to read the rest of that verse I just it just felt like something just rolled over me there and said go back go back I thought go back what stop right now start praying for the sick what what is it what have I done and just to start to reach for that somebody said read the verse over again I read it over and there at the bottom of this question there it was see Revelation 6 see I read the first that does sound like it the first see and they sang a new song but down here see what it was the next coming on down has redeemed us short was the bride the raptured saint uh could you and here certainly the lamb had the book in his hand he done left the Throne of me the door of Grace see you see how the Holy Spirit watches that because exactly that's the same thing I said the other night when he had talked to me in the room and I come down here and preach to you all that one the lamb left the place oh my now believe just take a Tex see the lamb had left his seat and come forth see as I got up there when he was present that light which is Christ when he was present told me when the lamb leaves that seat of the throne to being a mediator he becomes out here and the day of redemption for the church is finished the next Redemption is opened is for the Jews 144 th is that right because he promised he cut the tree off you know now here now here he comes out the lamb and then the day of redemption is finished and all that's going to be redeemed has already been redeemed and put on the book and he's out here opening the book right oh thank you Lord forgive unnervous servant for trying to run over something now could you tolerate those given white Robes of Revelation 611 now let's see six and 11 all right where we at on this now white robes yeah that's the the crucified under the altar the the Jews between that time they were given white robes with those who wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb of Revelation 7:14 no now that is different sure enough course see here we find out here that these were given white robes over here in this time they were given white robes themselves by grace and these here had washed their robes and brother and over in Revelations over here this is that great multitude to come up before God of all Kinder tongues and Nations and these are directed exactly to the martyrs of the Jews now now that is correct now brother Brandon if all of The Godly was taken up in the Rapture where will the Elijah and Moses come from will they be Jews or will our Elijah given to us be be with them no the uh the Gentile that'll be Anointed with this Spirit to call out the Gentile will be taken away because you see the whole church all has been taken up and these two prophets of of the 11th chapter is brought down and the day of Grace is ended with the Gentile and been sent to the Jews no it won't be the same man I'm pretty sure of that I remember these are just the best of M knowledge let's see what this says question does the wheat and wine oh does w d a no I guess it meant what does it doesn't have the what there just says does the what and wine or wheat and wine what does the of Revelation 66 let's see how it is I get and I Heard a Voice in the midst of four be say a measure of wheat for a penny and a measure of barley for a penny see if that hurt not the wine or I guess that's mean the wheat and the wine that was one to the other re is a symbol the wine taken at the communion table of re of 1 Corinthians 11:24 does the wine the wine no one of them is a spiritual symbol seems uh and the other one is actually the the revelation of the word could it be that the reason many are sick because we did not discern the Lord's body correct but now reveal by the opening of The Sixth Seal let me see if I can get that now it's not you it's me you didn't you wrote it all right it's just me could it be be that the reason many are sick uh because we do not discern the Lord's body that's got a question mark at the end of that well the scripture says that many are sick and weakly among you because of the Discerning of the Lord's body that's exactly right because see the Lord's body is a bride and many of them go off and they don't go with it that's true see they don't know how to behave themselves lives any kind of life and take communion and things that's not right see when people take communion that lie and steal and drink and that that's that's terrible you shouldn't do that see uh but now reveal by the opening of the six seal the opening of The Sixth Seal let's see now no now you find out the Sixth Seal uh opening here was to the Jews see the the church has done gone this is a tribulation period so it wouldn't be the same no no it is one of them is a spiritual line it's a uh uh the revelation of the word then the the believer becomes stimulated by the revelation of the word the other is the symbol of the blood of Jesus is taken at the Lord's table now that's the best of my understanding of it will any that are not predestinated except the Lord if they do will they fall away not if they're predestinated no they couldn't Where is the scripture that shows that the the Catholicism will uh deceive the Jews and get their wealth now this words to say that that that the Beast will deceive for the wealth it doesn't say that but we're presuming that that was now the other night you remember you look at the tape real close H said that's what they would do I said see the Catholics is the richest group in the world nobody like that right and what they don't have the Jews has the rest that's right that's where the economics of this country now we're right now living on tax money according to Lifeline that will offer taxes that's come dve from Washington DC that'll be paid in 40 years since today that's what we're spanning now that's how far back we are giving notes see on taxes that will be paid in 40 years from now the nation is broke he's done now Castro the only sensible thing that he ever done was when he counterfeited the ceny he paid off the notes the bonds and bur and changed the currency that's the only thing he could do and there's only one thing left for this United States to do now remember this is William Brandon see this is my idea it's only pursue me just looking at it in the natural standpoint which may be a million miles off I do believe it right there in that money the love of money is the root of all evil and I believe it right along in there will start the ball of rolling now the Catholic church back there from charging from Mass and so forth holds the wealth of the world you remember the Bible said she was rich and how she was and remember not only just on one nation she's rich on every nation there is under Heaven she reaches out she has the money now what they don't have Wall Street has which is control for the Jews right now and you remember he got the money when Jacob returned last now and you remember [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] a [Music] a [Music] [Music] h [Music] good enough for me give me that whole time religion give me

Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed amen and that the title of our message this morning is I am healed I am healed we've been talking about the whole man and this three ring man and I'm Healed in every level of a man and that's the real healing is when the whole man can be healed may God add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated good to see brother vidales and and then each of you I think it's brother Doug's birthday tomorrow so maybe we might shake his hand at the end of the service and say happy birthday or something he's been coming with us since covid I believe as where we met him in the park doing some preaching out there and he's brought a lot of visitors to the church and so we're happy to see him all the time when we see him and each of you always glad to be in the presence of the Lord amen um I am healed brother brandham takes uh the greatest battle of revault and he introduces to us this three- ring man he said when you get home paragraph 72 go home and draw these three rings I think it's in the lens book has a impr a diagram of that body and it says spirit and soul brother Brandon brings it body uh spirit soul that diagram says Body Soul then spirit and so they kind of switch it around but nevertheless and brother Adam did it both ways but the later years seems like it was body then your spirit then your soul how many can say Amen so he says draw this three- ring man now this these three rings these three portions that make up the man they're really different from one another but yet they're so interconnected and the interplay between them can um maybe make you think that uh you're just one being but you do have a spiritual man and that spiritual man is really the most important part of you not that the other parts are not but Satan uses well all levels that he can and the Battleground was chosen that you and I would battle him through our mind through the spirit man now brother rner makes this statement and I ended this on Wednesday night just a portion of it in the greatest battle OFA 1962 paragraph 128 and he says this there it is right there those channels you get them open up don't just bypass them then if Satan can get through there get by these conscience and all these other things then he gets right down here to the end of the soul in the mind now if he can just get you you'll never you'll never look at one of them until first you have to let him in here you have to let him in then when he gets in he gets control then what does he do he begins to use the conscience he begins to use this begins to use this Outlet what is it see taste feel smell hear imaginations conscience memories reasons affections he begins to use all those different little channels as long as he could get in above this one here he's got to come in your mind first and you have to accept it listen it can batter against you but it can't get to you until you accept it now this is really the free moral agency that we've talked about that brother vam brings to us so body in your body see taste feel smelling here and then that next Channel conscious memory reasons affections imaginations and then in the soul is Faith or doubt and that's governed by free moral agency that's you make the decision to do it he didn't make a us robots he could have made us robots he could have designed us where we never would tell a lie or never would make a mistake or never would do anything wrong he has the ability like he created the Sun and what's wrong with that I mean it raises perfectly on time all the time that was just the son and he could have made you and I that way but he didn't he gave us the ability to choose we chose we made the choice to get dressed and come to church this morning we made that choice even some obstacles even if we didn't feel so well we still made the choice to be here or somebody made the choice for us and Drug us here but it was all based on somebody's Choice okay and the choice is the free moral agency and that's the Cho that's the choice that you and I make to let him in or not and we talked about those channels and on Wednesday we talked about how don't give place to the devil don't give him a place and all these channels that he can come through now this man is made in the image of God God designed him and made him to be that way and in that man because of the Fall there's uh many many different elements in our bodies but the answer for all of our sicknesses and diseases was answered at Calvary amen good to have brother will back brother Will's been gone for almost a month in Brazil and good to see brother Angel in the back too amen can we all say praise the Lord prise the Lord are you happy to see them you get out yeah give them a hand clap I think the hand claps will ensure that they'll come more right it helps to encourage that but um this um healing all thy diseases and you know this um uh sicknesses in the body and him healing all of our diseases they're in the same scripture they're in the same scripture and if I ask you all here today how many of you are saved and you're not ashamed to lift up your hand in the congregation say I'm saved by the blood of Jesus Christ by salvation but then I'll come back and say how many of you are healed and it's like well wait a minute I kind of got a cold I kind of got a you know what is flu season I got to get my flu shot like who said that we have to catch the flu every year who told us that like it's like it's like we just accept sickness like it is the will of God and it is absolutely not the will of God it it is the it's a minor if he can save your soul the part of you that was on its way to hell and was completely separated from God what about your body healing your body it's far more easier far more easier and so um it's just a minor and we're going to talk about that minor part of how he is our healer remember Psalms 103 he forgiveth all our iniquities and he Health what all all of our diseases every one of them we're already healed and so we don't come to the Lord and pray Lord if it be your will to heal me no no no no no no he already declared in his word that you are already healed that's a declaration that's a law that's a principle just like gravity is not going to change now you might fast and pray and think you can fly and think you're a bird and you come jumping off of some building out here you going to fall right on your face because there's a law called gravity above the law of gravity is the word of God and God's word already declared to us that we are already healed and so we back up on it a little bit because you don't want to you know be embarrassed yeah I still got the symptoms and what if I don't get healed it's impossible you're already healed by his stripes we're already healed I Isaiah 53 says he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities and by his stripes with his stripes we are healed that was uh 700 years before Calvary ever happened so when was we healed when did this take place Isaiah declared it because it was the word of the Lord and then Calvary happened so we the believer we claim his promises and these promises is his word so what do we do uh my brothers my sisters what do we do we take the word of God and we know that the word of God is the will of God so it can't be like you know here he declares it in his word but I'm going to see if it's his will like out here over here in some feeling or some kind of emotion I'll see if it's the will of God over in the corner over here I'm going run over here and see if it's the will of God if he's already declared it in his word that is his will amen so when you find it in his word then you can say it before you feel anything see anything before anybody agrees with you before you can think it through you just say what the word says it's already settled in heaven amen amen am and so this healing brother random takes this now as I said I've embraced the internet and Technology to the fullest and uh so you should too so you should be able to take notes like nobody has ever taken notes in the history of the world because of the technology we have I'm not talking about foolishness I'm not talking about passing notes but I'm talking about taking something from the word that you can add to yourself and go feed on it again and read it again and and let it and then meditate on it as the scripture says and so this is one of those places many of you have heard this I'm going to refer to it it's this young lady that had she had got she was raised a Christian Deacon's daughter I think and then she got out in the Bad Company she started uh drinking someone put something in her drink and she rent down this terrible path in her morals and her life and she wanted to get recovered from that so she had been prayed for many times oil had been laid on oil been she's been Anointed with oil and it's in the message faith without works is dead 1950 I want you to go get that and hear the testimony I'm going to refer to it but when you go hear it for yourself it's going to it's going to bring you Faith because Faith cometh by hearing hearing what not the news not the news is not what everybody else is doing out there Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of God and so it's in that message faith without works is dead 1950 starting right around paragraph 33 those of you that would like to get that and brother randam is talking with her and then he brings her to the Altar and they go down and pray and then there the night Spirit comes on on them and she gets up and she says okay I'm good now I'm ready to go turn a new Leaf I'm ready to go and brother brand says no no it's not done yet that you're going to go back and do the same thing now her intentions were good her motives were good she wouldn't have came to the altar if she had bad intentions she didn't want this Spirit on her if you hear the conversation she didn't want to be that way and brother random explains to her and Faith cometh by hearing he says what you have on you is a devil and it's It Is possessing you to to make you do things you don't want to do and she said you know what I kind of always thought that and then like the light bulbs coming on now this is a devil that's making me do this so so stop it with making excuses it's a devil and I don't want a devil on me I want to go in the Rapture I want to be in part of the body change I want to go and live eternally and I don't want any demons Devils whatever on me so they go through this dialogue and then brother Brandon brings it here to paragraph 37 he says paragraph 35 says now look if you'll believe in the Lord and will pray she said I've done that brother I said I'm not talking about what you have done I mean now you just do as I tell you to do and you'll be free from that she says well can you free me I said no ma'am only Jesus Christ can free you she says well I've already come to him to give my life I said sister just a moment you just do as I tell you will you she said I said let's pray now and we got down and prayed she was crying she raised up a few minutes she said brother vom I'm going to go out tonight she says I'm going to try my best I says no you'll go right straight back again I said it's not over she says but I have I've done all that I know how to do I said but it's not yet sister it's got to be something to pull that nature from you and change you and she said well I prayed I've cried she began to cry and started out and so brother Adam goes a little bit further and you need to get that testimony I'll take paragraph 37 he says why by faith why the power of God that would change a prostitute to a saint a drunkard to a righteous woman why that by the same power will take any cancer deaf dumb blind for the same blood for the same man on the same day atone for your healing that atones for your salvation is that the truth he was wounded for our transgressions with the stripes you're healed The Blood Run exactly off the same man at the same day is that right so I want you to equate equate your salvation to your healing and any sickness or any ailment that would cause a disease or discomfort that's contrary to your original Health that God has provided for you if he saved you he's already healed you and this is the confidence I don't have any confidence that there's no con I don't have any you know there's no question about my salvation I know he saved me but then when it comes to Healing he like we kind of get we kind of lose it and healing is just a small exercise that we have to move into for the body change say brother Israel this is simple preaching you're talking about healing but I think that's where we're at this morning I think that's where we're at because you can't you can't you can't get into the deeper things if the Simplicity of him being your healer hasn't been established in your heart and you got to know that that is not my will not somebody else's will this is the will of God that you be completely healed now you can live your life and be saved and live underneath your PR Privileges and live under a sickness longer than you have to but that's not God's will for you and we'll get into there's times where like Paul he prayed to Lord to take this away but it was the will of God that that stayed in his life for a purpose and there's other places brother banam with his stomach you know that gift wasn't for him and there's places where you know God might allow a curse to be on someone and that's for a purpose for a period of time but generally speaking all sicknesses and diseases come from somewhere and when you know that it's not from heaven then you can take the promises of God now for some of you you you won't believe it but this is in the word it's all through the message it's people who don't even know know the message of the hour that have walked in this principle Tommy Osborne I was listening to his testimony he said the denominations didn't want him to go to brother Brand's meeting but his wife went anyway I think her name was Daisy Osborne she gives her testimony she saw the Miracles saw them singing the old hymns and she came back and told her husband and he went anyways outside of his his denomination told them not to not to have brother brandom so he went into the meeting there in Oregon and he says when he saw the signs wonders and miracles he said the voices like 10,000 voices spoke to him it says you can do that you can do that you can how many heard this testimony it's on the internet okay it's available uh how many of you of I'm not I was going to bring up a latest show but I don't know any of them but many of you all know that the late what's the latest show somebody help me y'all smooth you all are very sharp okay you know what I'm saying if I if I blurted out the latest whatever people watch many of you all know that but this was associated with brother bram's Ministry and he said the Thousand 10,000 voices says you can do that you can do that you can do that and then you hear what brother brandham said about Tommy Osborne's Ministry without an angel and a gift in his life just simply taking the word of God on healing and thousands upon thousands of people were healed under this man's Ministry who doesn't have the seven seal who don't have 1200 tapes don't have prayer line after prayer line after prayer line of literal examples of folks being healed how should I be walking when it comes to Healing right amen amen so this word is what brings our healing it is the will of God I'll take a few scriptures for you talking about his word healing we s read it in Psalms 107 he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions Matthew 8 verses 8-10 the Centurion asks and says Lord I'm not worth worthy that thou sh come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed I'm under Authority having soldiers under me I say this man go he go another one come he come and to my servant do this he doeth it when Jesus heard it he marveled and said to them that followed verily I say unto you I have not found what he call it so great of what faith not n what was his faith see faith without works is dead if you believe it then you will speak it if you believe it then you'll live it you'll go do it so you're not quoting one thing out here and leaving it out there if you believe it you will do it faith without works is dead Matthew 8 verse 16 it says they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick so he used his word to cast out Spirits he uses the word by the word my daughter will recover he sends his word and his word is his will his word is the law is what his ideas are about sicknesses and diseases all of them all of sicknesses all diseases now we know it is the will of God is that right Saints God's word is his will is it's it's in Mark 3:35 it says whosoever shall do the will of God the same as my brother my sister and my mother Acts 13:36 says that David he had served his own Generation by the will of God Romans 8:26 verse 28 says likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings we think we know what we need to pray for but we don't know scripture says which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to what so he has a will and he's making intercession to the Saints according to his will and his will is his word according to the will of God and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose Romans chap 12 verse number two it be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God there's um one see Corinthians Ephesians Colossians and Timothy Paul addresses himself or he closes his letter by saying Paul called to be an an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God so he knew he was an apostle through the will of God it was by the will of God that he was Apostle that's not boasting that's not bragging that's just saying what it is I'm an American citizen I'm not bragging I'm not boasting in fact I can say whatever I want to say if bragging and boasting is in my heart it doesn't matter what I say because the spirit is on me to be proud anyways and so I might say words that make me sound humble but I got the most proudful demon in my heart because I want to sound own humble it's always a heart issue and when Paul made the comment that he is an apostle by the will of God he knew where he was standing he knew his position in the scriptures he know that he was a son or a daughter of God and so do you and I have to know who we are and once we know who we are we know what the word of God says about us and then we say what the word say we don't even say what we feel we don't say what we think we don't get in the emotion of the moment we stay with the word of God and when we declare that it heavens and earth will pass away but it will never pass away amen Romans 8 Romans 12 all the scriptures all these Witnesses Galatians 1:4 says this who gave himself for our sins that he might Deliver Us from this present evil world according to the will of God and our father 1 Thessalonians 4 2-4 says this you want to note this one you want to take this one home with you says for we know that what Commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from what from from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor so fornication is that talking about the body or the spirit or is it talking about both see fornication you can do that in your heart and this is what Jesus says he that lookth and lusted after a woman he's already committed fornication so there's a double commitment there when a man falls or a woman falls into fornication you sin against your body but in your spirit you can fornicate too and this is the whole man that God wants to heal it's not just you're not doing things wrong but we want to move over to where I'm not even thinking or Desiring to do what's wrong it's this inner man that we want healed from the bruises the scars and the unbelief it's the Inner Man and it's the whole man that God is taking with us into the Rapture the word of God is speaking to your inner man that the heart of a man will be molded into the image of go image of Christ that your desires desires would be pure they would be clean they would be healthy amen it's the will of God that you abstain from fornication so you don't have to leave your house you don't have to leave from the presence of your phone or tablet or whatever and this scripture has to be valid to you abstain from it all right 1 Thessalonians 5:116 verse 18 says this Rejoice Evermore pray without ceasing in some things the good things the things you like give thanks is that what it says it says it everything and everything give thanks why why should I give thanks for this is the will of God that's not somebody's idea on what you how you should be positively think about this and how you should do it's the will of God that you give thanks in everything Hebrews 10:36 says this after you you need need patience after you have done the will of God so now let's get into this just for a moment all right I just take uh I won't go long this morning okay amen and so you know what I really don't go long am I a long with it preacher thank you so stop it putting that long wited preacher look on me I'm I never preach long I always stop before I should one of these days I'm going to do a two-hour sermon and I'm going to do it on on purpose and I'm going to take names and take notes I'll come see you for dinner all right all right okay the word of God says this here's what brother Ram says and who hath believe our report 1951 he says this here paragraph number 20 no no I'm sorry this is the ministry explained in 1950 he says this here paragraph number 20 first we must be sure that it is that it's the will of God to heal we ought to take some time on that in the meetings which the managers probably will upon the will of God to heal how Jesus died to heal how that commission was given first to heal the first thing he said when he sent out his disciples heal the sick cleans the lepers raise the dead freely as you receive freely give that was his first Commission Matthew 10 Mark 16 the last commission he said go into all the world and preach the gospel he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved these signs shall follow them that believe why all the world in my name they shall cast out Devils they'll speak with new tongues they'll take up serpents or drink deadly things shall not harm them and if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover what's the matter is we Christians get too weak when it comes to The Showdown if it's real it's real if it's not it's not and if I didn't believe him with all my heart and know it was real I wouldn't I would not be here tonight but I believe it and not only that I know it's real see and I've seen it over thousands of places so how do you you increase your strength in this you take these promises and you start exercising them every day you start claiming those promises every day you get the scriptures you start reading them read them out loud Faith comth by hearing it don't come by no other way faith comes by hearing the word of the lord your intentions might be good you might emotionally be connected to wanting these things to happen but it's not going to happen until you hear the word of God and many times you have to be the one speaking it you spend more time with yourself than probably you spend here at church or hearing it preach and more times than not you're in a walk between you and the Lord and you have to internalize the word of God for yourself you can't wait for other people to agree with you you can't wait till other people start doing it and then you start doing it if he's a Healer he is actually your healer and when you're sick in your body you claim those promises more times than not we have more faith in the doctors or more faith in the prescription or the drugs that are out there when God already declared in his word before anybody ever gave any kind of medication or anything I'm the Lord that heals all thy diseases all of them he's the Healer of your body amen and he heals your soul it's the will of God anybody says we Christians are weak who hath believed our report 1951 he says this here paragraph number six six the spirit of the Lord come into the audience and just sap my strength and just as I started to go down my brother run to me to catch me and I looked I seen Congressman Upshaw and he been in my meetings since he was a lad when I first when he first fell and hurt himself he wanted to be healed then by God he he'd been in meetings ever since he was aad when he first fell and hurt himself he wanted to be healed then by God he listened to Mr Roberts he been with Mr Freeman's meetings Mr Ogle be and many of them had prayed for him friends I've got something to say along them lines after a bit no matter how much Faith you have it'll never change the predestinated will of God it's got to be by Vision to see what happens so here the prophet of God brings to us the predestinated will of God it's got to be by that so here's Congressman of Shaw and here's a one of these cases he desired to be healed all of his life all of his life and the Lord refrained from that he had a purpose behind it uh sister Hattie writes Edith right she never fully received her healing there is a reason and and brother R says the Lord didn't reveal to him the reason but you know and some people say well look she was never healed but and use that as an example but look at the tens of thousands that came and were healed so if you're going to weigh out the evidence let's be fair there's far more healed than those that are not healed by trusting in the Lord and the scriptures amen and we have to Proclaim that and declare it and believe it with all our heart brother brandham continues on in this will of God he says faith the Africa trip report 1952 he says I believe it's written in the scripture one of the writers says above all things I would that you would prosper in health and I pray that God will let every sick person in here tonight be well I'm sure it's the will of God that all of you would be well he wants you to be well if you and I can only have faith if we just sometimes wonder what that great article Faith what it is you know to my surprise I say this with reverence in my heart fearing lest I would say something wrong I find that about 80% of the people say they believe just has hope instead of faith faith is just so sure it's positive it never moves it just got to be faith is an element it's a sense it's the six sense of the human body it's the one sense the human soul has two senses part of the man that's his five senses to control the human body see taste feel smell here and the inward man has two senses that's Faith unbelief one of them governs amen so this is this is the the man that that makes us this is what motivates us this is who we are today I see you in your body but there's a spiritual man in you to too and that spiritual man is governed by faith or doubt I mean what are we thinking do we think the Rapture and coming into the body change is going to be um you know I haven't believed all these years and all of a sudden out of nowhere I'm going to somehow believe no it never happens that way you you believe God right here and then he causes your faith to grow even more and then you exercise that faith and then your faith is put to the test just like our a this age is putting our faith to the test like we say we believe every word and then things happen and people do things that's contrary to the word then you have to make a decision and that's challenging your faith do you really believe every word and this is what brother bam talks about in The Showdown many Christians are weak and it's sad but but his word is there to heal us this morning is there to bring us up to that next level of believing that all things are possible if we have a problem believing in Divine Healing I mean we would have a problem believing because everything that we receive from God Is by faith and Divine Healing is just the minor the the medical field knows that there's people that heal through herbs and they heal through you know being nice and through love and through you know showing kindness and getting someone to believe in you and people have been healed by that what about us that have the word of the Lord amen healing is the children's bread this morning and so it's the will of God it's in the word of God it's his will it's his perfect will to heal but now he brings in these details brother brandham does about the predestinated will of God and how you have to know what God is doing and and and he goes further and he says this here in the Africa trip report he says this here um I'm sorry in the message Elijah paragraph number 10 says we're speaking tonight about Elijah and making it a preview of our prayer meeting coming now Elijah was a man many many times when someone speaks of a man like Elijah they would expect him to be a great angel or some sort of a sainted person that was dropped out of Heaven the but the Bible said he was a man subject to like passions as we are he has his ups and downs his trials his indifference but he prayed earnestly that it wouldn't rain and it didn't rain for 3 years and 6 months and after 3 years 6 months he prayed again in the heavens gave rain now he was a man just like we are not an angel not no more than what you or I he had his differences and things his ups and downs in life his life like we do but God answered his prayer because he prayed earnestly and sincerely and before that kind of a prayer can be made for sick or for the end of a drought for anything that we have need of there must be a perfect understanding that we're praying in the will of God that's the reason he can close the heavens that it didn't rain because God had told him it was going to happen so it's easy to say anything's going to happen when God says it's going to happen because it's got to be that way God's word cannot fail so Elijah's Vision now becomes the word of the Lord and he has faith in it so Faith Works a bit like this it's contagious it's called influence and so is fear very influenced people follow and and fear you know is taught to people many times and and many times you you're working with people that are fearful and Afraid and the things of God God they will damage your faith can hinder your faith and this is why in the Old Testament all them going into battle he told them to fear not and if you are fear stay at home because it's not a question of you just being afraid somebody might lose their life that's how serious it is it's not a question that you know this is just you no your negativity and your fear might cause someone to lose like majorly lose so we're in the Battleground we're in the we're in the battle of the greatest battle ever fought and this is the time that we have to really um take into consideration you know the things that we speak the way we pray the way we go about and conduct ourselves you know the other people are watching us how we handle the word and other people are are watching how we conduct ourselves we influence others and you know with this healing it goes even further from years ago some of you may remember years and years ago I did a study I did a message preached a message on God is no respector of persons and how in that message that the scripture says that he treats Every Nation the same he's no respector of persons if a man turns to God he will heal them he will save them he'll deliver them and in that message you'll notice sister Georgie Carter when she was calling for healing she was a little lamb caught up in miltown she had got a hold of a little book Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and in that book there was another little girl the male girl that was healed now she's in a church that didn't believe but she got a hold of this book that this little girl was healed K and here she was 9 years old on her bed of Affliction in a church that didn't believe her family didn't believe but she got a hold of this book that Jesus Christ healed this other girl that she never saw and Faith cometh by what and you don't even it could just be a testimony that you heard and she be to cry out to God for healing and while she's calling for healing God in his mercy and Grace sends a vision to the prophet and in the vision he sees a little lamb crying he didn't know her name didn't know who she was he just sees a little lamb in mil toown so he goes to the town he's trying to find her who is this and he has a Revival people get saved brother Hall gets saved establishes a church he's still trying to find and and then he gets into prayer real deep prayer and the Holy Spirit tells him to go to the Carter's home and when he gets to the Carter's home he said it was then that the Lord revealed to him I know who you are you're that lamb I saw caught up in this you know the you know this unbelief Rise Up from your bed and the devil said no you she can't rise she's been sick nine years it's never happened her church don't believe this one doesn't believe rise up anyways why because Faith cometh by hearing now she didn't maybe have examples in her church she didn't have an atmosphere of people patter her on her back come on Georgie she didn't have anything else other than a testimony that somebody else was healed and if God will do it for one person he will do it for another all you got to do is find how God ever acted throughout human history find one case when you find that case you can attach your Faith to that and say Lord you did it over here now do it over here absolutely cuz he's no respector of person so it's influenceable it spreads you just got to find it if God can can save and you know and deliver you know the next brother's family and you have faith and you believe he'll do that for your family say well my family's all Renegades they all don't say that out loud my family did this my family find an example somewhere find someone in the scripture take Rahab to harlot find something in the scriptures or somebody in your congregation or somebody in Canada or somebody that's around the message somewhere where God moved on their behalf then grab it and say Lord if you did it for them you can do it for me too that's our faith and it's just the elementary portion of believing but it's not so Elementary today but he equates it right with iniquities and diseases he deals with them both in the same the same blood the same scripture the same event deals with it so let's go into the will of God a little bit more take a little bit more time here paragraph 47 and how the angel come to me watch how brother Anna handles this here he says and you're watch on the platform form you seldom hear me say anything about I cast out this devil I have to see first whether it's the will of God to do that first I'll pray for the person but never call over that demon continues on paragraph 49 same message now you see what I mean that's the reason I go easy I watch what I'm doing once God puts something on somebody if God didn't put it on on there he permitted Satan to do it to put the curse on the person because of something he's trying to do so you see the context there are you with me this morning do you see the there's a context on why God allows sicknesses and diseases on one and maybe not the other and so instead of you thinking well brother so and so had the same sickness he had to go in and go through the treatment you know so I got the same thing brother so and so has I got to go through who told you that you know the scripture says he's the Lord that heals all diseases and I'm not brother so and so but I can take the scriptures for my sickness and claim my healing how many can say Amen to that otherwise we all sick we all follow one another it'd be great if we all be getting healed and we all follow one another how about that and so brother manam brings this context in casting out devil that you know there's a reason why he's got to watch he doesn't curse or something that God put on the man you can get in trouble by doing that he says so that's the reason that I go easy I watch what I'm doing when I find the will of God then I know where I'm setting my foot but until I know the will of God now I'm not condemning people who doesn't that God don't hold them responsible if they don't know that's exactly right they're just is doing what they can but that's the reason I go very easy and watch what I'm doing you understand now all right jerus and Divine Healing so I'm bringing these the context the balance on Divine Healing you say brother Israel all sicknesses you know he heals all diseases so nobody in our church should ever be sick well that's a good start if we're going to error on something that's a great start and you let the let down happen later but let's say you know that's out of balance like nobody ever will get sick everybody sh at all times should always be healed and if there's any sickness it's because they got some sin in their life well these are some of the details as why there is sickness and why it lingers because God has a purpose and a plan and he uses that sometimes to correct his children and he has other reasons that he uses or allows sickness to linger like the children of in Israel were in bondage all those years there was a reason for it so brother bandom takes us a little bit further inuus and Divine Healing paragraph s he says for instance let me see I'll take a little time here going yeah paragraph s he says this for instance like Comm man going goes overseas let's stop here just a minute we're going overseas and we get in the ship now the man that really runs the ship goes down in the bowels of the ship the engineer but he takes orders from this man upstairs well what if he gives orders two knots to the left and the man down in here turns two knots to the right he said straight ahead and then the man down here ships runs backwards but see they've got to get in harmony see you've got to be or the ship Will Never Move well now many people has hope and cus it Faith but now when God says a certain thing and you say a certain uh the same thing and down here it says the same thing something's going to happen you see when it gets all together but then the ship will move the Lord will will move but you've got to be in perfectly in harmony with the will of God the word of God your subc conscience you're real your first conscience with the spirit of God all that moving together and everything just clears the way and you move out you've got to do that amen so brother banam is showing us those three elements though you know you got the man down in your subconscious you have your mind saying one thing and you want all that moving in Harmony and you could pray for that God move me in harmony with your word let my subconscious be really connected to the word of God and how can I achieve that if I'm pumping my conscience in with what Hollywood has it's just very very difficult you're conflicting yourself and so God has provided his way brother vom says this here Israel when they were down in Egypt they were in bondage and in trouble and they begin to cry for God for deliverance notice the way God will provide is when we're in God's word Israel had God's word that they were going out of there someday so they went to crying to God according to the will of God for God to provide what he had promised to do there you are you're praying for something that's out of the will of God you can't have faith for it but when God promises anything I believe that he'll keep his word so they knew that's the reason Abraham knew that God was going to deliver him somehow because he had promised that through Isaac all nations in the world will be blessed the children of Israel down in Egypt they knew God had promised them Deliverance so they went to praying for the promise so you see that you take the promises of healing this is what God says about it and then you go to pray for that healing to be manifested in you because that is the will of God that you're praying for you're not praying for something outside of his will amen can I get a witness that's for your family that's not outside of his will that's for your healing that's for deliverance you're praying in the will of God then and then you can have faith for what you're praying for and then don't be discouraged stay with it and God will bring it to pass amen he that is in you he says this in paragraph 173 where many of our Brethren gets excited they get impressed that God says do a certain thing they say it's thus say the Lord when it isn't that's the reason it don't happen but when it's God really telling you it's got to happen it's got to be that way see when God speaks it it has to be so we don't have that problem when we find the words of the Lord in our Bible amen the word that God says about it is in his word his word is what heals the people now this health that the Lord wishes that we'd all would prosper and be in health John 31 verse vers two says behold beloved I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy Soul Prosper so we think of Health most of the time or many times as the health in our body but really the Divine Health that we want is the real you to be healthy where your spirit is whole where your spirit is has been healed where the Lord has touched your inner man and you're walking in his perfect plan and his purpose for your life and Psalms 4211 says this why art thou cast down oh my soul why art thou disquieted within me hope thou in God for I shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance and my God say Lord Heal My countenance first not just my body heal the out heal my the the way I conduct and carry myself and some of us need that all of us need it at one point some of us need it right now some of us definitely need our countenance our you know the energy that we are possessing that we move in Lord Heal Me There Psalms 43:5 says why are thou cast down on on my soul why art thou disqui within me kind of a repeat hope in God for I shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance my God Proverbs 4:20 ver 23 says my son attend to my words incline thine ear unto my sayings let them not depart from Thine Eyes keep them in the midst of thine heart for they are life unto those that find them and Health to all their flesh keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of Life Proverbs 12:18 tells us there is that speaketh like a piercing of a sword but the tongue of the wise is Health pleasant words are the Proverbs thir Proverbs 16:24 tells us pleasant words are as a honeycomb sweet to the soul and health to the bones Jeremiah 8:22 is there no bomb in Gilead is there no physician there why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered Jeremiah 317 says for I will restore Health unto thee and I will heal thee of thy wounds sayeth the Lord because th called thee because they called thee an outcast saying this is Zion whom no man seeketh after Jeremiah 33:6 tells us behold I will bring it health and cure I will cure them and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and Truth beloved I wish above all things John 3 veres 1 and 2 3rd John 1- 2 beloved I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy Soul prospereth if you take that word health and prosper you'll see that it's connected with praise in a few of those songs Psalms there's a a quotation is very short I don't think I gave it to you all in the back but brother rer makes this statement that the quote here he says take God at his word start thanking him for it amen praise him until it comes so there's a there's a health in the praise because your praise is according to the word your praise is like the Lord is good his mercy endureth forever I Praise You Lord because you're my salvation you're my strength you're the Healer of my body you're the Healer of of my family you're the Healer of all my issues you're the Healer I praise you I lift my hands I give you praise now that's healthy that's healthy talk that's Health to your bones that makes a better you that makes a better man a a lot of the Deliverance is in the praise and we miss that the praise service comes on we looking around arms folded won't say a peep but your words are in your words there's Health out of the mouth of the just there's a there's a blessing when you start to take the words of the Lord and it comes out in praise it brings health to the bones and this is the will of God now where does sickness and disease come from my time is going but brother banam makes this statement now first I'll read the scripture for you and I'm GNA close on this but I'm gonna read this scripture and second Timothy chapter 1 and verse 7 if they get it on the screen then you can see it and it says this that for God had not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind so the spirit of fear and fear is the spirit we know that the spirit of fear God didn't give it to you it came from somewhere and brother bman goes forward in the message enticing spirits and he makes this statement and this is a powerful one and I know I don't I knew I wouldn't have time to get into it so I'm I'm reserving I reserved it for my last portion of quotes but he deals with the fourth dimension diseases how diseases come from there and it really it really uh shows you that um it's much greater than the sickness in your body there's a sickness in the soul that's the really the part of you that needs to get healed you know and I'm going to read for you here brother Bram says here in enticing Spirits paragraph 38 now we've applied it in healing service always to the healing side cancer tumor cataract tuberculosis and all these things are not natural things they are Supernatural and are demons the scripture plainly vindicates that but that is demons in the body which with growths like cancer got life in it and the life of that is a demon growth of a c cataract the spread of tuberculosis other diseases it's demons that's in physical form now this morning we're going to talk about demons in spiritual form in the soul they're in the soul the same as they're in the body and we're bound to admit that we see them in people's body such as cancers and different diseases that's in the human body just recently even cancer has been declared to be a fourth dimension disease that's it's in another dimension sure it's demonology every disease is a fourth dimension disease the beginning of it now but now cancer in the body or cancer in the soul the demon can come in either place now there's many times and many people with good thoughts good people who try many times to rest upon some little theology they have or something they have been taught since a child and still find that down in their being down in their soul that they still have something that's not right you uh you men many are here this morning no doubt wherever you find Christians gathered together you find people who has those Spirits in them it's undesirable they don't want them they say oh if I can only quit lying if I can only quit lusting if I can only quit this or that now that is devil s and now they come in the form of religion many times being at Sunday school it's time of teaching so let's look into this now they come in the form of religion many times so that's pretty strong that's pretty strong cancer in the soul have you ever heard that term that he's a cancer on this job or she's a cancer in the family are they are can they're becoming a cancer you know it's talking on a on a spiritual level there but he's he's my healer he's our healer he's the Healer of all our diseases in our body and in the soul and I would submit to you that getting the healing in your soul is the most important healing that can take place to you and that comes by the holy spirit that comes by a will willing heart to take God at his word what does his word say about being born again what does he say about the new man in the heart what does he say about him delivering you from the former things of the world that darkness and bringing you over into the Kingdom of Light what does the word say about it these are the promises is that we that we um that we claim and we ask God for the heal healing right there right in there and he's our healer today and we thank God for it and he is he is the health to our bones he's Health naturally he's Health spiritually and it was his great desire that we would prosper in our health we prosper and also prosper in our health how me thank the Lord for that he is our healer he's the Healer of the whole man and that's the man that his word heals us by that so God bless you richly let's bow our heads the musicians come you remember the word of the Lord it's nigh thee it's in your heart it's in your mind it's in your mouth that word has already been settled it is the will of God for you and you know as we climb into uh the perfect will of God for our lives it starts by taking God at his word let's bow our heads start by it starts by taking God at his word finding what his word says knowing that's the will of God and then that becomes a standard today we're in such a day of many many Christians are weak when it comes to just the Simplicity of a toothache I'm including myself brother random gives the example of faith for for a toothache and Faith for just any little element in our bodies and we have somehow allowed the enemy just to have that and we suffer through it and it's not a Salvation issue please don't misunderstand me it's not that you're not saved or you're less of a Christian I'm just saying and I believe the word of God is saying saying that your muscles are weak but you got the muscles he gave them to you and you can use your muscles to claim your god-given rights as a Believer and I believe that's the smallest form of exercising our faith and that same faith is the faith that Enoch had that Daniel had that Moses had that Abraham had it's the same faith that we're going to need for the body change and the Rapture and this is the faith that was once delivered to the Saints it was restored back to the believer it's been restored gifts of the Spirit are here they're in the church and they will be used as God wants to use them I believe that with all of my heart and the muscles our faith muscles are weak because we don't exercise them and I just pray that this little the Simplicity of Isaiah and Psalms 103 that all of our sicknesses and diseases he's already healed us from it now we can exercise that and then move on to the next exercise of our faith he's the high priest of our confession we find it in the word we profess it out of his word and he brings it to pass it's just that it's just that real it's like a law that's been established father we thank you for your word this morning you said that it would not return void but it would accomplish what it was sent for and Lord St John 5:19 he said the son can do nothing in himself but what he seeth the father doing that he doeth likewise and so the prophet told us that he saw by Vision he saw by Vision first what to do and Lord we have the vision in in written Pages called the Bible it's your word so we see it and then we can say what we see we claim it Lord and I pray those that are haven't walked into that Faith Lord and they need that would you raise their faith up our little church needs it our church needs this Faith Lord that you're the same yes today today and forever may you grant it we pray in Jesus name amen got everything under control God's got everything under control God's got everything under control you don't have a thing to to worry about God's got everything under God God's got everything under control you believe that God's got everything don't worry you don't have a thing to worry about God's got everything God's got your family God's got your family under control God's

everything God's got my healing God's got my healing under I'm already healed my healing under control you don't have a thing to worry about God's got everything you don't have a thing to worry cuz you don't have a thing to worry about God's got every I don't have a thing to worry I don't have a thing to worry about God's got everything under control amen I was thinking of brother Billy Paul's his birthday was the other day I remember he shared a testimony with me he said that he would um hand out prayer cards for Jack Co he's done that for a couple of times there in Florida he said Jack Co had him to hand out prayer cards for his meeting and he said brother Jack would stand up and tell the people I'm going to preach for 22 minutes don't anybody leave from the building and I'll be done in 22 minutes and he command the honesty and he preach faith and if people will come up for prayer and if they had reading glasses he' take out a little hammer and he would smash them and pray for them to not have to use those reading glasses now that's pretty extreme but did God honor his faith oh yes oh yes God honored his faith and it's amazing how many of us in the message we've heard things about squirrels being created but then we mention something like that we just we're weak we're weak at our faith but Lord I'm in the gym now working out with my faith muscles I'm in the gym and you know one day Enoch he walked by faith he walked by faith until God took him that was the Rapture and that's you and I today amen and so God operates by our faith he's already so you brother Israel do do I have to wear reading and glasses I don't know do you it's according to your faith not a Salvation issue but I believe many of us myself included are living underneath our Privileges and take God at his word he's already declared it in his word you take Those portions that are declared for you and believe it with all your heart let's stand and sing that one more time God's got oh God's got
