========================================

ain't nothing out of order it's working just exactly like God's Big Time heat see like a clock moving right around your name was put in there before the foundation of the world when the lamb was SL to redeem what was in that book and now he comes forward and takes that book to claim his Redemption I don't want to get started there we never would answer another question today all right question is hell and the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone the same no hell translation in the Bible I believe now the scholar sitting here want to honor that our brother Iverson sitting here and brother n and many of these Brethren who are really theologians the word translated Haiti means the grave is that right the Greek word for the grave but the Lake of Fire is something else but over in Revelations both Hades and PA was cast into the Lake of Fire all right now let's see if not uh is the Lake of Fire hell Eternal no sir no sir anything that was created is not Eternal now anything's created that's the reason there cannot be an eternal hell if anybody ever tells you that you go to burnning an eternal hell I want the scripture for him there's no such a thing as that hell was cre created for the devil and his angels for the Antichrist and his people that was the devil incarnate devil is created for that to destroy and anything that H anything is only one thing at all out of everything there is the whole world and everything else there's only one thing Eternal and that's God before there was a atom or electrons or before there was even Cosmic like electrons or anything he was God he's a Creator and that's the only way you can be Eternal is to receive eternal life that Greek word there I think is Zoe isn't that right Zoe Zoe and then that that life God imparts to you as the father your father imparts his life to you through the uh the marriage vow with the mother and he by that imparts the the joy of imparting catch me of the imparting life for a son and that's way God does joy in imparting his life to a son see and then you become part of him which is zo God's own life I give to unto them eternal life raise them up the last days that's the only thing that that you got eternal life and that eternal life knows its body and it must have to come come forth that it can it's impossible for it to lay there as the spirit of Christ hovered over the body God's spirit over Christ at that great day it know it would raise up again so is the Saints in their body now remember Jesus when he died he went to hell because he had to go there he was a sin barrier and he preached to the souls that were in hell that repented not in the long suffering the day is Noah that right he went to hell and preached to the souls the separated Souls from God death means separation and they had separated from God never could be back no more and Jesus went to Bear a record that he was the one that was spoke of the the woman's seed the serpent seed see what the serpent seed done Antichrist find up in death separation the red hearts the woman seed life ends up on the white heart Jesus Christ see what is it one against the other serpent seed against a woman's seed amen

Lord with you this morning it's always a privilege to be gathered in his name amen we like to go right into the word and for our Sunday school lesson we're going to read out of the Book of Joshua chapter 1 if you can stand there stand for the reading of the word we want to thank brother um the Brethren that was over the service last was that last Sunday I was here last Sunday was that with brother George right my days are so torn but we certainly appreciate brother George and filling in for us and looks like the enemy hit him in his body but we know the Lord is our healer today and uh we appreciate the services that he him taking those Services Sunday morning Sunday night we had a wonderful time in West Palm Beach there was a really large crowd there Friday night was a banquet for young people singles I believe and then Saturday night was a uh concert a night of worship with the choir there that this brother put together that developed during covid um and it's really developed very nicely I was really blessed and impressed and then Sunday morning I was there at that same Gathering that they hosted at a church there with brother Jack Duff is the pastor West Palm Beach we had a wonderful time in the Lord and if I can get that service and put it on if we can get that service and put that on the website that would be great to do that if the Lord will help us amen and how many's happy to be here today so happy to see you folks amen I always love to see your smiling faces God bless you in the scriptures Joshua chapter 1 verses 1-9 we will read all together Act I'll take the first verse we'll read it alternately and verse 9 we'll read all together all right now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses's Minister saying is dead every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I unto Moses as I said unto Moses sorry Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee strong people only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper withs soever thou goest is written altogether have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whether soever thou goth amen one more scripture in Revelations chapter 22 Verse 18 Revelations 22:18 for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book he which testified these things saith surely I come quickly amen even so come Lord Jesus the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all amen let's pray Lord Jesus we ask your blessings on the word that we read here today Father move our thoughts aside to just what you would have us to speak and to hear Lord we commit it in ourselves into your hands now in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated amen don't add don't take away is the title of our message this morning don't add don't take away we took this little subject or portion of it a number of different ways here at the church and in Florida it rekindled itself again as I spoke on the message a priest found a book and uh to write it down we went through those scriptures where the Bible God commands us to write down the words of the Lord the Testaments are to be written down the Commandments are to be written down and then after they're written down he seals it with these two disciplines and that's the discipline of not adding to or taking away from it it's in these two disciplines that I believe that a true Minister can find his way in the perfect will of God it is also where the True Believer has to develop this at at itude or the willingness or the courage not to add not to take away just say it the way it's said leave it alone even the parts you don't understand even the Redundant part even the repeats the repeats the repeats and who begot and who begot and who begot keep it all in there because God put it in there for a purpose and in this discipline I believe is where Joshua found his success it was in his commission that you will prosper if you're not just here or remember what Moses said but you take it and don't turn to the left or to the right you stay right with what he said and I'd like to say to you all this uh this morning those of us we follow this great message of the hour we know that this message was ministered by the Ang Angel of the Lord this great angel came also to eleazer when he was trying to find a bride for his master Abraham this Angel also appeared to Moses and told him that I will send my angel in the way to keep you in the way so as we just look at these things at this great message that we're following we would have to say that this great message the message that brother Brandon brought to us he spearheaded not only a Revival of the signs wonders and miracles but he also spearheaded the teachings of the Bible the doctrines the things that we didn't understand and although not a theologian although not a a grammar student although he wouldn't be a scribe or someone that taught Greek or taught Hebrew this is how God has always chosen the ones that to to lead his people so he was a leader he he he he went forth and he raised the church into an atmosphere that we had never seen before uh the Believers had never seen anything like this a 20th century Prophet a messenger that had the signs wonders and miracles that our Bible said would be there we knew they were there biblically but to actually see this take place he went forth with a Ministry and a message as a leader to lead the way not just in the Revival remember that it's not just the Revival but it's the teachings it's the doctrines it's conduct order it's how to on every level somehow as we have moved on in our great wisdom and our great intellect we have forfeited the supernatural in many ways and we've taken the intellectual explanation mere arguing mere my point against your point but God didn't send a theologian to us he sent a Vindicated prophet and I introduced this to the church here about the other translations of the Bible and I wanted to bring that because I know that the sneakiness of Satan is always trying to find a better way than the way that God gave to us and you got to watch them because how can we receive more Revelation brother Israel you might ask how can we receive more Revelation but not add to the word we'll get into that in just a little bit it's because we're not adding anything new but what's already been written is now being revealed it's the words of the Lord it's the Mysteries that were already there that had to be uncovered and revealed that's a big difference than me coming up with some kind of idea oh let me see how this sounds let me throw this out there let me see what maybe this could be or maybe that could be some new idea that's not what we're talking about we're talking about taking the same Bible that everybody had and then raising it to a level like nobody else seen before that's what the prophet did in our last day and we follow that with all of our heart brother bam lays this discipline of not adding to or not taking away from the scriptures tell us not to do it and we want to always remain there so with that thought could we not say that every trouble every problem every issue that we see going on today is because this discipline was violated somewhere somebody added something somebody took something away it's very very simple Saints but it's the reality and that's what keeps and gives it its power every denomination was formed with the pretense of somebody trying to do it better trying to improve on what God had sent and so it always you know God sends a move and within that move you have intelligent people people who think people who study people who handle the word and around that group have these little ideas they always come up they come up within me they come up within you let's be honest and we have an idea about some or could it be or maybe it was or should it be or this is a better way but then you still have to bring it back to this discipline of not adding to it and not taking away from it um brother brandham takes the message God is uh interpreted in his word I think that's the title of it God is known by his own interpretation I'll get it for you in just a minute but in that message he he lays to us three must when handling God's word let me get it to you right now let me see if I can find it here quickly as he brings this to us three must when handling God's word are you interested in that that Christ is revealed in his own word that's the title I'm sorry is that right thank you yes I'm always asking somebody to help me preach and I need all the help I can get all right per 72 thank you thank you so much CU I got it we'll take it right here if the sister has it thank you now in order to study the scripture now this is not just preachers this is everybody because the Bible tells us all to study to uh to study the word of God this is how you memorize it this is how you know your place this is how you build faith is by studying the word now in order to study the scripture Paul told Timothy study it rightly dividing the word of God which is truth them is three them is three musts in the scripture and using God's word there's three things that you must not do now let's study those for the next 10 minutes three things that you must not do and all out in the land wherever you are Across the Nation be sure to put these down in your mind if you haven't got a pencil you must must not do these things well we tell you all the time how you must do now I'm going to tell you what you must not do so did Brother Adam tell us to put this in our mind he tell us to write it down if you got a pencil well he just talking to somebody no he's talking to me write it down remember this I need this as a minister I need this as a Christian you need it too every church needs needs this it's a discipline that he's given to us now you must not misinterpret the word you say well I believe it means this it means just what it says it needs no interpreter you must not misplace the word and you must not dislocate the word and if we would do either of these it throws the whole Bible in a confusion and in a chaos so the violation of any of these three throws the entire Bible into a confusion into a chaos what's the misinterpret it means to interpret it wrongly was it it mean to misplace to put it in the wrong place to put the wrong scripture in the wrong place and um what does it mean to dislocate shake it means to um disturb the normal Arrangement or mess up the original position move it from its proper place you disrupt you disturb you're take you're taking it out of the pattern it's like a dislocated shoulder your shoulder is there but it's dislocated it's not the joint it's not where it's supposed to be and this is what we must not do with the scriptures not just the script somebody we must not do this with the tapes with the Visions with the quotations even General commands that the Lord would give you cuz there are some things that the Lord reveals to you as a father and a mother and as a Christian the Lord will reveal to you things to do and to not to do concerning your career concerning daily life concerning concerning just B basic instruction that's what prayer is all about God is speaking to you he's leading you by his spirit and when he's leading you he speaks to you through this leading of the Holy Spirit and that's not just you know that's just not cheap words that's not secondary words that's the word of the Lord to you if it indeed is the Lord speaking to you sometimes we think we think of adding or taking away we think think of the Bible or we think of the message but let's go a little bit further and think of what instructions did the Lord give to you as a Believer as a mother as a father first of all how many you know what I'm talking about how many have these personal Inspirations personal dialogues things that God speaks to you maybe others can do this but not you you can't go there and you can't dress like that and you can't wear that like that God has to give every one of us has those little special places it's not something I would come up here and preach per se it's not notes I would burden that I'll put on someone else but everyone of us have it's a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus amen and we got to be true to that and we got to hold that very dear and we got not to add to that or take away away from that as well and so you put it in the wrong place you dislocate it you misinterpret it or you misplace it some of those some of those things we can see have been uh uh improperly uh handled this is why we have so many different interpretations of the visions of the message different versions of the message as we would call it would have to say that somebody violated this discipline of don't adding and don't take away let's take a few scriptures for you just for a moment just to bring the Bible into what what the Bible says about this we read it in Revelations chapter 22 and um there's just a few scriptures we read for you many times and we'll read them for you again actually we'll be reading them for the rest of our life in the Scripture it tells us that what things soever I command you this is Deuteronomy 12:32 what things soever I command you observe to do it thou sht not add there unto nor diminish from it Jeremiah 261 1 through3 verse two says thus sayeth the Lord stand in the court of the Lord's House speak unto all the cities of Judah which Come To Worship in the Lord's House all the words that I command thee to speak unto them diminish not a word if so be they will hearken and turn every man from his evil way that I may repent me of the evil which I purpos to do unto them because of the evil of their doings Deuteronomy 4: 1-3 hearken o Israel unto the statutes unto the judgments which I teach you for to do them that you may live and go in and possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers giveth you you shall not add unto the word which I command you neither shall you diminish off from it that ye may keep the Commandments of the Lord your God which I command you your eyes have seen what the Lord has done and but and and the scripture goes on many scriptures go on and on Deuteronomy 30 2 Kings chapter 23 Romans 2 11 there's no respect of persons with God all of these scriptures are laying in there and the Commandment is not to add to the word nor diminish a from the word because when we do that we take away the power when we add to it when we take away from it it's like you know the good part we seem to embrace that we have no problem talking to people about heaven and about the lovely butterflies and the beautiful flowers and the wonderful fragrances that will accompany heaven but we don't want to talk about the Judgment but hell is just as real as Heaven is and that is a a truth that was spoken out of the word and it was spoken in the word not so that we can diminish from speaking about it it's in the word so we can talk about it and there's in there for a purpose even if that word is a word even against us we have to say what the word says uh even about us and that is that is the beauty of it that is the you know we are we been harnessed with that we can't just come up and preach our family version we can't come up and preach something that's going to benefit us only slanted for our own personal game but a true witness man or woman will stay with the word if it hurts if it kills if it separates if it causes more to grow if it causes some to leave a True Believer will stay with the word they'll stay with that word because that word is God's word and not only is it God's word we are commanded to do so amen amen somebody so I don't have a version of the message to preach there's only one version there's many different churches that follow it but Heaven only said one version of Malachi 4 and that's the version I want to be a part of the version that came down from heaven the version that had the pillar of fire over it the version that fulfilled the Seven Seals the book of redemption amen amen so we see this these disciplines there's two characters in the Bible that by dilated this more than that but I'll take these two and one of them was King Saul in 1st Samuel chapter 15 how many remember the story where Samuel comes to Saul in in in Kings chapter 15 maybe we can turn there quickly now this isn't a commandment like scriptures this wasn't Doctrine for Israel this was Specific Instructions to a King from a prophet to a King on how to handle the amalekites and he had a reason for it God did and he sent this King down there to do his bidding amen and he had Specific Instructions you know what's beautiful about the word when the Lord gives it to you he he has it written down and then it's made plain so that he that readeth may run as habca 2 says so that we could know exactly what the word of the Lord is telling us you all have the scripture there [Music] oh yes they're going to make me ask twice three times four times all right let's see home sweet home praise the Lord okay now what was the scripture I called 2 Samuel 1 Samuel yes listening First Kings say it out loud somebody all right let me get my Bible out I believe I call 1 Samuel is what I called yes chapter 15 quickly Samuel said unto Saul the Lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the Lord thus sayth the Lord of hosts I remember that which amalik did to Israel as he laid weit for him in the way when he came up from Egypt now go and smite amalec and utterly destroy all that they have spare them not but slay both man woman infant suckling ox and sheep camel and ass and Saul gathered the people together number them and the scripture goes on to say that they go down and they take this great battle verse number eight and he took AAG the king of the amalaki alive and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword but Saul and the people spared AAG and the best of the sheep and of the oxin and of the Felines and the Lambs and that was good and would not utterly destroy them but everything that was vile and refused that they destroyed utterly so we know the rest of the story here there's clear instructions the Lord said said to go do it this way and Saul with his uh better idea the people came up to him and they influenced his decision to keep the best cattle I mean it's just a cow it's just we can use it for sacrifice and he spared the king and he kept the things that were more convenient the good things that they can use later on in worship to the Lord you know the Lord didn't like that in fact the Lord called did Evil it was evil what King Saul did because the Lord had gave him clear instructions and here he took away this one part of the instructions and look at the look at the downfall of his life look at the downfall of his ministry at this point the Lord it was repented that he even made Saul to be king it turned his heart that he would he would even do such a thing and he says well well I I've uh I've kept this for sacrifice to you Lord and the Lord said it's better to obey it's better to obey no matter what it costs no matter what the loss no matter what you gain what matter what you're not going to get it's better to obey because the Lord has it all figured out anyways and has a purpose on why he set the word in their the way he did the instructions for a minister a father a mother a deacon or things how to handle things we think we uh can evolve in our understanding or evolve in how to handle the different pressures and the different challenges of the day but the word of the Lord is still true and it's got the answer to every problem so we could say that every problem every situation that we would see that has gone off of the beaten path it's because they have violated and not keeping every word or they have taken away from the word how would you take away from the word you could take away from the word by not preaching it the way it was given to us let's take the example of the Holy Ghost and the need for it or the gifts of the spirit I don't know anyone that's going to get up and say that you know they don't believe the gift anybody in the message they don't believe the gifts are true they will say they're true because the Bible says it the message says it but will they will they take the stand for the gifts and actually say that they exist and we should have them in every local assembly and actually we we need them in every local assembly you know that's a you know that that that that requires a lot of energy and it's a it's a it's a no man's land for some of us but the word of the Lord is still true if you are listening to the tapes that's what the way the tapes bring it just exactly that way and that's the way we want to find it we don't want to gradually find ourselves doing things that is not in the message and we've seen that in many many uh times in our own life and many many uh assemblies uh today and so this this great uh King King Saul was the first king but he was replaced by King David he makes this eror of just adding this one little detail or just maybe adjusting this commandment I mean slay everything I mean he kept the king alive slay everything that was the command so it takes a discipline it takes a man who really obeys the Lord to look past what everybody said or the feelings of this one or know the little bitty baby they're so cute and we can reform them and we can make slaves out of them or we can use this later that wasn't the command maybe if he told me to do it that way we would do it that way but that's not what he said to do he said utterly destroy don't bring nothing back don't give you know Victory coming back look what I found look what I got don't bring nothing back that was a command and look at what Saul lost think about this how would this man love to get that back from that day forth the prophet stopped visiting him the anointing left him his kingdom was torn away from him and God stopped speaking to him in an evil spirit started to torment this man a man who felt the anointing before a man who was a true Israelite a man who was found out to be the King King Saul and he loses it all over this one little violation lost his ministry the anointing left him oh my and an evil spirit started to torment him I'll say this there's a reason for everything and things don't happen just for nothing there's a reason why we have to go through what we go through there's a reason why we're blessed the way we're blessed there's a reason why we have what we have or we don't have what we don't have there's a reason and if we get back to the word we'll find out what the reason is amen have I had it somewhere have I taken away somewhere oh Lord please help me let's take one more example our good Noble prophet and brother brother Moses in Numbers Chapter 20 you remember Moses that great prophet that the Lord called him to be the god to Israel and pulled him out of Egypt never seen a man like him before never never seen a Ministry like him before God just Rose him up or raised him up however you say it God just brought him out of nowhere seemingly what's his name Moses the deliverer he got so called up with these people that the Lord wanted to destroy the people and start over with Moses Moses throws himself in the breach in the gap for the people and the Lord stays his wrath because of Moses there's no man like Moses he spoke in the similitude between God God he saw God face he saw him he spoke to him lip to ear like a friend what a relationship but even this man Moses he comes to the Rock and the people pressured him and the pressure was great and they cried for water and he smoked the rock a second time and then the the Lord bypassed Moses correcting him no the Lord held that he says come here Moses come here it brought forth the water I'm going to honor your gift you smot it you asked for I'm going to give it to you but you magnified yourself in front of the people and therefore you cannot go into the land but Lord they made me do lord they're pressured Lord I've been through so much I look like a old man following after these people they tried to Stone me I saved their life but no I never told you to Smite that rock twice pressure huh happens to Great Men doesn't it can it happen to you has it happened to you yes it happens to us but I'm so glad for the grace of God for the blood that's still on the throne to atone for my ignorance I really don't want to ask had nothing Lord I really don't want to take away nothing Lord I want to say it the way you said it that might seem or appear a bit boring that might be like we heard that already but this is this is the reason why we have the problems that we have today you have to bring it back because this is this is what caused everything from the Garden of Eden remember the serpent came to Eve and and all he did he didn't add a whole paragraph he just took one word and he tweaked one word and added one word to it and it caused all the all of the fall and all the problems that we have today what about us today you know there's a scripture Our Believers in Jeremiah where the Lord asks why is not my people healed there is bomb in Gilead then why are my people not healed he'll ask that question brother bam takes a message and he preaches the message the way back he's preaching to the Pentecostals and he's talking about how they got off the beaten path through denominationalism they begin to argue and the fuss and to break away fellowship and you know that's what they did there but we have done that here today I've seen that done here today in our day in our message like the only ones guilty of that were the denominational huh but it's still a word of the Lord God never called us to denominate he called us to follow his instructions that he already laid out there and in those instructions there's things I don't understand but there's a revelation that he can give me of what his word says not adding anything new but revealing what is already there amen somebody praise the Lord now these different groups and Ministries that are there today they've come up they've added they've taken away brother bandam dealt with it he talked about how those ones in Arizona icing the tapes trying to make it say something that it does not say and that is easily done of course we wouldn't splice a tape today some people don't even know what that means but we will take part of the quote or part of the scripture or part of the truth and then the other part we won't preach about it or teach about it you know because someone might label us or tag us you know some kind of fanatic or something but you know we don't have a word to bring to nobody all we have is a word to follow what was brought to us and I am not trying to save my name in my reputation H uh because of what I stand on the word I'm trying to take a stand in the word I'm trying to build my reputation with my heavenly father and that reputation is built by me standing on his word even in a hostile environment even when they don't understand what you're saying even though they can't see or understand I want to be faithful and stand on his word yet the same amen amen amen amen let's take a few quotations here in the message wisdom works as Faith ex Express the prophet of God says this 1965 November 26 he says I don't care Judas could have done all kind of signs and wonders but when he come when he come to receive the holy ghost at the day of Pentecost he showed his colors that devil can come right up and impersonate right to the very thing till it comes to this word but he can't take all that word he can bring bring it all up maybe to one word like Eve did the devil did to Eve but he can't cross it all because the only the whole thing is the body of Christ see word now neither they could not cannot take the message now neither could Janice and jambers take Moses's message they could not do it their works of impersonation was made known because they they could not be able to follow God's word Vindicated by his anointing OED Prophet the message wisdom versus Faith paragraph 184 he says this wait just a moment we'll get back to the seat again what was it the devil tried to do with wisdom make God's word say something that it didn't say that's right he tried to make God's word say something that it didn't say so that's the way it comes today when they try to make God's word say something that it doesn't say continues on in that same message in paragraph 197 and he says this here wisdom as Satan was presenting to her said You shall not surely die see it's trying to make the word say something that it isn't so that's what wisdom is today oh brother how do we t on that seminary schools of theology that's their nest that's their Grassroots is trying to make God's word say something that it doesn't say that's what they try to do as I was talking about the different interpretations of the Bible how there's many of them and I know that there's some beautiful you know commentaries and ways to comprehensively understand the word different interpretations and brother random used the Greek diet loock and he talked about the ls of Bible and other translations all those things are great all those things are good but what did he use to bring the word he used the old King James version of the Bible and I would I would re strongly resist anyone that would want to change that discipline because there's a reason for it if the ESV or the NIV or whatever version Bible was the more accurate and correct one that we should use and the message of Malachi 4 was to restore all things don't you think he would tell us that so if he didn't tell us that who told us that these other virgins were the ones that we should take please understand I'm not against them I use them all the time everybody understand that I I listen to them I listen to other people preach I listen to commentary I listen to you know scientists of the day I listen to debates all the time I love hearing other people I I talk and listen and all those things when it comes to my soul and studying the word and preparing something to bring to the church it's got to be out of Malachi 4 it's got to be the way the prophet brought it why because Satan is too crafty and too slick and he's not done interpreting the scriptures there'll be another version of the Bible better than the King James quote unquote so what did God use he uses he uses the prophetic channel to bring not only the Visions Supernatural but the teachings and the doctrine we read it for you many times where brother random says that the angel of the Lord taught him these things in the scripture amen so that's what we're following and so we want to highlight we want to keep that you know uh uh um assurity in your mind um we believe in fellowship with others we believe that there's salvation in Jesus Christ and him alone that can be in any church any assembly anywhere and we should should welcome that we shouldn't be so hard against other people that are following their Bible or trying to live for God we should embrace that amen but what we've done is we've made the message another denominations some have have made their understanding of the message like another denomination and brother Bram didn't do that and so it takes uh that discipline to stay with with the way he brought it the way he said it and because that was the prophetic inspiration on how to handle the word amen the there's some great smart men out there today that can get the history and break down the Greek and the Hebrew and we applaud that it's beautiful we use it we wouldn't have a Bible today without it please understand the doctors of divinity and these great men that find no no the finding of the the Deep Sea Scrolls and adding and and the Beautiful things that are brought to the Christian faith and Christian Heritage we don't we don't discount any of that but God sent us the message of Malachi 4 and that's what we're supposed to stay with so in a 100 years from today our church should replicate what's on them tapes and what's in the Bible amen not be something different look how they've changed look how the worship has changed in the denomination the worship in the denomination has come more like a club party atmosphere and they've got some kind of worship band leader and it's rock and roll ver you know slash Christianity but it's really rock and roll if you take if you take all the names out and if you take it you take all the titles of what it is it sounds like rock and roll is that the Christian Church am I supposed to come to church and wonder is this a rock and roll song or am I supposed to worship with this huh but that's what the denominations that's come to and if we follow their pattern that's what we come to but I'm so glad God didn't call me to follow no denomination he called me out of that they don't have nothing to bring to me for my soul God sent Elijah the prophet yes gifts talents or without repentance and we thank God for that but the leadership on how to conduct worship has to come out of this word here amen somebody yes because Satan is very crafty he tries to make it say something the word says something that it doesn't say so he he has to get his way in there some kind of way and he can't get in here with just straight up craziness he's got to have some language have something similar look close to what we're doing and then we drop our guards down and then he drops a seed of intellect in there the brother randam is dealing with this in the message um the Antichrist this are questions and answers 1964 and this is this is very interesting how he's talking about the Beatles and what they did and he takes his time to read an article from their manager let me see if I can find it here real quick I didn't give it to the sister in the back I just gave her paragraph number nine questions and answers number 64 he says it's so filthy and dirty and Antichrist you see it's Satan on a mock campaign see he does anything that Christ can do but he can't confirm the word see he'll take part of it here but he can't take it all together see he can't get it together so you see no wonder the Bible said that would almost fool the very elected if it was possible the Antichrist spirit that was in questions and answers number two 1964 almost fool the very elected if it was possible the Antichrist he says even their own press manager so he's talking about the Beatles here and how these beetles I thought I put it in here their own manager was quoting from them and brother bandam reads the whole statement how they it's incredible absolutely incredible says Derek Taylor The Beatles press officer here are these four boys from Liverpool they're rude they're profane they're vulgar and they've taken over the world it's as if they've founded a new religion they're completely Antichrist I mean I'm Antichrist as well but they are so Antichrist they shock me which isn't an easy thing but I'm obsessed with them isn't everybody that's on the tape sister I think she's trying to find it brother Bam's actually reading that on the tape this is the Beatles press manager he says I'm Antichrist but they're more Antichrist and they shock me he says I am upset with them and then and then with that anointing there were actually he people were being healed following these Beatles so if you don't have the discipline of staying with the word you'll think well and you'll change your tune but there when you know what the word says about it you know how to place it it doesn't move you one bit somebody with the anointing and and the impressiveness to bring healing and the song is so inspiring and if they're actually obsessed with it and the Christian Church many of them couldn't catch it many of them couldn't catch it here here it this right here I'm obsessed with them it's isn't everybody I'm obsessed with their honesty and the people who like them most are the people who should be outraged most in Australia for example each time we arrive at the airport it was if we the gal had landed or better yet the Messiah the root The Roots were lying solid cripples threw away their sticks sick people rushed up to the car as if the touch from one of the boys would make them well again old women stood watching ING with their grandchildren and as we pass by I could see the look on their faces it was if some savior had arrived and all these people were happy and relieved as if things somehow were going to be better now Taylor Paul stuck a cigarette in his mouth the only thing left for the Beatles he said is to go on a healing tour this is their manager talking about the anointing on these boys Bo and we say well brother is that was backed in you better wake up son sister daughter you better wake up that anoint that obsessive it's it's an obsession there's an anointing on that and they leading mega churches today with this anointing come on somebody huh where are we at Saints everybody getting up and singing ain't for me every type of worship ain't for me no no sir there is a way that God has provided for me and it's the oldfashioned blood gospel it's the way that's been proven it's brought us through the great hard trials and tests it's got context it's got meaning to the word words there's a revelation in it amen somebody you'll lose this when you add or you take away is that right we can add more We'll add so much by default we're taken away from the old way that we've done okay 11:45 all right thank you I'm going to take my time this morning let's take the seven seal just for a moment all right Saints how many love the Lord It's a discipline you want to develop you you want to judge all things with this with this within your spirit Mom Dad you need to have this in you young young Minister song leader whoever you are Deacon trustee young person coming up like this here older person newly baptized whoever you are you need to develop this discipline in your spirit you got to have this within you to judge all things with the word through the lenses of the word of the Lord this is the hour that we in it's a terrible treacherous time but a beautiful time too now brother brandham tells us that Satan cannot take the word word by word he can't do it now he can impersonate any kind of a gift he can impersonate this sermon somebody preaching somebody look like me he can take a preacher make him look exactly like a preacher message preacher and just a total impersonation but he can't take the word word by word he can't take he can't take every Vision he can take most of them he could take a lum but every single detail all the way to the E can't take it this separates him from the True Believer and brother bam says this in the seventh seal paragraph 259 remember Satan will try to impersonate he'll try to impersonate everything that the church will do he's tried to do it we notice it through the Antichrist but this is one thing he cannot impersonate there'll be no mimics to this see cuz he don't know it there's no way for him to know it it's the third pool look at your neighbor say third pool he just knows nothing about it Hallelujah when was the last time you said third pool this is one thing Satan can't know Saints this is our Escape up out of here this is our protection this is what's keeping my Ministry this is what's keeping my Revelation it is the third pool message the unfolding of God's word to his bride amen amen it's the third pool he doesn't understand it let's take one more in the message Christ is revealed in his own word paragraph 27 the prophet of God says this today so confused about the evidence of the Holy Ghost and so forth Satan can impersonate any kind of a gift that God has got but he cannot bring that word word by word that's where he failed in the Garden of Eden that's where he's always failed that's where them the tape on false anointed ones and anointed ones they can be Anointed with the spirit speak in tongues dance shout preach the gospel and steal a devil all right look at that so so what's the difference brother Israel so this this this when we're talking about every word brother will when we're talking about every word brother LSI and Saints so so the blessings of the Lord are unlimited and and that is you know healing gifts you know I it it it's about how much you believe you can have as much as you believe all right it it it's according to your faith amen so if you want you want half of your cup full this morning well that's on you that's right right a full cup is available if you only got half of a cup it's not because he didn't have a full cup for you you you can have your cup full how many know that this morning you can leave out of here with your bowl full with the blessings of almighty God if you ask him for it he'll give it to you if you believe him for it he'll give it to you you have not because you ask not say Lord fill my cup this morning Lord give me a double portion give me a touchdown in my soul like I never did you ask for that you have not because you ask not this is these are percentages these are you know based on you and your faith he that sold sparingly reaped sparingly he that sold bountifully reaped that's the scriptures First Corinthians talks about it but with the word word it's not so with the word it's not percentages like you got 90% right or 99 with the word god commands us to get it all and to believe it all and it is this blessing that entitles us to the Token when we believe it all not believe most not believe more than we used to but believe it all amen you mean 1965 all 472 yes all of it even the Book of habca Numbers yes all of it plus whatever God will reveal to you God reveals to you that your entire family will be saved you can relieve that amen amen you can receive that so we know that Satan can't keep the word word by word he can't do it this is what separates the True Believer just this discipline alone don't add don't take away and every bit of it is the word of the Lord don't misinterpret don't misplace it don't dislocate it leave it alone leave it the way it is and God will vindicate it in its due time the Bible the prophet of God takes in Christ is revealed in this old word and he says this here paragraph number 57 to answer our question on you know the Revelation as we receive more Revelation it's not new it's new to us but it's not new to the economy of God we're not adding new new message theology no you can't if you do you going to have something different than what's on the tape and that's where some of them have steered and and we have steered we've gone down that path we've intellectually we've thought yeah maybe that could be maybe that is a correct interpret maybe maybe you know maybe my pastor's writing brother Brandon was wrong some have gone down that path you need to get back where the angel is you need to find out where the angel of the Lord is because the angel of the Lord is leading someone and it's a prophet and then the people are following that Prophet that was led by the angel of the Lord amen is this too old for y'all this is exactly where we are today brother branam takes Christ is revealed in his own word and he says this he says like the Seven Seals look at this temptation come to him the Seven Seals someone kept saying to me now you the Lord will speak to you brother Brandon when these seals are revealed and will tell us how to get closer to God and how to do it like all the Bible didn't have that information already in there how to get closer to God but no the Seven Seals this campaign is going to tell us how to get closer to what about the Bible Church what about all the instructions in the Bible turning a corner he say we turn a corner we turn what does that mean turn the corner like we stop believing the message now turn the corner turn the corner like my Bible don't mean that no more turn the corner what you mean turn the corner how many's heard that term oh we've turned the corner today so we don't go to church no more uh you need to find a corner that has a church on it and turn inside that corner and go to the Altar and start praising the Lord because because if you turn the corner where we don't go to church no more tell me who told you that the devil e interpreter exactly right no no wait this is fresh this is fresh everything God gave us was fresh you say this is fresh is it's something new I never heard before I don't want to know nothing about nothing that God didn't send to me God sent to me his word and that's where we should remain let's take this here paragraph 57 the Seven Seals kept saying now the Lord will speak to you brother Brandon when these seals are revealed and will tell us how to get closer to God and how to do it I said no sir it can't be because the Bible the Seven Seals on it had the seven Mysteries hid it was already wrote but they didn't understand what it was it was already wrote friends but the people didn't understand what it was and the Seven this is why the seven seal book The Mystery it's it seems boring to some people but they don't realize young people included little ones older ones that the seven seal book the message is is for you you teenagers go pick it up and read it something's in there for you the great mystery to be revealed revealed that was hidden in back part of God's mind to be revealed in the last days hidden and it looks like he ain't really even say nothing go read it again read it until it makes you cry read it till you fill it in your bones read it until an amen comes from your spirit and you'll do what John did when he saw what was taking place man he screamed out didn't he everybody heard I John yes it'll have an emotion it'll have effect upon you like a man drinking wine the little church mouse Hallelujah hiding in the church and running from the cat all the time the cat chasing him around he's hiding all the time and somebody spilled some wine in the church and that little mouse ran through there and got some wine on his hands they start licking that wine off of his hands and he start feeling good like man his courage built up he started feeling like I ain't no mouse and he said where's the cat at and that's what a revelation will do to you you'll stop running around you'll get you'll get a revelation that he is good all taste and see that the Lord is good he'll never leave you or forsake you you find out you're a son of God you're a daughter of God Amen yes Christ is revealed in his own word brother manam continues paragraph 128 so did you all get that you all got that the Seven Seals wasn't nothing new it was the mystery that was here it was already written but we didn't know what it was let's take one mystery real quick real quick it's in St John chapter 3 quickly there a sneaky one but it's there he asked brother Neville what do you say about that what does that mean he said we'll get to it tonight and he didn't never did get to it but another message he brought it out in St John chapter 3 Jesus speaking to Nicodemus let's see if I can find it here verse 13 it says verse 12 if I have told you Earthly things and you believe not how shall you believe if I tell you of heavenly things and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven brother brand touches this and that's a strong one now ask your trinitarian and friends to explain that no don't ask them don't ask them it's just a debate ask God to reveal it to you what that means it means that he was the omnipotent one not a second person he was the person even the son of man who is now in heaven and he the son of man is talking to these people here but the son of man is even in heaven he was the omnipotent one the word made flesh he that was from the beginning not a trinitarian but he was God himself little details like that little statements that are laying in little things that are said on the tapes even like the new name of God and many things the seven Thunders what did they utter John saw it he's about to write he said don't write it then brother random sees it and he can't make it out and the Lord forbids him from bringing it on the tape on what that third thing was what was that so there things that are there that will be revealed I don't have to make anything up and so that seven seal the Mysteries are already written but it has to be revealed and as they're being revealed you should be able to see your name in there somehow some way it's related to you let's take paragraph 128 and Christ is revealed in his own word amen and then that'll be our last one musicians prepare to come back please paragraph 12 all the other words I don't care how well they are placed how who they come from what denomination they come from or how smart the man is is to be absolutely ignored anything contrary to the word you want to put that scripture down it's Galatians 1 18 see Paul said though we or an angel from heaven would preach any other thing than this you've already heard let him be accursed and other words if an angel would come to you from Heaven a bright shining Angel and would stand boy that would be bait for this day wouldn't it bright shining Angel come up there stand and say things was contrary to the word you say Satan get away from me right if he's a bishop ship if you whatever he is don't you never believe him if he doesn't speak exactly with that Bible word by word watch him he'll carry you with the Bible now he'll carry you to a certain place and then hook it right there when you see the Bible saying one thing and he bypasses that watch him right there that's on the tapes that's on the Visions that's on everything all right they bypass Little Things They ignore little statements but it's all there see that's the way he done Eve he come right down and said everything just exactly God said this that's right Eve amen we'll believe that together well God said this amen we believe that together God said this yeah we believe that sure well but God said we'll die well now you know he's a good God he didn't say he wouldn't you know but surely oh me there he is and brother brandham is showing us how Satan takes that word in the Bible and he brings it up to a certain spot brings it up brings it up brings it up and then he hooks it right there he adds something or he says you know that's not reasonable it can't be you know maybe maybe the prophet was wrong you see what happened in 1977 you remember that you see this you see it's say Satan trying to throw you off from the word of the Lord that God has given to you so we want to take these disciplines of staying with the word don't add don't take away and um don't misinterpret don't misplace it don't dislocate it even in our instructions that the Lord has revealed to us and um move forward into What the Lord Has revealed to us and stay with but that word no matter what and it will entitle us to the great token every word of it believ in every word of it entitles it the token is a sign that the purchase has been made he says paragraph 338 it's been made and been accepted now you can't get that token from the railroad Fair until you pay the price and the only way you're going to pay the price is pay it that's right what believe it accept it full obedience to the whole word of God will entitle you to the Token full obedience not the part of it as far as your denomination goes but all of it full obedience to the word which is Christ brings you into Christ this has liberated my Ministry Saints this has liberated me as an individual and I believe it'll liberate you too as I we continue to go forward full obedience to every word not as far as the group takes you is this one or that one says but this is what the word of the Lord has given to us and let's receive it all and God will bless you as he blessed Joshua made him successful God was with him God bless you he'll make you successful in these same truths amen am let us pray Lord Jesus we ask your blessings upon your people this morning the word that we heard we ask you Lord to remind us of how achen Lost It All by Disobedience to the they didn't even they didn't even hurt anyone personally they just they lied within themselves to the Holy Ghost and you saw that and you caught it and it me really meant something it it wasn't even it wasn't an adultery they didn't they didn't even take from anyone they didn't murder anyone it wasn't anger or aggression they didn't have a temper they just simply they simply lied and and and to the agreement that they had and Lord you saw that and it caused death to them it caused death to achin one little bad direction from what what the Lord had instructed him to do and he lost his whole family over it but oh God how Joseph stayed faithful job he stayed faithful to the sacrifice Joshua stayed faithful to every word those are the examples we want to take Lord today may you grant it we pray we ask in Jesus name Amen in times like this we need our savior in times like this yes we need an be very sure how many want to be sure today I want my anchor to hold on the
