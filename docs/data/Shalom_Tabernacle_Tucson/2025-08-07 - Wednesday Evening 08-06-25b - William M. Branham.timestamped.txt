[22:17] Lord.
[22:19] [Music]
[22:20] God bless you. You may be seated brother
[22:22] Brandham.
[22:26] And I have had the privilege of praying
[22:28] for kings and
[22:31] monarchs and potent takes and I have
[22:34] never seen the Lord turn one down yet,
[22:35] but what he healed him. Congressman
[22:37] Upshaw or one out of our United States
[22:39] government. He had been an enable in a
[22:41] wheelchair for 66 years and was
[22:43] instantly healed. Now I never heard of
[22:46] the man in my life. He was sitting way
[22:47] back in the audience in a wheelchair
[22:49] when the Lord Jesus showed the vision of
[22:52] what happened and what was taking place
[22:54] and he was made completely whole and we
[22:57] are thankful for that. Perhaps I just
[23:00] How many ever heard of his case of how
[23:02] he was healed?
[23:04] Not too many. I believe I'm going to
[23:07] read just a little scripture here and
[23:08] just give that for a testimony because I
[23:10] only have about 10 minutes to speak and
[23:13] I will speak tomorrow night. may be come
[23:15] early and the the second or third
[23:20] chapter of the acts of the apostles the
[23:23] the beginning with the first verse now
[23:26] Peter and John went up together at the
[23:28] temple at the hour of prayer being the
[23:30] ninth hour and a certain man lame from
[23:34] his mother's wombs whom they carried
[23:36] daily laid at the gate of the temple
[23:39] which is called beautiful
[23:41] to ask arms of them that entered into
[23:43] the temple
[23:45] who seeing Peter and John about to enter
[23:47] into the as of the temple asked alms.
[23:51] And Peter fastened his eye on him with
[23:54] John said, "Look on us." And he gave
[23:57] heed unto them, expecting to receive
[24:00] something of them. Then Peter said,
[24:03] "Silver and gold have I none, but such
[24:06] as I have give I thee, in the name of
[24:09] Jesus Christ Nazareth, rise up." And he
[24:13] took the man by the right hand and lift
[24:16] up. And immediately his feet and ankle
[24:18] bones received strength. And he leaping
[24:21] up stood and walking and leaping and
[24:26] praising God. May the Lord add his
[24:29] blessing to the reading of the word.
[24:33] This was a a great time in the in the
[24:35] temple and that day is the apostles.
[24:38] Their heart was all filled with joy and
[24:41] pleasure. They had just had received a
[24:45] new experience of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[24:49] Their hearts were full of joy. They
[24:51] thought my at some knew something had
[24:54] happened. They were elated to know that
[24:57] the Holy Spirit had had come. The long
[25:00] promise of the father. In Luke 24:49,
[25:03] Jesus told his disciples, "You shall or
[25:06] said, "Tear ye in the city of Jerusalem
[25:07] until you're endued with power from on
[25:09] high." Acts 1:8, he said, "You shall
[25:12] receive power. After this, the Holy
[25:14] Spirit has come upon you. You'll be
[25:15] witnesses of me in Jerusalem, Judea,
[25:18] Samaria, and the uttermost parts of the
[25:20] earth." To know that this same blessing
[25:22] that was upon them was to go to the
[25:25] uttermost parts of the earth, even
[25:27] today. The same, it's never reached over
[25:30] about onethird of the earth till this
[25:32] time after 2,000 years. And we've got
[25:35] twothirds of the earth yet to go over
[25:37] with this same gospel. For this
[25:40] demonstration of power must be to the
[25:43] uttermost parts of the earth. A few days
[25:45] later when Jesus was received up into
[25:47] glory, the last words he said to his
[25:49] disciples, "Go into all the world and
[25:51] preach the gospel." That's the whole
[25:53] world now. These signs shall follow them
[25:55] that believe in my name. They shall cast
[25:57] out devils, speak with new tongues, take
[25:59] up serpents, or drink deadly things. It
[26:01] would not harm them. If they lay their
[26:03] hands on the sick, they shall recover.
[26:06] It is written in the scripture that
[26:07] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[26:09] today, and forever. Hebrews 13:8. We
[26:13] cannot deny that. That's God's word. The
[26:16] only way that I might bypass it to
[26:18] justify my unbelief. But if I have to
[26:21] look and say, is it the word? Yes or no?
[26:23] It is the word. And when Jesus said when
[26:26] he was here on earth, he didn't claim to
[26:29] be a great person. He claimed to be
[26:31] just. He was a servant. He was the son
[26:35] of God. And he took of made himself no
[26:38] reputation. I was thinking the other
[26:40] day, the man that made the artificial
[26:41] arm made a reputation for himself. But
[26:44] the man who made the real arm made of
[26:47] himself no reputation. The man who made
[26:49] the artificial eye made a reputation for
[26:52] making it. But the man who made the real
[26:53] eye made of himself no repetition. He
[26:56] brought himself down. God Jehovah
[26:59] inveiled in flesh come down to sacrifice
[27:02] himself for our sins and sickness. The
[27:05] love of God, it could not be thought of
[27:08] how deep and how pure and how rich and
[27:11] how high to know that God would do such
[27:14] for his enemies. Not for his his lovely
[27:17] ones who love him, but for his enemies.
[27:20] I've often thought if God was willing to
[27:23] die for his enemies to save his enemies
[27:26] from hell, surely he'd be willing to
[27:29] heal his children's sickness. Don't you
[27:30] think so? If he's so mindful of his
[27:33] enemies. Now, in this great hustle of
[27:37] the early apostles time, how that they
[27:40] were gloriously uh happy because they
[27:43] had had an experience. They had
[27:46] something. That's what's the need today
[27:49] is an experience. If we were going to
[27:51] take a trip to California and go someone
[27:53] was going to drive you, you sure
[27:55] wouldn't want a a driver that had never
[27:57] drove a car before. You'd hunt somebody
[28:00] who had an experience. If you were going
[28:02] had to have surgery or dental work, you
[28:06] certainly wouldn't get somebody who
[28:07] didn't know what they were talking
[28:08] about. You would get somebody who had an
[28:10] experience. And that's the way it is
[28:12] when we go to talk about God. Let's get
[28:15] somebody who's got an experience, who
[28:17] knows what they're speaking of. And
[28:19] these apostles had had the experience of
[28:22] Pentecost. They were blessed. They had
[28:24] divine joy and their hearts were all
[28:27] bubbling over. The whole world belonged
[28:29] to them. And isn't it too bad that we
[28:32] have lost that joy tonight? That divine
[28:34] joy and what they once had. And then I
[28:38] think of how that the world needs the
[28:40] experience that they had at that time.
[28:43] Now we think of Moses when Moses in a
[28:47] burning bush. This sheep herder one
[28:50] morning walking along the old path where
[28:52] he'd walked many times and there he was
[28:55] attracted by a burning bush. Come to
[28:58] find out the angel of the Lord was in
[29:00] this bush. And now he speaks to Moses.
[29:03] Moses had been a bitter failure for yet
[29:07] knowing that God was going to deliver
[29:09] the children of Israel by him yet trying
[29:12] to do it within himself 40 years before
[29:14] that become a failure and had lost all
[29:17] the vision of victory and of freedom for
[29:20] the people in
[29:26] knowing that God is promised to deliver
[29:29] the church from its sin and from its
[29:32] sickness and to make a people, a salty
[29:35] people that the earth will hunger and
[29:37] thirst after. I wonder in our human
[29:39] efforts, in our theologies and so forth,
[29:42] and our great fine buildings and so
[29:44] forth that as we tried to present to the
[29:46] people many years ago and we found that
[29:49] it has failed because we tuck it in
[29:52] ourselves to do so. We tuck it upon
[29:54] ourselves to have new schools to educate
[29:57] our ministers and so forth. We left off
[30:00] the real principle, the real thing that
[30:03] God told us to receive was let the Holy
[30:06] Spirit lead the church. We've left that
[30:08] off and it's we've lost our divine joy.
[30:11] We have the vision is dull now. People
[30:14] are not looking for the coming of the
[30:16] Lord and yet atomic bombs hanging in
[30:18] hangers everywhere and things that would
[30:20] destroy the world at once. But people
[30:22] has lost their vision of the Lord
[30:25] because they have set times that the
[30:28] Lord would come at a certain time and uh
[30:30] they've done all these things trying to
[30:32] do it within themselves. We must turn
[30:34] loose and let God do these things. How
[30:37] can we do those things without the Holy
[30:39] Spirit and now Moses had been a bitter
[30:42] failure? But out there now we see
[30:45] tension attracted to a burning bush and
[30:48] he looks to the burning bush to find out
[30:51] what the trouble was and walking close
[30:53] to it. Fire usually brings an
[30:57] attraction.
[30:58] Usually the Holy Spirit when it comes in
[31:00] a manner of fire attracts the attention
[31:03] of people. And when Moses turned aside
[31:06] to consider this burning tree that would
[31:09] not burn up, God spoke to him. A fresh
[31:12] vision by an angel. Now watch faith take
[31:16] a hold right quick. The old things are
[31:19] passed away. But Moses now has a new
[31:22] vision. He has a revelation. He has an
[31:24] experience. He had met God. He had
[31:27] talked to God. Before that he had not
[31:30] met God. He had only read knowed what
[31:31] his mother had told him by by hearing
[31:34] what his mother had said or hearing what
[31:36] the pastor had said. But now Moses has a
[31:40] personal experience.
[31:42] That's what the church needs tonight is
[31:44] just stop studying so much theology and
[31:46] get down to the altar and pray until a
[31:49] personal experience burns down into the
[31:51] human heart and burns out all the
[31:53] dullness and gives a new vision. Moses
[31:56] now was experienced. He had witnessed
[31:59] the power of the Lord God. He had
[32:02] witnessed it and both in divine healing.
[32:05] His hand was smitten with leprosy. He
[32:07] put it into his bosom and pulled it out
[32:09] and it was healed. He knew that God was
[32:12] a healer and God was with him and had
[32:14] personally revealed himself to him.
[32:17] That's the way that the Holy Spirit had
[32:19] come on this apostle who said, "Such as
[32:22] I have."
[32:23] &gt;&gt; That's what we need tonight. an
[32:25] experience personal with God. Moses got
[32:29] the personal experience. Now watch faith
[32:31] jump in. Watch the difference in Moses
[32:33] now. Away he goes to Egypt. A one-man
[32:35] invasion going down to take over.
[32:37] Nothing in his hand but a dry stick. But
[32:39] he went out to do it and accomplish what
[32:42] God told him to because he had a fresh
[32:44] vision from God. If anything the church
[32:47] needs tonight and what we're trying to
[32:49] do, friend, is to bring a fresh vision
[32:52] from the presence of God to let the
[32:54] people see that God still lives and
[32:56] reign and moving with his church and he
[32:58] will until Jesus comes to receive it. A
[33:01] vision of experience once the little
[33:04] fellow by the name of David such a he
[33:07] went up to the armies where his brothers
[33:10] was to take up some cakes and raisins
[33:12] for them. And we find out that a great
[33:14] bully by the name of Goliath stood
[33:17] across the creek on the other side of
[33:18] the hill and making a brag and a mock to
[33:21] Israel. Finding out that they had lost
[33:23] their faith. They had lost their
[33:25] experience with God. And they were all
[33:28] quietened down. No one said a thing.
[33:30] They were afraid of that big bully. But
[33:32] he come out and made his brag in the
[33:34] ears of somebody who believed God. That
[33:37] was little David, a little sheepkin coat
[33:39] on. Perhaps just a ruddy little lad. He
[33:42] runs up and said, "Let me go fight that
[33:45] uh enemy. Do you mean to tell me that
[33:47] you the armies of the living God will
[33:50] stand and let that uncircumcised
[33:52] Philistine defy the armies of the living
[33:55] God while he put his brethren to shame?"
[33:58] What we need tonight is somebody with an
[34:00] experience like David who will stand up
[34:02] and say that you mean to tell me that
[34:04] that you'll let man and people rise up
[34:07] and tell you the days of miracles is
[34:09] passed and that Jesus blood dried up
[34:11] 1900 years ago and all we need today is
[34:13] a join the church. What we need today is
[34:15] a good oldfashioned St. Paul's revival
[34:17] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost like
[34:19] fell on the day of Pentecost to bring a
[34:21] people back to a living faith in God
[34:23] again. That's exactly I believe in
[34:26] confessions to raise up and accept Jesus
[34:28] Christ. That's a good I believe in all
[34:31] of that. But friends, we need something
[34:32] more than that. Abraham believed God by
[34:35] faith and he gave him the seal of
[34:37] circumcision as a confirmation of his
[34:39] faith. And when you say you got faith in
[34:41] God, God's under obligation if your
[34:43] faith is right to give you the baptism
[34:44] of the Holy Ghost right there to confirm
[34:46] that he has accepted your faith. Amen.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now notice little David
[34:53] when he got ready to go out to fight the
[34:55] giant while the the king he admired his
[34:58] courage I guess he said now son I
[35:00] certainly admire your courage but you
[35:02] remember we're not living in the days of
[35:04] Moses anymore we're living in the days
[35:06] when these things are passed he said
[35:08] come over here nevertheless I'll
[35:09] equipped you up so he took his own armor
[35:11] off and put it on the little boy David
[35:14] and he put his his shield in his hand
[35:16] and the great big armor that he had
[35:20] almost waited little David down. And he
[35:22] said, "Well, here, take this thing off
[35:24] of me. I've never tried it yet. I've
[35:27] never proved it. I don't know what it
[35:29] is." But there's one thing he did have.
[35:31] He had a personal experience with a
[35:33] slingshot that he know God was with him
[35:34] in that slingshot. That's what he need.
[35:36] Saul found out that the ecclesiastical
[35:39] vest of Saul didn't fe fit a man of God.
[35:42] And so, it weighed him down. That's
[35:44] what's a trouble with a lot of men
[35:45] today. as I meet as I cross the land,
[35:47] man of great standing and high churches
[35:49] and things. They believe this message of
[35:52] deliverance. They believe the message of
[35:54] the Lord Jesus and his power, but
[35:56] they're so shackled down with church
[35:57] denominations till they can't see no
[35:59] farther than their church. And they
[36:00] won't let them any farther. What we need
[36:02] today is somebody to step out with some
[36:04] experience with a slingshot like David
[36:06] had. David said, "I don't know nothing
[36:08] about your theology and about these
[36:10] swords and so forth, but your servant
[36:12] with this slingshot, I had an experience
[36:14] out there that God let me kill a lion
[36:17] with it and kill a bear with it. If
[36:18] he'll let me kill a lion with it, surely
[36:20] that uncircumcised Philistine belongs to
[36:22] me this afternoon. God, give us some
[36:24] more ruddy boys with that kind of a
[36:26] ruddy experience that'll take God at his
[36:28] word and believe him for everything he
[36:30] says. It's a truth."
[36:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we need tonight, my
[36:33] dear Christian friends. And now I want
[36:36] you to notice he went out and proved
[36:39] exactly that God was with him because he
[36:41] had an experience that God could deliver
[36:45] the enemy into his hand by his
[36:46] slingshot. A little old fellow one time
[36:48] by the name of Samson. Little
[36:50] curly-headed fellow about like that. I
[36:52] see the artist paint his picture
[36:54] sometimes. The doors would hardly go
[36:56] across this auditorium here. Well, it
[36:58] wouldn't be no mystery to me to see a
[37:00] man like that pick up the city gates and
[37:01] walk away with it. A man of that size.
[37:04] It wouldn't be no mystery. Or to lay a
[37:06] lion with his hands, a man of that size.
[37:09] But they've got the wrong slate. Samson
[37:11] was a little bitty fella. Little
[37:13] curly-headed fella. Seven little curls
[37:15] hanging down like a little And he
[37:17] looked like he was anything else but
[37:19] what uh would be a man. But when the
[37:21] spirit of God come up on him, he could
[37:23] slay a lion or anything but taken the
[37:25] spirit of God. And one day when he was
[37:27] all backed up with the side of a hill
[37:29] and a thousand Philistines was up on him
[37:32] and he know nothing to do but he picked
[37:33] up an old dry jawbone of a mule and felt
[37:37] back to see if them seven ox was still
[37:39] there. He waited in with all he had and
[37:41] slayed that thousand Philistines with
[37:43] nothing else he had to give him but he
[37:44] said I haven't got nothing but a jawbone
[37:46] to give you so I'll give it to you. And
[37:48] he slayed a thousand Philistines. What
[37:50] we need today is some people to get
[37:52] right down to real business with God. I
[37:54] was going into a football stadium one
[37:56] time where I was to have a service and a
[37:58] sign up over the door, I'll never forget
[38:00] it, says, "It's not the size of the dog
[38:02] in the fight. It's the size of the fight
[38:04] in the dog." That's what we need tonight
[38:06] is somebody's got enough courage and
[38:08] backbone. No matter if you don't belong
[38:09] to a denomination, if you got a DD or
[38:11] what you got, you've got Jesus Christ on
[38:13] your side as long as you preach the
[38:15] uncompromising word of the living God
[38:17] and stand on the same God's promised
[38:19] that he would back it up and would
[38:21] That's exactly true. I remember a little
[38:23] fellow named Shamguard down there in in
[38:25] the time of the judges. He didn't have
[38:27] nothing. He wasn't a warrior. He didn't
[38:29] know nothing about fighting the
[38:30] Philistines to come over and steal
[38:32] everything they got. As soon as they got
[38:33] a little bit, build up some supplies and
[38:35] the Philistines will come in, rob them,
[38:37] take it away. That's just about the way
[38:39] we do in revival meetings today. We'll
[38:41] go and get a a revival started and as
[38:44] soon as the evangelist leaves or the
[38:45] people get scattered out, then in comes
[38:47] the Philistines and say, "Now the days
[38:49] of miracles is passed. There's no such a
[38:50] thing as that. It's only the It's only
[38:52] psychology. It's it's mental telepathy
[38:54] or something in that order. Oh my. I can
[38:57] see a little old sham guard standing
[38:59] there looking down the street and here
[39:01] come them Philistines marching up. He
[39:03] wasn't a warrior. He know nothing about
[39:05] fighting. But one thing he did know that
[39:07] he was a Jew and he had a right. He was
[39:10] circumcised and God was with him. So he
[39:12] grabbed this little old ox gold there.
[39:15] That's all he had. He sure give it to
[39:17] 600 Philistines and killed every one of
[39:19] them armored man. with this ox gold in
[39:21] his hand because he stepped out on what
[39:24] was right and believed God. What we need
[39:26] tonight, some more shanguards. Isn't
[39:28] that right?
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Somebody who will step out on the word
[39:31] of God and say that it's the truth. And
[39:32] don't be afraid. God will back up his
[39:35] word. He's under obligation to
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, and I think of the great heroes of
[39:40] the Bible. It just reminds me here. Some
[39:42] time ago, I was up in the mountains here
[39:44] and I was noticing the the the ducks
[39:47] when they all around on the water
[39:49] puddling around. But the very first time
[39:51] a cold wind blows down, those little old
[39:54] ducks get out there and honk two or
[39:56] three times and take off to Louisiana
[39:58] just as hard as they can go to the rice
[39:59] fields. What's the matter? They don't
[40:01] have to have any theology. He was
[40:03] absolutely born to duck. And when he's
[40:06] duck, he's got instinct. And he knows if
[40:08] he's a duck and instinct tells him to
[40:10] move out that there's cold weather's
[40:12] ahead, go to where it's warmer and
[40:14] better grounds. Well, if if a duck can
[40:16] do that by being a duck, what ought man
[40:18] to do by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[40:20] when he's born again of the spirit of
[40:22] God? He ought to be able to know that
[40:24] when trouble is ahead and he can step
[40:25] out on God and wave away with his wings
[40:28] of faith and move out from the thing.
[40:30] Move out from your sickness. Move out
[40:31] from your shackle down conditions and
[40:33] all those things you time for. God can
[40:35] move and do those things and grant the
[40:38] presence of the Lord Jesus to bless and
[40:40] to give power and great things for the
[40:43] church in any day. God has promised that
[40:45] he would do it. God said in the last
[40:48] days that his spirit would be poured out
[40:50] from on high and then show visions and
[40:52] signs and wonders in the earth and all
[40:54] these different things. God promised to
[40:55] do it. And if God promised to do it,
[40:57] he's obligated to take care of it. Don't
[40:59] you believe that?
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He certainly is. And then when
[41:03] this I've noticed again one time a
[41:05] little old night gale that I used to
[41:07] when I pastored the Baptist church. I
[41:08] used to come in at night time and that
[41:10] little fellow would sit there and he'd
[41:11] look all around at night time and when
[41:13] he could see a a star somewhere the
[41:15] clouds would blow back a little piece.
[41:17] He could see a star. He'd let out the
[41:19] singing just as loud as his little heart
[41:21] would let him sing. Why? He knowed that
[41:24] the sun was shining somewhere for he
[41:26] seen the evidence of it. A star was
[41:28] shining. proved the sun was shining
[41:30] somewhere that there was still a sun in
[41:32] existence. And I thank my brother
[41:34] tonight that we is the day when the Holy
[41:37] Ghost comes down like a rushing mighty
[41:39] wind. It blows the clouds of blackness
[41:40] back and we have an oldfashioned revival
[41:42] where the Holy Ghost is being poured out
[41:44] at all to make any Christian rise and
[41:46] shine. For I know God still lives and
[41:48] reigns and pours out his spirit upon the
[41:50] people. Yes indeed. and the days that
[41:53] we're living in. If I could walk out in
[41:55] the morning, look up to the big morning
[41:56] star and say, "Morning star, what makes
[41:58] you shine?" If he could speak back to
[42:00] me, he'd say, "Brother Brandham, it's
[42:01] not me shining. It's the sun shining on
[42:03] me." A doctor said to me not long ago, I
[42:06] was talking to him. He said, "Brother
[42:07] Brandon, what's the matter? Those people
[42:08] said they're just worked up. That's what
[42:10] makes him act like that, crying." And
[42:12] run to the altar said, "It's emotion." I
[42:14] said, "Doctor, you ought to know enough.
[42:16] It takes something to excite the nerves
[42:18] before that a person can be emotional."
[42:20] Certainly it is. It's something present.
[42:22] And it is true that when the Holy Ghost
[42:24] comes down, it stirs the crowd to
[42:26] emotion. They're sitting there anointed
[42:28] with the spirit of God and the Holy
[42:30] Ghost sweeps across them, it stirs
[42:32] emotion. It's got to. Jesus said, "If
[42:34] they hold their peace, the rocks will
[42:35] immediately cry out." And what could we
[42:38] do? My, when I think of that, it ain't
[42:40] the people. He said, "It ain't the
[42:41] people shining. It's the Holy Ghost
[42:43] shining on them that's doing these
[42:45] things. That's what's doing. It's not
[42:47] the people. It's the spirit of God on
[42:49] them that makes them believe. It's the
[42:50] spirit of God on them that gives them
[42:52] liberty. It's the spirit of God on them
[42:54] that makes them feel free. Not long ago,
[42:56] I was past I've in a hunting. I like to
[42:59] go to the mountains. It's an old spring
[43:00] that I like to drink from. And that
[43:02] spring constantly bubbles. It's a
[43:04] happiest spring I ever seen in my life.
[43:06] Bubble, bubble, bubble all the time. And
[43:08] I stopped by it one day and I said,
[43:10] "What makes you so happy? Is it because
[43:12] the deers drink from you? What makes you
[43:13] bubble?" And if he could have spoke this
[43:16] spring, he'd said, "No." I said, "Well,
[43:17] because bears drink from you?" He'd
[43:19] said, "No." Well, maybe because I drink
[43:21] from you. What makes you bubble? If he
[43:23] could have talked, he'd said, "Brother
[43:24] Brandom, it isn't me that's a bubbling.
[43:27] It's something behind me pushing me and
[43:29] making me bubble." That's the way that's
[43:30] ever man that's born of the spirit of
[43:32] God. This living water springing up in
[43:34] him. It's not him bubbling. It's the
[43:36] Holy Ghost behind him making him bubble
[43:37] and making him believe and leading him
[43:39] up into higher heights and deeper depths
[43:41] and experiences with the Lord Jesus
[43:43] Christ. That's what we need today as a
[43:45] gusher. Take off the cap and let the
[43:47] waters flow. It's what we need today.
[43:50] You notice every morning when the the
[43:52] dew I've watched it many times when I
[43:54] see the dew fall at night time. Look out
[43:57] there, see the dew fall, and every time
[43:59] when the sun comes up, did you ever
[44:01] notice how happy a little dew drop was,
[44:03] he just sparkles and shines and sparkles
[44:05] and shines. I was asking one one morning
[44:08] talking to nature, which is was my first
[44:10] Bible. I said, "What makes you sparkle,
[44:12] little dew drop?" And it seemed like
[44:14] it's something in a way spoke back to
[44:16] me. said, "You know, last night I was up
[44:18] there and I'm I know I'm going up again
[44:22] for I belong up there way beyond this
[44:25] old hot earth up there where the the
[44:27] moisture stays and I was one step there
[44:29] and I'm happy because the sun's just
[44:31] shining on me and when the sun shines on
[44:34] me, it's making it'll draw me right up
[44:36] to where I was." And I think that's
[44:38] right. The reason you can do that
[44:40] because of sparkle because you got an
[44:42] experience. You was up there once and I
[44:44] think about that that a man's ever been
[44:46] born again and tuck out of this life
[44:47] into another realm of blessings and
[44:50] glory. One of these days a son of
[44:51] righteousness will shine across the
[44:53] earth and those with that kind of an
[44:55] experience. They'll be caught up to meet
[44:56] him in the air up there where they have
[44:58] been in the realms of glory and lost
[45:00] themselves and all that's around them.
[45:02] They don't care who's around them.
[45:03] They've once been up and when they get
[45:04] into them kind of condition through
[45:06] anointing of the spirit that master
[45:08] spirit Jesus Christ will come someday to
[45:10] claim his church. Amen.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; I was reading not long ago, brother
[45:14] Moore was to me, my brother, I believe
[45:16] it was uh some great writer of days gone
[45:18] by said he had seen one of the most
[45:20] horrible sights he'd ever seen when he
[45:22] seen an eagle, a heaven bird in a cage
[45:26] and he had beat his head against the
[45:28] bars and he beat his wings against the
[45:30] bars until all the feathers had come off
[45:32] his wings. The feathers was off of his
[45:34] head and neck and he'd fluff himself
[45:37] trying to free himself till he come
[45:39] exhausted and fall down and his weary
[45:42] eyes look around look up to the skies
[45:45] where he really belongs. But a cage is
[45:47] held down. He can't get through those
[45:49] bars. His weary eyes looking. Yeah,
[45:52] that's true. That's an awful sight. But
[45:54] there's another more wearful sight than
[45:56] that. to see men and women born in the
[45:58] image of Almighty God that's supposed to
[46:01] be sons and daughters of God with
[46:03] shackles of denomination holding them in
[46:06] the holding them back from the blessings
[46:09] that Almighty God wants them to enter
[46:11] into to the power of his presence of
[46:13] deliverance and the power of his
[46:15] presence of the blessing of the Holy
[46:16] Spirit to fall like it did on the day of
[46:18] Pentecost to give them a blessing that
[46:21] they could say to the world such as I
[46:23] have give I thee that's what we need
[46:25] tonight is that type of a blessing that
[46:27] type of the Lord Jesus Christ. He's
[46:29] risen from the dead tonight. He's sure
[46:31] in our midst tonight. He's sure to do
[46:33] anything that we would ask of him
[46:35] rightly to the father. He promised he
[46:37] would do it. Whatever you ask in my
[46:39] name, that will I do. Second, Mr.
[46:42] Upshaw, when he was healed, as I told
[46:44] you, I give you his testimony for a
[46:45] second or two, few moments. I was in Los
[46:48] Angeles, California. I never heard of
[46:50] the man in my life. the deacons or
[46:53] ushers them had just got me up to the
[46:54] platform. Walking to the platform, I
[46:57] started to call the prayer line because
[46:59] Mr. Baxter had just preached a mighty
[47:02] sermon and and there was no need of me
[47:04] saying anything. So I walked to the
[47:06] platform and I started to call for the
[47:08] prayer line. And as I started to call
[47:10] for the prayer line, I seen a little boy
[47:12] playing on a haystack and he fell, broke
[47:14] his back. I seen a doctor with a white
[47:16] mustache and glasses low worked on his
[47:18] back. I seen him become a great man, an
[47:21] author of books and so forth. And I was
[47:23] just telling what I seen. I went ahead
[47:24] and called the prayer line, started to
[47:26] call it, and then I heard someone raise
[47:28] up there and say something. Mr. Baxter
[47:30] come to me in a few moments and said,
[47:32] the man that you was describing out
[47:34] there is sitting out there in that
[47:35] chair. That's Congressman Upshaw. And I
[47:37] said, well, I never know nothing of him.
[47:39] And um so he got to another microphone.
[47:42] He said, my son, well, I said, that's
[47:44] exactly the truth. How did you ever know
[47:46] those things? I said, I seen it by
[47:47] vision. And he said, 'The man that
[47:49] ordained you, Dr. Davis, and the Baptist
[47:51] church told me to come here and that's
[47:53] why I'm here. Said, I've been going to
[47:56] healing services since I was a little
[47:58] boy trying to get healed, but said, I've
[47:59] been crippled for 66 years and is 86
[48:03] years old then. And I said, well, sir, I
[48:06] wish I could do something for you. I can
[48:08] only say what I see. And then the
[48:10] meeting started on. When they started to
[48:12] bring someone to the platform, I seen a
[48:14] doctor standing in front of me with the
[48:16] TARDIS shell glasses, one of the little
[48:18] round collars and coats on, little
[48:20] medical coats, and he had his arms
[48:22] folded like this, shaking his head,
[48:24] standing right out in the midair. And he
[48:26] I looked below him and he had operated
[48:28] on a little color girl and had taken the
[48:30] tonsils out and had paralyzed her. Well,
[48:32] when I said that way down from me, a an
[48:36] old colored mother there let out a
[48:38] scream and here she come with the the
[48:40] cart in her hand saying, "Lord have
[48:42] mercy. That was my baby and that's
[48:44] exactly the kind of doctor operated on
[48:45] him." And the ushers just had to keep
[48:47] her off the platform because you have to
[48:49] have cards to line up. That's legitimate
[48:51] and the best way that we know how to do.
[48:53] And the old mother drug her baby down
[48:55] like that and she was just pushing users
[48:57] every way and she wanted to get to the
[48:59] platform. I said looked at the baby. I
[49:01] said, "Yes, auntie, that's the little
[49:02] girl." And I I said, "Well, he's a young
[49:04] fellow had black slick hair." She said,
[49:06] "Yes, that's right." I said, "Well, I
[49:08] said, "Will my baby ever get well?" I
[49:10] said, "Auntie, I don't know. I just
[49:12] can't tell you. Only thing I can do is
[49:14] just say what I see. That's all." That's
[49:16] why our Lord Jesus said, he said, "I can
[49:18] do nothing till the father shows me." I
[49:20] said, "Surely you'd have faith to
[49:21] believe the baby's going to get well or
[49:23] this other gentleman here was going to
[49:25] get well if God could move out there and
[49:27] speak his who he about him in the
[49:29] audience. I said, "Well, to one of my
[49:32] the ushers, I said,"Bring the prayer
[49:34] line and they start bringing a lady and
[49:36] it called me this way again." And I
[49:38] looked, it looked like a black streak
[49:39] moving right over the audience. Well, I
[49:41] thought maybe it was something evil, but
[49:43] it turned out when it materialized, it
[49:45] was a street or a road. And this little
[49:47] color girl was going down this road with
[49:50] a doll on her arm, rocking it like that.
[49:52] Brother, that's it.
[49:54] Satan couldn't send enough devils out of
[49:56] hell to stop it. God's already said so.
[49:59] That's exactly right. And about that
[50:01] time, I said, "Auntie, your prayers has
[50:03] been heard and Jesus Christ has healed
[50:06] your baby. Stand up on its feet." And
[50:09] she said, "Will my baby get well?" I
[50:10] said, "It's well now." And while she had
[50:12] was talking to me, the baby raised up
[50:14] and said, "Mother, do threw its arms out
[50:15] like that, had been paralyzed from the
[50:17] shoulders down for two years." And there
[50:18] and that mother and daughter with her
[50:20] arms around one another, screaming and
[50:22] crying and people fainting and
[50:24] everything else standing around. I look
[50:26] going across the audience, right across
[50:27] the top of the people's head, and here
[50:28] went the old congressman with a brown
[50:30] pinstriped suit on, bowing his head to
[50:32] everybody right across the audience.
[50:35] Well, then I said, "Congressman,
[50:38] have you got a brown pinstriped suit?"
[50:41] He had then a black suit on or blue suit
[50:44] with a red tie. He said, "Yes, sir, I
[50:47] have. I just got it a few days ago." I
[50:50] said, "The Lord Jesus Christ has made
[50:52] you well. You can stand up and heal for
[50:56] it. Thus saith the Lord God. He has had
[50:59] respect unto you and you are healed
[51:01] after being a England for 66 years
[51:04] rolled in beds and wheelchairs. And that
[51:06] old congressman jumped to his feet, ran
[51:09] to the platform without crutches,
[51:11] without anything, touched his toes like
[51:13] this. He could almost do a handspring
[51:15] and was perfectly normal and well. It's
[51:18] the power of the Lord Jesus Christ
[51:20] tonight that's raised from the dead to
[51:23] do the same here in this building
[51:24] tonight that he did then and has across
[51:26] the world back over into the other
[51:28] countries. You'd guess you'd imagine how
[51:30] would we get along without and there's
[51:33] people here. There's for instance the
[51:34] brother here from Sweden. There's those
[51:37] here from different places from up in
[51:38] the Finland and perhaps Africa where I
[51:42] don't even know one word of their
[51:43] language or nothing. But the Holy Spirit
[51:45] will point to a certain person and and
[51:49] speak to them and tell them where it has
[51:51] to come through an interpret
[51:52] interpretation that they'll understand
[51:54] the things that they do in the sin of
[51:55] their life. Not one time does it ever
[51:58] fail because it's the Lord Jesus Christ
[52:01] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; I love him. I'm sorry to keep it this
[52:06] long. A few moments now, we'll call the
[52:08] prayer line and go to praying for the
[52:09] sick. God be with you, my dear friends.
[52:11] Many of you at your post of duty at your
[52:13] churches tomorrow, greet your pastors
[52:15] for me. I am not I'm perfectly
[52:18] interdenominational. I believe in all
[52:20] Christians are brothers and sisters and
[52:22] we should worship together. It's too bad
[52:24] that the barriers break us down. and so
[52:26] forth. And I have never at one time in
[52:28] my life ever knowingly to be guilty of
[52:31] prolighting or telling a person what
[52:32] church they should belong to. I believe
[52:34] that a man's got a liberty to make up
[52:36] his mind on what church that he desires
[52:38] to go to.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; And I pray that God will bless you. Uh
[52:42] maybe you're you don't need a new
[52:43] church. You might need a good
[52:44] oldfashioned revival in your church. You
[52:46] might need that. I think we all need
[52:48] that. And to you pastors here, God bless
[52:50] you. You might disagree with me on Jesus
[52:53] Christ's resurrection from the dead,
[52:55] proving that he is the same yesterday,
[52:56] today and forever. If you do, you're my
[52:58] brother just the same. I pray that God
[53:00] will bless you, forgive you for that,
[53:02] and that the great day comes that we'll
[53:04] sit down at the kingdom in Jesus' feet
[53:07] and there see the many thousands that we
[53:09] preach to all saved and safe at that
[53:11] side. God be with you now while we pray.
[53:15] Father, we thank thee for thy word. Thy
[53:17] word is life. You said, "Faith cometh by
[53:20] hearing, hearing of the word of God."
[53:22] And I pray that you will bless this
[53:24] audience tonight. Keep them ever before
[53:28] thee, Lord, and write their names upon
[53:30] the palms of thy hand. Put them upon the
[53:33] the heart of the Lord Jesus. And may
[53:36] each one remain a Christian till death
[53:39] shall set him free to the other side.
[53:42] The backslider tonight, may he feel
[53:44] shame and come home to the heavenly
[53:45] father. the sinner. May he repent and
[53:48] come home. And we pray that you'll heal
[53:50] all the sick and afflicted. Get glory
[53:52] out of the service. For we commit
[53:54] ourselves to you now for the healing of
[53:56] the sick in the name of Jesus Christ,
[53:58] thy son. Amen.
[54:01] Now for the services. Uh find out what
[54:06] what cards you give out today
[54:08] and we will. All right.
[54:17] We could stand here and speak for hours.
[54:21] Coming back after coming from overseas,
[54:23] I'm going to change the position of
[54:25] having prayer lines and so forth. And
[54:27] now, but at this time, tomorrow night
[54:30] will be the closing services of this for
[54:32] Chicago. At this time, we go to West
[54:35] Coast then and then from there back to
[54:37] New York City and then overseas. I love
[54:40] you very much and I know you love me
[54:43] from the way you act and the way you do.
[54:46] It's mutually felt. And now
[54:50] the only way that we can pray for the
[54:53] sick, the only way that I know how is
[54:56] here so that you'll be sure to
[54:58] understand it. I claim that Jesus Christ
[55:03] is the son of God and they crucified him
[55:06] and buried him. And on the third day,
[55:10] God raised him up. And for 40 days and
[55:13] nights, he was with his disciples here
[55:16] on earth. And he went up at the 40th
[55:18] day, and told his disciples that he was
[55:21] going away, and the world wouldn't seem
[55:23] no more. But yet they would see him, and
[55:27] he'd be with them, his disciples,
[55:29] through every generation to the end of
[55:31] the world. Lo, I am with you always,
[55:33] even to the end of the world. Do you
[55:35] believe that?
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe on the day of Pentecost,
[55:40] the comforter, which is the Holy Spirit,
[55:42] was given, which is the spirit of Jesus
[55:44] Christ, given to the church. And Jesus
[55:47] lives in his church, his people.
[55:49] Tonight, just as he lived with him in a
[55:52] body of flesh, the flesh had to die in
[55:54] order to make a sacrifice to redeem us
[55:57] back to God, to pay the penalty of death
[56:00] that we committed. And now I believe
[56:03] that he will come physically in a body
[56:05] form someday. The same Jesus went away.
[56:09] The spirit will be taken from the church
[56:11] back to the body of Christ and he will
[56:13] return again in physical form just as he
[56:16] went away. The same Jesus eating and
[56:18] drinking with and talking with his
[56:21] disciples. I believe that he will come
[56:23] and believe that's the only answer to
[56:25] the world's problems today. Is that's
[56:27] right. And then I believe that Jesus
[56:29] said this. He said, "The things that I
[56:32] do, you shall do also
[56:35] to the end of the world. I believe that
[56:38] these things was to accompany the
[56:39] resurrection of Jesus Christ." Then if
[56:42] the scripture teaches he is the same
[56:43] yesterday, today, and forever, we find
[56:45] out what he did that day. He's duty
[56:49] bound to his word, to my humble opinion
[56:52] to keep his word before his people. If I
[56:55] promise you to be here and deliberately,
[56:58] now God don't make a promise unless he
[57:00] can back it up. I can make a promise and
[57:02] I may have to back up, but God doesn't
[57:04] have to do that. And if he promised that
[57:06] he was the same yesterday, today, and
[57:07] forever, the things that he did, the
[57:09] church would do always, even to the end
[57:11] of the world, he's duty bound to his
[57:14] word to do that thing that he promised.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Now, the only thing will keep it from
[57:18] happening is our unbelief. That's right.
[57:20] That's all. It's the only thing. our
[57:22] disloving him. Oh, we say we have faith,
[57:26] we have love. But if we had love, we'd
[57:28] have faith. For that isa perfect love
[57:32] castes out all fear. And when fear is
[57:34] gone, faith is perfect. You're scared he
[57:37] won't keep his word. But I believe that
[57:39] he does. And now we'll find what he did.
[57:42] When he was here, he didn't say, "Bring
[57:43] me this one. Let me heal it." Very much
[57:46] contrary. I believe he could raise the
[57:48] dead. Do you believe that?
[57:50] But he didn't raise all the dead. He
[57:52] only raised three dead people as the
[57:54] scripture quotes in all of his ministry.
[57:56] Three is a confirmation. Perhaps people
[57:58] come said, "Now look at here. Look at
[58:00] that fella. Well, if he raised Lazarus,
[58:02] let him come down here and raise my
[58:03] uncle. We'll see whether he can or not."
[58:05] Sure, those same critical things went
[58:07] on. The Jews hating him the way they
[58:08] did. They said that look when he passed
[58:11] through the pool of Bethesda where all
[58:12] those crippled, lame and blind people
[58:14] was. He wandered his way right through
[58:16] those thousands of people of
[58:18] lame halt blind little babies with
[58:19] waterheads and so forth until he got to
[58:22] a man laying on a pallet and he made
[58:24] that man well and walked away and left
[58:26] the rest of them laying there and the
[58:28] Jews and question him in the same
[58:29] chapter he said verily verily I say unto
[58:31] you the son can do nothing of himself
[58:33] but what he sees the father doing that
[58:35] doeth the son likewise
[58:37] &gt;&gt; now if he's raised from the dead he's
[58:38] the same Jesus today isn't he
[58:40] &gt;&gt; when he met the woman at the well he
[58:42] know he he talked to her long enough to
[58:43] find out what was wrong with her. When
[58:45] he talked to people, he perceived their
[58:46] thoughts. Their faith touched him. The
[58:48] people in the audience tonight could
[58:50] touch him with faith till it would make
[58:51] him turn if he stand on this platform
[58:53] and say, "Your sins are forgiven or your
[58:56] cancer is healed or whatever was wrong
[58:58] with you and tell you about it." Do you
[59:00] believe that?
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Well, then he he has no hands but ours
[59:03] now. He's here in spirit form. No eyes
[59:06] but ours, no ears but ours, no tongue
[59:09] but ours. So, let's let him have
[59:11] everything. The secret of this is
[59:14] submitting yourself with godly love into
[59:16] the hands of a loving father and letting
[59:18] him take you over. That's all. Shall we
[59:21] pray for these handkerchiefs? Lord, in
[59:23] whose name we trust the Jesus Christ,
[59:25] the son of God, may your spirit come
[59:27] upon all these these handkerchiefs
[59:30] represent. And may each and every one of
[59:32] them be made he healed and well by the
[59:36] power of the resurrection of the Lord
[59:38] Jesus Christ. We send them for that
[59:40] purpose. Lord God, watch over them and
[59:44] perform this for your glory and the
[59:46] mercy of those poor, sick, suffering
[59:49] people. Some of them perhaps the doctors
[59:51] give up. The only hope they have is this
[59:54] handkerchief to reach them as a token of
[59:56] the Christian church praying. I ask
[59:58] father that it be done. Amen.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother.
[1:00:05] What was a use? How many?
[1:00:09] 100. Well, let's see how many we can
[1:00:12] stand in here tonight. Let's start from
[1:00:15] number one. You number one. Number one,
[1:00:18] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 on up to 15 20. I
[1:00:24] don't care how many stands, but you just
[1:00:25] can't stand too many at once. Just start
[1:00:27] off with 1 2 3 4 5 and get up to 15.
[1:00:31] We'll see how many you got left standing
[1:00:33] there. Then, now while they are coming,
[1:00:36] let me ask the church something just for
[1:00:37] a few moments.
[1:00:39] Look at the people, more people's healed
[1:00:41] out there in the audience than there is
[1:00:42] up here. Isn't that right? And you
[1:00:45] remember this that after I'm gone a long
[1:00:48] time from here, you'll find people
[1:00:49] that's been in this meeting will be
[1:00:51] normal and well. Last evening, something
[1:00:53] happened that I have never seen for
[1:00:55] quite a while. And that was an evil
[1:00:57] spirit leave a person. See it physically
[1:01:00] leaving. And it did. I watched it last
[1:01:02] night. Christian friends, I am not a
[1:01:04] fanatic. I do not believe in fanaticism.
[1:01:07] I'm more against it than you are because
[1:01:10] it's my duty to be against it. It's my
[1:01:12] duty to thin it out and to try to keep
[1:01:14] the church straightened out. I do not
[1:01:16] believe in fanaticism, but I do know the
[1:01:18] power of the resurrection of Jesus
[1:01:19] Christ and I know there is devils. Now,
[1:01:23] here's here is the power. Uh
[1:01:27] let me while they're lining up the
[1:01:29] peoples, let me ask this. How many here
[1:01:33] believes that the most essential thing
[1:01:36] in the kingdom of God is love?
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:42] Now, I'm going to give you a little
[1:01:45] secret. If you love people, people will
[1:01:47] know it. Did you know that man is a
[1:01:50] creator in himself? How many believe
[1:01:53] that he's a son of God in his fallen
[1:01:55] condition? Today, while we were out
[1:01:57] looking at the skyline of Chicago, you
[1:01:59] can see that man's more than an animal.
[1:02:01] You never seen an animal building uh
[1:02:03] cities like this, making beautiful boat
[1:02:05] harbors and so forth. He's a creator.
[1:02:08] Was you ever around someone that you
[1:02:10] just love to be around? Did you? You've
[1:02:12] had those people. What is it? It's
[1:02:14] because of their atmosphere that they
[1:02:17] create around them. You've been in nice
[1:02:19] people, but yet you couldn't stand to be
[1:02:21] around them. It's their atmosphere.
[1:02:24] It's love. Love goes out deep. It does
[1:02:27] great things. And Jesus Christ is the
[1:02:31] love of God. I used to think that God
[1:02:33] was angry with me, but Christ loved me.
[1:02:36] And I come to find out that Christ is
[1:02:38] the very heart of God. He is God's
[1:02:41] heart. Jesus Christ is God's heart. Now,
[1:02:45] love overcomes.
[1:02:47] Love hides sin or gets rid of sin. God
[1:02:52] so loved the world, he gave his only
[1:02:54] begotten son. Whosoever believeth in him
[1:02:57] shall not perish but have everlasting
[1:02:58] life. Now love hides sin or love heals
[1:03:04] the sick. Now you can act like you love
[1:03:08] people. You say, "Well, I I Miss Jones,
[1:03:10] I I don't get along with her good, but I
[1:03:11] love her. Miss Jones knows better than
[1:03:13] that." Sure, she does. You just don't do
[1:03:17] it. No matter how much you try to act
[1:03:19] like you do, you don't. And that's the
[1:03:22] way it is with with divine healing, with
[1:03:24] anything else. You can't impersonate it.
[1:03:27] You've got to have it. You've got to
[1:03:31] How many loves me with all your heart?
[1:03:32] I'm going to tell you a little story.
[1:03:34] All right. I hope your confidence is
[1:03:36] real deep. Now, this may sound kind of
[1:03:39] strange to you.
[1:03:41] Many of you has been down at my house as
[1:03:43] I see brother Wood sitting here laughing
[1:03:45] at me because I know he knows the
[1:03:47] experience.
[1:03:49] All people come and go and you know how
[1:03:51] it is. And last summer I couldn't even
[1:03:53] get my yard mowed in the front. And I
[1:03:56] about time I got around to the back. The
[1:03:58] front had grown up again and I'd start
[1:04:00] mowing a little while and people come in
[1:04:02] have to go out and pray for them and
[1:04:03] come back and mow a couple rounds and I
[1:04:05] got quite a front yard. So I wife would
[1:04:08] say, "You're not going to have on those
[1:04:10] overhauls and go out there and pray for
[1:04:11] those sick people. Get in here and
[1:04:12] change your clothes." So I would go down
[1:04:15] the yard praising the Lord and come back
[1:04:17] again with the old Mo just in rhythm,
[1:04:19] you know, and I'd come back car drive
[1:04:22] in. Well, maybe I'd be a couple hours
[1:04:24] with them and then somebody else would
[1:04:26] get in that probably ruined the day and
[1:04:28] the next day the grass is coming real
[1:04:29] high again.
[1:04:30] So, I'd got around in the backyard to
[1:04:33] mowing. And when I got back there, I
[1:04:35] took off my my shirt for I was in the
[1:04:39] backyard where no one would see me. And
[1:04:40] I was mowing as as hot as it could be.
[1:04:43] And I mowed up against a a little fence
[1:04:46] there. And I got a little martin box
[1:04:47] that I built out there so the children
[1:04:49] could watch the martins go in. But it
[1:04:52] happened to be that a bunch of hornets
[1:04:53] inhabited. And when I hit that bunch of
[1:04:57] hornets, roused them out. I was covered
[1:05:00] over with great big harness just flying
[1:05:01] all around me. Now this may seem
[1:05:04] strange. Do you read the story over
[1:05:06] there the in my book there called when
[1:05:08] the maniac run out there Portland organ
[1:05:10] was go to slay me? You remember the book
[1:05:12] and I didn't have dislike for that man.
[1:05:16] I had pity and love for that poor fella.
[1:05:18] He was in that shape. I felt sorry for
[1:05:21] him. He he perhaps if that spirit was
[1:05:24] off of him, he he'd love me. You've got
[1:05:27] to love even your enemy. And when this
[1:05:30] this just a little thing while they're
[1:05:32] making ready,
[1:05:35] these bees cover me all over. And
[1:05:38] instead of being scared, now I had love
[1:05:41] for those hornets. Now that sounds
[1:05:44] foolish, but it's true. Something
[1:05:46] happened. And I thought, poor little
[1:05:48] fellas probably taking a nap in there. I
[1:05:50] went and disturbed them and I hit that
[1:05:53] like that and they were really meaning
[1:05:55] business. They were all around me and I
[1:05:58] stopped my moy machine. I said, "I am
[1:06:00] sorry, my little friends that I
[1:06:03] disturbed you and I'm sorry I am God's
[1:06:06] servant and no wonder you're angry with
[1:06:08] me because I disturbed you. But I am
[1:06:11] God's servant and I am praying and
[1:06:13] ministering to his people. So I haven't
[1:06:15] got time to play with you at this time.
[1:06:17] So you rush right back in the name in
[1:06:19] the name of the Lord Jesus and go into
[1:06:20] your box and my Bible laying here and as
[1:06:23] a Christian minister and God knows my
[1:06:27] heart. Those beasts swarmed right around
[1:06:29] me about two more circles and lined up
[1:06:31] one by one and went right back into the
[1:06:33] box.
[1:06:36] And that is true. One day out on a big
[1:06:40] farm the just how you got How many you
[1:06:43] got lined up now? You want some more?
[1:06:46] You need some more. All right. Bring me
[1:06:47] up the last four. Leave all 15. All
[1:06:50] right. Give me up to 20 then. Let them
[1:06:51] be lime up if you wish to. Uh up to 20.
[1:06:55] All right. Notice a big male cow run
[1:07:00] through the field one day to take my
[1:07:02] life. And I there was no way for me to
[1:07:03] get away from him. And instead of me
[1:07:06] getting scared,
[1:07:08] I
[1:07:10] felt sorry for the animal. And he run
[1:07:13] within a few feet of me. had just killed
[1:07:15] a colored man down to the Burks farm
[1:07:17] about two months before that. And I
[1:07:19] said, "Uh,
[1:07:22] your creator is my loving savior
[1:07:27] and I am not bothering you. I'm on a
[1:07:30] mission to go across this field.
[1:07:33] And now in the name of our creator, the
[1:07:35] Lord Jesus, you go over there and lay
[1:07:38] down under that tree." And that fellow
[1:07:40] run within about 5t of me and stopped
[1:07:44] and he looked so depleted. He looked
[1:07:46] right and left, turned right around,
[1:07:48] walked over and laid down under the
[1:07:49] tree. That's right. I felt sorry for
[1:07:52] him. I loved him. That's exactly right.
[1:07:55] Now that sounds crazy, but let me tell
[1:07:57] you friends, when St. Paul the Apostle,
[1:08:01] when the serpent grabbed him through the
[1:08:03] hand, now if he'd said, "Oh my, get rid
[1:08:05] of the iodine quick or some serum." It
[1:08:08] might have hurt him, but he was so
[1:08:10] charged with the Holy Ghost till he just
[1:08:12] looked at it, not one bit scared, just
[1:08:15] shook the thing off in the fire and went
[1:08:17] on. That's right.
[1:08:21] People get scared.
[1:08:23] The cancer when he grabs you, you get,
[1:08:25] "Oh, the doctor said I'm going to die."
[1:08:27] That's what makes you die. Say, "Get out
[1:08:30] of here. I'm a servant of the Lord
[1:08:33] Jesus. You have no right of holding me."
[1:08:36] and mean it from your heart.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Watch what happens. You've got You can't
[1:08:41] impersonate it.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; You've got to have it.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; As a hunter in the woods, how many time
[1:08:46] have I walked face to face with vicious
[1:08:48] animals? Just stand and look at them
[1:08:50] just for a few minutes. You turn around,
[1:08:52] walk off the side of the road. That's
[1:08:54] right. You You if you're scared, don't
[1:08:57] you try. But if you're not scared, go
[1:08:59] ahead. If you're scared, don't you try
[1:09:02] to trust the Lord tonight. You better
[1:09:03] get back down, ask the doctor what he
[1:09:05] can do for you. But if you're not scared
[1:09:06] and you love him, just accept him
[1:09:09] tonight and find out what takes place.
[1:09:11] He'll do it. All right,
[1:09:15] everyone. Rever now as the organ plays
[1:09:20] for just a word of prayer again. Father,
[1:09:22] in the name of thy son Jesus. I don't
[1:09:24] know why I'm so excited, Bill tonight,
[1:09:28] meeting those people just for coming to
[1:09:30] the platform. But Lord, in grace, I
[1:09:33] asked you that you'll help me just now
[1:09:36] and anoint me for this service, Father.
[1:09:38] For there's hundreds of people here
[1:09:40] waiting. And maybe tonight might be the
[1:09:42] turning point and a great blessing will
[1:09:45] follow. I ask this for God's glory in
[1:09:48] the name of his son, the Lord Jesus
[1:09:50] Christ. Amen.
[1:09:55] Or maybe if I can talk to the woman just
[1:09:57] a little bit.
[1:10:00] Usually the Holy Spirit's already near
[1:10:03] when I start praying, but I would just
[1:10:06] been a bit disturbed meeting friends and
[1:10:07] things before comes the platform. So I
[1:10:09] will just talk to you a minute to see
[1:10:11] what he We are strangers to each other,
[1:10:14] I suppose, you and I. And the Lord Jesus
[1:10:17] knows both of us though, doesn't he? and
[1:10:19] he knows us both and I trust that he
[1:10:23] will do something for us. To the
[1:10:24] audience, does anyone out there know the
[1:10:26] woman? You know, anybody in this
[1:10:29] audience knows her? Yes. All right. Now,
[1:10:33] I do not know her. God knows this. The
[1:10:35] first time I ever seen her in my life.
[1:10:37] But if Jesus Christ has risen from the
[1:10:39] dead, now let's just take the gospel,
[1:10:41] base it right here on the Bible. Now,
[1:10:44] what would he do to this woman as she's
[1:10:46] sick? Well, he would tell her he healed
[1:10:49] her at Calvary when he died for her. But
[1:10:52] now he would know just what was wrong
[1:10:55] with her. He'd probably talk to her a
[1:10:56] few minutes like he did the woman at the
[1:10:57] well. He'd find out what was wrong. He'd
[1:11:00] tell her what was wrong with her or
[1:11:02] maybe what she wanted or something like
[1:11:04] that. That would be Jesus today. That
[1:11:06] was Jesus yesterday. Is that right?
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; That's the way the Bible speaks of him.
[1:11:10] That would be Jesus today. Now, we are
[1:11:12] his servants. Now, if we can submit
[1:11:14] ourselves so perfect that we won't have
[1:11:17] any thought of our own, the Holy Spirit
[1:11:20] using us, perhaps he'd do the same
[1:11:22] thing. If he does, all right, I cannot
[1:11:25] make him anymore. But if he comes to
[1:11:27] anoint, well, he will do it. I'm sure of
[1:11:30] that.
[1:11:31] Now, uh this is a beautiful city, isn't
[1:11:35] it? Wonderful, great city, but it
[1:11:37] certainly needs an oldfashioned revival.
[1:11:40] Ever every city needs that. That's
[1:11:43] right. Every city needs that. Now, the
[1:11:46] Holy Spirit's here. And you're aware
[1:11:49] that something happened just then.
[1:11:54] You are here to see me about a condition
[1:11:59] of your body and that is pending an
[1:12:02] operation. It's a tumor that's in your
[1:12:06] body and that it's um it's in the
[1:12:10] stomach. Your trouble's in your stomach
[1:12:12] and it's a tumor that's pushing. That's
[1:12:14] what it is. That is truth.
[1:12:18] And now do you believe me as I have told
[1:12:22] the truth about the Bible? I talk to you
[1:12:24] just a little while longer and see what
[1:12:25] he would say for the sake of the
[1:12:27] audience. You see, just a little while
[1:12:29] longer. And uh do now you know that I
[1:12:34] know nothing of you but he knowed what
[1:12:36] was wrong with you. Then this that you
[1:12:38] feel now is his presence. Isn't that
[1:12:40] right?
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; And now uh you are Yes. There something
[1:12:44] I see you have left a loved one or
[1:12:46] something. It's a it's your husband and
[1:12:49] he's uh something wrong. He's it's a
[1:12:51] stroke. The h the husband has a stroke.
[1:12:54] Is that right? That's is right. Yes.
[1:12:56] Yeah. Would you like to go home and lay
[1:12:59] hands on him and see him come out of it
[1:13:01] and be well? Come here.
[1:13:04] Dear God and Father, may thy spirit rest
[1:13:07] upon the woman. May she be made well and
[1:13:11] the desires of her heart given her
[1:13:14] through Jesus thy son. I ask this
[1:13:16] blessing. Amen.
[1:13:18] I want to talk to you again just a
[1:13:20] moment, lady.
[1:13:22] Now, the the things become a dream to me
[1:13:24] afterwards.
[1:13:26] I I want to ask you this.
[1:13:30] You know, beyond any shadow of doubt,
[1:13:32] whatever it was, I don't remember now,
[1:13:34] but whatever it was, it was the truth.
[1:13:36] Was that right? Absolutely. The truth.
[1:13:39] And at that same time, something was
[1:13:41] anointing upon you when I had the
[1:13:43] contact of your spirit that something
[1:13:45] was is that right? Well, then now if you
[1:13:48] believe that that was the Lord Jesus
[1:13:50] Christ and his servant being anointed,
[1:13:52] then with my hands laid upon you while
[1:13:54] that anointing is on me, you have to
[1:13:56] receive what you asked for. Is that
[1:13:58] right? If you can believe it. Is that
[1:13:59] right?
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; You do believe it. Then you shall have
[1:14:02] what you've asked for. God bless you.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; May the Lord Jesus be blessed.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:14:11] have faith in God and and just don't
[1:14:13] doubt. Just believe with all your heart
[1:14:15] and all your mind. Anyone out there in
[1:14:17] the audience, how many hasn't a prayer
[1:14:19] card out there? Raise up your hand so I
[1:14:20] can get a general idea of where you are
[1:14:22] and you want to be healed. God bless you
[1:14:27] that just have faith and you shall have
[1:14:29] what you've asked for. All right, let
[1:14:32] the man come.
[1:14:36] Good evening, sir.
[1:14:39] You love the Lord Jesus. He is
[1:14:41] marvelous, isn't he? He's the son of the
[1:14:43] living God and he's our redeemer and our
[1:14:46] healer. Now, when he was here on earth,
[1:14:49] he would if he was here wearing my
[1:14:51] clothes that he gave me, uh he would
[1:14:54] talk to you a little while. He'd know
[1:14:56] your trouble and and he would uh and now
[1:14:59] some people might think I was reading
[1:15:01] the person's mind. That is absolutely
[1:15:04] error. Sir, you keep come up here and
[1:15:06] just lay your hands on my shoulder and
[1:15:08] just as a point of contact to contact
[1:15:10] you as Jesus said they lay hands on the
[1:15:12] Satan. Now if the Lord Jesus shows me a
[1:15:15] vision out here and he tells me and as
[1:15:18] the vision is speaking if it takes place
[1:15:21] you nod your head if it's right or not
[1:15:23] if he should give me the vision. And now
[1:15:26] I felt that coming from back there that
[1:15:28] you thought I was reading the man's
[1:15:30] mind. I am not. No sir, I am not.
[1:15:35] But what if I told you Jesus Christ was
[1:15:37] a mind reader? Would you believe it?
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; He sure was. He perceived their
[1:15:42] thoughts. Is that right? Now, if you'll
[1:15:44] tell me the difference between
[1:15:44] perceiving thoughts or reading the mind,
[1:15:46] not like these psychic readers out here,
[1:15:48] the devil. That's the devil. The devil
[1:15:50] just patterned that off of Jesus Christ.
[1:15:53] This man with his hand on my shoulder as
[1:15:56] I see something moving before me now
[1:15:58] turning white. I see a young man
[1:16:01] standing here,
[1:16:04] a real young man. And the man is doing
[1:16:06] something wrong. It's evil
[1:16:10] and he is repaid for it.
[1:16:13] The man has contacted a social disease
[1:16:17] that has has ruined his life
[1:16:22] and the man is becoming older. It's
[1:16:25] affecting him. He has a wife.
[1:16:29] The man has become in a serious
[1:16:31] condition. He's mentally disturbed at
[1:16:34] this time. He thinks that he has uh
[1:16:37] crossed over the separating line where
[1:16:40] there is no pardon for his sins.
[1:16:48] Those things are true, sir.
[1:16:50] If it is, raise your hand up to the
[1:16:52] audience that they'll see that that is
[1:16:53] true.
[1:16:59] Do you know now that whatever it was,
[1:17:02] God knows your life, knows what you've
[1:17:04] been through your life, and knows what
[1:17:05] you will be. Is that right, sir?
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; You believe that he will now take away
[1:17:10] you're standing in his presence probably
[1:17:12] closer than you ever was in your life?
[1:17:14] Do you believe now that if I would ask
[1:17:16] along with the rest of this audience,
[1:17:18] lay hands up on you that Jesus Christ
[1:17:20] will give you the desire of your heart?
[1:17:23] kind heavenly father as the human mortal
[1:17:26] lips move and say yes I believe it comes
[1:17:29] from the depths of his soul and I ask
[1:17:32] now that the evil sickness will go from
[1:17:35] his body and he'll be made completely
[1:17:37] whole in the name of Jesus Christ the
[1:17:40] son of God amend
[1:17:43] bless you my brother go and God's peace
[1:17:45] be with you bless you upon
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; God bless you thank you sir I trust that
[1:17:50] he'll do the same for you too God bless
[1:17:53] Just a minute, sir.
[1:18:06] An evil spirit went from the man and I
[1:18:08] seen it rise somewhere else. Just kind
[1:18:11] heavenly father who knows all things.
[1:18:14] May he oh God
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; it's um
[1:18:23] it's the your faith has saved you lady
[1:18:27] that's you sitting right there w rubbing
[1:18:29] your eyes with tears you have been
[1:18:32] nervously broken down and you have been
[1:18:35] told a lie by Satan Satan has told you
[1:18:38] that you have committed the unpardonable
[1:18:40] sin and you cannot be forgiven your sins
[1:18:44] are forgiven you, sister. Jesus Christ
[1:18:46] makes you whole. Stand up on your feet
[1:18:48] and accept that now as God's blessings.
[1:18:50] Raise up your hands and stand up and
[1:18:52] give him praise. Was there something
[1:18:53] like that wrong with this man
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; there? Satan thought he would get by
[1:18:56] with that, but he couldn't do it. You're
[1:18:58] both delivered. God bless you. Go on
[1:19:00] your own rejoicing. There's the angel of
[1:19:02] the Lord standing around them both.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; God be praised and blessed.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:13] Hallelujah.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; You're holding her mother.
[1:19:19] You yourself that's so rejoicing over
[1:19:21] your friend being healed. You love her.
[1:19:24] You love the Lord Jesus. You believe me
[1:19:27] to be his prophet. You got your arms
[1:19:29] around her. You've had arthritis,
[1:19:31] haven't you? You haven't got it no more.
[1:19:34] Your faith has healed you. You can go on
[1:19:36] your road rejoicing. God bless you. You
[1:19:38] are made well.
[1:19:41] Have faith in God. Don't doubt. Believe
[1:19:44] with all your heart. The angel of the
[1:19:46] Lord remains standing there.
[1:19:50] It's over a little lady sitting right in
[1:19:51] behind you there.
[1:19:53] Been suffering from a sunstroke. Got too
[1:19:56] hot out there and fell and you've been
[1:19:59] having ill effects. Jesus Christ has
[1:20:01] healed you. Your faith has touched him.
[1:20:03] Sister, the same Lord Jesus has said to
[1:20:05] the woman, "The blood issue had stopped.
[1:20:07] The sun stroke has left you now and
[1:20:09] you're going home to be well. God bless
[1:20:11] you. Stand up and give him a praise for
[1:20:13] it. For his glory. God bless you.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, how could you doubt the resurrecting
[1:20:25] power of our Lord Jesus Christ?
[1:20:29] To do it would be sin.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Someone believe. I challenge your faith
[1:20:36] in the name of the Lord Jesus to believe
[1:20:38] that the testimony that I give
[1:20:40] concerning the angel of the Lord that
[1:20:42] when I was a baby he that pillar of fire
[1:20:44] hung over the crib the very minute I was
[1:20:47] born. The first thing I can remember is
[1:20:49] a vision 10 years ago. He stood by me as
[1:20:52] a man dressed in white with hair down
[1:20:55] his long white robe and told me I was to

[1:53:41] Andy,
[1:53:47] [Music]
[1:53:56] Glory to God.
[1:54:00] [Music]
[1:54:05] I just would like to say something
[1:54:07] because the Lord had put it in my heart
[1:54:10] and
[1:54:11] I said I said while I was sitting there
[1:54:14] they they gave me the opportunity I
[1:54:16] would like to say that um I was thinking
[1:54:19] at work
[1:54:22] um but when I was talking about the
[1:54:24] Philistines and uh we know according to
[1:54:27] the Bible Philistines means as you see
[1:54:30] they come against a believer that's a
[1:54:32] devil that come against you in certain
[1:54:35] ways different ways
[1:54:38] there's a devil attacking you your faith
[1:54:42] we see the Philistine that was in Israel
[1:54:46] it was because of their unbelief they
[1:54:49] didn't have the courage to stand against
[1:54:51] the devil as the church of the living
[1:54:53] God so I was thinking um sometimes our
[1:54:58] ways and sometimes we see that we don't
[1:55:00] have victories in our lives. It's
[1:55:02] because of those Philistines that we let
[1:55:05] take our territory
[1:55:08] that we uh we can be pride. I remember
[1:55:12] um at work there was this guy was
[1:55:15] begging and I and I knew him before from
[1:55:19] uh from work he would he would just um I
[1:55:24] know him but I ignored him
[1:55:27] and u and then I see that at work
[1:55:32] there's like uh sometimes you see
[1:55:34] persecution
[1:55:36] you know they just like come out of
[1:55:38] nowhere and then you wonder Why? But
[1:55:41] sometimes when you go back by the grace
[1:55:43] of God, the Lord allows you to go back
[1:55:46] and see what you have done, how you have
[1:55:48] behaved yourselves, that a lot of those
[1:55:50] things that they can come and you you
[1:55:54] don't have the strength or they just
[1:55:56] come, you see that God is not on your
[1:55:57] side. And uh he said that he would fight
[1:56:01] your battles and you find sometimes you
[1:56:03] say, "God, seems like you're not
[1:56:05] fighting my battles. I see like those
[1:56:06] things just like come out of nowhere."
[1:56:09] And you remember even Bam said that um
[1:56:13] if you're at work sometimes you can see
[1:56:14] like the boss you know will be like you
[1:56:17] know making fun of you like that but
[1:56:18] it's like once get once the Holy Spirit
[1:56:21] and then you'll be turning to that boss
[1:56:23] and be talking to him in a way that the
[1:56:25] Lord will deal with him through you. So
[1:56:28] that means like a lot of victories that
[1:56:30] we lacking is because of our ways. It's
[1:56:34] because we neglecting, we rejecting,
[1:56:38] you know, we despising the Lord
[1:56:39] sometimes with the way we treat others.
[1:56:42] We are treating the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:56:43] that way. So I remember and I and I
[1:56:46] confess I I I regretted it because I had
[1:56:50] something I could have given onto to him
[1:56:53] because the Lord said if somebody
[1:56:54] approach you and you have something to
[1:56:55] give him, you know, don't just don't
[1:56:57] despise that person, you know. So I I I
[1:57:01] feel like that come to my heart. He says
[1:57:04] like um remember that guy he was begging
[1:57:07] and you just ignored him. That was not
[1:57:10] of the Lord. And I I repented. I said
[1:57:12] Lord truly I I I see why because those
[1:57:17] things can be prevent the Lord to be on
[1:57:20] your side, you know. So that's that's
[1:57:23] what I think like sometimes we lacking,
[1:57:25] you know. We we just uh lacking a lot of
[1:57:29] stuff, a lot of things that we need that
[1:57:30] we supposed there's like small victories
[1:57:34] but because of our ways because the way
