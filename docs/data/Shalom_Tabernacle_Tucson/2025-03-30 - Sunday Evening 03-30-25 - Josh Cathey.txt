right in the city and had lunch with us for the very first time he's an elder there in the city of Phoenix Glendale or that area and we had a wonderful time meeting him and talking with him and so he um invited us to his meetings that are coming up in April the 4th 5th and 6th I told him I would announce that to the church those are his special meetings brother Chad Lamb and brother Watkins will be ministering those meetings for him and so um he extends out that invitation also he has a camp they recently purchased a new campground that's going to be in May uh May the 29th through June the

greet the Saints there I pray the Lord would bless them richly and those that couldn't be in the service tonight we pray the Lord will bless you richly amen God bless you let's receive brother Josh one more time and make him feel welcome God bless you amen God bless you BL you tonight I love that song Amazing Grace it still means the same to me now as it did the first time I heard it by God's grace that's the only thing it's by by his grace tonight while we're standing we can turn over to um Isaiah 59:19 just kind of a followup what's been on my heart after the the message I preached a few Wednesdays ago getting in the Lamb's condition by God's grace I'd just like to try and say something encouraging tonight if we could and this morning what a service and I've heard brother Israel say tons of things I loved many great thoughts but this morning when when he brought that thought forth Lord let me get fat I said that's something I can say Amen to maybe physically and spiritually I like to eat a little bit but Isaiah 59:19 very familiar scripture it reads so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun it says when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him now who who lifts up that standard is it the pastor is it you who lifts up the standard is it another brother or a sister that's your standard did they lift it up for you but it says the spirit of the Lord Lord let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we just ask that you would bless this service this evening Lord that your spirit would come down Lord that you would walk these aisles and father that you would that you would use me Lord there there's nothing that I could say in myself that I could do in myself that would be a help but father only through your inspiration can I be a help Lord Lord we just ask you would bless each one here that you would just walk by and touch each one father we ask this in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may be seated so it's a spirit of the Lord here we see that that that is what raises up the standard and a lot of the times you know we try and I've seen even people that are not Christians that are maybe that are maybe wanting to be born again that are wanting to learn of Jesus that are that's wanting to hear the word what they get in the get in the habit of is they try and raise a standard their s they put a standard on their self and then they try and meet that own standard but the scripture here it plainly states that the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him and it's not our own abilities that can lift up that standard it's not how great a people we are that lifts up a standard but it's the grace of God as the song said in our life that helps lift that standard it has to be the spirit of God the true spirit of God in somebody that'll lift up a standard because if it's not the true spirit of God then it's just it's just works before God that there's nothing behind it it it's just you trying to work your way into heaven and if we can do anything to to Merit ourself working our way into heaven then why did he go to the Cross why why did Christ die for us it was all in vain if we can do one thing that merits our Salvation if we can do one thing not just our Salvation if we can do one thing that merits our healing if we can do one thing that merits just one time that he's delivered us if our own strength can do that then why did he have to go to Calvary why did he have to die on the cross and it's easy to get to that place where we try and we try and lift our own standard when we try and do it all oursel when we try and push and pull and get ourself to where we need to get to let's turn over to Psalm 34 that's the second scripture tonight verses 1-8 Psalm 34 1-8 it says I will bless the Lord at all times at all times says his praise shall continually be in my mouth and I love it when the scriptures when they tell us exactly how often to do something when there's when there's no we don't have to interpret it we don't have to wonder how many times or how often but this scripture right here it tells us exactly how much the Lord wants these things done because if it's left up to us we can let things slip if expectations and accountability isn't there by the word of God we tend to let things slip we we we start to we start to fall back a little bit in our spiritual lives he goes on he says my soul shall make her boast in the Lord The Humble shall hear thereof and be glad he said oh magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together it says I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears how many of his fears it was all of his fears now David didn't say that he delivered himself from all his fears David didn't say that he took it into his own hands and did it himself now David was a great warrior David was a great man a much greater man than I am but David he didn't do it himself no matter how great of a individual he was he didn't put his hands on it he knew where his strength was at he knew where his courage came from he knew who fought his battles and we have to have that same Revelation in our lives that I don't fight my own battles I don't win my own battles but it's the Lord that stands in my place it's the Lord that stands in the gap for me it's by his grace that all my fears that I can be delivered from them he goes on he says they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed it says this poor man cried and I kind of got my inspiration from this from Brother John we were talking one time and he was telling me about someone that that was leading songs and they were talking talking to him about this song in particular singing it in front of a congregation and he said just when I'm when I'm singing I can't seem to get into it and he brother John told them if you've never been that poor man if you've never realized that you are that spiritually poor man we're not talking financials we're talking if you never realized that you were in that place and now you're in a different place this Psalm isn't going to mean as much to you you're not going to be able to sing it from your heart and it's just the same reading it or it's the same preaching it when you're reading this M if you've never came to the Revelation that I can't do it myself I couldn't have done it myself I couldn't have bridged that Gap I couldn't have made me good enough but by God's grace and his Mercy it came into my life and it changed my heart it turned me around it gave me a new heart it did something to my spirit I had a contrite heart I had a broken spirit I had a broken heart but it came in and it did something to me if you don't if we don't have that Revelation right there these scriptures the word in general not just Psalm 34 this whole Bible is not going to mean as much it's a story of redemption it's a story of restoration it's a story of of of our our Lord and savior coming down and grabbing us says this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles there it is again David was saved out of all his fears now he's saved out of all his troubles David still he didn't do nothing to save himself out of all his troubles it wasn't by his own strength he consulted the Lord beforehand and maybe we'll turn to another scripture here in a second after after this it says the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and deliver them oh taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him it's it's not the man that trusteth in himself how smart we are how good we are how much we can get a job done but it's the man that trusteth in him Psalm 443 it says talking about the children of Israel for they got not the land in possession by their own sword neither did their own arms save them now we know that land it was a type of the Holy Ghost a type of the Holy Ghost and all the blessings within we didn't we didn't receive the spirit of God by our own sword by how great we are by anything we did for to to make him come down upon us that's not what happened and we can get in trouble when we try and get it by our own sword the work has already been done th this is a time of acceptance the work has been done it's been bought and it's been paid for and it's therefore the taking this is a time where we realize that it's been done and we accept it in our own heart where we accept what he's done for us but sometimes it's a struggle to accept it because we we might want to to take some credit we we might want to think that that we've done something to make oursel better that's just part of human nature wanting to take credit for something that's just people in general we always want to we want to be recognized we want to take credit for things that we do but with God it doesn't work that way you you got to lay it all down you got to there's no credit to be had I I was born and then up till when he came into my life I can't take credit for anything and I can't take I can't take credit for anything after he came into my life it is all him every bit of it him let's turn to let's go to 1st Samuel 30 we're talking on David here there's a lot of the times in our lives when it kind of when all hope seems lost when there's there's no other way to go no other way to turn seems like we' just been beat over the head over and over and over again by the devil and that's usually when we get to the point where we try and do it oursel where we try and start fixing some things oursel we start we start trying to clean up things ourself you know he provokes us enough to where we we move without without seeking the Lord's will on something to where we take a step without seeing if he's even there to go before us so 1st Samuel 30 let's go verse 4 and this is this is after David he had been he he had done been tossed out he he was nobody wanted him nobody wanted him around and this is David he's coming to ziklag and it said the amalekites they had just ransacked the place they had took everything that was rightfully David's the amalekites had came in and they had stripped him of it they had took it from him and I'm sure we've been there before too we've came to a point in our lives the Lord has blessed us so much and then the enemy sweeps in and it seems like he takes every single thing from us he steals our joy out of a service we can't sit there we can't be happy we can't even focus in a service he he takes all these different things and he just takes them like they're his but they're not his they're rightfully Ours by the scripture you know it reminds me of shamgar when them Philistines they come marching down the road and the the prophet kind of dramatizes a little bit he tells a story and he says shamgar had all of his stuff in his barn he had it all stacked up for next year that was rightfully Shamu guards but those Philistines he knew he heard him coming down the road and that they were going to come one more time and they were going to take everything from him everything that the Lord had blessed him with they were about to Rob him of but shamgar says that he got some righteous indignation up that's a that's a righteous anger shamgar was tired of things being taken from him he was tired of the devil hounding him on the way to church than not being able to focus in a service he said I want my peace back I I want to be able to know that God has given me these things and I can keep them so what shamgar did he got that righteous indignation up and he went out and he killed them all and now he it was a supernatural killing don't I'm not saying he didn't do it in himself but by by the power that that God put in him shamgar eliminated the threat he eliminated the problem he went to the root cause and he took care of it he was sick and tired of the devil stealing stuff from him and that's where we got to get to take it back take back what's ours if he stolen something from you take it back the word says you can have it the word says it's yours the word says you can have joy that you can have happiness in your life the word says you can be healed it says you can have peace what was he chastised for our peace peace is a hot commodity nowadays because the enem is constantly attacking our mind it's all over social media it's all over the Internet he's always putting something in front of your eyes and the eyes the prophet said it's the gateway to the soul he's always putting something out in front of your eyes for you to view something we look on the streets women half dressed the men the men are even half dressed nowadays they wear shorts up to here they can't even dress right they can't even dress theirself but take it back it's not his he's a bluff none of it's his verse four says then David and the people that were were with him lifted up their voice and they wept until until they had no more power to weep who's been there until you've had no more power to weep you feel like you've cried every tear you got to cry you feel like you've prayed every prayer that you had to pray you don't know what else to say to God you're on your knees and maybe you're there speechless you have no idea what to say anymore you feel like you've laid your heart out already you feel like you've done all you can you feel like you've done your part and now that's when the enemy sneaks in he says well have you tried this and then he tries to get you to do it yourself he tries to get you to clean up yourself make yourself better verse 5 says and David's two wives were taken captive henon the jezus and Abigail the wife of nabal the Carmelite and David was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning him because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God David didn't encourage himself by saying look how strong I am look how smart I am look how great of a warrior I am he didn't even sit there and say oh look I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ look how great I am because that's something we don't need to get away from we may be the Bride of Jesus Christ but if we don't look back to here and realize why any of the blessings are even possible if we ever lose sight of Calvary if we think we become so revelated and so lifted up and so special of a people that we lose sight of Calvary and its meaning we have to turn around and look look back at it we've gotten into a place of trouble we've got to thinking that we're we're a little too we're a little headyy and high- minded and as Believers we can get that way too we can think we're a little bit better than somebody and that'll affect saving a soul on the streets we think we're a little bit better maybe we start we we pull out our bride radar and start scanning people with it maybe are you bride are you bride can you possibly be bride what those don't exist if somebody would have scanned me before Christ came into my life it would have said no but by the grace of God but by his mercies which are knew every day now it says yes and that's because of Calvary and we can read the Seven Seals we can read the church ages we can get excited about that and those are great things but we can't never lose sight of what Calvary did for us in our lives what the what the blood of Jesus Christ does for us we have to plead the blood of Jesus Christ when these problems arise I plead the blood over my family o o over my health over my mind over my heart so that something can't can't get in here and and Harden My Heart it's hard to receive something from God if you have a hardened heart it's hard to do something for another person if your heart is hardened we think of King Saul his heart got hardened and he just wanted to harm David that's all he wanted to do to him David only only wanted to serve him David only wanted to help him be a part of everything with him but Saul through through complexes and through insecurities his heart got hardened and he wasn't able to do anything and he lost the presence of the Lord he had an evil spirit on him and that's what can happen to us I lost my plates here I don't even know verse six I think it said but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God and David said to abathar the priest a himc son I pray thee bring me hither the ephod I love that right there so David just they had just been ransacked everything had been taken from him and instead of using his great abilities as a warrior he said bring me that ephod I want to consult the Lord about this I don't want to because sometimes we can even even dealing with one another dealing with people we can we can jump to a conclusion and and we can approach somebody hastily and we can you know maybe we got a little bit of a temper and we can kind of let it out a little bit but David here I love what he did he said bring me the ephod and abathar brought thither the ephod to David and David inquired at the Lord saying shall I pursue after this troop shall I overtake them and he answered him pursue for Thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail you will recover all let's go over to verse 17 and see what this led to for David verse 17 says and David smoted them from the the Twilight even unto the evening of the day and there escaped not a man of them save 400 young men which rode upon camels and fled and David recovered all that the amalekites had carried away and David rescued as two wives and there was nothing lacking to them neither small nor great neither Sons nor daughters neither spoil nor anything that they had taken to them David recovered all and if you read verse 20 David didn't just recover all of what he lost but he was given even more on top of that the the Lord is abundant he was given even more he didn't even know that he was going to come out on top like that David going into it he was just looking what I just want to get back what was mine but what the Lord will do is you'll go into a service and you'll say Lord I want to take back the joy that I once felt in these Services Lord I want to be revived in my heart and you'll have a certain standard we'll set our own standard right here and then he goes right up here and he just go go above and beyond beyond anything that you could have even thought of you didn't go in thinking you were going to be healed of whatever is you need healing for but he heals you of it and then he makes you feel even better on top of that maybe he heals you of a couple things things you didn't even know about but that's how our God works and David here I want to notice it's such a simple thing but David it was simply because he went that the time got hard and this is a very simple thought the time got hard and he immediately dropped to his knees he went to prayer there wasn't anything there was no thinking the Bible doesn't give any um it doesn't say he thought about anything else that that he considered going and smiting them on his own but the first thing David did was he dropped to his knees he said bring me that ephod I'm going to talk to the Lord about this I'm angry right now I'm upset the enemy's taken everything from me I could God are you even with me he didn't even ask that that question but what he did was he dropped straight to his knees and he consulted the Lord about he consulted the the one person about it that could actually do something about it the one that could actually fix the problem and people may say oh we know prayer is good we want to hear you know prayer is such a simple thing to to preach on or talk about and people say I I want to hear Mysteries I want to hear I want to hear somebody get up and really tell me about all these Mysteries that we have in the message these deep things let let's talk about that let's Ponder on that and that stuff does have its place but how important is prayer how important was it to the prophet and if we want the Mysteries let me read a quote to you he said that's what I want you to do it's prayer that I depend on he said that's the secret of all the mysteries of God that's the secret of all the mysteries of God that's the key that opens the door to everything of God is prayer if you pray and you believe when you pray pray then believe that you receive what you ask for and God will make it known it's prayer that unlocks it all such a simple thing a thing that maybe sometimes we brush off oh I know to pray I know I know you know you try and give somebody advice you say well have you prayed about it of course I know to pray but have we really have we really got down have we laid laid some time to the side and prayed to the Lord seeking him on these things but he'll let you try and trust in yourself for a while he'll let you try every door he'll let you try every solution every way that you have that you think you can figure out a situation whatever it may be in your life he'll let you try those doors he'll let you walk through them he'll let you look in the room he'll let you walk back out but today looking back to Luke and looking back to what happened at Calvary there's been a veil that's been rent in half for us you know when we're trying to do it our own way we're trying to stitch that Veil back together together we're trying to put something back in between us and the Lord but the veil was Rin we can talk directly to him he can talk directly to us we can receive these blessings directly from him we don't have to go put a bull or a goat on an altar anymore but it's by the shed blood of Jesus Christ that that Veil it was rent that we're able to receive these things we don't have to push and pull it's already been done for us the prophet here in the message the mighty conqueror he says you can't walk walk outside of this Veil he said you've got to come in here to find out you've got to get here where there's nothing between you and God think about that do an inventory in your mind where there's nothing between you and God where the angels of God can descend and Ascend back and forth bringing the messages of God back and forth to the individual there's nothing between my soul and the Savior the poet said he said there he sits the mighty conqueror he rent every Veil into he rent The Veil that you could be saved he rent The Veil that if you've committed adultery if you have cursed if you've done anything wrong he rent that Veil for you that stick that Satan holds over you he rent it if you've only received him now that stick I like that he said it like that how many of us have felt like sat that we messed up somewhere and there's a stick that Satan holds over you maybe when you're in a time of prayer when you're trying to get down that he just sits there and he holds it over your head and you can't get it out of your mind route when you go to when you're seeking the Lord that's in the Forefront of your mind that's a thought that the enemy's putting there he's trying to bring you into remembrance of your mistakes instead of remembrance of what happened at Calvary when we go to pray be in remembrance of the the shed blood of Jesus Christ not of your mistakes before the blood we don't care about the mistakes before the blood they they don't mean anything anything to us we don't need to think about those anymore there there's no purpose in looking back to those mistakes what good could that do you looking back to before you were saved what what good is that going to do a Believer that's only going to hinder a Believer he says he rent that Veil for you that stick that Satan holds over you he rent it if you'll only receive it he said if you're sick today and the doctor said says you can't get well he rent that Veil into two and everything is broken before God he rent every Veil he tears down every domain he sits there today present tense today the prophet might have said this in 56 but it's just as good now today he's still sitting there the mighty conqueror says the mighty conqueror since he rent the veil in two and we don't want to be caught trying to sew it back to together we don't want to be caught trying to put that Veil back together because we can't accept his grace like we said it's a time of acceptance It's a Time the work's already been done the the job's done the blood's there but it's just accepting it but it's difficult sometimes to accept it it's hard to get oursel into a place that last message getting into the right condition to accept something from the Lord getting into a condition to where we can have a Revival in the church it seems like Revival keeps getting mentioned a Revival in this church people want it people are yearning for it I'm not talking about a group Revival I'm talking about every individual in their own heart receiving Revival from the Lord that's what we want but but Revival it's also it's not just about the hooting and the hollering and running the aisles and doing back flips and all all that stuff that stuff is great and the spirit can get on people but what Revival is about is when you can receive that Revival in your heart and walk out of those doors and go live out there with that same Revival in your heart where when you exit this place nothing's taking it from you when you go to work it don't matter what they're what filth they're talking about you still got Revival in your heart where was that Welch man when when they approached him and they said where's the Revival at and he said he was at work he said the Revival's right here it's in me this is where the Revival is Revival isn't about how loud it gets it's about if God can actually get to that heart and if he can do something with it but if we have these things laying in the way we got to get them out of the way first we got to make things right we got to follow his outline of how he said to do it if we want to receive something I just like to quote the message that we heard too and this is to me this is what Revival looks like you know Christ that we don't want to Smite The Rock a second time it's already been smitten The Rock has been smitten we just need to speak to it now and the prophet said what we heard Wednesday he said if you need Joy speak to the Rock he said if you need salvation let this sink deep in your heart if you need salvation speak to the Rock if you need Divine Healing speak to the Rock if you need the Holy Ghost speak to the Rock and he'll bring forth his Waters the Waters of Salvation if you'll just speak to the Rock anything you have need of speak to the Rock he said the rock is just the same today as he ever was he still got eternal life he still got Eternal peace he still got joy unspeakable and full of Glory you know what message a prophet preached more than any other message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 138 he wanted to get that point across the Lord wanted you to know I'm the same as I was then what you seen me do then I can do now I can move upon you now Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new I'm still the same I haven't left you I haven't forsaken you there may be afflictions but I'm still the same what did I do with the Hebrew children I was the fourth man in the fire then and I can still be that now but he's waiting for somebody to accept that word that's in the word he's waiting for somebody an individual to grab a hold of it and let that sink into their heart you know we read it and we say that's a beautiful scripture that's really nice he would do that and then we don't think that I'm I'm in the fire right now well if you're in the fire right now he can be your fourth man he can still do it for you he's in everpresent help in times of trouble he can still be there he hasn't changed a bit if I wouldn't hang my soul on a God that changes a God that moves around a God that's that's kind of whimsical that just changes his mind and I'll heal you today I won't now no but the promise is there he's done it before believe he can do it again what's a song only believe it's simple we make it difficult sometimes but it's simple to just believe just take this word and take it into your heart and believe it he said he's still joy unspeakable and full of Glory still got Divine Healing he's the same yesterday day and forever the only thing that people need to do is speak to the Rock Amen you believe that how how often I don't know this's a little thought I had I don't know if I mentioned it here that Wednesday or not how often do we do we forget to call our loved ones you know we we'll call our our mom or our dad or our brother or sister whoever it may be we'll call them and be on the phone every day with them and talk hours and hours and you know that shows that we were thinking about them that shows probably that we love them so why don't we do the same thing with the Lord how often do we forget to make that call every day do we slip up and maybe we don't make that call we don't spend the time we should communicating with him he looks at those things he thinks about those things I hope it is brother Rick if not we need to get it there he says let us bow our heads in and speak to the Rock everybody in prayer says Heavenly Father we come in the name of the rock I love this prayer he says the rock in a weary land the shelter in the time of storm we pray oh Lord God that The Rock will overshadow us with his power and his Mercy he said that did every sick person here make be healed today may they speak to the Rock there are men and women sitting here suffering with cancer or fill in the blank right there and that quote fill in the blank for yourself that's what I like with quotes he can heal anything so it doesn't have to just be cancer put what you got in there put what you have in that quote I'm not saying SP splice the tapes and change the quotes and change the words round don't get me wrong but put your Affliction in there make it personal to you maybe you're not sitting here with cancer today but maybe you have your own struggles whatever they may be I don't know what any of your struggles are I don't know if any of you are sick I don't know what your problems in life are I don't know if you need marital help if you need healing in your body or whatever it may be you know I could sit up here and say oh I bet somebody needs healing in their back well I'm probably right somebody probably does need healing in their back but the person that does know is him and he can take it from you right on the spot we just have to take the word and put it to use we have to take take the word and really accept it in and not just accept it in for the service today then walk out the doors then Monday rolls around tomorrow and our back hurts again and we say man I missed it I guess it didn't happen I guess I wasn't healed oh it doesn't matter it's probably going to get worse the prophet told us it will get worse and I guess we're talking on the lines of healing now but that's that's what it is it'll get worse but you have to persevere through that you have to keep a steadfast faith through the Affliction he said send there suffer with cancer some of them blind and some crippled the doctor says there's no hope in them then let them speak to the Rock I wanted to find a quote I had on him being on that thought bear with me here here it is it's in the church age book it's on that Revelation that that Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever in the church age book it said it is the revelation of God that will give you authority over every devil it's the revelation of God that'll give you authority over every devil it's not the it's not how great you are how much you've accomplished and he said that Revelation in the church age book he called that Revelation in particular the Keystone of the Bible do we all know what a keystone is it's a top of an archway when one part comes up and the other part comes up and that Keystone right in the middle it's what connects every bit of it it's what makes every bit of it make sense it's what makes your healing make sense your deliverance makes sense your salvation makes sense it's what it's what helps the Old Testament type the New Testament he said that revelation of God right there that's the Keystone of the Bible he said and you can see why they would add or take from it would be cursed he said it would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of God and over overcome the enemy it is that simple there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word in another place he said he's the same elshad tonight said he changes not and his Covenant people which would be us has the same privilege to draw from the same source that the Father Abraham had to draw because God swore by the same Covenant that he'd give us the promise Hallelujah he says oh my there you are there's where my hope is built on nothing less but Jesus's blood and his righteousness said when all around my soul gives away I've been there before when I felt like all around my soul had given away like I didn't have anywhere else to go he's All My Hope and stay on Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sink in sand he said there you are he said elshad the the bosom the breasted God if you need salvation for your weak Soul draw from his side if you need healing for your body draw from this side for my Covenant was with Christ my son and in there he was wounded for your transgressions and he was by his stripes you were healed he said I'm the almighty just lean up here and go to drawing from them promises he said just lean up here when I think about leaning on something it's not I'm not pushing and pulling I'm just sitting and I'm just accepting I'm just waiting on something if I'm leaning on a wall then I'm just at rest and when we pray for these things just go to rest just sit there and lean and lean as long as it takes just lean and rest and see if it doesn't come forth see if through patience see if through waiting on the Lord see if the promise doesn't doesn't happen he said God you promised it Lord tomorrow I don't care how you feel what you look like Lord I'm drawing from that promise watch how strength begins to renew how things begin to straighten up how arms begin to move out how eyes begin to brighten up how Hearts begin to beat normal he said the breasted God I'm drawing he said well I don't care how I feel what I look like I'm drawing from that breast he's got another spot I'm trying to find here I'm all all over the place I done went down and up and in the middle and let me see well I'll get to it sooner or later yeah the prophet says here but you might say to me brother brandom I've already did that is in the door to the heart when Jesus knocked at my heart I let him in he said well that's good but when he come into your heart did you welcome him to your entire being he said there's many people that will welcome Jesus and his savior but can he be your lord can he take complete control in you he said Lord is ownership the Lord has complete control you would plenty welcome him to keep you out of hell and torment you would welcome him as your savior but are you willing to welcome him as your lord to take over full control you know we have to approach God With No Reservations holding nothing back not wanting to keep anything to ourself everything can be taken away if need be that's the kind of attitude we have to have and God loves he loves a desperate and a broken heart a heart that's just that's in pieces he loves to put it back together he loves to mend things it's like the Potter and the clay I think the first time I preached here I spoke on the Potter and the clay how that clay it's probably it's it's sitting there getting smooshed and beat on and and pushed around and if it had a mind of its own it'd probably be pretty confused but but all it's doing it's getting it to the Masterpiece that the that the Potter wants it to get to that's all that this that's all that this life here is getting us to the Masterpiece that he wants us to be and I don't mean in our flesh I don't mean sitting here we're going to we're going to struggle with the flesh as long as we're here we're going to make mistakes but the Perfection is through the blood when he sees us and we're perfect that's through the blood of Jesus Christ we're not perfect in our flesh we're not perfect in making our better but it's only through that shed blood that we can be perfect he said that's a danger of rejecting Jesus Christ tomorrow some other time he said you get so hard and so callous you don't want nothing about it he said that's what the world is today it's getting so calloused it don't want Christ it's got so much luxury in things and if we could turn over to Psalm 51 verse 7-1 17 verse seven reads David talking here Purge me with hisp now David who is he asking to purge him the Lord he says' and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou Hast broken May Rejoice hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities this should be all of our prayer this should every day of our life this should we shouldn't get to a point where we think we're Beyond praying this prayer right here we'll never get to that point while we're here he said and blot out all mine iniquities he said create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation Lord restore the joy that the devil stole from me the joy I used to walk in here and I used to love Services I used to be so excited to get to the house of God lord restore that to my heart if that's your prayer I hope he restores that to your heart I've been there before I I've I've been to a place where I've came to services and I'm being open and honest now where I've came to services and I want looking forward to it I it was more of a work to me than it was me me doing something you know out of out of my heart wanting to do something unto the Lord and if you pray that prayer he will bring that Joy back that Joy was brought back to me I was brought back to a place back to the beginning really because in the beginning when when it's brand new and you realize that are you telling me this man Jesus he marched to Calvary and he died for me when he didn't have to when that Revelation and that that thought is brand new in your mind that that's when we come in here on fire that that's a thought that leads to Revival that's a thought that leads to the spirit of God falling he says restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit then I will teach transgressors thy ways I love that right there then I will teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee deliver me from blood guiltiness oh God and thou God of my salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness oh Lord open my lips and my mouth shall show forth thy praise for thou desirest not sacrifice else would I give it thou Delight us not in burnt offering that's like us he's not the The Works are good but that's not what he's looking for he wants your heart he he wants to put a new spirit in you he and he wants to do it over and over again baptism after baptism he doesn't ever want to stop the The Works are great and the works are good but he just wants your heart that's all he cares about because if he if he gets a hold of your heart then the works are real then the works really mean something then but if he hadn't got a hold of that heart yet the works are they're okay you're still a good person there's a lot of good people out there but I want God to get so aold of my heart that I want to work for him nonstop and I don't want to work because because of anything I don't want any reward I don't want to I don't want them to talk about like he tells that story I can't think of the brother but I think he he got to heaven and they what they talk about his his crown and his robe and he said I don't want to be talked to about that I just want to look at him for a thousand years don't talk to me about those things everything I did down here was for him I didn't seek no reward I didn't need anything need any payment he had already paid the ultimate price for me and then that revelation came into my heart and then I worked for him every day of my life he says for thou desirest not sacrifice else I would give it thou desirest not in burnt offering the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit a broken and contrite heart oh God thou wil not despise then Ezekiel 36:26 says a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them the prophet says in Hebrews he says and if your heart begins to stray around you know there is something that's happening go back to the Altar and say Christ renew my the joy of my salvation give unto me that love that I once had it's leaking out Lord there's something I've done make me holy again stand said oh Lord nothing I could do I can't quit this and I can't quit that I'm looking to you to take it out of me Lord and I love you he's the only one that can change your desires he's the only one that can change your nature no matter how hard we fight no matter how hard we pull if there's still some Desires in there that aren't quite right we have to lean on him to change those things we have to act not just that we have to lean on him to change anything and everything he said and walk away from the altar a new person in Christ Jesus then you won't have to depend on your church depend on your priest depend on your pastor you're depending on the shed blood of the Lord Jesus by grace are you saved and such a simple thought but we have to have that revelation of by Grace you are saved every single day or else if we don't have that in our hearts we'll start doing it ourself we'll start making our own way let's go to one more scripture Mark 5: 21-30 I just want to look at two people who maybe tried to do it all their self verse 21 reads and when Jesus was passed over Over Again by ship unto the other side much people gathered unto him and he was nigh unto the sea and behold there cometh one of the rulers of the sinagogue jerus by name and when he saw him he fell at his feet what a great place to be what a great place to get to what I don't think that's in the in the scripture by happen stance he fell at his feet and besought him greatly saying my little daughter lith at the point of death I pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she shall live now Jesus liked the expectations that gyrus came forth with that's his expectations right there he he blatantly said I believe if you come that she will be healed and Jesus went with him and much people followed him you know sometimes when we come in with the wrong expectations it it wouldn't be and Jesus went with him it would be and Jesus departed from him and Jesus got away from him we have to walk through those doors like the like the Pastor said this morning what you expect is what you'll get and that's so true that's true in every aspect of life and especially true in the house of God what you expect you will get and gyrus got what he expected is a clear proof of it and Jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him and a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years and had suffered many things and many Physicians look at this next line and had spent all that she had and nothing better and had spent all that she had how many of us have gotten to the point where we have spent all that we had I'm not talking about out of our wallet I'm talking about our our mind what we can't think about it anymore we can't think about the problems we can't thinking about the healing we spent all that we have emotionally spiritually and we're at a point like she was at she had spent all that she had she said but rather it said but rather grew worse when she had heard of Jesus came in the press behind him and touched His Garment for she said if I may touch but his clothes here comes her expectation Here Comes her expectation coming forth if I may but touch his clothes I shall be whole and straight way the Fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague and Jesus immediately knowing in himself that virt had gone out of him turned him about in the press and said who touched my clothes their hopes their their everything relied on Jesus Christ that day they were at the end of their Road they were at a point where they couldn't put their hope and anything else she had tried doctors gyus said he had probably tried doctors too they had probably tried everything they knew to try and they finally got to that last door which was Jesus Christ and what I would like to say maybe maybe sometimes it would be better if he was the first door and he wasn't that last door if we could these scriptures are here to learn by these things to take a lesson from it Psalm 39:7 says and now Lord what wait I for my hope is in thee Psalm 135 says I wait for the Lord my soul doth wait and in his word do I hope Lamentations 3:19 through 24 says remembering mine Affliction and my misery the wormwood and the gold my soul hath them still in remembrance and is humbled in me this I recall to my mind therefore have I hope it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness the Lord is my portion that's that's the to the individual we should say that the Lord is my portion saith my soul therefore will I hope in him my prayer is Lord let me be in remembrance of what you've done for me let me be in expectation of what you're going to do for me but Lord don't let me pass up on these present blessings in my life Lord don't let me forget where you've put me right now and it's only by the shed blood of Jesus Christ it's only as the first song said right there the Amazing Grace of Jesus Christ that this has happened it's not about our past mistakes it's not about any of that stuffff but those are things that we're that he tries to remind us of and just as the musicians come I just have a few more quotes here to read the prophet in that day on Calvary he said now there's where we lose our position if we don't watch we try to look back to what we was and as long as we look back to what we was the sacrifice means nothing to us he says oh can't you see it church I would I would not try the job I can't and neither can you there's no need of trying he said you're lost to begin with and as long as you look back to what you've done but don't look to what but don't look to what you've done he says look what that day on Calvary did to you he said it paid your price it settled the question your sins be as Scarlet they're as white as snow red like Crimson white like wool then you have no sin you are perfectly sinless no matter what you done or what you do you're still sinless as long as you've accepted Jesus Christ as your savior your sins are forgiven Anything Is Forgiven is remitted and forgot about if God's forgot about it won't you forget about it if it's been thrown away until the SE of forgetfulness now it's easier said than done but then won't you forget about it quit letting the devil hold that stick over your head quit letting him hold whatever that thing may be it's gone it's forgotten about it's forgiven in another place the prophet says now just don't turn loose he says take a hold just hold on the calvary until you're satisfied every portion that God promised is satisfied he said that's right get right down to business he said when you get to business God will get to business he said it'll be up to you now just claim those promises to you he said oh God I believe you I will never turn loose I'll stay right here till something happens to my soul said remember friends this may be the last time may be the last prayer you'll ever pray he said the death angel May summon you before daylight he said Now's the Time to get down to business with God he said Now's the Time to believe it confess your sins go right back to where you left him go right back wherever you left him and there you'll find him again said what caused you to lose your joy find out where you lost it at go right back there and say Lord I'm sorry I'm starting right here find out where you left him where did you lose your joy at wherever you lost your joy wherever you stopped serving him go right back to that spot again start right there right where you left it at there's where you find him he will be waiting standing there waiting to receive you says Lord Jesus come to them Lord grant it Lord let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for the service today Lord both the services father we know that there's a way back your Prophet preached it and Lord let us always keep that revelation of the shed blood of Jesus Christ near and dear to our heart Lord as we may we may feel revelated sometimes we may we may feel special in our own self and our own flesh but Lord help us to come to the realization that none of it is possible without what happened at Calvary with what happened at the cross that was the Pinnacle of Christianity right there there's nothing better coming than that there was never anything as good as that for it and Lord as we come into that Revelation in our heart as it's new to us as your mercies are new as it's like the first time that we realized it Lord if there be any Afflicted here if there be any that Lord that needs help in their soul and their Spirit they have a broken heart a a contrite heart Lord Lord the scripture told us that you will not despise that but Lord we believe that you would come down and you would touch them in their hearts [Music] Lord help each one of us to receive more of you Lord to to not do things that would hinder that Lord to clear out our lives clear out our minds clear out our hearts Lord just make us open and willing vessels today Lord that you could move us to where you would need us where you could just take our lives and that we may be a light in this day Lord that we could walk out of here and we could draw people not because we look different not because we act different but Lord because people can tell that there's a different spirit inside of us Lord that that there's just something different Lord help us to be salty help us to draw them in Lord draw the last one in and father we thank you and we love you here
