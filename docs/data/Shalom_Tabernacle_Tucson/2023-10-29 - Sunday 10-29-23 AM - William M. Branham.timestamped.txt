[4:58] seated
[5:00] in the Bible in the Book of Ruth as you

[5:04] was called the goal g o e l was called
[5:08] the goal or it was a person that could
[5:11] meet the requirements and the goal must
[5:14] be able to do it must be willing to do
[5:17] it and must be a Kinsman next to Kinsman
[5:22] to do it and God the creator of spirit
[5:26] became kin folks to us when he become m
[5:29] in order he could take our sin upon him
[5:31] and pay the price and redeem us back to
[5:34] God
[5:35] again there it is there is the
[5:38] Redeemer Christ has redeemed us now we
[5:42] are now redeemed but he has not claimed
[5:47] his possession
[5:49] yet now you might differ that but you
[5:52] just hold on a minute we'll see he
[5:55] hasn't claimed it see if he took the the
[5:59] book of redemption everything that Adam
[6:02] had and everything that he lost Christ
[6:06] redeems back and he's already redeemed
[6:10] us but he hasn't took the possession yet
[6:13] he cannot until the time appointed and
[6:16] then will come the resurrection and then
[6:19] the Earth will be renewed again and then
[6:23] he'll take possession his possession
[6:25] which he got when he redeemed us but
[6:28] we'll do at the appointed time oh
[6:33] my uh this is described in this seven
[6:38] seal book that we're talking of now all
[6:42] right the book of redemption it's all
[6:44] described in here all that what Christ
[6:47] will do at the end will be revealed to
[6:50] us this week in the Seven Seals of God
[6:53] lettuce all right it'll be revealed and
[6:56] revealed as the seals break
[6:59] and are released to us then we can see
[7:03] what this great Plan of Redemption is
[7:06] and when and how it's going to be done
[7:09] it's all hidden in this book of mystery
[7:12] here it's sealed up with Seven Seals and
[7:16] so lamb is the only one who can break
[7:19] them now pardon me we realize now if
[7:22] you'd like to look in the scriptures you
[7:24] can get over in Jeremiah and find out
[7:26] there when uh he was um when he he was
[7:30] going into the Captivity land you know
[7:32] he he bought his uncle his uncle's son
[7:36] had some uh some property and he went
[7:39] through that uh ceiling and if we talk
[7:42] it all we got that also in the seven
[7:45] Church ages and seals and so forth in
[7:47] there you see a seal in the Old
[7:50] Testament was like a roll like this and
[7:52] here was a mystery and this mystery was
[7:56] hidden all right it was sealed around
[7:59] and put here the claim to so and so then
[8:02] the next mystery was wrapped around of
[8:05] what this inheritance was and stuck out
[8:07] your on this side uh the the the claim
[8:10] to so and so and went on down until it
[8:13] made a scroll because people didn't have
[8:15] books like this then it was in a roll
[8:17] how many knows that called a scroll well
[8:20] a seal scroll you could break loose one
[8:23] here what the mystery of this was and
[8:25] tear it loose and you can see what that
[8:28] claim was
[8:30] and then break the other loose and you
[8:32] see what that claim was and the whole
[8:35] thing here is Seven Seals got the
[8:38] mysteries of God from the foundational
[8:40] world all sealed up in there and
[8:44] revealed by seven different seals that
[8:47] of God willing let him let us pull back
[8:49] these seals and look down through the
[8:51] book and find out what it's all
[8:53] about oh I hope we have a great
[8:56] time there the mystery of Redemption is
[9:00] sealed until this book could not be
[9:06] broken until the last Angel's
[9:10] message the Scrolls
[9:12] there we know it was there we know that
[9:16] it was Redemption we believed it was
[9:18] Redemption Jeremiah said this scroll
[9:21] must be kept as you read it there he say
[9:23] he must be kept in an Earthly vessel see
[9:27] oh what a beautiful thing talk about a
[9:30] while this scroll was kept in an Earthly
[9:34] vessel a vessel that once became
[9:39] flesh
[9:41] Glory di rose again and kept in the
[9:46] Earthly vessel until the time of the
[9:52] purchase beautifully all right
[9:56] now these messages are all kept up until
[10:01] this Earthly vessel until the time of
[10:05] God's appointed time at the last
[10:07] messenger at the Earth and all that
[10:10] these people had judged that and said I
[10:12] know it's there I believe it's there and
[10:14] they followed it and brought it forth
[10:16] and produced The Things by faith they
[10:18] believed it but now it's going to be
[10:21] brought to us in Revelation and from the
[10:24] hand of God by
[10:27] Vindication God said so
[10:30] you promised it now now let's see what
[10:33] where was we at let's go to verse two
[10:35] now that's a long time for verse one but
[10:39] let's let's take verse
[10:42] two
[10:44] now we probably won't stay that long on
[10:47] the next
[10:48] one and I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[10:51] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[10:54] book and to loose the seal thereof now
[10:56] remember let's read the first verse
[10:58] again so we get get it together I saw in
[11:00] the right hand of him that's set up on
[11:02] the throne God who is that the
[11:07] absolutely original holder of the book
[11:10] of
[11:11] life he holds it God
[11:14] does when Adam forfeited it went back to
[11:20] its original
[11:22] owner it belongs to
[11:25] him and John in the vision looked over
[11:29] and saw in the right hand of him that
[11:31] set upon a
[11:32] throne uh a book written within and on
[11:37] the backside seal with Seven Seals see
[11:41] inside now when we go to Breaking these
[11:43] seals you're going to see it goes Plum
[11:45] back in the scripture all the way back
[11:47] for each one of those seals the whole
[11:49] thing together the whole mystery lays
[11:51] right you're in these
[11:54] seals see every mystery of the Bible
[11:58] lays in these SE seals and the seals
[12:00] cannot be broken until that time am amen
[12:04] I prove it here just a minute
[12:07] notice now the book remember is sealed
[12:11] there's one here is this seal then
[12:14] another one's WRA a seal another one's
[12:17] WRA a seal it's a book of
[12:20] redemption and the whole thing together
[12:22] makes the book and it's sealed with
[12:26] Seven Seals and but in on the backside
[12:29] is because it's wound up the seal
[12:32] mystery is on the inside and only says
[12:35] the white horse rider the black horse
[12:37] rider and what more on the
[12:40] outside but the mystery of the whole
[12:43] book is in them
[12:46] seals from Genesis Revelations a
[12:49] complete Plan of
[12:51] Redemption is revealed in these Seven
[12:54] Seals what it's an important time God
[12:57] help us to get it
[12:59] now and a strong angel now verse two the
[13:04] strong angel with a loud voice
[13:06] proclaiming who is worthy worthy for why
[13:10] who is worthy to take that book now we
[13:14] find out where's the book at now to its
[13:17] original owner because it has been
[13:21] forfeited by a son the first Son of
[13:25] God in the human race
[13:29] and when he forfeit his rights to listen
[13:32] to Satan he give up what did he do he
[13:36] accepted Satan's wisdom instead of God's
[13:41] word now couldn't we stop here a
[13:45] while sons of God will take a seminary's
[13:50] idea about it instead of the word of
[13:53] God same thing Adam did for fored his
[13:56] right and when it did it went rightous
[13:58] straight back can't you see where those
[14:00] ages has
[14:01] been see went right straight back to the
[14:04] original horror and John in the spirit
[14:07] standing up here in heaven he's just
[14:08] been lifted up now from the church ages
[14:10] see saw the church ages and then he was
[14:12] taken up in the fourth chapter he said
[14:15] come up higher I'm going to show you
[14:16] things that will come and he saw one
[14:19] sitting upon the throne with this book
[14:21] in his hand in his right
[14:24] hand think of it now and then
[14:29] in this book was a title deed to
[14:33] Redemption and it was sealed with Seven
[14:36] Seals and then an angel came forth a
[14:40] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[14:44] voice who was worthy to open the book to
[14:48] take the book who was able to open the
[14:52] seals who was able to open this
[14:57] book see the angel asked it John saw it
[15:01] and he said now who's worthy let him oh
[15:06] my maybe I'm is feeling this this way
[15:10] but let him said the angel amen let him
[15:14] here is the book of
[15:16] redemption here is the Plan of
[15:18] Redemption here is the only way you'll
[15:20] ever be redeemed for there is the title
[15:25] deed to Redemption of the whole heavens
[15:28] and earth
[15:30] let him come forward if he will oh
[15:35] my now speak of forever holy
[15:39] spe let him come
[15:41] forward and claim this book who's worthy
[15:46] to do it and John said there was no man
[15:50] in heaven found worthy no man on Earth
[15:53] found worthy no man beneath the Earth
[15:56] that ever lived and died was found
[15:57] worthy amen no man was found
[16:01] worthy the Angel's call was a call for
[16:05] the kinsman redeemer to appear God said
[16:09] I have a law a kinsman redeemer can can
[16:12] be a substitute where is that kinsman
[16:15] redeemer who's able to take it and it
[16:19] come from Adam all the way down through
[16:22] all the apostles and Prophets and
[16:24] everything else and nobody was found now
[16:27] what about that
[16:29] amen nobody in heaven nobody on Earth
[16:34] nobody that ever live Elijah was
[16:36] standing there Moses was standing there
[16:40] all the apostles were standing there uh
[16:43] all the ones that had died all the holy
[16:46] man job the
[16:49] sages everyone was standing there and
[16:52] nobody was worthy even to look at the
[16:55] book let alone take it and break the
[16:58] seal
[16:59] Now where's the pope and all these
[17:01] coming out where's your
[17:04] Bishop where's our worthiness were
[17:07] nothing
[17:09] right he asked for the kinsman redeemer
[17:12] to step forward if he could but John
[17:15] said no man was worthy not that there
[17:19] wasn't worthy people there now like an
[17:22] angel like uh for instance we'd say a
[17:25] Gabriel or Michael but remember remember
[17:29] it had to be a
[17:31] Kinsman remember John said here and no m
[17:35] n not Angel not sarapin they hadn't seen
[17:40] but they were in a different
[17:42] category they had never fallen but this
[17:45] had to be a kinsman
[17:48] redeemer no
[17:50] man because there was not a
[17:52] redeemed no man was worthy to look at it
[17:56] oh no my my so it took a human
[18:01] Kinsman and he asked for it and he
[18:03] wasn't found nowhere there's nobody no
[18:06] Bishop no Archbishop no Priest No
[18:09] hierarchy no nothing was even and didn't
[18:12] even have the Holiness enough to even
[18:14] look at the book
[18:16] amen my that's pretty strong but that's
[18:19] what the Bible say Amen I'm just quoting
[18:21] what John said amen the Bible said that
[18:25] John
[18:27] wept not as some people has taught it I
[18:30] hear a man teach this one time said John
[18:32] wept because and he found himself not
[18:35] worthy oh any man under the Holy Spirit
[18:38] was no different from that see under the
[18:40] inspiration of God but no different than
[18:41] that but John wept here's what I think
[18:45] he went for because if no one was worthy
[18:49] and could open this book of redemption
[18:53] the whole creation was
[18:55] [Applause]
[18:57] lost there is the book there is a title
[19:01] deed and it will be offered to the
[19:04] kinsman redeemer that can meet the
[19:10] qualifications that's God's Own law and
[19:12] he can't defile his law can't defile
[19:15] law see God required a kinsman redeemer
[19:19] who was
[19:20] worthy who was able to do it we had the
[19:23] substance to do
[19:25] it and the angel said now let that
[19:29] kinsman redeemer step
[19:31] forward John looked he looked all over
[19:34] the Earth he looked benath the Earth and
[19:37] there was nobody am their creation and
[19:41] the everything was
[19:45] lost of course John went everything was
[19:50] lost his crying didn't last but just a
[19:53] minute
[19:54] of
[19:56] Hallelujah the N took one of the other
[19:58] said don't weep John amen hallelujah
[20:01] praise the Lord oh this Cryme didn't
[20:04] last for just a
[20:06] minute hallu John thought oh my where is
[20:09] the man there s of prophets this born
[20:12] like I was there stand stages there say
[20:16] holy to nobody here I want a
[20:20] man that's able to do it I want a
[20:24] man that can redeem and he wasn't found
[20:29] so John broke out everything was lost
[20:32] and he wept bitterly and he he was sad
[20:36] cuz everything the whole creation
[20:38] everything was gone if they couldn't
[20:40] find
[20:41] somebody glory to
[20:44] God if they couldn't find somebody that
[20:47] can meet that
[20:49] requirements there every human being of
[20:52] the whole world and creation was
[20:57] gone
[20:58] PA everything had fallen the the the
[21:02] rights of redemption the rights of of
[21:04] eternal life uh the light all these
[21:07] rights have been
[21:09] forfeited and there was nobody who could
[21:12] pay the
[21:14] price and John started crying because no
[21:17] one was worthy and no one could even
[21:20] look at the oh it took the Human Being
[21:24] John we because no one could do it and
[21:27] everything was lost and there came a
[21:29] voice from one of the elders standing
[21:32] amidst the four beast and all that great
[21:34] host of Heaven said don't weak
[21:38] John oh my grace of God don't be
[21:43] brokenhearted John don't we for the lie
[21:48] of the
[21:49] tribe of
[21:52] Judah the rud and Offspring from
[21:56] David he has vailed prail means rational

[22:16] line of and the root of David has
[22:22] prevailed has
[22:25] overcome like uh uh Jacob the
[22:30] supplanter and when he got in contact
[22:32] with the angel he held
[22:34] on and the angel tried to pull away he
[22:37] said I'm just not going to let you
[22:39] go he held on until he got what he
[22:44] wanted for and his name was changed from
[22:46] supplanter which means deceiver to what
[22:50] to a prince with
[22:53] God
[22:55] Israel he prevailed and this
[22:59] line of the tribe of Judah Prevail he
[23:03] said don't weep John for the line of the
[23:07] tribe of Judah the root of David has
[23:10] prevailed he's already
[23:11] overcome he's done it it's over
[23:16] John

[23:22] [Applause]
[23:26] beach Glory that sand sent on back to
[23:30] the greasy hands that the with his
[23:32] wisdom that defiled it the human being
[23:36] yes but when John turned to
[23:40] look he saw a
[23:43] lamb what a different from a line he
[23:46] said the line has prevailed see again I
[23:49] could use that there God hid in
[23:53] Simplicity he said is a line that's a
[23:56] king of the Beast
[23:58] the line has prevailed the strongest
[24:01] thing there is is a
[24:03] line I've laid out in the jungles in

[56:17] basis this morning to place it up
[56:20] on now we read the 20 uh 23rd chapter
[56:24] the 33rd verse of the 23rd
[56:30] chapter and when they came to the place
[56:33] which is called Calvary There They
[56:36] Crucified
[56:37] him and the malif factors one on the
[56:41] right hand and the other on the left now
[56:46] I want to take four words out of there
[56:50] out of that reading to base what I want
[56:52] to say there there They Crucified him
[56:58] four words and I'm my subject is
[57:02] called uh I'm bringing an
[57:08] indictment uh to the denominational
[57:11] churches of this day and Al so many of
[57:15] The
[57:16] Independents for crucifying Jesus Christ
[57:20] aesh in this day inditing them this
[57:24] morning it's called the
[57:27] indictment and I want to kind of use it
[57:29] more like it it was like a room of a
[57:33] courtroom where there was and after all
[57:36] the pulpit and the church is a
[57:40] courtroom the Bible said it's a judgment
[57:43] seat at at must begin at the house of
[57:47] the
[57:48] Lord and this is like the the throne and
[57:52] the and the jury and the witnesses and
[57:54] so forth and I have today for my witness
[58:01] is God's
[58:03] word and my indictment is against the
[58:07] churches of today now I I'm not bringing
[58:11] the sinner into this I'm just speaking
[58:13] this to the church and it's it's to be
[58:15] in the tapes now and uh I try to get
[58:20] through as quick as I can I indite this
[58:23] generation for the second CR crucifixion
[58:25] of Jesus
[58:27] Christ and now to do this in this age
[58:31] that we live in I I do this I'm must
[58:34] show an Evidence if I have to bring an
[58:38] indictment you have to show an Evidence
[58:40] of the criminal offense that has been
[58:42] done I I have to indict them I I have to
[58:46] bring the the evidence to prove it that
[58:50] it is that what I'm saying will stand up
[58:53] before the main judge
[58:55] which is I take myself as an
[58:58] attorney uh on this indictment that the
[59:00] word of God being my witness I indict
[59:03] this generation for the
[59:06] crucifixion I'm must show and will show
[59:10] uh that the same spirit is on the people
[59:14] today that brought the first crucifixion
[59:16] and doing the same
[59:18] thing I I must do that if it's going to
[59:20] be a crucifixion that they've crucified
[59:23] I'm must show to the the people that the
[59:26] same attitude in the people today is
[59:30] doing the same thing spiritually that
[59:32] they did physically then they crucified
[59:36] physically Jesus Christ the son of God
[59:40] and now today by the same word and by
[59:44] the the same Holy Spirit and the same
[59:46] word I I wish to show the churches their
[59:50] their where they
[59:52] stand uh that they are doing the same
[59:55] thing today and the Bible said they
[59:57] would do it and prove that this is the
[1:00:00] day that we're living in it could not
[1:00:02] been done a few years ago I say 50 years
[1:00:06] ago it could not have been done but
[1:00:08] today this is very
[1:00:11] timely and it could not have been done
[1:00:13] maybe 10 years ago but it can be done
[1:00:17] today
[1:00:18] because the the time is run
[1:00:22] out we are we are the end time and I
[1:00:26] believe as his servant that we are we're
[1:00:30] just about to cross from this land to
[1:00:34] another therefore the time for
[1:00:37] repentance for a nation it's gone I
[1:00:42] believe that this nation cannot
[1:00:45] repent I believe that it's cross the
[1:00:49] line between mercy and judgment I
[1:00:53] believe she t Ling in the
[1:00:55] bounds brother brandham before you start
[1:00:58] your case how you going to prove that
[1:01:00] just this that we're guilty of the same
[1:01:04] sins that God destroyed the World by in
[1:01:07] the Andel luian World we're guilty of
[1:01:10] the same sins that he destroyed the
[1:01:13] world in Sodom and
[1:01:15] gomorra and now and we got all the same
[1:01:19] spiritual evidence laying here before us
[1:01:23] all the same spiritual evidence
[1:01:25] worldwide
[1:01:26] known that brought down the mercies of
[1:01:29] God upon those Generations that also to
[1:01:33] reject brought judgment so if this
[1:01:36] generation has rejected the same Mercy
[1:01:40] that was spurn in them days God would be
[1:01:42] unjust to let them get by without
[1:01:46] judgment and Jack Moore a friend of mine
[1:01:49] once said if this nation gets by without
[1:01:52] a punishment from God then God to be
[1:01:55] obligated to raise up solom Gore and
[1:01:58] apologize for burning him up now we know
[1:02:02] that spiritually they're doing the same
[1:02:04] thing today for they are doing it to for
[1:02:08] the same purpose and in the same way
[1:02:12] that they did in the crucifixion of the
[1:02:14] Lord physically they're doing it because
[1:02:18] of
[1:02:20] jealousy because of spiritual blindness
[1:02:25] that they don't want to see they won't
[1:02:27] listen to it Jesus in his journey here
[1:02:31] on Earth he said well did Isaiah speak
[1:02:34] of you you got eyes and can't see and
[1:02:36] ears and can't
[1:02:37] hear the same reason the same um the
[1:02:41] same purpose and the same reasonings
[1:02:45] they're bringing the crucifixion of
[1:02:47] Christ a new aresh as we'll get to it
[1:02:49] after a while for the same reasons that
[1:02:52] they did then they cannot find nothing
[1:02:55] against it they're Dar to try to
[1:02:58] challenge
[1:03:01] it and they know the evidence is
[1:03:04] there and they know the Bible says so
[1:03:07] and the only thing they can do is
[1:03:08] blaspheme
[1:03:10] it
[1:03:11] exactly so and all this the same reasons
[1:03:16] now upon all this bases I challenge
[1:03:20] thisgeneration
[1:03:21] of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ
[1:03:24] for a crucifying and guilty with dirty
[1:03:28] Wicked selfish
[1:03:30] denominational hands has crucifying the
[1:03:33] Prince of Life that wanted to present
[1:03:35] itself to the
[1:03:37] people you say the same
[1:03:39] person in the beginning was the
[1:03:43] word and the Word was God and the Word
[1:03:47] was made
[1:03:49] flesh and manifested itself the word was
[1:03:52] manifested in flesh and they condemned
[1:03:54] the Flesh and put it to death because
[1:03:57] the word was manifested Hebrews 13:8
[1:04:00] said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:04:02] today and forever it's the same word
[1:04:05] amen and for the same reason they are
[1:04:08] trying to crucify the word now to my
[1:04:11] text to break back upon the subject that
[1:04:14] I'm want to take there the four words
[1:04:17] let's explain there there the most holy
[1:04:22] city in the world
[1:04:25] Jerusalem there the most religious city
[1:04:29] in the

[1:05:17] there the greatest religious City they
[1:05:21] the most religious people crucified the
[1:05:23] most shameful death him the most

[1:05:46] races the people who are supposed to be
[1:05:49] the very worshippers of God they
[1:05:52] gathered at the the greatest holy Feast
[1:05:55] they got the cleansing of the the
[1:05:57] Passover when they was brought from
[1:06:00] bondage into Liberty and there in that
[1:06:03] time they at that time the most
[1:06:07] religious people in the most religious
[1:06:08] feast at the most religious Place
[1:06:11] brought upon the Prince of
[1:06:15] Life the most shameful thing that could
[1:06:18] be done to strip a man and to hang him
[1:06:21] on a tree because cursed is he said the
[1:06:24] law that they worship by cursed is he
[1:06:28] that hangs upon a tree and he was made a
[1:06:30] curse for us stripping his clothes
[1:06:34] beating him and mocking him the very God
[1:06:36] Of Heaven taking his clothes from him
[1:06:39] and nail him to AC cross him there they
[1:06:43] crucified him under
[1:06:45] Roman capital
[1:06:48] punishment the most shameful death today
[1:06:50] would not be shot the most shameful
[1:06:54] death today would not be to be uh uh run
[1:06:58] over by a car and killed drowned by
[1:07:01] water burned by fire but the most
[1:07:03] shameful death today is
[1:07:06] public capital punishment where that the
[1:07:10] whole world condemns you and calls you
[1:07:13] guilty and the whole world put their
[1:07:15] hands upon this man and called him
[1:07:17] guilty when he was
[1:07:19] innocent and he died under the enemies
[1:07:23] not
[1:07:24] his friends not his laws but under the
[1:07:27] enemy's crucifixion the Prince of Life
[1:07:30] the most precious person that there ever
[1:07:33] lived or ever will live Jesus Christ him
[1:07:37] the most precious person keep that in
[1:07:39] mind now as we build that platform
[1:07:41] around today could you
[1:07:44] imagine at a place like Jerusalem where
[1:07:48] for 2500 years or more that the people
[1:07:52] or hundreds of years I maybe a little
[1:07:54] long than that might have been about 8
[1:07:56] or 900 years or something I don't know
[1:07:57] it's how what the distance in time
[1:07:59] Solomon built the temple I imagine about
[1:08:01] 800 years something like that and they'
[1:08:04] look for a coming Messiah they had
[1:08:06] gathered there for the worship of the
[1:08:09] Passover just think of it now the head
[1:08:12] of all of the Pharisees Sadducees and
[1:08:15] what have you one great
[1:08:18] Gathering to worship God Most Holy Place
[1:08:22] Jerusalem the Temple of the Lord and the
[1:08:27] people of the Lord took the Lord himself
[1:08:31] and crucified
[1:08:33] him with capital
[1:08:36] punishment such a thing now then four
[1:08:39] words they there they crucified him now
[1:08:44] you so so the Bible you see it's just
[1:08:46] four words but the Bible condenses its
[1:08:50] truths now me I have to go way around
[1:08:53] and explain what I'm talking about but
[1:08:54] the Bible don't have to explain
[1:08:56] nothing it just it's all truth so the
[1:09:01] the the Bible don't have to explain
[1:09:03] anything it it it doesn't have to
[1:09:05] explain it because it is all the truth
[1:09:08] here is four words of its great chain of
[1:09:12] Truth I'll try to explain it and to try
[1:09:16] to explain it clearly would make a
[1:09:19] library there's no way for me to explain
[1:09:21] those four words
[1:09:24] but now let us by the help of him who
[1:09:27] caused it to be written try to explain
[1:09:30] these four words to bring it in such a
[1:09:32] way that people would understand
[1:09:35] it what we got before us now we got the
[1:09:38] first
[1:09:40] crucifixion laying before us at the most
[1:09:43] holy place the most religious people the
[1:09:48] most shameful death to the most precious
[1:09:51] person oh it's such a cont contradictory
[1:09:55] my my it's
[1:09:57] disgraceful now let's take first the
[1:10:01] first word there let's talk on it a few
[1:10:03] minutes before we bring the indictment
[1:10:04] we'll break this down and show you what
[1:10:06] they was doing then we'll find out if my
[1:10:08] indictment is correct or not there
[1:10:11] Jerusalem Most Holy simple place because
[1:10:14] the temple was there the most holy place
[1:10:17] because it the temple was there and Jews
[1:10:20] from all over the world gathered to this
[1:10:23] one place
[1:10:24] of meeting grounds uh for worship the
[1:10:28] most greatest place for worship that
[1:10:31] there was was at Jerusalem the temple
[1:10:34] was there it's it's written all men
[1:10:37] ought to worship at
[1:10:39] Jerusalem all right because it's a
[1:10:42] center of
[1:10:43] worship and today you hear them one of
[1:10:46] them wants to say they all we come to
[1:10:49] these great conventions where these uh
[1:10:51] denominations have it and and then we we
[1:10:53] have the the opening of the the Vatican
[1:10:57] City and and these ordinations of popes
[1:10:59] and so forth everybody says we all ought
[1:11:03] to go to the campgrounds of the
[1:11:05] Methodist or the the Bible Baptist
[1:11:08] convention or are we all art to go to to
[1:11:11] Rome and there were the Great Center
[1:11:15] they call of
[1:11:16] Christianity during the time of the last
[1:11:19] war when Rome fell these German soldiers
[1:11:22] many of you boys know about this them
[1:11:25] German soldiers got back up into the
[1:11:27] Vatican City there and firing out at the
[1:11:31] Americans as they were advancing brother
[1:11:33] Funk and brother Roberson and many
[1:11:36] brother beer and many of those Brethren
[1:11:38] who was in that war knows and you know
[1:11:41] what we issued orders that they could
[1:11:44] not fire on that
[1:11:47] City Americans you stood there and you
[1:11:50] was a Target to them but at the West uh
[1:11:55] the West Minister uh Abbey at the in
[1:11:58] England you could fire on that all right
[1:12:01] that's where the Protestants gathered so
[1:12:03] it was all right to fire on that but not
[1:12:05] to fire on the Vatican because as
[1:12:08] president uh Roosevelt I heard his
[1:12:11] speech when he when he broadcast it that
[1:12:14] night called the Fireside talk he said
[1:12:16] when Rome fa he said it's such a shame
[1:12:19] because Rome is the head of all
[1:12:23] Christian ity could you imagine a
[1:12:25] Protestant saying that so the great
[1:12:29] Center of Christian religion well we're
[1:12:32] going to we're going to place that like
[1:12:34] Jerusalem if you wish to if you'd like
[1:12:37] to do that let's put that at Jerusalem
[1:12:40] the head of all these other the the the
[1:12:43] sanadrin and and of the Pharisees and of
[1:12:46] the the Sadducees all of them went up to
[1:12:48] Jerusalem that was really the
[1:12:50] headquarters and in the organizational
[1:12:52] life you you've got to admit that Roman
[1:12:55] Catholic Church is a mother of all of it
[1:12:57] she sure is and it started from
[1:13:00] Pentecost that's where they got to when
[1:13:02] they organized now we the Protestants
[1:13:05] are just little sisters off of that
[1:13:08] church and now let's say it would be
[1:13:11] there at the Vatican today or there at
[1:13:15] Jerusalem as it was at that day when all
[1:13:18] men ought to come to Jerusalem work
[1:13:20] worship why did they do it in the days
[1:13:22] of Jesus why did they say all man should
[1:13:26] worship at Jerusalem for there's only
[1:13:28] one place that God will fellowship with
[1:13:31] man that is under the blood of the
[1:13:34] sacrifice that's the reason they had to
[1:13:35] come to Jerusalem God will never meet
[1:13:38] with man nowh else but under the
[1:13:40] blood when you turn the blood down then
[1:13:44] your meeting place with God has been
[1:13:46] taken away God made his first decision
[1:13:49] in the Garden of Eden that man would
[1:13:52] only worship him under the shed blood of
[1:13:55] the sacrifice and that's the only place
[1:13:57] that God met with man then and that's
[1:13:59] the only place that God ever did meet
[1:14:01] with man and that's the only place he
[1:14:02] meets with man today is under the shed
[1:14:04] blood of the sacrifice see I don't care
[1:14:07] if you're a Methodist Baptist
[1:14:08] Presbyterian if you can forget your
[1:14:10] differences Roman catholic whatever you
[1:14:12] might be and will come under the shed
[1:14:14] blood God will meet with both of us
[1:14:17] there that's where we can all meet and
[1:14:19] fellowship on the same ground but
[1:14:21] otherwise he will not meet just because
[1:14:23] you're a Methodist he'll not meet just
[1:14:25] because you're Pentecostals he'll meet
[1:14:27] with you under one condition that's
[1:14:28] under the shed blood when your sins has
[1:14:31] been confessed and expelled in his
[1:14:33] presence then by the blood and the blood
[1:14:35] is always before him and therefore he
[1:14:37] only can see you through that shed blood
[1:14:40] and you're white as snow when you've
[1:14:43] confessed your sins otherwise you're not
[1:14:45] there you cannot Fellowship that's the
[1:14:47] reason that you don't see things
[1:14:48] happening in the churches they confess
[1:14:50] that they believe the blood but they
[1:14:52] reject the very plan to get to the blood
[1:14:55] the
[1:14:57] word there's only one way God will honor
[1:14:59] that word you'll never honor that word
[1:15:01] come and say I'm a Roman Catholic I
[1:15:03] demand this to be done you can't do it
[1:15:05] Methodist Baptists are Pentecostals you
[1:15:07] can't do it the only way you can do it
[1:15:09] is under the mercies of God through his
[1:15:11] grace is to come through the shed blood
[1:15:13] of Jesus Christ say Lord I claim the
[1:15:15] promise then if you really are under
[1:15:18] that blood God's obligated to that word
[1:15:22] hallelujah But first you you got to be
[1:15:23] under that blood amen you see it now no
[1:15:27] wonder they can't believe in miracles no
[1:15:30] wonder you can't believe in the
[1:15:31] Supernatural no wonder they condemn it
[1:15:34] the same reason they condemned it back
[1:15:36] there is the same reason they condemn it
[1:15:38] today they're guilty as guilty can be
[1:15:41] because only under the shed blood and
[1:15:45] those who are dare some little brother
[1:15:47] who dares under humility to take God at
[1:15:50] his word and walk out there and confess
[1:15:52] his sins and and forget all these dogmas
[1:15:54] and things and stand there under the
[1:15:57] blood and believe it then they want to
[1:15:59] call him a
[1:16:01] fanatic they want to class him as we
[1:16:03] said it it's not a good word to use at
[1:16:05] the pulpit but so that you'll understand
[1:16:08] he's a
[1:16:10] Oddball after all aren't we all
[1:16:13] oddballs see the believer is an oddball
[1:16:15] to the unbeliever and the unbeliever is
[1:16:17] an oddball to the believer so who is the
[1:16:20] Oddball the farmer is an oddball to the
[1:16:22] business man the businessman's an
[1:16:24] oddball to the farmer see so who is he
[1:16:28] anyhow I tell you salvation is an
[1:16:31] individual affair with man and God Alone
[1:16:34] one
[1:16:35] individual searching out our own
[1:16:37] salvation with fear and trembling and I
[1:16:40] know no other basis as a teacher this
[1:16:43] morning or as a minister from Christ
[1:16:45] than to lay it down upon the
[1:16:47] word I cannot place it on anything else
[1:16:51] now we find there then that only under
[1:16:55] the blood the god met the worshippers so
[1:16:57] they met at Jerusalem and Christ is
[1:17:01] God's provided lamb of
[1:17:03] sacrifice and today there's only one
[1:17:06] place that God will meet man and that's
[1:17:08] under the blood of Jesus
[1:17:11] Christ anywhere else it is condemned God
[1:17:14] will never hear it you might do all kind
[1:17:17] of emotions and all kind of isms and
[1:17:20] shake and jump and have blood and fire
[1:17:22] and smoke and everything else but as
[1:17:24] long as that life isn't compared with
[1:17:26] the word and God thoroughly identifying
[1:17:29] that life then there's no need of trying
[1:17:31] it because you're out and God will never
[1:17:33] meet it till it comes under the care of
[1:17:35] that
[1:17:36] blood that's right so you see in the
[1:17:39] scripture we've got a Jerusalem the
[1:17:41] church has it's in heaven a Heavenly
[1:17:45] Jerusalem where God is God and today
[1:17:49] it's not under some Creed or something
[1:17:51] that we try to make make it of Jerusalem
[1:17:54] we'd like the methodists like to like to
[1:17:56] make the the Methodist headquarters of
[1:17:58] Jerusalem the Catholic like to make Rome
[1:18:00] and and the different places where we
[1:18:02] have our headquarters we like to make
[1:18:03] that a Jerusalem but the Bible says that
[1:18:05] our Jerusalem is from above which is
[1:18:08] mother of all the Believers now and
[1:18:12] Christ is God's provided lamb notice how
[1:18:15] appropriate it was now showing it that
[1:18:17] Jerusalem had was
[1:18:19] ceasing when it was in effect
[1:18:25] until that
[1:18:27] hour the blood of the Lamb was all right
[1:18:31] until that
[1:18:33] day but now at the crucifixion it
[1:18:38] changes the old system is
[1:18:41] done there was a new one and the the
[1:18:44] lamb was at the
[1:18:47] sacrifice the lamb the sacrificial lamb
[1:18:50] was on the
[1:18:51] grounds that they were condemning and
[1:18:54] doing the very thing there that they had
[1:18:56] to
[1:18:57] do it's
[1:18:59] right God be blessed for seeing this
[1:19:03] wonderful Heavenly light in this last
[1:19:06] day because the churches is doing the
[1:19:08] same thing
[1:19:10] today until the hour that organization
[1:19:13] religion is condemned and proved to be
[1:19:16] sacrificing Christ
[1:19:19] word and then on comes the word and the
[1:19:23] word only from the old Pascal lamb
[1:19:25] passed away and Christ become our lamb
[1:19:28] at the day of the
[1:19:29] crucifixion and the day that the
[1:19:32] denomination crucified the word of God
[1:19:36] and accepted a Creed in the Ste of the
[1:19:38] word that's the day the word come into
[1:19:40] full
[1:19:43] effect that's just been
[1:19:45] recently notice secondly first there
[1:19:51] Jerusalem secondly they they who the
[1:19:55] Jews the
[1:19:57] worshippers think of it the worshippers
[1:20:00] themselves was killing the very one they
[1:20:03] they claimed to be
[1:20:06] worshiping could you imagine such a
[1:20:09] thing as intelligent man that were
[1:20:13] priest that were trained that had
[1:20:17] doctor's degree till it probably there
[1:20:20] they had to come out of a certain
[1:20:21] generation before they or tribe before
[1:20:24] they could even be a priest they had to
[1:20:26] be Levites their fathers as priests
[1:20:28] their grandfathers as priests their
[1:20:30] great great great great great
[1:20:31] grandfathers is
[1:20:32] priest and they had to live such a
[1:20:34] consecrated
[1:20:36] life the one IOD against them they'd be
[1:20:39] stoned no mercy was
[1:20:42] granted holy certainly
[1:20:46] but self-made
[1:20:49] Holiness had to act like that to show
[1:20:52] their face for their Church inside of
[1:20:54] them Jesus said you're full of Dead
[1:20:56] Man's
[1:21:00] Bones how I could bring an indictment
[1:21:02] right
[1:21:03] there man who know that to be the truth
[1:21:06] this word to be the truth and will
[1:21:08] compromise on it to show a face before
[1:21:10] some
[1:21:13] organization I have a right to indict
[1:21:15] him right upon God's
[1:21:19] word notice they the
[1:21:23] worshippers the man who had looked for
[1:21:26] the
[1:21:27] promise the man who had looked for it to
[1:21:30] years and ages and with nothing to do
[1:21:32] but in that constant
[1:21:35] Seminary but they had divided the word
[1:21:38] according to the teaching of the
[1:21:39] Seminary and they had missed the very
[1:21:42] truth of
[1:21:43] it
[1:21:46] they the priest the ministry of that day
[1:21:53] there at their headquarters they the
[1:21:57] ministry of that day was killing the
[1:21:59] very God the very
[1:22:03] lamb the very one that they claim they
[1:22:07] were worshiping they were killing and
[1:22:10] today I indict this bunch of ordained
[1:22:13] ministers in their Creeds and
[1:22:15] denominations they're crucifying to the
[1:22:18] people the very God that they claim that
[1:22:21] they love and serve amen
[1:22:28] amen I indict these
[1:22:32] ministers in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:22:35] upon their doctrine that claim that the
[1:22:39] days of Miracles is passed and the water
[1:22:42] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ is
[1:22:44] not sufficient and not right upon any of
[1:22:47] these words that they have substituted
[1:22:49] Creeds for I indite them as GI guilty in
[1:22:53] the blood of Jesus Christ upon their
[1:22:56] hands are crucifying aresh the Lord
[1:22:59] Jesus the second
[1:23:01] time they are crucifying Christ to the
[1:23:07] public taking from them the thing that
[1:23:10] they're supposed to be given to them and
[1:23:12] they substituted something else in its
[1:23:13] place
[1:23:15] amen a church Creed for
[1:23:18] popularity there
[1:23:20] they they the one who ought to have know
[1:23:23] better if anybody should have know
[1:23:26] better it should have been their
[1:23:27] ministers if anybody should know better
[1:23:30] it should be the clergy of this day if
[1:23:33] anybody ought to know the the the
[1:23:36] Bishops and archbishops and and
[1:23:38] ministers and doctors of divinity are to
[1:23:41] no
[1:23:42] different but why can't
[1:23:47] they what a
[1:23:50] contradiction what have we got before
[1:23:52] but a a
[1:23:54] contradiction they claim that they
[1:23:56] worship God and they're killing the
[1:23:58] Prince of
[1:24:01] Life they there they crucified him and
[1:24:05] here they again do the same thing for he
[1:24:09] is the
[1:24:10] word that's what is only a reflection of
[1:24:13] the word and that's what he is today a
[1:24:16] reflection of the
[1:24:18] word trying to find somebody to reflect
[1:24:21] himself through
[1:24:23] and these people
[1:24:25] keep the congregation away from
[1:24:30] God and and if there anything happens
[1:24:33] and is spoke of in the congregation they
[1:24:35] condemn it from the platform from the
[1:24:37] pull pit and say it's fanaticism stay
[1:24:40] away from it and doing so they crucified
[1:24:44] Jesus Christ in
[1:24:47] 1963 and are just as guilty as those
[1:24:49] guys at the that day that's an awful
[1:24:52] statement but it's the
[1:24:55] truth upon that's exactly what they do
[1:24:58] today and upon this grounds upon the
[1:25:01] grounds of crucifying Christ upon the
[1:25:05] grounds of taking the word and taking it
[1:25:07] away from the people is exactly what
[1:25:09] they were doing there the very word that
[1:25:11] God was reflecting through his own son
[1:25:13] to prove it was and the one that they
[1:25:15] claimed that they love the Jehovah that
[1:25:17] had manifested himself by the scriptures
[1:25:19] done exactly what he said he would do
[1:25:22] exactly what God said he would do and
[1:25:25] reflected it before because the love of
[1:25:27] their Church groups and things like that
[1:25:29] they condemn the Prince of
[1:25:34] Life and I condemn the same group today
[1:25:39] and indict them as guilty before the God
[1:25:41] by the word of God that they're doing
[1:25:44] the same
[1:25:46] thing this generation is
[1:25:50] indicted remember he Hebrews 138 he's
[1:25:53] the same yesterday today and
[1:25:55] forever how did they indict him because
[1:25:57] that their Creeds would not accept him
[1:26:00] and down in their heart they know
[1:26:03] different didn't not Nicodemus in the
[1:26:05] third chapter St John well express it
[1:26:07] Rabbi we the Pharisees the preachers the
[1:26:10] teachers we know you're a teacher sent
[1:26:12] from God for no man could do the things
[1:26:15] that you do unless God was with
[1:26:17] him they publicly witnessed it by one of
[1:26:20] their renowned man and to because of
[1:26:24] their Creeds they crucified Christ and
[1:26:27] today there's not a reader that cannot
[1:26:29] read acts 238 is same as I can read it
[1:26:31] and the rest of it is the same as I can
[1:26:33] read it but because of their Creeds and
[1:26:36] because of their denominational tickets
[1:26:38] that they got in their pocket the marks
[1:26:40] of the Beast that they're packing around
[1:26:42] as Fellowship cards and taking those
[1:26:44] things they crucified to themselves
[1:26:47] Jesus Christ the fresh and crucify him
[1:26:49] before the public and blaspheme the very
[1:26:51] God that promised to do
[1:26:54] this bringing damnation upon the
[1:26:59] race there there
[1:27:01] they not the sinner
[1:27:05] they that is the Church of that
[1:27:09] day they found fault with the man who
[1:27:13] was the
[1:27:15] word is that right they found fault with
[1:27:19] the man who was the word now they find
[1:27:22] fault with the word working through the
[1:27:27] man they just Vice ver Versa which is in
[1:27:30] the person that's the holy spirit is
[1:27:32] working through is God's Vindication how
[1:27:35] do they know he was Christ because his
[1:27:37] Works prove what he
[1:27:39] was he said which one of you can condemn
[1:27:41] me of sin if I haven't done just exactly
[1:27:44] what the scriptures said I would do and
[1:27:46] which somebody tell me where I fail
[1:27:48] somewhere if I hav showed every sign of
[1:27:50] that I am the Messiah that I'm the very
[1:27:52] one that you promis said they said well
[1:27:54] we have Moses We Believe Moses said if
[1:27:57] you would have believed Moses you'd
[1:27:58] believe me if you Moses seen my day and
[1:28:02] desired to to live in this day Moses
[1:28:05] seen a far off in the prophets and here
[1:28:07] you are living right by and can said you
[1:28:09] Hypocrites said you can discern the face
[1:28:11] of the Skies but the sign of the time
[1:28:13] you can't discern
[1:28:15] amen there it is a sign of the time what
[1:28:18] did he class him a
[1:28:20] fanatic a crazy man yeah they found
[1:28:23] fault with the man who was the word he
[1:28:26] was the word St John first chapter
[1:28:28] proves it in the beginning was the word
[1:28:30] and the word is with God and the Word
[1:28:32] was made flesh and dwelt among us he was
[1:28:36] the Living Word of God because he was
[1:28:39] expressing God through himself he was so
[1:28:42] completely to surrender to the to the
[1:28:44] word of God to he and the Word was the
[1:28:46] same and that's exactly what the church
[1:28:48] ought to be today that the word of God
[1:28:51] is the same how can can you be part of
[1:28:52] that word when you deny practically all
[1:28:54] of it and the reason it's none is not
[1:28:57] because the people that's the reason I
[1:28:59] think God spoke to me about calling his
[1:29:01] people the Ricks and ricettas it's
[1:29:03] because of these selfish denominations
[1:29:06] has got those people living out there in
[1:29:07] the way they're living They Crucified
[1:29:09] the truth and the people call it a
[1:29:11] blasphemy and they make it blasphemy
[1:29:13] rather they call it fanaticism and so
[1:29:15] forth and not knowing that they're
[1:29:16] blaspheming the very God that they go to
[1:29:18] church to
[1:29:19] serve therefore I indict this bunch of
[1:29:22] clergy today andite this generation in
[1:29:25] the name of Jesus Christ under the
[1:29:27] authority of God's word you are
[1:29:29] crucifying him
[1:29:32] again
[1:29:34] notice he's the same yesterday today and
[1:29:36] forever God's word of Vindicated in a
[1:29:40] man compare the two calvaries and their
[1:29:45] acquisation remember because he made
[1:29:48] himself
[1:29:50] God we will not have this man rule over
[1:29:52] us what was the acquisation that they
[1:29:55] could find in the council that morning
[1:29:57] uh when crucified Jesus that he made
[1:30:00] himself God he was
[1:30:03] God and he broke the Sabbath and he was
[1:30:06] the lord of the
[1:30:07] Sabbath they condemned him because that
[1:30:10] he made himself
[1:30:12] God you have no right to do this you
[1:30:15] have no right our high priest if
[1:30:16] anything is coming come through our
[1:30:18] priest now compare that with the calvary
[1:30:21] today
[1:30:22] when God had so pleased the father God
[1:30:26] the spirit to raise up his own son
[1:30:30] overshadowed the Mary by the Holy Spirit
[1:30:33] and brought forth a body that could
[1:30:35] serve him and serve his purpose to he
[1:30:38] the God was in Christ the fullness of
[1:30:40] the godhead bodily in him reflecting
[1:30:42] what God was to the people letting the
[1:30:45] letting the whole world know what God
[1:30:47] wanted each individual to be a son and
[1:30:49] daughter he took one man and did did it
[1:30:52] and because that he didn't jar with
[1:30:54] their organizational ranks they
[1:30:56] condemned him and crucified him now
[1:30:59] compare that Calvary with the
[1:31:03] day because of organizational Prejudice
[1:31:08] yes because of indifference between
[1:31:11] Scholars who ought to know God's word
[1:31:14] and plan because of this God can take a
[1:31:18] little group of people that he can work
[1:31:20] through somewhere and reflect self who
[1:31:22] will humble themselves to the word and
[1:31:24] they cannot say it isn't
[1:31:26] so they could not say he didn't do it
[1:31:30] for their congregation was witness of it
[1:31:33] it was before them they couldn't deny it
[1:31:37] they couldn't deny his claims because
[1:31:40] the very word that they said they
[1:31:42] believe was the one who proved that he
[1:31:46] was because God took the word that was
[1:31:48] supposed to be the Messiah and show it
[1:31:50] to a man and had to get rid of
[1:31:53] him so the only way they could go on was
[1:31:55] get rid of the
[1:31:57] Messiah and they did it to blindness and
[1:32:02] ignorance regardless of their education
[1:32:05] they were smart intelligent worldly
[1:32:08] speaking as we compared the other night
[1:32:10] when the light struck the rich rung
[1:32:12] ruler look what he did he rejected a
[1:32:15] smart man Paul another smart man the
[1:32:18] light struck him what he do he accepted
[1:32:20] it he forgot all he ever know that he
[1:32:24] might know Christ that made his life
[1:32:26] worthy of the Gospel last Sunday night's
[1:32:30] message there it is today it strikes
[1:32:33] maybe some little a man has went off had
[1:32:35] a call of God he felt went to some
[1:32:37] Seminary and learn some Creed he must
[1:32:39] live by that Creed or give up his
[1:32:41] Fellowship card if he does he's black
[1:32:44] marked nobody else will have him because
[1:32:46] once he belonged to something else and
[1:32:48] now he don't belong to it they figure
[1:32:50] there's something wrong with that that
[1:32:52] man and they will not have him in their
[1:32:54] congregation when the congregation are
[1:32:56] only looking for one sign that is if he
[1:32:59] believes what they believe if he's got a
[1:33:01] card if he's a Methodist if he's a card
[1:33:03] he belongs to another fellowship or
[1:33:05] Oneness or trinitarian or whatever it
[1:33:07] might be Church of God or in the
[1:33:09] Pentecostal ranks all those ranks if he
[1:33:12] packs a card they feel that the
[1:33:13] headquarters has uh looked him over and
[1:33:16] tested his mind and give him a
[1:33:18] psychiatrist test and see if his IQ was
[1:33:20] high enough and he can speak before him
[1:33:22] if you don't they turn him down that's
[1:33:25] right but you see the congregation ought
[1:33:28] to be watching the hand of the Lord see
[1:33:31] whether God's giving his ordination or
[1:33:32] not that's what we ought to be looking
[1:33:34] at Hallelujah but today they crucify the
[1:33:37] the the Son of God aresh when a man is
[1:33:40] Able by the grace of God be called of
[1:33:42] God to let God reflect himself through
[1:33:44] him the works that I do shall you do
[1:33:47] also he said
[1:33:49] notice what a day that we're living
[1:33:52] they they take they they take the the
[1:33:55] very Calvary we can this morning and the
[1:33:58] very reason now they know that was truth
[1:34:01] but because of jealousy Prejudice what
[1:34:04] did Jesus say to them if I cast out
[1:34:06] Devils by the Finger of God then who who
[1:34:09] do you cast them out by let them be your
[1:34:11] judge if I by the Finger of God cast out
[1:34:15] Devils now it's like you heard him say
[1:34:16] can you prove it's a finger of God I'd
[1:34:18] like to I'd like to heard that question
[1:34:20] asked they were too small for
[1:34:25] that notice because that he made himself
[1:34:29] God and he was
[1:34:31] God and we will not have him rule over
[1:34:33] us but now the thing the same old cry
[1:34:37] comes
[1:34:38] again that Bible was written by man they
[1:34:41] say we don't have to live by that that's
[1:34:44] God's that's God's word it's God
[1:34:49] himself I talking to man yes I said well
[1:34:52] some man might have wrote that Bible I
[1:34:54] said yes it was his name we know him as
[1:34:56] God it was Wroten 4,000 years apart
[1:35:00] almost the scriptures back from Job all
[1:35:04] the way to the New Testament and wrote
[1:35:06] by hundred by by and hundreds of years
[1:35:09] apart and was wrote by different man and
[1:35:11] them not knowing the other and different
[1:35:13] parts of the country and not one word of
[1:35:15] it will condemn the
[1:35:17] other right I dare anybody to come under
[1:35:20] the blood of Jesus Christ and claim any
[1:35:22] promise in there God's obligated to take
[1:35:26] care of it but they won't do it they'll
[1:35:28] come say oh Lord I want to do something
[1:35:30] give me a great gift Hallelujah Lord
[1:35:32] glory to God I believe I got it
[1:35:33] Hallelujah it'll never
[1:35:35] work you might bring forth a lot of
[1:35:37] psychology but it won't
[1:35:39] work God's got to recognize that
[1:35:41] repentance God's got to do
[1:35:45] that we could say a lot along that line
[1:35:47] but I hope you're you're understanding
[1:35:50] look but now now they won't have the
[1:35:52] word rule over them I say every one of
[1:35:55] you return back you're baptized wrong
[1:35:57] you're baptized in the Catholic Church
[1:35:59] who are you to tell us that it's not me
[1:36:01] it's a
[1:36:02] word well I tell you we we believe I
[1:36:04] don't care what you believe it's what
[1:36:05] the Bible says well we don't have to
[1:36:07] live by that you do not or you're under
[1:36:10] the Judgment of this Bible for whosoever
[1:36:12] shall take one word out of it or add one
[1:36:13] to it the same will be Tak out of the
[1:36:15] part of The Book of Life Let It Be
[1:36:17] Minister clergyman whoever he is you've
[1:36:20] got to come under the rulership of this
[1:36:21] word for it is God the Bible says it's
[1:36:25] God we won't have it rule over us they
[1:36:28] take their Creeds and the nominations
[1:36:31] and their little petty things that they
[1:36:33] believe in has been adopted by councils
[1:36:35] of man and take it instead of God's word
[1:36:38] what did they do they tuck a
[1:36:41] Barabas a murder instead of the Son of
[1:36:44] God at the day of the first crucifixion
[1:36:46] and today they're taking some man's word
[1:36:49] which is a lie in the way of death in
[1:36:52] refusing to take the way of life God's
[1:36:54] word I condemn this generation and died
[1:36:57] in the word of the Lord that they're
[1:36:59] wrong they're guilty of crucifixion or
[1:37:02] trying to Hallelujah crucify the spirit
[1:37:06] they call for a Revival everywhere how
[1:37:09] you going to have a Revival when the
[1:37:11] word itself can't work to the
[1:37:13] people I'd like for somebody to answer
[1:37:15] that for me how can it do when you deny
[1:37:18] the very Revival itself amen
[1:37:22] well did the prophet speak of
[1:37:24] them forms of godliness their own forms
[1:37:27] back there denied the Word of Life their
[1:37:30] own Farms today deny the thing that can
[1:37:32] bring them a
[1:37:34] Revival their Creeds and
[1:37:37] Farms yes sir they take the denomination
[1:37:40] and their Creeds instead of the the
[1:37:45] word and that crucifies his word and
[1:37:49] makes his word of no effect to the
[1:37:50] people
[1:37:52] when they see the word of God so vividly
[1:37:55] in just Place
[1:37:58] itself that God made a promise he would
[1:38:00] do this and here he is doing it and they
[1:38:03] make fun of
[1:38:05] it and get away from it it's
[1:38:09] blasphemy and they try to crucify the
[1:38:11] word itself how do they crucify it they
[1:38:14] can't crucify the word no more they
[1:38:15] could crucify God they could crucify the
[1:38:18] body that help God the Son of God they
[1:38:21] could crucify that but they can't
[1:38:22] crucify God he had to be that time on
[1:38:24] account of being the sacrifice to bring
[1:38:26] in many sons that's predestinated to
[1:38:29] eternal life they had to do it then but
[1:38:32] they can't do it now they can't do it
[1:38:34] for the word itself will live on but
[1:38:37] they what do they do how do they form
[1:38:39] what are you saying that preacher how
[1:38:40] you building your platform here that
[1:38:42] they crucifying there they are
[1:38:43] crucifying the effects of the Gospel
[1:38:46] upon the people by their Creeds amen
[1:38:50] that's a crucifixion
[1:38:51] that were the public set these big
[1:38:54] margs called churches denominations and
[1:38:58] draw a line of
[1:39:00] creed and that had the word of God can't
[1:39:03] have an effect upon it because they they
[1:39:06] condemn the very things that Christ said
[1:39:08] would take place it just don't come
[1:39:10] according to their Creed and neither did
[1:39:12] Jesus come according to their
[1:39:14] understanding of him coming he coming
[1:39:16] the way that God sent him and he come
[1:39:18] exactly with the word no he said he hid
[1:39:21] it from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[1:39:23] and reveal it the baby such as would
[1:39:25] learn Hallelujah do you
[1:39:28] understand oh they have crucified the
[1:39:32] effects of the word I got a bunch of
[1:39:33] scriptures here I might just quote to a
[1:39:35] three of them they crucified you say how
[1:39:36] do they crucify the word when Jesus said
[1:39:40] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:39:42] forever Hebrews 13:8 they say in such a
[1:39:44] way he
[1:39:46] is all right and the Jesus said his last
[1:39:49] commandment to the church go go ye into
[1:39:51] all the World Mark 16 go ye into all the
[1:39:53] world and preach the gospel these signs
[1:39:56] shall follow them that believe all the
[1:39:58] world to Every Creature it ain't half
[1:40:01] reached yet and his millions die every
[1:40:03] year that don't ever even heard the name
[1:40:05] of Jesus so it's still the general
[1:40:07] orders it's still the Commandment of God
[1:40:11] all the world and preach the gospel to
[1:40:12] Every Creature he that believeth in his
[1:40:14] baptized shall be saved he that
[1:40:15] believeth not shall be damned and these
[1:40:17] signs shall follow them that believe in
[1:40:20] my name they shall cast out Devils they
[1:40:22] shall speak with new tongues if they
[1:40:24] take up serpents or drink deadly things
[1:40:26] it shall not harm them if they lay their
[1:40:28] hands on the sick they shall
[1:40:30] recover and they say that was for that
[1:40:33] generation and they make the Commandment
[1:40:35] of God of not effect to this and they
[1:40:38] crucify the effect of the word to the
[1:40:42] people
[1:40:44] amen Peter said on the day of Pentecost
[1:40:47] with the keys to the kingdom that Jesus
[1:40:49] had just given him whatever you you say
[1:40:51] here I'll say it up there and on the day
[1:40:53] of Pentecost they asked what they might
[1:40:56] do to receive the Holy Spirit if they
[1:40:58] was so enjoying it watching others
[1:41:01] acting uh what they would call uh silly
[1:41:04] stagger and jump and fall and AC like
[1:41:07] they were
[1:41:07] drunk and they said these men are full
[1:41:10] of new
[1:41:11] wine but there was a man stood up by the
[1:41:13] name of Peter who had the keys to the
[1:41:16] kingdom and said these are not drunken
[1:41:18] acts two as you suppose since the third
[1:41:21] out of the day but this is that which is
[1:41:23] spoken of see right back to the word
[1:41:26] again showing that the spirit is still
[1:41:28] word the word is still Spirit yes the
[1:41:31] word of God and it shall come spoken by
[1:41:33] the prophet Joel Joel 238 and it shall
[1:41:36] come to pass in the last days sayith God
[1:41:38] I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[1:41:41] listen to that Prophet standing there
[1:41:43] look at him
[1:41:45] Fearless standing there upon that bunch
[1:41:48] and condemning
[1:41:49] them indict
[1:41:52] them said this is the scripture this is
[1:41:56] that that was spoke of by the prophet
[1:41:57] I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[1:42:00] your sons and daughters shall prophesy
[1:42:02] all my hands maids and Maid servant I
[1:42:04] pour out of my spirit I'll show signs in
[1:42:06] the heavens above and on Earth fire and
[1:42:07] pillars of smoke and
[1:42:09] Vapor proven it by the word that it was
[1:42:12] the word and they laughed and made fun
[1:42:15] of it and they went to judgment and the
[1:42:17] city was burnt and they eat one
[1:42:19] another's children and today there
[1:42:20] scattered people throughout all the
[1:42:24] world showing the Holy Spirit Still
[1:42:27] Remains the word of God to bring this
[1:42:29] word to make it live Jesus Christ was
[1:42:31] the person man
[1:42:33] God hallelujah
[1:42:36] amen he was the manifestation of God he
[1:42:40] was God in a body form to reflect the
[1:42:44] word of God for that age to make that
[1:42:47] age see God's promise for that age and
[1:42:50] the Holy Ghost ghost is the same thing
[1:42:51] today it's the spirit of God upon the
[1:42:54] written word trying to find somebody to
[1:42:56] reflect itself to this
[1:42:59] age to prove that he's the same
[1:43:01] yesterday ver St John 14:12 The Works
[1:43:03] that I do shall you also Jesus Christ is
[1:43:06] the same yesterday and forever see
[1:43:09] constantly trying to find its way to
[1:43:10] reflect itself and they could not do it
[1:43:13] the people thought so much of their
[1:43:14] denominations their little Nest that
[1:43:16] they had and so forth call their
[1:43:17] churches so they wouldn't listen to it
[1:43:20] so do the do it today same thing crucify
[1:43:23] aresh Peter on the day of Pentecost he
[1:43:26] said you men that dwell in
[1:43:28] Jerusalem in
[1:43:30] Judea hearken to my words these are not
[1:43:33] drunk if you'll stand still I'll show
[1:43:36] you what it
[1:43:37] is and he goes ahead and explains to
[1:43:39] them well their hearts is pricked when
[1:43:41] they heard this so what can we do to be
[1:43:44] saved what can we do to receive this
[1:43:47] we're convinced that your word is right
[1:43:50] he said repent every one of you and be
[1:43:52] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:43:54] the remission of your sins and you shall
[1:43:56] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[1:43:58] this is to you and your children them as
[1:44:00] far off even as many as the Lord Our God
[1:44:01] shall call this is what they got to do
[1:44:04] repent be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:44:06] Christ and today the Roman Catholic
[1:44:09] Church adopted father son Holy Ghost to
[1:44:12] take that place instead of that a
[1:44:13] communion lick out a tongue and take a
[1:44:15] wafer and the priest drink the wine and
[1:44:17] you're one together the communion
[1:44:19] instead of being the Holy Ghost called
[1:44:21] Holy
[1:44:22] Eucharist and a father son Holy Ghost a
[1:44:24] trinitarian baptism was not even spoke
[1:44:26] of in the Bible amen amen the name of
[1:44:29] father son Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus
[1:44:31] Christ and when you show that to this
[1:44:33] honored generation as Peter said save
[1:44:35] yourself from this honor generation when
[1:44:37] you show it to them what do they do make
[1:44:40] fun of it and say our church don't teach
[1:44:42] it that way then you're guilty you're
[1:44:46] guilty of the crucifixion of Jesus
[1:44:49] Christ by taking the power of God away
[1:44:52] from the people you crucify the very
[1:44:54] word to them and you condemn yourself
[1:44:56] with your
[1:44:59] congregation lead him into a death
[1:45:02] trap as I said about that Minister last
[1:45:05] Sunday as Martin Luther King down there
[1:45:07] with them precious people leading right
[1:45:09] into a death trap oh somebody could only
[1:45:12] talk to that man wish I
[1:45:14] could just for an little uprising of a
[1:45:17] school proposition see it's somewh
[1:45:20] different my goodness if the people
[1:45:21] ain't got hard enough to associate with
[1:45:23] a man because of his color they're
[1:45:25] condemned and dead anyhow the nation
[1:45:28] gives right don't fight against it don't
[1:45:30] what if somebody said all the Irish or
[1:45:32] somebody all the German or somebody else
[1:45:33] had to dissociate that would never
[1:45:35] bother Christians that move right on and
[1:45:37] that man's a Christian is is a minister
[1:45:39] he shouldn't lead them people into a
[1:45:41] revolt against that they're going to
[1:45:42] cause Millions to die it'll start
[1:45:44] another revolutionary and it's a shame
[1:45:46] to do that the same thing happens right
[1:45:48] here exactly the same thing again that's
[1:45:51] right see the people how that they'd
[1:45:54] only look at truth and see what truth is
[1:45:57] our church don't believe that we got
[1:45:59] some other way well it ain't the right
[1:46:00] way it ain't the thing he said repent
[1:46:03] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:46:04] Christ for the remission of sins now
[1:46:08] they won't do it oh then what do they do
[1:46:11] now that's just one thing upon hundreds
[1:46:13] we'll get to maybe as fast as we can now
[1:46:17] the second crucifixion then if a man
[1:46:20] accepts Father Son and Holy Spirit a a
[1:46:23] Creed instead of the
[1:46:26] word titles instead of the name what
[1:46:30] does he do to the people he crucifies
[1:46:33] the effects of the word to the people
[1:46:36] when he says that Mark 16 was just for
[1:46:38] that generation and God said himself
[1:46:40] right there Jesus talking to him said go
[1:46:42] ye into all the world and preach the
[1:46:44] gospel to Every
[1:46:46] Creature he that believeth in is
[1:46:48] baptized shall be saved he that
[1:46:49] believeth not shall be damned and these
[1:46:52] signs shall follow
[1:46:54] them how for every nation every Creed
[1:46:57] every tongue every race every people the
[1:47:00] same
[1:47:01] gospel and these signs shall follow them
[1:47:05] that
[1:47:06] believe and when a man tries to cut that
[1:47:09] out of the Bible he crucifies the
[1:47:10] effects of the Gospel to that
[1:47:12] congregation amen hallelujah so I indict
[1:47:16] you in the name of Jesus Christ you're
[1:47:18] guilty of murdering the
[1:47:21] Lord
[1:47:24] hallelujah the church hated him why he
[1:47:28] was their very God they hated him and
[1:47:31] denied
[1:47:33] him to be their Messiah no sir they
[1:47:38] didn't want such a messiah as that and
[1:47:40] today the church does the same thing it
[1:47:44] denies the word they don't want it it's
[1:47:46] contradictory to what they've been
[1:47:48] taught to believe by their Creeds amen
[1:47:50] and the word is the
[1:47:53] Messiah you believe that well the
[1:47:56] reflection of the word then is what amen
[1:47:59] a reflecting a
[1:48:01] messiah which is the Holy Ghost Among Us
[1:48:05] he's reflecting himself try not to where
[1:48:07] he find a lamp that he can look through
[1:48:09] it ain't smoked up with Creeds and
[1:48:11] things he can give light through
[1:48:15] remember they Rose and Trimm their lamps
[1:48:17] and washed out the chimneys but it's too
[1:48:18] late so when a man sees these Lutheran
[1:48:21] Presbyterian methodists trying to come
[1:48:22] in in these last dayses to receive the
[1:48:24] Holy Ghost why you know they don't get
[1:48:26] it that's right oh they might speak in
[1:48:28] tongues and jump up and down but Watch
[1:48:30] What Happens they absolutely it's a Time
[1:48:33] sign that she's
[1:48:35] over we're at the end most any time the
[1:48:38] the church can hear the challenge to
[1:48:40] come on high amen
[1:48:43] amen just exactly setting us in order
[1:48:46] the Holy Spirit here making Jesus Christ
[1:48:48] a reality through the ones that he can
[1:48:50] work to proving himself come down takes
[1:48:52] his picture shows it makes Science Tech
[1:48:54] talk about it everything else proving
[1:48:55] just exactly what he said he would do
[1:48:57] doing exactly the things he said he
[1:48:59] would do scripturally not not some Creed
[1:49:02] or some man's worked up idea a lot of
[1:49:04] blood fire and smoke and stuff but a
[1:49:05] scriptural Messi
[1:49:08] evidence got a lot of impersonations and
[1:49:10] impersonators and and so forth but that
[1:49:12] only makes the real word shine its best
[1:49:15] right that's people who are spiritual
[1:49:17] who can judge between right and wrong
[1:49:19] Lord see denies him denied their Messiah
[1:49:23] we didn't want him the same thing they
[1:49:25] do today well if I had to go down there
[1:49:27] and act like that bunch I don't want it
[1:49:28] at all all right then you don't have it
[1:49:31] at all that's
[1:49:32] all same now although he was properly
[1:49:37] identified they didn't want him they
[1:49:39] hated him why was it we call their
[1:49:42] pastors a bunch of snakes he said you
[1:49:45] bunch of whed walls you're nothing but a
[1:49:47] graveyard the outside of his polish was
[1:49:49] roll and turned around collars and the
[1:49:51] insides Dead Man's
[1:49:54] bom he didn't pull no punches one little
[1:49:57] bitty Galilean a carpenter son but he
[1:50:00] didn't pull no punches he told him don't
[1:50:04] think John said the Forerunner of said
[1:50:06] he's another didn't pull any punches he
[1:50:08] said don't come around here saying now

[1:50:27] proven by the scripture do you hear
[1:50:32] me Jesus was
[1:50:35] identified by God through the scriptures
[1:50:38] that he was
[1:50:42] Messiah is that
[1:50:45] righten we get to Peter's indictment a
[1:50:47] few minutes you'll find out where it was
[1:50:48] WR he was thoroughly
[1:50:51] identified that he was God manifested in
[1:50:55] a man called the Son of God that's
[1:50:58] right although he was properly
[1:51:01] identified and Vindicated the promised
[1:51:04] word that he was
[1:51:06] Messiah Moses said this Messiah when he
[1:51:09] comes he'll be a prophet and all these
[1:51:12] things will take place the little woman
[1:51:14] with the stand at the well and all that
[1:51:17] dirty condition that she was what did
[1:51:19] that symbolize that God in these last
[1:51:21] days would pull out
[1:51:23] Outcast remember last night at the
[1:51:25] wedding or the other time I preached
[1:51:26] here at the wedding supper you s how
[1:51:28] they said I've made a great feast and so
[1:51:31] forth and all these men I bit them and
[1:51:32] each one had an excuse I can't do it

[1:53:32] Bible said he was a is
[1:53:35] offended he said many mighty Works he
[1:53:37] could not do and just turned his back
[1:53:39] and walked away from him he said a
[1:53:41] prophet's not without honor except is
[1:53:42] among his own
[1:53:44] people in his own County watch or in his
[1:53:47] own
[1:53:48] country there he is properly Vindicated
[1:53:51] the Messiah took no credit of his own he
[1:53:54] said I can do nothing but what I see the
[1:53:55] father doing and he challenged them to
[1:53:59] ask that that was the Messiah and look
[1:54:01] at that little old ill Fame woman she
[1:54:03] recognized it she she wasn't document
[1:54:06] the lamp she was morally wrong of course
[1:54:09] no one would endorse that the laws of
[1:54:11] God condemn that she was morally wrong
[1:54:14] but she see God don't judge you uh upon
[1:54:17] your what you are he enjoy he judged not
[1:54:20] how big you are how little you are he
[1:54:21] judges your heart what you want to be
[1:54:25] and she didn't want none of that stuff
[1:54:26] when just flash before that's what she
[1:54:28] wanted Hallelujah no matter what she was
[1:54:30] then she's ready to come
[1:54:33] amen God judges the heart man judges the
[1:54:37] outward appearance God looks upon the
[1:54:39] heart no matter what she was that light
[1:54:41] flash that settled it she caught the the
[1:54:45] the the essence of eternal life oh my
[1:54:49] how Rich this is to me to see and know
[1:54:52] that it's the truth I I'll stand by this
[1:54:54] I let the god of heaven will raise up in
[1:54:57] my voice will be on the Magnetic Tape of
[1:54:59] God's great time H Earth and it'll
[1:55:01] condemn this generation in the last day
[1:55:05] it's on magnetic tape then to be on the
[1:55:07] Eternal tape then try condemn this
[1:55:10] generation of preachers who has a form
[1:55:13] of godliness and denying the power of
[1:55:15] the word and manifestation when it's
[1:55:17] properly identified that he still Jesus
[1:55:19] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:55:22] forever I indict them by the word of God
[1:55:25] I have to get to another promise quickly
[1:55:26] cuz you only got about 15
[1:55:28] minutes there
[1:55:31] they there
[1:55:36] they what
[1:55:39] oh Calvary They Crucified thirdly They
[1:55:43] Crucified him not by recognizing God's
[1:55:49] PR promise word made manifest and why
[1:55:52] did they crucify that man could you just
[1:55:54] imagine let me go back a minute why
[1:55:57] would them people
[1:55:59] crucify a man like
[1:56:02] that as Mary as I read a book one time
[1:56:05] called The Prince of the House of David
[1:56:07] is wrote by Ingram Dr Ingram wonderful
[1:56:09] booket of drama supposed to be partly
[1:56:12] true of some old manuscript is taking
[1:56:14] off of a woman named Adena at her she
[1:56:16] went over to Palestine from from down in
[1:56:19] Egypt
[1:56:20] Cairo I believe it was to finish her
[1:56:22] education she was there during a time of
[1:56:24] of Christ and she's spons right back to
[1:56:26] her father it'd be good if you picked it
[1:56:27] up and read it it's really good uh
[1:56:29] Prince the House of David the same man
[1:56:31] wrote Pillar of Fire and out of that
[1:56:33] Cecil de Mills tuck The Ten Commandments
[1:56:36] now we find it in this book this Adena
[1:56:40] wrote back and she said on the day of
[1:56:41] the crucifixion that Mary magalina Bon
[1:56:44] Hood he cast out Seven Devils run out
[1:56:46] before the crowd and said what has he
[1:56:48] done what what has he
[1:56:50] done only heal the sick and Tred to
[1:56:53] deliver those that were in prisons what
[1:56:56] has he done but good somebody said and a
[1:56:58] man slapped her Plum across a yard
[1:57:00] almost and said would you bed that silly
[1:57:02] woman before your
[1:57:04] priest there you are see what had he
[1:57:08] done done nothing why they
[1:57:10] crucified why why because they didn't
[1:57:14] recognize who he
[1:57:16] was that's the same thing today
[1:57:19] the preachers and people of this days
[1:57:21] and our modern teachers has so
[1:57:41] indocumentadas day sign the churches if
[1:57:43] you don't belong to their organization
[1:57:45] they'll say oh well that's some makeup
[1:57:47] that's that's a hoax we look down here
[1:57:48] so and so and so and so but let them one
[1:57:50] time prove the real thing to be a
[1:57:54] hoax let them one time prove that it's
[1:57:57] wrong they can't do it right it's never
[1:57:59] been known to be wrong and it never will
[1:58:02] be because it's
[1:58:04] God but they like the point they think
[1:58:06] oh well if it was some a man with a
[1:58:08] great name because it's a little group a
[1:58:10] little Bunch it's kind of outcast well
[1:58:12] we turn that person out of our church he
[1:58:15] they they used to come to our group see
[1:58:17] but they went over with this and they
[1:58:18] went over that now they see they want up
[1:58:19] well look what it is who it is I don't
[1:58:21] care they could said the same thing
[1:58:22] about Peter James and John or ignorant
[1:58:24] an unlearned man they said but they had
[1:58:26] to take notice something that happened
[1:58:27] since that time they had been with Jesus
[1:58:30] that's what made the
[1:58:32] difference they did it because they
[1:58:34] didn't know who he was they didn't know
[1:58:36] that the Vindication of God's word
[1:58:38] wasn't standing up there in that day now
[1:58:40] it wasn't one day that was right it
[1:58:43] wasn't one day just keep them laws and
[1:58:45] things but the same laws that was they
[1:58:47] were to keeping pointed them to a time
[1:58:50] that when he would come and be this man
[1:58:52] that he was supposed to be they had this
[1:58:54] part but didn't take the other part and
[1:58:56] that's the same thing they're doing now
[1:58:58] they got a church and they believe in
[1:58:59] Jesus Christ and say they're doing
[1:59:01] things but deny the hour we're living in
[1:59:04] still brings the old proverb back again
[1:59:06] man always praising God for what he has
[1:59:09] done looking forward for what he would
[1:59:10] do and or will do and ignoring what he's
[1:59:13] doing and being condemned by
[1:59:15] amen they think God's wonderful how
[1:59:18] great he is what going to do he's going
[1:59:19] to come and be a Rapture someday go home
[1:59:21] and deny the very signs and wonders
[1:59:23] right here at the time that the
[1:59:24] scripture says that he'll be doing it
[1:59:26] Miss the whole thing if the blind lead
[1:59:28] the blind Jesus said they'll all fall in
[1:59:29] a ditch let's pray God to open our eyes
[1:59:33] in this last stage all right now the
[1:59:37] same they do the same today they deny
[1:59:40] and crucify the same God today but not
[1:59:44] knowing him the same by denying him and
[1:59:48] doing by denying the things that they're
[1:59:50] doing today they don't crucify Christ
[1:59:53] again exactly but they blaspheme the
[1:59:56] Holy Ghost and by doing it they are how
[1:59:59] do they blaspheme the Holy Ghost how how
[2:00:02] did they blaspheme it that back there
[2:00:04] why they couldn't blashe it then hadn't
[2:00:05] come
[2:00:06] yet they called Jesus be
[2:00:09] elub called him be elub because he could
[2:00:12] know the secrets of their hearts and
[2:00:14] things he said this is a devil in other
[2:00:16] words he's a fortune teller that's how
[2:00:18] he does this is by fortune telling he's
[2:00:21] nothing but a devil see they had had a
[2:00:22] prophet in 400 years and done grow out
[2:00:24] of it see they just had their laws they
[2:00:27] said this is Bey about and Jesus said
[2:00:29] I'll forgive you for
[2:00:31] that but when the Holy Ghost has
[2:00:34] come now you speak a word against it and
[2:00:39] it'll never be forgiven you remember it
[2:00:43] will and cannot by no means no mercy
[2:00:47] when you blashe and call the spirit of
[2:00:50] God the word of God that's being
[2:00:52] Vindicated by the spirit see the word
[2:00:54] says so the spirits are vindicating it
[2:00:57] and you call it an unclean thing you've
[2:00:59] crossed the line between mercy and
[2:01:01] judgment and can never be forgiven for
[2:01:04] it that's the reason I di this
[2:01:07] generation of guilty of crucifying
[2:01:10] blaspheming the manifested Son of God
[2:01:13] amen hallelujah amen as is Promised for
[2:01:16] all the prophets and Christ himself to
[2:01:18] be in the last days like it was in the
[2:01:19] days of Noah in the days of
[2:01:22] Sodom blasphemy which they crucify to
[2:01:26] the people the Son of God of Flesh he is
[2:01:29] a Vindicated word one word against it
[2:01:32] can never be
[2:01:33] forgiven now what are you going to do
[2:01:36] then why are you going to stand there
[2:01:39] condemned just waiting the hour of God's
[2:01:42] Wrath to be poured
[2:01:44] out you come on loving doctrine of man
[2:01:48] made the denominations and dogmas better
[2:01:50] than they do the Vindicated word of
[2:01:53] God this generation of people
[2:01:57] oh I I just wish I had a long time for
[2:02:02] this this generation of people this
[2:02:06] generation sperms God's
[2:02:09] revelation
[2:02:12] am but we're walking where the apostles
[2:02:14] have
[2:02:16] tried God you say well others say that
[2:02:19] too God vindicates it Jesus said if if
[2:02:24] if the works don't speak of me then just
[2:02:26] go ahead say I'm saying it myself but
[2:02:27] the works speaks you better believe the
[2:02:29] works because it's the hour said you
[2:02:31] know tomorrow the sun's going to shine
[2:02:34] or it's going to be foul weather but the
[2:02:35] skies red and L tomorrow be fair said
[2:02:38] you can discern the face of Skies but
[2:02:40] the signs of the time you know nothing
[2:02:42] about if you would have known God You'
[2:02:44] have known my day and they said you take
[2:02:47] so much upon yourself you make yourself
[2:02:48] God and he put him on the cross and the
[2:02:51] Holy Ghost today is not no third person
[2:02:53] it's God himself manifested in human
[2:02:55] flesh by the blood of Jesus Christ to
[2:02:57] sanctify a life that he might reflect
[2:02:59] himself through and they crucify that
[2:03:01] same word made
[2:03:04] manifest you understand am the
[2:03:07] crucifixion of Christ today is the
[2:03:09] people who will deny the Vindicated and
[2:03:12] manifested Son of God Among The People
[2:03:14] by his things that he said would take
[2:03:16] place in this day by his word than
[2:03:19] now the same Vindication would have to
[2:03:22] be the same if he's the same Son of God
[2:03:24] because he said in St John 14:12 now
[2:03:27] that the works that I do shall you do
[2:03:29] also Hebrews 13:8 is same yesterday and
[2:03:32] forever if ye abide me John 15 if you
[2:03:35] abide me and my words abide in you just
[2:03:38] ask what you will it'll be given to you
[2:03:42] yes sir remember they were very
[2:03:44] religious people that did
[2:03:46] that they wasn't Outsiders
[2:03:49] they were the religious people of that
[2:03:51] day that's what's doing it today is the
[2:03:54] religious people same crucifixion same
[2:03:57] thing today quickly There They Crucified
[2:04:02] him then sure
[2:04:04] then they were rejecting God's word made
[2:04:09] manifest accepting their Creeds instead
[2:04:12] of the
[2:04:13] word is that what they're doing today
[2:04:16] exactly doing the same today
[2:04:19] he was the word and they rejected the
[2:04:24] word that's one point I want you not to
[2:04:27] miss I want you not to miss he was the
[2:04:31] word and when they rejected him they
[2:04:34] rejected the word and when they did
[2:04:37] reject him they finally crucified him
[2:04:40] and that's what they've done today
[2:04:41] reject the word of God and accepted
[2:04:46] their Creeds and is crucified publicly
[2:04:50] before their congregation the working of
[2:04:52] the Holy Spirit and they're guilty and I
[2:04:56] di him in the name of Jesus Christ 15
[2:04:59] years I've
[2:05:17] seen
[2:05:21] and all God's people say

[2:05:28] word they did not recognize their day I
[2:05:30] trust that you recognize this morning
[2:05:32] what God is doing then now today and in
[2:05:36] the future I do believe brothers and
