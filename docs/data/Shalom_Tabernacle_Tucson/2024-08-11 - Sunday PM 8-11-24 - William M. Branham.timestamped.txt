[50:41] and the eyet in this shoe was just about
[50:44] the size of a little than a 116 probably
[50:49] of an inch of the out and I was trying

[51:51] that I cannot interpret because it's in
[51:54] an unknown language that's then right
[51:57] there and look right straight at it and
[52:00] this is the third po coming up and the
[52:04] Holy Spirit of God oh my that's the
[52:08] reason all CH
[52:11] was now I better stop right here see I
[52:16] just I just feel checked not to say no
[52:18] more about it see so just
[52:20] remember the seventh seal the reason it
[52:23] was not
[52:27] the reason it did not reveal it no one
[52:30] should know about it I want you to know
[52:33] before I even know any word about that
[52:35] that Vision come years ago you remember
[52:38] that and here it is just as this other
[52:40] ass slides right straight into the word
[52:43] exactly where it was and God knows my
[52:45] heart I one time thought of such a thing
[52:48] EXA here it was that's
[52:54] later oh
[52:58] that shows us from God for see it fits
[53:02] exactly in the promises of God from the
[53:07] end of the the message you notice notice
[53:11] now or they in the time
[53:15] message this seal after all he's
[53:19] revealed all the six seals but who say
[53:21] about the seven and the end time seal
[53:25] when it starts with be absolutely a
[53:28] total
[53:29] secret according to the
[53:31] Bible before knowing that and remember
[53:35] Revelations
[53:38] 1017 1- 7 chapter 10 1 to 7 at the end
[53:44] of the seventh Angel's
[53:47] message

[55:17] seven
[55:19] angels being this being the message that
[55:22] was 24th and Angels bring me back here
[55:24] for that remember the seventh messenger
[55:28] was the seven Messengers was the norn
[55:34] blond to me the seventh angel it seemed
[55:36] more to me than any I see they were
[55:39] standing like
[55:42] this we just want you know and I was
[55:46] standing here and I was watching those
[55:49] other see one first bunch of little bird
[55:53] feathers all beat down you remember them
[55:55] and they all flew
[55:58] Eastward and the second bu were brighter
[56:02] bigger birds look like doves pointed
[56:05] Wings they FW East first B second
[56:10] P then the next was
[56:13] angels and it's standing right there and
[56:16] this explosion left and I was looking
[56:18] this way towards the west and they come
[56:20] and just pick me up and there went out
[56:22] of my
[56:24] no and the one of them coming was the
[56:27] one that is strange to me was the one on
[56:31] my beat the left where I entered the
[56:33] consolation that but counting from the
[56:36] left to the right it would been the
[56:37] seventh
[56:39] angel coming across
[56:42] now remember the seven Messengers do you
[56:46] remember the Pyramid of White Rock of
[56:50] Junior Jackson's dream that I driv to
[56:53] you
[56:58] noce the night that I
[57:00] left and I there was six dreams came and
[57:05] every one of them directly to the same
[57:07] thing then the vision started in sney
[57:11] West Junior he was watching well notice
[57:15] look how
[57:19] perf I'm Hing and trusting that you
[57:21] people realize that I'm trying to put
[57:24] this grace on Jes Jesus Christ who is
[57:27] the author of all of it and the only
[57:30] reason you never heard me talk about
[57:31] this before in your
[57:33] life but this hour is
[57:39] approaching notice I have to make it
[57:43] sure to you so you can be Damen down I'm
[57:47] fixing the leave you again I don't know
[57:49] where I go I must preach the gospel
[57:52] other places but now that you might say
[57:55] I've heard kind of F I don't know what I
[57:58] can't judge any other man I only have to
[58:00] answer to God for what I for
[58:03] myself but has there ever been one time
[58:06] I ever told you anything in the name of
[58:08] the Lord it wasn't right all these years
[58:10] nobody else can say so because I always
[58:12] told it this the way he told it now let
[58:14] me just show you that this is exactly
[58:17] true and confirm it I remember if there
[58:19] be a spiritual of prophet I Lord will
[58:23] speak to any Nations and know by dreams
[58:27] interpreting dreams is that Joseph you
[58:29] can interpret dreams and speaking and
[58:32] see Visions is that true now notice this
[58:35] that now when this taken place Junior
[58:39] was standing in a field and had a had a
[58:42] big pyramid to it like that and there
[58:44] was something the rocks and I was
[58:46] revealing that to the people is that
[58:48] right Junior about a year before it
[58:51] happened and notice the next thing now I
[58:53] took some kind of a bar and cut it off
[58:56] on the inside was White Rock that had
[58:58] nothing WR on it and at that time I
[59:00] started to the west and I told them all
[59:03] I said don't go out west stay here and
[59:08] look on this till I
[59:10] return When West for the blast return
[59:15] back to the east with the Holy Spirit
[59:20] intereted this Unwritten word amen Hall

[59:33] end now if them others is perfectly on
[59:36] the dot with the word so is this
[59:39] perfectly on the dot with the
[59:42] word we are

[59:47] end soon it shall be time run
[59:51] out Millions will lose your
[59:54] lives Millions will be if now believe
[59:57] that they are
[59:59] saved will be counted father for the
[1:00:03] atomic
[1:00:04] age we are living at the last
[1:00:08] hour by the grace of almighty God by his
[1:00:12] help to his people that they might look
[1:00:16] forward to the soon appearing of Christ
[1:00:19] how long around maybe in 20 years maybe
[1:00:22] in 50 years maybe in 100 years I don't
[1:00:25] know
[1:00:26] and maybe in the morning maybe at T
[1:00:29] night I don't know anybody says that you
[1:00:32] know they're
[1:00:36] wrong God only
[1:00:38] know now notice so help me by God I tell
[1:00:43] the truth that these are spiritually
[1:00:48] discerned to
[1:00:50] me discerned by the Holy
[1:00:53] Spirit and by every one of them has
[1:00:57] identified its place in the
[1:01:00] Bible now what this great secret is that
[1:01:04] lays beneath this seal I do not know I
[1:01:08] don't know it I couldn't make it out I
[1:01:12] couldn't tell it this what what it said
[1:01:16] but I know that it was in seven Thunders
[1:01:19] other themselves that close together
[1:01:21] just banging seven different times and
[1:01:24] it unfolded into something else that I
[1:01:26] seen then when I seen that I look for
[1:01:29] the interpretation F Closs there and I
[1:01:31] couldn't make it out that's exactly
[1:01:34] right see the hour isn't quite yet far
[1:01:37] amen but it's moving into that
[1:01:40] cycle it's coming up close so the thing
[1:01:44] for you to do is to remember that I
[1:01:47] speak to you in the name of the Lord
[1:01:52] amen hallelujah be prepared or you don't
[1:01:56] know a l time something can happen now
[1:01:59] when that gets on tape which it is
[1:02:01] that'll probably send 10,000 of my
[1:02:04] friends away from me because B say that
[1:02:08] brother B's trying to put himself and
[1:02:09] make himself a a servant or a prophet or
[1:02:12] something before God let me tell you my
[1:02:15] brethren that is an error I'm only
[1:02:18] telling you what I seen and what has
[1:02:22] been told to me and not you you do
[1:02:24] whatever you want to amen
[1:02:26] I don't know who's going to what's going
[1:02:28] to take place I do not know I just know
[1:02:32] that those seven Thunders holds that
[1:02:34] mystery of Heavens was
[1:02:36] quiet everybody
[1:02:39] understand it may be T it may be the
[1:02:43] hour now that this great person that
[1:02:46] we're expecting to rise on the scene may
[1:02:49] rise on the scene maybe this ministry
[1:02:52] that I have tried to take people back to
[1:02:55] the word has laid a
[1:02:57] foundation and if it has I'll be leaning
[1:03:01] you for good there won't be two of us
[1:03:04] here at the same
[1:03:05] time if it is you'll increase or
[1:03:09] decrease I don't know but I have been
[1:03:12] privileged by God to look and see what
[1:03:14] it was see see unfold to that much now
[1:03:18] that is the truth and I'm
[1:03:22] sure that you notice that things has
[1:03:25] been happening this
[1:03:26] sweet I'm sure you notice that little
[1:03:29] Collins boy there dying other night that
[1:03:31] little leukemia
[1:03:36] girl the kingdom of God is
[1:03:41] coming and it's becoming more from the
[1:03:43] negative to the positive as it has been
[1:03:46] now that choke people from justification
[1:03:50] to sanctification to the baptism of the
[1:03:52] Holy Ghost and then you're here amen
[1:03:55] we're just dra closer to God all the
[1:03:57] time can't you see Methodist
[1:04:01] ministers how that your message of
[1:04:04] sanctification was above that which
[1:04:06] Luther preached you Pentecostal can't
[1:04:08] you see your message of the baptism is
[1:04:11] beyond that what Methodist
[1:04:13] preached you know what I
[1:04:16] mean oh we've had a lot of things going
[1:04:18] forth and that's right and if there's
[1:04:20] anybody that
[1:04:22] despises uh wrong and people saying
[1:04:25] something is actually lies and not the
[1:04:27] truth I hate
[1:04:29] that but I I do love the solid truth no
[1:04:33] matter how much it interrupts this word
[1:04:35] that way if it's truth God will finally
[1:04:36] show it his
[1:04:38] truth and if he doesn't do that one of
[1:04:41] these days soon than my vision
[1:04:46] must you see where I say myself why it
[1:04:49] be brother I cannot tell you I do not
[1:04:52] know but one of these days if we never
[1:04:54] meet again on this Earth we're going to
[1:04:56] meet down at the at the Judgment seat of
[1:04:58] Christ you'll find out that in that room
[1:05:02] the Revelation coming from God is like
[1:05:05] all the rest of man and then one of the
[1:05:07] mystery of that seal the reason it
[1:05:09] wasn't revealed it was seven Thunders
[1:05:11] and other than voices and there is
[1:05:13] perfectly because nothing knows anything
[1:05:15] about it wasn't even
[1:05:17] written so
[1:05:20] we're we are here I thank God for his
[1:05:24] word I thank him for Jesus Christ for
[1:05:28] without sing him for the the
[1:05:32] propitiation of our sins we all be in a
[1:05:37] big Mark of sin with no hope but by his
[1:05:41] grace his his blood cleanses all sin
[1:05:46] it's like the drop of ink and a bucket
[1:05:49] of Clorox you never find the ink again
[1:05:52] when our sins are confessed it's but in
[1:05:54] the blood of Jesus Christ they'll never
[1:05:56] be known again God forgets them they was
[1:05:59] they been done as long as that sacrifice
[1:06:02] is laying there in an atonement for us
[1:06:04] that's all that's it see we we're not
[1:06:07] Sinners no more we're Christians by the
[1:06:09] grace of God remember in our own selves
[1:06:12] we probably be just as bad as we ever
[1:06:14] was but see the grace of God has
[1:06:16] appeared to us and that's what's made us
[1:06:19] what we are today Christian brothers and
[1:06:24] sisters this is been a tremendous week
[1:06:26] for me I'm tired my mind is tired
[1:06:31] because I I have with the best that I
[1:06:33] could do and something strange going on
[1:06:36] every day I would be amazed to walk in
[1:06:39] the room and be there for a few minutes
[1:06:41] and see something is tur me completely
[1:06:43] around and here I go in there I pick up
[1:06:46] the notes I pick up books of Dr Smith

[1:07:24] like that go down then I take the rest
[1:07:27] of the day go down and chase this out
[1:07:29] and see if it tied all the way down
[1:07:31] through the scriptures then I prove all
[1:07:34] things I got this year I think God
[1:07:36] there's many people had Visions there's
[1:07:38] many been Revelations if it's contrary
[1:07:40] to the word to leave
[1:07:42] Al now now then I run this down like

[1:07:57] the Bible and TI the thing down to the
[1:07:59] week there it is on PE you're welcome to
[1:08:02] them and I have did it to the best of my
[1:08:05] knowledge under Christian Fellowship
[1:08:08] grace of God to all men but Jesus Christ
[1:08:12] I've done the very best that I know how
[1:08:14] you've been one of the finest classes
[1:08:16] there's been nobody that said any nicer
[1:08:19] you all have coming here at 1:00 in the
[1:08:21] day up till 5:00 to whenever they open
[1:08:25] the church
[1:08:26] and brought the let the people come in
[1:08:28] you stood in the cold you stood in the
[1:08:30] snow you've done everything stood around
[1:08:32] the wall to your legs eight I see The
[1:08:35] man sit down at the women in different
[1:08:36] mornings and standing like that sitting
[1:08:39] around I thought Lord has been a
[1:08:41] mysterious week the whole thing's been
[1:08:44] kind of strange how would people come
[1:08:47] see stand around the outside in the
[1:08:49] windows in the doors back around the
[1:08:50] back everywhere listen And as far as the
[1:08:54] speaker I'm far far from a speaker I I
[1:08:56] got that much intelligence to know that
[1:08:58] I'm not but I'm not a speaker but why
[1:09:00] would people sit and listen like that
[1:09:03] why would they do it they don't come to
[1:09:05] hear a person like me but they're coming
[1:09:07] because there's something in it drawing
[1:09:09] a
[1:09:11] p see there something in it that's
[1:09:13] drawing as my wife stood here at the
[1:09:16] platform and sing when I started they
[1:09:18] come from the East and West they come
[1:09:20] from the land of far to Feast with the
[1:09:22] King to d as his guest how blessed these
[1:09:25] PS are beholding his Hall face a glow
[1:09:29] with light Divine blessed partakers of
[1:09:32] his grace as gems in his crown to shine
[1:09:36] may you always bear that in mind to be a
[1:09:39] gem in the crown of Jesus Christ Paul
[1:09:42] said to the church you are you are the
[1:09:44] jewels the gems of his crown we want to
[1:09:47] be the gems of the crown of Jesus Christ
[1:09:50] we don't want never put a man in it you
[1:09:53] forget anything about me I I am your
[1:09:56] brother a sinner saved by grace not fit
[1:09:59] to live that's exactly the truth I say
[1:10:03] that to be humble that's facts there's
[1:10:06] nothing in me not one sound thing at all
[1:10:09] but the grace of God has let my poor
[1:10:13] Deming eyes look beyond the curtain of
[1:10:16] time and see those things on I come back
[1:10:19] I boy I love people I always want
[1:10:21] somebody to love me and talk to me
[1:10:23] nobody would do it because of name of
[1:10:25] the family nobody talked to me but when
[1:10:28] I made my surrender to God then our
[1:10:30] people background being Irish I thought
[1:10:33] maybe there's all Catholic maybe that
[1:10:34] would be it I went there he some way and
[1:10:36] I went back the First Baptist Church and
[1:10:38] he another way I said Lord there's got
[1:10:40] to be some way it's true and something
[1:10:41] said it's a word I've help that word
[1:10:44] look at every Vision every word the day
[1:10:47] I laid that Cornerstone on that in there
[1:10:50] wrote on there what he show me that
[1:10:51] morning in Vision be instant in season
[1:10:54] out of season
[1:10:56] longsuffering doctor for the time will
[1:10:57] come and they not endure sound doct but
[1:10:59] as their own lust shall heat for
[1:11:01] themselves together as teachers having
[1:11:02] kit ear and be turned away from the
[1:11:05] truth and the fables I've seen those two
[1:11:08] trees that have stood by do that very
[1:11:10] same
[1:11:11] thing
[1:11:14] right now we are that is true now you
[1:11:19] won't remember let
[1:11:21] me exort you again
[1:11:25] don't say thank you to anybody at all
[1:11:29] don't say think of some minister or
[1:11:31] something some Mortal man there's
[1:11:33] anything good about him go there's not I
[1:11:35] don't care who he is amen there's
[1:11:37] nothing good to any man that's right if
[1:11:40] there's a whole bunch of trumpets l in
[1:11:42] Europe and one of them had to sound out
[1:11:43] of certain music it's the man trumpets
[1:11:46] are perfectly mute it's the fell that
[1:11:49] can sound the trumpet that knows what
[1:11:50] he's going to do that picks up the
[1:11:52] trumpet the trumpet has nothing to do
[1:11:54] with it the sound cons of intelligence
[1:11:56] behind it amen that's right so all
[1:11:59] trumpets are the same all man are the
[1:12:01] same all Christians are the same there's
[1:12:03] no great man among us we're not great

[1:20:01] [Music]
[1:20:12] [Music]
[1:20:20] you have just finished hearing the
[1:20:22] original Seven seal as it was preached
[1:20:24] its entirety on Sunday evening March
[1:20:26] 24th 1963 at the Brenham Tabernacle in
[1:20:30] Jeffersonville
[1:20:31] Indiana brother brandom did not want
[1:20:33] this original recording released the
[1:20:36] next day Monday March 25th
[1:20:38] 1963 brother brandham went to the motel
[1:20:41] room of brother Fred San and brother
[1:20:43] James Maguire who were at that time in
[1:20:46] charge of making the tapes brother Bram
[1:20:49] told these brothers I don't want this
[1:20:51] message sit out the way it is after
[1:20:54] listening to the tape himself he
[1:20:55] instructed the brothers to stop the tape
[1:20:57] at a certain point and at that point
[1:21:00] recorded a new portion of approximately
[1:21:02] 20 minutes in length this new portion
[1:21:05] was then used in place of the original
[1:21:08] ending this recording was the only
[1:21:10] released version of the seventh seal
[1:21:11] until
[1:21:13] 1966 after brother Brenham left the
[1:21:15] scene the board of the William Brenham
[1:21:17] Evangelistic Association unanimously
[1:21:19] agreed to release the tape originally
[1:21:22] recorded at the
[1:21:23] Tabernacle since that time both versions
[1:21:26] have been
[1:21:27] available we have now placed this
[1:21:29] additional message of brother brandham
[1:21:30] on one tape with the original 7th seal
[1:21:34] the next voice you hear will be brother
[1:21:36] brandham in the motel room on Monday
[1:21:38] March 25th
[1:21:41] 1963 be a good thing that he doesn't
[1:21:43] know anything about because if he did
[1:21:47] then he would impersonate that that's in
[1:21:51] his tricks in doing things so therefore
[1:21:54] God has made it so into to the whole
[1:21:57] world even the heaven that there is no
[1:22:01] way of understanding it only as God will
[1:22:04] reveal it himself now I want you to
[1:22:07] notice tonight that in the six seal
[1:22:12] there was a a threefold purpose of the
[1:22:16] six seal there was a three-fold purpose
[1:22:19] of the horse riders there been a
[1:22:21] three-fold purpose and all these things
[1:22:24] that brings us back to a three and a
[1:22:27] seven again see Seven Seals
[1:22:31] seven BS and so forth now in Threes And
[1:22:36] Sevens is God's number in his
[1:22:39] mathematics of revealing his word now
[1:22:43] you notice like in the the riters uh
[1:22:47] there was uh three horses went out one
[1:22:51] of them was a white one one was a red
[1:22:54] one one was a black one and then in the
[1:22:58] fourth horse what all of is mixed
[1:23:01] together see a threefold purpose now God
[1:23:05] did the same thing God did the same when
[1:23:08] he sent out his line which was his word
[1:23:12] to combat the Antichrist and we find out
[1:23:15] that he sent out the ox during the time
[1:23:18] of the uh the tribulation period the
[1:23:22] sacrificial animal and in this
[1:23:25] tribulation period That's all the people
[1:23:27] could do just work slave and offer
[1:23:32] themselves for a sacrifice then we find
[1:23:34] out in the next age which was reformers
[1:23:37] age God sent out the wisdom of a man a
[1:23:40] man like head on the Beast which was a
[1:23:42] power that went forth into reformers now
[1:23:45] did you notice every no wonder that the
[1:23:48] people of these days uh still living The
[1:23:51] Hangover like it was from the reformers
[1:23:54] age
[1:23:55] because they just see it in the
[1:23:57] ecclesiastical way of looking at it they
[1:23:59] see it in the way that the seminaries
[1:24:01] just taught it that was God's way at one
[1:24:03] time but we've lived to past that now
[1:24:06] we're into the age of the eagle the
[1:24:09] Revelation to be reveal the whole thing
[1:24:12] I'll compare this with Revelations the
[1:24:15] 10th chapter verse 1-7 and we'll see
[1:24:18] here in this Revelations uh the
[1:24:21] Revelation here 10 1-7 that in the days
[1:24:25] of the sounding of the seventh Angel's
[1:24:28] message was to finish up all the
[1:24:31] mysteries of God now we find out also in
[1:24:37] this that the six uh seal now being open
[1:24:40] it was for a three-fold purpose now here
[1:24:44] was the purposes the first thing was
[1:24:47] that the sleeping virgin had to go
[1:24:50] through the tribulation period for
[1:24:53] purification she had to be purged of her
[1:24:56] sins of unbelief and rejecting the
[1:24:59] message this she was done in the
[1:25:01] tribulation period we see they wind up
[1:25:04] over here in Revelation 7 between the
[1:25:06] sixth and seventh uh chapter here that
[1:25:09] she had been purged and she' been given
[1:25:12] her robes now she's not the bride but
[1:25:15] it's a church that pure people that
[1:25:19] didn't have the opportunity maybe to
[1:25:21] receive the message or in some way that
[1:25:23] they reply Ed by these false prophets
[1:25:26] and they they didn't get a chance and
[1:25:28] yet they're really sincere in heart and
[1:25:30] God knows their heart and you're there
[1:25:32] purged during this time you notice
[1:25:35] another purging kind that's for Israel
[1:25:38] when she gathers that's the second po
[1:25:41] God purges Israel in the tribulation
[1:25:43] period out of the millions out together
[1:25:45] there there will be a
[1:25:47] selected
[1:25:49] 144,000 and they will be purged also
[1:25:53] God's purging Israel notice there is a
[1:25:56] whole earth is to be purged there will
[1:25:59] be such a thing that the moon stars all
[1:26:03] nature will be purged you see what it is
[1:26:06] the Earth is renewing herself being
[1:26:09] purged getting ready for the Millennium
[1:26:12] the millennium's coming up and see
[1:26:15] everything that's got any filth in it is
[1:26:18] to be purged during the six seal now how
[1:26:22] do you notice on the or of this seventh
[1:26:25] seal it's also in a threefold mystery
[1:26:29] this one I will speak in have spoke that
[1:26:33] it is the mystery of the seven Thunders
[1:26:36] the seven thunders in heaven will unfold
[1:26:39] this Myster it'll be right at the coming
[1:26:42] of Christ because Christ said no one
[1:26:45] knew when he would return did you notice
[1:26:48] when the Jews asking that no when we
[1:26:50] compareed the scripture with Matthew 24
[1:26:53] with the six seals the seven seal was
[1:26:56] left out because you see Christ said
[1:27:00] only God himself know not even the
[1:27:02] angels no wonder it wasn't even written
[1:27:05] you see the harsh nothing take place and
[1:27:07] Angels don't know it nobody knows when
[1:27:09] he's coming but there'll be a there'll
[1:27:12] be uh seven voices of these Thunders
[1:27:16] that will reveal the great Revelation at
[1:27:19] that time so I believe to us who if we
[1:27:24] don't know it and we we it will't be
[1:27:27] known till that time but it will be
[1:27:29] revealed in that day in The Hour That is
[1:27:33] supposed to be revealed in so the thing
[1:27:35] for us to do is to be reverent before
[1:27:38] God and serving and do all that we know
[1:27:41] how to do and live good Christian lives
[1:27:44] here now we find that the six uh seal
[1:27:49] has been open to us we see it and we
[1:27:52] know that this seven
[1:27:54] seal cannot be broke to the public until
[1:27:58] that hour arrives now there was some
[1:28:01] reason that God let this uh seven voices
[1:28:06] be thunder because it must come see for
[1:28:10] the we find that Christ the lamb took
[1:28:13] the the book in his hand and he opened
[1:28:16] that seven seal but you see it's a
[1:28:19] hidden mystery no one knows it but it it
[1:28:23] right along with what he said no one
[1:28:25] would know he's coming they also would
[1:28:28] not know about this seven Thunder
[1:28:31] mystery so you see it's connected
[1:28:33] together that much we have an
[1:28:35] understanding of it today the C the rest
[1:28:38] of it is all unfolded but this is not
[1:28:40] unfolded but sitting in my room and I
[1:28:45] heard this not heard it brother but seen
[1:28:48] it unfold to this seven Thunders now
[1:28:52] that's as far as we can go right there
[1:28:55] and now I trust that each and every one
[1:28:57] of you will serve God and do that which
[1:29:00] is right and love him all your life and
[1:29:04] serve him and God will take care of the
[1:29:06] rest now we have the completion here now
[1:29:09] by the grace of God all the mysteries of
[1:29:13] the six seals that's been sealed up and
[1:29:16] we understand and know here that the
[1:29:18] seven seal is not to be known to the
[1:29:22] public I is coming at the hour of his
[1:29:25] coming one the destruction of the earth
[1:29:28] you know he said there what will be the
[1:29:30] sign of the coming of the end of the
[1:29:32] world in Matthew 24 there where they
[1:29:35] asked him that question he went down to
[1:29:37] that he told about Israel being gathered
[1:29:40] as a nation in the 31st verse of Matthew
[1:29:44] 24:31 but then he started off on
[1:29:47] Parables see and you see the learn a
[1:29:50] parable of big tree when you see it
[1:29:53] putting forth its bu that's why you know
[1:29:55] spring down then when you see this uh
[1:29:58] coming to pass then though the time is
[1:30:01] not see Israel gathering in its own
[1:30:04] Homeland but you notice he omitted the
[1:30:09] revelation of this seventh seal and here
[1:30:13] when the seventh seal when he opened it
[1:30:15] he also omitted it again see so we see
[1:30:19] that it is a complete mystery therefore
[1:30:22] the hour is not yet this mystery to be
[1:30:25] known therefore we're this far and the
[1:30:28] rest of it will be known right around
[1:30:31] about the time that Jesus appears on
[1:30:33] Earth again for his bride or whatever
[1:30:36] takes place at that time now until that
[1:30:39] time let's just all pray live good
[1:30:42] straight Christian lives looking forward
[1:30:44] for his coming and now this tap would
[1:30:47] have to fall into the hands of some
[1:30:50] persons somewhere don't try to
[1:30:54] uh make any kind of an ism out of it the
[1:30:57] only thing you do is continue serving
[1:30:59] God because this great secret is so
[1:31:03] great that God wouldn't even let John
[1:31:06] Rite it thundered out but he knowing
[1:31:08] that promis that it would be open but to
[1:31:12] this time it isn't open and now we are
[1:31:15] grateful to God for what he has shed us
[1:31:18] I've been sitting in the room up there
[1:31:20] for eight days and the message that I
[1:31:25] have just got through explaining to you
[1:31:28] many of you here will understand and I
[1:31:31] promise that there was something going
[1:31:33] on spiritual all the time that I sure
[1:31:35] you were missing it and here's what it
[1:31:37] is it's the
[1:31:40] absolute
[1:31:42] Vindication of this
[1:31:45] interpretation of the scriptures being s
[1:31:49] of God because before we even went into
[1:31:53] it in our left to go west the Lord
[1:31:55] showed me a vision one day about 10:00
[1:31:58] one morning and I come and explain it I
[1:32:01] here that I'd seen it didn't know what
[1:32:03] it was it was a constellation of seven
[1:32:07] angels we remember that you'll get it on
[1:32:10] the T what time is it sir well now that
[1:32:15] is exactly what you're seeing now the
[1:32:18] seven angels I was in the west you
[1:32:21] remember the little bitt Messengers
[1:32:24] they went East the second messengers the
[1:32:28] Dos a little bit larger bird they went
[1:32:31] East and now I look they was with me all
[1:32:34] the time that is that first and second
[1:32:37] pull now the third came from the West
[1:32:42] sweeping forward with great terrific
[1:32:44] speed and they picked me up that was
[1:32:48] coming back East with the mystery of
[1:32:50] these Seven Seals just like it said and
[1:32:53] and Junior Jackson's uh dream that the
[1:32:56] Lord let me interpret for him there on
[1:32:59] the inside of that FID there was white
[1:33:02] stone that wasn't written on that's the
[1:33:05] reason I had to go west to connect with
[1:33:09] these angels message to come back here
[1:33:12] to reveal it to the church remember I
[1:33:14] said the next things that happen to you
[1:33:16] at the church that's just exactly
[1:33:18] another thing I want you to notice what
[1:33:21] taking
[1:33:22] place even if you're listen to the tape
[1:33:26] of the what time is it sir you will
[1:33:28] notice that one Angel was very notable
[1:33:32] to me the rest of them just seemed
[1:33:35] ordinary but this Angel was a noted
[1:33:37] Angel he was to my left in the
[1:33:40] consolation in the form of a pyramid and
[1:33:43] remember it was in the pyramid where the
[1:33:47] mysterious White Rock was not written on
[1:33:51] and the angels took me into that pyramid
[1:33:54] of themselves the mysteries of God known
[1:33:58] only to them and now there was The
[1:34:01] Messengers had come to interpret that
[1:34:04] pyramid of that message of the secret of
[1:34:07] these Seven Seals which lays with inside
[1:34:10] the pyramid now the angel was to my left
[1:34:14] would really be the last or seventh
[1:34:18] angel if we would count them from left
[1:34:22] to right because he is on M left me
[1:34:24] looking at him towards the West him
[1:34:26] coming towards the east would be on the
[1:34:28] left side so that would be the last
[1:34:31] Angel's message very notable remember
[1:34:34] how I said he had his got his head back
[1:34:36] and his great sharp wings and how he
[1:34:39] flew right to me now that is this seven
[1:34:42] seal it still is a norble thing and we
[1:34:47] are we don't know what it is as yet
[1:34:50] because it's not permitted to be broken
[1:34:53] but now
[1:34:54] each one of you in the meeting has
[1:34:56] noticed that what a meeting it's been
[1:34:59] everybody just seemed to be right on the
[1:35:03] end of their seat everybody uh standing
[1:35:07] around here 1 2 o00 the afternoon
[1:35:09] waiting for the doors to open get up
[1:35:11] here in the front standing around the
[1:35:13] walls cramp Limbs and everything what is
[1:35:16] it it's been the Holy Spirit sing down
[1:35:22] these Messengers
[1:35:24] and they have been revealing it to us
[1:35:27] and then notice how it's Dove tail with
[1:35:29] the word exactly and then to let you all
[1:35:32] know that this is truth he foretold it
[1:35:35] about him about two months now or more
[1:35:38] before it ever happened that when I went
[1:35:42] West not knowing it come back here with
[1:35:46] the interpretation as he is given I
[1:35:49] remember in the vision he never told me
[1:35:51] one thing in the vision when he took up
[1:35:54] I was scared for has going to die being
[1:35:56] killed in an explosion you see they
[1:35:59] could not do it the interpretation Come
[1:36:02] Just As I had need of it that was in the
[1:36:04] room and I gave it out just as he give
[1:36:07] it now you see friends Visions doesn't
[1:36:11] fail they're always perfect they're just
[1:36:14] exactly true now the Vision Plus the
[1:36:17] word plus the history plus the church
[1:36:20] ages and all blend together so I could
[1:36:24] truly say that to the best of my
[1:36:27] understanding and according to the word
[1:36:29] of God and the vision and the Revelation
[1:36:32] the interpretation thereof is thus
[1:36:35] sayeth the Lord now may the Lord bless
[1:36:37] you all each one real richly as we stand

[1:54:24] forgetfulness that's good enough for me
