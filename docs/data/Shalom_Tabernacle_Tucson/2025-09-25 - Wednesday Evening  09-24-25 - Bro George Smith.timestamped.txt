[6:31] Let's pray together.
[6:33] Heavenly Father, we're thankful for your
[6:36] love. Thank you, Father, for dying for
[6:39] us, Lord, and what you have done in our
[6:42] lives, Lord. We just claim the blood of
[6:45] Jesus tonight, Lord, that you sanctify
[6:48] us holy to worship you in spirit and in
[6:51] truth, Lord Jesus. Your word says that
[6:55] you've given a measure of faith to every
[6:57] man, Lord, and we take that and we thank
[7:00] you for it, Lord. We pray that we'd
[7:03] honor you, Lord, and believe in all of
[7:05] your word. Take any unbelief away,
[7:07] Father. Lord, cause us to, Father,
[7:12] rightly divide,
[7:14] Lord Jesus, and believe all of thy word.
[7:18] For shall not live by bread alone, but
[7:21] by every word of God. We're thankful for
[7:23] it. Those that may be traveling, Lord,
[7:26] we pray you'd be with them. Pray you'd
[7:28] be with the minister tonight as he
[7:30] brings forth the word. And we we're
[7:33] thankful that you can speak to our
[7:34] hearts. Open them wide for your word and
[7:37] we'll give you all the praise. In the
[7:39] name of Jesus Christ we ask. Amen. Amen.
[7:43] God bless you. Thank you.
[7:48] We're going up yonder. Would you like to
[7:50] tell your neighbor where are you going?
[7:52] God bless them and shake each other's
[7:54] hands.
[7:56] Oh, if you want to know
[8:01] where I am going,
[8:06] where I am going
[8:09] [Music]

[9:48] until I see my savior
[9:52] face to face.

[11:00] to high
[11:05] every day
[11:08] to pray.
[11:11] I want to rise.
[11:15] Lord, lift my knee on high
[11:19] ground.

[12:53] Lord, lift me up
[12:57] and let me stand
[13:01] my faith on him

[13:13] that I have found.
[13:17] Your strength me on higher
[13:22] ground.
[13:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus is my savior. I shall not be
[13:29] moved.
[13:31] In his loving favor, I shall not be
[13:35] moved. Just like the tree that's planted
[13:39] by the water,
[13:43] I shall not be true.
[13:48] Oh, I shall not be I shall not be moved.
[13:55] Oh, I shall not be I shall not be moved.

[14:17] I shall not be moved.
[14:20] In his love mighty, I shall not be
[14:25] moved. Just like the tree that planted
[14:29] by the water,
[14:33] I shall not. If I trust him,
[14:38] oh, if I trust him,
[14:43] I shall not be moved.
[14:46] He will fail me never.

[15:38] that's waiting.
[15:40] I shall not be moved. Just like the

[16:02] Oh,

[16:15] I shall not be.
[16:20] Oh, I shall not be. I shall not be.
[16:27] Oh, I shall not be. I shall not be just
[16:33] like
[16:35] that in my heart.

[17:12] comes from you.
[17:19] You're

[17:30] Jesus,
[17:31] you're the center of my control
[17:36] [Music]
[17:40] and I've lost my direction.
[17:45] You're the com
[17:47] my way.
[17:50] You're the fire in my when nights are

[21:41] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[21:43] how I love Jesus.
[21:47] [Music]
[21:52] Oh,
[21:55] how I love Jesus
[22:03] because
[22:05] he first as brother George comes. Let's
[22:09] sing that first verse to him.
[22:14] There is
[22:17] a name
[22:19] I love
[22:23] to hear.
[22:26] I love
[22:28] to see
[22:31] his word.
[22:37] It sounds
[22:40] like music.
[22:42] [Music]
[22:44] in
[22:46] my ears.
[22:48] The sweetest
[22:52] thing.

[23:51] a sing
[23:54] your love
[23:56] who died
[23:59] to set
[24:02] me free.
[24:08] It tells
[24:11] me the
[24:13] obvious
[24:17] blood
[24:19] was s
[24:22] perfectly.
[24:24] [Music]
[24:30] Oh,
[24:34] how I love Jesus.

[25:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't he marvelous? Isn't he
[25:16] precious? Thank you for that love and
[25:19] grace. As we turn our hearts to the word
[25:23] that's being spoken tonight, let's sing
[25:26] that old hymn. Amazing grace, how sweet
[25:29] the sound.
[25:31] Oh, amazing
[25:35] grace.
[25:38] House meet
[25:41] the sound
[25:44] that say
[25:47] a rich
[25:50] like me.
[25:53] [Music]
[25:56] I once
[25:59] was lost
[26:02] but now
[26:05] I found
[26:08] I was blind
[26:10] but now
[26:13] I see.
[26:16] [Music]
[26:18] Oh, was great
[26:22] that
[26:25] my heart
[26:28] through the fear
[26:31] and
[26:34] my fears
[26:39] [Music]
[26:45] trust
[26:48] and grace
[26:51] appear.
[26:53] [Music]
[27:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to see all of you
[27:08] tonight again.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; And that'll be all the music for
[27:12] tonight. Thank you very much. Beautiful.
[27:15] You know, the next thing on God's
[27:17] schedule is a resurrection. Don't
[27:19] believe what you see on the internet.
[27:21] They they're looking at some other
[27:23] Bible. But we have a destination.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; We're not just going around circles. And
[27:29] so tonight, we're going to speak on a
[27:31] subject, our journey, the hope of the
[27:34] resurrection.
[27:36] And Elijah says over here in the message
[27:40] u the token, God's big clock ticks
[27:44] perfect,
[27:47] not late, not fast, perfectly on time.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; You think things are out of kilter, you
[27:54] got to trust God. He knows what he's
[27:55] doing.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; God's big clock ticks perfect. It won't
[27:59] be one minute fast or one minute behind.
[28:02] It will be just exactly on time, on
[28:06] schedule, and perfectly balanced
[28:09] &gt;&gt; every time. So, we'll just set this
[28:11] here. Maybe it'll stay there. No, but
[28:15] you know it's here.
[28:17] And so, we want to look at First John
[28:19] chapter 2 in your Bible. We're going to
[28:23] speak from Brother Brandham's Absolute
[28:24] tonight if it's okay with everybody.
[28:26] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[28:30] &gt;&gt; First John chapter 2, verse one.
[28:33] My little children, these things write I
[28:35] unto you that ye sin not. And if any man
[28:38] sin, we have an advocate with the
[28:40] father, Jesus Christ the righteous. And
[28:43] he is the propitiation for our sins. And
[28:46] not for ours only, but also for the sins
[28:49] of the whole world. Jesus came to die
[28:52] for all the world.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; Not just the Baptists, not just the
[28:56] Brandomites, no whole world.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; And one day every knee shall bow. Verse
[29:02] three. And hereby we do know that we
[29:05] know him if we keep his commandments.
[29:08] Now look down at the bottom of the
[29:10] chapter, verse 28. And now little
[29:12] children, abide in him, that when he
[29:14] shall appear, we may have confidence and
[29:18] not be ashamed before him at his coming.
[29:21] If you know that he is righteous, you
[29:24] know that everyone that doeth
[29:26] righteousness is born of him.
[29:28] you know on into chapter three. Behold
[29:31] what manner of love the father hath
[29:32] bestowed upon us that we should be
[29:35] called the sons of God. Therefore the
[29:38] world uh knoweth us not because it knew
[29:41] him not. Beloved now are we the sons of
[29:44] God and it does not yet appear what we
[29:47] shall be. But we know that when he shall
[29:50] appear we shall be like him for we shall
[29:53] see him as he is. and every man that
[29:55] hath this hope in him purifith himself
[29:59] even as he is pure.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank
[30:03] you for your mercy to us. We thank you,
[30:05] Lord, that you brought us away from the
[30:06] busy world into the house of prayer this
[30:09] evening. We just thank you that there's
[30:11] a group that believes all your word. We
[30:13] pray that you would bless each one.
[30:15] Lord, I don't know everybody's problem
[30:17] here, but I know you and I know that you
[30:19] sent me with these words. We pray that
[30:21] he'd be a blessing to everyone and
[30:23] everybody could take something home with
[30:25] him. Bless Pastor Paul where he is
[30:27] tonight. Protect him. Keep us Lord in
[30:31] the center of your hand. We ask in Jesus
[30:33] name. Amen. You may be seated.
[30:41] All through scripture, we find in the
[30:44] year of or in the year that a certain
[30:46] king died and uh in the month and the
[30:49] year and sometimes very specific dates.
[30:53] And now that we have everything, you
[30:55] know, computerized and have everything,
[30:57] you know, at our fingertips, they have
[31:00] discovered the Bible is right. There's
[31:02] all kinds of scientific evidence, you
[31:04] know, and so on this earth, we live by
[31:07] the calendar and by the clock. It's
[31:09] ticking even as we speak.
[31:12] And if you behave will be up before
[31:14] midnight.
[31:18] But um
[31:20] everything that is, everything that has
[31:22] been, everything that will be, it's all
[31:24] governed by the word of God, by
[31:27] prophecy. God is in total control.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; Don't you think for a minute that God
[31:33] isn't aware? You see, with our God,
[31:36] there's no surprises. He knows exactly
[31:38] what's happening. He's watching every
[31:40] life. He's watching his seed,
[31:42] especially. So, I'm only here to remind
[31:45] you of what has been spoken. There's no
[31:47] shortcuts. There's no magic way to get
[31:50] to heaven. You must start at the foot of
[31:52] the cross.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, right here in this Bible is
[31:56] our road map, our book of directions.
[32:00] And God has sent us a vindicated prophet
[32:03] to make it clear to us, bring certain
[32:05] things to our remembrance because we had
[32:08] the Bible for 500 years, but certain
[32:11] things had to be made real for today.
[32:13] You see, so here we are in what is it?
[32:16] It's already September. Uh we can't go
[32:20] back the way it used to be.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; I'm all for our president. He's he's
[32:23] doing good, but all he's doing is
[32:25] resetting the thermostat a little bit.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; It's still going to burn.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; We're not going back. Damon and Andy are
[32:30] back to Andy Griffin. No, no, it's going
[32:32] this way, you know. And so, uh, we can't
[32:36] go to the sides. We got to go forward.
[32:39] So, the fact is that the clock keeps
[32:43] ticking, ticking, ticking, and
[32:46] everything we deal with is
[32:47] timesensitive.
[32:49] So, um, as the time ticks by, we really
[32:53] need to be making serious preparations
[32:55] for the catching away of the bride of
[32:57] Christ. Because the Bible says in
[32:59] Revelation 19:7, "His wife hath made
[33:02] herself ready." That doesn't mean she's
[33:04] sitting on the porch waiting for some.
[33:05] No, she's doing she's doing she's
[33:08] listening. She's getting ready. Okay.
[33:11] So, in the getting ready, now some of
[33:13] you don't know who I am, but that's not
[33:14] important. But you're going to hear some
[33:16] things that you've heard before because
[33:18] when you get to my age, it's okay to
[33:20] repeat yourself, you know. But listen,
[33:23] might be something you need. Excuse me.
[33:27] So, in getting ready, there's four
[33:28] things you're going to keep in mind and
[33:30] put in practice every day
[33:33] &gt;&gt; all the way from the youngest to a buddy
[33:35] here to all of us. Okay? One, you read
[33:38] at least one chapter out of your Bible
[33:40] every day.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; That's not hard to do. You got to make
[33:44] time for it. Read one chapter. You
[33:46] listen to at least 20 minutes of God's
[33:48] prophet. You read one page out of the
[33:50] church age book and you pray at all
[33:53] times. like when you're stuck in
[33:54] traffic, when things aren't going right,
[33:56] just settle down and pray.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; God answers prayer. Okay? So, that's the
[34:01] four items you must remember. Brother
[34:04] Brandham says, "Prayer changes things.
[34:06] Prayer changes death to life." We've
[34:08] seen it. Prayer changes sickness to
[34:10] health, changes sinners to saints. It's
[34:13] prayer. You might laugh too much. You
[34:15] might shout too much. You might eat too
[34:17] much, but you will never pray too much.
[34:21] So Paul says over in 1 Timothy, I will
[34:24] therefore that men pray everywhere,
[34:26] lifting up holy hands without wrath or
[34:28] doubting. So we can never pray too much.
[34:32] Okay? You might do a lot of other
[34:34] things. And so as we implement these
[34:36] four steps in our daily routine, you'll
[34:39] have peace in your home guaranteed.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; And uh you'll stay in contact with your
[34:45] heavenly father
[34:46] &gt;&gt; and you'll be preparing for the rapture.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. and you'd be a whole lot easier to
[34:50] preach to instead of coming here with
[34:53] all your stuff and fuzzes. No, leave all
[34:55] that out there.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Come prayed up. You see, so today, every
[34:58] one of us is on a journey. Okay, where
[35:01] are we going? We're going to the gate of
[35:03] the resurrection. It's closer than it
[35:05] was last week. Okay, but there's many
[35:08] distractions along the way. It's like
[35:10] when you drive somewhere, there's all
[35:12] these signs. No, we got to get there,
[35:14] you see. And so, um, how do we remain
[35:17] focused and, uh, you know, on the goal
[35:20] and not wander off on the side roads?
[35:22] Well, because we have a we have a voice
[35:23] on the dash or on your phone. You know,
[35:27] that's called GPS, but that really means
[35:29] God's positioning system.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; God knows where you are.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; Yes. I
[35:34] &gt;&gt; mean, he can see us better than that
[35:35] girl on the on the phone. I mean, she
[35:37] can see through the dark and through the
[35:38] rain. That's fine. But God knows where
[35:40] you are every minute. See? And so it's a
[35:43] magnetic pole that pulls us towards the
[35:45] word of God. And that's why we have our
[35:47] hope in the resurrection.
[35:50] Now, brother Random says it's the
[35:53] cardinal resting place of the gospel. No
[35:55] matter what he did, if he did not raise
[35:57] again from the dead, then all of it was
[35:59] in vain.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; It proves to me that he was God. So you
[36:03] see, just with that one statement, I
[36:04] don't have any time to argue with some
[36:06] of my friends that Jesus wasn't God.
[36:09] Well, then what are you doing? you're
[36:10] wasting your time. You know, Jesus was
[36:12] God. And I think it's the great
[36:14] coronation of the full gospel is the
[36:16] resurrection and its divine promises.
[36:19] So to my opinion, the resurrection is
[36:22] the greatest of all the promises in the
[36:24] things in the scripture.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; And Paul says over here in First
[36:27] Corinthians, if in this life only we
[36:29] have hope in Christ, we're of all men
[36:32] most miserable because we're we're just
[36:34] we're going through blindly. No, we have
[36:36] directions. We have things that are
[36:38] coming to pass. God is in control.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Ramon had great admiration
[36:43] for Paul. If you if you read the
[36:45] Churches book, he was the first one. It
[36:48] set the norm for the rest of them. And
[36:50] um one of the key statements for today,
[36:55] yeah, September 25 is Galatians 1:8.
[36:58] Because Paul had been through this area
[37:01] and he had baptized some people and now
[37:04] he's coming back to visit and some
[37:06] legalists, some some wise guys had come
[37:08] in there and said, "Well, Paul's okay."
[37:10] But see, you got to do it this way.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Paul said that is a perversion of the
[37:15] gospel. Amen.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; If I come back next week or if you know,
[37:19] brother Poe or George or William Bremer,
[37:21] whoever comes, if an angel comes down
[37:24] and preaches anything different than
[37:25] what I've already given you by
[37:26] revelation,
[37:27] &gt;&gt; going to the hot place.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; That's simple.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; So, we're not playing games.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[37:33] &gt;&gt; So, there is a resurrection for those
[37:35] who have surrendered their entire life
[37:38] to Jesus Christ and can say amen to all
[37:40] the word, not just their favorite parts
[37:43] and and repeating what somebody said.
[37:45] No, it's got to be all the word. You
[37:47] see, anybody can read and repeat, but
[37:49] only a few can take it really serious.
[37:52] Okay? All others will continue to play
[37:54] church, and the day after the
[37:56] resurrection, guess what? This church
[37:58] will be full. All the churches will be
[38:00] full of people. Oh, wow. It was serious.
[38:03] Well, a little bit too late.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; So, let's take advantage of the time we
[38:07] have. Okay?
[38:09] And um so as believers in God's word, we
[38:12] come from a long line of travelers.
[38:14] Remember our title, our journey, the
[38:18] hope of the resurrection. And so we have
[38:20] the children of Israel, for example,
[38:22] that traveled for 40 years. They enjoyed
[38:24] many, many blessings of God, uh had
[38:27] daily provisions, healing, their shoes
[38:30] didn't wear out, all kinds of blessings.
[38:33] But their journey was characterized by
[38:34] unbelief
[38:36] because they they they enjoyed all that
[38:39] but they didn't take it serious.
[38:41] Um Abraham for example traveled about
[38:44] 500 miles from Haran down to Hebron and
[38:47] his trip was characterized by faith. He
[38:50] didn't know where he's going. Just
[38:51] following God, you know. And then we
[38:53] have Eleazar, his helper. He retraced
[38:56] those same 500 miles to go and find a
[38:59] bride for the master's son.
[39:01] He was accompanied by an angel and his
[39:04] journey was characterized by success.
[39:07] Then we have Mary and Joseph. They
[39:10] traveled about 90 miles from Nazareth
[39:14] down to Bethlehem obeying the law. But
[39:17] of course today we have people that they
[39:19] would they would pay money and get a
[39:20] free pass and well you know because
[39:22] she's pregnant or whatever. No, they
[39:24] obeyed the law you know. And so they
[39:26] went down there under difficult
[39:28] circumstances, but you know, God's clock
[39:30] is ticking. There's no shortcuts.
[39:33] There's no excuses.
[39:34] And there's of course many more that we
[39:36] could go into, but we we've got uh you
[39:38] know, only got 50 minutes left here. And
[39:41] so um the most difficult journey was
[39:44] taken by Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[39:47] They began up in Cesaria Philippi.
[39:50] That's the northernmost point of Israel
[39:52] that they visited. And that's where they
[39:56] were in Matthew 16
[39:59] when he asked the disciples, "Well, who
[40:00] do you all say I am?" Well, that
[40:02] happened up there. Then they started
[40:04] south. Okay? And so as they go south, um
[40:08] they um traveled u about 140 miles down
[40:12] to Jerusalem. Now, these numbers could
[40:14] be off, so don't you know, now I want to
[40:17] tell you something. This see this level
[40:18] is here to remind me to stay level with
[40:20] what I'm saying. But it's got another
[40:22] purpose
[40:24] if I see anybody even thinking about
[40:26] going to sleep.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So,
[40:30] &gt;&gt; amen.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; That's the first warning. So, they came
[40:33] down to Jerusalem and then they went
[40:36] across the Kidron Valley over to
[40:38] Gethsemane with his disciples. That's
[40:40] about 600 yards.
[40:43] Then back over to Jerusalem as a
[40:44] prisoner to the private cell in the
[40:47] house of the high priest Kosis about 700
[40:49] yards. It's all very small over there.
[40:52] Then they went out to Pilot's judgment
[40:53] hall condemned without a proper trial
[40:56] about 500 yards. All walking, you know,
[40:59] people making fun. Then over to Calvary
[41:02] as a convict
[41:04] total of about a mile and a half. That
[41:07] was the most difficult journey. And
[41:10] there at Calvary,
[41:13] they're the the most religious people on
[41:15] the planet.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; They couldn't see that this was the
[41:19] fulfillment of the scriptures they had
[41:21] memorized back here.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; They didn't have a New Testament, okay?
[41:24] That wouldn't written yet, but they had
[41:25] a Bible. It was 200 years old at the
[41:27] time. And they couldn't understand that
[41:29] this was the fulfillment. And they
[41:32] crucified the lamb of God. And it was
[41:34] all done according to words of prophets
[41:37] for the benefit of the purchase of
[41:39] Calvary, you and me.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; That's what he went for. You see, we're
[41:43] the predestinated seed of God throughout
[41:45] seven ages. So, our journey today is
[41:49] from right here in dark lessa. Now, it's
[41:51] hard to believe that it's dark lessa
[41:53] when we have $50,000 cars. We got a
[41:56] $1,000 phone and all the benefits of
[41:58] Leosa,
[41:59] &gt;&gt; but it's dark.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. Now, a long time ago in 1959,
[42:06] Brother Brandham was preaching in the um
[42:09] islands of the Caribbean. And so, there
[42:12] were some Americans with him. And one of
[42:14] the Americans later testified that
[42:16] during that time they were down there
[42:18] for several weeks. And then he spent
[42:19] four hours one day with brother
[42:20] Brandham. And he asked him, uh, why do
[42:23] you say so much about 1977?
[42:26] Okay, any genius can see that was 18
[42:28] years ahead. And so, uh, Brother
[42:31] Brandham said, "Well, when I was looking
[42:32] through the stream of time, in other
[42:34] words, he's seeing numbers." He said,
[42:35] "By the time it got to 77, it was so
[42:38] dark spiritually. I didn't see how
[42:40] anybody could live in that darkness."
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Now, we're over 40 years the other side.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; It's very dark.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; When we have all kinds of things going
[42:50] on and people joining up and people
[42:52] making fun, all these things, all these
[42:54] things are going on. But God is
[42:56] preparing a bride
[42:57] &gt;&gt; with the word for this day. Okay. Okay.
[43:01] So,
[43:04] as we're experiencing the darkness of
[43:06] Leadyia, remember the words of Jesus in
[43:08] Matthew or where in John 17:20 when he's
[43:11] praying for the disciples. And he says
[43:13] in his prayer, and I don't pray just for
[43:15] these sitting here, but I'm praying for
[43:17] those over there in Tucson. I'm praying
[43:19] for those way out there that would
[43:20] believe on me by their word. And that's
[43:23] what we have a New Testament for. We
[43:25] have their word and we believe
[43:28] &gt;&gt; and it's doing something in our lives
[43:30] and we're glad that we have a church to
[43:31] come to. That's right.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; We're not under a tree somewhere, you
[43:34] know.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, we were on his mind before he
[43:38] ever went to the cross.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says here and speak to the
[43:42] rock. Now, we're going to talk about a
[43:43] journey how that God brought his people
[43:45] out of Egypt into the promised land. A
[43:48] perfect type of leaving sin coming into
[43:51] the spirit land. Now there's three
[43:52] stages of the journey. Israel in Egypt,
[43:56] Israel in the journey, and Israel in the
[43:59] Palestine, the promised land. He says,
[44:01] which are all a perfect type of
[44:03] justification by faith coming out. Other
[44:06] words, good people, but they're in sin.
[44:08] Now they're coming out. Two,
[44:10] sanctification as they pass through the
[44:12] blood, you know, on our journey. And
[44:15] three, the baptism of the Holy Spirit,
[44:16] entering into rest. Now that is just the
[44:21] gospel. Okay. So it's perfectly the
[44:23] stages of the church. That is where the
[44:25] church is staged now. Okay. Some today
[44:30] are in the journey. They're coming out.
[44:32] They're passing through. They're they're
[44:33] they're in justification. We're not
[44:35] going to look down on them. We were
[44:37] there one time. It's a journey. You see,
[44:39] others are going through the blood,
[44:41] through the process of redemption and
[44:43] sanctification. And others are resting
[44:46] in the Holy Spirit. We all together are
[44:48] the church. You see,
[44:50] &gt;&gt; all forming the church of Jesus Christ
[44:52] in this journey to the resurrection.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; So, we're making progress. We're
[44:57] marching forward. Now, we're into
[44:59] redemption and completeness. 1954. Now,
[45:03] we are moved by the Holy Spirit in going
[45:05] now into the promised land. In my
[45:07] father's house are many mansions. If it
[45:09] were not true, I would have told you, I
[45:10] go to prepare a place for you. Is that
[45:13] right? Now, we have a promised land that
[45:16] we're going to see. Each day marks a
[45:19] milestone.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; We're not the same person we were last
[45:23] Sunday.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; We either ate too much or we we did a
[45:26] lot of things, but now we're here. You
[45:28] see, another day, another milestone. And
[45:31] there's a big dark shadow setting right
[45:33] out before us. It's called death. And
[45:36] every time our heart beats, we move one
[45:38] step closer to that. One of these days,
[45:41] it's going to take its last beat. We're
[45:43] going in. I want to be at my time. Now,
[45:46] for those of you that aren't from
[45:47] Kentucky, that means I want to be ready,
[45:49] okay? As I hope each one of you is
[45:52] tonight. When I know that it's lying
[45:54] just before me and I have to meet it, I
[45:56] don't want to be a coward. I want to
[45:58] wrap myself in the robe of his
[45:59] righteousness, walking into it, knowing
[46:02] this, that I'm sure that I know him in
[46:05] the power of his resurrection. And when
[46:07] he calls from among the dead, I'll be
[46:09] called out with him that's living. God
[46:11] is God of the living.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; And that's one of the differences
[46:14] between us and the Catholic Church and a
[46:16] few others. God is God of the living.
[46:18] We're going someplace. You know,
[46:21] &gt;&gt; okay, another place, God has a provided
[46:24] way. 1956.
[46:25] I imagine when the ages roll on, he will
[46:28] just still be better all the time. When
[46:30] we look back and we see what God has
[46:32] brought us out of, brought us through,
[46:34] brought us into, you know, the three
[46:35] stages we just talked about. The
[46:37] Christian life is a journey. This here
[46:40] is a pilgrimage and we're just passing
[46:42] through this land. We're not going to
[46:44] stay here. You know, many times we build
[46:46] a house and we say, "Well, the family
[46:48] and I will will anchor down here." But
[46:50] for how long? You don't know.
[46:53] If you look, check the records. Not
[46:55] everybody dies at 95 years old.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; You don't know how long you're here.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Okay? And so, um, we always would like
[47:04] to get to a place where we can say,
[47:05] "This is ours for good." But it isn't
[47:07] here on earth. We don't have such a
[47:09] place here on earth. But there is
[47:10] something in you that calls out for such
[47:12] a place.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; And before there could be anything in
[47:15] you calling out for that place, that
[47:17] place has to be in existence.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; I mean, it's very simple formula or
[47:21] there would be nothing here to call for
[47:22] it. The deep cannot call to the deep
[47:25] unless there's a deep to respond to it.
[47:27] So there has to be a place first to make
[47:29] this deep call out to it. Very simple.
[47:33] Okay. Now in the message communion 1962,
[47:36] he's in prayer. He says, 'We want to
[47:38] keep under the blood at all times, for
[47:41] we don't know just what might happen.
[47:44] All things are about wound up.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; We feel, Lord, that the coming of the
[47:48] Lord is at hand. And we're fixing to
[47:50] take a journey. We're in the journey
[47:52] now. Okay. Um we're fixing to take a
[47:56] journey. And as we think of a journey,
[47:57] we might think of suitcases and extra
[47:59] clothing and extra shoes. But how
[48:01] different is this journey? It's not
[48:03] packing up. It's unpacking, laying
[48:04] aside. As your great servant Paul said
[48:07] in the book of Hebrews, we lay aside
[48:10] every weight of unbelief that so easily
[48:12] besets us that we might run with
[48:14] patience the race that is set before us.
[48:17] So on this journey we have three kinds
[48:19] of believers. Now I didn't make this up.
[48:22] Brother Ram said in every congregation
[48:23] there's three kinds of believers. And as
[48:26] you look around you can probably you
[48:28] know come to your human conclusion. Well
[48:31] we know which one she is and we know who
[48:33] he is. Who are you?
[48:36] &gt;&gt; That's the question. You see, so the
[48:39] word is preached equally. No
[48:41] discrimination. Word goes out. But you
[48:44] see, church is like a hospital. Nobody
[48:46] checked your papers at the door. You
[48:48] come in, the word ministers to you. And
[48:50] and the word decides who gets to stay
[48:53] and who has to leave. You see, so the
[48:56] makebeliever and the unbeliever are just
[48:58] along temporarily. Okay?
[49:01] um they kind of enjoy the free ride
[49:03] because they have very little invested.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Some of them don't pay tithe. They come
[49:08] when they feel like it. They drag in 20
[49:10] minutes late.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; That's the make believer and the
[49:12] unbeliever. No, you got to be got to be
[49:14] serious.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; So soon they will jump off because they
[49:17] can't handle the pressure,
[49:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Or the responsibility of the preaching
[49:22] of the word. They want a real simple way
[49:24] to just push the button, you know, sit
[49:26] there in your pajamas. That's not
[49:27] church. No, let's be serious.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; So now they look like believers, uh, but
[49:34] they're impersonators, okay? They can
[49:36] quote, but they can't live it. So don't
[49:39] waste your time judging people, okay?
[49:42] God knows who are his and he will take
[49:44] care of the separating at the right time
[49:47] and he'll take care of the rewards. He
[49:49] knows what he's doing and he doesn't
[49:52] need our canary brain to try to figure
[49:54] it out.
[49:56] Scripture says in what is it? Psalms
[49:58] 46:10, "Be still. I'm God. Don't need
[50:01] your opinions."
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But the true believer feeds every
[50:06] day on the word of God. He loves it
[50:08] because it's his life source along the
[50:10] way.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; He stays in tune. He stays in step in
[50:13] the correct atmosphere. And he stays
[50:15] balanced.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; You don't want to hear that sound again,
[50:19] do you?
[50:19] &gt;&gt; No. Okay, I'll be nice. The scripture
[50:23] says in Romans 3:23, "All have sinned
[50:25] and come short of the glory of God."
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. The preachers's kids, brother
[50:30] Brandham's family, all the Brandhams,
[50:32] all the Smiths, everyone has sinned and
[50:34] come short of the glory of God. And none
[50:36] of us were born angels or perfect human
[50:40] beings. Now, I've got grandchildren. I
[50:42] know all about it. But you see,
[50:45] scripture says we're born in sin, shaped
[50:47] iniquity, come to the world speaking
[50:48] lies. But in John chapter 3, we have the
[50:53] solution. We get a glimpse of the three
[50:55] kinds of believers. Because in 3:16, for
[50:58] God so loved the world. Now, you see, a
[51:00] lot of people carrying spoken word
[51:02] books, they want to just kind of
[51:04] sidestep John 3:16. Well, that's for
[51:06] Billy Graham. No, that's for every child
[51:08] of God.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; If you don't start your journey at the
[51:11] foot of the cross, you're not going
[51:12] anywhere.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; So, God so loved the world. Who's that?
[51:16] All those that came short of the glory
[51:18] of God. and he freely gave his only
[51:20] begotten son which is the only solution.
[51:23] And then here comes the choice that
[51:25] whosoever believeth on him should not
[51:27] perish but have everlasting life. Okay.
[51:31] But then we get into 17 and 18 that a
[51:33] lot of people forget
[51:35] where it says for God sent not his son
[51:37] into the world to condemn the world but
[51:40] that the world through him might be
[51:42] saved. It's the only solution.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Not this other stuff. No, through Jesus
[51:47] Christ. Verse 18, he that believeth on
[51:50] him is not condemned. Thank you. But he
[51:53] that believeth not is condemned already.
[51:57] Why? Because he has not believed in the
[51:59] name of the only begotten son of God.
[52:03] And if I come back someday and we'll go
[52:05] into the book of Acts, that was the
[52:06] problem all through the book of Acts.
[52:08] They didn't mind the miracles. They
[52:10] didn't mind the the the the loaves and
[52:12] fishes and all these other things, but
[52:14] just don't mention that name. And that's
[52:17] the problem today. They want to steer
[52:19] away from the name, but that's the
[52:20] foundation of the gospel. Okay? So,
[52:23] there's definitely hope for the
[52:24] believer, those that make the right
[52:26] choice. Now, in our journey, when we're
[52:30] going to an unfamiliar place, uh you're
[52:33] going to go on vacation, maybe you
[52:34] haven't been there before. Oh, well, I'd
[52:35] like to go there. Well, you got to have
[52:37] a map.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Right?
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Now, it used to be all you people, you
[52:40] know, uh over 50, you remember there was
[52:43] a map book. Well, it's in alphabetical
[52:45] order. So you start in Arizona
[52:48] &gt;&gt; and you want to go to Texas. Well, it's
[52:49] way down there, you know, and so you
[52:52] have to uh check New Mexico and
[52:54] everything else, but u now we have an
[52:56] electronic map and we have a voice to
[52:58] guide us every step. So in this journey,
[53:01] God has drawn the lines. He's
[53:02] highlighted certain certain verses for
[53:05] this time.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; We're not building an ark. We're not
[53:09] going to walk across the desert. No, we
[53:11] have certain verses that are of interest
[53:13] and uh the promises for this time
[53:17] &gt;&gt; and all you have to do is study the map.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; And our prophet said, "Read your Bible
[53:22] and pray."
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; It's real simple.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; It's two of the steps. Remember, there's
[53:28] four.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Paul will probably come down
[53:31] here and, you know, ask you what the
[53:33] four steps were.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, pay attention. Okay. So you
[53:39] just simply have to recognize where you
[53:40] are in the plan of God. You see,
[53:43] recognize the signs around you. He will
[53:45] quicken the truth to you.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; And God has even provided a voice on the
[53:50] desk. Everything William Brandon said is
[53:52] on every cell phone on the planet
[53:54] &gt;&gt; in more than one language.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; You have no excuse. You see,
[53:58] &gt;&gt; so along the way, we have certain
[54:00] regrets, but we can't change the past.
[54:03] It's gone. You can't go back and change
[54:06] that. You see, the only thing you can do
[54:08] is repent
[54:09] &gt;&gt; and ask for the blood of Jesus Christ to
[54:11] cleanse you from all unrighteousness and
[54:13] correct the attitude.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; See, anybody can can read and repeat.
[54:18] But what about the attitude? You see,
[54:20] &gt;&gt; so um we have over here, you know, for
[54:25] the present, God gives us breath today
[54:27] in order to make decisions which will
[54:29] affect our future. We already know about
[54:32] the mistakes we made, you know, we don't
[54:33] need to be reminded. uh we'll just
[54:36] consider that to be a learning process.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; We don't repeat the same mistakes.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; A mistake is one thing, but if it
[54:44] continues, it's a bad habit,
[54:46] &gt;&gt; which alerts you to the fact that you're
[54:48] anointed with an evil spirit,
[54:50] &gt;&gt; and you have a besetting sin.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; I don't know your life, but for some
[54:55] reason, we're going to go through this.
[54:56] You see, and so you need to genuinely
[54:59] repent, ask for prayer, get yourself in
[55:01] the influence, under the influence and
[55:04] the anointing of God's word,
[55:06] into a correct spiritual atmosphere.
[55:10] God's bride makes herself ready. All the
[55:13] rest don't care.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; They're doing what they do. They think
[55:16] they're right, you know, but God's bride
[55:18] is making herself ready. So, in today's
[55:20] lesson, we're simply attempting to
[55:22] remind you of the truth. Not here to
[55:25] condemn, but just to face the facts.
[55:29] Okay? And brother Po didn't know I was
[55:32] going to be here. I called him Monday
[55:33] and I told him I was going to come down
[55:35] and fellowship. You're going to be here
[55:36] Wednesday. Well, guess what? He already
[55:38] had his ticket. He was already on the
[55:39] way out of town. Oh, this will work
[55:41] fine. So, God works things out, you
[55:44] know. So, Brother Ram very simply said,
[55:47] "We have tapes on that. We've got tapes
[55:49] on what we believe
[55:50] &gt;&gt; and we've been listening for a long
[55:52] time, but we never needed anybody to
[55:54] tell us what tape and what.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; No.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Where's the spirit of God in all this
[55:58] mess, you know? So, as a bride, those on
[56:02] the journey here in 2025,
[56:04] it would be to your advantage to follow
[56:07] the four steps. Okay? That way, you stay
[56:10] in tune and you stay in step with God's
[56:12] program. Now, according to Philippians
[56:14] 4:7, we can actually have the peace that
[56:17] goes beyond all understanding. You don't
[56:19] have to stay up at night, you know,
[56:21] drinking coffee and figuring it all out.
[56:23] You can have the peace that passes all
[56:25] understanding.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Now, very few people know how all these
[56:28] nice cars work. Okay? Some do. I don't.
[56:32] I know you push the button and we go,
[56:34] but so I understand to a certain point,
[56:36] but God's peace goes beyond that. You
[56:38] see? So, it goes beyond the
[56:41] understanding. It goes beyond the
[56:43] criticism, the religious fanaticism,
[56:45] legalism, and that godly peace will keep
[56:48] your heart and mind through Christ
[56:50] Jesus. Okay. Paul also wrote in the
[56:53] early to the early church in Rome in
[56:56] chapter 8:e 16, the spirit himself bears
[56:59] witness with our spirit that we are the
[57:01] children of God. And if children, then
[57:03] heirs, heirs of God, joints with Christ.
[57:06] If so be that we suffer with him, that
[57:08] we may be also glorified together. For I
[57:11] reckon that the sufferings of this
[57:12] present time. Now, we all have things
[57:14] we're dealing with. You know, I reckon
[57:17] that the sufferings of this present time
[57:19] are not worthy to be compared with the
[57:21] glory which shall be revealed in us.
[57:23] It's going to be a lot better than
[57:24] anything you can imagine. So, not only
[57:27] in Christ will the glory be revealed.
[57:29] Not only in the prophet our age will the
[57:31] word uh be made alive, but in us, in you
[57:35] and me, we are the flesh and blood
[57:37] believers of 2025. People are looking at
[57:40] us to see if Hebrews 13:8 is still
[57:42] alive.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; And we have Galatians 1:8 as our as our
[57:46] guide so that people can see Hebrews
[57:49] 13:8. You see, so as we make this
[57:51] journey, we have ups and downs,
[57:53] sufferings, rejoicing, victories, and so
[57:55] forth. But it's the minister's duty
[58:00] to encourage and remind us and keep the
[58:02] people focused on the present truth.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; That's his job. the scriptures that
[58:07] pertain to the hour that we're living in
[58:09] our current Bible promises. But you read
[58:12] all the word because it's all for our
[58:14] admonition, you know. So over here in
[58:16] this tape, discernment of spirit 1960 in
[58:19] Phoenix, I think it is
[58:22] a great uh prayer that he has here. And
[58:25] we're here this morning, Father,
[58:27] gathered for no other purpose but to
[58:29] know and to study to know rather the
[58:32] will of God and what we must do to make
[58:35] Christ real to the people of this
[58:37] generation.
[58:39] That's what brother Brandham did. He had
[58:41] a way of making it real to us. If he's
[58:44] just telling us about a a simple uh
[58:47] story in the Bible, but it came alive.
[58:50] And that's our job today. make Christ
[58:52] real to the people of this generation,
[58:54] knowing surely that in the day of the
[58:56] judgment, we will be brought face to
[58:58] face with this generation. And being
[59:00] ministers, we will be judges. And those
[59:02] people to which we have spoken and their
[59:05] attitude towards the word that we bring
[59:07] to them will determine their eternal
[59:09] destination. Your attitude,
[59:12] &gt;&gt; we only preach the word freely, no
[59:14] discrimination, but then your attitude
[59:16] will determine your destination.
[59:18] Therefore, Lord, in that day, we'll be a
[59:19] judge for or against the generation that
[59:22] we preach to. So, when we travel, we
[59:25] have to make preparations. You all know
[59:27] that. We got to check the schedules. We
[59:28] got to plan ahead. And God is not the
[59:31] author of confusion. No, no, no. You get
[59:34] there late, you're not going. So, he's
[59:36] very organized. He's very much on
[59:37] schedule. And um in the tape, uh what is
[59:41] it? his wonders to perform 1958. God in
[59:44] his great wise providence moves every
[59:47] cog just to hit at the right time. And
[59:50] that gives us faith. Sometimes we think,
[59:52] "Oh, everything's just topsyturvy.
[59:54] There's no way out of this mess." Don't
[59:56] think that God is making it all work
[59:58] exactly to his time program.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; It is working to his program. Might not
[1:00:04] be according to your program or people
[1:00:06] out there, but it's God's program.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:00:09] now and he knows exactly the schedule
[1:00:13] and everything is coming down right on
[1:00:15] time.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Now Moses
[1:00:18] lived 40 years in Egypt because he was
[1:00:20] in a basket in the water and a pagan
[1:00:23] princess drew him out of the water and
[1:00:25] gave him the name Moses. Now that was
[1:00:27] directed by God obviously you know and
[1:00:30] so he was one step from the throne. He
[1:00:33] had servants. He didn't have to do
[1:00:35] anything. Just he snapped his fingers.
[1:00:36] Everything happened, you know, and so a
[1:00:39] lot of luxury but uh he was on a
[1:00:41] journey.
[1:00:43] Okay. The this great servant Moses 1955.
[1:00:46] Now Moses after taking the situation in
[1:00:48] his own hand found that he was total
[1:00:51] failure. And what's he talking about?
[1:00:53] Because he was convinced that he was the
[1:00:55] deliverer and he had to free the the
[1:00:58] people out of bondage. So he's going to
[1:00:59] kill these Egyptians one at a time.
[1:01:02] Well, total failure. He ran from the
[1:01:05] presence of Pharaoh, ran from the
[1:01:07] presence of God and was a stranger for
[1:01:09] 40 years back there.
[1:01:12] And he married an Ethiopian girl and so
[1:01:15] she had a lot of temper who and Moses
[1:01:18] had a lot of temper.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:01:21] prophet says, I would just imagine
[1:01:23] things weren't so peaceful back there on
[1:01:24] the back side of the desert at times. In
[1:01:27] other words, it was tough. Maybe not
[1:01:29] always pleasant,
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; but it was God's program.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; He goes on, "Now, if you think you
[1:01:34] married a woman that has a little bit of
[1:01:36] temper,
[1:01:38] nobody said, "Amen."
[1:01:41] Scared.
[1:01:43] If you think you married a woman that
[1:01:45] has a little bit of temper, maybe God is
[1:01:46] trying to tame you down a little bit and
[1:01:49] vice versa.
[1:01:51] Okay, now we'll stop there for a minute.
[1:01:54] you know, uh, when people start getting
[1:01:56] attracted to each other and they think
[1:01:57] they're going to get married and all
[1:01:58] that. Well, in Spanish, we say you found
[1:02:00] the other half orange, you know, perfect
[1:02:03] fit. And so, we we have this idea of
[1:02:06] 50/50.
[1:02:08] But, see, if you're thinking 50/50, then
[1:02:10] when you put your head on the pillow at
[1:02:11] night, that's
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Thinking who won? Did I win? Did she
[1:02:14] win?
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Okay, the better formula is 8020. You
[1:02:19] give 80%. Give everything expecting 20.
[1:02:23] Then she's doing the same thing. And you
[1:02:25] meet in the middle. Perfect. Okay.
[1:02:29] And then out there, what was God doing?
[1:02:31] Schooling into the man's mind what the
[1:02:34] program of God was.
[1:02:37] Wow. Just imagine God using a highteered
[1:02:40] woman to speak some sense into his
[1:02:43] mighty prophet.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Moses and all the prophets were humans.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Okay. Moses was back there waiting,
[1:02:52] hurting sheep out in the desert. There's
[1:02:54] a perfect picture here before us tonight
[1:02:56] of a believer out of fellowship with
[1:02:58] God. Now, see, we wouldn't want to think
[1:03:00] about that about Moses. He was human. He
[1:03:02] was out of fellowship with God for 40
[1:03:04] years.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; He was in the palace for 40 years. Now,
[1:03:07] he's got to take all got to erase those
[1:03:09] 40 years before you can use him at 80
[1:03:10] years old. So, here they are living on
[1:03:13] the desert and just like here, the wind
[1:03:16] blows, dirt comes in. They didn't have a
[1:03:19] nice sealed place with air conditioning.
[1:03:21] And so she's trying to keep the place
[1:03:23] clean. Her name was Zapora.
[1:03:26] And he's out there watching the
[1:03:27] father-in-law's sheep. Now sheep are
[1:03:30] very uh
[1:03:32] docile and very peaceful animals, but
[1:03:36] they smell.
[1:03:38] So he's out there with these sheep all
[1:03:39] day long. And he comes in. He's tired.
[1:03:43] And what's she What do you think? She
[1:03:44] said, "Moses, shoes, please.
[1:03:48] at the door. The same thing every day.
[1:03:52] Nobody told him what to do in the
[1:03:53] palace. You know, this is different. So,
[1:03:56] he had to take the shoes off. Well, then
[1:03:58] one day he's out there and he sees this
[1:04:00] bush burning. Now, he never seen that
[1:04:02] before. So, he gets a little closer. He
[1:04:04] gets closer to the to the bush and all
[1:04:06] of a sudden, Moses, yes, sir.
[1:04:11] Take off your shoes.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; See, he had heard that before. God was
[1:04:15] schooling into the man's mind.
[1:04:19] So there he was, no fellowship. Not one
[1:04:21] thing in 40 years have spoken that God
[1:04:24] did for him. He was out of fellowship.
[1:04:26] And when the church gets out of
[1:04:28] fellowship with God, miracles cease,
[1:04:30] signs and wonders cease, revival cease,
[1:04:32] God just moves right on when you get out
[1:04:34] of fellowship. Now the thing to do, in
[1:04:36] other words, to remedy the situation is
[1:04:39] to keep the love of God in your heart.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah, but they said this and he said
[1:04:44] that and that other church over there.
[1:04:45] No, real simple. Keep the love of God in
[1:04:49] your heart.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Keep fellowship with him. And he will
[1:04:52] add these other things as we mature.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Now, there's probably, you know,
[1:04:58] children here under 15 that would love
[1:05:00] to have the keys to the car,
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; but it's not going to happen. as they
[1:05:04] mature, as we can trust them. I mean, I
[1:05:08] raised three kids and I remember telling
[1:05:09] them years ago, I'm going to trust you
[1:05:11] until you give me a reason not to, you
[1:05:13] know. And so, we have t people today,
[1:05:16] they they get in the Bible, oh, look
[1:05:18] what it says here. They hear brother Ram
[1:05:20] say certain things. Well, see, now
[1:05:21] that's today. I'm the man or whatever.
[1:05:24] Making plans for the future, and they
[1:05:26] don't know what they're talking about.
[1:05:28] Just today, I had a big argument. not in
[1:05:30] an argument, but he was asking me, "What
[1:05:31] about the about the millennium?" Okay,
[1:05:34] we got a few things here about the
[1:05:35] millennium, but it's only for those that
[1:05:36] are mature enough to get there.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; We don't need that information now.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; We need to get to the resurrection.
[1:05:44] Don't worry about the rest of it.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; As we've matured and so Moses out of
[1:05:48] fellowship, no fellowship out there in a
[1:05:50] strange country among strangers, not his
[1:05:52] own people. She was Ethiopian. He was a
[1:05:54] Jew. completely out of the reach of God
[1:05:56] seemingly and God all the time knowing
[1:05:59] that no matter how much of a mess man
[1:06:01] makes out of the program of God is going
[1:06:03] to straighten it out.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; So you see there is hope.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Okay. So in traveling we must be aware
[1:06:10] of the dress code. I know it's kind of
[1:06:12] hard to believe for some people but you
[1:06:14] know it used to be that there was a
[1:06:17] difference between men and women's
[1:06:18] clothing. I spend a lot of time in the
[1:06:21] airport and I see every kind of
[1:06:22] perversion you can imagine including the
[1:06:24] tattoos everywhere. We live in a
[1:06:27] perverse world.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Rammit addressed that also
[1:06:33] because in 1964
[1:06:36] he said if this goes on the way it is
[1:06:38] right now or whatever he was focused on
[1:06:39] I don't know but he said if it goes on
[1:06:41] the way it is now in 50 years it'll be
[1:06:44] total insanity. So that circle closed in
[1:06:48] 2014. So we've been 11 years in total
[1:06:51] insanity. It's not a surprise.
[1:06:55] So um what do we have here? Well, the
[1:06:59] way of a true prophet, 1963. And usually
[1:07:02] prosperity causes sin. Many people look
[1:07:05] upon prosperity as blessings. It would
[1:07:07] be if we could handle it right, but it
[1:07:10] usually leads to sin, dishonoring God.
[1:07:14] So you want to say what he said. That's
[1:07:16] what we're trying to do. Okay. How
[1:07:18] Israel had drifted off into a terrible
[1:07:20] sin. Got away from God. Got away from
[1:07:23] his commandments and his precepts. Gone
[1:07:25] off all together on a tantrum. And women
[1:07:28] walk the streets in their fine immodest
[1:07:31] clothes. Now, if you go in the shopping
[1:07:34] center, you're going to notice that
[1:07:35] there's all kinds of stuff for the women
[1:07:37] and the men. And usually the skimpier
[1:07:40] the clothes, the more they cost.
[1:07:44] So, because Satan is the designer, you
[1:07:46] see,
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; So, the men went about gambling and
[1:07:49] drinking the roadous and so forth. And
[1:07:52] uh where's it at down here? Sin was
[1:07:53] disregarded by the ministry. Just laying
[1:07:56] wide open. Sin was not rebuked from the
[1:07:58] pulpit anymore. It was on the loose. So
[1:08:00] you see one thing that Satan has
[1:08:02] accomplished in our time better than any
[1:08:04] other time
[1:08:07] um in all of history really he's blurred
[1:08:10] or erased the lines of distinction.
[1:08:13] you know, the men looked like women,
[1:08:15] men, women look like men. And so
[1:08:18] sometimes it's almost impossible to tell
[1:08:21] the difference. And um William Brandon
[1:08:24] had a few words for that. Called it
[1:08:25] Tommy rot, perversion, sodommites.
[1:08:29] And we're living right in the middle of
[1:08:31] insanity.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; So be careful how quickly and how you,
[1:08:36] you know, tend to have an attitude of
[1:08:38] throwing rocks at the churches that uh
[1:08:42] you know aren't doing it. just the way
[1:08:43] we think it ought to be when you let
[1:08:46] your boys and girls uh dress the way
[1:08:49] they do.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Children must live your convictions
[1:08:52] until they have their own Bible-based
[1:08:54] convictions.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. This is pretty hard here.
[1:08:59] Anointed ones at the end time 1965.
[1:09:02] You say, "Well, whether we're Methodist,
[1:09:03] Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostals,
[1:09:05] we're all the same." We are not the
[1:09:06] same. You are a separated people, holy
[1:09:09] unto the Lord, dedicated to the word and
[1:09:12] to the spirit of God to bear fruit of
[1:09:15] his promise of this day. We are
[1:09:17] different and you are not one of them. I
[1:09:21] know that's awful strong, but it's the
[1:09:23] truth just the same. You are dedicated
[1:09:26] to a service. You are dedicated to a
[1:09:28] service in this last day. Come out from
[1:09:31] amongst it. Now, I was sitting from here
[1:09:34] to the organ when he preached this. I
[1:09:36] heard all this live. Of course, it went
[1:09:38] over my head, but it's very true. I
[1:09:41] don't care how real it sounds, how much
[1:09:43] they try to impersonate. If it is a lie,
[1:09:46] if it is contrary to God's word for this
[1:09:49] hour,
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; I don't care what it is. If it's
[1:09:52] contrary to the written word of God for
[1:09:54] this hour, it is a lie.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; You can take that to the bank.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; God will have nothing to do with it. No
[1:10:01] matter how sincere, how educated, how
[1:10:03] smart, how true it sounds, how
[1:10:04] reasonable it sounds if it's contrary to
[1:10:07] the word of God for this hour.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; According to St. Paul, the ministry must
[1:10:12] be properly equipped for the journey.
[1:10:14] You'll find that in second 2 second
[1:10:16] Timothy 3:16. And remember in the church
[1:10:19] age book chapter 4, uh, paragraph 189,
[1:10:23] they must be properly equipped and say
[1:10:26] what he said. For this journey, you also
[1:10:29] have to have proper papers. So,
[1:10:31] everybody has a birth certificate.
[1:10:33] That's your natural birth. But then you
[1:10:35] have to have a passport if you're going
[1:10:36] to get on the plane, if you're going to
[1:10:37] go somewhere. You know, we call that
[1:10:39] born again. And then the baptism of the
[1:10:41] Holy Spirit is the visa to go to certain
[1:10:43] places that are hard to get to. So, we
[1:10:46] get to one of my favorite subjects
[1:10:47] beyond the curtain of time. Right after
[1:10:50] brother Random had that experience in
[1:10:53] May of 1960, he says here in the
[1:10:56] rejected king, I heard a voice then that
[1:10:58] spoke to me that was in the room and it
[1:11:01] said, "This is what you preached was the
[1:11:03] Holy Ghost. This is perfect love and
[1:11:06] nothing can enter here without it."
[1:11:08] That's pretty serious. I am more
[1:11:10] determined than ever in my life that it
[1:11:12] takes perfect love to enter there. and
[1:11:14] my precious friends, my beloved, my
[1:11:16] darlings of the gospel, my my begotten
[1:11:18] children of God. Listen to me, your
[1:11:20] pastor. I wish there's some way to
[1:11:22] explain it to you. There are no words. I
[1:11:24] can't find them anywhere. But just
[1:11:25] beyond this last breath is the most
[1:11:28] glorious thing. There's no no way to
[1:11:31] explain it. There's no way. I just
[1:11:32] cannot do it. But friends, whatever you
[1:11:34] do, lay aside everything else until you
[1:11:37] get perfect love.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Get to a spot that you can love
[1:11:41] everybody.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we've been hearing this for
[1:11:44] years. We have to put it into practice.
[1:11:46] We have to get serious. You know, where
[1:11:49] you can love everybody, every enemy,
[1:11:51] everything else. That one visit there
[1:11:54] has made me a different man. I can never
[1:11:55] never be the same, brother Brandon.
[1:11:59] And a couple months later, he's u
[1:12:03] telling about the same thing, the tape
[1:12:05] from that time. Just remember, I'll say
[1:12:07] this in the faith that I have in that
[1:12:10] vision, whatever it was, and I'll speak
[1:12:12] it in the name of the Lord. Except you
[1:12:14] have that perfect love, you will never
[1:12:16] be there because nothing could ever be
[1:12:18] there without it. Your spirit would
[1:12:21] would be out of place there. My friends,
[1:12:23] you old people, you young people, you do
[1:12:25] not know what time you're going to
[1:12:27] leave. We don't know that. See, we know
[1:12:30] the past. We won't try to forget some of
[1:12:32] it. We know we're right here, but we
[1:12:34] don't know the future.
[1:12:35] See, but let me persuade you as a
[1:12:38] Christian brother, one that loves you,
[1:12:39] except you're born again and the spirit
[1:12:41] of God and love comes into your heart,
[1:12:44] you will certainly miss that place.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; So all we can do is warn you,
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; So we must have, you know, make
[1:12:53] preparations.
[1:12:55] We got to have proper dress code,
[1:12:57] properly equipped, proper papers. One
[1:12:59] thing else, we got to be flexible.
[1:13:02] You know, now that doesn't mean come to
[1:13:03] church when you feel like it. We got a
[1:13:05] time when things start, but you got to
[1:13:06] be flexible because some of your ideas
[1:13:08] aren't aren't just exactly right. You
[1:13:10] see, there is a precise schedule and God
[1:13:14] knows the details. So, we get zealous
[1:13:17] and we come up with private ideas and we
[1:13:19] come up with interpretations. We've seen
[1:13:21] that over the years. We figure it out.
[1:13:23] We make plans. But you can count on one
[1:13:26] thing for sure. God will fulfill his
[1:13:29] word on his schedule.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; There's no room for fanatics. There's no
[1:13:33] room for legalists. Along the journey,
[1:13:35] you're going to face many temptations,
[1:13:37] trials, pitfalls. But the scripture in
[1:13:40] Hebrews 4 says that we have a high
[1:13:43] priest that can be touched by the
[1:13:45] feeling of our infirmities
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; because he was tempted in all points
[1:13:48] like us. His mercy
[1:13:51] and understanding extend to every part
[1:13:53] of the journey. Okay? His mercy is to
[1:13:57] all generations. When we're tempted, we
[1:13:59] have an advocate. Okay? So we can come
[1:14:03] boldly into his presence. We seek his
[1:14:04] mercy. It's like an oasis. It's a
[1:14:07] refreshing. And we're not victims. We're
[1:14:10] overcomers.
[1:14:12] We're more than conquerors in Christ
[1:14:14] Jesus.
[1:14:16] Revelations 12:11 says they overcame him
[1:14:18] by the blood of the lamb and the word of
[1:14:20] their testimony. So see, that's that's
[1:14:23] back to balance. He the blood of the
[1:14:25] lamb is for sure,
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; but your testimony is what kind of
[1:14:28] shakes sometimes. Amen.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; But your testimony has to be in line
[1:14:31] with the blood of the lamb. And that's
[1:14:33] how you overcome.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; So in our journey, we become restless,
[1:14:38] become critical. We develop attitude.
[1:14:40] Where's the promise of his coming? All
[1:14:43] things continue the same. I'm tired of
[1:14:45] the pastor always preaching right at me.
[1:14:47] So much griping and complaining.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Probably not in this church, but those
[1:14:51] other churches I've been to.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; So you're bored. You got too much free
[1:14:54] time.
[1:14:55] But if you spent that same time and
[1:14:57] energy reading the word, praying for the
[1:15:00] needs of the others, you see,
[1:15:03] um then the trip would seem shorter and
[1:15:06] your attitude would improve in direct
[1:15:08] proportion.
[1:15:10] So along the way, we see signs, you
[1:15:12] know, like when you're going to Phoenix
[1:15:13] so far, and then when you get closer,
[1:15:15] signs are sooner, you know, that's kind
[1:15:16] of is with this uh this trip here. And
[1:15:20] uh we have to make adjustments as we get
[1:15:22] closer
[1:15:24] because see the Holy Spirit is not
[1:15:25] shortsighted. Holy Spirit can see the
[1:15:27] whole program. You see, and our God can
[1:15:29] see the entire journey. He knows the end
[1:15:31] from the beginning. And he can see
[1:15:32] through all time and space. He knows
[1:15:34] about the fusses you had.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; He knows you should have prayed before
[1:15:38] you got here, you know. And um he knows
[1:15:40] what your attitude's going to be when
[1:15:41] you go drink coffee tonight.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Why did brother Pope invite him? Man, he
[1:15:46] surely could have done better than that.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I've got enemies out there. I
[1:15:50] don't not everybody's my friend, you
[1:15:52] know. So, it's okay. So, God knows all
[1:15:55] these things. That's right.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; See, he knows it all. And the devil sets
[1:15:59] traps. Leodosa is like a minefield.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; And our attitude towards God's word and
[1:16:04] God's messengers determines our deter
[1:16:07] our destination.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; So, couple other things here will be
[1:16:11] done. Character is not a gift. It's a
[1:16:15] victory indicating that things you have
[1:16:17] to overcome to or obtain it. Peter was
[1:16:20] rough. Mary was mild. Both had things to
[1:16:23] overcome and both had to go to the upper
[1:16:26] room.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Character is not a gift no matter what
[1:16:28] your name might be. So,
[1:16:32] as we're on this journey, we have
[1:16:34] expectations
[1:16:36] for the reunion that'll take place when
[1:16:38] we arrive. We see our loved ones that we
[1:16:41] haven't seen for many years. But God has
[1:16:43] planned it so perfectly. Just like in
[1:16:46] Acts chapter 1, he said he came back and
[1:16:48] he was with the disciples, you know, a
[1:16:50] month or so. Well, he brings our loved
[1:16:53] ones to us right at the end of the trip.
[1:16:56] We've been instructed that prior to the
[1:16:57] going away.
[1:16:59] There'll be a period of a month or so
[1:17:02] when we'll get together with other
[1:17:03] members of the body. We'll have this
[1:17:06] time to take care of the greetings, who
[1:17:08] made it, who's not. You know, all that's
[1:17:10] going to be taken care of because see,
[1:17:12] only God has the list. I don't know who
[1:17:14] they are. God has a list. These are
[1:17:16] going, these are staying back. And you
[1:17:19] can't change that. Okay? So, there'll be
[1:17:21] a time to to take care of the greetings.
[1:17:24] And then he takes us to his house. All
[1:17:26] our attention will be on him. Brother
[1:17:28] Rem told one individual, "One of these
[1:17:29] days, you'll hear a knock at the door.
[1:17:31] You'll be vacuuming, doing the dishes,
[1:17:32] whatever, maybe washing the car, and
[1:17:34] you'll hear a knock on the door,
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; and you go open the door,
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; there's your mom,
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; there's your dad, there's your grandpa,
[1:17:41] whatever.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; You know, I'm depending on that. Yeah.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you'll know the resurrection
[1:17:48] has is set in. So, um, some of us have
[1:17:53] been on this journey a long time and,
[1:17:57] uh, we have to a lot to be accountable
[1:17:58] for and we have a great responsibility.
[1:18:03] We've seen many signs and it all
[1:18:05] indicates that they're almost home. So,
[1:18:08] I just want you to digest these things,
[1:18:11] think it over. If the musicians are
[1:18:13] come, we'll try to close this. But know
[1:18:16] that God can see your attitude. He sees
[1:18:20] where you've been. He's full of
[1:18:22] forgiveness, you see.
[1:18:25] And he wants you, the bride, to be
[1:18:28] there. So, let's stand together and uh
[1:18:31] we can sing that. Um, all to Jesus I
[1:18:34] surrender all. All to him I freely do.
[1:18:39] Oh, to Jesus
[1:18:43] I
[1:18:45] surrender
[1:18:47] all
[1:18:49] to him. I freely
[1:18:53] give.
[1:18:55] I will ever
[1:19:00] come and trust him in
[1:19:05] his presence
[1:19:08] daily.
[1:19:09] [Music]
[1:19:12] I
[1:19:13] surrender
[1:19:16] all.
[1:19:20] I
[1:19:22] surrender
[1:19:24] all
[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:19:30] to thee my blessed
[1:19:34] savior
[1:19:36] I
[1:19:38] surrender
[1:19:40] all
[1:19:42] shall we pray heavenly father we thank
[1:19:44] you for your mercy we thank you Lord for
[1:19:47] this portion of your word that you let
[1:19:48] us study Tonight,
[1:19:51] we pray that everybody can take
[1:19:52] something home. If it was just two
[1:19:54] words, Lord, that they could remember
[1:19:56] the four steps, how to stay balanced,
[1:19:59] how to stay in step. We just pray that
[1:20:02] you would bless each one as they go and
[1:20:05] there be peace. And Lord, may others see
[1:20:08] that there is a Christian people that
[1:20:11] live by the word of God. We're not a
[1:20:13] political party. We're not trying to,
[1:20:15] you know, turn everything back. No, just
[1:20:16] living the word for our day. Thank you
[1:20:19] for your word. Thank you for all things.
[1:20:22] We ask in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:20:25] [Music]
[1:20:29] Oh, I
[1:20:32] surrender
[1:20:34] all.
[1:20:38] All
[1:20:40] to thee, my bless
[1:20:47] I
[1:20:48] surrender
[1:20:50] all.
[1:20:54] Oh, I
[1:20:57] surrender
[1:20:59] all.
[1:21:02] Oh, I
[1:21:05] surrender.
[1:21:07] I surrender all
[1:21:10] [Music]
[1:21:13] to thee. My blessed
[1:21:17] savior.
[1:21:20] God
[1:21:21] surrender
[1:21:24] all.
[1:21:27] Let us praise the Lord for our precious
[1:21:28] brother tonight by putting our hands
[1:21:30] together. We appreciate brother George.
[1:21:36] We're so thankful he feels right at home
[1:21:38] to come and worship with us. These
[1:21:40] brothers that are getting up there in
[1:21:42] age that spent this time with our
[1:21:44] precious prophet, Brother Brandham, and
[1:21:46] that are balanced in the word, they're
[1:21:48] fewer and fewer. We're so thankful to to
[1:21:50] take advantage of them every time that
[1:21:52] we get and we just want them to continue
[1:21:54] to be right at home. And I I I
[1:21:58] had intended to ask the young people
[1:22:00] these questions before. He said, you
[1:22:02] know, take good notes. So, we're going
[1:22:03] to give our young people a little quiz
[1:22:06] in a moment. And uh we're just
[1:22:09] appreciate our brother tonight. He
[1:22:10] talked about the balance. Do you know
[1:22:11] what those? So the young people I mean
[1:22:13] people like Rebecca and Jeremiah and
[1:22:16] Elijah, Nina, Anna, Timmy, Lydia,
[1:22:18] Nathaniel, Rachel, Ella, and those. So
[1:22:23] what is the level for those two items
[1:22:26] that he told us? Young people, does
[1:22:27] anybody know? Were you paying attention
[1:22:29] tonight? What are the two reasons we
[1:22:31] have that level? To stay balanced
[1:22:34] and why, Nathaniel?
[1:22:37] Stay awake. So, I know you all did real
[1:22:41] good. Hopefully that wasn't for one of
[1:22:42] my kids tonight.
[1:22:44] So,
[1:22:46] what are the four things, young people,
[1:22:48] that brother George encouraged us to do?

[1:23:09] Very good. Thank you for that.
[1:23:13] [Applause]
[1:23:17] So, he's given us about 12 tapes. Anna
[1:23:21] probably has them all. Maybe our 20
[1:23:23] minutes could be one of those. What
[1:23:25] tapes was he quoting from tonight? Do
[1:23:26] the young people know? I know Elijah
[1:23:27] knows. Tell us, brother Elijah.
