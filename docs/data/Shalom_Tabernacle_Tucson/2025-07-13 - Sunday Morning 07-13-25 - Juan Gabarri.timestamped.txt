[0:02] [Music]
[0:12] Good morning everyone. Can we all stand?
[0:16] We'll open up in a word of prayer.
[0:20] Heavenly Father, Lord, we're grateful
[0:22] Lord. We're honored to be here this
[0:24] morning coming before you, Lord, for
[0:28] this portion of just a 20 minute portion
[0:30] of Sunday school, Lord, to hear some of
[0:33] the best preaching, Lord, that you've
[0:36] allowed us to hear, Father.
[0:38] Lord Jesus,
[0:40] you said, Lord, did you stand at the
[0:42] door and knock? And if any man hear your
[0:45] voice and open that door, you'll come
[0:47] into him. Lord, what more could we ask
[0:50] than for you to come into us, Father?
[0:53] It's so simple.
[0:55] Give us a personal revelation, Lord, of
[0:58] you, Father, in our lives, Lord, and
[1:00] what you want to achieve through us,
[1:03] Father. Be with the children in their
[1:06] Sunday school class, Lord, everyone that
[1:08] may be on the way. Lord, we just
[1:10] dedicate this time to you, Father, this
[1:13] Sunday, all that would be said and done.
[1:16] and we thank you for it in the name of
[1:17] our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. We're going
[1:21] to be starting the Leoysian church age
[1:25] spoken of in Revelation
[1:27] um chapter 3 and I believe that was um
[1:34] well you you see it in your text. I
[1:37] don't have the exact verse, but anyway,
[1:39] we're going to start with paragraph 43,
[1:41] Brother Brandon preaching, and end at
[1:44] paragraph 73.
[1:47] Can we all sing only believe?
[1:51] Only
[1:52] believe,
[1:56] only
[1:58] believe.
[2:01] All things are possible.
[2:06] Only
[2:08] believe.
[2:12] Only
[2:13] believe.
[2:17] Only
[2:19] believe.
[2:22] All things are possible.
[2:28] only
[2:29] believe.
[2:32] You may be seated.
[2:36] &gt;&gt; We believe that the Lady Oian church
[2:38] started in AD 1906.
[2:44] I predict now remember predict
[2:47] especially you listen at the tape. I
[2:50] don't say it will be but predict that it
[2:53] will end by 1977.
[2:57] that the church will go completely into
[3:00] apostasy and shall be ousted out of the
[3:03] mouth of God and the second coming or
[3:06] the rapture of Christ might come
[3:08] anytime. I can miss that a year. I can
[3:11] miss it 20 years. I can miss it a 100
[3:13] years. I don't know where but I just
[3:16] predict that according to a vision he
[3:19] showed me and taking the time the way
[3:21] it's progressing I say it'll be sometime
[3:23] between 33 and 77 at at least this great
[3:27] nation is going to strike a war that's
[3:31] going to blow it to bits. See now that's
[3:34] pretty close.
[3:36] &gt;&gt; It's awful close. Now I could be wrong.
[3:39] I'm predicting. Everybody understand?
[3:41] Say amen.
[3:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[3:42] &gt;&gt; But the Lord showed me a vision of the
[3:45] great powerful woman in 33 19 and 33.
[3:48] It's on paper. How that Roosevelt
[3:52] cause he helped cause the world to go to
[3:54] war. How that Musculenia would make his
[3:58] first invasion to Ethiopia and he would
[4:00] take it but he'd come to a disgraceful
[4:03] end. And how that then the threeism
[4:06] Nazism, fascism, and communism would all
[4:09] wind up in communism. And how many in
[4:11] here remembers me just keep have you
[4:13] standing straight over like say watch
[4:16] Russia watch Russia the king of the
[4:19] north watch Russia king of the north
[4:22] watch Russia king of the north how
[4:24] many's heard me say just wave that over
[4:26] and over over the old-timers you see
[4:27] back in the early part of the church
[4:29] just stand there and wave it over and
[4:31] over watch Russia the king of the north
[4:34] see what he would do for all those isms
[4:37] will heap up into Russia then I said
[4:40] that This nation would finally go to war
[4:42] with Germany and Germany would be built
[4:45] in a concrete wall.
[4:48] That was imagine all 11 years before it
[4:51] was ever started to build it. 11 years
[4:54] before
[4:56] &gt;&gt; and I said the Americans will take an
[4:57] awful beating at that line. Some of
[5:00] these brethren here was at that line.
[5:02] Brother Royerson and them asked them
[5:03] what happened.
[5:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, they did.
[5:05] &gt;&gt; They sure did. All right. But finally I
[5:08] said we will overcome and we'll be one
[5:11] of the winner in the war between us and
[5:13] Germany. Now I said then after that time
[5:17] it science would really progress. They
[5:20] did the media atomic bomb and
[5:21] everything. I said during their
[5:23] progression they would make a cars would
[5:26] constantly begin to shape like an egg.
[5:28] You remember the big old hood on the
[5:29] 1933 the big back come down like this
[5:32] the spare tire on the back of it. Look
[5:34] how it is now. See, streamline. See,
[5:37] like an egg. And I said, "Finally,
[5:39] they'll invent a car that you only have
[5:41] to have a steering wheel in." I seen a
[5:43] family going down the C road and a glass
[5:45] top car. Great big fine looking roads
[5:48] and fine car. And they were sitting
[5:50] looking at one another and the car was
[5:51] running by itself going right around the
[5:53] curves and everything. And they've got
[5:55] the car right now. It's already
[5:56] invented. They've got the car. And I
[5:59] said, "Then oh, how science will
[6:01] progress in that day." I said, "Then I
[6:04] seen a
[6:05] They're going to permit women and are
[6:07] permitting women to vote and by voting
[6:10] they'll elect the wrong man some of
[6:12] these days and you did it the last
[6:13] election
[6:14] &gt;&gt; cuz the woman's votes at le Kennedy we
[6:16] know that. See between the crooked
[6:18] machines and things fixed up FBI exposed
[6:22] and how could anybody
[6:25] do something about it?
[6:27] &gt;&gt; Why ain't something sad?
[6:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:29] &gt;&gt; Afraid somebody lose their job. You see
[6:31] it's just a bunch of politics rotting to
[6:33] the core. That's right. That's all.
[6:35] &gt;&gt; Sure. There ain't no ain't no isn't no
[6:39] excuse me.
[6:41] &gt;&gt; There is no salvation in this nation.
[6:43] That's right.
[6:44] &gt;&gt; There's no salvation in any nation.
[6:46] Salvation's in Jesus Christ. Amen.
[6:49] That's
[6:49] &gt;&gt; right. Now, I'm thankful for America.
[6:52] I'd rather live here than any place in
[6:54] the world because outside of Canada,
[6:57] Canada and United States is twins. Uh we
[7:00] know that neighboring nations, wonderful
[7:02] place. But I I believe I'd rather live
[7:04] here than anywhere I know of because
[7:06] it's my home. I'm glad that I am an
[7:09] American and thankful for it. But I tell
[7:12] you, it certainly needs a counter
[7:14] revival.
[7:16] &gt;&gt; It sure does. And it will not get it.
[7:19] &gt;&gt; No sir, she'll never rise again. No sir,
[7:23] she's gone. You remember about five
[7:25] years ago in Chicago? That's on tape.
[7:27] You got it, Jean. I said they'll either
[7:29] accept it this year or they'll
[7:31] constantly drop down and they've done it
[7:34] and they will do it till she'll finally
[7:36] meet her in. But there'll be a powerful
[7:38] woman. Now remember this is on tape too.
[7:41] A powerful woman, great woman. She'll
[7:44] either be president or it'll be a woman
[7:47] representing the Catholic Church, which
[7:49] I think it is, will take over here
[7:51] someday and she'll rule this country.
[7:55] This nation is a woman's nation. Amen.
[7:58] &gt;&gt; Flag was made by a woman. It's number
[8:00] 13. She started out 13 stars, 13
[8:02] stripes, 13 columnies. Everything's 13.
[8:04] 13. 13. Right on down. 13 stars on her
[8:07] silver dollar. Now everything's a 13.
[8:09] It's number 13. The appears in the 13th
[8:11] chapter of Revelations. Completely 13.
[8:14] Everything is woman, woman, woman,
[8:16] woman, woman right on down. She's took
[8:18] over all the offices. She's tuck over
[8:21] Hollywood. She's tuck over the nations.
[8:23] She's tuck over the offices. She's stuck
[8:26] over everything there is. Equal rights
[8:28] for the man, votes for the man, cusses
[8:30] like a man, drinks like a man, anything
[8:32] else.
[8:34] And the just bait for the Catholic
[8:36] Church for the worship of a woman.
[8:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:38] &gt;&gt; They're already worship a woman anyhow.
[8:40] &gt;&gt; She's the best ill woman is the best
[8:43] bait the devil ever had.
[8:45] &gt;&gt; She's worse than all the barrooms that
[8:47] ever was. She can send more souls to
[8:48] hell in all the barrooms in the country.
[8:51] That's right.
[8:52] A good woman is a jewel in a man's
[8:55] crown. Said the wisest man on earth. A
[8:57] man ought to honor a good woman.
[9:00] &gt;&gt; But an evil one is water in his blood,
[9:02] and his blood is his life.
[9:05] &gt;&gt; You man's got good wives. You don't know
[9:07] how you ought to thank God for a good
[9:08] wife.
[9:09] &gt;&gt; For if God could have gi a man anything
[9:11] better for a helpmate, he'd have done
[9:13] it.
[9:14] &gt;&gt; But a woman is the best helpmate that
[9:16] God could give a man.
[9:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when they turned, she was the
[9:20] one in the Garden of Eden that Satan
[9:22] chose for his tool.
[9:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:25] &gt;&gt; He didn't take the man. He took the
[9:27] woman. Why didn't he go to Adam to give
[9:29] him passions? He come to the woman, give
[9:32] her. See, cuz that was the one he chose.
[9:34] God tucked the man and Satan tucked the
[9:37] woman. Look right on down. In the end
[9:39] when Babylon is set up in the beginning
[9:41] hoses to Babylons a woman when come on
[9:44] down into the age now it's ending up the
[9:47] gentile age Babylon started like that
[9:49] and ends up with a woman worship
[9:52] Mary in the church. What a day we're
[9:55] living in.
[9:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[9:58] Now
[10:01] uh the lady oa that the ladyan age the
[10:07] word means lukewarm
[10:12] it's
[10:14] increase with goods
[10:17] and thinks she has need of nothing
[10:22] but the Bible says that she's wretched
[10:25] blind miserable and naked
[10:28] What a condition.
[10:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; The reward to them that overcome in this
[10:32] church age is to sit on the throne with
[10:35] the Lord.
[10:37] &gt;&gt; Now
[10:39] the uh star or angel or messenger of
[10:43] this church age is unknown.
[10:46] Now the first church age messenger who
[10:49] was that?
[10:51] Paul, Ephesus, Sernia, Arinus, Pergus,
[10:57] St. Martin, Tatara, Columbbo, Sardis,
[11:02] Luther, Philadelphia, Wesley, and in the
[11:07] this Lady Oian, we don't know yet and
[11:10] probably won't know until it's all over.
[11:13] But I just like to give my quotation of
[11:16] what this angel will be, what we're
[11:19] looking for. Would it be all right?
[11:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:23] &gt;&gt; Be that we got a little time. I just
[11:26] wrote a little quotation here. What I
[11:28] thought the angel of this Lady Oian
[11:32] church ended up now. He will be at the
[11:35] end of the age like the rest of them.
[11:39] Like the Bible.
[11:41] You'll be at the end of the age. Not the
[11:44] first of it. At the end of it.
[11:46] The angel always comes to rebuke
[11:49] them for what they've done. To the to
[11:52] the angel of the church of Leoa. Write
[11:56] these things. See to the angel of the
[12:00] church of Samia. Write these things. See
[12:03] each one is to the angel at the end of
[12:05] the age. Paul the end of the age and on
[12:10] down. End of the age. The lapover. End
[12:12] of the age. End of the age. That's what
[12:13] makes it laugh. See to the angel
[12:16] speaking what was this lap over here to
[12:18] the angel the end of that age. See
[12:20] picking up right here made the lap like
[12:22] stair steps going up the seven church
[12:24] ages. Now
[12:28] this angel that comes in this day I want
[12:32] to I've got something written here. I
[12:33] just like to read it.
[12:36] But he will be known
[12:40] the last part of the age.
[12:44] And because we are so close to that, so
[12:49] close to the light age that probably
[12:52] he's on earth now. Don't know him. He
[12:56] will be a a mighty prophet
[12:59] that will be rejected by the church
[13:02] world
[13:04] for they will go right on in their sins
[13:07] and finally
[13:09] be spewed out of the mouth of God.
[13:14] Out of the mouth of God's presence.
[13:17] I believe it will be one like Elijah.
[13:22] I'm going to give my reasons why. Now,
[13:25] let's just turn over here in the book of
[13:26] Malachi. Just a moment.
[13:29] I'm going to give you why I think it
[13:31] will be one anointed with the spirit of
[13:34] Elijah.
[13:36] Now, I want you to put on your your
[13:39] grace cap. Now,
[13:42] you
[13:45] &gt;&gt; Malachi the 4th chapter. Now, listen as
[13:47] I read it. You in your Bible. Now, think
[13:50] real close now for the next few minutes
[13:52] now before we go into the church age.
[13:55] For behold, the day cometh that shall
[13:58] burn as an oven, and all the proud, ye,
[14:01] all that do wickedly shall be stubbles,
[14:05] and the day that cometh, thou shall uh
[14:09] burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts,
[14:12] and it shall leave them neither root nor
[14:15] a branch.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; What's he saying? He's speaking over to
[14:19] a day coming. Will you agree on that?
[14:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. to a day of the coming of the
[14:23] Lord.
[14:25] But unto you, now watch now he's
[14:27] speaking back to Israel. Now what did he
[14:29] say? For behold, the day cometh way over
[14:34] that shall burn. But to you that fear my
[14:38] name, the son of righteousness
[14:42] shall rise with healing in his wings,
[14:45] and you shall go forth and grow up as
[14:47] calavs of the stall.
[14:50] And you shall tread down the wicked, for
[14:52] they shall be ashes under the souls of
[14:55] your feet, and that and the day that I
[14:58] shall do this, sayeth the Lord of hosts,
[15:01] not the day that he shall burn the earth
[15:05] will tread upon the ashes. That's
[15:07] millennium, of course. See, remember the
[15:10] law of Moses my servant which I
[15:13] commanded him and Horeb for all Israel's
[15:17] with the statutes and judgment.
[15:20] Behold, I will send you Elijah the
[15:24] prophet
[15:25] before the coming and great and dreadful
[15:29] day of the Lord.
[15:31] and he shall turn the hearts of the
[15:33] fathers to the children and the hearts
[15:36] of the children to the fathers, lest I
[15:39] come and smite the earth with a curse.
[15:41] The ending of the Old Testament.
[15:44] Now Jesus said Matthew 17:10,
[15:50] speaking of this, all the Jews are
[15:52] looking for that coming Elijah.
[15:55] Now watch what Jesus said about it.
[15:58] Matthew 17:10.
[16:01] We'll begin at the ninth verse. Matthew
[16:04] 17:9. And as they came down from the
[16:07] mountain, Jesus charged them, saying,
[16:10] "Tell no man to tell the vision to no
[16:13] man." See, don't tell this. You know it,
[16:15] but keep it to yourself.
[16:18] Tell no man the vision until the son of
[16:21] man be risen from the dead.
[16:24] Don't tell it. And his disciples asked
[16:27] him, saying, why then said the scribes
[16:30] that Elias must first come? Why is it
[16:33] that Elias must first come before this
[16:34] Christ is to come, the son of righteous?
[16:37] Why did they say this? Here you're
[16:39] already here. And the scribe said that
[16:41] that Elias would come first. Now watch.
[16:45] And Jesus answered and said unto them,
[16:48] Elias truly shall come shall first come
[16:52] and restore all things. But I say unto
[16:56] you that Elias is come already,
[17:00] and you knew him not.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; See, he didn't say who he was. See, but
[17:06] have done unto him whatsoever ye listed.
[17:10] Likewise shall also the Son of man
[17:12] suffer them. And the disciples
[17:15] understood that he spake unto them of
[17:17] John the Baptist.
[17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:20] Now,
[17:22] now John the Baptist was the Elias that
[17:25] was to come. Now watch, I get back to
[17:26] Malachi the fourth chapter again.
[17:31] Now remember, he said here that before
[17:36] the great and noble terrible day of the
[17:38] Lord shall come, I will send to you
[17:42] Elijah the prophet. the uh fifth verse.
[17:46] But I will send unto you the prophet. I
[17:51] will send to you Elijah the prophet
[17:52] before the coming of the great and
[17:55] dreadful day of the
[17:58] &gt;&gt; what do we find in the Lord's day
[18:02] at the end of the age.
[18:06] &gt;&gt; That's when the world is going to be
[18:07] burned. You remember how he tuck him
[18:09] with a white uh wig on, you know, and
[18:12] and his breast and girded about the
[18:15] paps. You remember that?
[18:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:16] &gt;&gt; And we proved by the Bible it wasn't a
[18:18] Sabbath day, neither a Sunday. It was
[18:21] the Lord's day.
[18:23] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[18:25] &gt;&gt; That's the day that he comes as a judge
[18:27] and will smite the earth for the curse.
[18:28] Is that right?
[18:31] &gt;&gt; And I will send to you Elijah the
[18:33] prophet before the coming of the great
[18:35] and dreadful day of the Lord.
[18:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:39] &gt;&gt; Now watch the compound coming of Elijah.
[18:44] Now, if you'll notice, all scripture has
[18:47] a compound meanings, but it's hid from
[18:51] the eyes of the wise and prudent and
[18:54] revealed to babes such as will learn.
[18:56] Don't you believe that?
[18:59] &gt;&gt; Now, hold Malachi 4 right there. And
[19:02] now, let's go back to Matthew 2 just a
[19:05] minute. Just right across the page.
[19:09] Matthew 2.
[19:12] [Applause]
[19:20] I believe I ought to meant Luke 2
[19:22] instead of Matthew 2. I got it wrote
[19:25] down here, but I was hurrying just a few
[19:27] moments ago and the Holy Spirit was in
[19:29] the room only. I just had me a big time.
[19:31] So, I meant
[19:34] Lord bless uh two. Let's see if this
[19:38] would be a
[19:50] Now, let me study here just a minute.
[19:53] Matthew 2.
[19:55] That ain't where I'm looking for, is it?
[20:01] &gt;&gt; I just submitted. I'll get it. If you
[20:02] just let me have just a little bit of
[20:05] time here cuz I want you to be sure to
[20:08] see it that the scripture has a compound
[20:11] meaning to it.
[20:14] &gt;&gt; The adoration of an return to Nazareth,
[20:19] the Passover, the ministry of John. Now,
[20:22] let me see if I can Luke. I was reading
[20:25] somewhere and I
[20:29] I mean Mark instead of Luke might have
[20:31] been Mark
[20:34] but I want you to get this scripture so
[20:36] that you'll know that it is the work of
[20:40] the Lord that he does do this in this
[20:42] manner.
[20:46] I'll tell you where I'm looking for.
[20:47] Where the out of Egypt I have called my
[20:49] son. Somebody with a mar reading that
[20:53] could get it right quick or find it.
[20:56] Out of Egypt I have called my son.
[21:00] I have called my son. Just a moment.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; Luke 117.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; Luke 11:17. Thank you, brother. That's
[21:07] right. Luke 1. Mark Luke
[21:11] 117 instead of two. I won't forget the
[21:13] 14th. That's where That's it, brother.
[21:16] That's exactly right. Luke
[21:19] 11:17.
[21:22] All right.
[21:25] Now,
[21:26] now you can mark it down. Now, what it
[21:29] is, it's out of the blessings of the
[21:33] Lord that was blessed. And thou shalt
[21:35] have joy and gladness, and many shall
[21:38] rejoice at his birth. For he shall be
[21:41] great in the sight of the Lord, and
[21:43] shall drink neither wine nor strong
[21:46] drink. This man that comes forth will be
[21:49] taught from his birth, not to drink or
[21:52] to have anything to do with sin like
[21:53] that.
[21:54] &gt;&gt; You get it?
[21:55] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; And he shall be filled with the Holy
[21:58] Ghost, even from his mother's womb. and
[22:00] many of the children of Israel shall he
[22:02] turn to the Lord their God. And he shall
[22:07] go before him in the spirit and the
[22:10] power of Elias to turn the hearts of the
[22:12] fathers of the children and the
[22:14] disobedient to the wisdom of the just
[22:16] and make ready a people prepared for the
[22:18] Lord. Now,
[22:21] now we realize that he was prophesied
[22:24] and John was that person. Is that right?
[22:29] Amen.
[22:29] &gt;&gt; John was the Elijah of that day that was
[22:33] to come. Now, we also know that
[22:36] scripture sometimes means two things.
[22:39] It'll say one thing like over there in
[22:41] Matthews where it said, "Out of Egypt, I
[22:43] call my son." All right. I'll be That's
[22:45] what I was hunting for. Out of Egypt,
[22:47] I've called my son. And then if you run
[22:50] that son reference there, he was did not
[22:54] it went back into Hosea which did not
[22:56] mean Jesus his son. It was was uh Israel
[23:01] his son out of Egypt he called Israel
[23:04] but it had a compound meanings and a
[23:06] greater understanding to it when meant
[23:09] and talked about for for Jesus coming
[23:13] which is a greater than than Israel when
[23:16] he called uh Israel out. All right.

[53:25] brother Joe, would you come and take the
[53:27] request?
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Sure to be in church this morning, isn't
[53:31] it? We like to magnify the Lord. We know
[53:33] he does everything good for his people.
[53:35] Even if you're in a test and trial,
[53:37] that's custom made for brother Joe to
[53:39] get me where I need to be because we
[53:41] know character, it's got to be earned
[53:43] and developed. It's not a gift. We just
[53:45] give you, you're a good person. And so,
[53:47] it's sure nice to be in church. Sister
[53:49] Dana is visiting this morning. and our
[53:51] friends, the Castillos, Brother Mark and
[53:53] his family, different ones from New
[53:55] Mexico. We sure welcome you. Just want
[53:56] you to be right at home. For Sunday
[53:59] school, we had a big robust uh five and

[54:11] use. And we'll be missing the Figuroas
[54:14] here so soon. So, be praying for them in
[54:16] their move. Uh we've been bringing the
[54:19] McGraz

[54:24] health uh situation there in Phoenix. We
[54:26] want to continue to uphold them and
[54:28] we've got some missing still and
[54:30] traveling and different needs. Whether
[54:32] Sean's going to be traveling to North
[54:33] Carolina this week, he he asked that we
[54:35] would remember him and maybe you've got
[54:37] a desire on your heart. Just bring that
[54:39] in faith before our precious Lord. He'll
[54:41] give you everything that you need
[54:43] according to his perfect will. Dear God,
[54:46] we're so thankful to be in church this
[54:47] morning. We appreciate our pastor so
[54:50] much, his family. And so we hold them up
[54:52] in prayer, Lord, that you just help,
[54:54] guide, keep him, Lord, the word this

[55:05] hope, our trust in you, Lord. A concrete
[55:07] foundation knowing it's unmovable,
[55:09] unshakable. Lord, in the wind of
[55:11] political change and upheavalss and
[55:14] things in the world, wars, rumors of
[55:16] wars, we know these things must be,
[55:17] Lord, towards the end. And we know
[55:19] you're coming as soon. We come
[55:21] expecting, Lord. We pray that we could
[55:22] be attentive this morning. Help us to
[55:25] just rem be still and know that you are
[55:28] God because you'll be speaking to us,
[55:30] Lord, this morning. We believe that with
[55:32] all of our hearts. And so we want to sit
[55:34] still and just hear that as we sang
[55:36] early, be humble, oh God, because then
[55:39] you can minister to us because we're
[55:41] going to listen and hear something from
[55:43] heaven that will help us along the road.
[55:45] We'll collect tithes and offerings,
[55:46] Lord. Not that you need it. You own
[55:48] everything, but you want a cheerful
[55:50] giver and to trust in you and to work
[55:53] these things, Lord, through. And so we
[55:54] give it all to you in the name of our
[55:56] Lord and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[55:58] And all God's people say, "Amen.
[56:05] Amen. Brother Trevor has a special in

[56:38] See that he was sad. His back was heavy
[56:43] laden. His strength was almost gone. But
[56:47] he shouted as he journeyed.
[56:50] Deliver us will come in palms of
[56:55] victory.
[56:57] Crowns of glory,
[57:00] arms of victory
[57:04] I shall wear. I saw him in the evening.
[57:09] The sun was sinking home. He had
[57:13] overcome the mountain. They had reached
[57:17] the veil. Oh, he saw the golden city,
[57:23] his everlasting home, and he shouted
[57:27] loud, "Hosana,
[57:29] deliver us will come." Then
[57:34] palms of victory,
[57:36] crown of glory,
[57:40] palms of victory
[57:43] I shall wear.
[57:46] gaze and all that city
[57:49] just saw a narrow flood.
[57:53] A band of holy angels came from the
[57:57] throne of God. They for him on their
[58:01] minions say for the national
[58:06] and join him in his triumph for
[58:10] deliverance has come. Stand.
[58:14] Palms of victory on crowns.
[58:18] Glory.
[58:20] Palms of victory.
[58:24] Oh, what a day this will be. Oh, it
[58:27] seems I hear the angels
[58:30] around the throne. So grand. They're
[58:34] shouting, "Glad, hosana,
[58:37] we've reached the promised land." When
[58:40] we have reached that city, our race on
[58:44] earth will all shout loud hosana
[58:50] deliverance has come
[58:54] upon
[58:55] the victory.
[58:58] Crowns of glory
[59:00] [Music]
[59:02] of victory
[59:04] I shall wear.
[59:08] [Music]
[59:10] Trevor's already set up. You can be
[59:12] seated. Amen. God bless you.
[59:21] [Music]
[1:00:28] [Music]
[1:02:09] [Applause]
[1:02:14] Amen. and let's stand together this
[1:02:15] morning. We all know what song that was
[1:02:17] he was playing.
[1:02:20] I'm so thankful that he loves me. He
[1:02:21] promised he'd never leave me, never
[1:02:23] forsake me. But
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; there's times where I look back in my
[1:02:27] life, there were times where I left him.
[1:02:30] And but he loves me so much. He was
[1:02:32] waiting that place that I left him.
[1:02:35] Maybe for some of you, it was back in
[1:02:37] Sunday school when we were singing that.
[1:02:39] Yes, Jesus loves me. He loves you so
[1:02:42] much. She's still waiting for you there
[1:02:43] this morning. Come back to you with He's
[1:02:46] got open arms waiting for you this
[1:02:48] morning. Let's just sing that as we turn
[1:02:50] the service over to our pastor this
[1:02:51] morning. Yes,
[1:02:54] Jesus
[1:02:56] loves me.
[1:03:00] Yes,
[1:03:02] Jesus
[1:03:04] loves me.
[1:03:07] Yes,
[1:03:09] Jesus
[1:03:11] loves me.
[1:03:14] The Bible
[1:03:17] tells me so.
[1:03:22] Yes,
[1:03:24] Jesus.
[1:03:29] Oh yes,
[1:03:31] Jesus
[1:03:33] loves me.
[1:03:36] Yes,
[1:03:38] Jesus
[1:03:40] loves me.
[1:03:44] [Music]

[1:07:37] like me.
[1:07:39] [Music]
[1:07:43] I once
[1:07:46] was lost,
[1:07:48] but now
[1:07:52] I'm found.
[1:07:54] I was blind,
[1:07:57] but now
[1:08:00] I see.
[1:08:03] Can you lift your hands and say, "Praise
[1:08:05] God." Praise God.
[1:08:09] Praise God.
[1:08:12] Praise God.
[1:08:15] Praise God.
[1:08:18] Praise God.
[1:08:20] Hallelujah.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God.
[1:08:29] Oh, praise God.
[1:08:32] Praise God.
[1:08:35] Praise God.
[1:08:38] Praise God.
[1:08:41] Praise God.
[1:08:44] Praise God.
[1:08:47] Praise God.
[1:08:50] Amen. Let's just lift our hands and tell
[1:08:52] the Lord. Just take a moment and thank
[1:08:54] him. And oh God, we love you this
[1:08:58] morning. There's nobody like you, Lord
[1:09:00] Jesus. We need you in our lives, Lord.
[1:09:03] We need you to come and speak to our
[1:09:05] hearts. Send the power of revelation,
[1:09:08] Lord, to every heart by your grace and
[1:09:11] your mercy. Lord, we need you more now
[1:09:14] than we ever needed you. Oh God, humble
[1:09:18] our spirits and our hearts to receive
[1:09:21] from you today. In Jesus' name we pray.
[1:09:26] Amen. God bless you, our dear brother.
[1:09:29] God bless you.
[1:09:39] The Lord Jesus Christ bless you. Please
[1:09:42] be seated for a few moments.
[1:09:51] With the Lord this morning
[1:09:55] us to honor his resurrection.
[1:10:00] This is my fifth visit to United States.
[1:10:05] In every occasion, it has been a
[1:10:06] blessing to me.
[1:10:09] I have not come alone.
[1:10:11] I've come with my wife,
[1:10:14] my sister Ben.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; God bless her.
[1:10:19] She always has problems flying.
[1:10:23] She doesn't like airplanes.
[1:10:26] I heard that's a sufferer.
[1:10:29] Every time she climbs into a plane,
[1:10:32] She needs a double faith
[1:10:39] here with me this morning, which is very
[1:10:41] important to me
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; because she has made a great sacrifice
[1:10:45] for the love of me. Every time that I
[1:10:48] travel,
[1:10:50] I like to travel with my wife. We have
[1:10:52] five sons, men.
[1:10:56] Three of them are married. Two are still
[1:10:58] single
[1:11:00] and they're all serving the Lord.
[1:11:03] We're very happy for that.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; I bring greetings from my family
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; and also from the Madrid tabernacle,
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; the local ministry there
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; and also the governing body
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; in Spain.
[1:11:21] There's 20 churches of the message
[1:11:22] there.
[1:11:25] 45 million people.
[1:11:28] So the proportion compared is very small
[1:11:31] because the light has already passed
[1:11:33] over Europe.
[1:11:35] But we're happy
[1:11:38] has already passed over
[1:11:42] the designated seed there that are
[1:11:45] believing the glorious message
[1:11:49] brought us through William Brennham.
[1:11:51] There is a seed that has been promised.
[1:11:55] And whether the devil like it or not,
[1:11:58] God calls his seed,
[1:12:00] the seed has to answer if we are here
[1:12:04] because we have answered to the voice of
[1:12:07] God. God bless you. I appreciate the
[1:12:10] pastor,
[1:12:12] brother Israel Pope.
[1:12:14] He doesn't know me.
[1:12:16] But I I thank for his confidence.
[1:12:20] I want to be a blessing this morning.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; I want to come with rare thoughts.
[1:12:26] God gave us a message.
[1:12:28] That's what we're all believing
[1:12:30] because the faith of the rapture is
[1:12:33] found in the message.
[1:12:35] That's going to help the bride
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; is the message.
[1:12:40] I thank brother pastor Mark
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; and his family. He invited me
[1:12:48] that's coming this weekend
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; and I'm very happy for that
[1:12:54] opportunity to be in this. God bless
[1:12:56] every one of you.
[1:12:58] Welcome in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:13:00] Christ.
[1:13:01] I invite you to stand to your feet those
[1:13:04] that can.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; I would like to speak a very simple
[1:13:09] theme this morning.
[1:13:11] And I wish to entitle it like a lamb.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; That's why I invite you to open your
[1:13:19] Bibles,
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; the book of Isaiah 53
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; from 1-7.
[1:13:34] And there will be a second scripture.
[1:13:38] Revelations 13:8
[1:13:43] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:13:49] You can say amen.
[1:13:56] Who has be a report?
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; And to whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:14:01] revealed?
[1:14:11] For ye shall grow up before him as a
[1:14:12] tender plant and as a root out of a dry
[1:14:15] ground. He hath no form nor comeliness.
[1:14:17] And when we shall see him, there is no
[1:14:19] beauty that we should desire him.
[1:14:32] He is despised and rejected of men, a
[1:14:35] man of sorrows and acquainted with
[1:14:36] grief. And we hid as it were our faces
[1:14:39] from him. He was despised and we
[1:14:41] esteemed him not.
[1:14:52] Surely he hath bore our griefs and
[1:14:54] carried our sorrows. Yet we did esteem
[1:14:56] him stricken, smitten of God, and
[1:14:59] afflicted.
[1:15:09] He was wounded for our transgressions.
[1:15:11] He was bruised for our iniquities. The
[1:15:14] chastisement of our peace was upon him,
[1:15:16] and with his stripes we are healed.
[1:15:27] All we like sheep have gone astray. We
[1:15:29] have turned everyone to his own way. And
[1:15:31] the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity
[1:15:33] of us all.
[1:15:43] He opened not his mouth.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; He is brought as a lamb to the
[1:15:51] slaughter.
[1:15:53] That is our thought this morning.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; As a lamb.
[1:16:04] As a lamb to the slaughter and as a
[1:16:05] sheep before her shears is dumb. So he
[1:16:08] opened not his mouth.
[1:16:11] Revelations 13
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; and verse 8.
[1:16:33] Amen. and all that dwell upon the earth
[1:16:35] shall worship him whose names are not
[1:16:36] written in the book of life of the lamb
[1:16:39] slain from the foundation of the world.
[1:16:41] Amen.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Marvelous heavenly father,
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; we thank you this morning.
[1:16:50] You've given us physical strength,
[1:16:53] turn the pages of the Bible and be able
[1:16:56] to read them. But we need
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; the supernatural element,
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; your Holy Spirit
[1:17:05] to be able to bring forth the word.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; We don't want this morning
[1:17:11] that blood and flesh intervene
[1:17:14] that it be your holy spirit
[1:17:17] that can bring the word
[1:17:21] because we know only the word can
[1:17:22] overcome.
[1:17:25] But the Holy Spirit is the word
[1:17:27] quickens it.
[1:17:30] That's why when you were on earth
[1:17:32] or the word
[1:17:34] you went
[1:17:37] to be anointed
[1:17:40] the anointed word of the hour. Anoint us
[1:17:43] Lord and help us this morning
[1:17:47] in the name of the Lord.
[1:17:50] Lift the fo, heal the sick,
[1:17:54] help the sinner to repent.
[1:17:56] Help us to have a time. There's those
[1:17:58] that trouble in the mates that we can
[1:18:01] say
[1:18:03] our hearts burn within us within us as
[1:18:06] we when he
[1:18:11] speak to us.
[1:18:14] Our heart may it burn
[1:18:17] also can see. Thank you. In the name of
[1:18:21] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:18:25] You may be seated.
[1:18:30] I want to speak this morning about a a
[1:18:32] theme
[1:18:36] as we have titled it as a lamb.
[1:18:40] Not that he was a literal lamb,
[1:18:44] but he came with the characteristics of
[1:18:45] a lamb.
[1:18:48] As a lamb, he was taken to the
[1:18:50] slaughter.
[1:18:51] And all of us, we were scattered.
[1:18:56] Not that one yes or one no.
[1:18:59] All of us were scattered.
[1:19:01] Because we came to the world under a
[1:19:03] condition that was not the right place.
[1:19:07] That's why we were scattered.
[1:19:10] But there's something good.
[1:19:13] Didn't say we were scattered like goats,
[1:19:17] like sheep. And the sheep is the only
[1:19:20] one that will return back to the fold
[1:19:24] that all of us we have scattered. But as
[1:19:28] a sheep, as a sheep listens to the voice
[1:19:31] of the pastor and follows him. We give
[1:19:35] thanks to God that this morning we are
[1:19:38] listening the voice of God, the voice of
[1:19:42] God, his word as a sheep doesn't matter.
[1:19:48] How scattered a sheep can be the sheep
[1:19:52] recognize the voice of the pasture and
[1:19:55] will return back to the fold.
[1:19:58] And we're going to put a base here.
[1:20:01] I understand that it's very normal
[1:20:06] that when you don't know a person that's
[1:20:08] new
[1:20:10] that one doesn't know who one is
[1:20:14] we could be very attentive
[1:20:16] and I like this
[1:20:19] we're going to speak in the first seal
[1:20:20] here
[1:20:22] verse 24 of
[1:20:24] put a base here
[1:20:26] brother Brandham
[1:20:28] here he is saying
[1:20:33] the book was written and planned before
[1:20:35] the foundation of the world or that is
[1:20:37] to say the poor was written and was
[1:20:41] pre-planned in God's thoughts before the
[1:20:44] foundation of the world.
[1:20:47] So we want a God that plans.
[1:20:50] We don't know how to plan. Well
[1:20:53] today we plan something
[1:20:56] and then we wake up with another
[1:20:57] thought.
[1:20:58] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do
[1:21:00] that. I'm going to do the other.
[1:21:03] And when the moment comes what we had
[1:21:06] planned before, we don't follow through
[1:21:08] with
[1:21:10] say we we fail
[1:21:12] in our form of planning.
[1:21:15] Sometimes we overcome sometimes we don't
[1:21:17] accomplish but God
[1:21:21] something his plan is perfect.
[1:21:26] The plan of God is not modified. Brother
[1:21:30] Brandham said
[1:21:32] does not learn it.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; The God doesn't learn it
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; because he's eternal.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; As he is eternal, he can't learn
[1:21:41] something.
[1:21:43] He knows it all. God knows all things.
[1:21:47] And when he planned this in his
[1:21:50] thoughts,
[1:21:51] God's plan is perfect. And he doesn't
[1:21:55] change his ways of thinking.
[1:21:59] respect to his word because God is
[1:22:02] perfect. His word is perfect and what he
[1:22:06] thought
[1:22:08] to be expressed
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; and manifested.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Look
[1:22:18] speaking of a plan of God in his
[1:22:21] thought.
[1:22:24] God didn't have time to think
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; because God is eternal.
[1:22:29] And God's mind there's no time.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Random says God could know it.
[1:22:36] How many
[1:22:39] how many one can can I count the the the
[1:22:41] birds the mosquito
[1:22:43] see how how many times you
[1:22:46] how many mind do we have do you think we
[1:22:48] know these things but he
[1:22:51] every thought that we have
[1:22:55] he could plan all things there and God's
[1:22:58] plan
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; God's plan
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; is perfect
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; is perfect
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; and God's plan
[1:23:06] has to be unveiled
[1:23:08] as he thought it
[1:23:12] can try to bring it forth differently
[1:23:14] change
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; manipulate
[1:23:18] God's thought
[1:23:20] but he cannot be it cannot change can he
[1:23:24] manipulate it
[1:23:26] all has to work forth
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; according to God's thoughts
[1:23:33] Bible says was planned the book was
[1:23:37] planned and written before the
[1:23:40] foundation of the world. Well, that's to
[1:23:42] say this book that we have here
[1:23:45] physically this Bible was planned and
[1:23:49] was written
[1:23:51] before we even had God already had it in
[1:23:54] his mind. that random sins. God wrote
[1:23:58] three Bibles.
[1:24:00] He wrote it in Zodiac. It was in the in
[1:24:02] the heavens. And God began to create in
[1:24:04] the universe. And when God created the
[1:24:07] universe, it was the first Bible. But we
[1:24:11] today
[1:24:13] understand that Bible. But this Bible is
[1:24:17] functioning according to this Bible.
[1:24:22] Because when there's a movemental
[1:24:24] supernatural
[1:24:26] first on the earth. The Bible says
[1:24:30] that God first moves that in the
[1:24:33] comes to manifest it on the earth.
[1:24:35] That's to say, but the Bible in the
[1:24:38] heaven
[1:24:40] is still villages.
[1:24:42] There there's still movement there.
[1:24:45] There's still fulfillment at the same
[1:24:47] time that it fulfills up there. The same
[1:24:50] that it fulfills down here. So God wrote
[1:24:54] a second Bible
[1:24:57] in the pyramids there.
[1:25:00] It's a written Bible.
[1:25:04] Why is that written only symbols?
[1:25:07] It is written in measurements.
[1:25:09] It's written in inches. Why? If you're
[1:25:13] going out to Egypt
[1:25:15] and you you pay entrance, you'll be able
[1:25:18] to see the the permit on Egypt,
[1:25:21] you're going to see the the the kids.
[1:25:24] You're going to see all the
[1:25:25] measurements.
[1:25:27] You won't understand these things. Am I
[1:25:29] going to understand
[1:25:31] God's wisdom?
[1:25:33] He has
[1:25:35] planned it to write a Bible
[1:25:39] that would have symbols
[1:25:41] that I would have measurements.
[1:25:44] People like us
[1:25:46] understand
[1:25:48] God is still now through his word.
[1:25:54] Look,
[1:25:58] it says the book
[1:26:01] before the foundation of the world.
[1:26:04] The same book,
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; the Bible is truth
[1:26:09] before the foundation of the world.
[1:26:12] Christ being the lamb was dead
[1:26:16] before the foundation of the world. The
[1:26:18] question is, when did Christ die?
[1:26:23] before the foundation of the world.
[1:26:27] The Bible says before the foundation of
[1:26:29] the world,
[1:26:31] the prophet tells us before the
[1:26:32] foundation of the world, you and I as
[1:26:35] believers have to say that Jesus died
[1:26:39] before the foundation of the world
[1:26:45] before the foundation of the world.
[1:26:48] There was no beginning. That's what the
[1:26:50] prophet says.
[1:26:52] Well, Christ died. Christ died in his
[1:26:56] thoughts
[1:26:58] in God's thoughts.
[1:27:01] If God's thoughts are eternal and Christ
[1:27:06] in the thought of God, that's to say
[1:27:10] that God
[1:27:12] of the world, he already had a book.
[1:27:16] had a book, but that book
[1:27:20] was a a familiar book. Look, in Spain,
[1:27:25] there's a book they call the family
[1:27:27] book.
[1:27:29] But when a child is born, the father has
[1:27:34] to go to the registry and register with
[1:27:37] papers in the hospital there
[1:27:41] where it says the name of the child,
[1:27:43] the hour he was born,
[1:27:46] what he's going to be called, they take
[1:27:48] it to the registry. And there in the
[1:27:51] registry,
[1:27:52] They give him a book
[1:27:54] that they call the family
[1:27:57] or that is to say the book of a family.
[1:28:00] Every child that is born
[1:28:02] has to be written in that book. And that
[1:28:05] is something
[1:28:07] that makes you think that God
[1:28:10] our father
[1:28:12] had a book. Amen.
[1:28:15] book, family book, but to be able to
[1:28:19] write in it to his sons,
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; he needed ink.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; It's just a book. Oh, I'm I'm going to
[1:28:30] go now.
[1:28:32] If there's something in white to write
[1:28:33] on, you know, a blank sheet, there's
[1:28:35] something in white, you know.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; No, there's no white sheets here.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Well, let's just pretend.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:28:45] is English. By the way,
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; this is my family book
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; and this is God's family book.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; But it was a book
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; that had nothing written on it.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; But he
[1:29:02] had to inscribe them his sons the names.
[1:29:07] The scripture says our name they were
[1:29:11] written
[1:29:12] about the life of the lamb before the
[1:29:15] foundation of the world. Then God and
[1:29:18] his thoughts
[1:29:20] a book there family
[1:29:23] needs to write
[1:29:26] the names
[1:29:30] to write
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; the name of his son.
[1:29:35] doesn't have no ink. They have no ink.
[1:29:39] They have no way to write
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; and he has to write this name with an
[1:29:45] ink
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; so special
[1:29:49] can be erased.
[1:29:52] Never. There's no devil. There's no hell
[1:29:56] that can erase a name
[1:30:00] has been written
[1:30:02] in the life of the
[1:30:05] before the foundation of the world.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:30:09] God.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; There's my family book,
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; but it's blank.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; and God
[1:30:23] needs something to write the name.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; So, he in his mind
[1:30:30] knows he needs ink.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; He needs ink.
[1:30:34] And as he needs eat,
[1:30:37] he decides to sacrifice a lamb.
[1:30:41] We need to sacrifice a lamb
[1:30:45] in God's mind
[1:30:48] in God's thoughts.
[1:30:50] The lamb
[1:30:52] cannot sacrifice himself.
[1:30:55] Cannot die by himself according to the
[1:30:58] lawical
[1:31:00] law.
[1:31:02] That must be sacrificed.
[1:31:04] by a high priest. Now in God's mind,
[1:31:09] he already has the book of the family.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; He has to write the name there, but he
[1:31:14] has no ink.
[1:31:16] He needs in his mind
[1:31:20] sacrifice a lamb
[1:31:22] to sacrifice a lamb. He knows that the
[1:31:26] lamb
[1:31:27] sacrifice itself.
[1:31:30] A high priest, a high priest.
[1:31:33] that has no beginning, that has no
[1:31:36] ending.
[1:31:37] Because if he was in God's eternal
[1:31:39] father, he needed a high priest, eternal
[1:31:43] priest. And Abraham one day just after
[1:31:47] the battle
[1:31:49] with that high priest, that high priest
[1:31:53] said that he had no father. He had no
[1:31:57] mother.
[1:31:58] The days have ended.
[1:32:01] bread of cup. He tells us the high
[1:32:04] priest,
[1:32:06] the all powerful God, the only one
[1:32:10] like a sacrifice, a lamb,
[1:32:14] God's thoughts. Now, we have a book.
[1:32:20] We have the lamb.
[1:32:22] We have the high priest to sacrifice the
[1:32:25] lamb.
[1:32:28] The lamb is sacrificed. Their names are
[1:32:31] written
[1:32:34] they are written.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; He seals the book
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; of redemption
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; with seven seals.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Oh
[1:32:47] no. What God thought
[1:32:49] has to be manifested.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; What God thought
[1:32:55] has to be manifested
[1:32:58] in God's mind.
[1:33:00] But it didn't do no good.
[1:33:04] It was only beating God's mind, it
[1:33:06] needed to be to bring that manifestation
[1:33:09] of that lamb so that he would die
[1:33:14] in a real form for this. So for God, he
[1:33:18] he located Adam in the Garden of Eden.
[1:33:22] And boy, here you have the book.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Here you have the names.
[1:33:29] Now you have to bring them. You have to
[1:33:32] call every name.
[1:33:36] You have to call every name.
[1:33:39] You don't have to come through sexual
[1:33:40] act to be a spoken word of God. So for
[1:33:44] the word
[1:33:46] manifest these things.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; So Adam
[1:33:53] gave him time to manifest not even one
[1:33:54] name
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; and like he didn't give him time.
[1:33:59] any name
[1:34:01] because Satan entered.
[1:34:03] Now the Bible says
[1:34:05] Adam was not deceived and his woman was
[1:34:08] deceived.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; So Adam
[1:34:12] being eternal
[1:34:14] and seen that his woman
[1:34:18] had fallen from eternity
[1:34:21] through sin
[1:34:23] that God said not to Adam has
[1:34:27] responsibility responsibility
[1:34:31] to maintain himself in eternity in order
[1:34:34] to come out of that eternity
[1:34:36] to participate in the sin to be able to
[1:34:39] redeem Eve. Brother said,
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Adam knew that the only way to redeem
[1:34:47] Eve is that he
[1:34:50] could participate on that sin. Because
[1:34:53] Adam made in the image of God, he could
[1:34:57] not fall. He could not be lost.
[1:35:01] Adam said,
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Adam knew that he had a lamb. Adam knew
[1:35:08] that he had a lamb. You and I, we know
[1:35:12] that we also have a lamb. And that lamb
[1:35:16] is the lamb of God
[1:35:19] taking away the sins of the world.
[1:35:22] And when Adam
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; and Eve
[1:35:26] did what they didn't have to do,
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Adam participates
[1:35:32] like Jesus
[1:35:34] was his eternal
[1:35:37] we had already fallen.
[1:35:39] We already instituted him.
[1:35:42] So Jesus could say in his condition or
[1:35:45] he
[1:35:47] come from eternity
[1:35:49] and into time space
[1:35:53] of every one of us to be able to redeem
[1:35:55] us. What do you think God did? God had
[1:35:59] to do
[1:36:01] the the the sign that he showed in Adam
[1:36:03] and he did the same thing. And Adam
[1:36:07] knowing what he had done.
[1:36:10] Satan didn't deceive Adam
[1:36:13] because Adam was the word
[1:36:16] of the representation of God. But when
[1:36:19] they fell,
[1:36:22] they made themselves a covering.
[1:36:24] Brother Ram says
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; that they hid.
[1:36:30] But before they hid,
[1:36:33] they were afraid.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Before they walked fine,
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; how do you think it fits?
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; It's good. It's good. We win him.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; If God comes down,
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; you won't know.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; We made us a good cover to the sight
[1:36:52] measurement. But the prophet says
[1:36:55] that when he descended in the evening
[1:36:58] time, when God descended in the evening
[1:37:02] time
[1:37:03] and they heard God speak,
[1:37:06] they found out
[1:37:08] that the covering was no good. That's
[1:37:12] why we need to listen to God that he
[1:37:16] will teach us our covering that they're
[1:37:19] no good.
[1:37:21] The presence of God.
[1:37:23] So, Adam, when he hears the voice, he
[1:37:28] begins to be afraid. Oh,
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; he never knew what fear was. Never. Adam
[1:37:33] wasn't afraid.
[1:37:35] They know what fear was. They know what
[1:37:37] fear. But now they
[1:37:42] legs are trembling. Oh,
[1:37:45] Eve, what's happening to us? But God is
[1:37:47] looking for us.
[1:37:49] And now this is no good.
[1:37:53] They they hid the prophet says
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; and God
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Adam
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Adam
[1:38:01] where art thou
[1:38:10] and when God calls us and he finds us
[1:38:14] it was God's justice
[1:38:17] righteousness he came down righteousness
[1:38:20] to destroy Adam and Eve
[1:38:22] The prophet says, "God's righteousness,
[1:38:26] every man's punishment.
[1:38:28] Adam, come out. Come out."
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; And Adam,
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; hello.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; No, I'm not going to come out.
[1:38:38] I'm going to stay in this position
[1:38:39] because Adam knew that he became in this
[1:38:43] condition, he was going to die. And Adam
[1:38:48] was waiting
[1:38:49] that God to do something for him.
[1:38:52] He wanted righteousness.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; It was God's love. Then
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; the prophet says
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; in the message,
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; a conference with God.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; 19 paragraph.
[1:39:16] Abraham says
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; something should be done
[1:39:20] or all will go into chaos his own
[1:39:23] creation
[1:39:25] and God selected a certain tree.
[1:39:29] God selected a certain tree. He called
[1:39:32] Adam and Eve for them to unite
[1:39:35] and he calls them there.
[1:39:38] The prophet said that he
[1:39:40] were hidden but God
[1:39:43] called them.
[1:39:45] to a place of conference. Brother
[1:39:48] himself says
[1:39:50] the place where God called them together
[1:39:54] for there was a tree.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Well, there was a tree.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, is that to say that God selected a
[1:40:02] tree?
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; He took a lamb,
[1:40:06] sacrificed it,
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; took that bloody skin.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Why a tree? Because the scripture was
[1:40:14] showing the truth love of God to be
[1:40:18] sacrificed in a tree. And God see that
[1:40:23] type in the Garden of Eden
[1:40:28] to select a tree because the prophet
[1:40:30] says that the cross
[1:40:33] is made of wood and the wood
[1:40:37] comes from a tree.
[1:40:39] You see what God was showing
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; a type in the shadow of God
[1:40:45] a lamb Adam and Eve on a tree showing
[1:40:52] the lamb of God and he would come. He
[1:40:56] would be sacrificed
[1:40:59] upon a tree
[1:41:02] is perfect.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; God is perfect.
[1:41:07] God was hidden hiding
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; and God come out.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Adam
[1:41:16] no cannot come out like this. No.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:41:19] But when God
[1:41:22] sacrificed the lamb for Adam
[1:41:25] sacrificed the lamb for him
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; behind the tree
[1:41:30] and his blood was shed.
[1:41:33] Adam was listening.
[1:41:37] Adam knew
[1:41:38] something was happening that God was
[1:41:42] sacrificing his lamb. And when God
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; throw the skins forward
[1:41:49] by that behind that place,
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; oh Eve,
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; glory to God.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; They took those those tunics, those
[1:42:01] and now they dress. They say, "Are you
[1:42:03] doing now?" They could relocate
[1:42:07] themselves before God because they had a
[1:42:12] covering not a religion but the covering
[1:42:16] of blood.
[1:42:18] What we need is a bride that that can be
[1:42:23] the covering the blood under the
[1:42:26] covering of the word. The prophet says
[1:42:30] had his lamb.
[1:42:32] People had his lamb.
[1:42:35] Had their lamb.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Even the disciples,
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; they had their lamb. Jesus was there.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; The Bible says
[1:42:44] as a lamb,
[1:42:46] not a physical lamb, but Jesus had he
[1:42:50] had to have
[1:42:52] all the characteristics
[1:42:54] of a lamb.
[1:42:56] And there Peter was there
[1:42:59] and Pedro said, "Lord,
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; we know you are lamb you have to die.
[1:43:06] I want you to stay with us."
[1:43:12] But says that Satan took Peter
[1:43:18] Jesus would not be sacrificed. Why?
[1:43:22] Because while the lamb was still alive,
[1:43:25] the sins would remain on them.
[1:43:30] While the lamb was still alive
[1:43:34] would remain over the people.
[1:43:37] Then they didn't need a live lamb.
[1:43:40] They needed a dead lamb. That's why
[1:43:43] Jesus
[1:43:45] Satan take Peter
[1:43:47] Peter says no let
[1:43:50] for us we want you
[1:43:56] sorry Jesus said Satan
[1:43:58] depart from me
[1:44:01] because you're a stumbling.
[1:44:03] Why was he a stumbling?
[1:44:05] Because your lamp my lamb lies
[1:44:10] no good.
[1:44:12] We needed it in lamb that would give his
[1:44:16] life for us to be able to rescue
[1:44:21] the shedding of the blood. There is the
[1:44:23] remission of sins.
[1:44:26] We needed
[1:44:28] was to be redeemed
[1:44:30] by the blood of the lamb.
[1:44:34] Blood of the lamb. The blood of Jesus
[1:44:36] Christ. The blood of Jesus Christ that
[1:44:39] cleanses us from sus
[1:44:46] Christ
[1:44:53] sins.
[1:44:55] Glory.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; A church without blood
[1:45:02] is a church without emotion.
[1:45:06] A church without blood,
[1:45:09] a church that's dead. And God
[1:45:13] does not have a dead church.
[1:45:16] A living church
[1:45:19] has a living church
[1:45:21] and true
[1:45:25] as a lamp.
[1:45:28] God
[1:45:29] show and every type every shadow
[1:45:36] the lambs that were dying
[1:45:39] uh Abel's lamb Adam's lamb every lamb
[1:45:44] that was going and dying
[1:45:46] a type a shadow of the true lamb
[1:45:51] when we go to Exodus
[1:45:53] chapter 12 God
[1:45:56] says to Moses
[1:46:00] Moes,
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Moses,
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Moses,
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; this month
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; shall be the first month
[1:46:11] of the month of the year
[1:46:14] for you Israel
[1:46:17] or to say it would be the first month
[1:46:18] for Israel.
[1:46:20] It is the month of April. And now you're
[1:46:24] gonna take the the
[1:46:28] 10th day of April.
[1:46:31] You're gonna take a lamb.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; A lamb
[1:46:39] brother
[1:46:41] said that number 10
[1:46:43] is the number of the world. That's why
[1:46:45] the lamb
[1:46:47] was selected
[1:46:49] before the foundation of the world.
[1:46:52] Hello.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Are we okay?
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Come in.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; We're good.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; we're good. Okay.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; The lamb was selected before the
[1:47:02] foundation of the world. Okay.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; The 10th day.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Take the lambord. Take the lamb.
[1:47:12] And you're going to sacrifice him on the
[1:47:14] 14th.
[1:47:16] I said to the pastor, "If I had a a
[1:47:17] writing board
[1:47:20] because it's only preached with a the
[1:47:22] chuck board, but we're okay. We're okay.
[1:47:26] We take the the theme of what the the
[1:47:28] 10th day, God tells Moses,
[1:47:32] take a lamb,
[1:47:35] not only for you,
[1:47:38] but for you, for the family of Israel.
[1:47:41] And if one family
[1:47:43] is small,
[1:47:45] let them together with another small
[1:47:46] family and that way they'll be will take
[1:47:49] place
[1:47:51] and the 14th day
[1:47:53] you shall sacrifice that lamb
[1:47:56] the lamb
[1:47:58] according to the law according go to
[1:48:01] God's commandments
[1:48:03] had to be a male
[1:48:08] the first of the sheep. Listen,
[1:48:11] I know you know these things already.
[1:48:13] I'm just reminding you what I already
[1:48:16] spoken through prophet and what the
[1:48:18] scriptures tell us. The 14th day, the
[1:48:21] 14th day had to be sacrificed. That lamb
[1:48:24] Yes without no defects, a male
[1:48:29] had to be sacrificed in between the
[1:48:31] evening time.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; The first evening is from 12
[1:48:37] to 3 in the afternoon.
[1:48:40] in Israel's time time frame that's what
[1:48:42] it is 12 to 3 and the evening sacrifice
[1:48:46] it was from 3 in the evening till six so
[1:48:50] Jesus
[1:48:52] to die in between the two evenings had
[1:48:56] to die at 3:00
[1:49:02] here's a clock can you write
[1:49:06] number 12's here
[1:49:09] 12. Is it noon? Yes. Here we have three.
[1:49:15] It was the the ninth hour. Here we have
[1:49:18] the sixth hour. And below we have the
[1:49:21] end of the day. Okay. Okay.
[1:49:24] Here it was the lamb of the morning.
[1:49:26] Here the evening lamb from three. Jesus
[1:49:30] died in between both times to fulfill
[1:49:33] the scripture
[1:49:35] which was at the ninth hour. When Jesus
[1:49:39] or God
[1:49:41] is showing these things to us, when we
[1:49:44] go to Exodus, chapter 12, we find that
[1:49:49] the lamb is taken on the 10th
[1:49:53] and then for four days
[1:49:56] the lamb
[1:49:58] had to be observed.
[1:50:01] So it would have no defects.
[1:50:04] If we see
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[1:50:09] he was selected
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Okay. The 10th day.
[1:50:17] Now four days had to pass by
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; so that he could be sacrificed.
[1:50:23] So from the fall of Adam
[1:50:25] until Noah was two days. From Noah
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; to Jesus
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; was two more days. So now we have four
[1:50:33] days because because Peter says that for
[1:50:36] God a thousand years is as one day. So
[1:50:39] the lamb Jesus had to be observed for
[1:50:44] four days for thousand years
[1:50:47] so that you could see that he had not
[1:50:50] one defect.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; He was seeing Abel.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Was he perfect?
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Was he perfect?
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Was he perfect?
[1:51:02] Was
[1:51:03] he seen in Noah?
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; Was Noah perfect.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Was he perfect? There
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; was he seen in Jacob.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Was he perfect? Abraham. He saw himself
[1:51:12] in Abraham, the prophet. Was he perfect?
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; He was being seen in Joseph.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; He was perfect. Wow.
[1:51:22] But all the critics
[1:51:24] say they begin to observe
[1:51:27] to see if there was some defect
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; in that lamb.
[1:51:35] When the scriptures
[1:51:38] tell us that Jesus comes as a lamb
[1:51:41] and he has to have the characteristics
[1:51:43] of a lamb of a lamb. Not that he was a
[1:51:47] literal lamb, but he had to fulfill
[1:51:51] all the characteristics
[1:51:54] of a lamb of a lamb. When the angel
[1:51:57] Gabriel
[1:51:59] presents herself to Mary,
[1:52:01] oh blessed art thou, Brandham says
[1:52:05] that Mary was hearing
[1:52:08] not because she had heard or seen
[1:52:12] but she because a strange feeling she
[1:52:14] felt was following her.
[1:52:17] That's to say she could feel something
[1:52:18] in that moment. But what did God do?
[1:52:22] Before Mary
[1:52:25] or the angel met with Mary,
[1:52:28] it's that Mary Brenam says went to a
[1:52:31] service. She went to a service
[1:52:34] and just rightly the pastor
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; preached.
[1:52:39] He preached
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; the pastor preached. The pastor
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; preached
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; the pastor
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; I mean preach
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; pastors preach.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; Pastors preach
[1:53:00] perfection 4:11.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4:11.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Perfection.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; Perfections. Perfect.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Can you believe it?
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Can you believe it?
[1:53:13] The pastor, brother says he preached the
[1:53:17] scripture of Isaiah
[1:53:20] 9. A virgin shall conceive as gave forth
[1:53:25] birth to a son.
[1:53:28] Why the Holy Spirit did anoint the night
[1:53:30] the pastor to preach that message?
[1:53:34] Because it was the time so that that
[1:53:36] scripture could be fulfilled.
[1:53:40] It was a time so that the scripture
[1:53:43] could be fulfilled.
[1:53:46] How many virgins were there in the
[1:53:47] church?
[1:53:50] How many virgins were there?
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; There was a bunch of them.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; But one of them
[1:53:58] when the pre the the pastor preached,
[1:54:03] how can it be a virgin? What was it?
[1:54:07] It was the Holy Spirit preparing her
[1:54:11] so that she could fulfill the
[1:54:12] scriptures. Oh, that's to say that God
[1:54:16] can help her through your pastor to
[1:54:20] bring you the promises so that you can
[1:54:23] fulfill
[1:54:25] scriptures.
[1:54:28] And when Mary comes out, comes up, you
[1:54:32] see that she's she's broccabited
[1:54:35] and observes
[1:54:37] Mary, he asks, "What's what's wrong?"
[1:54:40] Oh, nothing's wrong. Nothing's wrong.
[1:54:46] Mary, what's wrong with you?
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Is that what the pastor preached?
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; I don't understand it.
[1:54:57] And I begin to feel strange now. I
[1:55:00] believe it. I understand.
[1:55:06] But I I I I don't understand. I believe
[1:55:08] it. But I don't understand it. How can
[1:55:12] it be that a virgin woman?
[1:55:15] The rest virgins,
[1:55:17] they went to the barber shop or salon
[1:55:21] to celebrate a birthday. They went to a
[1:55:24] fiesta. But Mary
[1:55:27] was there restless
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; for that prophecy.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; The angel
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; was in that reunion.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Gabriel
[1:55:42] was in that service. The angels of God
[1:55:47] are in this service. Brother said it.
[1:55:54] Brother said, "Not the worship of angels
[1:55:57] because we don't worship angels."
[1:56:00] But God does have angels
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; that administer in your favor.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; You don't you remember that Jesus said,
[1:56:10] "You're going to turn me in. You're
[1:56:12] going to crucify me. The son of man that
[1:56:15] shall be betrayed, but remember of the
[1:56:18] third day, I will raise again from the
[1:56:21] dead.
[1:56:25] in several occasions.
[1:56:28] Jesus warned him that he was going to
[1:56:31] resurrect. Jesus dies. They take him to
[1:56:34] the the the tomb on the third day. He
[1:56:38] resurrects. Hello.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:56:47] The scriptures say
[1:56:50] that the angels said to him to the
[1:56:53] woman, "Who are you looking for?
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; We're looking for Jesus of Nazareth.
[1:56:59] And the angels told them,
[1:57:02] did you not remember that in such and
[1:57:05] such a meeting, he told you that he
[1:57:08] would resurrect?" The question is,
[1:57:12] were the angels there at the meeting?
[1:57:14] Were
[1:57:16] they listening?
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Were they listening to the sermon? Oh,
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; don't you think that when you're
[1:57:25] walking?
[1:57:26] Oh, Lord, I have this problem. I have
[1:57:28] this doubt.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, you know how tremendous problems
[1:57:32] that I got.
[1:57:34] And you're you're conversing with the
[1:57:36] wife with your brother. And you go to
[1:57:39] church.
[1:57:41] Oh Lord, how you going to help us? Oh
[1:57:44] Lord, how do I get out of this problem?
[1:57:47] And you're sitting down and the pastor
[1:57:50] comes.
[1:57:52] Listen,
[1:57:54] he's in his office
[1:58:01] and and at the moment there's the
[1:58:02] thought that comes and he changes his
[1:58:03] message. Huh?
[1:58:07] All night steadying this message
[1:58:10] although it's steady.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Huh.
[1:58:15] I'm going to stick to my message
[1:58:18] and something that pushes him. No,
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; change that part of the message,
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; but he doesn't know why.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; But God knows.
[1:58:30] Oh,
[1:58:33] when the pastor is preaching then
[1:58:41] he he he hits upon your problem
[1:58:44] and you call the wife. Did you tell the
[1:58:46] pastor something?
[1:58:48] No. Lord, did you tell the pastor
[1:58:50] something? The wife says, "No,
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; no, it wasn't the brother. It wasn't the
[1:58:55] sister.
[1:58:57] The only one that has angels
[1:59:00] says is the bride of Jesus Christ. And
[1:59:03] those angels,
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; they're the protectors of our life.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Who told you that?
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; Who told you that? What? What? No.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; The angels walked.
[1:59:22] When you go to church, the angels walked
[1:59:25] with you on your side. Because the Bible
[1:59:27] says that angels of God, they encamp
[1:59:31] around those that seek him
[1:59:35] and those that they fear him.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; So Mary
[1:59:41] was uneasy
[1:59:44] and Gabriel there in service
[1:59:48] dealing with Mary's heart.
[1:59:50] Don't worry,
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; you don't understand.
[1:59:55] Brother Brandham says that when Moses
[1:59:59] went to Egypt to deliver his people and
[2:00:02] he wanted to do it
[2:00:04] without having his son circumcised.
[2:00:08] The scripture says it and brother
[2:00:09] Brandham says it
[2:00:12] the angel of the Lord was going to kill
[2:00:15] was going to kill Moses.
[2:00:18] Does did you read that in the scripture?
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's to say the angel was going to
[2:00:25] kill Moses.
[2:00:27] Now, God prepares a scene.
[2:00:32] God prepares a scene.
[2:00:36] Who told Sephra to take a stone?
[2:00:39] Who told Sephra to take a stone?
[2:00:42] How many rocks were there?
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Well, those rocks are different forms.
[2:00:48] But one rock was so sharp
[2:00:51] to cart the the foreskin of a child
[2:00:54] had to be something special
[2:00:59] didn't take a rock and this is not good.
[2:01:03] No angel hold on hold on hold a minute
[2:01:06] there. I got to take a rock here. No
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; something told Sephra take the rock and
[2:01:15] cut off the foreskin of the child.
[2:01:17] She didn't see the angel, but she did
[2:01:20] feel the revelation
[2:01:23] of what she had to walk through
[2:01:26] to find the precise rock
[2:01:29] that death would not kill Moses.
[2:01:34] Did God prepare this scene?
[2:01:37] God prepares every scene of your life.
[2:01:40] You think every scene of your life is
[2:01:42] prepared. It's organized.
[2:01:45] every circumstances,
[2:01:47] every inclusive thing in every every
[2:01:49] trial, in every tribulation, in every
[2:01:52] circumstances. You think God doesn't
[2:01:54] know.
[2:01:56] He knows all that there is.
[2:01:59] But you cannot see is that the angels of
[2:02:02] the Lord are encamped about all these
[2:02:04] people
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; to inspire
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; that you
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; do the right thing.
[2:02:14] Maria Mary.
[2:02:17] Okay.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Love.
[2:02:20] Thank you. Thank you.
[2:02:24] We'll see you tomorrow.
[2:02:27] They weren't married yet. Mary and
[2:02:29] Joseph.
[2:02:32] Mary went home.
[2:02:34] Had to take out the
[2:02:37] and go to the the basket and go to the
[2:02:38] the well
[2:02:40] and she feel that someone's watching
[2:02:42] her.
[2:02:43] Is it some kind of thieves maybe are
[2:02:45] watching me?
[2:02:50] And she begin to move quickly around
[2:02:52] about
[2:02:53] to try to get rid of
[2:02:55] to to lose
[2:02:58] what was following her. But I'm saying
[2:03:00] there's nothing that can't separate
[2:03:05] the angels of the Lord
[2:03:07] because they have a a job, a boss.
[2:03:11] Let let that a son of God, a daughter of
[2:03:14] God be persecuted by the devil.
[2:03:18] And watch how fast God makes himself
[2:03:21] present to help his children.
[2:03:24] How is he going to place us? He knows
[2:03:25] where we're at. And and Mary, you know,
[2:03:28] looking walking. Abraham says that she
[2:03:31] went into to to alley
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; without an end, a dead end. Does that
[2:03:37] sound right
[2:03:39] from the situations in your life
[2:03:42] that have no solution
[2:03:45] like Israel and Egypt from desert?
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; Desert the enemy coming
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; death.
[2:03:52] Where is there an escape? There was no
[2:03:55] escape.
[2:03:56] But that God opens the door. God opens
[2:03:59] the door where there is no door.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; You You don't believe it?
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; Well, there was a gentile woman.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; And Jesus told the disciples,
[2:04:19] "Do not the way of the Gentiles.
[2:04:23] Don't go through the way of the Gentiles
[2:04:26] because I have come to find or to seek
[2:04:28] and to save
[2:04:31] the lost sheep of Israel.
[2:04:34] And they go into a place. And there was
[2:04:36] a woman gentile.
[2:04:40] Oh, a serious woman.
[2:04:45] Son of David.
[2:04:47] Son of David.
[2:04:49] Just saw her.
[2:04:54] Brother Brandham says she
[2:04:58] was not calling in the office
[2:05:02] that responded to him because for her he
[2:05:06] was not the son of David. But someone
[2:05:08] told her, "Hey,
[2:05:12] something supernatural said, hey,
[2:05:15] the son of David is not for you.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; Call him Lord."
[2:05:20] And then she said, she said, "Lord,
[2:05:22] Lord,
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; my and Jesus
[2:05:30] and all the disciples
[2:05:32] was going to do,
[2:05:35] you know what he did? That Jesus opened
[2:05:38] the way there was no way." Why? Because
[2:05:43] he is the way and the truth.
[2:05:46] So there was no road. He made a road.
[2:05:49] Hallelujah.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we think God's going to treat
[2:05:57] us good
[2:05:59] and we receive a slap.
[2:06:02] He said, "Woman,
[2:06:04] he didn't say woman." He said, "Woman,
[2:06:09] what do you want?" Hey, mama, my
[2:06:11] daughter's sick. Oh,
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; what are you doing here? It's not right
[2:06:17] to give the bread of the children
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; to the dogs
[2:06:28] says
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; he called her a dog.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; If the pastor
[2:06:39] through the preaching
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; calls us pigs
[2:06:45] We we get all bent out of shape.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; If they call us crows,
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; keep on. That woman didn't back off.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, she didn't say, "Oh, Jesus. Oh, who
[2:07:04] are you? Oh, why? Why you give me lack
[2:07:07] of respect?"
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:07:13] Someone told the woman, "It's true.
[2:07:16] You're a dog. You're a gentile.
[2:07:22] You cannot eat of the bread because it's
[2:07:25] for the children. It's for Israel.
[2:07:29] But I'm going to tell you." And she was
[2:07:32] all the scene was at a standstill.
[2:07:35] And Jesus was watching.
[2:07:38] He was observing
[2:07:40] how there how there was an angel there
[2:07:43] influencing that woman
[2:07:45] and Jesus was waiting for the moment.
[2:07:49] He has a reason. The Lord has he has a
[2:07:51] rightful reason. You are a dog. You're a
[2:07:54] gentile. You have no right to sit at the
[2:07:58] table and eat the bread because it's for
[2:08:01] the Jews.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; But I'm going give you a little
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; hint.
[2:08:08] I give you a little uh uh tip of
[2:08:11] something that happened before
[2:08:13] a pre there's a pre vision.
[2:08:18] There was also back then a dog like you
[2:08:21] named Ruth the Moabitete. Her could not
[2:08:25] eat of the bread
[2:08:27] that was in the camp of Boaz, but she
[2:08:30] could eat from the crumbs that fell from
[2:08:33] the table. And the woman said, "Lord,
[2:08:37] that's true, I cannot eat from the bread
[2:08:39] there, but Ruth, according to the law,
[2:08:43] that gentile like I'm a gentile could
[2:08:47] eat from the crumbs, the give it to me
[2:08:50] at least the crumbs."
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:08:54] Jesus said, "Great is your faith."
[2:08:59] God
[2:09:00] wants to see
[2:09:02] what kind of level of faith we have
[2:09:06] if we believe only
[2:09:10] at the end of the month.
[2:09:14] Do you know that the the most best
[2:09:16] service are the ones that are that are
[2:09:17] charged?
[2:09:20] When the when the dollar is in your
[2:09:21] pocket,
[2:09:23] the most glorious reunions in the
[2:09:24] church, we all come happy.
[2:09:27] I'm going to happy to that place
[2:09:31] by faith in God
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; when the money goes disappearing.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; I'm going happy to church
[2:09:41] to serve the Lord
[2:09:43] when there's nothing.
[2:09:53] Our life
[2:09:56] cannot depend on what we have economy uh
[2:09:58] economy in in the economy. We have to
[2:10:01] depend of the God that's so great that's
[2:10:04] here
[2:10:08] Jesus.
[2:10:09] We're going to be closing now the time
[2:10:12] that we have that I'm preaching
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; because I'm now in the future
[2:10:19] the and on the 21st is when I go back to
[2:10:21] to Spain and I'll go back
[2:10:24] because in in back in my land we're
[2:10:26] eight hours ahead right now. Right now
[2:10:28] it's already nine o'clock in in my
[2:10:29] hometown
[2:10:31] coming into the future.
[2:10:34] On the 21st I'm going to go back into
[2:10:35] the past.
[2:10:42] Jesus
[2:10:44] according to the scriptures
[2:10:46] had to come as a lamb.
[2:10:49] That's why when the angel presents
[2:10:51] himself to Mary
[2:10:53] Mary accepts the word
[2:10:57] and and she's begun of the spirit
[2:10:59] overshadows
[2:11:00] when when she gives forth birth.
[2:11:04] She she gives forth birth and there's a
[2:11:06] scent or fulfill
[2:11:09] that she has to come back to the earth
[2:11:12] from the origin of the birth and it was
[2:11:15] to fulfill the scriptures
[2:11:17] because the scripture had to be born in
[2:11:19] Benary
[2:11:20] when when Mary and
[2:11:22] And Joseph,
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; Joseph,
[2:11:27] as a good as a good man, as a good
[2:11:29] husband,
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; he wanted the best for his wife.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; So he called a star of a hotel.
[2:11:40] Hotel
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; a hotel.
[2:11:45] Oh, he he wanted to find a five-star
[2:11:47] hotel
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; and and and the keeper came out.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; Good evening.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; Good evening.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; Is there logic for us
[2:12:02] for me and my wife
[2:12:05] when the keeper there sees Mary that
[2:12:09] she's pregnant?
[2:12:15] The scriptures say
[2:12:18] that the keeper said for you
[2:12:22] there's no place.
[2:12:24] When he says for you there's no place
[2:12:27] that's to say that for others there is
[2:12:29] but for them.
[2:12:31] Now why was there no room in a hotel?
[2:12:36] Because the lambs brother Brandham said
[2:12:39] are not born in a hotel. Lambs are born
[2:12:42] in a stable. And Jesus being the lamb of
[2:12:45] God was not going to be born in a hotel.
[2:12:48] He had to be born in a stable.
[2:12:53] When Jesus is born,
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; the angels arrive.
[2:13:01] They're in Jerusalem.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; There they see there all
[2:13:09] the leaders are there. They see him and
[2:13:11] they pass over them
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; and they go to the mountains
[2:13:21] and there in the mountains were pastors.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; Why does the devil want to take away the
[2:13:27] pastors?
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; When the pastors, brother Brandham says,
[2:13:32] why did it have to be shepherds? Why a
[2:13:34] shepherd?
[2:13:36] Why a shepherd? Because a shepherd knows
[2:13:40] how to take care of his sheep. That's
[2:13:42] what the prophet said. It was a pastor,
[2:13:44] a sheep, a shepherd.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; And the shepherds,
[2:13:50] they went
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; to see the lamb
[2:13:55] because a pastor smells like a lamb.
[2:13:58] Kyifas did not smell like a lamb.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; He smelled like perfume cologne
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; with his tremendous vestures.
[2:14:07] It could go into a a stable
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; because it's filth.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; But the pastors,
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; thank you, Jesus.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; I'm at home.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:36] When Jesus is taken there being the
[2:14:38] lamb,
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; he begins his ministry.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; He goes to Jordan
[2:14:47] gets close to Jordan.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; And there was a man named John.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; Repent ye therefore
[2:14:56] generation of vipers,
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; repent.
[2:15:04] The Bible says
[2:15:06] that the baptism of John,
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; it was of repentance.
[2:15:12] Repent ye.
[2:15:14] And when he does, he gets a turn. He
[2:15:16] sees Jesus there.
[2:15:25] If my baptism
[2:15:27] is for repentance,
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; then you got
[2:15:36] then what does he have to repent of?
[2:15:38] Huh?
[2:15:41] Okay. Wait, wait, wait a moment.
[2:15:57] Why? Why? Why have you come here?
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; I have to be baptized by you.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; That so it's written.
[2:16:07] You were baptized with the Holy Spirit
[2:16:09] and fire.
[2:16:11] What are you doing here?
[2:16:14] My My baptism is for repentance. It's
[2:16:16] for the sinners.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; And you, what do you have to repent of?
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; He says, John,
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; settle down.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; It's necessary that the scriptures be
[2:16:30] fulfilled. And brother Brandham says
[2:16:33] that to be fulfilled is that a lamb
[2:16:36] before being sacrificed
[2:16:39] had to be washed
[2:16:41] by Jesus. He was a lamb.
[2:16:45] And when John understands this,
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; he he washes the lamb. Look,
[2:16:58] Jesus fulfilled two purposes. Enjoyed
[2:17:00] it. Brenham says
[2:17:06] speaking of the scripture Jesus Christ
[2:17:08] is the same yesterday, today and forever
[2:17:11] that he that was yesterday was a prophet
[2:17:14] was an eagle. I say it was an eagle who
[2:17:18] was a prophet that was yesterday.
[2:17:22] The prophet says he was a lamb and a
[2:17:25] high priest and that is to come is a
[2:17:28] king is a lion.
[2:17:32] the eagle,
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; lamb,
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; and the lion, the prophet,
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; the high priest, and the king
[2:17:42] when Jesus is the lamb.
[2:17:46] And as a lamb, he has to be washed.
[2:17:51] You know why Jesus had to go to to John
[2:17:54] so that John could wash him?
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; The the the lamb had to be washed by a
[2:17:59] high priest.
[2:18:01] And John the Baptist
[2:18:03] came through the the the the lineage of
[2:18:05] a high priest. So John the Baptist
[2:18:09] came through the lineage of the high
[2:18:10] priests,
[2:18:12] but John the Baptist
[2:18:14] was was showing
[2:18:16] the priesthood that was coming now
[2:18:20] was not one according to that of Aaron.
[2:18:23] Now the high priestship that came
[2:18:26] was according to the high ship or the
[2:18:29] the Melkisedc the priesthood of
[2:18:32] Melkisedc. And when Jesus is in front of
[2:18:34] of Caiaphas and Caiaphas tells him
[2:18:38] are you the son of God? Are you the one
[2:18:40] that the high the son of God? He said
[2:18:45] you have said it
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; rips his his vesture.
[2:18:52] Do you know why he ripped his vesture?
[2:18:54] Because the limit,
[2:18:56] the the lay of the high priest, a high
[2:18:59] priest, a super high priest that would
[2:19:02] rip his garment on that same day,
[2:19:06] his high priest shipped
[2:19:09] because he had ripped that covering
[2:19:11] because he was showing
[2:19:13] that the his his ship had finished
[2:19:16] office and he was giving a movement to
[2:19:18] the new high priest that was coming.
[2:19:21] according to Melkisedc
[2:19:24] Jesus in Jordan
[2:19:26] washed as a lamb.
[2:19:30] But not only was he a lamb, he was a
[2:19:32] high priest. And as a high priest, high
[2:19:36] priest before he administers,
[2:19:39] has to be washed. Not only washed,
[2:19:43] had to be anointed. That's why Jesus
[2:19:46] said being the high priest
[2:19:49] he is washed in Jordan and he's also
[2:19:52] anointed when the anointing the fill of
[2:19:56] fire the locust
[2:20:00] the the rose of Sharon comes to anoint
[2:20:03] him. John understands that Jesus
[2:20:09] is someone special
[2:20:11] that he washed the lamb. When the lamb
[2:20:14] comes out,
[2:20:18] Juan doesn't signal
[2:20:21] because he understands the scripture
[2:20:22] now. And he signals and he says, "Behold
[2:20:25] the lamb of God that takes away the sins
[2:20:27] of the world.
[2:20:30] When the lamb grows,
[2:20:32] a lamb according to the law
[2:20:36] before being sacrificed
[2:20:38] had to be bound."
[2:20:42] You remember with is with Isaac
[2:20:45] when and Abraham takes Mount Eram
[2:20:48] and and he binds Isaac is because the
[2:20:51] lamb had to be tied up. That's why Jesus
[2:20:54] in Gethsemane before being sacrificed
[2:20:57] they also tied him up
[2:21:05] the lamb
[2:21:07] had to be without no defects. They
[2:21:10] interrogated him. They went to go to
[2:21:13] pilot and the pilot there goes a lamb to
[2:21:16] pilot now.
[2:21:19] Wednesday is Thursday, Friday, and
[2:21:20] Saturday. Four days, the lamb was being
[2:21:22] examined.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet says it.
[2:21:27] Pilot examines him.
[2:21:33] He take him to Herod.
[2:21:35] He goes bound up to Herodas.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; Herod.
[2:21:41] take him back to to Pilate. There goes a
[2:21:43] lamb back to Pilot.
[2:21:45] What was taking place here?
[2:21:48] They're examining the lamb and pilot.
[2:21:53] And he placed the lamb in front of the
[2:21:56] people and said to them, "I don't find
[2:22:00] no defect in this lamb. He's ready to be
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; sacrificed.
[2:22:09] as a lamb. That's what Isaia says is as
[2:22:12] a lamb. He was taken to the slaughter
[2:22:15] house and as a lamb
[2:22:20] because not only was he a lamb, but he
[2:22:22] was as a lamb,
[2:22:25] but also like a sheep.
[2:22:29] Hey, how come that that Jesus said as as
[2:22:31] a sheep
[2:22:33] before his accusers?
[2:22:38] Because a lamb cannot give forth light
[2:22:41] because he's the male,
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; but a sheep can give forth life. And
[2:22:45] Jesus as a as as a sheep as a lamb as a
[2:22:49] sheep had to give light
[2:22:53] that's why on Calvary
[2:22:55] what took place there. It was a parting
[2:22:59] of him. But says for a life to come
[2:23:02] forth there's to be water, blood and
[2:23:06] life. Abraham says that Jesus on Calvary
[2:23:11] he shed water
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; blood and his life.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; Because to Jesus
[2:23:24] they made him a uh society.
[2:23:29] Oh, they gave him a a C-section.
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; You and I, we were in Jesus
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; and a Roman centurion.
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; He He nailed his spear there.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; Spearino.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, the name of Gino.
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; He He name was Gino. He he put forth his
[2:23:55] advance
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; and he passed through the heart.
[2:23:59] pass the heart and he took it out and
[2:24:02] water came out, blood and also life came
[2:24:06] out because from there brother Ben says
[2:24:09] came out the bride of Jesus Christ you
[2:24:12] and I
[2:24:13] come from Calvary. Amen. You and I we
[2:24:17] come from Calvary. Jesus as a lamb
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; had a a party.
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; He gave forth birth to a bride.
[2:24:29] redeemed bride
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; through the blood.
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter
[2:24:36] &gt;&gt; how the devil comes at your life.
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter
[2:24:42] in what situation you might find
[2:24:43] yourself.
[2:24:45] You have a promise from God
[2:24:50] that he that has begun the work in you.
[2:24:54] How many has God began the work in you?
[2:24:56] Lift your hand. If God has done
[2:24:57] something in your life, has he done
[2:24:59] something in your life? Has he has he
[2:25:01] started something in your life? My Bible
[2:25:04] tells me, my Bible tells me that he's
[2:25:07] begun something in me.
[2:25:09] He will perfect it.
[2:25:12] It doesn't depend on you. It doesn't
[2:25:14] depend on me, it depends on him. Because
[2:25:17] the Bible says that even though you
[2:25:20] don't want to you don't want he the
[2:25:24] Bible says will produce in us. He will
[2:25:28] produce in us the desire how to do by
[2:25:34] his goodwill.
[2:25:35] Maybe you don't want to now.
[2:25:38] But God will begin to produce in you a
[2:25:40] desire to to make do what you want to
[2:25:42] do. And you're going to do it. May God
[2:25:46] bless you.
[2:25:47] We stand to our feet.
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Mark.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; Marvel, marvelous God,
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; we thank you, loving God, for your word
[2:26:02] and for your help. Amen.
[2:26:07] We are so needy of you.
[2:26:11] Try to have spoken words of
[2:26:13] encouragement,
[2:26:15] something that can help.
[2:26:17] But we are so insufficient.
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; Bless Lord
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; this church.
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; Bless the offices.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; Bless the pastor and his family
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; that your grace.
[2:26:35] May he continue to take control of this
[2:26:37] place
[2:26:40] and be able to express
[2:26:43] the the the theme this morning that I
[2:26:45] brought forth.
[2:26:47] May your Holy Spirit
[2:26:49] that one that does know
[2:26:53] can take what has been said and place it
[2:26:54] in their hearts
[2:26:57] at in every place where they need to be
[2:26:59] added
[2:27:02] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:27:04] Help us to understand
[2:27:07] that you as a lamb
[2:27:09] you carried every one of our sins
[2:27:12] that you as a lamb
[2:27:15] to our sicknesses.
[2:27:17] &gt;&gt; Don't permit
[2:27:20] that any person
[2:27:22] leave from this place sick
[2:27:25] or leave as a sinner but permit
[2:27:29] that the Holy Spirit
[2:27:32] bring healing.
[2:27:34] upon every person.
[2:27:37] Lift our faith.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you for everything.
[2:27:40] Thank you for brother Mark. Thank you
[2:27:43] for the opportunity in the name of the
[2:27:46] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen and amen. How
[2:27:50] many send greetings
[2:27:52] to Madrid, Spain? Amen.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:27:58] [Applause]
[2:28:02] We certainly appreciate the word of the
[2:28:04] Lord this morning. That was the word for
[2:28:07] us this morning and we certainly enjoy
[2:28:10] that. Amen. Is there anyone here that
[2:28:13] needs special prayer? Uh we like to make
[2:28:15] that available to you and um I'd have
[2:28:19] our brother pray for you if there's
[2:28:22] someone that needs that. And let's sing
[2:28:25] that song, The Great Emancipator.
[2:28:28] [Music]
[2:28:31] Once
[2:28:33] my heart so fed
[2:28:37] better
[2:28:39] by
[2:28:41] the binding chains of sin.
[2:28:46] [Music]
[2:28:47] Oh, but
[2:28:50] the pretty manipator.
[2:28:56] Oh, he said
[2:28:59] be free to worship him.

[2:29:08] glory, hallelujah.
[2:29:12] [Music]

[2:29:40] and like
[2:29:42] a lost lamb I was praying.
[2:29:49] Oh, so helpless and alone.
[2:29:58] But the seeking shepherd, how many
[2:30:03] remember when he found you
[2:30:05] and he led me to my father's home?
[2:30:13] Singing, singing glory,
[2:30:16] bringing glory,
[2:30:18] hallelujah.

[2:30:52] Glory. Hallelujah.
[2:30:55] Oh yeah.
[2:30:58] Blessed
[2:31:00] be his holy name.
[2:31:03] [Music]
[2:31:08] The great event
[2:31:15] and the song of the redee.
[2:31:22] Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of
[2:31:24] praise.
[2:31:28] Amen. So, let's bow our heads for a word
[2:31:30] of prayer. Amen. and and give you the
[2:31:32] opportunity
[2:31:34] to consecrate
[2:31:36] uh these words that you heard,
[2:31:40] consecrate
[2:31:41] the words that you heard to your life.
[2:31:44] How does this apply to your life? Were
[2:31:47] these just words so we can dismiss the
[2:31:50] service? Or was there something in there
[2:31:53] that was eternal speaking to your heart
[2:31:56] and your life? and everyone here that
[2:31:59] has a need in your life. Lord Jesus, the
[2:32:02] great lamb
[2:32:04] who took away all the sins of the world,
[2:32:07] he's here to meet those needs.
[2:32:10] Of course, the altar is open for you to
[2:32:13] come if you want to come forward
[2:32:16] publicly and pray.
[2:32:18] But if you're sitting there in your seat
[2:32:20] today, this opportunity,
[2:32:23] we let them come and go so many times.
[2:32:26] And I I don't want to be responsible for
[2:32:28] that. I want to give you the opportunity
[2:32:31] to just settle something in your heart
[2:32:33] and in your mind
[2:32:35] of that the angel of the Lord
[2:32:40] is watching over every scene in your
[2:32:43] life.
[2:32:44] All the scenes.
[2:32:47] He was there all the time. He's there
[2:32:50] right now.
[2:32:52] And he will meet the need in your life
[2:32:55] if you'll only let him.
[2:32:58] He's a gentleman. He won't force, but
[2:33:00] he'll give you the opportunity. And
[2:33:02] today, this morning, a scene is being
[2:33:05] set for you.
[2:33:07] And we're just going to um with your
[2:33:11] head bowed, every eye closed. If there's
[2:33:13] a need in your life and you want to
[2:33:15] dedicate that to the Lord, I don't know
[2:33:17] what it is. I really don't know, but I
[2:33:20] feel in my heart to do this and there's
[2:33:23] a need in your life. Why don't you slip
[2:33:25] up your hand to him today
[2:33:28] for a special request for the Lord Jesus
[2:33:32] to
[2:33:34] reveal the angel of the Lord
[2:33:38] to let him come out in the forefront
[2:33:42] and reveal himself to you. Lord Jesus
[2:33:45] sees all of those hands.
[2:33:48] I'm going to ask brother Juan and
[2:33:51] brother Mark to come back up here. And I
[2:33:54] want my brother to pray for these hands
[2:33:56] that are raised here.
[2:33:59] And
[2:34:01] if you have a need, if you need a touch
[2:34:03] in your body, you know, he's the healer
[2:34:06] of your body,
[2:34:09] they'll lay hands on the sick. They
[2:34:10] shall recover.
[2:34:13] Those are divine promises that our Lord
[2:34:15] Jesus made. He was wounded for our
[2:34:20] transgressions.
[2:34:22] With his stripes, we are healed.
[2:34:26] The healing is in the room today for
[2:34:29] you. Amen. With those heads bow bowed
[2:34:32] and brother Juan and brother Mark, why
[2:34:36] don't you pray the prayer of faith for
[2:34:38] them?
[2:34:40] Amen.
[2:34:48] most powerful almighty God.
[2:34:52] You that are the God of Abraham,
[2:34:54] &gt;&gt; the God of Isaac,
[2:34:57] &gt;&gt; and the God of Jacob,
[2:35:00] the God that knows our thoughts
[2:35:03] and our needs.
[2:35:06] The God that said, "I'll not leave you,
[2:35:09] neither will I forsake you."
[2:35:13] The God that said all that you ask
[2:35:14] believing
[2:35:16] &gt;&gt; you shall receive it.
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; Father
[2:35:20] to know the hands that are lifted,
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; those that are raised up
[2:35:26] and you know their needs
[2:35:28] in their hearts.
[2:35:31] Be merciful
[2:35:34] and shed yourself upon them
[2:35:37] in the power of healing,
[2:35:39] in the power of salvation.
[2:35:42] In the power of restoration,
[2:35:45] the power of freedom
[2:35:47] in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:35:50] manifest thyself.
[2:35:52] We have spoken of you. We have spoken of
[2:35:55] your word.
[2:35:57] We believe you are the same
[2:36:00] and forever and ever. Your holy spirit
[2:36:02] is here to bless to help. Father, help
[2:36:08] us.
[2:36:09] That is my prayer. Satan,
[2:36:13] in the name of Jesus,
[2:36:16] I rebuke you by the word
[2:36:17] &gt;&gt; and I order you
[2:36:20] to you return back to those.
[2:36:24] healing of your body,
[2:36:27] the healing of the the body of the soul
[2:36:29] because we believe
[2:36:32] by his stripes
[2:36:35] have been healed.
[2:36:37] By the stripes of Jesus Christ, we have
[2:36:40] been pardoned.
[2:36:42] So you have no, you have no
[2:36:46] in this place. And I rebuke you in the
[2:36:50] name of Jesus. I order you to leave
[2:36:53] every life from every heart
[2:36:58] because we claiming a total deliverance
[2:37:02] in the name of Jesus.
[2:37:04] Supply every need.
[2:37:07] We give you all the glory, all the
[2:37:09] honor, all veneration because we know
[2:37:14] that you hear us because we are your
[2:37:16] children.
[2:37:17] In the name of Jesus,
[2:37:19] &gt;&gt; thank you father.
[2:37:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:22] &gt;&gt; And amen.
[2:37:24] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[2:37:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, my brother. Amen. Ask brother
[2:37:31] John to come and sing a little bit.
[2:37:32] Let's sing that I bless your name.
[2:37:36] Sister Heather shared with me a
[2:37:38] testimony in 1 Chronicles 21 or 22.
[2:37:43] 1 Chronicles 20 where the Israel begin
[2:37:47] to pray. They the the great battle was
[2:37:50] raging and they were being threatened
[2:37:53] and the Lord told them they would not
[2:37:55] have to fight. But while they began to
[2:37:58] praise the Lord and worship the Lord,
[2:38:00] the Lord set ambushes and he defeated
[2:38:03] the entire army. And I believe that
[2:38:06] sometimes we can just praise and worship
[2:38:08] him and he's already fought the battle
[2:38:11] for us.
[2:38:12] But he deserves our praise. Amen.
[2:38:15] &gt;&gt; Can we praise him?
[2:38:17] &gt;&gt; Is he worthy first?
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; Who who alone is worthy? It's only the
[2:38:23] lamb that is worthy to receive praise.
[2:38:26] So let's just praise him just for a
[2:38:28] moment in this song just before we go.
[2:38:30] Brother John, you prepare to come. I
[2:38:33] bless your name.
[2:38:38] I bless your name.

[2:39:12] I bless your name. Let's sing that first
[2:39:16] verse on that.
[2:39:18] In prisoners sh
[2:39:27] [Music]
[2:39:31] all
[2:39:37] pray that night
[2:39:42] and in their pain
[2:39:47] they began to sing.
[2:39:53] Their chains were loose
[2:39:57] [Music]
[2:39:59] and they were free.
[2:40:03] They sang, "I bless your name. I bless
[2:40:06] your name.
[2:40:12] I bless your name.
[2:40:18] I give you honor.
[2:40:21] [Music]
[2:40:24] Give you praise.
[2:40:29] You are the life,
[2:40:35] the truth, the way.
[2:40:42] I bless your name.
[2:40:48] I bless your name. And some midnight
[2:40:51] hour,
[2:40:54] some midnight hour.
[2:41:00] If you stood,
[2:41:04] [Music]
[2:41:06] you're in a present
[2:41:12] in your mind.
[2:41:18] Reach out and praise.
[2:41:23] [Applause]
[2:41:24] Unify
[2:41:25] those chains.
[2:41:27] [Applause]
[2:41:28] [Music]
[2:41:30] and they will fall
[2:41:36] in Jesus name.
[2:41:40] [Music]
[2:41:42] I bless your name.
[2:41:48] I bless your name.
[2:41:54] I give you honor.
[2:42:01] Give you praise.
[2:42:06] You are the life,
[2:42:12] the truth, the way. Let's sing that
[2:42:16] again. Lord, you are the life. You are
[2:42:19] the life.
[2:42:24] the truth.
[2:42:28] I bless your name. I bless your name.
[2:42:36] I bless your name. Oh, your name is
[2:42:40] Jesus.

[2:43:19] I bless your name.
[2:43:22] [Music]
[2:43:25] I bless your name.
[2:43:31] Maybe we could just sing one more before
[2:43:33] brother Mark, if you could dismiss us
[2:43:34] with a word of prayer. In the key of F,
[2:43:36] Sister Sharon. Jesus, lamb of God,
[2:43:41] you are my strength when I am weak. You
[2:43:46] are the treasure that I see. You are my
[2:43:51] all in all.
[2:44:00] seeking you as a precious jewel. Lord,
[2:44:05] to give up I feel a fool. You are my all
[2:44:12] and all.
[2:44:16] [Music]
[2:44:18] Jesus,
[2:44:22] you're the lamb. Oh God,
[2:44:28] worthy
[2:44:30] is
[2:44:32] your name.
[2:44:35] [Music]
[2:44:38] Jesus,
[2:44:43] lamb of God,
[2:44:48] worthy
[2:44:50] is your name. The second verse, taking
[2:44:55] my sin, my cross, my shame.
[2:44:59] Taking my sins, my cross, my shame.
[2:45:04] Rising again, I bless your name. You are
[2:45:10] my all.
[2:45:12] How many can say this today? Lord, when
[2:45:15] I fall down, you pick me up. And when I
[2:45:20] fall down, you pick me up.
[2:45:24] When I am dry, you fill my cup. You are
[2:45:30] my all
[2:45:33] in all
[2:45:38] Jesus.
[2:45:39] [Music]
[2:45:42] You're the lamb
[2:45:44] of God.
[2:45:48] Worthy
[2:45:50] is
[2:45:52] your name,
[2:45:58] Jesus.
[2:45:59] [Music]
[2:46:02] You're the lamb
[2:46:05] of God.
[2:46:08] Worthy
[2:46:11] is
[2:46:13] your name.
[2:46:14] [Music]
[2:46:17] Precious heavenly father,
[2:46:20] if the feeling and the anointing
[2:46:23] at this moment is as it is,
[2:46:27] yet in our earthly condition, Father,
[2:46:30] what will it be when we are there
[2:46:32] gathered around the throne?
[2:46:34] The prophet says that when we are there,
[2:46:36] the bride of Jesus Christ gathered
[2:46:38] around the throne to crown you, that the
[2:46:40] angels will be there with their heads
[2:46:42] bowed.
[2:46:44] They don't know what it is to be lost.
[2:46:47] They don't know what it is to be
[2:46:49] redeemed. They don't know the struggles
[2:46:51] of life, the hardships, losing a loved
[2:46:55] one, father, depression. They don't know
[2:46:58] what suicidal thoughts are, Lord. And
[2:47:00] they'll just bow their heads and they'll
[2:47:04] wander in amazement. What did these
[2:47:06] people go through
[2:47:12] that they can stand here and they can
[2:47:15] praise your name, Father. What a blessed
[2:47:19] people we are, Lord, to we have been
[2:47:21] redeemed by your precious blood, Father.
[2:47:24] Lord, we're so blessed to be living in
[2:47:26] this glorious hour, Father. the most
[2:47:29] darkest, the most gruesome hour, Father,
[2:47:32] but it is the most glorious hour because
[2:47:34] one day, Lord, you're coming for a
[2:47:37] bride. But until then, Father, we need
[2:47:39] you to guide us to speak to us, Lord. We
[2:47:44] need your word to keep quickening us,
[2:47:46] Father, until the last message is
[2:47:49] preached, till that song is sung.
[2:47:51] Father, the last sick person has been
[2:47:53] healed, Lord. Father, bless this
[2:47:55] sanctuary. Bless the ministry. Bless
[2:47:58] your people. Bless brother Juan Gawad in
[2:48:01] his ministry. Lord, his people in Spain.
[2:48:03] Bless them, Father. They are your bride
[2:48:06] also, Lord. And we commit them into your
[2:48:08] hands. Dismiss us not from your
[2:48:10] presence, but from one another. And may
[2:48:12] we come back this evening, Lord, with
[2:48:14] expectation of receiving our double
[2:48:17] portion, Lord, because your word is the
[2:48:19] same yesterday, today, and forever. We
[2:48:24] ask all these things in the precious
[2:48:26] name of Jesus.
[2:48:28] Amen.
[2:48:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're dismissed. If you'd like to
[2:48:34] go, we'll just sing that chorus.
[2:48:37] A couple more. Just continue to worship.
[2:48:39] Enjoy his presence today.
[2:48:42] Jesus,
[2:48:47] you're the lamb of God.
[2:48:53] Worthy

[2:54:57] Among the peaks my soul can be found.
[2:55:07] An unexpected
[2:55:09] storm
