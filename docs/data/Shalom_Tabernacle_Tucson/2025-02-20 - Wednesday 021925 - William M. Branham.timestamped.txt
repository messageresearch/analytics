[12:24] [Music]
[12:27] you John would you be able to come and
[12:30] take your song
[12:33] please bless you brother
[12:40] John amen just a quick testimony um not
[12:45] so much just a testimony but just
[12:47] something that I was um goes with the
[12:50] testimony I wanted to share as well uh
[12:52] you know Paul imagine had a lot of time
[12:54] to to just think and meditate and pray
[12:59] and you know he was rested multiple
[13:02] times and so just reading in Ephesians 6
[13:05] where he tells us to be strong in the
[13:07] Lord and the power of His might and then
[13:10] tells us how to do that put on the whole
[13:12] armor of God and I think how many times
[13:14] did Paul see a Roman soldier and he's
[13:17] probably in his mind going through and
[13:19] here's all the things that you can do
[13:21] but you go through the whole armor of
[13:23] God none of those are the power of His
[13:25] might at the end of that it's praying
[13:27] always and and that's where you know
[13:30] we're told that prayer is the greatest
[13:31] weapon that we have and so I just
[13:34] thought you know that's the power of His
[13:35] might and just wanted to share that
[13:37] having the prayer meeting tonight we had
[13:39] a prayer request a couple weeks ago for
[13:41] my brother Joe and so it may be a a book
[13:46] of prayer requests but just want to
[13:48] thank the Lord that the first chapter
[13:50] God answered the request for the first
[13:52] chapter today and so we just wanted to
[13:55] praise him and was thinking of a song
[13:56] what what can we sing I just want to
[13:58] thank the Lord for his goodness and know
[14:00] that he's going to be faithful to
[14:02] complete the the work that he
[14:06] began when you're up against a
[14:10] struggle that shatters all your
[14:13] dreams and your hopes have been cruy
[14:17] crushed by Satan's manifested
[14:22] scheme and you feel the urge within you
[14:27] to submit to wor ly
[14:30] fears don't let the faith you're
[14:34] standing in seem to
[14:38] disappear but praise the
[14:42] Lord he can work through those who
[14:46] praise him praise the
[14:51] Lord for our God inhabits
[14:55] praise praise the Lord
[14:59] for the chains that seem to bind you
[15:04] they serve only to remind you that
[15:07] they'll drop powerless behind you when
[15:12] you
[15:14] praise
[15:19] him now Satan is a
[15:23] liar and he wants to make us
[15:26] think that we are POS ERS when he knows
[15:31] himself we're Children of the king so
[15:36] lift up the mighty Shield of faith for
[15:40] the battle must be won we know that
[15:44] Jesus Christ is a living hand The Works
[15:49] already done oh praise the
[15:55] Lord he can work through those who
[15:59] praise him
[16:00] praise the
[16:03] Lord for our God
[16:06] inhabits praise praise the
[16:11] Lord for the chains that seem to bind
[16:15] you they serve only to remind you that
[16:20] they'll drop powerless behind you when
[16:25] you
[16:26] praise him when you
[16:30] praise him when you

[16:39] him when you

[17:11] Lord for the chains that seem to bind
[17:15] you they serve only to remind you that

[48:37] again no sir you can breed hybrid K but
[48:40] you plant that hybrid K back over again
[48:41] you get nothing you got to rebreed it
[48:43] each time because God said let every
[48:46] seed bring forth of its kind Now by high
[48:49] breeding things look what the world's
[48:51] got into today I was reading an article
[48:53] here how the Readers Digest more 20
[48:56] years and now when won't have babies if
[48:57] it keeps on they're eating hybrid food
[49:00] the thing of it is they've hybrid it and
[49:02] that's not a way a human being was made
[49:03] to eat that kind of food it was made to
[49:06] meet it to eat it in the way it was
[49:08] created that's the reason today that
[49:10] they can't keep meats and everything is
[49:13] the way it is is because it's hybrid hot
[49:15] planted and every kind of a way it's
[49:17] just all mixed up it's got to where the
[49:20] entire human race is being destroyed by
[49:23] their own achievements but trying to
[49:25] take something that God made good and
[49:27] turn it around and make it some other
[49:29] way in their own way leave it the way
[49:31] God made it it's even got into a place
[49:33] to where they're uh trying to high breed
[49:36] the churches today from the real baptism
[49:39] of the Holy Ghost to a handshake some
[49:41] kind of a sprinkling to a water baptism
[49:43] oh my the whole thing's hybrid we want
[49:46] to get back a hybrid plant you have to
[49:48] bathe it and spray it and keep the bugs
[49:50] and beetles off of it but not a genuine
[49:53] healthy plant he's sturdy strong no bugs
[49:57] come on him he's got enough in him to
[49:59] throw the bug off so is a genuine
[50:02] Christian you don't have to babe him and
[50:03] Pat him and tell him this that other
[50:05] he's got something ined the baptism of
[50:07] the Holy Ghost that throws all the rest
[50:08] of it out you don't have to beg him
[50:11] around because he's a genuine plan of
[50:14] God he's got something in him at Wars a
[50:17] Christian fights for every inch of
[50:18] ground he stands on he must do that if
[50:21] he ever expects to exist and by doing
[50:23] something in him that takes care of him
[50:26] Eve tried to hybrid the word in the
[50:27] beginning God told her the day you eat
[50:29] thereof that day you die she tried to
[50:31] breed it in with knowledge it's Satan
[50:33] give her and when she did she lost the
[50:35] whole human race right there to the
[50:37] devil when she tried to mix God's
[50:41] unadulterated word with knowledge it
[50:43] doesn't come from the knowledge of the
[50:45] world it comes by the power of the Holy
[50:47] Spirit not by power by my but by my
[50:49] spirit saith the Lord that's how God
[50:52] does it God's word is a seed of eternal
[50:55] life if you try to hybrid it what will
[50:57] you do you'll kill yourself with it it
[51:00] will not work it will not mix the more
[51:02] than all our water ever mix it will not
[51:06] do it they have never in all the way
[51:09] tried to find anything that's better
[51:10] than God's way of doing it you know
[51:12] they've never found a way better for a
[51:14] chicken to get bned in this world than
[51:16] pecky out of a shell did you know that
[51:18] they never have found a better way the
[51:20] little Fell's barn with a little snoot
[51:22] on the end of his on the end of his bill
[51:24] and that little Bill he got to go to
[51:26] work go to scratching scratching back
[51:28] and forth till he gets his head started
[51:30] gets his head up picks his way free it's
[51:32] God's provided way you pull him out of
[51:34] the shell it'll kill him he won't live
[51:36] if you pull him out of the shell he has
[51:38] to come God's way that's what some
[51:40] Christians today we so soft soaked him
[51:41] and shuck their hands and brought them
[51:43] in by secret and Jared them into the
[51:45] church what they need is an oldfashioned
[51:47] prayer Al where they pray through until
[51:50] using themselves go come in God's
[51:52] provided way till they free themselves
[51:54] from the world trouble of today her name
[51:56] on the book and John church and that's
[51:58] all there is to it but God's way
[52:00] provided way is to stay there and work
[52:03] your way through until God gives you the
[52:05] new birth that's exactly right it came
[52:08] out it'll kill him that's what's the
[52:10] matter today with the people the new
[52:11] birth they all Dodge it they don't like
[52:13] it oh they are substituted something for
[52:15] a New Birth come up and believe and
[52:17] that's all you have to do the devil
[52:19] believes himself and you know he's not
[52:20] born again there's a new birth there
[52:23] something goes with it it's kind of
[52:24] unfitting untas to the world any birth
[52:27] is a mess I don't care where it's that
[52:29] it's in the pig bin or or a hospital a
[52:32] birth is a mess so is the new birth
[52:34] it'll make you do things you didn't
[52:35] think you would do it make you get out
[52:37] the altar cry screen wash the paint off
[52:39] your face raise your hands praise God
[52:41] speak in tongues and all kinds of things
[52:43] a new birth will do that because it's
[52:46] God's provided way to be born again you
[52:48] have to die you have to die before you
[52:50] can be reborn any seed has to die before
[52:53] it's regenerated again unless it dies it
[52:56] dieses alone a man's got to die to his
[52:58] own thinking he's got to die to the
[53:00] thinking of anything but God's word and
[53:02] come his way amen that's God's ground we
[53:05] don't meet him on our thoughts we meet
[53:07] him on what he said do that's God's
[53:09] provided Way Part people Dodge it they
[53:12] don't want it but it's true just the
[53:14] same it'll it produces death you have to
[53:17] die die to your thinking well I know the
[53:20] Bible says it but I can't understand it
[53:21] then stay there till God reveals it amen
[53:23] that's right it's got that's the new
[53:25] birth ducks in geese they've never found
[53:27] a better way for them to go south in the
[53:29] Swarm first that's right you'll see them
[53:32] all get together and they'll come
[53:34] themselves some kind of an instinct
[53:35] draws them together and they get
[53:37] together and swarm before they fly
[53:39] before they go south what is it it's
[53:41] revival time when they all get together
[53:44] do you ever hear such a chatter in your
[53:45] life as you hear them geese get together
[53:47] or them dogs I never heard such and they
[53:50] have there's no other better way for him
[53:51] to do it and the times up in the North
[53:53] Woods I watched The First beginning of
[53:55] the cold weather in Canada
[53:57] a bunch of ducks born right there on
[53:58] that Lake they've never been off that
[54:00] Lake this little fell hasn't and the
[54:02] first thing you know a cold breeze comes
[54:04] down from the north this little little
[54:06] old Drake he's just born to leader gets
[54:08] right out there in the middle of that
[54:09] pond sticks his little Honker up in the
[54:11] air honks four or five times and every
[54:13] duck on the pond comes right to him and
[54:16] he rises from there and goes this is
[54:18] straight to Louisiana as he can go to
[54:19] the rice
[54:20] Pates why they've never found a better
[54:23] way for him to get there you can't hurt
[54:25] them together you put him in a cook and
[54:27] a c and Chuck him down there that Duck's
[54:30] got better sense than that you put him
[54:32] in that c to take him down he knows he's
[54:33] headed for the slaughter pin exactly
[54:35] right he goes God's provided way that's
[54:38] way man ought to do today not be HED in
[54:40] with some denominational cook but come
[54:42] in the way God said come in by the
[54:44] baptism of the holy ghost in a new bir
[54:46] swarming Revival not Church joining
[54:48] soliciting from door to door and passing
[54:50] magazines but a birth being born again
[54:53] filled with the Holy Ghost com's way
[54:55] dream himself from the
[54:57] world right believing God's word the
[55:01] hour is here that's what we must believe
[55:04] man you can never I don't care how many
[55:06] man would try to go to that duck pond up
[55:09] there and say now wait a minute you
[55:10] little ducks got something to talk to
[55:11] you we got an educated duck here he's
[55:13] got a PhD and lldd I'm telling you he
[55:15] can lead you them Ducks got better sense
[55:17] than that yes sir they don't care about
[55:20] his better education whatever it is they
[55:22] can tell the certain honk he gives it's
[55:25] an instinct oh my the church ought to
[55:28] know that much about the word of God
[55:30] it's a certain uncertain sound the Bible
[55:33] said Paul said if the trumpet gives an
[55:35] uncertain sound who can prepare himself
[55:37] for battle that's right if the church if
[55:40] the church give an uncertain sound of
[55:41] joining God said birth what the birth
[55:44] did there the birth does the same today
[55:45] because Jesus Christ is the same
[55:47] yesterday today and forever what he was
[55:50] then he is today what they did then is
[55:52] the same thing we do today the way they
[55:54] got it there is the same thing they do
[55:56] today same thing they got today is what
[55:58] they had back there if it comes at all
[56:01] it comes that way that's the way God's
[56:03] provided way it never changes Ducks
[56:06] never change they completely swarm each
[56:07] year go north south and whichever way
[56:09] they go they swarm first that's the way
[56:12] God does he sends his word at season
[56:14] That season then it's manifested and I
[56:17] don't care how many other things have go
[56:18] on when they see the word of God
[56:21] promised for that day being Vindicated
[56:23] and promised there's nothing going to
[56:25] stop them
[56:27] a virgin shall conceive and when they
[56:29] said the Lord Our God shall raise up a
[56:30] prophet liken unto me Moses said and
[56:33] when they seen this man come and do the
[56:34] things he did they know that was a
[56:37] messiah Philip saw that done he said
[56:39] Thou Art the Christ th art the king of
[56:41] Israel he knew it because the word had
[56:43] promised it and it was living in that
[56:45] day no matter how many Pharisees
[56:47] Sadducees were standing around doctors
[56:48] of divinity didn't stop him a bit
[56:50] because he was looking for that sign
[56:52] when he saw it done that was a sign of
[56:54] the hour yes Hallelujah that's that's
[56:56] what they were looking for God's way
[56:58] provided yes sir now you couldn't give a
[57:01] duck education he couldn't do it he
[57:03] wouldn't want it the rest of ducks
[57:04] wouldn't foll him no matter how much
[57:06] degrees he could say he had now look
[57:07] here I went to duck school I know all
[57:09] about it I have graduated I know all
[57:12] these things that wouldn't do a bit of
[57:13] good none of them other Ducks would
[57:14] follow me if they're Janu wine Ducks
[57:17] amen because they're looking for a
[57:19] certain sign they see that sign they
[57:22] believe it if a duck has a way on it how
[57:25] about a barn again Christian we ought to
[57:26] know Jesus Christ in the power of his
[57:30] resurrection right God does it God's
[57:33] provided way remember the education
[57:35] would be the instrument to lead him to
[57:37] God's provided place the instrument they
[57:39] have as Instinct and they D du know that
[57:42] instinct will take them to God's
[57:44] provided place so does the Holy Spirit
[57:46] take the church to God's provided place
[57:49] not to join a church but to be filled
[57:50] with his presence to see his word made
[57:53] manifest Vindicated that's God's
[57:55] provided way for the church always part
[57:57] of the people to bring them to the place
[58:00] that God has provided for them that's
[58:01] exactly what the church should be today
[58:04] now we know that's truth there's no
[58:06] better way for they never found a better
[58:08] way for a baby to get what it wants them
[58:10] to cry for could you give him a bell and
[58:13] say junior you're only three days old
[58:15] but now when you want uh when you want
[58:17] your bottle raise up this Bell and ring
[58:19] it see if it works it don't
[58:21] work the baby cries for what it wants
[58:25] that's God's provided way he louder you
[58:27] cry don't qu the little fell he's the
[58:30] only following God's Prov body way he
[58:31] want something that's right it's the
[58:33] only way he knows to call his mother
[58:34] scream for it cry for it that's right
[58:37] God recommends this for his children God
[58:40] recommends this for his believing
[58:41] children he did not intellectual
[58:44] speeches not some great the theology to
[58:47] teach he wants you to cry for your
[58:50] needs that's right cry part you're too
[58:54] stiff and starchy you'll never get it if
[58:56] you're ready to limber yourself up a
[58:58] little and cry God will give it to you
[59:00] he likes to hear he shouldn't cry cry
[59:02] your needs to God God wants it that's
[59:04] his provided way cry out for that's the
[59:07] way the baby cries that's the way he
[59:09] wants you to cry cry how long how long
[59:12] does a baby cry until he gets satisfied
[59:15] that's the way the believing Christians
[59:16] should do God's child if you see God
[59:18] made the promise don't give it up cry
[59:21] till it's answered cry till you see God
[59:23] vindicates his word god vindicat te his
[59:26] word and proves it sure then you don't
[59:28] have to cry no more you got it walk away
[59:29] thaning for him until tell you do that
[59:31] scream out till you get it I like that
[59:34] persistent holding on not a hybrid plant
[59:37] not one that has to be baby and petted
[59:39] and packed around Christians are real
[59:41] genuine born articles of God they fight
[59:44] for their position and fight till
[59:45] they're finished on this Earth every
[59:47] move of it is a fight God told Moses uh
[59:51] he give him the land he told Joshua
[59:53] every place the foot s of your foot
[59:55] tread
[59:56] that I have given you they had to fight
[59:58] for every inch of it so do we fight for
[1:00:01] every inch of it it isn't something to
[1:00:02] be babed and petted and around like that
[1:00:05] and say well I'll take you over there

[1:00:14] over stay there until God answers and
[1:00:17] vindicates a man that believes a't God

[1:00:22] presence of God sense the presence of
[1:00:24] God and know he's here he's D to answer

[1:00:33] day and night God don't want his
[1:00:35] children listening to intellectual
[1:00:36] speeches he wants them to cry out to it
[1:00:38] till the promise is Vindicated Abraham
[1:00:42] here had a need of a sacrifice what
[1:00:45] happened God provided him a lamb that
[1:00:48] was God's provided way he needed a
[1:00:50] sacrifice so God provided it later on he
[1:00:53] called the place Jehovah gy the Lord
[1:00:56] will provide for himself a sacrifice the
[1:00:59] job one time the old Prophet job he was
[1:01:02] a prophet he had got in trouble Satan
[1:01:05] had desired to tempt him and he broke
[1:01:07] him out in boils and he taken his
[1:01:09] children he taken his stock he taken all
[1:01:11] he had and he broke him out and boils
[1:01:14] and his comforters come what did they do
[1:01:16] they provided nothing but a scorn
[1:01:18] teasing telling him why you sin secretly
[1:01:22] jobus H right on he cried out he was
[1:01:25] sure he was following God's Commandments
[1:01:27] he had done just exactly what God
[1:01:29] promised to do what God promised him
[1:01:32] that he would stand by him under the
[1:01:33] burnt sacrifice and he stayed there so
[1:01:36] God provided him a vision he was a
[1:01:39] prophet what did he see he saw the word
[1:01:42] Jesus Christ he said I know my redeemer
[1:01:45] liveth and at the last days he'll stand
[1:01:47] upon the Earth though the skin worms
[1:01:49] destroys this body yet in my flesh shall
[1:01:51] I see God he provided the resurrection
[1:01:54] vision for him him being a prophet he
[1:01:56] saw the word he saw the word and he know
[1:01:59] that his bones and his body would rise
[1:02:02] again in the last day he must question
[1:02:04] if he know where God was if he could
[1:02:06] only see he said a flower dies it rises
[1:02:09] up again a tree goes down it rises up
[1:02:11] again but a man layeth down he giveth up
[1:02:13] the ghost he wastes away where is he all
[1:02:16] that thou would hide me in the grave and
[1:02:17] keep me in the secret place till thy
[1:02:19] wrath be passed and the Thunders begin
[1:02:21] to Roar the lightning begin to flash the
[1:02:22] spirit of the Lord come upon the prophet
[1:02:24] and he stood up and he saw the coming of
[1:02:26] the Lord and he screamed I know my
[1:02:28] redeemer liveth and at the last days
[1:02:30] he'll stand on the earth though the skin
[1:02:32] worms destroys this body in my flesh I
[1:02:34] shall see God God provided the word
[1:02:37] Jesus Christ and he saw him and called
[1:02:39] him his
[1:02:40] Redeemer Israel needed a way out of
[1:02:43] Egypt and God provided them a prophet a
[1:02:46] prophet that Vindicated the word that
[1:02:48] was promised to Abraham exactly God's
[1:02:51] provided way they couldn't train up a
[1:02:53] soldier they couldn't do this they
[1:02:54] couldn't do that they the only thing
[1:02:56] they did was wait for God's provided
[1:02:58] weight and he told said he would bring
[1:03:00] those people out after 400 years his
[1:03:02] people would be in bondage but he' bring
[1:03:04] him out with a strong hand he'd show his
[1:03:06] signs and wonders and get glory in that
[1:03:08] Nation here come the man down when they
[1:03:10] cried and cried and I remember all the
[1:03:12] crying wouldn't deliver him until that
[1:03:14] time was
[1:03:16] fulfilled these things that we're seeing
[1:03:18] today couldn't happen 20 years ago or 40
[1:03:20] years ago it's today it happens this is
[1:03:23] the hour this is the time yes amen now
[1:03:26] is the time it's fulfilled why God
[1:03:28] promised it and here it is they said 100
[1:03:31] years ago that the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:33] Ghost could not be again they said 50
[1:03:36] years ago the Holy Ghost but you
[1:03:37] Pentecostal people proved them that it
[1:03:39] was God's hour to pour out the Holy
[1:03:41] Ghost no matter what the Methodist
[1:03:43] Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran said you
[1:03:45] stayed right with God's word man of
[1:03:47] Courage went out there and held on to
[1:03:49] the baptism of the Holy Ghost come and
[1:03:51] they spoke in tongues and magnified God
[1:03:53] nobody can tell you any different God's
[1:03:55] is interpreter you got it you might not
[1:03:58] be able to explain it but you know you
[1:04:00] got
[1:04:01] it who can explain God nobody can I
[1:04:04] can't tell you how God can show a vision
[1:04:06] but I know it happens I can't see how
[1:04:08] God can do these things it's not my
[1:04:09] business to explain it he's abides alone
[1:04:12] he's Elohim the self-sufficient one I'm
[1:04:15] just his servant I know he promised it
[1:04:17] and I know a chair that's one thing I
[1:04:19] know I know that that he's the same
[1:04:21] yesterday today and forever I know he
[1:04:23] promises God's here to make it his
[1:04:25] promised true yeah God's provided way
[1:04:28] Israel was provided a prophet had
[1:04:30] Vindicated the word and they were
[1:04:32] brought out this Prophet Moses he lived
[1:04:35] for several years in the wilderness 40

[1:05:51] way he always does it just exact uh
[1:05:54] right yes sir God provides a away
[1:05:57] always yes the wise men when they were
[1:06:00] on their Road from up in Babylon they
[1:06:03] were seeing a way they wanted to go down
[1:06:05] because they knew this King was to be
[1:06:07] born they needed a compass God provided
[1:06:09] a star they left everything else behind
[1:06:12] they didn't need compasses they followed
[1:06:14] the star it was God's provided way God
[1:06:17] provided way they followed the star
[1:06:19] until they found the perfect light oh
[1:06:23] the world needed a savior one day they
[1:06:25] was lost they didn't know it they
[1:06:27] thought they were saved but they needed
[1:06:28] a savior God provided a son for the
[1:06:32] Savior why no one else could do it there
[1:06:35] was no man on Earth no man in heaven
[1:06:37] nowhere was able to do it God
[1:06:40] overshadowed a virgin she conceived and
[1:06:42] brought forth a Manchild and that
[1:06:45] Manchild was not Jewish or Gentile he
[1:06:47] was God manifested In the Flesh the only
[1:06:50] one that could redeem his blood saves us
[1:06:53] his blood heals us it's that blood that
[1:06:55] we can stand on to any promise that he
[1:06:57] made God promised to do it God only
[1:07:00] meets a worshipper through the blood and
[1:07:02] ear the blood Israel had one place to
[1:07:04] meet God not in God's got one place
[1:07:06] today he he meets the worshipper not at
[1:07:09] the Methodist Baptist or Pentecostal he
[1:07:11] meets him under the blood that's the
[1:07:13] only provided Place God has not in an
[1:07:16] organization not in a union but in the
[1:07:19] blood is where Jesus Christ meets his
[1:07:21] worshipper when I see the blood that's
[1:07:23] God's provided we he the church had been
[1:07:26] thoroughly convinced when they seen him
[1:07:28] that he was a messiah when the little
[1:07:30] woman at the well when she needed a
[1:07:31] savior she needed something to show
[1:07:33] she'd been to church and everything else
[1:07:35] and they' seen this Creed and that Creed
[1:07:37] till she turned to be a prostitute it
[1:07:39] turned her on the street one day she was
[1:07:41] going to get a bucket of water about
[1:07:42] 11:00 in the day and there said a man a
[1:07:45] Jew up here at those little panoramic
[1:07:47] and she said uh when she went to drop
[1:07:49] her bucket down on the window to get the
[1:07:51] water she heard a man say woman bring me
[1:07:54] a drink and she said she turn quickly
[1:07:57] and think him just to be an ordinary Jew
[1:07:59] or he was just human as far as the body
[1:08:01] was concerned he was a man eat drink
[1:08:03] slept like we do he was so much human
[1:08:05] till he could die and yet he was God
[1:08:07] then we find out that when said it's not
[1:08:11] customary if few Jews ask Samaritans
[1:08:13] such things as that he said but if you
[1:08:14] knew who you were talking to you'd ask
[1:08:16] me for a
[1:08:18] drink said go get your husband and come
[1:08:20] here she said I have no husband said
[1:08:22] thou has said the truth you've got five
[1:08:24] and the one you're living with now is
[1:08:25] not yours what happened God had provided
[1:08:28] something for her she said sir I
[1:08:31] perceive that you are a prophet we know
[1:08:33] the when the Messiah cometh he'll tell
[1:08:34] us these things that's what he'll do the
[1:08:36] word says so we're looking for it I'm
[1:08:39] sick and tired of all this stuff there
[1:08:41] Creeds and things Pharisees Sadducees
[1:08:43] and rodians whatever it might be but we
[1:08:46] know a messiah's coming when he comes
[1:08:48] what do you say about it he said I am he
[1:08:51] amen God had provided a way she left the
[1:08:54] water pot a changed woman had run into
[1:08:57] the City and said come see a man who
[1:08:59] told me the things I've done isn't this
[1:09:01] the Messiah Peter listened to Andrew's
[1:09:03] story many times had listen to he to
[1:09:06] Andrew talk about John introducing a
[1:09:07] messiah and a man and all these things
[1:09:09] taking place it's all mystery to Peter
[1:09:11] but one day he come with Andrew to see
[1:09:13] Jesus and when he got in the presence of
[1:09:15] Jesus Jesus looked at him and he said
[1:09:17] your name is Simon and you're the son of
[1:09:19] Jonas God had provided the way for Peter
[1:09:22] to see who he was he was that
[1:09:25] Messiah now we find out that after Jesus
[1:09:29] had died and ascended into heaven the
[1:09:32] church needed power to witness God give
[1:09:37] him a Pentecost he provided a Pentecost
[1:09:40] 2,000 years as passed friends 2,000
[1:09:43] years has passed in these latter days we
[1:09:45] have got so man has got into the system
[1:09:48] of Christianity and has perverted again
[1:09:51] hybrid it to Creeds churches
[1:09:54] denominations intellectual speeches
[1:09:57] until the power in the real thing of the
[1:10:00] gospel of Christ is practically lost and
[1:10:03] here we are with word promised for this
[1:10:05] last days what will happen what will
[1:10:07] take place man don't believe it they've
[1:10:09] got away from it you yes if the
[1:10:11] Christians say I belong to so and so
[1:10:12] that doesn't mean one thing you got to
[1:10:15] be a Christian by birth now we got the
[1:10:17] whole thing into a babyon again after
[1:10:19] 2,000 years the church today needs power
[1:10:23] and Truth again oh God raised up his son
[1:10:27] that this would be taken care of for he
[1:10:29] said a little while in the world will
[1:10:31] see me any more yet you'll see me for
[1:10:33] I'll be with you even in you we find out
[1:10:35] in Hebrews 13:8 he's the same yesterday
[1:10:37] today and forever we find out in Malachi
[1:10:40] 4 that he promised us a message in the
[1:10:42] last days that would restore the faith
[1:10:44] of the people back to the fathers again
[1:10:46] he promised it in the last days he also
[1:10:50] promised in John 14:12 he that believeth
[1:10:52] on me the works that I do shall he do
[1:10:54] also even more than this or greater than
[1:10:57] this shall he do for I go to my father
[1:11:00] he's speaking one day they said master
[1:11:01] show us a sign he said a weaken
[1:11:03] adulterous generation seeks after a sign
[1:11:05] that's the generation we're living in
[1:11:07] today he said and I'll give him a sign
[1:11:09] for as Jonas was in the belly the whale
[1:11:11] three days and nights so must the son of
[1:11:14] man be in the heart of the earth three
[1:11:15] days and night what kind of a sign would
[1:11:17] a wicked and adulterous generation find
[1:11:19] out the resurrection sign that's what we
[1:11:23] are promised today the Resurrection sign
[1:11:26] that he's still alive he's the same
[1:11:28] yesterday today and forever he said as
[1:11:31] it was in the days of lot as we went
[1:11:33] through it last night a days of lot what
[1:11:35] happened in the days of lot so would it
[1:11:37] be at the coming of the son of man these
[1:11:39] things were promised many more
[1:11:40] scriptures to keep from taking up time a
[1:11:43] little while and the world won't see me
[1:11:45] no more Cosmos the art the church age
[1:11:47] they won't see me no more yet ye shall
[1:11:49] see me for I'll be with you even in you
[1:11:53] to the end of the age Jesus Jesus Christ
[1:11:55] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:11:57] what is it it's God's provided sign
[1:12:01] God's provided way Abraham waiting for
[1:12:04] the Sun the last sign that he saw before
[1:12:06] the destruction of the Gentiles was God
[1:12:09] manifested in human flesh that know the
[1:12:11] secrets of the heart of Sarah when she
[1:12:12] was in the tent Jesus said that'll
[1:12:15] return again at the coming of the son of
[1:12:16] man brother sister I believe we're
[1:12:19] living in that day I believe this is the
[1:12:22] day of the promise you've got to have
[1:12:24] faith in watch your doing if you haven't
[1:12:26] got faith if you just taking it
[1:12:28] presumbly the word presume according to
[1:12:30] Webster needs to Adventure without
[1:12:32] Authority but when the word promises and
[1:12:35] God stands behind that word you're not
[1:12:37] presuming anymore you're doing exactly
[1:12:40] what God Said do and he's Duty bound to
[1:12:42] back it up Hallelujah great famous
[1:12:45] revivalist many years ago I seen him

[1:15:25] tonight Lord we want to see you too it's
[1:15:28] our heart's desire no one can ever hear
[1:15:30] of you unless they want to see you then

[1:15:35] and you provided a way for us to see you
[1:15:38] you always make a way because you're the
[1:15:40] same yesterday today and forever a
[1:15:42] servant brought these Greeks into your
[1:15:46] presence and they got to see you grant
[1:15:48] us the same privilege tonight father may
[1:15:51] we as servants bring this audience into

[1:16:05] murders and Cutthroats and perverts and
[1:16:08] to see the corruption in the nation
[1:16:10] today and to see the corruption in the
[1:16:13] churches and see them leading to that
[1:16:15] ecumenical Slaughter up there because
[1:16:17] they are not going God's provided way
[1:16:19] they're going by the way of some Creed
[1:16:21] instead of coming by the word God we
[1:16:23] pray that real genuine born Christians
[1:16:26] as are illustrated by being real Ducks
[1:16:29] they my sheep hear my voice a stranger
[1:16:33] they won't follow Lord your voice is the
[1:16:36] word that's always been your provided
[1:16:38] way for the church and for the people is
[1:16:40] your word Thy word is the truth and you
[1:16:43] are the word and the Bible tells us the
[1:16:46] word of God is sharper than a two-edged
[1:16:48] sword a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:16:51] intents of their heart why couldn't
[1:16:53] Israel see their Messiah when they saw
[1:16:55] that he was that word when he could
[1:16:57] discern the thoughts that was in their
[1:16:59] heart how didn't they they understood it
[1:17:02] through the prophets that the prophets
[1:17:03] could but when the fullness of God was
[1:17:05] made into his son and he lived among us
[1:17:09] then they failed to see it because they
[1:17:10] were blinded Lord those who have their
[1:17:13] eyes open tonight may we see Jesus in
[1:17:16] our midst May every sick person be
[1:17:18] healed may this sett it Lord that
[1:17:20] they'll never know more from this hour

[1:17:25] the Messiah they coming God's way many
[1:17:28] of them are here tonight dying there's
[1:17:30] many here tonight that probably won't be
[1:17:33] here a week from today if you your help
[1:17:35] doesn't come father you're only
[1:17:37] responsible for what you promised but

[1:18:22] for me God bless you you that's good
[1:18:25] that's God bless you I'm not
[1:18:28] saved now you that raised your hands and
[1:18:30] you that didn't but brother BR truly I
[1:18:32] want to be saved it's my heart I believe
[1:18:35] that there's nothing left for anyone in
[1:18:36] the world what more what could you
[1:18:38] achieve would be greater than your
[1:18:40] salvation pray for me I want to be saved
[1:18:42] would you raise your hand all over the
[1:18:44] bilding where I want how many of you
[1:18:45] haven't received the Holy Spirit say I
[1:18:47] know I must receive it raise your hand I
[1:18:51] I want to all right it's quite a few
[1:18:53] that has it now
[1:18:57] Christ keeps his word and you got to
[1:18:59] keep your faith in him he is the word
[1:19:02] now Hebrews the fourth chapter said that
[1:19:04] the word of God which is Christ Christ
[1:19:06] is the word you all know that say amen
[1:19:09] he is the word the same yesterday today
[1:19:11] and forever what he was in Moses he also
[1:19:14] was in Elijah what he was in Elijah he
[1:19:16] was in John what he was in John he
[1:19:18] complet himself and and Jesus and today
[1:19:21] he's the same as he was and and still
[1:19:24] God's word word prophesied for the day
[1:19:26] which makes him the light that lights up
[1:19:28] and vindicates the promised word we're
[1:19:30] at the end time friends Jesus is present
[1:19:34] I know you've heard that what if you
[1:19:35] never did see in your life and you never
[1:19:38] had a sense of sight no human being did
[1:19:40] but every once in a while you feel a
[1:19:41] real warm feeling I had a sight I could
[1:19:44] see and I tell it was a sun you say I
[1:19:46] don't know how it happens but I get a
[1:19:48] feeling like warm you can feel I say
[1:19:50] that's a sun what is a sun it's a light
[1:19:52] what is a light it all be a new world
[1:19:55] you but what if I told you Jesus Christ
[1:19:57] was standing here now what if I told you
[1:19:59] he's in the midst of us he promised it
[1:20:01] wherever two or three are gathered in my
[1:20:03] name there I am in their midst there I
[1:20:05] am now that's either the truth to me
[1:20:08] this is all the truth or it isn't any of
[1:20:10] the truth amen this is either the right
[1:20:13] or isn't right now as far as saving you
[1:20:15] he did that when he died at Calvary
[1:20:17] healing you he did that when he died at
[1:20:19] Calvary you believe that the word said
[1:20:22] he did now the only thing that he could
[1:20:24] do if he was standing here with this
[1:20:25] suit on that he gave me would only be
[1:20:28] proved to you he was Messiah not the
[1:20:30] nail scars in his hand any hypocrite can
[1:20:32] do that but nail scars and blood over
[1:20:34] his face and marks and things that can
[1:20:36] be done that's been many person even
[1:20:38] crucified like him that isn't it but his
[1:20:41] life what was in him the son can do
[1:20:43] nothing in himself but what he sees the
[1:20:45] father doing it's a life that in him it
[1:20:47] pro not because he was a Jew did the
[1:20:49] little woman at the well believing to be
[1:20:51] the Messiah because he could discern the
[1:20:54] thoughts in her heart that made him
[1:20:57] Messiah but that was the way the Messiah
[1:20:59] introduced himself in the days gone by
[1:21:01] that was his provided way to make
[1:21:03] himself known that's his provided way
[1:21:05] according to the scripture for this age
[1:21:07] do you believe that now each one of you
[1:21:11] here I'm a stranger I've looked around I
[1:21:12] don't see a person that I know everybody
[1:21:15] in here that doesn't know me and knows I
[1:21:16] know nothing about you raise up your
[1:21:19] hands solid
[1:21:22] everywhere this personally on this cop
[1:21:25] raised up his
[1:21:28] hand he didn't know me nobody knows me
[1:21:32] but remember God does know you God knows
[1:21:35] you now if he proves that he's here what
[1:21:38] is it brother BR it's a gift what is a
[1:21:41] gift what is a gift anyhow not to take
[1:21:43] something and use something say I got a
[1:21:45] gift of healing I go out and heal this
[1:21:47] one heal that one if I could I'd
[1:21:49] certainly do it that's but a gift you
[1:21:52] you you misinterpret a gift a gift is
[1:21:54] just get yourself out of the way and let
[1:21:56] the Holy Spirit use you see that's the
[1:21:58] gift that's what a minister is he Don't
[1:22:01] Preach what he wants to preach he just
[1:22:02] gets himself out of the way it's a gift
[1:22:04] and inspiration comes and he he speaks
[1:22:07] to the inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[1:22:08] and the other gift is the same way and
[1:22:11] ministerial gifts and so forth has been
[1:22:13] there's first of god-given gifts is
[1:22:15] first apostles prophets teachers pastors
[1:22:18] evangelist that's the offices that's our
[1:22:21] gifts now Jesus Christ promised that he
[1:22:24] would do do this in the last days if he
[1:22:26] does it if he promises that and will do
[1:22:29] it how many will believe in accept him
[1:22:31] tonight raise up your hand say I will
[1:22:33] accept him how many in here then thank
[1:22:35] you how many in here has never been in
[1:22:36] one of the meetings before raise up your
[1:22:38] hands mine nearly half the
[1:22:41] crown how many believes before he does
[1:22:44] it you believe anyhow God bless
[1:22:47] you now look if I've told you the truth
[1:22:50] God's obligated to answer me he will he
[1:22:54] puts his words in your mouth and they
[1:22:56] materialize that's thought it's his
[1:22:58] words that has to do it I've sent my
[1:22:59] word it won't return void now if I could
[1:23:02] heal I would do it just like The
[1:23:04] Honorable late brother Upshaw that was
[1:23:06] talking about that old man sitting back
[1:23:08] there in that wheelchair a gallon old
[1:23:10] man I would have healed him if I could I
[1:23:12] started to leave the platform frankly
[1:23:14] and I turned around and saw him in a
[1:23:15] vision going walking called him told him
[1:23:17] what it was and that was it he got up
[1:23:19] and walk come the platform touched these
[1:23:20] toes after being a for 66
[1:23:23] years same night a color lady with her
[1:23:25] baby down on the side I said I see a a
[1:23:28] doctor with glasses on and and is
[1:23:31] operating on a little color girl it's
[1:23:32] paralyzed her from her throat an old
[1:23:34] colored woman he couldn't hardly hold
[1:23:36] her off the platform she said lordy
[1:23:37] Mercy that's my baby and here she come
[1:23:39] bunch of ushers couldn't even hold her I
[1:23:41] said Andy it won't do no good to come up
[1:23:42] here that is that's God I said won't do
[1:23:44] no good to come here just believe and
[1:23:46] she got down on her knees and started
[1:23:48] praying I looked across the audience I
[1:23:50] seen an alley like I seen a little color
[1:23:52] girl with a doll in her arms going down
[1:23:54] down through the alley I looked at the
[1:23:55] little color girl look back and it's the
[1:23:57] same one I said it's answered up she got
[1:24:00] away from the
[1:24:01] cot it's God see it's God see he can't
[1:24:07] no one can heal it's your faith in God
[1:24:10] now the Bible said that he's a high
[1:24:12] priest right now that can be touched by
[1:24:14] the feeling of our infirmities do you
[1:24:16] believe that a high priest now if he's a
[1:24:19] high priest how would he act if he's the
[1:24:21] same yesterday day and forever he'd act
[1:24:24] the same yesterday today and forever now
[1:24:26] you pray and let the Holy Spirit then
[1:24:29] you say to God God this man standing
[1:24:32] there doesn't know me but what he says
[1:24:34] makes sense you are the same you are
[1:24:37] Christ I'm sick I need and if you let me
[1:24:40] either if I haven't got the faith to do
[1:24:43] it let somebody that I know have faith
[1:24:46] and let it you call and let let let me
[1:24:48] or that person Touch the Hem of your
[1:24:50] garment in glory then if that man is out
[1:24:54] of the way then you use his mouth to
[1:24:55] speak back and just do it the same way
[1:24:57] you did when you were on Earth I'll know
[1:25:00] that you're the same yesterday today and
[1:25:01] forever let us spow our heads now Lord
[1:25:04] Jesus turning from evangelism to
[1:25:07] prophetic work but yet I believe you
[1:25:10] Lord you promised it and I pray that you
[1:25:13] will grant it
[1:25:15] tonight granted hear me when this
[1:25:19] audience leaves here tonight and we go
[1:25:20] home may we stay like those who come
[1:25:22] from emus did not our hearts burn within
[1:25:25] us as he talked to us along the way
[1:25:28] Jesus was raised from the dead they
[1:25:30] didn't know what they were talking to
[1:25:31] him they didn't know it but when he got
[1:25:33] them in the house and closed the door
[1:25:36] then he did something the way he did it
[1:25:38] before his crucifixion that opened their
[1:25:40] eyes they seen it was him again Lord May
[1:25:44] our hearts burn as we go home tonight as
[1:25:47] theirs did for we know that you spoke to
[1:25:50] us along the way do the things tonight
[1:25:52] that you did when you were on Earth
[1:25:54] for you are the same yesterday today and

[1:26:30] stand here and speak something in that
[1:26:31] audience to people that I don't know it
