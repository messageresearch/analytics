[3:57] &gt;&gt; [music]
[4:08] &gt;&gt; God bless you all. Let's all stand.
[4:12] Like to welcome you all out to the house
[4:13] of the Lord this evening.
[4:15] Like to ask if uh Uncle John could you
[4:18] come open the service up with a word of
[4:19] prayer.
[4:27] Let's bow our heads. We thank you, Lord,
[4:29] for your goodness, your [music]
[4:30] faithfulness to us, Lord, just another
[4:32] chance to be able to come together with
[4:34] our brothers and sisters and family of
[4:38] God. [music] And Lord, just to lift your
[4:40] holy name this evening. We thank you for
[4:43] this
[4:45] place that we have as a place of refuge
[4:48] that we come to
[4:51] try to tune everything out that may be
[4:53] affecting our thinking, our lives, the
[4:56] [music] cares of this life. And Lord, we
[4:58] know that that's what Satan would love
[5:00] us to continue [music] to dwell on those
[5:02] things. But Lord, we just set this side
[5:05] this time aside tonight, Lord, just to
[5:08] draw closer to you, to Lord, to [music]
[5:11] worship you, to let you know how much we
[5:13] love and appreciate all you're doing for
[5:14] us. Lord, we thank you for this [music]
[5:17] opportunity to be able to just voice our
[5:20] needs
[5:21] to each other. And Lord, you know about
[5:23] whatever we're going through. And but
[5:25] you say we have not because we [music]
[5:26] ask not. And so Lord, we just as we have
[5:28] this prayer meeting tonight, we just ask
[5:31] Lord that you would just [music] have
[5:33] the preeminence. And Lord, we just want
[5:35] to ask that you'd forgive us, Lord, for
[5:37] anything that we may have brought into
[5:40] the building that would just hinder your
[5:41] spirit from moving. And Lord, we just
[5:43] want to draw closer to you. That's our
[5:45] [music] desire tonight. Commit this time
[5:47] into your hands. We ask you in Jesus
[5:49] name. Amen. Before
[5:52] we sing, let's just take a moment to
[5:54] just greet each other and just tell them
[5:56] God bless you.

[28:54] I do that the father may be glorified in
[28:57] the son. If ye shall ask anything in my
[29:01] name, I will do it. Amen.
[29:06] Let us pray. Lord Jesus, thank you for
[29:08] your word tonight. Lord, we come here
[29:11] humbly, Lord. And I just pray that the
[29:14] thought and the the inspiration from my
[29:17] heart
[29:19] &gt;&gt; would be conveyed how you want it to be,
[29:22] Lord. In Jesus name. Amen. God bless
[29:26] you. You can be seated. This little
[29:28] thought came on my mind today upon my
[29:31] heart really
[29:34] um as I was thinking about
[29:38] the great
[29:40] power that comes with unity
[29:43] and joining arms together
[29:47] and um
[29:50] not um misunderstanding one another. And
[29:53] I I was thinking of that word misunder
[29:57] to be misunderstood. Jesus was very
[30:00] misunderstood.
[30:02] And it's probably one of the the one of
[30:05] the I mean it's it's probably a great
[30:09] power of negativity
[30:13] can be released when you're
[30:14] misunderstood.
[30:17] I mean it's
[30:20] um
[30:22] how many's ever been ever been
[30:23] misunderstood
[30:26] and you thought clearly clearly I made
[30:30] myself clear and everybody understood
[30:34] but it happens that we do things we say
[30:36] things and we're 100% misunderstood.
[30:40] Amen.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus is misunderstood.
[30:43] And there's a lot of lives that have
[30:46] been lost over a misunderstanding.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; Friendship severed.
[30:51] Um people will stop talking to one
[30:54] another.
[30:55] Feelings begin to form against others
[30:59] over a misunderstanding.
[31:01] &gt;&gt; Just that a few words could have solved
[31:03] it, cleared it up. But I thought you
[31:08] meant that. And you really meant this
[31:12] and I didn't verify it and I was for
[31:15] sure that's what you meant and that's
[31:18] the way I I understood it and I simply
[31:20] misunderstood you and this happens all
[31:23] the time. You can imagine wars and
[31:26] families and there's um rivalries with
[31:30] gangs and people that form and start and
[31:35] siblings fighting over misunderstanding.
[31:38] church members fighting over. And I
[31:40] started to think, what if all of the
[31:42] let's say there's 15 churches here or so
[31:46] if there were 15 churches and not all
[31:48] the deacons and family members, but all
[31:51] the 15 pastors
[31:53] were to come together in the same place
[31:57] and
[31:59] really find one thing that they could
[32:02] agree upon.
[32:04] And let's say that one thing was that
[32:08] every member in your church needed the
[32:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; What if
[32:17] all of the pastors,
[32:20] 15 of them in just the city alone, got
[32:23] together with just that one. We'll make
[32:26] that our our one focus, our one motive.
[32:31] We won't get into anything else, but
[32:32] every member of our church, of our
[32:36] churches, our families, whatever, needs
[32:39] to be filled with the Holy Ghost.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; Would that be a good thing?
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; I want you to think that through. Would
[32:49] that would that be a positive?
[32:53] &gt;&gt; You know, and you know what's what's
[32:54] what's
[32:56] so true about that? We all know that it
[32:58] would be a positive. It would be a good
[33:00] thing. Most saints that I know, that
[33:03] warms their heart to even think of that
[33:05] happening.
[33:07] But it ain't going to happen.
[33:10] And that's the sad part
[33:14] because
[33:15] something supernatural has to happen
[33:19] &gt;&gt; in order for that to happen. Amen.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; And if I want to achieve that
[33:28] naturally
[33:30] or by calling meetings together or
[33:33] calling this brother and working this
[33:36] out and trying to make that happen um
[33:39] without the move of God, then it's not
[33:42] going to happen.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; How many can agree with that?
[33:45] &gt;&gt; How many know that's a even though we
[33:47] know it should happen and we know the
[33:49] benefit and the blessing that it
[33:51] would bring if it did happen. I would I
[33:53] always think about pigeons and how
[33:56] they're just they outnumber all their
[33:58] predators.
[34:00] But all but if all the pigeons got
[34:02] together
[34:04] [laughter]
[34:05] and really [clears throat] and really
[34:06] thought it through, they can wipe out
[34:09] all their predators
[34:11] because it's more of them than the
[34:13] predators.
[34:15] And and they would they would get the
[34:17] job done, but they're not going to do
[34:18] that.
[34:19] Why? because they're pigeons
[34:22] and they have a pigeon brain
[34:26] &gt;&gt; and they'll fight with each other while
[34:28] they're both running from the same
[34:30] enemy.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Yes. I used to raise a few pigeons and
[34:35] I've seen them operate and behave and
[34:38] they operate a lot like some people.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Yes. on on and and you think there this
[34:45] one enemy is chasing an entire herd of
[34:49] pigeons, chasing them through the whole
[34:52] neighborhood. If these birds would just
[34:54] stop and say, "Hey guys, one of us might
[34:57] die, but we we can get we we can defeat
[35:01] our enemy once and for all,
[35:04] &gt;&gt; but it's not going to happen."
[35:05] And so I I in thinking about that, as
[35:09] much as I would desire that, as much as
[35:11] I would love for five pastors, 10
[35:14] pastors or all the pastors to get
[35:16] together and to do that, um I realized,
[35:21] and this is what came into my heart as I
[35:24] was praying today, is that we need a
[35:27] sovereign move of God.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; When I say we, I'm talking about every
[35:31] single individual.
[35:33] And if I could if I could give something
[35:37] to each member of this church, if I
[35:39] could do it, something physical,
[35:42] financial, or spiritual,
[35:45] one supernatural thing, it it would be
[35:48] it would be just that that God would
[35:50] give you a sovereign move of God, a an
[35:55] outpouring for you, the individual.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:01] That is really what this church needs.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; That is what your pastor needs.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; That is what your deacons need.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; That is what every young person needs.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; This is what the individuals in this
[36:19] church needs. So move aside the 15
[36:23] pastors in the city. Let's What about 15
[36:26] people in this one church? Amen.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen with 15 people
[36:33] even in this church
[36:37] without a sovereign move of God.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; Now, it's possible and the the the
[36:43] supreme power that lays within us, I
[36:46] think we downplay it so many times, but
[36:49] I want to read a few places that will
[36:51] help build that so we'll know where we
[36:54] stand. Now the prophet of God takes this
[36:58] message and trying to do God a service
[37:00] without it being his will and he says
[37:02] this in paragraph 117
[37:08] and as we try I as I was discussing with
[37:11] a group of my fine brothers Baptist
[37:14] brethren not long ago and they said
[37:16] brother Brandham we can only have a
[37:18] revival when we take the word word by
[37:21] word page by page letter by letter. And
[37:26] I said, I believe too, page by page. He
[37:29] said, I said, they've been trying to do
[37:32] that all along. He said, but we must
[37:34] find the Greek interpretation of the
[37:36] word, what the Greek says. And I said, I
[37:39] haven't read too much, but reading the
[37:40] history of the church and the Nasian
[37:43] council, Free Nas council, Nyian
[37:45] fathers, so forth. They were arguing
[37:48] back there about the Greek. That's 2,000
[37:52] years ago. One said it means this. One
[37:55] says it means that. The Greek word means
[37:58] this. Just like our language, the word
[38:01] see, use the word sea. You could mean a
[38:04] body of water. I understand. Or many
[38:08] things. Bored could be board a hole,
[38:11] make a walk, or you bored me, or you pay
[38:14] my board, or it could mean many things.
[38:18] And those little vows and so forth just
[38:21] change the whole meaning. So you'll
[38:23] never do it like that. God wrote it like
[38:26] that
[38:27] because in all of the word is inspired.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; All of the word is inspired. And he said
[38:35] that I thank thee father that thou has
[38:38] hid these things from the eyes of the
[38:40] wise and prudent and will reveal a man
[38:43] to babes such as we'll learn. It's a
[38:46] revelation of him. As I said last
[38:50] evening, we'll reveal it to babes.
[38:54] I said it won't work, sir. I said a
[38:57] revival will never come until God, the
[39:01] sovereign God, sends it. Then he might
[39:04] take up a little nitwit that can't even
[39:06] sign his name and do it with it that
[39:09] knows not even good English, let alone
[39:12] the Greek. That's what he done in the
[39:15] time with Peter preached at Pentecost.
[39:17] You know, he couldn't even sign his
[39:19] name. Ignorant and unlearned. But God
[39:22] does those things in such a strange way
[39:26] to our intellectual thinking that makes
[39:29] it God.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; If he's got a bunch of theologians and
[39:33] dignitaries and so forth, they'd said
[39:36] that smart kais. He says, you see, he
[39:40] had it just right. But God went down,
[39:42] got a fisherman that couldn't even sign
[39:45] their name. That's what he took. That's
[39:48] God. He takes something that's nothing
[39:50] and makes something out of it to his
[39:52] honor.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; He takes chaos and made Eden.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. It's God. Now, if there's anybody
[40:01] got the mechanics for a revival, it's
[40:03] our noble brother Billy Graham. But the
[40:06] mechanics is all right. But the
[40:08] mechanics won't work move it. It takes
[40:11] the dynamics to move it. You can build
[40:14] an automobile, put fine seats in it,
[40:17] make fine pistons, and prove by science
[40:21] what it can do, but unless the dynamics
[40:24] is there, she's just as just a dead
[40:27] piece of goods.
[40:30] Amen.
[40:32] So, the prophet said it. Amen.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; It takes God to do it. It takes a
[40:38] sovereign move of God. Now, I desire to
[40:42] see the power of the Holy Ghost upon
[40:46] every single believer.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Every one of you. I would desire to see
[40:52] that more than anything,
[40:54] &gt;&gt; more than you. Some of you that need to
[40:57] get married or are looking to finish
[41:01] your career or trying to find out what
[41:03] you are in your ministry. I would love
[41:05] to see that more than any other personal
[41:08] problem you have or trauma of your past
[41:11] and or any other little dynamic you're
[41:14] trying to work out.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; I would love to see and I'm talking
[41:18] about for my own life is to have the
[41:20] power of the most high God
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. flowing in my vessel, filling me,
[41:29] &gt;&gt; filling me to the fullness
[41:33] &gt;&gt; 100% completely in his control.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; I long for that.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; I cry for that. I don't like I I I don't
[41:42] I don't want a a a cold dead religion.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; I don't want a prayer that doesn't move.
[41:49] Right.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; I I don't want to go to before people
[41:52] that are sick and they remain sick.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Someone has cancer, we want that to
[41:58] move. Someone has depression or
[42:00] oppression or troubles, we want the Lord
[42:03] to heal that and deal with that.
[42:06] How many of you every time you hear the
[42:09] tapes and that that prayer line and that
[42:12] move of God from the ministry of Malachi
[42:15] 4, how many of you long to have that in
[42:18] your life? I believe the true believer
[42:21] is not so much interested in a bigger
[42:25] church or nicer pews or whatever. Uh I
[42:30] want I want Jesus.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; I want the Lord Jesus Christ in his
[42:34] fullness. I'm talking about the Jesus
[42:37] that appeared to us in the fullness of
[42:40] his word in this hour.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; That's what I desire.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; And it's not going to happen until the
[42:49] sovereign God sends it.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; I want God to really do a tremendous
[42:56] work in the lives of our young people.
[43:00] Amen.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:02] I'd love to see the altar filled every
[43:04] service.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; I'd love to for the shakina to grow come
[43:08] down where I can't even speak.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; I'd love to be slain in the spirit.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you?
[43:14] &gt;&gt; I'd love to have total my total
[43:18] faculties lost in him.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; I would love that. I'm not afraid of
[43:25] that. I sure hope I'm not.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you love that? Yes, sir.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; But I'm not going to make it happen and
[43:32] I can't make it happen.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; So, it takes a sovereign God to do it.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet of God really lays a
[43:44] high standard for us believers.
[43:48] And he does it in this message, the
[43:50] power uh that day at Calvary.
[43:53] And and I'll read a portion of that. The
[43:57] same the same Jesus tonight, 1955.
[44:01] And the prophet of God says this, and
[44:02] we'll play a portion of this for you
[44:05] just before we go to prayer.
[44:08] I'm I'm just about done. I'm just going
[44:10] to read a couple quotes. That was what
[44:13] was on my heart to to to share with you.
[44:17] A sovereign move of God. Amen.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Um
[44:24] that word sovereign means it's a
[44:26] supreme.
[44:28] It means independent.
[44:30] It means um it's subject to its own laws
[44:35] only. He's the sovereign God. He doesn't
[44:39] have to ask for anyone's permission. And
[44:42] when he decides to do it, there's nobody
[44:45] that can say no. That's the God. That's
[44:48] the move I'm talking about. And when God
[44:51] decides to bless you, there's nobody can
[44:54] stop that.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; When God decides to anoint you, there's
[44:58] nobody that can stop that.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; When God decides to send his Holy Spirit
[45:05] amongst a group of people, there is
[45:07] nobody, no man, no devil that can stop
[45:10] it. And that's the move that I want.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; And that's not only the move that I
[45:16] want. That's actually the move that we
[45:18] need.
[45:20] Every one of us need that.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Without that, it was just intellectual.
[45:24] We're just arguing. We just our points.
[45:26] And without a supernatural
[45:29] &gt;&gt; God coming down, making it real to you,
[45:34] &gt;&gt; it's just dad telling us his dad ways
[45:38] &gt;&gt; and and mom and dad is just, you know,
[45:40] church again.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We heard those quotes. Yeah.
[45:43] That's all it is. But when there's a,
[45:46] you know, when it's a real fire, it's
[45:48] different than a painted fire.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; When it's a when that when that picture
[45:52] of the pillar of fire, thank God for it.
[45:54] But when that when that pillar that
[45:56] picture of the pillar of fire actually
[45:58] comes off the picture and comes down and
[46:01] drops in somebody's life,
[46:03] &gt;&gt; can't nobody stop it.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Can't nobody stop it.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; That's the move [applause]
[46:10] that this church needs. Amen.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; That's what you need. That's what I
[46:15] need. And without it,
[46:18] &gt;&gt; just just like any other group,
[46:22] &gt;&gt; any other group.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God says this here,
[46:30] paragraph 128 in that day at Calvary.
[46:34] Little while the world won't see me no
[46:36] more, yet you'll see me. I'll be with
[46:38] you, even in you to the end of the
[46:40] world. I'll not leave you comfortless.
[46:42] I'll pray the father. He'll send you
[46:45] another comforter which is the Holy
[46:47] Ghost whom the world cannot receive. Yet
[46:50] you can receive him. Now notice the
[46:53] greater works was to have the power in
[46:56] the church. Not only to heal the sick by
[46:59] prayer, cast out devils by prayer, but
[47:03] to impart eternal life to believers. The
[47:07] Holy Ghost was coming and given into the
[47:10] hands of the church to impart life.
[47:14] Oh, that's what Calvary meant. It took
[47:17] stooped, degraded men and women, lifted
[47:20] them into a place to be sons and
[47:22] daughters of God.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; To heal the sick, to impart eternal life
[47:27] by the giving of the Holy Ghost to
[47:29] obedient believers.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Men who were once unbelievers be
[47:35] made believers
[47:36] &gt;&gt; and impart spiritual eternal life.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 131. Poor blind wretched
[47:44] people. How do they miss that? Don't see
[47:47] what the great Don't you see what the
[47:49] greater thing is? That's the greatest
[47:52] thing that could ever happen was to
[47:54] impart eternal life to people. What is
[47:58] eternal life? the life that he lived,
[48:01] the life that was in him, impart that to
[48:05] others. Can a man do that? A son of God
[48:08] can.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Whosoever sins you remit,
[48:15] to them they are remitted. Whosoever
[48:18] sins you retain, to them they are
[48:20] retained."
[48:22] Oh my. That really sets the bar pretty
[48:25] high to me.
[48:27] what the son of god can do. Now I want
[48:31] to play that part here but let me read
[48:33] this in the same Jesus tonight 1955.
[48:37] Brother Brandham says this in paragraph
[48:40] number three
[48:42] he says now something's got to happen.
[48:45] It's just like cogs moving together.
[48:47] When the right time comes every cog will
[48:50] take its place. There's a woman with a
[48:52] desire in her heart, with faith in who
[48:55] he was, standing by the fountain of
[48:58] life, recognizing no matter what the
[49:01] past was in his presence again.
[49:04] Hallelujah. There she is. Whatever you
[49:07] ask God, God will give it thee.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; That turned his great heart.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; He looked at her.
[49:14] Rise again. She said, "Yeah, Lord, I
[49:17] know he was a good boy. He'll rise again
[49:19] in the general resurrection. Those Jews
[49:22] believed in the resurrection. He'll rise
[49:24] someday in the last days in the
[49:26] resurrection. Listen to the only man
[49:28] that ever lived. Listen, the only man
[49:31] that ever lived that could make this
[49:32] statement. The Bible said he wasn't much
[49:35] to look at. Probably a little frail
[49:38] looking person. I can see him straighten
[49:41] his little frame up and make this
[49:42] statement. I am the resurrection and
[49:45] life. Never a man could say that. nor
[49:48] afterwards will there ever be. I am the
[49:51] resurrection and life. He that believeth
[49:54] on me, though he were dead, yet shall he
[49:57] live. And whosoever liveth and believeth
[49:59] in me shall never die. Oh, how that
[50:02] thrills my heart to know what with with
[50:04] certainty that now we have everlasting
[50:07] life.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Names written in the lamb's book of
[50:10] heaven.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; There's a grave laying yonder, the body
[50:14] in its all molded. The first thing falls
[50:18] in on the body is the nose. Skin worms
[50:21] is going in and out. Brokenhearted
[50:24] sister. But Marthur standing by the
[50:27] fountain of life had
[50:31] um fountain of life had hear that word.
[50:35] Oh, I love it. Let me tell you, she must
[50:39] believe for the impossible. Then that's
[50:43] what you've got to do. You've got to
[50:45] believe the impossible in order to have
[50:49] new life.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Let me also say this at God as God's
[50:52] servant because I know from what I speak
[50:55] the impossibles
[50:57] are made real when God has took at his
[51:01] word.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; When any person will take the same word,
[51:05] it'll bring the same results every time,
[51:09] &gt;&gt; every time you ask it.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Thank God for his word. Tonight I want
[51:17] to play this portion of the tape. I
[51:20] think it's 5 minutes or three or so from
[51:22] paragraph 126 to 140 and that day at
[51:27] Calvary.
[51:29] I know it would be a blessing to you.
[51:32] They prepare to get that for me.
[51:35] And
[51:38] Amen.
[51:43] Jesus thanked the father hid it from the
[51:45] educated and shrewd and wise and prudent
[51:47] and would reveal it to babes such as
[51:49] would come to Calvary.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Now watch Jesus said, WATCH HOW HE
[51:57] STATED IT. THE WORKS THAT I DO, he's
[52:01] doing them right now.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; The works that I'm DOING NOW, HEALING
[52:04] THE SICK, raising the dead, OPENING THE
[52:07] EYES OF THE BLIND, THESE WORKS SHALL YOU
[52:10] DO ALSO. YES,
[52:12] &gt;&gt; you will do these. If you believe in me,
[52:15] you do these works, AND THAT ARE GREATER
[52:17] THAN THIS SHALL YOU DO.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; FOR I GO TO MY father
[52:22] a little while, and the world won't see
[52:24] me no more. Yet you'll see me.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; I'll be with you, even in you,
[52:30] &gt;&gt; to the end of the world.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; I will not leave you comfortless. I'll
[52:34] pray the Father. HE'LL SEND YOU ANOTHER
[52:36] COMFORTER which is the Holy Ghost
[52:40] WHOM THE WORLD CANNOT RECEIVE. YET YOU
[52:42] CAN RECEIVE HIM.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; NOW NOTICE THE GREATER works
[52:48] was TO HAVE THE [screaming] POWER IN THE
[52:51] CHURCH NOT ONLY TO HEAL THE SICK BY
[52:54] PRAYER,
[52:55] CAST OUT DEVILS [screaming] BY PRAYER,
[52:58] BUT TO IMPART ETERNAL LIFE TO BELIEVERS.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST WAS COMING.
[53:05] and give it into the hands of the church
[53:08] &gt;&gt; to impart life.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Praise his name.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT CALVARY MEANT.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; YES.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; THAT TOUCHED STOOP, DEGRADED MEN AND
[53:21] WOMEN,
[53:22] AND LIFTED THEM INTO A PLACE TO BE SONS
[53:25] AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD,
[53:26] &gt;&gt; TO HEAL THE SICK.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; OH, YEAH. AND TO IMPART ETERNAL life
[53:33] &gt;&gt; like giving the Holy Ghost
[53:37] &gt;&gt; to obedient believers. Men who were once
[53:40] unbelievers be made believers and IMPART
[53:42] SPIRITUAL ETERNAL LIFE. HOW MUCH greater
[53:44] is it to say this sick woman here I can
[53:46] pray a prayer of faith and she'll be
[53:48] healed. That's a great thing. That's
[53:50] what HE WAS DOING THEN SAID GREATER THAN
[53:52] THIS SHALL YOU DO. AMEN.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give YOU POWER
[53:57] &gt;&gt; not only to raise HIM UP FOR A WHILE,
[53:59] BUT TO GIVE HIM ETERNAL LIFE,
[54:02] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'LL BE ETERNAL FOREVER.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; POOR, BLIND, wretched people.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; How do you miss that?
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Don't you see what the greater thing is?
[54:15] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE GREATEST THING THAT EVER
[54:16] HAPPENED.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; WAS TO IMPART ETERNAL LIFE TO PEOPLE.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; What is the eternal life? the life that
[54:23] he lived, the life that was in him.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Impart that to others.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Can a man do that? A son of God can.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Whosoever sins you remit to
[54:35] them, they are remitted."
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Whosoever sin you retain to them, they
[54:40] are retained.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Now, here's where the Catholic Church
[54:44] and many others made their big mistake.
[54:46] They go out and say, "I'll forgive your
[54:47] sins." That wasn't it.
[54:49] How did they get sins forgiven in the
[54:51] Bible? Peter answered that question on
[54:55] the day of Pentecost.
[54:57] THEY SAID, "WHAT CAN WE DO TO BE SAVED?
[55:01] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN WE GET THIS THAT YOU ALL GOT?"
[55:04] &gt;&gt; He laid down the prescription.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; HE TOLD HIM WHAT TO DO.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "REPENT EVERY ONE OF YOU
[55:11] TOWARDS GOD AND BE BAPTIZED IN THE NAME
[55:13] OF JESUS CHRIST."
[55:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; FOR THE REMISSION OF YOUR SINS.
[55:18] HALLELUJAH.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A GREATER WORKS.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY OF YOU PREACHERS THIS MORNING?
[55:24] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY OF YOU LISTEN TO MY WORD ON
[55:25] MAGNETIC TAPE ARE WILLING TO GO TO
[55:28] CALVARY THIS MORNING?
[55:29] &gt;&gt; LOOK WHAT GOD DID THERE FOR YOU.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JESUS.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; AND FORSAKE YOUR DENOMINATIONAL CREED
[55:37] AND PREACH THE GOSPEL.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Thank you, Jesus.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; IT'S IN YOUR LAP NOW. WHAT ARE YOU GOING
[55:45] TO DO WITH IT?
[55:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THANK YOU, LORD. FOR
[55:48] REPENTANCE AND REMISSION OF SINS MUST BE
[55:51] PREACHED IN HIS NAME TO ALL THE WORLD,
[55:54] BEGINNING AT JERUSALEM. HALLELUJAH.
[56:00] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; What does CALVARY MEAN TO YOU? WHAT THAT
[56:05] DAY DO TO YOU?
[56:06] &gt;&gt; DO STUFF YOU OUT WITH SOME THEOLOGY?
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Did it MAKE YOU A STUFFED SHIRT?
[56:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; OR DID IT MAKE YOU A CHRISTIAN SOLD OUT?
[56:16] HALLELUJAH.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Greater works than this shall ye do.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; You see who the ye are, don't you?
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Greater works than this.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Remitting sins
[56:32] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ, but through
[56:35] creeds and denominations and SO FORTH,
[56:38] IT'S BOUND YOU DOWN TO A PLACE YOU'RE
[56:40] STILL SERVING THE WORLD.
[56:43] YES.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Tell me any man. TELL ME ANY WOMAN CAN
[56:47] COME TO CALVARY AND TRY TO BE A BIG
[56:49] SOMEBODY BECAUSE SOMEBODY said
[56:51] something.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; TELL ME WHERE YOU CAN LOOK IN THE FACE
[56:54] OF CALVARY IN ITS RIGHT LIFE THAT DAY IN
[56:56] CALVARY. HOW CAN YOU HAVE YOUR DAY ON
[56:58] CALVARY COME OUT OF STUFF SHIRT?
[57:00] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU COME OUT A PUPPET FOR SOME
[57:02] ORGANIZATION AND PREACH SOME MAN-MADE
[57:04] DOCTRINES?
[57:06] &gt;&gt; GOD,
[57:06] &gt;&gt; WHY DON'T IT HUMBLE YOU TO THE WORD OF
[57:08] GOD?
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. If you ever go there,
[57:12] you'll come out humble.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, you will.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; How can you want to be some big
[57:15] SOMETHING IN YOUR ORGANIZATION WITH A
[57:17] FEATHER IN YOUR HAT WHEN JESUS CHRIST,
[57:19] THE SON OF GOD, HUMBLED HIMSELF TO A
[57:21] HACKED UP BODY, TO A SPITTED FACE
[57:24] &gt;&gt; UNTIL SHAME AND DISGRACE AND THEY
[57:27] STRIPPED HIS CLOTHES OFF AND CRUCIFIED
[57:28] HIM before the world,
[57:30] &gt;&gt; despising the shame?
[57:34] &gt;&gt; How can you go to Calvary and come away
[57:35] anything different than what he was?
[57:38] A disgrace,
[57:40] a shame. [clears throat]
[57:42] Or you say to kick me out, let them
[57:44] kick.
[58:03] Praise the Lord. We thank God for his
[58:05] word tonight.
[58:08] Amen.
[58:09] So, that was just a few things I had up
[58:12] on my heart and I really was impressed
[58:16] to
[58:19] to bring that before you that if there
[58:23] was any prayer, any desire that you had,
[58:27] um I think it should be that for God to
[58:30] have a sovereign move, a sovereign work
[58:32] in your life. what Calvary did for you
[58:36] that day at Calvary will produce the
[58:39] same works that Jesus did. And he said
[58:41] greater works than these. Greater. Amen.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; And that's my desire. I bless you
[58:47] saints.
[58:49] Um
[58:52] we have a few prayer requests that we
[58:53] want to go to. Brother,
[58:56] let's see. Remember brother Kim
[58:59] Dingwall's mother-in-law for a health
[59:02] need. They're there in Manitoba. I
[59:05] believe they're have to travel there.
[59:07] Pray for healing and comfort for brother

[1:00:04] So that's you want more of those in life
[1:00:07] than the opposite. Amen.

[1:00:11] remembering that. Was there someone else
