[Music] I've had many tears and sorrows. I've had questions for you. There have been times I knew right from wrong. [Music] But in every situation, God gave blessed consolation that my trials only come to make me strong. It's been through it all. Through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God through it all. Lord, through it all, I've learned to depend upon his word. [Music] I've been a lot of places. I've seen a lot of faces. There have been times I felt so all alone. [Music] But in my lonely hours, those precious lonely hours, Jesus let me know I was his own. And it's been through it all. All through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I have learned to trust in God. Oh, through it all. Oh, through it all, I've learned to depend upon his word. Now I thank God for the mountains. I thank him for the valleyies. I thank him for the storms he's brought me through. For if I never had a problem, I wouldn't know that he could solve them. I never know what faith in God could do. So, it's been through it all. Oh, through it all. I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Through it all, Lord, through it all, I've learned to depend upon his word. Amen. Sister Sharon, I'm going to pull on you tonight to sing a special. We'll continue to sing that chorus as she gets ready. And brothers, if you'll help. It's been through it all.

Won't you come now and sing? [Music] Come now when you see. [Music] [Applause] Amen. Let's all stand this evening. We'll have our brothers come and take uh the prayer request before the Lord. worth. [Music] Let's bow our heads together. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're coming before you once again, Lord. Ask you for your blessing on this offering, Lord. May it be used for your purposes, Lord, to advance the kingdom of God. We're thankful, Father, that you've given us a strength and a right mind and the health, Father, to be here this evening. We pray, Lord, that we could use that energy, Lord, to worship you in spirit and in truth. Father, just be with everyone, Lord. Those that may be traveling, those that are not here, Father.

Amen. [Music] Amen. We'll go to the key of A. [Music] So many times I've questioned certain circumstances, things I could not understand. Many times my trials and weakness blur my vision and my frustration gets so out of hand. Always then I am reminded I've never been forsaken. I've never had to stand one test alone. As I look at all the victories, the spirit rises up in me. Through the fire, my weakness is made strong. He never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to climb. [Music] He never offered victories without fighting, but he said help would always come in time. Just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says give in. Just hold on. Our Lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again. He never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to climb. He never offered us victories without fighting. He said, "Help would always come in time." Just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says, "Just hold on. Our Lord will show up. He will take you through the fire again. Just remember, just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision. And the adversary says, "Give in. Just hold on. Our Lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again. Amen. Let's give our Lord a hand of praise this evening. Amen. You may be seated. Oh Lord, I've never been this homesick before. [Music] Here's a light in the window. The table spread in splendor. Someone standing by an open door. I can see a crystal river. Oh, I must be near forever. I've never been this home sick before. See the bright light shine. It's just about home time. I can see a father standing at the door. This world's been a wilderness. I pray for deliverance. Lord, I've never been this home sick before. I can't see my family gather sweet faces all familiar. There's no one or feeble anymore. This old lonesome heart is crying. Think I'll spread my wings for flying. I've never been this home sick before. When I see the bright light shine, it's just about home time. I can see my father's standing at the door. This world's been a wilderness. I'm ready for deliverance. Lord, I've never been this home sick before. I see the bright light shine. is just about home time. I can't see my father standing at the door.

Visions of rapture now burst on my side. Angels to standing free from above mercy. [Music] We'll take that last verse. In perfect salition, all is at rest. I am my savior. Am happy and blessed, watching and waiting, looking above. I'm here with his goodness. Oh, this is my story. This is my song. Praising my savior all the day long. This is my story. This is my song. Praising myior. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all raise our hands to him as we sing that chorus one last time. Oh, this is my story. [Music] This is my song. Praising my savior all the day long. This is my story. This is my song. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praising myior [Music] all the day long. Amen. Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, we ask your blessings upon this portion of the service, Lord, as we minister your word. May every heart receive from you is my prayer. Father, we commit our very lives into your hand. Lord, you know exactly what each of us have need of. You know what this church has need of. And Father, we pray that you'll meet those needs. Lord, we're so happy to be in the house of the Lord. Once again, we thank you that Lord, you've given us another opportunity to praise your holy name. Oh God, to stand as a witness in the dark and evil day. Lord, we appreciate that we can raise our hands and tell you thank you. Thank you, Jesus. One more time. Oh God, your grace and mercy has brought us this far. And Lord, we just need more of your grace, more of your mercy. Lord, let it shower upon us. Let it take away all of the evils of our life, of our thoughts, of our past. Let us move forward to the brighter day, Lord, of being matured and coming up stronger, better, more equipped, anointed, ready for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Oh God, that's our desire. That's our prayer, Lord, that you'll move us closer to that. It's in Jesus mighty name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you saints. So good to be in the house of the Lord with you. Can you say praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; Well, we're so happy to have each of you and happy to be here with you. I took a very quick uh trip, long but quick trip to Montreal. There was a a youth conference for just youth that were over 28, 28 and above. I'd never been a part of anything like that. They had a roundt discussion and all kind of things like that. And I was very very apprehensive about going and um wife Sharon was going to come. She backed out at the last minute. But um uh I ended up going, but I made it back in time to be in the house of the Lord with the saints in Mesa on Sunday. So, it worked out. I worked it that way. So, I'm here with you uh tonight and uh that was very nice there in Montreal. I spoke one time and um I learned a lot. I always take notes in these kind of events and so something new. I've never seen a venue like that before, but it was interesting to say the least. So, I appreciate brother Joe for holding the fort down for us always. And um that's it. I can just say brother Joe cuz there was two brother Joe's brother Galante and brother Joseph Robson. Thank you so much. And did you enjoy that tape this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm sure you did. Good to see you, brother Jonathan. Bless you and each of you. Amen. So, let's go right to the word. There's a scripture I like to take in Zechariah chapter 13 and the sisters in the back are going to help me out and I think they are going to do a good job. Amen. just the the the some of our regulars are not there, but um but I'm sure they'll do just fine. Amen. In Zechariah chapter 13, if you'll stand with me for the reading of the word, verses number 6 and 7, if you have a Skullfield Bible, it's page 978. Amen. Does that help sometime? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay, I'll do it more if I remember. 978, book of Zechariah, chapter 13, verse number six. And one shall say unto him, what are these wounds in thy hands? Then he shall answer, those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends. Awake, oh sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, sayaeth the Lord of hosts. Smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered, and I will turn my hand upon the little ones. Amen. Jesus quoted this scripture in Matthew 26 and also in Mark chapter 14 verse 27. And he, not that he failed, but he uh did not mention, I will turn my hand upon the little ones. He's going to his crucifixion, and he tells his disciples, all of you will be offended at me tonight. All of you. Smite the shepherd and the sheep will scatter. He's quoting the scripture in Zechariah. The prophet of God takes this scripture and goes a little bit further into these little ones. And that's the title of the message tonight, the little ones. God bless you. You may be seated. This is related to the message we brought on a coming church also and the removing of a candlestick that that if you fail to repent that was the um that was the uh not condemnation but that was the judgment. If you fail to repent I will remove the candlestick. Revelations chapter 2, he says, "Remember from where you have fallen, repent or else I will remove the candlestick." Now, Brother Madam tells us in the church age's book in a couple different places where that that uh that candlestick was the leader, the messenger for the age. He also he also types it as your pastor a shepherd to the church that if a church fails to receive the word of that pastor or try to control him then God will move that pastor to a place where he would be received. Okay, that's those quotes I read for you last Sunday. How many remember some of those? Some of some of them are I have all of them here but not just to save a little time. But then he goes even further. And as I take this this thought on the little ones, it is in Matthew 25:32 where the Lord Jesus is talking about the sheep and the goats and how he's going to separate them. And and then he goes and talks about how you were in prison, you came to see me. How you fed me when I was hungry. How I was thirsty, you gave me drink. And he says, "In so much," he says, 'Lord, when do we do these things to you? He says, "In so much you have done it unto the least of these, you have done it unto me." &gt;&gt; And brother Madam takes this scripture in several places and uses it and applies it to the believer. So I know we've heard many times where, "Touch not my anointed, do my prophets no harm." Correct? And I believe that I believe that speaking and and attacking a a pastor or leaders or even your parents or whatever that there's a great danger in that and we should have respects. &gt;&gt; Amen. Also that applies to believers also. If you offend a believer, Jesus said, uh, be better that a millstone be hanged about your neck than to offend one of the least of these. And he's not just talking about the little children that came up that he dedicated. He was talking about those um that were in prison, those that were hungry, those that needed want. It's it's a group of people that are if you look at the the different examples, they're the least fortunate. They're poor. They're needy. They're Jesus in the office of these people. And if you offend them, it'd be better that a millstone be hanged about your neck. Isn't that something? Think about that. And so he, Brother Brandham, says it in a couple different places, and I'll just go right through it. and in um it gives the example and the message fellowship 1960. So before I do that, let me let me deal with the scripture there in Zechariah chapter 13 and let's see what the prophet of God says about this scripture. All right, it's in the message six-fold purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel, paragraph number 92. Now, Jesus quoted that scripture. See, smite the shepherd and scattered the sheep. But notice the next paragraph. He just quoted that much of it. But watch what the next sentence, it says, the next part of it. And I will turn my hand to the little ones. What the Benjamin group that's coming up now? I will turn my hand to the little ones. Smite the shepherd Israel first. Israel smote the shepherd, scattered the sheep to all the world. But God said, I will turn my hand back to get them little ones at the last day. when when reconciliation for iniquity has been made. Amen. So the Benjamin group, who's the Benjamin group? That's Joseph's little brother. Remember him? Remember Joseph? Remember the testimony of the brothers hating him without a cause. And then finally, the Lord raises him up to great power and great position. And now he's asking about his little brother Benjamin. Brother Vanam tells us that this Benjamin is 144,000. &gt;&gt; G he brings that type and shows us. And he said that's this little Benjamin group that's growing up now. Where when are they coming up? Tomorrow. Are they in existence now? You better believe it. &gt;&gt; The Benjamin group is in existence and they're over over there in the homeland and everybody's going to start hating on them. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. The world will turn against Israel. But this little group, this little Benjamin group that's rising up now, it's an interesting thought to think that that is actually taking place supernaturally while the churches are fussing and fighting over whatever they're fighting over. &gt;&gt; And we should be maturing under the word of the hour. &gt;&gt; Benjamin is growing. &gt;&gt; And God has a word for Benjamin. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "I will not forget Israel. I will not forget Benjamin." Okay, so we know we can see that scripture. Now this uh brother Brandham is taking talking about the least ones and he makes this comparison with the least one and he says this in fellowship 1960. He says, "Now notice this now how he comes. They come into the kitchen. What? To eat. You eat in the kitchen. That's your first. Next, you go into the room to talk things over. Recognition, making all your confession. But then when you go to the bedroom is when you're married, life is completed. It's ready. Then life is for the little ones and so forth. That's what the church is when it comes through justification, sanctification into the baptism of the Holy Ghost. She's in travail. The church is then to bring forth little ones crying, "My God, my God, see Aba Father." That's how we come through these those elements in the presence of God for fellowship. Fellowship is only recognized under the blood. So should the church be bringing forth little ones? &gt;&gt; I just read it for you. &gt;&gt; The church should be bringing forth little ones. Now he um goes forward paragraph 249 in the message Revelations chapter 4 and he says this here, the soul of man is the nature of the spirit and the spirit dwells in the heart of man. Now, now what is the outer courts? That's the flesh. See, that's the first thing you come to the flesh. You got to consume that first. You got pass beyond the flesh. I don't feel like getting up and going to church. The roads are too slick. It's too hot. Oh, church. I don't know. That's the flesh. All right. Now, you got to consume and walk through that. God has to get through that. The next time he come, he comes into the soul. That's the nature. Or what will the Joneses say about me? Oh my, you know, my church will kick me out if I do something like that. See, but you got to walk through that. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Walk through that." &gt;&gt; And when you walk through that, then he goes into the heart &gt;&gt; and there's where he's thrown. That's the Holy Spirit in you. Jesus said, "It'd be far better that a millstone was hanged at your neck and you was drowned in the depths of the sea than to even offend one of these little ones that believe in me. Not do them any harm, just even to bring offense to them. Just upset them about something. Huh? It'd be better that you had your own self drowned or had never been born on the earth than to even bring an offense to one. Did he mean it? Could he lie, sir? &gt;&gt; How many people in here tonight, y'all going to help me preach or no? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; All right. Did the apostle say it? No. No. Jesus said it. Jesus said, "If you even bring an offense to one of them, these little ones that believe in me." So you see now, Brother Brandon brings this, the Holy Spirit is enthroned in the individual not to just do them harm, just to offend them. You got to be careful talking about people, hurting people. You say, "Well, he's not a minister." Doesn't matter if he's a believer. Don't offend those little ones. Prophet brings it out right here. All right. In the message, why I believe it said in the scripture, in so much as you done unto the least least of my little ones, you've did it to me, so I am the least one. So, brother Vam is using this example and taking this scripture from Matthew chapter number 25 and using it multiple ways. How many remember that story he was giving about the gentleman in the drugstore during the time of the depression? I believe it's in the message the paradox. He said this pregnant lady came in for her medication and he heard her his son he was training his son to be a drugist and the son said you know this is how much it's going to cost and this mother said we don't have the money. The dad said we don't have the money. He told him, "Well, go down the down the block there and stand in line and they'll have some uh money support so you can come back and get it." And the old um drugist was in the back there and he says something told him, "No, don't do that. Go stop them." So he sends his son out to stop her and he stop her and bring bring her back. Says, "Come on back, ma'am. We'll just give you this um this prescriptions because you having to stand in line for all of that. um that would be very hard for you to do. And he's telling us a story to brother Brandham. He says when he took those drugs and he went to place it into to her hand, he saw nail scarred hands. &gt;&gt; And then when he looked up, it was our Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Brother Bam, do you believe that?" He says, "I absolutely believe it." He said it was a paradox. It was that scripture, in so much you have done it unto the least of these. So, we don't know when these moments arise, do we? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; You know, the the scripture makes it clear. You came and saw me when I was in prison. You saw me. You fed me when I was hungry. You gave to me. He said, "Lord, when do we do these things?" Well, when you in so much you did it unto the least of these, you were doing that unto me. And then he turns to the goats and he says, "You did not come and see me. You did not come and feed me. you didn't come visit me when I was serving. Says, Lord, when do we not do these things to her? Says, when you didn't do it for these. &gt;&gt; That's pretty strong. Now, I want you to embrace that. That's pretty strong. When you didn't do it to these, that's the sin of omission. Omitting to do something that you should do. We're always talking about commission. What you've committed. Don't do this. Don't do that. What about the things that we are not doing? And so I think getting us zeroed in on what our great mission is and what we're supposed to be doing, then we are commissioned. That's not um waiting for something to happen. We're going out there to make things happen because he's called us to go preach the gospel. Amen. Not just pray for the sinner, go talk to them and preach the gospel to them. &gt;&gt; Brother Bannon brings this up also in the message Paradox. He was talking about the great St. Martin even before his conversion. And this is what helped start him on his great conversion. It's time of the winter. He had his uh h soldiers coat on. It was extreme temperatures. and he saw this beggar out on the street there and St. Martin takes his coat and he cuts it in half and he gives it to the beggar and he looked pretty odd. A pretty crazy looking soldier with half of a garment but he did it to help this poor man. That night, the Lord appeared to him in a dream with that coat on, half of that coat on, and that struck Martin, and that started his ministry. Knowing that you do this to the least. Now, we'll do it to people who have power and authority and maybe wealthy. We'll listen to them. We'll spend time with them. We'll spend time with people that we consider important. But these are the people, the poor, the needy, the less in the the less fortunate, these little opportunities that we have to give to the little ones. Amen. &gt;&gt; So those are some nice some quick examples that the prophet has brought to us. So, I like this thought where where where he he opens up this scripture in Zechariah 13 &gt;&gt; and he's talking about how little Benjamin is growing and coming up. And I believe that the result of what's going on in the message churches today and the church world today, I'm talking about 2025, you can look out there and the word, the Bible, the message will tell you why things are going the way they are. &gt;&gt; I believe there is an answer and it's in this message. &gt;&gt; You see the craziness going on. You see the dynamics change. You see, people will argue with you about things that they never would argue about. They question even the gifts of the spirit and question whether you should even go to church or not. I think the answer for all of that behavior is in the word. &gt;&gt; That's why it's here for us so that we can have the answer to guide us so we're not walking around blindly just letting the day go by and just like I don't know what's going to happen. Well, well, you know, whoever they vote for, then I'll be happy. And if they don't vote, then I won't be happy. No, no, no. That's not a believer. A believer is focused. He's centered. He's going somewhere. He's going in a direction. And we know there's a great persecution coming. We know they're going to get more upset and more hostile against the true church of the living God. They did it to our Lord. They did it to the shepherd. They're going to do it to the sheep, too. &gt;&gt; Are we ready for that? Or is our worldly uh treasures more important? &gt;&gt; I believe that there's a growing church growing now. &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart. &gt;&gt; I believe I'm one of the seeds of Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I I you know that's that's my belief. You can have that belief too. But I believe that this message has changed my life. &gt;&gt; It has changed my life. It is the reason why I am moving the way that I move. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's important to me, why I'm studying, why I'm after it, what I my heart is, and what my goals are. It's because this message has come into my life &gt;&gt; directly and it's having an effect on me. &gt;&gt; I'm better than I was five years ago. I sure hope I'm better tomorrow than I am today. &gt;&gt; I don't want to go backwards. &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness, somebody? &gt;&gt; I want to go forward. And when you see me in five years, I want to be better &gt;&gt; than what I am today. &gt;&gt; That's the effects of the word of God. That's what it does. It was in its infancy, little Benjamin, but Benjamin is growing. So, there's a true church growing as well. Let's take a little bit of this. Now, now brother Vanom takes this is kind of lengthy and it really blessed my heart when brother uh Joseph from Nigeria was here and he read that uh quote out of the end time sign seed and it really blessed me. So let's take that in 1962 the prophet of God says this and he's talking about the magis. He's talking about the flying saucers that the Pentagon was dealing with in this time of the of of of our history. And paragraph 152, he says, "Listen, how many and every one of you seen the nation has been shook up just recently about signs. Did you see what this man in orbit the other day? He found things up there he never science don't even know what they are." when he passed around the Earth. Yet they've looked and looked and looked, but they didn't see them. He thought his orbit was coming to pieces. It wasn't so. His orbit was all right. Lights. Look what's been over. You've seen it in the radio. You saw it on television. It's been in the newspaper. Flying saucers everywhere. And the Pentagon let it out the other day. And about six weeks ago, it wasn't fictitious. They even showed it on television how they caught those saucers with intelligence lights that come down hanging over the Pentagon like that all over Washington DC. They caught it on radar and had pilots up there that come right in around them, surround them, move away with lightning speed and intelligence. What is it? Jesus said there will be fearful signs, sights in the heavens, men's hearts failing, fear, perplexity of times, distress between nations. Don't you see that seed time is here now? The harvest time, the things that the Bible said would come to pass. That seed that's been planted, don't you see? It has taken life and living. &gt;&gt; That's what's the matter. Now just one thing more listen before now listen close don't fail to find this now before the first coming of Jesus the astronomers of India magis I missionared in India talked with the magi about this they were watching they were astronomers they were watching the heavenly bodies and they say God always declares himself in the heavenly body before he does in the earth before he does anything. And they said, "Why when this three wise men went to worship the king that was to rule the earth, a baby king, they followed a star." Your scripture says, he said, "But frankly, there was three stars came together and made this one star." And they say that the Christian astronomer that I was talking to or magi, he said that means that there were three races of people that this man died for. The only three races there is Ham, Sham, and Jeff's people. When his gospel has been preached to Ham, Sham, and Jeff's people, they come together in his gospel, then the return will be that's all right if he wants to believe that. Three is a number of perfection. But what do I believe that the three was? What do we believe? It was a three of perfection, showing that the Trinity of God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost was made manifest in a man, Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The one perfect man. All other men had failed. Everything else had died. But here come a man that couldn't die. Perfection that even death couldn't kill him. rose up again. Three is the number of perfection. We all know that three is God's number in his numerology. God is known by his number. Three is perfection. Seven is worship. 24 is worship. 40 is temptation. 50 is Pentecost. Jubilee, see forth. All his numbers, his numerals of God is perfected in perfection. Now, three is a number of perfection. Just before skip down to ver paragraph 159. Now, now what's happened? We see a roar in the paper across the television out across the nations where five stars just fell in line with the world. What's five? A number of grace. Every time those stars come, then something happens on earth. What taking place? Five stars fell in. What was it? introducing what since then you just look what's taking place Germany almost washed off the map some of the mag said that the world would burst like a watermelon every distressful thing that's prophesied by them for the last days looks what h look what h look what's taking place England the other day a storm that blowed away 70,000 houses one day disasters everywhere There California, Los Angeles like to wash into the ocean. What is it? Beginning of sorrows. Earthquakes has picked up everywhere. Why is it five stars come in line? Grace, God's grace. What's happened? An infant church. Hallelujah. A bride. Infancy that the power of God has be to fall on her. She is taking form a bride for this bridegroom. That three stars meant his perfection of the heavenly father of the trinity becoming one on earth among us. God's offices becoming one office. What happened now? It's the church of the living God coming together under the word of God. And the astronomic astronomic heaven is announcing her approach. Amen. Might not believe that, but it's the word just the same. Yes, sir. Who controls the heavens? &gt;&gt; Who set the stars and the lights and their patterns? Who who who has them orbiting the way that they do? You know, the June sun is the June skies is not the same as the November skies. They're always reading. It's always moving. How well I understood more of that when Sharon and I took this tour up on Mount Lemon. Dubai gave us a tour, got us a tour up there. Very interesting. One of the guys was talking and he was I asked him about that star with the magis. He says, "Yeah, that was a tremendous star." And I says, "You know what I'm taught is that those there were three stars." He says, "Yes." I says, "Those three stars became one star, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the Lord Jesus." He said, "Wow, I never saw that." I says, "Yeah, I just came up with that myself." He says, "Man, I never I never thought of that. This guy's searches the heavens. He searches the skies." Just a little seventh grader gave me that information. Praise the Lord. Woo my what's happening in the closing. I might say this friends, the church is coming forth. This is paragraph 162. God is going to have a church without spot or wrinkle. Now, do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. You know that scripture, that prophecy that I've been reading out of communion that brother Balam says God's going to dwell with his people and that church is coming up the road. You just remember that. That's prophecy to me. I'm hanging on to that. I'm believing that. I believe that as the prophet told us that Ramsy's was growing at the same time that Moses was growing. When Ramsy's was growing down in Egypt, his political power to put pressure on the Hebrews and bring a great and tremendous crisis to them. God was dealing with Moses out in the desert, too. And as this world has lost its mind, they're crazy. They have no sense. the arguments, it just doesn't make any, it has no foundation to it at all. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about college degrees on the college campuses, great minds, they have lost it, &gt;&gt; and yet they're advancing in science all the time. They're constantly making things better and faster and more tremendous. And the church is growing, too. [Music] And when I said the church, I'm talking about a person. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about individuals. I believe it's growing too. So the prophet brings in this day that shall come that there will never neither be day nor night. It'll be the evening time. It'll say and it says in the prophecy that that there shall be light in the evening time. We're still in the evening time. The prophet is not here with us that we can go and have a private interview with him. And many of the witnesses that walk with him, they're not here either. Those candlesticks have been removed from us. And the great leaders and the great teachers and the preachers that have gone on before us, they're being taken from us one by one. But there's coming a church that's going to take every word of God. And God is going to have a church without spot, blemish, or wrinkle. All that God was, he poured into Christ. All that Christ was, what did he do? He poured it into the church. &gt;&gt; Didn't die in 65 or 77 or 84 or 2020. It didn't die. The church is still growing. &gt;&gt; It's more powerful to me than it's ever been. &gt;&gt; Others are leaving. Some of us are going deeper into it. &gt;&gt; Some of us are more encouraged than ever before. &gt;&gt; Who am I talking to tonight? &gt;&gt; Who's on fire tonight? &gt;&gt; How many know that this word is true? &gt;&gt; How many know that this is the rapturing grace? is right here. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm not discouraged. I'm encouraged. &gt;&gt; I'm not getting ready to quit. I'm trying to start again. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to remember what the Lord has done for me. &gt;&gt; I was lost. I was indifferent. I was bound. I couldn't help myself. But a power came down from heaven and changed my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the reason I'm here today. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [Music] Nobody didn't paint a picture. Nobody sent me to a seminar, &gt;&gt; but I repented of my sins. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost got a hold of me &gt;&gt; and did for me what I could never do for myself. And that same power is still here today. &gt;&gt; It's in the word of God. Amen. Glory. Glory. So, let's talk to you little ones. You little ones, huh? That didn't get to get into Brother Banner's meetings. Wouldn't you love to be there? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; But why you didn't go? Why didn't you go? You couldn't go. If you was there, you would have went, right? But you're here now. So, what you going to do? Oh my. You're going to take this word here and it's going to explode in you and the world can't stop it. &gt;&gt; You don't have to ask permission to praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You don't have to ask permission to say amen to God's word. Once that seed drops into a fertile heart, it's got to come forth. It must come forth. &gt;&gt; And that's what's happening. That's what's happening to us. &gt;&gt; You say, "I'm kind of pregnant." No, no, no, no, no. You got to have that baby, sis. You got to have You got to have birth. &gt;&gt; It's already started. &gt;&gt; Can't go back now, brother. to go back and do what? Go back where? &gt;&gt; Ain't nothing going on out there. It's crazy foolishness. They lost their mind. Nothing is sane except what's in the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; I thank God I'm on the road. I believe I'm on the road and we're coming forward. Now hear what brother Brandham says in the anointed ones at the end time 1965. I'll close at these last two or three quotes. He says paragraph 45, now the sun comes across and ripens the grain. Now it cannot ripen it all at once. As it goes on maturing, it constantly ripens until it comes to a full ear. So is it today with the church. It started in its infancy back in the dark ages where it was under the ground. It's grown now into maturity and we can see it perfectly how that God through nature always. You cannot disturb nature. That's what's the matter today. We're flying bombs out there in that ocean, breaking it, busting it around with atomic bombs. You're just breaking more of that dirt off all the time, dropping into it. You cut down the trees, storms will take you. Dam up the river, it'll overflow. You've got to find God's way of doing things and stay in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've denominated people in the churches, organizations. Look what we got. Stay in God's provided way of it. &gt;&gt; How many wants to do that tonight? Amen. &gt;&gt; Stay in God's provided way of it. Here the prophet said in the third Exodus, what's this new pope saying? Four things that he wants. One of them is to unite the Protestant and the Catholic together. To any intellectual person, that's the thing to do. But according to the Bible, it's the wrong thing to do. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said they would do that. Let's go a little further. At this time, Ramsy's in Egypt was growing. His power is growing. The natural man Ramsy's was growing. The natural man, the antichrist, is growing now through politics. He's already got to the White House. In religion, he's got all the people so scrupled up to actually they'll fall right for it. That's right. and the denominational leaders. Practically every church that there is in the nation is already in the confederation of churches. Ramsy's is growing and they're all uniting together. And that's why that's what they'll that's what they'll have. And what does it do? It makes a power a beast just like the first one. Then there's a persecution coming upon all those who won't unite with it and a boycott. Somebody say boycott. &gt;&gt; It'll be too late then. You've already took the mark. That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't say I'll do it then. You better do it now. Ramsy's was growing. But remember, while Ramsy's was growing into power in Egypt, God had Moses in the wilderness. He was growing too. &gt;&gt; Ramsy's had a political system. God had a spiritual system under a prophet, &gt;&gt; ready to come down to speak to the people. They're both growing again. It'll be a showdown one of these days. The time ain't far off when there will come a showdown. As the natural, as the scripture says, the natural type, the spiritual, you can't get away from it. There it is. It's right before your eyes. It's truth. Look at the church now calling out, coming into power, the Holy Spirit coming down, the mysteries of God being revealed, set in order. And right here, she's already in the White House. And the church is pulling itself together. Amen. Not a denomination out of the bondage of iniquities, away from the Amorites of people. That's free. &gt;&gt; Are you free tonight? &gt;&gt; How many love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Are you growing? &gt;&gt; Ramsy's is growing. The political system is growing. this gentleman that was killed and shot on the college campus and people online rejoiced behind that. They loved it. They laughed at it. They made jokes about it. It just shows you the the where the heart of the people are. Just hard and harsh. You don't want that hard harsh spirit to come on you. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; You want a heart of flesh where you know how to repent. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember the the if you fail to repent, I'll remove the candlestick. Brother Vanam says that the light that you have will turn into darkness if you don't. You notice people sitting in churches holding grudges against one another like little baby fouryear-old, 5-year-old little crimes, nursery crimes. We're supposed to be growing in the power of the spirit. &gt;&gt; We're supposed to be supposed to be mature sons and daughters of God. We're supposed to be speaking to the circumstance, &gt;&gt; speaking to the storm, &gt;&gt; and still congregations that will not repent. They remove the candlestick. They remove the messenger from their messages, from their ministries. &gt;&gt; They're disassociating him, &gt;&gt; from their ministries. they're doing. They want to draw more the the people out there, the great greater crowds, and don't want to offend anybody. &gt;&gt; Like, brother Brandham came on his own. Like, that was his own personal choice to come. &gt;&gt; God sent brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; God sent him so he wouldn't smite the earth with a curse. &gt;&gt; God sent Elijah to save you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Be like you being ashamed of your mama and your daddy. Shame on a ministry. Ashamed of this messenger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're ashamed of Apostle Paul. &gt;&gt; Shamed of Moses. Ashamed of who told you how to uh cross the farmer's fence? &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Brother Bam told us how to cross a farmer's fence. Huh? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Did he? You listen to enough tapes, he'll teach you. He'll show you. But they removed this candlestick. They removed him and their light has turned into darkness. And that's that's what's going on right now. This is I have to read the message. I have to say, "Okay, speak to me. What's going on here?" I I can't just go along with the crowd. I can't say, "Well, this is just normal." Because it's not normal. &gt;&gt; I've never seen this before. I've never seen the dynamics that's going on. So, I pray. I say, "Lord, what's going on here? What is where are we at? Then you pick up the message. Bam. There's the answer. &gt;&gt; They have removed the Did I wake y'all up? &gt;&gt; Well, at least I didn't do what George did. &gt;&gt; I need to get me a little little thing like from Brother George and do that. &gt;&gt; Y'all excuse me. All right. But when something explodes off of your Bible, out of the message, and it gives you the answer, oh, that's what's going on. I see what's going on now. &gt;&gt; They've removed the candlestick and the church ages. Brother Vanam says, then God will remove its faithful messenger and the faithful shepherds, and he'll leave them to theirelves. &gt;&gt; It's a quote. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what's going on. And the ones that did have light, it turned into darkness. &gt;&gt; They started with taking the pictures out and stop quoting from him. What they going to do next? What they going to do next? &gt;&gt; What they going to do next? Cuz they're not done. &gt;&gt; But we have repented, haven't we? &gt;&gt; And so the Lord doesn't remove that light from us because our heart stays repented. And with a repented heart, the Lord will not turn away. He will speak to you if your heart is right. I believe that. I believe it's a wicked hour. I believe it's a dark hour. I believe it's not an hour that I can figure it out. But I am led, sons and daughters of God are led by the spirit of God. And the answers are right here for us. &gt;&gt; This is what's taking place. Ramsy's is growing and so is the church. The power of God is growing. Can I take one more quotation in the seven church ages? The messenger says this here. I'm sorry, third Exodus. Let me finish that quote. Paragraph 150. But remember, while Ramsy's was growing in the power in Egypt, God had Moses in the wilderness. He was growing too. Ramsy's had a political system. God had a spiritual system under a prophet ready to come down to speak to the people. They're both growing again. &gt;&gt; It'll be a showdown one of these days. That time ain't far off when there will come a showdown. &gt;&gt; As the scripture says, the natural types, the spiritual, what's a showdown? That's like that's like going through the final four and then the last two teams are standing after the playoffs. All the little mediocre challenges and tests have been well done. This is the Super Bowl. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; this is two champions in the 12th round. And that 10th, 11th, and 12th round is called the championship rounds. This is where we are at right now. This is the 11th hour showing up. 11th hour worker. &gt;&gt; This is that little bride member that heard the word and now it's coming to her senses. &gt;&gt; This is that boy. This is that girl. This is that pastor. This is that church that woke up and said, "You know what? God have mercy on me. Please, Lord, don't leave me. Fill me with the power of the Holy Ghost for the rapture and the great power that's coming. &gt;&gt; Wake up, somebody. Wake up. Shalom. Wake up my sister. Wake up my brother. This is what that is. In exposition of the seven church ages, the messenger says this here. It's written like this. And yet it is the harvest time. Then there must come upon the scene in this age those who will bring the wheat and tears to maturity. &gt;&gt; Huh? The tears are already maturing very fast &gt;&gt; under what? Corrupt teachers &gt;&gt; who turn the people from what? &gt;&gt; Word. &gt;&gt; What word are we talking about? The Baptist word, &gt;&gt; the Pentecostal word that turn them from the word. The word of this day. They turn them from the word and they're maturing very fast &gt;&gt; under corrupt teachers. &gt;&gt; These are the tears. I didn't write it. This is the prophet said it. &gt;&gt; Tears are already maturing very fast under corrupt teachers who turn the people from the word. But the wheat also must mature. And to her God is sending the prophet messenger with the vindicated ministry that he might be accepted by the elect. &gt;&gt; They will hear him as the first church heard Paul and she will mature in the word until becoming a word bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; The mighty works will be found in her that are always attended upon the pure word and faith. Can you say, "Praise the Lord?" &gt;&gt; Is that you? &gt;&gt; Two groups maturing here. &gt;&gt; There's a Ramsay group and the Moses group. There's the tear group and the wheat group. There's the false group and there's a true vine. and they're maturing under the prophet messenger. &gt;&gt; We are those little ones, aren't we? &gt;&gt; We're the 11th hour worker. We are the bride that was in its infancy being born that he talked about. You know, the bride is going to have a revival. &gt;&gt; There will be a bride revival. I believe that. I believe that. I believe that. I believe that. I'd rather believe that than believe the other options you might have out there. We need a revival, don't we? &gt;&gt; Some people don't want a revival. You know who don't want a revival? The devil. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; The devil wants you to stay exactly the way you are. &gt;&gt; Like you already got it. You're already in. You heard that tape already. Yeah, you preached that already. Yeah, we heard that already. A tape again. That's the carnality. &gt;&gt; But the believer come in looking for a amen moment. Where can I say amen? &gt;&gt; Looking for a minute to jump off. &gt;&gt; Run the owls. &gt;&gt; Some of y'all ain't ran the owl in a long time. Like maybe ever. We've kept these aisles nice and wide so you can run them. All right. &gt;&gt; Don't run them because I said run them. You run them when your fire gets lit. And God bless you. I know you're running the owls in your spirit. &gt;&gt; All right. We want to see you run them by living a life that's worthy of the gospel. Amen. So, God bless you richly. The bride is growing and and she's growing even right now. I believe that with all all my heart. I believe that this prophecy has to be fulfilled that God's going to dwell with his people. And so that's our desire. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Let us pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word tonight. We ask your blessings upon the people in the word, those that heard the word, the saints that maybe couldn't be here tonight. I pray you'll bless them, oh God, that they would begin to mature under the prophet messenger that you sent in this hour. It's not me promoting anything. It's what you did. Behold, I send unto you. I send you. I, God, sent you, &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet. Lord, I receive that. I just humbly I receive it and and and I want to be humble with it, Lord. I want to take it and just really embrace it with all of my heart. Grant it, Lord. Make it real to me. Stir it up in my spirit once again, Lord. Take a stand. See politics. This great pope that came out of America. Wow. What a prophecy. never knew that before. Never heard of such a thing. But we have been warned. &gt;&gt; And we've seen these things coming to pass and science and its progress. The the vehicles that are driving themselves and all of the science, how it's progressed as told to us through prophecy. &gt;&gt; But the church is growing also. and she's growing right now. And that church is one or two, few here, a few there. A as your grace would allow us to grow. Lord, may I stand in that position as a true bride member that heard the call, that heard the voice that's coming under this great ministry. Lord, forgive us of our sins and may we repent where we have fallen short. of this grace, Lord. Lord, put it in our hearts to be a witness of these things to tell somebody about your salvation, your grace, your mercy. Grant it, Lord Jesus. We give you the praise, all the glory, all the honor in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. power. The name of the Lord though save and red brother Scott shall not be defeated. &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. [Music] We've got the power in the name of Jesus. We've got the power in the name of the Lord. Though Satan raes, I will not be defeated. We've got the power in the name of the Lord. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise for that this season. Amen. If you'll stand with me. I try to uh take from the service and get some ideas for songs for afterwards when he calls up. And the only thing kept sticking was this old world can never hold me. This old world can never hold me anymore. and I'll be gone. For I made my conse ation and I have garments on. This old world can never hold me anymore. And I'll be gone for I made my consecration and I have my wedding garments on this old world. know this old world can never hold me anymore. [Music] And I'll be gone for I may consecration and I have my wedding garment on. And this world is not my home. I'm just a passing crew. My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue. The angels beckoning me from heaven's open floor. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Oh Lord, you know I have no brain like you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord, what will I do? The angels begging me from heaven's open door. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Well, they're all expecting me. And that's one thing I know. I fixed it up with Jesus so many years ago. I know he'll see me through. Though I am weeping and I can feel at home in this world into the last verse, the sobering glory land we will live eternally. The saints on every hand are shouting victory. The song of sweetest praise bring back from heaven shore. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Oh Lord, you know I have no like you. Lord, what will I do? The angels beckoning me from heaven's open door. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you. Heaven's not my home. Then Lord, what will I do? Brother Caleb, would you come and dismiss tonight? Still at home in this world anymore. Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you. My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue. Angels beckon me from heaven's open door. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Just glory land. will live eternally. The saints on every man shouting victory the song of sweetest praise drip from heaven sure and I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Oh Lord, do you know I have no friend like you? Heaven's not my home. Then Lord, what will I do? Angels back in me from heaven's open door. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Oh, I'm shackled by a heavy burden. Beneath the load of guilt and shame. Then the hand of Jesus touched me. And now I am no longer the same. [Music] Oh, you touch me. Wo, you touch me. And all the joy that floods my soul. Something happened. Now I know he touched me and made me whole. [Music] Well, since I met this blessed savior, since he came and made me whole, [Music] I shall never cease to praise him. I'll shout it while eternity rolls. Oh, he touched me. Oh, he touched me. and all the joy that floods my soul. [Music] Something happened. And now I know he touched me and made me more one last time. Oh, he touched me. Oh, he touched me. [Music] And all the joy that floods my soul. Brother Caleb, if you would come and dismiss. Something happened and now I know he touched me and made me whole. &gt;&gt; Dear Lord, we appreciate coming here tonight, Lord. Thank you Lord Jesus for this morning the tape Lord. We appreciate it Lord. Brother, Lord, we appreciate Brother Po coming up here, Lord, and just speaking his heart, Lord, the things that move him, Lord.
