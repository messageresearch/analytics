========================================

take your Bibles and turn in Revelations chapter 6 we're in that first seal we'll read two verses there verses one and two and um be reading or listening to from paragraph 81 to paragraph 129 in the first seal for for their Sunday school amen let's bow our heads for a word of prayer Lord Jesus we thank you for bringing us together once again Lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy we ask

are are coming that are on their way those that are on the stream Lord we commit them each one into your hands we pray in Jesus name amen Revelations 6 verse1 and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four Beast saying come and see and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer amen well let um let's sing only believe and we take this tape amen only [Music] believe only believe all things are possible only believe only believe only believe all things are possible only God bless you may be seated brother brand Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect and how could we even start the thought of being perfect but Jesus required it and if Jesus required it he's got the make a way for it and he has his own blood now all Reveals All the Mysteries that's gone on in the past now the thought is here at the end time that the Mysteries that begin way back long ago and come down through the church ages is to be revealed here at the breaking of the seal here at the last days after the time of intercession just about finished at that time then the judgments wait for those you in the back they go on out into that that is after the bride has been taken from the scene oh let's just read a scripture y'all like put on some the scriptures let's take second Thessalonians just a moment and and look here just a minute it's such a beautiful picture here I like it and um uh uh let's see yeah second Thessalonians and I want the second chapter of 2 Thessalonians and the the seventh verse let's see second Thessalonians 2 and 7 I think that's right now I was write this down quivering and shaking the mystery of iniquity do already work only he who leth will let until he be taken out of the wayen who he that lth see see a mystery the mystery of iniquity way back in that very first church age here here's Paul writing saying that the mystery of iniquity what is Iniquity iniquity is something that you know you ought not to do and you do it anyhow and Paul said there such in the Earth today workers of iniquity oh if you we're going to get to the let's just read that piece this start up a little farther the third verse let the old man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that m n man of sin be revealed a son of predition right who opposes and exalts himself above all that's called God are they that is worship so that he as God Seth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God remitting sin remember you not that when I was yet with you I've told you these things I'd like to set under some of these teachings for you and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his hand not man see not the but in his time see at the breaking of that seal we know exactly what it was who is this man of iniquity who is this man of sin this fellow that's a working iniquity but he be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity does already work deceivers you see deceiving the people off in something only he God that lth will let until he the church Christ the bride be taken out of the way and then shall the wicked one be revealed at the breaking of the seal at his time Paul said not in my time but in the time when you'll be revealed see whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth we're going to get to that after a while the spirit of his mouth watch what that is and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of Satan him him a man whose working is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all dece thisness of unrighteousness deceiving people by unrighteousness in them that perish not this bride in them that's looking for such a thing because they receive not the love of the truth and Christ is the truth and Christ is the word but they better have a cre that they might be saved and for this cause God has sent them strong delusion that they should believe a lie it should be translated there as a look in the Leon the LI not AI the LIE same one he told eeve that they might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness what a statement M after the bride is taken away then this man of sin will reveal himself she the true bride of Christ has been elected out of every Church age now the other day I made a statement the bride could go home and you'll never know anything about it that's true somebody said uh well brother Brown that would be a mighty small group Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah I you talk to him about it wherein eight Souls were saved by water so shall it be in the coming of the son of man if they was 800 went in the Rapture tonight you never hear a word about it tomorrow the next day or no other time it'd be gone you didn't know nothing about it it just be the same thing what am I trying to say I'm not trying to scare you wear you um I want you to be on your toes amen be ready watching every minute quit your nonsense just get out to business with God because it's later than you think now remember the true bride now there is a false bride we get that in Revelation 17 he said I am a widow and have no need of nothing and see sitting up on this scolar cold beast and so forth the Beast rather now but the true bride will be made up of thousands times thousands of people but it will be the elect out of every Church age every time a message went forth and the people believed in an ex deped and all the light it was when they were sealed away until that day of redemption Jesus speaks the same thing when he said the soundc and the seventh watch that's the last Church age and said behold a bridegroom cometh go out to Mee him then the sleeping virsion come rub their eyes and said suppose I already has some that R too so uh maybe you better have some and the real true bride stand there said we just got enough for ourselves we just got enough get in herself we can't give you nothing if you want something you go pray up and while she was gone the bridegroom come and in went the Bri and then the remnant there the ones that were absolutely virgins the church was left outside and he said there will be weeping and wailing and nashing of PE see now that's the elect and when the sound come the bridegroom cometh then every one of those that slept down through those ages awaken everyone see it isn't God as we'd think just go to Honey mount a few thousand people of this age and take them it's a very elected out of every age and that's the reason Christ has to stay on the Met Road seat back here as an intercessor until that last one comes in at the last age and these Revelations and of what it has been breaks forth upon the people and they see what's happened you get it now all right notice the rest of the Dead church members live not again until 1,000 years was passed the church members the the Christian the church live not a again until the end of the thousand years and then they come forth to stand before the bride right stand before the king and the queen Glory some church today calls yourself the Queen of Heaven the Queen of Heaven is the selected bride of [Music] [Applause] Christ and she comes with him Daniel saw it said 10,000 times 10,000s minister to him now if you watch the scripture there in Daniel judgment was set and the books were open now remember when he come he come with his bride the wife ministers to her husband and 10 thousands times 10 thousands of thousands minister to him judgment was set and the books were open and another book was open which is The Book of Life not the bride at all she's done gone up and come back and standing there in Judgment of those Generations that refused the gospel message didn't Jesus say the queen of the South shall rise for this generation in her days of the judgment and will condemn the generation for she came from the utmost parts of the world to hear the wisdom of Solomon and a greater than Solomon is here there stood the uh the Judgment the queen of uh of Sheba of the South stood there in the judgment and her own testimony not even a Jew came up with that generation that was Jews and they were blind and Misty because because they were looking for him but he comes so simple that they want come over the top of it like that and there the great Queen humbled herself and come and accepted the message and she'll stand in the Judgment he said and condemn that generation I see the three classes always the book The Dead were judged out another book the book Book of Life them who had their names in The Book of Life say your names in The Book of Life it's all right huh no sir look Judas is a carot had his name in The Book of Life I say that's wrong Jesus in Matthew 10 gave them power to cast out devils and sent them forth to heal the sick and to cleanse the lepers and raise the dead and they went out and returned back Judas right with them and they cast out devils and done all kinds of Miracles and returned back and said even the Devils is subject unto us Jesus said don't Rejoice that the devil's is subject to you but Rejoice because your names are written in heaven and Judas was with them but what happened when it come down to the elected group to go up there at Pentecost and really receive the Holy Spirit showed his color be there in the Judgment so the books was open and a book the life was open and every man was judged thus now the bride standing there with Christ to judge the word don't the Paul say dare you talking to the bride having any manner grievance against each other that you go to the unjust law don't you know the Saints shall judge the Earth there you are the Saints is go to judge the Earth and take it over right see H in the world a little group like that I don't know how it's going to be done but he said it's going to be done that just settles it as far as I know I know now notice the rest of the Dead the church members dead church members live not again until a thousand years and then at the thousand years they were gathered another Resurrection come which is second resurrection and they were gathered and Christ and the church the bride not the church the bride Christ and the queen not the church church Christ and the bride stood there and they were separated like the sheep from the goats right there's the church members come up and if they heard heard the truth and rejected the truth then what's going to be said when the big things spread across the canvas when even your own thoughts will be there what you thought about it I go escap and it right on the canvas of the skies and God's Great television there your own thoughts rebelling your own thoughts will speak against you in that hour so if you speak one thing and think another you better stop that get your thoughts on God keep them pure and stay right there with it and speak the same thing all the time don't say well I'll say I believe it but I'll go find out you believe it amen notice these type reason they die out they go through the purging of trial of the tribulation because they're not actually under the blood they claim they are but they're not how can they go through a trial to purify them when there's when the bleached blood of Jesus Christ takes every symptom of sin and stuff and you are already dead and your life is hidden him through God and sealed in there of the Holy Ghost what are you going to be judged for where you going to get your purification what you have to be purified from when you're perfectly in Christ sinly how what's the Judgment for but it's a sleeping bunch of them people can't make out now they haven't done it for years see but this is the hour of Revelation being revealed just at the coming of the Bride the last winding up the last things are coming is coming to an end friend I believe when I don't know I I can't tell you but anything I want to live tonight like if it was tonight I'd be ready he might come tonight yet he might might not come for 20 years I don't know when he'll come but whenever it is my life might be over tonight and then whatever I've done here is finished at that hour I I've got to meet him in the Judgment the way I went out here the way the little tree leans that's way it falls remember when they went to buy or they why say now wait a minute brother BR I don't know about that when they went to buy or when they come back the bride was done gone and the door was shut and they knocked and said let us in let us in but they were out and outer dark now if you want to type of that now look in the time of Noah Jesus said referred to it now in Noah's time they went into the ark but they were carried over D during the time of the Judgment but that that didn't type Christ's bride Enoch typed the bride amen Enoch Noah went over through the bride went over through the tribulation period and suffered and become a drunk and died but Enoch walked before God for 500 years and had a testimony he pleased god with raptured faith and just started walking right out and went up to disguise and went home without even tasting death never died at all that's a type of we which are alive and remain shall not perent or hinder those same type of people that are asleep that fell asleep on account of human age and a in the state of human age they died back there but they're not dead they are sleeping amen they are asleep not dead and the only thing it needs is a bridegroom to wake them and we which are alive and remain shall not hinder those that's already fell asleep for the trumpet of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them and will meet the Lord in the air and the rest of the Dead live not for a thousand years there you are they went through the tribulation period what was was like Enoch you know Noah watched Enoch for when Enoch come up missing he know judgment was at hand he got the hanging around the ark but Noah didn't go up he just lifted a little piece off and rote over the tribulations he was carried through the tribulation period to die to day see but Noah was carried through Enoch was translated without death a type of the church being caught up with those who are asleep to meet the Lord in the air and the rest of the church is carried over into the tribulation period take make nothing else out of it myself he not raptured no death [Music] for [Music] for [Music] all [Music] h [Music] for [Music] h [Music] h [Music] h [Music] oh

bless you and uh God bless each of you we like to go right into the word uh this morning and um in the scripture there brother random started it right in the seals that we're listening to in adult Sunday school I'll just have one passage of scripture this morning just for the opening that's in Matthew chapter 5 remember this as we're turning they remember this uh uh youth meeting youth service everyone is welcome brother Caleb donon at Amazing Grace Temple had this on his heart and so he called me and brother Jason Musgrove over at charity Tabernacle I wanted to do something for the Youth it's a rally around the spirit for for a soldout life that's the name of it the title or the theme I should say and he's asked there's a young man that's married to Jason musk's uh daughter I think he's 24 years old Axel he'll be speaking and they've also asked our own Levi to exhort for a few minutes there and so um I'm sure Levi would love for you to come and support him amen and and say Amen to the word if you can that's on Friday at 700 p.m. Amazing Grace Temple the the uh the little flyer there is on the board and the back of course everyone is welcome to be a part of that and so always want to encourage our youth and especially those that are feel like they might have a call in their life amen in Matthew Chapter 5 Jesus is on what we call The Sermon on the Mount it's actually Matthew 56 and 7 is the same Ser sermon he's covering a lot of territory in verse um number in Matthew 5 the last of that chapter verse number 48 says be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect so he's um going through a number of things of what the Old Testament said and then he's making it more plain for a present day truth you've heard it been said Moses said it you have it in your laws but I say unto you and he really opens it up even greater and puts what brother bandam calls a magnifying glass on the law and opens it up and so be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect let us pray Lord Jesus we ask your blessings on your word this morning bless every heart we pray in jesus' name break away every Spirit of unbelief or confusion Lord or fear or doubt Lord we want to come into your presence and Lord uh as you told us many times to fear not to fear not and Lord we want to come in into that channel that you have for us bless every heart we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated as you're getting seated there just a little background we have been going through this message the stature of a perfect man and blasphemous names we have uh listened to it or the church family has been listening to it those that could and also um we took the message birth pains last week uh Sunday and kind of bringing those uh messages together that as God is building a church he's building a house he's building a man he's building a woman through the birth and he built Israel the nation through a series of births that birth these Patriarchs and built the house of Israel we see that God is now building individuals to be a stature in the stature of a perfect man so Jesus brought that requirement of perfection be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect so brother Branham takes this message in second Peter chapter 1 and takes those virtues Faith virtue knowledge Temperance all the way up patience godliness brotherly kindness and then the Capstone he brought that message he took takes that scripture and brings this image of a pyramid and we know that the pyramids or we believe this is how brother Adam said it many times we believe the pyramids were built by Enoch there's many pyramids built all over the world many of them have the cap on there but the Great Pyramid the Pyramid of gizer I believe it's called doesn't have a Capstone and there's a reason why that Capstone wasn't there brother Brandon brings it to us as the scripture tells us that The Headstone and the Cornerstone would be laid and that that headstone would be the capping of the pyramid and that um there would be a uh capping to our pyramid which is love or charity we call it and this love is our final goal our final destination as a Believer is to be sealed placed fully adopted Sons and Daughters of God Amen and so brother Ram brings this message these series of messages they're beautiful the stature of a perfect man actually preaches it in October of 62 a couple of months later in November of uh of of 62 a month few weeks really later not not a full month he preaches the message Blasphemous names and the Blasphemous names message comes from a dream that a sister had after hearing the stature of a perfect man she had a dream a year prior one place he said several months and later on he says it was a year later so she had a dream she sat on this dream for a year you know how you have things and sometimes you forget or whatever when brother Ram preaches statue of a perfect man it all comes back to her and then she sends this letter in to brother brandham about the interpretation of this dream and he opens it up and brings Blasphemous names and we're so thankful for it amen but this uh Matthew Chapter 5 I just want to go back a little bit hold your Bible just for a moment and in verse number 31 and let's just bring a portion of what Jes Jesus is saying as he kind of lays this pretty heavy standard that we should all be perfect and like not like the Pharisees are perfect not like brother and sister are perfect but as your father in Heaven is perfect you need to be perfect so look how he sets it up in verse number 31 it has been said whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement but I say unto you that whosoever should put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causeth her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorce committeth adultery again ye have heard that it has been said by them of old time Thou shalt not forwell thyself but shall perform unto the Lord thine oath but I say unto you swear not at all neither by heaven for it is God's Throne nor by the Earth for it is his foot stol neither by Jerusalem for it's a city of the great king neither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou can't not make one hair white or black but let your communication be yay yay NE nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil nice preaching isn't it you have heard that it has been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth I'm going to get him back he started it she hit me first I'mma hit her back she started it I'mma finish it you have heard that it been said eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you that ye resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if If any man will sue thee at law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also that's a amen Point Let's can I get a witness who said this who said this this is this going to change not going to change for me or nobody else this is God's word and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him Twain give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away you know I'm continueing I'm stopping at verse 43 you know when I we read these scriptures like this I always feel that that other side that breath of you know brother Israel you need to bring the balance on that you know bring the balance on that well you didn't even say Amen to the word that's before we bring any balance say Amen to what he said he asked for your Coke give him your cloak also well what we going bring to balance you know if they really do something you got to call we ain't talking about that say Amen to what Jesus said and that's that's a big part of the problem true there are exceptions to the rule and what we have done has made the exceptions the rules yes sir and that's when it's a problem there are exceptions even in marriage and divorce even in with a vow and some of these things they're exceptions but that doesn't take away from the original commandment leave them people out of court leave them alone stop trying to fight with people and try to win everything and when they hit you give them your other cheek and let them Smite the other one also very difficult to preach in our society today very difficult to get an amen out of that because we got some people that we actually want to hit back wow but this is what Jesus said look if we can't get through through 38 and 39 don't let me read verse 48 that we already read we're just on verse 38 and 39 he's about to climax it to be ye therefore perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect here the words of our Lord and if any man will sue the at law take away thy coat give him thy cloak also verse 41 whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him Twain give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away you have heard that it ha been said thou shall love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth reain on the just and on the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do more what do ye more than others do not even the publicans so be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect now we have uh LA on Wednesday we brought a message on who is this speaking about this great messenger that was to come or Christ in our age and that there would be a wave offering or a sheath offering or what we would call one of of us that came to maturity We're All Sons and Daughters of God we're all striving to be more like him Jesus went through this process of the adoption in Matthew 17 we see the example and here we have in our day one that reached this maturity and the Reverend William brandham that's his picture right there we're not ashamed of that his life proved who he was it's not for everybody we understand that we can't force people to to be something that they are not I can't make a lot into an Abraham or an Abraham into a sodomite can't do it Abraham is an Abraham God made him that from the beginning actually there's a quote where brother random says that that uh even you when you were a little boy or a little girl there was always something in you then that you knew you wanted to be a Christian that's right ain't that beautiful before you you even know anything about church or anything there's something within you that wanted to do what was right right wanted to be in the image of something greater than what you are right now and that's a beautiful thing because you can't really pinpoint when you were elected you can't but the Bible tells us that before the foundation of the world amen amen saints that I chose you before the foundation of the world I knew you and elected you to be a part and so trying to work that out it's very difficult to work it out you knew something was in you and God had brought you up to this and now you come across the word the word means more to you than perhaps other people that come across the same word and it's not our job to follow other followers God called us to follow the leader and the leader should be the Lord Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit leading and guiding the believer and in this process of coming to Christ and repenting of our sins we hear that there's a word of perfection this great message of the hour that we call it the message of Malachi 4 The Last Day message and the prophet brings it and preaches it and then he brings that Easter message about the first fruit the first one that come to maturity and shows us that that was a son that had been fully redeemed on this side of Calvary we know Jesus was the original son he was the original first fruit of them that slept he rose from the grave with all power he was the first first fruit but then in our age in our generation God got a hold of a man a sinner saved by grace Glory Hallelujah and we're coming that way too if we stay with it and brought him to a place where the denominations couldn't stop him his past and his healing condition and his awkward upbringing couldn't stop him that God got a hold of him and placed him a Ministry for the last day he had to fulfill that Ministry and he he preached the message one of the messages he preached was um uh marriage and divorce before he preached that message he preached the message a man running from the presence of the Lord and then that message he say you got to face your responsibility he said it it was a requirement that he had to he said that oh how he would love to just go fishing or hunting all the time oh how he would love to just go in the mountains with a cabin and be a Trapper for the rest of his life but he said woe unto me he said I got salvation just the same as anybody else in the church but he wasn't called to be a Trapper he was called to hold a two-edged sword and present a word to a group of people that would believe it amen so that's this message that we're in and that's what we are are moving ourselves into this um you know this and there there's there's something to it you say brother Israel why is it important to bring out who brother brandham was why is it important to show and and and I mean you're constantly putting the confidence of trying to put the confidence of the people into that Ministry why is that important well well get into it in a little bit the Lord willing that there is there is a rejecting of the stone and the stone that gets rejected was the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Jesus was rejected and in this age he was rejected again and the rejection that Jesus faced uh the rejection of Jesus in the last days is not the rejection of this picture right here head of Christ or the other pictures that that are made out there some nice ones of of our Lord Jesus that's not the rejection not the rejection of the Bible they're rejecting rejecting the word of their day okay now this Bible is true can I get a witness is it all thus sayeth the Lord so when I go back here and I read about Noah and Noah's Ark is that thus sayith the Lord but is that for this day no are we building an ark like that are we waiting for another flood to come no that was the word of the Lord but it's not the word of the Lord for now and we all have a lot in the scriptures in our life that God has allotted to us it might be 50 years it might be 60 you might be in your 90s you might I don't know how long you're going to but that's your allotted time to manifest that's what God called you to do that's your allotment and nobody can take your place and you can't take anybody else's place as much as you would love to see Moses face to face or Elijah or any of the prophets of the Old Testament as much as you wanted to be there on the day of Pentecost God didn't allot that for you that's right as much as you wanted to be here in the 60s and the 70s some if you were and be up and doing what they was doing God did not allot that for you what he allotted for you is what you're looking at right now all the craziness all the beauty all of the the technology all of the the things that we benefit from that's what he allotted to you and and um and that's what you're going to be held accountable for it's sobering it's very sobering so let's get into the message just for a little bit can I read some quotations for you now we know in the birth pains that was a beautiful message Sunday night that you all Listen to I listened to it too how many went back and heard the whole thing be honest one I love honest people two thank you only two when heard the whole thing so let let me say like this okay so when we take a tape like that we'll take a tape and and I'll I'll break it up I'll take off maybe the baby dedications in the beginning or testimonies and then I'll cut it off right before that last prayer because that was the scriptures that he was talking about for the message that he's bringing but oh there's so much more in that message the whole beginning of it is another identification how God called him and laid his life out and showed and Supernatural before he even gets to the scripture and so it's the same like when we read the Bible I get up here and read the scriptures I'm not going to read all the chapter or all of the context you should go back and read that for yourself and so that message to birth pains it's a good one to go back and hear and listen there's a prophecy that goes forth at the end there is a war warning a very Stern warning to those that heard the word okay so you get a chance go and hear that that birth pains again I won't say if you got time you got time take the time and go and hear that birth pains all right and so um we had been through that and going through the birth pains message and how um a prophet comes and causes those labor pains to come forth it's it's um what God does that's how he builds his church amen the church is built on the labor pain that's how that's how Israel was built that's how we are built that's how Believers are built those mothers were were in labor pains and they brought forth those boys and name them and brother bandam brings Ephesians chapter 4 that the church in the labor pain brings forth the gifts it brings forth pastors teachers evangelist that's where they come from how do you grow a preacher or how do you make a song leader you you you can train them or you go train them or or are they born under the baptism of the Holy Ghost under a call of God in their life that's how that's how a song leader is born that's how a gift is manifested that's how a preacher is made that's how teachers and and other gifted individuals their birth into the church it's not some educational uh formula to build a church God birs a piano player or organist if you need a deacon God will birth that from the church we don't need to go out here and hire somebody to be a deacon God's got a deacon where's it at that it's in the bows of his word in the body of Christ and they come forth amen amen exactly right and that comes forth through the labor pains and it they get intense you got to wait you have to pray and then things are built and things are are birthed and through this great this great birth pains God builds the church and he actually builds the individual I'm going to take a little bit of a message here and I'll start in this message a man running from the presence of the Lord the prophet of God says this here paragraph number 78 but it's so it's easy to go the way the world goes it's easy to flow down the stream go out there and sit down in the river with your boat you get out your ores and start pulling up against the current you don't make much time and it goes hard but you just once let the ores and watch how fast you pass the trees going down but look where you're going when things are floating easy remember you're going towards a great cataract down there of some sort you're going towards the falls and it won't be long you'll be going over that falls just floating with the World easy the way it goes you don't want that no sir but you must accept your responsibility sorry I'm I'm still there sis let me get it back here you must accept your responsibility he says praise the lord it's taking a while to cruise up there but I'll get it yes now you believe it and you think it's true and the responsibility that God has given us in this day to bring this message look let me stop here for a moment there is no other preacher no other minister had to say the things that this man had to say right he was pushed to say it he told him if you can get the people to believe you believe what believe that an angel came to you and sent you believe that you had a message to bring and you got to go out and say that publicly to doctors of the word people who went to Seminary educated men men that been preaching longer than you and you got to go out there and say that what a responsibility what a challenge that's not an easy order no it's not I mean it it's hard to preach with people that's on your side amen let alone preaching with people that frowning against you waiting for you to make a mistake trying to catch you off guard but I'm so glad he's hey man I'm so glad he wasn't like a wishy-washy out here he was not John he wasn't he wasn't blown by men's idea he wasn't blown get up and walk out say Amen no amen he still preached it amen I thank God for it don't you tenacity man goodness all right so but it's easy to go the way the world goes it's easy to flow down the stream um paragraph 80 and the responsibility that God has given us in this day to bring this message and as I get older and I know my days are shortening up I feel the responsibility responsibility greater than I ever felt pressing on we must do it we must get down to it in everywhere we go tell the message and tell the people that Jesus Christ is coming that he's God he's coming soon there's not a hope left in the world but the coming of the Lord amen amen amen amen the prophet brings in the message the SE is not air with the shook he says this here notice in paragraph 149 notice there will be no more carrier mother churches denominations after this carrier Shu because after the Shu there is no more nothing left by them but just the grain is that right it's got to be the grain it's got to be the same kind that went into the ground Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever a Spirit come upon the bride uh uh a Spirit come upon the bride to do the same things that he did see it's the reproducing again of the grain the word yet young spake for itself and know not that I must be about know not that I must be about my father's business huh there is the secret of the message now just exactly the father's business what is the father's business could you think of what the father's business was in him to fulfill what Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive fulfill what Isaiah said again the lame shall leap like a heart and all these things would take place like Moses said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet among you like it unto me it was the father's business to fulfill that word well if that come down through them stalks and them Natural Women what about these stalks of these Spiritual Church women churches means women women means churches rather is that right then what is it now we must be about the father business the wheat would cry back the grain yes sir what must it do vindicate Malachi 4 vindicate Luke 17:30 vindicate Hebrews 138 vindicate St John 14:12 vindicate all of his word vindicate Hebrews I mean Revelations the 10th chapter the opening of The Seven Seals and the mysteries of God even to serpent seed and all would be manifested marriage and divorce and all of these other Mysteries that's been hid under the pillars for all these years from the theologians and so forth but it's now the hour that's the father's business now are you about the father's business there you go what's the father's business building another church or getting more members what's what's her father's business out here see who feeds the most poor people or who can go out here and has the largest whatever what this was the father's business he just laid it out to us Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 marriage and divorce all of these tremendous truths is the father's business that's the father's business think they would receive it they want to be dignified and say our denomination don't teach us that but the Bible does all right let's take the message the Easter seal 1965 here what brother bamman says here just bringing up the age and showing us where we are that we have a lot and our allotment is very specific our allotment can't be found listening to a Baptist preacher are a lot is not going to be found online listening to organization or denomination and what they call important today the mega church Mania and all of the big big uh things that they're talking about that's not the father's business for us we have an allotment for the age yes sir and that allotment is in alignment with this ministry right here yes sir and it is a tremendous responsibility I tell you right now it requires your undivided attention it is a very serious calling very respectable and there is probably Millions would love to have the call of God in their life like you have in yours how many would love to be the elected chosen bride how many would love to see what your eyes have seen and it's a a great calling it's a beautiful place it's not a it's not a backwards position it's a it's a tremendous calling that we've been called to it's our allotment it's our place and God has given it to us to do the father's business amen Lord so as brother brandham couldn't call Reverend so and so to find out what's next neither can you call right Believers so and so to find out what's next sir don't work that way your instructions come from above amen somebody that comes from the Lord amen so here the prophet of God takes in the Easter seal and says this here now the paragraph 86 now the holy spirit is here on Earth looking out those individuals that God has ordained to life in this age and as as soon as it finds it it does just like it did on Jesus Christ the great superon of God who redeemed us all it comes down and takes its place and Abode into the human life now notice brought the quickening power now that quickening power that come upon Jesus quickened him to manifest every promise of the word of that day so does the Holy Spirit that come upon us in this day if it's not a mockery Holy Spirit you're not the devil mocking the Holy Spirit but it's real true Holy Spirit it'll manifest the promise of this hour when it fell upon Luther it manifested the promise of that hour when it fell upon Wesley it manifest the promise of that hour when it falls in this day it manifests the promise of this hour when it fell upon Moses it manifested the promise of that hour fell upon Noah it manifest the promise of that hour when it fell Upon Jesus it manifest the promise of that hour see it's the Holy Spirit coming down to Quicken make alive those people that's foreordained of God to be in the Rapture this is the true this is he is a true Eagle he will understand the message of the hour if he's a true Eagle now let the little Eagle probably brother mam continues on so we see that every hour had a word that that was anointed for their hour amen it doesn't even uh uh change for us it's uh we have a word for our day for our hour Lord sir amen can I go a little bit further sir does God change his mind about his word paragraph number 76 the message does God change his mind about his word 1965 and I love that answer no he does not paragraph 76 now we find always that when these natural and spiritual spirits of churches and organizations meet there is always a clash it's never failed to be so it always CL ases because we find that there is a jealousy and in this jealousy it causes carnal comparisons impersonations and we find it in today as it was then when God does something for an individual everybody tries to copy just like God did for that person see it causes a competition and it makes and it makes carnality and then if they cannot the other side side get the spiritual results then they take it by a political power or they substitute something to upset the people's minds to draw disciples after themselves sound like he know what he talking about sound like this maybe happen in his ministry I believe he knows exactly what he's talking about here he is nobody was doing it and then now he's doing it and then he talked about how everybody had a sign in the hand then and everybody had a Ministry and everybody had a discernment and everybody's a prophet now and everybody can say thus saith the Lord and but you know that's that's the way the carnal comparisons it's jealousy it's trying to be something that you saw God manifest in somebody else but we want to be what God made us don't we the prophet of God continues on in the message oh my trying to do God a service without it being his will paragraph 137 brother bandam says many sincere people join an organization or a group or a cult of some sort and there they die spiritually you can't tell them nothing they get that stuff drilled into them why these Bishops said this and this said this this that this you show them right here in the word of God where it's thus sayeth the Lord but our pastor I don't care what your pastor says don't care what I say or anybody else says if it's contrary to God's Vindicated word the hour the time the message and so forth forget it stay away from it and I've got to stand before every one of you in the day of judgment and you know that and little would I say that knowing I'm an old man now it ain't that I know something but but he knows I just follow what he said look today at the big Crusades that we've had across the land it's proven that it's been in vain and didn't Jesus say here Luke 7:7 in vain do they worship me in vain did David bring the Ark Ark up in vain did Ahab train them prophets in vain did balum take that money teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of man it's the Commandments of God that count no matter how then people are really sincere you hear that so much they're so sincere that don't mean nothing can I get a witness the Jehovah Witnesses Seven Day Adventist all those Cults get out here on the street and do things that one of us wouldn't do Catholics stand on the corner and beg and so forth those orders of it like that and worth billions times billions times billions of dollars still beg for it sincere no doubt churches go and preach and so forth and ministers stand in the pull pit and do everything they can to get new members into their church but it's a new arc there's only one Arc to follow that's the word of God anything contrary to that Arc stay away from it it's on a new cart and not on the shoulders of God right stay away from the thing don't have nothing to do with it now God has provided an original way to do things and he'll never do contrary to that can you say amen amen now he promised in the last days that what he would do and he sent them us the message and it sent them us the message and this message would have the same identification as Elijah had as Elisha had as John the Baptist had and it would turn the hearts of the people not to denomination but back to the original Apostolic fathers back to the word how these things have been Vindicated how that in the sounding of this last Angel Revelations 10 in the last days of the seventh angel these Mysteries that's all why did the Methodist do this and the Baptists and the Church of Christ and the Jehovah Witness all do that the Mysteries will be revealed in the last days when the seventh Angels message when he not when he starts out doing this but when he begins to sound his message see not the years in preparation but when he begins to sound the message these Mysteries then will be revealed and here they are not knowing them and you people are witnesses of that amen praise the Lord so we see that you know as God built his the natural church and coming up through those first Age and and the the first age under the Apostle Paul and then justification sanctify and building it up and we see that God builds the individual that same way so these patterns they don't change uh what God sent in this day was for this day it doesn't take away from the day that have gone by but it just added to that gave us what it was all about what yesterday was about why was that that way why did it go that way and the messenger brings that out to us here in this day amen and so we have full confidence in that yes sir we rest in that message that's the word that that that God has built up in us and as he builds this ministry through the life of brother brandham his ministry of going out preaching this one rejects him this one has him things open up he didn't know what this meant and the Lord reveals it we can almost see ourselves in him oh yes we see our growth taking place as he grew to know who he was and the importantance of what his ministry was to that age couldn't replace them it was a specific Ministry it was all through the Bible and we should be able to see ourselves in the Bible too because if we can see that then that pattern doesn't stop behold I send you Elijah he'll preach a message to call out a bride well what's a bride what's a bride look like the people that's following this that's the bride amen so we see our identification in finding out who the messenger jur is then we can find out who we are finding his place finding what God did in his life we can see what God is going to do in other redeemed sons of God's lives brought him to Perfection brought him and adopted him made him gave him the checkbook and it was a type showing what he would do in the rest of the Bride coming up amen we could preach it with this Authority even though we wasn't there many of us were not there in the meetings but we came across this word didn't we and now this word has moved us into this position of knowing who we are as individuals so as we take uh our our place in um this pyramid this stature of a perfect man as we find begin to find our place in there as we go grow closer to the top then sin becomes more brilliant it becomes more outstanding the little things we used to get by with now it it it's it becomes a big thing and where we used to be able to argue and fuss with people now as we mature it's not about winning the argument no more amen it's not about saying see I was right it ain't about that it's about trying to be one with my heavenly father to be perfect as he was perfect so it shifts from that Backyard Brawl with the other church members your quote against my quote and I saw it first and I was here first no no no no no no um we move from that now yeah now I'm in my prayer closet all right with the word of God in my face and I'm on my knees trying to let God become one with me that I can be one with his word amen it individualizes it puts us back on our knees back to the altar back to crying out for God seal me Place me Forgive Me Make Me Over Again Build Me Up again amen puts us back on the potter's wheel that's right we thought we made it for a little while we thought we were the cream of the crop arguing with people chest stuck out proud prideful but you kept hearing the word didn't you and you kept hearing the message and what did it do it put you back to the altar amen and that's what many of us need to get back to Sir back back to the Bible back to the message back to Lord Make Me Over back to Lord I don't even know I know nothing without you lord please make me into a son see you've been in it for 40 years Lord make me a son been in all your life Lord make me a son amen I can't make myself amen yes sir amen so this pyramid becomes a part of our life amen sir it's not just just a message that brother brandham preached it's now a part of our life can I prepare to close this message here prepare to close thank you and as we look at this statue of a perfect man and we know that it's for the believer we know the prophet preached it um there's something he says in the message about these stones and pyramids in one place he calls those virtues he calls them stones and I want to pick that up in stature of a perfect man paragraph 407 quickly this is when I get in trouble with the girls in the back there because I wish I could stay on one line all right this is at the end of the message statue of a perfect man and look at this admonition that brother brandom gives us now in paragraph 405 he says lust for money lust for big things Lust For popularity these things are dead to the believer we don't care a tent or Cottage why should I care care live or die sink or drown this is the thing I'm interested in the kingdom of God whether I maintain my house whether I maintain my family whether I maintain whatever it is let me maintain Christ Our Hope Of Glory Build Me Up Oh Lord into this let Christ be my head that working through me on my Foundation my faith that's in him let virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness work in me oh lord is my prayer I don't care live or die sink or drown denomination or no denomination friend or no friend let that work in me let Christ virtue his knowledge flow out that I might be able to teach those for God has set in the church apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists all for the perfecting and bringing all these virtues into it for the Perfection of the coming of the Son of God each one of these stones are a material off of that one all right this is material of this each one of these virtues belong into him and they're pouring out out of him down through them amen now that's a cry of a real son you hear brother vos's cry no family no denomination denom sink or drown no matter what let me have this yes and these stones and we know that stones are Revelation and we know that those birth have to take place in The Believer and so look what the prophet of God says in the Statue of a perfect man under knowledge just quickly and it's paragraph 182 and I love this because it's you know the building of a man the building of a church and the building of a people ready for the Rapture is not an overnight thing it's on God's timetable and you're not going to go in and Rush anything that's good that's right you're not going to make God do anything or Force this or I must have my way I must have the the best church or I must be the the best preacher or have the best voice to sing I must be the best whatever it is not if you're a son he's building you and he's making you with real material this material you can't get at the drugstore you can't get it at no Church you can't bribe your way into it you can't snot and pouch your way into it God's got to birth it into you and this is how he build he built the churches throughout all the ages this way a lot of people gave their life for us to get this Bible sacrificed their blood gave their time they sacrificed and gave and it built up through the reformation and Luther wrote his thesis and people lost their lives you know there's people that did exactly what Luther did and they died but Luther survived because there was a there was an allotment in life that Luther had to live out and God placed him there and that where he built that church and built the church ages and built us to the place he builds the individual and look at this on knowledge how brother brandom says here paragraph 180 the word is the revelation of Jesus Christ the Bible said so Christ being revealed in his own word and if he has watched over you when you transgress these laws he condemns you for it how much more has he watched over his law that condemns you that's right amen go on boy don't tell me that stuff I believe in genuine Holy Ghost knowledge Holy Ghost knowledge will always punctuate the word with an amen when you get these things that seem to contradict themselves in the Bible you sat down and what you do study oh my pastor do all the studying for me you know yes sir this instant answer this instant you know know it all uhuh right you I ask you how many whatever whatever and you guys you'll blot out the answer like you just got it like that D you got it because you looked on Google you got it because you searched it up real quick it didn't come from within you didn't labor to get it you just typed faster than everybody else you ask Google y'all ain't saying nothing but it's true it's a quick cheap answer it's the right answer but did it develop any character but when you come across something in your life and it's a problem and you don't have the real answer and then you got to go to the prayer meeting looking for an answer then you go into the scriptures looking for an answer and then you go down on your knees and then you'll counsel and then you'll pray and then you wait and then when God reveals it to you it sticks because the cost and the price and the time it took for that to go for you to overcome that it it really builds into you it makes you one with the answer you now become one with the answer instead of it coming from some outside Source you blurted it out because that was the right answer it didn't come from within have you ever heard someone sing a song that you can tell they're one with that song you ever see that you can say man he she is singing her testimony right now and then you have people who sing a song the song is there they're here and they're sing like this but when that song becomes inside of you and then you sing Glory it becomes your song and when the amens come from within amen and so this knowledge he says you take you find a contradiction when you get these things that seem to contradict themselves in the Bible you sit down you study it and prayerfully like that and the first thing you know the Holy Spirit begins to move in after a while you see it ties together and there you got it that's knowledge we're not talking about the knowledge where you punch it and got an answer now you can argue with me we're talking about the knowledge that was revealed and birthed into you then you get the answer you can see because these quotes we call them eagle feather quotes and we try to stick them into a buzzard nature stick that quote in there stick that feather in there why why you doing that well the brother just preached on it so I got to be happy why you raising up brother just preached don't raise your hand say just ra man you're not even raising your hand from with in you raising your hand because you sticking that feather Hallelujah there's a bigger problem then you raising your hand you need something to happen in your heart then your hand will go up and your praise will come from the inside of you amen glory amen hallelujah brother Brandon brings that illustration many times now watch this Buzzard trying to put peacock feathers in but you want to become one with this word so this knowledge under the knowledge I'm just going to take that one for a moment he he takes this to Ephesians chapter 5 and he says this here I'm sorry under godliness he he he he under godliness he reads Matthew chap chapter 5 in Ephesians chapter 4 which is our message here this morning on this Perfection perfection in paragraph 304 and the statue of a perfect man here what the prophet of God says here all right I'm winding down honestly I am prar pre preparing brother George says sounds like another preacher trying to give another preacher the abuse of power abuse the time all right paragraph 304 in the message statue of a perfect man he's talking about godliness and he said let's turn to Ephesians 4 and find out over here what the a book of Ephesians it says about these this thing too about how we should do Ephesians the 4th chapter and begin with the 12th verse he gave some Apostles and some prophets remember last night don't try to take the other man's office see some evangelist some pastors some teachers for the perfecting of God does it read like that congregation says no the Perfection of what Saints who are the Saints to sanctify ones amen the one started from down here perfect takes godliness you have to add to your faith godliness see you start off down here with virtue then you go to knowledge then you go to Temperance you go to patience now you're on godliness godliness oh my our time is getting away and um it brings that godliness brings that godliness there and now let's get into something here now this a lot allotment this allotted time is the allotment that God has given to each of us we're here today by his order by his command it was his desire to have us here today in in in the message statue of a perfect man par paragraph 340 brother brandham says this here the way that God is expecting us as an individual ual to grow the way he has brought his church in to grow every Church age it becomes one big church see these fellows wasn't required what these fellows are yes this wasn't require what this was see but he brought his church up the same way he brought his church up the same way he's bringing his people up then Peter says here first seven things Faith virtue see come up knowledge Temperance patience godliness Brotherly Love brotherly kindness and then the love of God the Holy Ghost Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you got all these virtues sealed in you then God lives in a tabernacle called the building so we see that there is a growth that is taking place with this message and that there is a age requirement and our age requirement is different than the age that gone on before us amen so what is our age requirement our age requirement is coming to Perfection so brother bam takes the dollar bill and he said that you know why did they make that the Great Seal they have the the the the pyramid there with the eye on top and then it's got the coat of arms on the other side it's number 13 through all of that that pyramid has 13 steps all the way up talking about the 13 colonies and the the the eagle has 13 arrows in his Talons and brother Brandon brings that out that that even their money is testifying that this great nation that God is King Lord over all of it now the the great founding fathers Samuel Adams Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were the the designers of this the dollar bill and all of the writings on there you had it took them three years or I think it was six years in the making of the pattern of the dollar bill and you think of them coming over here for a religious freedom not not all of them but you know Freedom means things different to different people obviously they're trying to escape from under the church lordship and be able to worship freely but they're coming over here taking folks stuff too they dealt with the natives a certain way and then they had slaves and they brought the slaves over and so we understand that you know they didn't have the true uh they would have come to that freedom under the word of the Lord through the baptism of the Holy Ghost but that initial initial Quest For Freedom that was all God they put on their their money in God we trust right on the dollar there and they didn't know why they they didn't have a revelation of second Peter 1 they didn't know why they put the eye up there the allseen eye they didn't know why they had a pyramid as our Great Seal as the Great Seal of this country but God was inspiring and leading them and so now when the country has turned against it they now laughing at us we still their money is testifying against them as brother Banner brought he says that that that that their money their own money testifies against them and he brings it into this message as to why that pyramid was never CA now the capping of these Stones if I could just bring this last part here the capping of these Stones is the capping of the individual and the individual now is moving where God put this pyramid structure together without using any mortar there's no mortar between them and for the next five minutes I'll just read some of those quotes on that how this these great tremendous stones are so perfectly placed in this pyramid because there there was no man-made mortar to hold it together but what holds it together our pyramid is the Holy Spirit and this is the this is the part of our life that we want to pray for the Lord to remove is the leaven is the mortar yes is the fine frictions that is still uh Waring in our members today that we War within ourselves and when that is not uh answered or dealt with then we go out and start flexing against other people it carries in our home it carries on our job it carries in church it carries in any position of service carries in any walk every individual has these wars within themselves and this is why they war with one another and the answer to that is this great message of receiving the full placing as a son where you move into Perfection because that's the age requirement can I take my time and bring that last part this is what God has to do now we we can we can argue your point you know Perfection I'll never be perfect in your sight you will never be perfect in my sight but we're not looking for that Perfection the Perfection we're trying to find is the perfection in God's sight which is his word all right all right Saints uh be ye therefore perfect don't you want to be perfect now and have I not sent thee 1962 brother bam says this here paragraph 93 Why didn't that they never put a cap on that stone I've been there at the pyramid why didn't they put a cap on it because it was rejected that was the Cornerstone where all the other Stones was fit together I was speaking of the church age look way down here at the Lutheran age way back in the majority back there just to confess Christ was my just means to be a Christian justification All Along come Wesley sanctification little narrower sanctification then Along come to Pentecost baptism of the Holy Ghost what is it shaping up justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost now what's he doing that's got to be honed out so perfect that the church brought into such a place that the stone that's coming to fit on top of it see what I mean that pictures the church and through it it all is the church now that's just that's making a parable I'm talking about don't try to go into it then the next Bible he's talking about the the three Bibles the Bible this is our word just them signs and things they had back there but notice how perfect that stone it was rejected they never put it on why and you go there them stones in that pyramid that weighs thousands of tons that is so closely fit together you can't put a razor blade and no mortar in it so perfectly hone together then if that had to be like that to make each age fit together then what's it going to be when the coming don't you see the church shaping up Luther justification Wesley sanctification then come the Holy Ghost and now Church getting honed and fixed then without a spot or a wrinkle so him that had no spot or wrinkle could come down and connect it together for the resurrection take that again he says don't you see the church shaping up Luther justification Wesley sanctification then come to the Holy Ghost and now Church getting honed and fixed then without spot or wrinkle so him that had no spot or wrinkle can come down and connect it to together for the resurrection for the Church of the Living God to take his flight into Glory yes see yes now we're living in that day now John was looking for that to come he said I'll know him he's out there I don't know where he is he's standing out there maybe some bishop and brother Ram continues on so he's bringing to us that the church now has to be honed for this great um the one without spot or wrinkle and we too are to be without spot or wrinkle and that those spots those wrinkles is what we're talking about this morning it's the mortar is what we're talking about this morning it's the it's the loose places is what we're talking about this morning because the church has to be honed for the Rapture and that's the importance of this message a statue of a perfect man Blasphemous names receiving the Holy Ghost being sealed and plac let me take one more for you in the message Blasphemous names he says this here paragraph 72 Enoch completed it in his day or back in that day the pyramid and of course we haven't got time to back around and show how that that pyramid come up through the chambers and so forth it speaks right straight to the end time now they're in the king's chamber now by the measurement but the headstone never was put on the pyramid and that sets perfect architecturally or masonry until even the little thin razor blade that don't know how they ever don't know how they ever built it don't understand it could e could ever a razor blade slice along the sides where that mortar should be and there's no mortar in it it's just perfected put together so that's what it is when Christ and the church becomes one there's no mortar between there's nothing between just God and the person God Christ and the person now but the headstone they never found it you know the stone of scone having English so brother B continues on so you see the no mortar you see what we're talking about this morning uh do you understand what we're talking about this morning that's the question the no mortar the that it's you Christ and God sealing that individual with these precious virtues I don't know how how loud to scream it out to myself I don't know how loud to preach it to this church but that is what is going to take place for the Rapture that's where we are we're flexing against little carnal things and people even people I mean people even in my own me looking at me I'm flexing against people against carnal stuff and what is come in our day oh my goodness so Saints you know I I don't I'm not going to be guilty so it's not you know like the the fat man up here trying to tell you how to eat right you know Lord the the divorced marriage counselor all right so you know I'm in the mirror too right I'm in the mirror I'm in the mirror but this is this is where we're at this is our allotment we have no other age to compare it to even 50 years ago let me say this even 50 years ago or 40 years ago or let's say even 30 years ago whoever preached or handled the message of the hour like we are doing today who had all the message in a type format where you can pull all the quotes what what generation had that it's a different time the message didn't change but who who handles what preachers handled a message like we handle it today what other age had that had could afford that who had that ability why this is our allotment and this is what we're going to be held accountable to and the days of following other groups and other people them days is over days of you know the group because so and so said that's over yes the days of mortar little things that you know that's not right and just thinking it's okay those days should be over and now it's Christ and God and the person being united with no mortar in it if that means I got to go by myself or you have to walk by yourself then that's what it means if that means a cry or prayer or a life before God like never before that's exactly what it means and that's my little encouragement to you today amen amen amen no mortar between us I have a level I'll take one more okay turn on the light 1964 paragraph 109 so ought the Church of Pentecost today asking who is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever his light of his gospel ought to be shining forth with the word of this age revealing Jesus Christ to the nation just like it was then he was so filled with the Welsh Revival till he was the Welsh Revival we ought to be so filled with Christ till we reflect him in the power of His word that's lotted to us to this day Brethren don't be stooped in the things of the world don't these cares that takes you away stay with the gospel watch every word don't go back to what some father said let's go right now what Jesus said was to take place in this day yes sir we are supposed to be the light of this age manifest in the gospel Luther was his light Wesley was his light Pentecost was his light but we're farther up the road now we're coming into the bride called out the elected remember if you are you're just like that officer we had it in him he had it in him remember remember this is the seventh Church age the leoan church age according to Revelations 3 they reject Christ of every Church age that was mentioned in the Bible the Leo deia age was the worst of all of them turned him out rejected him put him on the outside do you see and brother bam continues on we see the age that we're living in and that's the age that God has called us to this is um the age where we have been lauded to come into the statue of a perfect man be ye therefore perfect even as my father father in Heaven is perfect so we have to be perfect so we've been lotted this great message for this a for this age and for this hour and there is no other group or church that we're looking to for an example uh the message is our example and the token message was preached and it had to be put on display and brother brandom said I have to read this last quote in the Statue of a perfect man I feel like the church in Phoenix is telling me to keep going the church in tant getting a little hungry for lunch maybe but but here in in the Statue of a perfect man I want you to to take this last one here and he says this here all right yes sir paragraph 4:13 he's come to the end of the message there we read The Pledge last week I'll pledge to the Lord I'll pledge that I'll seek these virtues until God calls me home but here he says in po paragraph 4:13 says see it's true don't let it Escape you hold on to it children hold on to that remember build upon your faith virtue knowledge patience now here I think I had a piece of paper here if I haven't dropped it somewhere where when I was preaching right here it is thank you brother thank you very much if you want to look on it and see if there's something here that you might be able maybe it's a little better pattern that that is there that you might be able to copy some of this off I'll just tack it up here and you can sure look at it and type it off and I want you to take it and study it and compare it and then act upon it don't just study it compare it but act upon it when you do take it sincerely to yourself don't say well I enjoy listening at it I did too but listen at it and then receiving it is different see see it's different see there's seven qualifications to make the stature of God there's servant seven Church ages that God has brought the church to this qualification he's had seven Messengers to do it there's 777 7 is God's number of completion three is God's Perfection number so there's three and 7 threes so mathematically spiritually by the word by the witness of the Holy Ghost all of it has completed the thing together let's study it now who said that Prophet did he said don't let don't forget about it and he say well he said brother Israel should I study it well the prophet said study it he said the ministers only that's not what he said that's right no no you take it home you compare it you study you get your own book don't come to church and depending on the Bible that's on that screen to be your Bible you bring your own Bible you get your own notes out and you study it and then compare it and then he said to act upon it that's our job that's what we're doing God bless you so much I kept my kept my promise there yes I did so God bless you amen I trust the Lord will bless your heart let us pray Father in heaven we thank you for your word this morning Lord this no mortar between us that we would become one with you Lord which is your word I pray oh God that that a man-made manufactured oh God uh a prescription would just produce all kind of impersonations it would be carnal it would
