you may be seated we are definitely grateful to the Lord for this wonderful time to be here and to stand before uh the people of God the bride of Christ uh all the time I say this is the most respected place you know uh on the earth I mean uh the pulpit um and whenever we stand here uh it is an opportunity to bring you know uh Award of encouragement award that will comfor you know award that will help somebody because the reason why we are here is because uh we are needy people because if you were self-sufficient maybe you will just stay home and say Lord we got everything that we need but we are here is a sign that we still need more of God and mostly these days with everything that is going on uh nobody can deny that we don't need God we need him you know if there will be a way even to have a service every day that would be good because this is the right time to do so so um I'm really grateful uh to brother Israel for this time and this confidence and this opportunity that he gave us today and I'm grateful to the church you know uh thank you for all your support you know uh I got married this year and you've supported me you know uh spiritually you've been praying for me and oh my I was just really impressed you know by the love that you showed me and you know brother Israel was there and that was really good and uh may God bless you all amen so um even over there we went ahead and uh I was preaching after my marriage I was preaching in different churches uh I was not just sitting around in enjoying marriage but uh I took my time and went ahead started to pray I preached in three churches and by the Lord's Grace um I was able to uh to gain nine souls to the Lord like newly Souls that were not in the message they decided to receive the Lord and uh uh that was wonderful that's uh the only time when I'm proud of myself you know when I see that I can bring someone to Christ that the mo that the only thing that I would like to do every day you know uh that What Makes me proud amen and that what is my heart you know I want to serve the Lord go all over the world and preach the gospel and you know testify about the message and see if someone else can be saved amen because the message is too good to us and it will be good to share the message with somebody else amen so uh keep praying for for me and pray for us uh because we still have energy to serve the Lord amen so um we're going to stand and read a portion of the of the scripture here we going to turn in uh First Kings First Kings chapter 18 verse 16 uh to 21 the Bible says here soia went to meet Ahab and told him and Ahab went to meet Elijah and he came to pass when Ahab saw Elijah that Ahab said unto him our are thou he that trouble Israel and he answered I have not troubled Israel but thou and thy father's house in that ye have forsaken the Commandment of the Lord and thou H has followed Bing now therefore send and gather to me all Israel unto Mount carel and the prophet of bell 450 and the prophet of groves 400 which eat at Jezebel's at Jezebel's table so Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel and gathered the prophet together unto Mount Carmel and Elijah came unto all the people and said how long heart you between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him but if B then follow him and the people answered him not a word let jum to verse 24 he said and call ye on the name of yours God and I will call on the name of the Lord and the god that anth by fire let him be God all the people answered and said it is well spoken let's pray Heavenly Father we just so grateful again for this time lord we just expecting to get more from you father because this is the best way that you use to speak to your people so bless Lord everything bless the service from the beginning to the end father and we hope that by the time we'll be going home we're going to go with a testimony and say indeed the Lord has spoken to us we pray and we believe in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated so this is the parts uh this is one of my favorite stories in the Bible because it shows me the power of God and it testifies about the power of God and from this story we see a man who has overcome fear a man who's not afraid of anything because in the Bible at this time Elijah has decided to stop rain from Israel and he said as the is the Lord God of Israel liveth he was just telling the king and the King back then can be compared to what we call president today and Elijah never sh or never trembled before the king he was before the king because he was seeing what was going on in the city the corruption and everything he did not just take the time and maybe go uh to a television start to criticize or maybe uh he start to tell people hey this I'm not happy about this but he went before the king before the the the the president of that time and he told him as the Lord God of Israel leaveth before whom I stand there will not not be due nor Reign all these years not said that said the Lord but he said according to my word I'm the one who decides that you shall NE not get train nor do for all these years and it came to pass 3 years and a half there was no rign there was no do that was according to the will of a servant of God Elijah amen and then the spirit of the of the Lord told him now it's time for you to go and meet uh Ahab he went and met Ahab so he didn't even need to book an appointment he had just to show up because he knew that he was really important than Ahab the king and when he came before Ahab the king told him so you're the one who's bringing trouble in Israel you know in Elijah I just like you know his attitude he didn't have a lot of things to explain like can you see I do apologize you see he knew on what he was standing on and he was like no I'm not you are the one in your father's house you have forsaken the Lord's commandments and you went after B so you are the one bringing trouble in Israel who's this man who's this man how how courageous he is and back then they have laws like you have to respect the authorities you have to respect the king you have to obey whatever the king is saying but not Elijah because Elijah could not submit himself to the corruption that was going on he had a word to speak he had something to say and then he said now it is a good time let's just do a a show let do a show bring all your Prophets The Prophet of ba bring them put them together and then we're going to see who is the who has the real God let the god that will answer by fire let him be God because when you have God first of all you can't be afraid to prove what you got because we have power that what Paul you know uh told to Thessalonians he told them our gospel came not to you only in words but in power and in the Holy Ghost amen so the gospel is not just about talking talking by words only but that gospel has to be backed up by a power are we together and when you have that power you don't hide you don't hide yourself because when you have power you have to prove it that I have power and here's what uh Elijah did here he said bring them prophets we're going to see who's doing the right worship we're going to see who has the the true God so he was not afraid at all and he gathered 450 prophets against one man are we together because our God is not he's not a god of multitude he just need one person who is Sincere he just need somebody who can recognize who he is and then use that person God will not wait for the entire Tu to get Revelation no if you got the revelation God will use you to bring the light to toon if you are a righteous God will use you to preach the word in ton and bring the light are we together and Elijah was here he gaed them all he put them together and he said now let's bring two ballocks this is a demonstration brother and you cannot do something like this if you don't know where you stand where you're standing at on what you're standing on you cannot do something like this if you still playing you know Church you know you don't know if you are a Believer or not you don't know if you have the Holy Ghost or not this is not for you cuz if you do this if you try to bring this kind of challenge oh my the devil you're going to be a good lunch for the devil this only for the people who knows where they are standing at are we together let me read something in a message God's way that's been made for us that he preached uh September 1952 the date it says 0 0 paragraph 9 the prophet of God says after through the services of this week trying to show people that there is no need of being scared here is what he says the worst the worst thing the devil can put upon you is fear this is the worst thing the worse is fear if if you ever had a Cancer and didn't fear and believe God will heal you you wouldn't be in too bad a shape God take care of that if you are sick whatever it is if you didn't fear so fear oh my the prophet keep you know he keeps repeating this word fear is the worth things that Satan can place upon the person because when you're scared you're going to forget about the power that was vested in you on Calvary when you have fear you can do nothing at all and as long as you still you still scared as long as you still full and filled up with fear God will have a hard time to use you amen because God cannot use you when you have fear God need people who are fearless people who have you know this attitude like Elijah's people who can stand before anyone and tell the truth of the Gospel are we together here's what the prophet of God says in the message you know of spiritual Amnesia in the message spiritual amnia that he preached uh on November no April 11th 1964 paragraph 146 I love this when I'm reading this I have to smile CU this is really really good he says they think he's talking about nowadays Christians he says they think just because I belong to church that's all is necessary and then he says do you have that he says oh brother that means no more to God than to be a Manson or anything else any other Lodge like for people are pressing themselves I come to church all the time I come to church the prophet God says that means nothing to God he says to belong to church that don't mean nothing to God he said you've got you've got to be Sons and Daughters of God that a condition belonging to church doesn't mean nothing but you have to be Sons and Daughters of God are we together he says you've got to be born of God see now we have the first category of people we all in church that's good but now we're going to call the second group of people Sons and Daughters of God God and then now we're going to call people who are born of God and that why we have three kind of Believers in the church when you all come together oh we're happy that was a nice service that was a good a a very nice service but are you born again are you born of God do you have the spirit of God because belonging to church it doesn't mean nothing we should be proud when we have the Holy Ghost I'm born again be proud of yourself cuz you are born again you can do wonders you can do a lot of things but I belong to church that a nth grade before God he says uh you have to be born of God and God is the word when I become part of of my father I become all my father when you become part of God you become God can you complete in full not a part of God not a portion of God but you become God in full this is nice so this this should be a Congregation of God in full are we together so when God is in full there is a certain power that goes with it it's not by words only because God you know the reason why the devil is scared uh is scared is scared of God it's because he knows his power am because there is no respect if you have no power are we together some country some countries fear other countries not because they want to but because they know they have some ammunitions that we don't have they have some some of the armors that we don't have so we are obligated to respect them it's by obligation because if I mess up if I make them m God they will come with their F35 F16 and our country will be gone are we together and there is no respect without power because the devil you you see the way he's messing up he has some kind of power but the power of God is above his power and that why he's always submitted to God are we together so the prophet of God says when we have the spirit of God we we are born of God we are God in full so the devil the same way is scared of our God he should be scared of us the same way am are we together but first of all we have to be born of God we have to be born of God so the question will be what's going on now why we don't see this things that happen in the Bible happening in our lives because I I I love my prophet he preached everything he said everything one time he went to India and when he was there he saw a group of people he said there was a multitude of people 17 confessions you know United together they were talking against God Muslims were there you know Buddha followers were were were there you know a lot of people Hindus were there and the prophet said the I heard something telling me if you don't say anything thing to defend Christ you know I will be a coward and the prophet of God stood up and that at that time they came you know a a blind man who was born blind and the prophet said now this is a good time to do another demonstration they were all against God they were cursing the name of Jesus they were cursing God but I like what the prophet of God did here he did not debate with them no he did not take his Bible and say hey stop what you're saying read here in John read here in uh in Corinthians that was not the time because for all that group of people to respect him or to know that he's in the truth he had to show them some power are we together and that's where a lot of us we are failing today we're just bringing people to believe by force and some of us have fear so we make people to fear like hey you going to go to hell see the way you are dressing you're not supposed to do this you going to go to hell then we put some kind of fear in their hearts and they come to our church they join us not because they were convinced not because they saw something Supernatural but because we made them Afraid come to our church you going to be saved are we together but the prophet of God was showing the power he brought that blind man and he said if you have a true God then God who will answer by fire let him be God today and he promised him for the first time the prophet of God told him if your God give back to this man his sight I will be baptized into your religion are we together and they were all there that was a challenge let me tell you Brothers you cannot serve god without challenging people and you cannot challenge people if you don't have power it's going to be a shame came for you to serve God you have to put a challenge if you have if you are born of God if you have the Holy Ghost you have to put a challenge but today the message some of the Believers they became even very very mean the way they are preaching they are preaching in the mean way condemning people condemning people but if them people people can see some Supernatural things happening in your life they will have to follow you if at work you show them some power of God they will follow you you're not going to need even to preach them but as there is no power there is nothing at all so the only weapon that we have is to make them afraid oh you're going to go to hell oh you're going to go to hell you're going to go to to hell you're going to go to hell the prophet of God in India did not tell them that if he told them if your God is real give back you know to this man his sight and if my God is real I will also pray for him we need s you know this kind of challenge this kind of challenges are the ones that we need oh they are wrong no we are right they are wrong we are right they are wrong if we are right where are Miracles yeah if we are right we are wonders let's leave them alone they are wrong let let's now focus on ourselves and see what's going on with our right side are we together so instead of claiming the power and showing the power a lot of Believers are becoming what judges judges you're just seeing the church trying to find something that's wrong that's wrong you know just you just waiting for something that way you'll see a lot of Believers nowadays they are very quick like to to decide if they're going to stay home oh I saw in that church doing this I don't think that's right I will never go back there well we we can just tell the spirits that is behind that because if you have love you can know how to correct the wrong thing that you saw but you cannot correct cuz you have no love and you think that you have love oh I'm going to just stay home I can't go back there are we together and you develop those funny feelings against brothers because you couldn't correct them and you didn't correct them cuz you to begin with you're not a Believer brother said that's hard yeah if you were a Believer you would have have corrected the wrong thing that you saw and stay with the brothers because nowhere in the message the prophet of God said when you saw something wrong leave the church no there is no quat that says so when you see something wrong leave the church no pray for them pray for them and for you to pray for somebody you need to love that person first you cannot pray for somebody that you don't love before praying love has to be there are we together maybe this is hard I don't know the Lord but it's the word of God Amen so the prophet of God he explain us why we don't see this power today and I know that someone is curious to know why we don't see that today as if the gospel that we received is in words no it was not inwards only we see what the prophet God has done wonders Miracles he preached and there's some wonders big Miracles that happened we together so you want to know why we don't see that today who is curious to know oh okay so we can read this in the message as the eagle STS her nest that he preached January 22nd 19 61 he says and that's and that's what's the matter with the church today that's what the matter with the church today it's need a goodness Turing to get some of the loose feathers out of it out of its wings packing a chip on your shoulders and gages and things like that you will die in the flight how can God ever have a church with signs and wonders and miracles when you are fussing one another I'm this I'm that and grud grudges oh my God if the prophet say this it means some people they have grudges Lord and the prop says gud gudes like in the plural form says Gres and everything f up till the Holy Ghost come down like a rushing wind find all the differences in denominationalism all the little old loose feathers I'm this I'm that you are nothing that you ought to be what the scripture said find out all the loose feeds get them all tightened up because she's going to take them on a real ride pretty soon a solo oh my that solo flight the first one then she finds all the feathers out and the nest just boils like that the loose feathers are flying everywhere get all the fils flying out so they get good tight ones in here in there and she examines them over and see if they are ready that's what God trying to do to his church now just can't get her ready them fethers just keep getting lose the prophet says he can't get her church ready because them feathers your grudges your funny feelings keep coming all the time and then you wonder why the Rapture is not happening you the one you are the cause because of your grudges evil feelings all the time you're not happy you don't like people God cannot get his church ready because of your feathers your loose feathers such Court have very very few amen he says you need some more spiritual vitamins to tighten to tighten up some Eagle vitamins and that's the word tighten up them feathers are we together that's what matters with the church today people they have all kind of loose feathers in the church and when it's hard to demonstrate the power of God when you have these loose feathers you cannot even demonstrate the power of God you will just belong to the church but not contributing to that church you will just be called one of them but you're not doing nothing to the group because you have loose feathers can I add one more the prophet of God when he gave back sight to that man in India all of them confession they were baptized are we together and here's why he says in the message thirsting for life that he preached um June 13th uh 1959 he says Don't Be Afraid Don't Be Afraid our God is God paragraph 35 our God is God if he ever was God he's God yet and if he's God at all he's God of the whole creation and so when saying that then said uh they won't say nothing and I can't but God has showed that he uh that this will be now we'll see if it happens and they bow their heads uh this was right there in India and when we prayed the Man's eyes come open could see as good as any person here oh I said how many of you will receive Jesus Christ as your personal savior if this man's eyes come open and just as far as you could see tens of thousand of hands up in the air and then here is another problem with no cooperation amongst the churches perhaps tonight 99 out of every th out of every thousand is back in the temples of Buddha and so forth why because of the lack of cooperation of men to get there and Lead those people on into the churches listen this it's a Pity that there is no cooperation among Christian people today when God tries to do something that's the hardest thing I found and the most misunderstanding thing that people will not cooperate because you are uh you are not of their denomination he says it's a disgrace to the world Christians don't cooperate instead of cooperating they are fighting each other message believers they don't cooperate instead of cooperating they're just arguing over Cotes oh I think that's called no that's before 1966 63 oh no that's when when is that what is the year of that quote after reading a quote to a brother he need to know what is the year does the year matter when we read the Bible when we open the book of The First Kings we don't ask what is the ear why when it comes to the message you need to know the ear because the word of God is the same it's not about the ear it's about the content if you believe what the content says Say Amen yeah oh I can't and that's the the lack of cooperation that is going on in the in in the message world oh they don't believe it they don't believe he came they don't believe if he came what is he doing in your life yeah we needs to see physical tangible proof than just arguments put together and I always tell people no matter how hard and how sincere your Revelation can be if that Revelation develop in your heart's hatred against other people it's a wrong Revelation that's even if they don't agree with you keep loving them even if they refuse what your saying keep loving them are we together you keep loving them oh they have criticized me they say this to uh uh to to my subjects they've been against me yeah but keep loving them this is hard oh maybe bar you never been in a situation keep loving them before you tell us your story love them first before you tell us what they said against you love them first are we together because there is no Revelation that goes with hatred you have a right spirit love them love them because this is one thing that the prophet had he loved everybody all these Pentecostals they were criticizing him they were against him but he loved them and he said if you make a cycle and you exclude me I will make a bigger one and include you but today Brothers don't say so if you SCH oh I'm gone I'm gone I don't want to be in trouble I'm gone oh I don't like that can you just say like the prophet I will make a bigger one and include you cuz you are my brother are we together let me read this quote here oh my I have 10 more minutes I can read two quotes in a message in the message I read this quote to Brothers yesterday in the prayer meeting what is that in your hand that he preached on November 20th uh 1955 paragraph 51 he says notice him now he is a new man here he goes and now how and now how the world will criticize you when you do this don't expect a flower bed of easy because a lot of people today they just want to be along people you know who love them who speak good about them you know people who are just nice to them but the prophet says don't expect a flower bed of easy if everybody talked good about me and everything went fine didn't have any troubles and trials I will go back to the altar see see the reason why the prophet will go back to the altar like why is everything going fine in my life why nobody's against me why everybody speaking good about me the prophet says I will now praise the Lord because most of us that what we do when everything is okay oh brother Isel this year was the best no problem no trials all is well you are wrong that's right you shouldn't do that if you did that this year don't do it again if you see everything going well no trials no sickness no troubles the prophet says I will go to the [Applause] altar I will go cuz it's not possible I will go to the Altar and say Lord what's the matter here what's the prophet is asking what's the matter because everything's going well but most of us we ask what matter where things are not going well so we're doing just the opposite that's right that's that's a big problem yeah and many people be like when everything is going well brother say yes that what the prophet said and this is his own experience in his life because most of the time we we we love to be praised you know but we we need to be challenged the devil will come after you as long as you're still alive and if you are born of God you will see the devil all the time you will see if you're born of God because you have a certain power and all the time he's needing to to fight against that power that's right he will come after you but when you see everything go smoothly nicely the prophet says come to the Altar and ask Lord what's going on are we together he says uh I I'll say what's the matter here there is something wrong so there is something wrong when all is well this is the question when all is well in your life there is something wrong this is hard brother Israel what kind of equation brother BR yes according to the prophets when all is well something is wrong because how come the devil is he afraid of you why is he no longer you know uh chasing you what's going on there is something wrong why brother Bram he says for all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer uh all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution so when you don't see persecution come to the altar yes said Lord you know uh who's going to do this prayer I I don't know people are just looking at me but I don't know who's going to make this prayer like Lord all is well what's wrong he says when everybody talk good about me why so much clappings why are people happy about me why is everything going well what's going on are we together what's going on I need to know let me finish with this quote here in a message uh raising J's daughter that he preached on July 31st 1956 paragraph 56 he says where your faith lays wherever you believe it's according to your faith jerus was come lay your hands on my girl she will be all right you just lay your hands on her here he come they was going on a little drive his heart go settled down walked alongside of Jesus with his head up oh I'm so glad I made my decision Lord don't worry soon as you make your decision the devil's going to give you a a shock oh this was a nice Revival meeting yeah I got the Holy Ghost as soon as you start saying so the devil will give you a shock and you know he has different kind of shocks you know the shock that he will give me it's not the one that he will give you it's not the one he give to Levi he has all kind of shes right you see so this quot goes together goes along with the other one when I everything going well something is wrong be because the devil is there to send his ches as soon as you make your decision let me follow the lord and some of us will see that the time when you decided to follow the message you had troubles that you never had when you were in the world as the as long as you start looking for the Holy Ghost and you start proclaiming that you got a holy ghost you'll start saying things that you you never saw before new kind of problems new kind of Trials because that's why the devil is there to give you a shock are we together he said the devil will give you a shock don't worry he is the biggest Bluff I know of but he's only but he's only a BL did you hear me he's a BL that's all he is he anger one legal power Jesus Christ stripped him of everything he had on Calvary right the fullen penalty was paid at Calvary and the devil has no legal rights at all he's just a big Bluff and as he's a big Bluff he knows how to give shocks he knows how to scare you he knows how to give you shocks and you feel really I'm shock ched because the big BL one gave you that choke and that will develop your prayer lives you will add more hours to your prayer time are we together because what all goes well we don't pray is brother said when everything's working perfectly you don't pray you know you can check the weather no I don't think I can go to church oh I can't make it this this night I can make it this evening because all is going well but when you have something going on and you need to see the head of God you don't look at the weather you don't look outside before deciding to go to church you just wake up and you go to church because you know I need to seek God's faith are we together them that live in Jesus Christ they have to be persecuted brothers so don't be don't be be afraid when problems come don't be afraid when challenges come don't be afraid and scared when you see things that you didn't see in 2023 it may happen cuz we just at beginning of the year and everyone is like this is my year this is my year but the big Blu the devil is also in this year he did not stay in 2023 he also got his transition he's in 2024 as well any are some new shocks to send be prepared are we together be prepared be a good fighter and don't be scared challenging time will come hard time will come heart diseases will come this year but stand still stand on the word of God and use the power that Jesus vested in you on Calvary God bless you [Applause] the Lord am we can say praise the Lord amen thank God for his word and his encouragement his exhortation amen let's stand and sing a few verses of I'm so glad Jesus Set Me Free I'm so Jesus Set Me Free I'm so glad Jesus set me oh I'm so glad Jesus said me free singing Glory Hallelujah Jesus Set Me Free and didn't have me bound Jesus Set Me Free one day I was bound but Jesus Set Me Free Satan had me bound Jesus Set Me Free Singing Glory Hallelujah Jesus Set Me Free amen how glad to be set free the power of the blood and so we certainly appreciate the word of the Lord tonight it's always it's never wasted time in the presence of the Lord amen God's word is being spoken and uh I have the opportunity to let that word speak to me amen amen I revalue you this time that I have on Earth cuz our days are numbered amen we have to leave here one day and give an account and I don't want to leave anything on the table I want to leave it all out on the field as the coach would say play it like it's your last play Give it like it's your last opportunity and we certainly are looking forward to What the Lord Has for us this coming week and this coming year if we have another year we don't know what it holds but I want to be more faithful than I've ever been amen I want to be more um dedicated than I than I've ever been there's anybody I might not be the most talented or the most gifted or the most qualified but I can be more faithful and I can be more sincere with what the Lord has given me amen amen we can really pray like we never prayed before where I want to ask the Lord to help me to get give me the energy you know sometimes I wake up I have a lot of energy for this and that and ask the Lord to give me energy and strength so I could serve him better amen and so that's one of my prayers this year we've been going a bit um with the little uh the little group of Believers there in Phoenix with Brother Art and there's a Thursday night service we'll have with them and they stream this service Sunday morning and Sunday nights until the Lord uh shows something different and um but I wouldn't take nothing from our journey now and I don't want to um rust out I want to wear out I want to put all my time in the word of the Lord amen I'm still a young man I'm I'm very young I got a lot of strength I got a lot of you know say brother that's long that's you know you're really going to oh what what we got so I'll rest on the other side how about that you and I will rest on the other side when is it time to work today today the time to work amen so God bless you uh we appreciate brother Bonza coming and sharing those words with us amen and and we're coming to the table of the Lord here tonight which is a very sweet service it's it's nice to be able to remind it's always a showdown you want to make sure things are right in your life and that you don't have any loose feathers loose sins hanging on there and uh it can happen so easily where you can develop the wrong uh perspective or attitude and but the communion service seems to help us those that take it seriously seem to help us to not to you know let things go on that's not right that's not correct and so we want to be honest and faithful and and honest with all men I don't want to be a gr have a grudge against nobody I don't want to feel a funny feeling towards anyone any group any church anybody amen we the Bible says with if possible all that life within you live peaceably with all men and that's our desire and we can do that without compromising I believe Amen in 1 Corinthians chapter 11 and verse number 23 we prepare to go here the scripture says thank you just saw that thank you I've received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed he took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had up saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as of as you drink it in the remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever should eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world isn't that nice to be chastened versus being condemned I said Lord correct me I don't want to be condemn correct me no matter what it takes how many feel that way amen I believe brother vom expressed that way the way he lived he wanted the correction wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come so we will uh have silent prayer you pray for me I'll pray for you and we all pray for one another um as we t one for another heavenly father in my hand I hold the bread that was made for this service I pray Lord that you would sanctify it for the purpose that we are gathered here for Lord in remembrance of of you Lord we don't take it lightly Lord we want to come soberly and Lord and forgive us of our sins and shortcomings as we as we have prayed Lord and examined ourselves we partake of it Lord and may there be a blessing that comes with the obedience to your word bless it father in Jesus name we pray amen heavenly father I hold the cup of the New Testament of your blood it's the wine it's it's alcohol the blood of the grapes that have been for fermented it's alive and Lord we partake of it tonight we ask that you would sanctify for this service and those that would partake Lord may they receive the benefits and the blessings of being obedient to your word Lord I pray that there be any discourage oppressed or depressed or need a healing touch in their bodies may they receive that tonight tonight we know that there's healing in the cup we believe that we thank you for it now in Jesus name amen now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end and excuse me and supper being ended the devil had having now put into the heart of Judas the scariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands that he was come from God and that he went to God he rised from supper he laid aside His Garment and he took a towel and GED himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter Peter saith unto to him Lord does thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head and Jesus said to him he that is washed needeth not say to wash his feet but is clean every wit and year clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments he was set down again and said unto them know ye what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another 's feet for I've given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them amen and we're happy to do the word of God tonight and um and we will go to our feet washing we'll sing a song before we go let's sing that song let see um can't think of it but it's uh
