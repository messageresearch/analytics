[29:04] was so
[29:06] tormenting and I would pray about it
[29:09] here and there and I
[29:13] never thanked God in advance for it and
[29:18] someone told me that I needed to start
[29:20] doing that and so I
[29:23] finally got down and I
[29:26] prayed and I started thanking God and
[29:30] after that I told the devil that he had
[29:33] no more control over me
[29:36] and if he ever tried to attack me again
[29:39] I would just start thanking and praising
[29:42] God and um I a few days went by still

[54:39] you know my my my throats kind of
[54:42] rough I was preaching hard this morning
[54:47] so uh there was a time that
[54:50] I that I went and preach and I was
[54:53] getting tired and I said you know what I
[54:58] I'm going to start being so so given
[55:01] into it I'm going to kind of take a
[55:05] slow and something you know in my heart
[55:08] you know in my mind said oh so you're
[55:10] going to take a slow huh and I couldn't
[55:14] I'm like no if I'm gonna do it I'm gonna
[55:16] do it
[55:17] right and then you know after that the
[55:20] Lord will take care of business amen so
[55:23] God bless you I'm happy to be here
[55:27] uh to me it's a
[55:29] uh it I I think it's easy for me to uh
[55:34] to come and and preach and talk to you
[55:37] but what is hard for me is to avoid
[55:41] mistakes I I find myself trying to be
[55:45] real careful and every word everything I
[55:49] say because that this is your native
[55:52] language it is not mine I learn it
[55:55] through education
[55:57] and so I don't I don't want to be I'm
[55:59] I'm afraid sometimes to to say things
[56:02] and I'm like I they really understanding
[56:04] what I'm really saying or or am I saying
[56:06] something that means something else you
[56:08] know and so that's my my fear not not to
[56:12] speak not to come and and try to you
[56:15] know to say something that the prophet
[56:18] has already said it is is is those human
[56:22] aspects of the of this thing but I think

[1:12:00] this is going to the Lord lead us but I
[1:12:04] want to talk about
[1:12:07] right and the reason that I
[1:12:10] read that
[1:12:12] scripture is
[1:12:16] because Leo
[1:12:19] means people's Justice
[1:12:26] and and it is the same or is another way
[1:12:28] to say it and he says here the name
[1:12:31] leoda which means people's
[1:12:38] right and it amazed me
[1:12:41] me I'm I'm I'm
[1:12:43] amazed of the
[1:12:46] word how perfect it
[1:12:49] is
[1:12:51] how there there there are seven ages
[1:12:55] yeah seven
[1:12:56] churches and how Le was taken as the
[1:13:01] last

[1:40:03] happen yes
[1:40:05] sir miracles
[1:40:10] happen you find people in the scripture
[1:40:14] when they when they came to the Lord
[1:40:16] they didn't come in the right condition
[1:40:19] uh remember the the the copes woman he
[1:40:23] called them dog remember
[1:40:26] that she was not coming in the right way
[1:40:29] she had issues she was a
[1:40:32] gentile amen but she did one
[1:40:36] thing he said that she fell on her on
[1:40:39] her feet and

[1:40:56] resurrect from the
