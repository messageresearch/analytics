[6:09] forgive us of all our sins and
[6:10] iniquities, Lord. Lord, just living in
[6:14] these bodies, Lord. We know we're we sin
[6:17] against you, Lord, because we're still
[6:19] in a fallen [music] condition, Father.

[6:51] Thank you, sir.
[6:54] Before we sing, just have a quick little
[6:56] announcement. Um, I think there may have
[6:58] been a couple issues with uh getting
[7:02] some of the photos to Sister Heather for
[7:04] uh for the meetings. So, she had just
[7:07] requested that um if you could just go
[7:09] to her and get her email information and
[7:10] just email those pictures instead. That
[7:12] way, we can uh reduce the problems we
[7:15] were having. So, we'll go to the key of
[7:18] F.
[7:20] [music]
[7:20] When the Savior [singing] calls, I will
[7:25] answer. When he calls for me, I will
[7:31] hear.
[7:33] When the [singing and music] Savior
[7:35] calls, I will answer.
[7:39] I'll be [music and singing] somewhere
[7:42] listening for my name. [music]

[8:10] And if [singing] my heart is [music]
[8:13] right when he calls
[8:16] me, if my heart [music and singing]
[8:19] is right, I will hear.
[8:23] If my heart is right [singing and music]
[8:26] when he calls me, I'll [singing] be

[9:01] And if my [singing] road is wide when he
[9:05] calls
[9:07] me, if [music] my road is wide, I will
[9:12] hear.
[9:14] If my [music] road is wide, when he
[9:18] calls me, [singing] I'll be somewhere
[9:22] [music] listening for my name. May be
[9:26] seated. I'll be somewhere
[9:28] [singing and music]
[9:29] listening. I'll be somewhere
[9:32] listening. I'll [music and singing] be

[25:24] Father, as we [music] sing the songs of
[25:26] Zion and praise to you, Lord, dear
[25:30] Jesus, come now and speak to our hearts,
[25:32] Lord. Give us what we have need of. We
[25:35] pray. Lord, we lay our cares, we cast
[25:38] all our cares [music] before you. And we
[25:41] know that you care for us, Lord. And the
[25:44] song says, "You're good all the time."
[25:47] And Lord, we believe that. We testify
[25:49] [music] that tonight. and we ask for
[25:52] your goodness to come now and begin to
[25:54] open the word to [music] us and bless us
[25:56] with your presence. We pray in Jesus
[25:58] name.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. God [music] bless you saints. So

[26:14] Yes.
[26:15] And um we thank the Lord that they were
[26:19] able to

[26:24] homegoing service there. And we know it
[26:26] won't be long we'll see them all again.
[26:28] Amen.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have eternal life and the true
[26:33] believer cannot die.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; And so we thank the Lord for that. Just
[26:37] welcome you to the house of the Lord.
[26:39] Good to see the Williams in the back
[26:41] there. Mother Williams and and uh dear
[26:44] daughter there. Amen. Let's give the
[26:46] Lord a hand of praise. [applause]
[26:49] Amen.
[26:50] In the scripture, we like to just take a
[26:52] scripture in Hebrews 11
[27:06] and verse one. Now faith is the
[27:09] substance of things hoped for, the
[27:11] evidence of things not seen. For by it
[27:14] the elders obtained a good report.
[27:17] Through faith we understand that the
[27:22] worlds were framed by the word of God,
[27:25] so that the things which are seen were
[27:27] not made of things which do appear. By
[27:31] faith, Abel offered unto God a more
[27:33] excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which
[27:36] he obtained witness that his he was
[27:38] righteous, God testifying of his gifts,
[27:41] and by it he being dead yet speaketh. By
[27:45] faith Enoch was translated that he
[27:49] should not see death. It was not found
[27:52] because God had translated him. For
[27:55] before his translation, he had this
[27:57] testimony that he pleased God. But
[28:01] without faith, it is impossible to
[28:04] please him. For he that cometh to God
[28:08] must believe that he is, and that he is
[28:13] a what?
[28:14] &gt;&gt; rewarder of them that diligently
[28:18] seek him. Not part-time seek him, but
[28:21] diligently seek him. And that's what we
[28:24] want to be as a diligent seeker of the
[28:27] most high God. So, God bless you. You
[28:28] may be seated. Um, we're going to take
[28:31] just a few moments and remind you of our
[28:34] meetings coming. There's a service this
[28:37] Saturday. I will be at in the tabernacle
[28:40] de Shalom. Shalom Tabernacle in Wararez.
[28:45] The pastor is Caesar Seyz.
[28:48] And I met him at that at that meeting
[28:51] that we were at there for
[28:54] um in Wores when I was the Lord put it
[28:58] on my heart to do more missionary work.
[29:00] He was in that meeting. I met him. He's
[29:02] been inviting me
[29:05] ever since and he has his I don't know
[29:07] what meeting this his annual meeting and
[29:10] I decided that I would I told him I
[29:13] would come. So I'll be there Saturday.
[29:16] you pray for me that I can make it back
[29:19] at an appropriate time on Sunday. But

[29:22] mine coming to speak for us, brother

[29:50] man. He's the assistant pastor for
[29:52] brother Ardonz.

[30:43] um the great mysteries that have been
[30:46] revealed to us. [snorts] And tonight I
[30:50] wanted to take a portion of what we were
[30:53] talking about the last couple of Sundays
[30:56] on this
[30:59] timing and the word and the advancement
[31:02] that the Lord has brought the church
[31:04] through and brought us to. Oh my. So,

[31:19] preached in 1962.
[31:23] He uses um,
[31:27] uh, some words in there that I really,
[31:29] really love. And I just want to go right
[31:31] into that. and he's typing the modern
[31:35] scientific achievements
[31:38] with the achievements that God had in
[31:41] building his church that he um uh the
[31:47] automobile from the horse and buggy to
[31:49] the automobile to the airplane and then
[31:53] to the astronaut. and how these
[31:57] horsepowers continue to get greater and
[32:00] greater and greater.
[32:02] And I did a real just a real quick
[32:04] casual search over some of the
[32:07] achievements that science has achieved
[32:10] since 1965. They're just innumerable.
[32:15] uh two of them that I will mention
[32:17] tonight
[32:19] was this um
[32:22] invention or the discovery
[32:25] of the DNA
[32:28] and its the genetic profiles and how
[32:31] that works
[32:33] and the researchers that found it. We
[32:37] don't really know who they are. We don't
[32:41] really some of us really don't care.
[32:44] But uh it has been profound for the
[32:48] medical community and for
[32:51] uh law enforcement. It's been able to
[32:54] identify the human being and really give
[32:57] us each our own specific profile.
[33:04] And since this discovery in 60 after 65
[33:08] there in 70 something I think in the 80s
[33:12] they started to implement this and there
[33:15] [sighs]
[33:16] are over 600
[33:18] cases of people that were convicted of
[33:22] crimes that have been exonerated.
[33:24] So these are people that were went
[33:27] through the legal system, through the
[33:28] courts, the judic judicial system,
[33:31] attorneys, laws, arguments, testimonies,
[33:35] proofs. He did it. No, he didn't do it.
[33:38] Prove me wrong. They were proven wrong,
[33:40] found guilty in a court of law. But this
[33:44] discovery of the DNA evidence
[33:48] um now comes on the scene and exonerates
[33:51] them. Now, that wouldn't make you happy
[33:54] unless it worked in your favor.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; And you would be so glad that somebody
[34:00] did the research.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; Somebody you don't even know.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; Somebody in a lab coat, maybe a four
[34:07] eyes and a no-name just working behind
[34:11] in some cubicle. Research, research,
[34:13] research, research. Aha. They find this.
[34:17] And then in the medical community
[34:20] community they were able to be able to
[34:22] dictate uh uh determine or find diseases
[34:25] early on cystic fibrosis is one of them
[34:29] amongst children that the average
[34:32] lifespan 20 years after this discovery
[34:35] being able to treat it early um moved
[34:37] their lifespan to over 50 years.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Now if you had a child that had that you
[34:43] would be really praising the Lord
[34:45] &gt;&gt; for this discovery. Is that right?
[34:47] Somebody you don't know, somebody we
[34:49] don't even care about, a no-name,
[34:51] whatever. But they did the research,
[34:54] they tapped into it, and as real good
[34:57] research does, and real good um openings
[35:01] like this, it benefits people far beyond
[35:06] the people that find these things. And
[35:08] so, um, Brother Brandham brings that
[35:12] correlation with science and the church
[35:16] and how, and he makes this statement,
[35:18] and I read it for us on Sunday.
[35:23] Um, and I wonder if I can pick it up
[35:26] really quickly. I apologize.
[35:30] Sharon, can you get my Well, Levi, get
[35:32] my iPad off the desk. I try to prevent
[35:34] it because I think I have it on my
[35:36] phone.
[35:38] Make sure I don't have it in my pocket
[35:40] this time if Levi can get that for me.
[35:43] But he said, "The church really should
[35:46] be further up the road." Said that in
[35:50] 1964.
[35:51] We really should be further up the road.
[35:54] Now science has taken their discoveries
[35:59] and they have advanced
[36:01] so that 10 years ago they are well
[36:05] advanced than what today than what they
[36:07] are what they were 10 years ago.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; And I believe that the scientists on a
[36:15] carnal level if they could advance what
[36:18] about the believer?
[36:21] Are we are we supposed to be doing what
[36:23] the old believers did 10 years ago?
[36:26] Thank you. Or should we be further
[36:29] advanced?
[36:31] &gt;&gt; Luther was an advancement from the
[36:34] Reformation. Wesley was a further
[36:37] advancement from Luther. The
[36:40] Pentecostals were a further advancement
[36:43] from the Wesleyans. The message of the
[36:46] hour is a further advancement. The
[36:49] believers of the first generation
[36:52] ministers and pastors of this message
[36:56] should be a further advancement.
[36:59] Um,
[37:01] today we should be a further advancement
[37:03] than they were 30 years ago.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart.
[37:09] I remember when I came in, and I've said
[37:11] this many times, that when I came in,
[37:14] the tape library was the main source of
[37:19] getting your message. A church had a
[37:22] tape library in the back, and you would
[37:24] check out a tape and or two, and this is
[37:29] where you got the voice of the prophet
[37:31] from. Very few had the entire message in
[37:35] their hand or the library. And then
[37:38] you'd have what they call the lending
[37:40] libraries and you have your own personal
[37:42] libraries that you would build yourself.
[37:46] How many started building your own tape
[37:48] library? We started that 50s or the 60s,
[37:51] however you did it. I started it and
[37:54] building that and building that. And
[37:56] that was real. That was a real life
[37:58] experience. You know, a tape recorder
[38:01] and a tape. You needed two of those
[38:05] components in order to hear the prophet
[38:07] preach. You needed a tape recorder and
[38:11] the tape. Can I get a witness?
[38:13] &gt;&gt; And you needed electricity.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; And [sighs] thank the Lord we were able
[38:21] to do that. And we did that. No
[38:22] complaints. No complaints. We did that
[38:25] and then the Lord um advanced that for
[38:28] us. And we had in those days quote
[38:33] books. How many remember quote books?
[38:35] &gt;&gt; The golden nuggets. How many remember
[38:38] golden nuggets?
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Some of those quote books. And these
[38:41] brothers, great men that would take
[38:43] their time painstakingly listen to
[38:46] tapes, pull them out, and put the a
[38:49] subject matter of marriage and divorce,
[38:50] whatever it was, put it in a quote book.
[38:52] Oh, if you can get your hands on one,
[38:54] man, you'd be a lucky guy.
[38:57] And then [sighs] the computer has come
[39:00] forth and uh through the computer the
[39:04] message is downloaded on the computer
[39:06] and now it's downloaded on our phones
[39:09] and now it's hard to find a a message
[39:12] believer that comes into the message
[39:14] that does not instantly
[39:17] &gt;&gt; have all the message and sermons of the
[39:20] Reverend William Brham at their
[39:22] disposal. Amen.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; So you tell me a young man or a young
[39:27] Christian coming to the Lord 30 years
[39:30] ago, working through the details of
[39:33] checking out tapes, sending for books,
[39:36] sending for tapes in Jeffersonville,
[39:38] waiting a week or so for those to come,
[39:40] then go home because you couldn't play
[39:43] all of those tapes mobile. You had to be
[39:46] in your car or at home. And then that
[39:49] believer that died in that generation
[39:51] went through those details and all the
[39:53] painstaking whatever it was to hear the
[39:55] prophet. And then you translate and you
[39:57] and we're all in this seventh age. You
[40:00] take those believers and you fast
[40:02] forward to today and how easy it has
[40:05] become to hear the message of the
[40:08] prophet. You tell me. I mean I'm just
[40:10] asking the question. Is God going to
[40:12] judge us the same?
[40:14] &gt;&gt; Yes. No. No.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. Clean it up,
[40:18] brother Art. Yes.
[40:21] You you you tell me. We're sitting in
[40:22] we're sitting in the court of law. We're
[40:24] sitting in court. And here's the
[40:26] evidence. This is what the tools I had
[40:28] to work with as a young pastor 1980. And
[40:31] this is what the pastors in 2025 had to
[40:34] work with. You tell me.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; If God was going to judge us, would he
[40:40] judge us the same?
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Is this a question I would ask? So,
[40:44] we're sitting in the most comfortable
[40:48] &gt;&gt; position
[40:49] as far as a believer being able to hear
[40:53] the word of the Lord. It has never been
[40:56] easier
[40:57] &gt;&gt; than the age that you and I live in
[40:59] right now.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; It's easier to get to the prayer meeting
[41:06] today than any other age.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; And people still can't make it.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; You tell me.
[41:14] a just God, how he would judge us on
[41:17] that. But God has been so good to us.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; He's advanced us. He's given us these
[41:24] great and tremendous
[41:27] um
[41:29] truths to help us serve him better. Now
[41:35] in the message uh God hiding or or in
[41:41] the message um
[41:43] countdown the prophet of God says this
[41:45] paragraph
[41:47] number 60 and remember the messenger is
[41:52] always comes at the end of the message.
[41:54] We know in the church ages there how we
[41:58] got that. Now the horse and buggy days
[42:00] was who that was the ending of the
[42:02] Lutheran age. see horse and buggy days.
[42:06] They believed in justification. God
[42:08] bringing the church from Romanism,
[42:10] Catholicism, he brought it into its
[42:13] first spiritual achievement.
[42:16] The just shall live by faith. That was
[42:19] the horse and buggy days. As they come
[42:23] to the horse and buggy days that ended.
[42:26] Now the next achievement man had in the
[42:28] way of transportation was the
[42:29] automobile. You notice the automobile
[42:32] increases all the time in its power. Now
[42:36] at the end of the Wesleyan age, Wesley
[42:38] age brought in by spiritual achievement,
[42:41] sanctification, which means a church
[42:43] raised from a justified state to a
[42:47] sanctified state. Now I want you to
[42:50] remember this as we go along that the
[42:54] church called church is not the church.
[42:58] The church is church spiritual.
[43:02] Tens of thousands times thousands of
[43:05] Lutheran that join the church know no
[43:08] more about justification than a hog note
[43:11] about a side saddle. They know nothing
[43:15] of it. And in the Wesley age, how the
[43:17] tens of thousands profess sanctification
[43:21] that knowed no more about sanctifying
[43:24] power of God than a rabbit does about
[43:27] snowshoes.
[43:29] See, they absolutely didn't know. But
[43:32] there was a people who achieved it.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; You see where I'm getting to? There was
[43:39] somebody that knowed what justified
[43:42] meant in the sight of God. having peace
[43:44] with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[43:47] There were some of those Lutheran who
[43:48] were loyal. They believed it. No matter
[43:52] what the Catholic Church said, they
[43:54] believed God's word and stood on it
[43:57] because the messenger of that age
[43:58] preached, "The just shall live by
[44:00] faith." And they believed in a justified
[44:04] state. And they was able by the grace of
[44:06] God to achieve justification and have
[44:09] peace with God through our Lord Jesus
[44:12] Christ. Paragraph 66. We notice again
[44:16] long come Methodists with
[44:17] sanctification. There's many of those
[44:19] Methodists that was actually sanctified.
[44:22] There's a lot of them claimed it and
[44:24] know nothing about it. The Methodist
[44:26] church taught sanctification.
[44:29] They said they got down and cried and
[44:30] got back up and said, "Glory to God, I'm
[44:33] sanctified." And they read right on
[44:36] living like they always did. But some of
[44:38] those men and women was actually
[44:42] sanctified from the things of the world.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; And lived a consecrated set aside life.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Why? That was the automobile age which
[44:52] took in more horsepower.
[44:56] Paragraph 67. Now we take men like the
[44:59] uh uh uh the men who would been a
[45:02] greater man than the old brother
[45:04] Bevington and look at John Wesley,
[45:06] George Whitfield, Finny Knox, many of
[45:08] those old Methodists who sweated it out.
[45:11] They went through hell on earth torment
[45:14] because they believe that God's word
[45:17] taught sanctification,
[45:19] the second step of grace. And they
[45:22] stayed with it and they believed it and
[45:24] they done wonders with it. Just the same
[45:27] as Henry Ford and them done with
[45:29] transportation of the old Model T. The
[45:33] Model T forward up the side of the
[45:35] horse. He moved on above the horse day.
[45:38] Wesley moved on above the Lutheran day.
[45:41] Then along come Pentecost. And that's
[45:44] science of the world was able to achieve
[45:48] in an automobile motor. The Wright
[45:50] brothers brothers that created and made
[45:53] and manufactured rather the airplane.
[45:56] The flying machine was far above the car
[45:59] on the earth because he took to the air.
[46:03] Now the Wright brothers through their
[46:04] achievement was able to take science and
[46:07] pattern something here on earth to show
[46:10] that there was a great spiritual thing
[46:13] fixing to happen
[46:15] &gt;&gt; when the Wright brothers was able to
[46:17] achieve to get a man's feet off the
[46:20] ground. Pentecost fell and took to the
[46:24] air with the spiritual gift with the
[46:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost. He took to
[46:30] the air. Oh, hallelujah.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Got his feet off the ground so he could
[46:35] swim around. Got up in the air. Oh, how
[46:38] far he was above the horse and buggy.
[46:41] Let me stop there. So, we see the
[46:43] prophet showing us through science and
[46:46] through the ages how it was a constant
[46:50] advancement,
[46:52] not going backwards, but moving forward.
[46:55] More grace, more power, more spiritual
[46:59] power. and he's typing that to the
[47:03] church.
[47:04] Now he moves forward and says this in
[47:07] paragraph number 69.
[47:10] He says, "Now if Wesley hadn't have
[47:14] stepped out on the word and got a bad
[47:16] name behind him, it was called a crazy
[47:18] man and everything else he would have
[47:20] never been able to achieve. But Wesley
[47:22] was one of God's great scientists.
[47:27] Luther was one of God's great
[47:30] scientists. They didn't care what the
[47:32] churches said, what the organization
[47:35] said. Luther didn't care what the
[47:37] Catholics said. He believed the just
[47:40] shall live by faith.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he took God's chemicals
[47:46] of the word
[47:48] &gt;&gt; and he put it together. And the church
[47:51] moved by faith. Wesley put it together
[47:54] by the blood and proved it by the blood
[47:57] and the church got sanctified. The
[47:58] Pentecostals believe that the baptism of
[48:00] the Holy Ghost that the promise is to
[48:02] you and your children and them that's a
[48:05] far off and they put the chemicals
[48:08] together out of the word and they moved
[48:11] into the air. Hallelujah. They moved out
[48:14] because they were able to accomplish
[48:17] such. Now, I love this in Hebrews 11
[48:22] because faith is the chemical.
[48:26] Faith is the substance
[48:29] that the worlds were framed by. It is
[48:32] the substance that gives the elders a
[48:35] good report. It is the substance that
[48:39] pleases God. It is the substance that is
[48:43] in the word that we can take the word
[48:46] and with the chemicals of the word find
[48:50] the answer to your problems in your
[48:53] life. You see, it's by faith we achieve
[48:57] all things. And in this message or one
[49:00] of the other uh uh uh messages on the
[49:02] countdown, Brother Brandon makes this
[49:04] statement. He says, "At any time a
[49:08] believer ever takes God at his word, God
[49:12] will bring that word to pass." So, it
[49:15] doesn't even matter what age they're in.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; In the Lutheran age, there were some of
[49:19] those saints that saw miracles, signs,
[49:21] and wonders. It wasn't the age for it,
[49:23] but some believers found it in the word,
[49:26] and it worked for them.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Same thing in the Wesleyan age. Same
[49:29] thing in the Pentecostal age, and this
[49:31] age that we live in today. And so many
[49:34] times we're waiting on the group to
[49:36] catch the revelation when really God has
[49:39] given us his word that we're supposed to
[49:44] live by.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Every word
[49:48] &gt;&gt; here. God takes the message, the entire
[49:51] message, and places it into our hands
[49:56] 247
[49:58] access to it. AND NOW GO MAKE IT WORK.
[50:02] You see, we've complained about the
[50:04] elders and the others, and we've
[50:06] complained and criticized the others,
[50:09] and we've said they didn't do it, or
[50:10] this one didn't do it. But you have the
[50:12] word now.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; You go do it.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; And who is holding you back? Who is
[50:19] stopping you? It can't be a church,
[50:21] can't be a pastor, it can't be your
[50:24] group that's around you because all
[50:27] things are possible to them that
[50:28] believe. And God is giving you this
[50:31] word. I believe this needs to be taken
[50:33] more personal.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; I believe that when you open up the
[50:36] Bible, there's chemicals that work
[50:40] together if you can find them.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; And the believer doesn't operate like
[50:46] science does. Science operates through
[50:49] education. Believers operates through
[50:53] revelation.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; This is something AI can't do for you.
[50:58] This is something that Google cannot
[51:00] give you. This is something that no
[51:02] college degree, no college campus, no
[51:04] book, no learning can ever give you is a
[51:06] revelation. Revelation comes from God.
[51:11] And Jesus said, "Upon this rock, I will
[51:17] build not anybody's church, but my
[51:20] church. I'm going to build my church
[51:23] upon divine spiritual revelation.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; It means more to the believer than
[51:29] perhaps we real we realize. So when
[51:32] we're reading the word
[51:35] uh we want a revelation of that word. Is
[51:37] that right?
[51:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; We want to go deeper into it and it's
[51:41] unlimited
[51:43] what we can have.
[51:45] So we take the chemicals of the word.
[51:49] Paragraph number 70, brother Bham says
[51:51] this. I'll just take a few more moments
[51:54] and share out of this message countdown.
[51:58] He says, "Why did these men do this? Why
[52:01] did Luther find it? Why did Wesley find
[52:03] it? Why did these others? Because the
[52:06] material was laying here on the earth
[52:08] that could make a T model Ford. There
[52:12] was electricity that could make a car to
[52:15] run. There was gasoline in the earth.
[52:17] There was pistons. and so forth. All the
[52:20] mechanics, the carbon for the generator
[52:23] and everything they had to have to
[52:25] create this stuff. And notice it
[52:28] manufactured it rather not uh rather not
[52:32] create it. God is the creator. He had it
[52:35] laying here. The man who believed it in
[52:38] the scientific realm or the natural
[52:42] progged
[52:44] and into it and they wouldn't take no
[52:47] for an answer.
[52:49] They believed it.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; It was a revelation in their hearts and
[52:54] they stayed with it until they proved
[52:57] that it was right.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:01] So,
[53:03] one of the most successful Kirby
[53:05] salesman, vacuum salesman, he was a
[53:09] trainer. He was a believer in this
[53:11] message. He lived in Phoenix for some
[53:14] time and then he moved to Jasper, Texas.
[53:17] Um um fine brother. Um I was going to
[53:22] mention his name, but anyways, it
[53:24] doesn't matter. And so they they would
[53:26] fly him around the country to to teach
[53:29] other Kirby sales vacuuming how to make
[53:32] a better sale, increase their numbers.
[53:35] And he was so exited out and I was
[53:37] asking him this brother. I said, "So
[53:39] what's the big secret?" He says, "The
[53:41] secret to selling
[53:44] the most vacuums, a Kirby vacuum, is
[53:47] simply this. When you go to that door,
[53:49] you simply don't take no for an answer.
[53:52] You listen to them say no. They're going
[53:55] to tell you no many times, but just
[53:57] don't accept it as an answer. And you
[53:59] just stay there. You keep moving with
[54:00] them, changing the price, changing the
[54:02] subject. Wear them down. Wear them down.
[54:05] Wear them out. Do you want to buy this?
[54:07] No. Okay, let's keep on talking. Keep on
[54:10] talking. It's a matter of me winning.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; You want me to leave? I'm not going to
[54:17] leave. If this is in my mind, I'm not
[54:20] going to take no for an answer.
[54:22] and his sales numbers was way up here
[54:25] and everybody was down here. And that
[54:26] was his key. Do not take no for an
[54:29] answer. WHAT IF WE APPROACH GOD'S WORD
[54:31] THAT WAY? WHAT IF WE APPROACH EVERY
[54:34] PROMISE? I'M SICK IN my body. I GOT
[54:38] TROUBLES IN MY HOME. I GOT PROBLEMS IN
[54:40] MY LIFE. BUT I WILL [screaming] NOT
[54:43] ACCEPT NO FOR AN ANSWER.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO TAKE GOD AT HIS WORD TODAY.
[54:49] I'M going to take him AT HIS WORD
[54:50] TOMORROW. I'M GOING TO TAKE HIM AT HIS
[54:52] WORD FOREVER. [screaming]
[54:54] &gt;&gt; THEY won't say take no for an answer.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Take that key.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Take it with you.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Bandham says it here. They
[55:05] wouldn't take no for an answer. Look at
[55:09] your neighbor and tell them. Don't take
[55:12] no for an answer.
[55:15] Oh my. Y'all better than Sunday morning.
[55:18] Thank you. Paragraph 72.
[55:23] You know, a believer has to be
[55:25] tenacious.
[55:26] A believer has to have something that's
[55:29] moving them. If it's just education,
[55:32] it's going to fail you. But if you have
[55:34] a revelation that's MOVING YOU
[55:37] &gt;&gt; THAT GOD keeps his word, then you will
[55:40] not take no for an answer. EVEN IF
[55:43] NOBODY ELSE IN THE CHURCH EVER
[55:45] experienced it, you will become the
[55:48] first one to EXPERIENCE IT
[55:50] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD PROMISED IT IN HIS WORD.
[55:53] IT'S BEEN REVEALED IN MY HEART. AND THIS
[55:56] IS WHAT GOD BUILDS HIS CHURCH UPON. NOT
[56:00] ARGUING QUOTES, NOT arguing scriptures,
[56:02] not an intellectual, NOT EDUCATION, BUT
[56:05] A REVELATION which the youngest one to
[56:07] the oldest one can receive
[56:10] &gt;&gt; is a divine revelation. And that's what
[56:13] God builds his church upon.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; He built it upon re revelation.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; You know that you know that you know.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Can you explain it all? No. But I know
[56:24] it's true.
[56:25] Amen.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; So the prophet moves forward here.
[56:31] Paragraph 72. Did you notice one of
[56:33] those scientific achievements
[56:35] accompanied the other one?
[56:37] Complimemented the other one. It was
[56:40] only a higher form. The automobile was a
[56:44] higher form of transportation than the
[56:47] horse. The airplane was a higher form of
[56:50] transportation than the automobile. But
[56:52] they accompanied one another.
[56:54] Horsepower. Amen. If that's horsepower,
[56:58] what about God power?
[57:01] &gt;&gt; What about the Holy Ghost and power? I
[57:04] wonder if us church folks really believe
[57:09] in the Holy Ghost and power
[57:12] &gt;&gt; that the Holy Ghost still has power.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Power to change your attitude.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Power to change your way of thinking.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; That's selfish.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; POWER TO GIVE YOU FAITH to believe that
[57:30] these things are true. Amen.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost in power.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; It'll change a man.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; It'll heal any disease. It'll heal
[57:39] autism.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; It'll heal cancer,
[57:42] &gt;&gt; AIDS.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Even the dead can be raised again. I'm
[57:46] talking about the I'm talking about what
[57:47] we're preaching today.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; It is the answer.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; The doctors have all these answers. This
[57:53] prescription and another prescription
[57:55] and another kind of prescription for
[57:57] this for you to feel good or to live
[57:59] with your pain and live with your
[58:00] problem. And I thank the Lord for all
[58:02] the prescriptions. But what about the
[58:04] real doctor?
[58:06] &gt;&gt; That's I mean we're talking about a
[58:07] medical doctor. They they've advanced.
[58:09] YES. THANK THE LORD FOR THEM. They've
[58:12] advanced. YES. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE WHAT
[58:14] ABOUT THE REAL DOCTOR IN THE HOLY GHOST
[58:17] CHURCH?
[58:19] &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT IS THAT [screaming] IS THAT
[58:20] DOCTOR STILL AMONG US?
[58:22] &gt;&gt; IS HE STILL THE HEALER?
[58:25] &gt;&gt; YES, HE'S THE HEALER.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; NOT SOME SYMPTOMS. ALL DISEASES,
[58:32] &gt;&gt; mental health,
[58:34] &gt;&gt; personal trauma,
[58:35] &gt;&gt; issues, situations. He's the healer.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; That's the God we're talking about.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; We believe in the Holy Ghost and power.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:50] Paragraph 78. Science has been able to
[58:52] approve
[59:01] Sorry. Go back to paragraph 72. Excuse
[59:03] me.
[59:05] Holy Ghost and power that can justify
[59:07] you. The same Holy Ghost power can
[59:09] sanctify you. The same Holy Ghost power
[59:11] that sanctifies you can fill you with
[59:13] his presence. A little science that
[59:17] didn't know their ABCs found it. Why?
[59:19] They were spiritual scientists.
[59:23] Amen.
[59:24] Then they seen the thing. Do you believe
[59:26] this was a spiritual scientist right
[59:28] here?
[59:30] &gt;&gt; He did something that nobody could do.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; God used him. He got into the chemicals
[59:36] of the word. He said there'll be a
[59:38] little gray squirrel appear right there.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; And with things that was not seen was
[59:44] made visible.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THAT. I BELIEVE IT. WHAT KIND
[59:49] OF SCIENCE? WHAT KIND OF A S WHAT KIND
[59:52] OF laboratory was brother Brandon
[59:54] working in? He's out IN THE FIELD. THERE
[59:56] WAS NO SQUIRRELS. There was none around.
[59:58] Then he says, "There will be a
[59:59] squirrel." [screaming]
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; That's the leader of the church that we
[1:00:07] are following, saints.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; That's the bishop of our church.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; HE'S THE LEADER.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; WHAT WILL HIS FOLLOWERS LOOK LIKE?
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; They ain't dead, cold, and formal.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; They ain't half asleep. No, no.
[1:00:22] Taking God at his word,
[1:00:24] believing that all things are possible
[1:00:27] to them that believe.
[1:00:30] It took
[1:00:33] science has been able to prove that
[1:00:34] there's an astronaut that can go so far
[1:00:38] till you couldn't see it with your
[1:00:39] natural eyes. And it could go whether
[1:00:43] there's any pressure there or not. He
[1:00:45] can go on out because in a pressurized
[1:00:48] tank. That's paragraph 78. And he can go
[1:00:50] up there and sail around and see and see
[1:00:53] the worlds around. An astronaut. Oh my.
[1:00:57] What an age that that is coming. Yes,
[1:01:00] sir. Go beyond any natural things at all
[1:01:02] and sweep plum on out into yonder. What
[1:01:05] does it represent? a spiritual age,
[1:01:09] a spiritual time to where God is going
[1:01:13] to have what?
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Spiritual astronauts,
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; singular or plural?
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; Plural.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; There's more than one.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; They couldn't deal with that one.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Wait till there's another group of them
[1:01:26] that's doing exactly what that one said
[1:01:28] that we would be doing.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; That was just the first fruits.
[1:01:36] What about when the church really begins
[1:01:38] to hear those words and take what he
[1:01:41] said to heart and believe it with all
[1:01:43] their heart? Satan will be powerless
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; before that true church.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. A spiritual age, a spiritual time
[1:01:55] where God is going to have spiritual
[1:01:57] astronauts.
[1:01:58] Amen. They're right. They're here right
[1:02:02] now.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The eagles of the air that
[1:02:07] can go beyond any other bird.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; SELL ABOVE EVERYTHING. SPIRITUAL
[1:02:12] ASTRONAUTS.
[1:02:14] GLORY. That can take the word of God and
[1:02:17] prove that he's the same yesterday,
[1:02:19] today, and forever. A spiritual
[1:02:22] astronaut.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Oh my glory. That makes me feel good.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Living in this age.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Not what a wonderful thing. Now, what a
[1:02:31] wonderful thing for a spiritual
[1:02:34] astronaut.
[1:02:36] Look what he says here. Paragraph 85.
[1:02:40] Remember, the astronaut is controlled by
[1:02:43] a radar.
[1:02:46] Can you all help me close this message?
[1:02:48] Huh?
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; The astronaut is controlled by a radar.
[1:02:52] I'm reading quote paragraph 85. You seen
[1:02:56] them bring John Glenn in? I looked down
[1:02:58] at a Cape Cannibal Cannibal and seen
[1:03:02] that great big radar thing and you
[1:03:04] couldn't even see him nowhere, but you
[1:03:06] can tell where he was by the way the
[1:03:08] radar was pointing.
[1:03:11] That's where he was at. See, and we got
[1:03:14] a radar, too. Prayer.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Prayer is the radar power
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; that directs the astronaut.
[1:03:25] Ask the Father anything in my name, I'll
[1:03:28] do it. See, just watch the way the
[1:03:31] prayer's going. You can see the way he's
[1:03:34] pointing.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just watch the way the church is
[1:03:39] praying. You can see the way the
[1:03:42] missiles will fly.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; You can tell by the way the astronauts
[1:03:46] are traveling by the way the church is
[1:03:50] praying.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Is this church praying?
[1:03:55] That's a question for you saints.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Is this a praying church
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; and not just your individual prayer? I'm
[1:04:02] talking about praying for the body of
[1:04:05] believers. Would you classify this as a
[1:04:08] praying body of believers? Or are we
[1:04:12] just talkers and gossipers uh uh
[1:04:15] spreading information, communication,
[1:04:17] talking, chatting, whispering? or are we
[1:04:21] really a praying church? What would you
[1:04:25] prefer to have to be a part of? A larger
[1:04:27] church
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; or a praying church?
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Don't you want people in your life that
[1:04:32] know how to pray
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; THAT CAN PRAY
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; FOR THE POWER [screaming] OF GOD
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; TO COME ON THE SERVICE?
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of our attitudes is
[1:04:42] because we don't pray.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; A lot OF OUR ISSUES AND PROBLEMS IS
[1:04:46] BECAUSE OUR RADAR IS [screaming] OFF.
[1:04:48] WE'RE NOT IN PRAYER
[1:04:51] LIKE WE SHOULD BE. WE'RE LED BY
[1:04:54] [screaming] PRAYER. IT'S THE KEY THAT
[1:04:57] GOD USES for us to communicate to our
[1:05:00] heavenly father
[1:05:02] all of the things we can do too much. I
[1:05:04] can preach too much. You can sing too
[1:05:06] much. You can be quiet too much.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; But you can't pray too much.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Is this A PRAYING CHURCH? AM I A PRAYING
[1:05:17] PASTOR?
[1:05:18] DO I [screaming] HAVE PRAYING DEACONS?
[1:05:21] ARE THE MUSICIANS PRAYER WARRIORS? ARE
[1:05:24] [screaming] THE MAMAS IN THIS CHURCH
[1:05:26] [groaning]
[1:05:27] PRAYER WARRIORS?
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; That's what's leading and guiding any
[1:05:34] church. That's what's God in your
[1:05:36] household. That's guiding your spiritual
[1:05:38] condition.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; You might be indifferent. You might be
[1:05:41] upset even at my voice. You might be
[1:05:43] upset at the way the church is going and
[1:05:45] way it's not going. You might get upset
[1:05:47] at this one or that one and hold a
[1:05:49] little funny, but if you're in PRAYER
[1:05:52] AND YOU HAVE A LIFE OF PRAYER OVER YOU,
[1:05:55] IT CHANGES your atmosphere.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; People don't get to you so quickly.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; They don't poke on you so easily. They
[1:06:04] don't annoy you so much
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; when you're in prayer
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; because because prayer brings you up on
[1:06:11] a higher level than the average church
[1:06:14] members
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; and the horse and buggy and the little
[1:06:17] Honda Accord or whatever it is.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; We're astronauts
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; flying above
[1:06:25] even an airplane.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; I love that.
[1:06:31] We wanted some big great chemical. Give
[1:06:33] me a chemical out of the word that's
[1:06:35] going to change me. Here's one prayer.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; They took the chemicals of the word
[1:06:43] and they pulled it out and they made it
[1:06:46] happen in their life. That's what this
[1:06:49] is. This is a prayer meeting tonight. I
[1:06:52] trust we can go into prayer.
[1:06:55] If we never be identified by any other
[1:06:57] thing,
[1:06:59] we the church with the best whatever,
[1:07:02] nicest whatever,
[1:07:04] most classified whatever. Oh, but don't
[1:07:07] you want to be a church
[1:07:10] that has a love of God in their heart,
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; that knows how to pray?
[1:07:16] If not anything else, if I couldn't
[1:07:19] preach
[1:07:21] an interesting message ever again,
[1:07:24] if the ministry here was never indepth
[1:07:27] or deep enough for some of you Eagles,
[1:07:31] if the music program was not as
[1:07:35] qualified and gifted and talented as it
[1:07:37] should be.
[1:07:38] If the exterior and the interior of the
[1:07:42] building wasn't up to par like how it
[1:07:44] probably should be, if all those things
[1:07:47] fail, trustees, deacons, Sunday school
[1:07:50] department is the workst, weakest one in
[1:07:52] the city. If all of our brothers and
[1:07:55] sisters are the poorest, the least
[1:07:57] whatever. If all those things were true,
[1:08:00] but we were the most praying, most
[1:08:02] prayerful church,
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; wouldn't you desire that?
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wouldn't that get you somewhere?
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; This is what moved Cornelius, who was
[1:08:13] not even a believer, BUT HIS PRAYER LIFE
[1:08:17] AND HIS GIVING, GOD LOOKED UPON him
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; and remembered him.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Prayer is the key, saints.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; You stomp out of a service upset and
[1:08:31] mad. You come in upset and mad.
[1:08:37] Like I said, the song says they come
[1:08:39] empty-handed,
[1:08:41] empty-hearted,
[1:08:42] and empty-headed.
[1:08:45] And they leave that same way, too.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; But when we come here [sighs]
[1:08:51] with a prayer and the word of the Lord
[1:08:53] over our life, it changes us.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; A man that's in prayer can deal with
[1:09:00] difficult people.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Am I right about it, saints? Amen.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; A man that has his life, a sister that
[1:09:08] has her life in prayer can deal with a
[1:09:10] cold shoulder,
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; can deal with the eye rolls,
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; deal with all of the the issues of other
[1:09:17] people's because your life is in prayer.
[1:09:19] So help us, Lord Jesus,
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; to get us into that atmosphere
[1:09:25] beyond church membership into the
[1:09:28] astronauts, spiritual astronauts
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; plural. He said not just one, there's
[1:09:36] more.
[1:09:37] God help us
[1:09:40] to be that to take the chemicals of the
[1:09:42] word. God bless you so much tonight. Um
[1:09:47] we have a few requests here that we want
[1:09:50] to go through mention to you for prayer.
[1:09:52] If the musicians come, thank you.
[1:09:58] Remember
[1:10:06] that uh men's trip to sunset is on this
[1:10:11] Friday and I believe they have all the
[1:10:14] brothers that are going are set to go
[1:10:17] and we want to be in prayer for them
[1:10:21] and if I know brother Art will be there.
[1:10:24] Brother Art, if you can you get a time
[1:10:26] of prayer there with this brothers,
[1:10:30] remember us. Amen.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; How many would like them brothers in
[1:10:34] that holy place to remember you in
[1:10:36] prayer?
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, call my name out in prayer. Call
[1:10:40] these saints out in prayer. Amen. There
[1:10:44] is a
[1:10:48] sister Tila
[1:10:50] asked for prayer. the little sister that
[1:10:51] sits here, she is in great a great deal
[1:10:54] of pain also for brother Jonathan.
[1:10:59] Um he's working double shifts and and
[1:11:02] they car repairs. They have need of car
[1:11:05] repairs. Brother Jonathan has been ill
[1:11:08] in his body as well. He's been sick and
[1:11:11] working, overworking. They ask for
[1:11:13] prayer for Tila and brother Jonathan
[1:11:16] and also for our November meetings. the
[1:11:19] speakers that are on the flyer there,
[1:11:21] all those brothers. And for the move of
[1:11:24] the Holy Spirit,
[1:11:27] um we're trying to put together a
[1:11:29] [sighs]
[1:11:30] photo album and um for the meetings,
[1:11:35] memory from the past year's 2016
[1:11:38] forward. If you have those, please get
[1:11:40] those to Sister Heather. She's working
[1:11:43] with Aaliyah on getting those put
[1:11:46] together. There was a notification sent
[1:11:48] on the WhatsApp app [clears throat]
[1:11:50] and so I don't know if everybody is on
[1:11:52] there or there everybody should but just
[1:11:54] a reminder anyways to get those to
[1:11:58] sister Heather. All right. Was there a
[1:12:00] request we want to mention here? Anyone
[1:12:03] had a prayer request? Yes.

[1:12:13] else have a request
[1:12:16] tonight. All right. So, we'll go to the
[1:12:19] Lord. Remember? Yes, brother Jonathan.
[1:12:43] Yes.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah. Jonathan's asking for prayer.
[1:12:53] The devil's really after him, trying to
[1:12:55] discourage him and attack him.
[1:12:58] single man trying to serve the Lord
[1:13:00] living alone and um he's asking for your
[1:13:04] prayer. So we will pray with him and for
[1:13:08] him tonight and also always pray for one
[1:13:11] another. The elders, the youth,
[1:13:15] everyone you pray for each one. Amen. Is
[1:13:17] there someone else that has a request?
[1:13:20] All right. Yes.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Yes. Correct.
[1:13:26] tremendous hurricane. I heard from
[1:13:28] brother Jonathan. I text him. He said
[1:13:30] they were doing okay. He didn't answer
[1:13:33] my call, which he normally does. He said
[1:13:35] the believers are doing fine or or
[1:13:37] they're okay so far, but we want to keep
[1:13:40] them in prayer. I'm going to talk to him
[1:13:42] again. And so remember them. Is there
[1:13:45] someone else? Yes, brother.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:54] keep Sister Melissa in prayer with her
[1:13:56] friend as they as they travel. Amen. So,
[1:14:01] we'll stand to our feet and we'll go
[1:14:06] to the Lord in prayer. Maybe we'll sing.
[1:14:10] Remember Aaliyah? She's at home. She
[1:14:12] bumped her head. And um just each one
[1:14:16] all of our
[1:14:18] families, they need a touch from the
[1:14:22] Lord.
[1:14:23] Enemies like a roaring lion.
[1:14:26] Just doesn't stop. Amen.
[1:14:29] So we'll sing pleasing. Let me be
[1:14:32] pleasing to you.
[1:14:36] [music]

[1:14:58] [singing]
[1:14:59] to you.
[1:15:02] Oh pray
[1:15:07] let everything
[1:15:10] I pursue [music]
[1:15:14] be pleasing
[1:15:16] [singing]
[1:15:17] oh Lord [music]
[1:15:20] and to you
[1:15:26] oh [singing]

[1:43:33] Let us sing that song. Brother Trevor,
[1:43:36] if you'll sing a few songs before we go,
[1:43:39] Brother Chuck.
[1:43:43] Sure.
[1:43:45] Come forward.
[1:44:00] So [clears throat] all you most of you
[1:44:02] know that u we were gone up to Minnesota
[1:44:05] for Barb's brother's he passed away and
[1:44:10] so we know that you're praying for us
[1:44:12] and
[1:44:14] as we got to be blessed tonight and here
[1:44:17] uh power of prayer is is is very
[1:44:20] important.
[1:44:22] And so before we travel, we always ask
[1:44:26] the Lord for traveling mercies. And when
[1:44:28] I left here by myself with the dog, uh
[1:44:32] 1650 miles, asked for the Lord to be
[1:44:35] with us and and we made it up there
[1:44:38] taking the car without any problems. Um
[1:44:42] and we just genuinely appreciate that.
[1:44:45] uh because it wasn't an easy trip.
[1:44:48] And on the way back, we end up leaving
[1:44:50] on Saturday morning to come home. Didn't
[1:44:53] get too early of a start, a little after
[1:44:55] 9 in the morning.
[1:44:57] And between here and there in the 1650
[1:44:59] [clears throat]
[1:45:00] mi, there are two smaller cities. Um one
[1:45:04] in Nebraska and one in Iowa.
[1:45:07] And so a lot of little speed bump type
[1:45:12] towns that all is in there is a little
[1:45:14] gas station convenience store but
[1:45:17] nothing else. No services of any kind
[1:45:19] really.
[1:45:22] So we were heading back um
[1:45:25] had been pretty tiring trip and Barb was
[1:45:27] very tired. She was little sleeping and
[1:45:31] we come into this uh Sous City, Iowa and
[1:45:35] as you come into the town getting
[1:45:37] [clears throat] through it's a little
[1:45:38] tricky to hit the right road and so we
[1:45:41] usually set the GPS and then we'll just
[1:45:43] follow it to get out of out of town and
[1:45:46] then we're good. And um but she was
[1:45:50] sleeping and I didn't want to wake her
[1:45:51] up and I thought, "Oh, I can make it
[1:45:53] through." And I missed the turn. So I
[1:45:56] missed uh the turn that I was supposed
[1:45:58] to take to to head south on this Highway
[1:46:01] 77.
[1:46:03] So, we realized it and turned on another
[1:46:06] highway that kind of went that direction
[1:46:08] and figured I'd take a side road, cut
[1:46:11] back to get to that road and it was a
[1:46:13] gravel road and I'm going along and and
[1:46:16] it the car is starting to kind of feel
[1:46:18] like this real weird. I thought, "Oh,
[1:46:20] it's just the gravel, you know, and all
[1:46:22] of a sudden on comes the warning lights
[1:46:24] and I had a tire issue."
[1:46:27] uh was flat and just as I approached the
[1:46:30] highway that we're trying to connect to
[1:46:33] uh I got out and looked at it had a flat
[1:46:36] tire like oh my goodness this is not a
[1:46:39] good spot. I pulled out on the highway
[1:46:41] and I thought this is dangerous. So, I
[1:46:44] pulled in a little siding, backed into a
[1:46:46] little siding area there, and tried to
[1:46:49] get the the wheel off, and it was
[1:46:52] another tricky story. But anyhow,
[1:46:54] finally got the wheel off, and this guy
[1:46:58] came along
[1:47:02] and asked if we needed any help.
[1:47:05] Um, I already had the tire off, but he
[1:47:08] was the local guy. So, we said, "Well,
[1:47:11] you know, we don't know whether to go
[1:47:12] down the road and try to get to a tire
[1:47:14] place or back to Sous City, Iowa." And
[1:47:18] he said, "No, you want to go back to
[1:47:19] Sous City." He says, "There's nothing
[1:47:20] but just little tiny towns between, you
[1:47:23] know, as you go south." And he says,
[1:47:25] "There's several tire spots." And I
[1:47:28] said, "Is there a discount tire there?"
[1:47:30] He said, "Yeah, there's a discount tire
[1:47:31] there." So, we called them up. They had
[1:47:34] the tire that we needed and we end up
[1:47:37] putting, you know, had the donut on. So,
[1:47:38] we're traveling back at like 40 m an
[1:47:40] hour for like 10 miles and we got back
[1:47:43] to Sous City, Iowa. It was lunchtime.
[1:47:46] There's a Culver's right next door. She
[1:47:48] walked over and got lunch. They changed
[1:47:50] our tires and about two and a half to
[1:47:52] three hours delayed along the way, but
[1:47:56] we're right where we needed to be. It
[1:47:58] could have been the middle of the night
[1:48:00] in middle of Kansas. I mean there a
[1:48:04] dozen hundred different scenarios
[1:48:06] probably that made it bad and then after
[1:48:08] we left we got about an hour down the
[1:48:11] road and it started raining and then it
[1:48:13] rained for like 10 hours and it was some
[1:48:16] of the road was real slick but we had
[1:48:17] brand new tires under us you know it
[1:48:19] felt so good and it was just the Lord
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; absolutely absolutely know it was just
[1:48:25] the Lord and we appreciate your prayers
[1:48:28] and God bless
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:48:37] Thank you, brother Chuck. Let's stand
[1:48:39] and sing that song. He's fairer than the
[1:48:41] lily of the valley.
[1:48:44] He is everything.
[1:48:48] The lily.
[1:48:50] Is that too high? [music]
[1:48:56] He is fairer than
[1:49:00] lily of the valley.
[1:49:07] He is brighter than
[1:49:11] all
[1:49:13] [music]
[1:49:14] [singing] star.
[1:49:18] He is sweeter than the snow.
[1:49:25] Fresher [singing] than the Greece,
[1:49:30] [music] lovelier [singing]
[1:49:32] by far than all of these.
[1:49:39] [music]
[1:49:40] He [singing] is fairer than the lily of
[1:49:46] the valley.
[1:49:50] [music]
[1:49:51] He is brighter [singing] than
[1:49:54] the morning
[1:49:57] star. [singing]
[1:50:01] He is purer than [music]
[1:50:05] the snow,
[1:50:08] fresher than the [singing] breeze,
[1:50:14] lovelier [music]
[1:50:16] by far than all of [singing] these.
[1:50:22] [music] May God bless you.

[1:50:37] of prayer. [singing] Sweet hour

[1:51:09] and [singing] wishes
[1:51:12] no.
[1:51:14] [music]

[1:51:19] of [singing]
[1:51:21] distress [music]
[1:51:23] and grief,
[1:51:26] my [music and singing] soul
[1:51:28] has often
[1:51:31] found
[1:51:33] relief
[1:51:36] and oft
[1:51:41] [music and singing]
[1:51:44] snare

[1:52:33] thy
[1:52:35] return. [music]

[1:52:39] I hasten [music]
[1:52:42] unto [singing]
[1:52:44] the place

[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the key of G.
[1:56:24] The trials of this world were growing
[1:56:29] closer.
[1:56:33] The pole I felt was more than I could
[1:56:38] bear.
[1:56:42] And I was on the verge [music] of living
[1:56:47] [singing]
[1:56:47] over.
[1:56:51] The strength within myself [singing]
[1:56:55] just wasn't [music] there.
[1:56:59] But something keeps holding me.
[1:57:02] [singing]
[1:57:04] Every day I see
[1:57:08] he's helping [singing and music] me
[1:57:10] faithfully

[1:57:22] giving [singing and music] me victory.
[1:57:27] He's a reality.
[1:57:29] [music and singing]
[1:57:30] Something keeps holding me.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; [music and singing]
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; Satan laid before
[1:57:41] me his [singing and music] temptation
[1:57:46] of his desire [singing and music] to
[1:57:48] steal away my faith.
[1:57:55] But I have found [singing and music]
[1:57:57] inside
[1:57:59] the revelation.
[1:58:02] [singing]
[1:58:04] The strength I [music] need to keep
[1:58:08] it in his grace.
[1:58:11] [singing]
[1:58:13] Something [music] keeps holding me.
[1:58:17] [singing]
[1:58:18] Every day I see
[1:58:22] he's helping me faithfully.
[1:58:25] to overcome [singing and music]
[1:58:27] my trials.
[1:58:31] He's guiding [singing and music] me
[1:58:32] constantly,
[1:58:36] giving me [singing and music] victory.
[1:58:41] He's a reality.
[1:58:44] Something keeps holding me. [singing]
[1:58:48] [music]
[1:58:50] Something keeps holding [singing]
[1:58:52] me.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Every day I see
[1:58:59] he's helping me faithfully

[1:59:10] [music]
[1:59:13] giving me victory.
[1:59:16] [music]
[1:59:17] He's a [singing] reality.
[1:59:21] Something keeps holding me. [music]
[1:59:25] [singing]
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be [music]
[1:59:31] dismissed this evening.
