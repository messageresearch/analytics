========================================

do it'll caner you right keep love I don't care how much people hate you you love them anyhow if you can't do that you need you ain't sealed you got a loose place yet so come on back and get that sealed up right good with the blood of Christ it'll cleanse you from all roots of bitterness yes now see but we're trying again the Pentecostal blessing fell about 19006 somewhere in there there's a minister sitting with us and not a missionary in Tibet one of the I don't sit because it's his presence I hope he didn't go home I think he's still here you go to speak for us a little before I come down and that man remembers the first of Pentecost there wasn't any organization everybody had things in common oh how easy it is to take the wrong step right there and how good it looks to the intellectual look little did Israel know when they stand out there on the bank a shouting now you say this kind of religion is something new watch it's oldest there is am sure even before the world was ever made they were shouting praising God God said so ask job where was he when the the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joob that's before the world's ever created but now look at Israel had seen Miracles that's the early Pentecost Israel the Pentecost of that day now they've been brought up out of Egypt God had blessed them give them all kinds of great signs and wonders and deliver them and when they stood up that bank and had a Pentecostal meeting they did now listen Moses sang in the spirit amen amen and Mariam took a tambourine and run down the bank beat this tambourine dancing in the spirit and the daughters of Israel followed her dancing in the spirit if that ain't a Pentecostal meaning i' ever seen one little did they believe that the the promised land was 40 years ahead of them is only about 40 miles but it take them 40 years to get 40 miles is because they chose the wrong thing they chose to have a law instead of letting the Holy Spirit lead them the pillar of fire take them on through and lead them they wanted to have something to do themselves they wanted to have certain priests and certain dignitaries a little theology they could fuss about instead of just going on and letting the Holy Ghost lead them they were in the spirit God had provided everything but they had to have something to do into it just like high breeding again let the cow alone let the horse alone let the food alone they science claim and Readers Digest the article of it if they keep on high breeding food and people eats it like chickens they got that poor chicken till they ain't got no wings or legs and if it lays it lays itself death it can only live a year in the tissue So Soft you can't hardly eat it and people eating it is perverting people that's right you know homosexual is on the increase about 40% in the United States over the year ago and did you know that science claims that women are getting wider in the shoulders and Nar in the hips and men are getting Nar on the shoulders and wider in the hips you're eating a perverted seed you're eating perverted HED stuff your body was made to thrive on the natural thing and what's it doing is changing even the natural course of men and women till Hollywood even our government and everything is full of pervs what's he doing they're bringing on themselves by their own tree of knowledge killing themselves go back to the beginning let nature alone let God Alone keep the church and the Holy Ghost and get away from all these Bish go back to where we started at go back Jesus are come I you say I'm a Methodist he'd say it wasn't so from the beginning I'm Presbyterian it wasn't so from the beginning what was that the beginning a Pentecostal experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's where it begin but see we had to perverted oh it makes prettier sure that little church standing out there dancing and shouting and down on the street and people throwing rocks at them making fun out them and everything like that that ain't very pretty now we got the great doxology and the Apostles Creed and oh Dr PhD lld D so and so forth our pastor come out and say oh man like a calf of the cramps and like that all excuse me I didn't mean to say that forgive me I didn't mean to say that like that see I didn't mean that ain't becoming to servant of God but look all them I just come up on my mind see but stand and say all them different things like that practice before the you know say not no you don't say that right aen I like a good old Pentecost me where the power of God's fall in his screen Shou praising God having a great time that's why the spirit's got to hold the people but we um you can't hear a am man hard anymore it's a a man however that's what we get to see these organizations stiff right now did the was it prophecy concerning that you remember Paul's prophecy last night I know that after my departure Grievous wolves shall enter in among you and man of your

this service Lord take every heart under your control every Spirit take it under your control Lord we commit our ways to you just now and ask your blessings in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you welcome each of you to the house of the Lord uh this morning and um welcome all of our visitors and our friends amen so God bless you richly we like to uh go right into the word and then let's all stand for that reading and uh we'll have we'll have a few announcements coming as well um actually Genesis chapter 15 our scripture that we want to go to thank you musicians and the worship was so beautiful and those song specials I certainly appreciate that amen you add to the service when you do that it really it really helps me when you when you um have a song to sing to the Lord I'm so happy when um there's song specials I think every service I ask Brother Scott is there a song special and sometimes we don't have any but we had three today so we welcome those amen God bless you take the scripture in Genesis chapter 15 in verse number one and the after these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in the vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and Abraham said Lord God what will thou give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this elzer of Damascus and Abraham said behold to me thou has given no seed and lo one born in my house is my Heir behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine Heir but he that shall come forth out of thy own bowels shall be thine Heir and he brought him forth abroad and said look now towards heaven and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be verse six and he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness any believers here today and he said unto him I am the Lord I am the Lord that brought thee out of herb the childes to give thee this land to inherit it and he said Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it he said unto him take me a hepher of three years old a sheot of three years old and a ram of three years old and a turtle dove and a young pigeon and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against another but the birds divided he not and when the fowls came down upon the carcass Abram drove them away and when the son was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abraham and low a horror of great Darkness fell upon him so he puts Abraham to sleep and he's going to show him something verse 13 He said unto Abraham no of assurity that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge and afterward shall they come out with great substance and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace Thou shalt be buried in a good old age and in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full amen so may God add a blessing to the reading of his word we'll take one more scripture I think I have a note here for one more scripture that we need to read thank you for your patience praise the Lord and that is in I believe it's in Leviticus chapter 18 when you have that you can say amen amen in verse one the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them I am the Lord your God after the doings of the land of Egypt wherein you dwelt shall you not do and after the doings of the land of Canaan whether I bring you shall you not do neither shall you walk in their ordinances so let us go to the Lord one more time in prayer we're going to speak as we've been on Joshua and Caleb and standing like him we're going to talk a little bit about the iniquity of the amorites just for a moment Lord Jesus we ask your blessings on your word today bless your people in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated oh my so many visitors here today uh if you're a visitor why don't you stand to your feet when I say visitor I'm talking about you're not from here okay cuz I know we all family home so there's a dink praise the Lord no no no no please remain standing I want to see you all right come on thank you so good to have each of you the good speeds are not visitors are so happy to see them God bless them richly and brother D dingwall and his dear wife they've been with us the baates are with us God bless bless you so happy to have them our dear friend sister Carmen brother uh Warren Hansen God bless you from Canada Lord bless you you may be seated and brother and sister here yeah he has a home here too though so we welcome each of you all so happy to have you with us the Saints in Phoenix as well there that meet in in the Mesa I like to always remember the Carpenter sister Carpenters one of uh the oldtime Saints and we are so happy that we get the fellowship with those Believers there and um we trust the Lord will bless each of you this coming Saturday or a Saturday coming up February the 22nd there in Cedar Hills Church in Los cruus New Mexico the pastor there brother Pettis Caleb pet has invited me to come for a youth service there that's on a Saturday we'll get that on the bulletin there in the back everybody's welcome to be a part of that we wanted to uh invite you to be a part of that and so God bless each of you on this particular subject as we've been in this thought or the inspiration of standing like Caleb and standing with Joshua so you got to stand like something and then you got got to stand with something and if you got this balance of how you're standing you'll be able to stand in the evil day and as you study these two gentlemen how they with stod all of the Temptations and the Lord kept them alive through all of the slavery that they went through the trauma that comes with that coming through the Wilderness and all the miracles signs and wonders of Revival the rejection of Moses and at kades Baria they still had Grace enough to cross over that's right and the Lord punished them seemingly by not allowing them to go over even though their faith was right but the others Faith was not right they were ready to go but all the Believers were not ready to go and so the Lord kept all of Israel out because the majority of them did not believe believe and did not have faith to cross over Jordan into the promised land the prophet of God picks this Vision up or picks this inspiration up and tells us to stand like Joshua and Caleb tells us who Joshua is and tells us who Caleb is if you know this say amen amen yes and so we have something that we can go back and look to you know God is a god of patterns and patterns are made to follow they're not made to argue against they're not made to make your own it's not made to to make one like it a pattern is made to follow God told Moses he says make the Tabernacle after what after the pattern where's the pattern at it's in heaven so the designs the instructions of what you're following had to come from somewhere amen amen and if you're following it then you are under the inspiration of whoever created or made the pattern this right here is a pattern and if you follow it you're in line with the author who wrote the pattern don't try to make your own path don't try to do it your own way God has already prepared a way for you it's written right here amen and as simple as that may seem as juvenile as that that may seem as redone it that may as that may seem it's amazing how the human being spiritual people people who follow the word people who call themselves Christians seem to get this Twisted they get confused on following the instructions and the orders even after God has thoroughly Vindicated himself in one area he showed the signs wonders and miracles to the children of Israel he was clearly with them there was a picture of the pillar of Fire by day there was a pillar of Fire by Night a pillar of cloud by day they visibly saw it they experienced God on the a magnificent level they ate from the table of the Lord he rained Mana from Heaven he destroyed the armies of their their um enemies he opened up the Red Sea where does that happen he did all these great signs and wonders but still that wasn't enough all right that wasn't enough to give them Grace to cross over and inherit the promised land what an example what a warning what a time so this instruction of of Abraham's seed and what they would go through the Lord tells them that for 400 100 years they will dwell in this land and they will be afflicted by another Nation doesn't call the nation by name and then it tells them he begins to tell them that but I'm going to deliver them with a with a strong hand a mighty hand doesn't reveal the process doesn't reveal Moses's name doesn't get every names just tells them this is what I'm going to do and here's your timeline remember and the five must one of them is the time and the season and the other two or three are wrapped in it's got to be a prophet and the prophet's got to be Vindicated these are the must in doing God a service in doing God's will that's not just doing God a service as a preacher or a minister that's for mamas that's for young people that's for everybody that wants to do anything towards God you got to run these disciplines in your life these five must be there did the prophet say it was the prophet Propet a Vindicated Prophet is it the time is it the season is it the person that he said it would be done by so here the Lord has given them a time frame right that's one piece of this puzzle you're going to be afflicted for 400 years count them out count out those years we're only here 200 years how many more years have we got we got 200 more years we're halfway through it it's Grievious it's hard why are we here because great great great great great great grandpa saw in a vision that we would be here and the Lord showed him we' be here 400 years now that time was extended the prophet of God says it went 40 extra years the scriptures tells us it was 30 extra years that they were in that uh under that gruesome time now there's two reasons why brother random deals with it in the message of Third Exodus why he delayed their Deliverance why it went longer than the 400 years one of the reasons was because Israel wasn't ready they rejected they complained against Moses we see a slight snapshot of it when he kills the Egyptian remember that and then they said who made you you going to kill me like you did the Egyptian who made you a ruler over that's just a little it looked like a nothing but it comes back in existence in the wilderness and then it grows in numbers and then it grows in influence it was just a little conversation I was trying to help you uh and I actually we on the same team and then you flip that thing and it's a little little Edge who made your ruler over us and it look like it's gone I'm gone I leave I'm you know you got you call me a murderer and I'm out on the backside of the desert and that little thing is still there we don't see it until many years later you know the only way to deal with sin is through the blood and blood comes through a Redemption a process that comes only through repentance you got to be sorry for your sins you got to ask God to forgive you of your sins and then that sin is dealt with you don't cover it over you don't leave it go you don't wait until next you know just don't ignore if it's there you need to deal with it amen so this is one of the reasons was they wasn't ready they resisted against Moses they envied him Psalms 106 they rose up not just jealousy just like an Envy envious grew envious over him and the other reason was was this iniquity of the amorites now the amorites wasn't the nation that held them captive the amorites wasn't the ones that enslaved them but they were a part really it's the only name that God mentions to Abraham your seed will be afflicted in The Strange Land for 400 years and then so on and so on but the iniquity because the cup of the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full is that right is that what it says yes in the scripture there we just read it and so the Amorite and we see in Leviticus that the Lord makes it clear that they're not to partake of the sins of the land what happens to the land is when Sinners live on the land they actually cause the land to sin they make the land and sinful and so this is a key part the amorites are doing whatever amorites do that's ungodly but they're not in the big picture when you're just studying Israel we not we don't even know who they are we're in Israel we're slaves we're being Afflicted we have a promise we're waiting for that promise to be fulfilled but on the backside wherever the amorites are Canaanites and all the evil Nations they are doing things too and that sin needs to get ripe it's not stinky enough yet it's bad but ain't bad enough when it gets bad enough I'm going to make a move this is what God says I will make the move when the cup is full you think it's bad it is bad but when it gets so bad when the cup is full God Will Make a Move that's another timing element that has to be dealt with amen and so we look at this as the Sunday School lesson this morning brother branam makes this statement here see if I can pick it up was in the sueran church age in the Sunday school as I was putting these together I listened to the Sunday school as well in the back there it's amazing how many times it coincides with the message I'm going to pull it out this time subur Church age paragraph number 36 now we find out that this church Israel as they passed on God had fed them and taken care of them and done everything for them and finally they looked over to the Philistines and the amorites and different ones we want a king they got something we ain't got that's the same thing that people does today one of these our sisters will look over at the television and see Gloria Swanson whoever they and some of women with certain kind of dress on they just can't stand it till they get one brother Ram goes on so you know the great the three Temptations of a minister and Believers is money women and popularity the Bible tells us that money is the root of some the Love of Money Right the root is the root of what all part of evil no they say all all evil the love of money is the root of what all all evil and then popularity goes right into pride and then women as I hard to think about that a bit more um it's bad for a badly dressed woman to come in our presence in our midst it's worse if it's a so so-called sister dressed inapo inappropriately so on and all the brothers you know be careful brother there's Temptation and that's a bad thing brother to lust after a sister but let me ask you this what's worse for brothers to lust after one sister or for one sister that's bad dressed to influence all the other sisters that's good yes sir I want you to think about that you know that one sister because you know we know that sisters today are looking good for their husbands right right don't walk into no trap this morning I'm just we're just talking now all right because every time she's getting dressed she's asking her husband how does this look how does this look how does this look right no they don't they don't ask that they want husband out of the room I need to stay in this mirror longer so she can get herself looking pretty for who and what if if it's for your husband then maybe you should ask your your husband how this looks might get quiet just a little bit today so this money women in popularity I'd say to you sisters watching another sister could be that Temptation for you or soall sister brother random picks it up and he says sisters looking at this what her name was Gloria whatever and then you know that influence begins to move there and you know when and I and I was thinking about this and I'm I'll get into the message here in just a minute this is the message that I'm bringing actually is that you know you you know I know it always tightens up when we start talking about women's dress all right and the worldliness of the world and when brother bandam starts talking about women cutting their hair and so forth it doesn't make me feel any kind of way because that's not my cross that's not my issue I know it tightens up to you sisters like okay how long he going to be on this what's he going to talk about you know who's doing what and so forth and so on but you know for me you know where it kind of tightens up for me as a minister just being transparent with you when brother bam talks about the weakness of a pull pit that probably don't make none of y'all feel no kind of way right who is he talking about when he's talking about the weakness of a pull pit thank you so that makes me feel a certain kind of way so then and I'm responsible for for for keeping the pull pit from becoming weak that's right and that happens when we fail to preach the whole Council of God from ABCs all the way to the Mysteries the whole counsil of God don't say brother Israel we know that already if we know it we wouldn't have these problems yes sir amen and so the prophet gives us a pattern the word of the Lord gives us a pattern and this iniquity of the amorites we'll see that this caused a great stumbling block for Israel I'm going to go into the message here for a moment in as I was with Moses so I'll be with thee remember last week we got into Moses a bit and shared how brother brandom says um God didn't hold you responsible for your mistakes paragraph 33 it might be a different paragraph I think it's different in my book here but he says God in as I was with Moses God don't hold you responsible for your mistakes he holds you responsible for your willful sin he that sins willfully after he's received the knowledge of the truth but a man that's going to do something is going to blunder he's going to fall he's going to make mistakes but if he's really divinely called God is in his heart he'll Rise Again used to be coming to the church years ago maybe they here this morning a man and wife they used to sing forgive me Lord and try me one more time I'll be yours if you'll be mine if I fall if I fail let me rise and try again forgive me Lord and try me one more time I like that for any good soldier is apt to get wounded or hurt amen but if he's still a soldier and got a purpose something to fight for he'll rise and try again any good soldier of the Cross will do the same thing and that's what I want to encourage you this morning if you have fallen rise and try again if you made a mistake if you said something you should not have said if your attitude you behaved in the way you should not why don't you rise and try again again Lord forgive me and give me another chance I don't want to be wrong I want to be right now I need your help in order to be right we all make mistakes we make them every day we make mistakes even even when we don't want to make we don't even know we're making mistakes sometimes we make a mistake we don't even know it until somebody brings it to our attention and say Lord forgive me and try me one more time and brother Ram goes on he says no matter what Moses done it was Moses's office that God respected he was a prophet he was above all the prophet he was really more than any Prophet they'd had his own sister laughed at him for marry an Ethiopian girl he called them together he said don't you fear God if there be one among you a spiritual profit I'll speak to him in visions and make myself known to him in dreams but not so with Moses I'll speak lip to ear with him don't you fear God see and he he goes on and he he brings out that it was Moses made mistakes but even in all those mistakes God was with him yes amen and so when he's commissioning Joshua he's telling him as I was with Moses and all his mistakes I will be with thee and I won't leave you H and I won't forsake you you just stay with what my servant Moses said you know Moses better than anybody Joshua you was his right-hand man you knew the mistakes that the camp didn't know about but I was with Moses and I'll be with you only keep the word on your lips keep the word before the people don't turn to the left or to the right stay with that word and I'll stay with you that must have made that man feel good that had to make this gentleman feel secure in his position as a Believer he don't have to be an Amorite he don't have to be a Canaanite he don't have to be another kind of soldier he was Joshua and God called him to be exactly what he wanted him to be you know this trouble of trying to make yourself something that somebody else has or you're unhappy because you feel like you should be doing better by now or you should have had a more accomplished up to this point or you you could have you you would you wish you would have and you're constantly upset and this is where missionary work really help you out when you go visit other people and what they're happy about what they what they go through and so forth it really helps you it helps balances you that you know what none of us really have a space for complaint because God has been so good to us even if we have a desire to serve him even if there's any conviction in your heart at all to do what's right the grace of God is with you and this assurance that Joshua had that the Lord was with him brother random goes forward and he tells us that you know he could actually be fearless and in one place he said he can be Reckless because he knew that the Lord was with him first of all he knew that the Lord was with Moses no question about that God was with Moses Moses is going on and as I was with Moses I will be with thee let that settle in your heart this morning that God is with you the god of the Bible the god of the Prophet the god of the pillar of fire is with you today that's why you're here today that's why you heard the message today that's why you care that's why you cry that's why you ask God to give you the grace to cross over it's because he is with you Hallelujah yes he's with you and the prophet of God moves forward paragraph 42 and he says this I think a minister today that same message as I was with Moses I think of a minister today that's called of God to step into the tracks where Jesus stood what a command what a commission but each that's called of God is commission to stay stand in that same place I'll be with you even in you to the end of the way each minister is called to stand where that with the works that I do shall you do also each minister is ordained of God is commanded to stand in the tracks of Jesus Christ and perform the duties that Jesus performed that's quite a command so we see that this calling this command that each minister is called to he was with Moses he was with Joshua now we should have the fearlessness in our calling that the Lord Is With Us think about that for a minute the Lord is with you this morning even what you're going through even if it's bad even if you don't understand even if you can't hear his voice like job couldn't get a prayer through but the Lord was with him Daniel Prayed 21 days no answer from nobody nowhere but the Lord was still with him amen Lord help me Lord help us to get a hold of that and know that he is is with us even in US amen yes now Joshua and in all this knowing that that command was great but having the Assurance he could be Fearless he could be as we would call it Reckless as long as he was pointed in the right way he might break up against a hill that would knock him backward but he carried the right way was carried the right way so can the Church of the Living God be Reckless say it with me Reckless and fearless in faith if we're pointed in the right way for he said as I was with Moses I'll be with you I'll not fail you nor forsake you he never forsaken Moses he never fail Moses he will never fail Joshua he will never he will not fail l he'll be with us so never fail Moses never fail Joshua never will fail us he never failed me yet he never failed me yet Jesus Christ never fail me yeah it's been 30 years 40 years serving the lord he ain't fail me all my life for the rest of my life I don't believe he'll fail me how many Believers been serving the lord for over 20 years 30 years 40 years how many got the testimony can raise your hand over 50 years he never failed me yet oh praise His Wonderful Name Jesus Christ will never fail me he didn't fail Moses he didn't fail Joshua he won't fail us so I love this this example I love this inspiration that as Joshua was a type of the end time leader a type of the Holy Spirit a type of a Ministry a type of a True Believer it's a type of the holy spirit so what was one of Joshua's great commissions his commissioned to divide the land to the people and he's also commissioned to place them where they belong that was the commission but before dividing the land he had to give them the grace the faith the leadership for them to cross over Jordan now that's what Moses did not do that's what Moses could not do this was Joshua's job to get the people to cross over you know the holy spirit is trying to move you somewhere yes yes not just coming to church not just arguing with people we're not better than the other groups it has nothing to do with who's better than what the holy spirit is trying to place me from here to here over into a mighty promise that he has already promised to give you me and the believer the Holy Spirit does that yes he does that's what the church service is all about we come to church and Hollywood has us all twisted we come for entertainment like you know some commercial or some movie feature yeah keep me keep me laughing keep me joking keep oh you preach good today you didn't preach so good last week you preach good today though you put the work in today was I reading the Bible last week was the quotes being read last week if you didn't have a good service and the Word was preached that's a you problem that is not a preacher problem that is not a god problem the word was preached come on you can say Amen to the word doesn't matter what church is preaching it determine in your mind every time the Bible is open and read I'm going to be blessed I've got an amen somewhere I'm going to receive from God I don't care who the preacher is amen this Hollywood Services Hollywood evangelism preachers come up and the preacher is below our standard below our eating taste they're from the other group yeah yeah come on somebody help me preach this morning they're from the other side They Don't Preach like but then the brother open the Bible and start reading the quotes and you still can't say amen that's on you that's on you brother that Bible that word is your word he's talking my language be preaching the gospel care who the preacher is Pastor is amen GL to God Amen so he can be fearless and so the believer can and the Holy Spirit is trying to place you each service each tape every time you come the prayer meeting whatever it is Sunday school if you can move the carnality away from your thinking and the entertainment and your expectations be be risen up to the occasion of why you came here then you will be blessed there will be a highlight moment for you if the Bible is being read God amen glory to God can you say Amen to the preacher on the radio if he's reading the word I can he's actually reading out of my Bible that's right exactly right so this is what the holy spirit is trying to do trying to move Joshua trying to move Joshua is trying to move the people into this place now brother Bon makes this statement here and it's in as I was with Moses and I try to move forward paragraph number 76 in my little printed book here he makes this statement he say that's my desire Brethren to see my church cross over into another land a desire to move over to the other side if there is some something in you hear first calling there will be something to respond to that call just settling down to sheep raising ain't enough for you going to some sort of a business is not enough for you just to join the church and put your name on the book is not enough for you because there's something called all across the ridge Yonder across the next Ridge and all across Jordan until you fall into the arms of God Yonder a deep calling unto a deep Joshua know this commission was tremendous so how many has that calling amen amen man yes I want more thank you Lord for your blessings but there's more thank you for the fellowship thank you for the Brethren thank you for all that you've done for me but I want more that's a True Believer oh my goodness I I I just long for more of his grace to be fulfilled to me he given me a lovely family beautiful children a lovely doors that are open to me around different places that I call Fellowship Brothers of like Faith beautiful wonderful lovely people I love and Trust sitting right here but I want more than that I believe there's more for me I want to see what Jesus did manifested in my life the same signs that Jesus did the works that I do shall who shall you do also even Greater Works is that the desire of the believer not everybody don't want that some people are okay with just church normal church as you usual but I want to see an outpouring of the Holy Ghost I want the Holy Ghost to sweep every ow every Pew every heart and just sweep sweep through the building and Rapture every heart every life with the baptism of the Holy Ghost Glory has it happened before yes it's happened before I heard it on the tapes I see it in the Bible Holy Ghost fell so strong one time the earthquakes Oh Glory do you want that yes amen but what if it messes up your hair what if we get out after 12:30 that's what I want bro my brother that's what I desire is an outpouring of the Bible Holy Ghost to fall on me Lord amen I want my cup overflowing amen how many's had some good experiences with the Lord how many wants that times 10 yes that's what I'm talking about we're not upset what he gave I'm glad what he gave us but I want more I believe there's more I want a double portion I want the anointing that Elijah had I want the anointing that's on those tapes the anointing that wrote this Bible the anointing that we read about I want it on me and so the works that I do shall he do also now this recklessness and this fearlessness let me move off this message just for a moment even with all the Great Signs the Wonders and miracles it wasn't enough to keep that group together because they saw the signs wonders and miracles wasn't enough to give them the strength and Faith to have what Joshua and Caleb had but interesting Joshua and Caleb weren't not the only survivors there was other believers remember those that were cut off were the ones that murmured and complained so there no doubt had to be other believers that survive that was not put under that curse to die in the wilderness because they didn't murmur complain and then the younger ones the young pups coming up they wasn't held accountable one of these crossovers is this a man by the name of Ain remember the sin of Ain the great campaign that Joshua crosses over uh Jordan in his first campaign he puts the word first not the clergy not the people not he puts the word first brother bam makes that distinction and he crosses over during the time when the waters our at is fullest he says maybe the scientists and the educated people from Egypt says no we're from Egypt we're scientists we're great men let's wait until after spring when the waters come down but he says no within three days we're crossing over you always have that group like well how we going to do that we never did that before nobody told who told you look who you following and he he ran it to a man that had his sword drawn he says are you Hallelujah are you for us or against us right he said I'm sent for I'm the captain of the Lord's host I'm with you Joshua oh my I'm good then the rest of the land is mine I'm good if he's with me and Joshua had this assurance that God was with him and so he can move forward in his inspiration in his vision the cross over aen was one of them let's take a scripture here just for a moment in what scripture do I want Saints it's in Joshua what chapter do I want Joshua chapter 7 thanks for trying but the children of com Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing for aen the son of Cari the son of zabid the son of Zur a tribe of Judah a notable tribe now this tribe of Judah is a tribe that our Lord comes through I believe is it Caleb a part of the tribe of Judah one of the brothers there Joshua or Caleb was a part of this same tribe it's a beautiful tribe historical the bloodline is clean is pure uh Rahab eventually marries someone through that and and and you know David comes through that and our lord Jesus comes through that same tribe and so his pedigree is pretty good but he is now accused of taking the accursed thing or things but the Lord when he's condemning the sin he's saying to them in the plural he says Israel has sinned they transgress they have taken they have stolen they disassembled that word disassembled means they lied they deceived they sto and the Lord is holding all of Israel guilty of what Ain took what did he took he took a Babylonian garment which by definition would be different than the Hebrew garment or Israelite garment he took a worldly garment it was the accursed thing therefore the Lord could not stand with them this condition was placed on them in verse number 12 let's read it there and Joshua rose up early in the morning the priest took the Joshua uh 7 verse2 let's take it they've transgressed therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enem enemies but turn their backs before their enemies because they were accursed neither will I be with you anymore except you destroy the accursed from among you now there's the deal I'm with as I was with Moses I'll be with you if you don't have the accursed thing among you if you keep the accursed thing among you you all are cursed and when he's inditing them he's inditing all of Israel remember they all went to battle the Lord saw it all he saw what they was doing they getting ready we don't need to take everybody this is an easy win we only bring a second stringers we'll bring the third string okay and we won even bring the whole team save our resources we got this Lord Is With Us Joshua's in charge let's go take Ai and the Lord let him go do that let the process play itself out let the sin and all of that happen let that rude awakening that people are dying what happened Joshua goes to the Lord L Lord what's going on the Lord says Israel sinned they have committed the the sin they they've stolen they've disassembled they have taken they have transgressed therefore they are cursed so now Joshua has a tall task of finding out where this sin is the Lord could have told him exactly the Lord could have just laid it out to them go to this tent It's s room whatever these are the guilty ones go get them the Lord didn't do that everybody was involved the whole congregation and so is everybody involved even today you know these little sins we're responsible to one another huh huh you say stay out of my business uh you are my business I am your business you watching me I'm watching you too and we are the responsibility we have the responsibility of each other right or wrong the Bible says let the Elder sisters do what ignore because you want to get on their nerves ignore what you see no the Bible says you need to go teach them did we move into the new church yet was huh there's a responsibility there and I know you see the same things I see some of you see more than I can see and there is um the accursed thing so this accursed thing of the amorites was the worldliness was what the other nations were already doing it had reached a certain Peak and so the Lord had already told them don't act like the people that you're leaving from and then in the land that you're going to Y don't take on their gods their habits their garments their style of dress the way they sing the way they worship I don't need to go to no denominational praise and worship meeting to teach me how to praise the Lord I am a believer of the word of the most high God I already know how to I know how to worship following the example of the word Church following the example of the new age conference center worship amen coffee shop worship young people centered social worship but thank the lord we have a message and we can get along and do all those things that the world is doing as long as we are not listening to the message you can't listen to that word and you can't be in that word as a minister mama or daddy Sunday school teacher leader of any kind believer of any kind without that word exposing the sin of the day the amorites and what they're doing amen it's going to bring it out even if it's a good idea even we thought well yeah that sound like a good idea let's you know let's let's change the way we do this let's you know let's get a glass pull pit okay and I'm not against a glass pull pit it's okay but but why am I getting one well they got one that's why I'm getting one if that's your reason you need to stop what you're doing because you're looking at something outside of the word you want a glass poopy go get one get a big one get a little one whatever it's not about the material that you're using but why are you doing it exactly exactly we live amongst the amalekites the Canaanites and all the amorites but we have a pattern Glory because we got a prophet that gave us instructions on what and how to follow as we're coming through this land Jesus praise the Lord somebody amen amen amen so let's deal with these amalekites just for a moment the prophet of God talks about them I have four or five places just for a moment Lord and he makes this he makes this parallel with the Joshua in that message as I was with Joshua as I was with Moses I'll be with thee he makes the this terminology a spiritual Joshua he talks about how a spiritual Joshua today is and look at what he says here SP talking about these um amalekites in the Third Exodus he makes this statement paragraph 97 we find out all this has took place because waited revivals the methodists the Lutheran the Baptist cites and all different ones they had a great revivals the nazarine pilgrim Holiness Pentecostals all had great revivals but the great Exodus hasn't come why God told Abraham he keep him in the land right then but the iniquity of the amorites was isn't Yet full and God has waited patiently them people trying to figure out they can see the scriptures run right into something run right into something they said this is the day this is the time but you fail to understand that the iniquity of the amorites is not yet fulfilled 400 years they would Journey down there in Egypt be brought out but they stayed 440 years because of the rejection of the Prophet they had to suffer another about 40 years down there in the wilderness before God brought them out Moses was out in the wilderness 40 years before he ever returned back to deliver them you see 40 years went over time laps because they rejected the message so he gives two reasons right in the same quote the amorites cup wasn't full yet and they rejected the message kind of worked together there didn't it yes now 40 years in God's times would be about 1 half minute our time paragraph number 101 he says this same message I can get it here quickly Third Exodus we see it that the people themselves can see back down the stream of time that the thing is cursed they take a wedge of a fine Babylonian garment again that's the thing that curses among the people when men tries to inject his own ideas about things it's amorites that's doing that that's an Amorite anointing injecting his own ideas about things brother bam is dealing with it and it curs is talking about aen we got to stay with that word that's the Commandments of God not to touch nothing that City that cursed City don't touch it leave it alone and aen thought that he could take this gold wedge and live a pretty decently like the rest of the world find Babylonian garment all the aans in the camp see but the thing is cursed and it continually is cursed it was cursed since the very Nia Council and and I of Rome been cursed ever since but God has let the iniquity fill up until the time of the amorites is about fulfilled let's go a little bit further paragraph 112 all right the iniquity wasn't full yet of the amorites so they had to linger and wait before The Exodus but when the amorites got their iniquity filled then there come a spiritual Exodus or a natural Exodus to lead the people to a natural land where a natural Amorite had once dwelt called that their land and the iniquity of the Amorite denomination has called themselves the church so long till their iniquity is about fulfilled so we're not talking about Sinners and worldly people out there we're talking about an Amorite church right talking about message churches I grapple with this in my mind a few years ago and the only term I can come up with is worldly message churches yeah because they sure don't look like you know there's been a change the last 40 years our sisters have changed the brothers have changed the churches have changed and they continue to change it's getting more rapid now 114 there's coming in Exodus where God will show who is who who where the church itself the Bride of Jesus Christ will be Exodus it out into the land that's promised in my father's house are many mansions in this place you don't have to go there and fight like the they did it's already prepared if this Earthly Tabernacle dwelling be dissolved we have one already waiting that where I am there ye will be also the great Exodus is at hand how many believe that the great Exodus is at hand drop down just a little bit at paragraph 119 there was a pharaoh who raised up who did not know Joseph and that was the beginning of the beginning that was the beginning of the Exodus and when that thing begin to form under a political power begin to form God begin to get ready the iniquity of the ammonites amorites was F fulfilled the time that he promised Abraham was fulfilled and the time of Deliverance was at hand when you see the sin going so rampid in the world yes but even in the church how do you know the spiritual condition of the church what do you look at it's Youth Department you look at the size of the building do you look at his financials do you look at how many people are going there do you look at the worship service how do you determine the spiritual condition of a church huh somebody help me preach who look at the woman that's what the prophet said Brothers you have a lovely Church oh do I what you looking at I ha to get tight like that but if it ain't tight it ain't right somebody said oky doie the prophet of God moves forward shows us that Deliverance is at hand can I take a few more Amorite quotes to you let me get this to you and then I will share what is on my heart sometimes when I preach like this and I'm getting I'm bearing down to some one of the brothers many times the brother are comeing brother Israel is everything okay yes maybe I'm preaching what God put on my heart maybe it wasn't a fire that I'm trying to put out I thought maybe God put this on my heart is everything okay why are you asking that I should be asking you is everything okay praise the Lord Lord help us God doesn't call a man to judge without first warning him paragraph 1963 the prophet of God says this here let's take this here save a little time we'll scoot over here to paragraph 110 Amos the anointed prophet of God he saw the darkness and the Judgment he seen Syria come down with their chariots and sweep through there slaughtered them people out he saw it coming and the judge of God upon them now 50 years before it happened but you see being a prophet he was lifted up into the spirit he saw it a far off see he saw the cup full before it was filled like Abraham God told Abraham your seed shall come into this country sojourn here for 400 years then I'll bring them out with a mighty hand because the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full see God knew that cup was going to fill up he was speaking with his prophet he told him now you see that cup of the amorites down there see but their iniquity is not filled up yet Abraham don't say nothing about it now hold off but it will come amen and when their cups filled up and them 400 years I'll drive them out like Locust before you and I'll establish your seed here in this land amen that's the prophet of the Lord now when he speaks of his vision whether it's wrath whether it's healing it may linger but it's got to come to pass if he speaks in the name of the Lord see it might be a blessing that he speaks for you he might tell you a certain thing and you can't see it at all you say how can it be he told me thus sayeth the Lord this is going to happen and that what's was going to happen and it ain't happened the man is wrong now you'll be judged for disbelieving it but it's going to happen anyhow see it's got to happen though it linger the Bible says yet will it speak in its season it'll come to pass the prophet's only looking off and seeing something he's talking about what he's looking at he ain't thinking about here and what you look like now looking what is going to be and when he speaks that if it's in the word of the lord it's already been spoke and there's nothing in the world can stop it you see that's right only God himself now the prophet goes on Souls that are in prison now also in the message the God of this evil age and he types the uh amorites with uh the spiritual Amor amorites he's talking on the spiritual side the iniquity going on in our assemblies and our churches the sin going on in the camp the hidden sin the secret sin that's causing many to not be healed or the church to move forward it's moving forward seemingly if the numbers are great people were shouting we were happy but spiritually speaking is it really moving forward these signs that I do shall you do also that's right am name that cast out devil is anybody receiving the Holy Ghost is the holy spirit having the prence in the servant do you have a love for the word like never before that's what I would be looking at that's what I'd be looking at yes amen the prophet makes this statement as I wrap this message up here the God of this evil age he says that's the God of this age smart wise scient ific it needs no faith it don't have to prove anything it's already proven by their knowledge you think about that a church a group of people that need no faith because we can go to the doctor anytime or I've already studied it out I know it can't be how can that be it's all intellectual but God said it in his word all the Visions God set them on purpose they're in his word that's correct amen that's correct no vision I we shouldn't be I mean the latter years of Visions kept coming they they're highlighted even more now the time goes on sure and we love them don't we yes yeah if we don't love them we should love them Lord help us amen I have one small portion I need to get to and that is this last day Vision that the prophet had of the Bride he has this Vision in July of 64 and he details what God sees the bride as he sees a clean group clean group of people lovely group lovely lady clean clean looking bunch they're all women now type of the church and then there is a gap there he sees the church come back again it look horrible terrible it was a it was a picture of the last day church it was twisting the rock and roll music it was dressed immorally and um it was led by a witch that's what he said now these are spiritual things you receive them or not um I believe they they're they're absolutely what we see taking place even today absolutely what's going on today and if you're not careful you find yourself you know wearing the Babylonian garments and styles of the world because it's popular you know we know the scripture tells us about a women cutting their hair and if you're guilty of that God's going to hold that against you and that's not you know brother Israel didn't see me any a't brother Israel didn't write no word I don't have no word the Bible said it it's not even proper to even pray like you can't even pray uncovered and what is uncovered uncovered is cut it could be sweeping the floor if you cut it it's short it's not a measuring stick with long hair this is long hair this is long hair if it's cut it's short okay the Commandment is keep the scissors off of it but the style of the day is you know Style it style it I mean just style it you know I got to take care of my ends I got to style it and fluff it and do whatever you know and that where do we get that from go back and look at the message people that you have pictures of them you see how they look years ago they're not looking same today some of these skirts the material that's used as some of these skirts shouldn't even be made it's like an undergarment yes and and that influence from the world some of us see that so it's okay say well brother I'm going to go work out you need to stay at home and work out if you got a dress like that and then and then the paint and then the makeup and then you know from the toenail to the fingernail if it looks like paint you can put whatever there you want to call it a um a Mexican manicure or whatever you want to call it and you y'all know what I'm saying what they call it Ain nobody oh somebody said French this a French manicure oh okay it's good then is a French or Mexican or African manicure if it looks like paint that's good preaching brother yes sir now now that's in the word though sir that's in the word amen amen these Styles and these things and all of this had come up and God held that against it was the accursed thing he specifically told them not to wear what these other people were wearing and achen who survived kades barnea he actually crossed over he survived he didn't fall into the Trap he made it through the 40 Years of where he crossed over he's in the promised land he's under Joshua's Ministry and still he got caught up with a few gold coins in a Babylonian garment why is it because nobody else has I got I got to look different than everybody else I got to make my you know different than everybody else God have mercy upon us yes sir styles of the world some of the haircuts of the brothers looks worldly it's got a feminist twist to it uhhuh and you want to check everything with the word don't you all right oh my I I know you all love me right and I don't come like this very often do I huh but some of you family should be telling me brother is you need to preach on that more that's good yeah give me you know give me something give me Pat say brother preach on that I'mma stand and say Amen I'm standing with you sir some of you m need to come brother you should preach on this send me a quote or two this what I feel like I'm standing alone I start preaching this I can preach on Grace and how God loved you and everybody's fine we believe the vision we believe the M you believe the prophet is right yeah believe every word yes oh Glory I can believe every word what about this word over here on cutting your hair what about the paint what about the worldly flare what about that now any true mother that's filled with the Holy Ghost is praying for her daughter and her son any father is praying for that process it's a challenge we know that absolutely Sunday school teacher you're praying and we on the same team absolutely amen so it shouldn't tighten up it should be revival time like yes preach that amen why because we got a vision of the Prophet I'm going to I'm going to read this Vision here for you all right just part of it all right let me get to it now brother random used this terminology or the angel of the Lord gives him this terminology preview preview of The Bride I'm going to give you a preview of The Bride if you need a drink of water just hold it real quick I'm going to close in just a moment okay all right just for a minute okay if you really need a drink brother Joe will bring you one preview of The Bride preview that word means an inspection or viewing of something before it is brought or becomes generally generally known and available so before it's generally known God gave the prophet a preview I'm going to show you a preview of the and because he showed the prophet now he's showing me of what the bride looks like on both sides you tell me if it matters or not it does he says this in the message paragraph 187 he said I got seven minutes to tell you something I have that happened the day before yesterday um it was July the 3rd I was over here setting in the center and he says I've been in pigal in Rome in France I've been in New York City Los Angeles but the filthiest bunch of women I've ever seen in my life is Jeffersonville Indiana I never seen so much gum and filth in my life as I see amongst them people I sat there till my heart ACH and the lord gave me a vision he says that he fell into a trance and this is what he says here to save a little bit of time I'd like you to pick this up and get it or do I have time to read yes sir paragraph 189 he says this here but when this bride she was looking the one was talking to me I was standing there her eyes she was the cleanest sweetest looking people I have ever seen in my life look like it could have been a dozen or more I don't know how many was a breast but there's just in a group of them and she passed by sweetly with a air in her her eyes up watching as she passed by oh she was beautiful I looked at her and she passed by he said now we shall Ru said that's the bride and he skips down to paragraph 994 now here's the interpretation thereof now remember I just got through writing I I I hadn't finished I hadn't wrote these notes yet but in preaching this morning I caught what it was right in my sermon did you notice that the church only came in view now that's the truth friends the heavenly father who writes the word knows that I tell the truth see I know I just say the truth and not knowing it till just a few minutes ago look like or just recently see did you notice the Bride come in view twice the first seed and the second seed both of them exactly the same one and the reason they were dressed in different parts she'll come from All Nations it'll make up the bride each one had long hair had no makeup and real pretty girls and they were watching me that represented the bride coming out of all Nations see she each one represented a nation as they March perfectly in line with the word Glory then I have to watch her she'll get out of step with that word if I don't watch when she is passing by if she gets Maybe by maybe it'll be my time when I'm oversee when I'm finish or whatever it is what they was getting back trying their best and was getting back just get in line cuz they was looking out somewhere else watching about that church that just went out into chaos the front ones never the back ones just two or three of them was kind of stepped out of line bit to the right hand side looked like was trying to get back in line as they went by they was just past me oh far as here to the wall past me and I'm standing there then I just seen it all move out and leave but you notice the church only came into view once each Nation the church but the bride came in twice see what what it was not knowing it but look at it with my message this morning not knowing that see the seed fell in the ground at n that was the original seed she's come through the process of these denominations which only comes in existence once but the bride returns back again in the last days I will restore see the master pieces brought up that's the reason she was in view reviewed the second time she was reviewed the first time then she was reviewed the second time and she was perfectly the second time like she was the first time oh God have mercy hurry hurry life get in the grain right quick uhhuh all others never prayer no more they went out never come back again but the bride came back cuz she was now do a search in your Bible on what the Alpha and Omega is that's the word she was Alpha and Omega that's why this word is so important to us this is Joshua's commission to keep that word in front of the people that's where the Perfection comes that's the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ and the sin of the day and the amorites and the Babylonian garments in the worldly flare of today brother and sister please as the Lord Jesus will give you the grace to don't resent these statements and take it and take the Leo Dean view or that worldly atmosphere that is so prevalent today the Bride is a clean looking bunch of lady she a clean looking bunch she doesn't show her form and her shape she covers that and if she is married and has a husband and he's okay with that then something is wrong with him yes but many times they I don't know maybe some of the sisters are doing this at their oral C you should ask your husband if this is okay and if that's okay then go get it go do it but it's still contrary to the word whether husband's for it or not the word of the Lord is pure it's clean and he's coming back for a lovely church and I thank God for this message because it keeps us clean it pushes us to say things that we must say not just the feeling of the day God bless you so much love you God bless you let us amen praise the Lord God bless each of you let us pray Lord Jesus we thank you for your word this morning as you plac it on my heart two weeks ago and I didn't put it together like I develop it maybe like how I wanted to but I said it Lord according what I read Lord what was in your word a reminder nothing new Lord is just a reminder this great iniquity that Ain was guilty of even under Joshua's Ministry he slipped up he got caught up and how a true Joshua handled the sin properly he got it out of there and that's what I want to do Lord I want to get it out of my life and that's what every believer wants to do is get the ACH in the Sin out of their life I pray oh God that this would would just touch the hearts of your people we pray we love you we thank you we ask for your blessings and your kind favor now upon each one in Jesus name amen God bless you amen amen this evening we have a special treat our dear brother George will be taking the service tonight so pray for him and the Lord will bless our meeting tonight amen

our feet and um thank the Lord for his goodness to us amen [Music] you know I've heard that statement said I was talking with my good friend there in Florida about the ministry of brother Wesco and know brother Wesco wasn't a a deep preacher what you call a teacher but he knew what he was he preached Faith that's and God honored him that's right and he influenced so many people and we were talking about how that little wave came in there about you know we need to preach the Bible get back to the Bible preach Christ we're not preaching a man we're not preaching the message and it sounds good yeah cuz we do want to preach the Bible we are preaching Christ but what are the Baptist churches doing what's the Pentecostal churches doing they call themselves preaching Christ preaching the Bible and if you're not preaching this message which is the shout which is part of the Rapture I'm not talking about salvation but I'm talking about for the Rapture Jesus does all three the shout the voice and the Trum and what was the shout oh I'm so glad I heard that shout that's why I know you today it's because of the shout and thank the Lord for it we thank God for this message we thank God for it it's our daily bread and we appreciate him for it and so we will um come back to the house of the Lord tonight and enjoy the good things that God has for us and we trust the Lord will bless you richly amen we're going to go to the Lord in prayer maybe we'll sing one more song here let's see here amen let's sing that song oh I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them that's one of those old

say I'm one of them I'm glad I can find find an identification in the scripture and say I'm one of them I'm a Joshua I'm a Caleb and as I was talking with this brother about brother Wesco and his ministry and how like it's probably 15 uh 16 years ago it seemed to be the growing sentiment they preach Christ preach the Bible and then you look at some of the people that have turned against the message and look what they're doing it was a strong criticism from those that were just playing the tapes and this one brother told me he said you know the reason why the people that are doing that they just play the tapes is because they didn't have a good five-fold Ministry over them but look at the five some of the fivefold ministry look what they've done and on both sides you see this craziness and this disassociation with the prophet his message ashamed of it whatever but I tell you right now I would not be alive today in the word of the Lord if it wasn't for this message that's why I preach it that's why I embrace it that's why it's become a part of me and I this is I'm not being a hypocrite I'm not trying to throw it off on nobody this is this is me this is I found my home in the word of the Lord and so we thank the Lord thank the Lord for it the strangers come they get to hear it uh give them the opportunity to hear it I heard it one day it changed my life amen and I'm
