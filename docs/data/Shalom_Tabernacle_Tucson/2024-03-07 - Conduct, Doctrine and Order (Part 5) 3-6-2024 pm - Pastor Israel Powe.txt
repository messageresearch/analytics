good to see brother George and the aror and the different ones that it couldn't be with us and we're so glad to be here back in the house of the Lord once again we like to go to the Lord in prayer and um a scripture reading that we will be turning to is Romans chapter 12 and um just before we read that let us pray Lord Jesus we thank you for bringing us together once again we thank you for we can f your Holy Spirit in the atmosphere of joy and worship we thank you for that Lord Jesus to lift up our heavy hearts and burdens I pray that you'll speak to our hearts we pray and use us father for your purpose for your service tonight we love you Lord let each one receive their portion we commit this service into your care and we love you we thank you Father amen amen so God bless you in Romans chap 12: 1 and two and we've taken the Wednesday services on conduct order and Doctrine and we've been on the conduct for I think four services this will be number five and we'll take the scripture to get into what we want to talk about tonight before we go to prayer verse one I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God Amen what a powerful uh portion of scripture God bless you you may be seated powerful portion of scripture that it's in your mind how you need to look at this that that she that be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind and we started this uh series of messages for the purpose purpose of building up pillars in the house of the Lord and making uh more stable Believers and bringing the Simplicity the nuts and bolts the bricks and the mortar of what makes a Christian church and a Believer and we started that with um our behavior and how um our life is not our own and that we come to Christ not join in a picnet but we come to to join in forces Darkness against light and um then we took a service on their our post of Duty read those scriptures for forsake not assembling of yourselves and then we went further deeper into that uh I think we took the post of Duty and two services and then we last Wednesday or the last time we spoke was on giving your best how we want to give God our best he deserves our best and tonight we'll we have a couple of more that we want to get to but tonight we're just going to talk on our dress code the way we dress and is is that important to God and it's it's kind of some one of those things where we assume everybody knows and we know that everybody has heard it uh we seem but it's interesting how little things slip our minds and it's just nice to read it again to go over it again and this idea about dress and dress code you'd ask yourself is God concerned with that and yes he is very concerned from the Old Testament coming all the way through um even to the message of the hour today so let's just take a scripture over in Exodus or I'm sorry in Genesis chapter 1 and verse chapter 3 three excuse me and this is when Adam have fallen him and Eve and verse 7 says and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sold fig leaves together and made themselves aprons now a couple verses later in Genesis 3:21 the Bible says and unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothed them so we see that sin was the original reason that anyone would need to cover themselves and the purpose for clothing is to cover your nakedness and when man sinned he realized that he took a fig Leaf him and him and uh Eve and they covered themselves because they were ashamed they had become aware of their nakedness and then God further goes on slays a lamb and then fully covers them with the lamb skins now this covering was their consciousness of the sin that they had committed and God further um institutes this covering in Exodus chapter 20 for the priest Leviticus chap 21 also he's talking about those that are in the priesthood Le Leviticus 19 um 19 that know that your garments should not be mingled and so um maybe we'll have time we'll read some of those but we we focus a lot on the women's dress a lot we hear that and the two main Messengers in the Bible were Timothy and or I'm sorry Paul to Timothy and the Apostle Peter and 1 Timothy Chapter 2 I'd like you to turn there in the scriptures in verse pardon me we'll turn to First what I call First Timothy yes say is it important well the Bible shows that it is important and there's a reason why first p in first Timothy two right yes in verse number nine let's start with verse seven says where unto I am ordained a preacher and an apostle I speak the truth in Christ and L not a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and Verity I will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting in like manner also that women orain ORD Dorn themselves in modest apparl with shamefacedness and sobriety not with broed hair or gold or pearls or costly array but which becometh women professing godliness with good works let the woman learn in Silence with all subjection but I suffer not a woman to teach to nor to use up authority over the man but to be in silence so this is Paul telling to Timothy he's talking about the man lifting up holy hands and in prayer and then he gets right into on the women how they should Adorn themselves and then in 1 Peter chapter 3 verses number I'll take verses 1 to 10 it says likewise you wives you can turn there it be nice if you did they might put it here too be in subjection to your own husband that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be one by the conversation of the wives while they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear who adorning let it not be that outward adorning of platting of the hair and of wearing of gold or of putting on apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart and that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God a great price for after this manner in the old times time the holy women also who trusted in God or Adorn themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters ye are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to the knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and being hirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered finally be all of One mind have compassion one of another love as Brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil railing for railing but contrary wise blessings knowing that ye are there unto called so this is a calling you're call to that you should inherit a blessing for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no gal you know it's interesting how it's intertwin your prayers being hinded hindered in lifting up hands in prayer it's like it's a it's not just the natural thing that your outward dress as he approaches the women he's specific towards the women in this Paul and Peter and then we have brother brandom what can we say about him did do we need to speak clearer does can he can he say it any louder can he speak any clearer his position and stance and how the age has dictated to our women but it's also a spiritual condition of showing you the condition of the Church of the nation of what's going on you watch the women and there's a reason why because the original sin was centered around what we know was sex and the sexuality of the man and the woman and so now therefore those bodies have to be covered this is part of our covering the clothing was given to us to cover ourselves but Peter tells us and Timothy tells us that it should be in modest apparel modest clothing and that's for the purpose uh because in 1 John 2:15 it tells us to love not the world or the things of the world for all of the things of the world come through the lust of the flesh the pride of life and the lust of the eyes so what your eyes see can hinder and it deters you and so so as I have been going through this and we've heard many things I started to look back over just a Christian Nation like our nation and taking some of the historical points and brother brandom used this term called a beat neck and that beat neck that terminology was um you know there's a definition for it says a person who participated in the social movement of the 1950s and the early 60s which stressed Aristocrat Aristocrat and self-expression and the rejection of mores of conventional Society broadly usually young an artistic person who rejects the Moors of conventional society and you know brother Ram deals with that um beat neck group and that beat neck crowd also you see the rise of what was known as the rock and roll music that hit and many of these Superstars that help influence and remember our fashion started in Paris France and it landed in Hollywood and then from Hollywood through the movie industry it program it propagated it out to all so you didn't have to go to a concert to see Elvis Presley you could just get his record or his album you could see him on the one of the the the American band stand or whatever show was out in that day same thing with Marilyn rro the way she was propagated and way that influence through the television it spread out and it influenced the entire nation brother random deals with this and I shared it with the church here some time ago on the knee high took every quote on the knees and the knee high and where that started and and there's several quotes on it but brother Ram says it started in the Catholic church and he said the first song that they let slip through on the radio that was uncensored through this Clara Bow was rolm girle rolm girlly show your pretty knees and and that hit the radio and that influence hit and turned many many hearts and I want you to realize and recognize that you know when we're talking about uh a Dre a dress code that's kind of sounds like a bad word but it's the attire or a way that a man would Adorn himself or a Christian would Adorn themselves remember at the turn of the century when the Holy Ghost fell in theusa the Holiness churches the Pentecostal churches was the Holiness move and they believed in dressing properly many of them the men dressed properly the women dressed properly and they held on to that those Holiness standards and there's no scriptures that tells us to wear a tie or a suit or what is business professional or business casual there's no scripture that tells us exactly what to wear but we know right at the turn of the century that when the Holy Ghost poured out and then brother Ram's Ministry came in he was an example as to what we should follow and I want you to I want you to pay close attention that the the um the worldly church is not our example all right for music for dress for any of these behaviors in God's church God has given us an example and what has happened is the the Pentecostal churches many of them have moved from that Holiness those Holiness standards most all of the Pentecostal churches preach that it was wrong for a woman to wear pants they took this scripture out of Deuteronomy uh where is it at believe it's 22 verse five says this the woman shall not wear that which pertain it unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all that do so are an Abomination unto the Lord if you take Che that whole chapter that's one of the first and I think it's the only time he God uses that terminology of an Abomination for a woman to put on a garment that pertains to a man or a man to put on a woman's garment and brother B told us those were shorts and a woman's garment is short and so you see men out there uh today one of the popular he's a billionaire I believe now he's a popular pretty much in a predominantly black church the first time I saw him I was a single man and my sisters invited me over to this comedy deal Christian Comedy it's clean Christian Comedy whatever I went there and this gentleman I I just don't want to mention his name but some of you because I mentioned him some of y'all know who I'm talking about tall black gentleman but his whole character was dressed as a woman hilarious it was funny I laughed we all laughed but then you start looking at that you say wait what is this we see you say well brother it's just it's just humor just comedy but the scripture said that's an Abomination but that was like 30 years ago 25 years ago 30 years now many of those churches that used to have a standard in the stand have closed they've open open up their arms to this whole homosexual agenda which is sexual indiscrepancy on another level it's all going to be based around sex okay and so they've opened up their pull pits now the churches are allowing it or they're not preaching against it it's just F small groups of them pockets of them one Bishop of the biggest black Pentecostal Church they had a bishop coming there Bishop I'll mention his name Bishop Bishop Carter got up there and preached and he and he let him have it I mean they let him preach and he got up and he start preaching about all the sissies on the organ homosexuals on the piano walking around their pocketbooks and their pink ties and all of these fashions that we think it's cute we think it's okay but all of it comes from somewhere it started somewhere and he blasted at and then tell me why the bishop of the organization had to come back and apologize to the world that everybody's welcome and you know he didn't express our views and so forth and so on but that just shows you you know and and many times as the church goes you'll see that's the way politics go many laws in this country like um the whole civil rights movement and the bridging of different colors and breaking those barriers that was was done by the move of the Holy Ghost when the Holy Spirit fell in those churches there um in Lost Angeles it it went across all color barriers you still had your segregation you still had your ideas but when the Holy Ghost Came Upon all colors and brought these Believers together then you know that you got to go to work somewhere and that puts pressure on the boss it puts pressure in society brother vandom dealt with it when he went up north he said they couldn't have it in the South because of segregation he had their meeting up north because they allowed the two groups to come together integrate which was an issue that it had to be dealt with but who who deals with that first who's the gatekeeper of those issues it's got to come from the church and I'll tell you right now that's the most important institution in any neighborhood is your church you might think it's some University out here but look what they've gone to tell me tell me they know where they're understanding they don't know who they are they don't know who a man is or what a girl is how many identities of genders do we have where's that coming from college degrees that's where it's coming from it ain't coming from little man on the altar that re that receive the Holy Ghost no no God keeps his church clean and those standards and the standard bearers have always been and will always be the local church yes sir yes sir if we let down the bars where are we going all right I I if if we the Church of the Living God that receive this message can't handle the word and live a life then who who's who's supposed to do that not the government so these issues are always be preempted and and God has always the holy spirit is always a move above A Step Above what they trying to work out out here out here what's right what's equal on God is always in top of that on charge of that it comes through the local church and so the Pentecostal church with all their great influence they let down the bars just on this one issue on wearing the pants I was a little boy in the Pentecostal church I was raised in a home that our people didn't our women didn't wear pants until I was well out of high school I believe I was in high school my 10th or 11th grade uh there were some of the pastors and preachers started preaching it was okay that was Old Testament this here the scripture that I'm talking about and then so you see that and you put that on steroids You See It Go On You See It Go on until you know I've just seen the deterioration with my own eyes and so why does does that happen that happens because the people that are supposed to keep the standards they let down the bars and then so this Council culture and this this uh um this um this uh group of people that want to go against the conventional standards it used to be that you would dress up to even go to the movie or catch an airplane flight or go out in public on the weekends man and wom look decent I'm talking about in this country I'm not I mean they' be smoking a cigar too but at least their dress was decent they recovered and now what do we have today it's just a loosed it's untapped untamed and I I took up this gentleman I used to like to listen to him well I I thought always thought he was a bright uh gentleman and he is but I really started to like him a little bit more uh since he started taking a stand for God in the Bible now it's this gentleman Jordan Peterson some of you have heard of him but he he he spoke on men's dress here um he's a Canadian psychologist and you all know I don't I'm not into quoting other people but I'm just showing what the worldly some of the worldly people are saying this gentleman he makes this statement that since the 1960s this has been downplayed as important its importance has been downplayed and they asked him what do you what would you blame that on and he said it's a reflection of the rebellious attitude towards anything that violates traditional Norms anything of patriotical Oppression or adulthood to eliminate or adopt a more what they call a more free individuality so we're more free to think how we want to and then he makes the statement most men look like they're children yeah but blowed up dad looks like a like like little Junior his shirt's untucked he looks horrible he's trying to be cool he's trying to be hip and that that that adulthood the the effort it takes to to look decent when you're in public it takes a little more effort and California has very been very influential on this loose flipflop sandals wearing men come on uh uh go anywhere dressed the same way anywhere and it really is a reflection of our age and our times and brother banham talks about this clar ofo and he and he he mentions that that was the start of many of the down the downward spiral and so forth and so this these scriptures that we read for you here um Leviticus 19 we'll just take one there let's let's just go to Deuteronomy just for a moment Deuteronomy 22 he said does it matter well it's not my word I didn't write the Bible that's right it's God's word and God was so concerned even with the seeds that were planted in the field the clothes that you wore um how you plowed your field he he told him don't plow the field with the ass and a eye he told him don't mingle cotton with uh L with your linen with your with your um um with your cotton your wool and your linen don't blend those together he very specific and where is this control coming from was this Moses's idea this was God's idea and God put these laws in there and he instituted to these people because they were coming out of Egypt and he specifically told them I do not want you to pick up their ways where you're coming from and where you're going in a Land of strangers I don't want you to pick up their ways either I am the Lord and I'm going to establish these commands and blessings to you and if you hear them and you adhere to them you will be blessed takes a little bit more effort you got to open up your ears and find out what's going on but he's the one that's in charge and this idea that you know that I'm free and I can do whatever I want it's amazing that everybody that's free that's doing whatever they want how why they all look the same they all be bop the same they drive their car the same they R sit back in the seat the same they kick it they do whatever it all look the same where that's coming from where's the individual ity on that so so and I I'm very aware that there are styles that come in and there's different uh things that are in for style but um but when there's these great changes in how we approach God and how we come dressed to the house of the Lord then you need we should ask ourselves where did that come from yeah first of all the prophet here I love this picture because he's got on the tie he's got a little pocket square oh that's too dressy brother brother John that's too dressy well what example are you following did he wear cufflinks don't nobody say Amen it's all right he wore the cufflinks he was a gentleman and he dressed decently could you imagine brother ROM coming to the pull pit like some of these Mega pastors today with no the open collar and the muscle shirt on and the jeans pants with the leather whatever to match so you look so cool and hip and just open up that front button so we can see your raggedy chest as you're so cool and comfortable and making everybody feel welcome who's welcome that's right who you bringing in you you you you widen up the you widen up that loose atmosphere they come loose they stay loose God has a standard and his standard has always been his word and James tells us take for your example the prophets James tells us that take for example the prophet so let's take Deuteronomy 22 let's see how much God cares about some of these things this is the Old Testament just Shadows but he instituted it in verse number three in like manner shalt thou do with his ass and so shalt thou do with the reignment with all the Lost thing of thy Brothers which he lost thou H has found shalt thou do likewise thou mayest not hide thyself Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or as Ox fall down by the way and hide thyself from them Thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all that do so are an Abomination unto the Lord thy God listen to this one this one really got me if a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree or on the ground whether they be young ones are eggs and the Dam sitting on the Young and upon the eggs Thou shalt not take the dam with the young but Thou shalt in any wise let the dam go and take the young to thee why that it might be well with thee and that thou mayest prolong thy days he's talking about a bird you see a bird sitting on his eggs God puts a law in in there don't take them both be so so and you obey this so that your days will be prolonged now the god that we serve is a very detailed God you think of the the whole solar system and the way the stars are out there even our bodies the way they're built and make up made up this muscular system and the blood and our Heartbeats and even our brains is just so complex that it takes a specialist for different parts of your body to really know how to really work with you and that's just a human being and this is the god of creation and this is the god who has instituted his laws to Israel and he's presenting them even on how the priests should come and how they should be dressed let me ask you if those details that make God who he is if those details have changed or is he the still the same is God still a god of details is he a god of small things of the little things he's very well put together thank the Lord and and um his word just how it's formatted and brought to us the way he shadows and types things and then he brings it back again in another way and then he reveals it in another way and then he opens it up and then he preaches you the gospel in the stars and then he preaches it in the pyramid then he preaches it through a man then he preaches it through his word so many different layers and levels to the god that we serve and I believe that those um details are still in our God and the standard that God has given to us in this day I believe we should be a little bit more um aware and conscience of of those things now why the women so much they asked brother bam that question in the cood and he deals with it and this is what he says here paragraph It's question number 408 and questions and answers is why is it that we make so much a big issue of women's dress oh I'm getting it on this one ain't I said big issue on women's dressing and cutting of hair and do nothing said about the hair of the man or the way he dresses well sister I'm going to agree with you one thing first place the Bible said that a man should not have long hair and if he had long hair I tell him just the same as I tell you he's wrong but most men a lot of them like men don't have any at all like me don't have any at all but most men cut their hair look like men and now if they didn't do it they'd be told not to do so to leave their hair grow out like a woman's hair you'll get all of this in marriage and divorce vows and things when we preach on it the big issues such as man's or women's dressing now a man the first place of man's body is not a Temptation like a woman now man he's big old hairy legs knock kned pot tumed and everything he's a horrible looking mess and there's nothing about him in temptation I heard somebody say Amen but you know what it's some feminist looking men now it's some sorry looking men they really into how they look very fingernails filed like they got some gloss or something on them a shine just cute and getting prettier I'm talking about men sissified where does that Spirit come from yes sir yes sir you know you know the the reason why we wear the things that we wear in many cases is because we want someone to look at us a woman dresses that way to show her flesh or to show parts of her body men do it too for the eyeballs they want someone to look at them they might not even they might not even want you to get their phone number am I even I've seen them get out of their cars at the store and different places and they get out and they're looking around waiting for somebody everybody's wearing the spandex whatever you call it and they get out and they swing and they're looking for attent could be from another woman could be from another man don't matter just so somebody looks at them or else why else do they dress that way they dressed that way because they want the attention they want those AR to look at them and this is part of the Great uh Temptation that Satan uses brother vam says here um pot tummy everything he's a horrible looking mess there's nothing about him for Temptation and I think he looks the gamest looking sight to see these men come down the road young or old with a pair of these bikinis on whatever it is you know walking down the road I think that's the dirty Prest looking site me too I ever looked at that's right I think he don't know what site of the race he belongs on that's right that's right a man that'll do a thing like that you know what I just heard a few months ago the American Army is going to dress that way yeah the army's coming out next year or year after next all in shorts how big a bunch of sissies can we get God made a man to look like a man act like a man dress like a man he made a woman to do the same dress like a woman act like a woman be like a woman about this morning the question come up the tape goes on if a woman I wonder if they have yeah if a woman's got real thin hair he goes on about if she wants to add some hair to that and so brother Ram continues on he calls it a rat or a thing that you know is kind of comical how he says it but he's bringing in why you know it wasn't uh the big issue the the the big issue around the women's dress this is why Paul deals with it Peter deals with it and brother brandom deals with it because that was the original sin amen that's what it's surrounded around that's the whole pressure is this is this sin the original sin to get the Sons and Daughters of God to fall brother random said they actually became prettier today than they've ever been the average woman has become prettier through these whatever things that they have today and they're just you know for beauty for part of the fall and that's that's absolutely by Design let's take 1 John 2 215 quickly brother brandom called Satan evees designer that was her designer the woman's designer 1 John 2 verse 15 says love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passeth the way and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will will of God abideth forever so we see that the way we dress speaks on who we are it identifies our attitude of wherever we're going whoever we're approaching our thoughts towards the people that we meet the way we dress it identifies what's going on in the inside of us um we're not talking about you have you don't have clothes to wear we're talking about you took the clothes that you do have and you choose to wear the clothes that you're wearing now you choose you make a conscious choice for most of us in this country this may change this might be different for another culture I can't really speak on a third world culture I can't really speak on you know one of the other you know other nations around the world maybe in Asian culture or another culture that speaks of on the islands and so forth I'm talking about in the American culture the American Church where the last move of God came in isza Street and then this great message and how the churches had a standard and they've fallen down from that standard every single year and it's it's not long before everything the denominations are doing you get those influences trying to come here to the men's hairstyles to the women the way they dress to the the tight tight suits and the tight and and the you know this whole uh dressing is what we see we see it out there but we don't want that to be our standard is that right and so who's supposed to be an example in this city of of how a Christian is to dress I'm talking about who if upon on the earth in this city Who as a young man or a young couple or young lady if we're going to point out an example on how they dress what group of people should know that who's been giv the light on that and if the group of people here today don't don't care or it don't matter then God have mercy yes you know there's I think I sent a link out on to some of you and some of you have been getting these testimonies on brother Billy Paul bil Billy Paul's testimony how many you heard some of those we'll play some more for you if the Lord willing but remember that time he talks about he was getting dressed to go to the meeting and he said said it he had on a I think he said he had on a black uh he had on white jacket with black pants and some kind of shoes and he was dressed up pretty sharp and his daddy asked he says Billy where are you going he says he said I'm going getting ready to go out to the meetings to hand out prayer cards and he says oh you look nice uh I thought you were going out to to a party or something and he says he says no this is did he said are these the only clothes that you brought Billy like no I brought my suit he says okay and he says is you know just the way brother Billy tells it it was just so gentle and so nice and he told he said brother bam told him he says you can hear it on the testimony he says he says Billy why don't you go put on your suit because we're representing the greatest thing that can be represented the Lord Jesus Christ so this was just a multicolored out outfit that he had on it looked sharp but brother brandham had him to change it this is Brother Billy Paul's testimony which I believe is true and if if brother Brandon was conscience like that of his ministry and his name and what he was representing so this is what happens if if if the standard is here then people mainly will come and live right up to that oh you said at 12:00 so we got in at 12:05 something like that you stretch the limits just a little bit so if the standard is here people live just what if this what if the standard is way down here well that's where the people are going to live and I'm so glad that the example that we have that is given to us he didn't let down the bars brother bam didn't let down the bars and so what should who who what should be our example now I I do give I know that we're not all supposed to look like you know look the same we do have our individual Styles and so forth and we want to look nice and you can look nice without looking like the world I believe that amen First Corinthians 6:19 and 20 says what know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and ye are not your own I want everybody to read that are you can you see that on the screen thank you so much they do a good job back there for you are bought with a price therefore glor therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods now salvation is so beautiful that it comes to you right where you are no matter how you're dressed no matter where you are when salvation comes to you it comes to your life it comes into your heart and these issues I won't even call them salvation issue salvation is a work that he did at Calvary a finished work and you accept that but your service to him and what willing to give up and really look at what the overall big picture in the effect of what you're doing starting even with the way that you dress how God sees that and it's very very important and I think we should be more conscious and aware of it especially in such a loose and elax atmosphere that we've seen today it's very loose very laxed and it's just just going to get looser and looser let's take 1 Corinthians 11 interesting the Lord Jesus doesn't speak too much about clothing huh he let His prophets do that huh now look at this order here and we'll get into this under the order and under the gatekeep keepers part of this this little I'm going to take five 10 more minutes all right right now I Praise You Brethren that you remember me in all things first Corinthians but I would have you know verse three that the head of every man is Christ the head of the woman is the man the head of Christ is God every man praying or prophesying having his head cover dishonor his head but every woman that prayeth or prophesy with her head un un covered dishonor her head for that is even all one as if she were shaven for if the woman be not covered let her be also Shor but if it be a shame for a woman to be Shor or shaven let her be covered for a man in indeed ought not to cover his head talking about his hair long hair for as much as he is the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man neither was the Man created for the woman but the woman for the man for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the Angels nevertheless neither is The Man Without The Woman neither the woman without the man in the Lord for as the man is of the woman even so is the man also by the the woman but all things of God judging yourselves is it commonly that a woman pray unto God uncovered does not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him but if a woman have long hair it is her glory to her for her hair is given for what for covering but if any man seems to be contentious we have no such custom neither the Churches of God so here's a New Testament scripture the Apostle Paul great Apostle to the Gentiles he took the place of Judas really under the 12 God used him mightily and here he is instituting what's the big deal about your hair what's the big [Music] deal you know it's just hair it's like I cut my nails and you I can shave it I can do it this way I can do my I hearing why is it a big deal well it's a big deal because God said it was a big deal and these natural things they move right over into spiritual things remember in Timothy and in Peter it says uh to give honor to your wife and go on it goes on and says that your prayers be not hindered that's right he goes from women's clothes to your prayers being hindered and he goes to the examples so were the women in the old time that's the way they that's the way they dressed and here we have God's fingerprint all through the Old Testament on how to do and what to do and what not to do and all those details that he put in there and then somehow today it doesn't matter anymore if the let the world let the worldly church tell you that say it doesn't matter well it does matter and the Church of the Living God knows it does matter and the Church of the Living God you know a man is called to be a Christian in this hour sometimes we we put the pressure on the preacher it is true if you're called to be a preacher there's a life there's a standard there's a an example the people are watching you and looking at you but but also a man appr priest in the Old Testament and where we are on this side of Grace and Truth after Calvary we are Kings and Priests today offering the sacrifice of praise a spiritual sacrifice and if it was a deep I mean if we had time you can read it but if you took the time and just read in um in um Exodus 20 that we'll take two of these and then we'll close Exodus 20 verse 26 all right verse 25 it says and if thou Wilt make me an altar of stone Thou shalt not build it of hun stone for th th lift up thy tool upon it thou Hast polluted it neither shall thou go up by steps unto my altar that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon take Exodus 28 you see brothers that's just old that's just the Old Testament well let's not read it then let's get rid of the Old Testament if it's just the Old Testament somebody instituted it who did it's the very nature and character of God he he brought this to us Exodus 28 and this is just to show us where this where this came from where this all starts and how you can see the the standards that uh the message brings to us today Exodus 28: 42 and thou shalt make them linen breaches to cover their nakedness from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach and they shall be upon Aaron and upon his sons when they come into the Tabernacle of the congregation and when they come near un the altar to minister in the Holy place that they bear not iniquity and die it shall be a statue forever unto him and his seed after him so we thank God for his word these um these places you you go into court there's there's a judge there's a setting there's a there's a there's a certain professionalism there's a standard there at least in this country they um uh some of the the law law enforcement and our military and um things of great great importance are structured and they have an order to them and there's a discipline that goes with it and and I'll be honest yeah it takes a little more effort to dress it's so much easier just to throw on a T-shirt and come out here I mean wouldn't that be great if we all came in a t-shirt well no I don't think that would be great at all brother bam talked about a humble day where everybody we their overalls how many heard that quote talk about the church having a humble day we need to have I mean it's like every day is a humble day we need to reverse that I mean so I I trust this a blessing to you and just a reminder and what I was going to say was that you know Salvation the work of Grace the work of Salvation is a beautiful thing he'll find you where you are he'll deal with you right where you are whatever you just done whatever when you when that heart turns you you find that peace with God and Grace with God and then for the rest of your life you want to find yourself doing that which is pleasing to him everything that we do even the cars the way we carry ourselves in traffic the way we drive the way we our hair styles the way we man cut our all of that is you know and and we should be in consideration to is that pleasing to the Lord and not follow the crowd and what the rest of the crowd is doing so I trust that bless you and bless your hearts God bless you so we have some prayer requests here tonight every church has their little culture their music their style what they what they're into and so forth not critic izing what the other group might do or say but you know you have to have your convictions too so all right please remember Marian's grandson Ryan he is back in the hospital today after complications from his surgery last week want to remember uh this young man Ryan also God bless you brothers and sisters please pray for one of my students very nervous his mom Jenna is is going to have open heart surgery tomorrow please keep me in prayer I'm still searching for a job please pray for God's will in my findings that's from Brother Brent how many believe the Lord's got a job for brother Brent he already knows the job the Lord knows exactly where that job is and so we just claim that the Lord will lead him to that and the doors will open I want you to remember my sister Kim Kimberly my youngest sister she's got a serious health situation in her body she went for a biopsy for something going on in her her bones and her jaws and um but I'm praying that the Lord will turn her to back to a real committed life when I gave my heart to the Lord a lot of my siblings came to church and she was one she came to the church she got baptized and she came out of the water speaking in tongues God God really touched her and she's got you know she's a nice person nice uh she got her husband her nice little family
