========================================

[Music] [Music] Good morning everyone. Can we all stand? Another beautiful day in the house of the Lord. Let's open up in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're grateful to be alive. Grateful to be here today in our right mind, Father, and a healthy body, Lord, and knowing anything uh contrary, Lord, that you would overcome. Thank you for healing us, Lord. Thank you for the blood of Jesus. Father, all things have passed away and all things have become new. You've made us new creatures in Christ, Father. You're not just a patchup job, but a a new unit and we're grateful for that, Father. be with us in this Sunday school class and for the children and theirs, Lord. Everything that would be done this day, Lord, the preaching of your word. We pray, Lord, that your Holy Spirit would just rest upon everyone, Lord. Give us that spirit of worship for you seek such to worship you in spirit and in truth. Lord, and we'll give you all the glory. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we ask. Amen. We're going to be continuing with the uh message future home of the earth, heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride. We'll start at paragraph 125 and end after 181. And this comes from the scripture second Peter chapter 3, the whole chapter in Revelation 21 1-7. Can we sing only believe? Only believe. Only believe. [Music] All things are possible. Only believe. Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. Only &gt;&gt; you may be seated, brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; See the earth redeemed goes back to its original owner again. It took he took it from Satan. He pulled taken the earth away from Satan just like he took you away from Satan. &gt;&gt; Like he took the little woman at the well away from Satan. &gt;&gt; There stood the priest thought he was with God and he had nothing. &gt;&gt; See, I'd like to draw that for you just a moment. &gt;&gt; Now, we want to get this real clear. So now watch close now on this teacher. Now this shirt here is God. God which is the eternal without there's no one but him. But in God he had attributes. Now this here represents the word, the word of God which is made flesh to dwell among us in the person of Jesus. Now this year fellow here we're going to make him like this. Now this is called the woman at the well. This is the priest Pharisee and where you see this open blackboard means grace and salvation. Now in the beginning was the word and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. &gt;&gt; The three stages it was an attribute first was in God that he thought of himself as being human and that transmitted him down to be Jesus. Now, if you'll ever be there, you was with him then. &gt;&gt; For there's only one form of eternal life. &gt;&gt; That's God. &gt;&gt; And you had to be a part of God at the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not what you just chose down here. He chose you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the father has given me will come. &gt;&gt; Now look at this preacher. We find his bottom part here, his back life. Back behind him is predestination back here is sinful. Here's hell down here. Now this little part in here looks like the blackboard that represents is purity. He was a priest. He was an honorable man. That represented this. He was also had to be a good man or he couldn't be a priest. &gt;&gt; But you see how he got it was intellectual learning. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, this little woman, her first life up here, she's a prostitute. She was all marred up. But way down in here with just a little bit of understanding. I know when Messiah cometh. &gt;&gt; That was there. Notice when Jesus came and manifested the word because the word discerned the thoughts that was in the heart as Hebrews 4 uh says it will 4:12 that he would the word was a discerner of the thoughts of the heart and he came as the son of man the prophet what happened this priest with only intellectual learning said it's a devil &gt;&gt; because that's what his denomination called it. &gt;&gt; What did he do? He had no representation, so it blacked him out. &gt;&gt; But this little woman had nothing to present. She's as filthy and dirty as she could be. &gt;&gt; But notice way down in her, she's got representation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then she was looking for this to be made flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he said, "Go get your husband and come here." She said, "Sir, I have not." Said, you said the truth cuz you got five and one you have now. It's not yours. You've had five. That makes six you had. &gt;&gt; She said, "Sir, you're not be ely &gt;&gt; I perceive that you are a prophet." &gt;&gt; Now, we know the Messiah which is called Christ will come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he does, he'll do this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm he." &gt;&gt; No more doubt. &gt;&gt; It saw it. &gt;&gt; Away she went. Why? What did it do to her? It redeemed her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now watch. He came to be a redeemer. That's right. &gt;&gt; What does redeem mean? Bring back. &gt;&gt; Why didn't he get the priest? He never was up there. &gt;&gt; See, he had no representation. &gt;&gt; He came to redeem that which had fallen. Paul, this got messed up with that girl. But God had her in his thinking before the foundation of the earth. And he come to cleans her. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then he shut. Why? See where the priest, what did it do to him? It sent him right back to his destination. &gt;&gt; He had nothing to be good. Only intellectual learning. &gt;&gt; Now listen, friend. If the only thing you've got is just intellectual learning. You get something different from that. &gt;&gt; And you'll never be able to get it unless you got representation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the reason I believe you come from the east and west, north and south. Amen. &gt;&gt; The were living made manifest. &gt;&gt; Notice now &gt;&gt; how he makes his way known by his prophets in the beginning. He's never changed it. &gt;&gt; Salvation. He justified a man, sanctified him, sent the Holy Ghost and fire, burnt the sin out of him and dwelt in him himself. He does the earth that he's going to use in a plan of redemption the same way. It repented and was baptized in water in it by Noah. Jesus come and sanctified it by dripping his blood upon it and claimed it. And in the new earth is to come. It's to have a holy fire baptism to clean it of every devil, every germ, every sickness. &gt;&gt; Everything that there is and make it a new. &gt;&gt; I saw a new heaven and a new earth. &gt;&gt; You become a new person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just an old one patched up. by joining church or trying to turn a new page, &gt;&gt; but you are a complete brand new unit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God takes the old man and burns him completely out &gt;&gt; with the Holy Ghost and fire and it comes himself. &gt;&gt; Sends down your representation. No man can come to me except my father has drawn &gt;&gt; and all the father has given me will come to me. &gt;&gt; You see it? Amen. &gt;&gt; Same plan, same weight. Satan was will be taken from the earth. &gt;&gt; Just exactly like Satan was taken from you. &gt;&gt; Satan cannot bother or he can tempt. But he cannot get a bornag again Christian. &gt;&gt; For God from the foundation of the world foresaw him &gt;&gt; and sent Jesus to redeem him. And the blood speaks fine. &gt;&gt; How can he sin when it can't be seen even by God? &gt;&gt; He don't even The only thing he hears is your voice. &gt;&gt; He sees your representation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; by the same means for the world is one of his attributes just the same as you are one of his attributes. Amen. &gt;&gt; The world becomes one of his attributes because it was God's thinking &gt;&gt; in the beginning to have a world &gt;&gt; to be on a throne &gt;&gt; to be a king to be a redeemer &gt;&gt; to be a healer. &gt;&gt; That's his attributes. &gt;&gt; Just like an attribute of you. I can't say a post less I think a post. &gt;&gt; I can't say man less I think a man. That's right. &gt;&gt; And when I think a man then say man, the thinking is my attribute and the expression is a word. &gt;&gt; See like Isaiah, how could he say that a virgin was going to conceive? &gt;&gt; What is a thought? Now many of you wonder how them that discernment comes. I'm going to tell you. See, it's a word that I say and it isn't my thinking because I don't know. I don't know the thinking of it. How can I tell you who you are and where you come from when I don't know you? &gt;&gt; How can I tell you what you done 10 years ago and I never seen in my life? &gt;&gt; How can I tell you where you do and what you'll do 10 years from now? How do I know the future? But it is somebody else's thought. &gt;&gt; Let the mind that was in Christ be in you. Let the mind that was in Christ be in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, then it isn't your thinking. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's his thinking through you. &gt;&gt; And you're not expressing your own words, you're expressing his words. &gt;&gt; That's how many times a brethren gets confused on interpretation of tongues and things. See, they say things that's not right. They don't realize that that's Satan. &gt;&gt; You say in the garden of God, just wait till we get through. find out if it's not or not. The weeds and the wheat grow in the same field. &gt;&gt; They both live by the same sun in the same rain. &gt;&gt; But if there be one among you who's a prophet, I the Lord will speak to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if what he says happens, then that's me. &gt;&gt; Course he's not expressing his own. &gt;&gt; He's expressing my thoughts. My attributes are the things that has to come. I'll use his mouth to express them by. And after he said them, they've got to come to pass. &gt;&gt; Heavens and earth will pass away, but my word shall never fail. &gt;&gt; Isaiah said, "A virgin shall conceive." That settles it. She's going to conceive. What God said, he does. &gt;&gt; Oh, make known by his prophets all of his manifestations because it's his attributes of his thoughts expressed. Now, here was this little woman. She was one of his attributes. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, and there was a priest representing the light. &gt;&gt; He had learned it from the Bible. He had learned that God was God. He had learned that holiness is right. He was learned that there was a law of God. He had learned it because of an intellectual conception. And he was born in the right lineage. He was a Levite. But he only know it by intellectual conception. &gt;&gt; And when the light of the hour, see, he learned it. what had happened, &gt;&gt; not what was happening, &gt;&gt; what had happened. &gt;&gt; And when he found what was happening, his denomination said nothing about it. Therefore, you had no representation of it. &gt;&gt; But here was a redeemer on earth at that time to redeem those attributes of God. &gt;&gt; And she received it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; She never questioned it. &gt;&gt; She said, "When Messiah come and say, you'll do this now. Settle it." &gt;&gt; And she's seen it done. So he said, "I'm the Messiah." So that's settling. &gt;&gt; No more questions. She's what telling everybody else, "Come see who you are found." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These processes make us clean a temple for his dwelling place. Justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost with fire that does the cleansing of this temple. So as old world frame did not destroy by the waters when it was washed off. the frame of the planet, the old frame, the all the dirt, all the uh stuff that God put on the earth was not destroyed when the first world was destroyed in the Bible said it was destroyed. &gt;&gt; But it never destroyed the frame. &gt;&gt; It just destroyed the sin and sinners that was on it. Amen. &gt;&gt; The framework remained. But you see, as justification, as you baptism Methodists want to think of it, just justification, believing and being baptized, that's not enough. &gt;&gt; You wander right back into the things world, blob your hair and wear shorts and everything else. &gt;&gt; See, there's nothing happened yet. &gt;&gt; You just look back and seen you done wrong. &gt;&gt; What did justification do to the world? never done a thing to it. Started right off again. Just as much sin as it ever was. &gt;&gt; That's the way a man does. And that's all the farther he goes. &gt;&gt; That's way the great evangelist Billy Graham to see. He said, "I'll go and have 30,000 converts come back in a year and a got 30." &gt;&gt; That's all the farther they went. &gt;&gt; See, they surely they repent. I believe they repent. Most of them or some of them at least. But that isn't what it takes. It proves it here. Now, so the old world framework was not destroyed by the water. The world was only washed off. &gt;&gt; That got us baptism. &gt;&gt; It was baptized. So will the framework remain though it be burnt by fire. &gt;&gt; It don't destroy the earth. See, it just destroys the sin that's on it. &gt;&gt; Notice here some of you Bible students, especially Dr. Dale, looking at me. Notice in Peter in the second chapter of Peter your third chapter rather he uses the word world as a Greek word cosmos which means the world order the earth shall pass away melt the elements with fervent heat. See, doesn't mean that the earth, the planet's going to pass away, but the world cosmos, the politics, the sinners, the systems, sin, disease, germs, everything that's wrong will pass away. &gt;&gt; Everything that once God shook the heavens, but this time he said he'll shake the earth, &gt;&gt; heavens and earth, he shook the earth rather than this time he'll shake the heavens. &gt;&gt; See, for we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved. &gt;&gt; It's a eternal kingdom. Watch how it goes to it. Notice here Peter said, "And will melt with fervent heat, and the works therein burn up." &gt;&gt; Not the planet, the works therein. &gt;&gt; The works of man, all their politicians and their schemes and all their denominations and man-made schemes will all go with it &gt;&gt; when it burns. And and heavens will pass away with a great noise. Did you notice here? Heavens will pass away with great noise. Listen, the whole earth will be on fire and will ignite the gases that's in the earth and explode it. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Talk the Bible said here, Peter said, "And the heavens will pass away and earth with a great noise." &gt;&gt; Such an explosion will rock it. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Cause it's got to kill every disease, every thistle, every thorn, everything there is to be done. The fire will burn it up. &gt;&gt; And remember, it's not altogether just a literal fire. It's also a holy fire. &gt;&gt; See, that will take away Satan. All of his, &gt;&gt; all the devils, both heaven and earth, amen, &gt;&gt; will pass away, killing all the germs, all insects, all natural life on it and around it. Even the H2O, the water will explode. &gt;&gt; Think of it. &gt;&gt; Talk about a noise. You think that little noise I hear in Tucson was something when he opened the six seals that shook the country around about and caused the talk. Wait till this earth receives our baptism. &gt;&gt; You know when a man receives the baptism of fire, there's a lot of noise around there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They think that's shame to hear people scream and shout like that. Just wait till this earth gets her baptism. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It'll explain exploit the H2O, the water. For the Bible said here in Revelation 21, and there was no more sea exploit. This will change the whole surface of the entire earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She'll burst and blow to pieces. &gt;&gt; All the outside the crust and for hundreds of feet below it, it'll just simply be completely demolished. That's right. &gt;&gt; The atmospheres, the gases that's in the earth now where they're finding these missiles that can't get to it. A great sphere up in there way up in some kind of a sphere that there's all kinds of gases they say and that'll burst. &gt;&gt; The holy wrath of God will come upon it &gt;&gt; and will cleanse it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Will change the entire service. Now, many of you won't put on this word, the Greek word pass away. It comes from the word I had to find. I thought, how's this world going to pass away? And yet, we're going to live on it. But if you'll notice, some of you people wants to put it down and I'll spell it for you. I couldn't pronounce it. P A R E R E C H O M I A. I don't know how to pronounce it. Now that way as I said when I get the inspiration strikes me for something then I go back to find out the word now here I can't spell the word I can't I can't pronounce it but in that the Lord is still give me a way I go and find out what that word means then I got it &gt;&gt; then I got it again see heavens and earth will pass away now this word means passing from one form to another &gt;&gt; it does not mean annihilation as the English word would mean pass away. It's annihilated. But the Hebrew word or the Greek word here does not mean pass away. It means from passing from one thing to another. Look, but to pass from one condition, it says to another. Now notice Paul used it. If you want to read it now, put it down, you can read it later. And Titus 3:5, Paul is using this same word means regeneration of man. that man has passed from a sinner to a saint. Not completely annihilated. When a man's changed, he isn't annihilated, but he's a changed person. &gt;&gt; He's been changed from what he was to what he is. &gt;&gt; Not annihilating. Jesus used the same word in Matthew 19:28. Now, not 28:19 now. 19:28. He said to them, "You're set with me in my father's kingdom regenerated." You see, changed. When you're changed, he used the same word. And he used the same word when he said to the colt that loose the colt and let him go. Said the same thing at the resurrection of Lazarus. Loose him. &gt;&gt; Change him. &gt;&gt; He's been tied. Let him go. &gt;&gt; What does it mean? The earth will be loose from the grip of Satan. &gt;&gt; It'll be loose. It'll be loose from politics. It'll be loose from denominational religious systems &gt;&gt; to be used for the kingdom of God &gt;&gt; to be established here on the earth. But as long it's in the hands of Satan, politics, Satan the ruler of the earth, he owns it. It belonged to him. But now Christ has redeemed it. &gt;&gt; One time I was his property, but not now. That's right. &gt;&gt; One time that little woman was his property, but not now. &gt;&gt; He come to loose the grip of it. &gt;&gt; He loosed the grip of sin, of Satan upon my life, upon your life, and now we're not his [Music] Is it [Music] Heat.

Lord, as Lord, we hold these in our heart, Lord, and bring them before you in one mind and one accord. We pray, Father, that you'd intervene and flee him, Lord. We pray that you'd have mercy upon him, Father, Lord, and deliver him from this eye condition. Help his family through this time, Father. Lord, and if there's anything hereditary or whatever it may be, we pray that it would be moved out of the way, Father. And as you just deliver the the young child, Father, you said, "Let them come unto me." So, Father, we're bringing them to you this morning, Lord Jesus, for this preaching of the word that is going to be coming before us. May the sounding go out. May it fill every heart and mind to be more like Jesus. Lord, we need you this day with the communion service tonight.

We come here for to worship him in spirit and in truth. We like to welcome each of you to the house of the Lord. It's always a privilege to be gathered together in his in his wonderful name. Amen. Are you happy to be here? We're so happy to have each of you here. So, we pray that God will bless you richly. We uh will have an announcement at the end of the service. So, uh don't leave immediately. And um for those that are streaming on the um book up there, the stream, the service will end right towards the end there. Don't think it's a dysfunction, but uh we'll have an announcement. And so the group in Phoenix, we like to uh send our greetings to brother Art and the saints there. Um, I don't appreciate brother Stevie as much as I should Stevie Flores, but I was thinking about him and his hard work that he, of course, we all know brother Art puts in a lot of uh he's a very great um helper to us and to keep the the work going in um in Mesa and it's really a a commitment uh the musician you know, you really a lot goes to it. And so we appreciate Stevie Flores and Sister Angela and all the saints there and Mesa. So uh I think Stevie sings a special every service on Thursday night. Just be two people, five people, 15 people. He takes time and sings a song special. And I certainly appreciate that. I was just thinking about him today, thinking about each of you. Amen. And so, um, let's go right to the word of the Lord in the scriptures. Also, I thank the Lord for the good speeds. We don't see them, but they stream the service, so I just wanted to say hi to them. And why don't you all say hi to them. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Good speeds. Whenever they stream, um, they always send their support here. And um I mean to greet them, but I never do. So we'll greet them. Now in the Old Testament, Genesis chapter 32, we're going to take our scripture reading. Of course, we know this is the life of Jacob and his life leads him to this place that we find him here. In verse number 20, verse number 22, we'll just start right in the middle there. And he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two women servants and his 11 sons and passed over the Ford Jabbok. And he took them and sent them over the brook and sent over that he had. And Jacob was left alone. And there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh. And the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him. And he said, "Let me go, for the day breakth." And he said, "I will not let thee go except thou bless me." And he said unto him, "What is thy name?" And he said, "Jacob." And he said, "Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel, for as a prince has thou power with God and with men, and has prevailed." Amen. Take a scripture also in Jeremiah 29 verse number 10. When you have that, say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; It's nice to hear the Bible's turning pages, turning to the Holy Scripture. Verse 10. For thus sayeth the Lord, that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon, I will visit you and perform my good word toward you, and causing you to return to this place. For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Then shall you call upon me, ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you, and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart. Amen. Let us pray. Lord Jesus, we ask your blessing on your word today. Lord, bless me. Bless your people. We know your word is already blessed. We know that you are the great one. You're the lifegiver and you have the power to change our circumstance. And Lord, just one word from you is all any mortal needs. Just to hear the words of the heavenly father. &gt;&gt; Lord, speak to my heart. Speak to our hearts today. In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. May he speak to our hearts and may we listen. Amen. I think they're trying to still work on my mic there. Now, in the scripture, there is known in the book of Jeremiah 30:7 uh called Jacob's trouble. Alas, for that day is great, so that none is like it. It is even the time of Jacob's trouble, but he shall be saved out of it. Now, Brother Brandham makes a reference to that scripture or that phrase Jacob's trouble, and he calls it and he identifies it with the great tribulation. We know that up ahead of the road is a great tribulation. It's going to fall upon the earth and there's all sorts of tribulations and judgments that are taking place even as we speak. And the title of my message this morning is something is fixing to happen. Something is fixing to happen. And that's a fact. &gt;&gt; Now the question is what is that something? Um something's fixing to happen. I'm fixing to start preaching. Uh, some of you are fixing to start sleeping. Some of you are fixing to start listening. But something is fixing to happen. And in this great term, Jacob's trouble known as the great tribulation. We know that is a future event. But here Jacob now in his life. How many are familiar with the story of Jacob? getting the background of what he done to lead him to this point here. He's actually separating himself from his family. He's sending them forward. He sends them forward in orders. He sends them forward in groups and he has to separate himself from them. And I like what the scripture says. I think it's verse number 24. And Jacob was left alone. Leave me alone. Some of us need that time alone. Those precious moments where Jacob was left alone. And now he's beginning to look at where he is today and how he got to where to where he is. Let's follow him just a moment. Let's look back just what brought him to this point. Remember Isaac was 60 years old when Jacob and Esau were born. They were twins. Esau was the firstborn. Jacob was the second born. Esau had the birthright. He had the blessing. He had all the privileges of what a firstborn came with. And Esau is uh number one. Jacob is number two in the birth order in the family in the structure. There was nothing that Jacob could do to change his birth order. This is the order and this is how you were born. And by the way, your name is Jacob. Then the scripture tells us that in Genesis 25 that um Jacob actually purchases the birthright from his brother. Doesn't give us a direct age. He was some of the the commentaries, some of the scholars, some of the traditions say they're in their teens about 15 years old or so. Doesn't don't know if it matters, but they were young people, young men. and he sells or purchases his birthright from his brother. Then in Genesis 27, he's about 70 years old. So he leaves from being a teenager to about 70 when his dad is about to cross over and he steals the blessing from his brother. He's got to leave to go to um his family because Esau is quite upset. His life is in danger. He's 70 years old. And this is where he has his first, we'd say, one of his major visions of the ladder going up and down heaven, the angels ascendings and descending. He that's in Bethl. He arrives in Haran and he meets his wife to be Rachel. He marries Leah and Rachel. He's about 77 years old at the time. He begins to have children from the age of 77 to about 90 years old. He's having all of these sons, the sons of Israel, the sons of Jacob. He leaves Laban after 20 years in Genesis 31. He's about 90 years old. And here we find him at 90 years old, Genesis 32, wrestling with the angel of the Lord. The Bible says it was a man that he was wrestling with. Now, Brother Bham takes the scripture that we read in Jeremiah and he preaches a message entitled desperations. And he tells us that the reason why people are not desperate today is because a lack of love and that we should be desperate. And there's things that should cause us to be desperate. And after all that God has done for us, we really are living in whether you believe it or not, whether you receive this or not, the church, the world, we're living in a state of emergency. &gt;&gt; It is really, really dark. We heard it on the Sunday school where brother says that the atmosphere is filled with demons and devils and God's got to purify that. Where these evil thoughts come from? Where's the imagination? Why are we thinking these things? How is Hollywood able to make these movies and they're so graphic and they're so real and and the music and the church world and just trying to be by yourself. Evil thoughts will come to you. &gt;&gt; How many know what I'm talking about? &gt;&gt; You're filled with the precious Holy Ghost. Yes. But the evil, nasty devil still tries to anoint your thoughts. Amen. And we're living in a we're living in a a state of emergency. Um I mean if you just go back and I did a casual search of what our life was like before 911 and all of the laws that were enacted afterwards and now today it's just become normalized to us the way we travel. We the security they they didn't used to tap our phone conversations. They didn't have the legal right to do it. They weren't able to surveillance we uh American citizens with our freedoms the way they do today. But after 9/11, they changed a lot of laws where they can watch you without asking for your permission. And you don't even know you're being watched. The average American, the American citizen that we're walking around in our freedoms and our great freedoms everywhere is a video camera watching you, watching your steps. The airport travel alone. I mean, you used to be able to say goodbye to your loved ones at the gate. You can't even walk them up to the gate to say goodbye. You can't bring a drink of water. A mother can't bring too much breast milk through security. You got to take your shoes off. I think they just told us we could put our shoes back on this year just to go through security. It's a straight up hassle &gt;&gt; just to fly on an airplane. And we've all they they the Homeland Security they called it. They enacted these laws and they dropped them on us. Americans and we're living with it right now as we speak. They they called it the US Patriot Act, the Aviation Transportation Security Act, the Homeland Security Act, Enhanced Border Security, and the Visa and the and even traveling from one country to the next has all been heightened. It's a great long process and this only really affects the noncriminals. &gt;&gt; You're talking about putting a gun law in in practice. The gun laws are only going to hurt the good guys &gt;&gt; because the criminal ain't going to obey the law. I don't care what the law is. You can't have a gun. He's like, "Okay, a criminal is not listening to no laws. &gt;&gt; The only one it affects are people that actually obey the laws." This crazy law, I call it crazy, the seat belt law. And they're protecting us. Put your seat belt on. I was in Liberia. Every vehicle in Liberia, the windshield is cracked. Like this way, like this way, like that way. And I looked over at I didn't ask him about the windshield because we can get a ticket for that, our safety, right? I looked at the brother. I says, "Is there any laws for wearing a seat belt?" He looked at me and laughed. He says, "Yes, we have laws." He says, "But look around. People on motorcycles, people on any kind of vehicle, you can't enforce that. And by the way, who really cares about whether I have my seatelt on or not anyways? What difference does it make? But it's a law. We've we've given that up. All of these act the public health and security for bioteterrorism and intelligence reform because um of this great attack that happened on 911 which are coming up to its another anniversary to it. Also that was my brother Jay's birthday. I always remember that September 11th, Real ID Act 2005 was put into place. This is why, brother John, your birth certificate that you had all these years is not valid because the G was faded in one part of his birth certificate and they told him, "No, this is not you need to go verify this." Like, man, I feel like hitting somebody in their stomach. Like, I'm driving. I've been living here. I am John. What's your middle name? Gregory Yarro. That's who I am. But he went to renew his passport. I didn't put your business out there, John. He went to renew his passport. And there's the way, you know, the birth certificate was creased like that. One little spot where the G is. Everything else is correct, but the G. And there's another G in the front. And you, if you put it together, hey, that's a T. &gt;&gt; No. enhanced security. &gt;&gt; You want to take care and make sure you ain't a criminal. And so we've got along with that. We live with that. That happened. And then COVID hits in 2000s, right? What year did CO hit us? &gt;&gt; 2020, right? And after COVID hit, there was a direct effect. And I and I say it it absolutely went against the scriptures for us laying hands on the sick and us coming together. And look at the crowd of people that stay home when they can get in their car and actually be in the house of the Lord. We have given them the option to stay at home and stream the service. And not just this service, any service. And you can sit in the comfort of your home and listen to the pastors from all over the world &gt;&gt; and feed on that and find that in the word of God where that applies to the little local fellowship and how you're supposed to be gathering together. That was a direct attack. We didn't have a streaming service in our church until co that's when we developed our ability to stream. It is a blessing. Yes, it can be useful. Yes. And the saints use it. Yes. But there there can be a mentality and an abuse with it, too. Let's be real. &gt;&gt; Let's let's be for real. &gt;&gt; Um some saints travel two hours or more to come to gather here. Like they they'll travel to come to church here. And then there's other saints that live right here, including me, including whoever live right here. And we have the convenience of not being there. Co with this mandate that you must stay home, that you can't gather, was a nice opening for you to stay home from the house of the Lord. And I want you to I want you to show me or prove to me any other place of gathering where people should gather more important than the little local church in your neighborhood. &gt;&gt; I mean, think about it in your mind. What is what is more important to gather at for a group of people? &gt;&gt; Think of one. &gt;&gt; Right. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Somebody tell me. Give me the answer. &gt;&gt; Not the movie house. Not over here. some theme park, not at the mall. &gt;&gt; We're all going to meet in traffic. &gt;&gt; But there is a place that God designed for the Christian to gather together. Many Christians will do this here. I know I'm not in my space, but I'm in your space now. But Christians, many Christians will do this right here. They'll take a career. They'll take a job. They'll take an appointment that directly affects this place that they should be in the house of the Lord. And it used to be the old-timers would say, "If you can't be in church, you don't need that job." &gt;&gt; How much time do I got? &gt;&gt; Yeah. We come to church, we sit back, we'll judge what's being said, we run it through the filter of our mind, and every thought you're thinking is being recorded. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And every word and every deed will be given an account for. It's exactly the truth. You all know that's the truth. &gt;&gt; What has it done? has created this atmosphere of church people very difficult to pastor very difficult to worship very difficult to lead very very difficult to please &gt;&gt; we're competing with the internet and all that it has to offer &gt;&gt; and this co made it easier they they mandated it now if there's a country or the law said that you should stay at home, then you should give Caesar what Caesars's because coming to church doesn't save you. We understand that. And uh but if there's an opportunity to be there, I think that um you should be there. I think that should be the atmosphere. But it it's been made very very easy, very very convenient to transgress that one little portion there of coming together. Co allowed that and the laws that were changed and all of our thought processes when it comes to that. But, you know, I love our brother uh that came here and spoke a couple of Sundays ago and he he took those five planets or what was it? Seven planets. &gt;&gt; Seven planets that had lined up right here in February of this year and lined them all up. And then he read a quotation where brother Brandham said that something is always happening and that these things mean something. Although we don't know exactly what they mean, but they mean something. And then you look at the accumulation of the word and the darkness of the age that you and I live in. &gt;&gt; You know, we can sit in our car and go on a long trip for two hours or whatever hour or so. We can sit in our bedrooms for hours and multiple hours at a time doing whatever we do in there. We can stand in the kitchen. We can stand on the job site for hours and hours at a time to get a task done. and you come to the house of the Lord and you got to get up every 30 minutes and leave even when the tape is being played. &gt;&gt; They It's background noise to them. &gt;&gt; Um the Sunday school starts at 9:45. The greatest preacher of our generation is being played. &gt;&gt; If there ever was a call to attention for the soldiers of the cross, Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have time to hear the prophet. &gt;&gt; Something is something is off there. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about me. Something is off there. Now, brother Brandham takes the message desperations and he uses Jacob as an example. In part of that message there, I want to read something that he says right here in paragraph 52, 1963. Now, I believe that we're living in the days or otherwise the days that we're living in should cause the church to go completely into desperation. I believe since the message this morning from God, not me. I believe it ought to throw this entire congregation into desperation that we have played long enough. We went to church long enough. We got to do something. How is it that we can see other great signs and wonders done on others? And what about us? It should cause in a state of desperation that we are determined before God. The signs of his coming should bring this entire congregation when we read it from the word. The Holy Spirit has told us go at a certain place such and such a thing will happen. Not tell us what it was but it would happen. We go there. It happens that way. the newspapers packet, the magazines packet, shows the picture of it. Come back here and see those great mysteries hidden in the Bible open to us on a new field that we never know before and perfectly blends into the coming of the Lord Jesus. Then at the end of the message, see the action of the great Holy Spirit. see him come down visible before people. Even take pictures of it. See it working and showing that it's not a man. It's not just a preacher. It's not a certain congregation. It's the Holy Spirit showing the same thing it did when it was embodied in the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Now it's embodied in the body of his bride. It should throw us into desperation. So the prophet of God is now highlighting the message the token that he preached that morning and now he's bringing this message desperation which was a communion service message and he's highlighting the things that had taken place in his ministry and it really you know if you're not listening to it if you're not hearing it You won't be desperate. You won't know the signs of the time. &gt;&gt; And remember, the signs of the time are multiple. There are many signs that take place. But the coming of the Lord is a secret quick going away. &gt;&gt; When it happens, it happens. When the door closes, it closes. But the signs, there's years of signs, years of warning. like Jacob had years of an accumulation of these behaviors that he finally had to deal with. He took from his brother. He deceived his daddy. He got the blessing. He deceived his father-in-law. He got on. He kept moving forward. And God is speaking to him. And then finally he gets the word that Esau is coming to see you with 400 men. &gt;&gt; They're coming to see you. &gt;&gt; They're not going on vacation. &gt;&gt; I want to meet you. I want to see you. I want to talk to you face to face. &gt;&gt; And Esau was a strong man. Esau wasn't playing games. &gt;&gt; Esau was serious. That message came to Jacob and it shook him. He had been going along like this too long. &gt;&gt; You know, we read the scripture on on Wednesday, the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availth much. Brother Brandham says the effectual fervent prayer is a prayer of desperation. When a saint prays in desperation, God will hear their prayer. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, brother Israel, there's nothing to worry about. There's nothing. Just relax." We have a couple of different schools of thought around the message that I've been a I've been a part of. I've seen it. There's this one uh school of thought is that we have everything that we need and just relax. There is no more move of God going to happen. There is not going to be a great outpouring before the rapture. Everything is on the tape. The stabilizers have been set and we're just going to cruise right on into the resurrection and the rapture. Just stay faithful. Pay your tithes and offerings. come to church. And even if that means you make your own church at home, just do that. Listen to the tape. Relax. If you listen to your tape, you're good to go. God's not going to leave you. Long as you're playing those tapes, you're good to go. That is a lie from the devil. &gt;&gt; That is not on the tape. Listening to the tape is listening to what the tape said and then actually doing &gt;&gt; doing what the tape said. &gt;&gt; No more than the Catholic priest at his time of reading of the scripture that everybody's okay just because he read the scripture. &gt;&gt; You're not obeying that word. How many's ever been to a Catholic uh church service? Brother Chris was raised. I've been to one. Every time I've been to a Catholic thing, I've been blessed because the priest reads the scripture. &gt;&gt; And then they might, you know, they have their little bells and little things and all the other stuff. You just let that roll off. But the scripture was nice. &gt;&gt; The scripture was on. &gt;&gt; And if you actually listen to it, &gt;&gt; you can walk out of the Catholic church with a praise in your heart. Thank you Jesus for the word. &gt;&gt; That's where the word of God is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But just listening to the word, listening to the priest, listen to the Bible is not enough. You got to have you got to hear that word &gt;&gt; and then in hearing it will move move you and motivate you. So the prophet is taking this um desperations and he's putting it on the people in a very humble simple way and he's calling their attention to the things that just happened in our generation. &gt;&gt; Remember these pictures that we see in the prophets ministry. Remember the one in San Jose where that glory of the Lord is surrounding him and the picture there of the what he said was Ezekiel &gt;&gt; from the waist upward a amber light &gt;&gt; in the scripture. You you don't get that picture every day. &gt;&gt; It's not a churches didn't have that picture. Science progressed and we can now see &gt;&gt; what's going on. &gt;&gt; It ought to throw us in desperation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Something's fixing to happen, saints. &gt;&gt; The signs are here upon us. &gt;&gt; The darkness is upon the nations. &gt;&gt; We see that there is a time where the believer must examine himself. &gt;&gt; The coming of the Lord will be a sudden secret going away. There won't be special meetings to remind you that the coming of the Lord is happening today. &gt;&gt; Won't be no texts or no email. The coming of the Lord is going to happen today. It's a sudden secret going away. &gt;&gt; But the signs, the wonders, the signs, the signs, the signs are pointing to it. Pointing that's multiple. That's years and years of signs. But when it's time for them to go, swoop &gt;&gt; and the door was shut. &gt;&gt; Just like that. &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness? &gt;&gt; I'm going to close just now. But let me let me let me read something else out of desperation. Paragraph 55. Those people had seen the hand of God that night of the communion. They took it with desperation because they know that something was fixing to happen. And we know something is fixing to happen. &gt;&gt; And remember the coming of the Lord will be a sudden secret going away. &gt;&gt; He'll come and take her like a thief in the night. And to think that if somebody all of a sudden there is members of our family gone and you're left behind, &gt;&gt; it should throw us into desperation. &gt;&gt; That by the grace of God will not be left behind. &gt;&gt; If there's anything I don't want, don't leave me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Is that your prayer today? Lord, don't leave me here. &gt;&gt; Please don't leave me here. &gt;&gt; It ought to throw us into desperation. &gt;&gt; All right. Here the prophet of God, paragraph 59, he says this. This lays the prophet. I have two more quotes. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Or three. All right. He says, "Jack Moore said to me one time, I hate to have to answer like you will have to answer to at the day of judgment. God has put these people into your hands and you're going to give an account for every one of them. You're going to answer for your ministry." That's about 15 years ago or maybe 18. And since then, I've been in desperation. What will I do? Let me say only what you say. Lord, let me tell them what's the truth or don't say nothing. It throws me in desperation. When you hear Brother Brandon preach, does he preach like a man in desperation? &gt;&gt; Does he preach like a man on fire? &gt;&gt; Does he preach like he's sin in another dimension? when he's screaming out against the worldly isism that creeped into the churches. That's a man that's that's preaching under desperation. &gt;&gt; That's a man that knows the hour that we're living in. &gt;&gt; I thank God for a ministry like that. &gt;&gt; Not lulling me to sleep, but every single tape catching me, building me molding me into the stature of a perfect man. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 60. Then seeing these signs coming, see the Holy Spirit take us out there and bring these seals, lay them in like that. Bring the church ages, lay them in, then come down in a great big pillar of fire back there and revealed himself. then come down on the next thing on the seven seals and revealed it. Even put it in the papers in the magazine. Then come in and take the angels of God, them seven angels with seven messages and confirmed it exactly what the Bible said. Then during that time, come up and bring those seals, those signs, uh flashes of the end time and bring it up to the people. Tell them what it is all about it. The Lord working right through showing himself present and then write down like this morning. Come up and require that token on every person. Then you're my people. You're the ones that I love these and them is listening to the tapes and so forth. Then you see what desperation it puts me in. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see what desperation it puts me in. Took my towel. Paper towel. Grab me a paper towel quick. Somebody quick. Levi just grab it. Thank you. So here the prophet is bringing this desperation showing that these things accumulated. He's bringing it up all the time. Is that right? The signs of Holy Spirit and bringing it in desperation. It ought to throw us who are listening into desperation. Thank you, son. It ought to throw us into desperation. Is that right? Or do we want a more comfort sermon? We want a, you know, a nice, comfortable, don't get into that. Don't mess with me. Don't push on that. Don't, you know what? That's just not reality. &gt;&gt; That would be disrespectful to you and your soul. &gt;&gt; That wouldn't be right. Look, look at this. What if what if you're responsible for a group of people that's listening to you? What if you each individual at the end of the day he's going to pull you to the side and says you are responsible for all of these people here 5 10 20 whatever you're responsible for them. See it throws you it's a different atmosphere &gt;&gt; than just falling asleep than just you know taping out some quotes and then just throwing them out there. No, no, no, no. You got to be down on your knees. You got to be in prayer constantly. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then at the end, you want to you want to clear you want a clear conscience, &gt;&gt; right, Brother Caleb? You want to clear you want to be able to say, you know, I did what I was supposed to do. I did exactly what you told me to do. You put it on my heart. I didn't know it, but I said it the way you I felt like you wanted me to say it. And then you're clear. I'm free from all men's blood. And then it's in God's hands then, right? And that's what this message has done. Now, he says this in paragraph 127, God in the last days has manifested himself so to us by his great signs and power, it should make us desperate. That's right. And is willing to heal us and save us ought to throw us all into desperation to get to that healing stone. That's right. One final point I want to bring in this in the me in the same message desperation says now it ought to throw you into desperation. It ought to electrify this place and touch a not just be like a a match to a barrel of powder. Certainly, it ought to um No, just be like a match to a barrel of powder. Certainly. And it ought to explode the faith and love and desperation drive them people right into the kingdom of God to believe with all their heart. Do you believe now every one of you? All right. Now, here's what brother Vanom gives us. The reason why we're not desperate. Okay. This is the reason why it's so easy for us to lull away and tiptoe and relax and as the scripture says sleep in Zion. Um in paragraph 67 he says this here. I believe that the reason we don't have desperation is because it's a lack of love. God, the love of God, I think the love of God causes desperation. If God is in you, the token inside of you, and you see the condition of the times and people waiting in sin the way they are, it'll throw you into desperation. I believe it will. You remember after 911, September 11th, when the when the Twin Towers were attacked in New York? Do you remember the You remember the the entire news cycle? It it engulfed all of the news. That's what everybody talked about. Do you remember how the churches were full? &gt;&gt; You remember how people got baptized? Do you remember that? Do you remember their awareness and the awakening that you know what I need to be right with God? But what happened to that awakening? What happened to that awareness? I wonder if we could see when the sword came down in the prophet's hand right here in Sabino Canyon. and we could see that message going forth in its fullness. I wonder if we was at the tabernacle and God could open our eyes like he did to brother Billy Paul one time in that hotel room. Brother Brandham covered his face with the pillow and he says that his daddy woke him up two or three o'clock in the morning. He says, "Billy, the the the the the being the man that I I talked to you about that he's always company my ministry." Yes, Daddy. He says, 'Well, he visited me tonight this morning. And I asked him &gt;&gt; if I can show you and show Howard uh who you were. He says, "You can show Billy." He says, "So, his daddy took his pillow." Now remember, Brother Billy knew his dad wouldn't lie to him. Brother Billy knew that his dad was telling the truth. Brother Billy saw the signs, wonders, and miracles, but he had never seen that man. &gt;&gt; And then Brother Bam, Brother Billy says, Brother Bam took the pillow off of his face. He said, "There standing in the corner was a man &gt;&gt; with a rainbow over him. And he said that from that time forward, if he was in the meeting, he can tell when that man came into the room again. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Billy Paul was a great witness of this message. &gt;&gt; He He witnessed this message like a man who saw an angel in the room. &gt;&gt; Was he a true witness? Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Sure he was. &gt;&gt; He wasn't playing with this message. And some of us have met Brother Billy. How many's ever met Brother Billy Paul? &gt;&gt; How many's ever shook his hand? Was he real? Was he a Christian? &gt;&gt; Was he believable? &gt;&gt; You think he's lying? Now, I never met Brother Brandham, but I had the privilege of meeting Brother Billy Paul. He lived right here in this city. &gt;&gt; And like out of all the people that can live in the city where brother Billy Paul, God honored you to be a part of that. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Have you been up to his den room? How many been up to brother Madden's den room? How many How many's been up to Sabino Canyon? Do you know how many believers in South America and and in Africa would love to be in Sabino Canyon? &gt;&gt; Would love to go to Sunset Mountain. And when they come here and you're with them for the first time, it rejuvenates your faith. &gt;&gt; It ought to throw us into desperation &gt;&gt; that we actually saw something. We're actually a witness of something. &gt;&gt; We are the believers that actually follow what these brothers hear about on tape. &gt;&gt; God help us. God bless us. We should be living in desperation. Now, we know something's going to happen. What's it going to be? What's the next one? Huh? Has all the national tragedies, have they all been filled up? How many people prophesied that COVID would happen? Huh? How many of us knew exactly this is going to be a worldwide crisis and some of us would even criticize one another for going to church or leaving our doors open? How many knew that was going to happen? Well, brothers and sisters, something else is going to happen. It's it's always that way there. What's the next move? What's the next thing going to happen? God help us this day of trouble that Jacob found himself in or Jacob's trouble. We'll call it Jacob's troubles cuz he had many of them. And they led him up to that spot where he got desperate. You go forward. I love you, but you go forward. I love you, too, but you go forward. And the Bible says Jacob was left. Let's read it real quick one more time as I close. Genesis chapter 32. What verse do I want, saints? Huh? My brother said verse 24, Genesis 32:24. And Jacob was left alone. And there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of day. Brothers and sisters, we all need this happening to happen to us. &gt;&gt; We need to get a hold of something that is real. Something that can change our name. something that can change our circumstance, our situation, something that I I'm willing to wrestle with all night long. I wonder what that wrestling match looked like. &gt;&gt; You know, one of the privileges I would like to have on the other side. But I'd like to be able to go back and see some of the events of the Old Testament, &gt;&gt; like when Moses parted the Red Sea and Jesus Peter walked on water and all the great miracles. I would love to see this battle between a a a sster, Jacob, a deceiver and an angel. Brother Brham says that he actually prevailed over the angel. &gt;&gt; And he asked the question, can a man prevail over God? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; What's greater, a man or an angel? Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Huh? Who told you that? &gt;&gt; Dr. James Doppson didn't tell you that. The great leaders out there didn't tell you that. They they can't tell you that. They got things to say that are helpful, but they can't tell you this. The prophet said that a son of God has more authority in heaven than an angel that's never sinned. I'm talking about a son of God, a daughter of God, a man that's been washed in the blood, &gt;&gt; has authority, All these demons and devils in these neighborhoods and on our job sites and on our computer systems, we got the power to overcome every one of them. &gt;&gt; If you're a son of God, &gt;&gt; if it takes all night long, how many of you wrestling with something right now? Don't give up. The angel The angel pulled one on him. The angel tow out his oblique or two out. I don't know what that muscle would be called, but he touched him. Crippled him up. John, did he quit. I going to let you. The angel said, "Let me go, man. Come on, Jacob. Stop playing. The sun is coming up. Stop. I'm not playing with you. &gt;&gt; Let me go, man. I can't let you go. Let me go. I can't let me go. I will not. &gt;&gt; I won't let you go until you bless me. Until you heal me, until you deliver me, until you change me, until you make me more like I'm supposed to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'd love to see that. &gt;&gt; Jacob wrestling with an angel. That'd be worth seeing, right, Father Tim? I wonder what strategy he used. Got him in the headlock and just flip him over. Try to take off. No, come here. I ain't done. Roll around. Get back. Get back over. I ain't done talking to you. Angel's like, "This conversation is over." over. No, it is not over. &gt;&gt; I can't let you go till you bless me. What's your name? My name is Jacob. Okay, here's the problem. I'mma change your name and I'm going to bless you. &gt;&gt; And when the Lord changed his name &gt;&gt; and blessed him, now I can meet Esau. &gt;&gt; I'm ready to meet Esau with 400. Nothing to be afraid of now. Is that right, somebody? &gt;&gt; It's a dark terror of terrible age that we're living in. &gt;&gt; Terrible age that we're living in. But greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. And God will always hear a desperate soul, a desperate prayer. And I'm just talking about throwing a prayer out. I'm talking about a desperate prayer where it's between life and death. God help us. God bless us. &gt;&gt; May God keep us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Family need that in your life. &gt;&gt; Lord, I won't let you go till you bless me. You got to get alone with God sometime, huh? You got to get alone. I love coming to church. I love the worship and fellowship with you. But every Christian in order to survive in this age, mom, dad, young person, whoever you are, you have got to get alone with God and find those sacred moments where he can reveal himself to you. Can you hear me on that? Can you saints hear me on that? &gt;&gt; It's not a church experience. You can't live off of each camp meeting or each special meeting. You got to get along with God. And Jacob was alone to himself and there he met a man. And that's what we need to do tonight. I have one last quote I want to read for you. It's in the message the invisible union. And the prophet of God says this here. There's several places we can go talking about this last day in the end time signs. And he says paragraph 28 in the invisible union the then the solemn warning in the last book of revelation of Jesus Christ. Whosoever shall add a word or take a word away his part will be taken from the book of life. Oh God, knowing seeing how fragile we are, knowing that we're walking on the brittle threads of life of this mortal life, not knowing what time that we're going to be summoned to answer on high. Let us, oh Lord, lay aside everything in our heart, everything in our mind, and look straight to your word tonight for you to come and interpret it with living oracles. Granted, may your spirit fall upon us and anoint the word to our heart that we might go from here this evening better people than we are now. That we might have a closer insight on Jesus Christ. Granted, Lord, that we might understand the day that we're living in and the preparation of God for his people in this hour, this great, crucial, dark time that we're now living in. God, anoint us not only speaker, but hearer, and together make our hearts to tremble at your word. For the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. Grant these things, Father, we ask in Jesus' name. Amen. May he quicken us to the time that we now live in. Something great is fixing to happen. There's a there's just a, you know, there's darkness. There's things taking place. We see it. We know that something is happening. Something's going to happen. And we uh want to be ready now. Amen. That's what the scriptures do us. They prepares us before the tragedy strikes because tragedy is going to strike. And some people say, "Well, when it strikes, then I'll go pray." No, your time to pray is now. Your time to study is now. Your time to be aware and to be awake is now. Amen. and this message. The rest of Tucson, I don't know what proportion of Tucson has heard the message of William Brandham. A great portion, many, many people know nothing about what happened in Sabino Canyon. I mean, thousands of visitors go there every year. We go up there, there's people going up there, they're jogging, they're for their exercise, they're visitors, they're going up. They have no idea what took place up there. &gt;&gt; Isn't that something? But we know what took place &gt;&gt; and that's why we live the way we live. And so God bless us and help us to continue to live deeper closer closer walk with him. Now if the musicians would come &gt;&gt; tonight we'll be observing the Lord's supper. Appreciate brother Art Salceto. He'll be coming down to help with that. We certainly miss brother Joe and pray that the Lord will bring him back him and Timmy back safely. and we will observe that tonight. And we just like to say to the saints on the stream, we certainly appreciate you joining us together with the service uh today. We will look forward to you coming and being a part uh with our next meeting, our next service time. But we will uh close this service and ask God's blessings upon each of you. Amen. Let's sing that song. Um when the world's on fire, Lord, let my your pillow be my bosom. What's that script? What's that song? My loving brother. When?
