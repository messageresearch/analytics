[5:34] prayer?
[5:39] [Music]
[5:45] Father God, as we come here before your
[5:47] presence, Lord Jesus, as we come here to
[5:52] give our all and all, Lord,
[5:56] and turn our hearts and our minds
[5:59] towards you, Lord, and we may be filled
[6:01] with your Holy Spirit, Lord, that you
[6:04] may come here, Lord, and be in our
[6:06] midst, Lord, and walk among these these
[6:08] aisles and fill our hearts with joy,
[6:11] love, whatever we need tonight, Lord
[6:13] God. And please bless everyone who is
[6:16] here, those visitors and the musicians,
[6:19] those in the back as well, the person
[6:21] who is going to be ministering to us
[6:23] tonight, Lord. Please, Lord, may you be
[6:27] speaking through him to us, Lord. I ask
[6:31] all these things in Jesus Christ's holy
[6:32] name.
[6:35] [Music]
[6:36] Amen. Amen. And we have a special
[6:39] service. It's always a special service
[6:41] when we come together. It's not because
[6:44] we have a special speaker. It's because
[6:45] we have a special God. And he deserves
[6:48] our praise. He deserves our worship. We
[6:51] don't praise him. The rocks will cry
[6:52] out. And I don't want that to happen. I
[6:54] don't want a rock to take my place. So,
[6:56] amen. Let's just create an atmosphere
[6:58] that lives can be changed tonight. And
[7:01] not looking around, lives can be changed
[7:03] ourselves. Lord, draw me closer to you.
[7:05] Prepare me to be a sanctuary, pure and
[7:07] holy, tried and true. Amen. Just before
[7:11] we're seated, maybe we can sing that
[7:12] chorus. Key of B flat. When I come into
[7:14] his presence, I humble
[7:17] myself. Amen. When I come into his
[7:23] presence, I humble myself.

[8:48] verse. I humble
[8:50] myself and

[8:56] presence, I
[8:59] humble. Remembering what he's

[15:51] go. I felt like I just couldn't take
[15:55] life anymore.
[15:59] My problems had me
[16:02] bound. Depression weighed me down. But
[16:05] God held me close so I wouldn't let
[16:11] go. God's mercy kept
[16:14] me so I wouldn't let

[16:55] breakthrough but couldn't see
[16:59] it. The devil really had me but Jesus
[17:05] came and grabbed me. He held me close so
[17:10] I wouldn't let
[17:12] go. God's mercy kept
[17:15] me so I wouldn't let

[24:50] Brother Sean, if you could come and
[24:52] prepare to sing for us as well before we
[24:55] take up the offering, the request that
[24:56] we have this
[24:58] evening. Amen. Just I was visiting with
[25:01] somebody today and it was that Psalm 48.
[25:04] Great is the Lord and greatly to be
[25:06] praised and just started talking about
[25:09] that and you know we were just singing
[25:11] about that. Great are you Lord great is
[25:13] your mercy and and we could go on and on
[25:16] about his greatness. But the second part
[25:19] on that, greatly to be praised, that
[25:21] falls on us. So greatly to be praised,
[25:26] his greatness is worthy of a great
[25:28] praise from us. And so that's our all.
[25:30] We want to give our all to him. And you
[25:33] think of David, all the instruments that
[25:35] he made that he praised him on, and he
[25:36] couldn't find one that did the job. It
[25:38] was like, I need another one to get this
[25:40] across. He's he's too He's too awesome.
[25:42] I can't just play this one on the harp.
[25:44] This one requires something else. And so
[25:46] I just thank him for his goodness and
[25:48] the gifts that he's given to us and the
[25:50] talents that are here. And I'm just so
[25:52] thankful for everybody wanting to use
[25:53] those for his honor and glory tonight.
[25:56] Amen. Brother Sean, appreciate you
[25:59] taking the time to prepare something as
[26:02] well. Amen. Happy to be in the house of

[39:07] Thank you,
[39:11] Lord. Before the choir comes, we have
[39:13] one more special song special this
[39:15] evening. Our brother Benuit snuck in
[39:18] here
[39:19] and Joel. Joel, I'm sorry. I knew it was
[39:22] Joel and I I apologize for
[39:25] that. Amen. So, um, we were discussing a
[39:30] couple songs in the back and wasn't sure
[39:33] which direction he'd go. So, I'll let
[39:34] him decide who he wants to accompany him
[39:37] tonight. So, depends on the song you're
[39:39] going to sing.
[39:41] So, all right.
[39:44] Amen. Let's sing one chorus. Is there
[39:47] coming? That's all right. That's all
[39:49] right. Let's go straight into the
[39:55] song, man. Good to be back in shalom
[39:58] tonight. God bless you all. Amen.
[40:00] Appreciate you all having me again. And
[40:01] uh I'm definitely not brother Ben Puit.
[40:04] Uh I'm I'm the better looking younger
[40:06] brother if he's watching. So
[40:13] John sings this one. I can't do it like
[40:15] brother John and my voice is not great
[40:17] tonight, but uh if you know it, sing it
[40:19] with me. Aren't you glad he said we can
[40:21] still go free? Amen.
[40:24] Oh, you can
[40:27] lock me
[40:29] up in a
[40:34] prison and
[40:37] throw
[40:39] away the
[40:44] key. You can
[40:47] take
[40:50] away my vision.
[40:55] from these
[40:57] eyes that
[41:00] now now can see.
[41:05] [Music]
[41:08] deprive me
[41:10] of the
[41:13] food I
[41:16] eat and
[41:18] even
[41:20] bite my
[41:23] hands and my
[41:25] feet. But as
[41:28] long as
[41:30] I know
[41:32] [Music]
[41:35] Jesus, then
[41:38] I can
[41:40] still go
[41:44] free. Oh, he said that
[41:48] I could
[41:50] still go free.
[41:55] Oh, tell me what
[41:58] kind of a
[42:00] man would reach
[42:03] down his
[42:05] hand and do this for
[42:10] [Music]
[42:12] me. Even
[42:15] me. Oh, I was
[42:19] unworthy to live.
[42:22] I was not
[42:24] fit to kill. But then a man
[42:29] on the cross, he had my name
[42:34] in his will and said that
[42:38] I could
[42:41] still go free.
[42:46] Well, I
[42:49] never
[42:51] could
[42:53] quite
[42:56] understand why a
[42:58] king would ever
[43:01] leave his throne.
[43:06] Oh, to
[43:08] dawn
[43:11] himself in the
[43:13] robe of
[43:15] man. Feel the
[43:18] pain of
[43:20] flesh. Flesh and
[43:22] [Music]
[43:25] bone. And then to
[43:28] later
[43:30] walk down that
[43:33] lonely
[43:35] path that
[43:38] led to Calary.
[43:45] Oh, where those
[43:47] blood red
[43:50] stains washed
[43:52] all sin
[43:55] stains so that
[43:57] I could still I could go
[44:03] free. Oh, he said that
[44:07] I could
[44:09] still go free.
[44:14] Oh, tell me what
[44:17] kind of a
[44:19] man would reach
[44:22] down his
[44:24] hand and do this for
[44:29] [Applause]
[44:31] me. Even
[44:34] me.
[44:35] Oh, I was
[44:38] unworthy to live.
[44:42] I was not
[44:43] fit to kill. But then the man
[44:48] on the cross, he had my name
[44:53] in his will and said that I Oh, I could
[45:00] still go free. Can you sing it with me
[45:03] one time? Oh, he said that I I could
[45:09] still go
[45:13] free. Oh, tell me what
[45:16] kind of a
[45:19] man would reach
[45:21] down his
[45:24] hand and do this for me.
[45:31] So even
[45:33] me,
[45:35] so
[45:38] unworthy to live. Oh, I was not
[45:43] fit to kill.
[45:46] But then the man
[45:48] on the cross, he had my name
[45:52] in his will and said that I Oh, I could
[46:00] still go free.
[46:04] Oh, but the man
[46:07] on the cross, he had my name
[46:12] in his will and said that
[46:16] I could
[46:18] still go
[46:23] [Music]
[46:29] free. I am so thankful for that. He said
[46:31] we could go free. How many want to
[46:33] accept that pardon that we've been given
[46:34] tonight? Amen. If the choir could let's
[46:37] all stand as the choir comes and we'll
[46:39] just sing a chorus as they get the stage
[46:43] ready for
[46:44] that.
[46:47] Hallelujah.
[46:49] Amen. Maybe we could just sing. How
[46:53] great is our God. How great is his
[46:56] word. How great is our God.

[47:20] waters of the mighty Red
[47:25] Sea and he said, "I will lead
[47:30] you. Just put your trust in me." Sing it
[47:34] to him one more time. How great is our
[47:38] God.

[47:45] word? He's the greatest
[47:50] one that ever was

[55:42] Let's give the choir another hand of
[55:44] praise.
[55:46] Amen. Praise the
[55:50] Lord. Did an excellent job. I thank the
[55:53] Lord for them. Amen. God bless each of
[55:55] you. We're so happy to be in the house
[55:57] of the Lord with you this evening. We
[56:00] come forward to we come tonight to hear
[56:02] the word of the Lord. And I believe the
[56:05] Lord has something very special for us.
[56:07] Do you believe that he has something for
[56:11] you? God's got a blessing with your name
[56:14] on it.
[56:16] There's a song that says that. Amen. So,
[56:19] as our brother Andrew Glover, I met him
[56:22] some years ago at brother Wesco's church
[56:24] and I I saw a post where he said that
[56:27] brother Wesco was his hero. I think that
[56:29] was one of the So, it shows you the
[56:31] caliber of brother. This is a young man
[56:34] when I met him. He wasn't married at the
[56:37] time. He was trying to trace those years
[56:39] back there at brother West. But I so
[56:42] thoroughly enjoyed him and his position
[56:44] on the word of the Lord. Amen. a real
[56:48] bonafide evangelist and minister. He's
[56:51] been all over preaching the word of the
[56:53] Lord. How many here have heard him
[56:55] preach before? Amen. How many's never
[56:57] This will be your first time. Oh, quite
[57:00] a few. All right. So, he let him shock
[57:03] you a little bit. I'll let
[57:05] him. Very fine brother. Totally. The the
[57:09] reason we haven't had him over the
[57:11] years, it just never worked out. And I
[57:14] feel like chastising him a little bit
[57:16] because he gets in and he gets out, but
[57:18] he has a very tight schedule. And this
[57:19] time he let me know that he was in the
[57:22] area. So we squeezed on him. And we got
[57:25] a special treat to have brother Joel
[57:27] with us here tonight, too. And so uh he
[57:31] preached for us some time ago. How many
[57:33] remember that? Wasn't that a blessing?
[57:36] And an excellent singing and and known
[57:38] Joel all his most of his life as well.
[57:42] young preachers, young ministers, and
[57:44] I'm young, too, but young ministers.
[57:48] Amen. That hold on to the word of the
[57:50] Lord as we was trying to respect our
[57:53] elders this morning. As I like to uh
[57:56] take my um allegiance to the ministers
[57:59] and pastors that have held on true to
[58:02] the word and they heard all of the lies
[58:04] and all of the negative and all of the
[58:06] this and they stayed with it over the
[58:08] years. And so there's some young ones
[58:11] coming up too. And I believe Brother
[58:14] Andrew is part of that caliber of
[58:16] people. So as he prepares to come um and
[58:20] he's making his way Oh, he's here. Thank
[58:22] praise the Lord. Yeah. Talk about him
[58:24] behind my back, but he's behind my back.
[58:27] So all right, brother Andrew. We love
[58:30] him. He since been married and has one
[58:33] or one little boy. Amen. And I'll let
[58:35] him introduce himself, his church, and
[58:38] the pastor that he's working with and
[58:40] under. But for a number of years, he was
[58:42] with brother Roy Shrewberry. How many
[58:44] remember him? Old faithful saint. And so
[58:48] he's just around good people. Brother
[58:50] Andrew is. And so as he prepares to
[58:52] come, let's sing that old hymn of the
[58:54] church, Amazing
[58:57] Grace.
[59:00] Amazing
[59:02] grace, how
[59:05] sweet, sweet the
[59:08] sound that
[59:11] saved a
[59:13] rich like me.
[59:19] I
[59:21] once was
[59:24] lost, but
[59:26] now now I'm
[59:29] found. I was
[59:32] blind, but
[59:35] now I see. Let's lift our hands and say,
[59:39] "Praise God." Praise
[59:42] God. Praise God.

[59:48] Hallelujah. Praise
[59:50] God. Praise God.

[1:01:05] tonight? Amen. There's one thing we know
[1:01:07] he inhabits. Amen. The praise of his
[1:01:10] children. Amen. And there's one thing I
[1:01:12] believe will change any situation is a
[1:01:14] little bit of praise. Amen. When you
[1:01:16] begin to praise God, he'll actually come
[1:01:17] and sit right in the middle of the
[1:01:19] situation. And he said, "I am the Lord
[1:01:21] and I change not." And amen. I'm
[1:01:23] thankful this evening to know that he's
[1:01:24] the same yesterday. Amen. Today and
[1:01:26] forever. And amen. Want to say God bless
[1:01:28] you all tonight. It is a a real special
[1:01:31] honor to be here with you tonight. And
[1:01:32] amen to be with our friend, brother
[1:01:34] Israel Po and his family in the church
[1:01:36] here. And amen. We met Brother Israel.
[1:01:38] He said there several years back at
[1:01:40] brother West Coast meetings and amen I
[1:01:42] was just down there a few months ago at
[1:01:43] brother West Coast and amen I was
[1:01:45] sitting there in the back room and I was
[1:01:46] thinking of those days those meetings
[1:01:48] and amen I told brother Mike the pastor
[1:01:50] there now I said there were times in
[1:01:52] here it felt like the walls were
[1:01:54] breathing in this place. Amen. Just the
[1:01:56] power of God moving and Amen. But I tell
[1:01:58] you the wonderful thing about it is that
[1:02:00] same God is right here in this building

[1:02:04] brother Israel and enjoyed his ministry
[1:02:06] there many times in those services.
[1:02:08] Really left an impression on us. And so
[1:02:10] it is a real honor to be here tonight.
[1:02:12] And we bring you greetings from our
[1:02:13] pastor, brother Matt Morris, the saints
[1:02:15] there at Grace Tabernacle in Black
[1:02:17] Rockck, Arkansas. Amen. I was preaching
[1:02:19] somewhere I think was it brother Sangers
[1:02:21] the other day and he told me he said if
[1:02:23] you got to have a visa to go there and I
[1:02:25] said no. I said it's a part of America.
[1:02:27] Amen. So amen. But we bring greetings
[1:02:29] from the saints there and sure glad to

[1:03:43] platform tonight that has been built, oh
[1:03:45] God, for the preaching of the message of
[1:03:47] the hour that you've sent in this age.
[1:03:49] We're so thankful for it, Lord. Father,
[1:03:52] we thank you for the years of labor and
[1:03:53] efforts that your servant, Brother
[1:03:55] Israel, has put forth in this community,
[1:03:57] Lord, to hold up this insign of the word
[1:04:00] that you sent in this hour. Now, Lord,
[1:04:02] as we come here tonight to join our
[1:04:04] little lick of fire together with these
[1:04:05] believers. And Lord, we know that when
[1:04:08] believers get together, something good
[1:04:09] always happens. Lord, we're not gathered
[1:04:12] here tonight under the banner of a man
[1:04:14] or a tradition, but oh God, we're
[1:04:16] gathered here under the great banner of
[1:04:18] Jehovah. Lord, you said wherever the
[1:04:20] carcass is, there will the eagles be
[1:04:22] gathered together. And Lord, tonight
[1:04:24] we're inviting you to come among us in a
[1:04:26] special way. Lord, Father, may this be
[1:04:28] another Emmas roadwalk experience, Lord.
[1:04:31] Father, may you move me aside, Lord,
[1:04:33] that the people would not see me or hear
[1:04:35] me, oh God, but Lord, that they would
[1:04:37] hear your voice as it would speak
[1:04:39] through your word. Lord, may you drive
[1:04:41] out every spirit that's unlike the Holy
[1:04:43] Spirit. And Lord, if there be any
[1:04:45] sicknesses here, oh God, you're Jehovah
[1:04:47] Rafa. Lord, may the may the healing
[1:04:49] virtues of Calvary flow through those
[1:04:51] bodies, Lord, for bound hearts and
[1:04:53] minds. I pray, Lord, you would come as
[1:04:55] the great emancipator, Lord, and bring
[1:04:57] deliverances, oh God. Lord, may may
[1:04:59] questions be answered here tonight, dear
[1:05:01] Father. Lord, may lives be changed, not
[1:05:04] because we were here, but because you
[1:05:06] were here. Uh, Lord, we surrender
[1:05:08] ourselves into your hands for your use.
[1:05:10] Forgive us of our failures and
[1:05:12] shortcomings. Lord, transform us by your
[1:05:14] word. We pray in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:05:17] ask these things and all the believers
[1:05:19] says amen and amen. Psalm 62 and verse 5
[1:05:24] David here says my soul wait thou only
[1:05:28] upon God for my expectation is from him.
[1:05:33] He only is my rock and my salvation. He
[1:05:37] is my defense. I shall not be moved. In
[1:05:41] God is my salvation and my glory. Now I
[1:05:44] love this. He is the rock of my strength
[1:05:47] and my refuge is in him. How many knows,
[1:05:50] brother Bram says that a rock represents
[1:05:52] a revelation. So we could very easily
[1:05:55] say that David's revelation of his
[1:05:57] strength and his refuge was his God. Now
[1:06:00] in the book of Proverbs, one book over,
[1:06:02] Proverbs chapter 24, Proverbs 24 and
[1:06:07] verse number 13. Proverbs 24 and verse
[1:06:11] number 13. Here Solomon writing. He
[1:06:16] says, "My son, eat thou honey because it
[1:06:19] is good and the honeycomb which is sweet
[1:06:22] to thy taste." How many knows the Bible
[1:06:24] in Revelations 10 tells us that book
[1:06:26] would be like honey? In verse 14, he
[1:06:29] says, "So shall the knowledge of wisdom
[1:06:32] be, notice this, unto thy soul when thou
[1:06:34] hast found it. Then there shall be a
[1:06:37] reward." I love this. and thy
[1:06:40] expectation shall not be cut off. Amen.
[1:06:43] So if there's an expectation in the
[1:06:45] heart of a believer, there has to be a
[1:06:47] satisfaction to that expectation
[1:06:49] somewhere. Thy expectation shall not be
[1:06:53] cut off. And one other place I want to
[1:06:55] look is in the prophet Jeremiah, the
[1:06:57] book of Jeremiah, the 20th chapter.
[1:06:59] Amen. I know we could read this verse
[1:07:01] here by heart. In Jeremiah chapter 20
[1:07:05] and verse number nine, Jeremiah writing
[1:07:08] here, he says, "Then I said, I will not
[1:07:10] make mention of him, nor speak anymore
[1:07:13] in his name, but his word was in mine
[1:07:17] heart as a burning fire shut up in my
[1:07:21] bones, and I was weary with forbearing,
[1:07:24] and I could not stay." Amen. We ask Lord
[1:07:26] this evening to add the blessing to the
[1:07:28] reading of his of his word. As you can
[1:07:30] have your seat here this afternoon, if
[1:07:32] the Lord would help me for just a few
[1:07:34] moments tonight, if I would uh take a
[1:07:36] title here, I want to talk to you on
[1:07:38] this. Expectations lit by the message.
[1:07:41] Amen. Expectations lit by the message.
[1:07:44] And you know uh maybe just to uh make a
[1:07:47] uh bold declaration to start off of what
[1:07:50] I believe. Amen. I believe that the
[1:07:52] message of the hour, amen, has come by
[1:07:54] the Elijah of Malachi 4. I believe it
[1:07:57] has come for the purpose of putting the
[1:07:59] church into an atmosphere of
[1:08:01] expectation. I believe this message come
[1:08:04] to grip you. I believe it come to move
[1:08:06] you, to elect you, amen, to capture you,
[1:08:09] to apprehend you, amen, to select you,
[1:08:12] amen, to be a participant in the
[1:08:14] rapture, amen, and in the resurrection.
[1:08:17] Now, I'll just have to say it the way I
[1:08:19] believe it. The message of the hour
[1:08:20] came, amen, to set you in expectation
[1:08:24] for what God promised in his word could
[1:08:27] be fulfilled in our lives. Now, amen,
[1:08:29] just to lay a foundation here, Brother
[1:08:31] Brandon would say at 1953, he said,
[1:08:33] "I'll tell you what the church needs
[1:08:35] today," Amen. is an oldtime Holy Ghost
[1:08:38] fire kindled under her. He said, "Glory
[1:08:40] to God, that's what we need." He said,
[1:08:42] "Fire will move the church and nothing
[1:08:45] else." Again, what is the Holy Ghost
[1:08:47] 1959? He said, "Seeing the revival fires
[1:08:50] begin to dim, let us throw on wood of
[1:08:53] the word that it might kindle a new
[1:08:55] fire, amen, that our hearts would be
[1:08:58] full of zeal." Again, in 1962, convinced
[1:09:01] and concerned, he said, "What we need is
[1:09:04] lives lit." Amen. What we need is lives
[1:09:07] lit. Amen. A flame with the power and
[1:09:09] the resurrection of Christ. Amen.
[1:09:12] Shining forth in the same kind of light
[1:09:14] that he gave. another place 1963 just
[1:09:17] once more he said send down a rain of
[1:09:21] God's holy fire and lighten our souls
[1:09:23] Lord amen with the presence of Jesus
[1:09:26] Christ now we know that the Bible says
[1:09:28] in Matthew 3 that Jesus or rather John
[1:09:31] the Baptist said I will baptize you with
[1:09:33] water amen repentance he said but
[1:09:36] there's one coming after me amen who is
[1:09:39] mightier than I and he said and he shall
[1:09:41] baptize you amen with the Holy Ghost and
[1:09:44] with fire. Amen. I love in in Hebrews
[1:09:47] 12, Paul would say, Amen, that our God
[1:09:49] is an allconsuming fire. Amen. Brother
[1:09:52] Brandham says it like this. He said,
[1:09:54] "God cleanses his prophets by fire."
[1:09:56] Amen. Not by theology or by some book of
[1:09:59] some kind. Amen. But he cleans his
[1:10:01] people by fire. Amen. That's Holy Ghost
[1:10:04] and fire. Amen. Not by declaration of
[1:10:07] creeds or a book of something that
[1:10:08] you've got to learn. Amen. A bunch of
[1:10:10] prayers. No, he cleans them by fire off
[1:10:13] of the altar. He said that's how he sets
[1:10:16] him in order. Now, what I find very
[1:10:18] amazing, Amen, is the same way that God
[1:10:21] cleanses his prophets, Amen, is the same
[1:10:23] way he cleans his people. He said, see,
[1:10:26] not by learning or by a bachelor of
[1:10:28] heart, amen, but getting holy fire from
[1:10:31] heaven, amen, that takes the lying off
[1:10:33] of your lips. It takes the carnality out
[1:10:36] of you and burns that stuff away. Amen.
[1:10:38] the draws of the world and puts his
[1:10:40] presence in there. Amen. And lives
[1:10:42] through that person. Amen. A holy fire
[1:10:45] is what God cleans his church with.
[1:10:48] Amen. God does not cleanse by knowledge.
[1:10:50] Amen. He cleans by fire. I've met people
[1:10:53] and they say, "Listen, Amen. We want
[1:10:55] Jesus. We want Jesus. We want Jesus."
[1:10:58] Amen. But we don't want none of that
[1:10:59] word. Amen. Well, the prophet said that
[1:11:01] Jesus is the word. He said, "So you
[1:11:04] can't have Jesus and not have the word."
[1:11:06] Amen. because they are the self-same
[1:11:08] thing. And some people around our ranks,
[1:11:11] Amen. They want the Holy Ghost, brother.
[1:11:13] Amen. We want the Holy Ghost, but they
[1:11:15] don't want no fire. Amen. But you can't
[1:11:17] get the Bible Holy Ghost. Amen. Without
[1:11:19] getting the fire that comes with it.
[1:11:21] Listen, I don't think we need more
[1:11:23] doctrines. I I don't think we need more
[1:11:25] creeds or more doctrines. Amen. What we
[1:11:27] need is the fire of God. Amen. To return
[1:11:30] in the church of God. Listen, somebody
[1:11:32] say, "Well, amen. The world's creeping
[1:11:34] in." Amen. It's cuz the fire is going
[1:11:36] out. Amen. But if the fire of God ever
[1:11:39] burns in a church, Amen. It'll burn out
[1:11:41] gossip. It'll burn out unbelief. It'll
[1:11:43] burn out lies. Listen, I say as a
[1:11:46] church, we ought to welcome the Holy
[1:11:48] Ghost and fire. We ought to welcome him
[1:11:50] in our pullpit. Listen, I think we ought
[1:11:52] to have fire in our singing. We ought to
[1:11:54] have fire in our preaching. We ought to
[1:11:56] have fire on the altar. We ought to have
[1:11:58] fire on the pews. Amen. From the front
[1:12:00] door to the back door. Amen. Ought to be
[1:12:02] the fire of God. Amen. burning in the
[1:12:05] church with authority and power. Amen.
[1:12:08] God don't send a church an icicle. He
[1:12:10] sends the church a fire. Amen. God
[1:12:13] cleanses by fire. Let me tell you why
[1:12:15] God cleanses by fire is because he wants
[1:12:18] you to become a direct reflection. Amen.
[1:12:22] Of that fire. That's why Jesus said that
[1:12:25] ye are the light of the world. You are a
[1:12:27] city that is set on a hill. Amen. That
[1:12:30] cannot be hid. Jesus said, "Men do not
[1:12:32] light a candle, and they put it under a
[1:12:34] bushel, but on a candlestick, and it
[1:12:37] giveth light unto all that are in the
[1:12:39] house." I love verse 16. Amen. So let
[1:12:42] your light so shine before men, that
[1:12:45] they may see your good works. Now watch
[1:12:47] this. They will see your good works, but
[1:12:49] they will glorify your father which is
[1:12:52] in heaven. So the fire of God is not
[1:12:55] bringing glorification to a man. It's
[1:12:58] bringing good works into the church, but
[1:13:00] it's sending the glory unto God. Now, I
[1:13:02] love in question answer 64, they asked
[1:13:05] brother Brandham, "Do you believe, amen,
[1:13:07] that signs should follow all who have
[1:13:10] the Holy Spirit?" I love how he answers
[1:13:12] that. He said, "Jesus said so." Mark 16.
[1:13:15] Amen. Amen. I love a prophet that just
[1:13:17] cuts to the chase and says it. Amen. He
[1:13:19] said, "But is it so?" Amen. people that
[1:13:22] believe the message with all that's in
[1:13:24] them yet they have not these signs. Are
[1:13:26] they unbelievers or do they need the
[1:13:29] Holy Spirit? If so, please instruct us
[1:13:32] today on how to receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:35] Now, I love what the question here says.
[1:13:37] Amen. We believe that you are God's
[1:13:40] mouthpiece for our day. Amen. So, I have
[1:13:43] not forgot that we are not our own
[1:13:45] mouthpiece. Amen. But according to
[1:13:47] Malachi 4 and Revelations 10, there
[1:13:50] would be a seventh angel would come to
[1:13:52] the church and he would be more than
[1:13:54] just a preacher. He would be more than
[1:13:56] just a teacher. He would be the
[1:13:57] mouthpiece of almighty God that has come
[1:14:00] in this age. Amen. To rebuke the
[1:14:02] confusion, to rebuke the tradition and
[1:14:05] to bring the realities of God, amen,
[1:14:07] back into the church. Listen, I'm one
[1:14:09] that still believes. Amen. He is God's
[1:14:12] mouthpiece.
[1:14:15] And I'll just say what he said. I'll
[1:14:17] just say what he said. You cannot
[1:14:20] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:22] without having an experience when it
[1:14:25] happens. You say, "Well, I believe every
[1:14:27] speck of it." He said, "The word is
[1:14:29] laying in there and it is waiting for
[1:14:31] the Holy Spirit, amen, to put it to
[1:14:33] work, but it takes the lighting of the
[1:14:36] candle." He said, "Now, here's the
[1:14:37] candle with the wick in it and with all
[1:14:39] the tallow, everything it has to have in
[1:14:42] that candle. Now, now look. But until
[1:14:44] the fire comes on it, it will not give
[1:14:47] any light. No matter how perfect the
[1:14:49] candle is, how perfect it'll burn and
[1:14:51] everything. Amen. It's got to be litten.
[1:14:54] Amen. And then it burns and further down
[1:14:57] until the Holy Spirit with a fiery
[1:14:59] experience. Amen. Comes down and lights
[1:15:02] that candle. Then you have not received
[1:15:05] the Holy Ghost. Listen folks, I believe
[1:15:08] the Holy Ghost, Amen, will bring a
[1:15:10] transformation into the heart of every
[1:15:12] individual. Listen. Amen. Somebody say,
[1:15:15] "How we going to get the makeup off our
[1:15:16] girls? And how we going to get the high
[1:15:18] heel shoes off?" And hey, can I preach?
[1:15:20] Amen. How we going to get televisions
[1:15:22] out of homes? Amen. I'll tell you why
[1:15:24] they're coming back in is cuz somewhere
[1:15:26] somebody Amen. changed the plum line of
[1:15:29] the church. But I'll say this, what a
[1:15:31] prophet said that was good 50 years ago
[1:15:33] is still good tonight. And a prophet
[1:15:36] said, "We must have the Holy Ghost." He
[1:15:39] said, "It is essential. It is
[1:15:40] compulsory. It is necessary that we
[1:15:43] receive the Holy Ghost or we're not
[1:15:46] coming in the resurrection." Now, I'll
[1:15:48] say this. Amen. We're not a bunch of
[1:15:50] grandchildren. Amen. Of God. We are
[1:15:53] children of God. Amen. By an experience.
[1:15:56] You know what John said? He said that we
[1:15:58] should be called, Amen, the sons of God.
[1:16:01] You know what a prophet said? He said
[1:16:03] the only way you can be a son and a
[1:16:05] daughter of God is because you have to
[1:16:08] have eternal life. He said the gene of
[1:16:11] your life, your spiritual life tonight
[1:16:13] was in God the Father before there was
[1:16:15] even a molecule. And you are nothing but
[1:16:19] the manifestation of the gene of life
[1:16:22] that was in God as a son of God. Well,
[1:16:26] glory to God. Amen. Now you're expressed
[1:16:29] after his word has come in you. Now why
[1:16:32] did his word come in you? Amen. To light
[1:16:34] up this age. You are the expressing of
[1:16:37] God's life in you. Because you are a son
[1:16:41] or a daughter of God. Another place we
[1:16:43] have become. Amen. From mortal beings
[1:16:46] from time beings to eternal beings. Now
[1:16:49] when did this happen? When the word of
[1:16:51] God, amen, lit our souls and we become
[1:16:54] sons and daughters of God with the
[1:16:57] attributes, amen, the gene of life of
[1:17:00] God in us to be sons and daughters of
[1:17:03] the father. Amen. God in heaven. Let me
[1:17:06] say this. Amen. We're not here, Amen,
[1:17:09] just taking up space. We're not here,
[1:17:11] Amen, just being religious people. But
[1:17:14] we are here as the direct manifestation
[1:17:17] of the quickening power of the Holy
[1:17:20] Ghost. Listen, we're not going back to
[1:17:22] God as a thought. We're not going back
[1:17:25] to God as an attribute. We are going
[1:17:27] back to God as a manifestation of his
[1:17:30] thoughts which were eternal thoughts
[1:17:32] which were before the foundation of the
[1:17:35] world. Listen, I feel so good. I feel
[1:17:37] like running right now. We're not here
[1:17:39] as church members. We are the bride of
[1:17:42] Jesus Christ who has been ordained to
[1:17:44] believe the things that we believe in
[1:17:47] the age that we're living in. Listen,
[1:17:49] we're not here, Amen, just taking up
[1:17:51] space. Amen. The word of God, the word
[1:17:54] of God has come into this age. Amen. And
[1:17:58] we're lit. Oh, glory to God. The word of
[1:18:02] God has come into this age and it has
[1:18:05] lit our souls. Now, when you look at
[1:18:07] this word lit, I love Webster's
[1:18:09] definition. He said to provide with
[1:18:11] light or lightning. He says illuminated.
[1:18:14] Now, I love this part. Having been
[1:18:16] ignited, set on fire and
[1:18:20] burning. Well, glory to God. You've been
[1:18:23] ignited. You've been set on fire, and
[1:18:26] you're burning. Brother Bam said like
[1:18:28] this, and he reads John 11, I am the
[1:18:31] resurrection and the life. Now he that
[1:18:33] believeth in me, Amen, though he were
[1:18:35] dead, amen, yet shall he live. And
[1:18:38] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[1:18:40] shall never die. I love that question.
[1:18:43] Believest thou this? Believest thou
[1:18:45] this? Rabb comes along and says, "Now
[1:18:47] see, amen. You are in him believing."
[1:18:50] Amen. Believe in me, not on me, being in
[1:18:54] him believing. He said, I chose this
[1:18:56] text, amen, to show you where we stand.
[1:18:59] Amen. Believing in him. And you cannot
[1:19:02] believe in him until you come in. And he
[1:19:05] comes in you, then you're believing in
[1:19:08] him, then you have eternal life. See,
[1:19:11] you're believing on him until you
[1:19:13] receive eternal life. But then eternal
[1:19:16] life is God's life in you. Amen. Then
[1:19:19] you're believing in him. What is it?
[1:19:22] It's God in Christ. Amen. And it's
[1:19:25] Christ in the church. It isn't you no
[1:19:28] more. Amen. It isn't you no more. Amen.
[1:19:31] It's the word that's in you. And the
[1:19:34] word is God. If the word is in your
[1:19:38] soul, then I can tell you tonight, deity
[1:19:41] is not in heaven. Deity is in the earth.
[1:19:44] It's in the redeemed flesh of the bride
[1:19:47] of Jesus Christ. Amen. Now, I just I'm
[1:19:50] just a country boy. Okay? Amen. So, I
[1:19:52] got to preach it the way I see it. Amen.
[1:19:54] I'll sit like this. Amen. Anybody can
[1:19:56] drive by this church and they can look
[1:19:59] over here at Shalom Tabernacle and
[1:20:01] Brother Israel, they can say these
[1:20:02] words, "I believe in what you're
[1:20:05] doing." They can drive by and say, "I
[1:20:07] believe in that church, man. I believe
[1:20:09] in what they're doing." Amen. But do you
[1:20:11] realize there's a difference in
[1:20:13] believing in something and believing in
[1:20:15] something? You say, "What's the
[1:20:17] difference?" Amen. The difference is,
[1:20:19] Amen. They can be on the outside and say
[1:20:22] they believe in it, but you're on the
[1:20:24] inside and you really believe in it
[1:20:27] because you're not on the outside
[1:20:28] looking in saying, "I believe what's
[1:20:30] going on in there," but you're actually
[1:20:32] in here believing in what's going on.
[1:20:36] Oh, God. Can I just say it to you? You
[1:20:38] are what's going on. You are the bride
[1:20:41] of Jesus Christ. Listen, I'm not outside
[1:20:44] of this message. Amen. Looking at it,
[1:20:46] saying, "I believe in it. I'm in Malachi
[1:20:48] 4. I'm in Luke 17:30. I'm in John 14:12.
[1:20:53] I am in this message. Amen. Believing in
[1:20:56] the word in the age I'm living in. Amen.
[1:20:59] What is it? It's his life. It's his
[1:21:01] dynamics in his mechanics that's in you
[1:21:05] that fires it off and makes it go and do
[1:21:08] the works that it promised to do.
[1:21:11] Somebody say, "Well, I believe in them
[1:21:12] books." Well, let me tell you who else
[1:21:14] does. The devil does. Well, I believe in
[1:21:16] them takes and the devil does, too. But
[1:21:18] there's a big difference in you and the
[1:21:20] devil. You are a part of them books. You
[1:21:22] are a part of them tapes. You are a part
[1:21:25] of this Bible. You are a part of the
[1:21:27] word. Listen. And the devil cannot take
[1:21:29] you out.
[1:21:32] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You say, "What's
[1:21:35] happening?" I'll tell you. It's what
[1:21:36] Paul said when he said the eyes of your
[1:21:39] understanding would be enlightened that
[1:21:41] you may know what is the hope of his
[1:21:43] calling. What is the riches of the glory
[1:21:46] of his inheritance in the saints? Look
[1:21:49] at this word enlightened. It means to
[1:21:51] bring to light. It means to cause
[1:21:53] something to exist and thus come to
[1:21:56] light and become clear to all. Now Paul
[1:21:59] follows that in Ephesians 3 and verse 8
[1:22:02] and says, "Unto me who am less than the
[1:22:05] least of all saints is this grace given
[1:22:08] that I should preach among the
[1:22:09] Gentiles." Now look what he's going to
[1:22:11] preach. He's going to preach the
[1:22:13] uncarchable riches of Christ. Somebody
[1:22:16] say, "Well, Amen. We got to go on beyond
[1:22:18] what brother said to find something to
[1:22:20] preach." Well, if you're a chicken, you
[1:22:22] do. But if you're an eagle, you don't.
[1:22:24] Amen. Because an eagle is wherever the
[1:22:27] carcass is. And folks, this is not a
[1:22:30] word that has an expiration date on it.
[1:22:32] This is an inexhaustible fountain. It is
[1:22:35] a reservoir. It is the uncarchable
[1:22:37] riches of Jesus Christ. It is the
[1:22:40] unfolding of the promises of God. It is
[1:22:42] the opening of seven seals. It is the
[1:22:45] sounding of seven thunders. It is the
[1:22:47] herd bull. It is the opening of the
[1:22:50] word. Listen folks, we're not a little
[1:22:52] fish in a little tank. We're are the
[1:22:54] rainbow trouts and we're drinking the
[1:22:56] waters of life and we're growing by the
[1:22:59] revelation. My goodness. Amen. The
[1:23:02] uncarchable riches. Listen. You can
[1:23:05] search and search and search and you
[1:23:07] still won't find them all.
[1:23:09] Look what he goes on to say in verse 9.
[1:23:11] And to make all men see what is the
[1:23:14] fellowship of the mystery which from the
[1:23:16] beginning of the world hath been hid in
[1:23:20] God. Come on folks. This was not hid in
[1:23:23] Jeffersonville. It was not hid in
[1:23:25] Tucson. It was not hid in Sabino Canyon.
[1:23:28] This message was hid in God from before
[1:23:32] the foundation of the world, who created
[1:23:36] all things by Jesus Christ. I love what
[1:23:39] Paul says to Timothy in 2 Timothy 1:8.
[1:23:42] He says, "Be not thou therefore ashamed
[1:23:44] of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me
[1:23:47] his prisoner, but be thou a partaker of
[1:23:50] the afflictions of the gospel according
[1:23:53] to the power of God who has saved us and
[1:23:56] called us with a holy calling." Look.
[1:23:59] Amen. Not according to our works, but
[1:24:01] according to his own purpose and grace,
[1:24:04] which was given us in Christ Jesus. When
[1:24:07] was it given to us, folks? Amen. before
[1:24:10] the world began. Can I say something to
[1:24:13] you? You are catching up in time with
[1:24:16] what God did in eternity. Listen, you
[1:24:19] weren't saved in time. You weren't saved
[1:24:21] at the altar. You were saved in the mind
[1:24:24] of God from before the foundation of the
[1:24:27] world. And the only thing that happened
[1:24:29] in time is you received what he done in
[1:24:33] eternity. Can I preach? Hey, I want to
[1:24:35] say it to you. And there ain't no devil
[1:24:37] can reverse in time what God sealed in
[1:24:41] eternity. Your name was put on the
[1:24:44] lamb's book of life from before the
[1:24:47] foundation of the world. Hallelujah. Now
[1:24:51] look what Paul says. He said this was
[1:24:53] given us in Christ Jesus when before the
[1:24:55] world began. But watch but is now made
[1:24:59] manifest. Glory to God. It is now made
[1:25:03] manifest by the appearing of our savior
[1:25:06] Jesus Christ who hath abolished death
[1:25:09] and hath brought life and immortality,
[1:25:12] amen, to light through the gospel. You
[1:25:16] say, "What are you talking about?"
[1:25:17] Brother Re said, "There's a great big
[1:25:19] difference in the sign of Jesus
[1:25:21] appearing and then Jesus coming." He
[1:25:24] said, "See, the appearing of the Lord is
[1:25:26] now when he's appearing in his people,
[1:25:29] his spirit working among them." Amen.
[1:25:32] Proven that it's him with him. Now, what
[1:25:34] is the appearing doing? It is getting
[1:25:37] them ready for the
[1:25:40] rapture. Can I just say it and get it
[1:25:42] out there and get it over with? You
[1:25:44] ain't taking a rapture without this
[1:25:46] message. Come on. Amen. Let me just say
[1:25:49] it. You won't pray your way in this
[1:25:50] rapture. You won't shout your way in
[1:25:52] this rapture. You won't fast your way in
[1:25:54] this rapture. Brother said, "It's going
[1:25:56] to take rapturing faith and it's going
[1:25:58] to take rapturing grace." Will you
[1:26:00] remember something? It's not rapturing
[1:26:03] works. You will not work your way in
[1:26:06] this rapture. It will be the grace of
[1:26:08] God that'll put you in this rapture. You
[1:26:11] say, "Then where are we going to get
[1:26:12] rapture in faith? Where are we going to
[1:26:14] get rapturing grace?" God has sent a
[1:26:16] message which was the uncarchable riches
[1:26:19] of Jesus Christ from before the
[1:26:21] foundation of the world. Hallelujah.
[1:26:24] That's why the devil wants to shut up
[1:26:26] these books. That's why the devil wants
[1:26:27] to turn off these tapes is cuz he knows
[1:26:30] if you ever get a revelation of who you
[1:26:33] are, it'll put you in the rapture. But I
[1:26:35] want to tell that devil, he's too late.
[1:26:38] Hallelujah. That devil's too late. I'm
[1:26:41] already sealed in by the grace of God.
[1:26:44] I've already got rapturing faith. I've
[1:26:47] already got rapturing grace. Devil,
[1:26:50] you're too
[1:26:51] late. You're too late, devil. The coming
[1:26:55] of the Lord is to catch away his bride.
[1:26:58] I love this. God sent us the message of
[1:27:00] the hour that our eyes would be
[1:27:03] enlightened to the promises concerning
[1:27:06] us. Now, let me just say this. The
[1:27:08] message of the hour, it must be received
[1:27:11] as the divine message. Again, Paul says
[1:27:15] in 1 Timothy or 1 Thessalonians 2, for
[1:27:18] this cause also, we thank God without
[1:27:21] ceasing, "Because when you receive the
[1:27:23] word of God, which you heard of us, you
[1:27:26] received it not as the word of men, but
[1:27:28] as it is in truth, now look at this.
[1:27:31] It's the word of God which effectually
[1:27:34] workketh also in you that
[1:27:38] believe." Now, what was the prophet's
[1:27:40] battlecry from 47 to 65? only believe.
[1:27:45] Come on. Amen. What was his theme song?
[1:27:49] What did he stand on platforms and say
[1:27:52] over and over? Amen. It don't matter if
[1:27:54] you feel it. You just got to believe it.
[1:27:57] Somebody said, "Well, I don't see
[1:27:58] nothing." Well, Brother Ram said it very
[1:27:59] beautiful. He said, "You don't have to
[1:28:00] see nothing and you don't have to feel
[1:28:02] nothing." He said, "But you do have to
[1:28:04] believe something." Amen. You don't have
[1:28:06] to see nothing. You don't have to feel
[1:28:08] nothing, but you do have to believe
[1:28:09] something. Listen, folks. That's why the
[1:28:11] devil's done everything he can to
[1:28:14] replace the faith of the son of God in
[1:28:16] the church of God. He knows all things
[1:28:19] are possible. Amen. To them that
[1:28:21] believe. That's why the prophet of God
[1:28:23] said, "He who will lend his ear and want
[1:28:26] to know the words of truth, amen, will
[1:28:28] find the spirit of God enlightening
[1:28:31] him." Now, I don't want to I know some
[1:28:33] of us are getting to know each other for
[1:28:35] the first time, but let me just say
[1:28:36] this. There are different degrees of
[1:28:39] reception of this message. And I've been
[1:28:42] been preaching since I was 13. I gave my
[1:28:43] heart to the Lord when I was nine. Got
[1:28:45] baptized, received the Holy Ghost. I've
[1:28:47] been preaching since I was 13. Amen. 15
[1:28:49] years of my life. Amen. I've been
[1:28:51] studying this word and looking at these
[1:28:53] promises. And I was telling brother Joel
[1:28:55] the other day, I said, "The hardest
[1:28:56] thing for me when I started traveling
[1:28:58] around and preaching was realizing
[1:29:00] people said they believed the message
[1:29:03] and then they didn't want you to say
[1:29:04] what the messenger said." I remember I
[1:29:07] remember as a 16-year-old kid standing
[1:29:09] in the pastor's office. He said, "Now go
[1:29:10] out there and preach, but don't quote no
[1:29:12] quotes." I thought, "Well, what is this,
[1:29:14] a Baptist church?" Amen. Listen, if
[1:29:16] we're the message, then we ought to
[1:29:18] receive it as the message. I have found
[1:29:21] that many people receive this message
[1:29:24] under different receptions. Some receive
[1:29:26] it as just a good idea. Some receive it
[1:29:29] that Brother Brandon was a prophet. Some
[1:29:31] received just the first pull. They just
[1:29:33] received the second pull. Amen. But let
[1:29:35] me say this. To receive the full benefit
[1:29:38] of the message, you've got to receive it
[1:29:40] at the same level that it was sent to
[1:29:43] you in.
[1:29:46] Can I say it? Can I get it out there?
[1:29:49] And this is a fiery message.
[1:29:53] It's a fiery message. So, in other
[1:29:55] words, Amen. I love what said. He said,
[1:29:58] "People might say our church, our
[1:30:00] brethren, well, the cooling off of the
[1:30:02] message and so forth." I love his
[1:30:04] answer. It ain't cooling off. Well, that
[1:30:07] ought to make you put your shouting
[1:30:08] shoes on. Amen. Somebody say, "Well, the
[1:30:10] message is cooling off." Well, maybe
[1:30:12] your view of it cooling off or your
[1:30:14] homemade theology is cooling off, but
[1:30:17] this message is still burning with the
[1:30:19] same fire and the same passion and the
[1:30:22] same anointing that it was delivered in
[1:30:24] 50 years ago. The church might be
[1:30:27] cooling off. Amen. But I'll just go
[1:30:28] ahead and say it. And and can I take my
[1:30:31] liberty? Amen. Amen. People, they I'm
[1:30:34] sorry, folks. I'm not polished. They say
[1:30:36] some dumb things. They say things like,
[1:30:39] "Well, we ought to get people to me to
[1:30:41] Christ and then get them to the
[1:30:43] message." Well, I'm sorry. That's a dumb
[1:30:45] statement. Amen. Because what is this
[1:30:47] message? This message is not a church.
[1:30:50] It's not a idea about Jesus. This
[1:30:52] message is Jesus Christ. Somebody say,
[1:30:55] "Well, we got to get them to Christ.
[1:30:56] Then we'll get them to the message." How
[1:30:58] can you get somebody to this message and
[1:31:00] not get them to Christ? Brother Brandham
[1:31:02] said, "This message is Christ." He said,
[1:31:04] "It's token hour. It's zero hour. It's
[1:31:07] time that we quit talking about the
[1:31:09] token and we apply the token and get
[1:31:12] underneath the message."
[1:31:15] Hallelujah. I'll say when I believe, I
[1:31:17] believe this message is
[1:31:19] Christ. And I believe what a prophet
[1:31:21] said. He said, "When man stepped across
[1:31:23] the message of the hour, it brought
[1:31:25] death and chaos to the whole human
[1:31:27] race." He said, "Now that's how much the
[1:31:30] message means." Now, I'll just say it
[1:31:32] like a prophet said it. He said, "The
[1:31:34] first church was established on the day
[1:31:36] of Pentecost." He said, "The true church
[1:31:39] which was born at Pentecost, which is
[1:31:41] the Christian church." He said, "Now God
[1:31:44] is infinite and he cannot change." He
[1:31:46] said, "Then his church must remain as it
[1:31:49] was at the beginning." I love this
[1:31:51] statement. He said, "But man has
[1:31:54] tinkered with it."
[1:31:56] He said, "Man has tinkered with it and
[1:31:58] put their own interpretations in it." He
[1:32:01] said, "Don't you never try to interpret
[1:32:03] the word of God. You just say what it
[1:32:06] says and don't care how it is. You just
[1:32:09] line up with it. Do not change the word.
[1:32:12] The Bible said the scriptures is not any
[1:32:15] private interpretation." Now, I'm just
[1:32:17] saying what Brother Bram said, okay? He
[1:32:19] said, "We have no right to say these
[1:32:21] things. We just got to read it and say
[1:32:24] it just exactly like it says and believe
[1:32:27] it the same way. I don't care how
[1:32:30] ridiculous it seems. You believe it
[1:32:33] anyhow." Now, now I'm the guy. I had to
[1:32:36] know, Brother Josh. I had to know. Amen.
[1:32:39] What does the word tinker mean? Well, I
[1:32:41] found out what it means. It means to
[1:32:43] attempt to repair or improve something
[1:32:46] in a casual or a lukewarm
[1:32:49] way. And it is often to no useful
[1:32:52] effect. It is to attempt to mend
[1:32:54] something by tinkering. So I found out
[1:32:57] what's actually happening is amen is
[1:32:59] lukewarm guys that never was called to
[1:33:01] begin with have invaded pullpits and
[1:33:03] because they can't get no pullpits, they
[1:33:05] got YouTube channels and they're trying
[1:33:07] to tinker with a fiery message. Let me
[1:33:10] say this. You cannot play with fire and
[1:33:12] expect not to get
[1:33:14] burnt. This is not an icicle message,
[1:33:17] folks. This is not a lukewarm message.
[1:33:19] It's a fiery message. It ought to bring
[1:33:21] a fire in our hearts. When God sends his
[1:33:24] message to an age, amen, that message
[1:33:27] becomes, amen, the leadership of that
[1:33:30] age. He said, "Then there is no private
[1:33:32] revelation, nor is there a group, amen,
[1:33:35] getting their collective revelation, but
[1:33:37] each person is hearing and receiving
[1:33:40] what the messenger has already received
[1:33:44] from God." Now, I'll just have to say
[1:33:47] it. As followers of the message of the
[1:33:49] hour, I really believe the time has come
[1:33:51] to remember what we're following.
[1:33:54] I think as Peter said, he said that you
[1:33:57] be mindful of the words which were
[1:33:58] spoken by the holy prophets. Can I say
[1:34:01] this? If we know what we are following,
[1:34:04] then we know what we are not
[1:34:07] following. If we identify what we're
[1:34:09] following, then we identify what we're
[1:34:11] not following. And here's what Peter
[1:34:13] said. We have not followed cunningly
[1:34:16] devised fables when we made known unto
[1:34:18] you the power and the coming of our Lord
[1:34:20] Jesus Christ but we were eyewitnesses of
[1:34:23] his majesty. Look at this word followed.
[1:34:26] It means to follow one's authority. Now
[1:34:29] let me just say what a prophet said. He
[1:34:31] said I am thoroughly convinced that my
[1:34:34] message comes from God. I am thoroughly
[1:34:36] convinced it's not my fleshly mind
[1:34:39] puffed up. It's the word of God. another
[1:34:43] place since the open of those seven
[1:34:44] seals. This has become a new book. Amen.
[1:34:47] And we are the privileged people that
[1:34:49] God has chosen of the earth that we
[1:34:51] might see and understand these things
[1:34:54] which is not some mythical fleshly mind
[1:34:57] of a person trying to make it up. It is
[1:35:00] the word of God made manifest and proven
[1:35:03] that it's right. Proven not by science.
[1:35:06] Amen. But by God. another place this
[1:35:09] message of the hour that we are now
[1:35:11] enjoying the presence of God the latter
[1:35:14] day the evening time when the lights are
[1:35:17] shining and the things has been opened
[1:35:19] up and the word vindicated and proved to
[1:35:23] be the truth he said if a man walks out
[1:35:26] on that he's an unbeliever he's beyond
[1:35:28] hopes he has been numbed by the power of
[1:35:32] Satan and there is no hope for him well
[1:35:35] you're looking at one preacher that
[1:35:37] refuses es to give in to the spirit of
[1:35:40] numbness.
[1:35:43] I refuse to give into it, folks. I
[1:35:45] refuse to say, "Well, amen. I've been
[1:35:47] hurt or I've been let down." Listen,
[1:35:49] this message, amen, is a message of
[1:35:52] healing. It's a message of a second
[1:35:54] chance. It's the message of a third
[1:35:56] chance. It's the message of a chance
[1:35:58] until you get it right.
[1:36:02] Now, now, somebody say, "Well, amen.
[1:36:05] There ain't nothing going on in the
[1:36:06] church." Well, just because you're numb
[1:36:08] don't mean ain't nothing happening.
[1:36:12] Y'all know what I'm talking about. And
[1:36:13] people say, "Well, there ain't nothing
[1:36:14] going on in the church." Well, actually,
[1:36:16] there is. But the problem is you become
[1:36:18] so numb. Oh, God. That it can be
[1:36:21] standing right next to you and you don't
[1:36:24] even realize it's in the building. Can I
[1:36:26] say this? The devil's trying to numb
[1:36:28] your vision. He's trying to numb your
[1:36:30] faith. He's trying to numb your worship.
[1:36:32] He's trying to numb your praise. He's
[1:36:34] trying to numb the ministry. He's trying
[1:36:36] to numb the anointing. But I say, Satan,
[1:36:38] I adjure thee in the name of Jesus
[1:36:41] Christ. I refuse to be numb by the power
[1:36:44] of
[1:36:46] Leota. And they say, well, amen. The
[1:36:49] message of the hour is getting cold. It
[1:36:50] ain't getting cold. It's getting hotter
[1:36:52] and hotter and hotter because the
[1:36:55] message of the hour has lit an
[1:36:57] expectation in us. Now listen, that what
[1:37:00] we read in the word can be fulfilled in
[1:37:04] our lives. Amen. Man, I hate to ask
[1:37:05] this, but it would be possible to turn
[1:37:07] this air conditioner up. It's getting
[1:37:08] cool up here. Amen. Expectation. Now,
[1:37:11] Amen. Look at this word expectation.
[1:37:13] It's a strong belief that something will
[1:37:16] happen or will be the case in the
[1:37:19] future. Thank you, brother. It is a
[1:37:21] belief that someone will or should
[1:37:24] achieve something. Can I say this? An
[1:37:27] expectation is a strong belief. Let me
[1:37:31] let me make it very plain. Our beliefs
[1:37:33] are strong, folks.
[1:37:35] We strongly believe that this message is
[1:37:37] thus sayaith the Lord. We strongly
[1:37:40] believe there's going to be a rapture.
[1:37:41] See, we're like Abraham who staggered
[1:37:44] not at the promise of God, but he grew
[1:37:46] stronger in faith, giving glory to God.
[1:37:50] Re said it very beautiful. He said, "I
[1:37:52] would to God that you could come under
[1:37:54] the influence that I live under and my
[1:37:56] church lives under. For we believe God
[1:37:59] is a healer. We believe that God is a
[1:38:02] savior. And we believe that God gives
[1:38:05] the Holy Ghost. That was more than just
[1:38:08] an idea, folks. That was more than just
[1:38:10] a declaration of faith. That was a
[1:38:12] strong belief that God is a healer. God
[1:38:15] is a
[1:38:16] savior. Can I say this? And God gives
[1:38:19] the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. You ain't
[1:38:23] got to live on some secondhand religion
[1:38:25] or some some historical God. There is a
[1:38:28] everpresent help in the time of trouble
[1:38:30] and he is in this building tonight in
[1:38:33] the form of the Holy
[1:38:36] Ghost. Brother Brand preached it very
[1:38:38] beautiful. He said there's expectations.
[1:38:40] 18 times he preached on expectation and
[1:38:43] he established this principle for the
[1:38:45] church. We get what we
[1:38:48] expect. Glory to God, brother Jordan. We
[1:38:51] get what we expect many times. But but
[1:38:54] but let me just say this and and not not
[1:38:56] knocking at you but just preaching.
[1:38:58] Okay? Many times we only move into the
[1:39:01] element of expectation around a special
[1:39:05] meeting or around a convention or around
[1:39:07] a youth camp. But can I say this? The
[1:39:10] message of the hour has moved us beyond
[1:39:13] Pentecostalism.
[1:39:15] We should live under the expectation and
[1:39:18] the leadership of the Holy Ghost. Now
[1:39:21] when brother Bam taught this spiritual
[1:39:23] principle of expectation from St. Luke
[1:39:25] chapter 2 and verse 25 he said behold
[1:39:28] there was a man in Jerusalem whose name
[1:39:30] was Simeon and the same man was just and
[1:39:33] devout. He was waiting for the
[1:39:35] consolation of Israel. I love this part.
[1:39:38] And the Holy Ghost was upon him. Brother
[1:39:42] Bram said the Holy Ghost was upon him in
[1:39:44] that great evil day, that great day of
[1:39:47] formality and indifference. the Holy
[1:39:49] Spirit could still rest on a man. Look
[1:39:53] in verse 26. And it was revealed to him
[1:39:57] by the Holy Ghost that he should not see
[1:40:00] death before he had seen the Lord's
[1:40:02] Christ. So the Holy Ghost was upon him,
[1:40:06] but the Holy Ghost was also imparting,
[1:40:08] Amen, spiritual revelation unto him.
[1:40:12] Come on, folks. Amen. Can we read the
[1:40:14] next verse? And he came by the spirit.
[1:40:19] into the temple when the parents brought
[1:40:21] the child to Jesus. Now, I want you to
[1:40:23] catch something. The Holy Ghost that was
[1:40:25] on him was the Holy Ghost that gave him
[1:40:28] revelation. But it was also, Brother
[1:40:30] John, the same Holy Ghost that led him
[1:40:33] to the manifestation of his expectation.
[1:40:36] In other words, he was an 80year-old
[1:40:38] white bearded sage man. But the father
[1:40:41] of God said he did not reason it. He
[1:40:44] believed it. He said, "I will not die
[1:40:47] until I see the Lord's Christ." Can I
[1:40:50] say something to you? His gray hair
[1:40:52] could not cut his expectation off. Amen.
[1:40:55] Bad days could not cut his expectation
[1:40:58] off. He knew if I'll just stay with it,
[1:41:01] there will come a reward to the
[1:41:03] expectation of my heart. My goodness, I
[1:41:07] love how the prophet brings it out. He
[1:41:09] said, in other words, what happened was
[1:41:11] the Holy Ghost found a man to believe
[1:41:13] his message in Easter Seal. He said, the
[1:41:16] Holy Spirit is today hunting out honest
[1:41:19] hearts that will believe that message.
[1:41:21] Everything in the Bible that was
[1:41:23] promised is to that believer. Are y'all
[1:41:26] ready for this? And when you accept it
[1:41:28] in its fullness, and God knows that
[1:41:31] you'll do
[1:41:32] it, brother. God knows you will accept
[1:41:35] this message. God knows that you will
[1:41:38] accept what a prophet taught in its
[1:41:41] fullness and he gives you the abstract
[1:41:43] to it. Then every promise it's made is
[1:41:46] in your possession and the Holy Spirit
[1:41:48] is there to quicken that to you. He
[1:41:52] said, "See, we usually get what we
[1:41:53] expect." Can I say this? Faith knows no
[1:41:56] defeat, folks. Faith is perfect. Faith
[1:41:59] brings things when there's no thanks to
[1:42:01] be brought. I love this. Faith creates.
[1:42:04] Faith takes away doubt. It takes
[1:42:06] negative and makes it positive. He said,
[1:42:09] "But faith has got to have a
[1:42:13] foundation." So the foundation of our
[1:42:15] faith, Amen, it must be a revelation.
[1:42:19] When the foundation of our faith is a
[1:42:21] revelation, then we can expect the
[1:42:25] impossible. Glory to God. Hallelujah. I
[1:42:29] say thank God for the message of the
[1:42:30] hour that released our expectations from
[1:42:33] the prison bars of denomination and set
[1:42:36] him into another dimension where we can
[1:42:38] believe all things are possible.
[1:42:42] We have a right. Can I say this to you?
[1:42:44] We have a right to expect the
[1:42:47] impossible. Can I say this to you? Our
[1:42:50] God is the God of the impossible. My
[1:42:53] Bible says with God nothing shall be
[1:42:57] impossible. My Bible says if thou canst
[1:43:00] believe then all things are
[1:43:02] possible to him that believeth. Brother
[1:43:05] said it like this. You say all things
[1:43:07] are possible with God. He said all
[1:43:10] things are possible to
[1:43:13] you. Glory to God. Well, somebody give
[1:43:16] me some shout room in the house of God.
[1:43:18] All things are possible to you that
[1:43:21] believe.
[1:43:23] Can I make it very plain? God's power,
[1:43:25] folks, to perform the impossible is not
[1:43:28] coming. It's here.
[1:43:31] Somebody say, "Well, it's coming." Say
[1:43:33] what a prophet said. He said, "My
[1:43:35] ministry is different from the
[1:43:36] evangelist. It's different from the
[1:43:38] pastor." He said, "My ministry is to
[1:43:41] declare him, he is here." Glory to God.
[1:43:45] If he's here, then he's here in power.
[1:43:48] If he's here, then he's here in
[1:43:50] authority. If he's here, then he's here
[1:43:52] in reality. Oh, I'm trying to behave
[1:43:56] myself, but y'all are pulling better
[1:43:57] than I'm preaching. Hallelujah. Listen,
[1:44:00] folks. He's here. He's here in this
[1:44:02] building tonight. He's here to do war
[1:44:04] with the devils of your life. He's here
[1:44:06] to break spirits. He's here to break
[1:44:08] complexes. He's here to break
[1:44:10] depression. He's here to heal cancer.
[1:44:12] He's here to deliver souls.
[1:44:17] When you take the right mental attitude
[1:44:18] towards any divine promise of God, watch
[1:44:21] it
[1:44:22] materialize. Watch it materialize. No
[1:44:25] matter how it looks, if it looks
[1:44:27] impossible, if God said so, he makes it
[1:44:32] possible. Listen, if we be the Messiah's
[1:44:35] servants, then we have to have the
[1:44:38] Messiah's power. Another place you see
[1:44:40] when a man or person has really once
[1:44:43] come in contact with God with that
[1:44:45] genuine revealed faith. Brother Israel
[1:44:49] that God is. Oh, somebody say that back
[1:44:52] to me. God
[1:44:53] is not God was and not God will be.
[1:44:58] Brother Tim, but God is. You want to
[1:45:01] change the services in Shalom
[1:45:03] Tabernacle? Then receive the genuine
[1:45:06] revelation that God is here. He's here
[1:45:09] on Wednesday. He's here on Sunday. He's
[1:45:12] here on Tuesday. He's here on your
[1:45:14] special meetings. Come on, folks. I
[1:45:16] think it's time, Amen, to take the
[1:45:18] restrictions off. I think it's time to
[1:45:20] quit limiting the unlimited God. I think
[1:45:23] it's time to quit expecting just little
[1:45:25] old things. I think it's time to expect
[1:45:27] great
[1:45:30] things. You say, "Brother Andrew, that's
[1:45:32] too hard." No, it's not. I have been led
[1:45:34] to believe this. My Bible says that as
[1:45:37] the heavens are higher than the earth.
[1:45:39] Amen. So are the ways higher than yours
[1:45:42] and my thoughts than your thoughts.
[1:45:44] Remember said God's original plan was
[1:45:46] for him to lead man. I'm sorry. I'm
[1:45:49] having to I'm having to skip over a
[1:45:50] whole section here. Amen. But I'll give
[1:45:52] you the summary of it. God was going to
[1:45:55] humanize the leadership of the spirit in
[1:45:58] his son. He said, "But the devil got
[1:46:00] ahead of him." Now, here's what he says
[1:46:01] in the church age book. He said, "Put
[1:46:03] the leadership of the Holy Ghost aside
[1:46:06] and the church is nothing but the world
[1:46:09] with God's name attached to it." If you
[1:46:13] put the Holy Ghost out of the church, it
[1:46:15] becomes nothing but the world with God's
[1:46:18] name attached to it. Here's what a
[1:46:20] prophet said. He said, "The spirit of
[1:46:22] God makes a difference."
[1:46:24] Hallelujah. Can I say there is a vast
[1:46:27] difference in a Christian and a Holy
[1:46:29] Ghost filled Christians. There is a vast
[1:46:31] difference in a church and a Holy Ghost
[1:46:33] fililled
[1:46:35] church. Somebody say, "Well, the Oh,
[1:46:38] God. Can I preach?" They say, "Well,
[1:46:42] they say things are going to get out of
[1:46:43] hand." And I I remember those days when
[1:46:45] they used to scare me with that homemade
[1:46:46] theology. I'm going to preach a whole
[1:46:48] sermon in a few days on homemade
[1:46:50] theology. I'm so sick of it. I don't
[1:46:51] know what to do. Amen. Guys try to put
[1:46:54] you in a little bubble and they Y'all
[1:46:57] know what I'm talking about, don't you?
[1:46:58] Amen. It's called homemade theology and
[1:47:00] can't nobody else make it cuz you're the
[1:47:02] one that made it. I was telling over at
[1:47:05] Jericho Tabernacle on Friday night,
[1:47:07] there was a brother out in Arkansas used
[1:47:09] to sing a song. Brother Brother Lawson
[1:47:10] tells a story. He used to sing a song.
[1:47:12] He was a good brother, but he would just
[1:47:14] get under inspiration and he'd start
[1:47:15] writing his own songs. And he wrote one.
[1:47:17] He wrote a song called Going to Lock
[1:47:19] That Devil Up. Going to lock that devil
[1:47:21] up. Going to lock that devil up and
[1:47:23] throw away the key. Going to lock that
[1:47:24] devil up. And brother brother told the
[1:47:26] story. He said, "But the hard thing was
[1:47:28] he'd always get to that one point and he
[1:47:31] would say,"Now everybody join
[1:47:33] in." He said, "Couldn't nobody join in?
[1:47:36] Cuz didn't nobody know the
[1:47:38] song?" He wrote the song. Now, now, can
[1:47:41] I just say this to you? That's why a lot
[1:47:43] of walls have come around our message is
[1:47:45] because guys have gotten homemade
[1:47:47] theologies that Brother Brandham never
[1:47:49] taught and they brought them to pull
[1:47:51] pits and they said, "Now, come on,
[1:47:52] everybody say it with me." But there's a
[1:47:54] problem. We're not reading the same
[1:47:56] sheet music. Listen, there's a reason
[1:47:59] why this message was not just flipped to
[1:48:01] ear to brother Brandham's buddies.
[1:48:02] There's a reason why there's 1,200 books
[1:48:05] and 1,200 tapes. So there would be a
[1:48:07] people in the last days who would be
[1:48:10] saying the same
[1:48:12] thing. Come. Is that okay? We would be
[1:48:16] saying the same thing. Somebody say,
[1:48:18] "Well, amen. Brother so and so said,
[1:48:19] "God bless brother so and so." But if
[1:48:21] it's against what a prophet said, you
[1:48:23] forsake what brother so and so said and
[1:48:26] you stand with a vindicated prophet of
[1:48:28] God.
[1:48:31] Homemade theologies,
[1:48:35] they work for a
[1:48:37] while, but then you lose your young
[1:48:39] people. Oh, God. And then you and then
[1:48:43] you got to start bringing psychology in
[1:48:44] to fix problems cuz it's homemade
[1:48:46] theologies. But if we bring the original
[1:48:49] formula back to the church, the Bible
[1:48:52] says they rebelled and vexed the Holy
[1:48:54] Spirit and he was turned to be their
[1:48:56] enemy and he fought against them. I love
[1:48:58] what Jesus says in in Matthew 12:31. He
[1:49:01] says, "Now wherefore I say unto you, all
[1:49:03] manner of sin and blasphemy shall be
[1:49:04] forgiven unto men. But the blasphemy
[1:49:07] against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be
[1:49:11] forgiven unto man." Can I say something
[1:49:13] to you? There is a sin against the
[1:49:16] spirit. Look at this word blasphemy. It
[1:49:19] means impious and reproachful speech
[1:49:22] which is injurious to divine majesty. So
[1:49:26] Paul said, "Let no corrupt communication
[1:49:29] proceed out of your mouth, but that
[1:49:31] which is good to the use of edifying
[1:49:33] that it may minister grace to the
[1:49:35] hearers." I love this one. and grieve
[1:49:37] not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye
[1:49:40] are sealed until the day of redemption.
[1:49:44] Can I say something, saints? We better
[1:49:46] let the Holy Ghost bridle our tongues.
[1:49:50] Somebody say, "Well, Amen. I think we
[1:49:52] got too much shouting. I think we got
[1:49:54] too much singing. I think we got too
[1:49:56] much emotion. I don't think we have
[1:49:57] enough. I think we're too quiet. I think
[1:49:59] we're too loud. I think he's too short.
[1:50:01] I think he I think he's too tall. I
[1:50:03] think he moves too much. I think he
[1:50:04] sweats too much." Are you hearing me?
[1:50:06] Amen. Well, I don't think she ought to
[1:50:08] be screaming. I don't think he ought to
[1:50:09] be running. And I don't think he ought
[1:50:10] to be hard. And I tell you, I
[1:50:12] don't Y'all know what I'm talking about.
[1:50:14] Amen. Can I Can I tell you what Paul
[1:50:16] said? Paul said, "Quench not the
[1:50:18] spirit." Now, listen, folks. We made
[1:50:20] that about music long enough, but let's
[1:50:22] bring it back to some balance, okay?
[1:50:24] That word quench means of fire or things
[1:50:27] on fire. If this message is burdened in
[1:50:30] the soul of a daughter or son of God, I
[1:50:33] say give them some liberty to be what
[1:50:36] God called them to be.
[1:50:39] Somebody say, "Well, Amen. I don't think
[1:50:41] we ought to shout." I don't think
[1:50:42] Listen, folks. I just I preached that
[1:50:44] just come to me. Amen. Let the shoutters
[1:50:46] shout and let the singers sing. Let the
[1:50:49] runners run. Let the sinners sit. Let
[1:50:51] the criers cry. Let the singers sing and
[1:50:53] the preachers preach. Let the deacons be
[1:50:55] the deacons. Let the pastor be the
[1:50:57] pastor. Let the musicians be the
[1:50:59] musicians, but let's just take the
[1:51:01] restrictions off and let God be God and
[1:51:04] just get back to having church again.
[1:51:08] Remember when we just used to have
[1:51:09] church?
[1:51:11] Now you say, "Brother Andy, you're
[1:51:13] getting way out there. It quench not the
[1:51:15] fire. Quench not the divine influence."
[1:51:18] Can I say this? Whatever is influencing
[1:51:21] you is leading you. Do you remember
[1:51:24] brother said it in leadership? He
[1:51:26] brought it down and he said, "Here's my
[1:51:27] question. But now, who is leading you?"
[1:51:31] Y'all remember that. But now, who is
[1:51:33] leading you? He said, "See, we're all
[1:51:34] led by something." He said, "Now, we are
[1:51:37] today God's spiritual church." With, is
[1:51:40] this okay? Where the spiritual law,
[1:51:42] amen, written on the tables of our
[1:51:44] hearts and we are led in a spiritual
[1:51:47] form. He said, "Now, they had to look up
[1:51:50] to see where the pillar of power was."
[1:51:52] He said, "But we don't have to look
[1:51:53] today because there's something happens
[1:51:56] that we know he's here." Now, I'll say
[1:51:58] this, the pillar of fire, as the prophet
[1:52:01] said, it should put the whole move of
[1:52:04] God into action.
[1:52:06] In the token, he says Luther, Wesley,
[1:52:09] Finny, Knox, Calvin, they all knew there
[1:52:11] would come a time that the pillar of
[1:52:13] fire would return back to the church.
[1:52:15] Now listen folks, they had an
[1:52:17] expectation that the pillar of fire was
[1:52:19] going to return and humanized leadership
[1:52:22] was going to be set down. But listen
[1:52:24] what a prophet said. He said, "But they
[1:52:26] didn't live to see it, brother Israel.
[1:52:28] But they look forward to it." Oh God. In
[1:52:32] the sign is is this the sign of the end,
[1:52:34] sir? He says that's some of the mystery.
[1:52:36] See, amen. The pillar of fire returning
[1:52:38] back. That's the thing that's supposed
[1:52:40] to take place. Listen. And we see it.
[1:52:44] Come on, church. Do you realize that one
[1:52:46] expectation of one generation can be
[1:52:49] fulfilled in another generation? In
[1:52:51] other words, you tonight are getting the
[1:52:54] reward of Finn's expectation. You are
[1:52:57] getting the reward of Calvin's
[1:52:59] expectation. What those men were
[1:53:01] expecting to see, you are seeing in the
[1:53:04] middle of the house of God. Oh
[1:53:07] God, we see the pillar of fire. Now, I
[1:53:11] got to hurry here. Prophet of God said
[1:53:12] this. He said, "God either going to lead
[1:53:14] his church or the Holy Ghost is going to
[1:53:16] lead it." See, or man's going to lead
[1:53:18] it. And if you choose a man, we'll go
[1:53:20] ahead and God pulls his church right out
[1:53:23] and the pillar of fire moves on and the
[1:53:27] church moves with it. How many knows,
[1:53:29] brother Brandham said, that Pentecost
[1:53:31] was the last great move? You familiar
[1:53:33] with that quote? He said, "See, the
[1:53:36] Pentecostal revival is now ceasing. We
[1:53:38] see it everywhere. The last great move,
[1:53:40] the the message has went forth. The
[1:53:42] church is sealed away. The wicked are
[1:53:44] doing more wicked. Oh God, the churches
[1:53:47] are becoming more churchy, but the
[1:53:49] saints,
[1:53:51] I guess, brother George would hear, he'd
[1:53:52] say, "Amen, saints." Amen. But the
[1:53:54] saints are coming closer to God. Amen.
[1:53:58] Listen, what's happening is is Pentecost
[1:54:00] has become so staked down until they
[1:54:03] died. Brother said, "But here's a here's
[1:54:05] a prophetic announcement." He said,
[1:54:07] "Pentecost died and God let it die." You
[1:54:10] know why he said that? Because the shuck
[1:54:12] had to give forth a seed. He said, "See,
[1:54:15] but must come something that cannot be
[1:54:17] organized and die because organization
[1:54:20] spells death." He said, "So there's got
[1:54:23] to come forth a word of God that's
[1:54:25] outside of the realms of that
[1:54:28] denomination." Y'all, y'all remember
[1:54:30] when I said a little bit ago, people say
[1:54:31] some dumb
[1:54:32] things? Somebody said something to me
[1:54:34] not long ago. They said, "You know,
[1:54:36] y'all believe a lot of," and this was so
[1:54:37] supposedly a message believer. They
[1:54:39] said, 'You know, you y'all believe. And
[1:54:41] I said, 'Y'all, I thought y'all was one
[1:54:42] of us, but nonetheless, Amen. You
[1:54:44] believe some things. And he said, 'You
[1:54:45] know, you can't even hardly come up with
[1:54:47] five scriptures to back up what you
[1:54:50] believe. So, I'm riding down the road,
[1:54:52] brother Israel. And I just got to thank
[1:54:54] him. Now, here's just a few that I made
[1:54:56] up in about five minutes, riding down
[1:54:57] the road. Joshua chapter 1, Psalms
[1:55:00] chapter 1, Psalms 27, Daniel 11, Daniel
[1:55:03] 12, Hosea 6, Joel 2, Amos 3, Habac 2,
[1:55:06] Zechariah 4, Zechariah 14, Malachi 4,
[1:55:10] Matthew 17, Mark 11, Mark 16, Luke 17,
[1:55:13] John 12:14, 15:16, Acts 2, Acts 3, 2
[1:55:17] Corinthians 3, 2 Corinthians 15,
[1:55:20] Colossians 1, 1 Thessalonians 4, Hebrews
[1:55:23] 13, Revelations 1:35, 1810, 13, 17, 18,
[1:55:27] 19, 21, 21 and 22. Let me say what a
[1:55:30] prophet said. He said, "The scripture
[1:55:32] today thoroughly identifies the move of
[1:55:35] God that's among the church." He said,
[1:55:37] "See, oh God, what's happening?" He
[1:55:40] said, "It's Luke 17:30. It's Malachi 4.
[1:55:43] And how many more scriptures? It would
[1:55:46] be endless." Come on, folks. It would be
[1:55:48] endless. I said, "Lord, where have I
[1:55:51] heard that word endless before?" Oh,
[1:55:53] that's right. In Hebrews chapter 7,
[1:55:55] there was a sermon called, "Who is this
[1:55:58] Melzdc?" You know what he said? He said
[1:56:01] Melzdc was of the power of an endless
[1:56:04] life. Man, glory to God. I feel like
[1:56:07] dancing in the house of God. If
[1:56:09] anybody's got a righteous shout is the
[1:56:11] bride of Jesus Christ. We are an undying
[1:56:15] breed of people who has received the
[1:56:17] power of God by the preaching of the
[1:56:20] message of the hour.
[1:56:23] Listen, I got to I got to say it or I'm
[1:56:26] going to bust. He said Melzdc became
[1:56:28] Jesus Christ, which you all know Melzdc
[1:56:30] returns to the church, what does he do?
[1:56:33] He comes to claim a body for a final
[1:56:36] move doors and door right up here in
[1:56:38] Flagstaff, Arizona 65. He said, "Now
[1:56:41] when we see him return in these last
[1:56:43] days, this great move of God moving
[1:56:45] across the nations of the world, what's
[1:56:48] he doing? He's gathering a people for
[1:56:50] the bride.
[1:56:53] Hallelujah. He is gathering a people for
[1:56:56] the bride. Come on, folks. I wouldn't
[1:56:58] know Israel Paul and he wouldn't know
[1:57:00] me. I wouldn't know Joe Puit. He
[1:57:03] wouldn't know me. I wouldn't know
[1:57:04] Brother Joe and he wouldn't know me.
[1:57:06] Amen. I wouldn't know Brother John. I
[1:57:08] wouldn't know you. But God sent a
[1:57:11] message. It was the return of Melzdc. He
[1:57:15] was claiming a body for a final
[1:57:18] move. Hallelujah. No wonder he stood on
[1:57:21] a platform and said, "We're entering
[1:57:23] another age. We're entering the
[1:57:25] rapturing age." You know what he said?
[1:57:27] He said, "The move is on for the bride."
[1:57:31] Hallelujah. The move is on for the
[1:57:34] bride. That is thus saith the Lord.
[1:57:38] Hallelujah.
[1:57:41] We got to move, folks. We got to move.
[1:57:44] We got to move. I know you all just
[1:57:46] moved buildings, but there's a greater
[1:57:48] move coming. I know you just moved
[1:57:50] sanctuaries, but there's a greater move
[1:57:52] coming. Brother Israel, one of these
[1:57:54] mornings between 6:00 and 9, we're going
[1:57:56] to move from one dimension into
[1:58:00] another. The move, the move is on for
[1:58:03] the
[1:58:05] bride. Hallelujah. That's not an
[1:58:08] emotion. That's not a sensation. That's
[1:58:10] a
[1:58:12] [Applause]
[1:58:14] revelation. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:58:18] Brother Re said it very beautiful. Come
[1:58:20] on folks. Let's not leave this back in '
[1:58:22] 65. Let's not leave this back in 77.
[1:58:26] Let's not leave this back in the '9s or
[1:58:28] the early 2000s. Let's bring it right
[1:58:30] here, right now,
[1:58:33] tonight. The Holy Spirit has been bound
[1:58:36] by these denominational rivers for
[1:58:38] almost 2,000 years. But it is to be
[1:58:41] loosed in the evening time message. The
[1:58:43] Holy Spirit pack in the church again.
[1:58:46] It'll be Christ himself revealed in
[1:58:50] human flesh in the evening time. He said
[1:58:53] it. He promised it. Come on, folks. Do
[1:58:56] you believe a prophet? Do you believe a
[1:58:58] prophet? Then can I say what he said? He
[1:59:01] said, I challenge you to believe that
[1:59:03] Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of
[1:59:06] son of man in human flesh through the
[1:59:10] bride's
[1:59:12] body. Glory to God. Hallelujah. The son
[1:59:16] of God dispensation has ended. This is
[1:59:18] now Luke 17:30. The son of man has been
[1:59:22] revealed. Not just in a prophet. What is
[1:59:25] the attraction on the mountain? It's the
[1:59:27] changing from the prophecy unto the
[1:59:31] fulfillment. I'm sorry. I'm about to
[1:59:34] explode up here. It's real to my heart.
[1:59:37] You say, "What's wrong with you?" I'll
[1:59:38] tell you what's wrong with me. I've been
[1:59:40] ignited. I've been set on fire and I'm
[1:59:43] burning.
[1:59:45] I'm on fire with this
[1:59:49] message. Oh, I've got to skip over 100
[1:59:51] quotes. Come back, he says, to this
[1:59:54] prophetic message. The son of man in the
[1:59:57] form of prophetic message returning back
[1:59:59] again in his church in prophecy
[2:00:01] revealing Jesus Christ the same
[2:00:04] yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. Let
[2:00:07] me let me bring this down. What is this
[2:00:09] restoration of the word? It's the
[2:00:11] restoring of the original word. Are you
[2:00:15] ready for this bride? Restoring the
[2:00:17] original word, which is the original
[2:00:20] headship. He said, "Now, like Israel of
[2:00:22] old, there was one God vindicated by a
[2:00:24] pillar of fire and revealed himself
[2:00:26] through a prophet to be the word."
[2:00:29] Somebody shout, "Original
[2:00:31] headship." Original headship. Are you
[2:00:33] ready for what original headship is? It
[2:00:36] is a prophet under the pillar of fire
[2:00:38] and he's vindicated by the
[2:00:41] word. Amen. Can I get that first picture
[2:00:43] I sent you all today? Amen. Can I get
[2:00:45] that first picture? Amen. Amen. I know
[2:00:47] it's here in the tabernacle. I say God
[2:00:49] bless you, brother Israel. Amen. But I'm
[2:00:52] going to have get a double portion
[2:00:53] tonight. Amen. Amen. If there's anything
[2:00:56] I get gotten after is over preaching
[2:00:58] about that picture, but I love it cuz I
[2:01:01] ain't ashamed of it. I ain't a hireling.
[2:01:03] I ain't a I ain't afraid to say
[2:01:05] that's more than a man. That's the
[2:01:07] pillar of fire. It's the endorphe. What
[2:01:10] God was in when he met Adam and Eve,
[2:01:12] when he met Paul on the road to
[2:01:14] Damascus, when he met Moses at the
[2:01:15] burning bush, that pillar of fire met a
[2:01:18] prophet and has restored the word to the
[2:01:20] church.
[2:01:23] Hallelujah. What are you saying? Let me
[2:01:25] say what a prophet said. Leave that
[2:01:26] there. He said, Jesus said, "All things
[2:01:29] are possible to them that believe." Are
[2:01:31] y'all ready for this? And if you can
[2:01:33] believe it, then whatever God will lead
[2:01:36] your soul to believe, that is
[2:01:39] yours. Whatever God will lead your soul
[2:01:44] to believe, that is
[2:01:46] yours. Whatever God will lead your soul
[2:01:50] to believe, that is yours. Oh my. He
[2:01:54] said, "So the leadership of God is
[2:01:56] follow the vindicated word of the hour
[2:01:59] by the Holy Ghost." Amen. Can you see
[2:02:01] that picture right there? I got a
[2:02:03] question for you. Okay. Can you believe
[2:02:05] it?
[2:02:07] Can you believe it? Can you believe
[2:02:10] that? That is original headship
[2:02:12] returning to the church to lead us in
[2:02:15] the third exodus. Can you believe that?
[2:02:17] That's more than a preacher. That's more
[2:02:19] than a prophet. That's our Lord up
[2:02:22] there. Can I tell you what a prophet
[2:02:24] said? He said, "And I believe as I am
[2:02:27] led to believe." That is if the picture
[2:02:30] of the angel of the Lord who comes and
[2:02:32] does it is earning. Amen. Can I say this
[2:02:35] very beautiful? Amen. Just leave that
[2:02:36] for me for a second. In other words, we
[2:02:39] have been led to believe what we
[2:02:42] believe. Come on church. The Bible says
[2:02:45] the sons of God are led by the spirit of
[2:02:48] God. You know what it says here? Led to
[2:02:50] believe is actually a phrase. You know
[2:02:52] what it means? It means to be influenced
[2:02:55] to a certain belief because of something
[2:02:58] seen, something heard, or something
[2:03:01] read. Oh God, you say, "Well, you're
[2:03:04] just believing that because you've been
[2:03:05] led to believe it." And you are exactly
[2:03:07] right. I have seen the appearing of the
[2:03:10] Lord. I have read the seven seals. I
[2:03:13] have heard the tapes. And there is a
[2:03:15] fire on the inside of my soul. I feel
[2:03:18] like Jeremiah. It's shut up in my bones.
[2:03:23] Lord, brother Israel, this this is the
[2:03:25] one that just grabbed me. Okay. Led to
[2:03:28] believe is usually because of a
[2:03:32] conversation. Brother David, somebody
[2:03:34] had a conversation and they come to you
[2:03:37] and they relay that conversation to you.
[2:03:40] And what they're trying to do is they're
[2:03:42] trying to lead you to believe something
[2:03:44] by a
[2:03:45] conversation that they had. God, you
[2:03:49] say, "Where are you going with this?"
[2:03:50] Brother Bram said, "Don't try to push
[2:03:51] yourself. Just simply believe and what
[2:03:54] he tells me, I'll tell
[2:03:58] you. Speak to this mountain when he
[2:04:00] stands before me in that life that you
[2:04:02] see on that picture and reveals it every
[2:04:04] time perfect with the scripture through
[2:04:06] and through." That's the reason I know
[2:04:08] it's the angel of the Lord because he
[2:04:10] bears record of his word. And if that
[2:04:12] angel told me one thing that wasn't
[2:04:15] scriptural, I would not believe him. It
[2:04:17] has to be with the word first because
[2:04:20] God's word is eternal. Because an angel
[2:04:24] could come and preach something else.
[2:04:26] Paul said that wasn't right. But if it's
[2:04:28] the word of God, then the angel of God
[2:04:30] will verify that word every time to be
[2:04:33] the truth. If it's a true angel from the
[2:04:35] Lord, if it's something off color, then
[2:04:37] don't you listen to it. Are y'all ready
[2:04:39] for this? But if an angel comes and
[2:04:42] speaks and says exactly just what the
[2:04:45] word says, then that angel,
[2:04:49] glory to God, brother Joe, that angel is
[2:04:51] from God. Are y'all hearing me tonight?
[2:04:55] Now, can you give me that next
[2:04:57] picture? Amen. Amen. On that next
[2:05:00] picture there, Amen. I want y'all to see
[2:05:04] something. Y'all see that right there?
[2:05:07] Few days ago, I was preaching on this
[2:05:09] and and and and I forgot. I forgot my
[2:05:11] file of picture. So, I had to grab it
[2:05:12] real quick. And I grabbed it and I was
[2:05:14] looking at it, brother Israel. And I got
[2:05:15] to thinking, there's there's there's
[2:05:17] something missing that picture. So, I
[2:05:19] said, "Where in the world did I get that
[2:05:20] from?" And I went online and and God
[2:05:22] forgive me, Lord. I quickly grabbed it
[2:05:24] and when I traced it down where it come
[2:05:26] from, you know where it come from? It
[2:05:27] come from them bunch of repbates called
[2:05:28] Believe the Sign. And I don't apologize
[2:05:30] for that statement either. Amen. I'll
[2:05:32] say this. You know what they done,
[2:05:34] brother Israel? The the picture that was
[2:05:35] missing was them bunch of liars. Amen.
[2:05:38] Took and blotted out that boat of
[2:05:40] fishermen behind a prophet baptizing the
[2:05:42] 17th person on the Ohio River. You know
[2:05:45] why they done that? Because they want
[2:05:47] you to believe you're believing
[2:05:48] something that was hashed up out of some
[2:05:50] corner somewhere or some backwoods or
[2:05:52] something. But when the purifier come
[2:05:54] down and spoke to a prophet on the Ohio
[2:05:57] River, there was a bunch of fishermen
[2:05:59] having to sit there and watch a
[2:06:01] conversation take place between the
[2:06:03] angel of God and the seventh angel on
[2:06:06] the earth. And you all know what he
[2:06:07] said, don't you? As John the Baptist was
[2:06:10] sent to forrun the first coming of
[2:06:11] Christ, your message will forrun the
[2:06:14] second coming. You know what he said? He
[2:06:16] said, "And around the world it's gone
[2:06:18] seven times." He said, "And revival
[2:06:21] fires are burning on every hillside."
[2:06:24] Well, let me shout aloud tonight. The
[2:06:26] fire of this message is burning in
[2:06:29] Shalom Tabernacle. It's burning in the
[2:06:32] flesh of the bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:06:37] Man, look at this next one. Give me that
[2:06:38] next picture. I'm closing right here. I
[2:06:40] promise. But I'm feeling
[2:06:42] good. 1957, a prophet standing there
[2:06:45] preaching in Lakeport, California,
[2:06:48] preaching the word. unsearchable re I'll
[2:06:50] just say it preaching the unsearchable
[2:06:52] riches of Christ revealing to you things
[2:06:54] that was confounding theologians and
[2:06:57] which was troubling doctors of divinity
[2:06:59] and with a seventh grade education he
[2:07:01] stood there and began to reveal the mind
[2:07:04] of
[2:07:04] Christ. Now somebody say where in the
[2:07:07] world was all of his sermons coming from
[2:07:08] give me that next
[2:07:11] picture. Oh that's where it was coming
[2:07:14] from. Come on, folks. It was coming from
[2:07:16] the pillar of
[2:07:18] fire. Can I say this or I'm going to
[2:07:20] bust. God is with this
[2:07:23] message. God is with this message. And
[2:07:26] if you want the pillar of fire, just
[2:07:28] start saying what a prophet has already
[2:07:31] said and the pillar of fire will come in
[2:07:33] the church. You say, "Preacher, you lost
[2:07:36] your mind." Amen. I haven't lost my
[2:07:38] mind. The angel of the Lord accompanies
[2:07:40] this message always. God is not looking
[2:07:42] for somebody to figure it out. He's not
[2:07:45] looking for somebody to work it all out.
[2:07:47] He's just looking for somebody that's
[2:07:49] got enough guts to stand on a platform
[2:07:52] and say what a prophet has already said.
[2:07:59] I just going to preach preaching the
[2:08:00] other day right over here in Tucson at
[2:08:01] brother Doug Baker's church. Stand there
[2:08:03] preaching and I put that picture up and
[2:08:05] sister Jennifer Amen. He sent me a text.
[2:08:08] He said, "But Andrew, when you put that
[2:08:09] picture up," he said, "My wife watched
[2:08:11] the pillar of fire go from one end of
[2:08:13] the building across the platform." You
[2:08:15] say, "Why are you saying that?" Because
[2:08:17] God is still with this
[2:08:20] message. It ain't cooling off, folks.
[2:08:23] It's getting hotter. It's burning
[2:08:25] stronger. It's burning
[2:08:27] brighter. It's going to change our
[2:08:29] bodies. Can you give me that next
[2:08:31] picture?
[2:08:34] Oh, that's the one they hate.
[2:08:38] That's the one they wish they could just
[2:08:40] just just just just work out a formula
[2:08:42] and say it was a ship or a rocket ship
[2:08:44] or or a space shuttle. But let me say
[2:08:46] what a prophet said. He said that's my
[2:08:49] Lord up
[2:08:53] there said a man sitting right here
[2:08:55] present. Now leave that right there.
[2:08:56] Standing there by me when seven angels
[2:08:58] come down from God visibly standing by
[2:09:00] the right there and told me about the
[2:09:02] end time and these revelations and the
[2:09:04] things of the book of the revelation and
[2:09:06] seven seals and said return home and one
[2:09:08] by one will bring the message absolute.
[2:09:11] There stood seven angels standing there
[2:09:13] commission me to go back and to bring
[2:09:14] these messages and said one by one they
[2:09:18] would are y'all ready for this?
[2:09:22] they would meet me and tell what
[2:09:25] happened. And it did exactly that way.
[2:09:28] And when they ascended up on high, went
[2:09:30] 30 miles high in the air, and on the
[2:09:32] same day they took the picture of it,
[2:09:34] science did, and it went around the
[2:09:35] world. Brother Israel, I love this
[2:09:37] quote. It was a paradox, but it was an
[2:09:40] absolute. Woo! Glory to God. I'm going
[2:09:43] to kick it in high gear and preach my
[2:09:45] way right out of here. It was a paradox,
[2:09:47] but it's an absolute. Let me say this.
[2:09:50] We are not confused on seven seals. We
[2:09:52] are not confused on a third pull. We are
[2:09:55] not confused on water baptism. We are
[2:09:57] not confused on predestination. We are
[2:09:59] not confused on serpent seed. We are not
[2:10:02] confused on the mark of the beast. We
[2:10:03] are not confused on the seal of God. We
[2:10:06] are not confused on church order. We are
[2:10:08] not confused on the symbols of the book
[2:10:10] of revelation. There has been a sounding
[2:10:12] of the seventh angel. And he told us the
[2:10:15] conversation that he had with the author
[2:10:17] of the book.
[2:10:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Somebody give
[2:10:24] him praise.
[2:10:26] [Music]
[2:10:28] I have been led to believe these
[2:10:33] things. Let me just let me just leave
[2:10:36] you with this. I'm I'm sorry, brother
[2:10:38] Israel. I've gone too long. Let me just
[2:10:40] say this and I'm
[2:10:42] done. Hallelujah. I wish I was out in
[2:10:45] the field right now. I'd cut up.
[2:10:47] Hallelujah. This is more than a church.
[2:10:50] This is more than a sermon. This is
[2:10:52] Jesus Christ revealed in the last days
[2:10:56] according to his
[2:10:59] word. I have been led. I have been led
[2:11:03] to believe these things. This ain't some
[2:11:05] imagination. This ain't some fleshly
[2:11:07] mind. I've been led to believe it. Now,
[2:11:10] now you you just tell me something.
[2:11:12] Okay. Right here in this picture. Amen.
[2:11:14] Here's our prophet and right above his
[2:11:16] head is the pillar of fire. Okay. Can
[2:11:19] y'all can y'all help me with something?
[2:11:21] What am I holding in my
[2:11:22] hand? A microphone. Where is the
[2:11:27] microphone? Is it above my
[2:11:29] head? Is it above my head? It's under my
[2:11:35] mouth. So, the pillar of fire believed
[2:11:38] that William Marian Brandom was God's
[2:11:40] mouthpiece for this age. So, he chose
[2:11:43] him to be a microphone. That's why he
[2:11:46] stood in the prayer lines and said, "I
[2:11:48] am a perfect mute until something speaks
[2:11:50] through me. How do I know what's going
[2:11:52] to happen?" He said, "But if he comes,
[2:11:55] oh God." Oh, but if he comes, let me ask
[2:11:58] you, who was the he? It was the spirit
[2:12:00] of truth who would lead you and guide
[2:12:02] you into all truth. But if he comes, he
[2:12:05] knows what has been. He knows what is,
[2:12:08] and he knows what will be.
[2:12:11] Well, everything I hear on those tapes
[2:12:14] was not the mind of William Brandham. It
[2:12:16] was the voice of the son of man. And he
[2:12:19] led me to believe that one of these
[2:12:21] mornings between 6:00 and 9, I'm going
[2:12:23] to have a body change. He led me to
[2:12:25] believe that missing limbs are going to
[2:12:27] be restored. He led me to believe that I
[2:12:30] am the justified, sinless, spotless
[2:12:32] bride.
[2:12:40] He led me to believe these
[2:12:42] things. He led me to believe that my
[2:12:45] name was put in the lamb's wick of life
[2:12:48] the same time Jesus's
[2:12:50] was. He led me to believe that my sins
[2:12:53] are in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[2:12:56] He led me to believe, sis. He led me to
[2:12:58] believe that God is able to heal any
[2:13:00] disease. He led me to believe that not
[2:13:02] even cancer will stand in the way of the
[2:13:05] prayer of a son or daughter of God. He
[2:13:07] led me to believe that there was enough
[2:13:09] power in this bride to speak a world
[2:13:11] into existence and go live a private
[2:13:13] life on it. He led me to believe, sis,
[2:13:15] that you're more than a church member.
[2:13:17] You are an invincible army of Jesus
[2:13:20] Christ. He led me to believe we're not
[2:13:22] just preachers. We're messiahettes. He
[2:13:24] led me to believe that there's going to
[2:13:26] be a coming of the
[2:13:28] Lord and I'm going to be in it. I want
[2:13:30] you to stand on your feet and give God
[2:13:32] [Applause]
[2:13:35] praise.
[2:13:37] Hallelujah.
[2:13:39] Hallelujah. I have been led to believe
[2:13:42] these
[2:13:50] things. I have been led to
[2:13:54] believe. I have been led to believe that
[2:13:57] if I'll preach this message, creation
[2:13:59] power will back it
[2:14:02] up. I've been led to believe that,
[2:14:04] brother. I've been led to believe if
[2:14:06] I'll humble myself and say what a
[2:14:08] prophet said, then the power of God will
[2:14:10] come right in the meeting and do things
[2:14:12] that Andrew Glover knows nothing
[2:14:14] about. I've been led to believe, Brother
[2:14:16] Israel. I've been led to believe. I've
[2:14:19] been led to
[2:14:21] believe. I heard a conversation. I
[2:14:24] listen to it every day of my life. I
[2:14:26] listen to it on the way down here. I'll
[2:14:28] listen to it on the plane tonight. I'll
[2:14:30] listen to it when I get home. I'll go
[2:14:32] tell young people about it. Listen, you
[2:14:34] say, "Preacher, you lost your mind."
[2:14:36] Listen, you're looking at one con you're
[2:14:38] looking at one Tennessee country boy.
[2:14:40] Amen. That didn't have nothing. Somebody
[2:14:42] say, "Well, brother Andrew, you're
[2:14:43] you're a pretty loose cannon." You know
[2:14:44] what I am? I'm a dangerous person. You
[2:14:46] know why I'm dangerous? Cuz I don't have
[2:14:48] no reputation. I care about. And anybody
[2:14:51] that don't have a reputation, they don't
[2:14:53] care about anything. You know why?
[2:14:55] Because I was on my way to hell. But God
[2:14:58] in rich and mercy reached down and saved
[2:15:00] me. He saved this old piece of Tennessee
[2:15:02] dirt and filled me with the Holy Ghost
[2:15:04] and revealed the greatest message that
[2:15:06] ever hit the face of the earth. Listen,
[2:15:08] I give my life to this message. It's the
[2:15:11] truth.
[2:15:15] It's the truth.
[2:15:17] Come on. You say, "Brother Andrew, I'm
[2:15:18] this little nobody. Let me tell you
[2:15:20] something. Get under the message one
[2:15:22] time and you'll go from nobody to an
[2:15:24] influential believer.
[2:15:27] You say, "Can you prove that?" I can.
[2:15:29] Amen. The prophet of God said the woman
[2:15:31] at the well, he said she didn't have a
[2:15:32] voice. He said if the kids were playing
[2:15:34] in the streets, because of her
[2:15:36] reputation, they didn't even have to
[2:15:38] listen to her. But when she met the
[2:15:40] Messiah, oh God. Hallelujah. When she
[2:15:43] met the message of the hour, when she
[2:15:45] met the Messiah, she threw away the
[2:15:48] water bucket and she ran into the city
[2:15:50] and she said, "Come see a man who told
[2:15:52] me everything I ever done." Can I make
[2:15:55] an announcement to you? The same Messiah
[2:15:57] that was at Abraham's tent, that was at
[2:15:59] the woman at the well, is right here in
[2:16:02] this building tonight.
[2:16:06] The Messiah is his word. Let our
[2:16:09] musicians come tonight.
[2:16:13] I have been led to believe these things.
[2:16:16] I have been led to believe that barren
[2:16:19] wombs can bring forth children.
[2:16:23] I have been led to believe that cancers
[2:16:26] can disappear in the middle of services.
[2:16:29] I have been led to believe that suicidal
[2:16:32] demons that have plagued hearts and
[2:16:33] plagued minds can be defeated in the
[2:16:36] power of the Holy Ghost.
[2:16:38] Brother Lee, I have been led to believe
[2:16:40] that God can so fill a young man with
[2:16:42] the Holy Ghost that the devil doesn't
[2:16:44] even know what to do with him. I have
[2:16:46] been led to believe these things.
[2:16:50] I've been led to believe. Can I say
[2:16:53] something to you? Hatty Wright was led
[2:16:55] to believe.
[2:16:58] [Music]
[2:17:01] I may never get to speak to you again,
[2:17:02] but I'm having a shouting hallelujah
[2:17:04] time right now.
[2:17:06] Hatty Wright was led to believe these
[2:17:08] things. You say, "Why do you say that?"
[2:17:11] We could all die by morning, but I'll
[2:17:13] say this while I got a microphone to say
[2:17:14] it. The third pull is right here in this
[2:17:16] building
[2:17:17] tonight. The third pull is the opening
[2:17:20] of the word. It's creation power by the
[2:17:22] spoken word. Come on, folks. Had he
[2:17:25] writes sit there and she was led to
[2:17:27] believe by a conversation between the
[2:17:29] seventh angel and Charlie Cox that he
[2:17:32] could speak swirls into existence. Oh, I
[2:17:34] love what she said. And when she heard
[2:17:37] that conversation, she said, "That ain't
[2:17:39] nothing but the truth." It was a
[2:17:41] paradox, but it become an absolute
[2:17:44] tot. And by her being led to believe,
[2:17:48] she led her two boys to believe that God
[2:17:51] was a savior.
[2:17:57] It's real, folks.
[2:17:59] It's real. It's real. It's called the
[2:18:03] message of the hour. It's the
[2:18:04] uncarchable riches of Christ.
[2:18:07] It ministers grace to the hearers.
[2:18:12] Two or three years ago out at brother
[2:18:13] Edis in Cloverdale stand there preaching
[2:18:15] on Wednesday night. I looked out there
[2:18:17] preaching on that third pull, Brother
[2:18:18] Israel, and I said, "Listen," I said,
[2:18:20] "God didn't come down and find some
[2:18:22] squirrel guts and some squirrel blood
[2:18:24] and some squirrel DNA." And and y'all
[2:18:25] forgive me. I know I'm going along, but
[2:18:28] I'm enjoying this atmosphere.
[2:18:30] It's a bonafide message atmosphere and I
[2:18:33] love it. All right. You don't get it
[2:18:36] that often sometimes.
[2:18:38] But well, that's that's a sermon for
[2:18:41] another
[2:18:41] day. Stand there preaching. I said the
[2:18:44] Holy Ghost I said God didn't come down
[2:18:47] and say, "Abracadoo, Abracadoo, I make a
[2:18:50] squirrel out of
[2:18:51] you." I said, "Folks, there was nothing
[2:18:54] there. There was nothing there but a
[2:18:57] prophet took a hold of Mark 11. And he
[2:19:00] said, "If you say," and he spoke and
[2:19:02] seven squirrels come into existence. I
[2:19:05] said, "God didn't have nothing to work
[2:19:07] with." But seven squirrels come into
[2:19:10] existence. And I said that same God is
[2:19:12] right here in this building tonight. And
[2:19:14] when I said that, Brother Snow, I don't
[2:19:15] know you, you might have been there. I
[2:19:17] don't know. It's been a few years ago.
[2:19:18] When I said that, I watched the power of
[2:19:20] God come in that building. And I said,
[2:19:22] "Right here, right now, there may be
[2:19:24] something missing, but God is able in
[2:19:26] this atmosphere." The third pull is
[2:19:28] right here. He's able to do it for you.
[2:19:30] And when I said that, the next year I
[2:19:32] went back and Brother Murphy Wong, how
[2:19:34] many knows Brother Murphy? Brother
[2:19:35] Murphy Wong, he come to me, said, "But
[2:19:37] Andrew," he said, "Have you talked to my
[2:19:38] daughter yet?" I said, "No." He said,
[2:19:40] "Oh, I got to get you to her. You got to
[2:19:42] talk." We went over there and there was
[2:19:43] her husband. There was her. She said,
[2:19:45] "But Andrew, I was missing something in
[2:19:47] my body and I couldn't have a child."
[2:19:49] She said, "I've been to the doctors. The
[2:19:50] doctors told me they could perform a
[2:19:52] surgery and by that surgery, they could
[2:19:54] they could help me be able to conceive a
[2:19:56] child." She said, "But I was just
[2:19:57] believing God." She said, "Right there
[2:19:59] last year when you was preaching that,"
[2:20:01] she said, "I thought, God, if you did it
[2:20:03] for squirrels, you can do it for my
[2:20:05] body." And she said, "I laid claim to
[2:20:07] that promise." And she said, "I went
[2:20:08] home and the next morning," she said, "I
[2:20:10] got up and I took a pregnancy test by
[2:20:12] faith." She said, "I didn't tell
[2:20:14] nobody." She said, "But last year, I
[2:20:16] came to winter camp with a positive
[2:20:18] pregnancy test." She said, "And this
[2:20:20] year we're holding the baby." Amen.
[2:20:24] I said, "Sis, when did you have the
[2:20:26] surgery?" She said, "Brother Andrew, I
[2:20:28] didn't have it." She said, "The creator
[2:20:30] put something in my body and I was able
[2:20:32] to bring forth a child." Are y'all
[2:20:34] hearing me tonight? That same God is
[2:20:36] right here.
[2:20:40] He's in this building tonight.
[2:20:43] You may you may be a young person and
[2:20:45] you may you may feel like God don't love
[2:20:47] you and the world's against you and you
[2:20:48] ain't got no future. But let me tell you
[2:20:50] tonight, I'll tell you what a prophet
[2:20:52] said. He come down the end of he cares,
[2:20:54] do you care? And he said, 'You may not
[2:20:56] care. He said, 'But he's here to create
[2:20:58] a care.
[2:21:02] I said, oh, dear God, wherever I preach
[2:21:05] this message, the creator can come right
[2:21:07] in there.
[2:21:09] And he can create a care in your heart.
[2:21:14] This is real, folks. We have been led to
[2:21:16] believe these things.
[2:21:18] Can I say this to you? I didn't have
[2:21:20] time to read you the quotes, but he said
[2:21:21] it very beautiful. He said, "They'll
[2:21:23] never persecute us, and they'll never
[2:21:24] cancel us
[2:21:26] out." He said, "The torch lights of
[2:21:28] freedom will burn till the coming of the
[2:21:31] Lord." Somebody say, "Brother Andrew,
[2:21:33] one day there's going to come a bride
[2:21:34] revival." Let me tell you what a prophet
[2:21:36] said. He said, "What Pentecost was
[2:21:38] looking for is happening right now."
[2:21:41] Pentecost was looking for something to
[2:21:43] happen. And he said, "It's happening
[2:21:44] right in front of you." Amen.
[2:21:47] You love him tonight. I wonder if we
[2:21:49] could play that. Only believe. Only
[2:21:51] believe.
[2:21:54] I I say it to you as plain as I know
[2:21:57] how.
[2:21:58] Folks, as long as you
[2:22:00] believe, as long as you believe, Abraham
[2:22:04] said, "Accumulate these promises in your
[2:22:06] heart." I love it. And what a believer
[2:22:09] has spoken, what a believer accumulates
[2:22:12] the promises of God, God is here to
[2:22:14] impute those promises unto
[2:22:16] you. Now, you know what he said? He
[2:22:18] said, "They shall lay hands on the
[2:22:20] sick." And he said, "They shall
[2:22:22] recover." You know what he said? He
[2:22:24] said, "They shall cast out devils in my
[2:22:26] name."
[2:22:27] Is that what he said? You know who that
[2:22:30] they is?
[2:22:31] [Music]
[2:22:33] I'm looking at they.
[2:22:37] they is you. I want you right now in
[2:22:40] brotherly conduct, Christian conduct,
[2:22:42] brother to brother, sister to sister,
[2:22:44] husband to wife, and godly order. I want
[2:22:45] you to lay your hand on someone next to
[2:22:48] you. I want you to join right now in
[2:22:52] faith. The word of God has been preached
[2:22:55] and the prophet of God said, "As the
[2:22:57] word is preached, the devil is cast
[2:22:59] out." We have preached this message
[2:23:01] tonight and the devil is cast out here
[2:23:04] tonight. Amen.
[2:23:06] The devil has been cast out here. The
[2:23:09] spirits of doubt and unbelief and
[2:23:11] confusion and and and and all those
[2:23:13] things the devil would love to restrict
[2:23:15] you with to preach in the word is cast
[2:23:16] that devil out. Now, right here in this
[2:23:19] building tonight, all things are
[2:23:20] possible to them that believe.
[2:23:24] Do you believe? Do you believe?
[2:23:27] Do you believe you're in position
[2:23:29] tonight for a miracle? Do you believe
[2:23:31] you're in position tonight for
[2:23:33] deliverance?
[2:23:35] Almighty God, all across this building,
[2:23:37] believers have laid their hands up on
[2:23:40] one another. Now, Lord, we stand here as
[2:23:42] sons and daughters of yours. Father, we
[2:23:44] stand here as sons and daughters who
[2:23:46] have been bought by the blood of Jesus.
[2:23:48] Father, we have been birthed by the
[2:23:50] birth of the word. And Lord, the devil's
[2:23:52] done everything he can to destroy the
[2:23:54] faith of this generation, to destroy the
[2:23:56] faith of these believers. But Lord, your
[2:23:58] prophet told us, "Greater is he that is
[2:24:01] in us than he that is in the world." And
[2:24:03] Lord, as they lay their hands upon one
[2:24:05] another, fulfilling a promise of your
[2:24:07] word, we rebuke every devil of doubt. We
[2:24:10] rebuke every demon of unbelief. We come
[2:24:12] against every spirit of skepticism. We
[2:24:15] come against every critical devil. We
[2:24:17] come against every demon of fear, every
[2:24:19] complex Satan. We expose you in the name
[2:24:22] of the Lord Jesus Christ, every demon of
[2:24:25] perversion, every demon of Leoa that
[2:24:27] will try to arrest the lives of these
[2:24:29] young people and claim them for his own
[2:24:31] fulfillment. Satan, I adjure thee in the
[2:24:34] name of the Lord Jesus Christ come away
[2:24:37] from the children of God. And may the
[2:24:38] power of the Holy Ghost, the same
[2:24:40] anointing that filled the upper room,
[2:24:42] may it fill every believer here tonight.
[2:24:44] May it fill the fibers of every Holy
[2:24:47] Ghost filled child here tonight. Lord,
[2:24:49] may the shackles fall off. May the
[2:24:51] restrictions come off and may liberty
[2:24:53] return. May the power of the Holy Ghost,
[2:24:55] may it return without restriction. May
[2:24:58] the Holy Ghost be revealed right here in
[2:25:00] the human flesh of the bride. Lord, we
[2:25:02] ask you tonight, dear God. Lord, take us
[2:25:04] beyond homemade theologies. Lord, take
[2:25:07] us beyond restrictions. Oh God, take us
[2:25:09] beyond the fear of revelation. Lord,
[2:25:12] take us beyond the fear of the things
[2:25:14] that your prophet taught. Lord, put us
[2:25:16] in swimming waters tonight, Lord, that
[2:25:18] we may be able to swim in the promises
[2:25:20] of God. Lord, may every Holy Ghost
[2:25:22] fililled believer here tonight, may they
[2:25:24] receive a refreshing, Lord. Father, I
[2:25:27] claim it for this church. I claim it for
[2:25:29] this pastor. I claim it for this family.
[2:25:31] I claim it for this assembly. In the
[2:25:34] name of Jesus, may the dynamics of this
[2:25:36] word, may it burn with fire. May it burn
[2:25:39] with authority. May it burn out every
[2:25:41] feeling. May it burn out every unbelief.
[2:25:43] Oh God, burn. Holy Ghost, burn. Holy
