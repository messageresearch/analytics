what is being said Lord we thank you for it just be with us now in the name of Jesus Christ we ask amen you can turn to Revelation 6 we'll be reading from the 9th to the 11th verse and we'll be uh starting at paragraph As far as the uh recording 387 to 458 it'll be about 21 minutes this morning verse 9 and when he had opened this fifth seal I saw under the altar the soul of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long O Lord holy and true thust thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled let's sing only believe only be only be all things are possible [Music] only only [Music] only be all things are possible only brother Branda I heard a noise and I looked over this way and here come a bunch of man young fellas all in age about 20 they had dark hair and blonde hair and and they all had white robes on and barefooter and they run to me begin to huging the H precious bre I thought I turned back around there I was still laying there and I thought W this is strange and just then a voice went to talk him I never see the voice he said you have been gathered you have been gathered to your people then some man picked me up set me way up on a big high thing like this I said why did you do that said Earth he was the leader and I said well I I don't understand this and that voice talking to me I never could see the voice now just above me talking to me I said well if I if I have passed on I want to see Jesus I said he was so is all my life I want to see him and um so they said you can't see him now he's still higher they is below the altar in see the sixth placeat where man goes see not the seven where God is seventh Dimension the six and they were and they were all there and they passing by and I said look like they were actually millions of them I never see and I sat there these women and men still run about hugging me call me brother and I sat there and then a boy said you've been gathered to your people like Jacob was gathered to his people I said all these my people or all these bandoms he said no they're your Converse to Christ I looked around and there's a real pretty woman run up she looked it's all about the same she threw her arm around me and she said oh my precious breth she looked that and I thought my she looked like an angel and she passed by and that boy said didn't you recognize her and I said no I didn't recognize said you led her to Christ when she was past 90 said you know why she thinks so much of you I said that pretty girl was past 90 yeah said she can never change no more now so that you s precious brother I thought oh my and I was afraid of this well these people are real amen they wasn't going anywhere they wasn't tired being there and I said well uh why can't I see Jesus said well now he will he will come someday and he'll come to you first and then you'll be judge said these people are your converts that you've LED and I said you mean by being a leader and he'll judge me he said yes and I said does ever leader had to be judg like that said yes I said what about Paul he said he'll had to be judged with his well I said if his group goes in Soul of mine because I preached exactly the same word I said were he baptized in Jesus name I did too I preached and millions screamed out at said we're resting on that Hallelujah I thought my if I only knew this before I come here I'd make people come here they can't afford to miss this why look at here and then and he said now someday he'll come and then I in here we neither eat drink or sleep we're just all one well it isn't perfect it's beyond perfect it's not Sublime it's beyond Sublime there's no name can you can't think there ain't no words in the vocabulary and say it you've just arrived that's all and I thought well this this would be perfect and then what are we going do next said then when Jesus comes and we're and he judges you or for your ministry then we go back to Earth and take up bodies well I I never thought about then that's exactly the scripture so then we go back to Earth and take up bodies then we eat we don't eat here neither do we sleep said we eat down there but we go back to the earth I thought my isn't this wonderful oh my and I was afraid of it why was I afraid of dying to come to this well this is perfection plus Perfection plus Perfection this is wonderful see we're right under the altar that was it they're right under the altar waiting for the coming Hallelujah go get the ones that was sleeping in the the the body sleeping in the dust to raise us again come by rais us up like Jesus come through Paradise you brought up Abraham Isaac and all them was waiting the first resurrection they entered into the City and appeared to many perfectly SC scriptural the vision was that or whatever it was it was perfectly scriptural and then I said well isn't this wonderful and then I isn't that one I heard something nicker like a horse and I looked in my little saddle horse that I used to ride Little Prince I thought so much of him here he would stand there by me and put his head over on my shoulder to hug me like I used to give him sugar you know he put I put my arm around I said Prince I know you'd be here I felt something leak my hand there's my old kundo when when Mr Shar and you're poison him I swore I'd kill Mr shark for I about 16 years old he par gave him a dog Button my daddy caught me with the rifle going down and shoot him right in police station and I said I'll kill him I said well I want to order the dog's great I I said Fritz you've been a like a companion to me youve clothed me and sent me to school when he got old I was go take care of you now this kills you I said I promise you Fritz that he won't live I said I promise you he won't live I'll catch him on the street sometime walking then I'll run right over you see I said I'll get him for you but you know what i l the man to Christ baptize him in Jesus name and buried him at his death I got converted about few years after hlu I've seen things different man see I loved him instead of hat me so then but I there was FR stand there looking me on the hand and I I look I couldn't cry nobody could cry it's all joy you couldn't be sad because of all happiness you couldn't die CU of all life you could get old cuz all you that's it's just prect I thought oh isn't this wonderful and the millions all my I was right home see and and just then I heard a voice and it Cried Out said all that you ever loved the reward for my service I don't need no reward he said all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you God has given to you I said praise the Lord I feel funny I thought what's the matter I feel funny I turned around look and on the bed my body was moving I said oh I don't have to go back surely don't don't let me go but the gospel had to be preached just a second I was on the bed again like that no more about two months ago that you heard it read and the businessman's voes went over the world see and brother Norman in here I suppose he's in here somewhere tonight he translated all F Sate and pamplets went everywhere and ministers wrote in many of them and said one here I tell this very one been hundreds of them of course this one R said brother Brandon your vision in the businessman's voice and I appreciate Tommy Nichols although he isn't with the businessman no more I don't know why but he isn't but he put it in there just right what I said right there in that trinitarian magazine he said where I were Paul baptized in Jesus name and command that people do the same I've done the same see he put it just the way it was and so then uh I thought my and this Minister wrote in said brother Bram your vision which it could have been a vision said I don't want to say translation if Paul if I was caught up into this first heaven and seen that what about Paul that was C come up into the third Heavens what that he said he couldn't even talk about it see if he was caught up if it was a ketchup I don't no I can't say I couldn't tell you but this Minister said brother brand your vision sound very scriptural and all right until you talked about a horse being there said a horse in heaven said now see that ecclesiastical man wisdom mind see he said heaven was made for human beings not horses well I sat down Billy my son here put the letter right here in the old church office about three or four months ago I said my precious brother I'm surprised at your wisdom but and your knowing of the scripture I did not say that I was in heaven amen I said it was in a place like paradise because Christ was still above see but I said if it might satisfy you uh you turn over to Revelations 19 and when Jesus comes out of the heavens of heav he's riding on a white horse and all the saints wom are riding [Music] abolutely up in that same place there was one looked like an eagle and one looked like an O where's them horses that come got Elijah just goes to show you see the human mind just wants something to pick on that's right now I notice but I was just thinking as this precious Godly brother John I just thought it be a good place to inject that just before closing see if John looked over there and them was of his Brethren see his Brethren had had to suffer a little then see the Lord God permitted me to see my brethren and the saints that were waiting for the coming of the Lord notice they were not under the altar of sacrifice mine was but these was they were Martyrs see mine wasn't under the martyrs altar now I want you to listen real close now I'll close honest just 10 minutes at 10 o'cl I have just cut it off and finish it tomorrow they they were not my the ones that the Lord showed me the bride she was not under the martyr's BL no the sacrifice altar of the martyrs but had received white robes by accepting the part Grace of the Living Word Christ had given them a white Rob I do not think by the opening or I do think rather by the opening of this fifth seal as I believe that it's open to I've did it with good conscience with clear Revelation before God not trying to just make it think because I always was against the organization never would belong to him but it's open to me now and I do think another thing by the opening of this fifth seal in this day straightens up a Doctrine right here that I might speak of of Soul sleeping I realize that there's people in here that does believe that see in a soul sleeping I think this disproves that they're not sleeping they are alive their bodies are sleeping but the soul not in the grave they're in the presence of God under the alt here is where I differ with a precious brother a teacher and I know I know I see some of these people sitting here that I realize that this is a great teacher he's a doctor in a doctor of divinity uh p h lld d and he's a he's a real good man too I think he's gone on at this time but he was a good man and a good writer and it's uh brother Ur Smith the author of Daniel of Revelations now to you people who are a follower of his teachings see I I don't I'm not just don't want to say this arrogantly but I just see but brother Smith and trying to support see and trying to support Soul sleeping there he mentions that the soul sleep and there is no alar of sacrifice in heaven that the only alar spoke of is he he beli is in heaven is the altar of incense but to you dear people people and not differ than my brother I probably hope to meet him on the other side see not differ with that great teacher but just to show you how this disproves that see it disproves it the opening of this seal in this last day it just takes SCE they didn't come out of the way they're alive they're not dead notice notice this now now if there's no alar of sa sacrifice in heaven where is the sacrifice for sin laying the lamb there has to be a place where that slaying lamb bloody is laying there or the blood is now the incense was the odors odor stuff that they burn which the Bible said was the prayers of the Saints if there isn't No sacrifice on the altar then the prayers cannot be received it's only by the blood on the sacrificial altar that lets the prayers go through to God brother Smith was wrong not disagreeing with I think I made myself clear with brotherly love and respects for his great work see but he was wrong the fifth seal has opened now many other things if you call it I'm waiting for my question to see all right now where was the the slain wounded bleeding bloody lamb for atonement for these odorous prayers notice the Bible says if this Earthly Tabernacle of our dwelling be dissolv we have one already waiting that's where I seen those Saints see watch want a baby excuse me again sisters for this plain talk before young women but look when a mother is has conceived and that little bunch of muscles is twisting and jumping you understand it is a natural body and just as nature is performing the Natural Body did you ever notice your wife before the little ones is born she always right her long last becomes real kind sweet if she hasn't been all her life will be there you ever notice how saintly or kind of a feeling you notice a mother and you see some sinner out there make fun of a mother that's a pregnated woman I think that's ridiculous That's Life coming to the world but did you notice around that mother seems to be a sweet feeling what is it it's a little spiritual body spiritual life waiting to come into that little body as soon as it's born now it's only begotten but when it's born it's born the spiritual body unites with the Natural Body and then the Bible teaches that we are now begotten of God we're begotten of the holy spirit that in US is Christ a Son of God being formed in it and when this Earthly body be dissolve this spiritual body comes from the bowels of the earth there is a there body waiting to receive it if this Earthly Tabernacle is dropped there is another body to receive it this Mortal body puts on immortality this testial puts on Celestial this see what I mean there is a natural body that's sinful but in its making just like it is another body that we go to and I am so grateful to God that I can say as your pastor and brother I've seen those people so help me in that body and handle them with my hands that's right notice watch look at Moses Elijah after Moses had died and Elijah been taken into heaven he stood here on Mount Transfiguration with his senses of speech hearing understanding and talk to Jesus before the crucifixion what kind of body he had look at Samuel after being dead for about two years was called back into the the cave that night by the witch of indor and talked to Saul with language hear SA all spoke back and for new things that was going to happen still his Spirit hadn't changed he was a prophet when Elijah's Spirit comes upon the manle will driving just like Elijah he'll go to the Wilderness he'll love the Wilderness he'll be a hater of immoral women he'll be against organization he'll pull no punches for nobody and that's just that's that'll be his Spirit it was each time to come Moses will be the same person now and we find out in Revelations uh 228 the same thing now are to settle it for those who those Souls I watches under the altar of the breaking of this seal that had been slain in the time between the death of Christ and the going up of the church the Ian group and all that and true Jews are their names on the book if you'll watch my brother according to the scripture they could talk cry out speak hear and had all five senses not sleeping in the grave unconscious they were very much awake and could talk speak hear anything else amen is that right amen oh help us two minutes amen I'm sorry I kept the half no I could I want to say that see but look here is to the best of my understanding the best and according to the Revelation that was given me this morning just before Daylight by the Lord Jesus Christ there is the open fifth seal to go with the other four Hallelujah Hallelujah by his grace he gave it to me his grace to you and I we thank him for it and with his help I intend to live closer the as I can live teaching others to do the same thing until I meet him with you in glory when all things are over amen I love him for this and it's the best of my knowledge to it and I truly believe with all my heart that the true

so we um certainly honor the Lord this morning um appreciate each of you that's gathered we know and believe that the Lord has something very special for us amen amen let's take our scriptures and turn in the Old Testament in second Kings chapter 2 very very familiar portion from the word of God these two great prophets and we see the the shift of of power the successor of Elijah and um Second Kings we turn there chapter 2 when you have that you can say praise the Lord and it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elijah into Heaven by Whirlwind that Elijah went with Elisha from gilgal and Elijah said unto Elisha Terry here I pray thee for the Lord had sent me to bethl and Elisha said unto him as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they went down to bethl we'll take one more scripture found in First Kings chapter 19 team in verse number 19 maybe we'll start a little bit higher than that the Lord verse 15 and the Lord said unto him go return thy way to the Wilderness of damasca Damascus and when thou comest anoint Hazel to be king over Syria and juu the son of nimi shall thou anoint to be king over Israel and Elisha the son of shapat of Abel molah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room and it shall come to pass that him that escaped the sword of hesel so J Who slay him that J Who Shall Elijah slay and him that escape it from The Sword of Jus shall Elisha say slay yet I have left me 7,000 in Israel all the knees which have not bowed unto ba every mouth which hath not kissed him so he departed and found Elisha the son of shaat who was plowing with 12 Yol of oxen before him and he with the 12th Elijah passed by him cast his mantle upon him and he left the oxen ran after Elijah and said let me I pray thee kiss my father and my mother then I will follow thee and he said unto him go back again for what have I done to thee and he returned back from him took a Yol of oxen slew them boiled the flesh with the instruments and The Oxen and gave unto the people they did eat the then he arose and went after Elijah and ministered unto him and we're just going to take some time this morning and speak on Elijah and Elisha and how Elisha cried for this double portion Elijah and Elisha let's pray one more time lord Jesus I pray you'll help us this morning to deliver your word in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated you know we see this attitude of Elijah as it pertains to Elisha we see him um it looks like he's not real thrilled about Elisha following him you know the Lord tells Elijah the prophet tremendous prophet of God he was anointed and the Lord tells Elijah uh you're going to leave your ministry is over over now go anoint juu go anoint Hazel and then go anoint Elisha which will be the one that will take your place and you know you don't see this all the time in the scripture where you can see a great tremendous Ministry and then the answer to who is next in charge is answered while they're alive we see it with Moses and Joshua and we see it here in this scripture here but we've seen it here even those of us that have been around a little bit you'll see a Ministry like a a a great ministry that will flourish a pastor will start a work it will grow it will get bigger and it'll grow and then the question always comes up who's second in charge who's going to take his place afterwards and it always causes a little rub or a little problem and I seen it and I've heard it said because our city dealt with that here five since 2015 we had some great Mighty Men of God that have crossed over and it left the city a little bewildered how many know what I'm talking about sure absolutely and this is this is normal and I've heard it and I've traveled and I've heard people say well those oldtime Brothers they didn't do it right they should have named who was going to be second in charge they should have put that in place um before they left they should have put those things in order before uh they left and I and I um and I I thought about that brother Chuck and I try to inter internalize that thought but how easy is that tell me how easy that is to let someone to take your place say take a husband and wife that've been married 40 years that one of those spouses die and then you just go replace it with another just plug in and continue on does it work that way no Sor don't work that way there's Dynamics there's a lot that goes to it you're dealing with people feelings memories and so if God's hand is in over it it's going to be tumultuous and even when and I told this to a couple of the brothers and even when it has been noted who's in charge even when it has been established he's going to be the next in charge it still don't work out right so so who who has the answer of who who's next in line well God has that answer and it's amazing how God does it he picks and he chooses who he wants it's his choosing it's not a political vote it's not getting the Summons of everybody it's God who chooses that and when God chooses it it's always the right choice can I get a witness we see this this um Dynamic here with Elijah and Elisha so as we as we as we uh look at the Old Testament second uh Kings chapter 2 that we read here Elijah is now telling Elisha um to stay here we're we're in betho or we're in gilgal stay here I got to go somewhere else and Elisha says with with wisdom with Revelation he says as my soul lives I will not leave you wherever you go I'm going okay fine he goes to bethl and the Lord through Elijah tells Elisha stay here I've got to go to another place and Elisha says again as the Lord lives I will not leave you I'm gonna stay with you there's something that affected Elisha's life to where he was going to stay with this Prophet no matter what and even the other prophets in the city they came and they they have their two cents as everybody does they have their opinion as everybody does and they tell Elisha hey you know what your leader is leaving today you know he's getting old and what y'all gonna do over there when when Elijah has to go what y'all gonna you know he has to leave say I know it hold your peace can I give you modern turns on that AR you mind your own business I see what you see I feel what you feel I don't need you to tell me what we all see are you praying for me are you praying for the situation anybody can stand out and say oh you know I knew that was coming I knew it's gonna happen so what you do about it very tender timing so Elisha says hold your peace I know that so prophets on one end and telling them this pressure from Elijah to stay here but he was committed to staying with Elijah now where does this commitment come from why is he why is he so infatuated with this other man Elisha is so caught up with Elijah that when Elisha comes to his house for the very first time he takes his mantle and he just touches him with his mantle and then Elisha drops everything that he's doing and he runs after Elijah and says give me a little time I'm with the ministry I see what's going on this is what I'm supposed to be doing can I come with you give me a little timing what did Elijah say oh yeah brother here come here let me make it easy for you come here brother yeah we want you to come please don't be offended he's like what I got to do with you go on back go sit down don't come out don't follow me go go this is the this is the attitude of Elijah to Elisha and so what does Elisha do does he listen does he listen to Elijah no he does not listen to him because he caught a revelation of what was taking place and what was taking place is something happened in Elisha's life that had never happened before he came in contact with his ministry his life's Ministry it'll answer all the questions for him and so he goes back he takes the 12 yolks of oxen that he was plowing with and he takes the instruments from the oxin and he kills all the oxen boils their flesh that's a lot of meat feeds all the people kisses Mom and Dad goodbye and he leaves so what is this telling us what a commitment on Elisha's part what is he doing what is he showing he's showing that he's not coming back to this career path that he was once in the way that he used to work and the the ministry that he used to operate on under he's now making a major change in his life and he's not selling the animals he's killing them and I don't know you know any kind of person that has an animal that you work with you know oxes we used to or cows are used to work with horses will'll work with dogs we work with they're guard dogs they dogs we used to hunt it's a working relationship but with that working relationship there comes a little friendship there with that animal how many know what I'm talking about the animals have a spirit and they like to see you they know where their food is coming from they know where the fellowship where something that's lovely and there's a relationship there for for Elisha to go and kill these 12 oxin is saying a lot now most more times than not if you have animals that you work with that this is his livelihood you have to know how to work with those animals so you can get your job done and so this relationship was was established there and you know for most human beings most of us give our animal animals names don't we we have a rabbit at home I say we we have a rabbit at home and I don't know what the name of this rabbit is to today we've called I think we had it for a year maybe two years we've called it all kind of names will Joo came over little will Joe we said he asked what the name was he says we don't have a name what should we name he says name it Garcia and I said okay fine well sometimes he's Garcia or he or it or whatever it is I really don't know but you know there's a relationship that you develop with whatever animal it is and this this no doubt has to be a working relationship that Elisha has with these 12 yolks of oxis so for him to go and slay them is saying a lot there's something took place in the touching of a piece of cloth a mantle from one man to another man he just touched him with it and from there he followed Elijah as a servant now this type can go so far and there's many many types throughout the scriptures and through the message that we can bring to you this morning and one of the great types that brother brandham gives and the scripture gives us is that Elijah is a type of Christ and and Elisha is a type of the church so as Elijah is getting ready to leave here from the earth he now has this younger Junior Ministry following him and in following him he has committed himself self to stay with Elijah so take your Bibles again 2 Kings chapter 2 quickly in verse number six and Elijah said unto him Terry I pray thee here for the Lord had sent me to Jordan and he said as the Lord liveth and thy soul liveth I will not leave thee and they too went on so first it was a g second it was bethl and now they're here at Jericho each time it looks like it appears like Elijah is discouraging Elisha from going forward but he continues on and the 50 men of the sons of the prophets went stood to view a far off and they too stood by Jordan and Elijah took his mantle wrapped it together and smokee the waters and they were divided hither and thither so that they went over on dry ground and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee and Elisha said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me what a request he's asking this man to let a double portion of your spirit to come upon me and he said thou has as a hard thing verse 10 nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so and it came to pass as they still went on and talk that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and Horses of fire and parted them both aund and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven so finally after these three stages we see that the real reason the real purpose the real desire that Elisha had was granted to him as the question was asked what can I give to you what have I to do with you Elisha what can I what can I give to you this was after gilgal this is after bethl this is after the Jordan where Elijah takes the mantle he smites the Jordan River and it Parts supernaturally they two go across the Jordan River and then Elijah finally after all of the relationship that they had with each other Ministry Elder minister to younger Minister he asked the question and it's a beautiful question it's It's a Wonderful opportunity a question you won't get asked too many times probably in your life this is a question that's going to change everything for you Elisha he says what can I do for you before I go do you want this mantle do you want my the books that I used to read do you want my special notes do you want do you have anything you want from me you want me to leave you my property do you want my wealth do you want all the things that my Ministry has accumulated and Elisha looks at him he Saidi want a double portion of your spirit wow where did that come from where did a question like that come from how could this man contrive or conceive to ask such a question m beautiful opportunity and Elijah tells him you've asked a hard thing difficult thing what you just asked for probably nobody's ever asked me that before but you've asked it and and and God's going to give it to you if you see me when I go if you see keep your eyes on me when I go you're gonna have what you ask for oh my now now he finally confirms that me follow him is correct keep my eyes on you yes keep your eyes on me and you see me when I go boy that's uncomfortable because I'm not taking my eyes off of you you want to get something to eat I'm right with you you need to take a little break I'm right in the break room with you whatever you're about to do I'm going to keep my eyes on you and the Bible says and it came to pass no set time no set amount of moments or minutes just keep your eyes on me and when I go you'll get a double portion of my spirit now this Chariots of Fire horses come on fire and they part the two so they're both separated and the Chariots capture Elijah and take him into the wellward and Elisha sees him and when Elisha sees him he cries out these famous words what did he say anybody know what he said what' he say my father my father thank you sis Elisha saw it and he cried my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more he took a hold of his own clothes rent them in two pieces he took up also the m mantle of Elijah that fell from him he went back and stood by the bank of Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and he smoke the waters and said where is the Lord God not of Abraham not of creation the Lord God of Elijah where is the god of Elijah I know who Elijah is where is his God at I can read about all kind of other gods and all kind of other anointed people but I know God was with Elijah where is the god of Elijah you know what church every believer should ask that question every message believer should ask that question you should ask that question in your own life and where the Lord God of Elijah when he had smitten in the waters they parted hither and thither and Elisha went over now what does it mean when he says my father my father the Chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof how many knows what that means you want to try I won't embarrass you too bad well let's let the prophet I don't know what it means either all right but let's let the prophet tell us what it means is that okay here what the prophet of God says here in the message the eror of God's Deliverance 1956 August the 1 so then when he went down there and he seen him he respected him he said my father my father the Chariots of Israel and the horse in other words my father my my father you're worth more than all the Chariots of Israel and all the horsemen thereof and how true that is I say tonight though Elijah was considered a Holy Roller a fanatic by the modern world yet his presence in that nation was worth more than all the horses and chariots that they had and I'll say tonight that a good old fashion Holy Ghost tent meeting is more to protect us than all the atomic bombs that we can create in a million years so what is he what's the value of Elijah to the nation what's the value now everybody couldn't see it but the value to that nation was tremendous you're more valuable than the UN more valuable than the Pentagon more more valuable than any defense system alarm system H uh self-protection you are more valuable than all the Chariots and the horsemen thereof this is what Elisha was saying to Elijah how many can say that today about the word of the Lord that you're under today that is more valuable don't let the devil fool you that is the most valuable thing you got is a revelation of God's word for this day that is the V that is the protection that is the keeping power that is the ministry that is the strength that's why we're here today because of that great power and this is what Elisha saw so when Elisha sees this in Elijah he asked the correct question and the correct the correct request T was to get a double portion of this Spirit now there's a a number of things that has to be really worked out with in this these stages here that we see in second Kings chapter 2 gilgal the first place that Elisha and Elijah come to was what brother brandom calls the Christian confession and that was the first stage and we all have to come there Christian confession but we don't stay just there we got to move on you'll see many people even in our churches in our assemblies they'll start and more people start but they don't continue on five years down the road they're stagnant 10 years down the road they're still tripping on the same things they were tripping on before they're still caught up in the same immature things that they were before but I want to go from gilgal to bethl don't you and bethl what was that bethl bethl means the house of God so he went from Christian confession to the house of God which you're in the right place now but we don't just stay in the house of God we got to go to Jericho what was Jericho um Jericho or to the Jordan was death coming up to the Jordan going to this place where you would now you would now leave from the past and move forward to your future you're dying out to who to yourself dying out to your self willll you know those prophets watching from afar can see that double portion come on Elisha and when they saw it come upon them they went and says oh my you really got the spirit and they begin to uh serve him and they bow down to him it says and many people no doubt want this double portion but you got to cross over uh Jordan you got to cross over with death to yourself before the question is even asked what can I do for you today now how many wants a double portion of the Holy Spirit of course we do but how many want to self regulate and bring themselves to an old cross and die to their self-will that's always the rub is dying to your self-will dying from the things of the world to the things that God has for you it's a greater price it's a greater sacrifice and so once he goes through these stages the opportunity is given to him to ask now now in asking he asked a very I mean it was an enormous request that he asked for it was a great thing and the prophet of God tells us that God actually wants us to ask for big things he wants us to ask for the maximum it's actually unlimited of what you can ask for unlimited Faith unlimited Love Unlimited Power unlimited strength you can ask him and he's got it in abundance for you but many of us don't ask maybe we're embarrassed to ask maybe we'll ask but we don't really believe that we'll receive it so let's go into the message just for a moment here the prophet of God say says this here in the message Elijah and Elisha how beautiful Christ did the same before he left as God's witness he made a preparation of a church and ordained that there would be Witnesses all the way through the church age Plum to the end of the age and I think after he throwed a garment on him when he was plowing Elijah and he killed the ox he took the Yoke and so forth and made a feast as they roasted the meat told his father and mother goodbye and followed Elijah now notice how Christians as soon as they become anointed how they're tempted sometimes but Elisha was a prophet and Elijah says you ter here the Lord has called me to gilar so he said as the Lord liveth and your soul liveth I will not leave you I like that going to stay right with him he started and now he's going through we used to sing a little song I'll take the way with the Lord's despised few drop down to paragraph 31 now the third stage is coming on but the church still follows on Elisha following Elijah and when he gets across down to the Jordan Jordan is a meaning of separation or death you've heard many times s when I come down to the Chile Jordan Jordan was death the Lutheran age followed by and so did the Methodist Methodist age but we come to another age now the age of dying out all your worldly pleasure God has got to do something with you in order for you can for he could give you the Holy Ghost got to die out get dead you don't die out you can't you remember life can only come out of death a seed can only die anything else can only die and out of death comes life out of death of Christ comes the resurrection of life and the only way that you can tonight become alive of faith in God is die out to yourself and symptoms everything around you and become alive die out die out to symptoms die out to circumstances die out to everything else and become alive in Christ let me ask you this morning is there something in your life that you can die out to is there something in your life that needs to be dead I mean not put to sleep not put on quiet but like put to death Lord kill that out of me let me die out to every worldly thing Lord so that I can move on past Jordan and get to asking the things that I really really desire in my life amen is there something you can die out to today now when they got down to the Jordan time to cross over he made the way then when he crossed over the stage of the Holy Ghost Church now I want to ask you something so what do you want he said that a double portion of your spirit come upon me that's the way to ask for it don't be scared ask for the whole lot Jesus said you have not because you believe you have not because you believe you ask not you ask not because you believe not ask abundantly that your joy may be full ask a whole lot God just don't make me a little bit better make me all the way well don't just let me have enough religion to make myself miserable kill me out to sin that I can live in Christ that's right amen I believe that's the Cry of every believer here today is really dying out to the things of the world the prophet of God continues in the message inspiration 1956 and he says this here notice Elijah he knew where he was standing before God therefore he was fearless and when he got ready to go and he and he was put he put his blanket or his robe upon Elisha Elisha Cut Loose every Shoreline everything he killed the ox and burnt the sacrifices separated from everything to follow God that's the way we got to do it that's the only way there is of coming to the Lord Jesus Christ exactly right burn up the things behind you cut loose everything if your Associates or your associations rather is taking you into pool rooms or taking you into beer parties taking you to car parties all these other places cut the thing loose when you come to Christ get rid of every bit of it come to him with the Holy hands lifted up saying God be merciful to me a sinner no matter how long you come to belong to church that doesn't have nothing to do with it so many cruel things are happening to people today and they are going out in that shape because they have trusted in the church instead of Christ notice the next thing they taking place to show that they were a type or the antitype Elijah come back when he met with Elisha he said he was going to another place gilgal Elisha said as your as the Lord liveth and your soul liveth I'll not leave you why he done cut loose everything else he only had one thing to follow that was God I can't go back to my work I done burn it up I kissed my father and mother goodbye for the last time on this Earth so I'll go with you that's the way men do when you cut loose every line that's right he said I'll go up to the school of the prophets so brother Ram continues on there very nicely paragraph number 34 in that same message and when they Cross Jordan which means Jordan always been the death sign and when they crossed Jordan Elijah turned around and said what would you that I would do unto you that a double portion of your spirit be sent upon me said you've asked a great thing God wants us to ask for big things my God he don't run out of blessings up there you can't ask for two to much could you imagine a little fish about that long out in the middle of the ocean saying I better not drink much of this water because it might go dry well that's just as unreasonable as it would be or more so reasonable than to be to think that God's blessings would ever be exhausted to a Believer all Heaven belongs to you how many you know that God wants you to ask for big things what's big that you can ask for today what is that what does that look like to you you know it's got to move past a looking at what other people are asking for this goes down into your own heart and your own life really the sincerity of your life and your heart really comes down to what you really want from the Lord Jesus Christ this is another level Saints I believe with all my heart this is more than just coming to church this is more than just being like what the other churches and other Christians are being like this is not me following other pastors to see how they do it this is me getting my eyes off of other pastors churches and people and put my eyes on the anointing where is the anointing at it was on Elijah and when uh the requirement was if you can see me then you can have what you asked for and this is what Jesus desires from all of us he wants our undivided attention you know we get so we get we get so bent out of shape when things don't happen our way because we're looking at other people but when our eyes are focused on the master of our ship the captain of your life the one who's leading you and guiding you when you focus in on him then it doesn't really matter what others may say or do or what comes in and what goes it helps you to keep yourself stabilized when your eyes are focused on him and what does he have for you today something greater than you that you ever had before I believe that with all my heart and as I said the other night I believe there's others that believe that too here and if they don't believe it then guess what I'll do it by myself right you'll do it by yourself won't you the church doesn't believe a portion of the word and this group doesn't believe a portion of the word but you can see it's in the word then you can believe it's unlimited to you that's the uniqueness of God's relation relationship to the believer so he it's not like he blesses me and then after He blesses me then he's going to bless you too he I get my turn and you get your turn I got one scoop and you get a scoop it don't work that way you go get your own scoop anytime any place how God wants to bless you let God bless you it's unlimited to the believer what does that mean do mean there's no limits you mean it's unlimited candy unlimited scoops of ice cream unlimited minutes on my phone remember when we got that you remember you used have to pay for each minute you have to watch those minutes I remember somebody call and I just keep hey real quick say what you got to say keep it in one minute because if it goes over two we get charged for two minutes so if you're a Savvy you know that one call you can get everything said in under one minute and just get charged one minute it's on a a minute budget right but how many knows we don't budget like that no more why who's going to get a plan today that has limited minutes you be like man you need to drop that cell phone and come on over here it's unlimited I remember the first time I heard that unlimited minutes my cousin from up in um he's like a cousin from Richmond he's from the you know the streets there is he says Israel I won't tell you what he really calls me said is it's unlimited minutes I was like what unlimited call call call your phone company and ask for the unlimited plan I didn't know it existed and now we all have the unlimited plan and what about God's blessings in the word they used to tell you when you can shout and what you can say Amen to but I'm so glad I got an unlimited plan an unlimited plan of God's blessings for my life no more budgets on your praise get your praise on you can praise him in the morning praise him at noon time praise him all night long amen it's an unlimited plan unlimited requests in you you fall down on your knees you can actually have it all you can claim it all it's unlimited to the believer Jesus said so he said the works that I do shall you do also even Greater Works not greater in the sense no one can do greater than raising the dead but it means more more more of the same great works is that right how many of you have ever seen the dead raised ever been in the service yeah how many youve never seen that be honest never seen a dead raise did you know you can actually ask God to let you see that before you leave from here the deaf ears come open the blinded I see you know that's unlimited we can see that as a Believer huh absolutely Saints absolutely so that's this Elijah and Elisha God wants you to ask for big things great things where I think Pentecost fell brother random says this where I think Pentecost failed paragraph 37 Dro down a little bit he said p with people so organized they can't move with it but God's fire is moving right on just the same and he will do it in every age and never a church through history that ever fa ever revived again you know that they are down and we must not draw boundary lines we must say we believe this and not end it with a period but with a comma we believe this this plus as much as God will pour into our hearts how many of us need to hear that today this plus this plus whatever God pours into our heart that's believing for greater things is that right you know there's a scripture where um you see I got it written down here it's in Kings there where after Elijah is gone and Elisha is now the prophet in instead in Israel and and um Judah is now in a a fight with another Army and they were trying to find a way which way they should go and one of the Kings tells the other king Jehoshaphat he says you know Elisha poured water on the hands of Elijah you know what he was saying was that there's an assoc iation and the prophet brings that out that if he poured water on his hands that means he was around him and being around him there was an association on how he operated and did things and there's an anointing that comes with staying with somebody that is Anointed you might not be where you need to be but if you can find somebody that got their act together that got a prayer life maybe that's living right an auntie a mama a daddy whoever a brother that's handles himself properly you know you can align yourself with them and God will bless you through that little Ministry he does it all the time this is where Elisha picked up many of these blessings from Elijah so he moves forward he ask for this double portion we ask big things God wants us to ask for big things we believe this plus now I'm going to get into just a little area here on sincerity just for a moment and it's hard to question Elisha's sincerity when he put all those animals to death he slew them all and these were workers with him these were his animals that he owned and his character to to row a straight Row the prophet of God brother brandham tells us that Elijah can see that Elisha knew how to row a straight row and keep those 12 oxen in line it was a character so it's like your natural calling always somehow aligns with your spiritual calling they should and this is why we just don't chase after after the money or the position or the power we follow the leading of the Lord because if God is leading you then his leading will lead you spiritually and physically absolutely you say well I'm I'm Heavenly minded I'm reading the word but I can go work anywhere no I don't think so I think you need to consult God before you take a job or even move into a neighborhood I believe you should consult God when you teaming up with another associate on some kind of deal or whatever it is I believe you should consult God on everything because we are believers and our life aligns with the natural places and the natural things that we do we see it all through the scriptures and so we don't take that for granted do we amen somebody so this sincerity comes into to question and I like the way the prophet brings this here I'll take a few places here and then we we'll close now we know that as Elijah and Elisha are walking together Elijah appears to be discouraging him from moving to the next step and what that really is doing is actually strengthening Elisha and his resilience and being able to take to take a punch you can't be a real fighter and all you focus is is on your offense you gotta focus on your defense if you can't take a punch then you won't be a very valuable fighter if you can't take criticism if you can't take everybody you know not like in you you have to be accepted by everybody well you're following the wrong leader because not everybody accepted him and he was right all the time and you're only right like maybe this many times he's right all the time and they didn't accept him and so we're followers of him right and and and you just got to come to grips with it who likes rejection none of us who likes to be talked about none of us who wants you know something bad or spoken on us or a lie or somebody misreading us none of us want that but it's part of the calling and if you can get through that and God give you the strength for the resilience to get through it you can make it through a drought all these other trees out here need water every day but who's watering them trees out in the middle of the desert they're just surviving green as ever 109 115 degrees it's like who's watering them who's babying them that's the kind of believer I want to be you ain't got to water me you ain't got to even look at me but I want to be a survivor in the house of God stable with the word of the Lord in my life waiting for the choir to sing or the organist to come so I can preach better or waiting for the crowd to keep me encouraging keep me moving on those things are good right we like those things but hey can you preach without them can you survive when everybody turns against you can you stick with the vision when nobody else can see the vision or see what you're talking about this is Elijah didn't have nobody encouraging him his leader is telling him to stay here the prophets don't know what they talking about and he's just F he's following this anointing and it led him to the right place and that place led him to the place where he could ask for a great Mighty great thing that would shift his whole life his whole Ministry so you Brothers you sisters you could do the same thing today those moments will come and I believe they're arriving now all the stuff that we seen go on in the name of Christianity in the name of this message I can't keep up with it I don't know what's going up what's coming up next I don't know who's going to backslide next I don't know don't know but I better know who I have believed in and better be persuaded that he is able to keep me from falling he's able to keep me from falling I'm persuaded of that amen praise the Lord everybody the prophet of God says this in the message Jubilee year let's talk about sincerity just for a moment and then we'll close this because I think this all comes down to this in Jubilee year paragraph 102 someone said not long ago said but brother brandom this person was real sincere what the person was living in living in sin oh said I'm sincere I believe the Lord Jesus Christ I said if you're sincere then prove your sincere give up the sin you're living in oh you see there's so much involved I said I thought you were sincere he says well I got to do this I got to do the most vital thing that you can do is come to Jesus Christ no matter what you got to do what's any more important than than being born again so this this opens up in our hearts and our mind just this thought that your sincerity eventually will be an action your sincerity will eventually come out on the outside you're sincere in your heart yes you're sincere in your mind yes it starts there in your heart in your mind but eventually there are actions to prove how sincere you are and you know there's little details like let's just take one real quick Nehemiah chapter 7 veres 1 and two we know Nehemiah he had a great work you know an angel didn't come to Nehemiah and encourage him I read through the whole book a couple times and I read through it again yesterday and I noticed that the Lord didn't really even speak to him and say he he says something like it the Lord put it in my mind or came into my heart like this and he has so many prayers but he didn't have an open angel or open Revelation come and strike him but something just internally started to bother him when it came to the restoration of the walls of Jerusalem he said how's it going in my home he's the cup Breer for uh for another kingdom and he you know the cup Bearer is a very important position you know he's to taste the wine before the king if there's any poison in it you you'll find out you help us find out and that's what his position was but he came he was sad before the king and the King say why are you sad in my presence because he's never was sad before said I heard about my people my homeland and the walls are torn down and broken up and the King asked him so what what can I do for you he say so I prayed to the god of Heaven one little portion of scripture right there in the beginning so I pray to the god of Heaven and then he made his request known and the King says go get it now maybe others thought about it other people Desiring it but it was in his heart it bothered him let me ask you what's bothering you what's bothering you today things in the word of God that's not taking place are we in the coming of the Lord where are we at today is there anything that bothers you like that but this this Nehemiah he goes in what scripture did I call chapter 7 Nehemiah 7 I'll get it here quickly we kind of get spoiled though looking at the screen huh Nehemiah 7 now it came to pass when the wall was built I had set up the doors portions in the Levites verse two that I gave my brother hananiah Nani and hananiah the ruler of the palace charged over Jerusalem for he was a faithful man and feared God above many I like what it says in one of the other translations says he re revered God more than most people do another place says God he fear God more than most men do I thought that's a nice little detail for these two little brothers they're not Heroes of Faith they're not people that we would talk about but the scriptures that when Nehemiah needed what wanted this work done because the Jews now were selling on the Sabbath day and Nehemiah is putting all this thing in order y'all not going to be selling no more here so he kicks him out and then the next night they're waiting at the gate waiting for it to sell he says if you don't leave I'll put my hands on you that's what he said and then so he because these two captains these two men because they feared God more than most men do where are those at in each Church where are those at in the city I certainly want to see that in the mirror a man that fears God more than most a woman that fears God that handles this word more than most it ain't a lot of Elisha there's only one and he had his eyes on Elijah because the anointing was on Elijah and when the time came to ask what you want he says I want a double portion of your spirit once he found out where the anointing was he kept his eyes on that that's our admonishment to you today keep your eyes on where the anointing is there a lot of great preachers great Ministries Rose and Rise many of these Ministries have more tapes than the prophet do because of the link of their Ministries and you can go online and feed on them and you can hear them preach great eloquent speakers can take the Bible and take what the prophet said and bring it together in a more coherent way and we can feed on that but where is the anointing huh where are your eyes supposed to be on Elisha on Christ the Lord Jesus Christ and that representative for for our day God sent him in this day so that we can keep our eyes on the right things is that right you all be encouraged I know sometimes we you know a lot of quotes a lot of quotes a lot of quotes they read a lot of quotes over there you know but what else would we be quoting then you want to hear more of my quotes you want me to make up some quotes and read my own quotes or read Reverend so and so's quotes or go online and read some Bishop so and so's quotes you're all quoting somebody we got to quote somebody Jesus quoted the prophets we're quoting from the Bible we're quoting the prophets and this is the anointing for our day amen I know we don't have a problem with that here but the devil can really you know really make us feel like we're missing something um when we go down that down that path but keep your eyes on that anointing it's unlimited now if you are sincere I'll close with this I have so much more to go but if you are sincere can you prove it so so sincerity isn't just saying I'm sincere I'm more sincere today can you prove your sincerity brother bam says you're sincere then prove you're sincere give up the sin you're living in what I like about sincerity the prophet of God says here the message says I wonder if you could do this in your heart if you're sincere if you would make this promise to God God I from this time standing on my feet seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost I shall constantly pray and wait until you fill me with the Holy Ghost will you make that promise to God by raising your hands I will constantly pray constantly until you fill me with with the sweetness and the goodness of the spirit that's that's sincerely that's really being sincere are we sincere enough I believe brother Bram was sincere as Ministry said the angel of the Lord came in he says this your first pull your second pull if you be sincere it'll come to pass that you'll know the secrets of the heart so here's one level a touch but then if you'll be more sinere here's another level for you now can we be more sincere and what does that look like how does that how do you how do you make that happen where does that start that starts somewhere down in your heart down in your soul I like this in the message thy house and I'll close with this I have two more but I'll read this one and then one more after that okay and the message thy house paragraph number 40 the prophet of God says now I've come to Christ when I was about the age of one of these boys here I guess I was about 20 years old and I served him all this time and I'm 52 or will be 53 my birthday and I can sincerely say that I have never asked Christ sincerely for anything that is it's now that really sincerely asked him anything that was for right but would he give it to me or told me why he couldn't do it and then later on I find out it was a good thing I didn't get it see so he said that he's never asked really sincerely and I shared this with the church in in in Phoenix the other day and I'll share it here again here I've shared it here before but I was talking with um brother Billy Paul on the fishing trip one time we were going driving and I think this was the whole purpose of this trip because we didn't catch nothing and so we was driving long trip me him and one other brother and brother and Billy Paul he said that he so his dad told him that if you really need an answer from the Lord he said go to your prayer closet or where you go to pray and get quiet before the Lord and he says now when you do this you have to be very sincere when you do it and he was sitting in the front seat and I was in the back seat and he turned around and he looked at me again he says you got to be very sincere when you do this but he will answer you he says go to your prayer closet and then before you say anything just think in your mind what your request is going to be he said begin to think on that and meditate on what you're going to ask he says then speak it out and then don't say another word until he speaks to you and he will speak to you but you have to be sincere when you do it now Saints that's the scripture if you ask him he will hear your prayer but what's your motivation and am I really sincere am I really willing to give up whatever he would ask for one more example is with Samson you know when Samson asked for that prayer he says Lord give me strength one more time he knew what it was going to cost him if the Lord did give him that strength he knew this was the end of your life you can stay alive and be a slave and they'll keep laughing and tearing in you or I can answer your prayer it'll be your last one but I'll answer you and he had to think about he had to count of the ca he lost his eyes his ministry had finished prematurely he let God he let he let God down he could have been used even greater what about the great ministry he had he had the anointing on his life think of it he he he didn't even deserve irid he was living wrong but he would just shake himself and the anointing would come on him and he would took the gates of Gaza slew a thousand Philistines with a Jawbone of a old dead mule old dead donkey took the drob on and just 1,100 two a thousand Philistines caught 300 foxes I mean that alone how you gonna catch a fox and then tie his tail with fire you know he he tore a lion this man had an anointing in his life no question about it and here he is at the end of his ministry he lost it why playing around with Delilah the things of the world and she caho him and wooed him and got him to the place and the atmosphere was was just right and he told her his secret his lifelong secret that he had this is what was he was striving from this this was your
