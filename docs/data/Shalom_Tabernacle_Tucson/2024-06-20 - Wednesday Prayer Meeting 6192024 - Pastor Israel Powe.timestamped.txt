[26:05] for all the saints that made it out
[26:07] tonight may may you bless them richly we
[26:11] pray in Jesus name amen amen there's a
[26:15] portion in James chapter 4 we' like to
[26:20] turn there just for a
[26:22] moment in
[26:25] um James chapter 4
[26:33] versus number
[26:36] six and the scripture
[26:39] [Music]
[26:41] says but he giveth more grace wherefore
[26:45] he saith God resisteth the proud but he
[26:49] giveth Grace unto the humble submit
[26:54] yourselves therefore to God resist the
[26:56] devil he'll flee from you you draw nigh
[27:00] to God and He will draw nigh to you
[27:03] cleanse your hands you Sinners purify
[27:05] your hearts you double-minded be
[27:08] afflicted and mourn weep let your
[27:10] laughter be turned to mourning and your
[27:13] joy to heaviness humble yourself in the
[27:17] sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you
[27:20] up amen powerful portion of the word let
[27:24] us uh uh think on these things as you're
[27:28] seated God bless
[27:31] you of course we know in the word of God
[27:34] as the prophet told us the way up is
[27:37] down and we have been talking
[27:40] about receiving more power and I've just
[27:43] been really dealing with this down in my
[27:46] heart and I want to take just a few
[27:48] moments and and
[27:51] uh take a few quotes from Sunday that I
[27:54] didn't get to and and then we'll go to
[27:58] prayer
[28:00] Amen in the message the faith of Abraham
[28:03] so here um brother banam is talking
[28:07] about the young convert and the new
[28:09] convert and as we read the scripture
[28:11] here that um he gives more grace he he
[28:17] resists the proud but he giveth more
[28:20] grace and more grace is more power more
[28:24] grace is more of his love and he gives
[28:26] you more of that he resists your pride
[28:30] he resists the proud but he gives grace
[28:33] to the humble and let's think about that
[28:37] in the message the faith of Abraham
[28:38] brother bam says this in paragraph
[28:41] number 62 he said to the one who
[28:43] believes that is
[28:45] scientifically this is another dimension
[28:48] to the Christian it's another sphere of
[28:51] the holy spirit it's only the same holy
[28:54] ghost that saved you young convert if
[28:58] it's yielding yourself to him so brother
[29:02] random is making it very clear that as a
[29:05] Christian as a young convert that's the
[29:08] holy spirit that lifts you out of the
[29:12] world to believe that the Lord Jesus is
[29:15] the son of God Amen to believe that his
[29:18] word is true it takes something to break
[29:21] you out of what you used to be doing and
[29:24] then now you're coming to church on a
[29:26] Wednesday night yes it's it's a power
[29:30] and that was faith and so brother bam
[29:32] continues in the message of Grace and he
[29:34] says this paragraph 177 he
[29:37] says then as much Faith as you have
[29:41] that's where you live once way down here
[29:44] in the muck of sin now you young
[29:46] converts now you believe you're saved
[29:50] don't you then you raised up here you
[29:53] raised a little higher what does that
[29:57] your faith Faith because you believe
[29:59] you're a Christian now you'll live above
[30:03] that thing now see now if you want to
[30:06] raise a little higher just have more
[30:09] faith because it's
[30:12] unlimited just keep on so this faith
[30:16] that we're talking about the powers of
[30:18] God are
[30:21] unlimited there's more of it for you how
[30:24] many need more amen sure I know a lot of
[30:28] people would say they want more but how
[30:30] many actually need more like it it it
[30:34] becomes a need and when it becomes a
[30:36] need then it becomes your prayer and
[30:40] when it becomes your prayer becomes your
[30:42] expectation it's where your heart is set
[30:45] now it's where you now are it's becomes
[30:48] most the most important thing to you and
[30:51] I believe it's for the believer and
[30:53] brother random deals with this a little
[30:56] bit more in the message going going
[30:58] beyond the camp then I'm going to take
[30:59] an Old Testament scripture just for a
[31:01] moment so he's dealing with the young
[31:04] converts and then he deals um as he
[31:09] talks about this the the most powerful
[31:13] church let me let me take that one first
[31:17] so because we dealt with this on Sunday
[31:21] talking about your soul your thinking
[31:24] and your attitude and that's all in
[31:26] James chapter 4 if you look at it there
[31:28] that we read your soul your thinking
[31:31] your attitude if you can get that right
[31:34] there's a powerful church and this is in
[31:37] the message this is paragraph number 44
[31:40] and it's in the message enticing spirits
[31:42] and brother bam says this here I said
[31:46] why um someone ask if there's wrong to
[31:48] do a certain thing why are you
[31:50] questioning about if there's a question
[31:52] in your mind leave it alone don't do it
[31:55] at all just stay with that when you
[31:58] start to do anything and if it's a
[32:01] question whether it's right or wrong
[32:03] stay away from it don't go into it at
[32:07] all then you know you're right now all
[32:10] things ought to be considered
[32:12] prayerfully first seek you first the
[32:15] kingdom of God and his righteousness and
[32:18] all these other things will be added I
[32:21] am positive sure this morning if men and
[32:25] women could only get into the position
[32:29] of where their soul their thinking their
[32:33] attitude will be perfect in the sight of
[32:35] God that would be one of the most
[32:38] powerful churches that ever existed now
[32:42] think about that Saints my
[32:45] soul my thinking my attitude to get that
[32:50] all in line put all of that in check
[32:53] then there's there's where the power is
[32:57] now does everybody have to come into
[32:59] that maybe everybody won't does
[33:02] everybody have to agree with that maybe
[33:03] everybody won't but I can I can
[33:07] internalize it I can pick that up and
[33:10] make that word work for me because it's
[33:13] unlimited to the believer so brother
[33:16] Trevor I don't have to ask
[33:19] permission to say Amen to anything in
[33:22] the word I don't say can is it okay for
[33:24] me to pray today or should I pray for
[33:27] more Holy Ghost let me ask for
[33:29] permission no you don't have to ask
[33:31] permission for that that's
[33:33] unlimited go get it it's for the
[33:38] believer it's right there in on your
[33:40] knees if you can believe it you can have
[33:43] that that's on you now it's not on God
[33:46] he made the promises that's not on God
[33:49] that's on you my brethren he said the
[33:52] church young men is a dead church that's
[33:54] on
[33:55] you the church y men we got problem
[33:57] that's a you problem that is not the
[33:59] church problem that is not a Bible
[34:02] problem that is not everybody else
[34:03] problem that is on you because the
[34:06] promises are to you the
[34:09] individual now go pick it up and make it
[34:13] work in your life hallelujah amen and I
[34:16] love that freedom don't you brother will
[34:18] I love that
[34:20] unlimited power that's in the word of
[34:23] God that I can actually claim my entire
[34:27] family even my second cousins even the
[34:31] ones that don't live with me even the
[34:33] ones that everybody else rote off I can
[34:36] claim them that's my that's on me now
[34:40] that's
[34:41] unlimited I can pray for all of my
[34:44] family some of y'all can pray for half
[34:46] of yours or the little bit that you see
[34:49] but you actually can pray for all of
[34:51] them that's on you now that's on the
[34:54] believer now the prophet of God goes a a
[34:57] little bit further in this message going
[35:00] beyond the camp and I like this here and
[35:02] he says paragraph number 48 he says you
[35:04] know I was told some time ago that they
[35:07] had a Jet Plane makes them noises we
[35:10] hear around here that shakes the windows
[35:13] it's when the plane has got so fast that
[35:16] it crosses its own sound called sound
[35:21] barrier and when it goes beyond its own
[35:24] sound barrier it's almost unlimited to
[35:27] what it'll do and I think in there that
[35:31] we got a
[35:34] lesson when we go beyond our own sound
[35:38] barrier into the word of God then it's
[35:43] unlimited so you got to get past you you
[35:47] got to get past your sound barrier and
[35:49] all the sounds of negativity and all
[35:52] these other sounds you got to get past
[35:54] you I don't have to worry about
[35:56] everybody else who on what they doing
[35:58] who's here who's not that ain't even the
[36:00] problem I got to get past the man in the
[36:03] mirror and if I can get past the sound
[36:06] barrier in my mind and my thinking in my
[36:09] attitude and then pick up the word of
[36:11] God then it's unlimited to me
[36:15] amen
[36:18] amen it's you don't have to have a bad
[36:21] day how many's ever had a bad day you
[36:25] don't have to have one you can make it a
[36:27] good day it can start out bad but get
[36:30] down on your knees and make it good
[36:32] we're
[36:33] creators and we can create a good
[36:37] day we can create a good
[36:40] attitude we can create an
[36:44] atmosphere as Believers as creators and
[36:47] that's deliberate saints that is the
[36:50] prophet of God says in going Beyond said
[36:52] as it continue says I think we got a
[36:55] lesson when we go beyond our own sound
[36:57] barrier into the word of God then it's
[36:59] unlimited what God can do with the man
[37:03] that's ready to go beyond the camp the
[37:06] camp of man that is now we see that
[37:10] going beyond the camp going Beyond this
[37:13] and so brother vam continues on so we
[37:16] see it's unlimited when we go beyond our
[37:20] own sound
[37:21] barrier now I trust the Lord will bless
[37:24] your heart on these few quotations here
[37:28] tonight and that when we go to the Lord
[37:30] in prayer that we're actually getting
[37:34] our
[37:35] mind our
[37:36] soul and our attitude in line with the
[37:40] word of
[37:41] God
[37:44] Amen that's what I
[37:46] want that's what I need in my life
[37:50] that's what I'm trying to accomplish and
[37:51] achieve in my life if this is my last
[37:54] series of preaching if this is my last
[37:57] service
[37:58] this is my last
[38:00] opportunity then I want it to be well
[38:04] spent my time on my
[38:07] knees this is yes yes that's that's what
[38:11] it is that's exactly what it is it's
[38:14] taking advantage of every
[38:16] heartbeat every breath every moment on
[38:20] the clock every Wednesday taking
[38:23] advantage of that and we have the
[38:25] opportunity to do that the word of God
[38:28] is unlimited to the
[38:31] believer now churches and people limited
[38:34] and they limit themselves but God never
[38:37] put those limits on you you listen to
[38:40] the you look in the word of God and you
[38:42] hear of um deaf ears being open and
[38:47] blinded eyes coming open and even the
[38:49] dead being raised you think you can't
[38:52] see that you think that you can't pray
[38:54] for someone and that happened who put
[38:57] that limit on you you can pray for the
[38:59] sick and they will recover yes you can
[39:02] lay hands on the dead and they'll raise
[39:04] again why by what Authority are you
[39:07] speaking these things on the word of God
[39:10] as you pick up the word in there you can
[39:12] see that it's unlimited to the believer
[39:16] so I'm trying to rise up out of status
[39:19] quo what I did the last 20 years of my
[39:22] life I'm trying to get out of that I'm
[39:25] moving in something greater why because
[39:27] the Rapture is greater and we call
[39:30] ourselves looking for a Rapture that's
[39:33] greater and where am I living today I
[39:36] can internalize these things tonight and
[39:38] take God at his word I want to take just
[39:41] the power of humility and we're going to
[39:44] go on the Old Testament in First Kings
[39:45] chapter 21 very familiar portion of
[39:51] scripture
[39:53] and just read that
[39:59] very
[40:01] soberly and just get a context on how
[40:04] the Lord views
[40:07] humility sometimes it's contrary to our
[40:10] carnal thinking came to pass that after
[40:13] these things that nebat the jezreelite
[40:18] jezreelite had a Vineyard which was in
[40:20] jezel hard by the Palace of Ahab king of
[40:24] Samaria and Ahab spake unto nabat saying
[40:27] give me thy Vineyard that I may have it
[40:30] for a garden of
[40:32] herbs because it is near unto my house
[40:35] and I will give thee for it a better
[40:38] Vineyard than it or if it seemed Good To
[40:41] Thee I will give Thee the worth of it in
[40:44] money and naboth said to Ahab the Lord
[40:49] forbid it me that I should give the
[40:52] inheritance of my fathers unto thee
[40:57] now naab is standing in on something
[40:59] here in this scripture and there's uh
[41:02] three places in the scriptures it's in
[41:03] Leviticus 25 numbers 36 and Ezekiel 46
[41:09] where the Lord strictly commands the
[41:11] children of Israel not to sell their
[41:14] inheritance The Inheritance that the
[41:17] Lord has given them now they can lose
[41:19] that
[41:20] inheritance because someone fell in debt
[41:22] or what not but it was always determined
[41:25] that that inheritance would be restored
[41:28] back through a seven-year release or
[41:32] like in the case with Ruth and Naomi
[41:33] there's a way you can redeem the land
[41:35] that you lost but it was never in God's
[41:37] intention for you to take what he gave
[41:40] you and you to profit off of it to sell
[41:43] it because somebody else wanted it this
[41:45] was God's land so he says this wasn't a
[41:48] business decision this was all about the
[41:51] Lord and Nebo was standing for something
[41:55] and if you don't stand for something
[41:57] something some people say you'll fall
[41:59] for anything you got to have some
[42:01] principles that you're standing on and
[42:03] that's this word and so he and Ahab came
[42:07] into his house heavy displeased because
[42:10] of the word which nebot the jezreelite
[42:12] had spoken to him for he said I will not
[42:16] give Thee the inheritance of my father
[42:18] and he laid down upon his bed and turned
[42:21] away his face and would eat no bread but
[42:25] Jezebel his wife
[42:28] came to him and said unto him why is thy
[42:31] spirit so sad that thou eatest no bread
[42:34] he said unto her because I spake unto
[42:36] nebar the jezreelite and I said unto him
[42:39] give me thy Vineyard for money or else
[42:42] if it pleas the I will give thee another
[42:44] Vineyard for it and he answered I will
[42:47] not give thee my
[42:49] Vineyard and Jezebel his wife said unto
[42:52] him don't thou now govern the Kingdom of
[42:56] Israel arise eat bread and let thy heart
[42:59] be merry I will give Thee the vineyard
[43:02] of naboth the jezreelite so she wrote
[43:05] letters in ahab's name and sealed them
[43:08] with his seal and sent the letters unto
[43:11] the
[43:11] elders and to the Nobles that were in
[43:14] the city dwelling with nabo we'll see
[43:17] how Noble these Elders
[43:19] are she wrote in letter saying proclaim
[43:22] a fast and set naboth on high among the
[43:25] people he set two men sons of Bal before
[43:30] him to Bear witness against him saying
[43:33] thou did blaspheme God and the king and
[43:36] then carry him out and stone him that he
[43:39] may die and the men of his City even the
[43:42] elders and the Nobles who were the
[43:45] inhabitants in his city did as Jezebel
[43:49] had sent unto them and as it was written
[43:51] in the letters which she had sent unto
[43:54] them they proclaimed a fast they said
[43:57] naboth on a high among the people and
[44:01] there came in two children of
[44:03] Bello and set before him the men of
[44:07] bellel witnessed the the the and the men
[44:10] of bell
[44:12] bell say that for me help me bow
[44:16] witnessed against him even against
[44:19] naboth in the presence of the people
[44:22] saying Nebo did blaspheme God and the
[44:26] King Then They Carried him forth out of
[44:29] the city and stoned it with stones that
[44:32] he died how many know this ain't a fairy
[44:35] tale how many know this really happened
[44:38] who are you in the
[44:41] text if you were to put yourself
[44:43] somewhere who would you be in this text
[44:45] put yourself in nebot shoes these people
[44:49] are lying on him they hired Witnesses
[44:53] against him put yourself in the in the
[44:56] shoes of the Nobles and the Elders of
[44:58] the city who get a letter from a
[45:01] powerful woman and tells them do this do
[45:05] this do this where's the men in this
[45:07] city where's the noble ones at you know
[45:11] some people just go along with whatever
[45:14] power is ruling them they don't stand
[45:16] for nothing they have no principles I
[45:19] mean if this was another guy like neot
[45:22] he didn't care he would have just sold
[45:23] his property he' still be alive or he
[45:26] would have kept life but look at these
[45:29] letters come these nobl men the Elders
[45:33] of the city these are people that handle
[45:34] the law of Moses they're gonna shump up
[45:38] charges against this man take him out of
[45:41] the city and stone him I wonder if he
[45:46] pleaded his
[45:48] innocence I wonder if he said that's not
[45:51] true I wonder if he screamed for his
[45:54] life didn't matter they lied
[45:57] they took this man's life and he took
[46:00] his
[46:01] Vineyard now that Spirit of Jezebel we
[46:04] know is still alive today the Bible
[46:06] identifies her in the Book of Revelation
[46:09] that spirit is out there and you know
[46:13] it's it's as easy as
[46:15] this it's just as easy as this why we
[46:19] pick nebot the only reason why they got
[46:20] neighb is because his farm his field was
[46:23] next to the Kings that's the only reason
[46:27] and he wasn't going to budge he was
[46:29] standing for some
[46:31] principles and so his evil man come and
[46:34] get him they Stone him verse 14 they
[46:38] sent to Jezebel saying Neath is Stone
[46:40] and is dead it came to pass when Jezebel
[46:43] heard that nabo was stoned and was dead
[46:46] that Jezebel said to Ahab arise take
[46:49] possession of the vineyard of Nebo the
[46:52] jezreelite which he refused to give thee
[46:55] for money for nebot is not alive but
[47:01] dead and it came to pass when irhab
[47:04] heard the nabo was dead that Ahab rose
[47:08] up to go down to the vineyard of nabo
[47:10] the jezreelite to take possession of it
[47:13] and the word of the Lord came to Elijah
[47:15] the tishbite saying arise go down to
[47:18] meet Ahab king of Israel which is in
[47:22] Samaria behold he is in the vineyard of
[47:25] nebach wither he has gone down to
[47:28] possess it and thou shallal speak unto
[47:30] him saying thus sayeth the Lord hast
[47:34] thou killed and also taken possession
[47:38] and thou shal speak unto him saying thus
[47:40] sayeth the Lord in the place where the
[47:43] dogs lick the blood of nabot shall dogs
[47:46] lick thy blood even thine and Ahab said
[47:51] to
[47:52] Elijah hast thou Found Me Oh My Enemy he
[47:56] answered I have found thee because thou
[47:58] has sold thyself to work evil in the
[48:02] sight of the Lord behold I will bring
[48:05] evil upon thee and will take away the
[48:08] posterity and will cut off from Ahab him
[48:11] that pisseth against the wall and him
[48:13] that is shut up and left in Israel and
[48:16] will make thine house like the house of
[48:18] gerbo the son of nebat and like the
[48:21] house of Basha the son of aijah for the
[48:25] provocation where with thou Hast
[48:28] provoked me to anger and made Israel to
[48:31] sin and of Jezebel also spake the Lord
[48:34] saying the dog shall eat Jezebel by the
[48:39] wall of
[48:40] jezrael him that dieth of Ahab in the
[48:43] city the dogs shall eat him that dieth
[48:45] in the field shall the fowls of the air
[48:47] eat but there was none like unto Ahab
[48:50] which did sell himself to work
[48:53] wickedness in the sight of the Lord who
[48:56] whom Jezebel his wife stirred
[49:00] up and he did very
[49:03] abominably in following Idols according
[49:06] to all things as did the amorites whom
[49:09] the Lord cast out before the children of
[49:13] Israel look at verse
[49:15] 2728 and
[49:17] 29 and it came to pass when Ahab heard
[49:22] those words that he rent his clothes he
[49:26] put sackcloth on his flesh fasted and
[49:30] lay in sackcloth and went
[49:33] softly and the word of the Lord came to
[49:36] Elijah the tishbite saying seest thou
[49:39] how Ahab humbled himself before
[49:43] me because he humbled himself before me
[49:47] I will not bring this evil in his days
[49:50] but in his son's days will I bring the
[49:53] evil upon his house and the church said
[49:57] amen powerful portion of the word of God
[50:00] wouldn't you
[50:01] saying seemed like you know the Lord
[50:04] would have just maybe maybe pronounced
[50:08] judgment on Ahab and Jezebel and dealt
[50:11] with them for the wickedness and the
[50:13] evil that that they did and the Lord did
[50:16] pronounce it upon them but look at the
[50:19] Lord's
[50:20] response to Ahab humbling
[50:23] himself even as evil as what this man
[50:27] did he was one of the worst kings that
[50:30] there were that's right he stirred up he
[50:34] stirred up with him and Jezebel to just
[50:36] a horrible Duo that will last throughout
[50:39] all time their evil and their wickedness
[50:43] but the even this evil man who did all
[50:46] this wrong come to a recognition of
[50:49] humbling himself you see our pride the
[50:54] Lord resists that
[50:57] any level of Pride you you know pride
[51:00] comes in so many forms soon as God
[51:03] blesses you your little pride wants to
[51:06] rise up and think that it's
[51:08] you you're so talented you're so gifted
[51:12] it's you Israel it's you brother man
[51:15] it's you sis it ain't you and and and
[51:21] God resists The Pride but even the even
[51:24] he'll he'll he'll receive a humble heart
[51:29] even if the things you done were evil
[51:32] the Lord will even in the case of this
[51:35] story here he takes ahab's humility he
[51:39] sees it and he tells the prophet about
[51:42] it do you see what Ahab just did did you
[51:44] see what he just did now go tell him
[51:47] it's all gonna happen but not in his
[51:49] days why because he humbled himself now
[51:53] let me ask you something is there
[51:54] something in your heart and in your life
[51:56] that you can humble yourself to
[52:00] tonight your pride will tell you there
[52:03] isn't
[52:04] nothing your pride will lie to
[52:08] you but when you get your heart right
[52:12] and you lying it up properly and when
[52:14] you really get in the presence of the
[52:16] Lord in prayer you'll find out there's
[52:18] some little evil intentions that we
[52:22] have and we want the Lord to remove that
[52:25] I do BL remove it all
[52:29] Lord you know I I'm looking good in
[52:32] front of the Saints I'm looking good
[52:34] here I haven't bothered nobody they
[52:36] can't see it but in my heart I know and
[52:40] he
[52:41] knows and it's not the SE it's not the
[52:44] open sin that I'm talking about that we
[52:45] got to come and make right it's those
[52:48] secret sins it's those little ones that
[52:52] needs to be tuned up and lined up and
[52:54] that's what a prayer meeting is all
[52:55] about humble yourself in the sight of
[52:58] the Lord not in the sight of man oh I'm
[53:01] so sorry you know weeping and crying
[53:03] make sure the camera's on me now I'm so
[53:05] sorry I'm repenting make sure make
[53:08] sure sir they you humble yourself in the
[53:11] sight of people the Bible says humble

[53:15] sight of the Lord and He will lift you
[53:20] up you know your your pride you know you
[53:24] got it
[53:26] you know what that is we want to Humble
[53:28] that present that to the Lord and we
