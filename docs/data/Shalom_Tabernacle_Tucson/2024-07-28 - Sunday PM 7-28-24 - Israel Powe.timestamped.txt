[30:03] [Music]
[30:07] seated amen just before we sing just
[30:10] wanted to share something that God is
[30:14] just appreciate he speaks to us that
[30:16] still Small Voice
[30:17] and just couldn't get a scripture out of
[30:20] my mind yesterday and that was man shall
[30:23] not live by bread alone but by every
[30:25] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[30:27] God and
[30:28] and just thinking on that through the
[30:31] day and then you know just we need to
[30:35] you need to have that more in our mind
[30:37] where it's accessible we don't have
[30:38] access to our phone we don't have access
[30:40] to the Bible but is it in our heart and
[30:44] then just being challenged to to to
[30:46] study more to read more and then the
[30:48] sermon this morning was right in line
[30:50] with that and so just pulled up
[30:53] a
[30:55] the in the table just did a quick search
[30:58] on live by bread alone over 200 results
[31:02] came up and there were um so I went to
[31:05] two or three of them and just this one
[31:07] paragraph and all saying it's was in
[31:09] Satan's Eden brother brandham says to
[31:11] his congregations sometimes these little
[31:13] crude Expressions bring us to something
[31:15] that gets us to study and puts you to
[31:17] reading the word that's what I want all
[31:20] my congregation to do man shall not live
[31:22] by bread alone but by every word that
[31:24] proceedeth out of the mouth of God so
[31:26] read the word study it and study with
[31:28] the eyes of God to give your
[31:30] intellectuals understanding of how that
[31:31] we should live in this present day so
[31:34] just love it when God speaks through
[31:37] different ways to you and and just lets
[31:41] you know he's mindful of you and points
[31:43] you in the direction that you need to go
[31:45] so I know for me I need to spend more
[31:48] time in in prayer I need to spend more
[31:50] time in his word and just for him to let
[31:53] me know that in in multiple ways it's
[31:57] just his his goodness to us so
[32:02] amen this is a song
[32:04] that brother Shelly wrote years ago
[32:08] first time I heard it it was just a
[32:10] special song to me it came on my heart a
[32:11] couple weeks ago and trusted to blessing

[45:40] Zion and the
[45:43] testimony that the Lord is blessing us
[45:46] with his presence and helping us amen
[45:49] amen just a few uh quotes and notes
[45:53] notes that I have here for tonight and
[45:57] um and I'll play a couple portions in
[46:00] the message so you can hear these places
[46:03] where brother Adam talks about the
[46:04] yellow and black serpent the Black Mamba
[46:06] and the Great White
[46:08] Horse and so in Ephesians chapter 6 for
[46:13] our scripture we'll take for we wrestle
[46:16] verse 12 we wrestle not
[46:19] against flesh and blood but against
[46:22] principalities and Powers against the
[46:25] rulers of Darkness of this this world
[46:28] against spiritual wickedness in high
[46:30] places wherefore take unto you the whole
[46:34] armor of God all of it that ye may be
[46:38] able to withstand in the evil day and
[46:42] having done all to stand stand therefore
[46:45] having your loins GT about with what
[46:49] truth and having in the breastplate of
[46:53] righteousness and your feet Shaw with
[46:55] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[46:59] above all taking the shield of Faith
[47:01] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[47:04] all the fiery darts of the wicked and
[47:08] take the helmet of salvation and the
[47:10] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[47:14] God Revelations chapter 10
[47:27] verse 7even but in the days of the voice
[47:31] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[47:35] to sound the mystery of God should be
[47:38] finished as he hath declared to his
[47:41] servants the prophets amen God bless you
[47:44] you may be
[47:45] seated put on the whole armor of God in
[47:48] the the title The Serpent the Mamba the
[47:51] Great White Horse it almost sounds like
[47:54] The Lion the Witch and the Warlock
[47:57] but these are spiritual things that have
[48:00] come to us in this day and I want to um
[48:04] bring them to remind us the reminders of
[48:08] these spiritual happenings that took
[48:10] place now this third poll that we have
[48:15] been touching on a bit and it's just
[48:17] such a blessing to us and as I have
[48:21] shared a few places with you in looking
[48:24] away to Jesus and then also the present
[48:27] stage of my Ministry
[48:30] 1962 as brother bandham kind of just
[48:34] smizes or brings us up to speed on what
[48:37] the third poll is what to look
[48:39] for uh there was a a question that was
[48:43] asked about this third pool in questions
[48:46] and answers number one
[48:49] 1964 and this puts you kind of in mind
[48:52] of where the people were in their mind
[48:55] and their thought patterns as brother
[48:56] Ram was constantly bringing this to the
[48:59] people and not having all of the message
[49:04] the people didn't in that day uh access
[49:07] to it in print format or search format
[49:10] where you can comprehensively study it
[49:14] through those Saints um that were
[49:17] actually in the Tabernacle to hear these
[49:19] things hear bits and pieces um you know
[49:23] we have access to all those sermons The
[49:25] recorded ones
[49:27] and so it gives us a little more
[49:30] information and draws us closer to what
[49:33] this great subject is amen amen and so
[49:37] we can
[49:38] comprehensively just look at it honestly
[49:41] and as we shared this morning that when
[49:44] something is recorded or written down
[49:47] the Lord puts Commandments around the
[49:50] written word to keep it um intact by
[49:56] adding do not take away and don't add to
[49:59] it so everybody can hear it the way it
[50:03] originally came out is that right so you
[50:07] know when if I'm writing a story and I'm
[50:09] a reporter and I've got a dog in the
[50:12] fight then I'm going to skew that story
[50:15] based on my personal experience you see
[50:19] a lot of that in the news today you have
[50:21] news that are far right news that are
[50:23] far left and news that's just any and
[50:26] everywhere
[50:27] and then you follow up the person you
[50:29] find out oh yeah he's a Democrat you
[50:32] follow oh he's a republican you could
[50:34] tell by their you the radio program but
[50:37] the word of God is not
[50:38] so that you know when Moses wrote about
[50:42] he told the Jews told every bad every
[50:45] good thing all the details in between
[50:48] it's a real truth and when brother Ram
[50:52] ministered the word he gave you know
[50:54] he's on the field preaching in one place
[50:57] he said that he got so anointed under
[51:01] conviction that he preached himself
[51:04] under conviction you see you don't come
[51:06] up here with the anointing or the fire
[51:09] of God and just going to preach your own
[51:11] thing and stop when you want to stop no
[51:14] no no that's not a true gift a gift is
[51:17] submitting yourself and then the Lord
[51:20] takes over and now the prophet he said
[51:23] he preached the message and he preached
[51:25] himself under conviction you don't put
[51:28] that in your notes I'm sorry that's that
[51:30] happens under the inspiration and this
[51:32] is what you know this Dark Age that
[51:35] we're looking at as I said that young
[51:37] lady that was shot and killed and it was
[51:40] horrible the former president shot at
[51:43] and almost you know uh murdered
[51:47] assassinated and then one of our young
[51:50] young men there brother Dylan shot at on
[51:52] the job and then it's it's just total
[51:55] darkness it's crazy on every level we
[51:58] know that this is the darkness that the
[51:59] scripture talks about that evil and
[52:02] darkness would persist in this last day
[52:05] that's where we are Saints and this is
[52:07] where we're living and so the admon
[52:10] admonition of the Lord is to put on the
[52:13] whole armor of God that's all of it and
[52:16] I don't want to I don't want to to make
[52:19] you feel like you're not studying enough
[52:22] or you have to be a Bible scholar to
[52:24] catch what the third pull is that's not
[52:26] the point of it it's you're sitting down
[52:29] for whatever steak dinner whatever kind
[52:32] of meal and you're just eating from his
[52:35] table all right and that's what you're
[52:37] eating from and there's something for
[52:39] everybody that's God's word that's these
[52:42] Visions it's all of it and the example
[52:46] for us as human beings for the first
[52:49] time it was expressed this third pull on
[52:52] human beings was on wasn't a minister
[52:55] wasn't a scholar
[52:57] was somebody who handled the word that
[52:58] can you know there was a great scholar
[53:00] in the midst the do Lee Veil great man
[53:04] and others that followed the ministry
[53:06] but when God wanted to express this
[53:09] third pull on human beings what did he
[53:12] use a little widow woman that had
[53:16] Brokenness in her life hurt poor but she
[53:20] had a heart that wanted to give and
[53:23] she's sitting there listening to a story
[53:25] that's absolutely ridiculous I mean how
[53:28] many people can believe that a man spoke
[53:32] a squirrel into existence you tell me
[53:36] how that's going to go over at your job
[53:38] or wherever you work how what kind of
[53:40] conversation is that you know you can't
[53:42] talk like that unless you talking to
[53:45] another crazy we got to it's crazies
[53:48] that talk like that and we know when we
[53:50] got crazies that's when we talk like
[53:52] that but we zip that up at the family
[53:55] functions don't we
[53:57] the homecomings and the you know the
[53:59] non-believers they don't understand that
[54:01] a third pool spoke a squirrel into
[54:05] existence but here the little sister
[54:07] heard it and she did something that we
[54:10] all can do she said that's nothing but
[54:14] the truth now I don't know if she was a
[54:17] notetaker or not I don't know what kind
[54:19] of Bible she had I don't know how many
[54:21] books or tapes she had of the Prophet
[54:24] but she had that's nothing but the truth
[54:27] and that is
[54:29] enough and this is where we just take
[54:32] what God has given us we read it we
[54:35] internalize a part that applies to us we
[54:38] say Amen to it and God does the rest
[54:41] we're not trying to make Scholars every
[54:43] or I'm guilty because I need to know to
[54:45] be able to explain the third pool I just
[54:47] I'm dealing with the attitude the shrug
[54:49] shoulder attitude that like you don't
[54:51] even look at it to me that's a tragedy
[54:54] because the Lord spent his time to get
[54:56] it recorded so you can hear it and then
[54:59] you're going to shrug your shoulder no I
[55:01] think the attitude is wrong so if we
[55:04] approach it with the right attitude then
[55:06] there's always something in there for
[55:08] everybody so now this this um question
[55:14] that was asked just to put you in frame
[55:17] of some of the people's thinking back in
[55:22] 1964 this is question number 248 it's
[55:25] paragraph 1 158 in the message questions
[55:28] and answers number one this the third
[55:31] pull and it's speaking the word it seems
[55:34] entirely possible for you to speak the
[55:38] word and one would be completely and
[55:42] fully
[55:43] restored placed entirely ready for the
[55:46] Rapture in the Resurrection the son of
[55:49] man this is so or is it not and if you
[55:53] would do this if Pro and you would do
[55:56] this if properly pressed upon would you
[55:58] not Escape all these things it's got a
[56:01] ditto there Escape all these things and
[56:03] stand before the son of man now that
[56:05] question sound like somebody that was
[56:08] listening that's somebody who was like
[56:11] listening to what he's talking about
[56:13] like where you get this question
[56:15] from Brother random didn't pose the
[56:18] question somebody posed a question this
[56:20] third pool that you're talking about you
[56:23] speaking the word the squirrels and all
[56:25] these things you're talking and
[56:26] happening it seems like you can speak
[56:29] and totally speak a man ready for the
[56:35] Rapture and what did Brother R says
[56:38] absolutely not no that's not what he
[56:39] said that's not what he said what he
[56:42] said now my dear friend see now I think
[56:45] here that you got you got uh you got a
[56:48] good
[56:49] statement yes sir yes sir now that would
[56:52] be so you said brother bandam in other
[56:54] words here's what I don't think I I
[56:56] don't polishing up on what you said but
[56:59] I believe I can make it a little clearer
[57:01] to people you're believing because of
[57:03] the spoken words and things like that
[57:06] that he said about and all of you here
[57:09] witnessed the squirrels and all these
[57:11] other things that's been done but did
[57:14] you notice that was sovereignly given
[57:16] yes I never asked him that's it Lord let
[57:19] me do this Lord let me speak these
[57:21] things like that do these things there I
[57:24] never asked him that he by own Divine
[57:26] will came to me and said go do this see
[57:30] I wasn't asking one thing about it Moses
[57:33] never asked to go down in Egypt but God
[57:36] but was God that sent him down to Egypt
[57:40] drop down to paragraph
[57:42] number 161 what would I do if it was in
[57:47] my power it is in I have the authority
[57:49] to do it but I have to wait for orders
[57:52] to do it see I have to be just W as
[57:55] willing to die this morning on
[57:57] that sorry I have to wait I have the
[58:01] authority from God to do it but now when
[58:04] he gives the orders she'd go back home
[58:06] well see I know that is the truth see
[58:10] just be as willing to die this morning
[58:12] on that as I be in anything see that's
[58:16] the truth so brother Banner makes it
[58:18] very clear that that question coming
[58:21] from the people you get those questions
[58:23] they come from somewhere they're hearing
[58:25] something which brings those questions
[58:27] and brother bandam deals with this third
[58:31] pool and that it is in existence how
[58:35] many heard that this morning we have it
[58:38] here it's
[58:39] inexistence I believe it has something
[58:41] to do with the Rapture he said how many
[58:45] remember that from this morning and so
[58:48] these are beautiful things they're
[58:50] wonderful things they're not the devil
[58:53] wants to make scarecrows out of them or
[58:56] areas that like we don't have to have
[58:58] the answer to everything but we can say
[59:01] what he said and it's beautiful the
[59:05] pillar of fire is with this message it's
[59:09] Vindicated God already Vindicated so I
[59:13] don't have to vindicate nothing I don't
[59:15] have to feel apprehensive about talking
[59:17] about something that the Lord already
[59:21] Vindicated it's true I'm on that side I
[59:26] can't explain it all but I know this is
[59:28] the side I'm on I'm on this side over
[59:30] here I'm with the prophet that's where
[59:32] I'm staying with that's where you are
[59:34] amen and so we approach it that way
[59:39] now this um the purpose of reading these
[59:43] kind of quotes it's to stimulate your
[59:47] faith and I think I did as a minister I
[59:51] think you would have done a good job if
[59:54] the people leave the meeting
[59:56] wanting to go into the word about what
[1:00:00] you was talking
[1:00:01] about not you know he's a great preacher
[1:00:03] do what did you get out of the service
[1:00:06] did you did it make you go okay let me
[1:00:08] listen to that tape now and that is
[1:00:11] effective that's what that's what when
[1:00:13] I'm listening to the message it makes me
[1:00:15] want to get closer to God and that's the
[1:00:18] whole purpose of it all and so whatever
[1:00:21] level you're on this word is there for
[1:00:24] that and you know the the the the word
[1:00:27] comes and these things are there to
[1:00:30] stimulate something that's already there
[1:00:32] brother Bram talks about that how many
[1:00:36] Christians they have faith they don't
[1:00:38] know it and then the prayer line when
[1:00:40] he's um operating the gift he's there
[1:00:44] trying to stimulate their faith to raise
[1:00:47] up their faith that's laying
[1:00:50] dment and um he says that in many places
[1:00:55] here
[1:00:56] I won't take any more time on it but he
[1:01:00] deals with it in questions and answers
[1:01:04] 1957 and
[1:01:07] um that word doormat it means I I think
[1:01:11] I got a definition on it here real quick
[1:01:14] I did something is laying
[1:01:17] there having normal physical
[1:01:20] function suspended or slowed down for a
[1:01:23] period of time in or as if in a deep
[1:01:27] sleep temporarily inactive or
[1:01:31] inoperative
[1:01:33] doormat it's capable of becoming active
[1:01:38] and sometimes we have faith and these
[1:01:40] quotes those of you are raised in the
[1:01:42] message you've kind of heard Whispers of
[1:01:44] some of these quotes I've been in the
[1:01:47] message for a number of years I've heard
[1:01:50] statements on the third pool and those
[1:01:52] things but when you go back and you
[1:01:54] start to read them for yourself that L
[1:01:56] that brings something that was inactive
[1:01:59] back active again and then you start
[1:02:02] looking like putting the time
[1:02:04] constraints of where we are and how evil
[1:02:06] it is and the next step is the rapture
[1:02:09] then the third pool should be somewhere
[1:02:13] getting ready to jump off um to get us
[1:02:17] ready for the Rapture or great sweeping
[1:02:19] move to get us ready for the body change
[1:02:22] and the Rapture and that's what this
[1:02:24] third pool is and that's what these
[1:02:27] things are now brother
[1:02:30] brandom uh deals a little bit with this
[1:02:35] he brings out something talking about
[1:02:38] this as I brought this morning how the
[1:02:41] evil forces have gathered themselves
[1:02:44] together to become more evil and you
[1:02:48] know if and you know so and even you
[1:02:53] know we're fighting a battle there's
[1:02:55] dark Spirits they'll come even in a
[1:02:58] church while you're preaching those
[1:03:00] spirits will have your mind on something
[1:03:02] else people are streaming movies or
[1:03:05] texting or emailing and the word of the
[1:03:08] Lord is going forth they'll do it in a
[1:03:09] tape service they'll do it because
[1:03:11] that's the hour that we live in but the
[1:03:14] word of the Lord the word of the Lord
[1:03:17] commands attention from everyone and in
[1:03:21] this and in these three experiences of
[1:03:24] brother brandham he show shows us how
[1:03:26] these Spirits work but here he says in
[1:03:29] the message indictment
[1:03:31] 1963 in paragraph number 70 he says this
[1:03:36] here and this just puts us in a time
[1:03:39] frame a Time block okay and it places us
[1:03:43] somewhere paragraph number 7 he says I
[1:03:45] must show and will show that The Same
[1:03:48] Spirit is on the people today that
[1:03:51] brought the first
[1:03:54] crucifixion and doing the same thing I
[1:03:57] must do that if it's going to be a
[1:03:59] crucifixion that they've crucified I
[1:04:02] must show to the people that that the
[1:04:06] same attitude in the people today is
[1:04:09] doing the same thing spiritually that
[1:04:12] they did physically then they crucified
[1:04:16] physically Jesus Christ the son of God
[1:04:19] and now today by the same word by the
[1:04:22] same Holy Spirit and the same word I
[1:04:24] wish to show the church is they're where
[1:04:27] they stand that they are doing the same
[1:04:31] thing today and the Bible said they
[1:04:33] would do it and prove that this is the
[1:04:36] day that we're living living in look at
[1:04:39] what he says he says it could not been
[1:04:42] done a few years ago I say 50 years ago
[1:04:46] it could not been done but today this is
[1:04:50] very timely it could not have been done
[1:04:52] maybe 10 years ago but it came can be
[1:04:56] done today because the time is run out
[1:05:00] we are at the end time and I believe as
[1:05:02] a servant that we are just about to
[1:05:04] cross from this land to another now he
[1:05:09] makes this statement in
[1:05:11] 1963 so 50 years from that would be 1913
[1:05:14] it couldn't happen 10 years from that
[1:05:18] 1953 it couldn't happen but he says
[1:05:21] today is the day that this could happen
[1:05:25] this put Jesus Christ uh to death
[1:05:28] crucifying the word he places that time
[1:05:32] frame so he really narrows it down
[1:05:34] doesn't he he brings it down to show
[1:05:36] that this is the day that we are just
[1:05:40] about to cross over into another land so
[1:05:45] that's the time frame that we're living
[1:05:47] in we showed you that the third pool is
[1:05:50] in existence but won't fully be made
[1:05:53] manifested until the s squeeze happens
[1:05:57] so he giv us those time frames we're
[1:05:59] looking for the rapture we see the
[1:06:00] squeeze about to happen and all of the
[1:06:04] evil coming up now in this message um
[1:06:09] I'll bring them in order so in
[1:06:11] 1961 he talks about this yellow and
[1:06:14] black Serpent and this message here he
[1:06:19] had to leave the ministry because there
[1:06:22] was an element of people that said he
[1:06:25] was
[1:06:26] uh the anointed Messiah the Christ and
[1:06:30] he said that it was a
[1:06:32] spirit that gets on people so but look
[1:06:36] how God is expressing this now he's
[1:06:39] going to give an experience to the
[1:06:42] prophet with the with this black and
[1:06:45] yellow snake and so let's go right to
[1:06:46] the tape there I believe I gave my
[1:06:49] sister the the the the portions of where
[1:06:51] it should be where we'll stop and start
[1:06:54] I think that one is 7 minutes or so
[1:07:00] and thank you your church down there
[1:07:02] Billy and mornings there these licensed
[1:07:05] from all over the country here I say
[1:07:07] yep one here and one there that's where
[1:07:10] I think the bride will
[1:07:12] be two in the field I'll take one leave
[1:07:14] one so
[1:07:16] forth and
[1:07:18] I I don't
[1:07:23] want paragraph number 25 24 this is in
[1:07:27] the message Revelations chapter 5 number
[1:07:30] one is that
[1:07:33] it no that's Paradox so it's the it's
[1:07:36] the other one we'll get to that one
[1:07:40] later this is in the message Revelations
[1:07:42] chapter 5 number one
[1:07:44] 1961 June the
[1:07:50] 11th paragraph number 25
[1:08:00] all right maybe she has to download it
[1:08:14] see paragraph 25-
[1:08:18] 43 and because of that it forces me to
[1:08:22] say I'm leaving the ministry
[1:08:26] uh is because that there is something
[1:08:30] arose up amongst the people that's caus
[1:08:33] me to do it that is that I have been
[1:08:37] taken from my bracket of a minister or a
[1:08:40] brother and being called Jesus
[1:08:43] Christ and so uh call and that would
[1:08:46] brand me as an
[1:08:49] antichrist and I'll meet God as a
[1:08:52] quitter before I would meet him as an
[1:08:55] Antichrist to take away from him uh I
[1:09:00] heard of it a few years ago and I
[1:09:03] thought it was a joke and I met a couple
[1:09:06] of Brethren which I don't see neither
[1:09:07] one of them in the meeting this morning
[1:09:10] two or three of them one time in a
[1:09:11] fishing trip and they approached me by
[1:09:14] the subject of saying brother brandom
[1:09:16] aren't you the anointed Messiah the
[1:09:20] Christ and I put my arms around the neck
[1:09:23] of both Brethren or all of them and I
[1:09:25] said Brethren as much as I have tried to
[1:09:29] be a true servant of Christ I would not
[1:09:32] that you would say such a thing as that
[1:09:35] and if it would ever be said of me then
[1:09:38] I will leave the field with a clear
[1:09:42] conscience and you who do that will be
[1:09:45] responsible for every soul that I would
[1:09:48] have saved during that time see for
[1:09:51] taking me from the field and I thought
[1:09:55] that ended it and I heard it a few more
[1:09:57] times but it wasn't so and the other day
[1:10:00] in
[1:10:01] Canada a brother showed me a little
[1:10:04] ticket of a thing he's packed in his
[1:10:05] pocket said William brandham is our
[1:10:08] Lord baptizing in the name of William
[1:10:10] brandham and a little a precious it been
[1:10:13] an enemy if it had been my enemy I would
[1:10:15] have know it was a joke but a precious
[1:10:18] darling brother come up to confess his
[1:10:21] sins and his wrongs and his faith in me
[1:10:24] as being Jesus Christ and I have got
[1:10:28] letters at home and calls from Chicago
[1:10:31] and different places asking me if I
[1:10:33] believe that Dogma now I got all kinds
[1:10:37] of letters that's come in the last few
[1:10:39] days and calls some different places so
[1:10:43] uh uh saying that I was
[1:10:46] Christ
[1:10:48] Brethren that is a horrible disgraceful
[1:10:53] ungodly life of the
[1:10:57] devil I am your
[1:11:00] brother now that would run any person
[1:11:04] from the field that would make anyone
[1:11:08] that loves Christ run from the very
[1:11:10] thing I went to the Lord here not long
[1:11:13] ago when I first heard it about a year
[1:11:15] ago and then I went to the Lord and He
[1:11:18] referred to me to the scripture that
[1:11:20] when John came forth of preaching that
[1:11:24] they hadn't had a prophet on the earth
[1:11:25] for so many years until it would uh they
[1:11:29] was All Amazed in their hearts thinking
[1:11:31] maybe John was the Messiah so then I
[1:11:35] John they went and asked him and he said
[1:11:37] that he was
[1:11:38] not you read that Luke the third chapter
[1:11:42] 15th verse and so then but that kind of
[1:11:47] quietened down so I let it go like that
[1:11:49] but then when it come to this then I
[1:11:52] know that something must be done now I
[1:11:55] say this that the
[1:11:57] visions and the angel of the Lord that
[1:12:00] appeared at the river if this is to be
[1:12:03] my last message or last thing to the
[1:12:06] Church of the world those things are
[1:12:10] truth as far as the angel of the Lord
[1:12:13] anointed Christ or something that was
[1:12:16] too much for me so I just couldn't stand
[1:12:19] that and so then about I come after
[1:12:23] leaving the meeting at Canada I found
[1:12:27] out that way up in the eskimos or the
[1:12:29] Indians up there it got among
[1:12:32] them and so it just tore me all up in
[1:12:35] the hunting trip that I had planned so
[1:12:37] long I could not take it I was afraid of
[1:12:40] a hunting accident if you understand
[1:12:42] what I mean I got so shaky worse than I
[1:12:45] am standing here now and I just couldn't
[1:12:47] stand it any longer to think that 31
[1:12:50] years of ministry went down the devil's
[1:12:52] gutter pipe into the When I'm Gone what
[1:12:55] would they say there he is that's
[1:12:56] exactly what it was all the influence
[1:12:58] that it had upon the people then you see
[1:13:00] where to be I be an antichrist and I
[1:13:03] just couldn't stand it I thought I'd
[1:13:05] rather die here in the woods like I fell
[1:13:07] on my gun or something and and I seen I
[1:13:10] was then I thought about my little
[1:13:11] Joseph and so forth that had to be
[1:13:13] raised and I was no conditioned to hunt
[1:13:16] so I just left the woods and come home
[1:13:18] and I've been before about eight or 10
[1:13:21] days in such a fix I thought I was
[1:13:23] losing my mind and I just asked
[1:13:27] everybody stay away from me and let me
[1:13:29] alone because I'm in such a fixed and
[1:13:32] nervous and upset and all tore to pieces
[1:13:35] and I wondered if it would have been
[1:13:37] some enemy in mine it would have been
[1:13:39] all right but I would just laughed at it
[1:13:42] and went on but when it come to be
[1:13:44] precious
[1:13:45] Brothers precious sisters then that's
[1:13:48] what hurt me and I said Lord the great
[1:13:50] things too great for me I'll just have
[1:13:52] to walk out leave it in your hands I I
[1:13:55] don't know nothing else to do a few
[1:13:57] nights ago to make it
[1:13:59] sure I had a a visitation from the
[1:14:03] Lord and I seen a precious one a baby a
[1:14:08] serpent which was yellow and black and
[1:14:11] telling me and right along and and the
[1:14:13] thing struck me on the leg but the blood
[1:14:16] was so rich it didn't take effect on me
[1:14:18] and I looked down there's where been bit
[1:14:20] before and I turned quickly with a gun
[1:14:23] and shot this the thing and it hit it
[1:14:26] right in the middle of the thing and a
[1:14:28] brother said I turned with my gun to
[1:14:30] shoot its head off and he said don't do
[1:14:33] that just pick up the stick L there by
[1:14:35] and when I turn my back to pick up the
[1:14:36] stick it wiggled into some water just a
[1:14:39] small puddle of water I said Well it
[1:14:42] can't hurt very much longer now because
[1:14:44] I believe the brother realizes the
[1:14:46] Brethren that what would happen I said
[1:14:49] it'll it's morly wounded so it'll die
[1:14:52] and I asked many of my members of my
[1:14:57] church here in this Tabernacle brother
[1:14:59] Neville and I Has Come approaching me
[1:15:01] with that same
[1:15:04] question brothers sisters haven't I
[1:15:08] tried to be a true servant of Christ
[1:15:10] before you have not I tried to be your
[1:15:14] brother wherever it is it's a spirit on
[1:15:18] precious
[1:15:20] people many people has asked me that but
[1:15:23] it's it's a spirit
[1:15:26] but I hope that the day that it receives
[1:15:28] a deadly wound and will die out quickly
[1:15:31] so I can return back to the
[1:15:33] ministry until
[1:15:35] then I'll ask you each one pray for me I
[1:15:40] don't know what I'll
[1:15:42] do got place up for sale I just can't
[1:15:46] stand it I I I stay around I'll go
[1:15:48] completely start MTH and I'm I ask you
[1:15:51] to pray for me and remember if you've
[1:15:53] ever believed me
[1:15:56] if youve ever believed me to be a
[1:15:58] servant of Christ remember that is an
[1:16:02] eror it's falsely thus sayth the
[1:16:07] Lord it is wrong have nothing to do with
[1:16:11] it I am your
[1:16:17] brother amen can the church say
[1:16:20] Amen so we see that brother bam
[1:16:23] identified
[1:16:25] that it was a
[1:16:26] spirit that gets on precious people and
[1:16:30] the Lord gives them this experience with
[1:16:33] this black and the yellow snake amen and
[1:16:38] so this um next one on this the Black
[1:16:42] Mamba we've I'm sure we've played it a
[1:16:45] number of times and we've laid it out
[1:16:47] for you we' like to play that for you
[1:16:49] here it's in the message Paradox
[1:16:52] 1961 this is about 7 or N9 minutes or so
[1:16:56] we'll play this one then we have one
[1:16:58] more and then North it not is that okay
[1:17:01] Amen in the message
[1:17:03] Paradox and this is where the whole
[1:17:06] start of because later on in the
[1:17:09] ministry brother R talks about I'll ride
[1:17:11] this Trail again in the street ports
[1:17:14] meeting in Louisiana I'll ride this
[1:17:15] Trail again well this is where it starts
[1:17:18] and
[1:17:18] so it's brother
[1:17:21] um um I'm sorry I'm sorry that's the
[1:17:25] last one that's the Great White Horse
[1:17:27] shorter but this Paradox message is
[1:17:31] where brother Ram is talking about this
[1:17:32] mamba snake and I'll let him go into
[1:17:35] that so I think our sister has the the
[1:17:39] parts on that so we'll play it amen and
[1:17:43] then I came to
[1:17:45] myself I thought could I possibly have
[1:17:49] could it
[1:17:50] been that I was
[1:17:53] dreaming uh causes night time see a
[1:17:56] vision is something that you see with
[1:17:58] your eyes open just like a dream you're
[1:18:00] looking right at it and you're you're
[1:18:02] conscious that you're standing like
[1:18:04] you're on the platform and you're you're
[1:18:06] standing here but yet you look like
[1:18:07] you're in a dream you can't explain it
[1:18:10] there's no way to do it see it's God's
[1:18:12] works and God's ways are unexplainable
[1:18:15] amen they have to be accepted by faith
[1:18:18] then as I uh sit there a little bit the
[1:18:22] side of this chair down all of a sudden
[1:18:25] hear it come back again then I knew then
[1:18:28] it was
[1:18:30] vision and then when I come into the
[1:18:33] vision again it seemed that I was lifted
[1:18:37] up and setting on a a highway a narrow
[1:18:42] Highway with some brother I never knew
[1:18:46] who the brother was I looked around I
[1:18:48] said now I am sure and know this is
[1:18:51] Vision the Lord God is here
[1:18:55] and seemed like everybody was afraid I
[1:18:57] said what's everybody so afraid of and a
[1:19:00] voice came and said there's such danger
[1:19:03] in these
[1:19:04] days there's a great hideous thing
[1:19:07] that's death when it strikes you and I
[1:19:10] heard the weeds mashing down and I
[1:19:12] looked and here come A huge monster
[1:19:15] snake crawling through the weeds I
[1:19:18] thought now knowing this is Vision then
[1:19:20] I shall see what this uh this animal or
[1:19:24] this Beast is and he crawled up on the
[1:19:27] highway and as soon as I got sight of
[1:19:29] him I knew it was a Mumba now Mumba is
[1:19:34] an African snake which is the most
[1:19:37] deadly bite of all things there is
[1:19:41] there's nothing as poison as a
[1:19:43] Mumba and the snake of course represents
[1:19:46] s
[1:19:47] death and uh there is the the we have in
[1:19:50] this country the rattlesnake and the
[1:19:53] copper head and the cotton mouth
[1:19:55] moccasin many of those snakes that if
[1:19:57] you're in bad health and want to bite
[1:19:59] you it would perhaps kill you but if you
[1:20:02] didn't get a of some sort right
[1:20:04] away and then uh then we go into Africa
[1:20:07] and India and we find the cobber there's
[1:20:10] a black cobra he's a bad snake he's a
[1:20:14] death bite too and there's the yellow
[1:20:15] Cobra Which is far beyond him and the
[1:20:18] Yow Cobra uh the patient dies with such
[1:20:22] a horrible death it dies from
[1:20:23] suffocation
[1:20:25] it it paralyzes the breathing system and
[1:20:27] they they can't breathe and just open
[1:20:29] their mouth and gapping trying to and
[1:20:32] die like that and that was the Tye of
[1:20:34] snake was just one lick from getting
[1:20:36] Billy Paul when we got the snake in
[1:20:40] Africa and then then comes the Muma he's
[1:20:43] dead just when he he's so fast you can't
[1:20:46] see him he goes over the top of the
[1:20:48] weeds and propels himself with the back
[1:20:50] of his tail just and he's gone hitching
[1:20:54] the face usually stands up high and
[1:20:56] Strikes hard and when he hits you you've
[1:20:58] just got a few breaths till you're
[1:21:00] finished turn re it don't only paralyze
[1:21:02] to get the bloodstream it gets nerves
[1:21:04] everything you just die just in a few
[1:21:07] seconds them native boys and track boys
[1:21:09] you can say mum they'll butt their heads
[1:21:11] together and scream cause it it's death
[1:21:13] just in a few seconds see when one hits
[1:21:15] you and here he was on the
[1:21:18] highway I thought well this is it so I
[1:21:22] looked at him and he looked angry at me
[1:21:24] and he licked his tongue and here he
[1:21:26] come but when he got right close to me
[1:21:29] he'd run up fast and then he'd get
[1:21:31] slower and slower and just quiver and
[1:21:32] stop and then something hold him off he
[1:21:34] couldn't bite me and he turn around on
[1:21:36] the other side and try to approach from
[1:21:38] this side and he' get back get a start
[1:21:40] his whst right towards me gets slower
[1:21:42] and slower and slower and then to a stop
[1:21:44] then just shake like that and move back
[1:21:47] he couldn't
[1:21:48] strike then he turned and looked at my
[1:21:50] friend and away he went after my friend
[1:21:53] and I seen my friend just jumping way in
[1:21:55] the air over him and over him and over
[1:21:57] him trying and thing was striking at him
[1:21:59] I thought oh if it ever hits him it'll
[1:22:01] be instant death no wonder everybody's
[1:22:03] so scared because when this thing hits
[1:22:05] you it's an instant death and and it was
[1:22:09] just striking like that I threw my hands
[1:22:11] up I said oh God have mercy on my
[1:22:14] brother I said if that serpent ever
[1:22:16] strikes him it'll kill him and just then
[1:22:20] the serpent turned to me when I said
[1:22:22] that and look at me again and a voice
[1:22:26] came from above me and said you have
[1:22:29] been given
[1:22:30] power to
[1:22:32] binding the worst or
[1:22:35] any and I said well God what must I do
[1:22:39] he said there's one thing you must do
[1:22:41] you must be more
[1:22:44] sincere you must be more sincere I said
[1:22:47] well God forgive me for my insincerity
[1:22:50] and let me have sincerity and when I
[1:22:52] raised up my hands to him again and
[1:22:54] there was a great something came over me
[1:22:58] just lifted me up seemed like it my
[1:23:01] whole body was charge with something and
[1:23:04] uh I looked at the serpent and then he
[1:23:06] started towards me and he couldn't do it
[1:23:08] yet I said Satan in the name of the Lord
[1:23:12] Jesus Christ I bind you and the serpent
[1:23:17] of blue smoke flew out of him and he
[1:23:20] curled up and made that sign like a s
[1:23:23] capital s made backwards an an sign an
[1:23:27] means bind this one or anything below
[1:23:30] him because he was the worst blue smoke
[1:23:32] fell out of him and his tail choked his
[1:23:35] own self to death around his head when
[1:23:37] he made this backwards s that and sign
[1:23:40] like a conjunction you see choked it to
[1:23:42] death and the brother was free and I
[1:23:45] went over and mashed on it I said now
[1:23:47] I've got to find out about this because
[1:23:49] it's vision and I hit on the on the
[1:23:52] thing and it turned like that looked
[1:23:53] like a handle on a a glass handle on a
[1:23:55] pitcher just made it solid Crystal now I
[1:23:59] said think of that how quick that blue
[1:24:01] smoke was life and everything it left it
[1:24:03] all the elements and it's turned to
[1:24:05] Glass and just then a voice came again
[1:24:08] and said you can unbind him also so I
[1:24:12] said then Satan that I might know I
[1:24:15] unbind you and when he did he started
[1:24:18] coming to life again wiggling and I said
[1:24:21] I bind you back in the name of Jesus
[1:24:24] Christ CHR and when it did the smoke
[1:24:26] flew out of him again and he choked
[1:24:28] himself right back again and turned to
[1:24:30] Crystal and then when he did that that
[1:24:33] boy said now you must be more sincere
[1:24:37] than what you are to do this Oh Glory
[1:24:41] then it left me and I was standing in
[1:24:43] the room Hallelujah a few moments I
[1:24:46] heard a clock go off and my wife had got
[1:24:48] getting up the children you know how it
[1:24:51] is I guess it's your house one what am I
[1:24:52] go to where day Mama books and what did
[1:24:55] I do you know you just like any home you
[1:24:58] can't hear yourself thank Hardy for all
[1:25:01] of them trying to get ready at once and
[1:25:03] and so I slipped off into the den room
[1:25:06] and I got out on my knees and I said
[1:25:08] Lord
[1:25:09] Jesus I don't know these things and what
[1:25:14] must I do and the children be calling me
[1:25:16] take them to school in a few moments
[1:25:18] what must I do and I looked around in my
[1:25:21] Bible was laying there and I said Lord
[1:25:25] if you will forgive me I do not believe
[1:25:28] in just opening up the scripture and
[1:25:30] taking something out of the Bible and
[1:25:31] saying that but there is times that when
[1:25:35] God can comfort you by such a thing and
[1:25:38] I said Lord in this case of emergency
[1:25:41] right now before your spirit leaves me
[1:25:44] and I I don't know what to do the kids
[1:25:46] will be an hour yet before they' be gone
[1:25:48] would you just show me if that was
[1:25:50] something you're trying to get to me
[1:25:52] Heavenly Father then
[1:25:55] let me know and I took this Bible and
[1:25:58] just pull it open like that and my thumb
[1:26:00] was laying at First Corinthians the 5th
[1:26:03] chapter the eth verse when something
[1:26:06] reads something like this when you come
[1:26:08] I was planning on taking a fast to the
[1:26:11] Lord I told him I'd go out and fast said
[1:26:14] when you come to this Feast which a fast
[1:26:18] in the body is a feast with the Lord we
[1:26:20] know that so when you come to this Feast
[1:26:23] don't come come with the old 11 or the
[1:26:26] 11 of malice and so forth but come with
[1:26:30] the the unel bread of
[1:26:35] sincerity and Truth just exactly what he
[1:26:38] had told me in the vision come God is my
[1:26:40] solemn judge come with the unleavened
[1:26:43] bread of sincerity and truth that is the
[1:26:46] word then I see what as
[1:26:54] say Amen to that praise the Lord so now
[1:26:58] we'll take this last one here on this
[1:27:02] Great White Horse a dream given to
[1:27:05] brother Walker and he approaches brother
[1:27:09] brandham um paragraph 257 or whatever
[1:27:14] note I gave you there sis the starting
[1:27:16] place there 257 through 280
[1:27:21] amen he said Mr brandom
[1:27:24] I realized I got to stand before
[1:27:27] God he said I don't know where I sleep
[1:27:29] or what happened he said I dreamed I'm
[1:27:32] going to say as asleep and I dream said
[1:27:34] I thought my son in a market stuck his
[1:27:36] hand in a a sack and said when it is a

[1:35:12] and de while I went and set the table I
[1:35:14] had to look up there at the head of the
[1:35:15] table so I can just see that much of you
[1:35:18] Snow White that you stand there and said
[1:35:21] you spoke with authority was guess into
[1:35:24] it that every man understood exactly
[1:35:27] what she was saying oh my brother sister
[1:35:30] now every one of you conscious I know
[1:35:31] what that
[1:35:33] means just watch stay close to Christ
[1:35:37] let me warn you now as a minister the
[1:35:39] gospel of this don't take any
[1:35:45] foolishness don't imagine anything stay
[1:35:49] right there until this inside of the
[1:35:52] inside
[1:35:54] is anchored to the word that you're
[1:35:56] writing Christ because that's the only
[1:35:58] thing that's going to because we're in
[1:36:00] the most deceiving age that we ever
[1:36:03] lived in it would deceive the very
[1:36:06] elected if it was possible because they
[1:36:09] have anointing they can do anything like
[1:36:11] the rest of them clean your lives up pay
[1:36:14] your debts oh no man Jesus said not I I
[1:36:17] mean like your house Ren stuff you got
[1:36:18] to do it get all your things off your
[1:36:20] hands get everything right make ready
[1:36:24] get ready remember in the name of the
[1:36:26] Lord something's fixing to
[1:36:36] happen amen praise the Lord that's the
[1:36:40] good
[1:36:40] news that's the word of the Lord that's
[1:36:43] what we're looking to amen God bless you
[1:36:46] richly how many enjoy the word of the
[1:36:47] Lord these are there to remind us to
[1:36:51] this is where was that was August
[1:36:54] 65 it's August after the seals after
[1:36:57] those great tremendous messages that he
[1:37:00] preached he he say well he was talking
[1:37:02] about bringing his this is after all of
[1:37:04] that the Lord called him home just a few
[1:37:06] months later so how am I supposed to
[1:37:10] interpret
[1:37:11] that okay so we say what he said and he
[1:37:14] said to clean your lives up and don't
[1:37:17] imagine nothing and don't go for no
[1:37:19] foolishness if it ain't on the word then
[1:37:22] leave it alone
[1:37:24] and it's just I'm crazy to believe it
[1:37:26] just like he said it amen it's nothing
[1:37:29] but the truth God bless you so much amen
[1:37:32] we love him if the musicians will come
[1:37:36] amen and that's putting on the whole
[1:37:38] armor of God that's taking everything
[1:37:41] all the word and there's so much more
[1:37:44] that's just a fraction Saints that's
[1:37:47] just a little bitty bit and if you take
[1:37:50] that whole message that he preached from
[1:37:52] the beginning and let him develop it and
[1:37:54] bring it all the way through there's so
[1:37:56] much in there to take amen and it's for
[1:38:00] our preparation for the Rapture let us
[1:38:04] pray one more time lord Jesus thank you
[1:38:07] for these words Lord it
[1:38:10] just touches my heart every time I hear
[1:38:14] it the seriousness the Simplicity of it
[1:38:19] oh God just to clean my life up my heart
