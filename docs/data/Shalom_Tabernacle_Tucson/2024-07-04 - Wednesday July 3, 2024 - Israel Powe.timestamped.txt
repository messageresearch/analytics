[26:58] stand to our feet and we'll go right
[27:00] into the word have a few notes that I'll
[27:03] read and then
[27:06] um uh finish up a portion of the tape
[27:09] the queen of the south in Matthew
[27:12] chapter
[27:13] 12 um brother bam takes this scripture
[27:18] as he deals with this queen of the
[27:24] South referred to as the Queen of Sheba
[27:27] Matthew chapter 12 12 verse
[27:30] number
[27:35] 38-42 when you have that you can say
[27:39] Amen then certain of the scribes and of
[27:42] the Pharisees answered saying Master we
[27:44] would see a sign from thee but he
[27:47] answered and said unto them a evil and
[27:50] adulterous generation seeketh after a
[27:52] sign and there shall no sign be given to
[27:55] it but the sign of the prophet Jonas for
[27:59] as Jonas was three days and three nights
[28:02] in the Well's belly so shall the son of
[28:05] man be three days and three nights in
[28:09] the heart of the earth and that the men
[28:12] of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with
[28:15] this generation shall condemn it because
[28:18] they repented at the preaching of Jonas
[28:20] and behold a greater than Jonas is here
[28:24] the queen of the South shall rise up in
[28:27] the judgment with this generation and
[28:30] shall condemn it for she came from the
[28:33] uttermost parts of the earth to hear the
[28:36] wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater
[28:40] than Solomon is here amen one more
[28:42] scripture in Matthew chapter
[28:45] 6 of course I just was meditating on the
[28:49] scripture and then Levi uh plac this
[28:52] last song that brought me out seek ye
[28:55] first the kingdom of God Matthew chapter
[28:57] 6
[29:00] verse 33
[29:03] says but seek ye first the kingdom of
[29:07] God and his righteousness and all these
[29:10] things shall be added unto you take
[29:13] therefore no thought for the tomorrow
[29:16] for the tomorrow shall take thought for
[29:18] the things of itself sufficient unto the
[29:22] day is the evil thereof God bless you
[29:25] may God add a blessing to the reading of
[29:27] his word you may be seated just thinking
[29:29] on some of the thoughts from this past
[29:33] week and as we were um thinking how you
[29:38] know the the the Lord would always puts
[29:43] us in a position where he would make us
[29:46] motivated he won't Force us to do things
[29:49] but he'll sure make us willing we have
[29:52] to make the decision ourself but there
[29:55] are times that we put too much pressure
[29:58] on ourself that maybe the Lord didn't
[30:00] put on us and sometimes we we feel so
[30:05] inadequate or in effective am I a true
[30:09] witness I haven't LED anyone to the Lord
[30:14] and we think these thoughts and I think
[30:16] those thoughts come from hearts that
[30:18] really want to do something that's right
[30:22] and so if you didn't care you wouldn't
[30:24] think those thoughts I guess and so we
[30:27] all want to be greater witness we all
[30:30] want to see the Lord manifested in our
[30:32] lives and this scripture here in Matthew
[30:35] chapter six kind of deals with take no
[30:39] thought if you take that just that
[30:41] phrase there he says it is several times
[30:45] our lord Jesus does and he says take no
[30:48] thought for the for your life what you
[30:52] shall eat what you shall drink nor for
[30:56] your body what you shall put on is not
[31:00] the life more than meat and the body
[31:02] than rment verse 26 he says behold the
[31:05] fouls of the air for they sow not
[31:09] neither do they reap nor gather into
[31:12] barns yet your heavenly father Feth them
[31:16] are you not much better than they of
[31:19] course the little birds in my
[31:21] neighborhood they don't have to worry
[31:23] about eating because we feed them and
[31:27] many of you you feed the little animals
[31:29] and the birds and those little birds
[31:31] they're not stressing about the things
[31:34] that maybe we would stress about where
[31:36] is their food coming from and Jesus is
[31:39] putting us in that time that that
[31:42] mindset he says the little birds of the
[31:44] air the fowls they're not worried about
[31:47] these things for the father takes care
[31:50] of them he covers them he's got them
[31:53] covered and he's telling and our lord
[31:55] Jesus has said don't take no thought on
[31:57] on those things that how are you going
[31:59] to eat what we're going to do you know
[32:01] sometimes we cross the bridge before we
[32:04] get there we're so stressed out about
[32:07] next week and we might not even be in
[32:10] next week the Lord may call us home and
[32:12] we fail to enjoy the moment of his
[32:16] blessing us today you know the things
[32:19] for tomorrow are going to take care of
[32:21] themselves it's going to happen either
[32:24] you're going to get it done or you're
[32:25] not and sometimes we have our list and
[32:28] our of accomplishments and goals and I
[32:30] like something that brother uh Trevor
[32:32] said at the Bible study there at the
[32:35] youth Bible study he was bringing in how
[32:37] the Lord delivered him and dealt with
[32:39] him on a social media and how he got rid
[32:43] of that and and he was bringing up some
[32:46] of the examples and statistics was very
[32:48] very good and informative and how
[32:51] sometimes we compare ourselves to one
[32:53] another and so we look on there and we
[32:55] say well he's 40 or he's 30 or he's 25
[33:00] and look at all that he has at the age
[33:02] of 25 he retired at 30 and here you are
[33:07] and you're in your 50s still going to
[33:09] work and are you a bum or
[33:12] what you know but that's not none of
[33:15] your business that's not none of your
[33:17] business who retired or who has what you
[33:21] shouldn't put that pressure on yourself
[33:23] because the father called you for a
[33:26] purpose sometimes we want to preach like
[33:28] this or sing like that want to have what
[33:31] this one has but we're not we shouldn't
[33:33] do that that's not wise to compare
[33:35] ourselves that way and it's just undo
[33:38] pressure it's pressure that God didn't
[33:40] design for us to have and I think that
[33:44] um Jesus just brings that out very very
[33:47] nicely in the scripture I hope you have
[33:48] your Bible there just for a moment in
[33:50] Matthew chapter 6 let's just walk
[33:52] through the scripture just for a moment
[33:54] and then we'll go to this last part of
[33:56] the tap verse
[33:59] 27 says 26 behold the fowls of the air
[34:03] they sow not neither do they reap nor
[34:06] gather into barns yet your heavenly
[34:08] father Feth them are you not much better
[34:13] than they which of You by taking thought
[34:17] can add one cubit unto his stature and
[34:21] why take ye thought for rment consider
[34:25] the lies of the field first he tells us
[34:28] the birds and now he's telling us the
[34:30] plant life how they grow they toil not
[34:34] neither do they spin and yet I say unto
[34:37] you that even Solomon in all of his
[34:40] glory was not AR raay like one of
[34:43] these wherefore if God so clothe the
[34:47] grass of the field which today is and
[34:50] tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he
[34:53] not much more clothe you oh ye of little
[34:59] faith you know let's stop right there in
[35:02] verse number 30 as we as we look at the
[35:06] the vegetation and the plant life how
[35:08] the Lord will do the Landscaping on on
[35:11] Mount Lemon there and even on all of our
[35:15] hillsides and how beautiful it is and
[35:18] the rain just sets it off and you'll see
[35:21] the flowers blooming and you wonder well
[35:23] who's taking care of all of those plants
[35:26] who's watering them who's making sure
[35:29] they have enough water but God does he
[35:32] takes care of that and it's without
[35:35] stress I mean the ones that are going to
[35:38] die are going to die and the ones that
[35:39] are going to survive are going to
[35:41] survive and that's just the way it is we
[35:43] went up to Mount Lemon here the other
[35:45] day and just looking at the beautiful
[35:47] landscape how it's put together you know
[35:50] we have some of those same plants maybe
[35:53] in our own yards and we want to care for
[35:56] them and stress and worry about them but
[36:00] the Lord has that all under his control
[36:04] and that's not really our burden I mean
[36:07] I think that um I think in this hour in
[36:10] this age if the enemy can throw you you
[36:14] know he can't get you on this side he'll
[36:15] get you on this other side and so we
[36:18] know we love the Lord we know we want to
[36:21] be true believers and true Christians
[36:23] and then now the enemy wants to get into
[36:25] that and start making this about some
[36:27] kind of a
[36:28] performance like he's grading you or
[36:31] judging you based on your
[36:34] performance but really it's a
[36:37] relationship between our heavenly father
[36:40] he knows what we have need of before we
[36:43] even ask him let me ask you who wants
[36:47] your family saved more than God
[36:50] himself the God put the desire he gave
[36:53] you your family and then like and then
[36:56] now that they're their Wayward or they
[36:58] go the way that they go and then we want
[37:00] to see them saved right how many want to
[37:03] see your loved one saved and then we
[37:05] want to see them saved so bad that we'll
[37:07] get involved and we'll start arguing and
[37:10] stressing the matter and start trying to
[37:12] judge them and send them this quote and
[37:15] make sure they're in church or condemn
[37:18] them when they doing the reason why you
[37:21] want to see them Sav is because God did
[37:23] something for you and if he if he saved
[37:27] you you don't you think he knew who your
[37:29] family would be and don't you think he
[37:32] would know that you would want your
[37:34] family saved too so the stress is on
[37:37] who's creating all of this stress for
[37:39] your family to be saved God got it all
[37:43] under control
[37:46] amen and he works in ways that maybe we
[37:49] don't see he works secretly he works on
[37:53] a man's heart works on a woman's heart
[37:57] and we're looking at the outward we
[37:59] don't see any physical signs and our
[38:02] work is that we're not a good witness
[38:04] nobody's looking at us oh stop God knows
[38:08] exactly what he's doing he puts you in
[38:10] your neighborhood he puts you on the job
[38:13] he even put you in your family and your
[38:15] entire family they're watching you the
[38:18] job is watching you the neighborhood is
[38:20] watching you and that's the best witness
[38:22] that we can be be exactly where God
[38:25] called us to be let off the pressure
[38:28] relax stop trying to figure it all out
[38:31] and just serve the Lord with all your
[38:34] heart paragraph verse 31 says therefore
[38:39] take no thought saying what you shall
[38:41] eat or what you shall Drink wherewith
[38:45] All Shall we be clothed for after all
[38:48] these things do the Gentiles seek for
[38:50] your heavenly father knowe it that you
[38:53] have need of all these things but seek
[38:57] ye first the kingdom of God and his
[39:02] righteousness and all these things shall
[39:04] be added unto you let's read that verse
[39:07] together verse 33 but seek ye first the
[39:11] kingdom of God and his
[39:15] righteousness and all these things shall
[39:18] be added unto
[39:20] you take no thought take therefore no
[39:24] thought for tomorrow
[39:28] for the moral shall take thought for the
[39:32] things of
[39:33] itself sufficient unto the day is the
[39:37] evil thereof so that's what we want to
[39:40] do we want to put the things that God
[39:44] has given us put it in his hands trust
[39:48] him believe him and be happy have a
[39:52] smile on your
[39:54] face take off the pressure you're a
[39:56] Christian you're on your way to heaven
[39:58] when you die thank the Lord I I can't
[40:02] think of a better deal than that when
[40:04] it's all over we get to go to heaven
[40:08] anyways so if your candidate do didn't
[40:11] do too well in the presidential thing
[40:15] stop stressing don't worry about it if
[40:18] your crew with your job whatever they
[40:20] didn't promote you they didn't recognize
[40:23] you nobody respects you Let It Go just
[40:26] Let It Go we get to go to heaven when we
[40:28] die anyways and the heavenly father
[40:31] knows what we have need of before we
[40:34] even ask take no thought so brother
[40:38] random takes this message the queen of
[40:40] the South and we listen to paragraph up
[40:43] to paragraph I think 31 or 32 and I want
[40:47] to finish up that message he um pretty
[40:49] much got through the preaching part of
[40:52] it and and now he's going into the
[40:55] prayer line and so I wanted to finish
[40:57] that up and I know if there's an
[40:59] anointing there and I believe it'll be a
[41:01] blessing to all of you and another thing
[41:04] I'd like to say I don't want you to
[41:07] because we play part of a tape or we'll
[41:09] might play half of the tape or we'll
[41:11] break it up like on the seals will start
[41:13] it right at a certain part that's not
[41:16] taken away
[41:18] from uh we certainly don't want you to
[41:21] think that we're taking away from
[41:23] listening to the entire message it is
[41:26] important I another thing also the other
[41:29] Bible translations I read from them for
[41:32] commentary for my own personal study
[41:35] brother random used the King James
[41:37] version that's what I like to use that's
[41:39] where we stand and um as you study that
[41:44] a little bit more you'll see there's
[41:45] some some newer translations that
[41:49] they're they're changing with the times
[41:52] and so you just you know you don't have
[41:53] to deal with that when you just stick
[41:55] with the King James version read what
[41:57] read whatever version you want to read
[41:59] but when you just bring it back to what
[42:01] the prophet left for us and that that
[42:04] settles all of that amen the Christian
[42:07] world are trying to find out the ESV or
[42:09] the NIV or the nsav or the living Bible
[42:13] um New King James all of those versions
[42:16] versions of the Bible great correct it's
[42:19] a language it's good for study it's good
[42:22] for looking what did God use what stood
[42:24] the test of time what is um has been
[42:29] Vindicated and uh that's his King James
[42:32] version so I certainly hopefully trust
[42:35] that that will we we uh establish that
[42:38] here all right all right so God bless
[42:41] you let us go to the tape you can remain
[42:44] seated and brother randam paragraph 31
[42:48] God bless
[42:49] you got two little girls sitting back
[42:52] there Rebecca and Sarah they're both D's
[42:57] little
[42:58] girls when I go out they're always
[43:01] waiting for me to come
[43:04] back they love Daddy you know how Daddy
[43:08] loves
[43:09] them there's a little
[43:12] Parable one morning I'd come in early
[43:15] and the kitties had waited long and
[43:19] I was late so they had to go to bed
[43:22] their mother put them to
[43:24] bed and I couldn't rest that morning so
[43:27] so I got up early sitting out in the
[43:29] living room in a chair I had meetings
[43:32] and I was so worn out I just couldn't
[43:37] sleep and I got up early sitting in the
[43:40] chair after a while I heard a scramble
[43:43] in the children's
[43:44] bedroom Becky had woke up and she Wonder
[43:48] her daddy if he' got in here she come
[43:50] through the house just as hard as she
[43:52] can behind her come her little sister
[43:55] about so tall now Becky was big she's
[43:59] about 13 long legged and skinny Sarah's
[44:02] a little chumpy fell her pajama feet
[44:05] about twice the size they ought to be
[44:08] she was falling over most everything in
[44:10] the house and Becky come and jumped out
[44:14] a straddle on my leg and her big long
[44:16] legs hung down to the floor she could
[44:18] balance herself pretty well I think
[44:21] about like like the churches sometime
[44:24] they're older than this move of God
[44:27] the
[44:30] Pentecostal and they may have both feet
[44:33] on the
[44:34] ground that's all right we appreciate
[44:38] that and she put her arms around me and
[44:41] hugged me real tight she said my daddy
[44:45] and when she heard Sarah her little
[44:47] sister coming she turned to looked at
[44:49] Sarah she said Sarah Sarah remind me of
[44:53] this little church that just started you
[44:55] know it isn't very old sometimes it gets
[44:57] up in the air and down on the ground and
[44:59] flopping
[45:00] around in and out she said Sarah I want
[45:05] you to know one thing I was here
[45:11] first and I've got all of
[45:14] Daddy and there's nothing left for
[45:18] you little Sarah dropped her little lips
[45:20] down her little brown eyes kind of
[45:22] watered she turned to go away I winked
[45:25] at her and motioned my finger stop my
[45:27] other leg out here she come all smiles
[45:31] and jumped up on that leg she couldn't
[45:33] hold herself she couldn't touch the
[45:35] ground you know they get little upside
[45:38] Topsy Turvy sometime when they get drunk
[45:40] on the spirits you know but as long as
[45:43] are
[45:44] there so I just tuck both arms I had to
[45:47] to hold her on my leg she was too sharp
[45:50] she hadn't grow
[45:52] enough I hugged her up close to me and
[45:55] she roll that little head around them
[45:56] little black eyes stuck out and looked
[45:58] at Becky she said Rebecca my
[46:01] sister I want to tell you something
[46:05] too you said it may be true that you got
[46:08] your first and it may be true that
[46:11] you've got all a daddy but I want you to
[46:13] know one thing Daddy's got all of me
[46:17] so that's the way I feel about this
[46:20] religion I don't know all the ins and
[46:22] outs maybe the Bible I know the the
[46:25] author of The Bible real well and just
[46:27] as long as he's got all of me that's all
[46:29] I care for if I'm so completely
[46:32] surrendered to him and to his will that
[46:35] he can work his works let the world say
[46:39] what they want
[46:40] to and she'll rise in the day of the
[46:43] judgment and condemn this generation for
[46:46] she came from the utmost parts of the
[46:48] world to hear the wisdom of Solomon a
[46:52] gift and yet I say Toto you that are
[46:54] greater than Solomon is here let us
[47:00] pray precious
[47:02] Lord we are now standing at a
[47:08] Crossroads we've been brought to a place
[47:12] to whether it is we must accept it are
[47:17] discarded we can not go out this doors
[47:21] of this place tonight as we were when we
[47:24] come in we either go out better or
[47:29] worse Lord grant that every man and
[47:31] woman in here will go out filled with
[47:34] the Holy Spirit go back to their home
[47:37] church and be a real Christian in
[47:41] it granted Lord and now as brother
[47:47] dupes has been speaking and we have told
[47:50] of the great Messiah gift the last sign
[47:53] to the
[47:54] church that was to appear just before
[47:56] for the
[47:58] Judgment I pray God that you'll make
[48:01] yourself known to this church tonight
[48:04] that you are not dead but you are
[48:08] alive and the god that they
[48:11] worship the Jesus that they love is
[48:15] walking side by side with them and those
[48:17] the very thoughts of their
[48:20] heart and when we shall close the
[48:22] service tonight may all unbelievers are
[48:26] so forth come forward and give their
[48:28] hearts to thee and as we go on our roads
[48:31] home may we say like those who came from
[48:34] Aus on that first resurrection
[48:38] morning after Jesus had gotten them
[48:41] together and closed the door he did
[48:44] something just the way he did it before
[48:46] his crucifixion they knew that no man
[48:49] did it that way but him and they
[48:54] understood and their eyes opened
[48:57] and he vanished out of their sight and
[49:01] they said as they hurried back to tell
[49:02] the others did not our hearts burn
[49:05] within us as he talked to us along the
[49:08] way once more
[49:11] Lord and this great church of angelist
[49:16] Temple I pray God that you will once
[49:20] more tonight come into our midst so real
[49:25] and so tangible
[49:27] that every person in here may see you do
[49:29] the works that you did before your
[49:32] crucifixion they might know that their
[49:34] God Lives heal the sick save the lost
[49:38] and may we all commit ourselves to thy
[49:41] spirit that we might be instruments that
[49:43] he might work through us we ask it in
[49:46] Jesus name
[49:50] amen
[49:53] hallu Jesus said in one case if I not
[49:57] the works of my father who sent me don't
[49:59] believe me
[50:02] now I want you to know clearly that I am
[50:05] not a Divine healer and I don't believe
[50:07] there's one in the
[50:09] world I believe that Divine Healing is
[50:12] on the same basis of Salvation Jesus
[50:15] Christ paid the price of sin at Calvary
[50:20] and you cannot touch sin unless you
[50:23] touch sickness because sickness is an
[50:26] attribute of sin maybe not what you done
[50:29] but what somebody done before you
[50:31] because we never had no sickness until
[50:34] we had sin When sin came sickness
[50:37] followed it that's
[50:40] true how can you preach the gospel of
[50:43] Salvation and then deny Divine Healing
[50:46] has been more than I ever could
[50:49] understand Jesus died at Calvary every
[50:51] sin was settled the only thing you do
[50:54] now is look and live believe it he was
[50:57] wounded for our transgressions with his
[50:58] stripes you were healed if I had power
[51:01] to heal anybody I certainly would do
[51:04] it I sure would I know what it means to
[51:08] be sick I have no power to heal no other
[51:11] man does if he does then what happened
[51:13] to
[51:14] Calvary God cannot do anything twice by
[51:18] his stripes you were healed only if he
[51:21] stood here tonight with this suit that
[51:22] he gave me he could do not one thing
[51:26] towards your healing unless you believed
[51:28] it he proved in the scripture many
[51:30] mighty Works he could not do because of
[51:32] their unbelief it's the same tonight
[51:34] he's same yesterday today and forever
[51:37] but those who believe could now the main
[51:40] thing is
[51:42] this if we can he will come in our midst
[51:46] and prove that he's in our midst then
[51:49] that gives every person an opportunity
[51:52] to look and live I believe I heard
[51:55] brother SAR in a few moment
[51:57] ago as I come up speaking about the
[52:00] Caribbean islands where we just left
[52:03] that judge that morning was standing
[52:05] there talking and Sally Olson was
[52:07] interpreting giving me the
[52:09] message so
[52:12] astonished said it was when this brother
[52:16] brandom leaves God don't leave the
[52:18] island said he put all the emphasis on
[52:21] God and when the meeting was over they
[52:24] took carloads of little old carts and
[52:28] wheels that they drove together to bring
[52:31] their loved ones on crutches and clubs
[52:34] laying covered all over the fields where
[52:36] they just got up and left
[52:38] them and here we set here tonight in
[52:43] America we ought to be ashamed of
[52:46] ourselves if we have the trouble I I
[52:50] feel more sorry for America than
[52:52] anywhere else because they don't know
[52:55] which way to turn
[52:57] this one's saying this and this one's
[52:58] saying that Jesus said let every man's
[53:00] word be lie and mine be the truth he is
[53:04] living he died he rose again he's alive
[53:07] forever more he's the same yesterday
[53:11] today and
[53:12] forever now we're late tomorrow night
[53:17] but this time we expect to be gone
[53:20] Sunday night I'm kind of
[53:21] ashamed I've got a the Lord has given me
[53:24] rather a way that I can operate my
[53:28] Ministry a little different than what I
[53:30] used to that is that the Visions just
[53:33] come and then I let it go till I strike
[53:36] another that really needs it and then
[53:38] let it go to that one then go on to see
[53:40] someone really in need or some sin
[53:43] hanging on the person then I stop that
[53:46] one but I don't believe my Ministry of
[53:48] the first type to take the line and
[53:51] search it by the Holy Spirit has ever
[53:53] been done here so B it won't won't take
[53:56] very long for that let's have it that
[53:59] way tonight and then tomorrow night I'll
[54:02] start my new ministry that the Lord Give
[54:05] Me Now last evening before we had had
[54:09] anybody here so anyone would see that
[54:12] the prayer card GNA have nothing to do
[54:15] with the healing of the person the great
[54:17] Holy Spirit come down and went over this
[54:19] building telling talking to the people
[54:22] tell them just what it was and healing
[54:24] the people how many was sure to witness
[54:26] it raise your hands as before anything
[54:28] ever happened how many is here that's
[54:31] never been in one of my meetings before
[54:32] raise your
[54:34] hands or half the
[54:37] congregation now I claim that Jesus that
[54:41] the coming of the Lord is near the last
[54:44] sign that's ever showed to any
[54:46] generation before the chaos as before
[54:49] the destructions happen the Messiah sign
[54:52] is given to that people it was given to
[54:56] AB Abraham before the destruction of
[54:58] Sodom it was given to the Jews before
[55:02] God turned from them it was given to the
[55:04] Samaritans before God turned from them
[55:08] and now there's one generation one
[55:09] people left from Ham sham and japas
[55:11] people that's the Gentiles we've had
[55:14] 2,000 years of theology we've had
[55:17] healings we've had Miracles all down
[55:19] through there but now we're at the end
[55:21] time the Messiah is drawing
[55:25] closer the hour is at hand I know
[55:28] that you've had so many Sensations and
[55:31] things so it seems like they don't catch
[55:33] it like the
[55:34] baby open up your understandings tonight
[55:37] before
[55:38] God let him move upon you if God can
[55:42] proved to be here the resurrection of
[55:45] Jesus Christ that he is in this building
[55:48] and he is with his people how much more
[55:51] would you want it ought to make you to
[55:53] throw your crutches down jump from your
[55:55] wheelchairs get out of here go on the
[55:56] street tomorrow saying did not our
[55:58] hearts burn within us as the Holy Spirit
[56:01] spoke to us
[56:03] tonight don't wait you keep Satan can
[56:06] make you put it off till tomorrow night
[56:08] that's just one night longer and that
[56:10] much harder to get to it believe it
[56:12] right now if you believe you shall
[56:15] receive and if the Lord Jesus will
[56:17] appear in our midst of these hundreds
[56:19] and hundreds of people sitting here
[56:21] tonight and will perform and do just
[56:24] like he did before he was
[56:27] crucified how many will say it'll settle
[56:29] it with me forever that Jesus Christ is
[56:32] alive and I I'll take him as my savior
[56:35] raise your hands will you thank
[56:39] you and radio audience I wish you could
[56:42] be here to see that this great massive
[56:44] of people sitting here with their hands
[56:46] up witnessing that they would accept the
[56:50] Lord Jesus maybe some of them are
[56:52] sinners some of them what is
[56:55] sin why a person can be just as loyal to
[56:58] church as they can be a member of the
[57:00] finest Church in Los Angeles and still
[57:02] be a sinner a preacher can stand behind
[57:05] the pull pit and preach a gospel message
[57:08] that would shake the whole audience and
[57:10] still be a
[57:11] sinner sin is
[57:14] unbelief you believe him not you're
[57:16] condemned already now I believe the boys
[57:20] told me there that they gave out a one
[57:23] bunch of prayer cards this afternoon we
[57:25] want to stay them up so it'll be
[57:27] Reverend everybody has a chance to get
[57:29] the prayer card get into the line now
[57:32] brother Duffield or any of the pastors
[57:34] here didn't give out those prayer cards
[57:36] it's these boys give them out they stand
[57:38] up here and mix them up before you and
[57:39] then come out give anybody a card that
[57:41] wants
[57:42] one therefore if you're from the temple
[57:44] or your pastor had nothing to do with or
[57:47] neither Brother Duffield or anyone here
[57:48] at the this church or any other Church
[57:51] you just give it out and you come as
[57:53] you're called it's not a push and a
[57:55] shove fuss and so forth this is a house
[57:58] of God it's not an arena I've seen him
[58:01] when you try to take six head Rose of
[58:04] man in India or nearly 500,000 together
[58:07] and they'd break through those lines and
[58:08] jump over one another run through the
[58:10] legs of the officers trying to get
[58:12] through well you couldn't you couldn't
[58:14] preach or pray for the sick like that
[58:16] there's too much confusion the holy
[58:18] spirit is timid everything must be
[58:21] decently and in order for the Holy
[58:24] Spirit
[58:26] I'm was that L prayer cards L was give
[58:29] out and we're going to start at number

[59:14] about what the Bible has told it's
[59:17] either got to be proven now to be the
[59:19] truth or it's wrong
[59:26] now Comes The Showdown is Christ
[59:30] alive if he is he'll make himself
[59:35] no to you Pentecostal people did not
[59:39] Jesus say or Paul I beg your pardon Paul
[59:43] said to the Corinthian Church if all
[59:45] speak with tongues and one come in
[59:47] unlearn you'll say you're you're mad but
[59:49] if one prophesies and reveals the secret
[59:52] of the heart then they'll fall down and
[59:54] say God is with you how many knows the
[59:56] Bible says that raise your hands sure
[59:59] see how could you say it with something
[1:00:01] else when when Paul and Jesus and the
[1:00:04] Holy Spirit just keeps going on with
[1:00:08] it now to you that's in the prayer line
[1:00:11] how many of you know that I do not know
[1:00:13] you or know nothing about you your calls
[1:00:15] raise your hands will you all right
[1:00:18] every one of
[1:00:19] them I don't see a person there that
[1:00:22] I've ever seen in my life now again so
[1:00:25] the audience visible audience can see it
[1:00:27] every one of you in the prayer line that
[1:00:29] knows that I do not know you or know
[1:00:31] what's wrong with you or know your
[1:00:32] desires or what you're here far raise up
[1:00:34] your hands

[1:00:42] do you out there I the only person I
[1:00:45] thought I seen brother Julius stats
[1:00:47] Cliff here somewhere I guess it was this
[1:00:49] afternoon he sitting along here
[1:00:51] somewhere
[1:00:53] now here is The Showdown now for the
[1:00:56] next few
[1:00:58] minutes now remember it's not me now
[1:01:02] just be seated keep your seats and be
[1:01:04] real quiet just for a
[1:01:09] moment now it's not

[1:01:15] people don't know me my hand is before
[1:01:17] God I I don't know one of
[1:01:22] them and they raised their hands that
[1:01:25] the
[1:01:26] same they don't know me I don't know
[1:01:29] them so something's got to take place if
[1:01:33] these scriptures are made
[1:01:35] true all
[1:01:37] right now this there's a woman coming
[1:01:41] here
[1:01:42] now I suppose that mic is alive there
[1:01:44] too is it you can stand right there Then
[1:01:48] lady now here we are meeting a man and a
[1:01:51] woman the first time in life to meet
[1:01:56] I do not know her never seen her I
[1:01:59] suppose this may be the first time we've
[1:02:01] ever come this close together let's
[1:02:03] annoing in her life if that's right
[1:02:04] raise up your hand that's right the
[1:02:06] first time was ever met all
[1:02:09] right but she's here for some
[1:02:13] cause now what can happen what can Jesus
[1:02:17] do with this when I've already said by
[1:02:20] if she's sick by his stripes she was
[1:02:23] healed but he's still the same Jesus
[1:02:26] yesterday today and forever one time in
[1:02:29] St John 4 this come together again a man
[1:02:31] and a
[1:02:33] woman Jesus met the woman at the of
[1:02:36] Samaria and she he asked her for a drink
[1:02:40] you know the story and Jesus kept
[1:02:42] talking to her till he found out what
[1:02:44] her trouble was how many knows what her
[1:02:46] trouble was she had five husbands living
[1:02:49] with the sixth one and when he told her
[1:02:54] that she said uh I perceive that you are
[1:02:57] a prophet we know when the Messiah
[1:03:00] cometh he'll tell us these things that
[1:03:02] was a sign of the
[1:03:04] Messiah if he's the same Messiah today
[1:03:08] he's gone away and the body of Flesh
[1:03:10] Jesus was crucified God raised it up and
[1:03:13] set it on his throne but the spirit that
[1:03:16] was in him has come back upon his
[1:03:19] church and it's a yielding to the Holy
[1:03:22] Spirit I don't know her she don't know
[1:03:25] me now
[1:03:26] if she believes all right she might be a
[1:03:28] Critic she might be a hypocrite she
[1:03:30] might be a Christian she might be sick
[1:03:32] she might need finances spiritual a I
[1:03:35] don't know nothing about
[1:03:36] her if she's a Critic watch what
[1:03:39] happened to her in the next few
[1:03:42] minutes you've been in meetings before
[1:03:44] you and seen what happened
[1:03:46] then now here's where the that's another
[1:03:50] anonas and Safa
[1:03:52] case but now I'll speak to her just like
[1:03:55] our L spoke to that woman till he found
[1:03:57] her trouble then if let her be the judge
[1:04:01] now if I walked up and said sister
[1:04:03] you're sick that might be right might be
[1:04:05] wrong and she said yes of course he know
[1:04:08] I was sick I'm in the prayer line well
[1:04:09] it could be she wasn't sick and laid my
[1:04:12] hands on her and said praise the Lord
[1:04:14] you're going to get well well she should
[1:04:16] believe that but what if the Holy Spirit
[1:04:18] comes here and goes back down her life
[1:04:20] and tell her what she has been now she
[1:04:23] knows whether that's the truth or not
[1:04:25] and if he knows what has been surely
[1:04:27] he'll know what will be you believe
[1:04:32] that I just want to talk to the woman
[1:04:35] just a
[1:04:36] moment being that this is our first time
[1:04:41] meeting and you're quite sure that
[1:04:45] there's something taking
[1:04:47] place because standing before a man
[1:04:50] wouldn't make you feel as you're feeling
[1:04:53] now did you ever see that picture of the
[1:04:56] Angel of the Lord that light over where
[1:04:58] I was standing is he taken pH in Phoenix
[1:05:01] Arizona you saw it all right that same
[1:05:04] light is between you and I
[1:05:07] now now if that is the same Pillar of
[1:05:10] Fire that led the children of
[1:05:12] Israel he come and was made flesh he
[1:05:15] said I came from God and I go back to
[1:05:17] God after his death bar and resurrection
[1:05:20] and Ascension he met Paul on the road to
[1:05:23] Damascus and what was he back again that
[1:05:26] Pillar of Fire put Paul's eyes out made
[1:05:30] him blind for a
[1:05:32] season and he said Saul Saul why
[1:05:34] persecuted s me he said who are you Lord
[1:05:37] he Saidi Jesus Pillar of
[1:05:40] Fire now if the life of the vine
[1:05:43] produces something here it's got to
[1:05:45] produce the same fruit here then if the
[1:05:47] holy spirit is in here it'll that same
[1:05:49] Pillar of Fire that's standing between
[1:05:51] you and I now you being a woman me a man
[1:05:54] and if it can reveal to me what you're
[1:05:56] here for then God's interested in taking
[1:05:59] care of your needs is that right and you
