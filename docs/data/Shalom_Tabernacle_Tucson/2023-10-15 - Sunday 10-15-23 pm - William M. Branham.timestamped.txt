[33:42] seated good evening friends I'm very
[33:46] grateful to be here tonight again just
[33:48] let you a while
[33:50] ago I think got out around 4:00 and then
[33:54] I had to we went out to see some more
[33:57] friends and got back 5 minutes after 7
[33:59] just had to come back down so I'm kind
[34:01] of Happ to hunt a text yet brother NE
[34:03] but now there is a request that just was
[34:07] called in from someone in Chattanooga
[34:10] Tennessee uh loved one that was in a wck
[34:13] three weeks ago and lying unconscious
[34:15] still and requests prayer here from the
[34:19] church and yes you sure can
[34:23] brother yes I just almost forgot I made
[34:27] a promise to make an announcement
[34:31] tonight we
[34:33] were we were speaking of Mel chesd who
[34:39] he was and we nothing like got through
[34:42] with it but maybe the next time coming
[34:44] in we can pick up from there still in
[34:47] the book of Hebrews but tonight we turn
[34:49] over to the Book of Daniel and you with
[34:52] your Bibles turn to Daniel
[34:55] 12 and we're going to read a little from
[34:58] there and talk maybe on some of God's
[35:02] word out of the Book of Daniel now
[35:06] Daniel was one of the was the prophet
[35:09] that was carried from Jerusalem down
[35:12] into Babylon and the carrying away of
[35:14] Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar he was a
[35:17] young fellow when he went out into
[35:18] Babylon there was uh not um many of them
[35:23] that had still holding out the grand old
[35:26] faith I Daniel because his he had
[35:29] purposed that in his heart when he went
[35:32] down into Babylon that he was going to
[35:35] remain a Believer and he wasn't going to
[35:38] file himself with the king's meats and
[35:40] so forth now the very thing in Daniel
[35:44] was the prophet to the Gentiles Daniel
[35:48] saw all the Gentile age rise and fall he
[35:53] was the first one to be we called the
[35:56] Gentile prophet
[35:57] he wasn't a gentile himself but he saw
[36:00] the Gentile dispensation from start to
[36:03] finish in the head of gold and ending up
[36:05] in the feet of iron and clay and while
[36:09] down in there purposing in his heart
[36:11] that he wouldn't defile himself with the
[36:13] king's meats and with the king's
[36:17] Affair and another group of Brethren
[36:20] named Shadrach mishak and abedo was down
[36:23] there with them which was not prophets
[36:25] but believers and they also purposed in
[36:28] their heart and then when those four
[36:32] Believers come together I'll imagine
[36:34] quite oftenly they had prayer meetings
[36:36] together just like we do we get together
[36:40] because we have things in common you
[36:43] know there's an old slogan that says
[36:45] birds of a feather flock together and
[36:48] that's an old proverb rather and that's
[36:50] a pretty good thing too birds of a
[36:53] feather flock together aren't you happy
[36:55] for that birds of a feather flocked
[36:59] together not long ago I was sitting in a
[37:01] meeting where there was a man discussing
[37:04] something and he said well it's talking
[37:07] about the souls that went to prison was
[37:10] in prison that Jesus went and preach to
[37:13] after his death and this man that was
[37:17] speaking said well what do you think
[37:20] about him and a colored brother raised
[37:22] up he said well that's just what the
[37:24] Bible said he went and preached the
[37:27] souls that were in prison so what do you
[37:29] think it was said it was Souls that
[37:30] didn't repent and the longsuffering in
[37:33] the days of Noah while the ark was being
[37:34] prepared just like the Bible said he
[37:37] said no said that's this church
[37:40] preaching to those Pentecostal people
[37:42] that's in these denominations and
[37:44] everything bring them out of prison he
[37:46] said n look here
[37:48] brother he said Pentecost wasn't even
[37:51] mentioned there he said that he just
[37:53] said that he went and preached to the
[37:54] souls that were in prison so I said amen
[37:59] that's right and the minister looked
[38:00] around at me and said birds of a feather
[38:03] flock
[38:05] together I said that's right Brothers of
[38:08] like Precious faith believing just what
[38:12] the scripture says is the truth amen
[38:14] Daniel had three of those companions
[38:17] that were with him you know it's good
[38:19] when you're away from home to find
[38:21] somebody that's with you amen somebody
[38:24] that will stand by you a real good
[38:28] friend oh my in foreign lands when you
[38:31] find someone who wants to be your buddy
[38:33] and loves you and stands by you that's
[38:36] worth so much especially a stranger and
[38:40] these Brethren were taken away from
[38:42] their city and their city was burned and
[38:44] all their vessels and the holy things of
[38:47] God have been taken down into Babylon
[38:51] and was put into the Treasure House of
[38:54] King Nebuchadnezzar who had car not a
[38:57] great grand Gentile King now if if God
[39:01] has permitted that for their City to be
[39:04] burned their church burned and taking
[39:06] them down into the city it was because
[39:09] that they had got away from God but he
[39:11] still had a believer that he could put
[39:13] his hands on and say this is my servant
[39:16] God has always had a witness somewhere
[39:20] amen he never leaves himself without a
[39:22] witness no matter got down some
[39:24] sometimes to just one but he's always
[39:26] had somebody that he could put his hands
[39:29] on and say this is my servant and he'll
[39:31] do as I tell him now we like that
[39:35] noticing then that when these Brethren
[39:38] were down there they were put to a test
[39:41] very beautiful example of what a True
[39:45] Believer comes to when he really accepts
[39:48] the Lord Jesus as his savior he's always
[39:51] pucked to a test amen Satan still in the
[39:55] testing business
[39:57] and it only comes about to help you it's
[40:00] for your good amen every son that cometh
[40:03] to God must be tried chasen scorched and
[40:07] other words give a little thres
[40:09] straighten it up and if God gives us
[40:11] some chastisement and we can't stand it
[40:14] then we become illegitimate children and
[40:17] not the children of God now a man that's
[40:19] really got his face set towards heaven
[40:22] no matter what takes place here on Earth
[40:24] he still got his face set towards heaven
[40:28] his friends May forsake Him his family
[40:31] may forsake Him his Pastor May forsake
[40:34] Him but there's one that won't forsake
[40:36] Him that's God and when your mind is
[40:40] made up I like that Daniel had burned
[40:43] all the bridges behind him he wasn't
[40:46] planning on going back anymore amen he
[40:48] wasn't watching his back Trail he was
[40:50] looking forsaking those things which are
[40:53] in the past he pressed on to the mark of
[40:56] the high my calling that's what we
[40:58] should be doing that's what the church
[41:00] should be doing and as I noticed then
[41:04] God permitted Satan to give him the test
[41:07] and all they tested him by the fire they
[41:10] tested him also by the lons then and in
[41:13] every instant God brought them out more
[41:16] than Victorious many are the
[41:19] testings of the righteous but God
[41:22] deliver him out of them all amen how Mar
[41:26] marous that is how we appreciate that
[41:29] trials tribulations tests all working
[41:33] for the good amen after a while God can
[41:37] see then and he can put his trust in you
[41:39] and then he'll do great things for you
[41:42] now we find out then that Daniel became
[41:45] an instrument in the hand of God while
[41:49] he was away from his own people out of
[41:52] his own City away from his own church in
[41:55] a Strange Land God
[41:57] using now you can be away from whatever
[42:01] you may be you can be away from all your
[42:04] loved ones or you can be away from your
[42:06] church but you can still be an
[42:08] instrument in the hands of God God can
[42:11] use you for our testimony or for
[42:13] anything that he wishes to use you
[42:16] for beautiful examples the Bible's just
[42:19] so chug full of those things everywhere
[42:22] you turn don't you love to read the word
[42:25] oh I just read it sometime and week here
[42:28] a few days ago I was reading in the room
[42:30] there and I just had to sit down and cry
[42:33] like a baby I got up walked around my
[42:36] chair put my hand on my chair looked
[42:37] down at my Bible again I just broke I
[42:39] went around the chair again looked back
[42:41] at again I thought oh God in there is
[42:44] eternal life every man or woman that'll
[42:48] dare to put their trust in it and
[42:51] believe eternal
[42:53] life and he said search the scriptures
[42:57] for in them you think you have eternal
[43:00] life and they are they which testify of
[43:03] me yes search the scripture the word of
[43:07] God is a lamp unto our feet that we we
[43:10] should be guided then it's the light
[43:13] that follows the pathway that leads us
[43:16] from Victory onto Victory now before you
[43:20] can have a victory there has to be a
[43:23] battle and if there's no battles there's
[43:25] no victories so we are to be thankful
[43:28] for the battles and the trying it's God
[43:31] giv us the opportunity to have victories
[43:34] am oh my don't that make it a little bit
[43:37] better now see the battle come along
[43:39] somebody saying something bad about you
[43:41] sickness come on to you maybe God give
[43:43] you those light afflictions that he
[43:45] might heal you and show his favor to you
[43:49] let you see what he means by he loves
[43:51] you amen the old Shepherd story that was
[43:55] told there in jerus Jerusalem in the
[43:57] Holy lands of the sheep but was packing
[43:59] a a sheep and he said what you packing
[44:02] it for say it's got a broken leg said
[44:05] how to do that fall over cliff said no I
[44:06] broke its leg he said well you're a
[44:09] cruel Shepherd to break that sheep's leg
[44:11] said no I loved it and said it was going
[44:13] astray and I couldn't make it mind me so
[44:15] I broke its leg so I could give it some
[44:18] extra tension so that it would love me
[44:20] and follow me sometime God has to let us
[44:23] break down just a little bit in health
[44:25] to give us a little extra tension to get
[44:28] us up on his lap to woo us up in his
[44:31] bosom when the doctor said nothing can
[44:33] be done then he take us into his bosom
[44:35] say see I love you I'm going to let you
[44:38] get well oh doesn't that just make life
[44:41] a little better amen oh he's so great
[44:44] he's a marvelous Shepherd isn't he no
[44:47] wonder David said the Lord is my
[44:50] shepher I shall not
[44:52] want how he leads us for the side The
[44:55] Still Waters and restores your soul and
[44:58] runs our cups over and and anoints us in
[45:01] the presence of the enemy did you ever
[45:03] get anointed in the presence of your
[45:05] enemy just to testify to your cup just
[45:08] borrowed over you know just how
[45:11] marvelous it is to be anointed in the
[45:14] presence of your enemy now notice then
[45:20] God took King
[45:22] Nebuchadnezzar and made him a tool in
[45:25] his hand
[45:26] and when King Nebuchadnezzar died after
[45:29] he had the grass grew out he haired like
[45:32] lion like eagles feathers and his
[45:35] fingernails like the claws of the eagle
[45:37] and so forth and God had to let him know
[45:40] who was the real king after his death
[45:43] Belta seure his grandson s succeeded him
[45:48] and then he was more wicked than King
[45:50] Nebuchadnezzar and one night there they
[45:53] had a great big party they call all all
[45:56] their their magistrates and all the
[45:59] officers in for our great big
[46:02] jamere and while they were having this
[46:05] jambourine and they were went and called
[46:09] out and took the vessels the holy
[46:11] vessels of God just to make fun of God
[46:15] and drank wine to their gods a toast out
[46:19] of the vessels of the
[46:21] Lord now a man is permitted to tra so
[46:26] far but there's a separating line
[46:29] between life and death you must never
[46:32] cross that see you can go on with your
[46:36] little foolishness for a while but you
[46:38] better know where the line is did the
[46:41] Lord ever check you on anything he does
[46:44] all of us pull the check ring it's far
[46:46] enough now then you better watch what
[46:48] you're doing from that
[46:50] on if you're stepping across towards
[46:52] that line and that night when God pulled
[46:55] P the check Greens on him and he
[46:57] wouldn't listen goes on down and brings
[46:59] out the vessels of the Lord begin to
[47:01] drink W wine and them toast to their
[47:05] gods then there came a hand down out of
[47:08] heaven and wrote on the wall teeny teeny
[47:10] te praia means th weit in the boun and
[47:13] found wanting no one could interpret it
[47:16] it was unknown tongues and there was a
[47:20] man there had the gift of
[47:21] interpretation Daniel so he comes down
[47:25] and interprets and tells the king what
[47:27] would happen and there God destroyed
[47:32] that Nation amen
[47:35] Babylon while Daniel being there he saw
[47:39] great visions and
[47:41] wrot concerning them for this great
[47:45] consolation that we have today knowing
[47:48] and setting in order the end of the
[47:51] Gentile Kingdom amen notice how perfect
[47:56] just get it post now he's seen first the
[48:00] image standing in the field when he
[48:02] interpret the dream of the king he was a
[48:05] spiritual man he dreamed dreams saw
[48:08] Visions interpret dreams God was with
[48:12] him and everyone knew that too and when
[48:16] he saw the vision the head of gold and
[48:19] the breast here of silver and the thighs
[48:22] of brass and the feet of iron notice
[48:26] each kingdom got a little harder King
[48:29] Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom was a head of
[48:31] gold he interpreted told him just
[48:34] exactly how those kingdoms would succeed
[48:38] each other unto the end then notice from
[48:42] gold is the softest silver is next then
[48:46] brass is next then iron is next harder
[48:51] harder colder farther away notice
[48:56] then in the midst of all that Daniel
[48:59] beheld the image until a storm will
[49:02] shoot out of the mountain that was cut
[49:04] out without hands it rolled into the
[49:06] image and broke it and made it like
[49:09] wheat on the summer fles thrashing floor
[49:12] and the Winds Drive away and the stone
[49:15] grew into a great Mountain that covered
[49:17] all the earth and the sea that was the
[49:20] coming of the Lord Jesus which is now at
[49:23] hand amen amen goes on when he was down
[49:27] by the river one day he fell into a
[49:29] trance and saw a vision many of those
[49:31] was with him they didn't see the vision
[49:33] for it was given only to
[49:36] Daniel you see it someone can stand
[49:41] right next to you and see things that
[49:43] you can't see to save your life right
[49:47] someone said I don't believe that I
[49:48] never seen nothing because it wasn't for
[49:51] you to see
[49:52] it then it went with Paul when Paul was
[49:56] struck off of his horse and had to fall
[49:59] onto the dirt and water as it was on the
[50:02] dirt none of them heard that voice or
[50:05] seen that Vision Paul saw it none of
[50:08] them saw the star of the cross the every
[50:12] Observatory but the wise man many things
[50:15] that way God has designated for certain
[50:18] peoples to see and others cannot see
[50:21] amen oh I love that when God in his
[50:26] infant
[50:28] wisdom has predestinated or for ordained
[50:31] for certain things to happen it can
[50:33] happen to the person sitting right next
[50:35] to you and you'll know nothing about it
[50:37] amen amen look at dolphin when Elijah
[50:41] was down at dolphin and there was all
[50:43] surrounded there by the by the aliens
[50:47] that come in the Syrian Army looking for
[50:51] Elijah the
[50:53] prophet for when it begin to find out
[50:56] every time the syrians that come over to
[50:58] Israel to make war why the Israelites
[51:02] have be laning Ambush for and so the
[51:05] king of Syria called him up said now
[51:07] wait a minute who is for us and who's
[51:10] for Israel said somebody in my group is
[51:13] a spy that's going to tell Israel just
[51:17] where we're coming in at for they're
[51:19] always there waiting for us and one man
[51:22] had a little spiritual Al about him he
[51:24] said he my father but it's a Prophet
[51:28] Elijah amen for he knows in his bedroom
[51:32] what you're going to make your move next
[51:34] amen
[51:36] amen oh when Atomic Powers begin to
[51:39] shake I'm so happy that the word of God
[51:42] has tell us where to go
[51:44] to flee to the Rock Christ Jesus every
[51:49] man that is safe and secured nothing can
[51:53] harm you no Tommy bombs no Cobalts
[51:56] nothing else can touch the preserved of
[52:00] God safe secure anchored what a
[52:04] marvelous hope amen that we have in
[52:06] Christ Jesus notice there was a man with
[52:10] him his servant spiritual boy walked and
[52:14] poured water on the hands of the Prophet
[52:16] a great position he had but when he seen
[52:21] the the Syrian Army All Around dolphin
[52:24] had all backed up he said my father look
[52:28] out there what a great number while
[52:32] we're
[52:33] surrounded now that's the natural
[52:36] whenever things seems to go wrong
[52:38] partner fer actually saying this and
[52:40] that and the doctor says you can't get
[52:43] well and so forth that's just the
[52:45] natural thing you think oh my this is
[52:48] end but Elijah said there's more with us
[52:51] than there is with them amen now you can
[52:54] imagine how
[52:55] that Prophet or that gesel the servant
[53:00] he looked over at him he said well I
[53:01] don't see nobody he said God open this
[53:05] boy's
[53:06] eyes and as soon as God did
[53:09] something here it is yet when God opened
[53:14] his spiritual sight amen all around that
[53:18] Prophet stood Chariots of Fire and
[53:20] angels of fire amen why he seen why
[53:25] the church the fire outnumbered that
[53:28] Syrian Army by the thousands the
[53:30] mountains was on fire angels of fire
[53:34] horses of fire Chariots of Fire and the
[53:38] Bible said the angels of God encamp
[53:40] without those who
[53:42] fear just the same tonight I wonder what
[53:46] would happen if a man here tonight had
[53:48] the power to strap across your eyes and
[53:50] say look standing around this Tabernacle
[53:53] tonight you be a me here the rest of
[53:56] your life
[53:58] sure yes sir sometimes you can't see it
[54:01] with your natural eyes but you can feel
[54:03] the impulse of it something near a six
[54:07] sense that denotes something is near
[54:11] watching this morning opening up the
[54:13] deaf ears making the PO old cripples
[54:16] walk around here like there was nothing
[54:18] wrong with them what is it it's the
[54:21] incense I mean the sense the six sense
[54:25] it's conscious the spirit that something
[54:28] is
[54:29] there have faith in God now they didn't
[54:33] he didn't see that first but Elijah
[54:36] probably didn't see it but he asked for
[54:38] the boy's eyes to see it but Elijah was
[54:41] conscious that they were
[54:44] there amen Thomas one time said let me
[54:47] put my hands in his side Jesus said now
[54:50] you see and believe how much greater is
[54:51] their reward who has never yet seen and
[54:54] yet believe amen
[54:55] that's us tonight whosoever will believe
[54:58] without seen and notice then Elijah
[55:02] walked out there to where this
[55:03] circumstance was and he said to them
[55:06] first he went out there and the Bible
[55:08] said he smoked them
[55:11] blind blind and walked right out to him
[55:15] everyone had perfect eyes thought as far
[55:17] as I know but the scripture said they
[55:19] were blind amen amen a little fellow a
[55:23] few nights ago said to me you be a man
[55:25] of God smite me blind I said you're
[55:27] already blind
[55:30] amen already
[55:32] blind notice and he walked out there to
[55:36] where this great circumstance was this
[55:39] great thing was and he said do you look
[55:41] for Elijah said yes said come on follow
[55:44] me I'll take you right to him Elijah
[55:47] said it to them what was they blind
[55:50] about they were blind to the fact that
[55:52] that was the prophet of God they were
[55:55] blind to and he led them right straight
[55:58] down in the Ambush
[56:01] again said come on I'll show you Elijah
[56:03] and it was Elijah taking them down there
[56:06] and when they looked around and found
[56:08] that they surrounded around the king
[56:11] said my father must I smite them he said
[56:13] would you take a prisoner to Smite him
[56:15] said give him something to eat and send
[56:16] him back to their country that's the way
[56:18] to settle Wars isn't that right
[56:21] sirling oh my if we had only ad that
[56:25] principle today de feed your enemy do
[56:29] good to those that do evil to you amen
[56:32] Holy Name there now the blindness now
[56:37] Elijah I mean not Elijah now but Daniel
[56:41] Daniel fora he was a prophet he saw the
[56:45] coming of the Lord he saw the end time
[56:49] come he saw the Gentiles start and if
[56:53] you notice the G
[56:55] started off with
[56:57] a uh idol
[56:59] worship they is worshiping a great Idol
[57:02] setting out in the field an idol of a
[57:05] man I believe Daniel
[57:08] himself because King Nebuchadnezzar had
[57:11] called him beler which was his
[57:15] God and he started worshiping an image
[57:19] of a righteous holy man and Daniel
[57:22] refused to do it solded the the Hebrew
[57:26] children the Shadrach mishak and abedo
[57:29] that's the way it was issued in and it
[57:32] was condemned that head of gold was
[57:35] issued in by image worship forced to it
[57:39] and ended up in a supernatural hand
[57:43] writing a supernatural language that
[57:46] only Supernatural understanding could
[57:49] understand it amen that's the way the
[57:52] Gentile Kingdom issued in and out the
[57:55] same
[57:56] way by Supernatural Works Supernatural
[58:04] interpretation amen you know what I'm
[58:06] talking about the working of the
[58:10] supernatural oh how marvelous aren't you
[58:14] happy tonight you believe in the
[58:16] Supernatural yes now then all to these
[58:20] Visions he showed him just where the
[58:22] nations would be standing he showed
[58:25] how that there were so many years
[58:27] depended yet on the Jews he said the
[58:29] Messiah shall come he'll prophesy in the
[58:32] 70 of weeks which is three and A2 years
[58:34] in the midst of it he'll be cut off
[58:37] which is seven years 70 weeks is
[58:40] determined for thy people seven years of
[58:42] Prophecy to the Jews he said in Messiah
[58:45] the prince shall come and prophesy in
[58:46] the midst of the seven weeks seven days
[58:50] will he be cut off in the Abomination
[58:52] make a desolation to stand in his place
[58:55] and they'll tread Down the Walls of
[58:57] Jerusalem Gentiles for a time time and
[59:00] dividing of time now when Messiah come
[59:04] Jesus he preached exactly three and a
[59:07] half years and was cut off for a
[59:10] sacrifice the daily obligation was taken
[59:12] away and the desolate the Abomination
[59:15] that make of desolation the mosm of om
[59:18] was stood today in the place of the Holy
[59:21] Temple amen the mou of Omar stands at
[59:24] exactly where the temple stood and he
[59:27] said that they would tread Down the
[59:29] Walls of Jerusalem over Jerusalem until
[59:32] the Gentile dispensation be finished but
[59:36] at the end of the Gentiles there would
[59:39] still be three and a half years yet to
[59:41] the
[59:43] Jews now notice one of the most striking
[59:49] things of prophetic

[1:06:46] prophecies are fulfilled everything
[1:06:48] right down to this
[1:06:50] time the head of go has passed away as
[1:06:53] Daniel said it would the Babylonian
[1:06:56] Kingdom succeeding that he said would be
[1:06:59] the Ms and persas they succeeded the
[1:07:01] Babylonian kingom and they fell away to
[1:07:04] who the grecians Alexander the Great and
[1:07:08] they fell away to what the Romans and
[1:07:10] the Romans broke up to all the world
[1:07:13] eastern and western Rome the two leges
[1:07:15] and he said Iron and Clay was on the
[1:07:17] toes the 10 toes the 10 kingdoms and he
[1:07:21] said they wer mixing at inary among one
[1:07:23] another
[1:07:24] romanism and protestantism and in that
[1:07:28] day when this thing
[1:07:31] exists then the stone was shoot out of
[1:07:33] the mountain without hands and rolled in
[1:07:36] it broke the thing to pieces and it took
[1:07:38] the place of the image so my brethren
[1:07:42] we're having troubles tonight
[1:07:45] Wars rumors of wars earthquakes and
[1:07:48] diverse places perplex of time distress
[1:07:52] between nations I I've just come back
[1:07:54] from
[1:07:55] overseas and I haven't seen a nation but
[1:07:58] what's trembling in their shoes they
[1:08:02] don't know what's going to take place
[1:08:04] next but aren't we thankful tonight that
[1:08:07] we do know what's going to take place
[1:08:09] next the Lord Jesus Christ shall come
[1:08:12] the second time and
[1:08:13] Glory every to written in the Lamb's
[1:08:17] Book of Life shall rise with their loved
[1:08:19] ones to meet the
[1:08:20] Lord oh what a marvelous thing
[1:08:25] that's the reason we say our hope is
[1:08:27] built on nothing less than Jesus blood
[1:08:29] with righteousness All Around My Soul
[1:08:33] gives away he's our hope and stain and
[1:08:36] at that time Michael should stand the
[1:08:38] great Prince Michael was Christ of
[1:08:40] course who fought the Angelic Wars in
[1:08:42] heaven with the devil Satan and Michael
[1:08:45] fought together or fought against each
[1:08:47] other rather and now and at that time he
[1:08:51] said as many was found written in the
[1:08:53] book what was delivered and those who
[1:08:55] have done righteous watch this and they
[1:09:00] that and they that be
[1:09:03] wise shall shine as the brightness of
[1:09:07] the
[1:09:08] further and as the and they that turn
[1:09:13] away man your righteousness as the Stars

[1:09:21] Brethren I go out of morning I love to
[1:09:24] get up early don't you like to rise
[1:09:27] early I remember when brother and I were
[1:09:30] in the mountains real early in the
[1:09:32] morning around 4:00 we'd rise up look
[1:09:35] hanging back there and there was the
[1:09:36] Morning
[1:09:37] Star it gets real dark just before the
[1:09:42] break of day we see the darkness
[1:09:45] Gathering now what is it it's light
[1:09:48] pressing against the darkness one has to
[1:09:51] give away all the creepy things that's
[1:09:54] been running through the night when that
[1:09:56] sun comes up they take the shelter when
[1:09:58] the light
[1:10:00] shines night and dark night and light
[1:10:04] cannot exist in the same building it's
[1:10:07] either dark or it's light and light is
[1:10:10] so much more powerful in darkness so is
[1:10:13] Christ so much more powerful in all the
[1:10:15] enemies of the world
[1:10:17] Amen now we're taught by scientists as
[1:10:20] the light begins to come it condenses
[1:10:23] the darkness
[1:10:24] and the Darkness gathers all its host
[1:10:26] together to fight against the light but
[1:10:29] the light prevails and comes on Amen and
[1:10:32] the Bible said in the last days that
[1:10:33] Satan go back like a roar lion he's
