[0:53] [Music]
[1:07] Good morning everyone. Everyone, can we
[1:08] all stand?
[1:11] Open up in a word of prayer. Bow our
[1:14] hearts and heads. Heavenly Father, Lord,
[1:16] we're grateful to be here today.
[1:19] Lord, we're we've come with anticipation
[1:22] for what we're going to hear. We're
[1:24] thankful that you, Father, left the
[1:27] throne of glory and you became flesh and
[1:29] dwelt among us, Father. Then you died
[1:32] for our sins, Lord Jesus. The blood
[1:36] shall never lose its power. Let it cover
[1:38] everyone, Lord, that would enter this
[1:41] house of worship today, Father, and
[1:44] know, Father, that you save to the
[1:46] uttermost.
[1:48] Lord, as we listen to the preaching of
[1:50] your word, we pray, Father, that you'd
[1:52] open our eyes and heart.
[1:55] Lord, you said you stand at the door and
[1:57] knock. If any man hear your voice and
[1:59] open the door, you come into him, sub
[2:02] with him and us with you, Lord. So,
[2:06] we're looking forward to that. Father,
[2:08] come into us today in a great way. And
[2:11] we'll give you all the praise and the
[2:13] glory for it in the name of the Lord
[2:15] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:18] We'll be starting at paragraph 74,
[2:21] end 128. This is from the book of
[2:24] Revelation chapter 3 verse 14-22.
[2:29] And can we sing only believe?
[2:33] Only believe.
[2:38] Only
[2:40] believe.
[2:44] All things are possible.
[2:49] Only
[2:51] believe.
[2:52] [Music]
[2:54] Only
[2:56] believe.
[2:57] [Music]
[2:59] Only
[3:01] believe.
[3:02] [Music]
[3:05] All things are possible.
[3:10] Only
[3:11] believe.
[3:14] You may be seated, brother Brennan.
[3:18] Now we also find that has in his first
[3:22] coming wasn't at the day of the Lord. Is
[3:26] that right?
[3:28] &gt;&gt; Now back to Malachi. Let's straighten
[3:29] this out first. Coming at the day of the
[3:32] Lord. Now watch this compound coming is
[3:34] one coming and his second.
[3:36] Have you got your spiritual thinking
[3:38] ready?
[3:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:39] &gt;&gt; Sixth verse. Now he shall he'll stand
[3:42] Elijah before the great and dreadful day
[3:46] of the Lord. Is that right?
[3:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:48] &gt;&gt; Now, we realize that that wasn't John.
[3:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:53] &gt;&gt; Cuz it wasn't a dreadful day of the
[3:55] Lord, was it?
[3:56] &gt;&gt; And he knew that he could burn the
[3:57] earth.
[3:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:58] &gt;&gt; So, it must have meant a pre or another
[4:01] future coming of John of of uh of
[4:04] Elijah.
[4:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:05] &gt;&gt; Is that right? cuz he said, "I'll send
[4:08] Elijah and I'm going to burn the whole
[4:10] earth and I'm going to clean it off and
[4:14] you'll walk out upon their ashes."
[4:16] That's the millennium. We know that. And
[4:18] the atomic bomb shall blow it from
[4:20] pieces. Then there'll be the earth will
[4:22] straighten up and there be a great day
[4:24] here on the earth. And the church will
[4:26] reign with Jesus on the earth for a
[4:27] thousand years. Is that right? But
[4:30] before that great and dreadful day of
[4:32] the Lord when it's going to be blowed
[4:33] up, I'll send to you Elijah the prophet.
[4:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:38] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[4:39] &gt;&gt; So it did not mean John the Baptist in
[4:42] that state.
[4:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:43] &gt;&gt; Because a dreadful day of the Lord was
[4:45] the name.
[4:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:46] &gt;&gt; 2,000 years off. Is that right?
[4:48] &gt;&gt; Now watch the next verse. And if you'll
[4:49] be real spiritual now, now this is a
[4:52] love letter and you have to read between
[4:54] the lines and then it's made right. You
[4:57] know what I mean?
[4:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Remember how I said the
[4:59] scripture Jesus thanked God because it
[5:02] hid it from the wise and eyes and
[5:04] prudent reveal it to babes that I've
[5:07] often illustrated about my wife when she
[5:09] writes me a letter. I see what she's
[5:11] saying on the letter but I read between
[5:12] the lines and know what she means. See
[5:14] because I love her and I I know her
[5:17] nature and you have to know God's nature
[5:19] and love him. Then the scriptures stand
[5:21] right out to you. He reveals it. Now
[5:24] watch the next verse.
[5:26] And he shall turn the hearts of the
[5:28] fathers to the children. Now watch. And
[5:31] the hearts of the children to the
[5:32] fathers.
[5:34] &gt;&gt; See now when John came as Elijah, he
[5:38] turned the hearts of the Israelites
[5:43] uh the hearts of the children that was
[5:45] then accepting his message.
[5:48] Uh the hearts of the fathers to the
[5:51] children.
[5:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when he comes this time, he's
[5:55] going to turn the hearts of the church
[5:58] back to the Pentecostal fathers.
[6:01] &gt;&gt; See, it's a vice versa there.
[6:04] &gt;&gt; You get it?
[6:05] &gt;&gt; Now read it.
[6:06] &gt;&gt; Now listen close now. And he shall turn
[6:09] the hearts of the fathers to the
[6:12] children, the old Orthodox priest. He's
[6:15] going to tell them that uh while God's
[6:18] able, these stones shall raise children
[6:20] under Abraham.
[6:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you think that you can see
[6:23] now he's going to take the hearts of the
[6:24] old callous Orthodox priest and turn
[6:27] their hearts to the faith that the
[6:29] children had here.
[6:31] &gt;&gt; See how all these has been baptized are
[6:33] waiting for the coming Messiah. And
[6:35] who's warned you, you generation of
[6:37] vipers to flee from the wrath to come?
[6:40] Oh my. See, he's turning the hearts of
[6:43] the fathers to the children and the
[6:46] hearts of the children to the fathers.
[6:48] Now when this great Elijah comes in the
[6:51] end of this age, he'll be taking the
[6:53] message of Pentecost to turn the
[6:57] children to the faith of the fathers.
[7:01] &gt;&gt; Because he'll be rebuking them because
[7:04] they didn't keep this same faith that
[7:06] was back there at the beginning.
[7:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:12] &gt;&gt; Now, I believe we pretty well realize
[7:15] it's going to be Elijah, don't we?
[7:17] &gt;&gt; Now, we know it. It has. Now see, the
[7:18] dreadful day of the Lord ain't come. I
[7:21] often wondered, would this man just be a
[7:23] preacher then? Elijah had done all
[7:25] miracles, no preaching. But when his
[7:28] spirit was up on John, it done all
[7:30] preaching and no miracles.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:33] &gt;&gt; Why? Jesus was going to follow him.
[7:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:35] &gt;&gt; He'd do the miracles. For the son of
[7:38] righteous shall rise, he said with
[7:39] healing in his wings.
[7:41] &gt;&gt; So John had no need of doing miracles.
[7:43] He just announced the coming of the
[7:45] Christ. And they now remember and this
[7:48] John or this Elijah that will come will
[7:51] be misunderstood.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; He'll be such a great powerful man
[7:55] before the Lord until people think he's
[7:58] actually the Messiah
[8:00] &gt;&gt; because his very best friend said to
[8:02] him, "You're the Messiah." He said, "I'm
[8:05] not worthy to lose his shoes, but he's
[8:06] coming after me."
[8:08] &gt;&gt; Because they were under expectation then
[8:10] to see a Messiah. They thought the
[8:13] Messiah was coming. When they seen this
[8:15] great phenomena rise up among them, they
[8:16] said, "He is the Messiah."
[8:18] &gt;&gt; John said, "I'm not him, but he's coming
[8:20] after me."
[8:22] &gt;&gt; Oh my. You get it?
[8:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[8:24] &gt;&gt; So, his close friends will think he is
[8:27] the Messiah.
[8:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[8:28] &gt;&gt; Now, notice another thing will take
[8:30] place. The nature of this, he'll come
[8:33] just before the Lord's day or the earth
[8:36] never burnt in the days of John. So it
[8:39] is in the future when he comes the first
[8:43] time he only preach the second time he
[8:47] uh he will both do preaching and signs.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:53] &gt;&gt; Promised by Jesus Christ. All right. Now
[8:57] let us look at the nature
[9:00] what it will be the nature of this
[9:03] prophet that's coming out. We're
[9:05] satisfied that the angel of this last
[9:08] church age predicted from the Old
[9:10] Testament down. Now, the rest of them
[9:13] wasn't.
[9:14] Paul, Arinius, they wasn't predicted.
[9:18] But this last age at the end of the
[9:20] consummation, the end of the world,
[9:23] it'll be such a tremendous time that we
[9:26] got just ahead of us. So this angel of
[9:29] this age was predicted all the way back
[9:32] in the scripture, the old scriptures,
[9:34] the beginning up of this age.
[9:36] &gt;&gt; It's Elijah,
[9:38] great anointed one. Now watch. What kind
[9:42] of a nature will Elijah have? First,
[9:45] he'll be a mighty prophet,
[9:49] true to the word of God.
[9:51] &gt;&gt; Or Elijah was true.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; Sean was true.
[9:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:55] &gt;&gt; That's right. doing signs and wonders
[9:58] will turn the hearts of the children
[10:00] back to the faith of the Pentecostal
[10:03] fathers.
[10:04] He will hate denominations
[10:07] &gt;&gt; like Elijah did.
[10:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. He will I think we just
[10:12] got the thing started for him now. About
[10:14] time he gets to come. He'll hate
[10:16] denominations. Elijah hated him.
[10:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[10:20] &gt;&gt; And so did John hate denominations. John
[10:22] said, "Don't come think now we got
[10:24] Abraham to our father, you Pharisees and
[10:26] Sadducees, you bunch of vipers, snakes
[10:29] in the grass, other words, for I tell
[10:31] you, God's the stones to write children
[10:33] of Abraham."
[10:35] &gt;&gt; Elijah said, "They've all gone astray.
[10:37] Every one of them, nobody left but me
[10:38] alone."
[10:40] Oh my.
[10:42] He will also hate fancy women.
[10:47] &gt;&gt; Elijah did.
[10:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; Jezebel. Is that right? Amen.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; John did Herodia.
[10:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:55] &gt;&gt; Both them prophets,
[10:57] &gt;&gt; the spirit of the same spirit.
[10:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:59] &gt;&gt; They hated the denominational world, the
[11:01] church world. They hated also fancy no
[11:05] good women. They something in their
[11:07] spirit cried out against the thing.
[11:11] &gt;&gt; Jezebel was after Elijah's head is going
[11:13] to cut off and she also had John's head
[11:16] cut off. Herodia did both of them. This
[11:21] prophet will be a lover of the
[11:22] wilderness
[11:24] &gt;&gt; like Elijah. He lived in the wilderness
[11:28] alone. John in the wilderness alone.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; Then we know it's going to be Elijah.
[11:35] All right. I am this prophet will be one
[11:38] that'll stay with the true word of God.
[11:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:41] &gt;&gt; Yes. He'll stay with it.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, the word. what to to restore back a
[11:48] faith to the Ephesus church that's been
[11:51] lost all this time.
[11:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; Faith in a church that had an open door
[11:58] set before it and rejected it. Not a
[12:03] learned person. Elijah was not a learned
[12:06] person. The Tishvite. John was not a
[12:10] learned person.
[12:12] Luke 1:67
[12:14] the Bible said that he was at the child
[12:17] was in as soon as he was born he talked
[12:20] to the wilderness was in the wilderness
[12:22] till the day he was shown to Israel.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; That's right
[12:27] uh Luke 1 167 to the 80th verse if you
[12:31] want to mark it down.
[12:34] This prophet will also be a moody sort
[12:37] of a guy. Elijah after he had a great
[12:40] meeting, nobody could get along with
[12:41] him.
[12:43] Elijah had spells when he went out there
[12:45] and called fire down out of the heaven
[12:47] and burned up the altars of Baal and
[12:49] everything. He ran out in the
[12:50] wilderness. He said, "Lord, I'm no
[12:52] better than my fathers. Let me die." Is
[12:54] that right?
[12:56] &gt;&gt; And John, he sat on a juniper tree and
[12:59] after a great revival. Now he wanted to
[13:02] die. And John
[13:05] when they cast him in prison, this foul
[13:07] woman, he sat back there and began to
[13:10] get moody. I believe Timberman or one of
[13:12] them said his eagle eye got filmed over
[13:14] in the jail.
[13:16] He sent some of his disciples and while
[13:18] he declared there's the lamb of God that
[13:20] takes away the sin of the world. John
[13:22] saw the pillar of fire hanging over him
[13:24] like a dove and come down settled up on
[13:27] him witness it all and said that's the
[13:28] lamb of God and said I have need to be
[13:30] baptized you and why you come to me
[13:32] Jesus said suffer to be so now but when
[13:35] he put him in prison he gets down in the
[13:37] dumps real quick see
[13:39] &gt;&gt; kind of hard pick him up and when they
[13:42] did he said go ask him if he really is
[13:44] the one or should we look for another to
[13:46] come
[13:47] &gt;&gt; just exactly like Elijah did see just
[13:50] the same he sort of a mood he our
[13:52] fellow. So we feel sorry for him because
[13:54] we know what that is. All right.
[13:57] Now
[14:01] at the um
[14:04] the church
[14:10] Jesus
[14:10] &gt;&gt; at his manifestation I better leave that
[14:12] alone. at his manifestation.
[14:16] The the church when he makes himself
[14:18] known,
[14:20] this mighty Elijah that God will send to
[14:23] us. When he makes himself known, like
[14:26] Elijah did, the church was ready to be
[14:28] delivered.
[14:30] &gt;&gt; We're delivered out of the hands of
[14:31] paganism.
[14:32] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[14:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; Just when he come up there and said,
[14:35] "We'll prove who's God."
[14:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; Elijah delivered the church. And John
[14:42] just as John did he said when he seen
[14:45] Jesus he said I must decrease and he
[14:48] must increase. John started preaching he
[14:50] said going just before the coming of the
[14:53] Lord
[14:54] &gt;&gt; right at the end the manifestation.
[14:57] &gt;&gt; All right. Now we find out that Elijah
[15:03] must mean
[15:05] there is age to this church to prove
[15:08] that it was Elijah. Elijah after he had
[15:12] give his prophecy, Elijah did not have
[15:15] to die. He was translated
[15:18] &gt;&gt; and was taken up into heaven a type of
[15:21] the church at the end of this Elijah
[15:24] that will come at the end of his time.
[15:27] The church will go in the rapture
[15:29] without going through the shadows of
[15:31] death. It'll be the rapture. I believe
[15:34] the great Elijah, the great one that's
[15:36] to come will be the anointed Elijah
[15:38] that's prophesied for the last days.
[15:41] Amen.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; I think he will be when he comes the
[15:46] angel or the messenger to the church in
[15:48] the last days. A rejected, degraded
[15:52] people as this church will get into and
[15:54] is already. I think Elijah is promised
[15:58] in the Bible. I think we can understand
[16:00] that that Elijah was the one that was
[16:02] promised in the Bible to come in this
[16:04] day. Do you believe that?
[16:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; Now, let's turn now to Lady Oia
[16:10] and we'll see what our Lord has to say
[16:12] to us tonight about Lady Oia. Lady Oia.
[16:17] All right. The salute to the church.
[16:20] Unto the angel of the Lord, the 14th
[16:22] verse of the third chapter of
[16:24] Revelation. Unto the angel of the Lord
[16:26] of Lady Oas.
[16:28] Write these things which saith the Amen,
[16:32] the faithful and true witness and the
[16:35] beginning of the creation of God.
[16:39] Oh my, we got all we had all night on
[16:42] that right there.
[16:43] &gt;&gt; How the Lord would reveal that to us.
[16:46] Watch the amen is the last.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; He's appeared all the way down through
[16:51] and different things, but here's the
[16:52] last church age. So it says I am. This
[16:54] is the finish.
[16:56] &gt;&gt; I am the last. Now to show that he was
[16:58] the first also as he was he's the
[17:01] beginning of the creation of God.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; Do you catch it?
[17:08] &gt;&gt; See your way to
[17:09] &gt;&gt; how could God be created and he's a
[17:12] spirit.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; How could he be? He's He is eternal.
[17:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:17] &gt;&gt; He never was created. He never will be
[17:20] created because he was God at the
[17:22] beginning. Amen.
[17:24] &gt;&gt; But he that is the beginning of the
[17:26] creation of God was Jesus Christ when he
[17:28] was made manifest when God lived in him.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; He is God's creation.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; See the first and the last. The amen.
[17:37] &gt;&gt; The beginning of the creation of God.
[17:40] When God created himself a body and come
[17:41] down to live in that's the beginning of
[17:43] the creation of God.
[17:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't he wonderful?
[17:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:47] &gt;&gt; Now we find at the first he showed his
[17:50] deity right here. I am the Almighty.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; I am he that was, which is, and shall
[17:56] come. The Almighty to the church of
[17:58] Athens. They said it three times. Is
[18:00] that right?
[18:01] &gt;&gt; Comes right on over. The lady was
[18:03] standing and said, "I'm the Amen.
[18:05] &gt;&gt; I was the first back there. I'm the last
[18:07] over here.
[18:09] &gt;&gt; I am the beginning of the creation of
[18:13] God."
[18:14] &gt;&gt; Through the church ages, I would have
[18:16] you learn that I am God. Glory.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; God created a man form. I'm the
[18:23] beginning of the creation of God.
[18:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:28] &gt;&gt; That would make a Presbyterian shout.
[18:30] Just think of it.
[18:33] Beginning of the creation of God. Now,
[18:36] oh, how I like that. The creation of
[18:38] God. When God was created, when God was
[18:41] made flesh in Jesus Christ and dwelt
[18:43] among us. down. Now, the next verse
[18:47] would be to the other churches. Come in.
[18:51] But he didn't commend this church. He
[18:53] had a complaint against it, not a
[18:55] command.
[18:55] &gt;&gt; Right.
[18:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:56] &gt;&gt; He didn't command this for nothing. This
[18:59] lady was seeing her age with all the
[19:01] light that they had and went back on it.
[19:02] They didn't need any commanding.
[19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:05] &gt;&gt; They need a rebuke and they got it.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; He had a complaint for this church, not
[19:10] a command. Now I'll read the 15th and
[19:14] 16th verse here. Now I know thy works.
[19:17] Thou art neither cold or hot. I would
[19:21] that thou were cold or hot. In other
[19:24] words, don't don't just be lukewarm. So
[19:27] then because thou art lukewarm and
[19:28] neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee
[19:31] out of my mouth.
[19:34] &gt;&gt; Talk. Isn't that a command? That's a
[19:37] rebuke.
[19:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. to this ungodly leosian age. The
[19:42] worst of the whole bunch. All the rest
[19:44] of them under the torments and
[19:46] everything they had. They had nothing.
[19:47] They was povertystricken, wondered about
[19:50] and sheep skins and goat skins and
[19:52] destituted and sawed and burnt to death
[19:54] and fed the lions and everything else
[19:55] and still helped the faith.
[19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:58] &gt;&gt; And this bunch is rich and have need of
[20:00] nothing and everything else and a
[20:01] prostitute. Amen.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; Now, we got a great big lesson I hope
[20:07] the Lord helps us in. He He said,
[20:09] "Because you're neither hot or cold,
[20:12] lukewarm like milk." See, a good cold
[20:16] milk's good, isn't it?
[20:17] &gt;&gt; Hot milk's good for you, but lukewarm
[20:19] milk will make you vomit.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; Remember one night I got sick down on
[20:23] the river about 25 years ago.
[20:26] I was in a little shiny boat living down
[20:28] there. I got sick and I come up, my
[20:30] brother-in-law, take me over to Dr.
[20:31] Eiser. So what's the matter? I said I'm
[20:33] so sick at my stomach. So drink a glass
[20:34] of warm milk. Oh brother, lukewarm milk.
[20:38] It made me sick. So I just cleaned it
[20:40] all out. Was on the inside. Now God
[20:43] said, "I'd rather you be hot, real red
[20:46] hot or freezing. Be one or the other.
[20:49] Don't get lukewarm cuz you make me
[20:50] sick."
[20:53] That's what this church age does for God
[20:55] makes you sick. Either be don't e don't
[20:58] be red either be red hot or don't be
[21:00] lukewarm. warm or hot, cause you make me
[21:03] vomit. The chilliness of the England
[21:07] church in the days of John Wesley drove
[21:10] him to have meetings elsewhere because
[21:12] it was cold. Chilly.
[21:15] &gt;&gt; The chilliness of the Methodist church
[21:18] caused William Booth to become a red-hot
[21:20] salvationist.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; See, God said, "If you won't come and
[21:24] repent, I'll remove the candlestick.
[21:26] &gt;&gt; Now, take it out. Give it to somebody
[21:28] else." So when the Methodist church went
[21:30] received John Wesley sanctification,
[21:32] William Booth come right up with the
[21:33] Salvation Army and tuck it right on.
[21:35] That's right. Why? They organized it.
[21:38] It's exactly made an organization out of
[21:40] it. God said, "I hate the thing." So the
[21:42] William Booth come right along. They
[21:43] picked it up and the Salvation Army.
[21:45] Then what do you do? The same thing.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; Turn around and organized it again.
[21:49] After him come the Calites and they
[21:52] existed a while and John Smith for the
[21:54] Baptist. And after that come the
[21:55] Nazarines. and the Nazarines come
[21:58] Pentecost. Nazarines what they do big
[22:01] series up the same way denominated. What
[22:03] come in that time? Two little branches,
[22:05] church of God and so forth grow there.
[22:07] What they do organize? Just let them go.
[22:10] Along come the Pentecostals with the
[22:12] latter rain blessing. What they do?
[22:14] Organize. We just let them go.
[22:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; Now we're going to get down here at the
[22:18] end. You get something real strong in a
[22:20] few minutes.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; All right. All right. He wants you red
[22:24] hot or or freezing, one or the other.
[22:29] Don't be lukewarm. Just don't pretend
[22:31] something that you haven't got. Either
[22:33] be on fire for God or go on back into
[22:35] the in an organization. Don't uh don't
[22:39] be lukewarm. It's the same thing now.

[36:46] [Music]
[36:51] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we're so
[36:53] grateful, so thankful, Lord, to be a
[36:56] part of this great family, this great
[36:58] economy. Lord, born
[37:01] the species of God, the the very gene
[37:04] seed of God made manifest in these last
[37:06] days. Lord, what a what a revelation,
[37:09] Lord. What a privilege. What an honor,
[37:12] Lord, to be a part of your body, Lord.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Lord, you came and spoke a message,
[37:19] spoke a word by an angel, Lord, that
[37:21] brought forth birth, Lord. It brought
[37:24] forth a manifestation of your word in
[37:26] this hour in our lives. And we're just
[37:28] so grateful, Lord. Nothing we could ever
[37:31] do or ever, Lord, no more than we could
[37:34] jerk ourselves up by our bootstraps,
[37:36] Lord, and save ourselves, Lord, we could
[37:39] do nothing but by your sovereign grace
[37:42] and election, Lord. You called us, Lord,
[37:44] and made us a part of this family. Amen,
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Lord. And we love you, Lord. We love,
[37:50] Lord, everybody here. We're just so
[37:52] grateful. We just ask that you'd have
[37:54] Lord your purpose, your preeminence in
[37:57] every part of this service. Lord, let us
[38:01] Lord with all of our hearts come
[38:03] together Lord. And Lord, we we've got
[38:06] nothing Lord to to put on or nothing
[38:10] Lord to
[38:12] Lord hold back Lord because we're a
[38:15] family Lord. We're everyone a part of
[38:16] one another. And Lord, we can just come
[38:19] and put our shoulder to the wheel. We
[38:21] can just come and Lord stand with our
[38:24] brother whether whether we're up on the
[38:27] mountain or down in the valley. Lord, we
[38:29] can we don't have to hide nothing here.
[38:32] Lord, we can come Lord with each other
[38:34] knowing that there's brothers and
[38:36] sisters here that have been through it.
[38:39] Lord, knowing that that Lord, if we're
[38:41] down and we need to repent, Lord, that
[38:43] there's people that have made mistakes
[38:45] as well and they could pray. They know
[38:48] how to pray for us. Lord, if we want to
[38:50] just come and open our whole heart to
[38:52] you this morning and Lord, not settle
[38:55] for an intellectual conception, Lord, or
[38:57] just a church membership, Lord, we can
[38:59] come and Lord, press through into the
[39:01] presence of Almighty God. We're so
[39:04] grateful that where two or three are
[39:06] gathered in your name, Lord, that you're
[39:08] there in their midst, Lord, that you're
[39:10] here. We know that you're here, Lord,
[39:12] and we know that that name is
[39:14] represented here, Lord, because we're
[39:16] born into that name. We're so grateful
[39:18] that we're joint hes with Jesus. That
[39:21] all the family of God is in heaven and
[39:24] earth is named Jesus. Lord, we're so
[39:27] grateful for this great revelation in
[39:29] this hour. Lord, help us. Give us what
[39:31] we have need of, Lord. Be with every
[39:33] part of this service from the beginning
[39:35] to the end, Lord. And then let us walk
[39:37] out of here written epistles, Lord,
[39:41] reaching out, Lord, to the lost and
[39:43] dying.
[39:45] Help us, Lord. We just commit our whole
[39:47] lives, Lord. Our whole beings in your
[39:49] hands, Lord. We don't know how many days
[39:52] are left, Lord. We don't know what time
[39:54] is left, but we know that we have this
[39:56] right here. So, Lord, let us step up to
[39:59] your throne of grace and mercy today,
[40:01] Lord, with everything that we have in us
[40:04] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. Amen.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. In a while, we'll bring the
[40:12] request that may have been written out.
[40:15] We always raise our hands if we have a
[40:17] need in our heart. But before we do
[40:19] that, just want to sing thanks. And
[40:22] there's a lot of things in the verses of
[40:24] this songs that we can thank him about
[40:25] if you can't think of anything. But we
[40:27] shouldn't run out of anything to thank
[40:28] him for. He's been so good to us.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; Just what he's done is enough for us to
[40:34] praise him for eternity. But he's
[40:35] continuing to do good things today. He
[40:37] will tomorrow. And so let's just sing
[40:40] thanks. Thanks. I give you thanks to him
[40:42] this morning. I just want to say thanks.
[40:46] Thanks.
[40:48] I give you thanks
[40:51] for all
[40:53] that you have done.
[40:58] Oh, I am so blessed.
[41:02] My soul is rest.
[41:05] Oh Lord,
[41:08] I give you thanks.
[41:13] And thank you Lord for the strength you
[41:16] give to simply carry on through life's
[41:20] toils and test the worst and best. You
[41:24] never left me alone.
[41:28] You're always right beside me and you
[41:32] hear me when I pray. Since I first
[41:36] began, you've been my dearest friend.
[41:39] I give you all my praise. How many want
[41:42] to do that this morning? I just want to
[41:44] say
[41:46] thanks.
[41:48] I give you thanks,
[41:51] Lord, for all
[41:54] for all you've done.
[41:57] Oh, I'm so blessed. I am so blessed.
[42:02] My soul is found rest,
[42:06] Lord.
[42:10] And I'll give you thank this moment,
[42:11] Lord.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; I give you thanks for this moment and I
[42:18] will continually
[42:21] for each day I live your praise to give.
[42:24] Lord, I'm blessed so abundantly.
[42:28] I can't forget that moment when in my
[42:33] life you made such a change. Since your
[42:36] spirit came, I've not been the same.
[42:39] Hallelujah. I want to give you thanks.
[42:44] I'm going to say thanks.
[42:48] Thanks. I give you thanks
[42:53] for all,
[42:55] Lord, for all you've done.
[43:01] I am so blessed.
[43:04] My soul is bound rest. Oh Lord,
[43:10] I give you thanks.
[43:12] [Music]
[43:15] Even in the bad times when everything's
[43:20] going wrong,
[43:23] even on the mountain, his loving
[43:27] presence makes me strong.
[43:30] And each and every moment,
[43:34] each and every day, I'm going to sing
[43:38] and shout. Won't let the rocks cry out.
[43:41] I give you all the praise.
[43:46] I'm going to say thanks.
[43:50] Lord, I give you thanks
[43:54] for all
[43:57] for all you've done.
[44:01] Oh, I am so blessed.
[44:05] My soul has well praised.
[44:09] Oh,
[44:10] [Music]
[44:12] I Oh, I'm so blessed.
[44:16] Yes, I am so blessed.
[44:20] My soul is found rest.
[44:24] Oh Lord,
[44:26] I give you thanks. As you're seated,
[44:30] just give him a praise offering this
[44:31] morning.
[44:34] Well, I am thinking of a rapture in our
[44:38] blessed home on high with the redeemed
[44:43] are gathering in.
[44:47] I will raise the heavenly atom in that
[44:51] city in the sky. When the redee
[44:56] are gathering in.
[44:59] When the redeemed
[45:02] are gathering in
[45:06] wash like snow
[45:08] and free from all sin.
[45:12] How I will shout.
[45:15] How I will sing.
[45:18] When the redeemed
[45:21] are gathering in
[45:24] and there will be a great procession
[45:28] over on the streets of gold with a
[45:32] redeemed
[45:34] a gathering in.
[45:38] Oh, what musical, what singing or the
[45:42] city will be ruled when the redeemed
[45:47] are gathering in.
[45:51] When the redeemed
[45:54] are gathering in,
[45:56] [Applause]
[45:57] washed like stone
[46:00] and free from all sin.
[46:03] Oh, how will we shout,
[46:07] how will we sing
[46:10] when the redeemed
[46:13] are gathering in
[46:16] and saints will sing redemption story
[46:20] with their voices clear and strong. When
[46:24] the redeemed
[46:26] are gathering in,
[46:30] then the angels all will listen for they
[46:34] cannot join that song. When they're in
[46:40] are gathering in.
[46:43] Yes. When they're in the
[46:46] are gathering in
[46:50] wash like snow
[46:53] and weep from all sorts
[46:56] [Music]
[47:06] are gathering.
[47:10] Then the Savior will give orders to
[47:14] prepare the banquet for when the Redee
[47:20] are gathering in. Oh, what a day that'll
[47:23] be when we hear his invitation.
[47:27] Come ye blessed of the Lord. When the
[47:30] redeemed
[47:33] are gathering in.
[47:36] Yes. When the rain
[47:40] are gathering in
[47:43] wash like snow
[47:47] from all sin,
[47:49] [Music]
[47:50] I will shout.
[47:53] I will sing
[47:57] with the redee.
[48:01] Let's sing the chorus one more time. Oh,
[48:03] wither in
[48:06] a gathering in
[48:10] white like snow
[48:13] and free from all sin.
[48:17] How it will shine,
[48:20] how it will sing.
[48:24] When the rain
[48:26] are gathering in,
[48:34] they that wait
[48:37] upon the Lord,
[48:39] they shall renew
[48:43] their strength.
[48:46] They shall mount up
[48:49] with wings
[48:51] as a
[48:57] shall run
[48:59] and not be weery.
[49:02] They shall walk and not faint.
[49:08] Teach me Lord.
[49:11] Teach me Lord
[49:14] to way.
[49:19] Oh, teach me Lord
[49:22] to wait.
[49:26] Down on my knees
[49:30] till in your own good time.
[49:36] You answer
[49:39] my please.
[49:41] Teach me not
[49:44] to rely
[49:46] [Music]
[49:47] on what others
[49:50] do, Lord, but to wait
[49:56] in prayer for
[49:59] an answer
[50:01] from you.
[50:03] And they that wait
[50:06] upon the Lord
[50:09] shall renew
[50:12] their strength.
[50:14] They shall mount up with wings
[50:20] as an eagle.
[50:25] They shall run
[50:28] and not be weary.
[50:32] The one
[50:34] that cannot wait.
[50:37] Teach me.
[50:39] Teach me
[50:43] to wait.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe we could just all stand and
[50:50] we'll sing a worship song as the brother
[50:53] Joe Galante and somebody else can come
[50:56] up to take up the offering.
[51:00] See a lot of people that I know are
[51:01] traveling today. The Robsons are I think
[51:04] they're maybe in Washington state still
[51:07] on their way up to Canada. So remember
[51:10] their clan. It's big clan. So we always
[51:12] notice when they're when they're gone.
[51:15] Emma's homesick, not feeling well this
[51:18] morning. If you just remember her and
[51:20] your prayers and brother Joe, you have
[51:22] any others that were turned in? If you
[51:23] could bring those as well.
[51:29] God bless everyone this morning. We have
[51:31] a few prayer requests.
[51:35] Remember the David Carpenter family
[51:39] uh from Mesa. They have a funeral for
[51:42] funeral for brother David today at 2:30

[52:23] uh asking for travel mercies. Sister
[52:27] Regina, special unspoken request.
[52:31] One more here. Please remember a little
[52:33] two-year-old boy named Hudson. He was
[52:36] born with extreme heart defects and now
[52:38] he has to have brain surgery this
[52:40] Thursday. Very serious condition.
[52:44] Amen. Anyone have an unspoken request?
[52:47] Amen. Let's let's go to our Lord.
[52:51] Heavenly Father, Lord, this today will
[52:54] come unto you in the name of the Lord
[52:56] Jesus Christ. A name that it's above
[52:59] every name, Father. Lord, that every
[53:02] knee and every tongue shall confess that
[53:04] Jesus Christ is Lord. Father, we want to
[53:07] give you the honor that you do, Father.
[53:10] And Lord, as these requests have been
[53:13] spoken, Father, we just pray, Father,
[53:15] that you'd intervene.
[53:17] Drive the enemy of our souls, the devil,
[53:20] Lord, away from every one of these
[53:22] people, Father, we claim their healing.
[53:25] We're asking, Father, that those stripes
[53:27] you bore, Lord, be their portion today.
[53:31] Your blood, Father, can never lose its
[53:33] power. Father, just save, heal, and
[53:36] deliver in every situation. Guide, and
[53:38] keep every one of them. Father, you said
[53:41] that if any man be a worshshiper and do
[53:44] your will, Lord, that you would hear.
[53:46] Father, we want to be a worshipper of
[53:48] you today,
[53:50] Father, because Lord, if we can create
[53:53] that atmosphere, Lord, that pleases you,
[53:56] nothing will be impossible,
[53:59] Father. So, we're just asking, Father,
[54:01] in the precious name of the Lord Jesus
[54:03] Christ, that you'd come on the scene,
[54:05] Lord, make everyone whole. Deliver every
[54:08] situation,
[54:10] Father, and we'll give you all the
[54:11] praise and the glory for it. Amen. And
[54:15] amen.

[55:39] I came

[55:47] I came to love you Lord.
[55:54] Your holy

[56:03] Hallelujah.
[56:05] [Music]
[56:10] Oh,

[56:19] I worship
[56:21] you.
[56:24] You are my
[56:31] sister Melissa has a song for us this
[56:33] morning. Maybe we could just stand as
[56:34] she comes and we'll sing one more
[56:36] worship song. I'm longing longing for
[56:38] Jesus.
[56:40] I'm longing
[56:45] longing
[56:47] for Jesus.
[56:52] I have
[56:55] a longing
[56:57] in my heart
[57:01] for
[57:02] you.
[57:06] Just
[57:08] to be near
[57:11] him
[57:14] and to feel
[57:16] his presence.
[57:21] I have
[57:24] a longing
[57:26] in my heart
[57:29] for
[57:31] him.
[57:33] How many can say you've got a desire
[57:35] this morning? Yes, I am longing
[57:43] longing
[57:45] for Jesus.
[57:49] [Music]
[57:50] I have a longing
[57:55] in my heart
[57:59] for
[58:00] him.
[58:05] Just to
[58:07] be near
[58:09] him,
[58:12] just to feel
[58:14] his presence.
[58:20] I have a longing
[58:24] in my heart
[58:28] for
[58:29] [Music]
[58:30] him.
[58:47] [Music]
[58:54] There are times in this life
[58:59] when fear is so heavy
[59:04] and burdens
[59:06] weigh on your mind.
[59:11] You are weak in the near and no strength
[59:17] can you find.
[59:20] Just hold on.
[59:22] Helps right on time.
[59:28] My Jesus
[59:30] is always on time.
[59:36] And though you may see
[59:40] a valley,
[59:44] he sees the mountain
[59:48] you'll be standing
[59:51] [Music]
[59:58] down.
[1:00:02] I'm so glad he sees what we don't.
[1:00:09] I've seen his children walk through
[1:00:14] the darkest of midnight.
[1:00:18] I've witnessed faith put to the test.
[1:00:25] I have watched as the storms loo in with
[1:00:31] the thunder.
[1:00:34] But in each trial, he knows what's best.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad
[1:00:44] he knows what's best.
[1:00:49] And though you may see
[1:00:53] a valley,
[1:00:57] he sees the mountain
[1:01:01] you'll be standing
[1:01:07] [Music]
[1:01:11] down.
[1:01:15] I'm so glad he sees what we don't.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Now, we're expected to be tested.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; That's a good lesson for my my brother
[1:01:28] back there also.
[1:01:31] He that cometh to God must first be
[1:01:34] tested.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Tested what? With the word.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; That's God's test. Do you believe it?
[1:01:41] Amen.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; He that cometh to God must be tested.
[1:01:46] That only shows a true job.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Be tested.
[1:01:51] And when the test comes on, you can't
[1:01:53] overcome unless there's a test given to
[1:01:55] you.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; And when test is given is to see whether
[1:01:58] you can overcome or not.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said to him that overcometh.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; The test, the test is the greatest thing
[1:02:06] that ever happened to you.
[1:02:09] And I believe it's written in the
[1:02:11] scripture. Peter said uh that our trials
[1:02:14] are worth more to us than precious gold.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; It's a testing time. It's one good
[1:02:21] evidence to us that God is with us when
[1:02:24] we're tested.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; For all children of God are tested and
[1:02:27] tried.
[1:02:30] He knows the end from the beginning.
[1:02:37] And he looks ahead pass the hurt and the
[1:02:43] pain to a place where the peace passes
[1:02:49] all understanding.
[1:02:54] He sees the sun through the rain.
[1:03:01] [Music]
[1:03:02] And though you may see
[1:03:07] your valley,
[1:03:10] [Music]
[1:03:11] he sees the mountain.
[1:03:15] You'll be standing on me when all you
[1:03:20] can see are the tears falling down.
[1:03:28] I'm so glad he sees what we
[1:03:33] [Music]
[1:03:41] don't.
[1:03:45] [Music]
[1:03:47] [Applause]
[1:03:54] Amen.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is so good.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful reminder
[1:04:02] of just who how big of a God that we
[1:04:04] serve.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; He sees what we don't. He's got the
[1:04:08] answer for all of our problems. He is
[1:04:10] the answer for all of our problems.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I just want to accept that
[1:04:14] this morning. Lord, increase my faith.
[1:04:16] Take away any unbelief that we have.
[1:04:19] Amen. Fill my cup, Lord. Why don't we
[1:04:21] just ask him to do that this morning? I
[1:04:25] don't think you'll refuse any good thing
[1:04:28] from those that love him. So, Lord, just
[1:04:30] take out anything that would hinder you
[1:04:33] from filling me this morning. And just
[1:04:35] pour your spirit out on me.
[1:04:38] Just fill my cup.
[1:04:42] to you, Lord. I lift it up to you, Lord.
[1:04:46] I lift it up to you, Lord. Why don't we
[1:04:51] stand as we ask it? Come and
[1:04:57] this thirsty Lord.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:05:03] Feed me this morning, Lord, till I want
[1:05:06] no more.
[1:05:09] Oh bread of heaven,
[1:05:12] won't you feed me
[1:05:16] till I walk?
[1:05:19] No more.
[1:05:23] Here's my cup.
[1:05:27] Oh, just fill it up, Lord.
[1:05:30] Make me
[1:05:32] whole.
[1:05:34] Ask him one more time.
[1:05:36] Oh, just fill my
[1:05:40] cup, Lord. I lift it up to you, Lord.
[1:05:49] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:05:52] Oh, come and quench
[1:05:57] this thirst in my
[1:06:02] soul.
[1:06:04] Oh
[1:06:07] bread of heaven.
[1:06:11] Oh, just feed
[1:06:14] me till I want
[1:06:19] no more.
[1:06:21] Oh, here's my cup.
[1:06:26] Just fill it up
[1:06:29] and make me whole.
[1:06:32] [Music]
[1:06:34] Just ask him in your own way as the
[1:06:35] musicians continue to play.
[1:06:39] Hallelujah.
[1:06:41] Grant it, Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:06:46] He promises those that hunger and thirst
[1:06:48] after righteousness will be filled. So
[1:06:50] we ask him to that, Lord. That's me. I'm
[1:06:53] hungering and thirsting after
[1:06:55] righteousness. And so Lord, you promise
[1:06:57] you'll fill me.
[1:06:59] Come and quench this thirsty this
[1:07:01] morning.
[1:07:04] Oh bread of heaven, feed me.
[1:07:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:07:11] [Music]
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Wonderful Jesus.
[1:07:17] Thank you Lord.
[1:07:19] Just thank you for his faithfulness.
[1:07:24] Oh, just fill my cup.
[1:07:26] [Music]
[1:07:30] You can be seated if you'd like as they
[1:07:32] continue to play.
[1:07:34] [Music]
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:07:44] [Music]
[1:08:18] [Music]
[1:08:34] [Music]
[1:08:41] [Music]
[1:09:32] Amen.
[1:09:34] Bless you. Let's bow our heads for a
[1:09:36] word of prayer.
[1:09:37] Heavenly Father, we come before you this
[1:09:40] morning, Lord, asking you to fill our
[1:09:43] cups.
[1:09:45] Lord, fill our souls, our minds, our
[1:09:47] thinking with more of your word, more of
[1:09:51] your truth. Lord, more of your power,
[1:09:53] more of your anointing. Lord, we lead it
[1:09:56] in our lives, Lord. Come down in a very
[1:09:59] special way today, Lord. Speak to our
[1:10:02] hearts, Lord. We've laid aside the
[1:10:04] things of the world, Lord, and we come
[1:10:07] to hear your word, Lord, to feed on your
[1:10:11] word, oh God. feed our souls we pray.
[1:10:15] Lord, may you meet every need, Lord,
[1:10:18] that's gathered here. And for the
[1:10:20] saints, Lord, that is tuning in on the
[1:10:23] stream. May each one receive their
[1:10:26] portion. We ask in Jesus name.
[1:10:29] Amen. Amen. So, God bless each of you.
[1:10:33] So happy to be in the house of the Lord
[1:10:34] with you today. Amen. Always count it a
[1:10:38] privilege to be gathered in his name.
[1:10:40] Amen.
[1:10:42] So, we'd like to welcome our visitors.
[1:10:44] This gentleman here we met in the back
[1:10:46] there when brother Ben had met him,
[1:10:49] invited him, and so happy to have him.
[1:10:52] Happy to have each of you. Amen.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; So, let's go right into the word of the
[1:10:56] Lord. We'll take our Bibles and turn in
[1:10:59] the New Testament,
[1:11:02] Mark chapter 8.
[1:11:14] We were went to uh the meetings there
[1:11:17] with brother Mark Castillo
[1:11:19] on uh Friday and Saturday. We had a good
[1:11:22] time there in the Lord. Certainly thank
[1:11:25] the Lord for
[1:11:28] the fellowship we have with them.
[1:11:31] Lord always blesses us as we come into
[1:11:33] his presence. Amen.
[1:11:35] All right. Scripture is in
[1:11:41] St. Mark chapter 1. We'll take that one.
[1:12:03] Yes. Excuse
[1:12:20] me just a moment here.
[1:12:30] All right.
[1:12:46] My my. All right, let's get it here.
[1:12:52] Verse number 21.
[1:12:59] And they went into Capernaum, and
[1:13:01] straightway on the Sabbath day he
[1:13:03] entered in the synagogue and taught. And
[1:13:07] they were astonished at his doctrine,
[1:13:09] for he taught them as one that had
[1:13:12] authority, and not as the scribes. And
[1:13:16] there was in their synagogue a man with
[1:13:19] an unclean spirit. And he cried out,
[1:13:22] saying, Let us alone. What have we to do
[1:13:24] with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? are
[1:13:27] thou come to destroy us? I know thee who
[1:13:30] thou art, the Holy One of God. And Jesus
[1:13:34] rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and
[1:13:37] come out of him. And when the unclean
[1:13:41] spirit had torn him, and cried with a
[1:13:43] loud voice, he came out of him. And they
[1:13:47] were all amazed in so much that they
[1:13:49] questioned among themselves, saying,
[1:13:52] "What thing is this?
[1:13:55] What new doctrine is this? For with
[1:13:59] authority
[1:14:01] commanded he even the unclean spirits
[1:14:04] and they do obey him. Amen. I'll take
[1:14:08] one more scripture in Matthew
[1:14:14] chapter 8
[1:14:19] verse number five.
[1:14:27] And when Jesus was entered into
[1:14:29] Capernaum, there came unto him a
[1:14:31] centurion beseeching him, saying, Lord,
[1:14:34] my servant lith home sick of the pausy,
[1:14:38] grievously tormented. And Jesus, saith
[1:14:41] unto him, I will come and heal him. Then
[1:14:44] the centurion answered and said, Lord,
[1:14:47] I'm not worthy that thou should come
[1:14:50] under my roof, but speak the word only,
[1:14:53] and my servant shall be healed. For I am
[1:14:56] a man under authority, having soldiers
[1:14:59] under me. And I say to this man, "Go,"
[1:15:02] and he goeth. And to another, "Come,"
[1:15:05] and he cometh. And to my servant, "Do
[1:15:08] this," and he doeth it. And Jesus heard
[1:15:11] it, he marveled.
[1:15:14] And he said to them that followed,
[1:15:17] "Verily I say unto you, I have not found
[1:15:20] so great faith, no, not in Israel. And I
[1:15:25] say unto you that many shall come from
[1:15:27] the east and west and shall sit down
[1:15:30] with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the
[1:15:33] kingdom of heaven, but the children of
[1:15:35] the kingdom shall be cast out into outer
[1:15:38] darkness. There shall be weeping and
[1:15:41] nashing of teeth. Amen. So um two
[1:15:46] portions in the scripture there. We'll
[1:15:48] read one more one more portion in
[1:15:51] Matthew chapter 8. All right.
[1:15:55] or we just read that in Matthew 8.
[1:15:57] Sorry, we'll take um Mark chapter 5 is
[1:16:02] what we want.
[1:16:08] And this is another ruler, a man of
[1:16:12] authority
[1:16:13] coming to Jesus.
[1:16:16] Mark chapter
[1:16:21] number eight.
[1:16:30] I'm sorry. Mark chapter 5.
[1:16:34] You're all gonna have to pray for me
[1:16:36] today. All right.
[1:16:39] Mark chapter 5. We'll get it here in
[1:16:41] just a minute. All right. That's right.
[1:16:45] Right. And the scripture that I want
[1:16:47] here is in verse
[1:16:50] number
[1:16:53] 21
[1:16:57] Jesus was passed over again by ship unto
[1:17:00] the other side. Much people gathered
[1:17:03] unto him, and he was nigh unto the sea.
[1:17:06] And behold, there cometh one of the
[1:17:08] rulers of the synagogue, Jarias by name.
[1:17:12] When he saw him, he fell at his feet. He
[1:17:14] besought him greatly, saying, My little
[1:17:17] daughter lith at the point of death. I
[1:17:20] pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her
[1:17:23] that she may be healed and she shall
[1:17:26] live. And Jesus went with him and much
[1:17:30] people followed him and thronged him.
[1:17:34] And a certain woman which had an issue
[1:17:36] of blood. Let's skip down. She comes
[1:17:38] through there and she touches the hymn
[1:17:40] of Jesus. And then verse 35. And while
[1:17:44] he spake, there came from the ruler of
[1:17:46] the synagogue's house a certain which
[1:17:49] said, "Thy daughter is dead. Why
[1:17:52] troublest thou the master any further?"
[1:17:55] And as soon as Jesus heard the word that
[1:17:57] was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of
[1:18:00] the synagogue, "Be not afraid,
[1:18:04] only believe."
[1:18:06] And so we know that the Lord went to
[1:18:08] this man's house and calls her forth
[1:18:13] from the dead and he'll do that again
[1:18:17] even today. Amen.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Let us pray and ask the Lord to bless a
[1:18:20] word. Father, we ask your blessing upon
[1:18:24] this meeting this morning. We place it
[1:18:27] into your capable hands. We're not
[1:18:29] capable, but it's you. You're the one
[1:18:33] here that can speak to our hearts. And
[1:18:36] we need that, Lord, today. Every one of
[1:18:38] us need you to speak to our hearts so
[1:18:42] that we can grow in your grace and mercy
[1:18:45] so that we can do the things that would
[1:18:46] be pleasing unto you. May you grant it,
[1:18:50] Lord. Move aside every hindrance and
[1:18:52] every weight. Bring the clarity of our
[1:18:55] minds under the authority of the Holy
[1:18:58] Spirit. Right now is our prayer in Jesus
[1:19:01] name. Amen. God bless you. You may be
[1:19:04] seated.
[1:19:05] So, we've been speaking about this
[1:19:07] adoption and how the sons and daughters
[1:19:10] of God in Romans and Ephesians are
[1:19:14] predestinated to the adoption of
[1:19:17] children. We're not just predestinated
[1:19:21] to be saved. We thank God for salvation.
[1:19:24] But then there's a portion that we move
[1:19:27] forward in the authority and that is a
[1:19:30] position in Christ where that son leaves
[1:19:34] from just being a son to where in the
[1:19:39] Roman way they had this ceremony of
[1:19:43] adoption and we've been through that a
[1:19:45] number of times and with this is several
[1:19:48] services on it. It just keeps going
[1:19:50] different ways. How this a son different
[1:19:54] nothing than a servant and a son.
[1:19:56] There's no difference. But that son is
[1:19:59] put under tutors and governors until the
[1:20:02] time appointed of the father. And then
[1:20:04] at that appointed time, we don't know
[1:20:06] how long this tutoring time takes. Um
[1:20:10] how long that great testing takes for
[1:20:13] Abraham was quite some time. Joseph had
[1:20:16] a tremendous test. Elijah and Elisha.
[1:20:20] Elisha coming from
[1:20:22] rowing, hoing uh the field out there to
[1:20:25] coming into becoming a prophet. There
[1:20:28] was a training time for him that he
[1:20:30] finally had to take Elijah's mantle. He
[1:20:34] couldn't just follow him and be a
[1:20:36] servant to him. But Elijah came to him
[1:20:39] and says, "I'm going to believe in you."
[1:20:41] And so that puts another stress. It's
[1:20:44] easy to be in the backseat of the car
[1:20:48] and tell everyone how they need to drive
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; and we're going miles and miles and
[1:20:54] miles and you wake up and start pointing
[1:20:55] fingers on where you should have how we
[1:20:57] should have did it. But when you get
[1:20:59] behind the wheel yourself
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; and you now have are responsible to
[1:21:04] getting to the place on time and safely
[1:21:08] um it's a different responsibility.
[1:21:11] And so I believe that the Lord trains us
[1:21:14] and teaches us those um things through
[1:21:20] the things that we suffer, tests and
[1:21:22] trials. Every child here can probably
[1:21:26] point out what a perfect parent should
[1:21:29] be. But when they get married and have
[1:21:31] their own children,
[1:21:33] don't tell me, just show me. Show me
[1:21:36] what a perfect parent is because you'll
[1:21:39] get the fine opportunity to do just
[1:21:41] that.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; And Elijah and Elisha went through this
[1:21:45] time of training. Joseph had these
[1:21:48] dreams and this call of God on his life.
[1:21:51] And he went through this tremendous
[1:21:52] test, a test he didn't know he would
[1:21:55] have to go through. Moses and all the
[1:21:58] great leaders and the true believers
[1:22:01] have to go through these times of
[1:22:03] testing before you're placed with the
[1:22:06] authority of a son, an adopted son or
[1:22:11] let's say a son that has reached his his
[1:22:15] position in Christ. That placing, you
[1:22:18] know, every time a young man comes to
[1:22:20] the altar to be saved, we don't know if
[1:22:23] that could be the next pastor in this
[1:22:25] city. We don't know if that could be the
[1:22:27] next missionary. We don't know what God
[1:22:29] is going to do with that newcomer.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; But time will tell us through the
[1:22:33] teachings, through the test and trials
[1:22:36] and life. Everybody that come don't
[1:22:39] stay. Everybody that gets baptized, they
[1:22:42] don't remain in it. We've seen them come
[1:22:45] and go. But God by his grace has us here
[1:22:48] today.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; And all we can say is thank you, Lord.
[1:22:51] Amen.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Because there's people better than you
[1:22:54] and I
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; that fell off a long time ago.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; But we're still here
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; with God's grace and a desire to serve
[1:23:02] him.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. We ought to be grateful for that.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. We should be thankful for that
[1:23:08] today
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; that we're still here.
[1:23:13] But here is uh two portions in the
[1:23:18] scriptures. We read three. But these two
[1:23:20] places in the scriptures are
[1:23:22] highlighting two men of authority coming
[1:23:26] to the man who really has the authority,
[1:23:29] the Lord Jesus. One was a Roman
[1:23:32] centurion. He has no background for
[1:23:36] faith as it pertains to um being a
[1:23:40] Hebrew. Doesn't say that he was a
[1:23:43] procelite. He was just a ruler. Ruler of
[1:23:46] a hundred men. He's a gentile, but
[1:23:50] somehow the Romans being rulers over the
[1:23:53] Hebrews or the Israelites, he would have
[1:23:55] to know some of the customs and the
[1:23:58] hearsay. And you have to hear of the
[1:24:00] fanaticism amongst this group of Jews,
[1:24:05] these folks that have this strange way
[1:24:08] that they worship and so forth. Um but
[1:24:12] something how faith comes to him somehow
[1:24:15] some way with all of his Roman uh
[1:24:19] intellectuals and his access to health
[1:24:22] care maybe of the day. Maybe his ability
[1:24:25] to take that servant in to get healed or
[1:24:28] sick through their physicians and so
[1:24:30] forth. For some reason this man with a
[1:24:34] hundred men under him wants to bring his
[1:24:37] servant to Jesus.
[1:24:40] He finds the right man, doesn't he?
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; He brings him, he brings his request to
[1:24:46] the right person. And that person was
[1:24:49] the Lord Jesus. And he calls out to him
[1:24:52] and said, "I have a servant that is
[1:24:54] violently sick. Actually, he's being
[1:24:57] tormented with a policy. And this policy
[1:25:01] is a paralysis. It's a it's the losing
[1:25:04] of of the the the nerves, the sensation
[1:25:08] in the nerves. There's a couple of
[1:25:10] different um uh uh definitions of what
[1:25:13] that is, but the Bible tells us it he
[1:25:17] was in torment.
[1:25:20] So, it wasn't just a little sickness,
[1:25:22] but he his body is being torn down and
[1:25:25] deteriorating. And this man, a Roman
[1:25:28] centurion, actually loved this man that
[1:25:32] was his servant. So he comes to Jesus,
[1:25:35] brings his request to the right person
[1:25:39] and he tells him, "Lord, I have a
[1:25:42] servant and I want you to heal him." And
[1:25:46] Jesus says, "Okay, we'll come to your
[1:25:48] house and we'll go heal him. Where's he
[1:25:50] at?" Oh, no, no, no, Lord. We don't need
[1:25:53] you to be troubled that way. I am an
[1:25:56] important guy, too. And I have people
[1:25:59] that are under me and I have many tasks
[1:26:01] that have to get done. So what I do is I
[1:26:04] tell this one to go and go and come and
[1:26:07] come and they obey me. They just do it.
[1:26:10] And Lord, if you got the power to heal
[1:26:13] right here or whether you go lay hands
[1:26:16] on them, if you just say it in the word,
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; just speak the word
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; and my servant will live.
[1:26:25] You know what's nice about this is that
[1:26:28] there is no Mosaic Mosaic teachings that
[1:26:32] taught him this.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; What he learned this from was just the
[1:26:36] ability to understand authority.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; The ability to understand authority.
[1:26:43] Authority is something that is given to
[1:26:45] you. They they um I read this study here
[1:26:49] some time ago that um they took these
[1:26:53] people and they had them to look into a
[1:26:55] crowd of other people. I think it was a
[1:26:57] public place like a like an airport. He
[1:27:00] said looking in the airport you can see
[1:27:03] um the people that had authority and
[1:27:06] those that did not just by watching
[1:27:09] them. And it's not that they were
[1:27:11] wearing uniforms. This is not this, but
[1:27:13] it's just the way that a person carries
[1:27:15] themsself when they know who they are.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; If they're a position of authority, if
[1:27:22] they know what they know and they're
[1:27:24] confident in who they are, they carry
[1:27:26] themselves a certain way. Remember the
[1:27:29] story brother Bam gives of the slaves
[1:27:32] that the buyers were coming to buy a
[1:27:35] slave
[1:27:37] and he looked over the field and he was
[1:27:39] trying to assess which slave to buy and
[1:27:42] he finds a certain slave that he wanted.
[1:27:44] He said, "I want to buy that one." He
[1:27:46] says, "Well, that one's not for sale."
[1:27:48] Well, why not? Well, that's the one I
[1:27:50] want. I've noticed him. He has his head
[1:27:52] up. Do you feed him any different? No.
[1:27:55] He eats in the same place like all the
[1:27:57] other slaves. Do you treat him any
[1:27:59] different? Nope. Is he a boss like the
[1:28:02] Nope. He has the same circumstances like
[1:28:05] all the other slaves. So why is he
[1:28:08] conducting himself this way? Now this is
[1:28:11] um this is a slave buyer looking at a
[1:28:15] slave from a distance. This isn't the
[1:28:18] slave buyer talking to the slave
[1:28:20] himself. This is him looking at him from
[1:28:23] a distance and saying that one is
[1:28:27] valuable.
[1:28:28] What if the Lord can look at our praise
[1:28:30] service this morning
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; from a distance
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; and don't tell me how much you believe?
[1:28:36] Don't tell me how much faith you got.
[1:28:37] Just let me look at the video
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; and see who really was worshiping the
[1:28:42] Lord this morning.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; You know, worship and praise has an uh
[1:28:47] emotion to it.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; There's something to it. I can tell
[1:28:52] those that were in the game just by
[1:28:54] watching the fans how they act. I know
[1:28:57] which team you're on. When somebody
[1:29:00] scores, doesn't matter what you're
[1:29:01] wearing, doesn't matter what you look
[1:29:03] like. If you're in the game and somebody
[1:29:05] scores, we're going to see that. We'll
[1:29:06] notice that. And so this this authority
[1:29:10] is something down on the inside.
[1:29:16] And I believe that the church of the
[1:29:17] living God has to come to the knowledge
[1:29:21] that they are sons and daughters of God.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; That they're just not a, you know, a
[1:29:27] sideway or part-time believer,
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; but that we actually belong to somebody.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; That actually somebody loves us.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; And everything we need is not in some
[1:29:38] praise from some man or some outside,
[1:29:42] you know, reinforcement. Everything I
[1:29:44] need is right here
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; in the presence of the most high God.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; That's where I'm safe. That's where I
[1:29:52] know I'm complete in him.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; So all people that run, they leave. They
[1:29:58] they they they don't want to have
[1:29:59] anything to do with you. They'll
[1:30:01] criticize you and it hurts for a little
[1:30:03] bit. But when you know that you belong
[1:30:04] to the Lord,
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; guess what you're going to do?
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; You're gonna keep on going.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; You're gonna keep on moving forward.
[1:30:12] Yeah.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; And this this authority is quite clear
[1:30:17] with this Roman centurion. Now, Jarius,
[1:30:23] he was a ruler of the synagogue. And so,
[1:30:27] he was a believer as well, but more than
[1:30:30] a Roman centurion, he was a Hebrew. He
[1:30:32] was one of the Jews. He actually had a
[1:30:35] position in the temple, in the
[1:30:40] synagogue. He um uh they they were
[1:30:44] responsible over overseeing many of the
[1:30:48] tasks that would take place, the worship
[1:30:50] and setting things up. They were not
[1:30:52] priest. They were not um uh uh in that
[1:30:56] order of a Levite or a priest, but they
[1:30:59] were rulers and they had a name I can't
[1:31:02] pronounce right now that they would uh
[1:31:05] they had the oversight. And so they they
[1:31:08] managed the upkeep of the synagogue.
[1:31:12] they they help coordinate the different
[1:31:14] things that take place and make sure
[1:31:16] that uh the prayers and the reading of
[1:31:19] the of the word was in order and those
[1:31:22] things and how that position was
[1:31:24] developed I don't quite know but there's
[1:31:27] not just one uh ruler of the synagogue
[1:31:30] in the New Testament there's another one
[1:31:32] Chrisus in the book of Acts you can read
[1:31:35] about him but this one here his name is
[1:31:38] Jarius and he has a daughter you know
[1:31:41] What's interesting about Jarius, he was
[1:31:44] a believer. He was a ruler in the
[1:31:46] synagogue. He comes to Jesus and Jesus
[1:31:49] is in a great campaign. He has a lot of
[1:31:52] people following him at the time and his
[1:31:56] ministry had grown so much. He preached
[1:31:59] over on one side of the uh of the sea
[1:32:03] and he comes back on the other side and
[1:32:06] this large group of people follow him.
[1:32:09] And this ruler in the synagogue finds
[1:32:13] Jesus and he falls down at his feet to
[1:32:16] worship him. And I want to say that he
[1:32:19] came with the right approach.
[1:32:22] He was a he was an important man. Yes.
[1:32:24] But I I I it'd be hard to find many
[1:32:28] so-called Christians that would do what
[1:32:31] this man did to actually fall down on
[1:32:36] before the Lord Jesus with his requests.
[1:32:41] Many Christians, we hate to say it, but
[1:32:43] there's so much pride involved in us
[1:32:46] because we we know so much and we're not
[1:32:49] like that one and we're not like them
[1:32:51] out there and we so ain't like them over
[1:32:54] there and it just breathes this little
[1:32:56] pride or like a arrogancy.
[1:33:00] But a true believer knows where he comes
[1:33:03] from
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; and he knows that his praise and his
[1:33:06] worship belongs to him. And we didn't
[1:33:10] actually come here to be seen by one
[1:33:12] another.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; We came here to worship the most high
[1:33:15] God.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many times I've come to
[1:33:19] church and I didn't even worship him. I
[1:33:21] wonder how many times people have come
[1:33:23] to the house of the Lord. Open up their
[1:33:25] Bible. Went through the motions but
[1:33:28] never really worshiped him. have
[1:33:32] spiritual requests and needs in their
[1:33:35] life but will never take the time to
[1:33:39] fall down and worship him. God have
[1:33:43] mercy upon that spirit.
[1:33:45] We all get it, don't we? We all get a
[1:33:48] little coldness and we feel like I'm not
[1:33:50] going to bother the service or I'm not
[1:33:51] going to bother the master or you know
[1:33:53] it's just about time to close. I'll just
[1:33:55] keep this little thing here. But this
[1:33:57] man's daughter was violently ill. She
[1:34:00] was dying.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; So that moved him out of his position,
[1:34:04] didn't it?
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; And he comes into the presence of the
[1:34:07] Lord and he fell at his feet. And the
[1:34:10] Bible says he besought him greatly.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; It wasn't just like, "Lord, yeah, I got
[1:34:16] a prayer request. Let me just slip." No,
[1:34:18] he besought him greatly.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; He had a serious need.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; And let me say this. If there's ever a
[1:34:26] time you're in a church service and
[1:34:28] there's one soul or two that's
[1:34:31] beseeching him greatly, please don't get
[1:34:34] in their way.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Please don't make them feel out of
[1:34:37] order.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Please encourage them to beseech the one
[1:34:42] who can change their circumstance.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Make it easier for them. Actually pray
[1:34:48] for them. stop staring and start praying
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; for them.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; And there are many Christians, they're
[1:34:55] very curious because Christians are very
[1:34:57] interesting people. Particularly church
[1:35:00] folks. We like to look around at one
[1:35:02] another. Who's mad at who? Who's
[1:35:04] fighting today? How did y'all get here?
[1:35:06] Look at her. She's a little mad. He's a
[1:35:08] little upset. He need to go to the
[1:35:10] altar. She need to, you know, church
[1:35:12] people. Huh? Come on. Somebody help me
[1:35:15] preach in here. But we didn't come here
[1:35:17] to look at nobody else. We came here to
[1:35:20] meet Jesus
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; because he's got the power
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; to move on our behalf.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Amen, somebody.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; You know the Satan likes to disturb
[1:35:34] that. He likes to change that and and
[1:35:37] and and move our motives and our
[1:35:39] objectives because that's his job. He's
[1:35:42] a great adversary and he wants you to
[1:35:45] come here and leave from here and not
[1:35:49] achieve. He wants you to achieve
[1:35:50] everything but what you were supposed to
[1:35:52] achieve according to the scriptures.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; And so here he comes to Jesus. He lays
[1:36:03] down himself. He beseechs the Lord
[1:36:05] greatly. He has a request and that was,
[1:36:09] "Lord, would you come and lay your hands
[1:36:12] on my daughter? She's violently sick.
[1:36:16] She's dying. Would you come?" And Jesus,
[1:36:20] after being besought greatly, he he
[1:36:23] answers this request. He makes the test.
[1:36:26] He makes the the trip to this man's
[1:36:28] house. And while on the way to the
[1:36:30] house, this woman with an issue of blood
[1:36:32] comes and touches him. And we know the
[1:36:36] story with her. We won't take time to go
[1:36:38] there, but she he uh he's on the way to
[1:36:43] fulfill this request. And then out of
[1:36:46] nowhere, another servant comes from
[1:36:49] Jarius's home. And says, "Don't trouble
[1:36:53] the master any further. Your daughter is
[1:36:56] dead."
[1:36:58] There was a little hope when she was
[1:37:00] still alive, but she's dead now. Don't
[1:37:03] trouble him. any further. So, we know
[1:37:06] that he was troubled. We know that Jesus
[1:37:10] dealing with all of these people, this
[1:37:12] great ministry he had. And here's one
[1:37:14] man pulling him aside to come to his
[1:37:17] house. I mean, to break up the meeting
[1:37:20] and come to his house. And so, he's a
[1:37:22] Jew. And this is the way he is taught.
[1:37:25] The prophet of God tells us that the Jew
[1:37:28] has been taught that hands must be laid
[1:37:31] upon them. And this is a teaching. So
[1:37:35] he's definitely working in him in the
[1:37:37] way he was taught is for this uh Jesus
[1:37:41] to come and lay hands upon him. And we
[1:37:45] see this and Jesus is going to fulfill
[1:37:48] this request for this man. And while
[1:37:52] going there the real bad news come the
[1:37:55] bad bad news they go from bad to worse.
[1:37:58] She's dead. Your daughter is dead.
[1:38:01] Jesus stops immediately when he hears
[1:38:04] this. The Bible says when he hears this,
[1:38:06] he looks at the man says, "Don't be
[1:38:08] afraid. Be of good cheer. Only believe."
[1:38:14] And this is what we need to hear today.
[1:38:17] Sometimes we bring our requests before
[1:38:18] the Lord. It looks like the situation
[1:38:20] gets worse. How many's ever had that
[1:38:23] happen to you?
[1:38:24] Looks like nobody heard you or it got
[1:38:27] worse or it's just doing on the same.
[1:38:30] But I'm going to say to you, be of good
[1:38:32] cheer. Only believe.
[1:38:36] Only believe.
[1:38:38] You know, God doesn't have a hearing
[1:38:40] problem. He heard you the first time you
[1:38:43] prayed, but he does hear also your
[1:38:46] complaining and your dismay, too. And
[1:38:49] every time things get worse, we start to
[1:38:52] complain a little bit. Even within our
[1:38:54] heart, we know our faith kind of drops
[1:38:57] down when those bad news come our way.
[1:39:00] But we have to have faith, saints.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; We got to be encouraged.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; We have to be of good cheer.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Not of a sad cheer, but of good cheer.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Only believe. And so here our Lord is
[1:39:14] now coming to the house. The girl is
[1:39:17] dead. The people are crying. Jesus has
[1:39:20] to put all the people out of the house
[1:39:23] and he brings Peter, James and John and
[1:39:26] calls for the life of this child and God
[1:39:30] answers that request. Now
[1:39:34] why is the Gentile
[1:39:38] moving in this realm of authority and
[1:39:41] the Jew is moving in the realm of laying
[1:39:44] on of hands? Well, they're moving that
[1:39:47] way because that's the way they were
[1:39:48] taught.
[1:39:50] And sad, but it's true. Many Christians
[1:39:54] today, Hebrew or not Hebrews, but
[1:39:58] gentile Christians still live under the
[1:40:01] teaching of lay hands on me.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; And it is biblical and as the scriptures
[1:40:08] are for. They shall lay hands on the
[1:40:09] sick and they shall recover. He that is
[1:40:13] sick or he that committed any sins call
[1:40:16] the elders of the church. Let him anoint
[1:40:18] him with oil and the prayer of faith
[1:40:20] shall save the sick. It's absolutely
[1:40:22] part of the scriptures is absolutely a
[1:40:25] way to get to it to get the job done.
[1:40:28] Let me ask you a question. If laying
[1:40:31] hands on the sick and you still have to
[1:40:35] call on God or believe God to do the
[1:40:37] work,
[1:40:39] laying hands on the sick is still no
[1:40:41] guarantee that it's going to happen.
[1:40:43] We're just going through the motions of
[1:40:45] laying hands on the sick. That's what
[1:40:47] the word says. It still needs a
[1:40:49] supernatural to make it happen.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; So, what's easier for the word to just
[1:40:54] be spoken?
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Receive your healing. you're already
[1:40:59] healed.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Or going through the task of having
[1:41:03] hands laid upon you. They're both work.
[1:41:06] They're both good.
[1:41:08] One's taking a flight to Phoenix. The
[1:41:10] other one is maybe riding a bicycle, but
[1:41:13] you're still getting to Phoenix. They
[1:41:15] both work, but which one is better?
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; What is a better way of travel?
[1:41:24] Come on, somebody.
[1:41:26] A better way of travel is Actually, if I
[1:41:29] have a choice, first class.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; If it's free, is it free? First class.
[1:41:35] Absolutely.
[1:41:37] And and um and and that is a better way
[1:41:41] of travel. And I don't criticize those
[1:41:43] that would take the bus or ride their
[1:41:45] bike or drive their own car or take the
[1:41:48] shuttle, but if I have a ticket to fly
[1:41:51] wherever I'm going, then that's the way
[1:41:54] I want to go.
[1:41:56] And this is all to do with the teaching.
[1:42:00] How were you taught?
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; The Roman came without any religious,
[1:42:05] you know, he didn't have any religious
[1:42:07] stuff. All he knew was authority.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; And it's interesting that God wants to
[1:42:13] get the church to move in this line of
[1:42:17] the authority of the spoken word over
[1:42:20] just lay your hands upon me. What an
[1:42:23] example did God give us as the first
[1:42:26] gentile convert. Who was he? He was a
[1:42:30] centurion, an Italian. Acts chapter 10.
[1:42:33] What was he was a roy? He was a a Roman.
[1:42:36] He was a centurion. He was a gentile. He
[1:42:38] was an Italian.
[1:42:40] And God uses him as the first convert
[1:42:44] for the Gentiles. Here he is a man of
[1:42:47] authority that God uses. Pours out the
[1:42:51] Holy Ghost upon him. I think it's saying
[1:42:53] something.
[1:42:54] I believe it's saying something. Now,
[1:42:57] let's go into the message just a little
[1:42:58] bit. All right. Hear what the prophet of
[1:43:01] God says in the message who
[1:43:04] Let's take here.
[1:43:06] Just read a few places here. The Lord
[1:43:09] will help us.
[1:43:12] Amen.
[1:43:16] Now the scripture that we read there
[1:43:20] in Mark chapter 1, he taught as one that
[1:43:25] had authority.
[1:43:30] Hear what the prophet says here in the
[1:43:32] message to see Jesus.
[1:43:36] What a difference Jesus was in the
[1:43:38] church of that day. That what he is in
[1:43:42] the church of today. He taught them as
[1:43:46] one with authority. That he knew what he
[1:43:49] was talking about. We speak today as if,
[1:43:52] well, I just don't know whether it's so
[1:43:54] or not. I read here that they uh that
[1:43:58] they healed the sick, but I just don't
[1:44:00] know whether it's right or not. Not
[1:44:02] Jesus. He knew where he was standing. He
[1:44:06] knew what is his authority. He knew that
[1:44:09] God would keep his word. He said to
[1:44:11] them, "Destroy this tabernacle. Destroy
[1:44:14] this temple. I'll raise it up in three
[1:44:16] days." He was speaking of his body
[1:44:19] knowing that one scripture in the Bible,
[1:44:21] one scripture had reference to that. And
[1:44:24] David and the prophet said, "So, so this
[1:44:28] authority comes back to you knowing what
[1:44:32] you're talking about."
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:34] Amen.
[1:44:36] You got to know what you're talking
[1:44:38] about. You know, somebody came to my
[1:44:42] house and begin to tell me who my
[1:44:44] brothers and sisters were. And they
[1:44:47] started adding people and adding names
[1:44:49] in there that didn't belong. I'm going
[1:44:50] to stop him real quick. No, you got the
[1:44:52] wrong family. That's not my family. Now,
[1:44:55] I know what I'm talking about.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; And therefore, I can stand firm when I'm
[1:44:59] saying it. I don't have to go back in
[1:45:01] the corner like I kind of, you know, I
[1:45:03] think you're kind of No, I'm going to
[1:45:04] stand firm. I know who my brothers are.
[1:45:06] I fought with all of them. I know who my
[1:45:09] sisters are. I got into it with all of
[1:45:11] them. Those are my siblings. I'm a man
[1:45:15] speaking with authority because what? I
[1:45:18] know what I'm talking about.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; And this is Jesus. He taught the
[1:45:24] scriptures as one that knew what he was
[1:45:28] talking about.
[1:45:30] And when Jesus was preaching, they heard
[1:45:32] his preaching. This man preaches like he
[1:45:35] knows what he's talking about.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; How you're supposed to witness.
[1:45:41] How should you be singing?
[1:45:43] How should you be praising the How
[1:45:45] should you be doing anything associated
[1:45:48] with the Lord? You ought to sing that
[1:45:51] song like you know what you're singing
[1:45:54] about. Preach the gospel like you know
[1:45:58] what you're preaching about. Claim your
[1:46:01] healing. Like you know
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; what you're talking about.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Claim the deliverance. Claim your
[1:46:09] family. Claim your healing. Claim
[1:46:11] everything
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; based on the authority
[1:46:15] of the word of God.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; He spoke like a man that had authority.
[1:46:21] He knew what he was talking about.
[1:46:24] Amen.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; You know, have you seen people
[1:46:28] tell things that wasn't true?
[1:46:32] You know, he's lying.
[1:46:34] You know that's impossible. They're
[1:46:36] selling some product or something
[1:46:39] they're saying is miracle, whatever the
[1:46:41] new miracle is. But the man who's
[1:46:44] telling it is quite convincing
[1:46:48] because he's telling it because he
[1:46:49] really believes it. And even though it's
[1:46:52] not true, it's like, man, this I like
[1:46:54] listening to this guy
[1:46:57] because I'm not gonna buy his shoes. I'm
[1:47:00] not gonna buy his product, but he sure
[1:47:02] knows
[1:47:04] his stuff.
[1:47:07] And this is, you know, he he doesn't
[1:47:09] have the authority. His authority is
[1:47:11] that he can get you to sign a contract.
[1:47:13] His authority, his motivation is to get
[1:47:15] you to buy or sell or whatever it is.
[1:47:18] What about a son or daughter of God?
[1:47:21] What about a Bible preacher?
[1:47:25] What about a mom or a dad that believes
[1:47:27] in the word of God?
[1:47:30] Can they not take the authority of the
[1:47:33] word and take their confession and make
[1:47:39] it line up with God's word?
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Absolutely you can. Don't let the devil
[1:47:43] fool you. Don't let the devil make you
[1:47:45] feel like you don't know that this is
[1:47:47] right or this is true. like you hiding
[1:47:51] something or like you're not telling the
[1:47:52] truth. This is the only thing that is
[1:47:53] true, saints.
[1:47:56] Amen.
[1:47:58] And so Jesus taught like one had
[1:48:00] authority here. What the prophet of God
[1:48:02] says in the greater than Solomon is
[1:48:04] here. Now look, everyone has been taught
[1:48:07] this tradition. And I say to my brothers
[1:48:10] and which is all right. It's scripture,
[1:48:13] but we want to lay hands on one another.
[1:48:16] Did you notice that? But that wasn't
[1:48:18] given to the Gentiles. That wasn't the
[1:48:21] way the Gentiles
[1:48:23] accepted it. So if you want to know the
[1:48:26] way the Gentiles received the Holy
[1:48:28] Ghost, remember he went to the Jews, he
[1:48:31] went to the Samaritans, then he went to
[1:48:33] the Gentiles. In Acts chapter 2, the
[1:48:36] Holy Ghost fell out upon the whole
[1:48:38] group. Then it goes over to the
[1:48:41] Samaritans. And then in Acts chapter 10,
[1:48:44] he opens up Peter uses the key to the
[1:48:47] kingdom to open it up to the Gentiles.
[1:48:49] And how did it happen with the Gentiles?
[1:48:53] It's not a nothing, it's a something.
[1:48:56] While he was ministering to them other
[1:48:59] groups, Peter went and laid their hands
[1:49:02] on them that they would receive the Holy
[1:49:04] Ghost. But not with not with Cornelius.
[1:49:07] Not in not in Cornelius's house. in
[1:49:10] Cornelius's house. He they hadn't even
[1:49:12] been baptized yet.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; And the preaching of the word has
[1:49:17] started preaching. And as he's preaching
[1:49:19] the word, they received it by the word.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost fell while he was
[1:49:29] preaching.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost came down while the
[1:49:33] preaching was going on.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; That's the Gentile program.
[1:49:38] We receive it by the spoken word.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; I didn't have to be in Jeffersonville.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; I didn't have to be at the literal tape
[1:49:45] service.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; But I heard something. And when I heard
[1:49:49] it, I received it.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's our claim. Is
[1:49:59] that right?
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Now, many times, Brother Brandham, he
[1:50:02] would go in prayer. I got one or two
[1:50:05] examples. He'd go in prayer because of
[1:50:07] his great gift in his life. How God used
[1:50:09] him and the angel of the Lord came to
[1:50:13] him in his great commission. He tells
[1:50:15] that story in the life story in many
[1:50:18] other places in the prayer line. Went
[1:50:20] around the country, went around the
[1:50:22] world and many times in his prayer he
[1:50:25] would include
[1:50:27] by what authority he was doing what he
[1:50:30] was doing.
[1:50:31] sometimes when he married a couple at
[1:50:33] the end he says a divine gift that was
[1:50:36] ministered to me by an angel
[1:50:39] and and in one place I think it's in the
[1:50:42] message um I jotted it down in the
[1:50:44] message uh the power of decision
[1:50:46] paragraph 83 he's laying hands on this
[1:50:49] sister and he says by the power of the
[1:50:54] authority of the word of God and the
[1:50:57] Holy Spirit and the angel that was
[1:51:01] ministered unto me, that had ministered
[1:51:04] unto me. So, he uses this authority now
[1:51:08] to move this other power off of his
[1:51:11] sister.
[1:51:13] He's using his ranks now to call the
[1:51:16] bluff of the enemy.
[1:51:19] I am a man of authority. I say to one,
[1:51:22] go and it goes. I say to one, come and
[1:51:25] it comes. This authority has been given
[1:51:29] to the church.
[1:51:31] Whatever you say in my name, you can
[1:51:34] have it. We just don't pray it. We speak
[1:51:38] the word and the spoken word brings our
[1:51:41] deliverance. Is that right? Brother says
[1:51:44] this in faith is the substance 1951
[1:51:47] paragraph 50 59 says, "Now I've tried to
[1:51:50] be honest. I tried to be as true as I
[1:51:52] know how. Now please my Christian
[1:51:55] friends accept my word now. Now I speak
[1:51:58] now upon the authority of the angel of
[1:52:01] God who is coming nearer and nearer me
[1:52:05] all the time here at the platform and on
[1:52:08] the word of God which is Jesus Christ
[1:52:11] inspired to write men to write.
[1:52:15] Says it again in God testifying of his
[1:52:17] gifts. 1952 almighty God bless this
[1:52:21] woman who I bless in thy name. He said,
[1:52:25] "Whatsoever you bind on earth will be
[1:52:27] bound in heaven. Whatsoever you loose on
[1:52:29] earth, I will loose in heaven." The keys
[1:52:31] was given unto the church. Now upon the
[1:52:34] authority of the Bible and upon the
[1:52:37] authority of my risen Lord who is
[1:52:40] present now with his angel manifesting
[1:52:44] these things, I now say, "Cursed be this
[1:52:48] tumor in the woman in the name of Jesus
[1:52:52] Christ. May it go from her.
[1:52:56] How many's ever heard any messages from
[1:52:59] Oral Roberts? He's on the YouTube. He's
[1:53:02] got a had a tremendous healing ministry
[1:53:06] and TL Osborne and many of them. And
[1:53:09] they they they did great things that God
[1:53:11] used him to heal and save. Aa Allen,
[1:53:14] another one great ministry, great. By
[1:53:17] what authority were they doing that on?
[1:53:20] They was doing it by the authority of
[1:53:21] the word of God. God is a healer. He's
[1:53:24] not confined to your organization or the
[1:53:26] denomination. He's not confined only to
[1:53:29] your church or to your little group. He
[1:53:32] is confined in his word. And anybody
[1:53:34] that takes him at his word now has the
[1:53:37] authority that comes with that word.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; So you don't have to ask permission
[1:53:45] to receive the word of the Lord. You
[1:53:48] just receive it freely and you go
[1:53:51] forward with it. Amen. So the word of
[1:53:54] God gives us the authority. Is that
[1:53:57] right? That's where we get our
[1:53:59] authority. Who? They asked Jesus several
[1:54:02] places. By what authority are you doing
[1:54:05] this? Now, as I said the other day,
[1:54:09] Satan wants you to try to grab a
[1:54:11] position. He wants you to rise yourself
[1:54:14] above somebody else.
[1:54:17] And he wants you to have a position in
[1:54:21] his kingdom. But God has a position for
[1:54:25] every believer too that we should be
[1:54:26] coming to. And Satan and his power and
[1:54:30] the way he wants to exercise the
[1:54:32] authority and power is one man ruling
[1:54:36] over another man. But that's not so in
[1:54:39] the kingdom of God. In the kingdom of
[1:54:40] God, we're trying to find the Holy Ghost
[1:54:43] power in our lives.
[1:54:46] He has anointed us and endowed us with
[1:54:49] his spirit. And with that spirit being
[1:54:52] the church of the living God, he gives
[1:54:54] us power over all unclean spirits. We
[1:55:00] have that power now. This church has it
[1:55:02] now. The true church has it. Is that
[1:55:04] right? The Bible church has it. Is that
[1:55:06] right?
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; They have the authority over every
[1:55:10] unclean spirit. Does that include
[1:55:12] cancer? Yes. that include deafness and
[1:55:15] and and paralysis includes all of it.
[1:55:18] Church has a power, but we're afraid to
[1:55:21] use it. Many times we speak as if we
[1:55:24] don't know what we're talking about or
[1:55:26] maybe it didn't happen before. Maybe
[1:55:27] we're just a little we need to be taught
[1:55:31] what authority is. It's not by might.
[1:55:35] It's not your power, but it's the
[1:55:37] authority
[1:55:38] that God has given us. Now, brother Bam
[1:55:42] takes this and he goes further and he
[1:55:46] tells us that it is the way that they
[1:55:50] were taught.
[1:55:52] He said that everyone has been taught to
[1:55:56] lay hands, have someone to lay hands
[1:55:58] upon you. But now let's take this
[1:56:01] message. The Roman nobleman 1955
[1:56:05] messenger says this here
[1:56:10] paragraph number four. Did you notice
[1:56:12] when he was going to pray for Jarius's
[1:56:14] daughter to be raised? Jarius was a Jew
[1:56:18] and he would been trained to lay hands
[1:56:21] on people. Jarius said, "Come lay your
[1:56:23] hands on my daughter and she'll live."
[1:56:25] He had been taught that laying on hands.
[1:56:30] But to the Gentile, he had been taught
[1:56:33] power and authority.
[1:56:36] It's according to what you believe.
[1:56:40] Both of their faith was in Christ. One
[1:56:43] said, "Speak the word and it be done."
[1:56:46] The other one said, "Lay your hands on
[1:56:48] and it'll be done." See, it's according
[1:56:51] to what you believe.
[1:56:54] Now, I I I I think the main goal is here
[1:56:58] is that you have faith.
[1:57:00] All right, all of you just have faith in
[1:57:02] the Lord. If laying hands up on you is
[1:57:05] going to get the job done for you.
[1:57:07] Praise the Lord. I believe that 100%. I
[1:57:10] have a lot of confidence in laying hands
[1:57:12] on the sick. I really do. I believe it's
[1:57:14] God's word. It's not my word. I didn't
[1:57:16] make it up. And so when we call people
[1:57:18] up to pray for them, I believe it with
[1:57:20] all my heart. It's in the scripture.
[1:57:23] James 5 and lay anoint them with oil and
[1:57:25] pray for them. And I believe it makes a
[1:57:28] difference. But there's a teaching for
[1:57:30] the Gentiles that we should be coming
[1:57:32] into. And there's a tutoring and a
[1:57:35] teaching that the redeemed son should be
[1:57:38] coming into. And that is the spoken
[1:57:41] word. And that is the word spoken from
[1:57:46] the mouth of the word of God ought to be
[1:57:48] enough.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Now, if you can hear it spoken, then
[1:57:53] that's your permission right there. Then
[1:57:55] it's yours right there. If you can have
[1:57:58] faith to believe it, but it's according
[1:58:01] to what you believe. The prophet
[1:58:03] continues in what would visions are
[1:58:05] 1956. And he says this here, these
[1:58:08] handkerchiefs being I I have more
[1:58:10] success with the handkerchiefs, I guess,
[1:58:12] than anything else, especially with the
[1:58:15] American people. American people got an
[1:58:19] idea in their head that somebody has to
[1:58:22] touch them or do something to them or
[1:58:25] lay hands on them where they ever got
[1:58:28] that. Just a Jewish tradition. And I'm
[1:58:30] trying to get you to believe the Gentile
[1:58:34] way of it. See, the Jews says, "Now you
[1:58:37] come lay your hands on my little girl,
[1:58:39] she will live." Jarius, that was a Jew.
[1:58:43] But the Romans said, "I'm not worthy
[1:58:44] that you'd even come under my house.
[1:58:47] come under my roof said I'm a man under
[1:58:50] authority say to this one go he goeth
[1:58:53] everything under me has to mind me and
[1:58:56] he recognize the supreme authority that
[1:59:00] Jesus had over diseases he said you just
[1:59:04] speak the word and my servant will live
[1:59:07] now there you are that's it now Jesus
[1:59:10] never said too much about Jarius only he
[1:59:13] got what he asked for he went and laid
[1:59:15] his hand on the daughter. But he said to
[1:59:17] these people there that followed, he
[1:59:20] said, "Now that's great faith. I haven't
[1:59:24] found faith like that in Israel." See,
[1:59:27] now we want the greater faith. We want
[1:59:31] to run a higher level. The Lord Jesus
[1:59:35] wants us to believe in him.
[1:59:38] We want first class.
[1:59:41] That's how we want to fly. We want to
[1:59:43] fly first class.
[1:59:46] And we want the higher faith, the higher
[1:59:48] level. Now, we're not disparaging the
[1:59:51] other levels. They all get there. It's
[1:59:54] all faith. But Jarius did that because
[1:59:57] he was taught that way. The Roman did
[2:00:01] what he did because he was taught that
[2:00:03] way. and the prophet now through the
[2:00:07] word, the third pool and the opening of
[2:00:10] the word. What is he trying to teach
[2:00:12] those who are the children of Malachi 4?
[2:00:15] What is he trying to teach you sitting
[2:00:17] in the pew listening to the tape? What
[2:00:19] is he trying to teach you? Oh, I missed
[2:00:22] it. I wasn't here when the prophet was
[2:00:23] here. I missed the meeting. I wasn't
[2:00:25] here. Or is he trying to teach you to
[2:00:26] pick up the word
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; and receive the word of the Lord that
[2:00:31] was spoken? Amen.
[2:00:34] Amen. And it's a higher level. We want a
[2:00:37] greater faith.
[2:00:39] We want the Lord Jesus wants us to
[2:00:42] believe him.
[2:00:44] This is the authority
[2:00:46] of the word of God that we have already
[2:00:50] been given that authority. Is that
[2:00:52] right? We've been given the authority,
[2:00:56] but we don't use it. Many times we're
[2:00:58] afraid to use it. Why is that?
[2:01:02] Why are we afraid to take God at his
[2:01:05] word?
[2:01:07] Um, it's the higher order of believing.
[2:01:11] It's what hopefully we're being taught
[2:01:14] and trained into. You know, the
[2:01:16] authority is like is like, you know, in
[2:01:20] those ranks in the Roman ranks or any
[2:01:24] soldier or any kind of hierarchy like
[2:01:27] that, you got to start somewhere. And
[2:01:29] some people can't receive authority and
[2:01:34] therefore they probably shouldn't be in
[2:01:36] authority.
[2:01:39] And some people want the authority, but
[2:01:40] they can't be submissive to nobody.
[2:01:45] Every job they had, it was the boss's
[2:01:48] fault or somebody else's fault. They
[2:01:51] can't submit. You know, submitting
[2:01:54] doesn't mean you're going to submit to
[2:01:55] people that are always right. You got to
[2:01:57] submit to people that are wrong. You got
[2:01:59] to submit to the situation until God
[2:02:02] gets through what he wants to accomplish
[2:02:04] in your life. I feel like Joseph was a
[2:02:07] prime example of somebody that went
[2:02:10] through all of the rungs of being a
[2:02:12] slave and being lied on and being tested
[2:02:14] and tempted. Now he's ruler over
[2:02:17] everything. That's the kind of man I
[2:02:19] would want judging my case. I wouldn't
[2:02:22] want somebody who's never been through
[2:02:23] nothing judging my case. If you're going
[2:02:25] to get a fair deal, you're going to get
[2:02:27] it from Joseph. Because Joseph knew what
[2:02:29] it was to be in the the the the the the
[2:02:33] very lowest of society around criminals
[2:02:37] and people who lied on him and all of
[2:02:40] those things that happened. And then and
[2:02:43] then to know that he really overcome
[2:02:46] brother John when he was at authority.
[2:02:48] Now he's got his position. This is the
[2:02:50] prime example, Joseph, to get him back.
[2:02:54] You got the power to get him and you can
[2:02:57] legally do it. But it proved that he
[2:02:59] really passed the test, didn't he?
[2:03:02] Because when he had the opportunity to
[2:03:03] turn it on his brothers, he didn't. He
[2:03:06] showed grace and forgiveness to them.
[2:03:12] Some of us want to get Joseph's place so
[2:03:15] we can get back at them. Soon as I get
[2:03:18] the opportunity, I'mma get them.
[2:03:20] I'mma get her. She messed with the wrong
[2:03:23] person this time.
[2:03:27] Soon as I get my money right, I'mma get
[2:03:30] you. And that's the attitude of many
[2:03:32] people. But Joseph, he went through all
[2:03:35] of that. He was given the authority.
[2:03:37] He's given the power. He's given now
[2:03:39] he's at the right. Could you imagine
[2:03:41] Joseph running into potterer and his
[2:03:44] wife?
[2:03:46] Imagine that.
[2:03:47] Now, Joseph, this woman lied on him. Got
[2:03:51] him sent into another prison. He doing
[2:03:53] more time when his life is doing kind of
[2:03:55] good. I mean, he's doing better than he
[2:03:58] ever did as a prisoner. But this woman
[2:04:00] lies on him and throws him into another
[2:04:03] prison and it's got this big old cycle
[2:04:05] again. And then the Lord begins to build
[2:04:07] him up and make it the way he made it.
[2:04:09] And then you come to find out the Lord
[2:04:11] wanted him in that particular prison.
[2:04:14] And so now he's up at a position of
[2:04:16] authority. Now he's placed above
[2:04:19] everybody.
[2:04:22] It's Pharaoh, then Joseph, and Piper had
[2:04:25] to be under there. Could you imagine
[2:04:27] Joseph, let me go hunt her down. Let me
[2:04:30] go get her. That lie she told on me. I'm
[2:04:33] going to That's how some of us are
[2:04:35] vindictive. It shows that our maturity
[2:04:37] isn't there yet. But when you really
[2:04:39] mature and you really got the healing
[2:04:41] that you needed and you really advanced
[2:04:44] by the right way, oh my,
[2:04:49] you'll be hunting them down to show them
[2:04:51] grace
[2:04:52] and favor. And this was Joseph.
[2:04:56] And we don't have that
[2:05:00] like we should. I don't think Lord help
[2:05:02] us. Right? How many can say Lord help
[2:05:05] us.
[2:05:07] God has given us a great heritage, a
[2:05:09] great portion of his word. And what if
[2:05:12] he gave you that power to do the
[2:05:15] miraculous today? Would you use that
[2:05:18] power against those that disagree with
[2:05:20] you?
[2:05:22] Would you use it in an argument? I'm
[2:05:24] going to prove you're wrong. Smoke them.
[2:05:26] Smoke.
[2:05:28] Would you use it as a pastor? You going
[2:05:31] to leave my church? I'm gonna show you
[2:05:33] you're wrong. Smoke them, Lord.
[2:05:36] call fire down.
[2:05:39] Lord, let their business burn up.
[2:05:43] I'm praying, "Dear Lord, let their
[2:05:45] business burn." That's not the right
[2:05:47] prayer.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. That's not a mature
[2:05:51] son.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; That's what foury olds do. That's what
[2:05:56] children do.
[2:05:58] But sons that have matured,
[2:06:01] they take that power and they have it
[2:06:04] graced with character.
[2:06:07] Now they got the power to hurt, but
[2:06:10] they're not going to use it to anyone's
[2:06:11] hurt. They now return it with grace.
[2:06:14] Now,
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; it's frustrating trying to serve people.
[2:06:26] Um, this is why the people that work in
[2:06:28] the public, they have such a hard time
[2:06:30] and they're not happy really happy to
[2:06:31] see you. Many times they they got a bad
[2:06:35] attitude. The bus drivers and people
[2:06:37] serving the public and they just they've
[2:06:39] seen it. They're they got they're just
[2:06:41] upset. They have a bad and then, you
[2:06:44] know, you you take that over into the
[2:06:45] realms the church. You're trying to help
[2:06:47] people. They're trying to, you know,
[2:06:49] show them away and show grace and favor
[2:06:51] to them and then they turn around and do
[2:06:54] things that's a little shady. It makes
[2:06:55] you mad, right?
[2:06:58] And you want to get back at them. But
[2:07:01] you you'll know you're mature when
[2:07:03] you're not getting back at them. And you
[2:07:05] can.
[2:07:07] No, you're not done yet, sis. You're not
[2:07:09] done yet, bro. You need to come back.
[2:07:10] You still want to get back at them.
[2:07:11] Yeah. I just can't wait to come back.
[2:07:14] Come back.
[2:07:17] Come back. sit back in the back of the
[2:07:18] bus for a minute and you need to take
[2:07:21] this trip over again. Like, come on,
[2:07:23] Lord. I already took this trip. No, you
[2:07:24] ain't learned nothing yet.
[2:07:29] Lord, help us.
[2:07:32] And we get through our destination and
[2:07:33] we went through whatever we went through
[2:07:35] that we come out and all of our accusers
[2:07:38] and all of those that did whatever they
[2:07:40] did, there's nothing but grace and love
[2:07:44] and forgiveness to them. Lord have mercy
[2:07:47] upon them. Bless them. Lord
[2:07:51] have mercy. Show favor. Show grace.
[2:07:54] Maybe your attitude towards them
[2:07:59] might determine
[2:08:01] their eternal destination.
[2:08:04] That's a quote. Now, you want me to read
[2:08:06] it? It's in the message. It's in the fly
[2:08:09] leaf of my Bible. It's not in my notes.
[2:08:11] I'm going to close here just now. send
[2:08:13] spiritual revelation or it was changed
[2:08:16] to the great commission
[2:08:18] 1958
[2:08:20] March 18. If you want a blessing and get
[2:08:22] a blessing when a man has done you
[2:08:25] wrong, he's absolutely justly I mean he
[2:08:28] has done you wrong and you know that
[2:08:31] he's done you wrong. He has done you
[2:08:33] evil. Don't mention that. you take him
[2:08:36] to prayer before God and don't take it
[2:08:39] in a way of just a selfish say well I'm
[2:08:42] ashamed to do this but stand with your
[2:08:44] shoulder to his shoulder and stand in
[2:08:48] the presence of God our father the way a
[2:08:50] prayer should be made in the presence of
[2:08:53] God say father here's my brother he is
[2:08:56] justly he deserves punishment because he
[2:08:58] has done me evil and I don't see why he
[2:09:01] did it then let go of talking to you and
[2:09:05] You'll see maybe what the man's been
[2:09:07] through. The devil has twisted him up
[2:09:10] somewhere and caused him to do that.
[2:09:12] Though he's absolutely wrong, before you
[2:09:14] leave the throne of God, you'll be
[2:09:17] feeling sorry for that man. You'll be
[2:09:20] sympathizing with that brother. When you
[2:09:23] get back down to where earth again,
[2:09:25] you'll go after to that brother and
[2:09:28] shake his hand because you know what
[2:09:30] he's been through.
[2:09:32] You can't stand with the mortal in the
[2:09:34] presence of God and condemn anybody. I
[2:09:39] don't believe. No. Even if he's a ranked
[2:09:41] sinner. What about a brother that made a
[2:09:44] mistake? Though I say he's wrong
[2:09:46] sometime that he's accused wrong when
[2:09:49] he's not wrong. But if he is wrong,
[2:09:51] we'll take him to the throne of God.
[2:09:53] stand there shoulderto-shoulder with our
[2:09:55] brother knowing he's immortal and maybe
[2:09:59] his destination
[2:10:01] rest upon our attitude towards him.
[2:10:05] Huh?
[2:10:07] When we come back from the throne of
[2:10:09] God, we'll realize that we're everyone
[2:10:11] guilty and we all need help one from the
[2:10:15] other and the best way is to pray.
[2:10:19] That's powerful. That's an authority.
[2:10:22] That's a You know, the the the
[2:10:24] believers, the Christians are the
[2:10:25] difference makers.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; The Christians that are in your family,
[2:10:29] that are on the job, that are in the
[2:10:31] neighborhood, they ought to be the
[2:10:33] difference makers. They're not the ones
[2:10:35] starting the fires. They're putting them
[2:10:37] out.
[2:10:38] It's sad. So many Christians join in in
[2:10:41] this negativity and they just start this
[2:10:43] thing and then they just get carnal and
[2:10:46] more carnal and more carnal when we're
[2:10:48] supposed to be headed to
[2:10:52] little gods.
[2:10:56] We're supposed to be moving into that
[2:10:58] realm of
[2:11:01] amateur gods.
[2:11:04] Is that right?
[2:11:06] An amateur god
[2:11:09] still gossiping.
[2:11:12] Amateur gods ain't gonna be gossiping.
[2:11:15] No, they're doing something different. A
[2:11:17] church members gossiping.
[2:11:19] Church members doing all kind of stuff.
[2:11:21] But an amateur god,
[2:11:24] he gonna get back at you.
[2:11:27] You going to find a way to catch to to
[2:11:29] to to you know get in a quote battle
[2:11:32] with you?
[2:11:35] I'm not looking for no quote battles,
[2:11:37] brother Scott. Brother John, get in a
[2:11:40] quote battle. I throw this quote at him.
[2:11:42] Hit them in the head with this quote.
[2:11:44] Then they hit me with a quote. Then I
[2:11:46] hit them back with a scripture. And
[2:11:47] we're fighting back. Fighting back. Hey
[2:11:49] man, I ain't got time for that.
[2:11:52] I'm supposed to be believing the word.
[2:11:55] Amen. somebody. It's a higher level.
[2:11:59] It's a higher order to take the spoken
[2:12:03] word.
[2:12:05] Now, we can lay hands upon you and we
[2:12:08] will. And I need hands laid upon me.
[2:12:11] Yes, I'll receive that. Absolutely. But
[2:12:15] what is the message trying to teach us?
[2:12:19] The higher level. And the higher level
[2:12:21] is the word said it.
[2:12:25] And we believe it that way. And not only
[2:12:28] does the word say it, but you say it.
[2:12:31] You speak the word. And that spoken word
[2:12:35] will take on flesh. It'll take on
[2:12:39] material.
[2:12:40] It'll happen if you believe it. The
[2:12:44] Roman centurion simply says, "Lord, if
[2:12:46] you say it in the word, my servant will
[2:12:49] live." And Jesus marveled at that. He
[2:12:53] stopped Jesus in his track. He had all
[2:12:55] of his disciples there. He had this
[2:12:57] great ministry, the thousands
[2:13:00] following him and coming after him. And
[2:13:03] the Romans says, "You know what?
[2:13:06] Keep keep ministering to them. You don't
[2:13:08] have to leave what you're doing. Just
[2:13:09] say the word. If you say the word, it's
[2:13:12] going to happen." And when he spoke the
[2:13:14] word, Jesus said, "Wow, what a faith.
[2:13:17] What a faith."
[2:13:19] And that very hour, boom, it happened.
[2:13:22] His servant was healed of a violent
[2:13:25] disease. He'll do the same thing for you
[2:13:27] today. If you believe that,
[2:13:32] you believe the spoken word can come
[2:13:33] forth from this pull pit here.
[2:13:36] Believe a scripture can be read that
[2:13:38] change the dynamics of what you're going
[2:13:41] through.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; How many believe that?
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[2:13:47] That's where it comes from. It comes
[2:13:49] from the word. All right, let me read
[2:13:51] one more for you. Okay, and we'll close
[2:13:54] right here. The prophet now starts to
[2:13:57] share with us and we all know this. And
[2:13:59] he brings the difference between an
[2:14:02] angel and a son.
[2:14:05] And he's talking about the authority
[2:14:06] that a son has over an angel.
[2:14:11] Now in power, an angel would have more
[2:14:13] power as far as his ability to do things
[2:14:16] because he's created such. But a son has
[2:14:20] the authority over all the powers
[2:14:24] if he can only believe it.
[2:14:27] He's a slave. Yes, he's in the slave
[2:14:30] house. Yes, he's getting the same food.
[2:14:33] He's getting the same thing like the
[2:14:34] other slaves. But he knows he's taught
[2:14:37] that his daddy was the son that he's the
[2:14:41] son of a king. And so that slave owner
[2:14:44] was looking I never finished that story,
[2:14:46] did I? The slave owner I'mma finish it
[2:14:48] right now. Thank you. The slave owner
[2:14:51] was looking out over the house. He's
[2:14:53] like, I want to buy that one. Well, that
[2:14:55] one's not for sale. Well, why not? Well,
[2:14:57] that's the one I want. Why you want him?
[2:15:00] Is he prettier than others? Oh, I want
[2:15:04] him. Why do you want him? I've been
[2:15:06] watching him work.
[2:15:08] I've been watching him. And there's
[2:15:10] something about him that's different
[2:15:11] than the other slaves. His head is up.
[2:15:14] He's working. He's getting it done. You
[2:15:17] must He must be a boss. You must be
[2:15:18] feeding him more. He must have a
[2:15:20] position. Says, none of that is true.
[2:15:22] He's just a regular slave. Said, "What
[2:15:25] makes him act so different?" He said,
[2:15:27] the boss said, "I wonder, too."
[2:15:29] So, I found out that he is the son of a
[2:15:33] king.
[2:15:35] That over in Africa, his daddy is the
[2:15:37] king over a tribe. And even though he's
[2:15:40] an alien, he's a he's been taken in
[2:15:43] slavery, he's going to conduct himself
[2:15:46] like the son of a king.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; And that's you and I today. How are you
[2:15:52] conducting yourself? Are you looking for
[2:15:55] vengeance?
[2:15:57] Are you looking you got animosity in
[2:15:59] your heart? Are you jealous?
[2:16:02] You know, jealousy, look the word up.
[2:16:05] Jealousy is a spirit that wants to get
[2:16:06] on all kind of human beings. I'm talking
[2:16:09] about all colors, all genders, all
[2:16:12] positions. Jealousy is one of them.
[2:16:15] Preachers jealousy, other preachers,
[2:16:17] this guil jealous of that one. It's a
[2:16:19] spirit. It's not your brother is. Look
[2:16:21] the word up and you tell me, "Oh, that
[2:16:23] spirit never came. You stop telling a a
[2:16:26] lie like that.
[2:16:28] Jealousy is a real spirit.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; How many you know what I'm talking
[2:16:33] about? Who going to be honest here?
[2:16:35] Don't Don't raise your hand. Don't raise
[2:16:36] your hand. Cuz because if you sitting
[2:16:39] here, I know that spirit come to you.
[2:16:42] Anybody has anything like you or close
[2:16:44] to you, a little bit better than you,
[2:16:46] it's like
[2:16:48] you don't start hating on them.
[2:16:50] Jealousy.
[2:16:55] Church is jealous of other churches when
[2:16:57] we should be thankful and praising the
[2:16:59] Lord with a testimony. You giving a
[2:17:02] testimony you thinking people praising
[2:17:03] Lord people getting jealous over you
[2:17:08] and that spirit just one of them
[2:17:11] emulations. Emulations is to compete
[2:17:14] against
[2:17:17] greed. How many know what it means to be
[2:17:20] greedy?
[2:17:21] I'm not talking about getting a second
[2:17:23] scoop of ice cream or whatever it is.
[2:17:26] I'm talking about greedy,
[2:17:30] not content
[2:17:33] what the Lord has given you,
[2:17:36] never happy, just upset all the time.
[2:17:39] You're you if if if these spirits are on
[2:17:42] you, you're not walking your in your
[2:17:44] authority.
[2:17:45] Brother or sister, you're a son of the
[2:17:49] most high God.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; That's your authority. You're a son of
[2:17:54] God. You're a daughter of God.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; Nothing can hurt or harm you or even
[2:18:01] stop you unless God allows it.
[2:18:05] So this slave, he's there, he's a son of
[2:18:08] the king. He's conducting himself like
[2:18:10] the son of the king. And the slave
[2:18:13] masters and everybody around him
[2:18:14] watching from afar can see it just like
[2:18:17] God can see you too.
[2:18:23] Your morale, the way you carry yourself.
[2:18:27] Just walk through the airport, you'll
[2:18:29] see the ones who have some kind of thing
[2:18:32] about them. Look at public. Look into
[2:18:34] the look into the just the worship of of
[2:18:38] just any little sanctuary. You just
[2:18:40] watch the believers. You watch them. You
[2:18:42] watch human nature. You watch people.
[2:18:46] People that have money,
[2:18:49] they walk a certain way. And people that
[2:18:51] are broke
[2:18:54] walk a certain way. I know what I'm
[2:18:57] talking about. Because I was broke.
[2:19:01] I'm still broke, but I don't act like
[2:19:04] I'm broke. There's a big difference
[2:19:07] because why? My dad owns everything.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; And if I need it, guess what? I'm going
[2:19:13] to have it
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; It's the authority. It's the authority.
[2:19:23] So, God bless you. I pray the Lord will
[2:19:24] bless you richly that you saints will
[2:19:27] move into this authority. I was going to
[2:19:29] read one more. I I'll reserve it another
[2:19:31] time. Okay. Come on now. Now. Now.
[2:19:34] That's an authority. That's a son coming
[2:19:36] to his position right there.
[2:19:39] Oh my. So, God bless you. I'm going to
[2:19:41] close with this one right here. The
[2:19:43] prophet of God says this here. See, in
[2:19:45] your body, inside of you, we got another
[2:19:48] question directly to answer it better.
[2:19:51] Inside of you is a spirit, another man.
[2:19:55] The outside of you is one man. The
[2:19:57] inside of you is another man. So the
[2:20:02] inside of you is the supernatural,
[2:20:05] the outside of you is the physical. See,
[2:20:09] and this being if you are spirit led by
[2:20:13] God, you become a messenger of God or an
[2:20:17] angel, God's messenger. God's angel.
[2:20:22] It's the very same word. Can't separate
[2:20:24] it. God's messenger or God's angel. And
[2:20:27] which has the greatest authority? an
[2:20:30] angel from heaven or an angel at the
[2:20:32] pull pit. Which has it? The angel at the
[2:20:36] pull pit. Paul said, "If an angel from
[2:20:38] heaven comes and preach any other
[2:20:40] gospel, what the this which I've already
[2:20:44] preached, let him be a curse." So the
[2:20:46] angel anointed with the Holy Spirit with
[2:20:48] the word stands next to God. That's
[2:20:53] right. in heaven, his authority.
[2:20:57] All powers in heaven and earth is given
[2:21:00] to my hand. Go and I'll go with you.
[2:21:02] Whatever you bind on earth, I'll bind in
[2:21:04] heaven. Whatever you loose on earth,
[2:21:07] I'll loose in heaven. Oh, if the great
[2:21:09] holy church only realizes power to do
[2:21:13] these things, but there's so much doubt
[2:21:16] and fear and trembling and wondering if
[2:21:19] it will, could it happen? As long as
[2:21:21] that exists, the church can never stand
[2:21:24] upright. And when every talk of fear is
[2:21:27] vanished and the Holy Spirit is
[2:21:28] completely in control
[2:21:31] in control of the church, then all fears
[2:21:34] are gone. And that church has the power.
[2:21:37] See why? They have everything that
[2:21:40] heaven owns behind them. They're
[2:21:43] ambassadors of the throne. Absolutely.
[2:21:46] An ambassador of Christ has the
[2:21:49] authority and everything that Christ
[2:21:52] owns belongs to that ambassador. And he
[2:21:55] said, "Go ye into all the world." You
[2:21:58] are my witnesses after the Holy Ghost
[2:22:00] has come on you. And what is a witness?
[2:22:03] Is an ambassador. It's to come and
[2:22:06] witness something. The whole powers of
[2:22:09] heaven is right in your hands. Oh, why
[2:22:13] do we sit and the church is barren and
[2:22:16] we sit dormant? Is because that we don't
[2:22:20] recognize these things.
[2:22:24] God help us. God help me to recognize
[2:22:29] these things. Lord, you don't have to
[2:22:32] trouble yourself. If you just show me
[2:22:35] the word, if you just say it in the
[2:22:37] word, my servant will live.
[2:22:40] And the Lord says, "Wow, that's great
[2:22:42] faith. That's a great faith. I haven't
[2:22:45] seen that in Israel.
[2:22:48] God help us that I that will be our
[2:22:52] testimony. That would be our faith." God
[2:22:53] bless you. God bless you. Let's pray.
[2:22:56] Musicians, come please. Heavenly Father,
[2:22:59] we thank you for the word this morning.
[2:23:02] We thank you for this time, Lord, to
[2:23:04] minister on these great principles,
[2:23:07] Lord. Thanking you for salvation. Thank
[2:23:10] you for the things you've brought water
[2:23:13] baptism and repentance and all those
[2:23:17] things that you've given to the church.
[2:23:19] But Lori, moving on unto perfection
[2:23:23] each step, each
[2:23:26] round goes higher and higher and Lord
[2:23:29] into the realm where Peter,
[2:23:32] his shadow healed the people. Just his
[2:23:36] shadow. And Lord, what a true church
[2:23:40] we're coming to in this hour. Lord, the
[2:23:43] Ananas and Safhiv will be repeated
[2:23:46] again.
[2:23:47] Lord, you would dwell among your people
[2:23:50] again. The gifts, signs, wonders, and
[2:23:53] miracles will take place in that little
[2:23:57] group that can handle the word and take
[2:24:00] it and believe it. and that one brother,
[2:24:03] that one sister that can handle the word
[2:24:05] and receive it, it will benefit their
[2:24:08] life. I believe that, Lord, with all my
[2:24:10] heart. I believe I want that for my own
[2:24:14] life. I want it for all of the lives
[2:24:18] gathered here, those that are hearing
[2:24:21] the word of the Lord this morning. May
[2:24:23] you grant it, Father,
[2:24:26] the authority
[2:24:28] in Jesus name we pray.
[2:24:31] Amen. God bless you richly. Brother
[2:24:35] John, why don't you come and sing for

[2:33:55] Out on the water,
[2:33:59] storms raging high.
[2:34:03] The waters around them were troubled
[2:34:08] that night.
[2:34:11] And fear filled their hearts
[2:34:15] and they thought they would die.
[2:34:19] They failed to remember
[2:34:23] that the master was nine.
[2:34:28] But he spoke the word
[2:34:31] and the winds all stood still.
[2:34:36] Even the waters
[2:34:39] they oyed his will.
[2:34:44] keep calm their storms
[2:34:48] just like you will mine
[2:34:52] if I'll just remember
[2:34:56] that he lives deep inside.
[2:34:59] Oh, so why should I worry?
[2:35:04] Why should I fear
[2:35:08] when this very same Jesus?
[2:35:12] He stays always near.
[2:35:16] He lives in my heart
[2:35:20] and he hears when I cry.
[2:35:24] I call his name
[2:35:28] till the storm passes by.
[2:35:35] [Music]
[2:35:37] Read in the Bible
[2:35:41] how he walked with them.
[2:35:44] Brought light to their darkness
[2:35:48] when the way seemed so dim.
[2:35:53] How great it would be
[2:35:56] to have a step
[2:35:59] in mind
[2:36:01] and walk with the master
[2:36:05] all of the time. Oh, and when trials
[2:36:11] come
[2:36:13] and just seem so nice,
[2:36:17] I'll just call on the master
[2:36:21] and I will get there on time.
[2:36:26] When sickness comes
[2:36:29] and my body is in pain,
[2:36:33] all we have to do is just call on his
[2:36:39] name.
[2:36:41] So why should we worry?
[2:36:46] Why should we fear?
[2:36:49] When this very sent Jesus,
[2:36:53] he stays always near.
[2:36:57] He lives in my heart
[2:37:01] and he hears when I cry.

[2:37:26] he stays always near.
[2:37:30] He lives in my heart
[2:37:33] and he hears when I cry.

[2:37:42] storm passes.

[2:37:56] &gt;&gt; This is so great that we can call on his
[2:37:59] name

[2:38:04] &gt;&gt; that he hears our call.
[2:38:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:39:07] things. In Jesus name we ask. Amen.
[2:39:10] Amen.

[2:39:23] read in the Bible how we walk with him.
[2:39:26] We read in the Bible
[2:39:30] how he walked with them.
[2:39:34] Brought light to the dark. Aren't you
[2:39:37] glad he's the same yesterday, today, and
[2:39:39] forever?
[2:39:42] How great it would be
[2:39:46] to have his footsteps
[2:39:48] in mind
[2:39:50] and walk with the master
[2:39:54] all of the time. Also, when trials come
[2:40:02] and at this night,
[2:40:06] I'll call the master.
[2:40:09] I know we'll get there in time.
[2:40:14] When sickness comes
[2:40:17] and my body is in pain,
[2:40:22] all I have to do
[2:40:26] is call on his name.
