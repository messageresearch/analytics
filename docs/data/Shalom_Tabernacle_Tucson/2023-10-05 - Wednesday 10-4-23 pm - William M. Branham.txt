other brothers and sisters and so remember him and we'll just expect to hear from Heaven tonight about the unchangeable God I was just telling someone yesterday about our unchanging God how can you have a changing society and culture and things if you have a change unchanging God it's always going to be the same Saints and his people will be the same they'll love to serve him come on a Wednesday

we can call thee Our Father being born of thy Spirit we are thy children and with the privilege of asking what we will and faith will bring it to us we thank thee for this most holy and righteous God we would ask the night that you would speak to those Lord who aren't needy those that need salvation to their souls and for those that are sick and in a desperate condition to the shut-ins those that are in the hospitals in their hospitalized and cannot get to the meeting all thou Great I Am go to their bedsides tonight and touch their sick bodies that they might be able to come from the hospitals to serve thee forgive us of our sins as we forgive those that sin against us that we might have thy favor in our midst tonight speak to us through Thy word Thy word is the truth make it known unto us Lord make Thy word to live among us for we asked it in the name of thy child the Lord Jesus amen thank you now for just to continue the message I was certainly packed away was standing there listening to brother duplicitous bring that message on the Apostle Peter being able to walk on the water something that he never did before and we can just do many things that we never did before if we'll just listen to his word and take his word part he never made a promise but what you'll stand behind now what time does the service start Sunday better Sunday 2 30. well that means about 1 30 those who want prayer cards should be here at 1 30 then so you won't disturb the meetings while they're giving out the prayer cards and at 2 30 the services began and then we'll be out in time for you to go home and have your is it dinner or supper here I'm a southerner and it's supper to me if they call that dinner then what happens in my supper I miss out somewhere so I uh you go home to your supper that's what I would call it and then go to the your churches and the strangers in our gates we want to visiting here these fine churches will be having Sunday school Sunday morning and church Sunday night you find a place of your choice and attend that service and now I'm kindly happy about this meeting for many reasons because I have looked forward to it for some time of getting back I wish the this quote uh verse out of the Book of Job tonight the 23rd chapter and the third verse Oh that I knew where I might find him that I might come even to his seat that's job 23 3. I'm going to speak for a few minutes up on the subject of the unchangeable God if I should call it a subject there are many things and practically all things change time changes people changes weather changes Nations changes but God is in unchangeable he does not change he is the same all times God is an infinite God I do not believe that there would be any word could explain the the word or any way to explain the word infinite because it's the infinite he has never had a beginning or he'll never have an end therefore when God is called on the scene to act or to make a decision the way that he acts are the decision that he makes that is forever the same he cannot change it because he's infinite he's perfect now you and I can say a certain thing and next year we'll have to change it maybe and do something different or because we are finite we we do not know all things but he is perfect and his first decision will have to be his second decision will have to be like the first or if he makes another decision then he did not act right when he made the first decision then that puts him finite like I am or you are what I'm trying to do before this healing service comes is to instill in you of faith in God because that's what it takes for healing our Salvation you must have faith in God and God is no greater than his word are no more perfect than his word because God and His word is the self same thing you are no you're no better than your word God is no better than his word and your word is what you are God's word is what he is now any persons know that if God was called on the scene wants to save a man that was lost and God saved that man by his faith the next man calls on God God will have to save that man if he comes on the same grounds that the first man came on then if there is a sick man and he pleads to God for mercy and God gives him mercy and healing on the basis of his faith the next man that comes on them sane grounds and asks the same question God's got to act the same way or he acted wrong when he acts the first time so you see we must make God real unchangeable Every Soul that comes to God seeking salvation are healing he's got to come on those bases he's got to come believing that God is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek after him did not our lord Jesus say whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them did not he say ask the father what you will in my name you will receive it now that is infallibly the truth and there's nobody that ever asked God anything but what God gave it to them if they come with an honest heart now the thing of it is God gives it sometimes in the way that we're not expecting it but God always keeps his word there's no way for God to tell you anything and lie about it and remain God he cannot he must keep his word forever it's the truth and when the Bible says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that is the truth I may not have faith enough to make all the things that he done live again but I'll never stand in the road of somebody who had faith enough to do it I would be thanking God for that faith but just the same every promise that he made is absolutely truth I can go on record for this tonight if any people will take the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise that God ever made and claim it for yours God will bring it to pass if you'll take the right attitude towards you knowing that it God said so the promise is yours and it your personal property the very minute you receive it that way then it has to come to pass for Jesus said the word is a seed that is sore so and a seed if it's a dermatized seed and it goes into the ground then that seed under the right conditions of the Sun and moisture will bring forth the life that's in the seed and so is the word of God if a person can take that word and place it in their heart and give it the right sunshine the right temperature not Su him but s-o-n and right temperature of faith in there that seed and promise will live to you just like it did at the beginning to the one it was given to you because it's God's word and he is the same yesterday today and forever he cannot fail now the thing is with the people is the way God Appears many times we want to make an idol out of God we ask God to do something and then he must do it just the way that we asked it or we'll say he never answered when we do that we weaken our faith in God and we weaken Our Testimony when we do not take him at his word God always answers no one never asks Jesus said ask and you shall receive seek and you shall find everyone that asks will receive everyone that seek shall find everyone that knocks it'll be open to them now that's the only way that I've always found it that I can get anything from God is taking at his word and believe it the way he sends it now if we do not take it just the way that we think it is we build God as an idol he's got to answer just according to our ways our well it's just no good he didn't answer us God answers in many ways you know answers in Peculiar ways times and everything is odd we'll take Francis Moses Moses was 80 years old he was almost you might think too old for God to deal with he was an old man unexpected in his age to be dealt with with God another thing he was under the mount harm unexpected place God met him at an unexpected age at an unexpected place and an unexpected way God didn't meet Moses the way he usually met man he met Moses in an unusual way in the way that he chose to meet Moses in that's the way he answers our prayer in the way that he thinks his best and his way is always right if we ask for anything and it doesn't happen just the way God or the way we think that God ought to let it happen then that makes us lose and fall back let's ask God stand firm on the word and say it's true in it just receive it the way he stands it that's the way you got to believe God it may come disguise it may come in another way a roundabout way but no matter what way it comes if we have asked we shall receive God said so and that settles it forever if God says so that's good now when you get to taking God like that and believing it now Moses what if he had said I prayed for God to make me a military man and here he is in a burning bush no American Universe how God appeared to him just so he appeared that's all that matters here as long as God comes and answers as long as we recognize it to be God Jacob another character he was caught between two occasions he had done some mean things some sneaking little tricks to his his father-in-law Lebanon and he was running from his father-in-law going back home to Mama and when he come to find out here come his brother that he had done some dirty little tricks to was come and meet him with an army just remember your sins finds you out and then Jacob all Disturbed and perplexed and in trouble set his wives across the Little Brook went back on the other side and an unexpected place and an unexpected time he met God in an unexpected way what a way to meet God in a wrestling match but it was gone regardless of what is in a burning bush or a wrestling match it was gone and the main thing was that Jacob he had had dreams and visions and so forth but this is one time he could lay his hand on something and say it's gone and he was able to hold on to it until the blessing came or if we could do that if we could find a spot to where we could see God whether it's in his word wherever it is and recognizes God and hold on to it until the blessing comes blast it out with God promised to do it God said if we'd seek we'd find us and it shall be given knock it'll be opened every word is true when Jacob got a hold of something and he could look at hold two with his hands and seen that it was God he would not turn it loose oh if christianom could do that if you could lay your hand a hold of something that's real catch a vision of God and see his presence and hold on to it until God sends the answer back and the blessing what a Revival or break up here in Tulsa If people could do that could see the power of the Living God something real no matter what form it comes in we have our ideas but God has a way of sending things to us answering our prayer it's been praying he's going on here in this city for a long time for Revival I believe if we would just open our eyes and be ready to receive it God would send it to us in his way of doing it in his time God would Grant it but we've got to recognize we have asked and if we ask them we shall receive and he held on to it unexpected time unexpected place on an unexpected way but when he realized that it was God he held on to it Isaiah the young prophet he had a wonderful life he leaned upon the good King's arm and everything come finding it got all fat and overweight from eating and one day the king died and Isaiah was caught in a vision when he seen the train of the Lord he saw angels flying to the building Wings over their face and wings over their feet and flying with two Wings crying holy holy holy the Lord God Almighty and when he seen that and knows that he was standing in the presence of a holy God he said woe is needed for I am a man of unclean lips and I'm believing among unclean people and the Lord was crying who will go for us and the angel took the tongs and got some coals off the Altar and touched it to his mouth and cleansed him it was an unusual sight for the prophet is an unusual way that God dealt with him but God knows how to deal with man Isaiah had been educated in at a school with the King and so forth he had the best it could be giving mentally I suppose in his intellectual but God had to make a profit out of him by revealing himself to him by giving him something tangible that he could see it was no more so much in literature and reading and writing but the things that he had read about God and heard about God become manifested right before him then he said I'm of Uncle dealing and doing unclean unclean prepared him for his days of Prophecy that's the way God does things he does it in a mysterious way the Prophet Elijah we might think of him for a moment there he is laying back in a cave he had seen the power of God a few days before that 40 days before he had God's power he had prayed and three years and six months it had not rained and then he prayed again on the mountain and fire came down from heaven and devoured the sacrifice and then he prayed again and rain come and bathe the Earth and then father fear of the threat of the queen he run into the Wilderness he knowed he was missing something there was something in him that wasn't right yet when he pulled back in the cave their common earthquake outside that shook the cave where he was all setting there come a mighty Russian wind there come Thunders and Lightnings and boeings and it was all God but it didn't attract the prophet it didn't touch him somehow he know what God's power was he no God had shut the mountains and he'd had Russian winds and so forth and sent far out of heaven but he waited and weighed down inside of him come a little still voice that attracted the prophet there was something he'd seen his power to do things but this time he felt his presence and a still small voice speaking into his heart then the prophet raised up and went out to the end of the cave sometimes we ask for things get something vice versa we make God something here we want to make an answer the way we think he ought to answer Israel there's another king Israel was looking for a mighty king to come to beat the Romans down with the rod of iron what did God give him a baby instead of a mighty king he gave him a baby wrapped in swaddling cloth said you'll find him laying in a Manger he didn't come the way that they expected him to come and they refused it it has to come our way are so good they said take it back and he did Drive you've got to accept it the way God sends it and be happy about it God anchors a little something in your heart and says this is it believe it hold on to it that's God's word he promised he'd confirm it to you and if he confirms the word hold on to it yeah they didn't want that baby if you can't send us the king well we won't have that baby you can just take it back see it's got to be a way that that we think it's got to be we must remember that God does it his way and his way is always the right way we've got to believe what God said about it and know that it's absolutely the truth and stay with it hold on to it Jesus when you become a man he was humble and how could a king of of the heavens have spit in his face and a rag around his head and hit him with the stick and said say that tell me you're a prophet tell us who hits him we'll believe you and he never opened his mouth how could that be the king that they was looking for was going to beat the world down but God sent him the king and because God sent it in his way then they refused to believe it but God had that way of doing the Senate and he never sent it any other way but what his word said he would come but they had their mind made up it had to be some other way that's where we make the mistake frame that's where the trouble is when the Forerunner John the Baptist King the voice of one crying in the wilderness while the Bible said all the high places will be brought down and all the Low Places will be lifted up and all these things that take place them mountains and Skip like little Rams and the leaves that clap their hands well there's expecting a shaking of this man coming down all the quarters of Heaven all dressed in fine linen and crowns upon his head or something what happened God sent him an old preacher down on the Wilderness with a piece of sheepskin wrapped around look like a fuzzy worm his face all full of beard oh way was such a fellows that eating Locust and wild honey we don't want nothing to do with that how could that poor run the Messiah but it was God's way of pulling the Messiah we've got to receive it in the way that God said it God's pleased with it that's his way he's all wisdom he's all powerful he's omnipotent omnipresent oh he's God the I am not the I was or will be but I am forever the same he's gone and he does things in mysterious ways and but he does it for his own Glory he does it because it hits best to do it that way we must receive it the way that he sends it I'm sure that all of our charts and calendars and so forth that we have drawn up Jesus coming on a cloud and Nixon got him on a white horse and all I get it'll be all together different when he comes it won't be the way that we've got it and many will fail to see it many will fail to see this day that we're living in many it fails to see uh the sign of the coming Messiah right now many people fail to see it they they it's right before them yet they they don't see it Jesus said when he's spoken and Luke I believe it was and he said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man as it was in the days of Noah did you notice how he said the morals of the people in the days of Noah eating drinking marrying giving and marriage but when he said Sodom he just left it all that was the fire that burnt Sodom it's the fire that catches the Earth today let's review that for a few minutes Abraham setting out there not expecting anything he was in the poorest of the land it was In the Heat of the day a odd time for something to happen but he's seen a man come walking three of them something in his heart told him it was God and he held on to it wouldn't let him die oh God made that happen here don't let it pass by hold on to it come in sit down under the oak I'll fetch a little water I'll be a servant to you let me wash your feet I'll bring you more so bread you satisfy your soul then you may go on for this reason my Lord has come to me yet not too sure but he knew that there's something sparked in his heart it must be the time when that man sit and talk to him look what he did he looked down he said Abraham a stranger how do you know his name was Abraham where is thy wife Sarah he knew he had a wife and oh her name was Sarah and the Bible said that Abraham told him in the tent behind you and he said see that Abraham is the heir of the world will I keep anything from Abraham seeing it is the era of the world and he said according to the time of life I'm going to visit it and Sarah 90 years old back in the tent behind him never seen him never know nothing about anything he know about Sarah and she laughed within herself perhaps like that put her hands up to her mouth and this angel with his back turned said why did Cheryl Ash [Music] who was that he little expected that man to be who he was but when he went to leave Abraham call him Elohim God almighty what was the sign of that God Almighty in the form of the Holy Ghost in the last days before this world shall burn he'll come to his people and brought him all these people [Applause] making himself known to his church just before the fire falls just before the destruction of the world Elohim God the holy spirit will come in among these people and do the signs that he did then oh he's the unchangeable god that's the way he made himself known to the Jews that's how he made himself known to the Samaritans the same way many of the Church believe him or he's a Beelzebub but those who seated and recognized it to be God they recognized who he was the woman at the well she said sir Messiah cometh we know and he'll tell us these things you must be his prophet he said I am he that speaks to you she run into the City and said come see a man unexpected she was to find a man like that unexpected expect the Messiah on Earth dwelling so is it today the people don't expect her expecting something else they're expecting bombs and things to fall which probably will be they're expecting some great Union amongst the church people now it may be but in the midst of all of that God has sent the power of His Son Jesus Christ amongst the people and they're having a new Pentecost the power of God being poured out and the same signs and wonders that did many years ago is in the midst of the people as Jesus said it would be we don't look for a unionized among all the churches and things we look for an outpouring of a Holy Ghost and it'll come and do things that that we might not be expecting I know he's here now I know the holy spirit is here in the meeting and I know that he promised wherever two or three are gathered in my uh uh in their together I'll be in their midst Jesus Promised forever two or three that's a power that's uh what the early church relied upon the presence of Jesus wherever two or three are gathered in my name I'll be in their midst and whatever they agree upon is touching one thing and ask they shall receive it that is true that's God's promise he's unchangeable he's the same yesterday today and forever and he's sure now do you believe it let us know our heads just a moment for prayer just before we pray you with your heads bound would there be any here would say brother Branham remember me let my spiritual eyes come open that I might see and know him how I want to see him how I love him raise up your hand and say remember me God bless you Lord bless that's good all right may God Of Heaven to be merciful someone else back over to my right ear remember me brother Brandon prayer God bless you the unsearchable Riches of Christ the revealing of his power and his goodness May the god of heaven give mercy and kindness and grace to you all our heavenly father we bring this audience to you at this hour looking around seeing the hands of the people going up the unchangeable god working in mysterious ways his wonders to perform we pray o God that your Holy Ghost your spirit will dwelling ever heart here tonight give to them the desire of their hearts make them have faith Lord put something within them a courage that they'll know that you're ever present ever living to make intercessions you are sitting at the right hand of God Almighty and there at his throne the precious body of Jesus Christ sits there while the Holy Spirit is on Earth and he's there as our high priest to make intercessions Upon Our confession what we confess that he'll do that's what he's there to make right his own blood and he's in the charger before him his own garments bloody sitting there seeing that God cannot look through that blood and see unrighteousness because Christ has took our sins and our sickness oh Father God we pray that as he being on a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities that he will be touched tonight by ever infirmity that's in the building all the infirmities that whether it be spiritual or physical that they'll have a healing and a Revival will take out of this city oh Souls after Souls into the kingdom of God granted Lord hear our prayer we love you father and we're waiting for great expectations for the Holy Spirit to come in our midst and do that which he promised he would do we asked for their sake in the name of Jesus Christ amen you love him with all your heart are you expecting him to do the exceeding the abundance above all that we could do or to think he said he would do the exceeding abundance above all that we could do our thing he promised to do it now when Jesus is sure on Earth how many knows that he did not claim to be a Healer how many knows that he wasn't a Healer no better than that he said it's not me that doeth the works it's my father that dwelleth in works verily verily I say unto you John 5 19 verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing that doeth the son likewise is that what he said Saint John 5 19 when he knows where a man was laying with an infirmity laying on a pallet told him his faith to make him whole pick up his bed and go to the house and he was questioned amongst the Jews and he left thousands of people laying there lame halt blind Twisted he said I only do what the father tells me or shows me to do I I do want the I see the father doing the father worketh and I worketh hitherto now that's his Spirit now Jesus himself did not perform any healings without first God showing him that's the scripture I do nothing except the father shows me first not tells me shows me first then when he shows him he goes and does what the father tells him the woman had touched His Garment now he never did that he never said he did it he said thy faith has save thee thy faith has save thee blind Barn Emmaus at the gate thy faith has made thee whole he had nothing to do with it the people's Faith did that because they believed that he was the son of God she touched him the woman did and she touched these garment and now he didn't feel it physically because the Palestinian garment has an underneath garment and the robe hangs loose and she touched the border of it for she said within her heart if Alba touch His Garment I'll be made whole and she touched him and when she did while she felt within herself because her faith had been if she could touch it she'll be made well and she did what she thought that would bring the power of God to her and she felt that it was all sufficient and it was because she believed it Jesus turned and looked around the audience he said who touched me Peter rebuked him said who touched you while all of them's touching you why would you say a thing like that he said but I perceive that I have gotten weak or virtues gone from me which means strength I got weak somebody touched me with a different kind of a touch and he looked around over the audience until he found the woman and he's told her about her blood issue had stopped because her faith had made her well now that's the Jesus was yesterday that's the same Jesus today that's the same Jesus there will be tomorrow if there is a tomorrow and we'll be forever when people think that God makes a promise and don't keep it Muhammad's or nothing else I've helped the Bible in one hand the Quran and the other one and say one of them's right and one's wrong both of them can't be right because we're contrary one to another I say you proved that your Prophet is dead he's in the ground our Jesus raised my dead and he promised the things that he did we'll do also I said now let me see you do the works of Mohammad can't do it but the works of Jesus Christ is done by the Holy Ghost when he comes to anoint the people do you believe that certainly We Believe it what would keep us from believing because God made the promise God said so that settles it now man cannot do that it's supernatural it's something that man can't do I've just got a couple of minutes time on to explain that see man cannot do nothing it's God in man Jesus said I am the vine ye are the brains now as long as the branch is in the vine it'll bear the fruit of the Vine now God always used man for his agent that's why he used his own son to unveil himself he come down and took the form of man in order to Die the death for man he could not die in the spirit but he was put to Death In the Flesh then God was in Abraham God was in Isaac God was in Jacob God was in Joseph God was in David he was in all those people back in there them prophets and so forth it was God working through man now in this new testament age the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses his church and sanctifies it that his holy spirit might continue to carry the work of God on through all ages and he's just the same today if it isn't then we're false Witnesses of this Bible if it if that isn't true then the Bible isn't true it's time that man preached the gospel it's time that the power of God was made known when heathens trying to step on that word we need man like the Hebrew children are God is able to Deliver Us from this that's right it's time God Remains the Same now God cannot heal you because he's already done it when he was wounded for your transgressions Bruce for your iniquity the chastisement of your peace upon him and with his stripes you were healed it's a past tense if he stood here tonight with this suit on that he gave me he could not heal you if you asked him he'd say I've already done it you believe it he might do something to make you know that it was him and that's what he does today he makes it known to his people by his people that he is God not the man but God now he's just as real tonight I I know he's here how many ever seen that picture of the Angel of the Lord that line there's many of you they got your thing somewhere boys may have it genome he's got the table back there that light you remember I don't know if I never meet you again in Earth I'll meet you at that day that life isn't standing two feet from where I'm standing now he's right he promised it and I believe God seen it against tens of thousands of heathens I've seen it in times on which doctors on both sides and see the power of God past I haven't set there God's either God or he's not God Jesus either the Son of God or he was an imposter he is Christ the son of God he is not dead but he's alive and he lives forevermore the same yesterday today and forever how many believe that God bless you how many you believe that he can appear right we ain't got no prayer part to get out how many sick out there wants healing raise your hand say God I'm sick I need healing just raise up your hands anybody's sick and wants healing just raise up your hands to say I pray that God will make me well Gotta Love One You're praying for raise up your hand God be

sitting here taking the message man on the platform I met him last night finest bunch of man I ever met in my life but the only ones that I really know personally is brother out there you sponsored me the first time last year brother of Williams and his son brother borders Brother David and brother um Harvey is the only ones I really know here but Jesus Christ knows every one of you if he is the same yesterday today and forever put him to a showdown is he gone is it right he knows every one of you if we are approaching the coming of the Son of God how did he prove himself to be God and to be the Son of God to the Jews when he told Peter who he was he said told Nathanael where you've been when he was under the Fig Tree when he saw him under the tree praying he said Thou Art the Son of God you're the king of Israel that was the sign of the Messiah to the Jewish Nation the priest walked back and said he's a fortune teller and he said you say that it got me I'll forgive you but when the Holy Ghost has come but not speak against it then because it'll never be forgiven and this in this world or the world to come what's that there's only three classes of people that's ham sham and japhethah's people that's Jews Gentile and Samaritans remember Peter Pentecost preached to the Jews open the kingdom do the Samaritans one Philip had one out and baptized them yet they have not received the Holy Ghost now at the house of Cornelius then all of them had heard ham shame and japheth's people the Holy Ghost was then didn't need him anymore for that purpose because the Holy Spirit went to all the people when Jesus come we Gentiles were Anglo-Saxons which did not look Faro coming Messiah we were heathens of clubs on her back but they that was looking for a messiah there was the Jews and the Samaritans looking for the Messiah when he appeared how what kind of a sign did he do he done the sign of the Prophet that Moses spoke of it would be a god Prophet amen they looked at it those who were really spiritual LED they seemed do that sign they said that's him but the others had all their intellectual trainings they said this guy's Beelzebub he went over to Samaria he had need a woman come out of the well and he said then bring me a drink of water and she says not customary we got segregation here Jews and Samaritans have no dealing he said woman if you knew who you were talking to you'd ask me for a drink yes she said the whale's deep you have what was he doing he's contacting her spirit and what he found where her trouble was we all know what it was we're her trouble ain't he said go get your husband to come here she said I don't have any husbands said you said right you got five and the one you're living with now is not your husband she said sir I perceive that you're a blzibar no sir she said I perceive that you're a prophet [Music] I perceive that you are a prophet now we know we know we Samaritans we're taught we know when Messiah cometh he'll tell us these things yes that was the sign of Messiah but who are you he said I'm he that speaks to you [Music] remember not to Gentiles did he ever do it he did not do that to Gentiles then if he's an infinite God and let them with the intellectual teaching as much as we have today if we go into the out of this our dispensation without the same manifestation then he'd done something for them he did not do for us but he's the same yesterday today and forever he promised he would do it what did he do many scriptures but the one who just quoted as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so shall it be the same thing will take place just before the fire there he is the infinite God he's here tonight that's a big thing to say but it's a something that the Bible said so in the Holy Spirit is sure to back it up and say it's the truth let us pray oh Lord there's somebody there suffering no doubt some people are in need I pray thee father to be merciful and just let it be known that thou art God just speak the words Lord and I pray that some poor soul in here that's seeking you that they'll be able to touch the high priest that can be
