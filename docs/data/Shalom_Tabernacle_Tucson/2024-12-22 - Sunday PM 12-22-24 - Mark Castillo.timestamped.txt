[37:33] bless you once again welcome to the
[37:34] house of the Lord I trust you rested I
[37:36] trust you had a good lunch I know I did
[37:39] and it made it a little bit
[37:41] sleepy but that's the the curse of the
[37:43] Mexican food has it puts you to sleep
[37:45] that's why I like eating some chili so
[37:47] can keep me awake but we're glad to be
[37:49] back here once again uh thank you for
[37:51] your patience and for your prayers and
[37:53] if you'll open your Bible with me to the
[37:55] Book of Job 4 and: 17
[37:58] we're going to read one verse from there
[38:00] and then we're going to jump to 1
[38:02] Corinthians chapter 15 and then verse 53
[38:06] and 54 the these are scriptures that are
[38:09] very well known we've been hearing them
[38:12] for for
[38:13] years just like we've been hearing for
[38:15] years Genesis
[38:17] 1:1 in the beginning God
[38:20] created and it goes back to the question
[38:22] why did God create in the beginning
[38:24] because we were on his mind amen you
[38:27] want something for us you know when
[38:29] you're a father and you have children
[38:31] you do all you can for your children
[38:33] whether they deserve it or not we even
[38:35] threaten them you're not getting nothing
[38:38] you're being bad go to your room and
[38:40] then they go to the room we're thinking
[38:42] like man I should have given him his
[38:43] gift you know love my boy I I have that
[38:45] problem with my grandkids right now
[38:47] sometimes I got to give him timeout
[38:48] you're on timeout for how long for five
[38:50] minutes sit down oh why because you're
[38:51] not listening to me I'll listen next
[38:53] time no wait till your time's up and
[38:55] then when the time's up they getting a f
[38:57] fight again another five minutes and I
[38:59] tell you guys don't deserve no more toys
[39:01] from Grandpa but that's a lie because
[39:05] Grandpa got a bunch of toys for and I
[39:07] get SCH why you buying more toys I go
[39:08] because I love them and if if if I can
[39:11] feel like that towards my grandkids what
[39:13] does God feel towards us think about
[39:15] that because his love is greater amen he
[39:18] has so much to give to us the Bible says
[39:20] if you have not it's because you ask not
[39:24] and if you don't ask it's because you
[39:25] don't believe
[39:27] amen you want something from the Lord
[39:29] ask for it believe it but for heaven's
[39:31] Sak be grateful for what you get when he
[39:34] gives it to you Amen in the Book of Job
[39:36] chap 4:1 17 and it reads shall mortal
[39:39] man be more just than God it's a
[39:43] question that's been asked shall mortal
[39:45] man be more just than God shall a man be
[39:49] more pure than his
[39:51] maker and I think it's a good question
[39:53] to ask because a lot of times we think
[39:54] we're
[39:55] somebody you know by me a nice $4,000
[39:58] suit and I'm somebody nice Gucci shoes
[40:01] not that I ever buy those shoes I get M
[40:04] get Walmart or Coal's but we we think
[40:06] we're somebody but the question is are
[40:08] you really
[40:09] somebody without the Lord amen and then
[40:12] let's jump to 1 Corinthians chapter
[40:14] 15:53 a very well-known scripture 1
[40:18] Corinthians
[40:20] 1553 and it reads for this corruption
[40:25] must put on incorruption
[40:28] what are we right now
[40:30] corruption I don't care how much
[40:32] vegetables you eat and try to stay young
[40:36] how much lotion you put on that Jurgens
[40:38] you know Reviving skin lies you're still
[40:43] corruption you're still going to die
[40:45] church I know that sounds like bad news
[40:47] but wake up we're dying church because
[40:50] this corruption must put on
[40:52] incorruption and this Mortal must put on
[40:56] immortality
[40:58] so when the corruptable shall have put
[41:00] on incorruption and this Mortal shall
[41:03] have put on
[41:04] immortality then shall be brought to
[41:07] pass the saying that is written death is
[41:10] swallowed up in Victory can I get an
[41:13] amen Church death is swallowed up in
[41:17] Victory one more scripture Ephesians
[41:20] chapter 4 verse
[41:24] 4 when when when I when I when I speak
[41:26] of the church I have a a tendency to
[41:29] keep the church standing for a while and
[41:32] it's it's it's not on on purpose but my
[41:35] dad used to sco me say boy read your
[41:37] scripture and sit the people down they
[41:40] get tired too you know I go Dad I go I
[41:42] got to stop the whole sermon I ain't
[41:44] complaining well read your scripture sit
[41:46] them down so let's read this and you can
[41:47] sit down real quick Ephesians 4 verse4
[41:50] and it reads there is one body and one
[41:53] Spirit even as ye are called in one hope
[41:57] of of your calling one Lord One Faith
[42:01] one baptism one God and Father of all
[42:05] who is above all and through all and in
[42:10] you
[42:11] all but unto every one of us is given a
[42:15] Grace according to the measure of the
[42:18] gift of Christ wherefore he sath when I
[42:22] when he ascended unto on high he let
[42:25] captivity captivity cap
[42:27] and gave gifts unto men amen Heavenly
[42:31] Father your word is blessed thank you
[42:33] Lord for your word father a a soul that
[42:36] is that is weary Lord that feels maybe
[42:39] heavy laden from the PRS of the life
[42:41] father when he picks up your word and he
[42:43] reads it he can find comfort in your
[42:45] word to know that this was written way
[42:48] before he even came to the Earth and it
[42:50] Comforts us father it stir our souls
[42:52] Lord as your word should stir our souls
[42:54] this evening father we commit ourselves
[42:56] into your hands Lord in this Church in
[42:57] this service and we give you all the
[42:59] honor and the glory in the precious name
[43:01] of Jesus Christ amen God bless you now
[43:04] you may be
[43:05] seated I believe that one of the
[43:07] greatest gifts that man has is to be
[43:08] able to pick free choice uh the prophet
[43:12] calls it free moral agency that means
[43:14] that that you as a human being can pick
[43:15] whatever you want you could have picked
[43:17] to stay home this evening and say you
[43:19] know brother castil tired me out in the
[43:20] morning I'm going to rest it out for the
[43:22] evening that's your choice and and not
[43:24] I'm not going to condemn you for that
[43:26] because that's your choice you do
[43:27] whatever you want amen uh I I I uh when
[43:31] I took over the pastorship my father was
[43:33] one who never liked preaching about ties
[43:34] and offering because he felt if I preach
[43:37] about ties the people are going to think
[43:38] I want your money but since I was a
[43:41] pastor I preached about ties because I
[43:42] never got nothing
[43:44] anyways I had my own job so I preached
[43:46] about it because to me I believe that
[43:48] paying tithe is important I'm not sure
[43:50] why I'm going down this road but tithing
[43:52] is important and so when I became the
[43:54] pastor you
[43:56] know I kept on preaching ties and
[43:58] offering because to me the church runs
[44:02] on the offerings of the people we we are
[44:04] not funded by the
[44:06] government I mean the church didn't get
[44:09] us stimulus check but you all did and I
[44:12] ask the Church of you all you that God
[44:13] has stimulat checks how many of you paid
[44:15] tithings from that please don't raise
[44:17] your
[44:18] hand because it's a blessing from the
[44:20] Lord yes it's the devil's money hello
[44:24] this the devil's world but who doesn't
[44:27] need money nowadays and there's nothing
[44:29] wrong with money it's the love of money
[44:32] and so I I I've tried to instill in our
[44:34] church that it's okay to give offerings
[44:37] because we can go to Walmart and spend
[44:39] 250 on stuff that's on sale and then we
[44:43] come to church and we got $5 bill and a
[44:46] 20 and we'll put the
[44:48] five oh how do I know I see it I'm on
[44:53] the P I see people put offering there I
[44:54] see some that don't put it they have a
[44:56] good job and they don't put offering and
[44:58] the ones that that are barely making it
[44:59] like the elderly women give all they can
[45:02] give to the Lord I at women that have
[45:04] been there for years elderly women
[45:06] faithful with their tithings amen it's
[45:10] because they they they have a revelation
[45:12] and they choose because they love the
[45:14] Lord and so they express with their
[45:15] actions that they love the
[45:17] Lord because those that don't pay
[45:19] tithings are considered what thieves
[45:23] before the eyes of God when when my dad
[45:26] was a pastor he he would tell me his
[45:28] assistant son I want you to go check all
[45:30] the men all the musicians and find out
[45:32] who's paying tithe and who's not and the
[45:34] ones that aren't sit him down and I'm
[45:37] thinking wait wait I'm not the pastor
[45:39] I'm the assistant pastor but that was my
[45:41] job you know what I wasn't very popular
[45:44] amongst the N amongst the non tithing
[45:47] musicians why because they had to sit
[45:49] down why am I sitting down brother you
[45:51] know already the Bible says and then the
[45:53] pastor says brother says that you can't
[45:55] pay you got to sit down
[45:57] well want to catch up but when you do
[45:59] you can play right now you got to sit
[46:01] down and they didn't like me for that
[46:03] but you know that was a choice we have
[46:05] we we can either give or not give we can
[46:07] come to church and we can praise or not
[46:10] praise right right that's your choice
[46:13] you know that that but you'll have to
[46:15] answer for it one day you can choose to
[46:17] go to work or not go to work that that's
[46:20] the beauty of of of a of a free moral
[46:23] agency we can choose amen but a child of
[46:27] God who has a fire in his soul that's L
[46:30] hungering for more of God his choice is
[46:32] always going to be to want more of God
[46:35] he's always going to want to be more in
[46:36] the presence of God to me the most
[46:38] beautiful presence is to be in the
[46:40] presence of God to feel the anointing
[46:42] church because that tells me that that
[46:44] when I can feel his anointing I'm a
[46:47] nobody brother they they say that real
[46:49] men don't cry that's a big
[46:52] lie I have I have no problem crying when
[46:54] the Lord touches me if it offend you
[46:57] that's your problem you know if I want
[47:00] to cry in the presence of the Lord I'm
[47:01] going to cry you know Jesus cried
[47:05] because they rejected him we should be
[47:07] crying because he accepted us gave us
[47:11] Hope G gave us freedom gave us the
[47:13] opportunity to to hear this message you
[47:15] know when we first came into the message
[47:17] there there was a burning in the in the
[47:18] air of excitement because they had
[47:20] received a
[47:21] message when I when I was young I
[47:23] remember that that the church had so
[47:25] much Unity you'd go from place to place
[47:27] and they were always on fire they were
[47:29] always talking about the prophet that
[47:30] was the topic of the conversation the
[47:32] Prophet this oh you what the prophet
[47:33] said oh wow what the prophet said and
[47:37] people were on fire you know because the
[47:38] message had come to the ears it had
[47:40] stirred their souls it was something to
[47:42] make a noise about
[47:44] church but you know as the years passed
[47:47] by okay that that that that joy that
[47:50] that fire it it
[47:52] dwindled you know it it's still there
[47:55] I'm not saying it's it's still there but
[47:56] it's is not burning like it should be
[47:58] burning in our souls because the more
[48:01] that we are in this message the more
[48:04] that we're serving the lord should we be
[48:05] that much closer to him that's right
[48:07] should there be a change in our lives
[48:09] you know should there be a joy you know
[48:12] sometimes we should we should be coming
[48:13] to church with a little kicking us
[48:14] because we're happy to be in the house
[48:15] of God instead of coming to church
[48:17] dragging our feet making
[48:21] dust CU I I see I I see people when when
[48:23] they come to church cuz I see on the
[48:25] pulpit when they come in and I watch
[48:26] them come in I'm thinking huh wonder
[48:28] what happened to him he ain't
[48:30] smiling one day I told the church you
[48:32] know as a pastor I know all your
[48:36] problems I know what you're going
[48:37] through I know what you're going through
[48:38] I know what you what you're going
[48:39] through I know what you're all going
[48:40] through you all got problems including
[48:44] me but if you're serving the lord should
[48:47] those problems be to a side at least for
[48:50] two hours right can can we give the Lord
[48:53] at least two hours of our time you know
[48:55] instead of dragging a the house rents
[48:57] due tomorrow
[48:59] oh and we're trying to figure out how to
[49:01] solve it during church while God's
[49:02] preaching his
[49:04] word but that's your choice if I want to
[49:07] think about my home and I come to church
[49:08] that's my choice I'll do it but a child
[49:11] of God when he's on fire for the Lord
[49:12] he'll put those things to his side and
[49:15] he'll focus on the Lord and he'll
[49:16] realize hey when I get to the end of my
[49:18] journey I Want to Be Right amen I want
[49:21] my ticket now I don't want to be
[49:22] scrambling last minut trying to buy a
[49:23] ticket to Cross Jordan I want my ticket
[49:26] right now Church
[49:27] and so he strives to get close to God
[49:30] are we perfect no
[49:32] sir we're not perfect we make mistakes
[49:35] like I said this morning even brother
[49:37] Bram said that many times I Tred upon
[49:39] God's grace you know because we we're
[49:41] human beings church we we make mistakes
[49:43] we get sleepy in church I know that
[49:45] because I see
[49:47] them I tell people the most safest place
[49:49] in the world is in the
[49:51] church because we come in here there's a
[49:53] beautiful sweet anointing the music
[49:56] compl and we close our eyes Oh Glory to
[49:58] God this feels like
[50:02] heaven

[50:09] robbing it's a blessing yes and we

[50:59] your soul to reflect on your spirit and
[51:01] your life it's the time to to reflect on

[54:07] be a good daughter my mother-in-law when
[54:10] she came into the message she testified
[54:12] to a lot of people about this message
[54:14] like wow what what a woman ain't afraid
[54:17] to to to show other or give others you
[54:19] know that God sent a prophet in this
[54:21] last
[54:22] hour to these days she's still alive
[54:24] still serving the lord but it's one of
[54:26] the greatest gifts that we have is to be
[54:28] able to pick in life
[54:32] amen sometimes the choices that we make
[54:35] there's a price attached to it whether
[54:38] it's a good choice or a bad choice you
[54:41] know growing up in the house of a of a
[54:43] pastor uh we we're know we're known as
[54:45] PKS Pastor
[54:47] kids and PKS are not perfect but we live
[54:51] in the glass house and we were used as
[54:53] the example in the
[54:54] church and you know I was still home at
[54:57] 21 22 I'm still living at home because
[54:59] my dad told me Mi as long as you abide
[55:02] by my
[55:03] rules you can live in my
[55:06] house you you you you got to be home by
[55:08] 10:00 every night I don't care how old
[55:10] you are those are my rules in my house
[55:12] and if you don't like it there's the
[55:13] door me right there go find you a house
[55:15] somewhere else you think I lived no way
[55:18] free
[55:19] rent food was cooked my mama washed my
[55:22] clothes who's going to want to leave the
[55:24] house and and one day my dad he he went

[59:11] and we paid a price and we might have
[59:13] thought that was mean to us but he
[59:15] wasn't mean he loved us amen like
[59:18] sometimes we think God is punishing me
[59:20] no God loves you church but sometimes
[59:22] the choices that we make got to pay a
[59:24] price for it amen you know I heard a
[59:26] brother say all I want to hear when I
[59:29] get to heaven is those words from my
[59:31] father that says Son Well Done well
[59:36] would that be awesome that you know all
[59:38] the struggles in life and brother when
[59:39] you finally get there that Jesus will
[59:41] tell you Son Well Done enter to the joy
[59:46] of your
[59:47] lord I like what brother brandham says I
[59:50] like to read quotes from brother Brandon
[59:52] because that's that's the only place I
[59:54] can pull them from is from brother
[59:54] Brandon the message so one day somebody
[59:57] criticized me mother Castillo you sure
[59:59] read a lot of quotes brother like
[1:00:00] brother I go where am I supposed to get
[1:00:01] my message from if I don't read
[1:00:03] quotes that's why God sent the prophet
[1:00:05] so we can quote to us what he said cuz
[1:00:09] sometimes we forget what he says and we
[1:00:11] need to be reminded of what he said you
[1:00:14] know uh uh we we we I preach to the
[1:00:17] church you about all these things you
[1:00:18] know and sometimes they say Amen
[1:00:20] sometimes they don't and one day a
[1:00:22] minister came and preached the same
[1:00:24] thing and the people were like wow am
[1:00:26] man and man glory to God and they're
[1:00:29] like brother that was awesome I go I
[1:00:30] know it was cuz I preached the same
[1:00:31] thing last week and nobody said
[1:00:33] nothing why you don't pay attention in
[1:00:36] church that's why it's good sometimes to
[1:00:38] have a visiting minister to come and
[1:00:41] remind
[1:00:42] you what your pastors already
[1:00:44] said anyways this is what the prophet
[1:00:47] says he says in the message early
[1:00:50] spiritual experiences preached in
[1:00:54] 1952 he says I've never been ashamed and
[1:00:57] God helped me to always be man enough
[1:01:02] okay to stand up and speak my
[1:01:06] convictions you know at work not that
[1:01:08] I'm religious but people knew who I was
[1:01:10] at work and when they would start to say
[1:01:12] a dirty joke they would stop and they
[1:01:14] say oh sorry bro I didn't mean to say it
[1:01:17] I never complained I never said hey hey
[1:01:20] I'm religious I don't want to hear those
[1:01:21] things never they knew already who I was
[1:01:24] and they respected me for that and
[1:01:26] brother BR says I'm not afraid to speak
[1:01:28] my
[1:01:29] convictions if I'm
[1:01:34] not I'd be a traitor to Christ a traitor
[1:01:38] I believe in the old-fashioned baptizing
[1:01:41] of the Holy
[1:01:42] Ghost I believe that a man's got to be
[1:01:44] born again or he's still a
[1:01:48] sinner you know a lot of times today we
[1:01:50] don't speak about being boring enough we
[1:01:51] try to speak about the Mysteries and
[1:01:53] there nothing wrong with the Mysteries
[1:01:55] we need those there's nothing wrong with
[1:01:56] the Seven Seals we need that but what
[1:01:59] good does it have to have all this
[1:02:00] knowledge of the Seven Seals and be able
[1:02:02] to quote all the message if we still
[1:02:04] haven't been Born Again Church the most
[1:02:07] important thing that we've got to be
[1:02:08] born
[1:02:11] again it's the choice you
[1:02:13] have you know whether you want it or not
[1:02:16] that's up to
[1:02:17] you I believe that a man's got to be
[1:02:19] born again or he's still a sinner I
[1:02:21] believe it's only through the grace of
[1:02:23] God that he's called of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:26] we do not receive the Holy Ghost by
[1:02:27] faith believing it's the free gift of
[1:02:31] God given to us by God's
[1:02:35] grace that's where I different with my
[1:02:38] own church the church that I come from
[1:02:40] the Baptist Church they said you said
[1:02:43] you receive the Holy Ghost when you
[1:02:45] believe I said that's contrary to the
[1:02:48] Bible amen Paul said in Acts 19 he asked
[1:02:53] those Baptist up there that was
[1:02:55] following a PA us he said have you
[1:02:58] received the Holy Ghost since ye
[1:03:01] believed not when you believe but since
[1:03:04] you have believed you believe First and
[1:03:07] the Holy Ghost is the gift of God see it
[1:03:09] comes to
[1:03:11] you there is one Spirit as you read in
[1:03:15] the verse one Spirit one Lord one
[1:03:17] baptism uh one one day I ran to some
[1:03:19] friends at a restaurant and they were
[1:03:22] catholic friends and she she happened to
[1:03:25] mention in front of her husband she goes
[1:03:26] you know I'm not very happy with the
[1:03:28] church right now I go what's wrong she
[1:03:30] goes well she goes I don't believe that
[1:03:32] I should have to confess to a man I'm
[1:03:34] like well praise the Lord neither do I I
[1:03:37] go as a matter of fact I told you the
[1:03:38] Bible says that there's only only one
[1:03:41] interceded between God and man and that
[1:03:43] is Jesus Christ that is who we confess
[1:03:45] our sins to and she said I like that I
[1:03:48] go what's in the word of God he said
[1:03:50] it and then you invite him to church oh
[1:03:53] we want to go we want to go but they
[1:03:54] never show up no
[1:03:57] what can you
[1:03:58] do baham says the body of Christ Jesus
[1:04:01] Christ is not an
[1:04:04] organization the body of Jesus Christ is
[1:04:07] a mystical body it is a body of in the
[1:04:11] Kingdom that's a spiritual Kingdom
[1:04:14] that's set upon the Earth by Jesus
[1:04:16] Christ who is the king of that Kingdom
[1:04:20] the high priest to offer sacrifices for
[1:04:22] the warfaring in his kingdom he's a
[1:04:26] prophet he's the word that preaches the
[1:04:30] truth that brings the light of God in
[1:04:32] this Kingdom and he is both Prophet
[1:04:35] priest and King in this Kingdom and how
[1:04:39] do we get into this Kingdom by the
[1:04:42] denomination by a letter by hand shaking
[1:04:46] by one Spirit we're all baptized into
[1:04:49] one body which is the mystical body of
[1:04:52] Jesus Christ and were baptized in there
[1:04:55] not by
[1:04:56] not by sprinkling not by pouring not by
[1:04:58] any kind of of of water baptism but by
[1:05:01] one Spirit the Holy Spirit we're all
[1:05:03] baptized into that body 1 Corinthians
[1:05:07] 12 yes we are baptized into this body by
[1:05:11] one Spirit the Holy Spirit then we're
[1:05:13] then we're don't belong to anything but
[1:05:16] Christ you are Christ you belong to him
[1:05:19] it's the mystical kingdom of God that's
[1:05:21] set up that we come into it by Holy
[1:05:22] Spirit baptism and brother Bram says at
[1:05:24] the end I love that he says you know
[1:05:28] when something's good you say that's
[1:05:30] good that's right and B says oh I just
[1:05:32] love
[1:05:35] that look at the importance Church of
[1:05:38] having to know what we're talking about
[1:05:41] and knowing god and his word and being
[1:05:43] able to take God at his word how
[1:05:45] important it is for the church to know
[1:05:47] their message know your
[1:05:49] scripture uh we've had ministers that
[1:05:52] have come to our church to preach before
[1:05:53] in the past that come out with some
[1:05:54] weird things
[1:05:56] and I had to interpret for some of them
[1:05:58] and I am so glad that when he says that
[1:06:01] nobody says amen I'm thinking
[1:06:04] yeah someone's being paying attention to
[1:06:06] this church cuz if someone would have
[1:06:08] said amen I would have gone who said
[1:06:09] amen that but they they they know that
[1:06:11] there script because we we've instilled
[1:06:13] into them you better know your
[1:06:15] message you better know where you're
[1:06:16] standing you better know who Jesus is
[1:06:19] because it's not an intellectual Faith
[1:06:21] it's a revelation amen but look at the
[1:06:24] the importance of of having a strong
[1:06:26] Foundation of having a sound Doctrine
[1:06:28] I'm I'm going to tell you a story but I
[1:06:31] don't want nobody to say Amen just
[1:06:32] listen to my story okay just just listen
[1:06:35] to
[1:06:35] it what if one day I have a vision how
[1:06:40] many believe in
[1:06:41] Visions dreams I believe dreams are very
[1:06:44] spiritual I love to have a spiritual
[1:06:45] dream I've had spiritual dreams where in
[1:06:48] the dream itself I feel anointed I feel
[1:06:51] good and I wake up happy because I I I I
[1:06:53] played the piano in the dream inspired
[1:06:56] I was awesome I don't know how to play
[1:06:58] it but in the dream I sounded really
[1:07:01] good it was inspired not thought why
[1:07:04] that that was that was an inspired dream
[1:07:06] I sang a song that I never sang before
[1:07:07] it was inspired and I wake up wow that's
[1:07:09] beautiful that even in my dream God
[1:07:12] blesses
[1:07:13] me you don't have to but he
[1:07:16] does and what if I told that I had a
[1:07:18] vision and in this Vision I saw Jesus
[1:07:20] Christ standing before me in all his
[1:07:22] glory with his crown and angels all
[1:07:24] around him and he tells me me my
[1:07:26] son my son I have a job for you to do I
[1:07:31] want you to go over there and I want you
[1:07:32] to preach my my word I want to go and
[1:07:34] preach over here I want you to do this
[1:07:36] over there I want you to do that over
[1:07:37] there and do it for the honor and glory
[1:07:40] and and I feel so anointed I can feel
[1:07:41] the presence of God that the hairs of my
[1:07:43] arms are sticking up like wow this is
[1:07:45] awesome because you know the presence of
[1:07:47] God if unless you're dead you'll
[1:07:50] recognize it that's right is it possible
[1:07:54] to not feel the presence of God God even
[1:07:56] if you're back sliding you can still
[1:07:57] feel it because the rain falls in the
[1:08:00] just and the unjust am even the devil
[1:08:04] trembles at the sound of the name of
[1:08:06] Jesus you imagine that's how powerful
[1:08:08] Jesus is and what if I told you this
[1:08:10] dream was so awesome and I could hear
[1:08:12] all the angels singing and all the glory
[1:08:14] and I like wow what a beautiful dream
[1:08:18] Church how how many believe it everybody
[1:08:20] would say
[1:08:21] Amen beautiful it's a dream
[1:08:25] but if you know your scripture you know
[1:08:28] there's something wrong with the dream
[1:08:30] look what brother brandham says he says
[1:08:32] I believe that the church today only in
[1:08:34] this Condition it's only a place that
[1:08:36] God's bringing the church that when it
[1:08:38] all breaks what a time of
[1:08:41] rejoicing when the redeemed shall stand
[1:08:44] one day to Crown Jesus that's right yes
[1:08:49] sir you know many people that don't read
[1:08:51] their Bible if Jesus was to appear to
[1:08:53] them in the crown they'd probably
[1:08:54] believe it
[1:08:56] but if you're a Son of God you know wait
[1:08:58] a minute why is he wearing a crown we
[1:09:00] haven't crowned him
[1:09:02] yet and he says will crown him king of
[1:09:05] King and Lord of lords when he's seting
[1:09:07] on Mount Zion and all around the earth
[1:09:10] is circled with the Redeeming the
[1:09:13] redeemed singing of
[1:09:16] redemption the angels will stand a far
[1:09:18] off with their heads bowed yes these are
[1:09:22] angels that have never known sin that
[1:09:24] have never know what what it is to be
[1:09:25] redeemed but they'll be to a side where
[1:09:27] their heads
[1:09:29] bowed you know I can only imagine what
[1:09:32] heaven would be like church for Satan to
[1:09:35] want the glory that God had he wanted
[1:09:37] that Glory as well what did he do he
[1:09:39] took two-thirds of the angel trying to
[1:09:42] seek That Glory that he saw there
[1:09:44] because it's so awesome what what what
[1:09:45] it is to be in the presence of God
[1:09:47] brother if just feeling his presence
[1:09:49] here is glorious what will it be when we
[1:09:52] stand before him and we crown him King
[1:09:54] of Kings yes brother there won't be a
[1:09:56] dry eye there there won't be a shut
[1:09:58] mouth there we'll all be praising in his
[1:10:02] name I qu I can't understand why we
[1:10:04] can't do it here on
[1:10:05] Earth I said I had a bad day and is that
[1:10:08] God's
[1:10:09] fault I got pulled over speeding is that
[1:10:11] God's fault that's your
[1:10:14] fault and he says when he sitting on
[1:10:17] Mount Zion and all around the earth is
[1:10:18] circled with the redeemed singing of
[1:10:22] redemption the angels will stand off on
[1:10:25] the sideline with their heads bowed they
[1:10:26] won't understand he
[1:10:28] says they've never been
[1:10:31] redeemed they never fa to be redeemed
[1:10:34] only we Mortals know what it meant to be
[1:10:38] lost an angel doesn't know what it means
[1:10:40] to be lost and we are the only ones that
[1:10:42] can get joy out of singing the song of
[1:10:48] redemption and I think that's the way
[1:10:51] it'll be in the church
[1:10:55] now the question is what is Immortal one
[1:10:58] day I told the church I'm going to give
[1:11:00] you a definition of what a Jew is but
[1:11:02] don't get shook up it's a very deep
[1:11:04] Revelation what is a Jew a Jew is
[1:11:06] someone who's not a
[1:11:08] gentile and they're like wow that's
[1:11:10] pretty
[1:11:11] deep that's deep what what is a mortal
[1:11:15] what does mortal mean the definition of
[1:11:17] mortal is something that's likely to
[1:11:20] cause
[1:11:22] death oh how scary death you know the
[1:11:25] man you were born you're
[1:11:28] dying you know when when we're young we
[1:11:30] don't think about death because we're
[1:11:31] strong we can get up we can run we have
[1:11:33] a good memory we don't need glasses we
[1:11:35] don't need hearing aades we don't even
[1:11:37] need benay we're we're strong you know
[1:11:40] but the time passes by we you know start
[1:11:42] to squint you know in class what's wrong
[1:11:44] I'm going blind can't hear well some of
[1:11:47] us have selective hearing but hearing
[1:11:49] lost you know and then we get you know
[1:11:51] get to a place where we we can't move
[1:11:53] everything hurts why we're dying Church
[1:11:56] we're dying every day we're dying you
[1:11:58] know and my my my family always tell me
[1:11:59] dad you don't need enough vegetables I
[1:12:01] go Mi I am up to here with
[1:12:03] vegetables give me something that like
[1:12:05] gardet with with green chili or
[1:12:07] something give me some good tortilla
[1:12:08] something but
[1:12:10] vegetables they're killing
[1:12:12] me mortal is someone that's likely to
[1:12:14] cause death or someone that has the
[1:12:16] ability to die every one of us as
[1:12:18] Mortals has the ability to die and we
[1:12:21] will die one day sooner or later some of
[1:12:23] us will still be around when the coming
[1:12:25] of the Lord comes and we'll see him will
[1:12:27] be alive to to greet him but others will
[1:12:29] be called from the dead if you're a
[1:12:31] child of God and your name is called
[1:12:32] brother you'll rais from the dead to be
[1:12:35] in the
[1:12:37] Rapture I don't care if they they they
[1:12:39] sprinkle Dr I'll cross Hawaii when your
[1:12:41] name is called I will be there amen
[1:12:44] that's the that's the promise that we
[1:12:45] have if our creator if our founder rose
[1:12:48] from the dead how much more will these
[1:12:49] children not raised from the dead also
[1:12:51] who have Christ Living in them who've
[1:12:52] been born again if you refer to the fact
[1:12:55] that people are mortal you mean that
[1:12:58] they only have to die and cannot live
[1:13:00] forever this is man's definition that
[1:13:02] you cannot live forever as a
[1:13:04] mortal man is deliberately designed to
[1:13:07] be mortal he grows he ages and then he
[1:13:09] dies a moral which is us we are driven
[1:13:12] by desires and feelings we have five
[1:13:17] senses and those senses tells when we're
[1:13:19] sick it hurts and when we hear the word
[1:13:22] of God that says your faith can heal you
[1:13:24] we say Amen to that but then our body
[1:13:28] tells us but I still feel the pain it
[1:13:31] hurts it's like a
[1:13:33] headache when I rebuke a headache I say
[1:13:36] devil you're a
[1:13:37] liar you know what happens the headache
[1:13:39] gets more
[1:13:41] intense and I'm thinking wait a minute I
[1:13:43] just said the name of Jesus what's going
[1:13:45] on here well the devil has a job and
[1:13:47] that's to discourage you but if you
[1:13:49] stand on the word of God that
[1:13:50] discourages the
[1:13:52] Devil Immortal is d by desires and
[1:13:55] feelings you know we choose whatever we
[1:13:58] want one day I was working in my shop
[1:14:01] and I got the craving for a Big
[1:14:03] Mac now McDonald's is about 8 miles from
[1:14:07] my house what did I have to do I had to
[1:14:09] shut down the shop jump in my truck and
[1:14:12] drive eight miles to McDonald's because
[1:14:14] I was craving that because this Mortal
[1:14:18] wanted a Big Mac and nothing was going
[1:14:20] to stop me now Big Macs are not good for
[1:14:23] you they're they're they're hazardous to
[1:14:25] Health but I was craving one so I drove
[1:14:28] 8 miles to McDonald's I was happy W I'm
[1:14:30] going to have a McDonald's I pulled up
[1:14:31] get my hamburger and I ate it in the
[1:14:33] parking lot cuz I don't like cold
[1:14:34] McDonald's I sat there I prayed for my
[1:14:36] food yes I prayed for my food I said
[1:14:38] thank you Jesus for this Big Mac for
[1:14:40] this golden fries with cold Coke thank
[1:14:42] you Jesus and I ate it and I was happy
[1:14:46] wrapped on my trash went in the trash D
[1:14:48] my truck went back home8 8 Miles back to
[1:14:51] the house thought to myself wow I that's
[1:14:55] choice I can do whatever I want if I'm
[1:14:57] hungry I'll I'll I'll satisfy my hung my
[1:14:59] physical hungry but but but then I begin
[1:15:01] to wonder why is it so difficult for the
[1:15:05] spiritual man to be the same way too
[1:15:08] because you don't have to drive eight
[1:15:10] miles you just got to Fall on Your
[1:15:12] Knees you got to say Lord I'm
[1:15:16] hungry amen for more of
[1:15:19] you I need you every day I I I can't
[1:15:24] live with without you have you ever been
[1:15:26] to a part where you can't live without
[1:15:27] somebody you know what blows me away is
[1:15:30] that when we first fall in
[1:15:32] love amen let's go down memory lane
[1:15:35] young men when you first fall in love
[1:15:38] there's
[1:15:39] nothing that can separate us from going
[1:15:41] to see our girlfriend at their house

[1:15:48] buying her flowers and there's that
[1:15:49] first love you know back back in my day
[1:15:50] we didn't have cell phones so I would

[1:15:54] windshield

[1:15:58] was my cell phone piece of

[1:18:17] life when you're
[1:18:19] small you know enjoy
[1:18:21] it but that Joy with with with time it
[1:18:25] it begins to get squished
[1:18:27] out now you come to church and now you
[1:18:29] got a job now you got Mustang payment
[1:18:33] like four something a month plus
[1:18:34] Insurance gas oh my God and then then
[1:18:36] they got to repair and buy new tires and
[1:18:38] you come to church and and that joy that
[1:18:40] you once had for serving the lord it's
[1:18:42] being
[1:18:44] squashed by a
[1:18:47] Mustang
[1:18:48] hello you know when I first got my car I
[1:18:51] didn't like nobody eating in my car cuz
[1:18:54] I don't like the smell of burgers in my

[1:19:04] up but as the time pass by you allow
[1:19:07] somebody to bring a Coca-Cola you know
[1:19:09] Hamburg after a while after after months
[1:19:11] there's dried french fries under the
[1:19:12] seat nobody cares anymore about the car
[1:19:14] because you've lost that joy of the new
[1:19:16] car and it's it's just a car you know
[1:19:18] still paying for it but it's still a
[1:19:21] car and serving the lord it's like that
[1:19:24] sometimes oh my when you first come to
[1:19:26] the house when you first when we first
[1:19:27] got our church and and and and and I'm
[1:19:29] glad that you all got are getting a new
[1:19:30] church brother there's no place like
[1:19:31] having your own
[1:19:33] place respect it take pride in your
[1:19:36] church it's it's the house of the Lord
[1:19:38] when you dedicate it dedicate to the
[1:19:40] Lord that one day that you'll be truly
[1:19:43] blessed in your own place it's okay to
[1:19:45] live in another tent but you have you
[1:19:46] need to have your own tent instead God
[1:19:49] bless you for that take pride in your
[1:19:51] church it's your it's your home it's a
[1:19:53] place you've dedicated to the Lord this
[1:19:54] is is your place and and after a while
[1:19:56] when when when when that Joy begins to
[1:19:58] dwindle after a while church
[1:20:01] becomes
[1:20:03] chore when people complain why are we
[1:20:05] having church again you know that bugs
[1:20:08] me you know why why are we having
[1:20:10] convention to again it's a lot of work
[1:20:11] and I'm like good
[1:20:13] lordy what you complaining about did you
[1:20:16] ever see Jesus complaining when he was
[1:20:18] carrying the cross why they got to carry
[1:20:19] the cross for you in
[1:20:21] great I already know how what what you g
[1:20:23] to do I already know what you think I
[1:20:24] already know how you going to live why
[1:20:25] am I carrying the cross for you you're
[1:20:28] ungrateful not even his own disciples
[1:20:30] recognized who was walking in their
[1:20:32] midst and for three and a half years
[1:20:34] they walk with the Son of God the the
[1:20:36] the Creator the king of kings and they
[1:20:38] didn't realize why they didn't have a
[1:20:40] revelation they hadn't been born
[1:20:43] again and with time passes by that that
[1:20:45] Joy begins to get crushed after a while
[1:20:48] the same quote you heard 10 years ago
[1:20:50] now it's just a quote today
[1:20:52] right and it's not that the word of God
[1:20:54] has lost L its power God will never lose
[1:20:57] his power he'll never lose its value
[1:21:00] we're the ones that lose our sight of
[1:21:02] things we we we lose our hope we we let
[1:21:04] the devil crush it because that's the
[1:21:05] devil's job and he does a very good job
[1:21:09] Church there's no church persecution
[1:21:11] here you can come to church whenever you
[1:21:13] want you can pray whenever you want I
[1:21:14] told people in my church if you want to
[1:21:15] go pray in the church I'll go open it
[1:21:17] for you it's there for you to pray it
[1:21:19] that's your
[1:21:21] church we have prayer meeting on Mondays
[1:21:25] and tell you what you know who the
[1:21:27] faithful months are on Monday morning or
[1:21:28] Monday evening when it comes time for
[1:21:30] prayer meeting because praying is a
[1:21:32] job huh it's a job to to try to break
[1:21:36] that challenge to get try to get through
[1:21:37] but once you break through Oh What a
[1:21:39] Feeling Amen to feel the presence of God
[1:21:42] to cry out I don't care who's there if
[1:21:44] I'm going to cry you know snot coming
[1:21:46] out that's all right I'm I'm I'm In
[1:21:47] God's Presence I want to be
[1:21:49] there but sometimes we're afraid to know
[1:21:52] hide our tear I don't want to see me I'm
[1:21:54] crying
[1:21:56] we've lost that Joy Church it's time to
[1:22:00] reevaluate where we're at
[1:22:02] today it's time to reevaluate has God's
[1:22:06] word changed or have I changed or maybe
[1:22:09] I need to like David said Lord return to
[1:22:12] me the joy of my
[1:22:14] salvation bbam says he never lost it he
[1:22:18] never was lost he had just lost the joy
[1:22:20] he he forgot the value of serving the
[1:22:23] lord he he forgot the value of being in
[1:22:24] his presence but one day he recognized
[1:22:26] thank God for his grace that he reminds
[1:22:28] us Lord return to me the joy of my
[1:22:36] salvation Mortals that's us as
[1:22:40] Mortals to avoid danger we use our
[1:22:44] sight but if we ignore our sight we'll
[1:22:46] get into
[1:22:48] trouble everyone can see the Bible
[1:22:51] everyone can touch the bible everybody
[1:22:53] can read from the Bible but but if it's
[1:22:54] not a revelation it's just your senses
[1:22:58] touching a book with with ink on it and
[1:23:01] it's more nothing more than just a book
[1:23:02] to you but when it's real when it's when
[1:23:04] it's alive in you there's something that
[1:23:06] drives you that Mo motivates you
[1:23:10] amen glory to his
[1:23:12] name when you see somebody who's who's
[1:23:14] on fire for the Lord it inspires you to
[1:23:17] to to want to live for the Lord because
[1:23:20] they have an anointing that jumps on you
[1:23:23] those are the kind of anointings that we
[1:23:24] want in the church anointing from people
[1:23:26] that love the Lord we don't want no bad
[1:23:28] attitudes Church you get on with the bad
[1:23:31] and after you kick the poor dog what
[1:23:33] fault did he have he wasn't at work with
[1:23:34] you and after all that attitude it jumps
[1:23:36] on everybody and after a while
[1:23:38] everybody's in the bad mood at the house
[1:23:40] what happened I don't know Dad came home
[1:23:42] in a bad mood for what I don't know why
[1:23:44] you in a bad mood I don't know the
[1:23:45] spirit jumped in you that's why but we
[1:23:48] need God's spirit to jump on us in this
[1:23:50] hour and don't just jump for it to stay
[1:23:53] there church yes take it with you to
[1:23:56] work tomorrow morning when you go to
[1:23:59] work Mortals Faith cometh by the hearing
[1:24:03] and the hearing of the word of God you
[1:24:06] know what God requires from us is a
[1:24:07] clean
[1:24:09] heart where we're living in a time where
[1:24:11] there's a lot of negativity going
[1:24:12] against the message of the hour against
[1:24:14] people that's the time to pray for
[1:24:16] them that God will help them and God be
[1:24:18] merciful to them because when they label
[1:24:20] one message believer they label all of
[1:24:22] us the same and we're not all the same
[1:24:24] church amen we're under the same message
[1:24:27] but we're not the same church God help
[1:24:30] us I I I I I was remembering a dream my
[1:24:33] father had there there's a town about
[1:24:36] maybe 30 some miles from our house it's
[1:24:38] called Hillsboro up in the mountains
[1:24:40] it's a beautiful drive to get there nice
[1:24:42] turns get to the top there it's a cute
[1:24:44] little town up there and it's called
[1:24:46] Hillsboro and my dad one day had a dream
[1:24:48] that in this dream he went to Hillsboro
[1:24:50] with my mother and one of his sisters uh
[1:24:53] that goes to our church and he he walks
[1:24:56] into a store and my dad was looking for
[1:24:58] a loaf of bread so he walks in gets his
[1:25:01] loaf of bread and he goes to the counter
[1:25:03] to pay for it but there's nobody at the
[1:25:06] counter so my dad begins to think and
[1:25:08] say well if they're not here I'll just
[1:25:11] take it now for my dad to say that in
[1:25:14] his dream he's pretty
[1:25:16] backslid cuz my dad never stole from
[1:25:18] anybody but in the dream as a mortal he
[1:25:20] said well if they're not here to to
[1:25:22] collect my money I'll just take it
[1:25:25] and he picked up the bread and was
[1:25:27] getting ready to walk out and one of his
[1:25:30] sisters banged the
[1:25:32] counter Hey where's everybody at and
[1:25:36] when she said that my dad dropped a loaf
[1:25:38] of bread on the ground he got scared he
[1:25:39] dropped to the ground and when he B to
[1:25:40] pick it up about that time the owner
[1:25:43] came to the front of the counter and
[1:25:45] says can I help you and my dad says yes
[1:25:47] I wanted to buy this bread would like to
[1:25:50] pay you for it so my Dad paid for the
[1:25:52] bread took his loaf of bread walked
[1:25:54] outside he said that when he got outside
[1:25:57] he stood there looking outside and he
[1:25:58] heard a voice that
[1:26:00] said for you to walk with
[1:26:04] me your heart has to be
[1:26:07] clean brother it was just a loaf of
[1:26:10] bread it's just a Lo of bread you know

[1:28:56] lies God God God knows you he knows us
[1:28:59] already all right but look at his grace
[1:29:01] he still covers Us his blood is still
[1:29:05] there on the altar covering for us
[1:29:07] interceding for
[1:29:09] us you know when brother B talked about
[1:29:13] being at the cafe and he was condemning
[1:29:15] the waitress for being you know one of
[1:29:17] those worldly women is disgraceful woman
[1:29:20] he's condemning her and then b b him
[1:29:22] seeing you know where the world was and
[1:29:24] there was all these blood splatting
[1:29:25] against you know this world and all this
[1:29:27] big boom and all that and it was the
[1:29:29] sins and bbam thought those must be her
[1:29:32] sins but the Lord said no those are your
[1:29:35] sins and sometimes we're we're so quick
[1:29:38] to judge other people and and and and we
[1:29:40] point the finger to them and through
[1:29:41] them are pointing to us was they like
[1:29:44] that brother over there you know I tell
[1:29:46] people when people fall when people
[1:29:48] backslid I tell them pray for them don't
[1:29:51] condemn

[1:29:56] right Faith cometh by the hearing and
[1:29:58] the hearing of the word and when we
[1:29:59] Mortals get that faith our senses will
[1:30:01] have nothing to do with that Faith you
[1:30:04] know we've been preaching for years
[1:30:05] about faith and Faith cometh by the
[1:30:07] hearing of the word 40 years hearing
[1:30:08] this message what kind of Faith should
[1:30:10] we have by now Church think about that
[1:30:13] the hour is getting
[1:30:16] late since man left the Garden of Eden
[1:30:18] he's had to walk by senses and not by
[1:30:20] faith and he's struggled for doing that
[1:30:22] but thank God that he's sent his son to
[1:30:25] show us the way Amen to to to press on
[1:30:28] in this life thank God for this message
[1:30:30] of the hour church amen whenever you
[1:30:33] feel discouraged whenever you feel you
[1:30:35] know that that life is is not fair to
[1:30:37] you and you don't understand things in
[1:30:38] life brother listen to the word of God
[1:30:40] and I guarantee you that in that word in

[1:31:37] then when I come back I need a vacation
[1:31:39] for the mission Fields so I go a week up
[1:31:41] to the mountain and my wife never
[1:31:44] complains I thought
[1:31:47] wow why she recognized her place that
[1:31:50] she was standing by a prophet of God
[1:31:52] that he had a job to do and that was to
[1:31:54] preach the message to to to preach this
[1:31:58] message and to find the last one because
[1:32:00] this message will give you the faith for
[1:32:03] Rapture
[1:32:05] church I remember growing up there there
[1:32:07] was a rumor you needed a passport to go
[1:32:09] in the Rapture because we can all jump
[1:32:11] in the plane and go to Israel so we can
[1:32:12] be there on the mountain when the
[1:32:13] Rapture takes place and my dad was like
[1:32:16] you know I already got the I already got
[1:32:17] a passport it's called the Holy Spirit
[1:32:19] he said I don't need a physical passport
[1:32:22] I already got the Holy Spirit when my
[1:32:24] day comes I'll hear his name I'll go
[1:32:27] wherever I'm at I'll go in the Rapture
[1:32:30] church one day this Mortal will put on
[1:32:34] immortality amen God help us to
[1:32:39] understand that that we that we've got
[1:32:41] to get more in tune with God if he
[1:32:44] speaking to our hearts listen to him
[1:32:47] amen if if if you lack understanding ask
[1:32:49] for understanding if you lack Revelation
[1:32:52] ask for revelation
[1:32:54] let me share this prayer with you that
[1:32:57] Paul Harvey said one time how many know
[1:32:59] who Paul Harvey was all the old-timers
[1:33:02] the new are like who's Paul Harvey well
[1:33:04] for us Old-Timers I used to like
[1:33:06] listening to his news is very very
[1:33:07] insightful and one day he said this
[1:33:11] story he he he he aired the prayer over
[1:33:14] his radio program during the rest of the
[1:33:16] story program the rest of the
[1:33:19] story and received a larger response to
[1:33:21] this program than any other he has ever
[1:33:23] aired and this what is what he prayed he
[1:33:27] said Heavenly Father we have come before
[1:33:30] you today to ask your
[1:33:33] forgiveness do you know that daily we
[1:33:35] have to ask for forgiveness church
[1:33:37] because daily we
[1:33:40] backslide and we ask for your
[1:33:42] forgiveness and to seek your direction
[1:33:45] and guidance we know your word says woe
[1:33:48] to those who call evil good yes but that
[1:33:54] is exactly what we have done we have
[1:33:58] lost our spiritual equilibrium and
[1:34:01] reversed our values we have exploited
[1:34:04] the poor and we call it the
[1:34:08] lottery I people say man if I could win
[1:34:10] the lottery I would pay my tithing you
[1:34:12] can't even pay with a regular job how
[1:34:15] you going to pay with a
[1:34:16] lottery cuz the more money you have the
[1:34:18] less you want to let go
[1:34:20] of we have rewarded laziness and we call
[1:34:24] it
[1:34:25] welfare we have killed our unborn and
[1:34:29] called it
[1:34:31] choice we have shot abortionist and
[1:34:34] called it
[1:34:35] justifiable we have neglected to
[1:34:38] discipline our children and we called it
[1:34:40] building
[1:34:42] self-esteem you know my my dad didn't
[1:34:44] believe in building self-esteem he
[1:34:46] believed in whipping it out of you you
[1:34:48] want some esteem come here boy I give
[1:34:49] you some esteem right here you know even
[1:34:52] even tells me and my brother
[1:34:54] go get him a belt right now he would
[1:34:56] send us for the own weapon the one that
[1:34:57] he was going to punish us with he would
[1:34:58] send us to his room for it we were
[1:35:00] always looking for the skinniest belt
[1:35:01] and they were all the
[1:35:03] same then we bring it to him bend over
[1:35:07] okay we have abused power and called it
[1:35:11] politics we have coveted our neighbor
[1:35:14] position and called it
[1:35:17] ambition we have polluted the air with
[1:35:20] profanity and pornography and called it
[1:35:23] freedom of
[1:35:24] expression we have ridiculed we have
[1:35:27] ridiculed the time honored values of our
[1:35:30] forefathers and called it
[1:35:34] Enlightenment search us oh God and know
[1:35:38] our hearts today cleanse us from every
[1:35:42] sin and set us
[1:35:44] free amen you know for a for a non-
[1:35:48] message believer it's a pretty powerful
[1:35:50] prayer sometimes I get more Revelation
[1:35:52] from non-believers than
[1:35:58] Believers God help us in this hour
[1:36:00] Church to be more like him who wants to
[1:36:05] be more like Jesus I do amen God help us

[1:36:19] far in
[1:36:20] life you know the Rapture she had taken
[1:36:22] place a long time ago Church it should
[1:36:24] have taken place a long time ago but
[1:36:26] somebody ain't ready yet God's waiting

[1:36:31] will reach it out there in in in the
[1:36:32] fields of that are so you know absolete

[1:37:47] going to bother
[1:37:48] you because I've heard people say man

[1:38:53] have to go around testify you're a
[1:38:55] Christian the world will know that

[1:39:02] follows you you're like
[1:39:05] wow thank God that I can't see because
[1:39:07] we probably get conceited you know but

[1:39:42] say some really deep words and he said
[1:39:44] my brothers he said loved ones beloved
[1:39:46] he goes love one
