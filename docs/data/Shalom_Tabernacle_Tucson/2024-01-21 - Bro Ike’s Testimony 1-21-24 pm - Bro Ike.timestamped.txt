[46:40] remember you know things let me give you
[46:43] a little background of my Early
[46:45] Childhood you know grew up you know in
[46:48] farm country in Mississippi but I had a
[46:51] mom that was a Christian my dad he was a
[46:56] he called on God when he got in trouble
[46:58] you know but he was kind of and he was a
[47:02] he was my dad I loved him he loved me in
[47:05] his own way but he never very emotional
[47:10] or you know T just for his expressing
[47:14] his love he was pretty tough and I don't
[47:17] regret that he made a man out of me he
[47:19] taught me how to work and how to do
[47:21] things but my mom taught me about God
[47:24] and how to you know
[47:26] and that's what I I appreciate about her
[47:28] she was always home with us and took
[47:32] care of us know taught us how to work
[47:34] and how to and I don't know why I'm
[47:37] going through all this but that's not my
[47:40] anyway she taught me she had five
[47:44] boys and no girls but she made sure her
[47:48] boys knew everything about house
[47:49] cleaning washing cooking and taking care
[47:51] of them themselves amen cuz she made
[47:53] sure we knew that cuz she was when we
[47:56] got out on our own she wanted to make
[47:58] sure we can
[48:00] survive maybe she just didn't want us to
[48:02] come back
[48:04] home no she loved us but the main thing
[48:07] I can remember as young is her taking us
[48:10] to
[48:11] church and uh you know we was Southern
[48:14] Baptist and she would take us to church
[48:17] and make us get up and go to Sunday
[48:19] school and when she was sick or
[48:21] something couldn't go she made sure we
[48:22] went to Sunday school and uh you know
[48:25] and we love to go to Sunday school and
[48:28] we had went to a little Baptist Church
[48:29] for Sunday school and the pastor he
[48:33] would to give us a little peppermint
[48:35] stick of candy and that wasn't the only
[48:37] reason we was going but you know that
[48:40] was an encouragement
[48:44] sure and I can remember that we called
[48:47] him the candy man but he the pastor of
[48:50] the little church and he would always
[48:52] give us a a peppermint stick of candy
[48:54] for coming to church coming to Sunday
[48:56] school and as we got older I remember
[49:00] starting to public school and
[49:03] uh it used to be different even in the
[49:06] public schools you can pray and you can
[49:08] mention God and I we used to have a
[49:11] little Baptist preacher would come down
[49:13] once a week and he would uh he would uh
[49:16] have Bible Thor and he would give us
[49:19] bible verses to remember you know and
[49:22] that was one of the highlights of school
[49:23] for me is those Bible vers and remember
[49:26] you know I always try to remember my
[49:28] Bible verse so we get a little rewards
[49:31] on the next week at the Bible stury but
[49:34] I remember this one day he asked us said
[49:37] anybody want to be saved now you can't
[49:41] ask that in the school today but he said
[49:43] that anybody want to be saved I tell you
[49:46] what you do you just pray this little
[49:48] prayer when you get home and that's
[49:49] Jesus to come into your heart and uh
[49:52] here's a little model prayer Lord I want
[49:54] I don't I'm a sinner I don't want to be
[49:57] you know basically coming into my heart
[49:59] and save me and I couldn't wait to get
[50:02] home to pray this prayer and that night
[50:04] I got down on my knees by my bed and I
[50:06] pray Lord I'm a sinner I've done wrong
[50:10] and I don't want to be you know just the
[50:12] way he told me and something happened in
[50:15] my heart you know because I was sincere
[50:19] yes and I really wanted God to come into
[50:21] my heart and I was about 8 years old
[50:24] then and something
[50:25] happen Lord and I never forget that
[50:28] experience but being a child and not
[50:30] knowing nothing about God and not
[50:33] knowing what really happened you know I
[50:35] went into the world as a teen teenager
[50:38] but I always remember that and from that
[50:41] time I knew right from wrong I knew when
[50:44] I do what was doing wrong and it
[50:46] bothered me but like Paul say the thing
[50:48] that I would I do not but the things
[50:50] that I would not that do I and it would
[50:52] bother me but you know after you beat
[50:55] that down so much you know it don't
[50:58] bother you as bad anymore and I went
[51:00] through the teenage years of drinking
[51:02] and smoking and doing those things but
[51:05] God started dealing with me again about
[51:08] 28 years
[51:11] old
[51:12] and
[51:17] I and I'm so thankful yes you know I got
[51:22] so
[51:22] miserable that I needed God
[51:25] and my heart was crying out to him but I
[51:28] didn't know where to find him you know
[51:30] you ever been in that position you need
[51:33] God but you know don't know how to you
[51:36] know where he at he is and you know who
[51:38] he is but you don't know how to get to
[51:40] him but God knows where you are de and
[51:44] he knows how to get to you and he got me
[51:46] so messed God didn't do it but Satan got
[51:49] me so messed up in my mind that I
[51:52] thought I was going
[51:53] insane thought I was going insan say
[51:56] things you know but
[51:58] God touched me amen and turned me around
[52:04] and I'm so grateful I had got So Vain
[52:07] and so you
[52:09] know full of myself I should say that I
[52:13] thought I didn't need God and I and I
[52:17] had a spirit on me I know CU it spoke
[52:19] and it scared me one day I was just
[52:21] walking and thinking about you know I
[52:23] have a good job I have all these thing
[52:26] and I was thinking I don't and it came
[52:28] out of my mouth and said I don't need
[52:30] nobody and that scared me so bad I
[52:34] repented right there said God forgive me
[52:37] cuz that wasn't me that was the spirit
[52:38] that's on me it manifest and I'm so glad
[52:41] I saw it amen by the grace of God and I
[52:45] said God forgive me I don't want to be
[52:46] this way and that's when he really
[52:48] started deal to be
[52:50] again and long story I I didn't mean to
[52:55] go this way but it's not my choice yes
[52:58] sir but uh long story short God started
[53:02] dealing with me and I went back to the
[53:04] Baptist Church to the place that I
[53:06] thought God was cuz that's where I last
[53:11] that's where I left it where you left
[53:12] amen so I
[53:14] thought well it wasn't quite that easy
[53:18] my wife was always go to church and you
[53:20] take our son to church you hear
[53:23] me and one day
[53:25] I would stay at home going to watch
[53:28] football on Sunday morning but one day
[53:31] Jeremy got where he didn't want to go he
[53:34] wanted to stay home with Dad and my wife
[53:37] asked me to make him go to
[53:39] church and I couldn't do
[53:42] that I got up and I got dressed and I
[53:44] took him to church I wasn't going to be
[53:47] a hypocrite and make my son go to church
[53:49] when I wasn't going and that's how I
[53:51] started going back to
[53:53] church and well that's
[53:56] good yes in my heart I couldn't do it
[54:00] and I'm glad I didn't do it cuz God
[54:02] thoughted deals with me in the Baptist
[54:05] Church and uh I remember this one Sunday
[54:09] they invited the original Pastor for
[54:12] that church but he had moved on to
[54:15] Pentecost he was no longer a Baptist and
[54:18] he and man was that a
[54:22] service but he w r those Baptist over
[54:25] the coold boy they everybody in the
[54:27] church was mad but at him but me I was I
[54:31] was shouting because he called out all
[54:33] the sin in my life you know and I you
[54:36] know I went to the bench in the morning
[54:38] bench sir that's what they call it the
[54:41] moaning I went to the I was
[54:43] moaning too you know because God had
[54:46] dealt with my heart and uh but all the
[54:49] deacons was oh man they were sitting
[54:52] like
[54:54] this I said what's wrong with these
[54:56] people God has just spoke and told you
[54:59] the truth and you mad at it you fold
[55:01] your owns on God and that's what a lot
[55:03] of people do today they fold up and set
[55:06] up on God and he can't do nothing for
[55:08] them and it's by his grace he's trying
[55:10] to deliver us amen
[55:12] amen amen but that's the nature of
[55:16] man but
[55:18] anyway and after a while they asked me
[55:20] to be a deacon in the church and uh and
[55:24] I accepted
[55:26] it but and I because there was an Old
[55:29] Gentleman a
[55:30] Baptist uh uh
[55:33] Deacon and I noticed something there was
[55:35] some older people in the church they
[55:37] were genuine sincere they were spiritual
[55:40] people but the majority of the younger
[55:43] people were just put on I mean there was
[55:46] in I'm in that group I was in that group
[55:50] I put it that way just just to put on
[55:53] and uh but there was some that were
[55:55] genuine and this old Baptist ministry he
[55:58] kind of took me on his wing you know and
[56:00] he just you know teaching me how to be a
[56:05] deacon and I appreciate him the name was
[56:08] Deacon Mixon and uh and his wife and
[56:13] that group was uh
[56:15] genuine but like I say there was a a
[56:18] younger generation in the church that
[56:20] all they care about was dressing and
[56:22] looking good amen
[56:25] it's sad but anyway moving
[56:29] on God dealt with me a while in that
[56:33] church because while I was in there let
[56:36] me back up a little bit while I was
[56:38] doing while I was being a deacon there
[56:40] my brother heard the message on the
[56:43] radio in sou out of North Pole
[56:46] Alaska uh brother Jim bit Grandmother
[56:51] Had a radio station up there and she was
[56:53] Broadcasting brother Bram taped on
[56:56] online and my brother heard it and uh
[57:00] and got and got in contact with her and
[57:03] she gave him a minister name and uh I
[57:06] don't think the man was a minister
[57:09] brother Dennis Ballard and had Brother
[57:12] Don babet from Canada come to Anchorage
[57:15] and he came down and met with these
[57:17] brothers and they introduce him to the
[57:19] message and he got some tapes and he
[57:22] brought him back and he gave him to
[57:25] me and I was in the Baptist Church but I
[57:28] didn't listen to him I took the tapes
[57:31] and put them down in my basement and
[57:33] they were down there for two
[57:35] years and during that time I was
[57:37] continued to go to the Baptist Church my
[57:39] brother came into uh Anchorage where I
[57:43] live and he invited me to some services
[57:46] and I went and I heard things that I've
[57:48] never heard before how Jesus Christ is
[57:51] the same yesterday today and forever I
[57:53] heard that the correct way to baptize
[57:56] with in the name of the Lord Jesus
[57:58] Christ you know I had never heard these
[58:00] things before in the Baptist Church
[58:02] right so but and I believe that they
[58:06] were right but what really got me was
[58:08] the love between the people okay when
[58:10] they say God bless you they look in the
[58:12] eye and they me it amen not like we
[58:15] Baptist know we Pat each other on the
[58:17] bag of sta one another in the bag
[58:23] you but
[58:26] it started to bother me after a while
[58:29] when we baptize somebody in the name of
[58:31] the father Son and the Holy Ghost and
[58:33] now I got a revelation that it's wrong
[58:36] and it was just but I wasn't actually
[58:38] doing it I was assisting the pastor as a
[58:40] deacon but it's like every time we do
[58:43] that like stabbing me in the heart with
[58:45] a knife cuz I knew better but I didn't
[58:49] do anything about it until my son Jeremy
[58:52] wanted to be
[58:53] baptized right now I have to take a
[58:56] stand God know how to force you to take
[58:58] a stand you know you can squirt around
[59:00] all you want but when the time come you
[59:03] going to have to stand for right or
[59:04] wrong amen I'm so glad he gave me the
[59:07] courage to stand so I didn't know what
[59:10] to do at the first how to do it I was
[59:14] praying God what am I going to do now
[59:16] know how am I going to do this I need
[59:19] I'm not going to let my son be baptized
[59:20] in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost
[59:23] so I went
[59:26] and something said go get those tapes
[59:29] down in your basement I went down in my
[59:32] basement grabbed a box of tapes opened
[59:34] it up pulled out a tape didn't even look
[59:36] at the tile stuck it in the tape player
[59:38] and what the godhead explain I knew God
[59:41] was talking to me right there yes sir
[59:44] and I listened to that tape and I got a
[59:46] revelation of the
[59:48] godhead you know I always believed even
[59:50] in Baptist Church I always believed
[59:52] there was one God but I didn't know how
[59:53] to explain it
[59:55] and they tried to convince me there was
[59:56] more than one God but I stand on stood
[59:59] on it there's one God how do you know
[1:00:01] there's one God I don't know but there's
[1:00:03] one God that's right and God revealed to
[1:00:05] me that he is one
[1:00:08] amen so after I finished those tapes
[1:00:11] that tape I got the tape and I went to
[1:00:13] talk to my pastor and I asked him to
[1:00:16] listen to it with me and he said okay
[1:00:20] and we put the tape on the tape layer
[1:00:22] and turn it on and we listen to about 30
[1:00:25] seconds of it
[1:00:27] click and he looked at me and said the
[1:00:30] reason you believe he start talking
[1:00:32] about false prophets and the reason you
[1:00:35] believe this you haven't been taught the
[1:00:37] B what the Baptist
[1:00:41] believe and I love the man and I didn't
[1:00:44] you know he's a man finister of God so I
[1:00:47] honored him not disrespect him or get
[1:00:49] mad at him but I just said I believe
[1:00:52] this is the truth amen and I'm going to
[1:00:55] and and if God if I'm sincerely seeking
[1:00:59] the truth from God he will not let me be
[1:01:02] deceived I'm going to these people and
[1:01:05] I'm getting baptized the right way and
[1:01:08] I'm going to go church out
[1:01:13] there and I went and I got
[1:01:16] baptized and I was
[1:01:18] happy but my wife
[1:01:22] wasn't she forbid me to take our
[1:01:25] children to that
[1:01:27] church and I heard I had said I listened
[1:01:31] to the rest of those tapes in that box
[1:01:34] and brother Bram said don't fight with
[1:01:36] her just love her and I did I did that
[1:01:40] not my wisdom it was the wisdom of the
[1:01:42] Lord you know the word of the Lord and I
[1:01:45] applied it and with no more than two
[1:01:47] weeks he had changed completely and she
[1:01:50] was going to the church amen so the word
[1:01:52] of God works if you applied
[1:01:58] amen there's a lot I can say
[1:02:01] but one another testimony I want to give
[1:02:04] for sure God saved me in an airplane
[1:02:08] crash you able to put that picture up
[1:02:10] right
[1:02:11] now want you to
[1:02:13] see that's the

[1:02:53] I don't know if it should have called
[1:02:54] name he might not want his name called
[1:02:57] but it wasn't his fault it was I was
[1:03:00] just God I believe God it was for the

[1:04:49] off off off the
[1:04:51] water and Tom brother Tom had filled up
[1:04:54] the the uh Wings tanks and it was fully
[1:04:58] loaded with
[1:04:59] fuel and I weighed about 250 lb in
[1:05:04] Brother Ray Muse is about 65 and he
[1:05:07] probably weighed 300 lb and and we had
[1:05:10] gear you know and we had food and we had
[1:05:13] too much weight to get out the water so
[1:05:16] we kept we run go down to the end of the
[1:05:18] lake and we pour the power to and we go
[1:05:20] down the lake and we get almost to the
[1:05:22] other bank he Cho the power because we
[1:05:24] couldn't get off the water we did it
[1:05:26] about three times we figured we'd do it
[1:05:29] another time somebody going to call FAA
[1:05:31] and they're going to be out here but we
[1:05:33] went out the next time and we got enough
[1:05:36] momentum to get it off the water and we
[1:05:38] flew out there and we had a wonderful
[1:05:41] time we caught fish we had two a piece
[1:05:43] coming back that's more way coming back
[1:05:46] so Tom figure because of the weight he's
[1:05:50] going to cut back way back on the fuel
[1:05:53] just enough to get a out there and back
[1:05:55] you know so we can get wouldn't have any
[1:05:58] problem getting off the lake out there
[1:06:00] and that's what he did he came out to
[1:06:02] pick us up and we was flying back
[1:06:06] and just sightseeing looking at moose
[1:06:10] and The Meadows down there and we're
[1:06:13] going in to land in memory Lake in waso
[1:06:15] Alaska just a gradual
[1:06:18] descent and when we got almost to the
[1:06:20] lake he pulled back on the power just to
[1:06:23] level out you know set his flaps and get
[1:06:25] ready to land and when he did the engine
[1:06:29] spurted and it
[1:06:31] quit now let me back up just a little
[1:06:33] bit and show you how God prepares you
[1:06:36] for these things before time you know
[1:06:39] that was in 19 about
[1:06:41] 1993 and so his brother about 1990 a
[1:06:45] brother had called me and told me
[1:06:47] exactly everything that happened in that
[1:06:49] airplane crash he told me he had had a
[1:06:51] dream and seen it beforehand he told me
[1:06:55] where I would be sitting in the airplane
[1:06:57] he didn't see the other two people he
[1:06:58] didn't know who they were but he knew he
[1:07:01] knew he saw me sitting in the back of
[1:07:03] this airplane and it shook him up and he
[1:07:05] called me and told me about
[1:07:08] it and it kind of bothered me a little
[1:07:10] bit because I fly every day on airplanes
[1:07:12] I didn't know what kind of airplane and
[1:07:14] I said in the back at my commercial
[1:07:17] airplane you know I got a pilot co-pilot
[1:07:20] flight engineer I sit right over here at
[1:07:22] the the Das now ation where I do my
[1:07:24] paperwork
[1:07:26] at so I it kind of bothered me a little
[1:07:30] bit but I said I'm not going to quit my
[1:07:33] job I mean so I just committed unto the
[1:07:36] Lord you know cuz I've heard of in other
[1:07:40] testimony that prepared me for that that
[1:07:42] hour you know another
[1:07:45] testimony uh a brother told me about uh
[1:07:50] his sister had a dream that she was hit
[1:07:54] by semi and ran over by semi in her car
[1:07:58] and she went and told her dad and I
[1:07:59] believe her dad knew brother Brandon and
[1:08:02] he told the dream to brother Brandon and
[1:08:04] brother brandom now this is their
[1:08:06] personal testimony you won't find it on
[1:08:08] tape but I believed it because they're
[1:08:11] Christian and and God can do these
[1:08:13] things and
[1:08:15] uh when told her the brother brand and
[1:08:18] brother Brown told him well he didn't
[1:08:21] didn't get no interpretation of the
[1:08:23] dream but it says you know wishes and
[1:08:26] mediums can predict these kind of things
[1:08:29] but they can't have no power to change
[1:08:30] it amen they can they have no power to
[1:08:33] change it but as Christian we could
[1:08:35] change the outcome through prayer amen
[1:08:38] yes that's right and and and and I know
[1:08:41] that's the truth so I just pray and said
[1:08:45] God I don't know what this is all about
[1:08:47] I don't even know even though it's you
[1:08:49] basically but you know I I fly every day
[1:08:53] and I'm not not going to live in fear
[1:08:55] and I put it in your hands and I forgot
[1:08:58] about it just forgot about it and went
[1:09:01] know did my
[1:09:03] job and when I was going down in that
[1:09:09] airplane all this came back to
[1:09:13] me how did I skip something I was flying
[1:09:17] along the airplane engine quit and when
[1:09:19] we would get ready to go down those
[1:09:21] things started coming back to my memory
[1:09:24] man I
[1:09:27] remembered those things and my wife I
[1:09:30] remember but the main thing I remember I
[1:09:32] began to
[1:09:33] think I thought about my wife and my
[1:09:37] kids cuz I thought I was going to die I
[1:09:41] thought about the brothers I was with in
[1:09:43] their families and just thinking I said
[1:09:46] Lord this is I wasn't talking I mean my
[1:09:49] mind was going to
[1:09:51] racing and like everything else was in
[1:09:54] slow motion but your mind is just you
[1:09:56] know A Thousand Miles a minute you're
[1:09:58] thinking about everything and I'm
[1:10:00] thinking about The Three Families this
[1:10:02] is going to be devastating to our church
[1:10:05] you
[1:10:07] know and the thought come to me God if
[1:10:10] you don't help us we're going to
[1:10:12] die and the scripture came to me the
[1:10:14] name of the Lord is a strong tower the
[1:10:17] righteous can run into it and be
[1:10:21] saved and I believe that
[1:10:24] and I grabbed a hold to that scripture
[1:10:26] you know God always give you his word
[1:10:29] yes as a way out yes sir you know I'm
[1:10:31] standing here and the devil was filling
[1:10:33] my mind with fear and all kind of things
[1:10:36] but the word of the Lord spoke to my
[1:10:38] heart and said the name of the Lord is a
[1:10:40] strong
[1:10:41] tower the righteous can run into it and
[1:10:44] be saved and what is a righteous man
[1:10:47] brother Braham say he's not a sinless
[1:10:49] man but he one that trusted in a sinless
[1:10:53] one a righteous sacrifice and that's
[1:10:56] where my faith lies in Jesus Christ amen
[1:11:01] and I can
[1:11:02] remember as Tom pull back on the Yol now
[1:11:05] we don't have any power we're just
[1:11:07] gliding along and you know when the
[1:11:10] airplane
[1:11:11] quit engine quit you better pick a spot
[1:11:14] and go for it you find the best place
[1:11:16] you can think you can land and you go
[1:11:18] for it and then you go straight to it
[1:11:20] other words you turn anything you're
[1:11:22] going to stall lose power and and that's
[1:11:25] what happened I it's just the grace of
[1:11:28] God because we wouldn't have made it to
[1:11:30] the lake and there was nothing but trees
[1:11:32] underneath us so he turned just a little
[1:11:34] bit to the left and I heard the stall
[1:11:36] horn going
[1:11:37] off that's a scary sound when you have
[1:11:41] no power it started going off and I knew
[1:11:43] we were going down and usually an
[1:11:45] airplane when it stalls it breaks the we
[1:11:48] left bring wake break or the right
[1:11:50] whichever way it turn and it goes into a
[1:11:52] spin and into the ground and we was
[1:11:56] nowhere near enough altitude to recover
[1:11:59] from the Star so and it broke but it
[1:12:04] didn't go into a spin it went down like
[1:12:07] this uh the vertical stabilized on the
[1:12:10] back of the
[1:12:11] plane I know you know you can't see it
[1:12:14] ver could stabilized the tail section
[1:12:16] back here but the vertical stabilize it
[1:12:19] what steer the
[1:12:21] airplane D and it it hit a power line
[1:12:25] and it cut the stabilizer off that
[1:12:28] slowed us down a little bit and the left
[1:12:31] wing the left wing see it broke off and
[1:12:34] came over the top of the airplane on top
[1:12:36] of the other wing it hit a birch tree
[1:12:40] Leading Edge here and just rip the whole
[1:12:42] Leading Edge of that Wing out it kind of
[1:12:45] SP us around a little bit more and the
[1:12:48] floats is underneath you can't see them
[1:12:51] there it look like big canoes on the
[1:12:53] bottom of a airplane how many know what
[1:12:56] a flow plane is okay you know
[1:12:58] anyway those they say usually when you
[1:13:01] land on the ground those upright the
[1:13:04] bracket that holds those Flo on they hit
[1:13:06] the ground and they come up through the
[1:13:07] airplane like knives and they kill the
[1:13:09] passengers inside but it didn't happen
[1:13:12] that way we went in was right here you
[1:13:14] can't see it but there's a road we was
[1:13:16] close enough to the lake there's a road
[1:13:18] that runs around the lake like a uh
[1:13:21] right on the slope you know what a me
[1:13:25] like the down in the ditch on that those
[1:13:28] floats hit right on the edge of that
[1:13:30] road and took most of the impact went up
[1:13:33] underneath that Wing popped that Wing
[1:13:35] off and it came over the
[1:13:37] top of me in the back
[1:13:42] seat there was a fear of leaking but we
[1:13:45] you know but we had no well by the grace
[1:13:48] of God we didn't catch on fire but uh
[1:13:51] that Wing popped off come over top of me
[1:13:53] me uh the front engine
[1:13:57] cing hit on you see that little
[1:14:00] evergreen tree underneath there I don't
[1:14:02] know if you can see it but right
[1:14:04] underneath there has a green like a
[1:14:06] Bruce tree it hit that tree up here and
[1:14:10] rode it down just like a shock absorber
[1:14:12] I mean it was no more than a hard
[1:14:16] bump the winded windshield blew out of
[1:14:19] the
[1:14:19] airplane but we stepped out without a
[1:14:22] scratch amen
[1:14:24] but before we went into that star I
[1:14:28] remember saying Jesus and I remember
[1:14:30] brother Tom say Jesus at the same time
[1:14:34] and if the two any two can agree on
[1:14:36] anything on Earth as touching yes sir as
[1:14:39] touching it shall be done in heaven
[1:14:42] that's power in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:14:45] don't be afraid to call on that name he
[1:14:47] wants you to call on his name he wants
[1:14:49] you to show you his glory oh God is
[1:14:53] awesome you know God is awesome now I
[1:14:57] didn't remember all these things until I
[1:14:59] after I got in my truck and was driving
[1:15:01] away from the scene of the crime the
[1:15:04] accident then God brought all these
[1:15:06] things back to my memory that he showed
[1:15:08] me almost three years before it happened
[1:15:12] what was going to happen amen and he
[1:15:15] gave me enough Faith to call on his name
[1:15:19] and be delivered
[1:15:22] amen
[1:15:25] you know he could have came on the scene
[1:15:26] and just reached down and caught the
[1:15:28] airplane set it down God can do
[1:15:31] anything but he want us to trust his
[1:15:34] word amen that's what he wants me to do
[1:15:37] to take him at his word you know I would
[1:15:41] tell you another little
[1:15:42] testimony this has happened about oh

[1:18:53] it I mean how many need a hug from God
[1:18:55] yes sir all you got to do is ask I know
[1:18:58] that's true but I've been trying to do
[1:19:00] that again but he don't answer me like
[1:19:04] that because I get to he don't want me
[1:19:06] to depend on feelings he want me to take
[1:19:09] him at his word he promised he'll never
[1:19:10] leave me or forsake me but he'll be with

[1:19:21] believe him with all my heart amen

[1:19:27] to do to take him at his
[1:19:31] word and be
[1:19:34] faithful we don't have to understand
[1:19:36] everything we don't have to we would
[1:19:38] never will understand everything with
[1:19:41] these human
[1:19:43] brain but I believe all things by faith
[1:19:48] we understand amen that's what the Bible
[1:19:51] say by faith we understand that the
[1:19:53] world were framed by the word of God
[1:19:56] Amen okay explain that to me can't we
[1:20:00] just have to take God at his word and
[1:20:03] that's the way for anything about God
[1:20:05] you got to take him at his word believe
[1:20:07] it and
[1:20:09] then have you
[1:20:13] amen one
[1:20:18] more I'm a
[1:20:20] missionary and I believe everyone you
[1:20:23] are you have the same commission that we
[1:20:25] have as ministers go into all the world
[1:20:27] and preach the gospel to Every Creature
[1:20:30] amen Every Creature brother BR preached
[1:20:34] to
[1:20:35] apome Divine Healing amen Every Creature
[1:20:39] it works on everything Jesus cursed the
[1:20:41] Fig Tree so the gospel works on
[1:20:43] everything and I love to
[1:20:46] go and preach the gospel you know and
[1:20:50] brother Bram say is not I'm sorry Paul
[1:20:52] Paul said and brother Braham said it
[1:20:54] also CU he was a messenger like Paul but
[1:20:57] he
[1:20:58] said the gospel come not in word only
[1:21:03] yes but in power and demonstration of
[1:21:05] the Holy ghosten and brother and uh
[1:21:08] brother B said God vindicates his word
[1:21:12] and I believe that so my first
[1:21:15] missionary trip I was expecting to see
[1:21:17] signs and wonders and miracles and
[1:21:19] everything that's promised in the
[1:21:21] Bible I was expecting to see that and I
[1:21:24] went with brother Frank dudon to the
[1:21:27] Philippines and we went up above bagio
[1:21:30] way up in the mountains and out in the
[1:21:32] Buddhist little places you know
[1:21:35] preaching the gospel I remember I can't
[1:21:37] remember the name of the place but it
[1:21:39] was way up in the mountain and uh we
[1:21:43] would preaching in a like a a probably a
[1:21:47] a baseball stadium or something like
[1:21:50] that no it was concrete it wasn't dating
[1:21:53] but it's kind of A Gathering Place for
[1:21:55] Community together and they had one
[1:21:58] light buff and it was totally dark there
[1:22:01] was no street light there was no light
[1:22:02] in the house and you had the one light
[1:22:04] bulb hanging and uh you stand under the
[1:22:07] light bulb and you couldn't see
[1:22:09] nobody you're preaching but you couldn't
[1:22:11] see nobody and and it was kind of close
[1:22:14] to the rebel territory so they had one
[1:22:16] guy out there with
[1:22:18] AK-47 guard and everything you know that
[1:22:21] was scary but anyway we preached
[1:22:26] there and we preached uh a couple days
[1:22:29] there we was with a Philipino brother
[1:22:31] that were taking us around to these
[1:22:33] different places and I remember one
[1:22:36] night it rained so we couldn't have it
[1:22:39] out there so they moved it into a
[1:22:42] gymnasium school gymnasium I believe but
[1:22:46] but it wasn't many people there that
[1:22:48] night and there was one little lady came
[1:22:50] up and she was
[1:22:53] started confessing her sins to brother
[1:22:55] Frank and he told no sister you don't
[1:22:58] have to confess to me you need to talk
[1:22:59] to Jesus cist you know so we prayed with
[1:23:02] her and uh she gave her heart to the
[1:23:04] Lord that was after we had preached and
[1:23:07] it gave her heart to the Lord and uh did
[1:23:10] you wanted to be
[1:23:13] baptized well they didn't have no water
[1:23:15] to baptize they in no pool or anything
[1:23:18] so all the saints there were some
[1:23:20] Believers there they got all their
[1:23:23] drinking water which was rationed at the
[1:23:25] time they took all their drinking water
[1:23:27] and put it in a little trough and they
[1:23:29] got enough to to baptize
[1:23:33] her that was
[1:23:36] awesome and uh I came back home you know
[1:23:39] I was kind of kind of disappointed
[1:23:41] because I didn't see a whole lot of
[1:23:43] Miracles that I expected to see and I
[1:23:46] was kind of grumbling about it and the
[1:23:48] Lord spoke to my heart and said you saw
[1:23:50] the greatest Miracle ever was and I
[1:23:53] thought what that you saw a Sav you saw
[1:23:56] a soul get saved amen
[1:23:58] amen so and that changed my
[1:24:01] attitude you know I could have was s
[1:24:05] drinking water to do
[1:24:07] it and that changed my whole attitude
[1:24:10] you know what am I I was looking for
[1:24:12] signs and wonders but God was looking
