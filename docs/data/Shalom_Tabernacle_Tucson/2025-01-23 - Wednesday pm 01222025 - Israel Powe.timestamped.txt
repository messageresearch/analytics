[26:14] right to the word and uh before we go to
[26:16] our prayer requests this evening and
[26:19] there's a portion in the scriptures we
[26:22] like to take in Revelations chapter 3
[26:26] verse number 10 speaking
[26:29] to uh this church age here the
[26:32] Philadelphian Church
[26:42] age and when you have that you can say
[26:50] Amen verse number 10 says because thou
[26:54] has kept the word of my patience I also
[26:59] will keep thee from the hour of
[27:02] Temptation which shall come upon all the
[27:05] world to try them that dwell upon the
[27:10] Earth amen um Jesus in his prayer in
[27:14] Matthew chapter 6 uh let's turn there in
[27:18] our Lord's Prayer
[27:30] her's happy to be here tonight
[27:35] amen the scripture in verse number nine
[27:39] maybe we can read it all together says
[27:41] after this manner therefore pray ye Our
[27:45] Father which art in heaven Hallowed be
[27:48] thy name thy kingdom come thy will be
[27:52] done in earth as it is in heaven give us
[27:56] this day our daily bread
[27:58] and forgive us our debts as we forgive
[28:01] our debtors and lead us not into
[28:05] temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for
[28:08] thine is the kingdom and the power and
[28:11] the glory forever amen what a prayer
[28:16] Lord keep me from the hour of
[28:19] Temptation and uh we're going to uh take
[28:22] just a little thought on the five must
[28:26] that brother brandham gives to us um
[28:30] speaking of King David and the message
[28:33] trying to do God a service without it
[28:35] being his will and um we want to bring
[28:39] those remind those you of those five
[28:42] must once again so let us pray Lord we
[28:46] ask your blessings upon your word Lord
[28:49] upon your people and father we pray that
[28:52] you'll forgive us of every sin every
[28:56] unbelief that we've done forgive us
[28:59] father we ask that we can come into your
[29:02] presence and receive from you in Jesus
[29:04] name we pray amen God bless you you can
[29:07] be
[29:08] seated now this five must as I've said
[29:12] here in a number of different places I I
[29:16] talk about don't adding and don't taking
[29:19] and not taking away as um the great
[29:23] disciplines that's required in a pastor
[29:27] minister or believer anybody that
[29:30] handles God's word must have that
[29:33] discipline within themselves not to add
[29:36] to the word and not to take away from
[29:38] the word and as much as we have heard
[29:41] that before in the past and we know that
[29:44] to be true there is a temptation to do
[29:48] just exactly that to add something or to
[29:52] take away leave out something this is
[29:54] where the original sin started with Eve
[29:57] in the garden
[29:58] Satan only got her to um add just one
[30:03] word thou shalt not surely die we were
[30:06] reminded of that Sunday morning weren't
[30:08] we beautifully how the serpent came and
[30:12] caught her Enchanted her through wisdom
[30:16] through knowledge and speaking to her
[30:18] about the scriptures and just simply got
[30:21] her off on one word and that's all he
[30:23] wants from you and I today is to
[30:27] disbelieve one word not a whole group of
[30:29] word if he can get you on several things
[30:31] great but really all he has to get you
[30:34] is on one word one word out of place
[30:37] throws the whole Bible out of order it
[30:41] was placed in order the solar system
[30:45] there's an order to it there's a
[30:46] discipline to that it's not just random
[30:49] nature there's a discipline to that and
[30:52] uh this discipline like handling a
[30:55] firearm or anything
[30:58] like explosives or working with
[31:01] electricity anything like that requires
[31:03] a certain discipline you just can't I
[31:06] have a brother who works with
[31:08] explosives uh propane tanks and the the
[31:12] stress and the pressure and working in a
[31:15] place like that because you can lose
[31:16] your life just working with vow V uh
[31:20] vows how you say it vow valves not
[31:23] vowels but Valves and making sure things
[31:26] are tight and the right pressures the
[31:29] right amounts you can't go in there
[31:31] without getting enough sleep you can't
[31:33] go in there have stepping you can't do
[31:35] like I do on the job and the
[31:37] construction just be daydreaming you got
[31:39] to be focused in what you're doing
[31:41] because somebody can lose their life and
[31:44] it requires that and it's every bit as
[31:47] important in handling God's word it's
[31:50] the same thing and so as much as we love
[31:54] everybody and we want to love every
[31:55] person every believer and all all the
[31:58] other groups of people the Temptation
[32:00] will always be to twist to add to take
[32:04] away from the word and God has commanded
[32:07] us to stay with that word Beyond
[32:10] Fellowship friends families whatever our
[32:14] commandment is to stay with the word and
[32:16] when you come in contact with more
[32:18] groups of people you'll find more of
[32:21] these issues challenging you to do just
[32:24] that to stay in with the word amen so
[32:28] the prophet of God takes these five must
[32:31] and in the message um I'm not going to
[32:35] be long Lord help me um is
[32:41] the what message did I want
[32:44] Saints thank
[32:46] you John is becoming one of my favorites
[32:49] him and sister Heather they helped me
[32:51] out they help me preach all
[32:53] right um doing God a service without it
[32:56] being his will
[32:58] and uh you can become my favorite too
[33:01] all of you can so just help me out here
[33:04] in the message the prophet of God it
[33:06] goes in right here and I'll start right
[33:08] here in paragraph 103 and he says this
[33:11] now notice influence sometimes great
[33:15] guys get together you hear them say
[33:18] great so and so and great so and so are
[33:21] great don't never do that there is no
[33:25] great ones Among Us there's only one
[33:29] great one and that's God we are brothers
[33:33] sisters I don't care if you're pastoring
[33:35] a church that's got five people in it
[33:38] that don't make you little that makes
[33:40] you a brother see if you're true to
[33:43] God's word don't care what how you don't
[33:47] get little God don't have little
[33:50] children and big children he just has
[33:53] children they're all the same notice God
[33:56] himself come from the palaces of Glory
[33:59] to become one of us now who is the big
[34:02] one not come down here to take the form
[34:04] of a priest but a servant wash the very
[34:08] clay that he was created the feet of his
[34:10] Apostles and others now who is great but
[34:13] influenced these men were they didn't
[34:16] understand they thought something new
[34:18] was going to happen no something that
[34:21] God didn't say was going to happen they
[34:24] went at it the wrong way now to get the
[34:28] context of what we're talking about here
[34:31] tonight it's in 1
[34:33] Chronicles uh chapter number five is
[34:37] where David corrects the error but if
[34:40] you want to
[34:42] go um uh further than that is chapter 4
[34:46] I believe chapter 2 3 4 somewhere right
[34:50] in there to get the full context of what
[34:52] David had done he wanted to bring the
[34:56] ark which was the word of the Lord back
[34:59] to its rightful place he wanted to move
[35:02] God's word he wasn't trying to do
[35:04] something bad he wasn't trying to set up
[35:06] an idol he wasn't trying to lead the
[35:09] people into a denomination or organ he
[35:11] was really with all of his heart trying
[35:14] to do something right but you see no
[35:17] matter how right it is if you're
[35:20] handling a firearm and it's loaded that
[35:24] gun doesn't care who the owner is if you
[35:27] you shoot it and it's pointed at
[35:29] whatever it's pointed at it's going to
[35:31] hit
[35:32] it and there's many many families that
[35:35] have been injured and hurt and
[35:37] devastated because of this discipline
[35:40] right here it's a loaded weapon and it
[35:43] doesn't matter you didn't mean to it
[35:45] doesn't matter it was my own gun it
[35:48] doesn't matter what matters is it's a
[35:50] loaded firearm and there's a discipline
[35:53] required when you're handling it and you
[35:56] can't play with with that you can't
[35:59] leave it laying around you can't just
[36:01] expect junior is going to understand
[36:03] that no and it's that serious amen right
[36:08] and so handling God's word is every bit
[36:10] as
[36:11] important and and so brother Ram is
[36:14] talking about that and he's bringing
[36:15] this in where David wanted to move the
[36:17] ark back and then as they were bringing
[36:21] it back they didn't consult the word of
[36:23] God which was the prophet and when that
[36:26] Ark stumbled an innocent man didn't want
[36:29] the ark to hit the ground and he went
[36:31] forward and try to catch the ark from
[36:34] follow falling fallen and God struck him
[36:39] dead and that got everybody's
[36:42] attention and that's the time to stop
[36:45] doing whatever you're doing you don't
[36:46] keep moving forward if somebody dies
[36:49] like ananas is Sur fire or anything like
[36:52] that happens you got to stop what you're
[36:54] doing and and and take inventory what's
[36:56] going on here
[36:58] there's a reason why this is going on
[37:00] and this is this is the great shock that
[37:02] happened to David and the prophet of God
[37:04] is bringing that he says but influenced
[37:07] these men were they didn't understand
[37:09] they thought something new was going to
[37:12] happen they went at it wrong that that's
[37:15] what all this enthusiasm started back
[37:18] Yonder a long time ago each denomination
[37:21] had to have a Divine healer each
[37:23] denomination had to have this that or
[37:25] the other each denomination had to have
[37:28] a little David each one had to have this
[37:31] that or the other see what happened it
[37:33] done the same thing it did here same
[37:36] thing influence the word for the season
[37:40] the time that they were living in was
[37:43] ignored notice the Levites shoulders was
[37:47] the original provided way of God to do
[37:51] these things pack that Ark on the
[37:54] Levites shoulders
[37:57] anything outside of that was contrary
[38:00] what he said that's what he meant God
[38:03] cannot change that's the reason stay
[38:06] with his word I've got a script yeah 1
[38:10] Chronicles 15:15 if you want to put that
[38:13] down now notice there in following God
[38:17] now I want you to kind of jot this in
[38:19] your mind to keep God's
[38:23] Commandments to do anything right for
[38:26] God
[38:28] to do God a service
[38:31] correctly there is five musts to do
[38:35] God's service
[38:37] correctly emphasizing the
[38:41] correctly notice David was doing God a
[38:44] service he was doing everything he know
[38:46] to do except leaving off God see he was
[38:50] doing something right something good for
[38:54] the people something good for the church
[38:57] but the these five must I want you to
[38:59] remember these no matter how sincere man
[39:02] may be in doing it God a service these
[39:08] five must be there first it must be his
[39:12] time to do it what if Moses would come
[39:15] and say We'll build an ark and float up
[39:17] the Nile like Noah did Noah's time was
[39:19] all right for an ark but not his time
[39:22] what if Jesus would have come and says
[39:24] now I'll tell you what we'll do we'll go
[39:26] up the mount like Moses did and get a
[39:28] new Declaration of law see uh-huh he was
[39:31] that law see you must be in his time it
[39:36] must be in his season you got that now
[39:40] must be in his time must be in his
[39:43] season time and season and it must be
[39:46] according to his word that has been
[39:49] spoken it must I don't care how well you
[39:53] say this ought to be or that ought to be
[39:57] or for this ought to be it's got to be
[39:59] according to his word according to his
[40:02] time and his season and it must be given
[40:06] according to the person he has chose to
[40:08] do it
[40:09] by I don't care how much dignitaries
[40:12] there's King David just as great as any
[40:15] of them he was King over the nation but
[40:17] he had a way of doing it and he had to
[40:20] he had told them how he would do it but
[40:23] they failed to do it must be Accord
[40:27] according to his word according to his
[40:30] time according to his program it must be
[40:33] by the person he has chose to give it
[40:36] and to do it Moses tried to run from it
[40:39] take somebody else but God chose Moses
[40:42] to do it many of them Paul tried to get
[40:45] out of it many others but it's got to be
[40:48] the one he chooses to do it it must come
[40:51] first to His prophets the word of God
[40:55] must come to His prophets amamos 37 the
[40:58] Lord God will do nothing until he first
[41:00] reveals it to his servants the prophets
[41:04] for and the prophet must be Vindicated
[41:08] by the word of God there is your five
[41:13] must it's got to be that way his time
[41:16] his season when he said it would be the
[41:19] man he chose and must come to the
[41:21] prophet and the prophet must be a
[41:24] Vindicated Prophet we find out many of
[41:27] them in the Bible it come to the
[41:29] prophets it wasn't Vindicated our
[41:32] Prophet is Jesus Christ so brother Adam
[41:36] tells us it's the time it's the season
[41:39] it's the person it's that person it must
[41:43] come through a Vindicated Prophet or the
[41:46] word has to be spoken by a Vindicated
[41:49] prophet and that that Prophet must be
[41:51] Vindicated it must come by a prophet and
[41:53] that Prophet must be Vindicated so um
[41:57] just looking at that and really thinking
[42:01] about that then we can say that a
[42:03] prophet is the time piece that shows us
[42:08] the time and the season that we're in
[42:10] that's right so instead of trying to
[42:12] figure out what time and Seasons once
[42:14] you got the prophet and he's Vindicated
[42:17] he will determine what time and season
[42:20] that you're in because his word is going
[42:23] to be current for the day we're living
[42:25] in that's right in the days of Noah it
[42:27] was current for that day it's going to
[42:30] rain in the days of Moses it was current
[42:33] for that day we're leaving Egypt and
[42:35] each day John the Baptist he was waiting
[42:38] for to introduce the Christ so the
[42:41] Vindicated Prophet is is the one that uh
[42:46] shows us the time in the
[42:48] season and when you look at this trying
[42:50] to do God a a service it it seems like
[42:54] you know for us to do something that's
[42:57] right or something that's good or if we
[42:59] want to serve God correctly if we want
[43:02] to do God a service or do anything right
[43:06] for God as he says if you want to keep
[43:09] God's Commandments then these five must
[43:13] be there so you say well I can't do God
[43:17] a service because I'm not a I'm not a
[43:19] prophet or I'm just a sister or no
[43:22] that's not what he said you got to
[43:24] already he said it has to come through a
[43:26] Vindicated Prophet so the prophet's word
[43:30] is the
[43:31] instructions that gives you the ability
[43:34] to keep the Commandments of God that's
[43:37] how you know you're doing it correctly
[43:40] because you received a Vindicated
[43:42] Prophet that Prophet came he was
[43:45] Vindicated and he brings you into the
[43:48] time and season so this timing is very
[43:52] very
[43:53] important timing for um just one
[43:58] example uh in St John chapter 5 the
[44:02] Bible says that at a certain season a
[44:05] angel would come near the pool of
[44:09] Bethesda and near this pool of Bethesda
[44:12] were were a multitude or two multitudes
[44:16] of lame halt withered people that were
[44:19] sick and diseased and what they would do
[44:22] is sit around this pool waiting for the
[44:25] troubling of the water so there was a
[44:27] time element that was required when that
[44:30] water was troubled that meant that the
[44:32] angel was on the water and once the
[44:36] first one to get in that water was made
[44:39] whole of whatever their trouble was the
[44:43] scripture says so they're watching
[44:45] they're waiting they're looking at this
[44:48] time and um you know knowing that the
[44:53] prophet has been Vindicated knowing that
[44:57] he has brought to us the word of the
[44:59] Lord I would challenge that this need of
[45:05] patience is it's
[45:08] probably what all of us can use that
[45:11] virtue of
[45:12] patience waiting on the
[45:16] Lord now the the just the raw definition
[45:20] of patience means this the capacity to
[45:23] accept or tolerate delay yes yes
[45:28] yes let me
[45:31] finish without getting
[45:34] angry I almost got that I can wait I can
[45:39] tolerate
[45:41] you well boy I'm mad at you but let's
[45:44] read the definition it's without getting
[45:48] angry you if you got mad you lost your
[45:53] patience don't look at me like that
[45:55] unless you going to say Amen to me the
[45:58] capacity to accept or tolerate delay
[46:02] trouble or suffering without getting
[46:05] angry annoyed or
[46:09] upset beautiful word
[46:12] huh you have need of patience the
[46:14] scripture tells us and so in Revelations
[46:17] chapter 3 and verse number
[46:20] 10 tells us that you have kept the word
[46:26] of my patience
[46:27] patience now brother brandom tells us
[46:30] what that means the word of my patience
[46:33] and he says this in the Philadelphian
[46:37] Church age under the eulogy in the
[46:39] church age book it's written just like
[46:41] this Revelations
[46:43] 3:10 because thou has kept the word of
[46:45] my patience I also will keep thee from
[46:47] the hour of Temptation which shall come
[46:50] upon the world to try them that dwell
[46:52] upon the Earth what does he mean by the
[46:55] word of my patience
[46:57] Hebrews
[46:59] 61315 for when God made promise to
[47:02] Abraham because he could swear by no
[47:04] greater he swear by himself saying
[47:06] surely blessing I Will Bless thee and
[47:09] multiplying I will multiply thee and so
[47:12] after he had patiently endured he
[47:15] obtained the promise you see the spirit
[47:18] is speaking about the word of God which
[47:21] is given to us to wait for the
[47:25] Fulfillment of that word
[47:27] required patience even as it did in the
[47:32] case of Abraham he endured as seeing him
[47:36] who is invisible he was patient then the
[47:40] word finally was
[47:43] fulfilled this is the way God teaches
[47:46] his people
[47:48] patience why if he fulfilled his word
[47:51] and physical
[47:52] manifestations the very instant you
[47:55] prayed you would never learn patience
[47:59] but become even more impatient with life
[48:03] let me show you this truth even fully
[48:06] set forth even more fully set forth so
[48:09] what has this you know age of getting
[48:12] things quick and fast and the
[48:14] communicate what is that bread is it
[48:16] made us more patient or more impatient
[48:19] you know it the the the your computer
[48:22] will never be fast enough
[48:27] think about that the faster version is
[48:30] what you
[48:32] want and yours is faster than it was
[48:34] five years ago but it still ain't fast
[48:37] enough and it ain't going to ever be
[48:39] fast enough because it doesn't create
[48:42] patience it creates more impatient
[48:47] people you can't get back to people
[48:50] quick enough they want to hear from you
[48:53] now they want to answer now they want
[48:56] every everything done right now they
[49:00] want their career now they want it set
[49:02] now they want their salary at is maximum
[49:05] people they don't want to go through 20
[49:06] years 30 years 40 Years of nothing
[49:09] that's right 20 years for what that's
[49:11] right who wants to wait 30 years for for
[49:14] what no I want this now I deserve it now
[49:19] I feel like
[49:21] right it belongs to me it doesn't create
[49:24] and so what it does and
[49:27] so be careful now these little short
[49:31] sermons I give you it's just it ain't
[49:33] going to never be short
[49:41] enough because if I go 25 minutes and
[49:44] then I go 28 be like brother Israel
[49:46] what's going on you you I mean you kept
[49:48] us a whole extra three
[49:50] minutes where are you
[49:54] going Eternal ones
[49:58] believers who crossed the banner of time
[50:00] we're Eternal beings where are we
[50:04] going to take their clock maybe the new
[50:06] church won't even have no clock you
[50:09] praise the Lord there you
[50:11] go it just creates more
[50:14] impatience it it's it's really on you to
[50:18] wait on the
[50:20] Lord without getting upset without
[50:23] getting anxious without getting annoyed
[50:26] wait on the
[50:27] Lord in the great promise of the Holy
[50:31] Ghost coming to the disciples Jesus told
[50:33] them to go wait for the promise of the
[50:36] father he didn't tell him how many days
[50:38] he didn't tell him it's going to come so
[50:40] he said wait there what
[50:44] until until when Lord I need to know I
[50:48] got stuff I need to do I'm making my
[50:50] schedule I'm trying to plan out my life
[50:54] I want this done before I'm 25 I got to
[50:56] list of things to get done before I'm 30
[50:59] before I'm 40 I got a list of things and
[51:02] Lord you need to honor my
[51:04] list you talking to the wrong person
[51:06] right
[51:08] there when you're waiting on the lord
[51:10] it's until you get an answer can I get a
[51:14] witness Lord teach me how to
[51:18] wait you know he's proving himself by
[51:22] giving us salvation once we experience
[51:25] salvation he has proven himself to us
[51:29] the greatest thing that could ever
[51:30] happen to a man is to be
[51:33] forgiven of all of his sins the greatest
[51:37] experience that can happen you repent
[51:39] and he forgives you and then from there
[51:43] he has everything else in order and
[51:47] mapped out for your life if you can just
[51:49] believe
[51:51] him but what happens is we get impatient
[51:54] and this is what Eve did
[51:57] she was given the instructions in the
[51:59] Garden of Eden and but and she knew
[52:02] there was a promise to replenish the
[52:04] earth and the prophet of God says she
[52:07] couldn't wait that's right that that you
[52:10] know I got to have I know it's going to
[52:12] happen you gave me a promise I know it's
[52:14] there you said it's going to happen so
[52:16] Lord how can I help you you can help me
[52:19] by just
[52:21] waiting until I come get you like I got
[52:24] you when you wasn't even thinking about
[52:26] me I came and got you you wasn't even
[52:29] searching for me you wasn't looking for
[52:33] me I came and I found
[52:35] you and now all of a sudden after I
[52:38] found you not of any good of your own
[52:41] now you going to put me on the clock and
[52:42] start pushing me and pushing me and
[52:44] pushing me God's going to tell you to
[52:47] wait
[52:48] mm wait on the Lord be of good courage
[52:53] and he shall strengthen thine heart
[52:57] wait I say upon the Lord they that wait
[53:00] upon the Lord shall do what they get
[53:03] stronger sir the longer you wait the
[53:06] stronger you
[53:08] get if it comes too quick it's only
[53:11] going to breathe more impatience is that
[53:13] what he said read it for you one more
[53:15] time here the church age book he says
[53:18] there here you wait for why if he
[53:22] fulfilled his word and physical
[53:25] manifestations the very instant you
[53:27] prayed you would never learn patience
[53:30] but would become even
[53:32] what more
[53:35] impatient could you imagine serving
[53:39] someone that is
[53:42] impatient
[53:45] difficult difficult to serve someone
[53:49] that's impatient like that so he gives
[53:51] us this Word of Promise he gives us
[53:54] these five mons the time
[53:57] and the season you know this great
[54:01] blessing that the Lord has blessed us
[54:03] our with our church building nothing
[54:06] short of a miracle in my in my heart in
[54:08] my
[54:10] mind it was nothing I planned out in my
[54:14] planner there was no you know yeah just
[54:17] as I planned it there's none of that huh
[54:22] no no no there none of that so so so
[54:25] when we going start stressing then
[54:28] somebody let me know when we start
[54:29] stressing because it's
[54:34] coming but he who brought forth day one
[54:38] day two day three don't you think he's
[54:41] got day four five and six taken care of
[54:44] too he's got the rest of your life taken
[54:47] care of he's got your future in his
[54:52] hands can we rest in that Lord give me
[54:56] the grace to walk and run the race with
[55:03] patience um not frustrating the the
[55:07] grace of God as Paul says in Galatians
[55:10] chapter 3 I will not I do not frustrate
[55:14] the gospel do not want to frustrate I
[55:16] forget how he says there that there but
[55:18] you make Grace the grace of God
[55:21] frustrating you he started you in Grace
[55:24] and now you want to finish it in works
[55:26] yeah that's right now I want to work
[55:28] this I'm going to get this done I'm
[55:29] going to make this happen he started You
[55:32] by his grace it is by his grace that he
[55:36] will perform Every Blessing every
[55:40] promise in your life Lord teach me how
[55:44] to
[55:45] wait give me the patience Lord to walk
[55:48] in this discipline of believing in you
[55:52] and trusting in you and never let my
[55:54] testimony be negative but always
[55:57] positive with a praise on my lips you
[56:02] take these songs of the world it's Blues
[56:05] it's the country it's a somebody's dog
[56:08] died somebody's wife left them and all
[56:11] the blues and all the but that's not
[56:13] praise and worship praise and worship is
[56:15] all positive it's the scripture I Will
[56:19] Bless The Lord at all times his praise
[56:23] shall continually be in my mouth my soul
[56:28] will make her boast in the Lord The
[56:31] Humble will hear thereof and they'll be
[56:33] glad oh taste and see come and magnify
[56:37] the Lord with me taste and see that the
[56:39] Lord is
[56:41] good that's the Praises that's the word
[56:44] of the Lord that's what the song service
[56:45] is all about did any of y'all miss
[56:49] that that was your opportunity to get
[56:52] your get your praise on was the worship
[56:55] service
[56:57] wasn't coming to see what color tide the
[56:58] brother had on is it a fast s or slow
[57:01] song that was your praise
[57:05] break right
[57:07] there and he's so good to us he's so
[57:12] merciful to us he's got it all under
[57:15] control as the brother
[57:18] saying and so here is where Eve made her
[57:24] great
[57:27] great
[57:29] mistake and brother brandom is typing it
[57:31] with the church so in the spoken word is
[57:33] the Original Seed he brings this it's
[57:36] prophetic it's very uh um relative for
[57:40] our day as he brings it to us I mean
[57:43] think about because we have received a
[57:46] messenger and a prophet that's
[57:48] Vindicated and has showed to us the word
[57:52] for our day then we know what's supposed
[57:54] to happen today we kind of know what to
[57:56] look for we're we're not a know- it all
[57:58] we don't know every exact thing but we
[58:01] know we're not looking for a Revival
[58:04] when we know there's judgment coming for
[58:07] example you know we're not looking for a
[58:10] messenger to come when that's already
[58:12] happen and we know we're not looking for
[58:15] some word to be opened up like a a
[58:18] corner to be turned which so many people
[58:21] you know God's doing a new thing well
[58:24] what you mean by new
[58:26] or God's going to turn a corner that's
[58:28] what we used to do but this what we're
[58:30] doing
[58:31] now you got to watch these people that
[58:33] want to turn a corner without any
[58:37] quotations want to turn a corner without
[58:40] a prophet yes sir want to turn a corner
[58:43] without the scriptures
[58:46] Vindicated and this is how we know how
[58:48] to stand brother will is because it's in
[58:52] the word of the Lord and the word comes
[58:56] to the prophet then he becomes an
[58:59] extension of that word that's right it's
[59:02] very very nice it's very sobering it's
[59:05] very beautiful and when you catch it
[59:07] you'll be resting you won't be running
[59:10] around I'm missing this I'm missing that
[59:12] got to push and make this happen got to
[59:14] man I got to make myself see this you
[59:16] ain't G to see nothing that God don't
[59:17] want to show you everything he showed
[59:20] you was by his grace and then we just
[59:23] receive it and say thank you Lord show
[59:25] me more
[59:26] in your time you
[59:30] will I guarantee you every one of us is
[59:34] doing something today that in probably
[59:36] five years from the day we'll look back
[59:38] and say you know I was wrong there
[59:40] absolutely yes sir but it's amazing how
[59:43] we want to indict the elders that went
[59:45] on before they should have did this
[59:47] should have did that should have did
[59:48] this keep on living as my mom would say
[59:51] you keep living and when your time to
[59:54] leave here I car
[59:56] you somebody can rise and say he should
[59:58] have did this he should have did that
[59:59] should have did that but you know there
[1:00:01] is nothing that I can see uh in the word
[1:00:04] that I I mean I think I'm doing
[1:00:06] everything right I sure hope so don't
[1:00:09] you yes I mean if I'm doing something
[1:00:12] wrong and I know it I'm just wrong but
[1:00:14] if I'm doing what I believe is right and
[1:00:17] I think I'm doing it right with all my
[1:00:19] heart and then five years down the road
[1:00:20] I found out I was wrong guess what I was
[1:00:23] wrong don't we show that Grace for the
[1:00:25] elders then that's right do you think
[1:00:27] they were doing what they did here in
[1:00:30] this city or in the state with the
[1:00:32] message or or whatever they've done that
[1:00:34] they were doing it to be
[1:00:38] wrong see we want Grace for oursel but
[1:00:41] we want to leave Grace for them but if
[1:00:43] you'll keep living you're going to want
[1:00:45] somebody to have some Grace for you
[1:00:48] too
[1:00:50] amen so what do you do you wait on the
[1:00:54] Lord he doesn't make you feel
[1:00:57] uncomfortable when he reveals something
[1:00:59] to you it's like a puzzle piece clicking
[1:01:02] in your heart you know it's the will of
[1:01:05] God for you what you feel uncomfortable
[1:01:07] about is the people around you they are
[1:01:10] the one who make you feel uncomfortable
[1:01:12] but the Lord is not going to cause you
[1:01:13] to do something that is going to make
[1:01:15] you feel he's not going to make you feel
[1:01:17] embarrassed or uncomfortable he he's
[1:01:19] trying to bring you his rest and when he
[1:01:22] reveals that to you it does bring rest
[1:01:26] but then now to communicate that to
[1:01:28] others to take a stand when others can't
[1:01:31] see it to take a stand when your friends
[1:01:33] are around you don't see it that's where
[1:01:35] the rub really comes from The Outsiders
[1:01:38] the Lord doesn't the Lord brings you his
[1:01:40] word and he says take my yoke upon me
[1:01:45] take my yoke and it is easy my burdens
[1:01:49] are easy my burdens are light what's the
[1:01:53] scripture say take my yoke upon thee
[1:01:56] and learn of me for my yoke is easy and
[1:01:59] my burdens are
[1:02:03] light and when the Lord gives you these
[1:02:06] convictions down in your spirit down in
[1:02:10] your heart you need to just go with that
[1:02:12] this is the
[1:02:15] message this is what he
[1:02:17] said and when I'm listening to it I'm
[1:02:20] all good brother will brother George I'm
[1:02:23] doing great listening to wow amen great
[1:02:26] and then you get in groups and groups
[1:02:27] and groups some of them quotes make you
[1:02:29] feel uncomfortable it's not the quote
[1:02:31] it's the people who don't believe
[1:02:33] it or vice versa however you want to say
[1:02:36] it so here the prophet of God says this
[1:02:39] here talking about Eve and it's a it's a
[1:02:42] touchy spot here for all of us and a bit
[1:02:46] of a warning to you okay it says
[1:02:50] paragraph
[1:02:51] 52 the bride today is a byproduct she
[1:02:54] calls herself the bride but what she is
[1:02:58] she's made up of material of
[1:03:00] organization not of the word so much
[1:03:02] word in it to make it kind of a
[1:03:04] byproduct to make it
[1:03:07] hypocritical Eve believed most of the
[1:03:11] word but she doubted one part of it this
[1:03:14] is in the spoken word yeah today she
[1:03:16] can't even get
[1:03:18] Acts or Matthew 28:19 straight with acts
[1:03:21] 238 see it confuse it confuses her
[1:03:25] that's just one little place of hundreds
[1:03:27] of others now the Bride of Adam was a
[1:03:30] type of the second Adam's bride now
[1:03:33] Adam's
[1:03:35] bride Adam's bride could not wait God
[1:03:40] had told Adam and Eve multiply and
[1:03:42] replenish the Earth it was an oncoming
[1:03:47] thing a
[1:03:49] promise she was not his wife as yet
[1:03:52] because he had never lived with her the
[1:03:54] bride of Christ is not his wife wife yet
[1:03:56] the wedding supper is to take place get
[1:03:59] it notice oh this is Rich she got in her
[1:04:03] hurry and what did she do she crossed
[1:04:07] her seed she mingled it with the serpent
[1:04:09] seed and when she did she WR what did
[1:04:12] she bring forth she brought a child of
[1:04:15] death a child that she perverted every
[1:04:20] child after that and when the Church of
[1:04:23] Jesus Christ was perverted in the time
[1:04:25] time of Rome after her virgin birth and
[1:04:28] was given to Christ at Pentecost what
[1:04:30] did she do she crossed herself with
[1:04:33] Roman Dogma the Protestant church has
[1:04:36] done the very same thing she can't
[1:04:41] wait drop down to paragraph 59 that's
[1:04:44] what Christ has found couldn't wait
[1:04:47] that's what the matter with the people
[1:04:49] today they can't wait for the real Holy
[1:04:53] Spirit to take the church in
[1:04:57] position they've got to manufacture
[1:04:59] something work up something initial
[1:05:02] evidence speaking in tongues to get more
[1:05:04] members in the church all this kind of
[1:05:06] Tommy Rod instead of waiting upon the
[1:05:09] Lord for the real manifestation of the
[1:05:12] resurrection of Christ making himself
[1:05:15] known among the people she
[1:05:18] can't
[1:05:20] wait now don't you want to wait for the
[1:05:23] real manifestation
[1:05:26] of the Sons and Daughters of
[1:05:28] God don't you want to wait for the real
[1:05:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost in its
[1:05:35] fullness to be manifested in your life
[1:05:38] in your
[1:05:39] heart I mean what if everyone else is
[1:05:42] getting and they're getting it and that
[1:05:43] one's getting it you can't make yourself
[1:05:45] get anything but you can you can wait on
[1:05:47] the
[1:05:48] Lord without being anxious and continue
[1:05:52] to believe his word is true Lord you
[1:05:54] brought me this far you'll take me to
[1:05:57] The Next Step you're the one who brought
[1:05:59] me here just a beautiful Revelation that
[1:06:03] uh talking with brother McGraw when he
[1:06:06] he made that statement to me he's like
[1:06:08] he says you know your family the Lord is
[1:06:10] the one who brought him here and I'm
[1:06:12] like yeah that's true I didn't bring any
[1:06:15] of my family here and now I'm going to
[1:06:18] stress out and lose sleep over my family
[1:06:20] getting saved no I need to take God's
[1:06:23] word what he said about my that my
[1:06:25] family is his
[1:06:26] responsibility he brought them here he
[1:06:29] spoke to me he can speak to them I
[1:06:32] believe he is speaking to them I claim
[1:06:35] them like I claim my own salvation
[1:06:37] that's the way you talk about your
[1:06:39] family your family is not your
[1:06:40] responsibility God's the one that
[1:06:42] brought it you're not a Creator you
[1:06:44] didn't bring anybody here so why should
[1:06:47] we worry why should we stress over the
[1:06:52] promises that God has given to us it was
[1:06:56] an oncoming promise God had promised
[1:06:58] that to multiply and replenish the Earth
[1:07:01] and they had to put something into it to
[1:07:03] make it happen I don't want to be that
[1:07:05] way Lord help me to take a stand on your
[1:07:09] word to find where that word is to
[1:07:12] respect it with all of my heart and to
[1:07:14] diligently believe and wait for those
[1:07:18] promises to be manifested in my life I
[1:07:22] believe that with all my heart I believe
[1:07:24] if the word is preached it will produce
[1:07:26] the signs wonders and miracles it will
[1:07:30] produce a Revival it will produce the
[1:07:35] manifestations that the word said it
[1:07:37] would bring these signs shall follow
[1:07:42] them that
[1:07:45] believe not vice versa we believe the
[1:07:49] word we take a stand on the word and
[1:07:52] then he brings the Vindication of the
[1:07:54] stand that we take Lord help us as we
[1:07:57] bring our prayers to him tonight amen
