[Applause] shine I Was So Unworthy of such Mercy [Music] amen oh can we give the Lord a hand clap of Praise this evening amen amen God bless you thank you musician and we'll get right into the word this evening I got to uh I got to hurry up this evening I was teasing brother Israel a little bit this afternoon about getting done earlier than him and so can't go long tonight but uh I did speak to brother Israel just briefly there this afternoon and uh sends his greetings to you and and uh had a wonderful Service uh there in uh West Palm Beach this this morning and he did a fine job I I uh said they were really receptive and and was a fine message that he preached and so I spoke to another Minister friend of mine that was down there and he' never heard brother Israel before and he said man that guy can preach and so and uh you know that's uh uh it's it's good it's good to get out like that and and he does US good and I'm sure he did them good as well so uh before we get into the message I owe you a couple of quotes from this morning and I said I'd read them to you so I'll make sure I do that we can pull those up the first ones from Blasphemous names and I was talking about this morning the hair coloring and this was not uh in any way to cast anything against anybody this was a revelation to me and that I had went all these years and just thinking one thing and then and then something else opened up to me in the message and so and blaspheming names uh brother brandom said uh and always he said I've always been accused of being hard on our sisters about wearing bobbed hair and manicure all over their face and stuff I've always been accused of being hard on our sisters he said it isn't that I got anything against that I don't say the woman isn't a good woman that she's some street walker or something that isn't my attitude but it's this when she puts on artificial on the outside it shows the a lot of artificial on the inside see he said we ought to be filled up with Christ because the outside always expresses what's on the inside by their fruits you know them you see and where Christ are to be in there and to be and to care for the God and to care for the things instead of so much artificial pump and you know Green eyelids and unhuman like and all that kind of stuff just don't go for it I don't believe the Bible does either so I like to be just what we are so I like to be just what we are and Saints that's always been that's always been my testimony I want to be what I am I I don't want to be something I'm I don't want to be one way when you see me today and another way when you see me somewhere else I don't want to be one way at church and in another way at work or another way somewhere else I want to be what I am amen notice he says excuse me he says uh he said notice now if she hasn't got any fingernails and wants to put uh some on if she hasn't got any teeth and need some haven't got an arm and you need one haven't got hair and you need some you haven't got these things that's different but when you pull out your real good teeth because they're just not as bright as they should be then you've done you've done wrong he said he said if you've got red hair and you want black and you go down here and color it black just because you done wrong amen now that's what the prophet said isn't it now that second one I was talking about was on ministering gifts and how that I never knew up until recently that brother Brandon said to pray for those nine spiritual gifts and so uh those were two areas where I I was making the point that we're always growing and we're always or we should always be seeing more we should always be getting more out of the message it's not a it's not a book of History it's a book of Prophecy and so miss the ministry explained brother Bram says this now in the book it's taught over there that God has placed in the church five ministering gifts first is Apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors those gifts God places in the church sovereignly so he he does that as he will amen so if he wants to place in the church an evangelist or a pastor that God does that sovereignly is that is that what he said Saints now those gifts God places in the church then when you become in the body of Christ then there's nine spiritual gifts that goes in every local body and and those gifts are that you're those gifts that you're to pray for to pray for the gift of speaking with tongues or the gift of interpretation of tongues or these other gifts that goes into the church pray for the gifts of healing and pray for the gifts of Miracles and so forth that's the ones that you that you pray for and the spirit comes on and works in each local assembly in the perfecting of the church now how many now many times we've misjudged that and went over the mark and so forth and that's what caused it but we expected if it if it wasn't that way I think there was something wrong with the program because Satan isn't trying to upset it you see so look we believe that and we and I believe to you methodists and Presbyterians here tonight I've seen many things since I've been on the Pentecostal Realms that I didn't agree with that's right I've seen plenty plent of them but what of it so brother Brandon made the example of how that they went too far with speaking in tongues and said it made it to evidence of the Holy Ghost that everybody should speak with tongues and he said we went too far but he said but what of it it doesn't change the fact that there that the that there is a real genuine speaking in tongues and he said and we are to pray is that what he just said Saints we're to pray for those gifts and I've been all 27 years of believing this message message and I'd never ran across that quote before so I'm betting there's some other quotes that I hadn't run across yet also and uh and I'm comfortable enough tonight to say I hadn't got it all figured out come on somebody tonight I ain't got it all figured out amen but I believe it when I see it amen I I believe it when I read it I believe it when I hear it my my heart wants to be right tonight Saints amen I want to line up with this word amen stand with me if you will turn your Bibles we'll get into the message tonight Exodus the 3r chapter the 11th verse uh just for a little a little text tonight sure is good to be back in the house of the Lord and and how many of you eat too much at lunch okay all right shame on y'all and you got to make me work harder try to keep everybody awake tonight amen brother Tim it looks like it's just me and you son all the rest of our family's gone he's always my favorite son-in-law anyways you know amen surely Josh will get a hold to that amen y'all pray for our family we're under attack and uh the whatever that disease is sickness or whatever it's really really spread out amongst our crew and so amen one thing I do know is this we're getting better all the time Exodus the 3rd Chapter 11th verse Moses said unto God who am I that I should go unto pharaoh and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt and he said certainly I'll be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee when thou Hast brought forth the people out of Egypt ye shall serve God Upon This Mountain let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you for the reading of your word tonight we thank you for this wonderful group of saints gathered here this evening Lord we've got many out tonight Lord we've got many traveling Oh God we pray you keep your hand upon them we've got many that want to be here or are listening in and and can't be here Lord and they're sick in their bodies Lord I pray oh God that your angel would touch their bodies just now Lord and that you would heal each one father we pray Lord we pray for the Saints and Mesa listening in tonight Lord we ask that you would bless them there as well we pray for brother Israel sister Sharon and Lord the girls tonight we pray that you would bless them in their uh their travel and their efforts father to do something for the kingdom of God and we just pray for Lord each one bring them back safely we ask and father we just pray uh Lord that you would be with all of those that's traveling oh God now we ask as we come to this point of the service Lord we pray you'd be with each one of us Lord I ask that you would Lord watch over me and speak through me Lord bind my lips before I'd speak anything unpleasing to you we'll commit it all into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the church said amen God bless you may be seated the title of the message tonight is a chance to make a choice a chance to make a choice and I I ran across this I've been preaching on Moses a lot here recently and uh uh this is probably the sixth or seventh sermon I've preached right out of this same little passage of scripture of Exodus the 3 chapter and and what caught my attention here was that Moses said unto God he said who am I that I should go to Pharaoh that who am I that I should deliver your people who am I I I'm not qualified I can't speak well I'm not able to do it and what what got me to thinking here Saints is I don't know if that would have always been Moses's attitude when you when you consider it he'd been raised in in Pharaoh's home he'd been raised as a prince he'd been raised knowing brother Brown said he knew that he was to be the deliverer he knew that what God had called he knew he was special he knew that he there was something different about him he knew that God had showed him that he knew that and he'd been raised kind of as we'd say it today with a silver spoon in his mouth he was a prince in a in a nation and and and it might not always have been his attitude he was educated he was smart he was intellectual he was taught in all the ways of the Egyptians and he knew that he was to be the deliverer and I'll tell you Saints anytime you get to thinking that you know something or thinking that you're special in some kind of way that's a recipe for disaster if you ever start thinking that you're capable of doing something your fall is coming see a little failure will tell you a whole lot about yourself a little failure will tell you a lot about who you are as a person and I had a young man it was uh the Lord was calling him to be a minister and he was talking to me here recently and he was saying brother George I feel like God's called me into the ministry and and and what should I do I said well you need to pray brother you just need to keep it before the Lord in prayer and I said if God's called you he's he got a place for you if he's got if he's called you to the ministry he's got somebody for you to preach to and the Lord opened a little door for him and he had an opportunity to go into a little church and and do some Bible studies and he said brother George I felt when as soon as I got done with that Bible study I said I ain't never doing this again he said I messed up so bad and he said but 10 the next week he said they called me again want me to come back and do the Bible study he said what was I going to do he said but the lord gave me a little something and I went back and I preached uh did that Bible study again he said and I messed up so bad I said brother that's probably the best thing that could ever happen to you amen what would have been what would have happened if he' went in there and set the world on fire and then he went back the next time and set the world on fire and the first four or five times he set the world on fire and what would have happened to him what might he might have started thinking he was something he might have started thinking he had an ability or he was a gift and that's the worst thing that can happen to you you got to fall on your face sometimes to realize that this is all in God's hands and if there's anything good about you and me today it's from him if a sermon goes good it's CA God blessed it not you can preach at the best of your abilities but if the Holy Ghost ain't in it it'll it won't go no higher than that first Pew right there so a little failure teach you a whole lot about yourself and we got to get comfortable with the notion that we might fail sometimes we might make mistakes sometimes sometimes things might not work exactly the way we want them to nobody wants to fail but everybody's going to fail now is that right Saints but it's how we react to that failure that separates the sheep from the goats wow now there's a quote it's not from the message it's for I think it was actually Teddy Roosevelt that said it he said the only man who never makes a mistake is the man who never does anything now is that right Saints if you won't sit around and never mess up you ain't never going to do nothing and that works for the Lord as well if if you want to sit around and not mess up you'll never do anything for the Lord but it's the mistakes that we make that help us grow it's the things we do wrong that teach us way more than the things we did right if you do something good that's all right but if you do something bad you're going to remember it it's going to be a lesson is that right Saints Wayne grety said you miss 100% of the shots that you don't take is that right if you don't ever want to miss a shot don't ever take one you won't miss any but you won't make none either I was since I was on this I was looking up these quotes uh Michael Jordan said this he said I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career he said I've lost almost 300 games 26 times I been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed I failed over and over again in my life and that's why I succeed he said think about that Saints now these are just secular people these are athletes and different people a great uh Teddy Roosevelt was a great man and these are accomplished people but these were accomplished people that learned that failure is going to happen failure is a part of success wow come on somebody right so we got to get to the point that we recognize that we're nothing and we make mistakes but we can't just throw the towel in and say I ain't trying no more we got to we got to get back up and say forgive me Lord and try me one more time yeah I didn't do right I didn't handle that situation right but let me try again Lord I I I didn't handle my family right but let me try again Lord I didn't handle maybe I lost my temper maybe something I come up short in some way but try me one more time Lord give me one more chance amen and we got to get to that point he said in influence of another he said I want to say this right now the blood of Jesus Christ is all sufficient you know what that means Saints the blood is all inclusive it's all we need see Christ never died for them serpens no no they were created being he never died for angels He died for Sinners he never died for holy people he died for Unholy and as long as you think you're holy he never done you no good but when you realize that you're nothing then he died he died for you I'm so glad that he had these attributes I'm so glad that the inside of God was these attributes that had to be manifested I'm so glad that he had a desire to be a savior he had a desire to be a Healer he had a desire to be a father he had a desire to be a son I'm so glad that he manifested those attributes cuz I have a desire that I sure need him now I need him in the power of his resurrection I need him in the Forgiveness of my sins I need him in his healing touch I need him as my savior I need him as my deliverer I need the Holy Ghost I need salvation I need Joy I need peace I need him tonight Saints I'm helplessly dependent on him oh God I need him in those attributes I need him key to the door Papa Cox again he said why don't you become a Christian he loves you he said brother brandom I'd become a Christian when I can get good enough I said I tell you what do Papa you look around to where you find where you can get good enough and then tell me where that place is I want to go to I said Christ never come to save good man he come to save bad man and when you think you're good then he didn't come to save you he come to save them that he knows are bad Christ died to save Sinners oh he died for me Saints he died for you tonight Saints lowed down good for nothing as my daddy used to say I was wasting good air yes sir I was breathing oxygen as somebody useful could breathe yes you remember I read that quote to you that if you got a belly button today you're in the same shape he said cuz if you got a belly button that means you born a renegade now this quote really brings it in perspective to me angel of the Lord he said the Bible said in these last days that there'd be a famine and not for bread and water alone but for the hearing of the word of God why would there be a famine for the hearing of the word of God look how much word we have today we got more word than we've ever had but yet there's a famine in the land for the hearing of it but there ain't no famine in the church for the hearing of it Saints that's right or there shouldn't be there might be a famine out there for it and when you look around out there there's very little of the word of God that you'll see but it shouldn't be that way in the house of the Lord and he said and the men would go out from the east west north and south try to find it and would fail you better get sealed in the kingdom of God by the Holy Ghost why you got a chance you talk about a confusing time it's coming let me stop right here and say it's here it's a confusing time it's a time where you don't know if it's a man or a woman woman now I could be a an animal used to be just two genders I fill out to get airline tickets to fly all over the country I got to check is you male or you female or you non-binary or other how is there anything other than male and female saints it's a confusing time it's a time where sin is being recognized as nobleness talk about a confusing time it's coming when the Bible said to be so close till it would deceive the very elect if it was possible is that right it's so confusing that there's very little chance that you're going to navigate each and every situation perfectly right very little chance at some Point as tricky as everything is you're going to make a mistake Let Me Maybe y yall wanton I'm gonna make mistakes I'm not going to navigate everything exactly right all the time I'm not going to have the right answer all the time I'm not going to know the right thing to do all the time but I like what does Paul said Philippians the 3r chapter if you want to turn with me tonight uh brother Joe made mention of this scripture in his prayer tonight Philippians the 3r chapter now Paul the 12th verse you can read the whole verse when you get home but the whole chapter when you get home but but but Paul was speaking here on this 12th verse and he said not as though I had already attained either were already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of je Christ Jesus Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth under those things which are before I press toward the mark of the for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus so Paul was explaining how that he he was talking about the attaining the resurrection and he talked about how that he used to what he used to know and the life that he used to live and and how he used to be a Pharisee and the strictest of the Pharisees and and all of those things and he said he was scholarly and he had all this wisdom and he said I I had to count it all as lost that I might know Christ sometimes you got to forget everything you know to know Jesus he said and he said and then I I love this he said I'm not perfect I I I don't pretend like I've attained everything he said I'm not perfect he said but this one thing I got going for me the one thing I got going for me brother will he says is that I have put the past in the past I put the past behind me and I'm pressing on toward the future amen we got to get real good we're learning how to put the past behind us put the failure behind us and press toward Mark amen and and he says I I I can't help that I Stone stepen I can't help that I consented to it I can't help that I that I held the coats of the men that stoned him I I can't help that I persecuted the the Church of God I can't help that I can't do anything about it but I have put it in the past and I'm pressing toward the future I can't change that I persecuted the kingdom of God but I still got a chance to make a choice and I'm choosing to press toward the mark of the high calling now is that right saints Saints we can't help what's going on in the past every one of your lives every one of our Lives is filled with trials it's filled with failures no doubt it's filled with hard battles there's been so much things go on so many miles under so much much waters went down the river there's been so many trials think back across your life at everything that God has brought you through church problems and family problems and personal problems and mental problems spiritual problems health problems look all the things that God's brought and you can't change one of them amen but you can put the past in the past and press toward the Future come on tonight somebody I'm working hard up here too many all you that ate too much now speaking about Moses in our opening scripture brother brandom said that Moses had been a bitter failure but he was always born to be the deliverer when he was a failure he was still the deliverer when when when when when he was a young man raised in faith Ro's Palace he was still the deliverer when when when he was rejected when when he thought when he thought his brothers would understand and they didn't understand and he became rejected and he slew the Egyptian he was still the deliverer now is that right Saints when when he was an outcast when he was on the run from the law he was still the deliverer when he sat on the back side of the desert watching sheep for 40 years he was still the deliverer amen when the Lord commanded him to go back and he doubted and said I'm not able I'm not good enough I can't talk good enough he was still the deliverer amen even when he messed up he was still the deliverer when he was on the back side of the desert an 80y old man weak sickly in his body he was still the deliverer and today we're the predestinated Bride of Jesus Christ is that right Saints you're and you're the bride say Amen to that you are the bride tonight and when you was coming up and when you was doing whatever you was doing you were still the bride when you fail you were still the bride when you when you made mistakes you were still the bride amen come on brother Rick yes brother Rick didn't eat too much oh God when you turn left and you should have turned right you were still the bride when when you lost your temper that time and you didn't handle something the way you should have you were still the bride when you mishandled a matter at work or at home or at church you were still the bride when when you wasn't your best day when it wasn't your finest hour when it wasn't the best time you ever had you were still the bride oh when you were lazy or selfish or bitter or angry you were still the bride when you didn't put your best foot forward for your family you were still the bride because you always was the bride before the foundation of the world and even though we're predestinated we still got to make a choice tonight because he put us here that way thirsting for Life brother Brown said if we had been brought to this place by the grace of God we're free moral agents to make a choice and if the holy spirit that brewed us from the earth and starts to brood brooding to our hearts and we accept him and brood back to him how much more is he able to raise us up in the last days when we got a chance to make a choice we got a chance to make a choice he said so it could only be through the brooding of the Holy Spirit that's how life comes that's it's by the Holy Spirit therefore you can only have life by the Holy Spirit that's why Jesus said except a man man be born again he can in no wise see the Kingdom of Heaven he goes on in this quote to say many will come in that day saying haven't I cast out devils in your name haven't I done many mighty works in your name and he said Jesus will say depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you he said they say they did it but they never did it he said how can somebody write a check out of my bank account and I don't know about it come on somebody if money's missing you know it he said they didn't do it they was carnal in some kind of way and he said we're set here as free m agents and and we go along through life and we do what we do I went 21 years in my life and never stepped foot into a church I went 21 years in my life and never opened a Bible I went 21 years and did what I did and I did everything I was big enough and some things that I wasn't big enough to but one day he said the Holy Spirit begins to brood over us and he said it Broods over you and it it begins to deal with you and begins to call you to it it begins to call you and he said you have to accept that calling and that's the only way it said he can bring life remember it's not us that go seeking God it's God that comes seeking us oh we're blessed that he sought us we're blessed that he called us hlj blessed are they that do hunger and thirst you're blessed just to be hungry you're blessed just to be thirsty it's the Holy Spirit brooding life into you and it's a blessing just to be condemned amen so some some people do all this stuff and it don't bother them a bit some people do all this sin it doesn't bother them at all why did it bother you oh god oh there's a seed down in there oh there was something predestinated in there there was something in there for the Holy Spirit to brood over than and it dealt with our hearts it might have been after years is sitting on a church pew you can be raised in the message and not be in the message you can come to church every Sunday and Wednesday and not have the Holy Spirit in your life amen it might have been in an Alleyway it might have been in a gutter somewhere it might been in a service like this tonight but the Holy Spirit Broods life into you and you got a chance to make a choice you can say I receive that into my life I accept that as mine I accept it as simple as it is I accept it the way he give it you got a chance to make a choice Saints All I need is a chance all I need is an opportunity all I need is a chance to make it come on somebody tonight all the bad ideas that I've had and I've had some terrible ideas all the hardheadedness in my life I know you Brothers ain't this way I'm just talking about me and people at other churches that's hard-headed all the hardheadedness all the stubbornness all the bad decisions all the times I wouldn't listen to nobody but I still got a chance tonight to make a choice I still got a chance I still got an opportunity to get it right all I need is an opportunity to get it right tonight oh man if we got up out of bed this morning there's still hope for us there's still an opportunity we still got a chance but that window is closing fast in Escape hither come quickly he said yes brother oh yes brother I say this hurry Escape you hadn't gotten much more time these great big old ecclesiastical walls are going to fall one of these days you better run quick while you got a chance get out of the world come into Christ Saints we got to get out of this world oh we can't mix the message in the world we we we can't see how close to the world we can live and still be in the message we got to get as far away from it as we can I don't want to ride my chariot on the edge I want to be over here on the wall amen I don't want to see how worldly I can look or how worldly I can live and still claim the message get out of the world he said come to Christ he says when you see the hot breath of judgment hanging on each side now swinging 1,800 miles an hour around or 18,000 miles an hour around and around the world and a sinful Nation with her hand on a button that can send us all the powder in 5 minutes am don't look for something great to come don't look for something great to come a great Revival you look for the coming of the Lord he said be ready now he said the devil's only blinding your eyes to these things everybody's putting it off Saints everybody's looking for something great to come down the road he said be ready now we're look looking for the coming of the [Applause] Lord he said the devil's blinding her eyes he said Christ declared himself to every nation and through every generation and he's doing it today the church nominal sets asleep the church spiritual is awake even if you ate too much you're awake tonight Saints Oh Glory even if it's Sunday night you're wake tonight he said the sleeping virgin is one off to sleep and that'll take the tribulation period but the one that had oil in her lamp is ready blessed be the name of the Lord oh Saints we got to get ready while there's a chance the door's closing the hour is upon us we could be powdery said in five minutes and the prophet touches something and I think many struggle with in the message he said don't wait for something big amen amen don't wait for something big be ready now he said the next thing is the coming of the Lord and and all through the message this one's got a Revival this one's got a Doctrine this one's got a a path that we need to go but he said we're looking for the coming of the Lord amen he said don't wait get ready now if someone ask you what you're looking for you tell them I'm looking for the coming of the Lord we're looking for a Rapture Jesus Christ the same yesterday day and forever he says I believe that by God's word I don't see one thing left that would hinder the coming of the Lord Jesus tonight now that sounds rather erratic but it's the truth he says all the prophecies pertaining to his second coming as far as I know is already fulfilled waiting for his coming so what kind of people should we be alert and ready at any minute for his appearing Saints when this stuff starts happening that work is going to be so short so quick amen amen that you're going to have to be ready just to see it amen that's right amen don't think I'm going to get ready when that happens there won't be time to get ready when that happens be ready now that you'll see it when it happens you're going have to be in the right channel just to see it happen oh God alert and ready at any minute for his appearing he said let's live in this meeting let's do this just as if this may be the last meeting the last Revival that'll ever be in Chattanooga Tennessee I've been there beautiful place they got dirt there but let's let's live it this is might be the last meeting in Tucson Arizona let's live like this might be the last Revival that Shalom Tabernacle will ever see he said we could be powder in five minutes I'm so grateful that the Lord provided a way through all my mistakes I'm so grateful that this isn't complicated I'm not smart enough for this to be complicated I if it was complicated I'd never make it Saints it it doesn't take understanding some great mystery or somebody's complicated Revelation I don't like mystery preaching cuz when they get done it's still a mystery to me I like a simple gospel when the prophet said it I understood it it's amazing to me how somebody can take a simple message and make it complicated it it doesn't take an emotional workup although I do believe in Emotion but I think we got too much of it in some some places not enough in others but it doesn't take that it doesn't take it doesn't take it it's not a it's a simple faith in God's word and to say I'm making a choice tonight to believe that word amen amen what else can you do but believe can you save yourself can can you make yourself see anything brother Chris can you give yourself a revelation he's got to do it all you can't deliver yourself you can't make yourself holy you can't give yourself a spiritual gift you can't place yourself in a body God's got to do it all we're depending on that tonight amen can the musicians come here's some good news for you tonight though there's nothing we can do about it we can't give ourself a revelation we can't save oursel we can't fill oursel with the Holy Ghost but the good news is this that's what he does that's the business he's in we can't heal ourself but that's what he does we can't deliver ourself but that's what he does we can't save our families but that's what he does we we we can't we can't we can't give oursel peace we can't give oursel joy but that's what he does and he's in that business tonight that's his business tonight amen let's just play something [Music] there Prophet said tonight so far as I know the church may be the time of calling may already be already passed I don't know I I can't say that remember the people went right on having meetings just the same after the crucifixion of Jesus and he says and all the people they they'll come they they watch they they'll go right on preaching and saying they're getting saved and everything just as if the World continues on as it was they say but it'll be too late then he said while you got a chance my brother why you got a chance my sister come into the kingdom of God you don't have to come under anything else but just plain Faith to believe the word he is the word Lord Jesus I know I'm looking at myself now in the mirror of God's word oh how short I am but dear God here tonight on this Monday night here in San Bernardino California or this Sunday night here in Tucson Arizona in this Auditorium here this he said this is all I have Lord but I give it to you can we bow our heads it's all God Lord but I give it to you it's all that I Am Lord but I give it to you there's a different version of Rock of Ages that's in the Methodist Himel it's a little different than the one we sing I don't know which is the original but I like the way this one goes it says Rock of Ages cleff for me let me hide myself in thee let
