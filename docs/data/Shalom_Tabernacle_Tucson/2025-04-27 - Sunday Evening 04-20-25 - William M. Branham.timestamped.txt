[9:42] come and open our service tonight with a
[9:43] word of prayer?
[9:45] [Music]
[9:54] It's on.
[9:56] It's always a privilege to come up here
[9:58] and being able to say a word of prayer
[10:01] before service, after service, just it's
[10:03] very humbling to stand here and look at
[10:06] everybody. You don't get to see this
[10:07] view often. So, if we can bow our heads.
[10:10] Dear Lord, thank you
[10:12] for this beautiful day that you've given
[10:15] us. Another day to praise your
[10:17] name, fellowship with one another.
[10:21] and reflect upon how you affect our
[10:23] lives spiritually, faithfully, however
[10:26] we need you. We know you're there. Let
[10:28] us partake in the word. Let the let the
[10:32] tapes we hear today be a blessing for
[10:34] us. Let us talk to us and let us
[10:37] understand that our faith is what drives
[10:40] our lives and we put all trust and love
[10:42] in you. Under your name we pray. Amen.
[10:55] There we go. I'm happy to be here
[10:57] tonight. We just sang that the windows
[10:58] of heaven are open, but I always enjoy
[11:01] the Sunday evening service. We sometimes
[11:03] it's it's hard on Sunday morning. We're
[11:05] out of our normal routine. We're not at
[11:07] work. We're not It's It's just It's a
[11:09] little different and it takes a while
[11:11] for us to sometimes just to get get
[11:14] focused. And that's behind us now. And
[11:17] we can recall how God came down in the
[11:19] cool of the evening, visit with Adam.
[11:22] And I just always so look forward to the
[11:24] Sunday night services where God come
[11:26] down and just walk and talk. Walk the
[11:28] aisles, talk with us tonight. You know
[11:30] what we have need of. And Amen. You can
[11:32] be seated if you'd like. We want to sing
[11:34] that song, Key of G. Sister Sharon. He
[11:37] gets sweeter as the days go by. Well, he
[11:41] gets
[11:42] sweeter as the days go by.
[11:46] Oh, it gets
[11:48] sweeter as the moments
[11:52] fly. His love is richer. It's deeper.
[11:57] Oh, it's fuller and it's sweeter. Oh,
[12:01] sweeter, sweeter, sweeter as the days go
[12:04] by. Oh, yes. He gets
[12:09] sweeter as the days go by.
[12:14] It gets
[12:15] sweeter as the moments
[12:19] fly. His love is richer. Oh, it's
[12:24] fuller, deeper, and it's sweeter. Oh,
[12:28] sweeter, sweeter, sweeter. As the days
[12:31] go by, let's sing the first verse now.
[12:34] Well, the more I trust him, the more I
[12:37] love him. Nothing good for me and
[12:41] I. The longer I know him, the better I
[12:44] can show him. I could stop now if I
[12:47] tried. Boy, he gets
[12:50] sweeter as the days go
[12:54] by. Oh, he gets
[12:57] sweeter as the moments
[13:01] fly. His love is richer. Oh, it's
[13:05] deeper. Oh, it's fuller and it's
[13:08] sweeter. It's sweeter. Sweeter, sweeter
[13:12] as the days go
[13:16] by. The moment he saved me, his good
[13:19] grace he gave me. Places love down deep
[13:22] in my
[13:23] heart. His great joy of knowing with him
[13:26] I'm going. And never more from him to
[13:29] depart. For he gets
[13:32] sweeter as the days go by.
[13:37] Yes. It gets
[13:39] sweeter as the moments
[13:43] fly. His love is richer. Oh, deeper is
[13:49] fuller and it's sweeter. Oh, sweeter,
[13:53] sweeter, sweeter as the days go by. Sing
[13:57] it one more time. Oh, it gets
[14:01] sweeter as the days go by.
[14:05] Yes. He gets
[14:08] sweeter as the moments
[14:11] fly. His love is
[14:15] richer, deeper is fuller and it's
[14:19] sweeter. Oh, sweeter, sweeter, sweeter
[14:23] as the days go by.
[14:27] [Music]
[14:29] And as I journey through the land, just
[14:32] singing as I
[14:35] go, pointing souls to
[14:38] Calvary, through the crimson
[14:41] flow. Many arrows pierce my soul from
[14:48] without. But my Lord leads me on and
[14:52] through him. I must win.
[14:56] Oh, I want to see him to look upon his
[15:02] face. Let us sing
[15:05] forever of his saving grace. And on the
[15:10] streets of
[15:12] glory, let me lift my
[15:15] voice. Cares all past at last, ever to
[15:21] rejoice.
[15:23] And when it's service for my Lord, dark
[15:27] may be the
[15:29] night, but I'll cling more close to him.
[15:33] He will give me
[15:36] light. Satan snares me, vex my soul, and
[15:40] turn my thoughts
[15:43] aside. But my Lord goes ahead and leads
[15:48] whatever time.
[15:51] Oh, I want to see him. I want to look
[15:54] upon his
[15:57] face. Let us sing
[16:00] forever of his saving
[16:03] grace. On the streets of glory. Just let
[16:08] me lift my
[16:10] voice. Oh cares all pass. Home at last.
[16:15] Ever to rejoice.
[16:18] And when in valleys low, I look toward
[16:22] the mountain
[16:24] high. And behold, my savior there
[16:29] leading in the
[16:31] fight. With a tender hand outstretched
[16:35] toward the valley
[16:37] long. He's guiding me. I can see as I
[16:43] onward
[16:44] go and know I want to see him. I want to
[16:49] look upon his
[16:52] face there to sing
[16:55] forever of his saving
[16:59] grace on the streets of glory. Just let
[17:04] me lift my
[17:05] voice. Cares all pass home at last. ever
[17:11] too. I love this last verse. When before
[17:15] me billows rise from the mighty
[17:19] deep, then my Lord directs my bar. He
[17:24] does save the
[17:26] king and he leads me gently on through
[17:31] this world
[17:33] below. He's a real friend to me. Oh, I
[17:38] love him so. Yes. Oh, I want to see him.
[17:44] I want to look upon his
[17:47] face. Let us sing
[17:50] forever of his safe and
[17:54] grace on the streets of glory. Just let
[17:59] me lift my
[18:01] voice. Cares all pass. Home at last.
[18:06] ever to
[18:09] rejoice. Somebody can say, "He's a real
[18:12] friend to me." Amen. Amen. Let's go to
[18:15] the key of Eflat if we could, Sister
[18:19] Sharon. Down from his
[18:26] glory, ever
[18:29] living story.
[18:34] My God and
[18:37] Savior
[18:40] came and
[18:42] Jesus was his name.
[18:47] Born in a
[18:53] manger to his own a strangeanger.
[19:01] A man of
[19:04] sorrow,
[19:05] tears
[19:08] [Music]
[19:14] and Oh, how I

[19:21] him. How
[19:23] I
[19:25] adore him.

[19:35] sunshine, my all in all.
[19:42] Well, the
[19:44] grain
[19:48] creator
[19:50] became my
[19:55] savior and all God's
[20:00] [Music]
[20:02] fullness
[20:04] dwell in him. Think of this. What
[20:09] condescension? Word
[20:14] [Music]
[20:16] contention bringing
[20:18] us
[20:23] redemption. That in the dead of
[20:30] night, not one
[20:34] saint inside.
[20:38] God
[20:39] gracious
[20:42] [Music]
[20:44] tender laid
[20:46] aside his
[20:47] [Laughter]
[20:49] [Music]
[20:51] splender
[20:53] stooping to wood to when to
[21:00] save my soul.
[21:06] Oh, how I
[21:09] love
[21:12] him. How
[21:14] I
[21:16] adore
[21:19] him. My breath, my
[21:24] [Music]
[21:26] sunshine. He's my all in all.
[21:34] The
[21:35] great
[21:38] [Music]
[21:40] creator
[21:42] became my
[21:47] savior and all God's
[21:53] fullness
[21:56] dwell in him. The last verse together.
[21:59] Without
[22:00] reluctance and
[22:03] with
[22:07] reluctance, flesh and
[22:10] blood is suess.
[22:15] He took the form of
[22:21] man and
[22:23] revealed the
[22:26] hidden
[22:28] lamb. And oh
[22:31] glorious
[22:35] mystery, the
[22:38] sacrifice of calary.
[22:43] And
[22:44] now I know thou art the
[22:50] great
[22:52] I
[22:53] [Music]
[22:56] am. Oh how I
[23:01] love
[23:03] him. How
[23:06] I
[23:07] adore him.

[23:17] sunshine, my all in
[23:24] all. The
[23:26] great
[23:29] [Music]
[23:31] creator
[23:33] became my
[23:38] savior and all.
[23:41] God's
[23:45] fullness
[23:47] dwell in
[23:49] him. Let's sing that last part. The
[23:52] great creator, the
[23:54] great
[23:59] creator
[24:01] became my
[24:06] savior and all God's
[24:13] fullness

[24:22] I call you
[24:24] holy. Your name is

[25:25] me. I call you righteous. Your name is
[25:31] righteous. Righteous you are and

[27:11] we just say he's awesome and he's all
[27:13] that. Amen. God is so good to us. Let's
[27:16] stand. Brother Joe, if you could come
[27:18] and take the request for us this
[27:23] evening. Brother Joe Galante. I was
[27:25] looking at Joe Robson, but it was
[27:27] Brother Joe Galante. So,
[27:33] [Music]
[27:36] God bless
[27:38] you. Let us all bow our heads and
[27:42] pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're
[27:45] grateful, Lord. We believe we call you
[27:47] all things, Father, that we have heard,
[27:51] Lord, we're thankful for your word that
[27:53] we can hear it in this building tonight,
[27:56] Lord. For it has the power of God unto
[27:59] salvation, Lord Jesus. thankful for what
[28:02] we have learned today Lord that we can
[28:05] speak to the six sense which is faith
[28:08] and faith only feeds upon the word of
[28:10] God. Well, Father, Lord, cause us,
[28:13] Father, to dig deep, Lord, to study and,
[28:17] Father, speak those things that you have
[28:19] given us, Lord. May your Holy Spirit
[28:22] build us up in that most holy faith.
[28:25] Also, Lord Jesus, we're thinking of the
[28:28] our pastor, Lord, that is traveling
[28:30] brother Israel on his way home. Father,
[28:33] we pray that you'd just keep everything
[28:36] safe. Help him through the long journey,
[28:38] Father. Give him the strength he needs
[28:40] after, Lord, two weeks of laboring for
[28:43] you, Lord Jesus. We pray, Lord, that you
[28:46] just fortify him, Lord, in every way
[28:49] that he may need, Lord. And we thank you
[28:52] for him, Lord. We pray for Brother Jim
[28:55] Alexander, Deacon and Mesa, Lord. We
[28:58] pray, Father, that you just raise him
[29:00] up, Lord. We know the enemy is fighting
[29:02] him. His one side of his body, Lord, is
[29:05] paralyzed. But father, we speak healing
[29:08] into his body right now. Father, for
[29:12] Lord, when our five senses and our
[29:15] physical body is saying something
[29:16] contrary to the word of God, we call it
[29:19] a lying vanity. It's just a lie because
[29:22] your word says, Father, that by your
[29:24] stripes, we are healed, Lord. And we
[29:26] speak that for him tonight in the name
[29:29] of Jesus Christ, Lord. Thank you for all
[29:32] things. Take over the service. cause our
[29:35] hearts to lift you up ever more. Father,
[29:38] in the precious name of Jesus Christ, we
[29:40] ask it.
[29:49] Amen. Oh, there is
[29:55] nothing. Oh, there's nothing.
[30:02] There is
[30:04] nothing our God can
[30:12] do.
[30:16] Miracles and
[30:21] wonders. There is nothing.
[30:25] Oh,
[30:27] nothing that my
[30:30] God can
[30:34] do. Amen. Before we start the tape, you
[30:38] can have your seats if you if you'd
[30:40] like. And brother Joe at the end of
[30:43] service this morning, he got up and just
[30:46] mentioned something in in in general
[30:49] that before brother Brandham started
[30:50] talking about the five senses, he was
[30:53] just saying, you know, now just talking
[30:55] to my group here and and I had made a
[30:57] note of if you go back and look, it's
[30:59] paragraph 39, but this really stepped on
[31:02] my toes and is something that you you
[31:04] feel like you're
[31:06] maybe moving on and then and then God
[31:09] comes and corrects you. And he's like,
[31:10] "No, what you're thinking isn't what I'm
[31:13] thinking, and there's a higher plane for
[31:14] you to walk on." And so this paragraph
[31:17] 39 on there says, he says, "No matter
[31:21] when anyone says evil, return good.
[31:24] Don't think evil. If you do think evil
[31:26] and you're just hypocritically saying
[31:28] it, then you're wrong. You just keep on
[31:32] consecrating yourself to God until you
[31:34] really feel good to that person. That's
[31:36] the way to do it. Then the sweetness of
[31:38] God's blessings will just oh, it'll just
[31:40] cover your soul. That's the way to live
[31:42] victorious. Then nothing can harm you as
[31:45] long as you're in love. Amen. I can look
[31:48] at myself and say, you know, there's a
[31:49] lot of times where it's just lip service
[31:51] and you're trying to keep the right
[31:52] attitude. You're saying the right things
[31:54] and but I know my heart. And God looks
[31:56] at our heart and it's something that
[31:59] you're holding some bitterness. You're
[32:00] holding a grudge and it's like, Lord,
[32:03] that's wrong. help me just continue to
[32:05] to pray for that situation, pray for
[32:07] that person until this is the result
[32:10] that's coming forth in my life. How many
[32:12] can just say that's your desire tonight
[32:14] as well? Amen. Maybe before we start the
[32:18] second half of this service, the key of
[32:20] G.
[32:23] At night I lay in
[32:26] bed and I begin to
[32:35] cry. And my mind just fails to
[32:40] know
[32:42] exactly why.
[32:48] I can't
[32:50] explain with tongue or
[32:53] pin the spirit's
[32:56] groanings deep
[32:59] within. It must be
[33:03] gone here in my soul cuz I feel the
[33:09] pull. Yield yourself to him tonight. I
[33:13] feel the pull.
[33:19] I hear the
[33:25] call and I know his
[33:28] spirit's moving me to give my all.
[33:38] He speaks to
[33:44] me and I
[33:50] agree. Oh Lord, please come and take
[33:57] control. I feel the
[34:01] P. Second verse. I went to hear the
[34:03] word. I went to hear the
[34:08] word and with each
[34:11] line and
[34:16] phrase he was calling me to
[34:23] give a higher praise.
[34:29] Oh, there's a
[34:32] deep called to the deep. Just like a
[34:38] great magnet pull in me. Oh, I know for
[34:45] sure I'll reach the
[34:48] goal. I feel the pull. Maybe we just
[34:52] raise our hands to him as we sing this
[34:54] chorus. I feel the
[35:01] P. I hear the
[35:08] call. And I know his
[35:11] spirit's moving me to give my
[35:20] all. He speaks to me.
[35:24] [Music]
[35:27] And
[35:28] I
[35:31] [Music]
[35:33] agree. Oh
[35:35] Lord, please come and take
[35:40] control. I feel the
[35:43] pull. Maybe the musicians should just
[35:46] play it one time before we start the
[35:47] tape.
[35:51] [Music]
[36:13] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[36:17] [Music]
[36:28] Jesus.
[36:31] [Music]
[36:58] [Music]
[37:20] Hallelujah.
[37:29] [Music]
[37:44] Hallelujah. Heat. Heat.
[37:52] [Music]
[38:54] Heat. Hey. Hey.
[38:58] [Music]
[40:12] God bless you saints. Sure to be in
[40:14] church with each one one of you tonight.
[40:16] Let's all stand and we'll sing only
[40:17] believe and we'll finish this tape.
[40:20] We've heard about and listened to and
[40:22] believed super signs and super sense and
[40:25] faith tonight.
[40:27] Amen. Only
[40:31] believe.
[40:33] Only
[40:34] [Music]
[40:36] believe.
[40:38] Only believe.
[40:43] All things are
[40:47] possible. Yes.
[40:50] Only
[40:53] believe.
[40:55] Only
[40:59] believe.
[41:01] Only
[41:04] believe. All things are possible.
[41:11] only
[41:15] baby. Amen. You can be seated, brother
[41:22] Brandham. That's super sense. It's super
[41:26] above the senses. It's a greater sense.
[41:29] It's a faith. It's a power that stares
[41:33] and draws.
[41:35] Hallelujah. Amen. Oh, praise God. It's
[41:39] something he makes you do things that
[41:40] you never thought you would
[41:42] do. It's the six sense, the super sense.
[41:47] You get prayed for. Say you got got a
[41:49] crippled hand. You get prayed for your
[41:51] hand. You come up there and you believe
[41:53] that God's going to heal you. The pastor
[41:55] prays for you. You go back. The old
[41:58] natural man will say this. You don't
[42:00] feel any different in that hand. You're
[42:02] no better than what you ever was. But
[42:04] the six sense comes along and said,
[42:05] "That's a lie.
[42:08] You've been prayed for. That settles it.
[42:14] Amen. Like a woman had come to a meeting
[42:16] one time and she come to a meeting. Two
[42:19] of them. They crossed the platform.
[42:21] They'd seen the
[42:22] discernments. Them women were just just
[42:26] swallowed up. They were both real
[42:29] Christians.
[42:31] one come up and the spirit came and
[42:34] said, "You are suffering with a stomach
[42:38] trouble and her face lit up." She said,
[42:41] "That's
[42:42] true." Uh, and the Holy Spirit said to
[42:45] me, he said, "And it's an ulcer. It's
[42:48] caused from a nervous condition. You've
[42:51] been examined by a certain doctor." And
[42:53] he said that you could not have that. I
[42:56] had to have an operation, have it cut
[42:58] out. She said every word of that is the
[43:01] truth. And then seeing she's such a
[43:03] great believer. Then it said your name
[43:06] is miss so and so. You come from so and
[43:08] so and such and such a place. She said
[43:11] that is the truth.
[43:14] But was it the six sense catching it?
[43:17] Amen. The six sense and the holy spirit
[43:20] was standing side by side. The holy
[43:23] spirit was speaking. The six sense was
[43:24] saying amen. There it is. Something has
[43:27] to happen. Hallelujah.
[43:32] When
[43:33] Martha run out to find
[43:37] Jesus and when she said, "Lord, what's
[43:40] the six sense? If thou would have been
[43:43] here, my brother would not have
[43:45] died. But even now, whatever you ask
[43:48] God, God will give it to you."
[43:51] There's the six sense. Hallelujah. Jesus
[43:54] pulled himself together and said, "I am
[43:56] the resurrection and life." He that
[43:59] believeth in me, though he were dead,
[44:02] yet shall he live. Amen.
[44:05] Whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[44:07] shall never die. Believest thou this.
[44:10] What are you going to say? Reasoning
[44:12] there's a man laying on a dead and the
[44:14] worms is crawling through him. But he's
[44:17] just got through saying he was the
[44:19] resurrection and the life.
[44:22] That's God's word.
[44:24] That's six sense. Beyond the doctor's
[44:27] care, beyond the thoughts of scientific
[44:29] research, defile defy all reasonings and
[44:33] casts them down.
[44:35] [Applause]
[44:36] It's witness into God's word. I am not I
[44:40] will be, I was, I am now.
[44:44] Resurrection.
[44:46] Amen.
[44:48] He that believeth in me, though he were
[44:50] dead, yet he shall live, and whosoever
[44:53] liveth and believeth in me shall never
[44:54] die. Believest thou this? He said, "Yay,
[44:57] Lord." Six sense,
[45:00] I believe that you are the son of God
[45:03] that should come into the world.
[45:07] Hallelujah. Thy brother shall rise
[45:09] again. Oh, amen. Oh my. To the grave
[45:14] they went.
[45:16] them two together, something had to
[45:19] happen. That was a super sense with God
[45:22] standing present. Something had to take
[45:26] place. The sense was super sense was
[45:29] God. There was something telling Martha
[45:31] that she had seen him. She knew him. She
[45:35] didn't recognize him to be the very
[45:37] Messiah. And she know if she could only
[45:40] get to him, if she could only get close
[45:43] to him and present the case.
[45:47] Just hear one promise come from him.
[45:49] That's all she wanted.
[45:53] When he said, "I am the resurrection
[45:55] life. Ye that believeth in me, though he
[45:58] were dead." That's all Martha wanted to
[45:59] hear.
[46:01] all she wanted because the sixth sense,
[46:04] the super sense, her faith was moving
[46:06] her to confess him, believe
[46:10] him. This woman when she left the
[46:12] platform, it was thus sayaeth the Lord,
[46:16] go home and eat. Jesus Christ makes you
[46:20] well. Lord, she went home. That night, a
[46:26] friend of hers living in the
[46:28] neighborhood was third or fourth behind
[46:30] her, and she had a big knot on her
[46:33] neck. And here she come all thrilled
[46:38] about her. Her neighbor was going to be
[46:40] healed. That ulcer that had bothered her
[46:42] so much. This is one of the hundreds of
[46:44] cases, thousands of them. And this big
[46:48] knot sticking out on her neck. And she
[46:50] come up. I said, "No one would have to
[46:52] discern
[46:53] that." But you're happy about something.
[46:56] You've been thrilled because that woman
[46:58] sitting over yonder is a neighbor of
[47:01] yours. Holy Spirit, she thought, "How in
[47:04] the world could that man know that? It
[47:07] has to be something to reveal it to
[47:09] you."
[47:11] So when that was said, it said, "You're
[47:14] thinking about your neck?" "Yes." "Do
[47:17] you believe it'll leave?" "I believe
[47:19] it." She said with all my heart, I said,
[47:22] "Thus sayaeth the
[47:25] Lord, go home and you will receive your
[47:29] healing." The natural man looked around
[47:32] and couldn't see no
[47:35] sign. The woman with the ulcer went home
[47:37] and tried to eat and my she liked to
[47:41] died. Oh, the natural man, the natural
[47:44] sense of feeling still declared the
[47:47] ulcer there.
[47:49] So after about a week or two had passed,
[47:54] she went to the neighborhood to all of
[47:56] her people in the church testifying,
[47:58] "The Lord has healed
[48:01] me." And they said, "Are you eating
[48:04] now?" "No, not exactly everything I
[48:07] want." But she said, "I'm already
[48:09] healed. For by his stripes I am healed."
[48:15] No matter what it was, she's healed
[48:16] anyhow.
[48:19] One morning the children had gone to
[48:22] school and she got real hungry. She was
[48:25] standing washing the dishes by the
[48:27] window. She came to the meeting another
[48:29] meeting about a year later and she was
[48:32] washing the
[48:33] dishes and when she uh first thing she
[48:36] felt a real funny feeling go
[48:40] over and she thought what was that? Felt
[48:43] like I wanted to
[48:45] scream. And her husband had told her
[48:48] said, "Honey, you quit talking about
[48:51] that healing that because although he
[48:54] was a Christian, said you're bringing a
[48:56] reproach upon the cause." How can you
[48:59] bring a reproach when you're testifying
[49:02] to his word?
[49:04] Amen.
[49:05] You bring a reproach if you don't
[49:07] testify to it. Amen.
[49:10] Said if you were healed, you were
[49:11] healed. He said that man stood and
[49:14] looked me in the eye and told me my
[49:17] conditions and the things that I had
[49:19] done and who I was and where I had come
[49:21] from. She said I hadn't been the
[49:24] building 15 minutes when he come to the
[49:26] platform. How in the world could this
[49:29] man know that I never saw him in my life
[49:32] and he told me thus sayeth the Lord.
[49:36] Amen. You're healed. And she said, "I'll
[49:40] believe it until I'm dead."
[49:44] She said, "I'll believe it anyhow."
[49:48] So her and her sister bel friend had
[49:52] covenant to God that they'd hold that
[49:54] faith. That morning she felt real
[49:57] funny. And in a few minutes, she got
[50:00] hungry. So the children had left some
[50:02] oats in a plate, a little dish, and
[50:06] said, "Oats always just burn her up. If
[50:08] anybody ever had an officer, you know
[50:10] what it is." So she reached down and
[50:12] took a couple bites of those oats. Oh
[50:15] my. She said, "I I have to pay for it, I
[50:18] suppose, but one of these days I'll be
[50:20] all right." But she noticed she was
[50:22] still hungry. So she just finished up
[50:26] the dish. She waited a few minutes. See
[50:29] what happened? Nothing happened. Felt
[50:32] good. Still hungry. She fried her a
[50:34] couple eggs and poured her a cup of
[50:35] coffee and got some toast and had her
[50:37] real jubilee. She just ate all she could
[50:40] eat. She went ahead washing the dishes
[50:43] and about a half hour later she was
[50:45] hungry again. Hallelujah. No ill
[50:48] effects. She put on her little bonnet
[50:50] and down the street she went into this
[50:52] neighbor's house and when she got there
[50:54] she heard she thought there'd been a
[50:56] death baby in her family. They were
[50:58] screaming and shouting and walking
[50:59] around. The woman had slept late that
[51:02] morning and got
[51:03] up looking for the growth that was on
[51:06] her neck and it had disappeared during
[51:08] the night. Hallelujah.
[51:11] Praise God. What was it?
[51:14] God at
[51:15] work up here at Kat Tabernacle when we
[51:18] had that meeting. That crippled boy that
[51:21] come in there and was prayed for.
[51:24] many of us there to see
[51:27] him. They brought him back in that
[51:29] emergency room. Billy led me to him.
[51:32] They had him on a platform for three or
[51:34] four nights or on the in the building.
[51:36] He didn't get a prayer card, so they put
[51:38] him in the emergency room. I went in and
[51:40] prayed for him. Looked at him. He said,
[51:42] "Mr. Brandon, can you tell me some
[51:45] consolation?" I said, "Yes, sir, son.
[51:48] Holio got you this way." He said,
[51:50] "That's right." I said, 'Your name is
[51:52] such and such and come from a certain
[51:54] place.' That's right. He said, he said,
[51:56] 'What about my healing? I said, by his
[51:59] stripes you were healed.
[52:03] He went home testifying, giving God
[52:05] praise, and he brought such a reproach
[52:08] they claimed in the neighborhood until
[52:10] one Sunday a group of ministers come in
[52:12] and sat down by him and said, "You must
[52:15] stop doing that. You're bringing
[52:18] reproach upon the cause." And the young
[52:21] man sitting there said, "Mister, if you
[52:24] were sitting where I am, if you were in
[52:27] the chair that I'm sitting in, you
[52:30] wouldn't try to rob me of the last hope
[52:32] I got in Christ.
[52:35] That by his stripes I am healed." And he
[52:39] no more said that, sitting there,
[52:41] paralyzed, feet, hands, body, back. And
[52:47] no more than he sat there and out of the
[52:49] chair he went glorifying God.
[52:52] Hallelujah.
[52:53] But his natural senses said he'll sit
[52:56] there. The doctor said he'll be there
[52:59] forever or as long as he lives. But the
[53:02] six sense says by his stripes I am
[53:05] healed.
[53:07] And he wouldn't have nothing to do. It's
[53:09] casting away everything contrary to what
[53:11] God said. That's what the six sense is
[53:15] for.
[53:17] Old John Ryan, not the R Yn or RH
[53:22] YN. That was the blind beggar Fort
[53:26] Wayne. There where we went that day and
[53:29] he was prayed for in the
[53:32] meeting. That was the night before the
[53:34] piano played the great position. Now
[53:36] he's near without anybody
[53:38] by. And when he was blind, he's Catholic
[53:42] by faith. And he he stopped in the line
[53:44] and I looked at him and I said, "Your
[53:47] name is so and so, John Ryan." "Yes,
[53:50] you're a beggar on the corner. You've
[53:52] been blind for years." "Yes, that's
[53:54] right. You're a Catholic by faith."
[53:55] "That's right." I said, "Thus sayaeth
[53:58] the Lord, you receive your
[54:01] healing." Said, "Thank you, sir." I
[54:03] said, "Thank the Lord." He said, "But I
[54:05] can't see." I said, "That has nothing to
[54:07] do with
[54:08] it. You are healed."
[54:11] And he said uh he went down along to
[54:14] helped him off the platform. The natural
[54:16] man couldn't see
[54:18] nothing. They couldn't see no results
[54:20] from that at all. Why? I said he's just
[54:23] as blind as he ever was. So two of his
[54:26] friends brought him back and put him in
[54:27] the prayer line again and run him
[54:29] through again. Hired let him pass
[54:31] through. When he come back again, he
[54:33] said, "Mister, you told me I was
[54:35] healed." I said, "You told me you
[54:38] believe
[54:39] me." He said, "I do believe you. I have
[54:43] no reasons not to believe you." Said,
[54:46] "You've told me all things in my
[54:49] life." And he said, "I don't know what
[54:51] to do." Said, "There was a woman back
[54:53] there testifying she had a daughter a
[54:55] few minutes ago and it's gone away." I
[54:58] said, "Then if you believe me, why are
[55:00] you questioning me? I'm telling you the
[55:02] word of God." He said, "What must I do,
[55:05] sir?" knowing he was Catholic and had to
[55:07] have something physical and he told you.
[55:10] I said just keep testifying by his
[55:13] stripes I am healed and give him praise.
[55:17] The old man for the next two weeks or
[55:20] three he stood on the corner and he sold
[55:22] papers. He would holler extra extra
[55:25] praise the Lord I'm healed. Extra extra
[55:29] praise the Lord I'm healed.
[55:32] When he come back to the meeting the
[55:33] next night I couldn't hardly preach for
[55:34] him. He'd raised another. Everybody keep
[55:37] quiet. Praise the Lord for healing me.
[55:40] Praise the Lord for healing me.
[55:42] Hallelujah. As a Catholic, he didn't
[55:44] know how to take a hold of faith. But he
[55:46] know if he kept on saying it, kept on
[55:48] kept on kept on until that sick saints
[55:51] would go to work. That's right.
[55:55] Praise the Lord for healing me. You
[55:58] stand on the corner. Praise the Lord for
[55:59] healing me
[56:01] extra. Praise the Lord for healing me.
[56:03] And he walked down the street and there
[56:04] somebody come say, "How are you, John?
[56:06] Praise the Lord for healing me." "All
[56:08] right." And they laughed at him and made
[56:10] fun of him. And another little news boy
[56:13] led him over to the barber shop for a
[56:15] shave about two or three weeks later
[56:18] from the meeting. And that barber put
[56:20] him up in the chair and lthered his
[56:22] face. And he said,
[56:23] "John," he said, "I understand, some
[56:26] little smart addict." And he said, "I
[56:29] understand that you was down to see the
[56:31] divine healer when
[56:34] here. He said, "Yes, I went down." He
[56:37] said, "I understand that you got healed
[56:40] just to make fun of him." And the old
[56:42] man said, "Yes, praise the Lord. He
[56:44] healed me." And his eyes come open.
[56:48] Amen. Out of that barber chair, he went
[56:50] with a towel around his neck. The barber
[56:52] trying to catch him with a razor in his
[56:54] hand. And down the street they went.
[56:57] Amen.
[57:00] God's word had went to work. Hallelujah.
[57:04] Little Georgie Carter laying down under
[57:06] which you all know some people share
[57:09] close. Laid there for 9 years and 8
[57:11] months. Couldn't even nothing but pull a
[57:13] draw sheet from under from the kidneys
[57:16] and bows. She weighed some 35 pounds
[57:21] laying under Miltown, Indiana. and our
[57:24] people belong to a church that when I
[57:26] went to hold a meeting there at the
[57:27] Milltown Baptist Church and praying for
[57:29] the sick. That church said, "If any
[57:32] member of this congregation attends that
[57:34] fanatic, we'll excommunicate him." And
[57:37] her father was a
[57:38] deacon. But she'd got my little book
[57:41] called Jesus the same yesterday and
[57:43] forever. Brother Hall, take me to her
[57:45] one afternoon. Her mother run out of the
[57:47] house. Wouldn't have nothing to do with
[57:48] it. I went in and prayed for her. Said,
[57:51] "Well, how about that male girl?" She'd
[57:53] know about the vision. I said, "That was
[57:55] a vision, sister. I can only pray. You
[57:57] have faith." The poor little thing had
[57:59] been caught against it. A few days from
[58:01] then, I was standing up there baptizing.
[58:04] She was down there crying, which
[58:06] promised that she'd come and be
[58:08] rebaptized again in the name of Jesus
[58:10] Christ if God would only heal her. There
[58:13] she old legs just about size of a
[58:15] broomstick.
[58:17] They couldn't even put her on a bed pan.
[58:19] Her mother yet a young woman sat there
[58:21] broke with pausing gayheaded from
[58:23] watching her daughter laying there dying
[58:25] by inches to bark the female glands and
[58:28] went all the way through her. She
[58:30] weighed some 37 lbs I think it was. They
[58:33] judged her couldn't raise her up high
[58:35] enough to put the blood pen on her. Had
[58:36] to pull a draw sheet from under a rubber
[58:38] one. Nine years and eight months she'd
[58:41] lay there not even able to raise her
[58:42] head to see a tree that was by the
[58:44] window. One day standing back up on top
[58:48] of the hillside at George
[58:49] Wrights, the Holy Spirit said to me,
[58:52] "Rise to your feet." I was looking there
[58:54] as a light shining out through a dogwood
[58:56] tree said, "Go by the way of rights or
[58:58] go by the way of Carter." When I got
[59:01] there, the Lord Jesus had showed her
[59:03] mother a sign that I was coming. Walked
[59:05] into that girl laying there on that
[59:08] bed so weak that she couldn't even raise
[59:11] a spewment cup. Her mother would hold it
[59:13] just trying to spit in the sputum and
[59:16] cup with the TV. I said, "Sister
[59:18] Georgie, Jesus Christ, the son of God,
[59:21] let me yonder in the wilderness about a
[59:23] half hour ago and told me to come lay
[59:25] hands on you. Thus sayeth the Lord,
[59:28] stand on your feet." The six sense went
[59:31] to work. A power struck that girl for
[59:34] the first time in three year or nine
[59:37] years and in eight months she'd ever
[59:39] been on her feet. Jumped to her feet
[59:41] running to the yards and blessing the
[59:43] trees and the grass and everything and
[59:45] went in and set out the piano begin to
[59:47] play. There is a fountain filled with
[59:50] blood drawn from Emanuel's name.
[59:53] Why reasons would have cast down? She
[59:56] couldn't do it. I don't know now. I'll
[59:59] never know. only the power of God that
[1:00:01] held her up. Her legs wasn't that big
[1:00:03] around up here at the joints.
[1:00:06] Nothing like just like
[1:00:07] broomsticks. That's been some 12 years
[1:00:10] ago or 14. And today she's strong and
[1:00:14] healthy going for the glory Jesus. What
[1:00:17] was it? The first time there wasn't
[1:00:19] nothing seemed to happen, but reasoning
[1:00:22] would have said it couldn't happen. But
[1:00:23] brother, she held on to that word. If
[1:00:26] God could take that crippled girl up
[1:00:28] there at Salem, that nailed girl had
[1:00:30] been crippled and paralyzed. Her arms
[1:00:31] hung down like that could heal her, she
[1:00:33] could heal her, too. She believed it.
[1:00:36] Brother Hall laying down her dying with
[1:00:38] a cancer. The same man took me over
[1:00:40] there. His doctor in Miltown sent him up
[1:00:43] to this doctor that in New Albany down
[1:00:46] here that's there to the St. Edwards
[1:00:48] Hospital. I forget. He brought my
[1:00:51] children. Fine man, good doctor. He
[1:00:54] examined said cancer said to Dr. Brown
[1:00:57] down Miltown said he's dying. Dr. Brown
[1:00:59] said I thought so. Tuck him up to his
[1:01:02] sisters down here which is a a relative
[1:01:04] of Mr. Cop used to be the judge in the
[1:01:06] city. And when he got down there said
[1:01:09] just keep him here till he dies. And
[1:01:11] they sent for me to come down. I went
[1:01:14] day after day with my wife back there.
[1:01:16] We prayed for brother Hall. I loved him.
[1:01:18] He'd been one of my converts to Christ.
[1:01:21] And he got lower and lower and he
[1:01:23] couldn't move his hands. Miss Hall said,
[1:01:25] "Billy, is there something you can do?"
[1:01:28] I said, "There's nothing I know, Sister
[1:01:29] Hall, I can't hear a word from the
[1:01:32] Lord." We I said, "I'd like for my
[1:01:34] doctor to look at him." Said, "Who is
[1:01:36] your doctor?" I said, "Dr. Sam Adair."
[1:01:39] And I called Sam. Sam said, "Only thing
[1:01:40] I can send him to Louisville, Billy, for
[1:01:42] X-rays and things." Said, "I'll give you
[1:01:44] the report." They sent an ambulance
[1:01:46] down, picked him up, tuck him, come
[1:01:47] back. Sam called me up and said, "Billy,
[1:01:50] he's got cancer of the liver. We can't
[1:01:53] cut his liver out and him live." Said,
[1:01:56] "He's a preacher. He ought to be all
[1:01:57] right now. You might as well tell him
[1:01:59] he's going." I said, "He's ready to go,
[1:02:01] Sam." But the thing of it is, I just
[1:02:03] hate to see him go. He's my brother and
[1:02:05] I love him. I thought, "Oh, God, do
[1:02:08] something for me." I started to go
[1:02:10] squirrel hunting that morning. I looked
[1:02:11] out before day nobody was out in the
[1:02:13] yard, picked up a rifle, and started the
[1:02:15] house. There was an old rugged looking
[1:02:17] apple hanging on the wall. I thought,
[1:02:20] "Why did me put that on the wall?" I
[1:02:22] looked and another and another and
[1:02:23] another till six of them hung there. I
[1:02:26] jerked off my hat and fell on my knees
[1:02:27] on the floor. Looked up there and then a
[1:02:30] great big beautiful apple come down and
[1:02:32] eat all those apples up. I looked
[1:02:35] standing above there and there's that
[1:02:36] same light hanging on that picture
[1:02:39] yonder standing there milling around
[1:02:41] said, "Stand on your feet. Go tell Mr.
[1:02:45] Thus sayeth the
[1:02:47] Lord, you'll not die but live.
[1:02:51] I went down and told him he wasn't any
[1:02:53] different. But he believed it. He held
[1:02:55] on to it. There was no difference.
[1:02:57] Seemed like a day passed. No difference
[1:02:58] the second day. No difference about the
[1:03:00] third day it started. And here he is a
[1:03:03] living today after years and years.
[1:03:06] Amen. Notice sitting right here, Miss
[1:03:08] Weaver. If I'm not mistaken, when her
[1:03:11] daughter came after the helium RG
[1:03:12] Morgan, I went down there and there
[1:03:15] wasn't nothing that woman could do.
[1:03:16] She'd be dead within the next few hours.
[1:03:19] They had a shot or two they could give
[1:03:20] her and that was all. They had a female
[1:03:23] operation, cancer run through her spine.
[1:03:26] They scattered it when they operated.
[1:03:28] There was nothing to do for the woman. I
[1:03:31] want to talk to her about healing, but
[1:03:32] she said, "Sir, you are a minister of
[1:03:35] the Lord God, and I'm not worthy that
[1:03:39] you would come into my
[1:03:41] house." Counting herself unworthy for a
[1:03:43] minister to come. She said, "I've lived
[1:03:45] a life. I've danced and I've done things
[1:03:48] that I should not have done. I've used
[1:03:50] bad language or whatever more." She told
[1:03:52] me her sins and she said, "I'm not
[1:03:55] worthy of it." I seen she was hitting
[1:03:57] the right line. She'd have to get Christ
[1:03:59] in here before that six super sense
[1:04:01] would ever go to
[1:04:03] work. We knelt down. I talked to her
[1:04:06] about though your sins be a scarlet. She
[1:04:08] gave her life to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:04:11] And when she did, she said, "Oh, oh, I
[1:04:14] feel so different. Something's happened
[1:04:17] to me. Something's happened to me. I
[1:04:19] want to shake hands with all of you."
[1:04:22] Just then, I looked out. I seen her in a
[1:04:24] vision going back behind the house to a
[1:04:25] chicken coop. I said, "Mrs. Weaver, thus
[1:04:29] saith the Lord God, you'll make a trip
[1:04:32] to that chicken coop and you'll live.
[1:04:36] She couldn't go over the way she felt.
[1:04:38] Cancer eat her up. She couldn't go to
[1:04:40] what the doctor said she was dying. And
[1:04:43] that's been, I guess, 14, 15 years ago,
[1:04:46] Miss Weaver. 14 years ago, she staggered
[1:04:50] up to this tabernacle when she was
[1:04:52] simply didn't look like she's able to
[1:04:54] get out of bed.
[1:04:56] little old bony arms because she
[1:04:58] promised God she'd come and be baptized
[1:05:00] in the name of Jesus. We picked her up
[1:05:02] out of a wheelchair almost a chair, took
[1:05:05] her down in the pool and baptized her in
[1:05:07] the name of Jesus. And there she sits
[1:05:09] tonight. Look at her if you want to see
[1:05:11] a species of hell. Why? Hallelujah.
[1:05:14] Casting down reasonings and scientific
[1:05:18] researches and everything else. Amen.
[1:05:20] Because the six sense went to work.
[1:05:24] That's it.
[1:05:26] Look, let me just say this again just
[1:05:28] for a
[1:05:29] minute. Jesus passed by a tree one
[1:05:33] time and it was a fig
[1:05:35] tree and he looked at the fig
[1:05:38] tree. Now, please don't miss
[1:05:42] this. He looked at the fig
[1:05:45] tree and there was no figs on it. And he
[1:05:49] said he cursed the tree and said, "No
[1:05:53] man eat from thee." The disciples looked
[1:05:57] around, tree looked like it always did.
[1:06:00] An hour from that, it still looked the
[1:06:03] same. God never opened up the earth and
[1:06:06] swallowed it
[1:06:07] up. God never sent a barking lightning
[1:06:10] out of the skies and burned it to a
[1:06:12] charcoal. He could have done
[1:06:14] it. Sure, he could.
[1:06:18] He never did those
[1:06:21] things. What did happen? The tree had
[1:06:24] been
[1:06:26] cursed. The faith of God had placed
[1:06:29] against that tree's life. There was
[1:06:31] nothing physical you could see. But way
[1:06:34] down beneath the earth, down in the
[1:06:37] roots of the tree, death was setting
[1:06:41] in. It had been cursed.
[1:06:45] The six sense had come against it. It
[1:06:49] had to die. Amen. Amen. Started dying
[1:06:52] from the roots. That's the same thing
[1:06:55] takes place with a cancer. That's the
[1:06:57] same thing takes place with a tumor.
[1:06:59] That's the same thing takes place with
[1:07:01] any disease.
[1:07:03] When that sick sense of power, but the
[1:07:05] Lord God raises up against it.
[1:07:09] And Satan come out of there. You might
[1:07:12] not see no physical condition happen
[1:07:14] right away, but that faith holds there
[1:07:16] just the same. It's been cursed.
[1:07:20] That six sense won't, that super sense
[1:07:22] won't let it go. It won't pay attention
[1:07:24] to how you feel, how you look, how you
[1:07:26] act. It won't have one thing to do with
[1:07:28] it. God's word's been applied.
[1:07:32] The six sense takes a hold of it. That's
[1:07:35] all. She goes to work. The cancer begins
[1:07:38] to dwell away. It dies from the roots
[1:07:41] and it's gone.
[1:07:44] Certainly by this same forceful six
[1:07:47] sense kingdoms has
[1:07:50] crumbled. Lap one wall against
[1:07:56] another six since the Red Sea pushed
[1:08:01] back. Amen. and a dry ground made a way
[1:08:06] for our children of God to escape on.
[1:08:11] By this same six
[1:08:14] sense,
[1:08:16] Samson defied a thousand Philistines
[1:08:19] armed with armors and spears. Amen.
[1:08:23] He had no way to defend himself but the
[1:08:25] jawbone of a wild mule.
[1:08:28] That six sense went to work. And he beat
[1:08:30] down a thousand Philistines.
[1:08:34] Hallelujah.
[1:08:38] By this six sense,
[1:08:41] the dead's been raised.
[1:08:44] By this six sense, mighty miracles has
[1:08:46] been performed. It's the most powerful
[1:08:49] force that ever hit the earth. Amen. is
[1:08:52] that super
[1:08:53] sense called the six sense has nothing
[1:08:57] to do with this down here. If this down
[1:08:59] here declares it and says amen to it,
[1:09:01] all right, you're moving on. But
[1:09:03] regardless of what this does, believe
[1:09:05] that. Amen. There's where the power if
[1:09:09] you believe in your
[1:09:11] heart. Your fifth sense of thinking lays
[1:09:14] within your
[1:09:16] brain, but your sixth sense lays in your
[1:09:19] heart. Amen. Amen. You believe with your
[1:09:23] heart. Confession is made by the mouth.
[1:09:27] You believe with your heart. Yes,
[1:09:30] sir. That six sense, that powerful
[1:09:33] force.
[1:09:34] Listen. Because of that six
[1:09:39] sense, there was a prophet thrown into a
[1:09:42] lion's
[1:09:44] den. And because of that six sense, the
[1:09:47] lions couldn't eat Daniel.
[1:09:50] Amen.
[1:09:53] They couldn't they couldn't get near him
[1:09:55] because of that six sense.
[1:09:58] That super
[1:10:00] sense by that same six
[1:10:03] sense. Three Hebrew children are sold
[1:10:06] into a fiery furnace and they defied the
[1:10:08] flames of the furnace.
[1:10:11] That six
[1:10:12] sense. All reasons would prove that
[1:10:15] they'd be burnt to death before they got
[1:10:16] to it. But that six sense stayed them in
[1:10:20] there for two or three hours. And when
[1:10:22] they opened the furnace, they seen one
[1:10:23] standing among them like the son of
[1:10:26] God. That's the sixth
[1:10:29] sense. Fires wouldn't burn it. Yes, sir.
[1:10:33] Was that same six sense one time that
[1:10:36] the apostle Peter was laying in
[1:10:39] jail and they were going to beheading
[1:10:42] the next day and down at John Mark's
[1:10:44] house. had a prayer meeting.
[1:10:47] That six sense begin to accumulate
[1:10:49] around that
[1:10:50] jail where he's been covered by prayer.
[1:10:55] That six sense went to work. The pillar
[1:10:58] of far came in the window and touched
[1:11:00] Peter and said, "Come home, get out of
[1:11:02] here."
[1:11:04] The six sense, it was that six sense
[1:11:07] that wouldn't let St. Paul be drowned on
[1:11:09] that mighty sea when that little ship
[1:11:11] was water logged. Amen. It was the six
[1:11:14] sense that kept him from being drowned.
[1:11:16] That super sense. It was that six sense
[1:11:19] that when the serpent bit him on the
[1:11:21] hand, he shook it off in the fire.
[1:11:24] Hallelujah. Amen. It was the six sense
[1:11:27] that did that.
[1:11:29] It was that six sense that raised Jesus
[1:11:32] Christ from the dead after he laid in
[1:11:34] the ground because he believed the word
[1:11:36] of God. Amen. said, "Destroy this body
[1:11:39] and I'll raise it up again on the third
[1:11:41] day. For David said, I'll not leave my
[1:11:44] holy one see corruption, neither will I
[1:11:46] leave your soul in hell." Hallelujah.
[1:11:48] Was that super
[1:11:50] sense? Cast down the reasonings of these
[1:11:53] senses. Believe the super sense, the
[1:11:56] sense of faith that Jesus Christ gives.
[1:12:00] By that same sense, God spoke when there
[1:12:03] was
[1:12:05] nothing. What is that sense?
[1:12:08] That super sense is God.
[1:12:11] The faith of
[1:12:12] God in you, the part of God that comes
[1:12:17] into you gives you the super sense. But
[1:12:21] that same super sense, God framed the
[1:12:25] world together with things which was not
[1:12:28] and did not appear. He spoke his word
[1:12:31] and believed his word and a world shook
[1:12:35] into existence. Hallelujah.
[1:12:39] Hallelujah.
[1:12:41] The six sense, the super sense. Oh God,
[1:12:46] pour it out on me. Amen. Give it to me
[1:12:50] and everyone who needs it. Pour thy six
[1:12:54] sense into me, Lord. I'm willing to
[1:12:57] surrender these five my own knowledge
[1:12:59] thoughts, casting down all reasons.
[1:13:02] Lord, let thy word be true and every
[1:13:04] man's word a lie. Amen. Every reasoning,
[1:13:07] every doubt be cast away and let me walk
[1:13:10] by the super sense. The sense of the
[1:13:13] Holy Spirit.
[1:13:16] Don't you want that? That's the thing
[1:13:18] that we want. God bless you, friends.
[1:13:22] That's what you need.
[1:13:24] That super sense will ask for something.
[1:13:28] And it knows that he'll give it. It's
[1:13:33] persuaded. For he that cometh to God
[1:13:35] must believe that he is and a rewarder
[1:13:38] of those that diligently seek him. If
[1:13:41] the six sense says God keeps his word, I
[1:13:46] give myself to him. I surrender all I
[1:13:48] got to him. My sense says this will
[1:13:50] bring it to pass my faith in God's word
[1:13:53] then call anything else contrary to it
[1:13:55] as though it wasn't.
[1:13:57] Abraham met God and God said, "You're
[1:14:00] going to have a baby by Sarah and him 75
[1:14:03] and her 65." Abraham called everything
[1:14:06] that wasn't God was contrary to that as
[1:14:08] though it wasn't. He walked as if he
[1:14:11] seen God and he he believed. He called
[1:14:14] anything that said that it wasn't any
[1:14:16] reasonings, anything else that the
[1:14:18] doctor might have said, "Well, Abraham,
[1:14:20] you're too old to do that. That don't
[1:14:21] make a bit of difference. What the
[1:14:22] doctor said, what anybody else said,
[1:14:24] what his own mind said, what anything
[1:14:26] else said. God was right.
[1:14:29] He stayed with it. That's the sixth
[1:14:32] sense, the super
[1:14:35] sense. God, give it to
[1:14:37] me. God, let me have more of it to
[1:14:41] minister to his people is my prayer this
[1:14:44] morning. When that mother brought that
[1:14:46] little red-headed baby standing here,
[1:14:48] the tears running down her cheeks, I
[1:14:50] said, "What's the matter, sister?" She
[1:14:52] said, "Brother Brandon, it's got
[1:14:54] leukemia." I felt something rise up.
[1:14:58] Amen. Oh, he's a very present help in a
[1:15:01] time of
[1:15:02] trouble. Remember, not long
[1:15:04] ago, Billy and I was going down the road
[1:15:07] driving. some colored boys come down the
[1:15:10] road and they were driving fast and
[1:15:12] they'd sideswipe the car and turned
[1:15:13] around and around and around and throw
[1:15:15] boys all over the road and one little
[1:15:17] fellow was pinned under the car with his
[1:15:19] back laying against the car. The boys
[1:15:23] jumped out and started to raise it up.
[1:15:24] He said, "Oh, please don't. My back is
[1:15:27] breaking. Don't you kill me. You'll kill
[1:15:29] me. Don't do it." And they said, "Oh,
[1:15:32] we've got to get it off if he's catching
[1:15:33] a
[1:15:35] fire. Don't move it. You mashing me to
[1:15:38] death. Don't do it. Don't do
[1:15:40] it. I holler there, son. Are you a
[1:15:44] Christian? He said, "No, sir." I said,
[1:15:47] "You better
[1:15:48] pray." He said, "Yes,
[1:15:51] sir." The six sense went to work, walked
[1:15:55] right around behind the car, and I'll
[1:15:56] never know till the judgment. But all of
[1:15:59] a sudden, that car flicked over and was
[1:16:01] off of him, and he jumped up and was all
[1:16:03] right. What was it? a present help in a
[1:16:06] time of trouble.
[1:16:09] Hallelujah.
[1:16:11] We were coming down from a a young
[1:16:13] colored lady was driving a car in the
[1:16:15] road, New Plymouth about 400 miles on
[1:16:18] it. She had been driving a pretty good
[1:16:20] speed and I seen the car drove it crank
[1:16:22] past shaft all the way into the tree.
[1:16:25] Billy and I stopped them in a snowy
[1:16:27] slick road ahead of us, but it was dry
[1:16:29] there. And the girl, the wind's blowing
[1:16:31] so hard up in Minnesota, tell it to blow
[1:16:33] the car off. You remember, Billy? I run
[1:16:36] down there to her and there she's
[1:16:37] sitting there. She said, "Oh, I'm dying.
[1:16:38] I'm dying." They called the ambulance.
[1:16:41] Ambulance come. And they had a dead man
[1:16:43] laying in the back of the ambulance. He
[1:16:44] said, "I can't take her." And so the
[1:16:46] farmer said, "Well, send somebody else
[1:16:48] quick. The woman's dying." I walked up
[1:16:50] there and I said, "Lady, just a minute."
[1:16:53] She said, "Oh, don't touch me, sir.
[1:16:55] Don't touch me my back." I said, "Lady,
[1:16:58] are you a Christian?" She looked at me
[1:17:01] and I said, "I'm a minister of the
[1:17:03] gospel. If you're dying, how is it with
[1:17:05] you and God?" She said, "Sir, I want to
[1:17:08] be right now." And the six saints went
[1:17:10] to work. Hallelujah. The power of God
[1:17:14] came down.
[1:17:16] She could walk out of the car without
[1:17:18] anybody helping her. The power of God
[1:17:21] present, the very present help. In a
[1:17:24] time of trouble, we walk by faith. We
[1:17:27] live by faith. The just shall live by
[1:17:30] faith. We must live that way. Yeah. How
[1:17:34] many would like to have more of the six
[1:17:37] super sense?
[1:17:38] Let us bow our heads and while we
[1:17:44] pray. Precious Lord, our God and our
[1:17:49] father, thou art so good to us.
[1:17:53] You give us five senses to live by and
[1:17:56] to walk by in this earth or to or to
[1:18:00] touch the earth. We can feel things
[1:18:02] that's that's to be felt with our hands.
[1:18:06] Tangible things. You give us hearing
[1:18:10] that we can hear. We're so glad of that
[1:18:14] that we can hear the word of God. And by
[1:18:16] that faith cometh by hearing, hearing
[1:18:20] the word of God. We're thankful for
[1:18:24] these six senses. Lord, may we maintain
[1:18:27] them all the days of our life. But may
[1:18:29] this super sense, may the sense of faith
[1:18:33] that belongs to the believer because he
[1:18:36] has to have it in order to believe.
[1:18:39] Lord, give us more of it. Oh, purge it,
[1:18:42] Lord, and try us and fill us with thy
[1:18:45] goodness and thy
[1:18:47] power. Let us walk all the days of our
[1:18:49] life by the six sense, by the sense of
[1:18:53] faith that's only given by Jesus Christ,
[1:18:56] that what we pray for, may we believe
[1:18:58] that we receive it, have no doubt in our
[1:19:01] heart, and you promised that it would
[1:19:04] come to pass. These who had their hands
[1:19:07] up, Lord, I'm praying for them. They had
[1:19:10] needs. You know what they were. I pray
[1:19:12] that you'll bring them to pass. Every
[1:19:15] one of them. May it be fulfilled their
[1:19:18] desire. I ask it in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:19:29] Faith in the
[1:19:32] father. Faith in the
[1:19:35] son. Faith in the Holy Ghost. These
[1:19:39] three are
[1:19:41] one. Demons will tremble and sinners
[1:19:46] awake. Faith in Jehovah will anything
[1:19:50] shake.
[1:19:52] Did you ever hear it before? Not without
[1:19:55] the music. Just need faith. Faith in the
[1:19:58] Father, faith in the Son, faith in the
[1:20:02] Holy Ghost. These three are one.
[1:20:06] Demons will tremble and sinners awake.
[1:20:11] Faith in Jehovah makes anything shake.
[1:20:15] Amen. That's right. Oh my precious
[1:20:18] faith. Precious, glorious faith.
[1:20:21] Hallelujah. God, give me faith. By
[1:20:24] faith, Abraham. By faith, Isaac. By
[1:20:28] faith,
[1:20:30] Abel offered unto God a more excellent
[1:20:33] sacrifice than Cain. Him being yet dead
[1:20:36] yet
[1:20:38] testified. Oh, how we need faith. I love
[1:20:42] him. I want more faith. My desire in
[1:20:45] this life and for this new year coming
[1:20:48] is more faith in God. God take away any
[1:20:51] doubt that's in my mind. If there should
[1:20:53] ever arise one, Satan fights at me. He
[1:20:56] fights at you. He tries to shoot his
[1:20:58] arrows, but may I have that shield of
[1:21:00] faith always before me to withstand the
[1:21:04] ws of the devil to but to knock off his
[1:21:07] fiery darts is my sincere prayer. God
[1:21:10] bless you. Anything you say?
[1:21:14] We need to
[1:21:33] announce. Can you say amen tonight,
[1:21:35] church? Amen. If you've got something on
[1:21:38] your heart, on your mind, hold that
[1:21:39] before him as we sing Have Faith in God.
[1:21:41] He said, "Cast down reasonings and
[1:21:44] science. Let's have faith in him." The
[1:21:47] most powerful forth. He called it the
[1:21:49] six sense.

[1:37:56] I was
[1:37:57] blind, but
[1:37:59] now I see. It was grace that taught my
[1:38:03] heart. It was
[1:38:05] grace that taught my

[1:39:41] soon, the
[1:39:43] earth shall
[1:39:45] soon
[1:39:47] dissolve like
[1:39:49] snow. The
