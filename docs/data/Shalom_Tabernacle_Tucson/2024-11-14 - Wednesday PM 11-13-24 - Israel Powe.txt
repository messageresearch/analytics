evening in the precious name of of our Lord and savior it's so good to see some survivors still standing from the meetings God bless each of you so happy to be in the house of the Lord with you tonight we're going to listen to a portion of the message the rejected King in this message brother brandom I believe it's the first time that he's giving his testimony of going beyond the curtain of time and he's dealing with that and so that really kind of capped our meetings off at the end there um brother petley spoke on God being rich in Mercy but God and our dear brother durksen did a wonderful job on spiritual idolatry brother Ferguson brought on how the Revelation that we receive it's something that's already revealed but then we get a revelation of that God promises and then God fulfills it on Saturday night and Sunday morning the the new creation of God in us and I was really blessed all of the word really blessed me and then Sunday night what manner of love is this as brother Bill lingard brought that to us and that little portion of perfect love and entering over there and that's really our goal and our achievement in our life and we really want to focus in on that and this was a real experience and so because of this experience we as Believers we can't preach a funeral like the rest of the world we know what happens when a Believer dies we know there's a holding place there's a place that's called beyond the curtain of time and brother Randon went there and I believe he did and he's given the testimony of that tonight how many look forward to that we've heard it before we're going to hear it again so God bless you as we prepare to go there he's going to be taking his scripture out of Samuel chapter 8 and uh I believe it's is verse number 18 for those of you that like to follow along and take those notes and as we prepare to go there paragraph 39 through paragraph 171 just about an hour or so of teaching and then he goes into that experience only believe only believe only believe only believe that all things are [Music] possible believe only believe only believe all things are possible oh can we our hands and say Lord I believe oh Lord I believe that's my confession tonight oh Lord I believe your word I believe you Lord all things are possible Lord I believe Lord I believe [Music] Lord I believe all things are possible amen I be amen let's remain standing as soon as the scripture is read then you can be seated God bless you brother Brandon I have for the glory of the Lord now have you got your Bible for the reading eth chapter of Samuel and I promised Jean to stay back there to record the rest of this we were just beginning to in our meeting nevertheless the people refus to obey the voice of Samuel and they said nay but we will have a king over us that we may be like the nation All Nations and that our King May judge us and go out before us and fight our battles Samuel heard all these words of the people and rehearse them in the ears of the Lord and the Lord said to Samuel hearken into their voice and make them a king and Samuel said unto the man of Israel go ye every man to his City now if I should try to choose from this this morning what I would call a text for the next few minutes I would like to choose the text of the the rejected King it was a time that is in all times that people has never wanted God to lead them they want their own way of leadership and this story this morning and when you go to your home it would be good for you to read it all the way through through it was during the time of the the days of Samuel the man of God the prophet and he had been a just man and a good man honorable reputable true and honest with the people never deceiving them and telling them nothing but straight thus saith the Lord but the people had come to a place where they wanted to change this program they had looked upon the Philistines and the amalekites Amorite haites and the other nations of the world and they had seen that they had kings that rule them and govern them and guided them and fought their battles and so forth and this seemed to be that Israel wanted to pattern themselves like these Kings like these people but it has never been in any age God's intention for his people to act like the people of the world or to be governed or controlled like the people of the world God's people is always has been uh A peculiar people a different people a called out are separated are allog together different in their act action in their ways in their manner of living than what the peoples of the world has their appetites for things and all that their makeup is has been always contrary to the things that the people of the world desire and the people of Israel came to Samuel and said now you're getting old and your sons do not walk in your way because they wasn't true like Samuel they were briers and takers of money and they said Samuel your boys is not like you so we want you to go out and to find us a king and anoint him and make us a people like the rest of the the peoples of the world and Samuel tried to tell them that that would not work he said if you do that the first thing you know you'll find that he'll call all your sons from your home and make soldiers out of them to run before his Chariot and bear armors and Spears not only that but he'll call your daughters to make Bakers of bread and take them away from you to feed the Army and said besides all that he'll take a certain taxes off of you of your grain and all your income he'll tax all of that to make certain government uh uh debts and so forth it'll have to be paid he said I think you are all to together making a mistake but when the people said but we still want to be like the rest of the people there's something about man and women that they long to be like one another and there has only been one man ever lived on Earth that was our example and that was the one that died for us all our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he was a perfect example of what we should be always about the father's business and doing that which is right and no matter how much that Samuel tried to persuade the people continually they went after him day and night we want a king we want a man we want a man that we can say this is our guide and that has never been the will of God it never was the will of God or never will be the will of God for man to rule over one another amen God rules over men man God is our ruler our King and it's a very very much of a Peril of today because that man seems to have that same idea they don't seem to be able to grasp that God still rules man instead of man ruling man so they chose themselves a man named Saul which was the son of Kish and he was a reputable man an honorable man but he suited the people just right because he was a great tall Noble statue of a man the scripture said he was Head and Shoulders above any man in Israel he was kingly looking and he was handsome in the face he was a brilliant and an extraordinary man now that's the kind of man that the people like to choose today the people does not seem to be satisfied with the way that God placed his church to be governed and controlled by the Holy Spirit they want somebody some man some denomination some certain peoples to govern the church that they're not able to throw themselves completely into God's hand to be spiritual to be led by the Holy Spirit they want somebody to do their religion for them somebody that will tell them just how to do it and all about it so this man seemed to suit the place exactly because he was a very intellectual man and it's a whole lot like today we like to choose such people to to control our churches to control the Church of God nothing that I have to say against it but just merely to make a point that it is not it was not and it will never be the will of God for such to be God is the rule his people to govern each individual amen then we find that this son of Kish great man and and his statue and his he seen the suit of people that his robe up on him would look great and the crown on his head weighing above all the other people as he walked would be a a real asset to the Kingdom of Israel for the other kings with of the other ations would think look what a man how they could Point their finger and say looky here what a great king we got look what a great man that's over us I'm sad to say but how true it is today with the church yes yes they love to say our pastor is not a narrow-minded man he is a great man he is a graduat from Hartford or some great School of Theology he has four degrees out of so and such a place and he's a very good mixture amongst the people all that may be all right and have its place but God's way for his church is to be led by the Holy Ghost and by his [Music] Spirit but they like to say that we have this great denomination that we belong to we have started back in the early pioneer days when we were in the minority just the very few people and small and now we have grown until a place that we are among the largest denominations there is we have the best schools and the best educated ministers we have the best dressed crowds and the most intellectual people of the city attends our denomination and we give to charity and we do good deeds and all such and nothing at all God forbid that I should speak one word against that for that is all good but still it isn't the will of God that man should rule over man God sent on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost to rule in man's hearts and rule in his life our God it was not meant for man to rule over man oh Hallelujah but we love to say that it's a very outstanding thing when we can say we belong to such a great organization are you a Christian that's how I fell upon this text when I was at the hospital and I would ask one are you a Christian I belong to such and such are you a Christian I belong to such and such and a little nurse came into the bedside where I was reading the Bible and she was a a new nurse on the floor and she said how do you do she said I believe that you're reverent Brandon here for a a physical checkup I said I am and she said may I rub your back uh uh make you feel a little better with the alcohol and I said you may do it and while she was rubbing on my back she said uh what denomination of church do you belong to and I said oh I belong to the oldest denomination that there is and she said what denomination is that I said it's the one that was organized before the world was ever organized amen oh she said what I don't believe I know just that she said I belong to a certain church is it that organization I said no ma'am that was only about 200 years ago that organization ation but this organization started when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joyl when they seen the coming of a savior to redeem mankind prise God and she just stopped rubbing my back and I was stooped a little over this way so the lady could rub and she was from near Cardon down here and we got to talking and she he said sir I've always believed that if God ever was God he still God today just like he was in the old days she said though my church flatly denies that but I believe that it is the truth amen and I said you're not far from the kingdom of God young woman Hallelujah she said if he ever was a healer isn't he still a Healer I said he's most certainly is my sister but man Wants to Rule and Rule over man and man wants man to rule over him yes he doesn't want to have God to rule so this son of Kish saw by name was just the answer to what they had wanted the great stately man and the all he could just lead them to their battles and so forth but still it wasn't God's way of doing things amen God wanted his faithful old Prophet to direct them and speak his words to them now today in our great church age that we live in we are think and believe this was with all my heart that we have exactly gone vice versa from what God ordained us to do the last words of our savior was in Mark 16 said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe praise our God in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with the new tongue and if they should take up serpents or drink deadly things that would not harm them and if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover amen there is not a man Hallelujah there's no son of Kish or no one else can produce that outside of the leadership of the Holy Spirit but we have made schools we have made seminaries and made organizations to to satisfy and to look like the rest of the world now the Holy Spirit used to be the leader in this nation this nation used to be governed when back in when they wrote up the Declaration of Independence yes and there was an ex Street chair sitting there there is not one Speck of doubt in my mind but what the Son of God said at that table amen when this nation was founded upon the principles of freedom of religion and freedom to all and upon the basis of God's Eternal Word yes amen but we have corrupted that politics we have voted men in there under buying and selling and Promises of falsehood until our nation and our politics and our democracy is so polluted until it's it's interwoven with Communism and all kinds of isms and many times we call into the sessions for prayer when leagues of Nations meet and there are to have discussions and in one certain great time recently there was not even one time call for prayer how are we ever going to set differences without prayer how can we ever expect in all the world to ever do anything without the leadership of the holy spirit amen but let me say this with love and respect to our nation and to its flag and to the Republic for which it stands we have rejected our leader the Holy Spirit and through corrupt politics have brought in Mana perverse mind and if you don't watch they're going to make one of the most fatal mistakes they've ever made right now yes is because that the people are Desiring man to rule yes what we need in the Capal love this United States as a president what we need in Congress what we need in our Halls of justice is men who have consecrated their lives to God and are filled with the Holy Ghost and are led by his Divine Direction but instead of that we choose man of intellectual man who have forms of godliness and deny the power of God man who are atheist and sometimes even worse than that yes we brought into our political rims of our nation not only that but in our churches yes our churches have become corrupt upon the B is that we in choosing our Shepherds to lead us we have gone to the seminaries and have selected man that's great intellectual Giants man who are very brilliant in mind man who has scholarships and our great mixers amongst the people and our great man in the neighborhood which I have nothing to say against man you are kind in their ways of walk careful in their ways of life and how they conduct themselves among other men and among people great man in their fields which I do not speak evil of God forbid that my spirit would ever be that evil but still that isn't what God chose for us it's the leadership of the Holy Spirit Christ in the heart of man many of those intellectual men that stands in our poopet deny the real existence of the Holy Ghost many of them deny the existence of Divine Healing yeah and the power of the spirit my God I was reading an article yesterday I believe it was a series of newspaper clippings from Jack Cole the late Jack Cole of one of my converts to the Lord Jesus who was a mighty man of veiler in his day and was called to question down in Florida because of asking a young child to remove its braces from its legs and to walk across the platform and upon doing so the child walked across the platform normally and fell when it got to its mother all being a setup of the enemy of Christ this young woman and her husband brought our Gallant brother into the courts of the land and when every Church arst stood by Brother Jack whenever Church man that mentions the name of Jesus Christ should have stood by his side gallantly every man that calls on the name of the Lord Jesus should have fell to their knees in prayer yes but instead of that across the headlines of the papers one of our great denominations said they join hands with the atheist to condemn and prison brother Jack Cole could you imagine a church calling themselves the name of Christ would jarn hands with an atheist to condemn a godly man who was trying with all his heart to stand for the Bible but they did it and then brother Garden Lindsay was at the rescue and when the unbelieving judge said this man is a fraud because he taken the braces from that child and sent him across the platform and said he was healed and the lied and he did something contrary to the doctor's orders therefore he has a defraud case against him and Mr Cole raised up and he said Sarah I defy that statement God healed the boy and the judge said I will ask any man in this court if that statement could be true that God could heal that boy on one end out the platform and let him be sick on the other end if that statement can be proved by the Bible then I say Mr Cole has a right for his statement and AD Minister raised his hand and he said your honor sir may I state it and the judge said stayed on and the minister stood to his feet and said one night on a rocking sea when a little ship was about to go to the bottom all hopes of being saved was gone they saw Jesus the son of God come walking on water and one of the Apostles by the name of Peter said if that be you Lord bid me come to you on the water and he said the Lord said to the Apostle Peter come on and he stepped out of the boat sir walking just as good as Jesus was walking on the water but when he got scared he begin to sink before he got to Jesus the judge said the case is dismissed amen we need Holy Spirit leadership amen not intellectual man Saul the son of Kish was then made Captain over the people and he taken 2,000 men and Jonathan taken a th and Jonathan went down to a Garrison and smok a bunch of ammonites ammonites rather and when when he had smoked them Saul sounded a trumpet and said you see what Saul has done he began to get puffed up just as soon as a man gets to be some great doctor of the Divinity or gets a little something behind his name he becomes more or less a Know It All God's man are humble man God's people are humble people when you see someone who says they have received the Holy Spirit and begins to separ separate themselves seemingly not having the faith going about trying to be something that they're not just remember they haven't received the Lord Jesus amen then we find that the enemy set in and he was going to come into a little bunch of God's people and was going to pluck out the right eye of every man that's what the enemy always tries to do do is pluck out both eyes if you can so that the people cannot see what they're doing That's what Satan tries to do today to every Christian pluck out his spiritual sight that he can only follow the intellectual sense of things and not the sense of the Holy Spirit leading him so then when they did that when the Great defeat come then Saul cut up two great ox and sent them to all the people and I wish you would notice here when Saul sent the pieces of the ox to all Israel and said let every man that will not follow Samuel and Saul let him this ax be as this do you see how deceitful he tried to represent himself with the man of God how how un Christian it was the fear of the people was because of Samuel but Saul got them all to follow him because that the people feared Samuel let them come after Samuel and Saul and how many times today have we heard it we are the great church we are the Church of Christ we are the Church of God we are the the so and so it makes the people get a fear and think that that really is where God's working and they don't want the leadership of the Holy Spirit they'd rather follow man like that because they like to live their own individual life that's right they like to believe what they want to believe do you see the holy spirit is our judge God never give us a pope or a bishop or anybody to be a judge the Holy Spirit the person of God in the form of the holy spirit is our judge and and our God now why is that please pardon this rude and most rude expression I do not mean it to be mean I say it from love but the holy spirit says it's wrong for our women to cut their hair and it's wrong for our women to wear little shorts and slacks and to make up their lips and face with paint the holy spirit says it's wrong amen but we want man to tell us that it's all right that's right as long as we follow me and Samuel they like to live through six days any way they want to and go to church CH on Sunday morning and a fine intellectual college graduate with plenty of degrees can speak to them a little sermon that will a few jokes in it that would tickle their ears and cause them to be entertained like some movie or television program and say a little prayer over them and send them home with kind of a a self saatis five security that they've done their religion that is not the will of the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit wants you to live Godly every day in the week and every night separating yourselves from the things of the world but the church don't want that they want some man who can who can interpret the Bible the way that they want to hear it they won't listen to the voice of the Holy Spirit speaking through the Bible many of them want to say the days of Miracles is passed that's what tickles the people they want to say there's no baptism of the Holy Spirit the people don't want to act any different than what the rest of the world acts they don't want to get on the street and uh to have their face washed and and man with clean accountants and not cigarettes in their mouth and and cigars and pipes and and the things that men do and women wants their hair cut up real short and and little dresses on and of showing their Farms and things that they won't they they want man who will tell them that's all right then the other night here come a man to tell me that because that I had preached against such had a great denomination about five of them said we'll drop brother benam and have nothing else to do with him you'll either call those tapes back and apologize for them or we'll drop you I said I'll stand with God's word if it takes everything that's in my life Hallelujah I'll remain with the word and I said well should you not call back such and such a tape I said I have never preached anything in my life that I was ashamed to have amen amen I call back no tapes or no records I remain with what the holy spirit says that I live by and die by not trying to say about myself now but I'm just trying to give you an illustration of what's going on so you will see and understand it's people wants to be led by man that's right they didn't want Samuel than before they anointed Samuel King uh Saul King pardon me Samuel came to them again and I'm going to speak Justus in language like he would have said it today you may read it he said what is the matter with God being your King well we don't see God well I am his representative Samuel said have I ever told you anything wrong have I ever prophesied anything that didn't come to pass just as I said it would do have not I told you the word of the Lord and I'll ask you this have I ever come to you and begged any your money have I ever took anything from you have I ever brought you anything but straight thus sayith the Lord and God has Vindicated it every time that it was the truth thank you Lord and he sent a thunderstorm and rains you know the scripture you right there to prove that Samuel was God's mouthpiece and as Samuel perfectly represented today the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is God's mouth piece amen that speaks just exactly what the Bible says that believes just what the Bible says and won't vary from it one bit but they wanted somebody who could tell them different and the people could not say that Samuel's prophecy wasn't perfect they answered and said Samuel all all that you have spoken the name of the Lord the Lord has brought it to pass just as you said there is not one th you never did come to us and beg us for our money you have supported yourself you've never asked us to do any great outstanding thing for you you've trusted in your God and he has delivered you from all things and you're words are true everything you spoke in the name of the Lord has been just as you said but still we want a king can you see the discrepancy can you you see the the kindness of the devil can work on a human being instead of yielding himself for herself to the Holy Spirit and listen to what thus sayith the Lord is for a Pure Life a undefiled character for a different life for peculiar people a holy nation are odd acting people they had rather coincides with the world and act like the world and go to some church and says that's all right just act like that and go on can you see what it is yes they say there's no such a thing as healing oh the baptism of the Holy Spirit was a frame work to the church in other words then God taken man tuck the Holy Spirit out of the church and let the denomination Build It Up never never there's no such a thing the Holy Spirit the word of Truth was to guide you until Jesus comes amen but that's the way it it went Saul come into power he great got a great following oh he had beautiful armors he had singers he had Shields and he had Spears oh he outshined all the rest of the Nations and he brought them into a democracy that was beyond anything that anybody had ever heard of and that's exactly what our denominations and churches has done today we have the biggest church buildings in the world we have the prettiest dressed people in the world we have the highest scholarships that can be brought like Saul's trained man who could take that Spirit they could move it and maneuver to Nations fear then they were trained people and all but one day there come a time that there was a challenger come out and it's so excited the whole Israelite Army till they stood trembling in their shoes Goliath made them a challenge if your God Is What You Say He is you are the best trained and he challenged them they didn't know what to do their fine polished armors wouldn't work their Spears wouldn't work there was something they hadn't heard of before was taking place and with all reverence and godly respects and honor and dignity and love and Christian Fellowship I say this I read the other day in an African paper were that our son of Kish are Challenger of evangelism when Mohammad and challenged him Billy Graham said if your God is God let him heal the sick like he said he do amen hallelujah and the son of Kish with the rest of the army quieten themselves and left the country to deed that's right it's a disgrace our God is God Amen we have our good churches we have our fine evangelism we have our paid singers we have the best choirs the highest spires in the country we have the finest men some of the most money we have the intellectual we have theology down to the point we we can preach it we can tell it we can evangelize and bring people in and make millions each year of converts into the church our paid singers our intellectual evangelism doesn't know how to meet a challenge like that they know nothing of it they know nothing of his healing power of the baptism of the Holy Ghost of a power that can take a shout of a man dying with a Cancer and set him free they know nothing of it they haven't been trained in that field as Saul and his man-made group was but let me say to the people of God and to you children that you might know that God never leaves you without a witness not knowing to Saul Saul know nothing about it God had a little David back over behind the hill somewhere that wasn't feeding sheep on ecclesiastical weeds prise God he was leading down beside Still Waters and green pastur he was mindful of his father's sheep and of something running an enemy to grab one of his his father's sheep he know the power of God to deliver that sheep God still got a David somewhere oh amen that knows what it means to deliver one of God's Sheep by the power of God Amen he still knows all about it he had trusted he didn't know nothing about Saul's armor neither did he want any of it he didn't want any other denominations he didn't want the armor up on him he said I don't know nothing about it praise God but let me go in the power that I know of yes Hallelujah he had fed his father's sheep praise our God he had took care of the pastors he had given them the right kind of [Music] food and they lived and th man shall not live by read alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God man shall live thank you Jesus the true Shepherd feeds them Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah and if the enemy grabs one in sickness he knows the power of God yeah look at little David stood there said that guy is a Warrior from his birth and from his youth he's know nothing but a spear and armor he's well trained he's a theologian and you know nothing about it he said that is true sir I don't know nothing about his theological training but there's one thing I do know that one an enemy come in to take one of my father's sheep I went with the power of [Applause] God I delivered him I brought him safely back to Good Health again I brought him back to the Shady Green Pastures and the Still Waters the god that delivered the lion into my hands and I slew him when he took one of the the Lambs and he let me slay the bear so the god of Heaven amen go with me to slay this uncircumcised Philistine Hallelujah we need leadership of the Holy [Applause] Spirit I don't know my days no one does the other morning I was laying in my bed and I was I've been asleep and I dreamed the Joseph was sick and I picked him up to pray for him and when I woke up I was very upset I said well maybe Joseph is going to be sick and I looked going before me in a little dark shadow rather of a brownish color and it seemed like it was me and I watched it and coming behind it was someone white and it was him I looked over to my wife to see if she was awake and I could show her if she could see the vision but she was sleeping I said oh I'm sorry Lord but that's been my life you've had to dve me everything that had done every time anything had happened I think it was you doing it and I realized it was Satan trying to keep me away from him I said If You Could Only leave me and as I look I seen the prettiest face I ever saw on a man he was in front of me looking back he raised his hand and got a hold of mine started moving this away the vision left me last Sunday morning I was waking up early that was on Saturday this Vision on always worried I've always thought of dying at me being 50 it's my time is not didn't think was too long and I wonder why I would be in this theophany Celestial body would it be that I'd see my precious friends and say a little white fog going by and say there goes brother ner he couldn't say hello brother Brandon when Jesus come then I'd be man again I often thought that I was dreaming that I was out west and I coming down to a little Sage Brush Place and my wife was with me and we've been trout fishing and I stopped and and opened up the gate and the skies were so pretty they didn't look like they do over the valley here they were blue in the pretty white clouds and I said to wife I said we ought have been out here long long time ago honey she said for the children's sake we should have been Billy I said that's I woke up I don't I'm streaming so much I wonder why and I looked down and she was laying by me and I raised up on my pillow as many you people have done pop my head up on the the headboard of the bed and pop my hands behind me and I was laying there like this and I said well I just wonder what it will be the other side I am already 50 and I haven't done nothing yet if I could only do something to help the lord well I know I won't be martal half of my time is gone at least or more than half if I live to be as old as my people still half my time is gone and I looked around and I was laying there fixing to get up it's about 7:00 I said I believe I'll go down church this morning if I am horse I'd like to hear Brother Neville preach so I I said are you awake honey and she was sleeping very soundly and I don't want you to miss this it has changed me I can't be the same brother of Brandon that I was and I look and I heard something kept saying you're just starting press the battle just keep pressing yes I shook my head a minute I thought well I probably just thinking like this you know your person's can get some imaginations and I said I just probably imagine that it said press the battle keep going keep going I said maybe I said it and I put my lips within my teeth and put my hand over my mouth and there come again said just keep pressing if you only knew what was at the end of the road and see like I could hear Grim Snelling or somebody that sing that song like this he sings it your anime and all of you all I'm homick and blue and I want to see Jesus I would like to hear those sweet Harbor bells chime it would brighten my path and would vanish all fears Lord let at me look past the curtain of time you've heard it sing here at the church and I heard something say would you like to see just beyond the curtain I said it would helped me so much and I looked in just a moment I one breath I'd come into a little place that slanted I looked back and there I was laying on the bed and I said this is a strange thing now I would not want you to repeat this this is before my church are my sheep that I am pastoring whether it was I was in this body or out or it was a translation it wasn't like any Vision I ever had I could look there and I could look here and when I hit that little place I never seen so many people come running screaming oh our precious brother and I looked in young women maybe in their early 20s 18 to 20 they were throwing their arms around me and screaming our precious brother here come young man in the Brilliance of Young Manhood and their eyes glistening and looking like stars on a darken night their teeth as white as Perl and they were screaming and grabbing me and screaming oh our precious brother and I stopped and I looked and I was young I look back at my old body laying there with my hands behind my head and I said I don't understand this and these young women throwing their arms around me now I do realize this is the mixed audience and I say this with the sweetness and with the melness of the spirit man cannot put your arm around women without uh a human sensation but it wasn't there there was no yesterday or tomorrow they didn't get tired they were I never seen such pretty women in all my life they had a hair way down to their waistline long skirts to their feet and they were just a hugging me it wasn't a hug like even my own sister sitting there would have hug me they were not kissing me and I was not kissing them it was something that I I have not got the the vocabulary I haven't got the words to say perfection wouldn't touch it suburb wouldn't even touch it nowhere it was something that I never you just have to be there and I looked this way and that way and they were coming by the thousands and I said I don't understand this I said brother and here come hope that was was my first wife she run and never said my husband she said my precious brother and when she hugged me there was another woman standing there that hugged me and then H hug this woman and each one and I thought Bo this has to be something different it can't be there's something oh would I ever want to go back to that old carcass again I looked around there and I thought what is this I looked real good I I said I I can't understand this but hope seemed to be like uh oh a guest of honor she was no different but just like a guest of honor and I Heard a Voice then that spoke to me that was in the room said this is what you preach was Holy Ghost this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it I am more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there there was no jealousy there was no tiredness there was no death sickness could never end there moral could could never make you old and them they could not cry it was just one Joy oh my precious brother and they took me up and set me up on a great big high place and I thought I am not dreaming I'm looking back at my my body laying down on the bed and they set me up there and I said oh I shouldn't set up here and here come women and men from both sides just in their Bloom of Youth screaming and one woman was standing there and she screamed oh my precious brother oh we are so happy to see you here I said I don't understand this and then that voice that was speaking from above me said you know it is written in the Bible that the prophets were gathered with their people and I said yes I remember that in the scripture said but this is when you will gather with your people amen I said then they'll be real and I can feel them oh yes I said but I there's a Millions there's not that many bandoms and that Bo said they're not randoms them your converts amen that's the ones that you've led to the Lord and said some of them women there you think is so beautiful we better than than 90 years old when you led them to the Lord no wonder they're screaming our precious brother and they screamed all once said if you hadn't have went we wouldn't be here I looked around I thought well I don't get it I said oh where is Jesus I want to see him so bad they said now he's just a little higher right up that way said someday he will come come to you he said you were sent for a leader and God will come and when he does he'll judge you according to what you taught them first whether they go in or not we'll go in according to your teaching I said oh I'm so glad if Paul does he have to stand like this does Peter had to stand like this yes I said then I preached every every work that they preached I never did it from it one side to the other or they baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I did too where they taught the baptism of the Holy Ghost I did too whatever they taught I did too and then people screamed and said we know that and we know we are going with you someday back to Earth said Jesus will come and you'll be judged according to the word that you preached this and and then if you are accepted at that time what you will be and said then you will present us to him as your trophies of your ministry said you will guide us to him and all together we'll go back to the Earth to live forever I said do I have to return back now yes but keep pressing on Amen I looked and I could see the people just as far as I could see still coming wanting to hug me screaming our precious brother just that a voice said all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you God has given you here and I looked in here come old dog come walking up here come my horse and laid his head up over my shoulder nickered said all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you God has given them into your hands through your ministry and I felt myself mooved from that beautiful place and I looked around I said are you wake honey she's still asleep and now thought oh god oh h help me oh God never let me compromise with one word let me stay right straight on that word and preach it I don't care what comes or goes what anybody does how many SS of Sons of Kish rise how many this that together let me Lord press to that place all fear of death I say this is my Bible before me this morning I've got a little boy there four years old to be raised I got a nine-year-old girl and a teenager that I'm thankful for that's turned the way of the Lord amen God let me live to bring them up in the admonition of God and above that the whole world seems to scream to me 90y old women and man and all kinds if you hadn't went we wouldn't been here God let me press the battle yes but if it comes to dying I am no Morse it would be a joy it would be a pleasure to enter from this corruption and disgrace if I could make up y 100 billion miles high a square block and that's perfect love each step this way it Narrows until we get down to where we are now it would be just merely a shadow of corruption that little something that we can sense and feel that there's something somewhere we don't know what it is oh my precious friend my beloved my darlings of the Gospel my begotten children unto God listen to me your pastor amen you are wish there was some way I could explain it to you there's no words I couldn't find it it's not found anywhere but just beyond this last breath is the most glorious thing that you ever there is no way to explain it there's no way I just can't do it but whatever you do friends lay aside everything else till you get perfect love get to a spot that you can love everybody every enemy everything else that one visit there to me has made me a different man I can never never never be the same brother brandom that I was whether the planes are rocking where the Lightnings are flashing whether the spies has a gun on me whatever it is it doesn't matter I'm going to press the battle by the grace of God I preach the gospel to every creature and every person that I can persuading them to that beautiful land on Earth it may seem hard it may take a lot of strength I don't know how much longer we don't know physically speaking the from my examination the day he said you got 25 years of hard good life you're solid that helped me but oh that wasn't it that isn't it it's something within here this corruption has got to put on incorruption this Mortals got to put on immortality amen sons of Kish may rise I have all the good things they do I have nothing evil to say against it give to the poor and to charity and remember why Samuel told Saul you will also prophesy and many of those men are Great Mighty preachers can preach the word like archangels but still it wasn't God's will God was to be their King brother sister you
