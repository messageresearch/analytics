God we commit each one into your hands Lord as we move into this portion of the service we pray and ask your blessings now in jesus' name amen amen God bless you we used to say in the U Pentecostal church we say praise the Lord everybody and the Saints would say praise the Lord Lord and so when I say God bless you it's okay if you say God bless you praise the Lord God bless each of you so happy to be in the house of the Lord with you this evening we're going to the table of the Lord here and just for a few scriptures I really wanted to lay in that Revelations 18 and tying that into the angel the seventh angel but I'm just moved to go in a little bit different direction just to maybe comment on communion just a little bit and that's found in 1 Corinthians chapter 11 as we all know if we can stand to our feet and turn there amen thank the Lord if you have that you can say Amen verse 27 says wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are we weak and sickly among you and many sleep take one more scripture in Isaiah 28 Old Testament verse number eight of course brother Banner refers to this scripture many times speaking of the age and hour that we live in now and says for all the tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there is no place clean Whom Shall he teach knowledge Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine them that are wean from the milk and drawn from the breast for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little with stammering lips and another tongue will I speak to this people amen and so we're going to speak a few minutes on this communion and Discerning the Lord's body may God bless you you may be seated this um kind of goes into uh this message from this morning touch not my anointed and I brought that two ways and bringing it touch not the anointing that is in the elect the Christian the prophet the pastor the believer but there's an anointing in the word as well that those that are qualified can move forward and there's disciplines that are required when we go and handle the word just like any other um the examples that I gave surely um in handling God's word we have to have these disciplines and this is another one here in Discerning the body of the Lord the scripture tells us to let a man examine himself and this is the communion uh service here many times in many assemblies this is probably the least people that would come to communion service would you say brother George and different brothers that have been around brother um Joel brother Joel will be uh sojourning here with us for few weeks a month a few months him and his wife three months yes for sure maybe six and so we're so happy to have him with us he was a pastor for how many years 14 years in Phoenix and I knew him back then years ago and so so happy to have him with us him and his wife sister p Pamela they'll be here with us for some time but as you look across and you see this Discerning of the Lord's body the communion service it's what believers do it is part of our Christian experience and Paul here brings this not Discerning or eating of it unworthily into play and as I said this morning you know I can't preach you into being some something that you don't decide to become yourself uh the word of God the prophet of God the Bible itself being played in your home in whatever format it's played if you don't make the decision to receive it it won't benefit you amen there were people in brandham Tabernacle that walked away from his ministry saw the signs wonders and miracles and they walked away it wasn't an IND ment on his ministry or the Bible or the truth is what is it was decisions it's the decision that each one of us have to make and so I like that scripture it says let a man examine himself not you examining me not me Examining you when you're really repenting you're not looking at nobody else amen Saints when you're really trying to get closer to the Lord everybody else no one else is in the picture it's between you and God and let a man examine himself if you're okay to do it with it within you and the Lord then go do it there shouldn't be any condemnation in your heart if there is then you're not walking in faith and you shouldn't do it anyways and so once you have that is reconciled within you and I'm speaking from experience when there's something in the word that you have reconciled how you're going to handle it then it's okay if others don't see it or get it because you you've settled it between you and the Lord let a man examine himself then let him go eat of that bread and drink of that cup so let's take in the message here brother Brandon and questions and answers 1954 he says this here paragraph 2:10 now it's communion time while we bow our heads I'm going to ask someone to come to the piano Lord this is the hour the time that when maybe men and women Lord across the world will see that the great hour of judgment is approaching when God will judge all nations in their political standings everywhere every place and Everybody Must Stand the judgments of God and father we're so happy to know that there is an escape of these people who would desire to escape and that root is through Jesus Christ who is The Offspring of David and we thank thee dear father for ever sending him to the Earth that he was the medium that we can go through he would intercede for us and take away our sins that we'd escape the wrath and the damnation of God we know that the Wrath is to come and as John said in the days gone by flee from the Wrath that is to come now Lord we pray that as we take communion tonight that you will sanctify us Lord with your cleansing blood and may every sin of these people be remitted I humbly and sincerely pray God that you'll not let one of us take it unworthily for thou has said in Thy Word if we do so we're guilty of the body and blood of the Lord now father make these people holy and consecrated that we may take this without a blemish isn't that how you want to come to the table of the Lord to take it without a blemish now I can't stand here and tell you whether you have a blemish or not but if you'll examine yourself before the Lord Lord and you need to take that up with him and ask him to cleanse you I love this prayer and I love how brother Randon brought that Amen in 1954 Redemption by power he says this here's a sad picture before we get over to our regular lesson is found the 38th verse and a mixed multitude went up with their flock there's where Israel made a mistake the supernatural had been done an unconverted people followed because of the supernatural finally got them into trouble and on down we'll notice here about the 42nd verse and the 43rd verse the Lord speaking to Moses said that no one but those who were th those who were sacrificed could eat the sacrifice rather but those who were circumcised no strangers no Outsiders no one should take it but those who are circumcised and what a disgrace that we have today in this day beloved friends that when in the church everybody that belongs to the church takes communion and that's wrong only those who are redeemed that's all who are worthy Isaiah spoke and said the tables of the Lord will be full of vomit said who shall I teach Doctrine them that are weaned from the breast said precept must be upon precept line upon line hear a little there a little hold fast to that what's good God speaking knowing that the day that we're living in that the church would be so politically till they' let everything people come in as long as they had their name on the church book they were members they taken communion and the Bible said he that eats and drinks it unworthily is guilty of the body and blood of the Lord St John 13th chapter Jesus speaking 2 Corinthians the 11th chapter Paul said years later he that eats and drinks this unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord let a man examine himself he says before he take I'm quoting scripture that's right he that eats and drinks unworthy eats and drinks damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body and for this cause many are sick and weakly among you and many sleep be sure that you're standing right with God here it is in the shadow that no one but the circumcised no matter how loyal he was how much he helped the Jewish church he had to be a proelite he had to be a real circumcised believer before he could take the communion or eat the Passover oh how far we got off the line to today amen so a True Believer is the one that takes this um Passover this supper it's um brother rand's going to tell us what that means you know there's a difference between a Believer and an unbeliever and God makes that difference and when the believer examines himself he knows what he's doing when he partakes he examines his faith he examin his walk with the Lord he examines the life that he's living before he takes his hand upon that Sacrament and eat and drink of the cup amen because it is um there's a consequence with it there's a blessing with it but there's also a consequence in the Jubilee year 1954 the prophet says this what does this mean brother brandom it means this if you come and take communion and go out and live a different kind of a life than what a Christian ought to live you are bringing reproach and disgrace to the cause of the Lord Jesus Christ you understand it if you're a Christian come if you're not don't do it look but let a man examine himself and so let him eat that bread and drink that cup all right 29th verse for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this caus many are sick and weakly among you and many sleep for we should judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we're chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world when we eat this bread and drink this cup let's examine ourself and say now do I now walk worthy well I don't walk worthy worthy no but Christ in me makes me walk worthy I love him I testify of him I'm not perfect never will be in this world you're not perfect never will be but my love to him and he lets me live for him and I love to do it and to testify of him I don't go out and carouse I do and do things evil that brings reproach to his name but if I find out that I do something then I'm chastened of the Lord Lord why does God do this that we wouldn't be condemned with the world how many wants to be chasen of the Lord you know if the Lord is chasing in you don't you think you deserve it if it's the Lord um I got some SP some spankings that I didn't deserve but I got away with more I should have got a lot more spank kins and you know and I felt so unjust it felt so unjust when my mom got me or my dad got me when I was actually innocent of the crime and my mom would say Israel but if you've ever done anything that you got away with this will make up for that and then guess what the argument was over then cuz I got away with the lot it was groups of us so we can hide behind each other's mischief and my mother knew sometimes she would spank Us in groups how's had a group whooping she say all of you line up cuz somebody's lying and I'm just going to beat all of you and she would she tearing all of us but Mama it wasn't me it wasn't me you was guilty before and it's like okay argument over and so this chesting of the Lord is for your own good it's so that you won't be condemned with the world Prophet continues now there's a great difference between the believer and the unbeliever god makes a difference remember the Believers in Egypt was all on the inside under what under the blood the lamb was killed and its blood with hiss up was sprinkled on the door look where it was put at on the lentil of the door that's the door jam you have to go through the L of the door and on the doorpost see what it is the cross hundreds of years before the Lamb of God came and was slain but it's a type of the Lamb it was put on the lentil of the door and every Israelite coming under that blood was forbidden to go out anymore there you are forbidden to go out they were under the blood they could not go until orders came to March orders to go forward type of Christ once for by one sacrifice has he perfected forever those that are Sanctified in Christ Jesus once and for all no more turning back no more going this no more doing that oh you'll you'll backslide and do things that's wrong and come on see but one time Christ sanctifies a human soul by filling him with the holy spirit it's perfected forever there you are no more desire to do wrong for the worshipper once purged has no more conscience or desire the right translation the worshipper once purged oh I wish I could just sink that deep the worshipper the believer once purged has no more desire of sin nowhere settled forever for he has per he has perfected by one sacrifice forever those that are in Christ Jesus the world becomes dead you don't care for it no more your affections are set on things above now if you are saying you're a Christian and still living worldly lives then you are chasen of the Lord for you should not be condemned with the world wherefore when you come together my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another watch and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together un condemnation and the rest will I set in order when when I come you notice Paul here those Corinthians they didn't get it they went up there and even got drunk at the Lord's table they eat and drink and done everything wrong Paul said when you come together if a man's hungry let him eat at home but when you come together t one for another in other words wait on one another you say now here's a brother that I don't think ought to take communion but don't run up there and jerk him out have patience with him after the service is over and a time when he come over to his house some night and sit down and say brother now forgive me if I'm wrong but I seen you down the other day on the strink drunk whatever it was he was doing out with some other lady that wasn't his wife and you're taking communion I love your brother let you and I pray over this thing and straighten it up see wait on one another do service for one another don't be bigger than somebody else try and see how little you can be I've often heard it say don't never be big in your own sight if you're big let it be in God's sight be little in your own sight every man that humbles himself God will exalt those who he exalts themselves God will bring a base how many love that amen how do we wait on one another we go to one another but now we talk about one another but we won't go to one another and talk these things through and pray for one another amen I've seen sister sewing so I've seen Brother sewing so and they're even taking the communion and what's your responsibility is to pray for them and go to them is that right huh and I know it's not it's not common or custom because people don't like other people in their business but this isn't about other people this is about what the word of God says if you can't go to them and pray for them don't even talk about them don't don't gossip about them if you don't have the courage to go to them and look to them eyeball to eyeball and talk with them and share with them in a Godly considerate way then don't be sharing what you saw them doing and not doing and gossiping and all that kind of stuff it's just not scriptural amen somebody amen all right and Discerning the body of the Lord Brother random says this here I like this now our Eternal destination is not altogether determined by what we see and what we hear but it's determined on what discernment we have of what we see and what we hear Paul was not disputing with them for taking the communion their Act was right but their discernment was wrong for taking the Lord's Supper is the Commandment of the Lord but to take it unworthily not Discerning the Lord's body is where the wrong lays these Christians was taking the communion and not living the life Christianity is an experience in a life and these Christians was just living any kind of a life making a poor example of their profession and Paul says that this caused many are sick and weakly among you and many are asleep which means they are dead because they haven't discerned the body of the Lord let me stop there for a minute one of our prayers should be Lord give me the discernment of your body you know my prayer is that we'd see more healings in this church than we've ever seen before we see more baptism more people sa more people filled with the Holy Ghost than ever before that is my prayer that's my open confession in prayer and I'm believing God for that amen amen and that's what his word said the true church the real Church would have amongst them and this is part of it it's Discerning One Another Touch not my anointed my anointed Saints my Believers the brother sister sitting next to you if he's a little bitty Christian he's a big Christian he's a preacher you have to respect them as Believers and our love should be for them to see them grow and get better and this Discerning of the Lord's body is that you know I'm Discerning the Lord Lord give me discernment of the Lord's body and he says they're taking the these Christians and we and we who call ourselves Christians we have no right to take the communion unless we are living above reproach of the world we have no right the communion are for those who are living right as an example of Christianity the worst thing there is in the world is a person to try to impersonate something and there's too much of that in the world today not only do we in this day are guilty of the same crime that Paul was rebuking the Corinthian Church for but of trying to do something that the Lord had commanded without Discerning the body of the Lord and the body of the Lord is the Believers but today we are doing things not Discerning any of the word of God we should have a discernment on everything that we do it ought to be measured by the word of God all that Christians do and say should be measured by the word of God how many can say Amen to that what is the word of God that's this message that's this this Bible everything that we do every activity fathers mothers everything that we do ought to be discerned by the word of God Amen in the message communion prophet of God says this here he he goes into this discernment a little bit more if I can bring this up just for a moment paragraph number six may I bring that point when we are judged by the word which is Christ we're chasing if we're doing wrong we're not living up to this word we're chasen of the Lord and when the Lord chastens us that mean corrects us that we should not be condemned with the world so he deals with this discernment a little bit in paragraph same message in paragraph number eight and he says this here the discernment this is in the message communion July seven is paragraph number eight the very same message I was just in paragraph number eight the discernment of knowing that you are the Lord's body sorry I should have just stay with Let's see we okay there see paragraph number 8 in the message communion July 7 thank you if we got it yeah the numbers are off so sometimes it does that sorry so it's number eight for me it's 15 for you all right the discernment of knowing that you are the Lord's body you can't discern it in wickedness and sin that's right we've got to be above that that we discern that the Lord is righteous and we discern that he's our perpetuation that all of our sins we've confessed and we believe in him of waiting upon his atonement to cleanse us from all of our iniquity then we're Discerning the Lord's body to what it discernment of what it's for and then Discerning again that in among us as the Lord's bride body let's discern if there's anything wrong with us in here that would hinder the gospel from growing or the Lord from presenting us before God as a Chase version let's discern that out right now and find if it's wrong let's confess it if it's wrong let's say Lord I'm sorry about that so you can you see why uh uh communion service is so beautiful we have it once a month and um and I know uh we've been criticized a number of times for having it uh so regular um but that's the that's what brother brandham did and you know and so um the communion it gives us an opportunity to to take this these scriptures in Discerning what's the discernment I'll read it again the discernment of knowing that you are the Lord's body yes you can't discern in wickedness and sin we've got to be above that that we discern that the Lord is righteous and we discern that he's our perpetuation that all of our sins we've confessed and we uh and we believe in him of waiting upon his atonement to cleanse us from all our iniquity then we're Discerning the Lord's body to what it discernment of what it's for and then Discerning again that in among us as the Lord's bride body let's discern if there's anything wrong with us in here that would hinder the gospel from growing or the Lord from presenting us before God as a Chase virgin don't you want to know that if you're if there's a hindrance there don't wouldn't you want to know that if you're hindering the work of the Lord wouldn't you want to know huh sure you want to know I would want to know I want that I want to discern that to know if we're hindering the Lord's body so therefore it might be something that we've done you've done something I've done it might not be consciously right now let's ask God to forgive us for it we used to sing a song Here forgive the sins I have confessed to thee for forgive the secret sins you see that they don't even know nothing about an unknown sin we we pray God forgive them now it said when you come together t one for another T one for the other one and that's really would be like this Terry one with the other t means to wait wait on each other and let's do that now I'll pray for you if you know anything that you've done wrong say God forgive me I didn't mean that and if you'll help me from this night on I won't do it again I mean it Lord I won't do it again if you'll just forgive me and upon my confession I believe you have forgiven me I go to take the body of Christ filling in my heart that you forgive me for all my sins I pray then for your your secret sin you pray for mine that maybe something we don't know about that we won't come together condemned with the world we don't want the world in here this little spot of people that God has given us to worship with here want to keep ourselves clean from selfishness keep our thing our sin Our Lives clean from all the things of the world that we be not spotted with that we want to be ready for the Rapture so let us pray now silently one for another just a moment you pray for me as I pray for you Lord Jesus let it be Lord that all of our sins be now in the blood of the Lord Jesus in the forgi forgetfulness of God's Recollections that we come together now as beloved Believers and children in Christ where we ask it in his name amen praise the Lord so that is what we all desire brother B continues in the message communion here in Tucson and he goes even further talking about these very same things not being condemned with the world let us discern the Lord's body that my life is not a hindrance you know might not even be an open sin it might be my attitude the way I'm thinking the way I'm approaching the way I'm holding a grudge against someone or some you know some little thing like that you can't make make yourself feel love for someone if you if you don't and that's where the Holy Spirit has to do that for you he has to do a work in you that there be no root of bitterness enter into you no Spirit of unbelief selfishness greed temper lust uh anger whatever it is want those Spirits out of us we don't want any of the world in us we want to take it with a clean heart amen clean mind mind clean Spirit want everything cleaned out as we come to the table of the lord it's clean hands that are to take it amen and um God's blood has all the power that is needed to cleanse your life and your body and your and and your life and the U your mind and your spirit so that you can take this as you discern the Lord's body amen so God bless you as the brothers will prep prepare to come we'll bring these the elements out I think every time we open our Bible it's the light of God's word examining Our Lives amen and that discernment we need let's go to the Lord in prayer father we thank you for your word tonight we thank you for the opportunity to speak of these things while there is no sudden emergency upon us but we can soberly in the evening um meditate on your word and come to the table of the Lord I know it may seem cumbersome to some Lord the hassle but you've commanded us to do it Lord and to show you your death till you come Lord and we appreciate that we can take it in such a fine place as this and you've provided it for us and Lord we h have the opportunity to really just purify our thoughts before you what a tremendous opportunity we have Lord to make everything right and put it under the blood as you purge us and cleanse us Lord I pray that you'll do that for each one we love you and we thank you in Jesus name a amen this is in 1 Corinthians 11 we'll just take a couple of scriptures here in verse 23 for the understanding for the reading of the word if you would for I have received of the lord it's the Apostle Paul that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed he took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had up saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for an often as you eat this bread and
