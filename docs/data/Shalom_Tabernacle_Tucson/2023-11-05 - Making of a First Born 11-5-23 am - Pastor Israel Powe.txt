========================================

nowhere that had been mentioned John didn't see it all the heavens as he's looking but here come forth notice where it came forth where did it come from it come from the father's Throne where he had been seated since he had been slain and raised again he raised up and set on the right hand of God ever living to make intercessions amen prise God hallelujah raise that today as an intercessor with his own blood to make intercession upon the ignorance of the people that's the one I'm depending on he still was covered with bleach the bleach of the forgiveness of sin amen John looked at that lamb and the lamb looked like he' been slain and then he noticed he was wounded and cut and bruised and bleeding a bloody lamb that's what took our place isn't it strange a simple lamb had to take our place and he saw the lamb he proceeded out John hadn't saw him because he had been weed back into the eternities even making intercession and showing that those who had come to God under the offering of the blood of bulls of goats a substitutionary offering he also calls them who believe that pointed to him and the blood had not been shed yet so he was there to clear them he was there to clear you and I amen and oh God I hope he's there tonight forever sinner the lamb been slain how can Jehovah see anything but that Bloody lamb standing there and the lamb proceeded out into the vision now as it had been slain Notice come from the father's Throne oh F he where did he advance from to this Vision he come from Glory where he seated at the right hand of God he Advanced forth to John out of Glory oh would not it be a glorious thing if our sinful thoughts tonight could be laid aside long enough to accepting he would Advance all the way from Glory tonight to make himself known to any the lamb advancing from glory for intercessions all right to make claims now for his Redemption remember he had been on his metori work back here but remember these seals are ready to be opened and the lamb come from the sanctuary of God Advance forward wait till we get all that one hour take that one half hour that is silent the sanctuary is smoking there's no more intercession the sacrifice is left it's a judgment seat there's no blood on it no more for the blood covered lamb has walked away don't you wait till that time remember in the Old Testament as long as the blood was off The Mercy Seat it was judgment but as long as the blood was on there there was Mercy but when the lamb walked away that did it what's he been he's been an intercessor no other person tell me where Mary can make intercessions then amen what could Mary offer what could St Francis St aisia or any St Cecilia brother or any other Human Being John never saw a thousand saints come out from the mediatorial he saw a [Applause] lamb a lamb that SL bloody I don't care how many Saints have been slain they were all do it every one of them like the thief said at the cross we've sinned and we do this but this man's done nothing he was the only man that was worthy here he come from the intercessory box what's he coming for now what's he John was weeping where's it all at what's going to happen said don't we John said the Elder here comes the line he was the one for bail when he look here come a lamb bloody have it been slay anything kills bloody you know been killed it's neck's been chopped open or something the Bloods all over here come a lion being slain and he came forth oh my why to make his claims on his Redemption amen am hallu oh don't you just feel like it's going around corner sit down and cry W here come a lamb still bloody John there wasn't nothing there all the celebrity was standing around but there was none of them could do it so here come the lamb now his intercessory days is over the mediatorial days that's when this Angel is going to stand there you wait till get the seals and time shall be no more that's right that half hour is silence watch what takes place in that half hour sils that's 7 SE on next Sunday night Lord willing he comes forth what to take his claims now oh my comes forth to take his claims now he had done the Kinsman work he'd come down become man died he done the Kinsman work of redemption but had not as yet called for his claim now he comes on the scene to claim his Rights Watch what takes place oh for which he was slain for as becoming a Kinsman to man to die in his place to redeem him but the Elder was right when he said he was a line see the Elder called himself said a line because he had been a lamb an intercessor a bloody lamb but now he's coming forth as a li his days of intercessions over let him that's filthy be filthy still let him that's righteous be righteous still let him that's holy be holy still the thing is closed oh brother then one then one and remember it comes at the seventh Church age when the mysteries of God will be opened up now what's real close this is something you must get now he had been doing his mediatorial work making intercessions for the believer for 2,000 years he had been back there a lamb now he is stepping forth from eternity to take the title deed book and to break the seals and reveal the Mysteries amen what of it at the end time do you get it amen all right go on now break the seals and release all the Mysteries to them to the seventh angel whose message is to reveal all the mysteries of God the mysteries of God lays in these Seven Seals see that's what he said here all the Mysteries lays in these Seven Seals and the lamb comes forth now from being a mediator between God and man he becomes a lineah and when he becomes line he takes the book that's his rights yeah God's hell is the mystery but now the lamb comes nobody could take the book it's still in the hands of God no po pop priest whatever it might be they can't take no the book The Seven Seals hasn't been revealed see but when the med when his work is done as an intercessor he comes forth and John the Elder said he's alive and he comes forth watching oh my see he comes forth to take the book now watch to reveal the mysteries of God that others has guessed that in all these denominational ages see then the seventh angel if this book Mysteries is the word of God the seventh angel has to be a prophet for the word of God to come to [Music] no priest popes or anything else can get it the word don't come to such the word of God comes only to a prophet always amen amen Mali 4 promised such yes and when he come forth he take the mysteries of God or the church got all scrupled up in all these denominations and restore the faith of the children back to the fathers amen and then the world judgment would strike and the Earth would be burned and then the righteous would walk out upon the ashes of the wicked in the Millennium you understand it now all right Hallelujah others had guess that in the denominational age but see he must be this man the seventh angel of Revelations 10 1-4 is a the seventh angel has the mysteries of God given to him and finishes all the Mysteries it's been left off down through the denominational ages now you can see why I do not strike at my brethren in denomination it's the system of denomination they do not there's no need of them trying to know it because it could not be revealed that's according to the word they presumed at it and believed it was there and by faith walked by it but now it's evidently proved amen oh my what a what a scripture now watch then it is he the lamb that takes his kingly position when his saints come to crown him Lord of Lord and King of Kings see see time is run out Revelations 10:6 there's no more time notice there's seven horns on this lamb did you notice it having seven horns we just been through that horns means power to the animal and notice he was not a animal because he took the book out of the right hand of him that set up the throne right see notice oh my I believe I had that wrote down somewhere oh to break the seals and to loose the title the title deed and uh the message to the liest angel and um he takes his kingly place that's what he comes forth now to do now watch when he comes out the seven horns now when he saw this lamb John looking at it it it looked like he' been slain bloody and he's come from eternity and he ceased to be a mediator then pray to Mary as much as you want to there was no man in heaven and earth or no person no being nowhere else could take it John even wept about it oh Catholic friend can't you see that don't pray to some dead person the lamb is the only mediator he was the one that came forth and what did he do now he's been back here interceding until his blood has atoned for every person and the lamb now knows what's written in the book so you know from the foundation of the world their names were in there so he has stood back here and re and and done mediator work like this until mediator work till every one that's been put in the book has been redeemed and it's finished and now he walks out he he's done his Kinsman work he's all you know what the Kinsman work was to testify before Elders remember boy ass kicking off his shoe and so forth he's done all all this now now he comes to take his bride amen comes now his King he's looking for his Queen Amen in this book is a whole secret of it wrapped up around Seven Seals brother Seven Seals waiting for him to come notice let's get these symbols with just :00 we got 3 hours we got that's just keep telling me that people's getting tired I guess they are but let's take this anyhow seven horns was the seven

this service it was good for us to be here Lord we ask for this blessing now in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you so happy to be back in the house of the Lord with you again so glad to be back in this house of the Lord to see the Saints of the most high God it's always so so wonderful to see your faces we missed you quite a lot and um we're so glad to be back with you uh we certainly thank the Lord for bringing us back home safely we um didn't get sick on the trip we were strengthened and encouraged um didn't get a lot of sleep while there but it didn't seem to wear us down too much I think it's catching up a little bit on us just a little bit but we're happy to be here with you we um um we flew out as we said I think we were here on that Sunday morning the next Monday we flew out to Johannesburg from Phoenix that was a 5H hour flight to New York and then or New Jersey and then from New Jersey to Johannesburg was 15 hours so that was 20 hours on money Monday flying we getting to Johannesburg and we were able to rest Tuesday and then Wednesday and then I believe we had a service our first service was in a little town called Segundo um in outside of Johannesburg it's a Township very very poor um if you know the history of South Africa you'll know that the way they um segregated it under the apar system uh they they broke the people up into four classes the races were whites Indians and Asians colorss and then blacks colored is what we call a colored man today here in the US in South Africa colored is a man that's mixed with Indian or black and white or Indian and white any kind of mix is considered a colored there and so in that order um they were SE separated and the colors in blacks were sent to very small portions that they could live brother piso who spoke here I think on the Sunday night he was here from South Africa he's old enough to remember the apartheid because it just ended in was it 89 or 89 or 90 something like that while I'm in high school trying to get some Nikes brother George there's some folks living under the apartheid system I had no idea no clue and so it was very eye opening when I went the first time in 2017 I always wanted to bring the family back there to see how that how that regime went but brother Papo he knew that regime he was raised under it and they had tags that you'd have to wear to to be in the city after 5:00 you can be sided and arrested if you're a black man or colored you're in the wrong District so you have these passes and tags you wore he said he had like three different tags that he wore just to prove he was in the right place or had the right to be in the right place at a certain time it's like the Jim Crow but on steroids and so when you hear that my first time I went I have to drop this in first time I went I had an idea of who Nelson Mandela was but then when I went to Robin Island and I saw the plight and I saw him being in prison for 27 years for his wanting some freedoms and so forth I had a different respect and I came back here and I mentioned the admiration that I had for uh this man and one of the brothers here he said well to me he was nothing but a renegade well coming from your views maybe but you'd have to hear what they were fighting for and struggling for and I know that brother Brandon would have stood for anti-apartheid for sure that's all through the message no question their ideas there was that a black man didn't even have a soul they taught that in their churches in their schools and so you know you hear Brother bam talk about it on the tape you know they're running through there and he told him to slow down he says well he he doesn't even have a soul so brother randam dealt with that I'm so glad that that's on the tape at any rate so you have these different townships in these very very poor are areas and that's the first place we spoke on the Saturday morning in this place called sugundo primarily Zulus and the uh I think sutus and clausa tribes and this brother VY Livingston uh started a little work there or there was a pastor that passed and he took over this work and these folks come to church and they come to serve the Lord and you just they say Amen to the same quotes we say Amen too so you I mean when you show up you know uh this ain't home this ain't the old neighborhood but when the Praises start going up and the preaching start oh my you you fit right in brother Bobby just you don't see nothing else and so um we had a wonderful time U ministering to those folks Sun that Saturday night we had a communion service with them um it was their communion service that they had had and just uh oh my you talk about the singing and fired up oh my goodness and I was preaching and I said you know and I was kind of teasing I said they won't let me dance back at home but I feel like dancing here this morning and I almost cut one I almost turned a loose out there but I certainly enjoyed the atmosphere and they so respect uh the American and our stand for the word and it was there we got the news that um our faithful brother Billy Paul had gone on to get his reward and so sad to to see that you know of course you know brother Billy Paul was a dear friend of ours dear friend to many of the Believers here and we love him dearly and we know that um we know that you know I'm not ashamed of of brother Billy Paul not at all and uh his testimony I believe is true amen amen in fact I believe he would have to be arguably the greatest witness that the world has ever known one of them you have to it's arguable you say the disciples saw Jesus brother Adam said that he Jesus did more in my Ministry and so the magnitude of Miracles the light that come in our day brother sister don't ever be ashamed of that stand with it stand for it and um God will bless you they'll the rest of the world will figure it out later if they going to figure it out they try to figure this out try to make it say this or don't say it like that you're going to no no no no no God revealed the word to us in this day we got the truth and we should we should tell it just like it was given to us you know I was thinking about brother brandham going on the field telling the people that an angel came to him and that you know that this the great miracle of creation of squirrels I mean who can say that who else could he compare that with nobody else is talking like that but you know he stood on it and then in Houston that photograph was taken yes sir and he said that wasn't taken from me that was for you he said I believe this is to prove that I was already telling the truth so he didn't he didn't talk about this light after the picture was taken he talked about it before in years and the criticism and that you know whatever the misunderstanding and then God has the picture taken it's hanging in Washington DC today and we thank God for it same thing with the cloud ring there we were just in Sunset yesterday we hiked in with a small group of us Levi and Josh and some brothers from the Phoenix for the art and them like to greet the Saints in Phoenix by the way appreciate Brother Art putting that group together and we were able to hike in yesterday and just stand on those grounds again and knowing what God did in this day and it's under attack and it's not by coincident I don't coincidence I don't believe that as some of the great Ministries some of the great Ministries that have uh gone off the scene the eyewitnesses brother McHugh I knew him personally brother Perry green many of us knew him personally brother Bernie Garcia Roy Carpenter eyewitnesses tremendous man of God for Arizona I'd say and even there's others for sure you see how those men are taking off the scene and then you see these other Ministries that have been preaching the message for 40 plus years they they've turned in they're they' turned aside from it and they said it's not true and I don't think that's a coincidence I think those shifts happened and so I believe us losing our dear brother Billy Paul there's another one to come there sure there's more Ministries to Fall by the wayside and we shouldn't be surprised at that amen so the amount of years someone has preached or stood for it uh it's possible there's another one going to fall uh back into the things of the world and preach against it but that's that's to be but it doesn't take away from what we have in this day and a great witness a tremendous eyewitness in our day that's brother Billy Paul is has gone on and so that's a that's a sad time for us and we know the enemy is going to try to attack that vacuum but stay encouraged stay with the word these things things are true they happened all right amen amen Saints all right and so um and then that was Saturday and then Sunday morning we spoke for brother VY in another Township called Soo some of you may have heard of that it's very very I could say it was it was just poor and then and then it's but it's being trying to be developed we we preached there some of the best singing I heard him my life and brother vy's church Sunday morning then we left that and went right to the airport and caught a flight for 2: pm. to go to Cape Town and I spoke for brother Becket in Cape Town Sunday night Tuesday night I spoke again for brother Becket they were very very happy very very lovely very appreciative and then Wednesday morning we got on the flight from Cape Town back to Johannesburg and spoke for brother Brian n who's in the city of Johannesburg and uh we had a Wednesday night service for him with him and then we had to catch a flight at 3:00 a.m. in the morning after the service so we didn't even get to get back and rest a little bit and so but that's the way it went and so um and from there we went into Kali Rwanda and that's where brother bonso's wedding was and that was like a movie movie being a part of of his uh the the the dowy ceremony that's just one day then the wedding itself is another day and it was just phenomenal just all the traditional the way they they um ask for the bride and the family speaks she has Representatives he has representatives and they both speak back and forth on where are you going to take my daughter what do you have for her are you going to fly her around is it first class is it you know is just back and forth a little banter a little and Bonza sitting in the back not saying a word the bride is in another room somewhere we ain't seen her for hours and I look at the brother I said when's When's the sister coming out oh she's coming the bride is coming hour or two later yeah the bride is coming I was like brother we've been saying that for 3 hours we were sitting there going back and forth in two or three different languages I didn't understand everything but she's coming she's coming so this all of this built up built up and and then finally she comes and then the dancing begins yes Believers that dance all right uhhuh and the family members and this and that and oh my so much to see they had a wonderful time they really love brother bonso there he's done very good for himself they love him very very much and um the young lady he married they've known her for years years and so two families joining together it's not an overnight event in fact the manager of our hotel he was there this the community there you're expected to be there it's not like an invitation if you know someone is getting married if you halfway know them you must go to the wedding that's the idea and so it's packed out with people food food and laughing and lots of just camaraderie is just a huge event whistling and Howling and praising and just it's a wedding and they really put their whole heart the brother told me uh we won't be able to go any to any stores today cuz we'll be at the wedding I'm like but it's all day long and so they expect you to preach the gospel at the wedding because there's visitors there and so I did preach a little bit and had the ceremony another brother preached I'm sure some of y'all couldn't hang but but you have no choice but to hang if you was there so ain't nobody else leaving so you wouldn't leave either besides where you going your ride ain't leaving so you ain't leaving so we enjoyed that it was really full very the Lord really spoke to my heart in so many different ways learning from different people and how they do things it was just really humbling and beautiful and then our last service was Sunday morning for a brother there in the city of uh keali in Rwanda there's a major storm hit there and we lost power for a little bit but they got a generator and this city of Kali is just a beautiful I'm taking my time this morning a little bit I we'll get right into the word in just a minute the city of the Rwanda was has gone under this great um genocide in ' 94 I believe it was two different tribes the huttis and the tosis lot of Bloodshed and so with that history the people there are very very humble and they're trying to rebuild the country and it's the cleanest place I've ever been to In My Life safe you talk about safety the brothers there even this brother from the Congo he said you can leave your wallet or anything no one is going to steal anything from you here I mean absolutely you just feel the atmosphere we went into the what they call the ghettos the poorest Parts no trash nowhere very very clean they have a cleaning day for the for every month that every citizen has to go through and clean or they'll be fine and you just you could just see all the way through it's well thought out how they're trying to rebuild it and they're trying to uh keep the you know the favorability upon the V visitors because the you know the um that's their income primarily is outside visitors so we had had a wonderful time with that beautiful place beautiful country but as they say there's no place like home and I'm so glad to be back home with the Saints of the most high God Amen and so we like to go into the word and there again we will uh like to um welcome Doug's mother there is Jackie there she's in the back she had surgery just a few days ago and Doug always tries to make sure we pray for her don't forget my mom pray he tries he has his little friends that he wants us to pray for and so we try to pray for them we met Doug during the during the um the heart of the coid went to to preach at the park there we met him and and he's been around with us ever since and now his mother is here with us isn't that nice can we give the Lord a hand of praise to welcome her it's Jackie here for the first time so God bless them I met her last night went and went to her little home there and met her and so she said she would be here and she's here so God bless her so we like to go right into the word I've taken a bit of time and um but we have a message that we brought here once before and I'll go a little bit further into it if the Lord would help me I thank you musicians and we would stand and take our Bibles and turn to Exodus chapter 13 and I say again that us not being tired or worn out we had one flight cancellation and that turned out to be God's grace for us that was great um and we we didn't get sick and I know it's for for the Saints praying for us and I want to I want to really highlight that I really appreciate your prayers and I thank you for that that's the best thing the greatest thing you can ever do for me is to pray for me and I I'll pray for you so I thank the Lord for that Exodus and verse 1-4 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying sanctify unto me all the firstborn whatsoever open the womb among the children of Israel both of man and of Beast it is mine we'll take one more scripture in Numbers chapter 3 in verse number 10 thou shall appoint Aaron his sons and they shall wait on their priest's office and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death and the Lord spake unto Moses is saying and I behold I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all of the firstborn that opened the Matrix among the children of Israel therefore the Levites shall be mine one more scripture in Hebrews chapter 12 verse number 23 you have that you can say Amen to the general assembly and Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and the title of our message this morning is the making of a firstborn the making of a first born let's pray Lord Jesus bless your word bless your people we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated the making of a firstborn and uh we brought this here I think last year it's the first time I started going into this particular message there's a lot that goes to it but I won't go into all of the details as I've have done before it seems to have highlighted itself again to me on this trip the making of the firstborn and I want to sh share as we read in the scripture in Exodus chapter 13 that the Lord Hallows the firstborn position in Israel and it was hallowed because their life was was at stake that if if if if the sacrifice isn't done correctly then the first born will be put to death not the second born not the Third born the first born's life will be taken in Pharaoh's house in the prison in the dungeon among animals all of the firstborn will be taken when I come to Smite Egypt in the great Exodus so what does this do this raises the value of that firstborn child the firstborn position is raised now because that's the position to be put to death if we don't get it right so he's going to put all of Pharaoh's firstborn to death but not only Pharaoh all of Israel too they had to make sure their sacrifice was correct and right and so forth so let's fast forward a bit to Numbers Chapter 3 The Lord does a strange thing or phenomenal thing now where in Exodus we read that the firstborn shall be mine now the Lord says in Numbers Chapter 3 he calls Aaron he says separate the Levites and the Levites shall be mine and what he does is he tells Aaron and he tells Moses to number all of the men of the tribe of Levi and these men now will become my firstborn so whereas all of Israel's firstborn were hallowed now the Lord is moving all of the firstborn position from all of Israel over to the tribe of Levi and he's doing that for a reason he tells them to number them of the of the of the boys six months older or three months can't remember the number quite clearly yet but just a few months oh that little levite boy they counted them there were 22,000 boys in the tribe of Levi of the firstborn of all the other tribes there were 22,277 it was almost an equal number the 273 if you read Numbers Chapter 3 I encourage you to do so the Lord tells Moses to take a tally or take a number of money to make up the difference bring that to the priest it'll go into the treasury 273 I think 50 shekels per uh 273 and that's going to swap out and make this number equal now brother bham makes this statement about the Levites and he says this in the message questions and answers paragraph 245 he says now one day there was sin in Israel and there was a man by the Trea of the name of Levi they pulled their swords they went with Moses to the camp and they destroyed everything that was sin is that right God looked down and said because you did this and stood for me all of these others will serve you and you go right into the temple as priest so the Lord was pleased with what Levi did this tribe did in Exodus 32 what what took place so Moses was going off of the mountain a little bit longer than the people thought he was gone so long that the people said we don't know what happened to him let's make our own God so we encourag Aaron they make a calf and they begin to worship this Idol on top of the mountain God is dealing with Moses giving him Commandments God sees this them and gets angry and wants to destroy them and Moses stands in the Gap like a true Prophet would a true leader would you know look at the offer that God offered Moses I want you to look at this God said I will wipe them out and I'll start another Nation with you y and if Moses really didn't like these people that would have been his time just to wash them off but he saids not so Lord let let it not be that you'll be angry with them because the other nations will say that you couldn't bring them out and the Lord hearkened to Moses but then when Moses comes down off the mountain and he sees the same thing that God sees he gets mad he gets so mad he wants to break something and he does break something he breaks the Commandments and then breaking them he's upset his anger and I've always said if Moses and God would have gotten mad at the same time the people would be finished that's right and you think about your sin what if God would have saw your sin sir outside of Calvary you would be finished too but somebody stood in between the Gap and said Lord he don't mean to be that way she don't know what she's doing Lord have mercy upon that that one was Christ the Lord Jesus Christ stood in the gap for you and I amen but no Moses was upset he comes down off the mountain and he says this who is on the Lord's Side and when he says that the Levites pop up they grab their sword they don't even know what they're about to do did just said who's on the Lord's Side Moses could have said who is on my side because Moses's side was the Lord's Side so Moses come out said who's on the Lord's Side didn't the crazy Levites stand up Moses says take your sword go through the camp and slay everything and they begin to slay and kill and God looked upon this and it was beautiful and because of this he separated them brother bam tells us so we see that this firstborn we know that the firstborn child they're just different aren't they huh y'all Ain going to help me preach y'all know what I'm saying is a truth how many how many firstborns here this morning let me see your hand one two three oo too many for one church we love them we love the firstborn but y all different you're very different God bless you Jesus was a firstborn that's right brother Brandon was a firstborn my wife's a firstborn no no no big deal but yall different we know that it's a birth order it's nothing you can do to become a firstborn but it's a hallow position we see this position hallowed with the prodical Son and the the the one the the the two boys one left and the other one uh uh stayed back and the firstborn had received all it's the a double portion we see that with Esa and Jacob this position of the firstborn it received a double portion from the father received greater it's a it's a beautiful position to be in but notice how God switches this firstborn Duty from all of Israel to just this tribe Levi and we see this switch happen throughout the scriptures and one of these places like I said is with Jacob and Esau Jacob was the second born but he wanted to be the first born and there was nothing he can do to change his birth order no matter how bad he cried or tried or wanted it Jacob just let it go man Esau is the first born and if you if you think of the impossibilities of some of the things that we're crying for God to do for us but nothing is too hard for God that's right and he can turn the impossible into the possible if you only believe so Jacob always on the heels of Esau wanting something that he could never get wanting a position that didn't belong to him he could not be reborn again but one day arrived where his brother was going to now sell that Birthright and the blessing that came with the birth order he swapped it and we see Jacob now receiving all the blessing that Esau had Genesis 48:18 we see this again where Jacob is going to bless his two grandsons Joseph's two boys manasse and Ephraim once's the first born once's a second born he goes to bless them and he crosses his hands and Joseph said no Daddy don't bless them this is the first one he says not so the Lord told me to do it this is the Lord now he's blessing Ephraim with the blessing of the firstborn through the cross through the cross hands prise God can I get a witness yes sir we see this at Calvary amen amen where the Old Testament Church and all the blessing of Abraham Isaac and Jacob is now leaving from the Jew over to the Gentile through the cross this is where it takes place this is where the switch happens is at the cross and we thank God for it don't we right we can take a scripture in Psalms 89 quickly and show you this taking place with King David I know this is review for many of you but it's still the truth and I can preach this message for the next rest of the year and a True Believer will still find somewhere to say amen amen your Bible is written that way amen Psalms 89 Verse 18 for the Lord is our defense the Holy One of Israel is our King then thou spakest in the to the Holy One is said I have laid and held upon one that is mighty I've exalted one chosen out of the people I have found David my servant with my holy oil have I anointed him so he's talking about David drop down to verse number 26 he shall cry unto me thou my father my God the rock of my salvation also I will make him my first born higher than the kings of the Earth so we know that David wasn't even the firstborn in his own family let alone the firstborn King Saul was but the Lord moved him into that position and this position of the firstborn we find in Hebrews chap 12 that the church is the Church of the firstborn the firstborn do not go into tribulation they make the rapture it's a big difference it's a different position we're not just talking about salvation we're talking about the sunship we're talking about all the blessings that come with that position it was hallowed it was God made it that way and so through the cross is where the great switch happens where your great grandfather maybe suffered with a temper and your daddy maybe a temper and Grandpa and all of them maybe had a temper or lust or alcoholism or whatever it is nervousness but at the cross you can find a position in Christ that has nothing to do with what Mom and Dad and them did it now switches you over into the position of a son or a daughter of God where does it happen at at the cross at at the cross at the cross that's where the switch happens that's where he changes your name he changes your status he even changes your past at the cross how many thank God for the cross if you got a Ministry today thank you Lord and you forget to preach about the cross you need to get back to the Cross if you're in a church and they don't preach the cross if you're in a relationship or a job or a career and you can't see the cross then get back to the Cross because at the cross is where it all happens that's where the power is sometimes we get so revelated and so anointed that we don't even preach Calvary anymore remind you of a little story one of the preachers would give about a little boy that got lost in the neighborhood or I think he was at the mall or somewhere and he got lost and the policemen find this little boy and ask him do you know where you live and he says no do you know the address no I don't know my address do you even know the neighborhood where you're from he says no says son you don't know where you come from I don't know who you are I don't know your address I don't know how to how to get you back home you've lost your mom you lost your position now what can we do and he says well sir in my neighborhood there's an old-fashioned church and on top of that church is an old-fashioned cross he said if you can get me to the cross I can find my way back home and that's the way I feel like we get lost in our Doctrine and our attitudes we get lost in our position and our gifts and talents but we need to find the cross in any service any Ministry any preaching any song service you got to find the cross because it's at the cross where we can find where home really is amen this message is All About the Cross amen amen amen amen so we see this great switch happen at the cross of where it takes place so now let me ask you how many firstborns are here today let me see your hands if you're a firstborn huh where' it happen at where'd you get that position at come on tell somebody like you believe it I wouldn't be nothing if it wasn't for the cross I wouldn't even know my I wouldn't be I would have no direction if it wasn't for the cross he makes the switch at the cross amen so let's take this position of the Levites just for a moment so he moves the Levites over to the first one position prophet of God continues in that message that I was just reading for you he says you stay right here in the temple and the rest of them will work and will bring a tenth and take care of you is that right oh Hallelujah if you can see what the temple was that the Levites were was the bride this is that first message I was reading from questions and answers paragraph 245 I'm at paragraph 246 oh Hallelujah if you can see what the temple was the Levites was the bride now when sin is waken in on every hand and the Levites is pulling their swords the holy ghostborn bride is standing out saying Jesus Christ in the positive is Jesus Christ in the negative just the same sin is still sin it's wrong to do these things that's right they're standing there with a sword oh Hallelujah brother bam continues on God says Come Ye now blessed of my father that is the bride so you see yourself in the scripture now amen you can see that Levi is a type of the Bride and what he did for a levite he made them the first born the levite is mine they're separated people God uses them many times in the scripture to prevent the mix from happening because there was a mixed multitude that went out of Israel and when Jacob had got into problems with his daughter Dena and those two companies of people wanted to get together and intermar and they made an agreement that if you all get circumcised then we'll become one of you Jacob agreed they all agreed but then Levi and his brother Simeon come through with the sword and killed all those men it seems harsh and it was harsh it seems quite you know you didn't keep your word and they didn't keep their word but when you look at the grand scheme of things God didn't want them two people mixing together anyways he didn't want um he didn't want Israel to mix with them and they all become one people so he allowed that separation to take place this happens this will happen with you and I too the word of the Lord calls for separation and it appears like you're losing something but you can't lose nothing that the word won't return back to you many times over and over again if you take a stand for the word and you lose a friend or two or you lose a ministerial contact or you lose an open door that you used to have and fellowship is gone and that you used to have but it if it was because of the word then take courage my brother my sister you didn't lose nothing you actually gained something because the word of the Lord is our absolute and every step that we take in that word is a step towards the Rapture which we're all trying to make here today and we're not gonna make a Rapture and not be a part of the firstborn with part of the word it's got to be all of the word so there's some separation that takes place he allows for this also with Phineas numbers 25 when there was BAC and balam had got the mixing with Israel and got them an influence of balam's teaching amongst them and they wanted to mix with the Midian itish women and and they partied and so forth and this young man by the name of Phineas he's a levite yes he didn't ask permission that's right he saw what needed to get done that's right he grabbed a javelin he didn't wait for Amen Corner he didn't wait for others to support him this is wrong and I need to take a stand for it that's what a True Believer does when we see it in the word brother that is your okay that is your thumbs up that is go get them when you see it in the word then God is giving you the permission by his word it didn't come doesn't come from other groups of men comes out of the word yes sir you listening to the message amen it strikes your heart come on when's the time to say amen that's right right now you cooking no big old steak and wait till everybody else get around to take a bite no that steak is ready eat it now and that's what the word of the Lord is to us we don't ask permission to say Amen we don't wait for the other churches to say Amen we don't wait till they catch up and understand what the vision meant it's not my business but when God opens my eyes to the truth glory to God now it's time for me to go forward what he showed me to do and that's what a firstborn will do he'll take the charge a little aggressive little rough on the edges but God is in it come on Phineas goes through and grabs that Javelin yes sir and there's no nice way to say this could you imagine a nice way to pierce somebody through with a javelin is there a more tactful way to do it no son get the javelin and put him to death and when he did it there was a plague that struck out when he did it other lives were saved because he took a stand for the word and when the Lord saw it he said my Covenant of Peace will be with you didn't ask Moses didn't ask Joshua then ask this group and that one it's called character amen character sees what needs to get done and they just do it amen am I right Saints like Rachel and or Rebecca with the camels watering the camels how many remember that she watered those camels didn't she who asked her to who probed her to no her character told her to cuz she saw this man that camels that needed water so she went and did it that's what character does that's what the word does for the belever belever it's always easier to go down a path that's already been blazed for you but some of the paths you got to go down by yourself yes sir God shows you before he shows somebody else before your peer group or the your little group of friends or your age group or your your your social class or your social you might be the first one who shows it to you got to make that move my sister my brother and God if it's the word now God will bless you for it so we see that through the scriptures this position of the Levites that moves forward and gets the job done they stop the halting they stop the mixing amen I like this what brother banam says in the message the indictment he's talking about this same scripture in Exodus chap chapter 32 where Moses said who's on the Lord's Side you see the Levites appeared after 2 and 1/2 hours 2 hours 25 minutes of preaching the indictment did we listen to that here uhhuh did you guys say Amen when he said came to this part what part was y'all sleep on come on somebody maybe we need to play it again tonight everybody ain't smiling but when he asked this question at the 2H hour and 25 minute Mark who is on the Lord's Side he says I say it on this tape for this audience I say it under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost who is on the Lord's Side let him come under this word God will truly bring this wicked Christ denying Christ rejecting generation into judgment for blasphemy for me the crucifixion of his identified word they're coming into judgment I indicted who is on the Lord's Side said Moses let him come unto me with the pillar of fire hanging there as an Evidence who is on the Lord's Side let him take up this word deny his Creed and follow Jesus Christ daily and I'll meet you in the morning amen now can I say something here The Prophet could have said who is on my side y'all didn't worry about it when I said Moses could say that but now the prophet could say who is on my side let him take up his cross and follow the word the message of the hour I want you to think about that we're in this hour in this changing of times where people are shifting in their position and they're going back now remember at the cross he moves you into a firstborn position also it's at the cross where he moves all of your sins from off of you and they places it on Satan for the day of the judgment amen how many thank God for the cross at the cross he blocks out your old book and he begins a new book under the Lamb's Book of Life at the cross he makes a minister out of you a lady out of you a Believer out of you where you used to be a doubter a luster a evil worker but now he made you a CHR Christian this all happens at the cross now this cross was not an easy task there was a price that was paid at the cross so can I get into this just for a little bit where do the Levites come from they come from their birth mothers brother bam deals with these birth mothers under their labor pains and if you take the scripture in fact we'll take one scripture here let's take oh my Genesis Chapter 30 I think is what I want y' got time do I have plenty time though there's a difference now all right let's get it Genesis Chapter 30 I think go by my memory you remember Jacob marri's two girls or two sisters Leah and what was the other one's name Rachel Leah was by contract because she was the first born Rachel was by love Jacob loved her is that right Saints and he couldn't make himself stop loving Rachel because he married Leah they switch it up on him at the marriage day the Bible says that in the morning behold It was Leah and it shook him if we'd all be honest it would Shake us too I thought you was Leah I thought you was Rachel but you're really Leah huh and she played the role didn't she that don't happen overnight now she played the role I'll let your imagination go further into that you know are you kind of sound like Leah are you right oh I'm rightel but Jacob did the same thing didn't he to his daddy his dad rubbed him on his head man you your voice sounds like Jacob but your skin is are you is yeah I'm Esau he got over didn't he but in the morning it was Leah oh what a payback he rubbing on Jacob he he thinks that's Esau he's rubbing on Leah thinking it's Rachel so when God pays you back you get paid back real good I guess that's the point in that she bear Jacob no children Rachel envied her and said unto Jacob give me children or else I die and Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel and he says am I in God's standad who hath withheld who hath withheld from Thee the fruit of the womb and she beheld my maid bah and she said behold my maid Billa go unto her and she shall bear upon her knees that I may also have children children by her so it's where Napal is born let's see if you can help me find that verse there huh verse number eight yes in verse eight this is it right here thank you brother and Rachel said with great wrestlingspotlight wrestling that's going on between these two sisters and brother bham calls it the labor pains that goes with the birth that goes with the cross the switching that takes place it's a new birth this new birth is something that we labor on it even in this little church here the beginning of the year we try to have some meetings for that for for those that wanted to receive the Holy Ghost the enemy wasn't happy with that he's still not happy with it he wants to grow cold on that but it's a birth it's a death it's a Str it's wrestling it's two sisters wrestling one wants to have children and she can't the other one wants her husband's love but he can't and it creates this wrestle between the two sisters brother Bram calls it labor pains it's through these labor pains that the gifts come forth through these labor pains that Ministries are born yes yes we don't see it like that all the time but that's how it comes it was in her own house was her great enemy brother mam tells us in the message the ark he says this here I was reading the other day while sitting on the Creek Bank of how those Hebrew mothers that give birth back there to the Patriarchs each one when she come forth and uttered his name while in labor said what he would be and what he would be in the last days not knowing what she was doing and muttering take a hold of Genesis 49 take it out type it out where they're in time where they're at and watch what it is it's right there so it looks like a carnal battle between two sisters give me children L I die and Leah every child she said now my husband will be joined to me or now my husband will love me or now because I borne him another son he'll draw closer to me all of her everything was about her love from her husband to be complete and that's how she named those kids those children and it looks like a carnal battle it is a carnal battle but it was a supernatural naming through the labor pains here what brother Ram says here I like this one if I don't get another one we'll get this one in this in the message Revelation a book of symbols all right paragraph 55 catch this first part this is not really with our message but catch this is really nice Angelic beings Associated together oh I hope you get that that just dropped right down free look and if you got the holy spirit in you then you're a candidate for association with the Unseen World and the supernatural no wonder people can't believe in those things they never come in contact they got nothing in here to believe with but when the Holy Spirit comes Into the Heart quickly he becomes then a two-fold being one of the earth to die one of Heaven to live Amen in his body he's still subject to death but in his soul he's passed from Death unto life in his body he has Earthly contact with five senses in his Spirit he has contact with God through the Holy Ghost and the angels of God visit them speaks with them and they are messengers sent from God to reveal and to bring messages from God to the individual how many love that that's for people who have the Holy Spirit you're in in contact with another world there's messages that come to you like right now Sunday morning like in your prayer time like when you're listening to the tapes like when you're reading God's word there's messages does come to you from another world oh my he's out to get the first thing first you can't put the Koopa on before the foundation is laid so you got to remember that put first things first seek ye first the kingdom of God and its righteousness and all these other things will be added unto you Amen brother ban continues on paragraph 57 a boy was at the door knock at the door there and told the Usher I have a telegram here from Mrs so and so and Mr so and so he would be a messenger or an Earthly Angel your pastor when he stands here on the platform ministering the word of God he is an angel of God to the church Messenger to the church therefore Pastor should never leave that word but stay straight with the word because he's feeding the shepherd's Place cu the word pastor means a Shepherd look it up and find out if it ain't right a pastor is a shepherd and the Holy Ghost has made him overseer over a certain flock to feed them what with the word of God Amen oh my watch all those names they mean something every name in the Bible when you see one name in the Bible it means something did you know Israel's wives when they gave birth to the 12 Patriarchs each one of those mothers when they were having the baby and the baby was being born and them groaning and the groans that they came out and name those boys the very groans that they give signify the nature of the child and the place they'd make their final resting place every GR gr amen under the power of the Holy Ghost that's the reason we should be groaning in the spirit now I don't mean a lot of this put on but I mean really in travail for the church then the Holy Spirit then you can get some real speaking with tongues and interpretation the Holy Spirit making utterance that tells through groans prayer be real truth to it it'll be something right now that you'll see take place Amen Let Me Go a little bit further in the message adoption I have a few more minutes the message adoption 1960 brother bam says this here paragraph 48 notice this just burns our heart each one of those Hebrew mothers giving birth to those children she spoke the very place in her labor pains where they would be positioned in the promised land oh it's a great study if we can only go into details which would take hours after hours someday we'll get our church fixed I like to come and take a solid month or two and just stay right with it watch when they come each one of those mothers when she called out Ephraim when she was in labber positionally placed him where his feet was setting in oil just exactly every one of them whenever they were wherever they were at Joshua not knowing this but by inspiration L of the Holy Spirit after being in the promised land give each man his promise exactly what the Holy Spirit promised through the birth back there how that God has set some in the church through the labor pains oh they get tremendous sometimes when a church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world Believing on the Lord Jesus Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was to Pentecost how they grown under labor pains but when they are born and positionally Born Into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has set in the church some Apostles some prophets some teachers amen some pastors some evangelists then he gives into their speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues knowledge wisdom Gifts of healing all kinds of Miracles so this comes through the labor pains the labor pains is the birth of something a true Ministry has to go through that birth a True Believer is birth into the kingdom of God you're not just set out with a Ministry you're born into it and brother bam is bringing us how these gifts they're through the labor pain just brought out these names of these boys that come through they they were Patriarchs through these mothers wrestling with one another love and and fertility and being able to be born and I was first and your last it was deception oh my sister and all this great wrestling and through it all God is birthing a nation birthing Patriarchs and these labor pains don't stop Even in our Christian church today we want everything to be nice and great but it's not going to be in fact you'll know true Ministries through the Winds of unbelief that come around some people might just swallow anything go for anything go for anything but you see somebody take a stand for the word you say oh wow that's a gift that's a real son right there that's a levite that's a first born that's a bride member cuz everybody that get the Bible ain't the bride but she will show who she's is when the word comes out who's on the Lord's Side those opportunities will come they're here today amen who's on the Lord's Side mhm can you see that church that's Calvary he makes the great switch at Calvary doesn't he that's where the new birth takes place when you have your own Calvary that day on Calvary you have that day your day on Calvary and that's where this switching of natures takes place it's not an easy easy happening at all the one that brought this message with the tremendous gifts in his life suffered his life was squeezed until he wanted to give up he wanted to commit suicide he wanted to throw in the towel but God had his hand over his life what about you and I brother and sister you know this making of a firstborn or God bringing you into position of the firstborn you got to be in the word my brother my sister it's a life of prayer it's staying steady through the hard times steady when others can't you know all of Israel falling for that golden calf could you imagine seeing your relatives and friends all caught up with Aaron with the golden calf I mean the majority was doing it but when Moses came now say who's on the Lord's Side so glad somebody stood up said I'm on the Lord's Side yes you have the opportunity to take that stand this morning who's on the Lord's Side side tell you right now it's not going to be the majority that's right it's going to be the minority but it's through these labor pains that pastors are developed evangelists are developed real friends are developed people you can trust are developed praise the name of the Lord you see everybody shifting this way and people backsliding going this way and this one running over here and that one running over there you watch that man that stays steady with the word you watch that sister that stays steady with the word that's the one you need to be close to they are you you are them you the same same breed amen oh my can I continue for a few more minutes not even 12:00 in Africa didn't give me no problem we was on on African time amen praise the Lord God bless you amen let's go a little bit further I just want to take this part here in this why it had to be Shepherds paragraph number 17 another reason I might say notice the babe was born in Bethlehem Bethlehem Hebrew interpretation as we uh had a couple years ago Bethlehem means the house of God's bread we proved in the scripture he could not come any other place Bethlehem was founded by Rahab her husband Rahab was a harlot that a general courted Israelite Army after they had taken Jericho and by faith she believed the message of God in her condition she was saved and from there when Joshua divided up the lands of where each one would be there's a great lesson that sometime I hope to be able to bring at toussant of these Hebrew mothers giving birth to those babies when she groaned at the birth pain of the baby she called the name of the baby and that positionally placed it in the promised land in its tribe the great thing all the word of God fits right together if it doesn't fit together it's not God's word that's Misfits it's your thoughts it's misfitting to the word it all fits together so let's go into this birth just a little bit further we know it happened at the cross but brother Brandon preaches a message entitled birth pains and it makes this statement I think it's in paragraph number 89 I was listening to this the other day remember this message birth pains is a powerful message if you get a chance to listen to it this message the birth pains is where he he shares the great vision of the Bride the vision of the Bride that he had also brings in the Judgment of California which a lot of people are shaking over because they want to take brother Billy Paul's testimony and try to make that fit and make that fit with that one he says sharks will be swimming and and if the sharks are swimming did B Billy Paul know it took place or it did take place look let me just say this come on now it was thus said the Lord California is going down do you believe that yes or no finalize okay so with the cloud picture here so I'm bringing this up cuz while I was abroad a little there some of the brothers would ask me so brother Israel what what do you think about this thing with brother Billy Paul being gone brother it's just a distraction what do you mean what do I think what was I supposed to change that's right look who brother Billy Paul gave a true testimony and I believe his testimony is true that's it that's right nothing else to add to it you believe he is or you don't believe it I believe he a true witness and so one of the brother asked about the cloud ring and brother Banner was supposed to be in Houston when those kids and it was it hunting Seas it was it not was those dates in collaboration wait stop right there there's a cloud ring up there do you see the face of Jesus there did that happen that settles it that's it you can try to make dates work if you want to but God never called me to make the dates work he called me to say Amen to a Vindicated message and that's what I'm going to do say Amen to the word that God send in this day come on I like brother McHugh when he says I'm not an explainer I'm a believer I'm a preacher that believes I'm not a preacher that explains I'll explain to you that you need to believe that's my explanation believe all that the prophet has spoken the vision over California wasn't brother Bam's idea the Lord spoke to him the vision of the tent wasn't brother bram's idea the Lord spoke to the vision all the Visions none of them were his idea God spoke to him and as a Believer as a preacher that's what I preach that's what I say Amen to what God done in this day leave it to the explainers to explain that's good yes praise the Lord on Amen did I get that off my chest did I deliver it like I felt it yes I am a believer of this message what's on the tape it praise the name of the Lord in the message birth pains paragraph number 43 brother bam says this here and I have to close here he says I believe that Jesus here was speaking of as he said you will have sorrow so let's take the scripture here just for a moment just before we close it's in St John let's see excuse me just one moment chapter 16 turn there quickly and we'll close with this scripture St John chapter 16 there's two different forces working today in this message birth pains explains it all you say St John chapter 16 quickly amen Jesus speaking of his departure what verse did I call verse 20 verely verily I say unto you that you shall weep and lament but the world shall shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into Joy a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow because her hour is come but as soon as she is delivered of a child she rememberthe anguish old things are passed away for joy that a man is Born Into the world this is the believer's experience this is what Calvary does there is pain there is sorrow there is death associated with this new birth and anytime the ministry removes that part out of the Christian experience then that is not a true Christian experience you come to the Lord Jesus to die of the old self your old thoughts we're not here to make up make you over and try to clean you up no you have to die all the way completely die and then be reborned again that's the calvary experience that we're talking about we're not talking about you coming in and just getting a little anointing on you and say you've been switched over to the firstborn you're not switched over into a firstborn until you've been born again when you're born again your birth brings you into that firstborn position which is the Bride of Jesus Christ which you escaped the tribulation now ready for the Rapture can I get a witness this is what Calvary is all about this is what Jesus is speaking of here about the New Birth the birth of Christianity brother banam says it well he says it right here that's his opening scripture for birth pains paragraph 43 say I believe Jesus here was speaking of says you will have sorrow M but your sorrow be turned to Joy speaking to his disciples here knowing that the birth of Christianity was coming into existence when did you come into existence oh my at the cross at the cross where I first saw the light and the burden of you know how the church came into existence it was a miracle it a miracle what happens to the individual is that right Saints is that right church let me read the quote here just fires me up speaking to his disciples here knowing that the birth of Christianity was coming into existence and now the old has to die in order that the new is born to have anything that gives birth has to have Pains of distress and they certainly was going going to go through the pain of distress and anguish to get from the law unto Grace paragraph 61 now we notice that it always my thought now to you it takes pain this same message sorry it's in the birth pains just drop down to paragraph 61 we notice that it always my thought now to you it takes pain distress discomfort look how them Pharisees die to that law through pain distress discomfort but it must be praise the Lord don't you love the Lord amen God's got something good in store for you it always starts with the dying out of of the old and bringing into the new do we really want more of God well it costs a greater price I have more I can say here I'll just stop right there I really see this end time shift amongst Ministries and church groups and trying to look more like the organization and trying to you know pattern ourselves with the love that the world has and there's nobody in the world can teach you how to love outside of God and a Vindicated message amen don't let the devil fool you or get you sidetracked on something else stay with the word stay with the Vindication stay with this message God called us to it and it takes a strong hand to stay right with it yeah there's lots of strong influences that riseing have Rosen up and they will continue to rise remember there'll be a new doctrine that'll start here shortly I don't know what it's called but we know it's going to come right and guess what there's some people that going to believe it right and it goingon to run after people you know are going to run after it this is what we need to do this is how stay with the word Saints stay with this message stay with the Bible the Holy Ghost stay with the prophet ET stay with the Lord's Side God bless you in the name of Jesus Christ God bless each of you amen let us pray thank you Lord for your word today we thank you for your Saints gathered here Lord we thank you for the admonition the Holy Spirit guiding us watching over us oh God I pray Lord that you would help us father to be faithful all the way to the end Lord to be faithful to the Vindicated message that you sent in this day Lord it seems oh God

of the midianites and the the different things that are taking place you see the you see the Levites come on the scene Lord you said they are mine he said they are your firstborn he said that was the
