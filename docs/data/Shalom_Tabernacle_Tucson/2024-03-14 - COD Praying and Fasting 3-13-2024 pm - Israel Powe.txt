savior the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ and greet each of you in his precious name it's so good to be back with you um apologize a little bit for not being here at the appointed time on Sunday but we got across that border or tried to get across the border and it was just a long line and then the time and so forth but we're here tonight we're glad glad to be here with you and we trust the Lord will bless you we like to go right into the scriptures tonight and it's on as we've been in the cond cond order and Doctrine and we've been on conduct for quite some time and we're going to maybe finish that up tonight on a little subject of conduct that I include in this and that is fasting and praying and I'd like to find our scripture tonight in Matthew chapter 6 our lord Jesus and I spoken here at the church on it before and I just want to bring it to you again uh tonight as I believe that it's as part of our um the things that we do um in our conduct we know that our life is not our own and that um we have given our life over to him and so we took that first service on Behavior we talked about the cost of discipleship and then our post of Duty and then forsake not the assembly um and then we spoke on giving your best last week we spoke on how how we dress men and women how we should dress and then tonight we're going to talk on uh fasting and prayer in Matthew chapter 6 let's take that for our scripture we'll have you seated after we read Matthew chapter 6 and verse number 16 moreover when you fast be not as the Hypocrites of a sad countenance for they disfigure their faces that they may appear unto men to fast verily I say unto you they have their reward but thou when thou fast anoint thy head wash thy face that thou appear appear not unto men to fast but unto thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly notice Jesus said when you fast not if you fast it's when you fast we'll take one more scripture in 2 Chronicles chapter 7 I don't see my amen group here tonight brother George usually helps me out John sometimes Brother Scott helps me let me see who don't help me see I think you all help me right you going to help me tonight all right 2 Chronicles chap 7 verse number 14 If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and will heal their land amen may God bless you bless the reading of this word you may be seated I want to thank brother Joe for taking the service for Sunday morning and brother George on Sunday night and taking those services and brother the different ones that were here to help keep the work of the Lord moving forward I appreciate that each and every one of you amen we thank the Lord for them and so this uh subject on fasy I'm not going to take every scripture on it and bring it like a teaching I'm just going to bring out some of maybe the highlights of what brother bandam has taught us and showed us when I first came into the message we would hear the main thing about fasting that I would hear amongst the fast the the message groups they would say well brother brandom says uh you only fast when God puts you on the fast and when you're fasting you won't hunger and he did say that but that's not all he said and we're going to bring that balance for you here uh tonight the Lord willing and just show that fasting is something that you add with your prayer life it's a resource to to call on God and and the power of the spirit comes when we deny the things of our Earthly uh pleasures and one of those Pleasures that we have gotten into is eating actually overeating and we showed you in the scriptures about our dress and the way we dress and I showed you even the way we live our lives from the Old Testament author which was God who gave it to Moses he's very concerned about the details and we might think well that's too much control or too much in my life but God's the one who instituted all of the laws and it's actually sinful to overeat that's right and I wonder if we any any of us ever been guilty of that getting that second plate because the mac and cheese was so good I had to get some more and but there's a there's a dis discipline that we need to be conscious and aware of of course we have to eat but then get into this thing of over eating and Jesus said Beware he gave us a warning he said remember in the days of Noah and the days of lot they were OV eating they were eating drinking giving that's all they talked about and tell me why every new construction Corner how many different hamburger stands do we need how many variations of a hamburger can you make I mean in coffee shops in different flavors and then and the different types of foods and then we eat and then we eat meals between between another meal and another you just get caught up in it and it's the age that we live in and Jesus told us to beware so I want to read this quote for you that this is the one that we all know about it seems brother Brandon makes this statement and says this here in the inner Veil sorry sis but yeah you're going to have to help me out tonight I didn't give her any quotes but Christianity is not something God's not one you have to beg and cry and plead and fast and starve and everything like that to get to certainly not I'm not degrading the fast but here not long ago a man wrote a book on fasting my women come into the meeting and men who went on those fasts went on those fasts that were insane they went just because the book said to fast 40 days some of them with false plates and their teeth would drop out their eyes would sink back mothers to be women to be mothers their little ones as you understand they would completely go mentally out and be taken in institutions many many of them come in that condition I believe in fasting certain L but when you fast you don't hunger Jesus after he had got through fasting the Bible said he was hungry God puts a fast on you you don't put it on yourself he certainly captured the women the man did that wrote the book when he said put a picture of a woman there she looked 20 years younger said after the fast you saw you ought to seen her then just about a year later what she looked like after that certainly you don't do that you don't do things by works it's by Grace brother random continues in the message and so we've heard that haven't just heard that in the message that God puts a fast on you brother random separates a long fast and then he calls what he calls the command to fast and we read where Jesus says when you fast now Jesus also highlights this power of fasting and the importance of it in Matthew chapter 17 we like to turn there quickly with me and read Matthew 17 is also recorded in Mark chapter 9 but in Matthew chapter 17 they're trying to cast out this demon from this child and um verse 17 Jesus Matthew 17:17 says oh faithless and perverse generation how long shall I be with you how long shall I suffer you bring him hither to me Jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hour then the then came the disciples to Jesus apart and said why could not we cast him out and Jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily I say unto you if you have faith as the grain of a mustard seed you shall say unto this mountain remove hence To Yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you how be it this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting so Jesus is going to highlight the importance of the prayer and the fasting as it pertained to this man getting his Deliverance or God answering the prayer for this stubborn Spirit was stubbornness it wasn't just prayer alone it wasn't just good wishes alone but there needed another level to go with the prayers and I and I would just like to encourage you Believers that is a part of our weaponry is fasting with your prayers of course we know to pray we're supposed to pray there's a power in praying but when you couple your prayer with putting aside your food for a season however that may be then God somehow Honors that because when you're fasting you're denying yourself and when you're fasting in your body it's a feast with the Lord so you're separating the carnal man eating whatever the flavors and things you normally would eat three times a day sometimes six times a day and then sometimes we just we just ate but we're just going to the refrigerator looking going into the cupboard looking for something you're not hungry it's just we got into this thing and I'm talking about me okay and so why is that what is this about so in Mark chapter 9 let's take this in verse number 29 9 this is that same case and look at how Mark it's written in Mark vers 29 and he said unto them this kind can come forth by nothing but prayer and fasting he makes it exclusive that this power this demon to get the Deliverance it is nothing but by prayer and fasting let me ask you a question don't answer it but how many of you or have have Incorporated fasting into your prayer life especially when you're seeking a greater and closer walk with the Lord Brother bam talked about his sister Dolores that was fasting for the Holy Ghost he talked about in his meeting he had to be fasting for the demons to go out even though he was commissioned by an Angel and there is a there is a lifestyle that goes with this deliverance and so brother Brandon makes this statement here um in conference with God he says this here and I have many many quotes I'm going to keep right on my time here if I finish it I do if I don't I don't okay but we'll get to the main point here all right and conference with God 1959 when we have World conferences they usually have their selected play and what do they do at this conference they drink drinks cocktails they smoke cigars and cigarettes they lie to one another and deceive one another at peace talks of the world but when God calls a conference it's fasting cleaning up prayer receiving orders going forward that's God's conference not feasting but fasting not indulging in filth but separating cleansing yourself from all unrighteousness when you go before God cleaning Yourself by faith through the applying the HS up to the blood and cleansing your heart and walking before God uh be before God for a conference that that's the kind of a conference when you meet with God then God gives you orders then you go forward he goes with you he talks about in questions and answers that he's talking about his sister and Lois sister Lois how they were fasting for the Holy Ghost now look at this here and be Not Afraid um so brother Bam's on the mission field he's his ministry is flourishing and going forward and and he he says this here he says someone said to me I believe it was last evening he said brother brandom where does this come from how are you able to go meeting after meeting staying under the anointing even one sign made Jesus weak when the woman touched His Garment said I see you stand for hour under that I said I'd like to tell you here's where it lays he don't want me to say this but my brother said in here Jean go that boy don't touch bread or water for days fasting and praying hit there here sits Pat Tyler this other brother sitting here by him them men lay on their face without food and water when I'm in a meeting praying for me that's where it comes from if there wasn't something like that I'd go down that's the men behind the the curtain the men who prays for strength for a message that they lay down everything maybe they haven't got the gifts to do those things but they're putting every effort they can to support it you see where support is you see support isn't just financial support isn't just you being here this is how they supported him behind the curtain supported and the only way they can do it they know is prayer before God and fasting there's where power lays let someone pray for you now how many need some support this church needs support the ministry needs support our youth needs support the families here need support we have people that have been baptized and we want to see them filled with the Holy Ghost we want to see the ministry flourish we're not just making members to join a group but we want to see people move on to the next step with God and fasting is a part of the Christian Arsenal amen go pick it up go do it what's fasting you say brother this is it 40 days is it one day well the the real definition of fasting is when you're not eating so so um the term breakfast is breaking your fast you can have your breakfast at 12 or 1 or 3 that first meal we call it breakfast or breaking of your fast we hope you're not eating at night when you're sleep you wake up you have been fasting your body has it needs that rest of feasting and fasting in you need that balance you can't fast all the time you can't feed all the time you need that balance and the balance your body needs that rest and it's just a beautiful time there's many scriptures that talk about Rising early get up early we have asked the church to pray and it seems like a you know you know that's ear that early morning hour yes it's the sacrifice the our Saturday prayer morning prayer meeting is is a little sacrifice but typically if people come and get down to pray that early they haven't been eating and it's just a wonderful opportunity to to call on God it's always a wonderful time to pray and call on him when you're in that fasted condition it seems to to help even more it's scriptural it's throughout your Bible so brother random talks about the support behind the scenes from the people who didn't have the ministry that he had the Forefront but behind the scenes they didn't just fast with no food no food no water and that's a sacrifice that's deliberate particularly in this age where everything is centered around eating so much and we Christians we don't party we don't go out all we can do I think I heard brother green talk about how Christians that's all we got is church and fellowship we always going to get something to eat that's why we're a little bit on the chunky side some of us don't look around now right ain't nobody saying nothing but you know you'll see the Christians that's what we I mean there's no sin in eating no there's no sin in eating but you can overeat and you can get out of balance in that but look at this and you must be born again brother vom says this here and he says this in the me uh paragraph 21 he says I want to thank this little church for its pastors for the trustees and the deacons all the members and I'm grateful for the holy spirit that watches over them may they may that great Holy Spirit continually lead them and guide them in the path he would have them go in Reading in the Testaments the old and the new and also in the n n a AG that how that when sickness struck amongst the Saints the whole church went together with one heart they called on God and their petition was granted each one of them as members of the body of Christ fasting and praying and God heard and answered prayer father may this little church be so Bound in the bounds of love to each other and the Holy Spirit until it become like one of those that there will be no friction Among Us in this coming year may there be just such Godly love and everybody walking in the way of Christ until many weary pilgrims along the road will come and be saved may it be said that when you enter the doors of the little building that the presence of God meets you with a sweet welcome yes sir take sickness away from in the midst of us Lord what a powerful prayer just beautiful don't you want that in your church don't you want that in your home actually don't you want that in your own heart and life no friction get rid of the static and the friction and then no friction among us and so um the church would get together and fast and pray now this is difficult to get people to do because soon as you mention something like that it's like why what you know because the carnal man you know always you're you're it's just um it's just the way it is you can't hardly get people to get to come together for the prayer meeting it's difficult to get people to pray together difficult and I'm going to read for you here why I say that because the prophet said it all right you see if I can get it for you here quickly mhm yes somebody said don't let them find it no nobody here would say that but the enemy would say that but the believer says Lord let him find it yes it's right here in the message presuming paragraph 45 now if the Pentecostal Church would really live to its standard if it would live what it claims to have then the world would thirst after it but when they see the Pentecostal Church let down with just as many things almost as the world's got then they presume that they're just as good as you are that's right that's right they got a right to see but we got to get away from that we can't presume it we got to line up with the word you see now it's almost a impossible thing to get people praying and fasting praying fasting calling on the Lord seems like the church has got so drowsy lazy in these last days so pitiful I hate to come and just keep stirring and preaching and saying these things but brother sister that's the truth I just can't hold it it's the gospel it must must be preached it's got to be preached as a witness it's true so I think we just presuming to much so it's almost impossible to get people praying and fasting now if we knew the sign of the time and we do it would throw us into this fasting and praying we would add that to our daily walk and our daily life even if it's just half of a day or one meal or two meals and you add that to prayer um and brother brandom did that you say well brother Israel the Lord didn't lead me to do that I don't feel you know I feel like you know if I'm ever hungry then I know it's not God calling me to fast and as a result many people don't fast that that are in the message that's it's sad but it's true you know in our church Pentecostals that don't know these truths that we know many of them are big Believers in fasting and praying yes sir they call on it in their churches and it's strange how God answers them strange not in the message but God will answer a sincere heart and you apply this what Jesus said when you fast and if my people which are called by my name if you fast and all of the details on fasting how you you're giving up and setting thing the things of the world aside your diet and what you're eating and how you're eating you set that aside and we're going to pray for our meetings or we have a prayer line coming up we're going to pray for that and we're going to take for a week for a month you try bringing that to a church in the message a month of fasting every Friday heard did Brother manam tell us to do that you get the mumblers and the grumblers it's true it's true and because the Flesh and the carnal man don't want to do it but it's scriptural it's biblical and then we'll read we'll read the quotes here on it well brother bandam how he how he separates a long fast from the regular command to fast and here's what he says here in the message the resurrection of Lazarus paragraph number four if you keep your stomach empty the blood is at your brain you must be ready and if you're all full when that's the power of fasting when you're when you're full the blood goes into your stomach to digest your food you see and then when you're empty it's in your brain so you can be just cuz them two Spirits are so close it could deceive the very elect if possible and many times you hear it cry I've heard people shout now as I told you I hope God God that has let me find favor with you that you believe me I've heard people shout when it wasn't God I've heard people cry when it wasn't God see and there's sympathy sometimes the devil wants to be petted it's it takes a real sheep riser to know the difference between the bleet of a goat and a lamb they're so close together you see and so therefore on this platform you must be very careful can be just one thing in all that Satan want it could be one thing and and is all that Satan wants wants to throw out before the public so therefore I have to be fasting prayerful every minute on the guard watching for something in the message who is God paragraph 10 he says the night grows on of course I tire and tire more it is a truth that I believe as a physical man tears down the spiritual man has a chance that's what fasting in things are for he can have a chance to work upon these five senses of ours to bring us to believe even have faith in him I like the attitude I like the attitude of this Centurion tonight we just read of it so here brother bam is saying that when the physical man tears down it gives the spirit a chance and here our brother manam he took his ministry so serious that on the field he would be fasting when he go to pray for these in the prayer line he's fasting on his uh Ministry there serving the people and he had an angel that accompanied him that witnessed to him kept him all the way through his teenage years from going in the things of the world and yet look at the respect he had for his ministry and the people that he was serving on watch on guard and doing that part of that is this element that we call fasting and praying how about you and I today amen is it something that God bless bless you Brother David good to see you is it something that we can add a young Christian can add this to his prayer life I believe you should and I don't want the devil to rob you of this blessing that is absolutely scriptural and that God would use for your benefit that your spiritual man can grow so brother manam says in the message The Works that I do bear witness of me in Phoenix he says now we're going to read some of the word and then just comment two or two on it and then we're going to start the prayer line because I have this has been a fast day fasting and praying that God would Grant His blessings upon you people tonight so he says this in many places that Friday was a fast day for him this is brother brandham that he carved out one day out of the week that he was fasting there's no scripture that tells us us this there's no Old Testament or New Testament scripture that says you have to fast one day out of the week or Friday or Tuesday but this is what he did to add to his appreciation to the Lord and saving him and him being a minister of the Gospel a servant of the lord your life is not your own you're put here for a purpose and here is you know everybody else can eat and do whatever but but I'm going to take Friday and make that a day that I give to the Lord by pushing away my food what an example he says this in the message three Witnesses in Erie Pennsylvania paragraph 41 and I remember that one night coming in while I went up the hill at copio and we was coming down it was a fast day I fast much because meetings going on till I get real weak and then I have to eat a little but because this kind goeth out only by fast and prayer and I don't know what time that kind is going to be on the platform in the message at Thy word this is another Friday paragraph 19 one night they just piled up crutches and things to hold them around me for them to hold like this they wanted to take a picture of it some old canes and clubs everything that they've been walking with then I remembered I've been fasting it was just like tonight Fridays is a fast day has been for me for a long time brother Adam continues on so he's talking about this day Friday is a fast day for him mhm let me take this one here this is the message perseverance paragraph number nine I'm showing the example the prophet left for us paragraph number nine says today I was sitting in the room we had usually Fridays a fast day for me I don't eat sometimes Tuesdays and Fridays till sometime in the afternoon that's not a regular fast that's just a couple of days a week to fast so a long fast comes in more days when the Lord puts it upon you but that's just in respects and honor of God's Great Memorial to us the fasting a command amen and so after 3:00 usually I'll have a little something light somebody so here brother bam is showing us the difference between the long fast and the regular command to fast are you seeing that how many can say Amen to that he said the long fast the Lord puts that on you and when he puts that on you you don't hunger that would be however however many days but a short fast the command of fast could be half a day it could be a Friday it could be a Tuesday it could be a Sunday it could be whatever day say that the Lord would put that upon your heart but I you know I believe that it should be one day or someday or something that you can uh uh um do all right now we can support one another by fasting and praying for one another look at what the prophet tells us in Israel in the church paragraph 183 says God shake this little church this little old church like never before May the Holy Ghost get a hold of every person here cause them to fast and pray and lay on their face day and night screaming out Lord until the oldfashioned Revival breaks out here Lord and sweeps all out through here and sin in an oldfashioned time that'll bring men and women back to God Grant it father for we ask it in Jesus name amen amen shall We Stand I I think the last time I spoke on this or read some of these quotes uh someone here in the church here told me that that really affected them and they started fasting they take a day out of the week and they've been fasting and I appreciate that and I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure anyone that would have someone fasting and praying for them would appreciate that um I believe that we should be fasting and praying for our little church the Ministries here our music and the musicians the Ministries here the gifts and the talents here the call of God the visitors that come in our gates that they can find Salvation here the new comers that they will receive the Holy Ghost and may those that come up for prayer receive what we're asking for I believe that is accompanied with a Ministry like brother Adam's Ministry was a Ministry of fasting and praying he said I fast much that accompanied his ministry that was part of the sacrifice and I believe that we could we can have that too um in God's provided way the the prophet of God says this here paragraph number eight if you've been converted during this time of the Revival you don't have any church that you've taken up with yet I'd ask you to come join this little church it's a wonderful little place here to come serve the Lord if I lived here in this neighborhood I'd be a member of this church I'm a member of it anyhow I'm an associate pastor so I have to come back once in a while to see about my church and I look around you know so I'll be back to see you the Lord willing pretty soon and all of you people that's around in these other cities that belongs to these churches go to church every day every day that you can every day that they have service go attend your church be real loyal just stand by your church stand by your pastor help him out with everything you got give him spiritual support fast and pray for him and have faith in him and God will lead the church on to that glorious day that we're looking forward to come no matter you say well some our church don't believe well now just as long as you believe the main fundamentals and are born again of the spirit of God well you might believe Christ is coming on the White Horse and some believe he's coming on a white cloud and brother Adam continues on and so he's saying to fast for your pastor pray for the spiritual support and God will Le the church on to that glorious day now this quote is is for every everybody that would read it he said brother Israel you're reading that because you're the pastor whether I'm the pastor or not it's still a quote somebody's got to read it and somebody's got to hear it and then somebody should believe it and Obey it is that right because there is a power that comes with fasting and praying there is um now there's different ways you can fast and brother bam talks about that he in one of his fast he was just eating milk and crackers and he says that in the message why in bluming him Illinois and so you know we you know many people can Define what your fast is or you know no water or no juice or no you know hard Foods or whatever but here he he was talking about um in the message why paragraph number 16 well now when you come to the plat form that's you that's doing that like the woman touched His Garment it's your own faith that does that I have nothing to do it has nothing to do with me to me I can do I've asked God for something over and over for myself for the past five years he won't even say a word to me about it my own mother was laying here dying and saying son what shall be my end my sweet old mother I couldn't tell her until God tells me see he has to speak I don't do the speaking it's him it's not me that causes the vision here on the platform ask my brethren with me this week I have eat nothing but crackers and milk milk that's true fasting waiting seeing which way the spirit will lead the boys at the door said there's a big smage board down here brother random how I'd love to go to the smage to the smage Borg how we know what a smish borg is they don't call him that no more or maybe not at least not here but that's I used to love to go to The Smokers board but here he was fasting and what was his fast he was just eating crackers and milk and one place he talked about he wasn't eating Pleasant foods and the sign that's Overlook he was seeking the Lord about something so he wasn't eating Pleasant Foods is the way he titled it and so I I believe that if we have these areas in our life that we're trying to move forward with the Lord that and and particularly as we are talking about the orders or the conduct of the church that is that is part of the conduct of the church is that you are praying for that church and you're actually fasting for for the church you're fellowshipping in if there there's an issues things you don't like um don't pout about it pray about it if there's things that you have concerns you like to see more of then bring that to the Lord in prayer good and then fast and pray and take do your part if there's something that you're trying to get from the Lord you want to feel that precious touch from him you have those special moments where the Lord comes down and and just assures you that you're doing the right thing we call those little visitations those are available to the believer and uh you can move away from the things of the world and and and and the things of your eating H eating you know uh patterns and so forth and take a little time and pray you're not just fasting but you're fasting and praying it's it's a blessing it will be a blessing amen he he talks about the men that lay behind the curtain for support and that we cleanse our lives through now I like this one where he talks about how we can um if we've done wrong that we can go before the Lord and fast for the Lord to clean those things out of our life and that's in the message the way of the true Prophet I do believe in the Purgatory but I believe it's right now you purge your own soul Purgatory means to purge when you see you've done when you when you see you've doing something wrong get out there clean it out of You by confession and crying and fasting and praying someone even laughed at me when the Lord came here not long ago give me a vision that I always wanted to see about binding that serpent I always wondered how if I should step out like that when that's what I've wanted all my life then I began to fast and pray and said what did you do that for I said and there he said that I was not sincere enough actually to come down I actually to come down want to purge myself not wait till you die and let some priest try to purge you purge your souls but see they took it out of the authoritative word and put it over in the hands of some man-made Dogma to bring money into the church because they look at worldly things worldly Church Great powers in the world political Powers but God looks to his word amen so when you've done wrong you can clean that out by confession crying fasting and praying now just what would happen if the few people how many people were in here tonight one two 3 4 5 6 7 41 41 someone it so you know um that's Joe's one of his gifts you know I always count flocks of birds if there's 10 or eight or 12 I don't know why if there's a flock of birds going by I always count them and I just want to know how many birds in that flock and so brother Joe counts flocks of Believers so if this 41 people including the little Bitties we count them too right including the little Bitties the old ones if we will all get down on our knees and pray do you believe the Lord will hear that prayer and there's sincerity there and then what if that 41 people or few people they are would fast and pray would that make a difference in just our worship service alone see your worship service isn't your skills or ability to sing it's not just the ability to play an instrument or to pick out a few songs to sing that's part of it that's a good part of it but the real worship service is when he comes down is that right and that's what we want in every service is the anointing to come down the Holy Spirit to come down in the meeting get in our hearts get in our ways our life and all that we are doing and um fasting is part of that it would be just beautiful if you if we would incorporate that in our in our daily walk and taking these scriptures and believing God that he's going to answer the request that we have and for the growth that we need we have our needs we have physical needs we have financial needs we have um spiritual needs right and a church that would pray and fast together what kind of church would that be be oh my say well brother is we need more we need another instrument over here we need more we need more oh we just need the ones the people that we have to get into this Spirit of fasting and praying now let's take um just one example in the scripture is this man corus which happens to be a gentile he's found in Acts chapter 10 I believe let's turn there quickly our fine Italian brother Cornelius verse number one there's a certain man cesaria called Cornelius a centurion of the band called The Italian Man a devout man one that feared God with all his house which gave much arms to to the people and prayed to God always he saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming into him and saying unto him Cornelius and when he looked on him he was afraid and said what is it Lord and he said unto him thy prayers and thy arms have come up for a memorial before God I want you to take note of that look at the just this th this this principle of prayer and being sincere and there's a lot of people and I know some of them personally I was raised up with and they're out I meet people all the time they're very sincere they have the Bible and they pray and God actually answered their prayers somehow we in the message think that prayers being answering those Supernatural things are only to us and many of us don't even have that going on in our churches and I've seen some of these Holiness churches and Pentecostal churches um I mean some of them look cleaner and nicer than some of us in the message and we have the quote unquote message in the Revelation and here's a man he's not in the Covenant with Israel he was not there on the day of Pentecost as far as we know he does not have the the word of of what the Old Testament scripture says about the Lamb of God taking and breaking those things open all he was was devout with this one little portion of his life he gave and he prayed to God always and the angel came to him in a dream and told him your prayers and your arms have come up as a memorial not that I just heard you but there are Memorial now that's the isn't that the God we serve is he Fair like that is he if if if a man or a woman would dedicate their time in prayer and sincerity and honesty to God no matter what church they're going to isn't he the god like that that will hear their prayer huh and we put all these hoops for people to jump through they don't come to my church they're not in me they don't believe this they don't know nothing about this they just you know everybody's like that and that's just not the right attitude God doesn't work that way he's not a respector of persons and notice even when the message comes to him and the Lord tells him to go send for this man Peter even Peter had a problem with going to see this man and Peter was a spokesman on the day of Pentecost says Lord I've never eaten anything common or unclean and Lord I to show him a vision don't call things common or unclean that I have cleansed so the story goes on a little bit take it a little bit further in verse 7 and when the angel which spake unto cornelus was departed he called two of his household servants devout soldiers of them that waited on him continually he declared all these things unto them he sent them to japa on the tomorrow they went on their journey and Drew nigh unto the city Peter went up on the house stopped to pray about the sixth hour and he came very hungry and would have eaten but while they made ready he fell into a trans so we see that the Lord came to Peter and gives him this trance or this vision and so what I want to take is ver verse number 29 27 as he talked with them you know so they get these they get Peter to come over to corus and corus verse 25 and as Peter was coming in corus met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him but Peter took him up saying stand up I myself also am a man and as he talked with him he went in and found many that were come together and he said unto them you know how that it is unlawful thing an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company or come unto one of another Nation but God had showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean therefore I came I unto you without gain saying as soon as I was sent for I asked therefore for what intent ye have sent for me and corneus said four days ago I was what fasting until this hour and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house and behold a man stood Before Me In Bright clothing I mean how many of us would want a visitation like that you're not going to be on a video your video game and get that visitation I don't believe you're not going to be gossiping you're not going to be indulgent in the things of the world I I I believe there's it's it's you know this this visitation came to this man he needed it but look at his life look at the background and we're talking about support and we're talking about our closet and prayer and we're talking about this great command and many of us have made it up in our mind that I'm not going to fast unless the Lord puts fast on me and therefore many of us don't fast at all and when we don't when we don't get something to eat on that regular schedule you I'm starving I got to get something to eat I'm just starving what are they doing that's really starving in them countries and I just want to make that um you know bring that to that's part of our conduct I believe that a church church that is that is praying and fasting and doing that in the background you might not be up here with the mic in your hand you might be a sister or brother who doesn't handle the word like that or you don't have a what you call a position and maybe you don't play any of the instruments or maybe we haven't called on you for maybe you're just in the background but your support can start right here and fasting and praying you can't get sleep at night and you have oppression and depression and problems little issues that just won't seem to let go you've come to church you come to the youth meeting you come to the whatever the Bible study you're here tonight and you've done all these things this is another step you can take set aside a meal pray call on God with these scriptures in mind knowing that God will hear and answer your request how many believe that tonight absolutely he he gave it to us this is he he made it very clear Um this can go out but nothing but fasting in prayer Jesus said that to his disciples why they couldn't cast this devil out of this boy out of this man he wouldn't leave it was stubborn it's something that and then you know so this is this is part of it this is part of it you you know any day of the week anytime you can you can do that and it is a sacrifice you might you might be hungry you might not but that's that's your commitment to him on the command part when you fast not if you fast when you fast wash your face anoint your head with oil don't appear like you're fasting don't go out here and let everybody know I'm fasting you go do that you be you do it in secret and when you fast and the father that seeth in secret will do what openly he'll reward you openly it's a spiritual principle it's part of it and why why why shouldn't we use it I believe we should and I believe we can add that resource of our prayer to fasting amen God bless you God bless you richly we'll take a few prayer requests here tonight that we have Karen zinka is having surgery tomorrow brother Zach uh has turned in a request for his job situation you know he works in the prison there with the criminals and those places spirits and attitudes and all that he doesn't want that those kind of things influences on him just ask God to bless him and anoint him and this job I want to thank
