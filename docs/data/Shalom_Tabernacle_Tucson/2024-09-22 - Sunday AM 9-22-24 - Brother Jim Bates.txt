the glory the precious name of Jesus Christ amen only be only believe all things are possible only believe [Music] only only believe all things are possible only we'll be starting at question number 292 and we're going to finish just before 210 for those that are following this is questions and answers on the seals you may be seated brother Brandon now the Catholic church back there from now the Catholic chur church back there from charging from Mass and so forth holds the wealth of the world you remember the Bible said she was rich and how she was and remember not only just on one nation she's rich on every nation there is under Heaven she reaches out right she has the money now what they don't have Wall Street has which is controlled for the Jews now and you remember he got the money when Jacob returned last night we find out and become Israel he really had the money but his money wouldn't buy nothing see to Esau Esau had it too see both anti and and the one see just perfectly now watch here I said they might want to consolidate together on the money and uh and the Roman power take the Jewish power and uh money breaking the Covenant that might not be so see I know they'll break it but I I don't know what reason because it's not revealed to me about what they'll do but um look now if the day now what if today the only thing that we can do would be to do if we're drawing taxes if that statement is right off of the currency off of the tax money of 40 years from now you see our goal is we've done spanning amen we're broke we don't have any money and we're only living off of a past reputation that's what the church is doing today the church not the bride the church is living off of a past reputation it got back under under the ministry of the lion times we are the church we are the mother church we started uh that's right see is living off of reputation methodists is living off of their reputation Baptists is living off of their reputation and Pentecost are living off of their glory to God long time ago when the saints used to dance in the spirit and how they the Lord done this and that that at something past we all got big now brother oh my see all past reputation this nation is RI living off of a past reputation of what the forefathers was see and that's the reason we think we'll be saved God never respected Israel on what they was what they had been what they was then notice but now here's what I think what I I think will take place now it may not be so I believe the time will come when we're forced to make the issue and when it will be that instead of us uh changing the currency what would that do to the Philip Morris what would that do to the the whiskey companies what would that do to the steel industry what would that do to all the Commerce what would that it would br break them they' be broke but if we can Bor that money see how smart he is then the nation sells out to the church and that church and state is United again there she come to God hallelujah that's it notice all right now in this if one is in a Association AR organization by our government and can speak the um dictates of his own heart or in the last days truth will he be termed as one of the harlots see if one in the association organization is well see the association organization the the organization that's given rights by the government to speak see that don't have anything to do with his heart see now if he is a real believer and born to the spirit of God sometime or other he's going to be checked it can't be so plain and then him not see it now I want you see you want to remember this friend that God God never does it has it any time as I can remember see but what look Jesus was the was the keynote of all of it because he was God Emanuel made flesh now look at this this fellow Jesus when did you know when he come on Earth there wasn't I guess one tenth of the world know he was here you know when that Forerunner come when all the mountains and things that take place there wasn't 100th of the population of Israel I guess ever noticed isn't that strange while there were Jews and things and people all over the world I remember Jesus came to be a witness as a savior of the world is that right while there were just people after people after people after races after people that never even know nothing about it went right on just like the world know nothing about it but all the time that was going on in the world see why didn't he let no he came and the ones that were predestinated the eternal life was the ones that received him there had been no good to say anything to the rest of them because he could not redeemed them because it wasn't even redeemable why was it when those priests stood there when he had to come to that spot because a predestinated was plotted out in there all around so he had to preached to him as a group and the great Scholars that should have know him said this man is be elub we not have this man rule over us and so forth see we not do it but a little old prostitute with a life in her predestinated to eternal life and her name is IM Marly in the word of God here walked up there and the first time that light struck that little sea quickly she know it look at old fisherman come by there here he stood there doing signs and wonders and telling different people the secrets of their hearts and revealing himself and Ma there was Pharisees stand there and said this man is Beba they had to answer to their congregation all I'm stand Dr Jones will you go down and listen to this man he seems like he knows what he's talking about he don't talk like or man I will hear him walk down there see go God can never get to him and there he stood down there and said they said look at there look there there comes a man there there's one of his disciples there comes a man up that's guy's name uh that's Andrew you remember oh you remember the old uh the old fisherman down here that's Sam yeah that that's Simon his brother you see and that's that's old Jonas's kids there they look he he's bringing somebody up to him who is it yeah see what he'll do now he's he's the next up there he walks up and said your name is Simon and you are the son of Jonas this man is be see he's got some kind of spirit on him he's an odd fell see swear don't don't you all listen to nothing like that see keep away from I wouldn't hand any more of these meetings at all see as soon as this thing over we'll get out of here we'll never get away around here again see wow now that's what he thought and yet was supposed to be the one look the very ones that he come to was the ones who crucified him but there's a little prostitute that everybody kicked out I'm not aors in prostitution no indeed but I'm just showing you the predestinated seed look at this guy here this old fisherman put not the Bible said he was unlearned is that right not only that but he was ignorant amen right now is that right or wrong oh we just get ignorant a lot of these things that we think we know all right see he was both ignorant and unlearned and then he walked up there in the presence of the Lord Jesus and he told him he was right then that settled it now what's this other Fell's argument against that well look he believed it look who it is know who that is that man never why why is's a fisherman or he don't know his ABC I bought fish from you couldn't even sign me a receipt that see that's the kind of stuff that's the kind of people that listens to something like that thank the lord well well he don't look at his daddy is ignorant he didn't even send him to school but that's the one he sent to school Tau the way he wanted I'm not supporting not going to school now I hope you understand but there's just the type see what you get in that that's the kind of reason it goes over the top of them and you know what not one I'd say not onethird of all the Jews in the land ever know anything about him coming and and then one one 15 of the one3 listen to him and then one hund of the 1 received it you know how many he had he had 12 standing at the cross out the whole bunch where's the rest of the 70 went away now while he was Healing The Sick and just going down not saying nothing about his Doctrine he just went ahead Healing The Sick and everything oh my that's God's spirit on him you believe that when he was Healing The Sick wonderful that's a great Rabbi say hey Brethren you're in heav your church boy you talk about power that guy can really heal the sick you you got a gift of healing well of course they're going to have some impersonations that here they come along because each group's got to have his own man here he comes and that the first thing you know one day he sat down oh sure Rabbi we'll go with you all right St down let's go all right sent out the 70 and so forth and one day after A great miracle was done he sat down and begin to tell him the word at the beginning of the sounding of the all right he began to tell them the word the truth is ah now wait a minute I don't know about this is contrary to their Doctrine say well I know we left the synagogue and everything like that but maybe we was wrong brother we better go back cuz that man talks in riddles he's kind of an odd fell I can't understand that see why was it the seed wasn't predestinated started then the first thing you know he had a little ministerial group and talked to the ministers they said [Music] a we better go back to and go back and get in the organization take up our papers again see going this guy well who can understand a man like that he says this year says this over here their mothers didn't understand it like that he was Shing riddles to some of them but not to the others so they walked away then he turned around looked at 12 stand there and said you want to go to now watch pet said you know what I tainted that old place out all that time where no where would I go to where would I go where where could I go after I've done a year at work I can't go back to that garbage can again we're all kind of slop of the worlds laying in it where will I go to I I just can't do it he said then all right come on go along there you are see how was that then 12 out of about 2 and a half million and if the savior of the world out of billions get humble see stay humble watch now all that Pharisees and that little prostitute come up there she said save you must be a prophet now we know that messiah's coming when he comes he'll do that he said I'm he she said that's it the waste you want you try to stop her once you couldn't do it brother Brams greetings in the name of the Lord Jesus please explain who the man in Matthew 22:11 the man that didn't have on a wedding garment wedding garment on I know this man could couldn't get into heaven without the wedding garment on this was a guest I know not the bride yes that's right he the yeah he just slipped in see now look now did take a whole sermon on that now I got 10 minutes to pray for the sick and finish this up and I've got one half of done but I'm going to hurry right sure enough back to this one here's what happened if you know the Oriental Customs see when a bridegroom gives out invitations for his wedding he just gives out so many invitations and for every invitation he sent he had a porter standing at the door to put a robe on him whether he was poor or whatever he was he had if he was rich or poor whatever it was he all had to wear this wedding garment when they stood at the door they put this on him they covered up what he's outside of the been he's invited where's the millionaire where's the parper where's a farmer ditch digger whatever he is or or plutocrat he's he's here with the robe on now because the Rob's put on him at the door when he enters in at the door I take St John 10 I believe it is he said I am the door I am the door that enter you enter in by now there he stands at the door and hears the man to put the robe on him the Holy Spirit to give him the robe of righteousness when he comes in now this man had come by some organization back at the window over here some sliping hole and he got in the table and sat down and then when the bridegroom comes out and looks around he he these have been OD ducts before now he's the odd duct what you doing here like that without the baptism of the Holy Ghost and all these things how did you ever get in here well uh he come in somewhere besides the door and he come without the proper invitation see he come by some educational system see or something like that he got in and he said to him bind him hand and feet cast him out of here into outer Darkness where there will be weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth he went into the tribulation period see he did not come in by the door so all right question will the Elijah of Mala four be the same as Elijah mentioned in Revelations 11:3 and is the other Witnesses um as other two witness separate individuals separate yes the Elijah of Malachi 4 will not be the Elijah of Malachi 3 we went through that last night and is the other witness separate two of them yes sir Moses and Elijah to our Revelation now I don't to hold you here too long First Kings 19 brother Brandon I believe that the number who did not bow the knee was yeah that's right 700 thank you that's correctly 700 instead of 7,000 brother 7,000 instead of 700 I see that you know really when a person comes like this to to preach I want to ask you something I SAR shall understand when the Elijah came from the Wilderness he had one message he stomped out of that Wilderness and come right down and told that King that do will not even fall from Heaven till I call for you that's the words he had and St right back out and shut up the nobody when he had another message he come right down and said this message and turn right back around went back out into the Wilderness see now if you watch when I laid the Cornerstone in that Tabernacle he said do the work of an evangelist and now the hour is coming when that work is separated there something else taking place amen amen then I'm so conf see I get here and try to do evangelist and something else and see where you're at see you're all I I'm expecting the church to be spiritual enough to understand Amen brother brother Brandon I understand that El lias must be three times you tell us that he has been twice already and will come again now will the person that the spirit of Elias will be upon also be of the two witnesses of Moses and Eli no no he will be a gentile see to the Gentile church God sends always to his own people see he came to his own his own SE always sends is the message of the hour when God was dealing with the Jews it wasn't any Gentile prophets come when God's dealing with the Gentiles there's no Jewish prophets when God turns back to the Jews there'll be no Gentile prophets see what I mean all right after the Rapture has taken place uh there will be a carryover time of course one message carrying to the other is it has to come right in like this you see as I explain that see like Paul to the Gentiles and so forth all right after the Rapture has been taken place will any of the church be saved in the end who was not uh taken in the Rapture no uhuh because the blood's done left you see there be no intercession the Gentile age is finished there be no one saved at the Rapture of another church uhuh the church let him it's filthy be filthy still him it's holy be holy still that won't take place not after the church is gone brother Brandon I noticed you your referring to Daniel 70 weeks on the first seal message I understand on Daniel on the tape of Daniel when the gospel returns to the Jews the 70 weeks will begin is there a 170 one week seven years left for the Jews are yet is there only one half week one three and a half years left for them only one half week Jesus prophesied the first half week as was predicted only one half week left for him brother B since you didn't pray for the sick during the week will you that's just a request for that brother Brandon will you see me after the that's request would you please explain about Satan being bound a thousand years and being loose for the Battle of Battle of Revelations 28 what relationship does this have with the battle of Army gedon uh as mentioned in the fourth seal will Gog and MOG be gathered from the people of the new Earth well this is a long one and I I just have to hit the spot of it see now the first thing will maybe I can't explain it I'll do my best will you please explain how Satan is bound a thousand years being loosed again for the Battle of Revelations 208 that is not the battle of Armageddon the battle of Armageddon takes place on this side see all right at when the tribulation period is ending now uh what relation does this have with the Battle of go and Magog none one is this thousand years and the other is the end end of the Thousand Years um as mentioned in the fourth seal will go and B go and MOG be gathered from peoples on the new Earth Earth Satan was loosed out of his prison and went

wonderful compliment to me he said I preached a message some time ago and in brother Al's Camp he said it's one of the best he's heard except I should have cut the service off sooner I went a little too long and I normally don't go long the people here to tell you that but just uh he's straight up iron sharpen iron so he he just helped build on that little complex that I have but but uh he we're

praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God is this mic working I don't know there you go sounds like it's working now God bless you all greetings I see a lot of my friends here barve it's been a long time 1991 I first met that man we had some Adventures didn't we and some good friends ever your guitar playing it sounds like it's gotten better it was good then but it's I just that's amazing what a talent my friend for John Martin John Allen I've been on the mission fi with that man he's pretty good maybe I'll tell you a story about that later staying in your lane it's good to see everybody amen you know um Jesse Lynn was our piano player she got prited I went to go talk to Caleb about it but when I looked up I was like you can have her all right pretty big man yeah and I I think you know I appreciate being about here brother as a friend and I think that's what it is with friends though you can be honest with each other you can just be authentic you don't have to put on no pretenses it was the best outside of probably brother BR I ever been involved in that meeting he uh about 35 40 minutes in he brought the presence so strong that everybody was on their feet the Holy Spirit was moving could hardly even hear him for a while and then he finished his notes and so I just told him I said that's the best I ever heard but you should have probably let go when he came that's all we want you know I'm just a sinner saved by grace I you know when you have a message Vindicated by God to stand here behind this and speak to God's is the most sacred thing you know you don't even unless you've been behind here you don't know one word misrepresented misconstrued we don't want that so we're going to go before the Lord we're going to read a scripture and go before the Lord in prayer and ask him to guard us that we just would say exactly what his Vindicated Prophet said so let's read in Ephesians too very familiar scripture I had all these notes brother Dave I had these notes all planned out for I was going to preach on little mysteries about the coming of the Lord but this morning early God changed my whole entire thought there might just be for somebody here you never know and God just that's what I love about God don't you he would move everything for one person that's crying out for him so let's go to Ephesians chapter 2 and we'll read a scripture that most of us should probably be able to quote but this is um I love this whole entire chapter 2 God pre you know brother BR preached God rich in Mercy text out of here but let's go to verse eight and we'll read uh through 10 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is a gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus un good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them let's just go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father standing here Lord in your presence and before your people I Feel So Unworthy we just would ask that you would come father and through the foolishness of preaching that you would just make yourself known to us that was the way you chose to do it we are here gathered together to honor your Resurrection we're here as Believers of this end time message Lord by your grace we ask you just open the scripture to us make it live we'll be sure to give you all the glory we just want you to be lifted up father that all men might be drawn to you we love you we commit it to you in Jesus name amen please be seated this scripture to me um I I don't know when God was kind of speaking to me this morning when I was praying for service this idea of Law and Grace you know it took the Jews a bit Paul spent a lot of time in the New Testament separating law From Grace because in the Old Testament they had to live a law they you know it was Thou shalt Thou shalt not and they tried to to to work their way there you know brother Bram talked about the church took law for Grace um you know they had God gave them Grace but they they chose law and he said it was a school master that showed us that we couldn't do it we needed Grace and I want know so how many in here are Christians all right so when you say you're a Christian that means you're Christlike that's what the word means that means you've had a new birth brother brandham in the church age book he um made a little bit even stronger than that I'll read it to you out of the resume I don't have this one in my notes so I think some of the quotes they'll be able to pull up but in the resume brother Ram's talking about the elect and he says Christ the bride but but it speaks to the entire body of people who are called Christians whether they be true or merely nominal so there's two types of Christians those that are true and those that just say they're Christians all Israel is not Israel so all Christians are not Christians thus we learn that the church is made up of two Vines the true and the false the two Vines are motivated by two kinds of spirits one has the Holy Spirit while the other is ued with the spirit of antichrist both claim to known be known of God God both purport to speak for God both believe certain very basic truths and differ on others but since both bear the name of the Lord being called Christians and by such name bearing obviously claiming a relationship to him God calls it marriage God now holds them both responsible to him and therefore speaks to each so in this church age book how many like this book I I had a friend of mine get mine leatherbound it's an old blue was beat up and duct tape him he said can I borrow a church I said absolutely not you can't borrow my church age book it was Gabe Dutton we were at some meetings and uh he finally said I want to do something nice for you I said okay you can have my church H Book for a couple weeks but it came back like this what a blessing but I like this book you know and here he's talking to the church he shows how Satan came into the church made it lukewarm formal and Powerless but he also shows how God was in the church through the entire seven Church ages and he's speaking to these two and by Christ when we say you're a Christian God calls it marriage so now you have this responsibility when you say you're a Christian because you're saying you're God's wife right and so that's a pretty heavy responsibility that we have and I I like this in Ephesians because you know we didn't we didn't get this what we have this Christianity by works that we did or anything we could do to earn it it was simply by Grace now if you are a Christian though it it says in Ephesians that you will do good works but the works didn't save you see by being this by Grace you're saved God by Grace by a gift he saved you completely without Merit unmar favor and and that salvation he says now we are his workmanship created unto good works so if you are a Christian you will do good works they don't save you but that's that's what you're going to be let's read a scripture in Galatians 3 I just want to kind of lay this out now this like I said the Lord changed my thought this morning and I normally I have my notes done and I'm back there just waiting on the Lord but I was scurrying to write the notes brother Israel will tell you right till the last minute but I I I just just pray for me pray that the Lord will because I believe this is for somebody so Galatians the 3r chapter let's look there Galatians chapter 3 we'll just start reading at the first verse he's talking to the Galatians there here's the New Testament now they're supposed to be in The Testament of Grace the Covenant of Grace oh foolish Galatians who have Bewitched you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ had been evidently set forth crucified among you this only what I learn of you receive you the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith how does you get this Christianity how did you get this life that God gave you was it by the hearing of Faith one day you heard a voice and something you said hallu you that's nothing but the truth something in you quickened or was it by something you did well you know we bless God we're message Believers and you know we we go to this church and we do this and we do these things and we dress like this and we do that therefore no no no no no no no that's not what did it we a little further there are you so foolish having begun in the spirit are you now made perfect by the flesh let's let's go back to our our salvation for a minute to that Grace because I think sometimes what happens is we kind of start to think well I'm you know I got cleaned up pretty good I you but that see that's a result of Grace have you suffered so many things in vain if yet if be yet in vain he he therefore that minth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you does he do it by The Works of the law or by the hearing of faith brother Israel ministering to you does he do that by the law or is that by the spirit those of you who have a Ministry and all of you should oh yeah you sisters too you moms brother Brown said Matthew Mark Luke John and mother five gospels how many have heard that quote he said every mother has a congregation it's true you have a Ministry it's not by the law I was saying that yesterday at the prayer breakfast I think sometimes we do a disservice in the message and I think it's is part of the journey you think the story of Ruth Ruth had four stages Ruth deciding Ruth laboring Ruth resting and Ruth rewarded and brother Ram said laboring was Ruth working through legalism to get the rest he said every Christian has to do that so us parents we get saved in this message and we see this beautiful perfect word and then we try to make our kids live a life that we couldn't live without the Holy Ghost can't do it now in my home there was rules and I just told my kids I said I can't give you what I got I don't want you to be a second generation Jim Bates I want you to go get an experience like I did and have a relationship with him I want to get you into a presence where you can find Grace but while you're in my home there's going to be rules you go to school there's rules you drive a car there's rules you get a job there's rules you're going to have to understand there's rules someone determines right and wrong and I believe that's God everybody else has their own sense of morality but there couldn't be that conversation unless there was the you know just like gravity it's a law of God we can call it whatever we want we discovered it but it was already there same with morality it's not now this world doesn't have a clue which ones they don't even know what side of the house they belong on see and so it's not anything that we do that earns anything for us and I think that we have to keep our focus on this grace that brought it to us and when we raise our children you need to make sure that they understand right and wrong and there's rules but don't try to legislate this message on them and make you know we Club them so hard sometimes legally that they just push away we don't we don't want that they want Grace like we needed Grace I'm not trying to preach at your parents I'm just I raised seven they're all married I got 18 grandkids so if it wasn't for the Holy Ghost and my wife probably wouldn't have been that good I tried to be a good mom I wasn't a very good mom God knows what he's doing he knows how to put it together he goes on here and he says even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness how many in here believed you heard it and something you said that's the TR and I believe that right then he counted it to you for righteousness oh yeah now he's going to take you through the Journey he's going to mold you you're going to you're going to start to do these things we're going to talk a little bit about that takes action he didn't just save you now you sit there like okay no I'm perfect no there's there's some things we have to do there's some action that goes with it so he he justified Abraham because he believed him now we're gonna this is where I'm going to get my title of the message out of out of the church age book a quote here on the end of the Samarian Church age 157 I think it's probably the third quote in that stack where it says if you are a Christian he says he the ha in the year let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches of each age in every age it was the same cry hear what the spirit says if you are a Christian you will get back to what the spirit is teaching so that's what I want to title this today is if you are you will not if you do you you are but if you are you will brother Israel are you a piano player so you you don't do the works of a piano player but your wife is a piano player sister Sharon if you are a piano player you'll play the piano right if you are a guitar player you will manifest that you are a guitar player so the the statement here is if you are you will if you were an eagle you'll Fly Like an Eagle and you'll live up there high and you'll see a far off and if you are Eagle you'll do what Eagles do if you are a Christian you will act like a Christian because you know that's what that's what Ephesians is telling us here what Paul was speaking to the Ephesians he said by Grace you're saved not of works but if you're saved you will do good works see if you are you will now let's pull up that uh that first quote there if you have it I'm going to read that one a little bit later but the first one there out of questions the answer number three when you're born as a human when you're born as a human the natural traits of a human being will follow you you won't live in a tree try to fly with your wings like a bird or something like that that isn't that that wouldn't be a normal human the normal actions of a human being the normal action of a human being would be to work have many have family do these things that's natural normal human beings because you're born that see you're born that then when you're born a Christian born of the spirit of God you naturally take up the attributes of Christ see when you're born a Christian it takes a birth then you will act like a Christian if Christ dwell in you then you will do the works of Christ brother BR said if Beethoven was in me I would write music if John Dillinger was in me I'd be a bad guy see and so when you receive Grace he gives you himself The Works that I do I don't do anymore it's not me anymore that does it I don't do by the I Do by the spirit of God yet I live but Christ lives in me it's not I that's living so now I'm going to die to that old person that tried to do all those things to get acceptance and I'm just going to accept by faith God's grace and then he comes and dwells the Holy Spirit and he starts to take over this vessel all right let's go to that one in the thot tyan CH Church age their Works testified to a new spirit within see your works are a testimony that there's something happened not the other way around men saw their good works and glorified God yes sir if you are a Christian you're going to do what is right you will do the right thing if you're a Christian does that mean you won't make mistak no you'll make mistakes but what does a Christian do when he makes a mistake or she Lord I'm sorry the Zeal of this age is what repent so if that was a Zeal of latest and age then that means we got some repenting to probably do oh here it comes I love it when it starts to come so in Proverbs there's a scripture that says a righteous man fall us seven times and gets back up but a sinner Falls to predition can't get back up you fall get back up don't stay down there I if you are a Christian you'll get back up don't let the devil keep you down there that's his job trying to make you doubt he's trying to make you doubt that Grace that you had he's trying to make you question you know I I struggle like all of you with complexes brother I got my own how many in here have had complexes or have one now brother Bram said we do brother Bram had complexes we go to school and we feel like everyone's picking on us and we're somehow awkward and odd I used to think man everyone knows some big secret about me and I'm the only one and they didn't tell me what it was and why is everyone you know I always thought I was the Oddball somehow and I am an oddball God just had to show me later what that meant right but it's true if if you are you will you will do these things because it's in you to do them but you know those complexes come on us and I think sometimes God just keeps us in a spot where we have to realize back to Grace again perfect strength and perfect weakness brother Brown said that if uh you know if uh if you have this complex and you feel like you can't do it he says then that's finally where God can use you but he said if you have a mindset like that he can't it's like a paradox he has to get you down there so you can stay humble so he can use you but he says you have to start to get confidence not in yourself but this word where you can stand there and say it's not me you know I was just sharing with brother Poe you know I used to be really awkward about saying that brother Billy Paul was my friend because I just felt like he's friends with everybody I'm not special but he called me a special friend and he did and I had a dream I'll just share that with you real quick I had a dream when I was in this house with a bunch of brothers and there was one of those old phones on the wall the old and it started ringing and someone answered and said it's for your brother baits and I picked it up and his brother BR he goes what are you doing I said well I'm just hanging out here with the brothers he goes you get ready I'm gonna pick you up I'm like oh man you know I'm in trouble or he's going to give me some big Revelation this car pulls up and the back door opens and brother bram's sitting in there and I get in there with him and someone's driving we went driving around went to the mall we went over here had some food end of the day he drops me back off I wake up and I'm like what was that no big Revelation no scolding which I probably had coming and then I just thought this is me I'm awake now after the dream I'm like what would it be just to be the friend of a prophet where he just wants to hang out with you for a day and so I told David brand him that you know David and I are buddies and I told David that story and he goes brother Bates you can't even accept my dad as your friend how in the world are you going to accept brother Bram as your friend you know cuz I just felt like I'm not worthy to be brother Billy's friend and he says that and I've done some things and I was used to be embarrassed because I think if people thought I was talking about brother Billy and my friendship that I was trying to endorse myself or something but he told me I was his friend and he red me to his house for dinner and did all these things with me and I just thought that everyone got that privilege a lot of people did I'm not the only one but I started thinking about what Brother David told me and about two weeks later I was laying in bed and the Lord woke me up and just said if you can't accept the son of my prophet's friendship or my prophets what about mine you don't deserve my pardon but I gave it to you freely it's a gift I gave you you don't deserve it stop Walling around and accept it we sit there and we say well I'm not worthy so the complex that I had was this message is right and you couldn't tell me it was wrong Dil was too late for that but he come to me and said I wasn't worthy to be part of it I'm not good enough to be I wasn't good enough to be part of it it's Grace it's a gift God wants you to know it has nothing to do with anything you do or try to do he by Grace he saves you unmar favor and he wants you to have confidence in that not your works or what you do or well you know they didn't understand God's love it says in the church age book get about page 116 117 you read about that he said they they thought God's love meant Oh that sunny skies was God was happy with me and stormy skies is he's not happy he says no had nothing to do with that God just chose you by election God's love is elective and because he chose to love you it's enough if you got to go and get your head lobed off like John the Baptist if you got to get hung upside down like Peter it doesn't matter because he loves you you're part of you're part of his body he bought you with a price you're not your own and if by Grace he chose you then whatever lot you have in life whatever trial you have to go through Just Praise the Lord he didn't say he was going to take away the scary he's like a parent sister Robin did you ever tell your kids that were scared of the dark hey I'm going to turn off the light it's going to get dark in here but don't be afraid because I'm just right here that's what brother BR said in the church H book he says like a mother with parental care saying fear not he said every time something scary was fixing to happen God said fear not don't be Afra afid cuz I'm with you even in you to the end I'm not going to take away the scary I'm not going to take away the dark it's going to get so dark you can't see your hand in front of your face but don't fear little sister there's a man here that can turn on the light he said we're not going to go through the tribulation but we'll go right up to it it's going to get dark the squeez is going to get tighter but don't worry because by Grace God said so we have something we can rest in all right so see he says your Works will show that your heart is right and it won't be something you put on for you will do his will when no one but God sees you that's Integrity the definition of integrity is you act that way when no one's watching right John Allen I mean that's Integrity you this is how you are when no one's watching but God because that's who you are not what you try to pretend to be we were talking last night about putting in peacock feathers sometimes we try to pattern oursel after somebody I I used to say Lord why' you call me to speak I'm not worthy I don't feel qualified I don't feel any of that stuff so then I see some preacher like John's dad and I was like I can't preach like that he goes I didn't call you to preach like that you just go up there and share my love to the people and let me do the rest get out the way get out my way and let me do the work has nothing to do with you I chose you by Grace I have something for you to do just get out of my way and let me do it that's it so it's something you do when no one when when no one that God sees you you'll do his will even if it cost you your life how many feel that way this is not a pretend we're not playing church I've received Grace I'll I'll give my life for this true story you know can I just say things in this church could I just be at home there's so much controversy going on right now trying to separate the bride tapes this don't tapes that that's the devil you can't separate God in this message but they try to do it everybody should be a tape Church tapes are my life they are my life what the tape say we're going to read a few quotes and so if you are you will if you are a Christian you will do it Christ said to do not because you're trying to work your way I don't come to church because I'm trying to earn something but he said if the love of God was in your heart you couldn't wait for those doors to open fellowship with your brothers and sisters we should do that you know but then I have people come to me and they start trying to blast Brother Joseph and I said you know what you stop right there I'm not taking anything against my brother I spend time with him I know his heart i' take a bullet for that man I don't understand everything he's doing but I don't have to God didn't call me to do that you just let God take care of it you think anything's out of God's control he knows everything that's going on everything's for a purpose it's all working for his good just relax and rest in this message don't wrestle and fight we got Grace here all right so this church age Book quote 157 he says every Messenger to every age will preach that word every fresh and true Revival will be because men have gotten back to that word for their age The Cry of every age is to rebuke you have left the word of God repent come back to the word right from the first book in the Bible Genesis to the last book Revelations there's only one reason for God's displeasure okay if we could just take that one thing today well God's displeased with me for this and that and there's 100 no there's only one reason from the entire book of Genesis to Revelations that God's displeased with you believe in the word when we when we we're fortified behind the word of God a parent puts us there he walls us all in the only way for the devil to get to you is if you go out he can't get in there where you're at so we all do that we get enticed to go out from behind the word and that's the only reason for God's dis pleasure there's only one reason leaving the word and there's only one remedy to regain his favor back to the word so our life as a Christian is by Grace I'm saved there's nothing I can do to Merit it but when I get myself in trouble is when I've left the word I've left Grace there's only one way to gain his favor back and that's go back to the word how many want his favor Enoch found favor with God he found his favor because he stay in that word you see where we have to live if you are a Christian you will he goes on down here about the Ephesian age but look at that last second to last paragraph if you are true seed if you are truly baptized with the Holy Ghost you will esteem his word above your necessary meat and you're to live by every word brother Caleb we just had that conversation that proceeds out of the mouth of God so you will yearn for that if you are a Christian your life will be this word it's like you know I'm staying right here some shiny preacher will come along that's why you don't even I don't want you to get to Jim bat's revelation I don't want to point you to me if I do that run there's only one thing that's been Vindicated and that's this Vindicated word and I all I want to see is a relationship with you and that that's it so if I get in the way somehow and you see me pointing someone way don't trust this guy right here I'm telling you it's honest to God truth God knows my heart strike me dead right here my whole heart being up here is to get enough out of the way where all I can do is encourage you to stay with this word not I think about it not what I tell you about it but what it says I'm telling you it's honest God truth you know there's two Spirits within this framework we read that quote and brother BR said in the beginning of it if we can learn to this withstand that Antichrist Spirit we'll be a Invincible Army how many sees that right so there's two Spirits you watch this is just now your brother talking to you my observation is that Antichrist spirit always points you to something else besides Jesus Christ it points you to us our movement our group what we're doing myself my Ministry forget all that nonsense it's not about any of that brother brother Israel asked me to he says well what what do you want to I said brother Israel I'm here subjecting myself to the the local authority of this church I subject my gift to the pastor of this church I said if you just have me sit there I'll sit there it's not about gym baits I don't want I don't have an agenda the agenda is is his word it's it's his spirit it's his life that's the agenda then he says well now you've done that you're going to preach both I'm like there you go backfires right but I'm serious when you want when you're sincerely say Lord I don't care what happens I just want your will then be willed to accept it good or bad if that means you got to preach them both right see and that's the thing about it is if you are you will esteem this word more than your necessary meat every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God Caleb and I just had some fellowship yesterday around that love that brother he was saying some good stuff to me he was encouraging me I don't I'm I'm a fast talker he kind of Heats more slow he likes to process things and I was kind of like just fire hosing out there he's like whoa whoa slow down brother bass let me just catch up here a little bit you're just like you all these quotes start coming in scriptures and all that and he's just sitting there like okay we're just slow this thing down and I have to do that my personality I have to start thinking in my head really super intentionally let silence do the heavy lifting Jim Bates let silence do the heavy lifting it's hard because sometimes silence is a what's needed space let it breathe you know all right so we've got this established now if you are you you will but let's now there's one more quote out there per in church age it says in uh chapter you know five there if you are truly filled with the spirit you will have the evidence of the word in your life if you are truly filled with the Holy Spirit and a Christian you will have the evidence of the the word in your life said if you had the token people would know coming there going they could tell oh yeah that brother Israel has the evidence of the word in his life I see my brother here there's evidence of the word in your life why because you the eyes are the windows of the Soul it shines out Something's Happened in here the struggle here the battle's here but down here it's all over it's settled I have an anchor I just love that don't you brother brandham you know when he had that big crisis he lost his wife and his baby Sharon Rose and she's died and now brother Billy Paul and and the Devil comes up on his shoulder said you call him a good God all you do is serve him you're out there every night praying for people doing all these things your daddy died your wife died your baby dying and brother Bram said everything he was telling me was right reasoning and did you you remember the good life story brother BR said well then I thought if that's the way he's going to be then I won't serve him he said but right then something on the inside kicked in and said where'd you get that life where'd you get that baby where'd you get that though he slay me yet I'll trust him that inside man that's what we're talking about the Battle rages here we battle with doubts and emotions and conscience and reasoning and all those things here but if you are a christianah here is settled they can't Bo it out of you if they can't get it out of you you'd die for this message yeah you can't trust your brain sis we can't trust your brain it's good to see you my friend it's been a long time but you you can trust God and I can trust God by Grace I know he saved me he he counted it for righteousness when I believed him it's settled already we're going to read a few things to encourage you now if you are a Christian that means you were the only way you could be a Christian is if you were in God's mind before there was world we know the eagle story let's read some quotes to encourage you about that modern events made clear by prophecy if you are a son of God or a daughter of God you were in God all the time Hallelujah now you can just punch the devil with that one guess what devil I am because I was I am a Christian because I was in God's mind I am an eagle because I was an eagle to begin with Hallelujah but he knew what bed and time that you be planted so now made a creature a Son of God manifest a son or daughter of God to meet the challenge of this hour to vindicate the true and living God of this hour the message is coming forth for this time that's right you were done but there before the foundation of the world he knew exactly that you would be here we look back at all those Bible stories and I used to love all those bibl I still do but they're looking at us you lived in Helo deia oh yeah we were burned up and lions and all that but you guys had to go through all this pressure this craziness this every day now just like a barrage how in the world could you stay sane the only way you can do is have an anchor there is no way in your mental faculties you can stay sane in this kind of a world it's nuts and brother Brown propes it' be this way I love this he chose you for this hour you are a Christian today for this hour you will be the message of this hour you'll reflect it that's right you were down there before the foundation of the world it wasn't if you want to choose that no matter how much you try to impersonate it you'll never make it how could you get blood from a turnup and there's no blood there thank God there was something here what brown said in church a book proba 154 somewhere in there and nonseed there's nothing to Quicken he said you you could be reborn because you were seed if you are you were he planted a seed you received it there was for ordained ground to receed the seed word for this hour be thankful that something quickened in you well I don't know brother Bates I don't know well did you did you hear the word now if you're raised in the message you've heard the message all your life but one day God will speak to you and that voice will it'll be different to you you young people are raising this message you've heard it all your life but you still need to be saved you need to hear it different one day my sheep hear my voice and another they won't follow let's go into the Rapture now in the beginning way back way years before there was a time began you if you are a born again Christian T night you were God then your father you were in God you were in the word then you were in God that's why when you come in this life here profess Christianity well everything going wrong you've wondered why this and all this and you wondered at that but one day something struck you what was it that life that was down in there from the beginning oh yeah we still have this Reasoner the greatest battle ever thought's going to be right here but there's an anchor I know how many can say I know my redeemer liveth I know something happened on the inside hey before we end this today I'm goingon to give you a recipe to make sure I'm going to give you a recipe written by a prophet a recipe that if you follow it you'll get these results now I can't make you be seed or not seed but if you could take God out his word and follow recipe then he's obligated stop wondering if you're in or out start acting like you are we're going to get that just to give me a second Philadelphia and church AG now I believe in Good Conduct if you are saved you will do righteously we've been through that but let me tell you now salvation is not Jesus plus anything it's Jesus alone I think the message has lost this concept in a in a bigger broader sense I was telling yesterday about David braham's testimony the prophet's grandson had a medical record that thick couldn't figure out what's wrong with him so they sent him over to or Roberts Medical you know that brother brother Roberts told any family of brother Brams welcome over here no bill just send him over this doctor sitting there looking through all his stacks of paper and David sitting there young man he goes you know what your problem is son he says you need to get saved he led the prophet's Grand un to the Lord right there in his office and now if you talk to that man this message is everything to him but he had to get saved oh yeah we're not going to go dice words over we know that Jesus Christ is this message but he's a person he's alive he's a being he's he's somebody wants to meet you and have a relationship with you it can't just be an intellectual approach it's got to be something you just know it could start out with a child now I hear now I lay me down the sleep that man in the military that was dying that chaplain said go back where you left him he's there waiting for you and he went all the way back to now I lay me down to sleep you know God's right there waiting for you to meet you at your level you don't have to know all the Mysteries he is the mystery and he'll reveal it to you but you got to come to him it's Jesus alone it's not Jesus plus anything it's not Jesus plus your good works it's salvation of the Lord from start to finish let his life be in me let it be his blood that cleanses me let it be his spirit that fills me let it be his word in my heart and mouth let it be his stripes that heal me Let It Be Jesus and Jesus alone not by works of righteous which I have done no sir Christ is my life it's not because of how much I know the message 1 Corinthians 13 I can have all the Mysteries all Faith to move mountains have all the gifts speaking tongues do all those things but if I don't have love I am nothing Lord will maybe tonight I'll share a little my testimony about love and what it did to me land's Book of Life Now believer you've got your joy shoes on you ready you got that quote L's Book of Life listen to this one have you got your joy shoes on listen to this if you are a Christian if you truly are a God child the Bible said Oh that's oh preacher that Bible says your name was written on the last's book of life before the foundation of the world the same time that Christ that God said Christ would be slain he wrote your name there Hallelujah so when he died on the cross you were there you were in him then my name is there this this get written there one day at a chch church service it was already there that's why I could have the church service accept him I actually got it in the truck cab of my little truck I wasn't at church I think God knew how I had to get it I played in a rock band had big hair I'll tell you my testimony a little bit tonight we'll see you guys yeah I don't have any hair now but I had big hair played in the rock band played a base but not as good as our brother I don't think rock band all you got to do is four chords and play him fast and hard well it was the leag guitar player of that band that handed me my first tape there is a man here can turn on the light and I played that tape with my truck for three days I'm not going to share my testimony now but it changed me all those things went away I didn't have to quit nothing I found what I was looking for questions and answers number one if you're filled with the Holy Ghost this morning and God's power is moving in every fiber of your body what God would it do for you to stand in the Judgment you're already judged stop worrying about judgment you got a perfect sacrifice it's already been judged it's been received and filled and already translated in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus so now if you are you are you're are you were there that's where you are now you're seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus if we can get this I'm going to give you this recipe then we're going to be done but I want to give you a couple of these quotes just to hammer this down see not you will be you are now translated well someday I'll be translated not no you are now the token remember he said you could be just as satisfied with that as you could the price that it paid for we should have our joy shoes on shouting that God gave us a token my price is paid I'm already there I makes me think of that story about swick you know when the bear and the caribou and that whole thing and and he has that and and Bud's still kind of like well brother Bram you know that doesn't look like 42 inch rack to me that looks like 102 and he's a a guide and he has a rifle I mean there must have been something that Happ that's just me but I believe something happened to that rat supernaturally because the vision said it was 42 and Bud's going brother Bram he said they were trading off packing the head and it was dragging the ground the antlers were dragging the ground so this looking with his eyes but the word said 42 I don't care what my eyes say I don't care what the circumstances say the word said and he said after he got the Caribou now he's doubting about the rack and then he's about the bear and then they get the bear this is what he said he said brother Braham if how many of us put an if in there if when we get back to Camp those antlers are 42 I'm going to have a run and fit brother man says you might as well have it now if there's going to be if there's G if if if these quotes are true people wrestle with these quotes they fuss with these quotes they make this out of the quotes but they're my quotes those are my grapes in the promise I don't care how many Camp wall cities and Giants there are if he said oh ride this Trail again he meant what he said and I don't have to understand it or believe it or figure it out I just believe it I mean I have to believe it that's it I receive it I'm a receiver not a Reasoner but a receiver right if God said it that's your anchor that's your rest you you said you were a Christian Christians believe the word he might make it sound like I can't see how that's going to be don't worry just say what the word said God will take care of the rest of it he said you might as well have a run and fit now because they're going to be 42 and they are to this day 42 it's a miracle because they usually shrink you've seen that rack R day we were there together saw that tape stretched out there still to this day 42 exactly because God said so it will rain how do you know Moses because God said so Noah how do you know no Daddy you sure it's yeah God said so don't worry about this what everyone's saying about the word of God don't let them explain it away from you and don't let them explain it to you he doesn't need an interpreter he's his own interpreter we just rest in it we don't have to worry about it we just rest in this word CU if you are a Christian you will believe itall you won't falter you won't let them do this that or the other thing it's not my job to figure all that out it's my job to believe it if he comes to me later and says okay this is this is the interpretation of that I'll accept it but he didn't ask me to do anything but believe it can you imagine Mary how many young ladies in here haven't been married before any young ladies in here never been married can you imagine can you imagine Mary an angel comes a messenger a messenger comes through with a message impossible to believe you're gonna have a baby and she asked the how can that be question like we all would and he told her and she says okay let it be according to your word she didn't have to go do anything if you are a Believer will it started showing that she believed it she had evidence that she believed it and she couldn't hide it Hallelujah huah I love that Mary's belief she believed that she received the word and it started proving out that she P because look you can't hide that she can't hide that the word's in you it'll start to show take an impossible message and just accept it believe it watch what God will do man Allelujah I felt like I could preach almost about now and I a even a preacher that's the truth those he called he's Justified those he's Justified he's glorified every redeemed person in the world this morning that's under the blood of Jesus Christ filled with the Holy Ghost ha everlasting life and can't perish it's already in heaven Hallelujah can we accept that today can we believe that I've already passed it okay I don't care about tomorrow I'm going to make a mistake or that he he's already put me there because I've accepted his sacrifice it's perfect there's no fault in it man I'm telling you it's the truth Christ Jesus shall never come into condation already redeemed isn't that wonderful see already redeemed sitting in heaven places now with Christ glorified let's see here let's go to that one of Lord show us the father then we're going to get into a recipe we're going to close but look at Lord show us the father and it suffices us this is what the Christian Life should be what do you have to do with the tree you take the tree you plant the tree in the ground and then you have to water it and as you water it it doesn't do nothing but drink drink drink it has to drink more than its portion and it more it drinks the bigger it swells up it just pushes out limbs it pushes out leaves it pushes out blossoms pushes out apples is that right that's the way a Christian is if you are a Christian you'll drink drink drink get into the tapes get that unbelief baked out of you that's what he said lay in the presence of the sun we have a perfect message preacher telling us we got to go beyond brother Bram nonsense he said on tape Christ revealed his own word there'll be no further advancement than what's going on right now it's time to put the stabiliz on the ship the great fearful ways are coming see the Revival is over son that's what he said go look it up no more Great Big Revival sweeping revivals the bride has one right here I am the Revival it's true drink drink drink it pushes out Lambs pushes out blossoms it pushes out apples is that right that's the way Christians we're planted together in Christ Jesus who is the an exhaustible Fountain of Life we're planted in Christ and we just drink and drink and drink and push out and everything we have need of everything we have need of brother Israel you said that everything we have need of for this journey is in us now if you are a Christian you have this listen what he says you received the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you're planted in Christ hallah the Holy Ghost baptism yes sir everything you have need of for life's journey even the Rapture is in you right then wait wait wait wait listen what he says next did you don't resent that don't push back on that the Rapture is in you right now the prophet said so that's the truth the Rapture is in us now I will prove it by the gospel those who he has called he justified those who has Justified he's glorified Hallelujah then in heaven today we're are glorified in the presence of God right now this promise of the Rapture I've accepted it's right here just drink drink drink lay in the presence of the son get all that unbelief baked out of you don't stop listening to all these preachers including me if I'm steering in the wrong way I'm honest to God telling you the truth too many preachers out there trying to point you to something else it's Jesus and Jesus alone it's not Jesus plus anything Hallelujah Divine Healing the power of God all the other things in every individual in here that's receed the B of the Holy Ghost for you're planted in Christ I you the Holy Ghost baptism I love that don't represent it resent that the the Rapture is in you that in heaven today we're glorified the presence of God right now I'm just pushing out to it amen God's God's in his word you believe it got to hurry now see there you have it it's in you you might as well start jumping right now it's 42 inches have your Revival right now the Rapture is coming and it's in you the shout went forth how many received the shout that's the first part of the Rapture the Lord himself will ascend from heaven with a shout a voice and a trump if you receive the shout the rapture's in you we're just waiting in the presence of his son for his time the iniquity of the amorites isn't full yet don't worry it'll happen when it's supposed to happen don't try to push it do anything else just drink drink drink all right here's the recipe we're going to end here how am I doing on time brother am I good all right I've got like four quotes here to show you that the recipe is not just one but I'll I'll lead you I'll start with the first one principles of Divine Healing starting a prayer line he says now the only thing a minister could do to we preach to salvation in in the cross he couldn't save you there's no preacher tell you he could save you he asked you to accept what Jesus has already done I'm up here telling you to accept what Jesus's already done I can't do anything for you it's already done this is what he says here how many of you are pastors do that raise at your hand sure you accept Christ now he can't he can he can preach but he can't save but he points you to Calvary you accept it then when you come up and say now I take Jesus as my personal savior you believe in your heart that you are saved now the Critics on the outside say oh John there's no difference in you you look the same as you always but you might look the same you might not feel any different but in your heart you believe you're different now listen to this here's the recipe you ready for this I want you to get this recipe and follow this see then you confess that you're different he that will confess me before men I'll confess him before my father and the Holy Angels now if you believe you're better you say you're better you act like you're better you say yes sir I'm saved you associate with those that are saved you believe you're saved you act like you're saved and it works righteousness that's the recipe I believe in my heart I'm saved I'm gonna start confessing I'm saved I'm gonna start acting like I'm saved I'm gonna start hanging around people that are saved it works righteousness oh yeah you want to see let's go to the next one Ministry explained I want to show you that he said this more than once he says when you accept it you believe it somebody says let's see if you look any different you still got brown eyes you're still just the same as you were can't show nothing that you're saved only you're testifying of the Unseen your face has your saved what do you do you believe you're saved then you say you're saved then you act like you're saved you associate with those that are saved and it works righteousness is that right after a while everybody knows you're saved you're in the battle Satan's battling trying to tell you you're not saved he's trying to tell you you only thought you got saved but you believe that in your heart you're saved now just follow the rest of the recipe do what he said how many could do that say you're saved say it out loud I'm saved now start acting like it and associate with those that are saved and it will work righteousness to you the prophet said so let's look at one more whatever he says you to do you do it that's in 1953 he says now before you could be saved I hear many times say oh it hit me in the face like a Russian Mighty Wind well that might be right but that wasn't why you were saved I was in a meting man I felt the presence of God that's not why you're saved you were saved because you believed see how simple this message is only believe no matter what other experience went with it first thing you had to believe and if you didn't feel anything Jesus never asked you if you if you felt it this is my feeling well I don't know if I feel like I'm I don't know if I feel like I got healed I don't know if I feel like I got saved stop acting like that that's negative you start confessing what the word said it's 42 I don't care what my eyes tell I don't care how I feel he didn't ask if you felt it he said ' Do you believe it he says' you doubt that but but goes no brother Bram I just don't understand he goes neither do I understand but I don't have to the vision said just say what he said you see how simple this recipe is why did God change my thought this morning I don't know but somebody in here is struggling with their salvation and he wants you to know it's not that hard by Grace you're saved through faith that you believe the word of God let him take care of putting the works in you drink drink drink and you'll start pushing out you'll act like a Christian you'll say you're saved you'll act like you're saved you'll associate with those that are saved it will work righteousness to you but that wasn't why you're saved you're saved because you believe no matter what other experience went with it first thing you had to believe if you didn't feel anything Jus never ask people they filled it it's it's isn't by filling it's by faith so you believe it and you just get up from there and something in your heart tells you you're saved you go out and you tell people I'm saved you confess you're saved you believe you're saved you act like you're saved it works salvation and after while the whole world knows knows that you're saved because you believe you're saved but the moment you think you're not saved and quit testifying of being saved you go right back down the same rout why he can't work to do nothing for you because he's the high priest of your confession don't let the devil trick you into confessing that well I don't know if I'm saved anymore I did this and I did that nonsense he didn't save you to lose you what kind of a god do you think you're servant he wouldn't have saved you in the first place if he thought he was going to lose you his works are perfect from beginning to end if he's got that lump of clay and maybe you're looking at brother Israel and he's got that lump of clay all squished down you're looking at brother Israel like man I don't know if that looks but that's God's work leave it alone it's perfect from beginning to end I'm just teasing my brother Israel but he's looking pretty good to me but God knows he sees down there on the inside of the inside but stop struggling with it if you know you look at somebody they're God's work remember that story of that I think it was it was uh brother Joe Dalton's wife that was a little piano player that brother Bram had to play the piano and she had some makeup and stuff on and they were looking on the outside who was it Jim j Jim's da Jim Ed's wife yeah Mary yeah see the people were looking on the outside that she was God's work you're God's work he said if you are you will because you were he put that in there now just drink drink drink and start acting like you were saved confessing you're saved testifying you're saved get around people that are saved and watch what God will do young people careful who you say are your friends if they're not saved they're going to start to get you to kind of go down that path and you'll lose your confession don't lose your confession I thought I knew who my friends were and then when I didn't have the stuff that they wanted they all left when I got the real drug Christ Jesus they want nothing to do with me that's what I have for you this morning hopefully it encourag somebody if you're struggling I believe God speaking to us that we need to make sure there's a scripture over in second Peter we know it it's the sature of a perfect man add add add add to your faith virtue knowledge but then he says if these things be in you you'll never fall he says make your calling an election sure you were called you were elected but you have to make it sure maybe God's just telling you check up this morning you go will make it sure am I am I standing in there confessing it am I adding a little bit of virtue to that and some patience you know truth he said this is this is to be partakers of God's Own nature the attributes of God we're partakers we just got to drink drink drink go lay in the presence of the sun listen to these tapes push play I believe in push play I push play and I'm telling it's the truth when I was a young man with a big family rais and seven kids we bought the entire tape Library a little at a time cost over $6,000 back then to buy it but the word was precious to us come in my house the whole living room was this nothing the whole wall was a tape Library my friends from work what is that music collection nope that's that's ministry that's preaching it goes all the same preacher a prophet but it's the truth feed on that but you know what brother Billy Paul told me one time he got me he said brother Bates don't
