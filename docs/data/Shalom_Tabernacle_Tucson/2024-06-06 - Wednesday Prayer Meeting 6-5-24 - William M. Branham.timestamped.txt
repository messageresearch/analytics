[27:44] brother
[27:46] Bren thank
[27:50] very good evening friend very happy to
[27:53] be here tonight and to enjoy this
[27:55] wonderful message as much as I heard of
[27:57] it of brother
[27:58] Tom and I know he's a servant of the
[28:02] Lord God because he has proved it ever
[28:06] since I have knew him and so we're very
[28:09] happy for this message and I hope that
[28:10] it went straight home to every heart and
[28:13] now brother Tom's also he is a a
[28:18] missionary to the 0s in Africa and I
[28:22] thank you're making arrangements to
[28:23] giving him and offerings of uh Le I
[28:26] asked for for his na Mission over there
[28:29] I after being there myself while of
[28:32] course knowing just what it really means
[28:34] to be a missionary I think the type of
[28:37] of mission that brother Toms has is
[28:40] really the correct type see the first
[28:43] thing the Na's just a little suspicious
[28:45] of the white man when he comes to begin
[28:47] with but brother Tom has the idea that
[28:51] the lord gave years ago one time I was
[28:54] reading a little book from a mission
[28:56] field and it was a picture of an old
[28:58] colored man little white rimma hair he
[29:00] said white man white man where was your
[29:02] father said I'm old and dull at mine I'm
[29:05] just learning of Jesus if I would have
[29:07] known him I would have t him to my
[29:10] people that struck me if I would have
[29:13] known him when I was young I would have
[29:15] talking to my people now that is right
[29:19] see the first thing the white man can't
[29:21] even go over the na go he can't live on
[29:23] the same thing and I thought get the
[29:25] native saved and let the native do the
[29:27] missionary itself that's what brother
[29:29] Tom says and at
[29:32] Johannesburg the date when we had 30,000
[29:35] converts at afternoon after scene which
[29:38] we had time to tell you the story of it
[29:40] when the man heel walk like a dog and
[29:44] led by a chain and when the Lord Jesus
[29:47] began to reveal things in the audience
[29:49] everyone Dr FF BOS many of you knowing
[29:52] he estimated
[29:54] 25,000 healings at one time 25 5,000 got
[29:59] healed at one prayer when theyve seen it
[30:01] and 30,000 got saved at the same time
[30:05] and he uh I said now don't wait until
[30:09] some missionary comes from America I
[30:12] have all respect for them but the thing
[30:14] of it is friend the David lson isn't no
[30:17] more it's got to be somebody get out
[30:19] there and what they is far theology
[30:23] while they bleed on their idols and so
[30:25] forth and just just merely a change of
[30:27] thought
[30:28] but when they see God moving in his
[30:30] power that's what changes the Navy and I
[30:33] said don't wait for your education go on
[30:35] out and tell your Navy friends that
[30:37] Jesus died for them and I got a piece
[30:40] out of a dering paper that one man who
[30:42] didn't even know which is right in left
[30:44] hand was baptizing as many as a thousand
[30:47] week Naes out in the jungles out in the
[30:48] the field that's it he he didn't even
[30:51] know which was right and left hand but
[30:53] he knew that he had got healed and Jesus
[30:55] loved him and he was telling his NY
[30:56] friends theying right down water and
[30:58] baptized and Justice they come so that
[31:01] is wonderful so while you're supporting
[31:03] or helping in this offering for brother
[31:05] Tom for his na missions over there I'll
[31:07] say with all my heart I think it's a
[31:09] worthy thing a very good thing God will
[31:12] bless you for your help and giv to it
[31:15] there times never asked me to say this I
[31:17] just I just said it because it's it's
[31:19] worthy of everything that we can give to
[31:22] help it out and now I didn't know
[31:25] whether brother V year here here's
[31:29] brother deer sitting here he's taking
[31:31] tape recordings I think and Es deer a

[35:51] answers prayer for the ministry brother
[35:52] too and we it's not only evangelist who
[35:55] comes in and pray for sick God will the
[35:57] prayer of any sincere person that'll
[36:00] pray always like to have a night when
[36:02] the preacher is represented after all
[36:05] when of evangelist E Town if he keeps
[36:07] the congregation around himself well
[36:09] then what's the poor Pastor got when he
[36:10] leaves the people think well the pastor
[36:13] he just remember he's just as much man
[36:15] of God as any evangelist or anything
[36:17] else on the field he's the real true man
[36:19] of God and we like to see them
[36:22] represented here and it let you see that
[36:24] God answers prayer for them I was just
[36:27] thinking
[36:28] coming home last night or uh they let me
[36:31] stay just a little long last night and
[36:33] brother woods and Billy was apologizing
[36:35] way into the night nearly 12:00 about
[36:37] doing it and staying a little long it's
[36:40] something or another I can't explain it
[36:42] friends I wish I could there's no need
[36:44] of even trying it but it just seeming
[36:47] like you're way up about a million miles
[36:49] in air and then you dropped back down to
[36:50] Earth again all at once that's an awful
[36:52] feeling but what does it denote there is
[36:55] a high Rim that we can climb
[36:58] we're going higher
[37:00] someday and um they was telling about
[37:03] something about now the meetings to me
[37:05] the only way I know them is someone to
[37:06] tell me or to pick up one of these tapes
[37:08] I get these tapes also and they're kept
[37:11] for references out of each meeting that
[37:13] I hear the tape over and I hear how the
[37:15] service went but to me it's a dream and
[37:17] then there's something about a colored
[37:20] man there something there laying on a
[37:21] cop or stretcher or something walking
[37:24] and just remind me sometime ago at
[37:26] Dallas I've been over to Dallas for a
[37:28] meeting this a short word now before we
[37:30] call the line I've been over to Dallas
[37:33] for a meeting and well on the road back

[37:40] I had to land at Memphis
[37:42] Tennessee and they take me up to that
[37:44] big famous hotel there which myself it's
[37:47] a good thing the airlines had a because
[37:48] I couldn't stay in that hotel it was um

[37:54] told me they' to call me the next
[37:55] morning give me a room in there to stay

[37:59] morning so I could go on time catch the
[38:01] plane so I said that's fine and I went

[40:31] old typical ank jamama with a with a a
[40:35] man shirt tied around her head and she
[40:37] was leaning across the gate like this no

[40:42] just kind of humming as I seen her
[40:44] looking at me I just quit humming
[40:45] started to pass by her big fat cheek she
[40:49] WIP the tears out of her eyes she said
[40:51] good morning
[40:52] Parson I looked at her and I said ma'am
[40:55] she said I said good morning

[41:02] folks here or not but said good morning
[41:04] Parson I stopped I said how did you know
[41:07] I was a par yeah I thought isn't this
[41:09] strange something began to move maybe
[41:11] this is it what the Lord want me to walk
[41:12] down part so I said how how' you know I
[41:15] was a Parson she said well Parson said
[41:18] when I see you coming she said I know
[41:20] you was a Parson and she said did you
[41:22] ever read that story in the Bible Parson
[41:25] about the shunamite woman who
[41:27] she couldn't have any children and
[41:29] Elijah the prophet went and blessed her
[41:31] and she had the baby I said yes ma'am
[41:34] she said well I was that kind of woman
[41:37] and she said I prayed to the Lord and
[41:40] she said and uh I told the Lord if he'd
[41:42] give me a child I would raise it to love
[41:45] him and honor him she said I a wash
[41:47] woman she said I I wash for living she
[41:50] said then you know when my baby got to
[41:52] be a man said he big boy said he got out
[41:55] with the wrong company part
[41:57] and said he took a horrible disease he
[42:00] said I didn't know it and said he got so
[42:02] far gone until the doctor man says he
[42:05] can't live no more and said he's in
[42:07] there in the house and he's been dying
[42:10] since yesterday and says he don't know
[42:12] where he's at and he's just groaning and
[42:14] said I just can't stand to see my baby
[42:17] die baby 180 pounds about that I just
[42:21] can't see my baby die but remember that
[42:24] was baby to her to her mother right no
[42:27] matter what you are what you do it's
[42:29] still your baby if you're a real mother
[42:31] and so she said I just couldn't stand to
[42:34] see my baby die in that condition
[42:36] knowing that I had promised the Lord to
[42:39] raise him uh to serve the Lord and she
[42:42] said I prayed all night last night and
[42:46] she said I said Lord what can I do now
[42:50] and so said the first thing you know I
[42:52] went to sleep and I dreamed a dream and
[42:55] said I seen a man coming with a tan suit
[42:58] on wearing a tan hat and said the Lord
[43:01] said here's my part and she said that
[43:04] was about 3:00 when I woke up she she
[43:07] said I've been standing here ever since
[43:08] a waiting for you I believe I got the
[43:10] trans position on this maybe and I said

[43:19] on her back where she been standing out
[43:21] there and she said I've been waiting
[43:24] here since 3:00 to see and said when I
[43:26] see you coming down the Street you're
[43:27] the same man I saw in the dream and I
[43:30] know you was the part and she said won't
[43:33] you come in and when she opened up the
[43:36] gate little chain hanging to it and I
[43:38] walked into that little colored person's
[43:41] house that morning there was no rug on

[44:27] crying and she said if I could only hear
[44:30] him say that he was saved said I'd be
[44:33] willing to give him up and so I said

[51:22] now we can't get all them up here on the

[51:28] and anyone coming up doesn't mean
[51:30] they're going to be
[51:31] healed it's just that this is not a show
[51:35] now it's not a stage show it's a
[51:38] religious meeting see the Holy Spirit
[51:41] but it's a Vindication of the presence
[51:43] of the omnipotent and Omission God
[51:46] that's in his presence doing the same
[51:49] thing that he is there any New Comers
[51:50] here for the first time let's see my
[51:53] just look that's what see each night it
[51:56] to explain how that the Lord Jesus let
[51:59] me read just a scripture before we call
[52:01] it s just a moment here's one right here
[52:05] turned right to it in St John the 5th
[52:07] chapter and let's begin at the 33rd
[52:10] verse you sent unto John and he bear
[52:13] witness of the truth but I receive not
[52:16] the testimony from man but the things
[52:19] that I say that you might be saved he
[52:23] was a burning and a Shining Light and
[52:25] you were willing first a season to walk
[52:27] in that life but I have a greater
[52:30] witness than that of John for The Works
[52:33] which the father has given me to do and
[52:36] to finish the same that I do bear
[52:39] witness to me that the father has sent
[52:41] me and the father himself which has sent
[52:44] me has borne life of me
[52:49] now think of it what did Jesus do when
[52:53] he was here on Earth what he did when he
[52:55] was here on Earth if he has he died to
[52:58] save us then returned back into the
[53:00] spirit form he's the same yesterday
[53:01] today and forever he did not claim to be
[53:04] a Healer he only claimed to be able to
[53:07] do what the father showed him by Vision
[53:09] how many Bible readers know that the
[53:11] truth B see Jesus said in St John 5:24
[53:16] verely verely I say unto you as is
[53:17] passed by a great multitude of people
[53:20] lame H blind and
[53:21] withered he he one man lay on a pallet
[53:24] might have had a prosate trouble or
[53:25] something I don't you know something was
[53:27] had it 38 years it wasn't going
[53:29] to kill him but he healed him because
[53:31] God had showed him to go to that person
[53:33] the scripture plainly states that and he
[53:35] said he knew where he was knew he had
[53:37] been in this condition all this time
[53:38] walked away and let the multitude he was
[53:40] questioned that's when he said really
[53:42] barely I say you the son can do nothing
[53:44] in but what he sees the father doing
[53:46] that doth the son likewise when Philip
[53:49] found theel brought him back to show him
[53:52] that he had found the Messiah thought
[53:53] when he walked up into the crowd Jesus
[53:55] looked out and said behold an Israelite
[53:57] whom there's no G that when did you know
[53:59] me Rabbi he said before Philip called
[54:02] you when he under the tree I saw you he
[54:03] said thou the Son of God the king of
[54:05] Israel go to the woman at the well he
[54:08] told her where sins was and so forth
[54:10] he's the same Lord Jesus tonight I
[54:13] believe that and now by the brother
[54:15] preaching the gospel declaring that he
[54:16] is now he will come in his August
[54:18] blessing and come around over us and
[54:22] will declare the same that he is risen
[54:24] from the dead then we are to receive him
[54:27] don't you think so all are to worship
[54:29] him no matter many of you probably will
[54:31] be called up and let's see let's begin
[54:35] somewhere what was that now what was
[54:36] that letter RS RS all right excuse me
[54:40] let's start from 75 tonight you see we

[1:04:44] operated by a spirit represented in a
[1:04:47] body see now I'm not dealing with your
[1:04:50] body I'm dealing with the spirit like
[1:04:52] when when life gos out of a tumor I'm
[1:04:55] not dealing with that gross tumor I'm
[1:04:56] dealing with that life in that gr it's a
[1:04:59] separate life from the person who has it
[1:05:01] or a cancer or cataract or whatever
[1:05:03] disease it is now we're standing here as
[1:05:05] two human beings never met in our lives
[1:05:07] before perfect total strangers to one
[1:05:10] another and you're standing here's a
[1:05:13] woman is a man a very beautiful picture
[1:05:15] to begin with tonight like our lord
[1:05:17] Jesus and not taking his place but I
[1:05:19] mean that he's here you see and the
[1:05:21] woman at the well of Samaria not you
[1:05:23] taking her place but it's just a man and
[1:05:25] a woman been and talking now he talked
[1:05:27] to her for quite a while until he caught
[1:05:29] the conversation till he found out what
[1:05:31] was wrong with her found her spirit and
[1:05:33] then God showed him what was wrong and
[1:05:35] he told
[1:05:35] her he said he said uh go get your
[1:05:39] husband he said I don't have any said
[1:05:41] you said well because you got five and
[1:05:43] he who you now have is not your husband
[1:05:45] in that thou said us well and she said I
[1:05:48] perceive that you are a prophet he said
[1:05:51] I know when Messiah cometh he'll do
[1:05:53] these things but who are you as a the
[1:05:56] prophet he said I'm the Messiah so that
[1:05:59] was the sign of the Messiah then it's
[1:06:01] the sign of the Messiah today and if he
[1:06:04] would come here now in the person of you
[1:06:06] and I and would come in our body and
[1:06:10] would perform the same thing he did for
[1:06:11] that woman at the well would you believe
[1:06:13] it would be the sign of the Messiah
[1:06:16] would you accept it that way will the
[1:06:17] audience recept accept it that way the
[1:06:19] sign of the Messiah I may he granted for
[1:06:23] his glory and for his word sake
[1:06:26] not that we're worthy but for his
[1:06:29] word now the lady standing there talking

[1:06:43] one thing to me about the woman she
