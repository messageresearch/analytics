Thank you Lord for another opportunity to come into your house, worship you, lift up your name this evening. Lord, just thinking before the service, faith comes by hearing, hearing by the word of the Lord. So Lord, we come here tonight to have our faith increased. Lord, just that we can draw closer to you and may your word just take hold in our lives, Lord, that becomes a reality to us and not just words on paper, not just words that we've heard preached, but Lord, it sinks into our heart and and Lord, we just want to yield ourselves to you. Forgive us for for our unbelief, Lord. And we just ask, Lord, if there's anything in our lives that we haven't confessed, Lord, just bring it to our our memory, Lord, we just want to be clean before you this evening. And Lord, as we worship you and sing songs of praise and worship this evening, just ask Lord, just as when David played his harp and it drove the evil spirits away from Saul, Lord, that the worship and the playing would drive any unbelief out of this building tonight and out of our hearts, Lord Jesus. And we just want to redeem the time that you've given us this evening to draw closer to you. we commit it to your hands. We ask in Jesus' name. Amen.

Hallelujah. singing. I love you, Lord. Amen. Say, "I love you, Lord. Lord, I love you. Amen. Praise the Lord, saints. So good to be in the house of the Lord. Tonight, we're going to hear the word of the Lord as we're going into the adoption series again, the church being placed by the teaching of the word. It's found in Ephesians chapter 1 if you'd like to turn there. And I know it'll be a blessing to you. Trust the Lord Jesus has blessed everyone tonight. and we come expecting to feed on the good things of God. There's always something good that he has for us and um we come expecting to hear from him. Ephesians chapter 1 as brother Vanom takes this old this New Testament book and he compares it against the Corinthians and he said the Corinthians were believers but they were immature believers. But he said that the Ephesians typed the book of Joshua, which those were the Hebrews or the Jews that have come out of Egypt. They come through the promised land and now they were conquering and taking over in Canaan land. And that types the true believer of our day. And so we'd like to read in Ephesians chapter 1 verse number three. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ, according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that which that we should be holy and without blame before him in love, having predestinated us unto the adoption ion of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will. Amen. That's a mouthful there. He called us in him before the world began. And I was raised in church my whole life and we never we read those scriptures. We never went into it. I never understood what predestination was. And here those scriptures are telling us that God chose us before the world began. That's so beautiful. So, let's go to the word tonight and hear what the prophet is going to say to us. Paragraph, I think 67 through 110. Right there, we're breaking it in three parts. This is part two out of three parts. So, God bless you. Let's sing Only Believe. Singing Only Believe. [Music] Believe that all things are possible. Only believe. Only believe. Only believe. [Music] All things are possible only. Can we sing Lord I believe. Let's lift our hands and confess. Lord I believe. Lord I believe that all things are possible. Lord, I believe. Oh Lord, that I believe. Oh Lord, I believe that all things are possible. Lord, I believe. God bless. You may be seated, Brother Brandham. How many's received the promise of the Holy Ghost? Aren't you glad that you're in the land? Amen. Over here now, eating the old corn, eating the strong things of God, got a clear understanding. Your your spiritual mind is all unmuddled up. You know exactly who he is. says, "You know exactly what he is. You know exactly where you're going. You know exactly all about it. You know in whom you have believed and persuaded he's able to keep that which you've committed to him against the day." Oh, that's the one. That's who Paul's talking to. Now listen close. Now watch. The faithful in Christ Jesus. Now let me have the church to repeat that. How do we get into Christ? By joining church? No. By putting our name on a book? No. By being baptized by immersing? No. How do we get into Christ? By one Holy Spirit. Amen. Are we all baptized into one promise, the body? Amen. and are partakers of all that belongs into the land. Amen. Amen. Oh, I I like that. If it wasn't a horse, I could shout. When I get in this land, it's mine. I'm home now. I'm in Canaan. Amen. I'm subject to anything God wants to use me for. I'm walking on holy ground. Hallelujah. A child of the king. Amen. All rope and ready. I've come out of Egypt, come up to the promised land. Stood the trials passed over Jordan into this blessed promise. Hallelujah. Oh, how did I get it? By one spirit. The same way Paul got it. Acted on me the same way it did on him. Same way it did on you. Amen. By one spirit we are all baptized. Hallelujah. Not sprinkled, just a little sprinkle of it feel pretty good, but immersed under. Praise God. Oh, make the swim under and the Holy Ghost. That's the promise. are Ephesians are Joshua which is the Holy Spirit. Joshua means Jesus savior. Joshua meaning the Holy Spirit representing it in the spiritual as that was in the natural that he is our great warrior. Amen. He's our great leader. As God was with Joshua, so is God in the Holy Spirit moving us about. And when sin comes in the camp, the Holy Spirit demands a halt. Amen. What's wrong here in this church? Something's wrong. Oh, can't you see how we got too many sons of Kishna? Too many Sauls coming from seminaries and theological schools and going out and teaching this perverse things as the Bible said they would do. Seemingly not having the faith, separating themselves from you, having no fellowship with you, so forth, having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof from such turn away. [Applause] They don't know where they come from. They can't give any reason. I say this from brother Booth Clifford and a friend of mine. If there's anything that's a ill, illegitimate, un God created anything in the world is a mule. A mule is the lowest of all things. He is a He don't know what he is. He cannot produce himself no more. A mule cannot be bred to another mule and become a mule. He's finished. He don't know where his papa come from. Neither does he know his mama. For he is a little a little donkey and a mare horse. God never did that. Don't you lay such as that onto God. God never done that. God said everything shall bring forth of its kind. Amen. Yes sir. But a mule is a um his papa was a donkey and his mama was a maror. So he don't know what he does belong to. He he he's a horse trying to be a mule or a mule or he's a horse trying to be a donkey. A donkey trying to be a horse. He don't know where he does belong. And he is a hardheadedest thing there is in the world. You can never put a bit of trust to him. And that's the way a lot of people are in church. That's right. They don't know who their papa is. They don't know who their mama is. Only thing they know, they're either Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist, or Pentecostal or something. They don't know where they come from. And an old donkey, you can just holler at him as much as you want to holler at him. He'll stand there and stick them big ears out and look. You can preach to them all night long and they don't know a bit more when they left than what they did when they come in. Amen. Now, that's just right. I don't mean to be rude, but I want to tell you the truth. Amen. But there's one thing they can do. They're good workers. Oh, they just work, work, work, work. That puts me in the mind of a bunch of these Armenians that's always trying to work their way into heaven. That's right. A mule. All the ladies aid society and this chicken supper for the pay the preacher and we got to have this dance and this social. It's just work work work work work and they what are they working for? Ask them have you receive the Holy Ghost since you believe they stick out their ears and don't know where they belong. What do you mean? What did all this? What do you mean the Holy Ghost? I don't ever heard nothing about it. Oh, you must be some kind of fanatic. See, they don't know who Papa was or who mama was either. And you have to beat them on everything you do. Beat here and beat there and beat here and beat there. That's right. An old mule. But I tell you, you don't have to do that by a real thoroughbreed horse. Just crack the whip over him one time and brother, he's gone. He knows what he's doing. Oh, how fine it is to ride a thorbread. How nice is it? Come on, boy. Oh, man. You better hold tight. You'll leave the saddle in the air. That's the way it is with real thoroughb breaded Christians. Hallelujah. Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Amen. Repeat, everyone of you, be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins. Gone. Just as quick as they can get to the water, they're gone. They can't rest day and night until they receive the Holy Ghost. Why? You know, a Christian knows who his papa was. See, it takes two to make a birth. That's right. Papa and mama. The mule don't know which was papa, which was mama. But we know who papa mama was. For we were born of the written word of God, confirmed by the spirit. Peter said on the day of Pentecost, "If you will repent and be baptized, every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins, you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." And brother, a real bornagain Christian, oh my, he's spirited. As soon as he gets the word, he receives the Holy Ghost. Ask him something, man. He knows where he's standing. Do you believe in divine healing? Amen. You believe in the second coming? Amen. That's the mule thing. The mule religion. I don't know. Dr. Jones said one time, "Oh, they're going at your Saul." See, oh, they don't know. Well, I tell you, my church is not sure of it. Oh, brother, but a bornag again man and woman is just as sure of the coming of the Lord Jesus, they're just as sure they got the Holy Ghost as there is a Holy Ghost to be given. Jesus said the woman at the well, we worship in this mountain and the Jews worship at Jerusalem. He said,"Woman, hear my words. The hour is coming, and now is, when the Father seeketh those that'll worship him in the spirit and the truth. Thy word is the truth." Amen. And every man that'll read the Bible and believe every word that Bible says and follow its instructions and receive the same Holy Ghost that they received, the same way they received it, same results they received it, same power they got when they received it. He knows who his papa and mama was. He knows he's washed in the blood of Jesus Christ, born of the spirit, filled with God's uncction. He knows where he's standing. Sure, he's in Canaan. He knows where he come from. That's the way it is with a real Christian asking, "Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed?" Amen, brother. Praise the Lord. Stand the other day by an old saint, 92 years old, talking to her 80year-old pastor. I said, "Grandma, just as bright as she could be." She said, "Yes, my son." I said, "How long has it been since you received the Holy Ghost?" She said, "Glory to God." About 60 years ago, I got it. Now she'd been a mule. She'd said, "Now wait a minute. I was confirmed in Sprinkle when I was well certain." And they take me into the church and I took my letter over to Oh, mercy. They don't even know where they belong. But she know where her birthright come from. She was there when it happened. She was born of the water and of the spirit. She know and the water through the washing of the water by the word takes the word. Now watch how this is addressed to those that are in Christ Jesus. Paul remember I'm taking a long time but I ain't going to get through this chapter. But I heard you like it. It tells us where we are. But we can't do it in just one night. We need a month or two of this. Yes. every night. Just go right to it word by word. Go back and bring it up in the histories and lay it right out word by word and show you that it's the truth. Yes. Now, let me read that verse quickly again. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, not the will of man, to the saints which are in Ephesus and conjunction to the faithful in Christ Jesus means they've been called out, separated, and have been baptized by the Holy Spirit and are in Christ Jesus. I'm addressing this epistle to you, my beloved ones. Oh, I think of Paul over there with him right now. Oh, how happy that little old apostle had his head chopped off down there. I stood by the place where they chopped his head off, but oh, his head's on and that new body can never be chopped off again. And he's standing over there with him this very minute. Amen. The same apostlate wrote this and said to you that are in Christ Jesus. By one spirit we're all baptized into this one body. Now watch. Grace be unto you and peace from God our father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all. Amen. Amen. Glory to God. Do you hear that? J has blessed us with all spiritual blessings. Not just some to the apostles and some to this, but he's blessed us with all spiritual blessings. Amen. The same Holy Ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost here tonight. Amen. The same Holy Ghost that made Mary shout and speak with tongues and have a wonderful time and rejoice and the things that she did is the same Holy Ghost here tonight. The same Holy Ghost that let Paul and that old ship where it looked like his water log and was gone and 14 days and nights, no moon and stars looked out there and every wave had a devil on it glancing and gleeding his teeth and said, "I'll sank you, old boy now. I got you now." While Paul went down to have a little prayer, there stood an angel and said, "Don't you fear, Paul." This old ship's going to be wrecked up on a certain island. Go ahead and eat your supper. It's all right. Now here he cometh in chains on his little arms dragging him on his feet and said be of a good courage man for the God the angel of God whose servant I am stood by me and said Paul don't you fear that same Holy Ghost is here tonight same spirit of God minister to us the same spiritual blessings bless us with all spiritual blessings In heavenly places. Oh, let's stop just one more minute here. In heavenly places. Not just not out anywhere, but in heavenly places. We are assembled in heavenly. It means that the position of the believer that if I'm prayed up, you're prayed up. The church is prayed up. and we're ready for the message. And we have assembled ourselves together as saints, called out, baptized with the Holy Ghost, filled with God's blessings, called elected, set together in heavenly places. Now we are heavenlies in our souls. Our spirits has brought us into a heavenly atmosphere. Oh, brother. There you are. A heavenly atmosphere. Oh, what could happen tonight? What could happen tonight if we would be sitting here in a heavenly atmosphere? Praise God. And the Holy Spirit moving over every heart that's been regenerated and become a new creature in Christ Jesus. All sins under the blood in perfect worship with our hands up to God and our hearts lifted sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Worshiping together in the heavenly places. Did you ever set one? Oh, I have set weep for joy and say God never let me leave here. Amen. Just heavenly places in Christ Jesus blessing us with what? Divine healing, fornowledge, revelation, visions, powers, tongues, interpretations, wisdom, knowledge, all the heavenly blessings and joy unspeakable and full of glory. Every heart filled with the spirit walking together, sitting together in heavenly places. Not one evil thought among us. Not one cigarette smoke. Not one sharp dress. Not one this that or the other. Not one evil thought. Nobody got anything against one another. Everybody speaking in love and harmony. Everybody with one accord and one a place. Then suddenly there come from heaven a sound like a rushing mighty wind. There you are has blessed us with all spiritual blessings. Then the Holy Spirit might fall upon somebody and say, "Thus sayaeth the Lord, go to a certain place and do a certain thing." Watch it happen just like that. Amen. Thus sayeth the Lord, do a certain thing at a certain place. Watch it happen like that. blessed us together in all heavenly blessings and heavenly places. Watch according as he has chosen us. Did we choose him or he chose us? He chose us when the night that we accepted him. chosen according as he has chosen us in him before the foundations of the world that we should be holy without blame before him in denominations in love. When did God choose us? When did God choose you that's got the Holy Ghost? When did he choose you? Before the foundation of the [Music] world. By his fornowledge he foresaw you and know that you love him. And before there was a foundation of the world, he chose you. Amen. and sent Jesus that he might be the propitiation of your sins to call you to reconciliation to himself to love. Oh, wish we had just a few more minutes time. Let me before we go any further, go back Genesis 1:26. I'll pick it up Wednesday. When God made man, before he made man, he called himself l e l l e l h l eloh him. The word means in the Hebrew the selfexistence all by himself. Nothing existed before him. He was all the existence he ever was. Selfexistence one. Amen. L Elohim means all sufficient, all powerful, allmighty, self-existence one. Hallelujah. But in Genesis 2, when he made man, he said, "I am Y a hu J u v u h Yahwa Jehovah." What did it mean? I am the allexistence one who has created something all for myself to be a son of mine or a temporary or an amateur little one of mine. Amen. Why? He gave man. Jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur god because he is father God and he made a man an amateur god. So he isn't self-existence anymore. He exists with his family. Hallelujah. El Elohim. Now, now he is Jehovah. Jehovah meaning the one who exists with his family. Now, God made man to be the predominant over all the earth. He had dominion and the earth was man's dominion. Is that scripture? Then if that's his domain, he was God over the earth. Yeah, he could speak and it would be so. He could speak this and it would be so. Amen. There he is. God, Jehovah, the one who once existed in self-existence, but now exists with his family and his little ones with him. Amen. There you are. Hallelujah. Now, read that. We'll get into it Wednesday night when we got more time. We just about 15 more minutes and we I thought I'd get to a certain spot here, but uh we won't till we're sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise. All right. Now, when was we called to be servants of God? When was Arville Neville called to be a servant of God? This staggers me. I tell you, let's get some scriptures. I want you to get First Peter uh 1:20 and uh Pat, get Revelation 17:8 and uh I'll get Revelations 13. Now, we want to listen here. You want to know when God called you to be a Christian? Oh, I love this. This is man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God. All right, brother Neville, you got 1 Peter 120. 120. Read 119 and 120. Listen to this. 119 and 20. Yes. but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, who verily was for ordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you. When was he for ordained? Before the foundation of the world. Brother Pat, read Revelation 17:8 for me. The beast that thou sest was and is not, and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into predition, and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was and is not of yet. Who's going to be deceived? Who's going to be deceived by this religious person like Saul was that was just so cunning and so perfect to it would deceive thee what very e if possible if possible. All right. Revelations 13:8. Let me read it for you. And all that dwell upon the earth shall all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names were not written in the book of life of the lamb slaying before the foundation of the world. Hallelujah. When was our names put in the lamb's book of life? When the lamb was slaying before the foundation of the world. When God was Jehovah El Elo Elohim, the self-existence one, just like one great big diamond, and he could not be nothing else. But inside of this diamond, his attributes was a savior. Amen. In this attributes on the inside of him was a healer. Hallelujah. Well, there was nothing to save and nothing to heal. But his attributes produced it. So then before the foundation of the world when he knowed that the great display in here of him that he would be a savior that he would come and be made flesh and dwelt among us and he knowed by his stripes would be healed. He slayed the lamb on his book before the foundation of the world and wrote your name on that book before the foundation of the world. Hallelujah. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Listen to this. Predestination looks back to fornowledge. I mean election election looks back to fornowledge and predestination looks to destiny. Don't forget that that election looks back here is I was a cockleber. I was born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies born among sinners father and mother and all my whole family sinners. I was a cockleberg but all of a sudden I become a wheat grain. How did it happen? Uh that what is that election? God before the foundation of the world elected that the cockab was to become a grain of wheat. Now I know I'm a grain of wheat because I'm saved. How do I do it? Look back and see that he predestinated it long time ago by fornowledge. He seen that I would love him. So he made a propituation through his own son that through him I might become from a of bird to a grain of wheat. Now where am I at now? I'm saved. I'm walking in the grace of God. What does predestination look to destiny? Where will he take me to and where am I going? That's got you. There you are. Now let's read just a little farther and then we'll have to close pretty sharply. according as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption predestinated unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will. What did he do? He by forn knowledge forsaw us knowing that he was a savior self-existence. There was no angels, no nothing. Just God Elo Elohim, the self-existence one. Nothing but him alone. But in him was a savior. Amen. Well, what's he going to say? There's nothing lost. Knowing that, then he know that this great attribute in him would project something out down there that he could save. Then when it did that by forn knowledge, he looked down and he saw everyone that would accept it. And then by doing so, he said, "Thus say that the only way I can do it will be come down myself and be made flesh and take the sin of the man upon him and die for him that I might be the one that's worshiped because he is God, the object of worship." Amen. Then he came down and taken upon himself. And while he did that, he did that that he might save you who wants to be saved. Praise the Lord. Do you see what I mean? By forn knowledge. Amen. The infinite God who know all things saw the lamb and he slayed the lamb before the foundation of the world. and he put your name on the lamb's book of life and he seen the deceitfulness of Satan what he would do. So he put your name on there and he said that the Antichrist would be so religious, so good, such a fine fellow, such a smart man, such a religious man that he would deceive the very elected if it was possible. But it isn't impossible because their means were for orained before the foundation of the world. By election he chose them and by predestination they know where they are going. Amen. There you are. Now who could doubt that? That's what Paul said. That's Paul's scripture. That's Paul's writing. That's what he taught his church. The church positionally before the foundation of the world when God and his labor pain was bringing forth bringing forth you knowing what you would do he positionally placed you into his own body. Amen. Amen. To be a housewife, to be a farmer, to be a preacher, to be a prophet, to be this or to be that, he placed you positionally. Then when we have come from the garlic lands of Egypt through sanctification and baptized into the promised land, for the promise of God is the Holy Ghost. Amen. Ephesians 4:30 says, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption." Amen. Then God having predestinated the church, he said, "And all the peoples, there will be millions times millions that will walk very religious and be deceived." Yeah. The only ones that will not be deceived will be those that have come over into the promised land who before the foundation of the world had their names put on the lamb's book of life and come over into the promised land and enjoying it. Amen. Let's all stand. Help me thank God for the word tonight. Oh my, this nice deep teaching that we've heard it before, but we need to be reminded that our name was in Elohim before the foundation of the world. Amen. Let us take our prayer request tonight. If anyone has a prayer request to bring before the saints. Yes, brother Chris. Okay, Chris's niece Jen, pray for her touching her body. Was there someone else as a request tonight? Always pray for one another. Pray for the work of the Lord that's going around the world. missionary efforts, pastors, ministers, minist ministries, all the youth. Pray that the Lord will give us another outpouring of his Holy Spirit that we need, that he'll bless us to go into the adoption, not just be church members, but we're predestinated to the adoption. Amen. So, let's sing that hymn of the church. Let's sing that song, Have Faith in God. prepare to go to the Lord in prayer. Oh, have faith in God. Have faith in God. [Music] Have faith in God for the answer. Have faith in God. One more time. Oh, have faith in God. Hallelujah. Have faith in God. Have faith in God for the answer. have faith in God. We're going to continue to keep Sister Lorie Snow in prayer. She's not out of the um the woods yet. We're still claiming her healing, but she really needs a touch from the Lord, and she needs our prayers tonight. Sister Lorie Snow and also Brother McGraw and Sister McGraw that he's she's taking care of him and she really needs somebody to take care of her and they're just just precious old saints and they don't have a lot of confidence just strangers and new doctors and all of that. So they're really just kind of to themselves. And so I'm asking the Lord to touch them and strengthen them. The Lord will just give them what they have need of. And also for the little group of believers that gather there in Mesa, um keep them in prayer. Amen. And pray for one another. So you can pray right at your seat. You can come to the altar and pray.

I don't know why the Lord gave me favor with the carpenters, but he did open the door for that little work to be what it is. And it's unique. I don't know what the full um how far it goes, but I know that it's growing just a little bit. A few little different little saints are coming in there. And um of all of the places to for the Lord to open the door to open the door there in the Mesa church where brother Random preached, one of the first message churches there. And I didn't push myself there. The Lord opened that door. A little desire in my heart for it and he opened it and so it's there. So you pray for it. I know everyone doesn't understand it and that's okay. I don't fully understand it. But however the Lord wants to lead and bless it, that's what I want. So you pray for that group and the believers there and the saints that can be reached there in that little city. Amen. So God bless you richly.
