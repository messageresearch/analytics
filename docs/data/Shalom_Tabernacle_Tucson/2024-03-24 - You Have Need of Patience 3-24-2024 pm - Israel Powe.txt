again Lord we thank you for this beautiful atmosphere of worship the Believers have come Lord you have Let Your Presence be felt Among Us Lord we thank you for that we need that so much Lord in our lives to feel your hand upon us Lord to guide us we ask your blessings upon this portion of the service May each one that's gathered oh God receive their portion we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated just for a moment and so we just go into a few announcements and as we appreciate each of you we thank you for there was I think a few more votes or ballots to come in for people to cast their vote and uh we like it when you make comments or leave comments that little box in the back there it's for the purpose purp of taking some of those comments that you might have and and uh those those if you have a question or something even some people send me say Brothers I really like this tape and I've done that many times we'll play a tape from those suggestions and comments and so um we want to thank the Lord for our board that we have here amen they work very hard and it's a small small board and we need to add more and so we will um we have talked with uh a couple of the brothers and there you know brother sarano helps us out in the back brother galante also Joe helps us out and um um so as the Lord works that out we will move forward into adding some more folks uh to our board to help serve the bride of Christ really that's what we're doing and so it's a really wonderful thing to to be able to work alongside people you know we on the board we don't always agree and um and so somebody said talk about that no I'm not going to talk about that but we we're honest and we're respectful in our approach and I appreciate that here a few weeks ago I met with the ministers here brother George brother banza brother um Josh and um um there in Phoenix and Levi was there also he helps in the music and so forth and they were able to just give me some feedback of what's on their heart and their burden I um want to um and so we've delayed the that that the the the voting and so forth uh because we just the time every weekend something changed or happened and then finally the situation here in this building we had a Time deadline that we were supposed to be leaving 6 months after sometime last year then they extended that uh and that would have been up to maybe and it's kind of a gray area maybe June of this year there's a building that came up on a little property that came up on the market and so uh John helped us with that and we were kind of and that was the weekend I went to Warz I had already saw it but the brothers here the board went and looked at that and so we were kind of and looking at going forward with that and um they sent an email afterwards telling us that the developers they need more time and so I'm saying yeah take all the time you need so we didn't you know took that pressure off of us to have to push and move to to to make a decision like that and so we uh thank the Lord for that to be honest with you so we have um until the end of the year at least and maybe even more and that's kind of the the you know the TUSD that we rent from they're kind of loose in their ways and that's been a benefit to us because they don't get in our business and I and they don't bother us and they've been very very We complain about nothing when you find out what other people's are paying for a building of this size oh no you don't complain about nothing so we haven't been complaining but we are conscience of the Saints here you know the air conditioning and and so forth so we got a plan for that and we trust the Lord will bless you and help you as you continue to support I know many of you most of you will still praise the Lord even if we didn't have air conditioning can I get a witness can I get a witness Hey Brother Israel if you don't get that AC fix we're out of here I'm streaming well we understand those things and so we it's available for us and so we we're moving in that direction and we trust the Lord will continue to bless you and help you as you support the the little work here and it's on our heart for this building fund and and and uh doing something in that line as the prophet and maybe I'll bring some quotes on that and then it help you Saints and the trustees will be in charge of that and they'll commission that and keep you up a breast of that another develop for my heart was when I took this trip down to Warz wadz and I met this fine Pastor here with brother arando he here in our assembly and I forgot him and then in war as I saw him again and he's here with us again uh this evening he pastors of church Shalom Tabernacle and so I wrote his name down I'm so bad about that and I just left it on my desk or whatever so what's your name my brother again Cesar brother Cesar yeah yeah brother Cesar and I believe that's his wife um and um and of course sitting next to him is my good friend brother Armando Rivera right Pastor he just drops in on us like this he really should be preaching tonight sure but uh we're going to we'll leave he said leave me alone all right okay I'm going leave him alone tonight all right and so we appreciate our brother Cesar and going down in New Mexico and seeing those Brothers serve I said this is me right here these people are me that's what I actually stood at the P pull pit and I told them I am Mexican the soy Mexicano and they and they looked again are you sure brother po of course if I was in China I would be a China man too so for clarity so you just reone with them and we want to get behind something and I see rushing and the brother you can see the stress on the pastor and his wife they're running these meetings and trying to get something going and at the end you see three people make a decision and it turns out to be six people that get baptized I don't know who wouldn't want to be a part of that I was so glad it just touched my spirit and heart that I should be doing a bit more we should be doing a bit more in the missionary work with the people that we know eyeball to eyeball Pastor to pastor and so I believe that's available to us there are neighbors right next door and I believe the Lord will give us the opportunity and at the same time there's a good friend and Pastor from Jamaica that have been calling me and to come and just to come and be a part of his church I've known him for years maybe 14 15 years 15 years I've never obviously been to Jamaica and he really wanted me to come for Easter time and I know you all would have loved for me not to be here but I decided to stay home for Easter and um but I thought I said well maybe if I asked him I said if we if if I if I recommend a brother to come would you be okay oh we would love that and so I had brother George on my mind and I asked brother George and he was willing to go and so the Lord is going to work that out for him to go and to minister there at the Easter weekend and they're going to really put him to work and um but he's capable and um and I know he's the Lord will bless the people there with the word of God there and they feed the people and so I would like to be able to uh maybe send some kind of support to those meetings as they go forward as a free will offering for that missionary work back to Warz so the Warz meeting were so be blessing and beneficial I took pictures I sent those to Sister Aaron and she put them up on the website now so you can go and see that great work it's on Shalom Tabernacle website just go right on there you don't need a password and you can see 15 or 20 pictures or whatever and you can see the pastor and some of those folks and the great work that brother Tito is doing down there and I want to put my shoulder right to that AB no question about it so and this other brother uh here in Jamaica a fine Brother fine Pastor he's getting all the churches he can together they all support each other and mono Bay there and brother George will be going there and we'll be praying with our brother and then um it may be on Wednesday when's your last day here George uh Wednesday night Wednesday night okay so Wednesday you actually leave Thursday Thursday morning early yes okay so maybe Wednesday the Lord willing will take up a missionary offering for Jamaica brother George will make a report they've been building on a tabernacle there for years I've sent them reports over the years I've never been there he send me videos of their their thing and their structure he lives right next door and um and so that that we'll make that available to you to do that amen and um you're always in the will of God when you are doing missionary work if you can't go and send somebody amen amen so that's what we will do we trust the Lord will bless each of you I think that it's all that we have we like to go into the word Hebrews chapter 10 quickly and we trust it to be a blessing to you let's stand to our feet as we take this scripture now there's a lot of people we can support there's a lot of poor people right here in this city they come in here they ask us for money I don't know what they're going to do with it but if I know a pastor that's preaching this message and I say that purposely this message the last day truth that's my brother amen and I'm going to stand with him yes sir if the Lord would help me and I believe we can stand with him amen amen Hebrews chapter 10 verse number 3 five the Bible says cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward for you have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not t now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back oh my unto predition but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul thank the Lord you have need of patience that's the title of the message here tonight we pray God will bless you uh you may be seated I'm going to continue just a little bit what we talked about this morning on the open book of redemption I'm titling it that you have need of patience because patience is where the great breakdown happened in the garden remember Adam lost Adam who was our father lost the deed to all of creation he lost the authority that he had over the world over all of God's creation brother bam calls him the god of the earth he gave up his deity if you would to go and follow after his wife and he forfeited it now how did that happen what it took place and we went into that this morning and we understand that there was a law or a process for the return of this great book of redemption back into the hands of man Satan has partial control as a squatter on the earth he's in control of politics and all the world order and the world world system but the Earth is self still Belongs to the Lord and the meek shall inherit the earth actually it actually gets back comes back to us when he tempted Jesus he tried to get him to Bow Down and Worship and I'll give you all the kingdoms of the earth brother bam says Jesus knew that he would capture all that in the Millennium after he paid the price and so he had no he didn't want to he didn't sell out like Adam did but we understand also that Adam wasn't just a bum no who sold out Adam deliberately as a kinsman redeemer saved his wife by going in and God created a path of redemption and that's the great Redemption story which this Bible the book is the book of redemption brother um I was trying to find it this morning and brother Josh picked it up for me on that quote and here again I didn't bring again that you are sealed with the book of redemption amen amen and uh I probably should read it help me out Josh thank you just bring it up here yeah thank you all right I like people that hand me quotes that's right they're good people right paragraph 75 in the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals now notice now this book is sealed and you are sealed with the book until the day of redemption now if somebody took off Dancing I wouldn't have stopped you let let me let me read that one more time I think there's an amen down in you that wants to say Amen I'm going give you the opportunity to say Amen all right paragraph 75 in the message the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals now notice this book is sealed and you are sealed with the book until the day of redemption so ain't nobody being lost we are sealed until the day of our Redemption it's not a temporary fix but God before the foundation of the world had our life plotted out and laid out for us and we are just now coming into realization of Who We Are amen we are Sons and Daughters of God and God has given us this great heritage that uh that the original man had we're just coming out of our Amnesia we're kind of just waking up to really like wow I wasn't lucky when I got saved it wasn't luck it wasn't just like per chance somebody just happened like I like it was an almost I didn't make it but no it was deliberate the coworker that handed me the church yes sir Hallelujah yes sir God knew that I would be working there you know God gave me that job and on the job was a man that had this Revelation then he shared the book with me and then my life never been the same that's deliberate Saints that's not winning the lottery that's not you were lucky that wasn't you having a great day that was God for ordained it and now we're just now coming into realization of it so how and why did they lose this book now this was um Eve through her lack of patience to see the word develop in her life now if you really look at yourself if you're ever trying to accomplish anything let's try to ride a bike or hit a baseball or preach the gospel whatever it is and someone is trying to teach you or bring you along Isn't it nice when they're patient with you the teacher to the student the teacher is looking after he's not judging you every mistake that you made he he bringing you along he's watching you and anything he tells you as far as correction goes it's for your benefit he's watching you in parts that you can't see yourself you think you you you think you're standing up straight or you think you're doing it right but he's on the back watching your form and everything and he's taking notes to make you a better whatever you're trying to be and we all need patience when we're trying to do something can I get a witness we all need patience but we also need to give patience so you know you know somebody's going forward they're trying to do something that's right it could be a a young Church or a young Pastor or young Ministry a soloist singing their first song or whatever it may be then you know the older ones should have patience with that one to watch this this child or this young person develop yes if you squash them you can hurt them and you know the the scriptures require that we have this patience and the Lord and and in what Adam lost the reason they lost it is because Eve could not wait they knew they had this Authority they knew that they would come to spoken word children that this would take place that there was a great manifestation to come and the Temptation was for them to get ahead of God and so this this lack of patience we see it in the book of Exodus if we can turn there quickly Exodus chapter 24 amen cuz we have the promises we see the word it's been made manifested before us we know it's true but then are we going to make anything happen are we going to manufacture something that's right are we going to make God do it now well we can't you have to wait on the Lord and be of good courage wait I say upon the Lord yes and you wait until he brings it to pass and sometimes you're waiting for quite some time look at Exodus chapter 24 and verse is number let's take number 1 through 8 just quickly and he said unto Moses come up unto the Lord thou Aaron NAD abaho and 70 of the Elders of Israel and worship you a far off and Moses alone shall come near the Lord but they shall not come nigh neither shall the people go up with him and Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord all the judgments and all the people answered with one voice and said all the words which the Lord had said will we do Moses wrote all the words of the Lord rose up early in the morning and built an altar under the hill 12 pillars according to the 12 tribes of Israel he sent a young man of the children of Israel which offered burnt offerings sacrificed peace offerings oxen of oxen unto the Lord and Moses took half of the blood put it in the Basin half of the blood sprinkled it on the altar he took the book of the Covenant and read in the audience of the people and they said all that the Lord had said will we do and be obedient and Moses took the blood and sprinkled on the people and said behold the blood of the Covenant which the Lord ha made with you concerning all these words so the Lord is calling Moses these three men apart along with the 70 apart and now he's going to now bring the Ten Commandments to Moses now part of the word was written in the the other books you'll see laws on how to treat the animals and different things like that and disciplinary laws and so forth your neighbor your brother these aren't the Ten Commandments he had already they already had those but here now this is written before them and they take this and they read it out to the people and all the people say we will do it now verse n then went up Moses and Aaron naan and abue and 70 of the Elders of Israel and they saw the god of Israel look at this verse 10 and they saw the god of Israel and they saw saw the god of Israel and there was under his feet as it were a pave work of sapphire stone and as it were the body of Heaven in his clearness and upon the Nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand meaning Lord the Lord didn't strike them also they saw God and did eat and drink and the Lord said unto Moses come up to me into the mount and be there and I will give thee tables of stone and a law and Commandments which I have written thou mayest that thou mayest teach them Moses rose up his Minister Joshua Moses went into the Mount of God and he said unto the elders T here for us until we come again unto you and behold Aaron and her are with you if any man have any matters to do let him come unto them and Moses went up into the mount and the cloud covered the mountain the glory of the Lord above upon the mountain SI and the cloud covered it how many days 6 days and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud and the sight of the glory of the Lord was like a devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel and Moses went into the midst of the cloud and got him up into the mount and Moses was in the mount 40 days and 40 nights so very powerful portion of scripture what's taking place here Moses is telling these faithful ones the 70 plus these three men that were called by name to wait here until I return back here uh but before that they saw the Lord they saw his countenance how he stood the Lord didn't smite them he gave them a witness clearly that this was God speaking to Moses now this is this wasn't the whole congregation but these were the 70 these were the leaders these were men and they opened their eyes and they saw that there was the Lord and a and Moses says T here until I return and and look look here's Aaron here's her if anything comes up go to these brothers they'll be faithful until I get back allegedly allegedly they'll keep you in the right way allegedly they should have sir 30 40 days go by 40 days and 40 nights you know you can find out your true friend in the week almost these days and people can't wait on you for nothing they they put you on the clock you make a mistake they got their Market against you you know give me some patience I need to give you some patience and while they saw the Lord and Moses goes up into the mount there here's this span of time where the Prophet isn't here anymore and here the people are here and there is no answer there is no personal conduct or contact with Moses so here's the Temptation here that Adam and Eve were fac with now brother bam tells us in the message wisdom versus Faith paragraph 229 he says this here Jesus said my sheep hear my voice they can tell whether it's a goat he's a sheep himself uh-huh my sheep know my voice strangers they won't follow what is his voice here it is the word see my sheep know my voice drop down to paragraph 234 he said but oh you think that a good loving father would do a thing like that what she do she listened to reason took his wisdom it's a tree Delight one can be desired of and she fell for it that's exactly when she did what happened like it would to any woman as soon as you fall for it it finishes you you right there that's right now you see the seed that she was holding and would have finally become a mother by the will of God through a spoken word she would have finally become a mother but she couldn't wait went into that now you see then as soon as she did that accepted wisdom with the word and wisdom was contrary to the word you understand amen so we see that the issue with with with Eve was she couldn't wait now brother bam deals with this again and the spoken word is the Original Seed and he says this here paragraph 52 and part two and this book has the numbers off a little bit but I think you'll be able to find it it's in the spoken words of the Original Seed the part two portion he says the bride today is a byproduct see she calls herself the bride but what she is she made up of the material of organization not of the word so much so much word in it to make it kind of a byproduct to make it hypocritical Eve believed most of the word but she doubted one part of it today she can't even get Acts 20 Matthew 28:19 straight with acts 238 see it confuses her that's just one little place of the hundreds of others now the Bride of Adam was a type of the second Adam's bride and Adam's bride could not wait God had told Adam and Eve multiply and replenish the Earth it was an oncoming thing a promise she was not his wife as yet he had never lived with her the bride of Christ is not his wife yet the wedding supper is to take place get it she she got in a hurry and what did she do she crossed her seed she mingled it with the serpent seed and when she did she brought what did she bring she brought forth a child of death a child that she perverted every child after that and when the Church of Jesus Christ was perverted in the time of Rome after her virgin birth and was given to Christ at Pentecost what did she do she crossed herself with Roman Dogma the Protestant church has done the very same thing she can't wait a woman engaged to a fine young clean man before they come together what's she done she's found pregnant by some o someone else then her own seed which is betroth her own body which is betroth to her boyfriend her engaged husband is found full of the seed of another man what a disgrace that's exactly what Adam found that's what Christ has found couldn't wait that's what's the matter with the people today they can't wait for the real Holy Spirit to take the church in position they've got to manufacture something work something up initial evidence speaking in tongues to get more members in the church and all these kind Tommy Rod instead of waiting upon the Lord for the real manifestation of the resur ction of Christ making himself known among the people brothers and sisters if you notice all of the movements that happened that continue to happen in the message they have we turned a corner this is the Revelation now and this group has it it's all because they can't wait all right yes sir see see when the prophet was here you wouldn't be doing that amen if the prophet was here you wouldn't have a problem taking communion it wouldn't be an issue taking the Lord suffer but he's not here now and you know what's what's going on so we've turned a corner now we got to change we got another anointing we got we got to make this thing you know we got to make it more you know interesting for the Youth it's boring to stand up and read quotes boring to who all right all right right boring to who yes sir are we just going to listen to a t what do you mean just that's going to listen to a tape what tape are you listening to the prophet oh my that's fire we should be fired up for that amen Saints for sure and so it's all because they can't wait we can't wait for the real manifestation to come I didn't know brother brownon was coming I wasn't praying for him to come but he came and now I know he's here now I can see in the Bible he was supposed to be here so I don't need to jump out ahead of God and say what's going to happen next let it take place it will vindicate what it is this Vindicated what it was can I get a witness somebody yes sir wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen your heart amen amen now this um this this waiting on the Lord this Eve she couldn't wait Aaron and NAD they couldn't wait turn to Exodus 32 so Exodus 24 we saw what happened Moses in the mountain he tells your brethren to wait on him then Exodus 25 it goes a little bit deeper on what the and the experience the Lord is that Moses is having with the Lord 26 Along on in there then Exodus chapter 32 look at verse one look at this this is just 40 Days Later a little over a month later and when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron and said unto him up make us Gods which shall go before us for as for this Moses the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt we W not what is become of him now who would make a statement like this first of all I can see somebody from the congregation making this statement but none of the 70 elders should have they should be solid they saw God the Bible said they saw God they saw how he stood there and God didn't spite him he came into their presence Vindicated that it was God and Moses told him wait here until I get back what you mean you don't know what happened to him he's on his way back that's what happened to him he's coming back yes sir he said he was coming back glory to God she talking about you don't know what happened to him what do you mean he said he was coming back where's the men at in this congregation all right this is Aaron his older brother right he's talking about a shame on you that's a shame on you Aaron this is your brother your baby brother that rose up in our midst and we know that God was with him yes sir 40 days later you let the congregation turn you away from this glor ious commandment H so this is the great Temptation that Eve was faced with she couldn't wait and then of course we know the Plan of Redemption now as I shared with you this morning and the other night the Bible is the book of redemption is that right it is The Book of Life it has the answers to life it has the answers to your life amen nothing in your life will make sense until you come in contact with the good book The Bible there's been an onslaught of critics against the word even message Believers try to downplay what the Bible say and try to make the Bible and the message two separate works if you're stranded on the island you know the crazy little scenario if you were stranded on the island first of all let's pray that we don't get stranded on no island so we don't have to come with this nonsense so we stranded on the island if you had to keep one book which book would you keep well the Bible is 66 one of the 66 which one you going to take the Bible or brother Brandon's message and that's an argument for whoever wants to have that argument to me they're one and the same work that's right the author sent this message like you said the Bible and this book the Bible is the book of redemption it's the book of life it answers the questions for all life including your life you know if it answers all the questions to life but it doesn't answer the question to your life then it's still really just a regular book but when it begins to answer the question to your life then it becomes a more intimate book it becomes a love letter from your heavenly father to you in the book it tells you why you're here it tells you your purpose and where you're going what other piece of literature can tell you about yourself what other piece of writing can tell you where you're going it's the good book The Bible and this Bible was meant to be read you open it up and you read it now through the script ures it was recorded for a purpose in J Exodus 17 Moses tells Joshua to write this for a memorial in the book Exodus 341 it says the Lord said unto Moses heue thee two tables of stone like unto the first write it upon these tables of words that I that were in the first tables Exodus 34:27 and the Lord said to Moses write these words for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel and Deuteronomy 27 deals with it Jeremiah 36 1-4 you see the Lord telling these prophets to write it down write it in the book keep it for a memory rehearse it back to the ears of your children the reason why it's written down is so somebody else can read it again it keeps the book of Li because it's written down and it's meant to read again read it in 20 years read it in 100 years read it when you get it into your possession Ezekiel form thereof and all the ordinances Luke chap 1 1-4 I'm just rattling these off but Luke chapter 1 1-4 says for as much this is Luke The Physician for as much as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us even as they delivered unto us which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and Ministers of the word okay it seemed good to me also having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first to write unto thee in order most excellent Theophilus that thou mayest know the certainty of those things wherein thou H has been instructed so here's Luke setting things in order by writing it down Amen in our day it's written down but even better than written down it's been recorded sir and the tape message the tape recordings were instructions from the angel to the prophet to store up the food on tape yeah why is it on the tape so that somebody can hear it again amen so it can be played again so it can be read again and when you read it again it comes alive to you the reader or the hearer amen and we see this through the scriptures and brother brandham has in a number of places about the visions that the lord gave him he would tell them to to write this down in the fly leaf of your Bible he said that about the 300,000 going to be saved in India he said that that was going to come to pass he said write it down in the message be not afraid he says write it in your Bible remember thus sayith the holy spirit this is your last sign write it in your Bible and if something Rises besides this and tell us to turn a corner let me read the quote all right if something Rises besides this and greater than this call me what oh it's it's not up there we'll get it up there we'll get it up there be not afraid it is I 1961 remember thus sayith the holy spirit this is your last sign write it in your Bible brother brand is telling the hearers of this t to write it in your Bible and if something Rises besides this just put it in those quotes write it in your Bible write it in your Bible and if something Rises besides this and greater than this call me a false prophet that's quite a statement yes sir amen I want you all to hear this one or to see this one on the screen we get it all right sometimes our mechanics in the back there they it gets slow with the words we're typing but I wanted to I wanted to write I wanted to put this in in here because we need these quotes for this end time this day okay because there's all kind of things that riseing up and people with authority quote unquote Authority they feel like they can change this and move this and even people who were in The message or in the meetings for years have made a change and a turn thus sayith the holy spirit this is your last sign write it in your Bible and if something Rises besides this and greater than this call me a false prophet that's quite a statement I watch what I say I'm in contact with better than 10 million people around the world see so I have to say that and I know I didn't say that myself okay amen so who's talking here huh we got it up there now y'all wasn't saying amen before now you got to say Amen there it is right there amen paragraph 157 remember thus sayith the holy spirit this is your last sign that's write it in your Bible and if something Rises besides this and greater than this call me a false prophet that's quite a statement I watch what I say I'm me in contact with better than 10 million people around the world see so I have to say that and I know I didn't say that myself now brother R continues in the message thou knowest all things in 1952 he says this here now remember keep that on your mind write it on a piece of paper lay it in your Bible put it on the fly leaf somewhere you'll hear through the magazine brother random had a meeting somewhere in the orients or down in India I believe or Africa somewhere where 300,000 people attended the meeting he doubles down in questions and answers in 1954 and he says this here paragraph 140 he says mark my word write it in your pages of your Bible for it's thus sayeth the Lord remember when we land in India you're going to hear of tens of thousands times thousands being saved the Holy Spirit has said it I've wrote it here in my Bible it's wrote in tens of thousands of Bibles right here like the resurrection of the little boy by the vision that he said there is 300,000 of them in there and you see if that isn't right there is how the gospel is going to be preached just overnight she'll just sweep like that from place to place so here brother Bram is actually in my ising the people quite confidence a lot of confidence there for him to tell people to write these things down in the fly leaf of their Bible to remember them he's admonishing them to do that remember something Rises greater than this or besides this that I'm a false prophet that's thus sayth the Lord he didn't say that of himself now now how's there thing that are there things that have risen up in the past 10 years or 20 years or 30 years there's things rising up all the time we see it all the time and the Temptation would be like the Temptation that Eve had was to get ahead of the word and make something happen because we know it's a promise there's a third pool there's a seven Thunders there's a manifestation of the word there's the Holy Ghost and there's all these things that we want to jump out and get ahead of but you have need of patience after that the word has come to you amen so the purpose of the word of God coming to you is that you read that word and it keeps you stabilized in your life when Israel was brought out of Egypt Through The Exodus and one of the precepts that the lord gave Israel was that when you elect a king and you have a king in your midst one of the things that you'll need to do is to make sure that he keeps a copy of the word written with him at all times and this was in Deuteronomy chapter 17 and verse number 18 can I close on this last Point here Deuteronomy 18 just turn there real quickly Deuteronomy 17: 18 and it shall be now this is the instructions to a King now now Deuteronomy is giving all the laws on what to do and how to do and he's given this this instructions when you elect a king this is how he must continue on in his leadership in his rulership and and and and and it shall and it shall be when you when he sited upon the throne of his kingdom that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites and it shall be with you him and he shall re therein how long all the days of his life why are we going to do that now that he may do What learn to fear the lord his God to keep all the words of this law and these statutes to what do them that his heart be not lifted up above his Brethren so it's going to deal with the pride issue that he turn out a save side from from the Commandment to the right hand or to the left to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom he and his children in the midst of Israel beautiful beautiful look at those Five Points there I think if it's good for a king in Israel I think it's good for a saint at Shalom Tabernacle these are five beautiful points of you getting a copy let me say like this what if you had to write out your own Bible yourself St in Genesis in the beginning God created what if you had to write out your own copy you think it would help you sir huh do you think it would help you then why don't we do it said brother Israel after you you do it and we'll do it but he he the the the the the the point of it is that the king needs to keep a copy of this book with him at all times all the days of his life what is it going to do for a king if he does this if he does this it will teach him how to fear the lord it'll teach him how to respect the Lord with The Godly reverence and respect number one number two it'll teach him how to keep and to do all the words you can't do something that you don't know what to do as you read the word it instructs you on what to do it will deal with his heart not being lifted up so this will keep you humble keep you respectful and in your place that your heart doesn't get lifted up in Pride not when you're staying with the word and it would also keep him from turning aside to the right or to the left it give him that balance in his life and that balance in his ministry and finally it will prolong the days of his life it will keep him stable for many many years God will grant the longevity to him and he will have that longlasting Ministry that everyone should have now that that was the rules for a king and those are the benefits of keeping in it with the King now we see in this last day that that the things that have risen up in this last day and the people that have fallen after them is because they have obviously not kept the word before them theyve they've they've left this word they let it Le from them amen it's the tendency of man can I take one more scripture I'm going to take one more set of scripture and I got one last quote and then I will close amen it who said that some two one two people all I need is two that's a witness three okay I got three Witnesses all y'all are outnumbered I gave you opportunity to speak we just voted he said preach it all right give me just a few more moments Exodus 32 this is Moses Getting ready to leave Deuteronomy 31 sorry this is Moses Getting ready to leave and look at what he says in verses 22 through 30 this is very strong he's talking to Joshua he's getting ready to leave he's going to write a song he's gonna make them learn this song and look at what Moses says Moses therefore wrote this song the same day and taught it to the children of Israel Deuteronomy 31:23 and he gave Joshua the son of nun a charge and he said be strong and of good courage for Thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I swear unto them and I will be with thee and it came to pass when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book until they were finished that Moses commanded the Levites which bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord saying take this book of the law and put it in the sight of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God that it may be therefore a witness against thee for I Know Thy rebellion and thy stiff neck behold while I'm yet alive with you this day you have been rebellious against the Lord how much more after my death gather unto me all the Elders of your tribes your officer that I may speak these words in their ears and I call Heaven and Earth to record against them to to record record against them for I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you and evil will befall you in the latter days because you will do evil in the sight of the Lord to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands and Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the work words of this song until they were ended so Moses is know knows he's leaving he sees what they did to him when he was gone for 40 days now he's leaving the Earth and he says I know that you're going to corrupt yourself I know that's what you're going to do there's no question about it and so we see this this corrupting we see it taking place even today even in our churches to today and our encouragement to you today is to um understand why they forfeited it it's because they it was a lack of patience but we are going to be those that wait upon the Lord but there is a secret that the the bride has the spoken word and she knows what to do with the word now we are not like the Eve that fell before us we are of a different category now because we've been called out and our instructions are to wait on the Lord and there's a prophecy in Souls that are in prison now 1963 yes and paragraph 364 the young sister can pull that up and download it I want to play that I'll read it and then I'll play it for you what this prophecy was at the end of this message Souls that are in prison now but in the spoken word is the Original Seed the prophet of God brings this secret to us that he said here's the secret that the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what's he what he want done with the word and she does it in his name she has thus sayth the Lord then it's gerti so the Holy Spirit Waters it until it's grown and serves its purpose they do only his will I hope I'm talking to those that this quote is talking about I believe that no one can persuade them different they have thus sayeth the Lord or they keep still they don't make up quotes they don't make up things that we need to do now they're not making up a theory of what something may or may not mean they have thus sayeth the Lord or they keep still amen what's this what's thus sayith the Lord It's the word of God if you have the word of God on the subject then say it you have the freedom to say it you don't ask permission for that you say it and you say it with conviction you say it with all of your heart you say it for the rest of your life you say it when it makes friends you say it when it doesn't make friends you just stay with the word that's our that's our commandment that's our protection that's the reality of the believer's life is our protection is staying with the word it looks common it looks humble it looks uninteresting it looks like we heard it before but that is your protection stay with the word so the bride has this secret she knows what to do with the word or she keeps still somebody say praise the Lord praise the Lord I'm going to stay with the word how many witnesses I have here tonight that says I'm going to stay with the word what word the word of the Lord that's been delivered now there's always something coming up in a couple years there'll be something else to come up right and you're going to be wrong in what we're doing today somehow some way brother this this is what we need to be doing you got to go do this now we need to stop what we're doing and do this because the Lord is coming well we already know the Lord's coming we've already been warned of that we live ready we're not waiting for something you know this this what's this supposed to take place in April there's a a great star that's supposed to come and you all know about it the the solar eclipse so we should start praying now right you're supposed to already been praying what the solar eclipse has to do it's already written in the word you know that's a sign that's going to happen it will be or will not whatever it's a sign I'm not downplaying it but we've already been given instructions I'm not going to go to the prayer meeting because somebody said a solar eclipse is going to happen I should have already been going to the prayer meeting so we live ready amen amen we're always preparing I I can let all my stuff go right now how many ready to go right now just just drop it all I don't have to see no grandkids I don't have to see you I would love to see some grandkids but you know if I if it's time for me to go I'm ready to go out of here shake your hand on the other side catch up with you over there I'm I'm gone because that's what my heart is into the coming of the Lord and there's no event coming across the the in the news there's no event coming that's supposed to get us ready outside of his word that he already gave us the word already quickened us to get ready so listen to this prophecy this is in I'll read it for you it giv s a chance to catch it and then play it for you a brother speaks in another tongue paragraph 364 another brother gives an interpretation here's the words of the prophecy my children today I say unto thee yeah even I the almighty God has looked upon the Earth to today I have seen the evil that this creation has been brought to yeah I see the sin that man this day is Welling within yeah Dost thou not know that I have done a great thing for thee yeah I have sent forth a man in this last day yeah that he might be a mouthpiece unto this generation but I say unto thee this day my people many have scoffed at his name that's what we're seeing right now we're actually seeing that right now yeah they have turned their backs upon the things that he has spoke but I say unto thee those that shall hear these words I shall cause great blessings to fall upon them I am the almighty God I shall reward this day for those that shall sincerely receive these words sayith the Lord now we've noticed this great change of believers who are actually raised in the message that are turned their backs against the words of this great prophet we've seen this happen haven't we it's happening more currently now but it's given in a prophecy beforehand let's play that for you as we prepare to close [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] sh my children today I say unto thee yay even I the almighty God have looked upon the Earth today I have seen the evil that this creation has been brought to yeah I see the sin that man this day is wiing with him yeah do thou not know that I have done a great thing for thee yeah I have sent forth aen in this last day y that he might be a mouthpiece unto this generation but I say unto thee this day my people many have scaled his name y they have turned their backs upon the things that he has spoke but I say unto thee those that shall hear these words I shall cause great blessings to all of the for I am the almighty God I shall reward this day for those that shall sincerely receive these words Lord is that beautiful thank the Lord isn't that beautiful who has sincerely receive these words you know the world can do what they whatever they want to do the pastors the teachers the elders they they're gradually slowly they they're trying to get rid of don't say brother Brand's name too many times in a pull pit don't you know those pictures are too much and then you know we got to get you know we just you see these things coming on more and more and then there's a group now they're trying to um they're trying to uh turn their back on his words uh uh the parts that they like they keep the parts that are too harsh seemingly they want to filter the prophet and rechange it and revamp it and and all those things but I'm so glad that God gave me a revelation all right and I'm going to hold that till the end time you know they come they come like brothers are you guys reading the quotes yes and I'm going to continue to read the quotes that's my ministry that's what God gave me I receive it gladly and my life has never been more blessed than when I'm reading God's word there's a blessing that comes with it you take the laws of the Bible and you read that word daily it'll keep you it'll answer all those questions about fearing the Lord knowing how to do them that your heart won't get lifted up in Pride that you won't turn to the left or to the right that he'll keep you in the longevity of your ministry those th those are just simple little tasks brother bam what should we do how how can we get closer to the Lord what he tell us 40-day fast what do he tell us read your Bible and pray when every day so simple but there's power in that don't let anybody downplay the power that's in this word it's beautiful it'll keep your ministry solid and sound it'll keep your family solid and sound you stay with it and many in this prophecy there's others but in this prophecy many will turn aside and that's what they have done but we gladly sincerely receive it humbly and we're blessed because of it great blessings will come upon thee how many are blessed why are you blessed God's word blesses you it's because of his goodness to us God bless you so much let us pray thank you Father for your goodness and mercy to us Lord we thank you for your word this evening we thank you Lord Jesus that you've given us these great truths of the revelation we see that even great men in the Old Testament walked away from Moses they reeled up a golden calf it's unbelievable Lord when I think about it but these were men that were even greater than than than me they were in the Commonwealth of Israel they were born in that elected Gene the elected sea the the elected nation of Hebrews Aaron and these great 70 elders they actually saw you how did did they turn aside I can't put that together Lord and I think that sometimes we get overconfident and we shouldn't Lord but if we keep the word before us it'll cause us that we won't get lifted up in Pride it'll keep us stable that we won't go to the left or to the right hand it'll keep us Lord you'll Grant the days of life that we can serve you Lord it would teach us to fear you [Music] and Lord it will meet every need and every challenge of the enemy I I I

need to go back to the faith oh of my father amen and I preach a message on returning amen how the angel the the prophet of God was going to return us to the Faith of Our Fathers do you believe that so I preach about that and that man he was he said I found the answer am I found the answer for What the Lord Has spoke to my heart he said I never knew about this message and I told him I said how how can this be an equad door when brother galdona run the whole South America preaching this message you know I said I don't I don't understand and he said well the thing is that we are another generation and and it seems to me that the message we are we are taking to our families and our friends but there is another generation rising up on the side of us and they need to hear this truth amen so he was so happy he said oh I found the answer to what the Lord put in my heart he said we need to go back to the Faith of Our Fathers he said so so he's starting to read the book of Acts now
