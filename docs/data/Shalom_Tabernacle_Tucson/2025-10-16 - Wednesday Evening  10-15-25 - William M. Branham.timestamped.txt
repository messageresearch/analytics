[7:10] here?
[7:11] I'm happy to see all of you. So, uh,
[7:14] let's all stand. Brother John, would you
[7:17] come forward and open in service?
[7:28] Let's pray. Lord, we just want to thank
[7:30] you for your goodness, your faithfulness
[7:32] to us, Lord.
[7:34] Lord, just before the service reading in
[7:36] the book of Judges in the first chapter
[7:38] where tribe after tribe after tribe that
[7:41] failed to drive the enemies out of their
[7:44] promised land. And Lord, just thinking
[7:47] how that we have that same test that we
[7:49] go through when we have these enemies
[7:52] that we need to drive out of our lives,
[7:54] demons of pride, of lust, of whatever it
[7:58] may be, Lord. and you just you have them
[8:00] there and you've given us the you you've
[8:03] told us what to put on the whole armor
[8:05] of God. And Lord, we just want to come
[8:07] and just yield ourselves to you this
[8:10] evening. Lord, we just ask that you
[8:12] would just give us strength, Lord, to
[8:14] continue fighting this good fight. We
[8:16] thank you that you promised that you
[8:17] would never leave us, you'd never
[8:18] forsake us. And so Lord, as we continue
[8:21] to drive the enemies that are trying to
[8:24] possess our land out this evening, Lord,
[8:26] we just ask you just to come and
[8:28] minister to us this evening. Give us the
[8:29] strength that we need, Lord, to continue
[8:31] the battle. And we thank you, Lord, that
[8:33] you're in complete control of it. And
[8:35] Lord, we just ask that you would just
[8:37] take complete control of this service
[8:39] tonight. Lord, you know what each of us
[8:42] have need of. And we just ask, Lord,
[8:44] that you would just speak to that need
[8:46] this evening. Whether it's faith, Lord,
[8:49] whether it's it's deliverance from
[8:51] something, Lord, whether it's
[8:53] encouragement,
[8:55] Lord, you're our counselor. You're our
[8:57] healer. You're our savior. You're
[8:59] whatever we have need of this evening.
[9:00] And we just want to yield ourselves to
[9:02] you. We come with expectations tonight,
[9:04] Lord, knowing that you're here. And we
[9:06] just want to ask you to just take
[9:07] complete control of the service. And we
[9:09] commit it in your hands. We ask you in
[9:11] Jesus name. Amen.
[9:14] Amen. Reach over and tell your neighbor,
[9:17] "Welcome to church."
[9:33] [Music]
[9:40] So I believe the book Song of Solomon is
[9:43] the only book that uh I don't know if
[9:45] brother Brandham reads a scripture out
[9:46] of here but there's a chapter Song of
[9:49] Solomon chapter 2 verse 8 goes the voice
[9:53] of my beloved behold he quickly comes
[9:55] sleeping over the mountain skipping upon
[9:58] the hills and it goes down and it says,
[10:00] "My beloved spake and said unto me, rise
[10:02] up, my love, my fair one, and come
[10:04] away." So that's where that song is
[10:07] from. Let's sing. It's manifesting time.
[10:12] Oh, the voice of my beloved.
[10:15] Behold, he quickly comes, sweeping over
[10:19] the mountains, over the hills he runs.
[10:24] Oh, I long to hear his voice.
[10:27] I love you today.
[10:31] Arise love my car and run away.

[11:25] one is coming in with you.

[25:05] Amen. That's a powerful song
[25:08] and it's a powerful theme. The love of
[25:11] God. Amen. Where would we be without his
[25:14] love tonight? I'm so glad for the love
[25:17] of God. Amen.
[25:19] It's powerful and it's strong.

[25:28] It shall endure. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[25:32] Amen.
[25:34] Thank God for his love. Tonight, we're
[25:37] going to listen to a portion of the the
[25:39] the questions and answers. I think
[25:42] there's eight or so of those. And um
[25:45] before we do, let's read in the Psalms,
[25:48] Psalms 27. And we'll read that
[25:52] together as a class.
[25:57] This isn't a particular sermon Brother
[25:59] Brandham is preaching. So we'll take
[26:02] we'll take the Psalms 27.
[26:06] I'll read the first verse and all of you
[26:10] all will read the second verse and we'll
[26:11] just alternate those and we'll read the
[26:13] last verse al together. Amen.
[26:20] When you have that, you can say amen.
[26:22] The word of the Lord. Like to welcome
[26:24] each of you to the house of the Lord
[26:26] tonight. Amen.
[26:28] The Lord is my light and my salvation.
[26:31] Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the
[26:34] strength of my life. Of whom shall I be
[26:37] afraid?
[26:38] &gt;&gt; When the wicked, even my enemies and my
[26:44] flesh, they stumble.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; Though a host should encamp against me,
[26:49] my heart shall not fear. Though war
[26:52] should rise against me, in this will I
[26:54] be confident.
[26:57] Have I desired of the Lord? That what I
[27:00] seek after. I may dwell in the house of
[27:03] the Lord all the days of my life. To
[27:06] revoke the beauty of the Lord to inquire
[27:10] in his temple. For in the time of
[27:12] trouble he shall hide me in his
[27:14] pavilion. In the secret of his
[27:17] tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall
[27:20] set me up upon a rock.
[27:26] my enemies about
[27:32] sacrifices
[27:38] &gt;&gt; here. Oh Lord, when I cry with my voice,
[27:42] have mercy also upon me and answer me.
[27:49] &gt;&gt; My heart unto thee, my face, Lord, what
[27:53] I seek. Hide not thy face far from me.
[27:56] Put not thy servant away in anger. Thou
[27:59] has been my help. Leave me not, neither
[28:02] forsake me, oh God of my salvation.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; My fathers
[28:08] mess
[28:10] up.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; Teach me thy way, O Lord, and lead me in
[28:16] a plain path because of my enemies.
[28:22] of my enemies.
[28:30] &gt;&gt; I had fainted unless I had believed to
[28:33] see the goodness of the Lord in the land
[28:37] of the living. Wait on the Lord. Be of
[28:40] good courage and he shall strengthen
[28:43] thine heart. Wait, I say on the Lord.
[28:48] Amen. That's what we come to do tonight
[28:50] is to wait on the Lord as the Holy
[28:53] Spirit will feed us with his mana from
[28:55] on high. These questions and answers, I
[28:58] think they're are a blessing to us. I
[29:00] didn't get to go through all of these,
[29:02] but I know they'll be a blessing to us.
[29:04] Amen. So, let's sing Only Believe
[29:09] as we uh go to this tape. Only
[29:14] believe,
[29:16] [Music]
[29:18] only
[29:21] [Music]
[29:24] all things are possible.
[29:30] Only
[29:32] we live.
[29:36] Only
[29:38] we
[29:42] only
[29:45] believe
[29:47] that all things are possible
[29:54] only.
[29:56] Let's make a confession and lift our
[29:58] hands and say, "Lord, Lord,
[30:02] I believe."
[30:06] Lord,
[30:08] I believe
[30:12] that all things are possible.
[30:18] Lord I
[30:23] [Music]
[30:24] Lord
[30:26] I believe
[30:32] I believe
[30:35] and all things are possible.
[30:42] Lord, I will.
[30:47] I bless you. You may be seated, Brother
[30:49] Brandham.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, I want to receive the
[30:56] Holy Ghost. I want to know what to do. I
[30:59] am uh burdened for my family to be
[31:03] saved. And a sister signed her name. If
[31:07] you want to receive the Holy Ghost, let
[31:08] me tell you something, my dear sister,
[31:10] if you're here. And um and uh uh brother
[31:14] Neville, was that a member of the church
[31:17] at the bottom?
[31:21] I don't know. I don't I don't remember
[31:24] them either. But if if you're here,
[31:27] sister B O U G
[31:30] If you're here, let me tell you, the
[31:32] Bible said, "Blessed are they that do
[31:35] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[31:37] sake."
[31:38] &gt;&gt; You're so blessed to even want it. See,
[31:41] now remember, not that you you you've
[31:42] got it, but blessed are they that hunger
[31:44] and thirst for it,
[31:47] &gt;&gt; for they shall be
[31:50] &gt;&gt; filled.
[31:51] Stay right with it.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; What must I do for my family? Use the
[31:55] same faith that you're using for
[31:57] yourself, for your family. Commit them
[31:59] to the Lord and believe with all your
[32:00] heart that you're going to be saved. Let
[32:02] don't let this come on your natural
[32:04] thinking here. Let drop way down on the
[32:06] inside that subconscious. Then they're
[32:08] yours. God's given to you when you got
[32:10] it down here. Whatever you have in your
[32:12] heart here and ask for it. When you
[32:14] pray, believe that you receive what you
[32:16] asked for. How you can't doubt it no
[32:18] more. You can't believe it and doubt at
[32:19] the same time.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; How many knows that?
[32:22] &gt;&gt; You can't believe and doubt at the same
[32:24] time. You've got to believe that what
[32:26] you ask for, you receive it. Then he
[32:29] said it would be given to you. So you
[32:30] just believe for your family and they'll
[32:32] get it. Brother Brandon, what about our
[32:35] son? Since
[32:38] since um are not
[32:41] on the not preaching on the trumpets,
[32:44] remember the promise you gave me over
[32:47] the phone concerning him and the seven
[32:50] trumpets.
[32:53] I don't remember it. I don't remember
[32:55] what it was, but whatever it is, you let
[32:57] Billy Paul know what it is. Whatever I
[32:59] promised that I'll do. I don't remember.
[33:01] You know, sometimes I get maybe of a
[33:03] night time answer 30, 40 calls in one
[33:05] time, you see. So I don't remember night
[33:06] after night. Sometimes when I'm around,
[33:08] so I don't get whatever it is. What
[33:11] about my Catholic sister and brother?
[33:14] Thank you.

[33:46] trumpets if I did I'll sing because I

[34:47] and Elijah on earth now. Are Moses and
[34:50] Elijah on earth now? Are they in
[34:52] America? No. See, no. They're not here.
[34:56] They won't be until the church is taken
[34:59] away. Then Moses and Elijah. How many
[35:01] understands that are? Amen.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; And um let's see. They don't have any
[35:06] names signed to this. So, all right. If
[35:08] ever who asks these questions, I believe
[35:10] there's seven of them. I gave Mark
[35:11] seven. All right. Explain the difference
[35:14] between the name of Jesus and the name
[35:18] of Jesus. Wait a minute. Explain the
[35:21] difference between the name Jesus and
[35:24] the name of Jesus.
[35:27] Well, they both be the same if they're
[35:29] applied the same way. You see, applied
[35:31] to the same person. the name Jesus and
[35:33] the name of Jesus. The name of Jesus and
[35:35] the name name Jesus is who he is. The
[35:38] name of Jesus is speaking of the person.
[35:40] So it be the say I think that doesn't
[35:42] that sound sensible? See the name Jesus
[35:44] is the person itself and the name of
[35:46] Jesus is you referring to that person.
[35:47] See say see my name is William. That's
[35:50] me. All right. Now you say I'm speak the
[35:53] name of William then you're referring to
[35:55] me. That's my name. thing now. Has the
[35:58] name of the Lord changed in the
[36:01] different dispensations? Yes. Yes. It
[36:05] was once called, he was called uh the I
[36:08] am. He's called Jehovah. And he's
[36:10] changed many times. The last time it was
[36:12] changed is when God became flesh and
[36:14] took a human name. Jehovah, I am. And
[36:17] all those are titles to a name. See, you
[36:20] just baptize the name of Jehovah, it
[36:22] have to be the name of Jesus Christ. He
[36:24] baptized in the name of Jehovah Rapi,
[36:26] Jehovah Manasses, and Jehovah Gyarai.
[36:28] All those, it had to be Jesus Christ.
[36:30] The I am is Jesus Christ. Remember stand
[36:32] there that day and he said, "You say you
[36:34] eat man in the wilderness. Our fathers
[36:35] eat man that are dead." He said, "And
[36:37] they said, well, we know now you're
[36:38] crazy because you're just a man not over
[36:40] 50 years old and say you seen Abraham."
[36:42] He said, "Before Abraham was, I am."
[36:44] See, he was the I am. And all the titles
[36:48] and names that ever belong to God was
[36:50] made one human name, the Lord Jesus
[36:52] Christ. All right. Now, if time
[36:56] ceases when the seals were open, then if
[37:01] time ceased, pardon me, when the seals
[37:03] were open, then the millennium is also
[37:08] then the millennium is also finished, is
[37:11] it not? No.
[37:13] No. Time didn't cease when the seals
[37:16] were open. Misunderstood it. What
[37:19] happened? the mysteries was revealed,
[37:22] not time ceased. See, just watch real
[37:25] close now and we'll play your tape if
[37:27] you got it from a tape. See, time never
[37:30] ceased until the uh this must be a post
[37:34] millennius or something and ask the
[37:35] question because see, we got a thousand
[37:38] years after the church has gone home and
[37:40] comes back upon the earth. Then time
[37:42] ceases in the new heavens and new earth.
[37:45] Now, the millennium is not the new
[37:47] heavens and new earth. There will still
[37:49] be sin after the millennium.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; The millennium is a type of Noah going
[37:54] in the ark and carried over and brought
[37:56] Ham and them on the other side and sin
[37:58] even come out of the ark.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; See, but Enoch, the translated one, was
[38:04] a type of the bride that went up, not
[38:06] the one that was carried over. So sin
[38:08] will still be on the other side of
[38:09] millennium, but not doing the
[38:11] millennium. See, during millennium is
[38:13] peace. See, but sin will be dealt with
[38:16] the other side of millennium. And then
[38:18] time fades out. And now the opening of
[38:21] the seven seals that was given by the
[38:23] Holy Spirit. The seven seals only was to
[38:26] make known what had been left off in the
[38:30] dispensations behind us. Now as some
[38:33] great theologian tried to corner me on
[38:35] that. He said, "Brother Brandom, you God
[38:39] someday will give you the secret of
[38:41] those seven seals. those seven seals
[38:44] will be something that we've never
[38:46] learned yet that it'll be something
[38:48] that's not even in the Bible. No, no, it
[38:52] won't be that because if you do that
[38:54] would make it a if I told you that I'd
[38:56] be a false prophet because you see this
[38:59] word there everything that's it's the
[39:03] whole revelation of Jesus Christ is all
[39:06] completed in this word.
[39:09] See, and if the seven seals pertain to
[39:12] the seven churches, it had to be already
[39:15] passed because we're in the Lady of Sea
[39:18] church age. And the seven seals was only
[39:21] revealing what they had left off back
[39:23] there and opened up what they had left,
[39:26] what Luther left, what Wesley left, and
[39:28] all the reformers and Pentecostals and
[39:30] down to the present time. Now the next
[39:32] thing left is the translation of the
[39:34] church and return of Moses, Elijah, the
[39:36] millennial marine upon the earth with
[39:38] the bride and groom for a thousand years
[39:41] and then the judgment bar and then a
[39:44] total annihilation of sin. It'll never
[39:47] be no more at that time. Now not the
[39:51] cease of seals never ended time
[39:54] or seasons until after the millennium.
[39:56] No, it'll still be time until after the
[39:59] millennium. Does the millennium have to
[40:01] do with the 1,000 years? Could it not be
[40:05] a generation? No. A generation allotted
[40:09] in the Bible is 40 years. But the Bible
[40:12] said, "And they lived and reigned with
[40:14] Christ 1,000 years." It will be 1,000
[40:20] years upon the earth. Because 1,000
[40:23] years upon the earth is only counted at
[40:26] time for parable like to God is one day.
[40:30] 1,000 years upon the earth is only one
[40:32] day with God as God counting time. How
[40:35] many understands that now? So it's that
[40:37] Sabbath day when the church will no more
[40:40] labor against sin and Satan is bound for
[40:43] a little season a thousand years because
[40:46] his subjects is all in hell and his the
[40:51] church that's on earth is redeemed and
[40:54] right in the presence of Christ.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; So he has nothing he can work on. So
[40:58] it's not a chain as I said a log chain.
[41:00] It's a chain of circumstance. He has
[41:02] nothing he can do. He's helpless and
[41:04] hopeless just waiting for the
[41:06] resurrection of the subjects. Then
[41:09] they're separated as the sheep from the
[41:10] goats. Uh did not the queen of Sheba
[41:13] come to Solomon to test him
[41:17] test him to find out for herself if the
[41:23] if the name of the Lord was truly
[41:26] Solomon or not?
[41:29] Believe I get that this way. Did not the
[41:32] queen of Sheba come to Solomon to test
[41:36] him to find out for herself if the name
[41:41] of the Lord was truly Solomon or not?
[41:47] I don't maybe I don't understand this
[41:49] one. Just excuse me just a minute. Let
[41:51] me read it again. Did not the Queen of
[41:54] Sheba come to Solomon to test him to
[41:58] find out for herself if
[42:02] the name of the Lord was truly Solomon
[42:04] or not.
[42:06] No, she never tested to find out if if
[42:09] God's name was Solomon. Solomon was a
[42:12] king. She come and she said she she said
[42:16] truly God is with his king and with his
[42:19] people. See, she come and was tested.
[42:22] She tested Solomon about his gift
[42:25] because she had things in her heart that
[42:27] Solomon revealed to her that showed that
[42:30] he was God's king up on earth. You
[42:33] remember down in I believe down in in uh
[42:36] in where she come from
[42:39] down in the land of of Sheba where she
[42:43] came from the people to come through you
[42:44] know and and tell about great things
[42:46] that's going on if they had a god up
[42:48] there that was anointed their king and
[42:50] the how the king was uh anointed of God.
[42:53] I don't believe she thought that
[42:54] Solomon's name or God's name was Solomon
[42:58] because if she did that would make her a
[43:01] pagan again.
[43:02] So she she could have did that in her
[43:05] heart. She could have thought that God
[43:07] was Solomon and Solomon was God because
[43:11] she was a heathen to begin with. But
[43:13] when Solomon revealed to her the secret
[43:16] in her heart by a gift of discernment
[43:19] which is called then wisdom. He
[43:22] discerned that she knew that God was
[43:24] with Solomon because then they had she
[43:27] found out if she come with that in her
[43:29] mind if if the person here the
[43:30] questioner is asking did she know then
[43:33] that truly Solomon the name of the Lord
[43:36] was truly Solomon. See Solomon was not
[43:40] the Lord. She had found that out by the
[43:42] people because they worshiped Jehovah.
[43:44] And there was the great ark uh and the
[43:47] great um uh testament the ark at the
[43:51] lord's commandments is in and they told
[43:54] her about on mount si and the different
[43:56] places where they'd been and then she
[43:59] could see that god that god of that
[44:02] testament was in this man because he had
[44:04] he had discernment which only belonged
[44:07] to god. See so she knew that that god
[44:10] was in Solomon. But now it might read
[44:12] that way if the questioner asked that.
[44:14] But did she know that the name of the
[44:16] Lord was truly Solomon? Maybe they
[44:19] didn't write it just the way they're
[44:20] thinking. You see, so I think maybe they
[44:21] see say this that the Lord was in
[44:24] Solomon. Yes. Sure did. Because if
[44:26] that's the question, sure. She knowed
[44:28] God because she made that remark and she
[44:30] wouldn't worship no other god. I believe
[44:33] she she said she'd always she seen what
[44:35] she had no breath left in her. She had
[44:37] no questions left in her. Solomon just
[44:38] revealed the whole thing and she knowed
[44:40] God was with him. We uh we were married
[44:43] 21 years ago by the justice of the
[44:46] peace. Was was it wrong?
[44:50] Yes,
[44:51] it was wrong for you to do that.
[44:53] Marriage belongs in the house of God.
[44:55] But being that you are married, here's
[44:57] when you're really married. You're
[44:59] married when you vow one to the other.
[45:02] When you promise one another that you're
[45:04] that you'll take one another, the
[45:06] justice of peace could give you license.
[45:09] That's legal terms of living together as
[45:12] husband and wife without being common
[45:14] law husband and wife. But when you
[45:15] promise this girl and this you promise
[45:18] that man that you'll live true to him
[45:20] and you take him to be your husband,
[45:22] you're married. Dan, you remember I
[45:24] explained that last week. I believe it
[45:25] was. See, when you promise her, see,
[45:28] even in the o in the old Bible, if a man
[45:31] was betrod to a maid, and you know the
[45:34] laws on that, it was just the same as an
[45:37] adultery. Certainly was. And he promised
[45:39] that was it. The question is asked
[45:40] today, was a anmental
[45:45] ament the same as a divorce?
[45:50] See, when you ask me those questions,
[45:52] friends, you don't know what that does
[45:53] to me. I've got many friends sitting
[45:56] here married two or three times. Did you
[45:58] realize I'm talking to my own son?
[46:01] Billy Paul. But did I spare Billy Paul?
[46:03] No. Indeed he Billy Paul got married to
[46:07] some little girl and come up and said,
[46:08] "Daddy, I'm going to get married." I was
[46:09] washing my car. I said, "But your head
[46:11] against the wall." Just kept on uh
[46:13] washing my car like that. He said, "I'm
[46:14] going to get married." I said, "Oh, go
[46:15] on." Just kept on like that. He goes
[46:17] around tell his mother. And his mother
[46:18] laughed at him. You know what he done?
[46:20] run off with some little kid still in
[46:22] common school and got married. We
[46:24] analled the wedding, the father, the
[46:26] girl, and myself. We annolled the
[46:28] wedding, but he was married just the
[46:30] same. He's my boy. Son, you're listening
[46:32] at me now. That's exactly. He come to me
[46:34] with the girl that he lives with now, my
[46:37] daughter-in-law, my little grandson. He
[46:38] said, "Daddy, will you marry me?" I
[46:39] said, "By no means. That's my own son.
[46:42] You think that don't cut me to the
[46:44] core?" when I packed him in my arms and
[46:46] done everything I could do and I've been
[46:48] both father and mother to him. You think
[46:49] that don't kill me to say that? But it's
[46:51] the truth.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Certainly my boy sitting here listening
[46:56] at my daughter-in-law and my little
[46:57] grandson sitting right here now. But I
[46:59] tell him it's wrong
[47:02] because I've got to I'm duty bound to
[47:04] that word.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; And I say you got married by a
[47:09] magistrate. You should have been married
[47:10] by the church by the minister. That's a
[47:13] decent thing to do for a Christian. But
[47:15] being that you have already made that
[47:17] promise and vow and been married 21
[47:19] years ago, I think it's all right. You
[47:21] say, "Well, I question might be, should
[47:23] I come and be married again?" If you
[47:26] wish to don't have nothing in your mind
[47:28] that bothers your faith because if
[47:29] anything's there, you can't go no
[47:30] further. And right there, you stop right
[47:32] there when that question mark comes.
[47:34] That's where you end right there. But I,
[47:37] for me, it would be all right. The man
[47:40] that baptized me in the name of the Lord
[47:41] Jesus Christ finally run me out of
[47:43] church because I wouldn't agree with him
[47:44] on women preachers. That didn't make me
[47:47] be rebaptized again. See,
[47:52] surely not.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; That's all right. But just remember,
[47:55] these things are cutting to me. I got
[47:58] bosom friends sitting here, men and
[47:59] women that would take their leather,
[48:02] pull eye out, and give it to me. God
[48:04] asked them for it. Yes, sir. And they're
[48:05] married twice, sometimes three times.
[48:08] sitting right here now and my own boy,
[48:11] my own grandson, my grand and my
[48:14] daughter-in-law. I love look at Billy
[48:16] how I stood by him and how he stood by
[48:18] me. But to say truth or truth, it's
[48:20] truth truth.
[48:22] I I could go out here today and call up
[48:24] some of these assemblies of God or some
[48:25] of these people and tell them I I'm was
[48:27] all wrong. I ain't going to stay at that
[48:28] word. I'm going to stay with you. I'd
[48:30] probably be a very popular person pretty
[48:31] soon with the gift of God to throw all
[48:33] my influence to one of those
[48:34] organizations. I'd probably have a big
[48:36] name among them. I ain't care about my
[48:39] name among them.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; I love them. That's the truth. But I got
[48:42] to be truthful. I I I'd be a hypocrite
[48:44] if I did that.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Now, I'd be a hypocrite if I stood here
[48:48] because my own son sitting here that was
[48:50] promised to a girl. I said if he never
[48:52] even had the ceremony set over him. No
[48:54] matter if he ever lived with the woman
[48:55] or slept with the girl or whatever it
[48:57] was when he made that vow, he's married.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Billy Paul or no Billy Paul. That's
[49:03] exactly the truth. He's married. when he
[49:05] made that promise. If it's me, it's the
[49:07] same.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; We've got to be honest.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; If I can't be honest with my boy, I
[49:13] can't be honest with you. If I ain't
[49:15] honest with you, I won't be honest with
[49:16] God.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; And I want you to believe what I tell
[49:20] you to be my honest to goodness opinion.
[49:22] Don't make anything else out of it. Just
[49:24] say it the way I said it. See, I'm going
[49:26] to tell you the truth. I don't talk to
[49:28] y'all like that too often because you're
[49:30] my children. I call you. I've begotten
[49:32] you to Christ through the gospel. And
[49:34] while we're here together, just our own
[49:35] group sitting here, I'll shave you down
[49:38] a little bit. But I want to tell you,
[49:39] when you come to me and ask anything,
[49:41] I'm going to tell you the best that I
[49:43] know how.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; If it's in the word, I don't care if it
[49:46] condemns me. I've got many knots should
[49:48] be shaved off of me. Exactly. But when
[49:51] you ask me anything, I'm going to tell
[49:53] you, if I tell you anything, I'm going
[49:54] to tell you the truth. I've always tried
[49:56] to live that way. That's why I want to
[49:58] live and die that way to be honest with
[50:00] anybody. A little girl come to me not
[50:02] long ago. The woman's not here now. Tom
[50:04] Simpson, many of you know him. Tom is a
[50:06] nice fellow. None of his people are
[50:08] here. I think all the people went back
[50:11] unless Fred's still here. I Fred
[50:13] Soffman, I don't know whether he's here
[50:14] yet or not, but I I think they are. But
[50:17] Tom Simpson, he come down from Canada
[50:19] with with Fred and they, you know,
[50:21] brother Fred, our trustee, and brother
[50:23] Tom, many of you know him here. And
[50:24] Tom's a fine man. He's a dandy guy. So
[50:27] is Mrs. Simpson. She'd only listen to
[50:30] what I tell her. She's going to walk
[50:31] again, too. And she's sitting in that
[50:32] wheelchair crippled up. She's going to
[50:34] walk if she'll just do what was said to.
[50:36] And you just watch and see if that isn't
[50:38] true. See now, but she's got to do what
[50:40] she was told to do if she expects to do
[50:42] it. And one of her little girls, sweet
[50:44] little girls, I one of these little
[50:46] bitty things, I take them up on my lap
[50:47] and play with them. They're too big now.
[50:48] They're almost women, 10, 12 years old.
[50:51] And so one of them come to me said,
[50:52] "Brother Bram, I had a dream." And she
[50:54] told me the dream. And she said, "What
[50:57] does that mean?" I said, "Don't know,
[50:58] honey. I'll pray and if the Lord gives
[51:00] it to me, I'll tell you. She said, "All
[51:02] right." Few days, she come back said,
[51:04] "Got that dream?" I said, "No, honey, I
[51:05] haven't. He hasn't revealed it to me."
[51:07] About a week or two later, she come back
[51:08] and said, "Brother Bram, what about that
[51:10] dream?" I said, "I don't know." Well,
[51:12] looked like she was kind of
[51:13] disappointed. I You remember when you
[51:16] ask me anything to tell you and I don't
[51:17] get it from the Lord, I'm disappointed,
[51:19] too. But I ain't going to be a hypocrite
[51:21] or a liar. I'm gonna tell you the truth.
[51:23] If he tells me, I'll tell you. If you
[51:25] don't, I won't. That's all I can do. And
[51:26] I want you to believe me that way. Amen.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; And now I thought I know what the dream
[51:30] meant in my mind. But how did I know? I
[51:33] have to see the thing over again. And
[51:35] not one of you can lay your finger at
[51:37] any time or any place what I ever told
[51:39] you interpretation of a dream in the
[51:40] name of the Lord. But what was exactly
[51:42] that way?
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Never have I told you anything
[51:44] in the name of the Lord. But what come
[51:46] to pass too? Just that way. Because I'm
[51:48] It's him and that it ain't my
[51:50] responsibility then. It's him. It's his
[51:52] responsibility. I said, 'Look, Trudy,
[51:56] what if we're going to Arizona and what
[51:58] if if I come told you that when you got
[52:01] out there, thus sayeth the Lord, your
[52:03] little brother's go little Johnny, you
[52:04] want to tease about having his belly
[52:06] open all the time? I say, what if he
[52:07] gets run over on the street? And I say,
[52:09] you know what's going to happen? He's
[52:11] going to get run over on the street and
[52:12] you're coming up to me and and you're
[52:14] going to say, uh, Brother Brandham, uh,
[52:16] go take him to brother Brandham,
[52:17] brother. And then you're going to hunt
[52:19] around. You find me standing on the
[52:20] steps talking to a man with a white suit
[52:22] on. And then um I'm just going to lay my
[52:24] hands up on little Johnny. He's going to
[52:26] come to life again. Run along. Now I
[52:28] said, ' Then you go out west and the
[52:30] first thing you know, one day you hear
[52:32] your mother screaming or daddy screaming
[52:33] and look and little Johnny's been run
[52:35] over. What would you do? See, you
[52:37] believe me? Now I want you to have
[52:40] confidence in me. I ain't going to tell
[52:41] you nothing just presumingly. I'm going
[52:43] to tell you the truth or don't tell you
[52:44] nothing. And I said then you come to me
[52:46] and say, "Oh, little Johnny come to your
[52:48] mother. Oh, little Johnny's run over.
[52:50] He's dead. He's dead. The doctor come
[52:51] pull his eyes back. Check his heart's
[52:53] respiration. He's dead. Take him to the
[52:54] mark. What would you do? You say, "Wait
[52:55] just a minute. Wait just a minute. Take
[52:58] him in my arms.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Let's start walking."
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where you going, Trudy? I don't
[53:04] know. What you got? You got your little
[53:06] dead brother in your arms. You keep
[53:08] walking down the street. People say, "Is
[53:09] that girl crazy?" No, sir. She's got
[53:12] thus sayeth the Lord.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; What's going to happen? First thing you
[53:15] know, you say to your father and mother,
[53:16] "Wait, we'll find Brother Brandham.
[53:18] You'll be standing on the steps talking
[53:19] to a man with a white suit on. There he
[53:21] is. Stand right there. Watch what
[53:23] happens. No doubt in your mind. Walk up
[53:26] and say, "Brother Brandom, you know what
[53:27] you told me?" "Yes, Trudy. Johnny, wake
[53:30] up. Jump off and go on down the street."
[53:32] &gt;&gt; But what if I just presumingly tell you
[53:34] some things that I think is right and
[53:37] tell you in that matter, thus sayith the
[53:38] Lord, and it isn't right, and it don't
[53:40] happen. It never comes to pass. Then
[53:43] you'd be scared to death if a little boy
[53:44] wouldn't know where to bring him or not.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; God sent me here to help you. And I want
[53:49] to be a help to you. And no matter if it
[53:51] cuts, hurts, or whatever it is, I got to
[53:53] say it anyhow. But now on the case of
[53:55] marriage and divorce, I've asked you
[53:57] like a brother, hold your peace until
[53:59] you hear from me here. Just go right on
[54:01] as you have live. I'm taking up too much
[54:03] of the time there. We were married 21
[54:05] years ago. Yeah. Justice of the peace.
[54:07] Sister dear, brother dear.
[54:10] One time salesman's tell me he walked
[54:13] into a church as Christian up in
[54:14] Connecticut or somewhere up there. Great
[54:16] big church, just went in to pray. is it
[54:18] wasn't he was a Pentecostal but he went
[54:20] in there to pray and said when he got in
[54:22] there to knelt down the church to pray
[54:23] he says ride along he's tired kind of
[54:25] homesick salesman he's selling stuff and
[54:28] said he from to factories and he went in
[54:31] there to to make some buys or something
[54:33] then he come by the church and thought
[54:34] go pray the doors open said he went in
[54:36] didn't hear nobody so he knelt down
[54:38] started praying after he's praying there
[54:41] said about an hour that directly he
[54:42] heard some door slam or something he
[54:44] thought custodian or something the
[54:45] church said at Holly notice here from he
[54:48] heard somebody talking. He slipped up
[54:50] there to look look around see what it
[54:51] was custodian. It was a man and woman
[54:53] standing before the altar holding one
[54:54] another's hands said I take you dear to
[54:58] be my lawful wedded wife. See she said I
[55:00] take you dear to be my lawful wedded
[55:02] husband. Well he said this is a strange
[55:04] thing said this Pentecostal. He said
[55:06] this man and woman get married without a
[55:08] preacher.
[55:10] And so he just sat down and waited and
[55:11] after they made their vows and live true
[55:13] to one another only death would
[55:14] separate. They put their arms around one
[55:15] another, kissed each other, turn around,
[55:17] walked out smiling. He said, "Just a
[55:19] moment." He said, "Um, I'm kind of
[55:21] curious. I'm a stranger." Said, "You all
[55:23] get married?" Said, "Yes."
[55:26] Without a preacher? He said, "No." I
[55:28] said, "We've been married 40 years." He
[55:30] said, "We got married right here at this
[55:31] altar 40 years ago, and every year we
[55:34] come back and renew our vows."
[55:36] &gt;&gt; That's a good idea.
[55:39] See, but as far as marriage, when you
[55:41] promise her, she takes your word, you
[55:44] take her word, and God takes both your
[55:46] word. See, but just don't promise that
[55:51] when they cut it in is long is long hair
[55:55] when they cut it in front.
[56:00] Huh?
[56:02] Wait a minute. Let me get this. Yeah.
[56:06] Is long hair when they
[56:11] [Music]
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Well, I maybe they mean this. Uh, is it
[56:15] long hair any longer when they cut it in
[56:17] front? Not any longer. They've cut it
[56:19] all. See? But like the man that had the
[56:22] trousers, cut them off three times, is
[56:23] still too short. What say? What? Say,
[56:28] "Oh, that's what they're talking about."
[56:30] As I teased my little girl, she said the
[56:32] booms I call them, you know, bangs or
[56:34] whatever it is, you know, across the
[56:35] front. You're Well, I imagine those kids
[56:38] that's cutting their hair in front, you
[56:41] maybe your mother could tell you about
[56:42] that. See if she wants you to do that
[56:44] way. I think you look kind of kind of a
[56:47] little bit like a woman looking through
[56:48] the rear view mirror. She passed about
[56:50] 25 years old and want to cut them off in
[56:52] front like that. Look like some little
[56:53] kid. Look on out here where you're
[56:55] going, sis, not where you been. See? And
[56:57] now, but cutting the hair, I I I'll tell
[57:00] you this. I can't I I ain't got no no
[57:02] scripture to say you can cut so much of
[57:05] it and can't do the other. I I ain't got
[57:07] no scripture for that. I I couldn't tell
[57:08] you that. Sister or brother, whatever
[57:10] who it is. I say one thing.
[57:13] I wished now I know my kids has done
[57:15] that too. Rebecca and Sarah, I've seen
[57:18] when they cut their hair off here in
[57:20] front and plat it back here in the back
[57:22] and make these things across front like
[57:24] this. I I don't I'm not holding them.
[57:28] See, Noster, to me, I wish they didn't
[57:31] even put a scissors on their hair at
[57:33] all. But when they got all long hanging
[57:35] down like this and just cut the front of
[57:37] it out of their eyes, little kids made I
[57:38] I wouldn't know where that be. I
[57:40] wouldn't think so. See, but when you get
[57:42] if you can I for you sisters, I just let
[57:45] it the way the Lord made it. See, and uh
[57:48] of course I know women wants to look
[57:50] pretty. That's nature. And that's what
[57:54] they should be. See, they should be that
[57:56] way. And so that's fine. But just don't
[57:59] don't otherwise like this don't look
[58:00] like the world. See, don't pattern at
[58:03] the world. Things wrong. You want to cut
[58:04] off like that. But don't cut your hair
[58:06] now. If you got the braids hanging down
[58:08] or or whatever it is in your hair, you
[58:10] leave it long. Don't cut it like it's go
[58:12] look like the world. If you're listen
[58:14] them little girls, my uncle used to have
[58:16] a little girl up there in New York. She
[58:18] had the prettiest hair. It's kind of
[58:20] dark brown. And she her plants. My
[58:22] mother used to be able to her plats hit
[58:24] down here in the back of her knees. And
[58:27] this little girl had plats like that,
[58:28] too. Her name was Jacqueline. And she
[58:30] had comb part of it down like this and
[58:32] cut it off like this. And I been about
[58:34] 15, 18, 20 years ago. I used to wonder
[58:37] why did she just comb the whole thing
[58:38] back? It looked prettier. And having
[58:40] this like off here like these modern
[58:42] beetles they have nowadays, you know.
[58:44] And
[58:46] oh, I don't believe I'll do it. Anything
[58:48] look like them Beatles that looks like
[58:50] out of the world.
[58:51] Let just leave that alone. Yeah. My
[58:55] husband and I don't uh see a light on
[58:59] the Bible uh the truth like this truth
[59:04] that you preach. He doesn't understand.
[59:08] Should I go with him to churches when I
[59:12] don't believe their teaching? I'm very
[59:15] troubled about this.
[59:18] Yes. If you are a wife to this husband
[59:22] and he don't condemn you, you don't you
[59:25] mustn't condemn him. See, because the
[59:28] husband is sanctified by the wife. See,
[59:30] and I believe if he goes to some
[59:32] denominational church or something like
[59:33] that, he won't you go down there with
[59:35] him. See, if you don't be, you see,
[59:38] there's nothing there can harm you
[59:39] because you're not going to listen to
[59:40] what they're saying anyhow because you
[59:41] done said you you don't believe they're
[59:42] preaching. See, so it ain't going to
[59:44] harm you, but you're just showing
[59:45] respect to your husband. You're yielding
[59:48] yourself to him. And maybe in doing so,
[59:50] you you'll if they teach and do the
[59:53] things down there, you're taught much
[59:55] higher things than that, you'll be
[59:57] salty. He'll see and come to the Lord. I
[59:59] believe I would go ahead. My goodness.
[1:00:02] Look at what time it is. Um,
[1:00:05] does uh Zechariah 4 and Revelations
[1:00:09] 11:3-12
[1:00:11] speak of the same being? See Zechariah 4
[1:00:17] 12-14 and Revelations 11:4. Uh they
[1:00:21] signed their name to it, brother and
[1:00:23] sister of the church. Let's see.
[1:00:25] Zechariah 4. Oh yeah, that's the two
[1:00:28] olive trees. Yeah, the two olive trees
[1:00:30] and Revelations 11. Yeah, that's it.
[1:00:32] Same thing. That's them both. That
[1:00:35] That's is Moses and Elijah. The two
[1:00:38] olive trees. Uh pray for our That's a
[1:00:41] prayer request.
[1:00:46] Uh, I'm sorry. This I can't read it
[1:00:49] before. It's about uh family
[1:00:51] relationships. Yeah, that's more there.
[1:00:53] I can't read that to the public. They're
[1:00:55] on private interview anyhow. So, brother
[1:00:58] Brandon, is it wrong to
[1:01:06] [Applause]
[1:01:10] Sunday?
[1:01:12] work.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Is it wrong to work on Sunday? I just
[1:01:16] explained that if the ox is in the
[1:01:18] ditch, take him out, but don't push him
[1:01:20] in the ditch just to get him out on
[1:01:21] Sunday.
[1:01:23] Brother Brandham, will you preach Eric
[1:01:25] next Sunday? That's just a question. No,
[1:01:27] sister, brother, whatever who it is. Uh,
[1:01:29] these are some this was laying out here
[1:01:31] must laid them or somebody put them in
[1:01:33] the package. Uh, brother,
[1:01:38] this is to you, brother Captain. when
[1:01:40] you sing or never grow old.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; I must have got in there. I got some of
[1:01:44] the rest of mixed up. Brother Brandon,
[1:01:46] um, someone wants to know why you were
[1:01:50] not, uh, I mean, mentioned in the Bible.
[1:01:56] I believe you are. Haba 214. Get that,
[1:02:00] brother. Habca 21:4. Let them read this
[1:02:05] and study it. Third
[1:02:09] chapter think name and types of four
[1:02:14] chapters
[1:02:16] uh believe I believe is you
[1:02:19] uh while he's hunting it's Albeca uh 2
[1:02:23] 1:4 uh uh brother or sister every ask
[1:02:28] the questions no name that's fine I like
[1:02:30] to ask those things I know what's on
[1:02:31] your heart see and then I tell you no
[1:02:35] see you wouldn't have necessarily have
[1:02:37] your name in the Bible. See, but you
[1:02:40] see, as long as you're in the Bible
[1:02:42] there, as long as you're in Christ, you
[1:02:45] are in the Bible, you're in him. You
[1:02:47] see, in the Bible, see, as long as you
[1:02:49] are in Christ, then you are in the
[1:02:52] fullness of the Bible. See, you are in
[1:02:54] your full position when you're in
[1:02:56] Christ. All understand that. Um, do you
[1:02:58] have it, brother Neville? What?
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Uh, Habbeca,
[1:03:03] I haven't read it. This is just put in
[1:03:04] here, I guess, this morning. uh to Habca
[1:03:06] 2 1-4.
[1:03:09] Let's see it.
[1:03:12] Habca 2. Haba 2 and um 1:4. I will stand
[1:03:17] up on the watch and set me up on the
[1:03:19] tower and will watch and see what he
[1:03:21] will say unto me and what I shall answer
[1:03:24] I I am when I am reproved. And the Lord
[1:03:27] answered me and said, "Write the vision
[1:03:29] and make it plain upon tables that he
[1:03:33] may run that readeth it. For the vision
[1:03:35] is yet for an appointed time, but at the
[1:03:38] end it shall speak and not lie. Though
[1:03:40] it tar, wait for it, because I will
[1:03:43] surely come, and I will not tarry.
[1:03:45] Behold, his soul which is lifted up is
[1:03:49] not upright in him, but the just shall
[1:03:52] live by his faith. Well, now
[1:03:56] uh I'd imagine this dear person that
[1:03:58] asked this. You see, it's somebody that
[1:04:00] loves me or they wouldn't write that.
[1:04:03] See now I could not say my the Bible
[1:04:06] doesn't call my my name William Brandham
[1:04:08] or call your name whoever it is but we
[1:04:11] are in him anyhow and these now you see
[1:04:14] familiar places that refer to in the
[1:04:18] Bible it says certain things see now if
[1:04:20] you'll watch history repeats itself in
[1:04:22] the Bible see now let's just give you a
[1:04:24] scripture for one now I see many of you
[1:04:26] writing it down now in the third chapter
[1:04:28] of St. Matthew it said and when God
[1:04:32] called his son out of Egypt that it
[1:04:34] might be fulfilled which is spoken out
[1:04:36] of Egypt I call my son. Now if you got a
[1:04:39] a Scoffield or any other reference Bible
[1:04:41] if you follow that reference there that
[1:04:43] margin reading it'll bring you back to
[1:04:45] where he called Jacob Israel out of
[1:04:48] Egypt. See but Jacob was his son that he
[1:04:52] called out of Egypt. Also Jesus was his
[1:04:55] son that he called out of Egypt. So see
[1:04:58] the word of God is never ending. See we
[1:05:00] identify ourselves in the Bible with
[1:05:02] different How many remembers my message
[1:05:04] on identifying yourself with Christian
[1:05:06] characters? Phoenix, Arizona, where
[1:05:08] preaching. Yeah, many of us got on the
[1:05:09] tape. See, identify with Christian
[1:05:11] character. See, you can identify
[1:05:13] yourself anywhere you want to in that
[1:05:15] scripture if you are a Christian. And if
[1:05:17] you're not a Christian, you can identify
[1:05:18] yourself in the Bible. See, so I think
[1:05:21] maybe that would help. I want to get as
[1:05:23] many of these as can. Brother Bram, some
[1:05:25] say mercy is over and no one can be
[1:05:30] saved. Now, is this true? I'm glad I got
[1:05:33] this one. We watch and pray. We watch
[1:05:37] the prayer lines and it seems some are
[1:05:41] still
[1:05:43] uh finding mercy. Now, that's the first
[1:05:47] question. You got two. Is mercy over?
[1:05:50] Don't never think that.
[1:05:53] Just keep right on doing everything you
[1:05:55] can until you're taken away. See, we
[1:05:58] notice in a prayer line somes finds
[1:06:00] mercy. Sure, mercy's the doors are open.
[1:06:04] See, I think where you got this uh this
[1:06:07] thought might lay between See, I don't
[1:06:09] have time to give each one of these
[1:06:10] scriptures a right place. You see, each
[1:06:12] one of these things their right place.
[1:06:14] The in the prayer line, you find mercy.
[1:06:17] Certainly, if I know Jesus is coming
[1:06:20] this afternoon, I'd be doing just the
[1:06:22] thing I'm doing right now. Okay? Just
[1:06:24] continuing right on. Mercy is always
[1:06:26] open. See, and now where I think you get
[1:06:28] it is about the finishing of the seven
[1:06:31] church ages and the seven seals being
[1:06:34] loosed. See, the seven seals, it's
[1:06:37] manifested. What takes place, how, what
[1:06:40] has took place. The seventh church age,
[1:06:42] we're the end of the seventh church age.
[1:06:44] When I say the end, that doesn't mean
[1:06:47] it's this very hour, this very minute.
[1:06:49] You remember the Bible said back in the
[1:06:52] times of of the Lord Jesus, Paul said,
[1:06:54] "For the time is at hand."
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Do you realize how long that was in
[1:07:00] God's time? That was yesterday.
[1:07:03] My time has been 2,000 years. See, the
[1:07:07] time is at hand. See, what God calls at
[1:07:11] hand is not what we call at hand. See,
[1:07:13] so just keep on believing, keep on
[1:07:15] praying, keep on uh God's still got
[1:07:18] mercy open. Just keep blowing into it as
[1:07:20] fast as you can. God will do the stop
[1:07:22] and when it's time to stop. See,
[1:07:38] we thank God for his word tonight
[1:07:40] and few prayer requests that we want to
[1:07:43] go to the Lord in prayer for brother
[1:07:46] Bobby and works, sister Jennifer and the
[1:07:51] family, Mr. uh Barbara King is there in
[1:07:56] Minnesota with her brother, brother
[1:07:58] Bobby, and we want to keep the entire
[1:08:01] family in prayer. Brother Arch's
[1:08:04] grandmother Ernestine
[1:08:07] Parker
[1:08:09] has a special need. Um
[1:08:14] I think it was a
[1:08:17] a health concern there. the Lord would
[1:08:20] touch her. And then also his cousin's
[1:08:23] funeral is this Saturday. Um young the
[1:08:27] father that was killed by his two boys

[1:08:36] be going there for that. We'll be doing
[1:08:39] that funeral for the family. Um it turns

[1:08:45] Brother John Martin is recovering. He
[1:08:48] had surgery on his arm or shoulder and
[1:08:51] his hip with that accident, but he's
[1:08:54] doing pretty stable.
