[20:31] survivors still standing from the
[20:33] meetings God bless each of you so happy
[20:36] to be in the house of the Lord with you
[20:37] tonight we're going to listen to a
[20:40] portion of the message the rejected King
[20:43] in this message brother brandom I
[20:45] believe it's the first time that he's
[20:47] giving his testimony of going beyond the
[20:50] curtain of time and he's dealing with
[20:53] that and so that really kind of capped
[20:56] our meetings off at the end there
[20:59] um brother petley spoke on God being
[21:02] rich in Mercy but God and our dear
[21:05] brother durksen did a wonderful job on
[21:09] spiritual
[21:10] idolatry brother Ferguson brought on how
[21:13] the Revelation that we receive it's
[21:16] something that's already
[21:18] revealed but then we get a revelation of
[21:21] that God promises and then God fulfills
[21:24] it on Saturday night and Sunday morning
[21:28] the the new creation of God in us and I
[21:31] was really blessed all of the word
[21:32] really blessed me and then Sunday night
[21:35] what manner of love is this as brother
[21:37] Bill lingard brought that to us and that
[21:40] little portion of perfect love and
[21:44] entering over there and that's really
[21:46] our goal and our achievement in our life
[21:50] and we really want to focus in on that
[21:52] and this was a real experience and so
[21:55] because of this experience we as
[21:57] Believers we can't preach a funeral like
[22:00] the rest of the world we know what
[22:03] happens when a Believer dies we know
[22:06] there's a holding place there's a place
[22:09] that's called beyond the curtain of time
[22:11] and brother Randon went there and I
[22:12] believe he did and he's given the
[22:14] testimony of that tonight how many look
[22:16] forward to that we've heard it before
[22:18] we're going to hear it again so God
[22:20] bless you as we prepare to go there he's
[22:22] going to be taking his scripture out of
[22:25] Samuel chapter
[22:26] 8 and uh I believe it's is verse number
[22:29] 18 for those of you that like to follow
[22:32] along and take those notes and as we
[22:35] prepare to go there
[22:37] paragraph 39 through paragraph 171 just
[22:41] about an hour or so of teaching and then
[22:44] he goes into that experience only
[22:46] believe only
[22:49] believe
[22:50] only
[22:54] believe
[22:56] only believe
[23:00] that all things are
[23:05] [Music]
[23:07] possible

[24:10] possible amen I be amen let's remain
[24:16] standing as soon as the scripture is
[24:18] read then you can be seated God bless
[24:20] you brother
[24:22] Brandon I
[24:26] have for the glory of the
[24:32] Lord now have you got your Bible for the
[24:34] reading eth chapter
[24:38] of Samuel and I promised Jean to stay
[24:41] back there to record the rest of this we
[24:43] were just beginning to in our
[24:47] meeting nevertheless the people refus to
[24:51] obey the voice of
[24:53] Samuel and they said nay
[24:58] but we will have a king over
[25:02] us that we
[25:04] may be like the nation All
[25:09] Nations and that our King May judge us
[25:14] and go out before us and fight our
[25:18] battles Samuel heard all these
[25:21] words of the people and rehearse them in
[25:25] the ears of the Lord and the Lord said
[25:28] to Samuel hearken into their voice and
[25:31] make them a king and Samuel said unto
[25:35] the man of Israel go ye every man to his
[25:40] City now if I should try to choose from
[25:45] this this
[25:47] morning what I would call a text for the
[25:52] next few
[25:54] minutes I would like to choose the text
[25:57] of the the rejected
[26:03] King it was a time that is in all times
[26:07] that people
[26:10] has never wanted God to lead
[26:15] them they want their own way of
[26:20] leadership and this story this morning
[26:24] and when you go to your home it would be
[26:26] good for you to read it all the way
[26:28] through
[26:31] through it was during the time of
[26:34] the the days of Samuel the man of God
[26:39] the
[26:40] prophet and he had been a just man and a
[26:44] good man honorable
[26:48] reputable true and honest with the
[26:50] people never deceiving them and telling
[26:53] them nothing but straight thus saith the
[26:57] Lord
[27:01] but the people had come to a place where
[27:04] they wanted to change this
[27:09] program they had looked upon the
[27:12] Philistines and the
[27:16] amalekites
[27:18] Amorite haites and the other nations of
[27:22] the world and they had seen that they
[27:26] had kings that rule them and govern them
[27:30] and guided them and fought their battles
[27:35] and so
[27:37] forth and this seemed to be that Israel
[27:42] wanted to pattern themselves like these
[27:46] Kings like these
[27:50] people but it has never been in any age
[27:54] God's intention for his people to act
[27:57] like the people of the world or to be
[28:02] governed or controlled like the people
[28:06] of the
[28:08] world God's people is always has
[28:14] been uh A peculiar people a different
[28:20] people a called out are
[28:24] separated are allog together different
[28:27] in their act action in their ways in
[28:30] their manner of
[28:32] living than what the peoples of the
[28:35] world has their appetites for
[28:39] things and all that their makeup is has
[28:43] been always contrary to the things that
[28:47] the people of the world
[28:51] desire and the people of Israel came to
[28:56] Samuel and said now you're getting
[28:59] old and your sons do not walk in your
[29:03] way because they wasn't true like Samuel
[29:07] they were briers and takers of
[29:11] money and they said Samuel your boys is
[29:15] not like you so we want you to go out
[29:19] and to find us a king and anoint him and
[29:24] make us a people like the rest of the
[29:28] the peoples of the
[29:31] world and Samuel tried to tell them that
[29:35] that would not
[29:37] work he said if you do that the first
[29:40] thing you know you'll find that he'll
[29:43] call all your sons from your
[29:46] home and make soldiers out of them to
[29:51] run before his Chariot and bear armors
[29:54] and
[29:55] Spears not only that but he'll call your
[29:58] daughters to make Bakers of bread and
[30:01] take them away from you to feed the
[30:05] Army and said besides all that he'll
[30:08] take a certain taxes off of you of your
[30:11] grain and all your income he'll tax all
[30:15] of that to make certain government uh uh
[30:20] debts and so forth it'll have to be
[30:24] paid he said I think you are all to
[30:28] together making a
[30:31] mistake but when the people said but we
[30:36] still want to be like the rest of the
[30:41] people there's something about man and
[30:45] women that they long to be like one
[30:50] another and there has only been one man
[30:53] ever lived on Earth that was our example
[30:58] and that was the one that died for us
[31:01] all our Lord and Savior Jesus
[31:06] Christ he was a perfect example of what
[31:10] we should be always about the father's
[31:13] business and doing that which is
[31:16] right and no matter how much that Samuel
[31:20] tried to persuade the people
[31:23] continually they went after him day and
[31:27] night
[31:28] we want a
[31:31] king we want a man we want a man that we
[31:35] can say this is our
[31:39] guide and that has never been the will
[31:43] of God it never was the will of God or
[31:48] never will be the will of God for man to
[31:52] rule over one another amen God rules
[31:57] over men
[31:58] man God is our ruler our
[32:04] King and it's a
[32:06] very very much of a Peril of today
[32:12] because that man seems to have that same
[32:16] idea they don't seem to be able to grasp
[32:21] that God still rules man instead of man
[32:25] ruling man
[32:29] so they chose themselves a man named
[32:32] Saul which was the son of
[32:36] Kish and he was a reputable man an
[32:39] honorable
[32:41] man but he suited the people just
[32:46] right because he was a great tall
[32:52] Noble statue of a
[32:55] man the scripture said he was Head and
[32:58] Shoulders above any man in
[33:01] Israel he was kingly looking and he was
[33:06] handsome in the
[33:08] face he was a brilliant and an
[33:12] extraordinary
[33:14] man now that's the kind of man that the
[33:20] people like to choose
[33:23] today the people does not seem to be
[33:29] satisfied with the way that God placed
[33:33] his church to be governed and controlled
[33:36] by the Holy
[33:39] Spirit they want somebody some man some
[33:44] denomination some certain peoples to
[33:48] govern the church that they're not able
[33:51] to throw themselves completely into
[33:55] God's hand to be spiritual to be led by
[34:00] the Holy
[34:01] Spirit they want somebody to do their
[34:04] religion for
[34:06] them somebody that will tell them just
[34:09] how to do it and all about
[34:11] it so this man seemed to suit the place
[34:16] exactly because he was a very
[34:19] intellectual
[34:21] man and it's a whole lot like
[34:25] today we like to choose such people to
[34:28] to control our
[34:30] churches to control the Church of
[34:33] God nothing that I have to say against
[34:36] it but just merely to make a point that
[34:40] it is not it was not and it will never
[34:45] be the will of God for such to
[34:49] be God is the rule his people to govern
[34:54] each individual amen
[34:57] then we find that this son of Kish great
[35:02] man
[35:03] and and his statue and his he seen the
[35:07] suit of people that his robe up on him
[35:11] would look great and the crown on his
[35:14] head weighing above all the other people
[35:17] as he walked would be a a real asset to
[35:21] the Kingdom of Israel for the other
[35:25] kings with of the other ations would
[35:28] think look what a man how they could
[35:32] Point their finger and say looky here
[35:35] what a great king we got look what a
[35:39] great man that's over
[35:42] us I'm sad to say but how true it is
[35:47] today with the church yes
[35:51] yes they love to say our pastor is not a
[35:56] narrow-minded man
[35:59] he is a great
[36:01] man he is a graduat from Hartford or
[36:07] some great School of
[36:10] Theology he has four degrees out of so
[36:13] and such a
[36:15] place and he's a very good mixture
[36:19] amongst the
[36:20] people all that may be all right and
[36:25] have its place but God's way for his
[36:28] church is to be led by the Holy Ghost
[36:32] and by his
[36:35] [Music]
[36:37] Spirit but they like to say that we have
[36:42] this great denomination that we belong
[36:45] to we have started back in the early
[36:48] pioneer days when we were in the
[36:51] minority just the very few people and
[36:55] small and now we have grown until a
[36:58] place that we are among the largest
[37:01] denominations there
[37:03] is we have the best schools and the best
[37:07] educated
[37:10] ministers we have the best dressed
[37:12] crowds and the most intellectual people
[37:15] of the city attends our
[37:19] denomination and we give to charity and
[37:22] we do good deeds and all such and
[37:25] nothing at all God forbid that I should
[37:29] speak one word against that for that is
[37:33] all good but still it isn't the will of
[37:37] God that man should rule over man God
[37:41] sent on the day of Pentecost the Holy
[37:45] Ghost to rule in man's hearts and rule
[37:48] in his life our
[37:51] God it was not meant for man to rule
[37:54] over man oh Hallelujah but we love to
[37:58] say that it's a very outstanding thing
[38:02] when we can say we belong to such a
[38:04] great organization are you a
[38:07] Christian that's how I fell upon this
[38:10] text when I was at the
[38:12] hospital and I would ask one are you a
[38:15] Christian I belong to such and such are
[38:19] you a Christian I belong to such and
[38:23] such and a little nurse came into the
[38:26] bedside
[38:28] where I was reading the Bible and she
[38:30] was a a new nurse on the floor and she
[38:34] said how do you do she said I believe
[38:36] that you're reverent Brandon here for a
[38:38] a physical checkup I said I
[38:41] am and she said may I rub your back uh
[38:45] uh make you feel a little better with
[38:47] the
[38:48] alcohol and I said you may do it and
[38:52] while she was rubbing on my back she
[38:54] said uh what denomination of church do
[38:57] you belong to and I said oh I belong to
[39:01] the oldest denomination that there is
[39:05] and she said what denomination is that I
[39:08] said it's the one that was organized
[39:10] before the world was ever
[39:13] organized amen oh she said what I don't
[39:16] believe I know just that she said I
[39:19] belong to a certain church is it that
[39:21] organization I said no ma'am that was
[39:24] only about 200 years ago that
[39:26] organization ation but this organization
[39:30] started when the morning Stars sang
[39:33] together and the sons of God shouted for
[39:37] joyl when they seen the coming of a
[39:40] savior to redeem
[39:42] mankind prise
[39:44] God and she just stopped rubbing my back
[39:48] and I was stooped a little over this way
[39:50] so the lady could rub and she was from
[39:53] near Cardon down here and we got to
[39:56] talking and she he said sir I've always
[40:01] believed that if God ever was God he
[40:05] still God today just like he was in the
[40:08] old
[40:09] days she said though my church flatly
[40:13] denies that but I believe that it is the
[40:16] truth amen and I said you're not far
[40:20] from the kingdom of God young woman
[40:24] Hallelujah she said if he ever was a
[40:27] healer isn't he still a Healer I said
[40:30] he's most certainly is my
[40:34] sister but man Wants to Rule and Rule
[40:39] over man and man wants man to rule over
[40:42] him yes he doesn't want to have God to
[40:48] rule so this son of Kish saw by name was
[40:53] just the answer to what they had wanted
[40:57] the great stately man and the all he
[41:01] could just lead them to their battles
[41:04] and so forth but still it wasn't God's
[41:08] way of doing things amen God wanted his
[41:12] faithful old Prophet to direct them and
[41:15] speak his words to
[41:18] them now today in our great church age
[41:22] that we live
[41:24] in we are think and believe this was
[41:27] with all my heart that we have exactly
[41:30] gone vice versa from what God ordained
[41:34] us to
[41:36] do the last words of our savior was in
[41:40] Mark 16 said go ye into all the world
[41:43] and preach the gospel to Every Creature
[41:46] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[41:49] be saved he that believeth not shall be
[41:53] damned and these signs shall follow them
[41:58] that believe praise our God in my name
[42:01] they shall cast out
[42:03] Devils they shall speak with the new
[42:06] tongue and if they should take up
[42:09] serpents or drink deadly things that
[42:11] would not harm them and if they lay
[42:14] their hands on the sick they shall
[42:18] recover amen there is not a man
[42:22] Hallelujah there's no son of Kish or no
[42:24] one else can produce that outside of the
[42:28] leadership of the Holy
[42:32] Spirit but we have made
[42:35] schools we have made
[42:38] seminaries and made organizations to to
[42:42] satisfy and to look like the rest of the
[42:47] world now the Holy Spirit used to be the
[42:51] leader in this
[42:53] nation this nation used to be governed
[42:57] when back in when they wrote up the
[43:00] Declaration of Independence yes and
[43:04] there was an ex Street chair sitting
[43:07] there there is not one Speck of doubt in
[43:12] my mind but what the Son of God said at
[43:16] that table amen when this nation was
[43:20] founded upon the principles of freedom
[43:24] of religion and freedom to all
[43:27] and upon the basis of God's Eternal Word
[43:32] yes
[43:33] amen but we have corrupted
[43:37] that politics we have voted men in there
[43:41] under buying and selling and Promises of
[43:45] falsehood until our nation and our
[43:49] politics and our democracy is so
[43:52] polluted until it's it's interwoven with
[43:56] Communism and all kinds of
[44:00] isms and many times we call into the
[44:05] sessions for prayer when leagues of
[44:08] Nations meet and there are to have
[44:12] discussions and in one certain great
[44:15] time
[44:17] recently there was not even one time
[44:21] call for
[44:24] prayer how are we ever going to set
[44:27] differences without
[44:30] prayer how can we ever expect in all the
[44:34] world to ever do anything without the
[44:37] leadership of the holy spirit
[44:41] amen but let me say this with love and
[44:49] respect to our nation and to its flag
[44:53] and to the Republic for which it stands
[44:57] we have rejected our leader the Holy
[45:01] Spirit and through corrupt politics have
[45:04] brought in Mana perverse
[45:07] mind and if you don't watch they're
[45:10] going to make one of the most fatal
[45:12] mistakes they've ever made right now
[45:16] yes is because that the people are
[45:21] Desiring man to rule yes what we need in
[45:26] the Capal love this United States as a
[45:30] president what we need in
[45:33] Congress what we need in our Halls of
[45:36] justice is men who have consecrated
[45:40] their lives to God and are filled with
[45:43] the Holy Ghost and are led by his Divine
[45:50] Direction but instead of
[45:53] that we choose man of intellectual
[45:58] man who have forms of godliness and deny
[46:02] the power of
[46:04] God man who are atheist and sometimes
[46:08] even worse than that yes we brought into
[46:12] our political rims of our
[46:17] nation not only that but in our churches
[46:22] yes our churches have become corrupt
[46:26] upon the B is that we in choosing our
[46:29] Shepherds to lead
[46:31] us we have gone to the
[46:36] seminaries and have selected man that's
[46:40] great intellectual
[46:43] Giants man who are very brilliant in
[46:48] mind man who has
[46:51] scholarships and our great mixers
[46:54] amongst the people and our great man in
[46:57] the neighborhood which I have nothing to
[47:00] say
[47:02] against man you are kind in their ways
[47:05] of walk careful in their ways of life
[47:09] and how they conduct themselves among
[47:11] other men and among people great man in
[47:15] their
[47:17] fields which I do not speak evil of God
[47:21] forbid that my spirit would ever be that
[47:24] evil but still that isn't what God chose
[47:29] for us it's the leadership of the Holy
[47:34] Spirit Christ in the heart of
[47:37] man many of those intellectual men that
[47:41] stands in our poopet deny the real
[47:44] existence of the Holy
[47:48] Ghost many of them deny the existence of
[47:52] Divine Healing yeah and the power of the
[47:55] spirit my God
[47:57] I was reading an article yesterday I
[48:00] believe it
[48:01] was a series of newspaper clippings
[48:06] from Jack Cole the late Jack Cole of one
[48:10] of my converts to the Lord
[48:13] Jesus who was a mighty man of veiler in
[48:17] his
[48:18] day and was called to
[48:23] question down in Florida because of
[48:26] asking a young child to remove its
[48:29] braces from its legs and to walk across
[48:32] the
[48:34] platform and upon doing so the child
[48:37] walked across the platform normally and
[48:40] fell when it got to its
[48:42] mother all being a setup of the enemy of
[48:49] Christ this young woman and her husband
[48:53] brought our Gallant brother into the
[48:56] courts of the
[48:59] land and when every Church arst stood by
[49:04] Brother
[49:06] Jack whenever Church man that mentions
[49:10] the name of Jesus Christ should have
[49:13] stood by his side
[49:16] gallantly every man that calls on the
[49:19] name of the Lord Jesus should have fell
[49:21] to their knees in prayer
[49:23] yes but instead of that
[49:27] across the headlines of the
[49:30] papers one of our great
[49:33] denominations said they join hands with
[49:36] the atheist to condemn and prison
[49:38] brother Jack
[49:42] Cole could you
[49:45] imagine a
[49:48] church calling themselves the name of
[49:52] Christ would jarn hands with an atheist
[49:58] to condemn a godly
[50:02] man who was trying with all his heart to
[50:05] stand for the
[50:08] Bible but they did
[50:11] it and then brother Garden
[50:15] Lindsay was at the rescue and when the
[50:19] unbelieving judge
[50:22] said this man is a fraud because he
[50:25] taken the braces from that child and
[50:28] sent him across the platform and said he
[50:31] was
[50:33] healed and the lied and he did something
[50:37] contrary to the doctor's orders
[50:40] therefore he has a defraud case against
[50:45] him and Mr Cole raised up and he said
[50:49] Sarah I defy that
[50:54] statement God healed the
[50:59] boy and the judge
[51:02] said I will ask any man in this
[51:06] court if that statement could be true
[51:08] that God could heal that boy on one end
[51:11] out the platform and let him be sick on
[51:13] the other end if that statement can be
[51:16] proved by the Bible then I say Mr Cole
[51:18] has a right for his
[51:20] statement and AD Minister raised his
[51:23] hand and he said your honor sir may I
[51:25] state it
[51:27] and the judge said stayed
[51:30] on and the minister stood to his feet
[51:33] and said one night on a rocking
[51:37] sea when a little ship was about to go
[51:41] to the
[51:43] bottom all hopes of being saved was
[51:48] gone they saw Jesus the son of God come
[51:53] walking on water
[51:56] and one of the Apostles by the name of
[51:59] Peter said if that be you Lord bid me
[52:03] come to you on the
[52:05] water and he said the Lord said to the
[52:09] Apostle Peter come
[52:11] on and he stepped out of the boat
[52:15] sir walking just as good as Jesus was
[52:20] walking on the water but when he got
[52:23] scared he begin to sink before he got to
[52:26] Jesus
[52:28] the judge said the case is
[52:31] dismissed
[52:34] amen we need Holy Spirit
[52:39] leadership amen not intellectual
[52:47] man Saul the son of Kish was then made
[52:53] Captain over the people
[52:57] and he taken 2,000 men and Jonathan
[53:00] taken a th and Jonathan went down to a
[53:03] Garrison and smok a bunch of
[53:06] ammonites ammonites rather and when when
[53:09] he had smoked them Saul sounded a
[53:12] trumpet and said you see what Saul has
[53:16] done he began to get puffed
[53:21] up just as soon as a man gets to be some
[53:25] great doctor of the
[53:28] Divinity or gets a little something
[53:31] behind his
[53:33] name he becomes more or less a Know It
[53:39] All God's man are humble
[53:43] man God's people are humble
[53:49] people when you see someone who says
[53:51] they have received the Holy
[53:53] Spirit and begins to separ separate
[53:57] themselves seemingly not having the
[53:59] faith going about trying to be something
[54:03] that they're not just remember they
[54:05] haven't received the Lord Jesus
[54:11] amen then we
[54:13] find that the enemy set in and he was
[54:16] going to come into a little bunch of
[54:18] God's people and was going to pluck out
[54:21] the right eye of every
[54:23] man that's what the enemy always tries
[54:26] to do do is pluck out both eyes if you
[54:29] can so that the people cannot see what
[54:33] they're
[54:34] doing That's what Satan tries to do
[54:36] today to every Christian pluck out his
[54:40] spiritual
[54:41] sight that he can only follow the
[54:44] intellectual sense of things and not the
[54:46] sense of the Holy Spirit leading
[54:52] him so then when they did that
[54:57] when the Great defeat come then Saul cut
[55:00] up two great ox and sent them to all the
[55:03] people and I wish you would notice
[55:06] here when Saul sent the pieces of the ox
[55:09] to all Israel and said let every man
[55:13] that will not follow
[55:15] Samuel and
[55:18] Saul let him this ax be as
[55:22] this do you see how deceitful he tried
[55:25] to represent himself
[55:27] with the man of
[55:31] God how how un Christian it
[55:37] was the fear of the people was because
[55:40] of
[55:41] Samuel but Saul got them all to follow
[55:44] him because that the people feared
[55:47] Samuel let them come after Samuel and
[55:53] Saul and how many times today have we
[55:57] heard it we are the great
[56:00] church we are the Church of Christ we
[56:03] are the Church of God we are the the so
[56:05] and
[56:07] so it makes the people get a fear and
[56:11] think that that really is where God's
[56:17] working
[56:19] and they don't want the leadership of
[56:21] the Holy Spirit they'd rather follow man
[56:23] like that because they like to live
[56:26] their own individual life that's right
[56:29] they like to believe what they want to
[56:34] believe do you see the holy spirit is
[56:38] our
[56:41] judge God never give us a pope or a
[56:44] bishop or anybody to be a
[56:48] judge the Holy Spirit the person of God
[56:53] in the form of the holy spirit is our
[56:55] judge and and our
[56:58] God now why is
[57:01] that please pardon this rude and most
[57:04] rude
[57:06] expression I do not mean it to be
[57:10] mean I say it from
[57:13] love but the holy spirit says it's wrong
[57:16] for our women to cut their
[57:21] hair and it's wrong for our women to
[57:23] wear little shorts and slacks
[57:28] and to make up their lips and face with
[57:31] paint the holy spirit says it's wrong
[57:35] amen but we want man to tell us that
[57:39] it's all right that's right as long as
[57:43] we follow me and
[57:49] Samuel they like to live through six
[57:52] days any way they want
[57:54] to and go to church CH on Sunday morning
[57:57] and a fine
[57:59] intellectual college graduate with
[58:02] plenty of
[58:03] degrees can speak to them a little
[58:06] sermon that will a few jokes in it that
[58:09] would tickle their ears and cause them
[58:12] to be entertained like some movie or
[58:16] television
[58:18] program and say a little prayer over
[58:21] them and send them home with kind of a a
[58:25] self saatis five
[58:28] security that they've done their
[58:33] religion that is not the will of the
[58:37] Holy
[58:38] Spirit the Holy Spirit wants you to live
[58:43] Godly every day in the week and every
[58:47] night separating yourselves from the
[58:51] things of the
[58:53] world but the church don't want
[58:56] that they want some man who can who can
[59:00] interpret the Bible the way that they
[59:03] want to hear
[59:06] it they won't listen to the voice of the
[59:09] Holy Spirit speaking through the
[59:15] Bible many of them want to say the days
[59:17] of Miracles is passed that's what
[59:20] tickles the people they want to say
[59:23] there's no baptism of the Holy Spirit
[59:26] the people don't want to act any
[59:29] different than what the rest of the
[59:30] world
[59:32] acts they don't want to get on the
[59:35] street and uh to have their face washed
[59:38] and and man with clean accountants and
[59:41] not cigarettes in their mouth and and
[59:45] cigars and pipes and and the things that
[59:48] men do and women wants their hair cut up
[59:50] real short and and little dresses on and
[59:54] of showing their Farms and things that
[59:57] they won't they they want man who will
[59:59] tell them that's all
[1:00:02] right then the other
[1:00:05] night here come a man to tell
[1:00:09] me that because that I had preached
[1:00:12] against
[1:00:15] such had a great denomination about five
[1:00:18] of them said we'll drop brother benam
[1:00:21] and have nothing else to do with him
[1:00:26] you'll either call those tapes back and
[1:00:29] apologize for them or we'll drop
[1:00:33] you I said I'll stand with God's word if
[1:00:38] it takes everything that's in my life
[1:00:40] Hallelujah I'll remain with the word and
[1:00:44] I said well should you not call back
[1:00:47] such and such a tape I said I have never
[1:00:50] preached anything in my life that I was
[1:00:53] ashamed to have amen amen I call back no
[1:00:57] tapes or no
[1:01:00] records I remain with what the holy
[1:01:02] spirit says that I live by and die
[1:01:07] by not trying to say about myself now
[1:01:11] but I'm just trying to give you an
[1:01:14] illustration of what's going on so you
[1:01:16] will see and understand it's people
[1:01:20] wants to be led by man that's right they
[1:01:24] didn't want Samuel
[1:01:26] than before they anointed Samuel King uh
[1:01:29] Saul King pardon
[1:01:32] me Samuel came to them
[1:01:35] again and I'm going to speak Justus in
[1:01:38] language like he would have said it
[1:01:39] today you may read
[1:01:42] it he said what is the matter with God
[1:01:46] being your
[1:01:48] King well we don't see
[1:01:51] God well I am his representative
[1:01:56] Samuel said have I ever told you
[1:01:59] anything
[1:02:02] wrong have I ever prophesied anything
[1:02:05] that didn't come to pass just as I said
[1:02:07] it would
[1:02:09] do have not I told you the word of the
[1:02:12] Lord and I'll ask you this have I ever
[1:02:15] come to you and begged any your
[1:02:17] money have I ever took anything from
[1:02:21] you have I ever brought you anything but
[1:02:25] straight thus sayith the Lord and God
[1:02:29] has Vindicated it every time that it was
[1:02:32] the
[1:02:33] truth thank you Lord and he sent a
[1:02:35] thunderstorm and rains you know the
[1:02:37] scripture you right there to prove that
[1:02:40] Samuel was God's
[1:02:45] mouthpiece and as Samuel perfectly
[1:02:49] represented today the Holy
[1:02:52] Spirit the holy spirit is God's mouth
[1:02:56] piece amen that speaks just exactly what
[1:02:59] the Bible says that believes just what
[1:03:03] the Bible says and won't vary from it
[1:03:07] one
[1:03:08] bit but they wanted somebody who could
[1:03:13] tell them
[1:03:15] different and the people could not say
[1:03:18] that Samuel's prophecy wasn't
[1:03:21] perfect they answered and said
[1:03:24] Samuel all all that you have spoken the
[1:03:28] name of the
[1:03:29] Lord the Lord has brought it to pass
[1:03:32] just as you
[1:03:35] said there is not one th you never did
[1:03:38] come to us and beg us for our
[1:03:41] money you have supported
[1:03:45] yourself you've never asked us to do any
[1:03:47] great outstanding thing for you you've
[1:03:50] trusted in your God and he has delivered
[1:03:52] you from all
[1:03:54] things and you're words are true
[1:03:56] everything you spoke in the name of the
[1:03:58] Lord has been just as you
[1:04:00] said but still we want a
[1:04:08] king can you
[1:04:10] see the
[1:04:13] discrepancy can you you see the the
[1:04:18] kindness of the devil can work on a
[1:04:21] human
[1:04:22] being instead of yielding himself for
[1:04:26] herself to the Holy Spirit and listen to
[1:04:29] what thus sayith the Lord
[1:04:32] is for a Pure Life a undefiled
[1:04:37] character for a different life for
[1:04:40] peculiar people a holy
[1:04:43] nation are odd acting people they had
[1:04:46] rather coincides with the world and act
[1:04:50] like the world and go to some church and
[1:04:52] says that's all right just act like that
[1:04:54] and go on can you see what it is yes
[1:04:58] they say there's no such a thing as
[1:05:00] healing oh the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:02] Spirit was a frame work to the church in
[1:05:05] other words then God taken man tuck the
[1:05:08] Holy Spirit out of the church and let
[1:05:10] the denomination Build It Up never never
[1:05:14] there's no such a thing the Holy Spirit
[1:05:17] the word of Truth was to guide you until
[1:05:19] Jesus comes
[1:05:22] amen but that's the way it it went
[1:05:27] Saul come into
[1:05:29] power he great got a great
[1:05:32] following oh he had beautiful
[1:05:36] armors he had
[1:05:39] singers he had Shields and he had
[1:05:43] Spears oh he outshined all the rest of
[1:05:46] the
[1:05:49] Nations and he brought them into a
[1:05:53] democracy that was beyond anything that
[1:05:56] anybody had ever heard
[1:06:00] of and that's exactly what our
[1:06:03] denominations and churches has done
[1:06:06] today we have the biggest church
[1:06:08] buildings in the
[1:06:11] world we have the prettiest dressed
[1:06:14] people in the
[1:06:16] world we have the highest scholarships
[1:06:19] that can be
[1:06:21] brought like Saul's trained man who
[1:06:24] could take that Spirit they could move
[1:06:27] it and maneuver to Nations fear
[1:06:30] then they were trained people and all
[1:06:35] but one day there come a
[1:06:40] time that there was a challenger come
[1:06:45] out and it's so
[1:06:49] excited the whole Israelite Army till
[1:06:52] they stood trembling in their shoes
[1:06:59] Goliath made them a
[1:07:02] challenge if your God Is What You Say He
[1:07:08] is you are the best
[1:07:11] trained and he challenged
[1:07:15] them they didn't know what to
[1:07:18] do their fine polished armors wouldn't
[1:07:22] work their Spears wouldn't work
[1:07:26] there was something they hadn't heard of
[1:07:28] before was taking
[1:07:32] place and with all reverence and godly
[1:07:35] respects and honor and dignity and love
[1:07:40] and Christian Fellowship I say
[1:07:45] this I read the other day in an African
[1:07:50] paper were that our son of
[1:07:54] Kish are Challenger of
[1:07:57] evangelism when Mohammad and challenged
[1:08:01] him Billy
[1:08:03] Graham said if your God is God let him
[1:08:08] heal the sick like he said he do
[1:08:12] amen
[1:08:16] hallelujah and the son of Kish with the
[1:08:20] rest of the army quieten themselves and
[1:08:24] left the country to deed that's
[1:08:27] right it's a
[1:08:30] disgrace our God is God Amen we have our
[1:08:35] good churches we have our fine
[1:08:38] evangelism we have our paid singers we
[1:08:41] have the best choirs the highest spires
[1:08:45] in the country we have the finest men
[1:08:48] some of the most money we have the
[1:08:51] intellectual we have theology down to
[1:08:54] the point we we can preach it we can
[1:08:56] tell it we can evangelize and bring
[1:08:59] people in and make millions each year of
[1:09:01] converts into the church our paid
[1:09:05] singers our intellectual evangelism
[1:09:08] doesn't know how to meet a challenge
[1:09:11] like
[1:09:11] that they know nothing of
[1:09:14] it they know nothing of his healing
[1:09:18] power of the baptism of the Holy
[1:09:21] Ghost of a power that can take a shout
[1:09:25] of a man dying with a Cancer and set him
[1:09:28] free they know nothing of it they
[1:09:31] haven't been trained in that

[1:13:09] Spirit I don't know my
[1:13:12] days no one
[1:13:15] does the other morning I was laying in
[1:13:18] my
[1:13:20] bed and I was I've been asleep and I
[1:13:24] dreamed the Joseph was
[1:13:27] sick and I picked him up to pray for
[1:13:31] him and when I woke up I was very upset
[1:13:35] I said well maybe Joseph is going to be
[1:13:38] sick and I looked going before me in a
[1:13:41] little dark
[1:13:43] shadow rather of a brownish color and it
[1:13:46] seemed like it was
[1:13:49] me and I watched it and coming behind it
[1:13:51] was someone white and it was him
[1:13:57] I looked over to my wife to see if she
[1:13:59] was awake and I could show her if she
[1:14:00] could see the vision but she was
[1:14:03] sleeping I said oh I'm sorry
[1:14:08] Lord but that's been my life you've had
[1:14:10] to dve me everything that had
[1:14:14] done every time anything had happened I
[1:14:16] think it was you doing it and I realized
[1:14:19] it was Satan trying to keep me away from
[1:14:23] him I said If You Could Only leave
[1:14:26] me and as I look I seen the prettiest
[1:14:30] face I ever saw on a
[1:14:32] man he was in front of me looking back
[1:14:36] he raised his hand and got a hold of
[1:14:38] mine started moving this
[1:14:40] away the vision left
[1:14:44] me last Sunday morning I was waking up
[1:14:48] early that was on Saturday this
[1:14:50] Vision on always worried
[1:14:56] I've always thought of dying
[1:14:58] at me being 50 it's my time is not
[1:15:02] didn't think was too long and I wonder
[1:15:05] why I would be in this
[1:15:07] theophany Celestial
[1:15:10] body would it be that I'd see my
[1:15:13] precious friends and say a little white
[1:15:15] fog going by and say there goes brother
[1:15:18] ner he couldn't say hello brother
[1:15:20] Brandon when Jesus come then I'd be man
[1:15:23] again
[1:15:25] I often thought that I was dreaming that
[1:15:28] I was out west and I coming down to a
[1:15:31] little Sage
[1:15:32] Brush Place and my wife was with me and
[1:15:36] we've been trout fishing and I stopped
[1:15:38] and and opened up the gate and the skies
[1:15:42] were so pretty they didn't look like
[1:15:45] they do over the valley here they were
[1:15:47] blue in the pretty white
[1:15:49] clouds and I said to
[1:15:52] wife I said we ought have been out here
[1:15:54] long long time ago honey she said for
[1:15:57] the children's sake we should have been
[1:15:59] Billy I said that's I woke
[1:16:02] up I don't I'm streaming so much I
[1:16:05] wonder
[1:16:06] why and I looked down and she was laying
[1:16:08] by me and I raised up on my pillow as
[1:16:13] many you people have done pop my head up
[1:16:16] on the the headboard of the bed and pop
[1:16:19] my hands behind me and I was laying
[1:16:22] there like this and I said well

[1:16:31] side I am already

[1:16:40] the
[1:16:41] lord well I know I won't be
[1:16:44] martal half of my time is gone at least
[1:16:47] or more than half if I live to be as old
[1:16:50] as my
[1:16:51] people still half my time is gone
[1:16:55] and I looked around and I was laying
[1:16:58] there fixing to get up it's about 7:00 I
[1:17:00] said I believe I'll go down church this
[1:17:03] morning if I am horse I'd like to hear

[1:17:13] soundly
[1:17:16] and I don't want you to miss
[1:17:20] this it has changed
[1:17:23] me I can't be the same brother of
[1:17:26] Brandon that I
[1:17:30] was and I
[1:17:32] look and I heard something kept
[1:17:36] saying you're just starting press the
[1:17:41] battle just keep pressing
[1:17:44] yes I shook my head a minute I thought
[1:17:47] well I probably just thinking like this
[1:17:50] you know your person's can get some
[1:17:52] imaginations and I said I just probably
[1:17:56] imagine that it said press the battle
[1:17:59] keep going keep
[1:18:03] going I said maybe I said
[1:18:05] it and I put my lips within my teeth and
[1:18:09] put my hand over my
[1:18:11] mouth and there come again said just
[1:18:14] keep pressing if you only knew what was
[1:18:18] at the end of the
[1:18:23] road and see like I could hear Grim

[1:18:32] of you

[1:18:50] would vanish all
[1:18:52] fears Lord let at me look past the
[1:18:56] curtain of
[1:18:57] time you've heard it sing here at the
[1:19:01] church and I heard something say would
[1:19:04] you like to see just beyond the
[1:19:07] curtain I said it would helped me so
[1:19:11] much and I looked in just a moment I one
[1:19:15] breath I'd come into a little place that
[1:19:18] slanted I looked back and there I was
[1:19:20] laying on the
[1:19:23] bed and I said this is a strange
[1:19:27] thing now I would not want you to repeat
[1:19:30] this this is before my
[1:19:33] church are my sheep that I am
[1:19:37] pastoring whether it was I was in this
[1:19:39] body or out or it was a
[1:19:42] translation it wasn't like any Vision I
[1:19:44] ever
[1:19:46] had I could look there and I could look
[1:19:49] here and when I hit that little place I
[1:19:52] never seen so many
[1:19:55] people come running
[1:19:58] screaming oh our precious
[1:20:02] brother and I looked in young
[1:20:06] women maybe in their early 20s 18 to 20
[1:20:11] they were throwing their arms around me
[1:20:14] and screaming our precious brother here
[1:20:18] come young
[1:20:19] man in the Brilliance of Young Manhood
[1:20:24] and their eyes glistening and looking
[1:20:27] like stars on a darken night their teeth
[1:20:31] as white as
[1:20:33] Perl and they were screaming and
[1:20:35] grabbing me and screaming oh our
[1:20:39] precious
[1:20:42] brother and I stopped and I looked and I
[1:20:45] was
[1:20:47] young I look back at my old body laying
[1:20:50] there with my hands behind my
[1:20:53] head and I said I don't understand
[1:20:57] this and these young women throwing
[1:20:59] their arms around
[1:21:01] me now I do realize this is the mixed
[1:21:04] audience and I say this with the
[1:21:07] sweetness and with the melness of the
[1:21:11] spirit man cannot put your arm around
[1:21:14] women without uh a human
[1:21:17] sensation but it wasn't
[1:21:22] there there was no yesterday or
[1:21:25] tomorrow they didn't get tired they were
[1:21:29] I never seen such pretty women in all my
[1:21:33] life they had a hair way down to their
[1:21:36] waistline long skirts to their feet and
[1:21:40] they were just a hugging me it wasn't a
[1:21:43] hug like even my own sister sitting
[1:21:45] there would have hug me they were not
[1:21:47] kissing me and I was not kissing them it
[1:21:51] was something that I I have not got the
[1:21:55] the vocabulary I haven't got the words
[1:21:58] to say perfection wouldn't touch it
[1:22:01] suburb wouldn't even touch it nowhere it
[1:22:04] was something that I never you just have
[1:22:07] to be
[1:22:08] there and I looked this way and that way
[1:22:11] and they were coming by the
[1:22:14] thousands and I
[1:22:16] said I don't understand
[1:22:19] this I said brother and here come
[1:22:23] hope that was was my first
[1:22:26] wife she run and never said my
[1:22:29] husband she said my precious
[1:22:33] brother and when she hugged
[1:22:36] me there was another woman standing
[1:22:39] there that hugged me and then H hug this
[1:22:43] woman and each one and I thought Bo this
[1:22:47] has to be something different it can't
[1:22:49] be there's
[1:22:51] something oh would I ever want to go
[1:22:54] back to that old carcass
[1:22:56] again I looked around there and I
[1:22:58] thought what is
[1:23:00] this I looked real good
[1:23:03] I I said I I can't understand this but
[1:23:07] hope seemed to be like uh oh a guest of
[1:23:12] honor she was no different but just like
[1:23:15] a guest of
[1:23:17] honor and I Heard a Voice then that
[1:23:19] spoke to me that was in the room said
[1:23:22] this is what you preach was Holy Ghost
[1:23:26] this is perfect
[1:23:30] love and nothing can enter here without
[1:23:35] it I am more determined than ever in my
[1:23:39] life that it takes perfect love to enter
[1:23:44] there there was no jealousy there was no
[1:23:48] tiredness there was no death sickness
[1:23:51] could never end there moral could could
[1:23:53] never make you old and them they could
[1:23:57] not cry it was just one Joy oh my
[1:24:00] precious brother and they took me up and
[1:24:03] set me up on a great big high
[1:24:06] place and I thought I am not dreaming
[1:24:09] I'm looking back at my my body laying
[1:24:11] down on the
[1:24:13] bed and they set me up there and I said
[1:24:15] oh I shouldn't set up here and here come
[1:24:18] women and men from both sides just in
[1:24:21] their Bloom of Youth screaming
[1:24:24] and one woman was standing there and she
[1:24:27] screamed oh my precious
[1:24:31] brother oh we are so happy to see you
[1:24:36] here I said I don't understand this and
[1:24:40] then that voice that was speaking from
[1:24:42] above me said you know it is written in
[1:24:45] the Bible that the prophets were
[1:24:47] gathered with their
[1:24:50] people and I said yes I remember that in
[1:24:53] the scripture

[1:26:00] does he'll judge you according to what
[1:26:02] you taught

[1:26:08] not we'll go in according to your
[1:26:11] teaching I said oh I'm so

[1:26:40] people screamed and said we know that
[1:26:43] and we know we are going with you
[1:26:44] someday back to Earth said Jesus will
[1:26:48] come and you'll be judged according to
[1:26:51] the word that you preached this and and
[1:26:54] then if you are accepted at that time

[1:28:43] Lord press to that
[1:28:47] place all fear of
[1:28:49] death I say this is my Bible before me
[1:28:52] this morning I've got a little boy there
[1:28:55] four years old to be raised I got a
[1:28:57] nine-year-old girl and a
[1:28:59] teenager that I'm thankful for that's
[1:29:02] turned the way of the
[1:29:04] Lord amen God let me live to bring them
[1:29:10] up in the admonition of
[1:29:12] God and above that the whole world seems
[1:29:16] to scream to
[1:29:18] me 90y old women and man and all kinds
[1:29:23] if you hadn't went we wouldn't been
[1:29:26] here God let me press the battle yes but
[1:29:31] if it comes to dying I am no Morse it
[1:29:35] would be a joy it would be a
[1:29:39] pleasure to enter from this corruption
[1:29:43] and
[1:29:44] disgrace if I could make up y 100
[1:29:48] billion miles
[1:29:50] high a square block and that's perfect
[1:29:53] love each step this way it
[1:29:56] Narrows until we get down to where we
[1:29:59] are
[1:30:00] now it would be just merely a shadow of
[1:30:04] corruption that little something that we
[1:30:07] can sense and feel that there's
[1:30:10] something somewhere we don't know what
[1:30:11] it is oh my precious
[1:30:18] friend my beloved my darlings of the
[1:30:22] Gospel
[1:30:24] my begotten children unto God listen to
[1:30:28] me your
[1:30:29] pastor amen you are wish there was some
[1:30:33] way I could explain it to
[1:30:35] you there's no words I couldn't find it
[1:30:39] it's not found anywhere but just beyond
[1:30:42] this last breath is the most glorious
[1:30:46] thing that you ever there is no way to
[1:30:49] explain it there's no way I just can't
[1:30:52] do it
[1:30:54] but whatever you do friends lay aside
[1:30:57] everything else till you get perfect
[1:31:01] love get to a spot that you can love
[1:31:04] everybody every enemy everything
[1:31:08] else that one visit there to me has made
[1:31:11] me a different man I can never never
[1:31:15] never be the same brother brandom that I
[1:31:19] was whether the planes are rocking where
[1:31:22] the Lightnings are flashing
[1:31:25] whether the spies has a gun on me
[1:31:27] whatever it is it doesn't matter I'm
[1:31:30] going to press the battle by the grace
[1:31:32] of God I preach the gospel to every
[1:31:35] creature and every person that I can
[1:31:38] persuading them to that beautiful land
[1:31:41] on Earth it may seem hard it may take a
[1:31:44] lot of
[1:31:46] strength I don't know how much longer we
[1:31:48] don't know physically speaking the from
[1:31:51] my examination the day he said you got
[1:31:54] 25 years of hard good life you're
[1:31:57] solid that helped me but oh that wasn't
[1:32:01] it that isn't it it's something within
[1:32:05] here this corruption has got to put on
[1:32:08] incorruption this Mortals got to put on
[1:32:11] immortality
[1:32:13] amen sons of Kish may rise I have all
[1:32:17] the good things they do I have nothing
[1:32:19] evil to say against it give to the poor
[1:32:22] and to charity and remember
[1:32:24] why Samuel told Saul you will also
[1:32:27] prophesy and many of those men are Great
[1:32:30] Mighty preachers can preach the word
[1:32:32] like archangels but still it wasn't
