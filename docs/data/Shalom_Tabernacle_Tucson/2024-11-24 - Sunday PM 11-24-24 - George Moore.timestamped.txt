[44:38] everyone in the house of the Lord
[44:41] amen amen amen we'll get right into the
[44:45] word tonight if you want to stand and
[44:46] turn your Bibles to Matthew the 19th
[44:49] Chapter I want to take up too much time
[44:51] you enjoy that message this
[44:53] morning amen Thanksgiving in the golden
[44:56] AG
[44:57] age and uh my how it ought to be the
[45:01] Golden Age of Thanksgiving for
[45:04] us amen I was thinking about these
[45:07] reports and stuff that's come up and 10p
[45:10] part series slandering the prophet and
[45:14] Saints I'll just be honest with you I
[45:16] don't care what a reporter
[45:17] says I it don't mean nothing to
[45:21] me uh I know what this message means to
[45:24] my life and I I know that God Vindicated
[45:28] it to me early on and I had looked for
[45:30] nothing else since and so I don't care
[45:32] what some reporter says or what some
[45:34] news article says I I believe what the
[45:36] word of God says and I think if there's
[45:38] a question about it we should do what
[45:40] Jesus said and search the scriptures not
[45:43] searching Google or searching uh
[45:46] searching uh uh some repor uh some
[45:49] something like that but let's search the
[45:50] scriptures and see if the message is
[45:52] true or not amen Matthew the 19th
[45:54] Chapter
[45:57] 16th verse and we'll read down through
[46:01] the 22nd and behold one came and said
[46:03] unto him good
[46:04] Master what good thing shall I do that I
[46:07] may have eternal life and he said unto
[46:09] him why callest thou me good there is
[46:12] none good but one that is God but if
[46:15] thou will enter into life keep the
[46:17] Commandments and he said unto him which
[46:20] and Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder
[46:21] Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou
[46:23] shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear
[46:25] false witness on thy father and thy
[46:28] mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor
[46:30] as thyself and the young man sath unto
[46:32] him all these things have I kept from my
[46:34] youth up what lack I yet and Jesus said
[46:37] unto him if thou will be perfect go and
[46:39] sell that thou Hast and give to the poor
[46:43] and thou shalt have treasure in heaven
[46:45] and come and follow me but when the
[46:47] young man heard that saying he went away
[46:49] sorrowful for he had great possessions
[46:53] and over in Mark the 12th chapter we'll
[46:55] read
[46:57] and the 29th
[47:03] verse so brother random brings this out
[47:06] that this young man had been keeping the
[47:08] Commandments but he knew that there was
[47:10] something that he still didn't have he
[47:12] knew even though he'd been keeping the
[47:14] Commandments he knew that there was
[47:16] something that that he did not have
[47:18] eternal life and mark the 12th chapter
[47:21] 29th verse Jesus answered him the first
[47:24] of all the Commandments is hear oh
[47:27] Israel the Lord our God is one
[47:30] Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy
[47:34] God with all thy heart and with all thy
[47:37] soul and with all thy mind and with all
[47:39] thy strength this is the first
[47:42] commandment and the second is like
[47:45] namely this Thou shalt love thy neighbor
[47:48] as thyself and there is none other
[47:52] commandment greater than these shall we
[47:55] bow our heads Heavenly Father we're so
[47:56] so grateful tonight to be here with the
[47:59] purchase of your blood the
[48:02] redeemed Lord of this age Lord the Bride
[48:05] of Jesus Christ and Lord It's a
[48:08] privilege to be assembled here Lord in
[48:11] your presence and father we thank you
[48:13] for the songs that we've heard we thank
[48:15] you for the musicians we thank you for
[48:17] the
[48:18] worship oh Lord we thank you for all
[48:21] these good things Lord as a they
[48:24] approaches of Thanksgiving we give you
[48:26] thanks for these things oh but Lord it
[48:30] would all be for not unless you come and
[48:32] visit with us Lord and oh God it's our
[48:35] desire to suck with you tonight Lord we
[48:38] invite your presence Lord in to our
[48:41] midst father that you might minister to
[48:43] our needs Lord we long for your presence
[48:47] we long to be in your presence Lord and
[48:50] father we just pray that you would grace
[48:53] us and bless us with your presence
[48:54] tonight Lord we pray that you'd watch
[48:57] over the further part of this service I
[48:58] ask you to bind my lips before I speak
[49:00] anything unpleasing to you and will
[49:02] commit it into your hands in the name of
[49:05] the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen amen
[49:09] God bless you may be seated the title of
[49:10] the message tonight is heart soul mind
[49:14] and
[49:15] strength and the Bible says in Matthew
[49:18] the 22nd chapter that the Pharisees came
[49:22] tempting Jesus and asked him what the
[49:25] greatest commandment in the law was and
[49:29] Jesus knew that they were tempting him
[49:31] when he gave them the answer and Jesus
[49:34] told them to love the Lord thy God with
[49:37] all thy heart and with all thy soul and
[49:41] with all thy mind and with all thy
[49:43] strength and he said the second
[49:46] commandment was the same it was to love
[49:49] thy neighbor as thy so turn to your
[49:52] neighbor and says the Bible says I got
[49:54] to love you tonight the Bible says I got
[49:57] to love you whether when you're in a
[49:59] good mood or when you're in a bad mood I
[50:02] got to love you when when you're easy to
[50:03] get along with or when it's hard I got
[50:06] to love you when I'm agreeing with you
[50:08] or when I'm disagreeing with you I got
[50:10] to love you when you're in the right or
[50:12] when you're in the wrong I got to love
[50:14] you in the good times I got to love you
[50:16] and in the bad times I got to love you
[50:18] because the Bible says I got to love you
[50:20] is that right and it said no commandment
[50:23] was greater than these two no
[50:25] commandment was greater he told them
[50:27] that on these two Commandments hang all
[50:31] the law and the prophets all the books
[50:33] of the law all the books of the prophets
[50:35] I'm going to go ahead and tell you
[50:36] that's all the word Saints and and on
[50:38] the on these two laws of loving the Lord
[50:41] thy God and loving your neighbor as
[50:43] yourself honoring your brother brother
[50:45] and sister all the word is hanging on
[50:49] those two Commandments tonight and he
[50:52] and no commandment is greater he said
[50:54] and and it's a pretty big deal is it and
[50:58] and all of these things and so this
[50:59] entire word that we believe is hanging
[51:03] hinging on two things that we love him
[51:06] with all of our hearts all of our soul
[51:09] all of our mind all of our strength and
[51:11] that we love our brother and
[51:14] sister all the words hanging on it and
[51:17] you remember the Pharisees they came and
[51:19] they were tempting him and Jesus
[51:21] answered knowing what he was doing and
[51:24] you remember the Rich Young Ruler Jes
[51:26] Jesus knew exactly where to get the Rich
[51:29] Young Ruler at he knew where to get him
[51:32] he knows where we fall short Saints we
[51:34] ain't got to tell him he already knows
[51:36] he said honor your father and mother he
[51:38] said oh I've done that Lord
[51:41] check don't kill I haven't killed check
[51:45] don't don't bear false witness I haven't
[51:46] bore false witness check I've I've done
[51:49] all these things since my youth don't
[51:50] commit adultery check Lord I'm I'm in
[51:52] good shape but then he said sell all you
[51:55] got and give it to the poor four and the
[51:57] man said whoa you went too far that
[52:00] time you went too far you meddling now
[52:06] preacher because there was a part of him
[52:09] that he wasn't willing to let go of now
[52:12] to him it was money but to you and I it
[52:15] might be something different might be a
[52:17] pride it might be a grudge that we got
[52:18] we're not willing to let go might be
[52:20] some amusement or some worldly fashion
[52:22] or or some of the world that we like to
[52:24] do that we're not willing to let go but
[52:26] make no mistake he
[52:29] knows is that
[52:32] right and so notice all these items that
[52:35] Jesus was listing to this young man were
[52:37] just the Commandments he's said honor
[52:39] your father and
[52:40] mother don't kill don't bear false
[52:42] witness don't commit
[52:44] adultery now there is no Commandment
[52:46] that says to sell all you have and give
[52:48] to the
[52:50] poor that's not a commandment but Jesus
[52:53] told him if he wanted eternal life he
[52:54] had to do it because there is a
[52:57] Commandment that says you have to love
[52:59] the Lord with all your heart all your
[53:02] soul all your mind all your strength
[53:05] there is a Commandment that says you got
[53:06] to love your neighbor as yourself and
[53:09] that and and selling all you have to
[53:10] feed the poor that's part of it is that
[53:13] right Saints now you don't have to do
[53:15] those things to have eternal life unless
[53:17] it's something that you're not willing
[53:19] to
[53:22] do okay see he wants to be our Lord not
[53:27] just our savior but also our Lord and he
[53:29] knows where we're holding back at and
[53:32] and so he wants it all doesn't he now if
[53:35] you notice uh all you single ladies in
[53:37] here tonight this was not a bad guy this
[53:40] was a really good guy this was a nice
[53:42] young man the kind of young man you
[53:44] wouldn't mind taking home to Mom and Dad
[53:46] this was a nice young man he he he was
[53:49] he was he honored his father and mother
[53:51] he fed you know he did all kinds of good
[53:53] things brother Ram said he was a good
[53:54] church member and and he was serving the
[53:57] lord pretty well H but he just couldn't
[54:00] give Jesus
[54:03] everything he couldn't let go of the
[54:07] money now whatever that is to you and I
[54:10] it might not be money but but it might
[54:11] be our time that we can't let go of you
[54:13] know sometime we want our personal time
[54:16] we want to have our time our downtime
[54:18] our relaxation time and if you're
[54:20] serving the lord sometimes brother
[54:22] Israel it's
[54:23] inconvenient it'll mess with your
[54:25] personal time amen but he wants our time
[54:28] also doesn't he amen and notice after
[54:31] this interaction this Young Ruler he
[54:33] didn't get poor after this interaction
[54:36] he he didn't get worse after this
[54:38] interaction he didn't have this
[54:39] interaction with Jesus leave away
[54:41] sorrowful and get worse that his life
[54:43] went into shambles no no he he got he
[54:46] got better he he got more money he got
[54:48] more stuff he had to build more barns he
[54:51] had to get more uh uh uh stuff to house
[54:54] all of his his stuff he had to have
[54:55] bigger Barns and so forth but the Bible
[54:58] found him in Hell asking for Lazarus to
[55:02] cross the chasm and dip his finger in
[55:04] the water and put it on his tongue
[55:06] because the Flames of hell were
[55:08] tormenting
[55:10] him and this was a good young church
[55:15] member because we have to serve the Lord
[55:19] with our heart soul mind and
[55:22] strength and you cannot do that without
[55:26] the the love of God in your life it it
[55:29] it takes a conversion to serve the Lord
[55:40] tonight it takes a
[55:43] conversion you can't live this life
[55:46] without being converted you can't serve
[55:48] the Lord without being converted you you
[55:52] you can't expect for people that do not
[55:54] love the Lord to operate under Christian
[55:56] principles under Christian values you
[55:59] know people get we we seem like we get
[56:01] shocked when we see the things that go
[56:03] on in the world SS we shouldn't be
[56:05] shocked at what goes on in the world
[56:07] those people are just doing what their
[56:08] nature dictates they do they're just
[56:11] being like a good pig if you will see we
[56:13] were all pigs at one time but we had to
[56:16] have a nature change and he said you
[56:18] can't blame a pig for wallering in the
[56:20] mud for eating slop you can't do it you
[56:24] got to change his nature to that of a
[56:25] sheep
[56:27] is that right Saints and so you find
[56:29] things in the world it's shocking and
[56:31] and and you know we try to talk to
[56:33] people in the world and and if you talk
[56:35] like for example marriage and divorce if
[56:37] you're in this world today and and and
[56:39] you're married and you're living a
[56:40] worldly life and something happens that
[56:42] you don't like it's nothing in the world
[56:44] to put your wife or put your husband
[56:46] away and go find you another
[56:48] one now you can't deal with those people
[56:50] the way we deal with it as a church
[56:52] because they don't understand what we're
[56:54] talking about because on all the law and
[56:57] the prophets are hinging on the love of
[57:01] God so we don't act shocked we got one
[57:04] set of rules and the world has another
[57:07] we got one thing that we abide by the
[57:08] world has something else see but
[57:11] Believers shouldn't be operating like
[57:12] the world either should
[57:15] they now there's a young lady at my work
[57:18] that she talks to me about her marital
[57:20] uh issues and things and and wants
[57:22] counseling and so forth and she's like
[57:23] what do I need to do here what do you
[57:24] and your wife do and I just tell her I
[57:26] said there's nothing I can tell you what
[57:28] we do but it won't mean anything to you
[57:30] because we're Believers we're Christians
[57:33] and and you you got to start right there
[57:35] first before I can help you because the
[57:38] things that apply to our life don't
[57:40] apply to yours because we have a common
[57:45] Faith that's why prison Ministries that
[57:47] I used to work in they they didn't work
[57:49] well because they would try to pick some
[57:51] kind of curriculum that's based on the
[57:53] Bible and Bible principles and they
[57:54] would try to teach the inmates these
[57:56] Bible principles well you can't give an
[57:58] inmate a set of laws and expect him to
[58:00] obey it he's an inmate that's what he's
[58:02] in jail cuz he couldn't obey the law to
[58:04] begin
[58:06] with you got to have a
[58:09] conversion you you got to change the
[58:12] nature and if you change the nature it's
[58:15] not a law no
[58:20] more now we can't expect our family
[58:23] members that don't believe this message
[58:25] that don't love the Lord Lord we we
[58:27] can't expect them to understand what
[58:28] we're talking about they can't
[58:30] understand this this is based on our
[58:32] love to God it's based on our love to
[58:35] each other and our love to God they
[58:36] don't understand what we're talking
[58:38] about but if there's a conversion takes
[58:44] place even young believers that haven't
[58:47] been filled with the Holy Ghost you
[58:50] cannot expect a young believer or a
[58:52] believer that does not have the Holy
[58:53] Ghost to operate at the same capacity as
[58:56] someone that has
[58:59] it now is that right
[59:01] Saints you you can't expect it you would
[59:04] not take a child that's learning to walk
[59:06] and spank him every time he falls down
[59:09] he's a child he's learning to walk he
[59:12] don't know what he's doing yet you got
[59:15] to let him grow you'll ruin him if you
[59:17] whoop him every time he falls down now
[59:19] if he's 40 years old and he's still
[59:21] walking on your feet then then then you
[59:23] got a problem there you need to do
[59:25] something about it but while he's a
[59:27] child while he's growing let him
[59:33] grow
[59:35] now we find this is it's it's you can
[59:39] live a holy life on your own is called
[59:44] legalism you can clean yourself up you
[59:47] can wear the right kind of clothes and
[59:50] say the right kind of words and talk the
[59:52] right kind of talk and and you can do
[59:54] all of those things and you can can live
[59:56] a fairly holy life but you're just going
[59:58] to be grumpy all the time you're going
[1:00:00] to be grumpy Saints because you're
[1:00:03] working yourself to death trying to do
[1:00:06] all of that and and it makes you tired
[1:00:09] and it makes you grumpy don't tell me
[1:00:11] cuz sometimes people around the message
[1:00:13] can be
[1:00:15] mean they get grumpy they get mean they
[1:00:19] because they're tired cuz they trying to
[1:00:21] live a life and they wore out trying to
[1:00:24] do it but Jesus J wants us to cease from
[1:00:28] our works and enter into the rest is
[1:00:32] that what he said Saints he said come
[1:00:34] unto me all ye that labor and are heavy
[1:00:37] laden and I will give you rest he said
[1:00:40] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[1:00:43] for I'm meek and lowly and heart and
[1:00:44] you'll find rest unto your souls for my
[1:00:47] yoke is easy and my burden is light
[1:00:50] Saints when I give my heart to the Lord
[1:00:52] it was
[1:00:54] easy when I tried to quit doing stuff on
[1:00:57] my own I couldn't do it but when I gave
[1:01:00] myself myself to the Lord he took it
[1:01:02] from me and when he fixes it it stays
[1:01:09] fixed you can't live by laws without a
[1:01:13] regeneration of the baptism of love
[1:01:16] because all these laws are hinging on
[1:01:18] the love of
[1:01:21] God so when you see worldliness or lack
[1:01:24] of Holiness in a in a church or in an
[1:01:26] individual it's not because the people
[1:01:28] are unbelievers or they're bad people
[1:01:30] it's they just have to be filled with
[1:01:32] the
[1:01:35] mainspring now Jesus said that this
[1:01:38] mainspring would lead and guide you in
[1:01:41] all truth John
[1:01:44] 16:12 he said I got many things yet to
[1:01:47] say unto you but you can't bear them now
[1:01:50] how be it when he the spirit of Truth is
[1:01:53] come he will guide you in all truth
[1:01:56] for he shall not speak of himself but
[1:01:59] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[1:02:02] speak and he will show you things to
[1:02:05] come now I know this is talking about
[1:02:07] the Holy Ghost Saints is this talking
[1:02:09] about the Holy Ghost but my goodness
[1:02:12] that sounds like what brother brandham
[1:02:14] did he shall glorify me for he shall
[1:02:18] receive of mine and shall show it unto
[1:02:21] you and all these things that the father
[1:02:24] hath are mine therefore I that he shall
[1:02:26] take of mine and shall show it unto you
[1:02:29] a little while and you shall not see me
[1:02:31] again a little while and you shall see
[1:02:34] me because I go to the father so it
[1:02:37] takes an infilling of the Holy Ghost to
[1:02:40] see God it takes an infilling of the
[1:02:43] Holy Ghost to to understand this word to
[1:02:47] understand true righteousness to
[1:02:49] understand what Holiness is and what it
[1:02:51] looks like and how to attain
[1:02:54] it it takes makes an in feeling of the
[1:02:57] Holy Ghost it's God's love placed inside
[1:03:01] of each and every one of us and all of a
[1:03:04] sudden things start to come together for
[1:03:06] you things you didn't understand in the
[1:03:08] word will start to come together things
[1:03:10] you didn't understand in your home will
[1:03:12] start to come together now I don't
[1:03:13] preach the Holy Ghost like it's a get
[1:03:15] out of jail free card and you get the
[1:03:17] Holy Ghost and all of a sudden you're
[1:03:18] never tempted and all of a sudden you're
[1:03:20] never tested and all of a sudden you
[1:03:21] never got a trial again I don't preach
[1:03:23] it like that Saints cuz that's not the
[1:03:25] world that we live live in if that's the
[1:03:27] case why did brother brandom have a a
[1:03:29] cross hanging in his car
[1:03:33] window but I do believe that the Holy
[1:03:36] Ghost inside of you when something
[1:03:38] happens that you did that you know you
[1:03:40] shouldn't do the first thing on your
[1:03:42] mind is
[1:03:44] repentance it's a it's a control tower
[1:03:47] that says oh you shouldn't have did that
[1:03:49] oh you shouldn't have did that oh you
[1:03:50] need to go over here or you need to go
[1:03:52] over there or you need to do this or you
[1:03:54] need to do that it'll guide you and Lead
[1:03:56] You In Truth and in righteousness and
[1:03:58] when you make a mistake it'll convict
[1:04:00] you thank God it'll convict
[1:04:03] you I want to be convicted I want to be
[1:04:06] told when I'm doing wrong because I want
[1:04:08] to be right is that
[1:04:14] right
[1:04:16] and you can't say you believe the word
[1:04:19] you can't say you believe the message
[1:04:21] and not have this love in your heart the
[1:04:24] love for God
[1:04:26] and the love for God's
[1:04:28] people you can say it but You' be
[1:04:33] lying because it takes the love of God
[1:04:36] and if you love God you love his
[1:04:39] people
[1:04:40] now this message is hanging on our love
[1:04:44] to
[1:04:45] him
[1:04:48] amen when a man and a woman are
[1:04:53] courting or whatever they call it now
[1:04:56] when they're dating or going together or
[1:05:01] talking or whatever it is the girls used
[1:05:04] to come home and tell me I say what
[1:05:06] about this boy you're
[1:05:08] dating and they say oh we're not dating
[1:05:10] Dad we're just
[1:05:14] talking well it looked like dating to
[1:05:17] me but apparently there's a distinction
[1:05:21] pastor and I said well what's going to
[1:05:23] change in the relationship with when you
[1:05:26] stop talking and start
[1:05:31] dating I mean we in the message right
[1:05:34] pastor preached on that this morning
[1:05:37] ain't too much going to change but
[1:05:39] talking is about all you're gonna be
[1:05:48] doing but when they're date and when
[1:05:50] you're talking when you when you when
[1:05:51] you're talking before this your
[1:05:53] significant other it's it's a h huge
[1:05:56] investment in time and in energy and and
[1:06:01] and in your in your bandwidth of your
[1:06:03] brain it's it's a huge investment
[1:06:05] sometimes it's a big investment in money
[1:06:07] too and then and it's always in the
[1:06:10] Forefront of your mind it's always a
[1:06:12] primary thought when you're talking to
[1:06:15] somebody when you're dating somebody and
[1:06:18] and and and so it it's something that
[1:06:19] that both people both parties are are
[1:06:22] they're going to do all they can all
[1:06:24] they can do to put their best foot
[1:06:26] forward to present themsel in the best
[1:06:28] light possible you know he he ain't
[1:06:31] gonna he ain't G he's gonna keep his
[1:06:32] hair cut and he's gonna keep shaved up
[1:06:34] and and he's going to keep a shower
[1:06:36] going he ain't going to stink
[1:06:37] everybody's going to smell good he'll go
[1:06:40] to the gym he'll work out he wants that
[1:06:42] belly not to get too
[1:06:44] big she's going to have her hair fixed
[1:06:47] right her clothes are going to be just
[1:06:49] right she ain't going to show up looking
[1:06:50] like she been shot out of a
[1:06:53] cannon because you're going to put a lot
[1:06:55] of energy a lot of effort into that
[1:06:58] trying to build a relationship word to
[1:07:00] the wise if they ain't willing to do it
[1:07:02] when you're talking it ain't going to
[1:07:04] get better once you get married to them
[1:07:07] cuz you getting the best they got right
[1:07:10] there and if the best they got's pretty
[1:07:12] bad cut them
[1:07:15] loose oh my here we go all
[1:07:21] right but there's a lot of investment in
[1:07:24] that he they'll spend a lot of time
[1:07:27] communicating with one another asking
[1:07:29] questions sisters he'll even listen to
[1:07:31] what you're
[1:07:37] saying because you're trying to develop
[1:07:39] a
[1:07:40] relationship you're trying to grow a
[1:07:43] relationship and you'll do whatever you
[1:07:45] can to build upon that
[1:07:47] relationship and and and then after the
[1:07:50] marriage after the wedding life begins
[1:07:53] to happen you know it's a amazing to me
[1:07:56] when people get a divorce in the world
[1:07:59] as soon as they start to go through that
[1:08:01] divorce they'll start to lose weight
[1:08:03] start going to the gym start getting
[1:08:05] their clothes fixed and start to look
[1:08:07] nice they'll start to invest a lot of
[1:08:09] energy in taking care of them if they'
[1:08:11] put that energy in on the front side
[1:08:12] there might not be a
[1:08:18] divorce but when you start going through
[1:08:20] the trials of life oh I'm telling you
[1:08:22] living in this world is a trial Saints
[1:08:25] and and and and and if you start going
[1:08:28] through those things and you start going
[1:08:30] through issues at the job and issues at
[1:08:33] work and issues at the home and when the
[1:08:36] kids come along that's a stress isn't it
[1:08:39] I mean y'all's kids not my kids my my
[1:08:41] kids was
[1:08:44] perfect but it's a stress raising kids
[1:08:48] it's a stress having all that stuff
[1:08:50] dirty around the
[1:08:52] house they touch everything
[1:08:56] they don't leave stuff alone they go
[1:08:59] into your office and mess around brother
[1:09:01] Israel it's a stress it's a stress on a
[1:09:05] young man when finally one day he wakes
[1:09:07] up and realizes he's going to get up and
[1:09:09] go to work every day for the rest of his
[1:09:14] life it's a stress hit me like a ton of
[1:09:17] bricks one
[1:09:18] day because when you're young you know
[1:09:21] and you're growing you're looking
[1:09:22] forward to stuff I'm going to get my

[1:09:26] become an adult or or I'm going to
[1:09:27] graduate college or I'm going to find
[1:09:30] somebody to marry and and then one day
[1:09:31] you do all of that and all that's left
[1:09:33] is to get up go to
[1:09:40] work every day whether you feel like it
[1:09:44] or not oh it's

[1:09:52] stressful stressful to raise children
[1:09:55] it's stressful to be wore out ladies and
[1:09:57] still have a mountain of clothes to wash
[1:09:59] or a bunch of dishes to do it's
[1:10:02] stressful it's stressful to find the
[1:10:04] will of the Lord for your life it's
[1:10:07] stressful to do those things and and
[1:10:09] it's stressful to to belong to a
[1:10:12] church I mean not this church I'm

[1:10:56] those trials and tests take your eye and
[1:10:58] your mind off of the original

[1:13:04] veteran preacher had a lot of hard
[1:13:05] battles come on somebody tonight had a
[1:13:08] lot of hard battles come on somebody
[1:13:11] tonight had some
[1:13:13] battles and maybe I'm all scarred all
[1:13:15] cut up on the inside from fights because
[1:13:18] my life that the lord gave me was not
[1:13:20] back to kiss the babies and to marry the
[1:13:22] young and bury the old but it was to
[1:13:24] hold a two-handed sword at the
[1:13:28] Battlefront against the Ws of paganism
[1:13:31] and demonology and the powers of
[1:13:35] darkness and to fight it with the word
[1:13:38] of God till I seen the enemy defeated he
[1:13:41] said I've been cut deep many times and
[1:13:45] Saints you've been called to this same
[1:13:48] gospel tonight oh you might not be a
[1:13:50] prophet oh but you've been called to
[1:13:52] hold a two-handed sword you've been
[1:13:54] called called to represent Jesus Christ
[1:13:57] to this church to this state to this
[1:14:00] country you've been called to it and
[1:14:03] there's going to be battles if you
[1:14:05] called to this way but thank God you're
[1:14:09] called thank God that he predestinated
[1:14:13] you to this thank God he put something
[1:14:15] in you that says I don't care what no
[1:14:17] reporter says I don't care what the
[1:14:20] world says I don't care what Google says
[1:14:22] I want to know what he says
[1:14:26] thank God it's in there and if you
[1:14:28] believe that there's going to be
[1:14:32] fights David was a
[1:14:35] warrior and he's the one that said
[1:14:38] restore unto me the joy of my salvation
[1:14:42] all those battles brother Tim all those
[1:14:45] fights all those Hard Times all those
[1:14:48] long nights all those sleepless nights
[1:14:50] amen all of those battles they wore him
[1:14:54] out
[1:14:58] and he said Lord restore unto me the joy
[1:15:03] Lord let me feel like I felt that day
[1:15:06] when you come into my life let me feel
[1:15:09] like it was the day I first was
[1:15:17] converted but Saints the fire is still
[1:15:21] there the fire is still there we just
[1:15:25] need to
[1:15:27] refocus we need to put some effort back
[1:15:30] into the
[1:15:33] relationship Naturally Speaking Saints
[1:15:35] there's nothing more important to me
[1:15:37] than my
[1:15:38] family there's nothing more important to
[1:15:40] me than my children if you mess with
[1:15:43] them children you're messing with me cuz
[1:15:45] they're my babies come on sisters
[1:15:47] they're my babies right or wrong if
[1:15:51] they're smart or dumb they're my
[1:15:53] babies if they're doing right if they're
[1:15:56] doing wrong they're still my babies
[1:15:58] they'll always be my babies and I'll
[1:16:01] always love
[1:16:03] them now what are you to God
[1:16:09] today what do you mean to him I think
[1:16:13] he's proved by his actions what you mean
[1:16:15] to
[1:16:16] him
[1:16:18] amen now many times we feel distance
[1:16:21] from the Lord but when we peel back the
[1:16:24] layers of the onion so to speak when we
[1:16:27] we peel it back you can see things are a
[1:16:30] lot simpler than we think they are oh I
[1:16:32] feel distant from the Lord I don't feel
[1:16:34] close to the Lord right now well how's
[1:16:35] your prayer life when's the last time
[1:16:38] you talk to him if you went a month and
[1:16:40] didn't talk to your wife you'd be
[1:16:42] distant from her wouldn't
[1:16:45] you well if you don't talk to him you
[1:16:48] feel distant from him if you don't have
[1:16:49] a relationship with him how's your how's
[1:16:51] your time listening to tapes how much
[1:16:54] time have you dispense consuming the
[1:16:56] word of
[1:16:58] God sometimes it ain't hard sometimes
[1:17:00] it's real easy if you're not praying and
[1:17:03] you're not listening to the message and
[1:17:05] and and you're not reading your
[1:17:08] Bible it's easy to feel
[1:17:11] distant brother Brown said God keeps his
[1:17:14] word he said read the
[1:17:16] word read the word he said some of you
[1:17:19] don't read once a week he said you ought
[1:17:22] to read chapter after chapter every day
[1:17:26] he said meditate if you if you'd get
[1:17:28] your head out of them old magazines and
[1:17:30] things you're reading out of this old so
[1:17:33] many papers and so-called religious
[1:17:35] literature that ought not never be on
[1:17:37] the market he said that's that's just as
[1:17:39] bad as reading some of the other
[1:17:40] magazines stuff that's false Doctrine
[1:17:42] and all kinds of dogma and bi and it's
[1:17:45] basing it upon the
[1:17:47] truth now Saints I don't read a lot of
[1:17:49] magazines but but man is Pham
[1:17:55] news articles and social media and all
[1:18:00] kinds of other I'm not saying it's
[1:18:01] sinful I'm not saying it's wrong but but
[1:18:04] but Saints it's not the main thing the
[1:18:06] mainspring is the main thing amen and I
[1:18:10] don't say that you you sure you can't
[1:18:12] ever look at stuff like that but you
[1:18:13] can't do it instead of looking at the
[1:18:18] word the words got to come
[1:18:21] first you can't look at the news until
[1:18:23] you've read the good news
[1:18:25] oh come on somebody tonight Church

[1:18:43] said see you'll die spiritually you'll
[1:18:47] just dwindle away
[1:18:55] I didn't say
[1:18:58] that a prophet said
[1:19:00] it if you don't have a church you
[1:19:04] must you'll die
[1:19:08] spiritually

[1:19:13] time when was the last time that we read
[1:19:16] our Bible when we prayed last time we

[1:19:21] Ghost outpouring we were in
[1:19:25] oh let me tell you something Saints
[1:19:26] don't let nobody shame you for wanting
[1:19:29] to be in a holy ghost
[1:19:32] service don't let nobody try to talk you
[1:19:35] into that being bad I'm G Saints I know
[1:19:38] it's the word I know it's based on the
[1:19:41] word it takes the spirit to Quicken the
[1:19:45] word oh it ain't nothing wrong you feel
[1:19:47] yourself getting starchy and you feel
[1:19:49] yourself getting wound down you got to
[1:19:52] get in a holy ghost meeting somewhere

[1:20:06] say Amen he'll come on me and make me do
[1:20:08] it well he ain't never going
[1:20:10] to if he wants me to shout he'll come

[1:20:28] wrong with wanting to see the spirit of
[1:20:31] God move I long to see the spirit of God
[1:20:34] move I crave it Saints I want to be in
[1:20:37] that atmosphere an atmosphere where
[1:20:39] children can be born where Sinners can
[1:20:42] be saved where the righteous can be
[1:20:45] refilled where the spirit of God can
[1:20:47] move throughout the building I've been
[1:20:49] helped by it I've been healed by it I've
[1:20:51] been touched by it I've been delivered
[1:20:53] by it
[1:20:55] I crave it I want to be around it how
[1:20:59] can you be a Christian and not long to
[1:21:02] be in the presence of almighty
[1:21:07] God oh I don't like it when things get
[1:21:09] out of hand I want things to get out of
[1:21:11] hand get them out of hand long enough to
[1:21:14] get somebody saved
[1:21:26] he
[1:21:29] said holy ghost
[1:21:31] outpour what about the last time we had
[1:21:33] some good codly Godly Christian
[1:21:38] Fellowship Saints it's important that we
[1:21:42] have fellowship with one
[1:21:44] another there's a lot of Christians that
[1:21:46] spend more time with the world than they
[1:21:48] spend with other
[1:21:49] Christians you you need Godly Fellowship
[1:21:53] you need to be around brothers and
[1:21:55] sisters you need it the Bible said so
[1:21:59] much more as the day
[1:22:02] approaching we need it Saints I need to
[1:22:05] be around my brothers and sisters you
[1:22:08] need to be now you might say you don't
[1:22:10] but that's a
[1:22:13] lie because the message says you do
[1:22:16] identified Masterpiece of
[1:22:18] God he said I
[1:22:21] think it's when we can get together with
[1:22:24] this type of Fellowship it does
[1:22:26] something to us what's it
[1:22:29] do that draws us closer to each other
[1:22:34] and as we get closer to each other we
[1:22:37] also get closer to
[1:22:41] God for Jesus said in so much as youve
[1:22:44] done to the least of these my little
[1:22:46] ones you've done it unto me remember the
[1:22:50] everything's hinging on two rules love

[1:25:12] come the more you want to
[1:25:15] come the best way to increase your
[1:25:17] appetite is to eat more come on somebody
[1:25:21] today now brother Jason Watkins
[1:25:23] mentioned a study brother Israel
[1:25:25] mentioned it here a few weeks ago and
[1:25:28] this study I went and looked it up and
[1:25:30] read through it it's very interesting
[1:25:32] and it was studied by the center of
[1:25:34] Bible engagement and it studied 40,000
[1:25:37] people ages 8 to 80 so pretty broad
[1:25:41] spectrum 8 to 80 and it and it and it
[1:25:45] and it and looked at how they were
[1:25:47] engaging in the scripture and they
[1:25:49] compiled their research findings and the
[1:25:52] study indicated that when people engaged
[1:25:55] in the scripture one time a week which
[1:25:58] could include the pastor instructing
[1:26:00] them to open their
[1:26:02] Bibles there was negligible effect on
[1:26:06] their
[1:26:08] life so when they engaged when they open
[1:26:10] the Bible once a week there was no
[1:26:16] effect on their life now this is just a
[1:26:18] world this is just a
[1:26:19] secular
[1:26:23] study when they open the Bible twice a
[1:26:28] week there was no effect on their
[1:26:33] life when they opened up the Bible three
[1:26:36] times a
[1:26:37] week there was very little almost no
[1:26:41] effect on their
[1:26:43] life but when they got to four times a
[1:26:47] week or
[1:26:50] more the the effects were incredible
[1:26:55] incredible now you would think one time
[1:26:58] a week here and then twice a week a
[1:27:00] little bit more and three times a week a
[1:27:02] little bit more but that ain't what it
[1:27:04] was there was almost no effect until it
[1:27:08] got to four times a week or
[1:27:10] more and when they reached that
[1:27:14] level the effects spiked in an
[1:27:18] astounding way when they got to four
[1:27:21] times a week feelings of loneliness Dr
[1:27:24] dropped by
[1:27:26] 30% anger issues come on somebody
[1:27:30] dropped by
[1:27:32] 32% so if you're feeling lonely or
[1:27:34] you're feeling mad give it four or five
[1:27:36] times a week see what
[1:27:38] happens bitterness in
[1:27:41] relationships dropped
[1:27:48] 40% I know we ain't got no bitterness in
[1:27:50] this church I'm just maybe this will
[1:27:52] help somebody else
[1:27:56] alcoholism dropped
[1:27:59] 57% sex outside of marriage dropped
[1:28:05] 68% feeling spiritually stagnant dropped
[1:28:11] 60% oh I just don't feel like I'm
[1:28:14] growing I don't feel like I'm getting
[1:28:16] better I don't I don't feel like the
[1:28:17] Lord's dealing with me like he should
[1:28:19] well open your Bible four times a week
[1:28:20] or
[1:28:22] more and 60% % of the
[1:28:26] time viewing pornography dropped
[1:28:31] 61% sharing your faith jumped
[1:28:40] 200% discipling others helping another
[1:28:43] one along jumped
[1:28:49] 230% now it looks like it would have
[1:28:52] went
[1:28:54] in in an
[1:28:56] order but what they found
[1:28:58] was is that the people that looked at
[1:29:01] the Bible once or twice a
[1:29:03] week felt as though they were looking at
[1:29:06] the Bible four or five times a week and
[1:29:09] they felt like that no effect was good
[1:29:13] effect and they they didn't realize that
[1:29:16] they they thought they were being good
[1:29:18] Christians but in actuality their their
[1:29:20] lives were no different than people who
[1:29:21] weren't Christians at all
[1:29:24] and so limited activity in in your in
[1:29:27] your brain your brain will mess with you
[1:29:29] your brain will play tricks on you
[1:29:32] limited activity in their in their minds
[1:29:34] was elevated to the same effect as
[1:29:36] consistent activity when actually the
[1:29:39] same it was the same as no
[1:29:43] activity so I read an article one time
[1:29:45] on working out and it said that if you
[1:29:47] can it's studied people and it it found
[1:29:49] that when people just thought about
[1:29:52] working out they felt better better
[1:29:54] about
[1:29:59] yourself when they just thought about
[1:30:02] working out they eat more calories
[1:30:07] than because just the thought of working
[1:30:10] out made them feel good enough they felt
[1:30:12] like they should get a
[1:30:19] reward so why four days a week I don't
[1:30:21] know I don't know but I wonder if it's
[1:30:25] not
[1:30:26] this you can go to
[1:30:31] church you can go to church and and the
[1:30:35] pastor can tell you to open the Bible
[1:30:38] now now most churches have two or three
[1:30:40] services a week so you could go to
[1:30:44] church and open your Bible three times a
[1:30:51] week but in order for you to open four
[1:30:54] times or
[1:30:56] more you would have to make a conscious
[1:30:59] decision to do it
[1:31:08] yourself now brother Ram says this
[1:31:11] rejected King he said they want somebody
[1:31:14] to do their religion for them somebody
[1:31:18] that will tell them just how to do it
[1:31:20] and all about
[1:31:21] it now is that what the prophet said
[1:31:25] they want somebody to do it for them
[1:31:27] they want somebody to tell them what
[1:31:28] scripture tell them what message to
[1:31:30] listen to tell them what what Bible
[1:31:33] scripture to read they want somebody to
[1:31:34] make them do
[1:31:36] it but Saints it doesn't work that
[1:31:40] way you have to make the
[1:31:42] decision you have to decide for yourself
[1:31:46] this is my house and we're going to read
[1:31:48] the Bible in it this is my house and
[1:31:51] we're going to hear the prophet in it
[1:31:53] this is my I'm going to listen to the T
[1:31:55] Ain't nobody got to make me do it I'm
[1:31:57] going to do it nobody's got to tell me
[1:31:59] to do it nobody's got to tell me to read
[1:32:01] my Bible I'm going to read the Bible cuz
[1:32:03] I'm a Christian that's who I am that's
[1:32:05] what I
[1:32:11] do seek out the Bible says your own
[1:32:14] salvation with fear and trembling amen
[1:32:18] unveiling reality is the Living God he
[1:32:20] said they want to live just like they
[1:32:21] want to live and they want to continue
[1:32:23] right on living the way they always live
[1:32:25] but yet be very
[1:32:27] religious and go to church and be a
[1:32:29] member thereof and get they can go on
[1:32:31] Sunday morning or whatever time it is
[1:32:33] and have a 15minute sermon from the
[1:32:35] pastor that will walk with them away
[1:32:37] from there kind of halfway satisfied
[1:32:40] that they've done their religion for the
[1:32:42] week that settles it and go back to
[1:32:45] doing anything they want to do the rest
[1:32:47] of the week Saints this ain't something
[1:32:49] we do on Sunday this is something we do
[1:32:51] every day it's something we live every
[1:32:53] day it's something that consumes our
[1:32:58] life it's the mainspring in our heart
[1:33:01] the mainspring in our
[1:33:05] church now so they examined the LifeWay
[1:33:09] Research Institute
[1:33:11] study found that the biggest factor for
[1:33:14] predicting the spiritual health of young
[1:33:16] adults ages 13 to
[1:33:18] 17 the biggest factor in their health
[1:33:25] was their engagement when the
[1:33:26] scripture the biggest factor for
[1:33:29] predicting the spiritual health of young
[1:33:30] adults is whether they read the Bible
[1:33:33] regularly as
[1:33:35] kids now Saints this this is just
[1:33:38] secular this sit in this is just I'll
[1:33:42] tell you
[1:33:44] everything has to has to confess this
[1:33:48] word now the other list of spiritual
[1:33:51] health indicators you want to you want
[1:33:52] to hear what they are
[1:33:54] it said that the number one was a child
[1:33:56] regularly read the Bible while growing
[1:33:58] up so we want to help our young people
[1:34:01] we want our young people to do well we
[1:34:03] want to see our young people filled with
[1:34:04] the Holy Ghost and serving the lord we
[1:34:07] want to see that don't we come on
[1:34:09] somebody say Amen if you want to see it
[1:34:11] we want to see our young people doing
[1:34:12] well the number one indicator was the
[1:34:16] child regularly read the Bible while
[1:34:18] growing
[1:34:19] up number two was the child regular
[1:34:24] spent time in prayer while growing
[1:34:26] up number three was the child regularly
[1:34:30] served in church while growing
[1:34:33] up number four was the child listened
[1:34:36] primarily to Christian music while
[1:34:39] growing up so this is all the message he
[1:34:42] said you got to have a church you wither
[1:34:44] away and die he said if you don't have
[1:34:47] the Holy Ghost that rock and roll music
[1:34:49] will get
[1:34:51] them number five was the child
[1:34:54] participated in church mission trips or
[1:34:57] other
[1:34:59] projects number six was the child's best
[1:35:03] friend was an influence on them to
[1:35:06] follow
[1:35:09] Christ you want your kids to be Godly
[1:35:13] get them around Godly
[1:35:21] kids number seven
[1:35:24] spiritual indicator was a childish
[1:35:27] female you sisters got a hand up on
[1:35:33] us number
[1:35:34] eight was the child connected with
[1:35:37] several adults at the church who
[1:35:40] intentionally invested in
[1:35:45] them see it ain't just the parents job
[1:35:49] it's everybody in this Church's
[1:35:52] job to find find a kid and invest in
[1:35:58] them number nine was the parent
[1:36:02] typically asked for forgiveness when
[1:36:04] they messed
[1:36:08] up we don't like doing that in the
[1:36:14] message number 11 for some reason
[1:36:17] another was each additional
[1:36:21] sibling was a spirit ual positive
[1:36:24] indicator so brother Joe keep on going
[1:36:28] buddy the more kids you got the better
[1:36:31] indicator it
[1:36:36] is negative
[1:36:38] indicators was the child did not want to
[1:36:40] go to church as a teen the child was
[1:36:44] rebellious growing up number three was
[1:36:47] the child listened primarily to secular
[1:36:49] popular music and number four was the
[1:36:53] drop in level of family church service
[1:36:55] attendance while growing up we're all
[1:36:59] negative indicators on a child spiritual
[1:37:02] well-being brothers and sisters we're
[1:37:05] Christians tonight this is what we do
[1:37:08] and nothing's more important than
[1:37:11] this he says why uh and what is why is
[1:37:15] it that so many Christians find it so
[1:37:17] hard to live a Christian Life he says
[1:37:18] and they watch and that watch spring
[1:37:21] makes all the rest of the movement M
[1:37:23] just tick just exactly to place keeping
[1:37:27] perfect time when the Holy Spirit is in
[1:37:29] the middle of your spirit it makes every
[1:37:32] action of the Holy Spirit In You tick
[1:37:35] off just exactly according to God's time
[1:37:37] piece the Bible he says you don't lie
[1:37:40] you don't steal you got Associates and
[1:37:43] you're lovely and you got peace Joy
[1:37:45] longsuffering goodness meekness patience
[1:37:48] while all the fruits of the spirit just
[1:37:50] ticks right with that mainspring you see
[1:37:52] what I mean now it's it's the mainspring
[1:37:54] that does it it's the holy spirit that
[1:37:56] does it it's your church that does it
[1:37:58] it's it isn't your it isn't your church
[1:38:00] that it's the holy spirit that does it
[1:38:02] it isn't your church that does it it
[1:38:04] isn't your pastor that does it it isn't
[1:38:06] your shouting that does it it isn't your
[1:38:07] speaking in tongues that does it it
[1:38:09] isn't your healing service that does it
[1:38:11] it's the holy spirit that does it God's
[1:38:15] holy spirit in the middle of your new
[1:38:17] spirit it makes the whole church operate
[1:38:21] just exactly one big bun
[1:38:24] of
[1:38:25] love now just closing just just for can
[1:38:29] I have five more
[1:38:31] minutes can I have five preacher
[1:38:37] minutes just enclosing the Commandment
[1:38:40] was to love the Lord with all your heart
[1:38:44] soul mind and
[1:38:46] strength now he didn't say that for no
[1:38:49] reason see we're a triun being
[1:38:54] Soul Bo spirit and body and he said our
[1:38:58] body it's it's contacted by SE taste
[1:39:00] feel smell in here and that spirit is
[1:39:02] contacted by conscience memory reasons
[1:39:05] affections and imaginations and then he
[1:39:07] said there's a soul in there that that
[1:39:09] only is controlled by faith or
[1:39:12] doubt and Jesus commanded us to love him
[1:39:17] with every one of those
[1:39:20] faculties heart soul mind mind and
[1:39:24] strength thinking man's
[1:39:28] filter he said and that shows that in
[1:39:31] you was that predestinated seed down in
[1:39:34] you that makes you hunger for God so
[1:39:38] you're blessed just to hunger for him
[1:39:41] tonight you're blessed just to have a
[1:39:43] desire that you want more of
[1:39:46] him and he says all the father has given
[1:39:49] me uh all the father has given me has
[1:39:53] given me to redeem they die with me at
[1:39:56] Calvary they raised with me in the
[1:39:58] resurrection and all that he has given
[1:40:01] me will come to me and they'll be placed
[1:40:04] in the body where foot arm nose mouth
[1:40:08] whatever it is they'll be placed in
[1:40:11] there see see God expects all of his
[1:40:14] members to be
[1:40:16] profitable and all the members of our
[1:40:18] body are expected to be profitable also
[1:40:26] he says and they will come to me in
[1:40:28] their Seasons oh my that is that there
[1:40:32] is that real filtration of all the sin
[1:40:36] of the world and the love of the world
[1:40:38] is dead and this soul is drawing only
[1:40:42] one thing here it is do don't remember
[1:40:46] don't forget it so what a prophet says
[1:40:50] remember don't forget it all all you out
[1:40:53] there on the telephones settle this down
[1:40:56] in your
[1:40:57] mind when a thinking man begins to think
[1:41:01] who he's going to stand before and what
[1:41:04] the word of God is when he begins to
[1:41:07] think then when he draws through that
[1:41:10] there's nothing can get to it but the
[1:41:13] Holy
[1:41:15] Ghost what is it it's the germ seed word
[1:41:18] from the beginning that you was in God
[1:41:21] at the beginning standing here drawing
[1:41:23] the seed life the seed is in Your Heart
[1:41:26] by foration Hallelujah the seed is
[1:41:29] already in there by for knowledge of God
[1:41:31] predestinated and when it draws it can't
[1:41:33] draw through nothing else but the
[1:41:36] word and then it's the taste of a
[1:41:39] thinking man the righteous man the holy
[1:41:42] man who sees the Bible that Jesus Christ
[1:41:45] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:41:47] what comes into that place down there it
[1:41:49] that word that's in the heart I've hid
[1:41:53] th th word in my heart that I sin not
[1:41:56] against thee what is it when it's drawn
[1:41:58] through the word there's only one thing
[1:42:00] will pass through the word that's the
[1:42:02] Holy Ghost and there's only one thing
[1:42:05] that can pass through that word it's the
[1:42:06] Holy Ghost and a thinking man's filter
[1:42:09] gives a holy man's
[1:42:12] taste so we take all these circles and
[1:42:15] we draw them three circles brother BR
[1:42:18] said and and and all of these circles we
[1:42:22] have to draw them through the word by
[1:42:25] the holy spirit is that right so so if
[1:42:29] your conscience doesn't pull through
[1:42:31] that filter or if your if your eyes
[1:42:35] can't pull through that filter or if
[1:42:37] your tongue can't pull through that
[1:42:39] filter or if your ears can't pull
[1:42:41] through that filter we got to make that
[1:42:44] right don't we
[1:42:46] now we we got we got contacts to our
[1:42:50] Earthly home see taste feel smelling
[1:42:51] here Saints we got a ser God in every
[1:42:54] one of those faculties we got to we got
[1:42:57] to use these hands to serve the Lord
[1:42:59] with see sometimes we want to serve god
[1:43:01] with our hearts but we don't want to
[1:43:03] give him our eyes or we don't want to
[1:43:05] give him our ears or we don't want to
[1:43:06] give him our
[1:43:08] mouth come on somebody tonight oh my God
[1:43:10] some we want to serve the Lord with our
[1:43:12] heart or maybe we want to serve him in
[1:43:13] our mind but our eyes are looking at
[1:43:15] things they don't need to look at or our
[1:43:17] ears are listening to things they don't
[1:43:19] need to listen to but he wants those too
[1:43:22] he can't you got to pull those through
[1:43:24] that thinking man's filter also you got
[1:43:26] to pull your eyes through it are my eyes
[1:43:28] looking at the word are they looking at
[1:43:31] the promise are they looking at the
[1:43:32] things they need to look at or they
[1:43:34] looking at things that's that's not
[1:43:36] according to the
[1:43:37] word you can have your heart but not
[1:43:39] have your eyes you can have are your
[1:43:42] ears listening to the kind of music they
[1:43:44] don't need to listen to is your mouth
[1:43:46] saying the things it don't need to say
[1:43:48] or is it praising God it's made to
[1:43:50] praise the Lord with he gave us this
[1:43:52] mouth to praise the Lord
[1:43:54] with is it saying amen or is it
[1:43:59] gossiping we got to pull the mouth
[1:44:01] through that thinking man's filter our
[1:44:03] eyes through that thinking man's filter
[1:44:04] our ears through that thinking man's
[1:44:07] filter you hear all kind of stuff amen
[1:44:10] if you don't know it don't pull it
[1:44:12] through your ears if you don't know for
[1:44:14] sure let it
[1:44:18] go but he gave us these ears to hear the
[1:44:22] word with
[1:44:25] he gave us this mouth to preach the
[1:44:28] word we got to pull it through the
[1:44:30] thinking man's
[1:44:32] filter we got to listen to the right
[1:44:34] things we got to let him have our
[1:44:37] heart not just our
[1:44:39] mind we got to let him have our
[1:44:42] conversation we got to let him have all
[1:44:44] these things Philippians 68 says
[1:44:47] Brethren whosoever whatsoever things are
[1:44:50] true whatsoever things are honest
[1:44:53] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[1:44:56] things are pure whatsoever things are
[1:44:59] lovely whatsoever things are of good
[1:45:03] report if there be any virtue if there
[1:45:06] be any
[1:45:08] praise think on these
[1:45:11] things give them your
[1:45:13] mind think on the things of God don't
[1:45:17] think about all this worldly stuff we
[1:45:20] spend all that time you can you can
[1:45:22] change what you think about Saints you
[1:45:24] can choose to think on the things of God
[1:45:29] you can't you can't pull these worldly
[1:45:30] thoughts through a thinking man's filter
[1:45:33] is that right Saints giving you
[1:45:35] reasoning and if you're reasoning he
[1:45:37] said come let us reason together God
[1:45:40] gave us ability to reason so that we
[1:45:42] could reason out this word come let us
[1:45:45] reason together but if our reason is
[1:45:48] contrary to this word you can't pull
[1:45:50] that through a thinking man's filter
[1:45:54] if we could just take one example of
[1:45:56] imagination that's one of the
[1:45:58] contacts to their Spirit you got to
[1:46:01] serve god with that
[1:46:03] also that imagination was given to us to
[1:46:06] serve the Lord with but those
[1:46:09] imaginations bring a man
[1:46:11] down now Romans 1:21 says because that
[1:46:15] when they knew God they glorified him
[1:46:18] not as God neither were thankful but
[1:46:22] became V
[1:46:23] vain in their
[1:46:27] imaginations and their foolish heart was
[1:46:31] darkened now that word vain means
[1:46:33] foolish morally Wicked or
[1:46:36] idolatrous now the word imagination
[1:46:39] comes from the word damos which is also
[1:46:42] the same word as dialogue comes from and
[1:46:46] it's an internal discussion with
[1:46:49] oneself your imagination is an internal
[1:46:54] discussion with
[1:46:59] yourself it's internal consideration or
[1:47:03] reasonings so we see that a person can
[1:47:07] become idolatrous in their
[1:47:11] imaginations in their ideas brother Paul
[1:47:14] read the quote on that that we can allow
[1:47:17] our ideas to become Idols to
[1:47:20] us now the Bible ask the question why do
[1:47:24] the Heathen rage and the people imagine
[1:47:25] a vain thing see God gives us this
[1:47:30] imagination as a means of establishing
[1:47:35] hope not not hope like a verb brother BR
[1:47:38] said Hope was the greatest enemy Faith
[1:47:40] ever had not not hope like I hope God
[1:47:44] can heal me no no no not not not hope
[1:47:47] like I hope I'm going to be saved or I
[1:47:49] hope I'm going to be delivered no that's
[1:47:50] that's an enemy to Faith but hope like a
[1:47:53] noun like like the like like my hope is
[1:47:57] in the Lord the I the hope of our
[1:48:01] calling it's it's a physical thing it's
[1:48:04] a tangible thing hope is real saints
[1:48:07] Hebrews 6 Paul was speaking of the
[1:48:10] promises that God made to Abraham and
[1:48:13] and he said God could not lie and that
[1:48:15] God's promises were certain that's what
[1:48:18] Paul said in Hebrews 6 and then he makes
[1:48:20] this statement which hope we have as an
[1:48:24] anchor to the soul Paul said that those
[1:48:26] promises and the fact that he made those
[1:48:28] promises and the fact that he couldn't
[1:48:30] lie and the fact that he couldn't change
[1:48:33] would it built in us a
[1:48:39] hope so by loving the Lord through our
[1:48:42] imaginations we can have hope now you
[1:48:46] say what are you talking about brother
[1:48:47] George well it's like this Saints I
[1:48:49] don't know for a fact what it looks like
[1:48:51] beyond the curtain of time
[1:48:55] but given the information that I
[1:48:57] have my imagination gives me
[1:49:03] hope I don't know for
[1:49:06] sure what that Holy City looks like but
[1:49:10] I can imagine what it looks
[1:49:12] like and that gives me
[1:49:16] hope I I I don't know for sure what it's
[1:49:20] going to be like when I'm reunited with
[1:49:21] my loved ones one one
[1:49:23] day but I can imagine what it's going to
[1:49:26] be
[1:49:27] like and that gives me
[1:49:30] hope God wants us to serve him with
[1:49:34] every part of our
[1:49:36] being as the musicians
[1:49:46] come sister Sharon you were playing
[1:49:48] there's none like you this morning can
[1:49:50] we just play that
[1:49:53] remember the Rich Young
[1:49:55] Ruler he served the Lord
[1:50:00] mostly he he kept the word of
[1:50:04] God
[1:50:09] mostly he was raised a good
[1:50:12] boy
[1:50:14] mostly but he was lacking one little
[1:50:17] bit he was lacking one little thing
[1:50:21] there was one little part of his life
[1:50:23] that he wasn't willing to
[1:50:26] surrender but the Lord instructed us to
[1:50:30] serve him with all of our
[1:50:33] heart all of our
[1:50:36] soul all of our
[1:50:38] mind and all of our
[1:50:42] strength he let a little part of his
[1:50:45] life become an idol to him you say an
[1:50:47] idol brother George an idol would be
[1:50:49] anything that you would put ahead of the
[1:50:51] Lord
[1:50:53] he let a little part of his life become
[1:50:54] an idol to him he he wasn't willing he
[1:50:57] he was willing to do it mostly but he
[1:50:59] wasn't willing to give God
[1:51:01] everything the money meant more to him
[1:51:05] than eternal life
[1:51:08] did Saints we got to be willing to put
[1:51:10] it all on the table
[1:51:12] today shall we bow our heads and just
[1:51:15] with our heads
[1:51:17] bow Jesus is worth
[1:51:20] more than we're afraid of loseing
[1:51:24] Jesus is worth
[1:51:26] more than we're afraid of Letting
[1:51:32] Go no matter what it
[1:51:34] [Music]
[1:51:36] is eternal life is worth it
[1:51:39] [Music]
[1:51:44] all and maybe we all been
[1:51:47] struggling as we search Our Lives
[1:51:49] tonight we think about these things
[1:51:52] maybe we serve the Lord with our heart
[1:51:54] but maybe we hadn't given him our
[1:51:57] eyes maybe we haven't given him our ears
[1:51:59] maybe we've allowed the devil to use
[1:52:01] those
[1:52:02] ears maybe we've been vain in our
[1:52:05] imagination dreaming of building our own
[1:52:11] kingdom maybe we've let our memory
[1:52:14] betray us kept us from
[1:52:18] forgiving kept us from letting go of
[1:52:20] something
[1:52:22] kept us in a root of
[1:52:25] bitterness maybe our hands have been
[1:52:27] idle we haven't been using them to serve
[1:52:30] him whatever it is
[1:52:34] tonight tonight we want to go all the
[1:52:37] way tonight we want to serve God with
[1:52:41] all of our hearts all of our soul all of
[1:52:45] our mind all of our strength all that's

[1:53:19] all of our hearts all of our soul
[1:53:23] all of our mind all of our strength

[1:53:30] the things of the world we've been

[2:06:22] so can we be thankful as pilgrims like
[2:06:25] Abraham separate herself from the things
[2:06:28] of the world all of our
[2:06:29] Associates Abraham was a pilgrim God has
[2:06:32] separated us from all the dead religions
[2:06:36] I'm speaking Across the Nation and all
[2:06:38] the dead
[2:06:40] Creeds until what separated us and
[2:06:44] opened us a new land a new message for
[2:06:47] this day Pentecost dried up and died
[2:06:51] like Luther Wesley and the rest of them
[2:06:52] it's no more than a bunch of churches
[2:06:54] pulled
[2:06:56] together good people in there yet it's
[2:06:59] got to be come
[2:07:01] out what did he do he opened up the
[2:07:04] Seven Seals of the last
[2:07:06] message did you notice that the Seven
[2:07:10] Seals which all the mysteries of the
[2:07:12] seven church agels are seal with Seven
[2:07:14] Seals the reformers didn't have time to
[2:07:16] do it in their days they didn't live
[2:07:17] long enough but this blessed revelation
[2:07:19] of the Seven Seals it's open to to us in
[2:07:21] this last days from a prophecy that went
[2:07:24] forth to
[2:07:25] Arizona how I ask God why you doing me
[2:07:27] out here in this desert did you know
[2:07:29] Moses wrote the New Testament or the Old
[2:07:31] Testament he certainly did first four
[2:07:34] books gives the laws and everything
[2:07:35] Genesis Exodus Leviticus and
[2:07:37] deom he wrote the Old Testament to do
[2:07:40] that he had to leave all of his
[2:07:41] associates and loved ones and go into a
[2:07:43] desert Paul wrote the New
[2:07:46] Testament that's right he wrote Romans
[2:07:49] Romans and all the rest of there HEB and
[2:07:52] Timothy and so forth and to do that he
[2:07:54] had to separate from himself and go down
[2:07:55] into Arabia into a desert for 3 years
[2:07:59] get the revelation of God all you say
[2:08:01] about Matthew Mark Luke and John they
[2:08:02] were scribes that just wrote what Jesus
[2:08:04] did Paul separated and put the word
[2:08:06] together that's right well then look if
[2:08:09] it taken that and they had to go to a
[2:08:10] desert away their loved ones remember
[2:08:13] what what time is it sir how many you
[2:08:14] ever heard it say Amen was it exactly
[2:08:17] right then we've got the Revelation in
[2:08:19] this last days or the message of the
[2:08:22] Lord God together his bride
[2:08:25] together no other age has it been
[2:08:28] promised it's promised in this age
[2:08:30] Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 St John 14:12 Joel
[2:08:34] 238 those promises are justed exactly
[2:08:37] like John the Baptist identified himself
[2:08:39] in the scripture Jesus identified
[2:08:40] himself what they say way was such a
[2:08:43] person John's a wild man the church
[2:08:46] wasn't able to receive it that's the
[2:08:49] pattern neither will the church receive
[2:08:51] it to days but to the elected God's
[2:08:56] calling Hallelujah to the elected they
[2:08:59] know it amen calling The Virtuous bride
[2:09:02] the word the last day Church the elected
[2:09:05] Lady of our Lord Jesus Christ word if
[2:09:08] Jesus is the word how many believe
[2:09:12] that all right then the bride is always
[2:09:15] part of the bridegroom so the bride will
[2:09:19] not be a denomination it will have to be
[2:09:20] the word
[2:09:22] manifested to be the bride of
[2:09:24] Christ he promised to do it he said how
[2:09:27] he never uses loses his pattern he
[2:09:29] always did it by the pattern he's done
[2:09:31] it every time by the pattern he does it
[2:09:34] again calling out his virtuous bride in
[2:09:36] the last days the lovely Rebecca waiting
