[28:37] Jesus is
[28:40] here God bless you you can be
[28:43] seated 15 years I've seen him move
[28:46] across the land and still they hold
[28:49] theirs you're guilty they took the word
[28:52] that would have brought the church all
[28:54] the churches together and made a great
[28:56] big Union Brotherhood amongst
[28:57] Pentecostals and all the rest of them
[28:59] instead of doing so they rejected it and
[29:01] turned it down made fun of it and called
[29:03] everything out and now by a Federation
[29:06] of church through the devil's plan
[29:08] trying to come in and say now we'll come
[29:10] by some oral they're rejected and it
[29:12] they're guilty of crucifying Jesus
[29:15] Christ amen you take it on God's terms
[29:17] or your terms won't
[29:19] work they rejected God's word made
[29:22] manifest for their Creeds and they're
[29:24] doing the same today he was the word
[29:26] John St John 1 Hebrews 138 says he's the
[29:31] same yesterday today and forever now
[29:33] they are crucifying him
[29:36] aresh did you know the Bible said we
[29:38] could do that how many like to read just
[29:41] a little bit will you give me another 15
[29:42] minutes of it all right let's turn over
[29:44] now just a minute uh crucified aresh
[29:47] let's go over to Hebrews the 6th chapter
[29:49] and read just a little
[29:52] bit Hebrews the 6 and see if we crucify
[29:55] the Son of God AR fresh see if it can be
[29:57] done you say you can't crucify him
[29:59] second time we find out where we can or
[30:01] not God's word's true is that
[30:04] right Hebrews 61 therefore leaving the
[30:08] principles of the doctrine of Christ let
[30:10] us go on to Perfection not into the
[30:13] laying of foundation of repentance and
[30:14] dead Works um and of Faith towards God
[30:18] and of doctrine of baptism laying on our
[30:20] hands and of the resurrection of the
[30:22] dead and of Eternal judgment this we
[30:25] will do if God
[30:27] permits see Paul wants to know that
[30:30] these things here are absolutely
[30:33] essential baptisms laying on a hands
[30:36] Resurrection second coming all these
[30:39] things are Eternal they're absolutely
[30:41] the truth now
[30:43] notice for it is
[30:48] impossible read it with me this one
[30:50] verse I want you to read it with me now
[30:52] the fourth verse for it is impossible
[30:56] for those who were once enlightened and
[30:59] have tasted of the Heavenly gift and
[31:02] were made partakers of the Holy Ghost
[31:05] and have tasted of the good word of God
[31:08] and the power of the world to come if
[31:11] they shall fall away to renew them again
[31:14] unto repentance seeing that they crucify
[31:17] to themselves the Son of God aresh and
[31:20] put him to an open
[31:22] shame is that my word or
[31:25] his a man
[31:28] who comes to a knowledge remember they
[31:30] never got it they were borderline
[31:33] Believers after we have receive the
[31:35] knowledge of the word of God you get it
[31:38] from a knowledge from reading and seeing
[31:41] it and then
[31:44] rejected then you it's impossible for
[31:47] you to ever be saved
[31:49] am do you read that now am have received
[31:54] a knowledge of the truth just you
[31:57] understand you never got it it's like
[31:59] them uh Believers that went out it's a
[32:01] very type of the journey this this this
[32:03] Third Exodus is just a type of the rest
[32:06] of them look look back there let me show
[32:08] you something now just a minute pardon
[32:10] expression look Israel pulled out 12 men
[32:14] one out of each tribe denominational
[32:16] head and took them over to the age of
[32:20] the border the promised land and showed
[32:22] them the good things to come what they
[32:24] had and they come back complain meaning
[32:27] that we wasn't able to do it but there
[32:29] was two out of the 12 Joshua and Caleb
[32:32] said they looked at the word God said
[32:33] it's ours and we are more than able to
[32:36] take it is that right what was that
[32:39] barline believer see they were actually
[32:41] BN in the church they were heads of the
[32:45] people they were Bishops as to say they
[32:49] walked right down to where the word of
[32:51] God was shown to be the truth there is
[32:55] the land they never been there
[32:57] they didn't know it was there but they
[32:59] come down to see it was there there it
[33:01] was and Caleb and Joshua went over and
[33:04] brought back a a bunch of grapes and let
[33:07] them eat some of it and they tasted of
[33:09] the good
[33:10] land and then went back and said we
[33:12] can't do it see we just can't do it
[33:16] here's the same group in the time of
[33:18] Jesus Christ Rabbi we know thou art a
[33:22] teacher come from God see borderline we
[33:26] know th are teacher come from God no man
[33:28] can do the things that you do we
[33:29] recognize that God has to be
[33:32] there why didn't they accept it why
[33:35] didn't they take it
[33:38] borderline borderline here they are on
[33:40] this Third
[33:42] Exodus same sign same manifestation same
[33:47] Christ same Holy Ghost same Works same
[33:52] God same
[33:54] message and they can't take it
[33:57] they'd have to give up their Fellowship
[33:58] card what is it he had a knowledge of
[34:02] the truth they looked and seen that it's
[34:05] absolutely the truth they can't deny the
[34:07] magazines has to testify theyve seen it
[34:10] the pictures the papers the evidence the
[34:13] resurrection of the Dead the doctor
[34:15] statements of the sick they have to say
[34:17] that's
[34:18] him and the predictions not one of them
[34:21] ever failing down through the years
[34:23] every one of them just exactly on the
[34:25] dock amen they can't say but what it's
[34:28] God but they can't accept
[34:31] it a bunch of ministers in Chicago 300
[34:34] and something of us going to come down
[34:35] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[34:36] where they
[34:38] at the price is too great they can't do
[34:42] it what is it the Bible said when they
[34:45] do
[34:46] that what do they do they separate
[34:50] themselves between mercy and judgment
[34:53] for it is
[34:55] impossible for those that were once
[34:58] enlightened has been brought to look at
[35:00] him amen and had a knowledge of the
[35:03] truth and have tasted of the good word
[35:05] of God yes if they return away from it
[35:09] or they have to renew themselves again
[35:11] say well now I will yes you
[35:13] Presbyterians you methodists and
[35:15] Baptists and Lutheran and this Full
[35:17] Gospel businessman stuff saying they're
[35:20] coming
[35:21] in turned away the message your church
[35:24] WIll these individuals in there sure but
[35:27] not the church you have come out of the
[35:28] church to get it right individuals is
[35:31] all right but when you think the
[35:32] Presbyterian Church is going to receive
[35:34] the Holy Ghost and all them take their
[35:35] documents down don't you never think
[35:37] that you think you methodists is going
[35:38] to do it you'll never do it you think
[35:40] you trinitarians ever receive the name
[35:42] of Jesus Christ and be baptized every
[35:43] one of you you'll never do it you'll
[35:46] never do it but individuals will come
[35:48] out and do it that's right that's the
[35:50] satom is coming but them churches who
[35:53] seen the truth and rejected it in their
[35:55] councils it's impossible possible then
[35:58] they're guilty of the crucifixion of
[36:00] Jesus Christ and I indict them by the
[36:03] word of God that God is how do you
[36:05] indict them brother Brandon I indict
[36:07] them that God has clearly identified
[36:09] himself in his word in the last days and
[36:11] made himself to know that he's still the
[36:13] same yesterday today and forever and
[36:14] they've coldly turned it
[36:17] downen Lord and you're guilty of the
[36:20] crucifixion of Jesus Christ by
[36:22] blaspheming the Holy Ghost that's right
[36:26] that's right we take you on to Hebrews
[36:27] 10 again where it tells us again in the

[1:04:36] but they don't know it just as the
[1:04:39] Jewish teachers of his days should have
[1:04:41] known him by his day so is it today of
[1:04:45] God's clearly ad Vindicated word then he
[1:04:47] was the word and he proved he was the
[1:04:51] word he proved he was the word for that
[1:04:53] day
[1:04:55] and God is proven today that he's the
[1:04:57] word of this day the light of the hour

[1:05:18] the days on Earth Jesus said Jerusalem
[1:05:22] Jerusalem how off would I have gathered
[1:05:26] you in one great big group but you would
[1:05:29] not how God has tried in this last days
[1:05:32] and unite his people together but you
[1:05:34] would not you've desired your Creed so
[1:05:37] now you're given over to destruction
[1:05:39] that's what Jerusalem received she is
[1:05:41] tore down burned down she's no more and
[1:05:45] that's exactly what will be some of
[1:05:47] these days to all these big things your
[1:05:49] your big Creeds and denominations will
[1:05:51] die and perish but the word of God will
[1:05:53] be eternal and live
[1:05:56] forever his deepest wounds come from the
[1:06:00] house of so-called
[1:06:02] friends think think of it think of
[1:06:09] it stop I'm waiting a
[1:06:13] minute ministers think of it where did
[1:06:17] his wounds come from the house of his
[1:06:21] so-called
[1:06:22] friends amen as it was so is
[1:06:26] it think of it at Calvary he wasn't
[1:06:29] surrounded by by Savages
[1:06:34] barbarians but of ministers who claim to
[1:06:37] love him and today when the gospel is
[1:06:40] Thoroughly
[1:06:41] identified when the Great Signs of his
[1:06:44] resurrection is proven Among
[1:06:47] Us it isn't the street out there that
[1:06:49] jumps on you it's the so-called
[1:06:53] ministers them exposed to love him is
[1:06:56] what he's surrounded by today we'll not
[1:06:59] have that thing among us we'll not have
[1:07:01] this man rule over us we'll not support
[1:07:03] we'll have no cooperation about that in
[1:07:05] this city if that thing comes this way
[1:07:06] it's nothing but spiritualism it's the
[1:07:09] devil not knowing the word of God the
[1:07:11] blind leading the blind as it was then
[1:07:15] think so is it now just as it was and so
[1:07:19] is it now think his power to heal and to
[1:07:23] set man and woman free from the love of
[1:07:26] this present World from the bobbed
[1:07:28] haired painted Facey Jezebels that calls
[1:07:31] themselves
[1:07:32] Christians and producing such a life as
[1:07:36] that cigarettes smoking dirty joke
[1:07:38] telling sit down and have a missionary
[1:07:41] society and Stitch and sew and talk and
[1:07:43] Scandal and and get out on the street
[1:07:45] and wear shorts and everything like that
[1:07:47] and then call themselves Christians
[1:07:49] before other women that's right you
[1:07:51] remember my story about the slave
[1:07:53] knowing he was a son of a king his
[1:07:56] character what art we to
[1:07:59] be men and women and deny these
[1:08:02] clergymen these pull pits where he gets
[1:08:04] his pierces they po up and endorse that
[1:08:07] kind of living amongst the people or
[1:08:10] they piercing they deny the power to to
[1:08:13] set him free from it and they endorse it
[1:08:16] to be so when it's a contrary to the
[1:08:18] word of God for a woman to Bob her hair
[1:08:21] or to paint her face or to wear shorts
[1:08:25] it's contrary to the word of God but
[1:08:27] they endorse
[1:08:29] it making another Calvary from where
[1:08:33] from the street from the barroom from
[1:08:35] the pull
[1:08:36] pit amen
[1:08:38] ppit and again what was the cry He makes
[1:08:42] himself
[1:08:43] God they denies his deity they try to
[1:08:46] split him up make three or four Gods out
[1:08:48] of him when he is God he was God he'll
[1:08:52] always be God amen the same yesterday
[1:08:55] today and forever when you talk about
[1:08:57] one God to them they laugh at you we
[1:08:59] believe in a Holy Trinity I believe in
[1:09:01] one holy
[1:09:03] God hallelujah his power to heal to set
[1:09:08] free and take these people out of the
[1:09:10] love of the world to free
[1:09:13] them like it did Mary magdalina remember
[1:09:17] she was a little painted up Jezebel too
[1:09:19] she had Seven Devils in her she's a
[1:09:22] strip teas
[1:09:24] just like the modern woman on the street
[1:09:26] today go anywhere you want to look if
[1:09:27] you want believe people bows it's a
[1:09:29] shrine of naked women look out on the
[1:09:30] street today as it was in the days of
[1:09:32] Sodom so shall it be look out if you
[1:09:34] don't believe it just go anywhere open
[1:09:36] up a paper open up a magazine look at a
[1:09:38] billboard what are you
[1:09:40] find remember what it said when the sons
[1:09:42] of God saw the daughters of man was
[1:09:44] Pharaoh they taken un them women look at
[1:09:47] the scandal in England look at the
[1:09:48] Scandal here look at the whole thing
[1:09:50] become a house of prostitution yeah why
[1:09:52] is it why why did Russia become
[1:09:54] communism because of vulgar and
[1:09:56] dirtiness and the non-power of the
[1:09:59] Catholic church that's exactly why this
[1:10:01] nation is taking over communism and the
[1:10:03] Federation of churches and Jing itself
[1:10:05] up with the Catholic Church which
[1:10:06] Communism and Catholicism will unite
[1:10:08] together you know and here they are
[1:10:10] doing it why because they have rejected
[1:10:12] the gospel it separates them and makes
[1:10:14] them a different
[1:10:15] people exactly the reason and ministers
[1:10:18] in the P pits putting up with it for a
[1:10:21] meal
[1:10:22] ticket for a social standing of some
[1:10:25] Creed say I belong to so and so swapping
[1:10:30] education for the power of
[1:10:32] God free them from this mad race like
[1:10:36] Mary magdalina the very power that could
[1:10:38] take that little strip teas on the
[1:10:40] street and make her put on clothes and
[1:10:41] act like a lady make a Christian out of
[1:10:44] her they condemn that power and crucify
[1:10:47] the man that had it at Calvary and
[1:10:51] today the very go goel in the Holy Ghost
[1:10:54] that'll take that little strip tease and
[1:10:56] make her dress like a lady and act like
[1:10:58] a Christian they call it fanaticism
[1:11:01] don't mixed among their congregation get
[1:11:02] us stirred up among them cause other
[1:11:04] women to do it what do they do they as
[1:11:07] it out just like they did then and now
[1:11:09] they crucify the very word and say it
[1:11:11] was for another
[1:11:13] age and died him again yes sir
[1:11:17] than just the same as it is and died
[1:11:20] then the sign that made old Legion put
[1:11:25] on his clothes remember a person that
[1:11:26] takes off their clothes are
[1:11:28] crazy how about a woman Legion was crazy
[1:11:31] he stripped his clothes off of him
[1:11:33] goduck his power and made him put his
[1:11:35] clothes on his clothes in his right mind
[1:11:38] sitting down at the feet of Jesus look
[1:11:40] at the power that made old blind Barney
[1:11:42] mayus to
[1:11:44] see right among their Creeds he was on
[1:11:47] the earth when just much unbelief as
[1:11:48] there is today but it never stopped him
[1:11:51] he went on he didn't pull no punches for
[1:11:53] him
[1:11:54] he told him you're your father the devil
[1:11:56] he condemned the whole
[1:11:58] thing the power that can raise Lazarus
[1:12:01] out of the grave and gave the woman of
[1:12:02] naan back her
[1:12:04] son oh God the power that could do those
[1:12:09] things that could foretell the things
[1:12:10] that happened there's two cult cult tide
[1:12:12] of two ways and all these things that he
[1:12:14] foretold the very man that possess that
[1:12:17] power away with him we won't have him
[1:12:19] among our people he pollutes our
[1:12:20] teachings and they crucified him the
[1:12:23] very same thing today away with the Holy
[1:12:25] Ghost they don't want nothing to do with
[1:12:26] it it condemns and does these things and
[1:12:29] tells our people these things we don't
[1:12:30] want to get mixed among our organization
[1:12:31] is against our Creeds they crucify him
[1:12:34] again oh my notice now as we're closing

[1:15:28] righteous man down Through the Ages so
[1:15:30] do I indict this High
[1:15:33] polished churchgoing bunch of Christ
[1:15:36] rejecting people of this
[1:15:41] day you with your Farms of godliness
[1:15:44] Crucify My Christ the second time by
[1:15:47] telling the people that these words are
[1:15:48] for some other day and it isn't for this
[1:15:50] day I indict you your guilty of the same
[1:15:54] crime that they was on the day of the
[1:15:57] crucifixion repent and turn to God or
[1:16:01] perish and again I say here the churches
[1:16:05] they the teachers crucify by blasphemy
[1:16:09] him the
[1:16:13] word God be merciful let me say that
[1:16:16] again it might have been mixed up on the
[1:16:19] table here the churches
[1:16:24] they the
[1:16:26] clergy crucify by blasphemy him the
[1:16:32] word no wonder it's again mid rendering
[1:16:35] rocking darkening Skies My Savior B his
[1:16:38] head and D but the opening Veil revealed
[1:16:41] the way to Heaven's Joys and endless day
[1:16:46] amen I say on this tape and for this
[1:16:49] audience I say this under the
[1:16:50] inspiration of the Holy Ghost who's on
[1:16:53] the Lord's Side let him come under this
[1:16:58] word God will surely bring this wicked
[1:17:01] Christ
[1:17:02] denying Christ rejecting generation into
[1:17:05] judgment for blasphemy the crucifixion
[1:17:07] of his identified word amen you're
[1:17:11] coming to the Judgment I indicted who's
[1:17:14] on the Lord's Side said Moses let him
[1:17:16] come unto me when the pillar of far
[1:17:18] hanging there is an
[1:17:20] Evidence Hallelujah
[1:17:24] who's on the Lord's Side let him take up
[1:17:26] the word deny his Creed follow Jesus
[1:17:31] Christ
[1:17:32] daily and I'll meet you in the morning
[1:17:35] let's bow our heads now for a word of
[1:17:42] prayer oh Lord
[1:17:45] God The Giver of eternal
[1:17:48] life the author of this
[1:17:51] word who brought again from the dead the
[1:17:54] Lord Jesus who properly identified it
[1:17:57] before a generation of unbelieving
[1:18:02] people it's been long this morning many
[1:18:05] is set here the church is
[1:18:08] packed people are standing
[1:18:11] around and the tapes are being made to
[1:18:14] go out across the world into different
[1:18:16] places ministers will hear this in their
[1:18:19] study I pray for them Lord let these
[1:18:22] words fall deep into the heart cut deep
[1:18:25] cut away all the
[1:18:27] world that they might say like this
[1:18:30] little Methodist Minister down in kenty
[1:18:32] came to me the other day and said when I
[1:18:34] was here in those seven Church Ag and I
[1:18:36] heard it cry out get away from them
[1:18:39] walls of Babylon said I give it up and
[1:18:42] left I don't know which way to go or
[1:18:44] what to do but I
[1:18:46] left blessed be the courage of that
[1:18:48] young man the wife and two three
[1:18:51] children God May many find their way to
[1:18:54] the word of God the only way of life for
[1:18:58] he is the
[1:19:00] word I pray for each one father
[1:19:03] sometimes in seeing these things it's
[1:19:05] not in cruelty it's in love because love
[1:19:07] is corrective Hallelujah and I pray God
[1:19:10] that the people understand it to be that
[1:19:12] way that it is meant to be
[1:19:16] corrected you who had to correct them
[1:19:18] prayed for them at the cross saying
[1:19:22] father forgive they they're blind they
[1:19:24] they just don't understand what they're
[1:19:26] doing I pray for them ministers today
[1:19:28] who's crucifying the word again by
[1:19:31] taking their Creeds and denominations
[1:19:33] and dogmas and substituting it for the
[1:19:36] word of life and then before the people
[1:19:38] they they criticize the real truth that
[1:19:40] God is vindicating to be his
[1:19:43] truth we pray for them Father that you
[1:19:46] will call them to the married supper
[1:19:49] again and may they come this time and
[1:19:52] not find excuses or I realize the last
[1:19:55] call may have already gone it may be too
[1:19:58] late now I trust that it's
[1:20:01] not bless this little congregation
[1:20:03] present here these few hundred people
[1:20:05] that's gathered in here this morning
[1:20:06] this hot day set here for a lengthly
[1:20:09] maybe two hours or more service and

[1:20:15] and listen many of them waiting their
[1:20:17] dinners and the women standing with
[1:20:19] their babies and they're waiting they're
[1:20:22] holding on on to every word Lord I
[1:20:24] realize what will happen to me at the
[1:20:25] day of the Judgment if I mislead those
[1:20:27] people I'm conscious Lord is conscious
[1:20:29] that I can feel that I'm trying to take
[1:20:32] them to the word and let them live by
[1:20:35] the word telling them that you're the
[1:20:37] same yesterday day and forever that the
[1:20:39] great holy spirit is Jesus Christ just
[1:20:42] in the form of the Holy Ghost the same
[1:20:44] man you said so a little while in the
