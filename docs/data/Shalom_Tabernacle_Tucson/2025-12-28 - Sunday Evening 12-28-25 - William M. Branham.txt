Uh we want to continue praying for brother Travis, sister Abigail that God would touch their bodies and make them completely whole. And then uh right now, brother Will, what was his name?

That have mercy on him, Lord, and touch his body and heal him, Lord. I pray, heavenly father. Here tonight, we're with great expectation, Lord, for a spontaneous surge of your spirit into our mortal beings, Lord. Oh God, how we need you, Lord. I was thinking of Esther this day, Lord. How Mori told her that you need to go before the king cuz we're doomed. And Morai told him, she said, "I can't because it's certain death to go before the king without an invitation." And Mori said, "Maybe for this hour you were born for." And that's the way we are, Lord. Oh God. And she went before the king and he extended the supplr to her, Lord. Lord, he she interceded for her for her raise for the Jews, Lord. And we come and intercede for our loved ones, Lord Jesus. our relatives, our loved ones, Lord, my brothers and my sisters, my co-workers, Lord, everybody, Lord, we we intercede like from like Esther there, Lord. Oh, heavenly father, we love you with all our hearts, oh God. Oh Lord, we're looking for I'm looking for a body change, Lord God. You said, prophet said it's not hard to ask for it because it's a promise. So Lord, we're looking for it, Lord. It's the last Sunday of this year, Lord. And oh Lord, we see things happening so fast. Everything just scriptures starting to be fulfilled so fast, Lord. We know that this the Gentile dispensation is going to be closing real soon. And this gospel is going to the Jews, Lord. And but we're your children. We're your blood children, Lord. We We're your chosen. You love us, Lord. And I know you do. You love us, Lord. You chose us for this hour, Lord. We're so grateful, Lord. I love you with all my heart. Be with us tonight. Whatever you have for us, Lord. And brother, be with brother Israel, Lord, of great responsibility on his shoulders, Lord. Oh God, give him peace in his heart, Lord. And give him courage, Lord, to to speak the word, Lord. Take off the gloves and tell us the truth, Lord. I pray thee, we love you and appreciate you, Lord. We commit this service into your hands for your keeping in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Jesus, I just want to thank you. Yes, Jesus. I just want to thank you. Yes, Jesus. I just want to thank you. Want to thank you for being so good. Tell him again, I want to praise you, Lord Jesus. I just want to praise you, Lord Jesus. I just want to praise you, &gt;&gt; Jesus.

Always good to come into his presence to feast on the good things of God. Amen. Certainly enjoyed the service this morning. Always enjoy the presence of the Lord. Amen. Tonight, we're going to finish that tape. We have about um just about an hour or so of the prophet going into that message. He started the scripture in 1 Samuel chapter 8 verses 4 and 10. And I'm going to read that again just to set the tone and he'll get into some greater things for us tonight. And I thank the Lord for each of you. Um, I know some one of the brothers said some really nice things. He loved the message and he likes to hear when I preach too. And I certainly appreciate that. But I know that for believers, we know there's no replacement for the prophet. Amen. And um you know every 20 years, 30 years or so, pastors, they have to leave the scene and um the believers have to continue on and the Lord will raise up someone else and whoever that is, they will be pointing you to the message of the hour. And so we know that the message you can't there's no replacement for that. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so I certainly appreciate the the gifts, all the gifts that God has. I love to hear good preaching and I love to hear the tapes as well and but I don't want because I like to hear good preaching to people to think that I'm have something against the prophet and that's what they try to make you do. Pick one or the other. Uh I love to hear the prophet preach &gt;&gt; and I love to hear good preaching too and they're all in the word of the Lord. because I I don't feel guilty by doing one or the other or we shouldn't. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's God's word, God's blessing to us. And um brother Rick had some things to say at the end of the service there. And I know I put questions in some of your minds in two days or three days. And my position is always that however many days, whatever is to take place, we are commanded to be ready anyways. &gt;&gt; Is that right? And so that's the commandment for the bride is just to be ready. I remember when Y2K hit just before the year 2000 struck. How many were around all the bottled water and the storing up cans and this and that? and how about let's just be ready. And I get the natural element, but really we're believers. And so we thank God he's already called us to be ready. 1st Samuel chapter 8 and verse number 4-10. Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Rama, and said unto him, "Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways. Now make us a king to judge us like all the nations." But the king But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, "Give us a king to judge us." And Samuel prayed unto the Lord. And the Lord said unto Samuel, "Hearken unto the voice of the people, and all that they say unto thee, for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them, according to all the works which they have done since the day I brought them up out of Egypt, even unto this day. wherewith they have forsaken me and served other gods, so do they also unto thee. Now therefore hearken unto their voice, how be it yet protest solemnly unto them, and show them the manner of king that shall reign over them. And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked of him a king. And he said, "This king will be the manner of a king that shall reign over you. He'll take your sons, appoint them for himself, for his chariots to be his horsemen, and some shall run before his chariots." And Samuel continues on in that warning. And uh it's a very uh sobering portion of scripture. It'd be nice for you to continue to read that, get the full context of it. We're going to go right into the message. I'd like to welcome this couple here. I don't know who these folks are. Maybe I know. Do I know you all? No. &gt;&gt; I used to know you. Okay. God bless you. Welcome. All right. Welcome to the house of the Lord. Amen. And so, as we prepare to go to this portion of the message, only believe. We had a visitor this morning. He was from the neighborhood his first time here and he said he wanted to come by and see what was it all about and so he heard why we're against organized religion. So he stayed for the whole thing. So God bless him. Pray for him. I didn't catch his name but he lives here somewhere. So amen. Let's sing that. Only believe. Only believe that all things are possible. Only believe. Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. Only God bless you. You may be seated, brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; The way Moses was. That's the reason he fell ON HIS FACE BEFORE GOD AND SAID, "GOD, YOU SENT ME." HE SAID, "SEPARATE yourself from that bunch." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See what I mean? &gt;&gt; Amen. So always been the thing that twisted man's mind got him off the will of God. Now remember fortold by his word and PROPERLY ABINDICATED BY HIS WORD. Now Jesus SAID IF I DO NOT the works of God then don't believe me. If I miss say who you can condemn me of sin, &gt;&gt; who you can show me that I'm an unbeliever. Nicodemus said, "We know you're a rabbi. You come from God because nobody could do those things unless God was with him." So he surely he was a believer. Now we who know church history, now put on your thinking caps. &gt;&gt; It's not late yet. So, just listen real close now. And I'll try to be just quick as I can. I I won't listen close to the tape. Now, anyone who's ever read church history knows that the first time that Christianity was ever organized was the Roman Catholic Church. &gt;&gt; Now, if there's any time before that, I want somebody to bring the history and show me. I'm a bosom friend of Paul Boyd. Many great historians. I've got in my study there the postNE council, the Nyian council, Nyine fathers, all the sacred writings of the church that I know of. 33 years I've studied them, looked over them. There was never an organization. The Catholic Church is a mother of organizations. &gt;&gt; We know that. That's the truth. Never was a church organized. had a denomination until the Catholic Church and the word Catholic means universal and they made a state church religion and made it over all the dominion of Rome and it had about the be best part of the world conquered at that time. It was a state church and those who would not obey it was put to death. the NSA council 15 days of bloody battle when real prophets of God when they stood up there on those that Catholic church why it first started while we all know it I've taught it here &gt;&gt; how really Aquilla Priscilla was a pastor Aquilla was a pastor of of the Roman church when the Holy Ghost fell on Pentecost it fell on the Jews out of every nation under heaven but a few days after that Peter had a vision on the housetop to go up to Carneliuses, a Roman, a just man, and he prayed and the Holy Ghost fell on him. After while the dignitaries begin to receive it, Aquil and Priscilla went into into uh Rome and they organized or never organized but set in order the first Roman church. And when they did, they had their their brethren and sisters and Claudius in his reign excommunicated all Jews from Rome. And that's the very time that the Roman Catholic Church said Peter was in Rome. Show me one scripture where Peter ever was in Rome. &gt;&gt; Or any history that says he was he wasn't according to the word of God. And that's what I believe. And how could Peter, a Jew, ever put up with idolatry and stuff that they have of worshiping idols and things? &gt;&gt; How would he go against his own teaching here? Amen. &gt;&gt; Nonsense. &gt;&gt; No more than that than the Protestant is too. &gt;&gt; We'll get to it in an extra while &gt;&gt; by and by. The Lord willing. Notice &gt;&gt; notice. Now we find out that the very time that the church says that Peter was in Rome, the history says that Claudius and the Bible said also had ordered all Jews out of Rome. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Paul passed through Ephesus and come to the upper coast there. He finds these disciples and they had been up there visiting Aquilla and Priscilla after their going away. Then the Roman brethren in this church begin to form their own ideas and they added idolatry. And then Constantine which is mother was a real Christian and hoped her boy would be but he was a politician AND HE SAW THAT most of Rome or a big part of it of the poor class had already accepted salvation through Christ. And then they would begin to come very popper because they were taking down Venus and putting up Mary and taking down Jupiter and putting up Peter and so forth like that and and the disciples and it was a very popular religion AND THEY WERE GALLANT THEY AND CHRISTIANS WOULD DIE. The Catholic Church said we were the beginning that's exactly the truth. The Catholic Church begin at the day of Pentecost. But here's WHAT GOT HER OUT. SHE organized and ejected from the word dogmas. And the latest dogma, you people over 10 years old can remember the latest dogma, the ascension of Mary &gt;&gt; about 10 years ago. Another dogma added to the church. Instead of scripture, IT'S DOGMA. And they'll give you understand right now. THEY DON'T CARE WHAT THE SCRIPTURE SAYS. It's what the church says. They a priest told me, HE SAID, "GOD IS IN HIS CHURCH." I SAID, "GOD IS IN HIS WORD." &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, that Bible is just the history of THE EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH." I SAID, "DAN, I'm an early Catholic." &gt;&gt; I said, "That makes me more Catholic than you being a priest." &gt;&gt; I said, "If that's it, then I'm that." I said, "You see, I BELIEVE EXACTLY WHAT THE APOSTLES TAUGHT. YOU BELIEVE WHAT MAN IS INJECTED into it." &gt;&gt; And that's exactly the way it went. &gt;&gt; Sure it was. It went that exactly that way. Now, notice history. Then they begin to add dogmas. Dalma. AND WHEN PAUL came over, we know according to history THAT HE DID NOT EVEN VISIT that first church because he could not stand idolatry. And he visit the second church which they had established. Second church of Rome. And when that n see a council come where Constantine seen the idea to unite his kingdom, the very same thing Ahab did with Jezebel marrying down there. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, and when he seen a chance to unite his people and MAKE A GREAT POWERFUL nation out of it, he thought they'd get their religion. So he made him A CHURCH STATE RELIGION. And when they had that nasty council and these questions come up, whether there was one God or three, whether they should baptize in the name of Jesus Christ or father, son, holy ghost, all these other questions brought the the showdown in there. And when it did, some of them old prophets COME UP OUT THERE WITH NOTHING BUT SHEEP SKIN WRAPPED AROUND THEM AND EATING HERBS, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BUT THEM BIG DIGNITARIANS THAT HAD ALREADY WORKED THEIR WAY INTO THE CHURCH, SHUT THEM UP WITH WORLDLY WISDOM, BUT THEY HAD THUS SAYETH THE LORD. &gt;&gt; She went into pagan darkness for about a thousand years, but she broke forth again to bloom. That's right. You can't kill it. I will restore, sayeth the Lord, all the years these things them denominations added dogma. AND TO DO THIS, to add dogma, the only way that any church, the only way that any DENOMINATION CAN EVER GET AWAY FROM THE WORD OF GOD IS TO ADD DOGMA INSTEAD OF THE sacred scriptures. is to try to make your tradition OR THE DOCTRINE OF YOUR CHURCH GO BE CONTRARY TO THE SCRIPTURES. THEN HOW CAN YOU CONDEMN THE CATHOLIC church when you're doing the same thing they did? &gt;&gt; Do you understand? &gt;&gt; All right. When I think the scriptures can't fail, &gt;&gt; DOGMAS IS A LIE TO BEGIN WITH. And when YOU ACCEPT THE DENOMINATION, YOU'VE ALREADY GOT A &gt;&gt; DOCUMENT &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING ADDED. IT'S NOT IN THE SCRIPTURE. &gt;&gt; LORD, HELP. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT IN THE SCRIPTURE. &gt;&gt; There's no such a thing as organization. Jesus never said, "I commission you to go into all the world, make organization." No, sir. No such a thing. To do this is to reject the sacred scriptures. When this was done, it was changed from church by birth to CHURCH BY DOGMA AND CREED. NOT CHURCH, let me apologize, lodge. &gt;&gt; You're born into the church, but you join a lodge. &gt;&gt; IT ISN'T BAPTIST CHURCH, METHODIST CHURCH, Pentecostal church. It's Baptist lodge, Pentecostal lodge, &gt;&gt; and Methodist lodge. &gt;&gt; You join them. You can't join church. &gt;&gt; There's no such A THING. YOU'RE BORN INTO IT. &gt;&gt; Nicodemus is told that. &gt;&gt; So you see where you're at. Oh my. That's why I'm against it. Not against the people in it. The system that I'm against. Cuz they can't one of them elders or something, one of them churches preach something that's in the Bible. It's contrary to that doctrine, that uh charter that they have in that church. He's excommunicated right like that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Some of them so nasty they won't even let a revival come to another church unless it be one of their own man. &gt;&gt; While there's a somebody one time was going to give a preacher right here in this country, a little old preacher stand out on our street crying and begging for repentance and saying, "COME RECEIVE CHRIST. BE FILLED WITH THE Holy Ghost." and things like that. And someone out of a Pentecostal organization come up and give a man a dollar in his hands and had to go repent because he committed adultery against his church. Talk about Catholic. &gt;&gt; That's right. You know what I'm talking about, too. This church does anyhow. All right. Does this reject the scriptures? When this is done, it is changed. Then when you add dogma and join an organization, you have automatically re accepted your first dogma because it's not scriptural. So it's something added and a dogma is something added take place of it's taking place of the birth. When you accept the denomination, you have added dogma. All right. When this is done, then it's changed from church by birth to lodge by dogma or creed. &gt;&gt; For see, it's dogma in itself, not think scripturally. Now, Jesus never said, "Go into all the world and make denominations. Go organize the people together." He said, "Go make disciples." &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you see, you're all together. Listen, watch here. Let's close it on something here. Drive something down tight right this time. How many has a Greek leon? The emphatic dialogue from the old manuscript. Greek. All right. Read it. Get any scholar that you want to get into the library and get the lexon, Greek lexon, read Revelation 17. And when you read there, the King James version here says, "And this, he carried me away in the spirit, and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet clothed beast full of of names of blasphemy." Now, that's what the King James said, but the original interpretation said, "Carry me away in the spirit, and I saw a woman full of blasphemous names." &gt;&gt; There's a whole lot of difference between names of blasphemy and blasphemous names. Now, watch, we all understand and know that that was the Roman church sitting on seven hills, controlling the powers of the world. And she was called a &gt;&gt; And she was a mother of harlots. &gt;&gt; What? What is a harlot? Could it be a man? Has to be a woman. &gt;&gt; So if it's a woman, it has to be a church. &gt;&gt; She was a mother of harlots the same as she was. &gt;&gt; And look, watch in her. Let it soak. in her was blasphemous names. What is it now ministers here and on the tape? Let's hold your peace. WHAT IS THOSE blasphemous names? Methodists, Baptist, Presbyterian, Lutheran, Pentecostals, SO FORTH. BLASPHEMOUS NAMES BECAUSE IT'S ORGANIZATIONS HOARD THEM TO GOD JUST LIKE SHE WAS. AND they in THOSE GROUPS OF PEOPLE SAY, "WELL, HE'S A METHODIST AND DO THIS. HE'S PENTECOSTAL AND DOES THIS. HE'S PRESBYTERIAN and does this." They do everything on the calendar. You know that. &gt;&gt; And what is it? IT'S NAMES THAT OUGHT TO BE CHRISTLIKE AND CALLED BY THE NAME OF CHRISTIAN AND IT'S blasphemous names. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT CHURCHES. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE FALSELY CALLED CHURCH. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE LODGES. Now you see why I'm against organization not the people the system of organization &gt;&gt; the blasphemous names watch of LODGES FALSELY CALL CHURCHES Methodist church Baptist church Presbyterian church Pentecostal church Lutheran church United BRETHREN CHURCH THERE'S NO SUCH THING &gt;&gt; THAT'S UNSCRIPTURAL &gt;&gt; THERE'S ONLY ONE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; AND YOU CAN'T JOIN IT. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE BORN INTO IT. YOU'RE PREDESTINATED TO IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE MYTHICAL BODY OF JESUS CHRIST. THE MYSTICAL BODY RATHER OF JESUS CHRIST HERE ON EARTH WITH THE WORD BEING MADE MANIFEST. &gt;&gt; Sons and daughters of God. They belong to none of come out from among us. &gt;&gt; Watch quickly now. I don't want to tire you, but if you just give me a few more minutes now, &gt;&gt; I'll go as quick as I can, but I want you to be sure to get it so that you won't miss it. Remember, mother Rome was found in her floral OF BLASPHEMOUS NAMES, a mother of harlots. THEN IF THEY ARE HARLOTS, WHAT IS A HARLOT? What is a Same thing as a harlot. &gt;&gt; It's a woman that lives untrue to her marriage vow. &gt;&gt; And any church that claims to be the church OF CHRIST AND DENIES GOD'S WORD, SHE'S UNTRUE TO HER MARRIAGE BACK. &gt;&gt; THEN SHE COMMITS ADULTERY BY ADDING DOGMA, HOARDING THEM WITH THE WORLD AND HER WISDOM INSTEAD OF ACCEPTING CHRIST AND THE POWER OF his ghost. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And she's a mother of harlots that done the same thing. &gt;&gt; Pop don't call kidd greasy. You know, &gt;&gt; see, six of one, half a dozen the other. Some of these people run along just making fun of the Catholic and belong to one of the same thing themselves. &gt;&gt; She was a mother of the false baptism and water. Amen. &gt;&gt; She's a mother of the false evidence of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you follow her right along with her. &gt;&gt; Now, let's see. Is that true, Brother Brandham? Hold your peace just a moment. &gt;&gt; See, she is the mother of blasphemous names of lodges that the people has joined and bring a reproach. Live anyway. Wear shorts. Women with bobbed hair painted up, &gt;&gt; sing in choir, smoke cigarettes, take communion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All kinds of filth of the world. It's a stumbling block &gt;&gt; to the unbeliever. &gt;&gt; Didn't Timothy speak of it the Holy Spirit? &gt;&gt; Watch. See, she Rome is the MOTHER OF EVERY ONE of them. See, you did exactly in your organization just like what she did. Inject dogmas instead of the word because a group of man said it together. The preseters and the bishops and so forth had to be this way. And that's exactly what took place at Rome. &gt;&gt; And you try to, my pastor, brother, accept the full word of God. And look where you go. &gt;&gt; Right out the door. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we'll see if God told you to or not in a few minutes. See? &gt;&gt; All right. See, she's a mother of everyone because she was the first one to take away the writings of the scripture and add DOGMA BECAUSE SHE REJECTED ANOINTED PROPHETS WHO HAD THE VINDICATED life of the word &gt;&gt; for their intelligence, smart man, Roman emperors and so forth that had accepted Christianity but won't accept it in their own way. See, that's right. They want it in your own way. Non wanted to get rid of his leprosy in the waters of his own country. He didn't like the muddy waters of Jordan. But if you ever get rid of his leprosy, he had to walk out there in that mud just exact like the prophet told him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God don't have respected person. &gt;&gt; Notice she is the first denomination. Look at her daughters done the same thing. Added creeds and dogmas instead of the word. Don't tell me. Show me one that's not off of it. &gt;&gt; Show me one pastor that'll accept the truth that they won't turn you out on it. &gt;&gt; Unless you're so popular that you know they have to hold on to you for your popularity or something. It's all right. Now look at Revelations 18 just for a few minutes. The next verse over the next chapter after Revelation 17 had explored and and had showed the mystery of this misdablin. The 17th chapter of Revelations explains that she is a church that sits on seven hills, &gt;&gt; the Vatican City and rules all the kings of the earth. That's exactly what's right in the president's too and so forth. &gt;&gt; So, um, &gt;&gt; but she's there holding the wealth of her world in her hand. Exactly. Who's able to make war with her? That's &gt;&gt; right. We all know that. But why would you belong to something that's connected with her? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now notice in the 18th chapter, the very next chapter after her mystery has been explained sits in the temple of God. Now here are the Zella Breakman. Are you here tonight Zella? She brought it's in the room in there now. our Sunday visitor the Catholic paper and the Catholic paper was answering a minister said did you say reverend that did the u in the Roman numeral over the Vatican or over the pope's throne is written vicarious filillion which it means that it in the catholic dascese there that that is the the number of the beast of the apocalypse why he said certainly it It's exactly spells out 666. It's exactly and the Roman dascese admitted that it does. But here's their answer. Smart, full of wisdom. Said, "But you know your name in a certain language might spell out the same thing." This man said, "Mine almost the same thing in some language." He spelled it out. Said, "See, I'm almost 666, too." Said, "There's been hundreds of them." said, "Every time anything raises up, somebody's got a 666." And said, "Rever, did you know in one language your own name might spell out Antichrist?" said, "Why do you look at such things that look at the wisdom, but the Holy Spirit knows better?" Watch &gt;&gt; that might be my name might spell out 666, but I don't meet the rest of the qualification. If I don't set up on a hill, I don't say these things. I'm not a governor or nothing. That's right. That's the one he's talking about. &gt;&gt; So your worldly wisdom comes to nothing, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. In the presence of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't meet the rest of it. But he does. Sets in the temple of God showing himself he is God and sets on seven hills. I don't sit on seven heels and death spell 666. I don't meet the rest of it, but he does. See, there you are. See? So, we rely on the Holy Spirit. Take no thought what you're going to say because it's not you that speaks. It's the father. So how can your wisdom and your new birth from above ever compare with these things here on earth? These we mighty magicians in it while they know every LITTLE CROOKED CORNER. HOW COULD MOSES STAND WHEN HE FOLLOWED THE COMMANDMENTS OF GOD TO THROW DOWN HIS STICK AND IT TURNED INTO a serpent and here come the magicians UP AND DONE THE SAME THING. But Moses stood still knowing he'd follow the word of God and his serpent eat the rest of them up. &gt;&gt; When you've obeyed and got what could he DO WHEN HE LED HIM TO THE LAND OF PROMISE and there WAS A RED SEA BOBLING them in but God's path went right through it. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SAID STAND STILL AND SEE THE GLORY OF GOD. &gt;&gt; When it's in a path of duty of following the word, stand there and watch it open up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm 53 years old. Been serving him for about 33 years. Wish I had 10 million years to serve him. I've never seen him fail yet &gt;&gt; when his word is kept. That's right. Now look, immediately after her sin, her secrets was discovered. We've had that a long time ago. We know it. Now, the next chapter, look at Revelations 18. May I just turn to it just a minute? It might be a good thing. It won't take us but just a few minutes longer. might mean a little something to you. I hope it does. &gt;&gt; Now, we see here in the 17th chapter, the fifth verse, upon her forehead was a name written, Mystery Babylon, the great the mother of harlots, the abomination of the earth. And watch. And I saw the woman church drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her, I wondered with great admiration. See see she is such a great beautiful thing and she was a mother of prostitutes prostitute religion denominations exactly what she did see because they injected dogmas just like she did now look look at revelations now that's the 17th chapter ends up in the 18th verse now watch after these things after her mystery was discovered after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven having great power now Here comes another messenger coming down next chapter. Her mystery was discovered. Now this is now the discovery of her mystery and her children's mystery. See, we understand now exactly what made her a harlot because she committed ADULTERY AGAINST GOD'S WORD. And that's what made her an organization. She couldn't stay a Bible church and accept that. And neither can any organization THAT DON'T TAKE EVERY WORD OF IT AWAY IT'S WROTE ever be a Bible church. &gt;&gt; And there's none of them that way &gt;&gt; that I know anything about not a one. So there see she organizes the things she does &gt;&gt; both by the scripture and by evidence. She dies right there. She accepts the dogma. Now look, now that's what happened. God sent in this 18th chapter a mighty angel. After that mystery was known, a mighty angel or a messenger. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Watch here. After these things, I saw another angel come down from heaven with great power. And the earth was lightened by his glory. And he cried with a loud voice, babbling, confusion, the great is falling. and is become the habitation of devils, the whole of every foul spirit, and a cage of ever clean and hate unclean and hateful bird. And all nations have drank of the wine of the wrath of her fornications, and the kings of their committed fornications with her, and the merchants of the earth has waxed rich through the abundance of her desolence. Look, immediately after her mystery was made known, who she was, what she was, who her daughters was, the mysteries BEEN MADE KNOWN, THEN GOD sent an angel, a messenger. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; TO WHAT? &gt;&gt; CALL OUT. &gt;&gt; Come out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour. AMEN. &gt;&gt; COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; That she be not partakers of her plagues. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's going to curse her. &gt;&gt; WATCH. &gt;&gt; COME OUT OF HER. GOD SENT A MANY MIGHTY ANGEL OR A MESSENGER. AND HIS LIGHT WASN'T IN A CORNER. IT'S SCATTERED OVER THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; COME OUT OF HER. WHAT? &gt;&gt; Her and her sisters, too. TO LIGHTEN THE EARTH AND CALL HIS PEOPLE OUT OF HER. &gt;&gt; NOW, you know that's the truth. &gt;&gt; The name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; A messenger was sent from heaven &gt;&gt; TO CALL GOD'S PEOPLE OUT OF BABYLON. &gt;&gt; AND HIS LIGHT LIGHTED THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; GREAT Holy Spirit. NOTICE &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS SHE IS A CAGE AND HAS CAUGHT hateful unclean birds. &gt;&gt; Not eagles now. No, no, no. &gt;&gt; Vultures. &gt;&gt; UNCLEAN, HATEFUL BIRDS. THAT'S WHAT SHE'S CAGED UP AROUND HER. SHE IS A CAGE FULL OF THEM. &gt;&gt; A WHOLE CAGE FULL WITH WHAT? BLASPHEMOUS NAMES. &gt;&gt; CONTRARY TO THE SCRIPTURE. &gt;&gt; SECOND TIMOTHY 3 SAID THE HOLY SPIRIT SPEAKING IN THE LAST DAYS THEY WILL DEPART FROM THE FAITH and give heed to seducing spirits. IT ALSO SAID THE HOLY SPIRIT SPOKE THAT IN THE LAST DAYS THEY'D BE HEADY, HIGHMINDED, HATEFUL, Bless God, you belong to us OR YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR NAME ON OUR BOOK, YOU'RE LOST, &gt;&gt; HATEFUL, UNCLEAN, &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not hurting. I hope I'm doing good. &gt;&gt; Hateful, unclean birds. SHE CAGED THEM. &gt;&gt; REMEMBER, GOD IS AN EAGLE. HE CALLED HIMSELF AN EAGLE. &gt;&gt; AND HE CALLED JACOB AN EAGLE. &gt;&gt; AND WE ARE HIS EAGLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE CALLED HIS PROPHETS EAGLES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THIS ANGEL COME DOWN TO EXPOSE &gt;&gt; AND TO CALL OUT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LIKE MY LITTLE MESSAGE ON THE EAGLE STIRS your nest. That little old eagle had been following that OLD HEN AROUND IN THE BARNYARD all the time, clucking around, but he couldn't eat that stuff that she had. Socials and painted face women, bobbed hair and shorts. He couldn't do that. But he DIDN'T KNOW NOTHING ELSE BUT THE CLUCK OF THAT OLD H. &gt;&gt; But one DAY THE MOTHER EAGLE FOUND HIM. &gt;&gt; She screamed, &gt;&gt; CALLING HIM OUT, &gt;&gt; SAID, "SON, YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THEM. &gt;&gt; COME OUT OF HER. SAID, "MAMA, WHAT CAN I DO?" SAID, "FROP YOUR WINGS AND STARTLE." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; The first jump HE HIT ON A POST RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A ORGANIZATION SAID, "SON, you'll have TO COME HIGHER IN THAT EARTH. CAN'T CATCH HIM." &gt;&gt; Got to get your feet off the ground. &gt;&gt; She's going to take him on a flight. &gt;&gt; He found out he could fly. She come to call him out. That's right. But this mother Bablin had called herself a bunch of chickens, &gt;&gt; slick chicks, &gt;&gt; painted up, bobbed hair, call themselves Christians. &gt;&gt; She got a cage full of them. &gt;&gt; You preachers that STAND IN THE PULL PIT AND LET THEM WOMEN GET BY THAT. SHAME ON YOU. &gt;&gt; To make your denominational more. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD WILL REQUIRE THAT OF YOUR HAND. AMEN. &gt;&gt; COME OUT OF IT. &gt;&gt; My sheep hear my voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A cage of hateful, heady, highmounted, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. Got to be like the world and to be like Christ. &gt;&gt; When you see a woman with a lot of makeup on, it goes to show she's empty inside. &gt;&gt; She's false inside. It's exactly right. If the woman I seen one the other day with a green hair, right? And all that green stuff under their eyes. Now, if you I if you didn't have any hair and and you wanted to wear some hair, it' be all right. But wear one that look like human and if you didn't have any fingernails and and you wanted to get some fingernails, don't get them like hollers off of Navy Beans. Get them get real fingernails. IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANY OF THESE THINGS, it's all right. IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANY TEETH, GET YOU SOME. If they make you some, get them. BUT DON'T PULL YOUR GOD-GIVEN TEETH OUT JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE A LITTLE crooked and they're good teeth to get some. &gt;&gt; DON'T DYE YOUR HAIR SOMETHING LOOK LIKE something you come out of a some mirror somewhere. &gt;&gt; Don't if you're colorless and you want TO MAKE YOURSELF LOOK LIKE YOU GOT SOME COLOR, IT'S all right, I imagine. BUT DON'T MAKE YOURSELF LOOK LIKE JEZEBEL, &gt;&gt; like a barn somewhere &gt;&gt; being painted. &gt;&gt; And you Pentecostal brethren, letting them women cut their hair &gt;&gt; when the Bible said that's her glory. &gt;&gt; And it's even uncommon for her to pray with her hair like that &gt;&gt; and let let her come up in the pulpit and preach the gospel, sing in a choir, &gt;&gt; teach a Sunday school. Shame on you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Been ashamed of yourself. &gt;&gt; Why am I against the organization? You think I could ever cater to something like that? I know the reason you do it, brother. You know better. But if you teach against that, you'll be turned into the headquarters and they'll excommunicate you. Bless God for your courage if you'll do it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. God will honor you. What did THIS ANGEL SAY? COME OUT OF HER. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. This angel came to the earth and he'd come to bring the light and he shine the light around the world. He was a mighty angel and he come to proclaim THE MESSAGE OF COME OUT OF BABYLON. &gt;&gt; Touch not our unclean things. Got a whole cage full of them. Said she's a cage of every hateful bird. Yes, she got a cage full of them now. The World Council of Churches or lodges, she got the whole bunch caged up now. They're all coming together. &gt;&gt; She become a cage. All right. full of hateful birds. That's right. Try to talk to one of them one time. &gt;&gt; Just try it. Boy, smart in the world's wisdom, but know more about God than a rabbit does about snowshoes. That's That's right. Just that's just it. See, just all they know is some wisdom. They can put this and do that and there, but when it comes to knowing him, &gt;&gt; Yeah. got caught in her cage with her dogmas. The Protestant churches begin the same and become her daughters. Cause this by denying the word of God that she does. She denies the word. And when you accept something else instead of the word, you deny it yourself. And when you join up in one of them, you've also denied the word. &gt;&gt; God don't want you that way. No place of it for the scripture. Notice this is the angel of light. Remember the last angel. It's the angel in the church age to the lady OA. It's the lady OA messenger that it's the last because the very next chapter is the 19th chapter which is a coming bride &gt;&gt; and this is in THE SCRIPTURE. THE LAST ANGEL THAT CAME TO BRING LIGHT BEFORE THE COMING OF THE BRIDE, the god is a lady I see in church age. &gt;&gt; What was THE LADY OF SEEING CHURCH AGE MESSENGER CALLING HIM OUT OF ADAM? &gt;&gt; LOOK churches caught in her cage with her with her dogmas denying the word and accepting dogmas. This is the angel of light to the lady of sin church THAT HAD REJECTED CHRIST AND HIS WORD for dogma and had put him outside and he stood at the door knocking trying to get in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The church age had rejected THE CHRIST AND CHRIST IS THE WORD and had REJECTED IT AND HE WAS ON THE OUTSIDE. THE ONLY CHURCH age that we have of Christ on the outside knocking trying to get in. &gt;&gt; AND THIS ANGEL'S MESSAGE messenger come from God WAS ECHOING HIS MESSAGE ON THE EARTH TO COME OUT OF Babylon come out of the organizations. The Holy Spirit today, the manifestation of THE HOLY SPIRIT IS THAT ANGEL TRYING TO GET THE PEOPLE BACK TO THE word &gt;&gt; because the Holy Spirit will only vindicate the word. It can't vindicate dogmas. &gt;&gt; There's no life in him. He's lying. &gt;&gt; Notice the lady of St. Church had denied him, rejected him, and he put him on the outside. Notice this angel is the last messenger before the coming of Christ in the 19th chapter of Revelations. The messengergers's voice, if we notice, when he gave his voice on the earth, there was a voice echoed again in heaven. Fourth verse, if you want to read it. All right. Fourth verse, the 19th chapter. This messenger on the earth WAS SO INCLINED WITH GOD UNTIL WHEN HE SPOKE IT ON THE EARTH. GOD ECHOED THE SAME THING OUT OF HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THAT FOURTH VERSE TRANSLATION? WHAT DOES IT MEAN? GOD'S VOICE SPEAKING TO HIS PREDESTINATED PEOPLE SAYING, "Come out of her." Just exactly what the voice was. &gt;&gt; He's got people all out in there, all out THROUGH BABYLON. COME OUT OF HER &gt;&gt; that she be not partakers of her sins. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. OUT OF THAT DOGMA AND CREEDS TO THE WORD MADE SPIRIT AND LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Notice the 19th chapter is the next. After these things. Did you notice her in the 19th chapter? After these things. Watch what? After what? If the message had come out of her. After these things, WATCH IS THE SHOUT OF THE BRIDE SAINTS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WITH THE BRIDEGROOM GOING TO THE MARRIAGE OF THE LAMB. &gt;&gt; How close are we then, brethren? &gt;&gt; WHAT'S THE LAST CALL? COME OUT OF BABYLON. &gt;&gt; NOW, my brethren, that's the reason I'm against it. It's unscriptural. It's unorthodox. It's been proven to be false. &gt;&gt; God is not in it. He never was. He never will be. &gt;&gt; I ain't saying there's not people in these organizations. That's what the church is made up of. But as long as you stay into that system, you're part of it. &gt;&gt; If I stay in the United States, I'm an American. &gt;&gt; As long as I'm a citizen or a member of this United States, I'm part of it. If I go to Germany and deny my membership here and my citizenship, I take out citizenship in Germany, I'm no more an American. I'm a German. And if I go to Japan or wherever Russia, I became a citizen there. AND WHEN YOU JOIN UP WITH A CITIZEN, a system, AND BECOME A CITIZEN OF THAT SYSTEM, YOU'RE SHOWING WHAT YOU ARE. AND IN THIS LAST DAYS, GOD IS CALLING THE PEOPLE OUT OF IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE said so. &gt;&gt; Come out of her that you be not partakers with her &gt;&gt; and I will receive you. Touch not her unclean things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I will receive you and you'll be sons and daughters to me and I'll be god to you. That's the reason I have spoke against the church. the the lodge. I can't call it a church. There's only one church. That's the church of the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; But these lodges, it's called church. My Bible tells me that they are blasphemous names. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All of them. All organizations. What are they blaspheming? Blasphemia is to be contrary to or speak against. When God says come be born and they say come join. See, when the baptisms of the spirit is falsely tuck over for a wafer in the Catholic church, a handshake in the Protestant church, in an emotion in the Pentecostal church, instead of the person of Christ, &gt;&gt; coming in with all that pyramid building we had the other day, &gt;&gt; add to your faith virtue and so forth. all this in first Peter the first uh second Peter be the first chapter where it's all added to your faith all these things godliness and purity and holiness and everything and then you're sealed by the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; but it's just like somebody they people claim to have this when they haven't &gt;&gt; because they've been falsely taught &gt;&gt; the Methodists get a funny feeling used to it shake a little bit or or dance in the spirit the Pentecostals speak with tongues or or do something emotional. I believe those things CERTAINLY, BUT THOSE THINGS WITHOUT THESE OTHERS IS NO GOOD. &gt;&gt; As I said, it's like a peacock or a blackbird trying to put peacock feathers in himself. &gt;&gt; Or a buzzard trying to use dove feathers. They never grow there. HE PUSHED THEM INSELF. They're planted. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE DENOMINATION. BUT WHEN GOD PUTS ANYTHING IN THERE, IT'S NATURAL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You make yourself say, "I joined church last night. I can't go no more. I can't drink no more. I can't do this. I join church. See, you're trying to put peacock feathers in your buzzard carcass. That's right. See, YOU'VE GOT TO BE BORN AGAIN. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO RECEIVE CHRIST. AND WHEN YOU RECEIVE CHRIST, YOU CAN'T RECEIVE CHRIST WITHOUT RECEIVING HIS WORD BECAUSE HE IS THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And when you have a form of godliness and deny that, then I wonder. &gt;&gt; See, and you can still belong to all the organization you want to and have a form of godliness and still don't have it. Now, there you are, friends. There's the whole thing. God bless you. God help you. I don't say this to be different. I'm explaining myself. This being Armisters's days, I'm not signing a treaty of peace with you ministers. Not at all. I think you ought to come sign with me. Not with me, but with God. The word. That's right. That's right. Say what the Bible says. Say it the way it says it. Because the Bible said, "Who shall take away or add to the same?" And you see, organization is unscriptural. And when you receive the first dogma, you just might as well go all the way back cause that you cross the line right there. When you come back to the new birth, then you walk into the scripture and you go into a denomination. They say, "I know we don't believe in this. Our bishops and our church teaches. We are one of the oldest churches. We don't teach. I don't care what they don't teach. If the Bible teaches it, the Holy Spirit in you, it'll feed on the word. &gt;&gt; No matter how smart a man is and how he can try to explain it away, they can explain away. A infidel can take the Bible and explain God away from you. Therefore, no man has any right to preach the gospel unless he's been like Moses back down on that sacred sands where him and God alone stood &gt;&gt; until a man's born again and stands there face to face with God and knows there's no infidel, there's no psychology, there's no explaining, there's no scholar in the world can take that away from you. &gt;&gt; You were there when it happened. Yes sir. You know what taking place. Then you say, "I had that kind of experience and I got a spirit on me." And if it denies the word in any way, you got the wrong spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "I can't go for this stuff like this." I know, but aren't uh there's a wrong spirit. There's your mark of identification. &gt;&gt; Cain, you're mark. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Eve just doubted one little word. Not all God said, just one little word and it caused every heartache and heartbreak and death and sin at battles and everything else. Every grave, every ambulance, ever screamed, every hospital was built for the sick. Her one little doubting, one little word of God caused all of this and she was put out when this never would have had to happen. How are you going to get in doubting one word of it? Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, I know it says that, but it it means just that. &gt;&gt; Now, look, God's got to judge the world by something. &gt;&gt; You cannot have judgment unless you have a uh first a law. There's got to be something. You've got to break something in order to be judged. See? And then there cannot be judgment correctly without penalty. Now, see, you can't have a law in town that says $5 fine for run the red light and the next law say no he can go free. See, you can't do that. So, there can't be two laws in existence at one time. And there's one law, one God, one book, one Christ. It's all one faith, one hope. That's all. That's the Bible. Christ. Notice now in this if there is to be something added to this it's got to be added by name. It can't be no more than and if God is going to judge the world by a church as a Catholic says then what Catholic church is he going to judge it by? There's several of them. There's one Roman, one Greek and all these all different kinds. Which Catholic church you going to judge it by? Or maybe he's going to judge it by the Lutheran. Well, then maybe he's going to judge it by the Presbyterian. See, what's he going to do? He's going to judge it by a church. He's going to judge it by his word. &gt;&gt; Well, then he never See, he can't keep a group of people as the sister's vision the other night. The Holy Spirit poured in. It went right through that box. Sure, nothing holds that. It's an individual. It's g to cleanse the church, but it can't hold it. No organization can hold it. That's all. It just can't do it. You got everything in there in there. You can't do it. The organization can't do it. But it's an individual that has the Holy Spirit. Now notice then if God is going to judge the world by his word, then he certainly has watched over it and kept it in condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. or if it's all scrupled up, how is he going to brain judge him? &gt;&gt; It's got to be something. And he never said, "Whosoever by the church." He said, "Whosoever shall take one word away from this &gt;&gt; or add one word to it." The same will be taken his part out of the book of life. &gt;&gt; So to me, it's God, his word, and the judgment. Now, if I judge and accept the word and see that Christ died for me, then I ask for his life to come in and guide me. And if his life is the word and he wrote the word, how can his life be in me and me claiming I have the Holy Spirit and adding a dogma instead of the word? &gt;&gt; It just wouldn't work. &gt;&gt; How can I add a denomination when he's against it and PROVED IT AND SHOWED IT THROUGH HISTORY that every time they denominate, they die spiritually? Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, they grow members. Sure. &gt;&gt; That's right. They grow members, but spiritually they never go nowhere. &gt;&gt; Show me. Tell me in the history. Wherever a church that after it organized, it died right there. The Holy Spirit left that there's no more miracles and signs and she just went right on in chaos. That's exactly what happened to our Pentecostal churches. They did exactly what their mother did at the beginning. They've come out of people that rejected denominations. Now, some of you brethren listen to this tape, some of you old man know that years ago, 40, 50 years ago, if they talked to you about an organization, you would have said it was blasphemy. But today, you belong to the thing that you thought was blasphemy. You women that bob your hair and paint your face, your mother was against that. That go to good old Pentecostal saint. What happened to you? &gt;&gt; Paul said you did run well. What hindered you? back there. You was free from that stuff, but you wanted to be like the rest of them. Exactly what Samuel said. Israel had a king, and that was God. And they said, "Samuel, you're getting old. Make us a king. We want to be like the rest of the world. We want to be like the other nations. We want a king to take us to war. We want a king that can fight our battles." And it displeased Samuel. He said, "Have I ever took anything from you? Have I ever took your money from you? Have I ever asked you for an ox or anything? Have I ever asked you for anything?" They said, "No, you never asked us for nothing." Or says, "Have I ever spoke anything to you in the name of the Lord of what come to pass?" &gt;&gt; Is that right? He said, "Then don't receive that king, because it's going to mean chaos to you." Now, I want to ask you something, the brand tabernacle. You're fixing to grow into a big tabernacle. Now, I may be away for a while. I may go somewhere. Hard tell where the Lord will call me. Maybe off the scene, maybe back into the field. Maybe he might call me into the wilderness. I don't know where he'll call me till Jesus comes. I want to ask you something. Did I ever ask you for anything? Did I ever beg you for money? Did I ever tell you anything of the thousands of things that I have told you in the name of the Lord? But didn't it come to pass? &gt;&gt; Then don't never join an organization. &gt;&gt; It's against the word of God. Come out of it if you're in it. and be ye suffering and receive the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Great God of the prophets, &gt;&gt; the God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, add virtue, Lord, &gt;&gt; to this little chopped up message that's been on my heart for a long time to go to my brethren. Many of those out there, Lord, has the wrong impression of me. They think that I want to be different. They think that I'm trying to be a know-it-all. They've told the people that I deceive the people, especially on such subjects as the water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And upon the serpent's seed, the great harlot. And in many of those tapes, it's one out with nothing but unadulterated truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I've asked them, some of you come and show me where I sin are disbelieving or misinterpreting the word and none has showed up. I pray thee, Father, let these men know that they're missing the hour. &gt;&gt; They are going to wait too late if they don't watch. May they everyone Lord I am sure of this. My heart would break if this scripture wasn't real to me when you said all that the father has given me will come. My sheep hear my voice. Then Lord I guess the kingdom is truly as you said. I know it is. It is like unto a man that took a net and went to the lake, cast in the net, and pulled every kind. There was no doubt scavenger fish. There were turtles, water spiders, serpents, everything that the gospel net caught. But finally, by and by, the crawfish backed into the water again. The turtle pulled away. The serpent hissed and tucked back to the mud hole like a dog to its vomit or a hog to its wall. But there was real fish there, Lord. And I have this consolation of knowing that even before the net went over them, they were fish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were born predestinated fish. &gt;&gt; And so is the gospel net that catches out into the revivals. You know your own. The only thing I'm responsible for, Father, as far as I know, is stay true to this word. You are the one who to decide which is which. And I know that no more than the turtle could become a trout. So could a man or a person that has deaf ears to the gospel ever understand the truth. For the Father has foresaw this and you have promised that all that he give you would come. Heavenly Father, I pray thee that every person that hears this little message that the light that it's been preached in and the meaning that I have in my heart towards my fellow man, people who you died for and man, some of them out there, Lord like in Cororus bunch, genuine man, falsely led with a holy sensor in their hand, but perished. While they wouldn't even let the sensor fire go in with them, Aaron's son, Elohar, had to gather it up and they made a banner for the altar out of those kdles, a shield to show and to be a memorial of that awful thing that Kora tried to form an organized party against the messenger of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. far be it from us, Lord. May the Holy Spirit always protect us. We thank thee, Lord, that our little church, this little sacred shrine, many years ago, 30 some odd years, I knelt in the pond here full of weeds and moisture, and we dedicated this ground to you. This little structure and yonder in that tabernacle corner lays that vision that's come to pass. Exactly. Still there. They're not going to tear it down, Lord. They're just going to It's getting old and they're just going to preserve it by putting one over the top of it. God grant that this golden gospel that's recorded in the pages here, may it never leave this little church until Christ comes. May every member, every member of the body of Christ, they come in here from across the nation and around the world, may every one of them receive the light, the gospel, and walk in it, then &gt;&gt; and receive Christ. And may it be so real that his words will come to pass, the works that I do shall they do also. He that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life. And when eternal life comes in, they're born from above and the works from God manifest himself because it's the same life that was in him. It cannot do anything else. So, Father, let this church never rest their eternal destination upon a sensation, upon an organization, upon anything less than Christ himself living in them, vindicating his word through them and his promise. May from the least little child here tonight until the oldest person receive this experience. And may every man or woman, boy or girl, who hears this tape, may it be so with them, Lord, and give them the understanding that I'm only trying to warn and call out, for this hour is later than we think. And we see Babylon, the mother and all of her prostitute daughters assembling themselves together. God, we realize that the scripture says that the terriers out of the wheat field will be bound first in bundles and they have bound in bundles calling themselves blasphemous names. That really doesn't pertain to them. It's not pertaining to the church either. It's lodges, not churches. There's only one of them, Father, and that's the one you died for. And I pray, Father, as we see them all being bundled now for an atomic fire soon, I pray, Lord, that you'll let the wheat be full and heavy. Grant it, Lord. May we grow and shine light and be like Jesus. If I do not the things that God required me to do, then I have no life in me. But if God speaks and shows his life, then that speaks for itself. Grant it, Lord. I commit this message to you and that you watch over it and bring tens of thousands Lord or all your predestinated children to the gospel and Jesus Christ who is the word. In his name I pray. Amen. I love me and just my salvation on Calary Street. &gt;&gt; I'm Amen. God bless you. The musicians come. How many enjoy the word of the Lord? How many needed to hear that? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, who was this angel in Revelations chapter 18? This mighty angel who lighted up the whole earth. Who was it? The prophet just told us who it was. And I'm so glad that I heard that message again tonight. It really, you know, that movement that's trying to get us to move and look like the denomination and kind of cater to what they're doing. A message like this really tells you to get back in line with the word because that voice called us to come out of her. Is that right? How many of you here um were not born or raised in the message and you heard the message and you came out? There's a number. There's a good portion of the saints here that were born in the message. How many of you saints were born in the message like my wife and many of you? Bless you. And so I can't really I can't really identify with like my children their experience and for their whole life they've heard the message. They've seen that pillar of fire that picture and the signs and wonders and I try to identify with it and try to understand it. Um, but being born and raised in a Pentecostal church and going in the world, when I first heard this message, it was the greatest thing I ever heard in my life. &gt;&gt; I mean, it shook me to my core. There is nothing else like it. &gt;&gt; It was a dynamic explosion in my life. &gt;&gt; And so, that's the way I handled it. That's the way I preach it. That's the way I promote it. And I was talking to some of the other a couple other pastors or friends of mine. They're believers that were raised in the message and they, you know, we've had this discussion before. I might lean a little hard. I'm always quoting and talking about the prophet. And I told one brother, I says, "Brother, I came out of something." And so this is so it's just I first heard the message, I thought everybody was the same. I did. I didn't know there were several churches. I just thought, man, this is heaven. I was waiting for this my whole life. Oh my goodness, what a surprise. But um I know it's still it's a powerful word and each person has to have their own revelation. And I thank God that he's able to get a hold of you no matter where you were born. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I think I remember you now, sis. You're from Tennessee. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Union City. &gt;&gt; Union City. That's right. You play the piano or organ or something? &gt;&gt; God bless you. What's your name? &gt;&gt; Rebecca. &gt;&gt; Rebecca. Your dad's a minister. No. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes. All right. Wonderful. I just remember your face and I was sitting there and then it clicked. Yeah, that's where she's from. So, God bless you. Welcome you and my brother. God bless you all. And so, um, thank the Lord for his word tonight. We will stand and we'll sing a few praises. Um we'll ask brother John to come. Service on Wednesday night. We'll start that at 9 p.m. And if you have testimony or songs that would be nice for you to bring those at the for the end of the year service and we'll put those together. I know I ask saints to sing and nobody sings. My wife, she she gets after you. She got the whole Christmas program. she got people to sing and and um so the pastor's wife sometimes they have a stronger influence than the pastor I think so I maybe I'm just not asking you right maybe I should text you and ask you but I really love to hear you all sing it just blesses me I love to hear your testimony I love to hear you sing get your little group together you know and put it together sing a song for the Lord so we'll start that at nine Lord willing we have a few testimonies that we'll lay out and so God richly bless you. Amen. So, Brother John, why don't you come and I wanted to uh Brother Kim to come and greet you all. We're so happy to have him back with us. And so, maybe he'll we'll have him come and greet you. Come on, brother Kim Dingall sitting back there. Call him by name. He gets a place squeezed in by the wall so he's not an easy access. But we'll wait for you to come on through. We love Brother Kim. Hammy love our brother. Amen. God bless you. Welcome. Just greet the saints for us. All right. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Well, I thought I'd made it through the whole day without it. And I was looking around to see is there another brother Kim? He's calling. Well, it's certainly wonderful to be here. Um my daughter would tell you that when that first note hit the cello this morning, it just really struck my heart, you know. Um I really feel at home here. And I said this, I was on on our way down. We stopped at a church in Bakersfield and I said this there. I said, 'You know, I've traveled to a lot of places around the world, 65 countries or so. And I find when I'm in Gabon, you know, the dogs all sound the same when they bark. &gt;&gt; And when you hear children playing in a playground, no matter what language they s they speak, they all sound the same. You just hear the chatter of children. And when you get around the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; it sounds the same. whether it's in Gabon or here or home or wherever. And you know, Sister Peterson sang it wrote a song, I always feel at home in the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's that's where we that's where we feel at home. We really feel at home here. We feel welcome here. Um you know, Brother Bram talked about that welcome Holy Spirit. That welcome spirit that you know, if people would come up in the prayer line and he would say he would recognize that welcome Holy Spirit, you know that they had the Holy Spirit in them. And so we're we're thankful to be here. Um I don't I'm not sure how long we're here. We're going to be here until um you know, we have a little bit of work to do, but beyond that, uh we were almost to the place I'm not sure if we were going to make it this year. I had, you know, like I said, just before we came, we're in Gabon and then we traveled to Manitoba and then to here and and I looked at the calendar and I thought, "Oh man, you know, January, so I'm going to pick up again." And so I said to my wife, we were home, just came home from Manitoba. I said, "If we don't get in the motor home and go now, we're not going to get there." So, we we just threw some things in and came. So, we're we we really appreciate being here. We feel very welcome here. Uh we really enjoy the Holy Spirit here. The level that the word is preached at here. You know, we stream a lot of your services from home. We don't get them all, but we we we get most of them. Um, we usually do our Sunday morning service and then Sunday afternoon is streaming the morning service from here. That's kind of what our that that's kind of what our routine is. And you know, there's so much going on around the world everywhere. And we see the churches leaning this way and this way. And I told brother Po yesterday, you know, when you when you ju when you're just hearing the message preached, then you can relax. And that's what I find in brother Po's preaching. His thoughts come from the message. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we hear where the thoughts come from Google and then we get a few message quotes to support it. But the but the inspiration comes from the message. &gt;&gt; And you know I was talking to a young brother. Is it okay? Am I I'm okay. &gt;&gt; I was talking to a young brother a little while ago and I said to him, you know, you know that the story of Ezer in the Bible. Do we we all know the story, right? &gt;&gt; Alza was sent to find a bride for Rebecca. And you know, at one point she said, "I will come." And she made her stand. She made her stand with her family who said, "No, no, you shouldn't go." And she made her stand. That's kind of like getting saved. &gt;&gt; But you know, it was a long journey on that camel &gt;&gt; all the way back to Isaac. And two things happened on that journey. You know, he was teller was telling her all about Isaac, what a wonderful man he was. and his character and all about so that by the time she got there she was absolutely in love with him. And then the other thing he did was on that whole trip he said now you know he doesn't like things done like this. He likes things like this. And she knew how to go in and how to come out, how to come into his presence and how to not upset him. It's like my wife, you know, she knows how to make my toast. You know, I like it put in the toaster and then I like it half cooked and then turn the other half so it's all even and then the butter's got to be right out to the edges. &gt;&gt; And there's nobody can do toast for me like my wife cuz she knows exactly how I like it. And Rebecca knew exactly how to present herself to Isaac, &gt;&gt; how to how to stand, how to show respect for him, how to dress. You know, don't don't show up to Isaac with your face all painted up. He's not going to like that, right? I remember Brother Hildebrandt's wife was in the hospital once she'd been really sick and uh she'd had a heart problem. And uh and the the nurses said to her, "You know, you're you're really pale. You know, you should probably put a little makeup on your face to look good for your husband." And she said, "No, I don't think my husband's going to like that none." And she didn't. And so on this long journey that we're on, how in the world do we know how to get into the rapture without Elozer? &gt;&gt; How do we know how to come in and out of his presence? How do we even know that we're not supposed to be sitting in church talking to one another and cutting up and chewing gum and doing all this in church? Because Ezer told us, now if you know if you don't if you do that, the Holy Spirit just might not show up. &gt;&gt; See, how would we know that without Eleazar? Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why we need Alzer. That's what we heard today. How would we know this? &gt;&gt; Right. And so when we come to a place where we're hearing the word preached from that place, you know, I I just say like this, you know, you can just you can just sit back and relax and actually feed. You know, you can't really feed when you're not relaxed. You know, you know, if you're in a home, you know, I have a bit of a nervous stomach. So, if you're in a home and things are upset, my wife knows, you know, I need to have a calm atmosphere when I eat my supper. If it's all up and down and all over the place, I can't eat. I get I get an upset stomach. And so, when you're just coming from the word and and the and and the thought is coming from the message and the message is coming forward, &gt;&gt; we can just relax and feed &gt;&gt; and get fat &gt;&gt; on the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's it's nice to be with you. Um, I'll turn it back to you. Somebody's gonna sing a song. Somebody's gonna do something. God bless you, brother. Amen. Lord, come, Brother John. Let's sing. Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good to me. Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good to me. Lord, Lord, you surely been good to me. Sing it, Lord. Oh, Lord. Oh Lord, surely been good to me. You have done what this world could not do. &gt;&gt; So I was lost. You surely been good to me. You saved my soul when I was lost. You surely been good to me. You saved my soul when I was lost. You surely been good to me. You've done what this world could not do. Well, then you healed my body when I was sick. Surely been good to me. Then healed my body when I was sick. Surely been good to me. You healed my body when I was sick. Surely been good to me. Oh, you have done what this world could not do. You filled me with You filled me with the Holy Ghost. You surely have been good to me. You filled me with the Holy Ghost. You surely been good to me. You filled me with the Holy Ghost. Surely been good to me. You have done what this world could not do. Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, and Lord, you surely been good to me. Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good to me. Oh, Lord Lord, you surely been good to me. You have done what this world could not do. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Kim, when you were talking about I was thinking about Esther as well. Brother Ben had mentioned something from the book of Esther and in his prayer, but you know, they had the dresser of women that would come and instruct all of the the hopefuls to be the next queen. They said, "This is what the king wants, and this is what the king wants." And some of them took things in addition. They were given that liberty to take things additional when they went to go meet the king. But it says Esther only took that what the dresser had told her this is what the king likes. And so just that that came to my my mind as he was saying that. And maybe we could just sing that chorus together. Pleasing Lord let me be pleasing unto you. Pleasing. Let me be pleasing to you. Let everything that I do be pleasing to you and praying that everything I pursue would be pleased. Is it oh Lord unto you. Let's ask him again. Lord, let me be pleasing. Let me be pleasing to you. Let everything that I pursue, Lord, let it be pleasing to you. Let everything I pursue, let it be pleasing, oh Lord, unto you. Amen. Brother Caleb, would you come dismiss us tonight with a word of prayer? Let me in that I do Lord be pleasing to you. Everything I pursue would be pleasing, oh Lord, unto you. Amen. Dear Lord, we just thank you for the messenger you sent for this hour, William Miranda. Lord, thank you for fulfilling your word, Lord, in the Bible that you would send a prophet for this age, Lord. Lord Jesus, thank you for keeping your word, pulling a people out of this world, the denominations, the institutions of man, Lord, that put your children in cages, Lord. Thank you, Lord, for opening those cages, Lord. Lord, just I know like your prophet said, the deepest calls to the deep, Lord. And when you unlock those cages, some of those stay in there not knowing they're free, Lord. But your call pulls them from that place, Lord. Lord, may none of your children be lost, Lord. May there be hands, Lord, work hands, Lord, that still will go out in the field, Lord, and still carry your will, Lord. And Lord, may you always still pull. And those that you pull, may they come to your work hands, Lord, that they may see what you want them to see, Lord. Lord Jesus, we just thank you so much for your love, Lord, thank you for your tapes, Lord. Lord Jesus, we just appreciate you, Lord, and appreciate those here tonight, Lord. Lord, we just love you, Lord. We just ask these things, Lord. Just go with your people tonight, Lord. Your hands over their lives, Lord. just ask these things in the name of Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. You're dismissed. Maybe we could sing that song I mentioned earlier. They come from the east and west since Jesus has set me free. They come from the east and west for they come from the lands of far to feast with the king to dine as his guest. How blessed these pilgrims are. Beholding his hallowed face, a glow with light divine, a glow with lighting. Bless partaker of his grace as Jim in his crown to shine. Since Jesus has set me free. Oh, I'm happy as heart can be. No longer I bear the burden of care. His yoke is so sweet to me. My soul was in black at night, but darkness has taken light. Now I shout the victory for Jesus has set me free. I look on the great white throne. Before it the ransom stand. No longer our tears, no sorrow is known, nor death in that goodly land. My Savior has gone before, preparing the waiting for me. Soon we'll meet to part no more through time or eternity. Let's sing the third verse. The gates of that holy place stand open by night and day. Oh, look to the Lord who giveth more grace, whose love is prepared the way. A home in his manions fair. his hand at preserve for all for the wedding feast prepare obeying the graious call. Oh Jesus is coming soon. Our trials will then be all. What if our Lord this moment should come for those who are free from sin? Well, then would it bring it joy? For sorrow and deep despair. When our morning glory comes, we'll meet him up in the air. Since Jesus has set me free, I'm happy as heart can be. No longer I bear the burden of hair. His yoke is so sweet to me. Was his black. My darkness has taken. Now I shout the victory for Jesus has set me free. Hallelujah. And know how I love Jesus. Oh. Oh, now I love you, Jesus. Oh, how I love you, Jesus, because he first love me. to me he's so wonderful to me he is so wonderful yes to me he is so wonderful oh to me he is so wonderful because he first loved me and I'll never forsake him. He promised he'd never forsake us. So I never forake him. Oh wow. Never forsake it. Oh, never never forsake him because he first loved me. Tell him again. Oh, how I love you, Jesus. Oh, how I love Jesus. Oh, how I love Jesus. Now I love Jesus because he first and there's a name that I love to hear. I love to sing its word. Well, there is a name I love. Love to hear how I love to sing this word. It sounds like music in my ears. It's the sweetest name on earth. Oh, how I love you, Lord. Oh, &gt;&gt; how I love you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, how I love you, Lord. How I love you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I love you, Jesus. Because you first love me. Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. I'm a Oh, hey. Oh god. Oh yeah.
