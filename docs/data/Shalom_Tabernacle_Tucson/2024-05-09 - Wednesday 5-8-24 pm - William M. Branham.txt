above all things for Jesus Christ the son of God who died at Calvary to redeem us back into this wonderful fellowship and we are very grateful for His blessings on us at this present time now our beloved president of this country and we're grateful to Him Father for when he was brought in the Wars ended and now it seems like the peace talk has settled in Russia and many great things and we love him father as the leader of our nation and we hear that he's had a heart attack and we understand that he's a Christian and he loves you and to Him Father we are we are grateful for all he's done and we need such a person this day as a a leader in our nation and as Brethren together we offer a prayer to you for his Deliverance that you will heal him solid sound and L that these afflictions upon him will only be brought around to draw him closer to you to know that all he must do is to rely upon thee and may He hurry back to the White House father and may all the days of his Reign here

no more Wars Grant these blessings father we ask in Jesus name amen may be seated I was just a little late to hear I guest the singing and I met brother wormal outside and I don't see brother egberg so I guess I missed it again today I like that singing good oldfashioned singing They you got quite a few preachers here I'll say that it's very fine to see this fine convention and my uh great opportunity today to to address you speak to you about the Lord which I know many of you could tell me about it and I'm just a baby to many of you and when it comes to addressing ministers I'm very kind of a little shy about that but they told it faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen and my friend Joseph sure used some of that the other day when he gave out in the meeting at uh he never asked me if he said now can I announce it I said no Brother Joseph but I actually done announced it well uh when I do but come over so you uh had to bear with me a little while if you will be so kind to do it and this afternoon to speak a while and then tonight get ready for tonight service we're all so grateful for this great move of the Lord God and this and this convention here and the Philadelphia church for brother Bose for all the staff and the peoples of Chicago and around about we're grateful to you people to my opinion it's such things as this year that keeps the Backbone in America we wouldn't have any America if there wasn't any Lord Jesus here to help us be America after all the backbone of every nation is its morals when the morals drop in a nation then the nation's gone motherhood broken you just might as well hold up all other nations have done it and ours is no exception and we believe that the the great time when arms will be stacked for their last time and the Caps will sound for the last time as soon at hand when King Jesus shall come and take over the rain here on Earth and we're all looking for that and that's why these conventions are held and that's the reason that we're all gathered together because we have things in common to talk about of course our key note is Jesus Christ the son of God and I would look at present times at the things that is now I would be a very discouraged person but I learned a lesson one time or a little thing that I heard a man say they was going to give away a swin bicycle to the best Rider I don't know where they ever quoted it in this church among these people or not the boy that could ride a a 12in plank 100 yards could get a new swin bicycle and many of the boys around the city they thought they could ride it is going to win the contest and they had one little boy there was kind of a they were sure he wasn't going to win it so all the boys got on their one by one to try to ride it and all of them fell off but the little boy he rode on to the end of the plank got off won the swin bicycle all the other boys got around and said how did you do it he said now fellas I tell you what you done said when they started you off they give them a little push so they could get started hold them up let him start said you were looking down like this trying to keep your bicycle on the board I said I never noticed down here I see you do that and makes you nervous and said you fell off that I just put my eyes on the end and kept going towards the end that's it if we look right around here brethren we get nervous but let's look at the end at the end brother Jack was just according at the dinner table today uh something had struck real down deep in my heart and it said that a little boy was lost I believe it was an iron or Scotland one and he didn't know how to find his way back so the people were getting around him and trying to find he said well said in the city he lived in over the hill somewhere well there was a great big cross that if you just show me that cross and I can go home that's right that's right if you can show me the cross I'll find my way home that's that's the way home isn't it hallelujah amen now I don't know to speak to an audience like this uh I just thought I'd read a little verse or two of scripture here and then maybe speak on the word just for a few moments in my own oldfashioned sassar ass way of doing it and so uh over in Hebrews the 10th chapter and the 19th verse we read this having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus let's ask our lord to bless his word father we are so grateful to have the word for Faith cometh by hearing the word and we as your servants today as men and women sitting here coming out of the field to refresh ourselves in this convention we pray heavenly father that you'll come to us again this afternoon as thou has always done for you promised you would and would bless us together today and let Thy word find its resting place in every heart for we ask it in Jesus name amen I would thought maybe just knowing last evening and never prepare anything because it's usually something else when I get there but just happen to think on this having boldness to enter into the holiest of holiest by the blood of Jesus Christ I thought I might take a little text this afternoon for a few moments on a hidden life now most all of us are in these conventions and so forth to try to find out how to to have a closer walk with God I'm sure that's your brother's uh uh um way this afternoon I I was thinking maybe I'd talk about the Supernatural and I don't know how to approach that it's just as much mysterious to me as it is to you and um well then a hidden life with Christ some way that we could hide away and get away from all of it and live with Christ am I looking at Henry Gro God bless you brother Henry I haven't seen you for a long time and brother I just haven't looked back and seen dad and recognize him when I had my great breakdown or come off the field for about eight months they were real brother and Daddy to me they stayed right with me all the time I never will forget the day that brother grew up there we went out in the cornfield to pray I was so nervous I stayed in the vision so long I couldn't tell whether it was in or out I never will forget brother Gro when he knelt down to pray with me put his arms around me just simple like said now Papa God will you come help brother Brandon Papa God will you come help brother Brandon that's always stay with me brother gr oh what will it be brother Gro some day I hoped I had my arm around you sit down with the evergreen trees where The Fountains of the Waters of life is Flowing from another Throne we be in the presence of our Papa God then forever and forever to live in his presence now God has made it so simple and of the Bible and to make the gospel so simple to even a person like myself that's uneducated uh would have an opportunity to speak uh and preach the go gopel and uh I was saying to the Brethren coming over how funny I feel to get up there today and know that before Scholars and some of the smartest men in the country sitting here and how my grammar how poor it is and how all unqualified but you know probably you all feel this like I do if you had to set before some Bishops and so forth but you know brotherr God doesn't dwell so so much in theology he dwells in love in humbleness where you can really everybody can get acquainted with him and KN him I'm so glad that he's he hasn't selected just a little handful or certain denomination he said whosoever will and so that even gives me and you a chance to come in and have fellowship and speak of him now God has made it so wonderful that in the old Tex Testament he where usually I go to for refuge for a text once in a while he's made the Old Testament in Parables and in symbolic forms to express itself in his doings that the simpleminded might be able to have a conception of his will and what he's done many times in the Old Testament how I have went back to find the old typing the new all always God did in what he's doing now in the New Testament he foreshadowed it in the Old Testament and all of those who neglected God and forsaken God in the Old Testament we can see by example what become of them and those who dared to have faith in Jehovah and stepped out in the Old Testament we see what happened to them now we make our choice right and we are thank God for a free nation and a place of worship to where we each one can set ourselveses in the faith of God and fly away from this Earth I'm glad of that today for there's plenty places you couldn't do that now for instance in the Old Testament how God gave all of his uh Parables back there and set forth his his um things that would be a shadow of today then that's the only way that I can teach the Bible they talk about Big Greek words and so forth they just tie me in all kinds of places but if I look back and see what God did back there as a foreshadow then I have some general conception of what he's doing today because that was a shadow if I'm going to the uh to the west and my Sun's rising in the East and My Shadow is before me and if I never seen myself or never know what I look like or a human being I'd have some conception of my form when I seen my shadow and the Old Testament is the shadow of the coming of Christ and everything foreshadowed the cross and in Christ all God's Redemption all these plans all the Plan of Salvation all was met at Calvary now how beautiful in the Old Testament how God foreshadowed this holy spirit that we're enjoying today how that he foreshadow the order and these conventions and how we could come together in fellowship and have a a fellowship together back there we see how in the early beginning of the of the church that how that God foreshadowed the place today where I think Brethren that we're entering now for this next blessing everyone knows that we're just on aor Tim like the great blessing of Divine Healing and the powers of the supernatural it's gone out that's brought about a Revival that's actually shooked the world the hardest that's ever been shooked in all the all the times there has never been a time in any age that Christianity shuck the entire world like it has the last five or six years right and every nation under ever placed to radio through by evangelist by uh we go into a place in different countries where they don't believe in God and there they find where the ordinary missionary had passed out some tracks which is fine but when they see the operation of the supernatural tens of thousands of heathen fall at the cross and serve the Lord Jesus it's been a mighty move now we've held this ground so long and I believe with all my heart that we're on the threshold of stepping into another Veil Yonder somewhere the word the greater mysteries of God will be known to the church and me for one I've got both ears and eyes and heart open to hear the message when it comes examine it for Satan will put out on many a false Runner but just lay it aside remember it's only signifying that something real is going to take place when you sit for Satan will do everything as I said last night to blockade the real Jewel of God when it's coming forth you'll you'll hear it he put out a blockade to catch Abel he put out one to catch Joseph one to catch Jesus and so forth and he'll do it one to get Moses for you can notice those things that Satan will try to block it and that's for I believe that the many Cults and things as we see rising over the nation is only a light post to say look out it will be here soon I've noticed among our Brethren that many of you as coming into to you as Full Gospel people coming from the Baptist Church myself and accepting the doctrine of the baptism of the holy spirit being a separate uh work of the Holy Spirit and I thought then when we when the Martin Luther reached justification by faith he thought that settled it that was a light for his day and he preached it and believed it and held on to it and it was the light of that day then he entered another Veil a man John Wesley when Calvinism begin to sweep the nation and they settle down to saying what God's go to do you'll do and does us no good to have a Revival God raised up John Wesley and he certainly smashed Calvinism to the ground to the place where it ought to have its right bals under the works of sanctification the second work of Grace nazarenes carried on and Along come the Pentecostal then next end the baptism of the Holy Spirit moving on up in the higher height and now when the Brethren received the baptism of the Holy Ghost they said this is the summit this is all of it but Brethren that's wrong there is no Summit to God's power we move on and on and on it's the unlimited resources of God has never been tapped yet blessings and powers that we know nothing about it's never been even revealed to archangels is laying just ahead for his church that will believe for Eye Has Not Seen ear is not heard NE has it enter the hearts of men what God has for them and story that love him so let's move up and claim our rights as God opens the gates and swings out to welcome that let's move on up into deeper depths and never colonize ourselves to organize ourselves and to get into a place where this is we believe this and that's all let's believe this plus how much more we can hear from God I think that are to be the motive of every man and woman that loves the Lord Jesus they'll receive all that you can from the hand of his Bountiful mercies it's my heart that's the reason I never jarn any organization or tuck sides with any groups because I wanted myself wide open for the love of God and for what he could give to me I noticed in the Bible one time speaking just for a few moments now in the Old Testament when a son was born into a home he was a son when he was borned he become a son when he was borned into a home in the ordinary typical Oriental home in those days the son was giving a place and a tutor that raised a child Paul beautifully speaks of it in the New Testament that how the tutor was to raise the child and we were the law was a tutor to bring us to Christ but then that child when he was born was in type of the church today the Born Again by the Holy Spirit and I believe God has been tutoring his church bringing it up raising it up to it's time now for something else to happen the church ought to be grown by this time but many of us who ought to be teaching others are yet Desiring to censor milk of the Bible see we need someone to teach us when we should be teachers and to that I bow my head in shame that I should know more about God than I do now here's one thing that I do believe that when a child the Bible speaks back there that when the child had been raised the tutor kept the father posted on the conduct of the child now the tutor in this manner has been the Holy Spirit to the Pentecostal and the church the holy ghost that give remember the child no matter what would ever take place it was born a child it will always be a child and when a man is borned of the Holy Ghost he becomes a child of God for it is actually a second birth a regeneration that creates something in the man that wasn't there to begin with whenever man is Born Into the household of faith he becomes a child then the Holy Spirit follows this man and brings word to God how he is progressing now after this child become of age now he's still a child but if the child was Reckless and never paid any attention and wasn't so interested in the father's work that child never become adopted to that family but if he was a correct child a good child and loved the work of his father and was interested and tried to do all he could to progress his father's work then the tutor brought that word to the father and there was What's called the placing of the son or as Paul gives it in over in Galatians the adoption that we was predestinated to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ the adoption now the same son that was born into a family could be adopted into the same family or placed in the same family or give a position in the family that he was born into and I do believe that that is the work of the Holy Spirit today among the church is trying to place in the church positionally Apostles teachers prophets and so forth as and we've seen many false salon arms and so forth moving amongst the people which only indicated that the real genuine adoption was at hand I believe it God has to place into the church that's the business of God not of man right now when this boy became of age and when he was ready then for his uh adoption and he had proved by the tutor had told the father that this boy was eligible for adoption he was taken out into a public place and there he was robed with a a robe a honor robe perhaps purple or some color of royalty and was set up and the whole city all the people around about seen the father adopt his own son into the family and then when he was adopted into the family already a son already a child already a heir of Grace but placed in the family you get it now when he was placed in the family and given his position then that boy's name on a check was just as good as his father's name on the check now I believe that that is the time that the church has arrived at the day that the next great move in the church is for God after we' seen the false alarms but now God will place in his church correctly Apostles prophets teachers evangelists not man-made Seminary Boughton but God will place into the church not theology run overs and overnights but God will place in the church as God has chosen as the holy Holy Ghost has tutored this church and raised it up and in there God will adopt into his into the phys his sons they're already his sons but whether they are worthy of the position that he has for them if you'll notice in a perfect type God did his own son the same way he taken three as a witness where the mouth of two or three witness ever word to be established Peter James and John love Faith and Hope and he taken them up into a mountain apart from the rest of the world and there before official Witnesses God adopted his own son he was transfigured before them and his rment did shine as a sun and a voice out of a cloud said this is my beloved Son hear ye him set him up on on the mountain but the witnesses there you see it hold them in a robe as bright as the sun shining in the and is they even Shine Like the Sun and its strength and God spoke out said this is my beloved Son hear ye him God adopted his own child into the family hear me no longer but this is my son who takes over from here on Amen that adoption is near the time and parable of the church it's time for that now let's drop back to the hidden life and find out what this is going to require to get into this place of adoption a hidden life we realize that in the Old Testament under the mosaical laws we found out in there any reader knows that there were three two veils two compartments and a congregation in the the setup of God's Tabernacle in the wilderness the first was the congregation than the holy place and the holiest of holies that's God's house that's God's dwelling place that's your dwelling place now you only live in a three- room house remember you may have two bedrooms you may have three kitchens but you only live in a three room house God lived in a three- room house house when God was here on Earth he occupied a three- room house the soul body and spirit of Jesus Christ in the temperal temple he he is in a congregation a holy place and holies of holies each one of them was separated one from another and each one had different frature in it to show The Dwelling Place a very beautiful type of the church The Sinner first comes into the uh the kitchen as it was the kitchens were you eat the living room is where you commune and the bedroom is where you rest oh God see The Sinner comes in faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word he comes and eats the word then he's baptized into the faith and accepts Christ as personal savior brings him in then to commune with God but then he moves on into the bedroom the still quietness with God for all the things of the world is shut out and he's alone in the Stillness with God Brethren sisters that's the place this Pentecostal move ought to be today oh not so much babylin we're we're Trinity we're methodists we're assemblies we're Church of God we are to be alone in that quiet Stillness with God don't you believe it certainly we ought to be notice when the high priest once the year entered in the first Veil than the second Veil on the outside of the lever where they wash the sacrifice then the sacrifice was killed put on the brazing Altar and the blood was put in a charger and the high priest once the year walked in behind the veil to make an atonement and notice a dressing of this high priest before he could enter the veil he had to be stripped and dressed right to go in that's what the church is today what it needs is a stripping off of all these little Cults and and dressed in the righteousness of Jesus Christ and ready to enter [Music] [Applause] in his walk must be different every along the hyns of His Garment he had a pomegranate and then a bell and as he walked his walk was so perfect until the bells played holy holy holy unto the Lord what we need today is not whether we are assemblies or Church of God or Oneness or whatever it might be our walk ought to be playing to the public holy holy holy unto the Lord another thing he must be anointed before he goes in the anointing oil was made with the rose of Sharon and the crushing of the Rose brought forth the perfume and they put it on the oil it run on Aaron's beard Plumb to the hems of his skirt covered all over with the anointing oil walking right living right moving right dressed right there he went taking before him the blood and as he went behind the curtain into the third room there was a veil that dropped behind him that the outside world could not see him no more and every man or boy or woman or girl that ever is Anointed of God and Walks Behind that Temple the veil of God the Holy Ghost puts him in a secret place the veil drops behind him and the world and all of its things are cut off behind him that's the reason Brethren that we're holding up the adoption of God is our difference of life and fussing and quarreling amongst one another is a reason that Veil can't drop behind us and we can go into that presence of God that's right we're so interested in our denominations we're so interested in what the next fell are what what is that to thee follow thou me it's an individual Affair between every Minister how a minister ought to always get alone to himself even before he preaches before he prays before he does anything he should get along with God in that quiet place hid away with God how that that Veil once coming down now the fr Minature in this inside this veil was different from the outside way back in the congregation the lever that washed the Beast and the next veil was what it was the um the burning of the Beast body and in there was the seven golden candlesticks on the that represented the lamp and give the light and out into the outer courts was sunlight in the first veil was artif Ang notice and when they walk in here by this lamp then they go into the next court which was the holiest of holies as they walked in their anointed how that God has so planed out it's such a beautiful thing for us as we see the great plan there of God's Eternal salvation how that his ministers should walk in this how they should prepare themselves to enter into this now on the inside of this enter Court the called the holiest of holiest there was a piece of furniture sitting there called The Mercy Seat and the Covenant was in the ark and the Ark had two cherubin and it was on the inside that was a Furniture inside of the Holy place next coming out was a golden Candlestick then on out to the laad now perfectly represents the age of Luther Wesley and Pentecost exactly the three steps are dispensations of his grace that's been given to Mankind we are in the last dispensation I believe that with all my heart see now notice then also in this great move how God brought them in there in this great uh Place Moses one time was told by God when the Mana begin to all the Mana was a type of Life Christ coming down from heaven and perishing here on Earth that he might give us life the Mana Came From Heaven laid on the earth and the people eat it to substain life Christ came down from heaven and become Mana that we might live by him and notice now the people eating the Mana they had to get it quickly and eat it because when the sun rose it wasn't long till it was perished the type there of Christ the Holy Spirit the Mana was a type of the Holy Ghost today as God brought the church in natural with natural Mana he's bringing the church today spiritual on spiritual Mana when the church had first overcome come over the Red Sea type of the blood passed over into the journey on the road to the promised land Mana rain the first night amen and when the church was passed over from Life unto death on the day of Pentecost God reigned the spiritual Mana Out of Heaven that sustained the church until Jesus comes again or we pass into the Millennium into the promised land amen oh when they picked it up and they would eat it they said it was sweet it tastes like Honey in the Rock they said tast like honey David Called It Honey in the Rock and that's what it is now notice a type the Mana never did cease to fall until the day they entered the promised land for 40 years the same Mana fell every day hallelujah how you going to take the Holy Ghost and leave it at Pentecost brother it's been one continually Pentecost that cause a hardness of man's heart to fail to eat the Mana that's right notice then it was a tipe now on the day of Pentecost when our Mana as soon as the people had went into the upper room and obeyed the Commandments of the Lord Jesus and carried waited at the city of Jerusalem for the going forth of the Holy Ghost the first time there came from Heaven a sound like a Russian Mighty Wind that filled all the house where they were setting clothing tongues set up on them like fire they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and begin to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance out into the streets they went a cowardly little bunch of preachers hid away in an upper room but all of a sudden there came the mana come pouring down to sustain their souls and out into the streets they went with an experience that they had never had before a beautiful type of God sustaining his church knew this journey to the promised land notice Brethren then how long was this Mana to last it lasted the entire Journey until they hit into another dispensation over into the promised land how long is this the last until Jesus comes Peter said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you to your children and to them as far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call how long was it to last as many as the Lord Our God shall call and as long as the dispensation of Grace lasts God will still call men and women to his service so the Holy Ghost is just as real today now he never said now when they eat this Mana remember if they eateth man many people eaten and said this is it they had to gather it fresh every day that's right that's right they had to gather the Mana fresh every day because along about 9:00 on their second step it would go to Melton it would perish and many times people living in God's second room even in communion after they've already received the word and come into the second step of receiving Christ into their life and never yet know what that secret room is what that bedroom what that rest place is they eat the Mana but did you notice if they let it lay too long it finally melted out there was it perished away and I think a lot of people has had a lot of Campground cramps anyhow that when they go and eat of the Lord on the campground and before another revival can come along they're all back and twisted up in some kind of culture something else what's the matter brother you've never walked in somewhere else God said Moses make you a gold and pot Hallelujah and in there place this mana and remember that a Believer when he walked in there that Mana never did run out it was always fresh and new and sweet as the days went by as the years went by and any man who comes to Christ and hides away in the veil falls behind him he's in the presence of almighty God eating a Mana day and night from one hour to the other it's always just as sweet as it was the first day it fell into your soul that's what we need today is get in where the things are at not stand off and pretend or not stand off and act but actually get in there amen the man wants now remember only Believers only the elect comes into that that God God has chosen you I believe in Revelations 2 that he that overcometh so it's promised to Overcomers you said oh I overcome smoking that ain't what he's talking about the whole lot more goes to this Christianity besides not smoking cigaretts or drinking whiskey he that overcometh shall inherit all things and he will be my son I'll be his God and listen I will give him of the Hidden [Music] Mana amen I'll hide him away and I'll give you the hidden things the world on the outside of the curtain don't know nothing about it hallelujah oh they eat Mana but they don't know about this I'll give to him the hidden Mana I'll give him a stone with his name you get what I mean entering in to the adoption are the hidden place with God Ministers of the Gospel don't care about your denominations and what the world thinks but seek to enter in to the hidden Mana where the full revelation of God is made love perfect in your heart and you and God and everything else is at rest let anything come what may your hidden way what a place to live oh that's let me abide there as a song said let me rest neath the tree where the so freely flows where the lamb is the light and the soul of the saved never die amen sure they ate men out there but they didn't know about this they've never been in there have you my dear brother don't despise my ignorance but I want to ask you something Have you ever come to the place in life where Christ meant more to you and all the arguing you could do about your church as Christ meant more to you than all the world I don't mean from any emotional or mental work up I mean from the depths of your heart that something settled in there something's taking place that you don't know how it come but you're hid away and your whole motive is to serve Jesus Christ have you entered that place my dear brother have you come into that place where you don't care what anyone says not to go out and act smart but the little love of God Is So anchored into you that you can't see nothing else your whole motive is to do the will of God love for everybody flowing free from every what a place to live that's the hidden place that's the place where we got to come to my brethren that's the place where God Reveals His secret things that's a place where God does a placing in the calling you get what I mean in this same place we don't have much time because I got to hurry but just for another thought in this same place they put Aaron's Rod to make a decision who God had chosen who he hadn't and that Rod that was a dead stick and one night's time come to life brought buds brought flowers and brought arms it both come to life brought blossoms and yielded fruits a very typical pattern of the center being brought to God into the holy Place remember that Rod p passed over every one of those other elements and he got inside the holy place still dead but to abide it never come to life when he brought first brought it in there that's the reason the holy spirit's watched you since you received the Holy Ghost see your attitude towards his kingdom if it's been selfish motives if the things that you thought of is in in farther denomination or if it's to are there better you your position if it's to make you a man looked up to in the world if it's to build you a big church somewhere or some popularity or some other thing outside of increasing or EMB bettering the kingdom of God brother something's wrong amen now when that old dead Rod was brought in there and laid in the presence of God himself what happened it bued it blossomed and it yielded fruit showing that we born in that Rod was off of an almond tree and when it was cut off it died and when man was cut off from God he died spiritually but once brought into the place of God before the presence of God he comes to life and he yields life he yield blossoms he yields fruit Jesus come to the tree to look for fruit on it it had everything but fruit that's right and that's what's the matter with our churches today we got everything but fruit we can shout we can speak with tongues we can argue the scriptures we can teach our theology but when it comes to fruit bearing the tree is very lean what is the fruits of the spirit love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness patience it shows Manny is still outside on the first altar you're still open to the public you're still listening to hear what John's got to say about it what the neighbor will think or something for yourself but once behind the Bale and the curtains is dropped you're hiding God to Christ see notice what a beautiful picture of the centner laying in the presence of God now this Rod laying there it was refreshed it was fragnant brought the fragrance of the Blossom and it yielded fruit the but came forth now a beautiful type of that is given Earthly speaking the first thing that we have to do before we can have a crop we have to have seed and the seed placed in the ground will yield its fruits is that right now the first thing we have to do is to receive Christ now the tree had to be an almond tree to start with and Christ you have to receive him before you come into this place and then in the presence of this great God then these things take place what see the word Christ was the word in the beginning was the word and the word is with God and the Word was God Christ comes into the life of the human being now notice the first thing was a refreshment what made makes a sea grow did you ever get up of a morning and find the DW that's fell down from heaven and refreshes the Earth how does it refresh it when it's at peace the D don't fall in daytime the D falls in the night time when everything is at peace the do can never fall on you my brother as long as you're fussing and arguing and stewing about the things here on this Earth get along with God and let the D Drops of Mercy P upon you and the Stillness Precious Memories how they linger how they ever fill my soul in the Stillness of the midnight Secrets unfold how that God can get his believer with the curtains dropped around him alone to himself he'll bring down a refreshing from Heavens that there's no other person or no other way in the world to ever know it only he that's laying there did you ever walk out of the morning that real fresh School feeling God has refreshed this Earth pregnant did you ever go into a rose garden down my place that got a lot of honey suckles the honeysuckle don't smell much along In the Heat of the day but it's early of the morning when all the air has been purified then that Romeo of the honeysuckle let a man be out fussing fighting stewing and you'll never get much of Aroma from that of the Gospel but let him get alone one time in the Stillness of God every man it comes to the pulpit ought to dwell alone first then comes the fruits yielding forth its fruits every man that stays in the presence of God into this great secret place hid away will yield the fruits of righteousness peace love joy long suffering goodness ganeless patience don't fuss about these other things get that in your life and you'll never get it till you hide away with God into that land of adoption another thing we'll call your attention just before we close look at the light on the outside in the courts it was the fervent that Lit it up sunlight and so forth some days was cloudy some days the sun didn't shine at all some days it was dark now that's in the outer Court the next court was the lamp of God where the Justified stands and it was lit by human hands that's where we argue our denominations where we argue our difference and split hairs and oh I don't believe in Divine Healing I don't believe them Visions come from God I don't believe this I don't believe that you're arguing because you're living yet you're eating Mana but you're living under artificial light yeah that's right sometimes the lights goes out sometimes your lamp gets smoked up but the he who desires to hide away walk into the next place there's no artificial light anywhere but down in between the arch of the wings of these Chans was a supernatural light hanging in there which was a Halo of God that Lit the whole room and a man once enter into that Shak kind of Glory Hallelujah that Liv back there in the presence of the dness of this world and
