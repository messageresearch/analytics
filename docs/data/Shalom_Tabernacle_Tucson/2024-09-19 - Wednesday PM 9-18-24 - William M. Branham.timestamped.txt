[28:51] your heart the Lord God the Bible
[28:54] says the Lord God has promised believe
[28:57] or
[28:59] that as many as believe were saved now
[29:02] that sounds awful little but you see
[29:06] when you really believe that's all you
[29:09] can do then God has to when you really
[29:11] believe it then God pours out the Holy
[29:14] Ghost upon you and then God vindicates
[29:18] his
[29:19] word now the Bible said wait a minute I
[29:22] believe before I do this I believe there
[29:23] was go to be a prayer line is that right
[29:27] all right how many wants to go back to
[29:29] Pentecost raise up your hand how many
[29:31] believes that the prescription is still
[29:33] good amen it sure is the Baptist the
[29:36] Holy Ghost not an education not to go up
[29:38] and get your PhD and then when Nicodemus
[29:41] come to the Lord Jesus Jesus he said
[29:44] what must I do to have eternal life a
[29:46] man 80 years old been a priest all his
[29:48] life what must I do to have eternal life
[29:51] Jesus didn't say Go Polish up on your
[29:54] scholarship he didn't say go seek a
[29:56] higher office in your organiz a no he
[30:00] flatly told him he he he absolutely
[30:03] rebuked him for being a man of his
[30:05] caliber and then not knowing those
[30:06] things that you got to be born again we
[30:08] take it too sir that's the same thing
[30:11] tonight see we take it too lightly we
[30:13] just take some kind of sensation say I
[30:15] was borned again and go ahead and your
[30:17] life proves out it doesn't do that
[30:20] something wrong yes sir or you say but I
[30:23] know that man's a good man no matter how
[30:25] good he is that don't have nothing to do
[30:26] with it you don't meet any people in
[30:28] muhammadans and things like that sweet
[30:30] and everything certainly not oh no
[30:33] sometimes heathens Idol worshipers sweet
[30:36] and humble as they can be that doesn't
[30:38] mean nothing no sir these signs shall
[30:41] follow them that believe that's what the
[30:43] doctor said this is the result of the
[30:46] inoculation there you are yes sir that's
[30:50] the thing the doctor said he that
[30:53] believeth on me the works that I do
[30:55] shall he do also of aie did you see it
[31:00] that's a sign of a
[31:01] Believer we take the sign of a good man
[31:04] goes to church and Pays His ties that's
[31:06] good that's fine but that ain't what
[31:08] Jesus said these signs shall follow them
[31:11] the works that I because if the life
[31:14] that's in a peach tree can be taken out
[31:17] of the peach tree and be injected into a
[31:21] apple tree it will no more bear apples
[31:23] but peaches because the germ of Life of
[31:27] peach life is in in the apple tree and
[31:28] it's got to Bear
[31:30] peaches exactly

[36:36] tell Simon that he was a son of
[36:39] Jonas called his name in his father's
[36:42] name you told the woman at the
[36:44] well you your faith of one blind man
[36:48] stops
[36:49] you a little woman with a blood ISU
[36:52] touch the B of your garment wholly
[36:55] impossible for you to feel it physically
[36:57] but you stopped and told her her
[36:59] troubles and said they had
[37:01] ceased let that life that was in Christ
[37:05] come into this group just a few moments
[37:07] Lord that they might know that you're
[37:09] still God I've just got through telling
[37:12] them Lord your word man coming around
[37:15] and saying this that and never a little
[37:17] gimmick but Lord what does it testify of
[37:20] there's a real one
[37:21] somewhere Lord God let it come forth
[37:24] tonight let the Holy Spirit speak and
[37:28] not man give Faith to this church Lord I
[37:31] realize you just couldn't anoint one of
[37:33] us youve got to anoint many of
[37:36] us anoint us together Lord as your
[37:39] church let it be known that you're God
[37:42] and I've told the truth I'm standing on
[37:44] your word even through opposition but
[37:47] I've tried to be true not saying that
[37:50] for myself Lord and not to these people
[37:52] hear me but I'm praying because The
[37:54] Showdown is at hand I pray that you'll
[37:58] vindicate your word tonight Lord that it
[38:00] is the truth that the life that was in
[38:02] Christ lives in his church and his
[38:04] Believers granted father through Jesus
[38:07] Christ's name amen
[38:11] everyone I want everyone
[38:14] to be just as reverent as you
[38:19] can how many in your strangers to me
[38:21] raise up your hands You' never I can
[38:25] just feel it you've never been in the
[38:27] meetings
[38:28] before now Jesus Christ said in his
[38:33] word in St
[38:36] John 1412 he that believeth on me the
[38:40] works that I do shall he do also do you
[38:44] believe
[38:45] that the Bible said Jesus Christ is the
[38:47] same yesterday today and forever you
[38:49] believe that Hebrews
[38:51] 13:8 all right now the only way to know
[38:55] whether it's Christ or not
[38:57] it's not a dress cuz he dressed like
[38:59] ordinary man if he a sure tonight he
[39:00] wears suit of clothes like we got onard
[39:03] it wasn't his dress it wasn't because he
[39:05] had beard or didn't have beard it was a
[39:07] life that was in him that proved what he
[39:10] was lots of people dressed like him in
[39:12] that day but it wasn't he that's right
[39:17] many people today do the same thing but
[39:19] it don't change it a bit it's aive now
[39:22] the way that they know that he was the
[39:24] Christ is because they had to go by what
[39:26] the scripture say said the Christ would
[39:28] be is that right now what did Moses tell
[39:31] them that Christ would be he'd be a
[39:34] prophet like himself is that right and
[39:36] they all look for because God had told
[39:38] him if there be one among you who's
[39:40] spiritual or Prophet I the Lord will
[39:42] speak to him if it is it'll be true if
[39:45] it isn't then no hearing that's only
[39:47] logical and now when Jesus raised up and
[39:50] when he started into his ministry and
[39:53] Simon came up Peter he told him his name
[39:56] was Simon and told him that his name was
[39:59] Simon and his father's name was Jonas is
[40:01] that true that made a Believer out of
[40:03] him Philip went found uh Nathaniel went
[40:07] and found Philip under a tree and said
[40:09] come see who we found and when he told
[40:12] him what had been taken place he didn't
[40:15] kind of disturbed about it and when he
[40:16] got over there Jesus looked right
[40:18] straight at him and said behold an
[40:21] Israelite in whom there's no God he was
[40:23] a he was a teacher he was a man who know
[40:26] it he said rabbi did you ever know me he
[40:29] said before Philip called you when you
[40:31] under the tree I saw you said Rabbi
[40:34] you're the Son of God you're the king of
[40:36] Israel that's settled it see the woman
[40:39] at the well when he spoke to her many
[40:42] all through the scripture they know that
[40:44] when he was coming he was going to be a
[40:45] god Prophet that was his sign it's
[40:48] always been still
[40:49] is then he notice that when we find out
[40:54] this woman come out he said woman bring
[40:56] me a drink want to care conversation
[40:58] with her she say it's not customary for
[41:00] Jews ask me a woman of Samaria such
[41:03] things we don't have no dealings with
[41:04] one another he said but if you knew who
[41:06] you were talking to you'd ask me for a
[41:08] drink she said the wells deep you have
[41:11] nothing to draw with and so forth he
[41:13] said go get your husband and come here
[41:16] she said I have no
[41:18] husband he said that's right you've had
[41:20] five and the one you're living with is
[41:22] not your husband you told the truth she
[41:24] said sir now when the Pharisees him do
[41:27] that they said he's a fortune teller be
[41:30] El but that prostitute she said sir but
[41:35] that prostitute she said sir I perceive
[41:39] that you are a
[41:40] prophet we know that when the Messiah
[41:43] cometh he'll tell us these things
[41:45] that'll be the sign of the
[41:47] Messiah we know when he comes he'll tell
[41:49] us these things he said I'm he that
[41:52] speaks to you and right away she run
[41:55] into the City and said come see a man
[41:57] who told me the things I've done isn't
[41:59] this the very Messiah and the man of the
[42:01] city believed the woman and believed on
[42:04] Christ is that
[42:06] right no wonder he said if I do not the
[42:08] works of my father believe me not beuc
[42:11] now we don't have to be smart we don't
[42:13] have to be educated we have to
[42:17] believe we have to Humble ourselves and
[42:20] empty ourselves for God to manifest
[42:22] himself through us out empty up yourself
[42:26] get yourself out the way the biggest
[42:28] enemy you have is
[42:31] yourself now you believe
[42:35] God do you do
[42:37] it our
[42:39] father now if God our Father father
[42:43] which is the Holy Ghost the father of
[42:46] our Lord Jesus Christ is the Holy Ghost
[42:48] we know that that which is conceived in
[42:51] her is of the Holy Ghost and if that
[42:53] Holy Spirit can come into you and I and
[42:56] perform the very life that Christ liveed
[42:59] was your place of
[43:01] Doubt then I've told you the truth about
[43:04] returning going
[43:06] back you believe that if he will do it I
[43:09] don't say he will I remember people
[43:12] believe that these days is pass but he
[43:13] promised it in the last days have to be
[43:16] loyal to this office each one of us has
[43:18] offices we have to be loyal to this
[43:21] office God it's the word the words made
[43:25] flesh and dwelt Among Us in the word
[43:27] tonight is in our flesh to manifest
[43:29] itself to prove that he's God in
[43:31] us it bears fruit of it certain I told
[43:35] you the spirit of Dillinger was in me
[43:37] you expect me to have guns I told you
[43:40] the spirit of of uh artist is in me
[43:42] expect me to paint a picture of if I
[43:45] tell you the spirit of Christ is in me
[43:46] then do the work of Christ that's what
[43:49] he
[43:50] said would it help you to
[43:53] believe let me tell you a little
[43:55] something speaking out of quanas before
[43:57] some
[43:58] doctors at a meeting the other day i'
[44:01] taken a physical with a famous doctor
[44:03] I'm going overseas had a physical
[44:05] examination I did this purposely and he
[44:08] was let me give me an upper lower GI
[44:10] natur taking the heart blood and
[44:12] everything thank God is fast so when I I
[44:16] drink in this SP meal I just made myself
[44:18] real tense and he pressed on my stomach
[44:21] looked through the X-ray he said brother
[44:22] Brandon I said yes sir he said your
[44:25] stomach feels normally but it
[44:27] nothing goes out I said it's supposed to
[44:30] he said yes I said I don't I said it's
[44:33] supposed to he said yes sir I don't
[44:35] understand he said my I don't understand
[44:39] I said um what shall I do he said think
[44:42] of something real good to
[44:43] eat I said why you we do that father
[44:46] what he's say and he said a nice big
[44:49] juicy steak I said I'll compromise for a
[44:50] plate a fried squirrel with pinto beans
[44:53] and he said all right start off I
[44:55] changed and start thinking he said there
[44:57] she
[44:58] goes I said what did that doc he said a
[45:01] little electrical war in your brain sent
[45:03] word down to your stomach I said is that
[45:06] right then speaking I said you remember
[45:08] the little wire I said Doctor what makes
[45:11] you dream did you dream he said yes I
[45:14] said what is it a part of you that's
[45:15] dreaming he said you're
[45:17] subconscious I said a normal human
[45:19] here's one conscious and here's a
[45:21] subconscious you have to go to sleep to
[45:23] get into that conscious he just told me
[45:24] he said I found something brother
[45:26] Brandon again I can't explain it said
[45:28] it's not your nerves he said it's
[45:30] something inside of your nerves I said
[45:32] my soul he said yes said I it is what
[45:35] makes you what you are and I said I
[45:38] asked him about Vision he didn't know
[45:39] nothing about it so I told him I said
[45:41] one conscience is your the other when
[45:43] here you have to get out of this
[45:44] conscious let it become darant in order
[45:46] to get in here but some part of you went
[45:48] somewhere because you can remember
[45:50] dreams and places you was at in your
[45:52] dreams years and years away so that's
[45:55] right I said you see that's an armal but
[45:59] God so sets it to some of us that our
[46:02] first conscience and subconscious is
[46:03] right together we don't go to sleep God
[46:06] just uses it to see things that was and
[46:08] which is and shall come that's
[46:11] prophetic and he said Mr brandom I've
[46:13] read your books on healing he said I
[46:15] certainly agree with you so I'm going to
[46:17] tell you said we have absolute cases
[46:20] here I can prove it science if there's a
[46:22] doctor poost can tell you that he said
[46:25] let a person have a ignacy or a tuber or
[46:28] an ulcer or something that's real bad we
[46:31] know it's go to kill him and we'll tell
[46:33] him that and said if he gets all tore up
[46:35] flustrated angry upset and going on that
[46:39] that patient will die right away but so
[46:41] that patient usually if he's a Christian
[46:43] or something he doesn't mind dying it's
[46:45] just one of the things we have to do
[46:48] dying is part of living so he just goes
[46:50] ahead and takes it on I'll lift you my
[46:52] times out so almost that attitude
[46:55] retires that case
[46:57] said he'll Linger on and on and on and
[46:59] on before he kills him I said all right
[47:02] doctor let me finish my story I said put
[47:04] a lie detector on your arm and stand and
[47:07] try your best to make a lie sound like
[47:09] the truth and watch that needle go
[47:10] negative wasn't why it's a viberation in
[47:13] your nerves you wasn't made to lie you
[47:16] were made to tell the
[47:18] truth a lie such a horrible thing till
[47:21] it interrupts your nerves you ain't made
[47:23] to be angry you're supposed to be at
[47:25] peace like a child with God
[47:28] you're not supposed to be frustrated
[47:30] you're supposed to have
[47:31] faith walk with God see I said that's it
[47:36] I said now doctor if the this man living
[47:40] in his first conscience can take the
[47:41] attitude that if he dies he safe so what
[47:43] difference does it make it'll retire the
[47:45] case for a long time what will it do
[47:48] when it drops out of that first
[47:50] conscious back into the second on the
[47:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll take the
[47:54] case completely away
[47:57] that doctor raised up and said marvelous
[47:59] tears run down his cheek I said Doctor
[48:01] you know what's the matter I said our
[48:03] churches don't teach that he said Mr
[48:05] random that's truth I said we need to go
[48:08] back to Pentecost he said I'm
[48:09] Presbyterian said my wife is
[48:11] Presbyterian I said you join a
[48:13] presbyterian law Jes said that's about
[48:16] it I said Doctor a Christian is born
[48:18] again you can't go Jin you got to be
[48:21] born he said Mr Brandon that's the truth
[48:23] and tears get around down his
[48:25] cheeks what baptizing pretty soon
[48:29] now
[48:32] what your fluster will hold that up
[48:35] there and your one conscious will drop
[48:37] it down and make your body function
[48:39] right what will it do when you let the
[48:41] Holy Spirit roll
[48:43] in it'll perform everything that Christ
[48:46] promised you become an instrument of the
[48:49] Holy
[48:50] Spirit got Piere when I was born there's
[48:53] a light hanging there you got the
[48:54] picture here somewhere that's true truth
[48:57] science the truth dying over this
[48:59] platform science has proved it the truth
[49:02] not to me I'm a man I'm
[49:04] nothing I'm just your brother the
[49:07] there's nothing to me predestin but the
[49:10] holy spirit in predestination for
[49:13] ordained gifts God has set in the church
[49:16] not want some Elder lady's hands on God
[49:19] said in the church first apostles then
[49:22] prophets and so forth God set them in
[49:24] there there are Divine gifts for
[49:27] ordained of
[49:28] God before Jeremiah the prophet has ever
[49:31] born God said I know you for you even in
[49:33] your mother's belly and ordained you a a
[49:35] prophet to the Nations before you ever
[49:37] come out of the womb is that right he
[49:39] had nothing to do with it God does that
[49:41] he's still
[49:44] God and you believe with all your heart
[49:47] and you that sick or have a need of God
[49:50] you say Lord God I've heard this message
[49:53] astounding to me I've heard this man
[49:55] claim that you're God and you're right
[49:57] you're in the midst of people if he
[49:58] isn't he told something wrong wherever
[50:00] two or three are gathered in my name
[50:02] there I am in the midst of them why he's
[50:04] in you anyhow and when he divide himself
[50:07] among you it comes back to a unit
[50:10] again now you had to be part of that
[50:12] unit to believe that this part of the
[50:14] unit can operate Ministry it if he give
[50:18] me a Ministry he's got somebody he'll
[50:20] believe it or there' be no need of
[50:21] giving me a Ministry that's right you
[50:25] believe with all your heart and see if
[50:27] God doesn't do the thing I don't want
[50:29] you people with prayer cards I want you
[50:32] people hasn't got prayer cards C I'm
[50:35] going to call the prayer cards I want
[50:37] you to take this in your
[50:39] mind I be a real Reverend Christ now
[50:44] Christ could heal because he healed by
[50:46] Vision when the father told him that's
[50:49] right he never healed anybody or perform
[50:51] one Miracle until he saw a vision first
[50:53] how many knows that St John 5:19
[50:57] he said it himself he's G and can't
[51:00] lie but you see healing has already been
[51:03] purchased now the sacrifice is made he
[51:06] can still Proclaim himself by prophecy
[51:09] and show his signs but healing you have
[51:11] to believe him if you standing here
[51:14] night and you say Lord will you heal me
[51:15] you say I've already done it don't you
[51:16] believe it for he was wounded for our
[51:19] transgressions with his stripes we were
[51:21] healed do you understand that alive you
[51:25] believe it and see if he's still alive
[51:28] Lord what a
[51:31] challenge I challenge that before half a
[51:34] million people standing against me
[51:36] Bombay India I challenged it before
[51:39] 250,000 Duran South Africa watch God
[51:42] moving on the
[51:44] scene 30,000 blanket natives throw down
[51:47] their idols and become Christians at
[51:49] that minute women start naked as soon as
[51:52] Christ come up on them folded their
[51:54] hands and walked away and then women
[51:55] today in the Pentecostal Church cutting
[51:58] off their clothes and acting and then
[52:00] still say you got the Holy
[52:02] Ghost I'm I love you you know that but
[52:06] I'm I'm I'm zealous when I see my sister

[52:21] herself like some Street woman instead
[52:24] of a saint of God truth see some man

[54:31] high priest that can be touched by the
[54:32] feeling of our infirmities did he say it
[54:35] that's the New Testament well then if
[54:37] you touch the high priest how would you

[1:18:31] this we cut the switch there this year
[1:18:34] may seem very
[1:18:36] strange but it's only obeying an act of
[1:18:40] God if you believe that you repent and
[1:18:43] or baptized you're candidate for the
[1:18:44] Holy Ghost that's right see well what by
[1:18:48] Minister a servant of Christ who's
[1:18:51] brought you the truth Minister the word
[1:18:54] of God to you then if God comes in his
[1:18:57] word and they preach the word and the
[1:19:00] Holy Spirit comes down and proves that
[1:19:03] to be the
[1:19:05] truth see friends what happened just a
[1:19:09] while ago I I don't know God in heaven
[1:19:12] knows I don't
[1:19:13] know or whatever it was it must have
[1:19:15] been glorious because my heart's beating
[1:19:17] real fast with joy it was something now
[1:19:21] it looks to me like that a born again
[1:19:25] church that claims the new birth and are
[1:19:29] the time of the coming of Christ at hand
[1:19:32] why with the uh evidence a positive
[1:19:36] evidence if there was a man standing
[1:19:38] here with a long row bone his scars and
[1:19:40] his hand blood running out of his face
[1:19:42] that still wouldn't be the Christ any
[1:19:45] impostor could do
[1:19:47] that but the life that was in Christ be
[1:19:50] reproduced then you know it's
[1:19:53] Christ Hallelujah
[1:19:55] I'm preaching one of these nights on a
[1:19:57] paradox and that was a paradox you just
[1:20:00] seen it's something that can't be
[1:20:02] explained see it's a miracle that how
[1:20:05] the god of Heaven can produce such now
[1:20:08] you say could you heal me brother B it's
[1:20:10] impossible you're already healed if he
[1:20:13] was standing here wearing my suit that
[1:20:15] he give me he couldn't do no more that's
[1:20:18] all he could do was vindicate that he's
[1:20:21] Christ prove that he's here you have to
[1:20:24] believe him I can if you believe that's
[1:20:27] it right now if you believe it that's
[1:20:29] all there is to it it looks to me like
[1:20:31] an AR latify it ought to send people to
[1:20:34] repentance it ought to send people
[1:20:36] seeking for the Holy Ghost it ought to
[1:20:39] do something more than it's a
[1:20:40] doing is a food is a rock is a word seed
[1:20:45] falling upon Stony
[1:20:50] ground ladies the church the answer
[1:20:55] Brethren Church what's the answer what
[1:20:58] more can God do he never promised
[1:21:00] another
[1:21:01] thing you'll never see nothing no
[1:21:04] greater than the presence of Jesus
[1:21:07] Christ working in his church performing
[1:21:09] the things that he promised to
[1:21:14] do but you
[1:21:16] know something happened to the church
[1:21:19] what do you think it took place if 50
[1:21:21] years ago that would have broke through
[1:21:23] see it's
[1:21:26] got see it's got to be more powerful now
[1:21:30] to shake the church
[1:21:32] harder as an enemy comes in like a flood
[1:21:35] the spirit of God Rises a standard
[1:21:37] against
[1:21:38] it one of these days it will raise a
[1:21:40] church come out of its place the Born
