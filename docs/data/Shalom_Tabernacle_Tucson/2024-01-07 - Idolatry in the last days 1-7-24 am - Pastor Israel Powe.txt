========================================

today is our prayer we ask in jesus' name amen Revelation 6 verse1 and 2 and I saw when the lamb open one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the force beasts saying come and see and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him had a bow and a crown and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer amen so as we prepare to go there let's sing only believe only believe only believe all things are possible only [Music] believe only believe only believe all things are possible oh let's lift our hand and say Lord I believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things things are possible Lord I believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe God bless you may be seated brother brandom and and the Jews will make a covenant with one another the Bible said they would with the holy people and I notice they'll make it because why this nation is going to be busted and the rest of the world it's on the gold standard is busted you know that if we're living off of taxes do bills for 40 years from now where are we at there's only one thing can happen that's to call in the currency and pay off the bonds and we can't do it Wall Street owns them and wall Street's controlled by the Jews the rest of it's in the Vatican and the Jews has got the rest of it in Wall Street with the Commerce of the world we can't call it in and if they could do it you think these whiskey guys and and all these tobacco people which billions times billions of dollars a year and write off all their income tax for old vulgar pictures and things like that go out in Arizona there and buy millions of acres of land of thousands and dig down big Wells at $50,000 and pay it off with income tax and they put you in jail if you don't pay yours but they ride it off and throw up wells and send Bull noers in and what do they do they put housing projects in there and the next term around with their money they made they got to make an investment and put houses projects in there and sell them for millions of dollars you think them guys is going to compromise to change the currency like this fellow down here and um what's his name Castro did he done the only smart thing he ever did do then when he destroyed the bomb PID them off and Destroy notice but we can't do that these guys won't that the rich meres of the earth hold it amen and there's only one thing to do but the Catholic church can pay it off she's the only one's got the money and she can do it and she will do it and in doing this to get it she'll compromise with the Jews and make a covenant that's right and when she makes this Covenant with the Jews now remember I'm taking this from the scripture am all now when she does this and makes this Covenant we notice in Daniel 8:23 and 25 he will cause craft to prosper and crab is manufactur in his hand and he makes his Covenant with the Jews in the midst of this three and a half years he breaks his Covenant as soon as he gets the thing wrapped up and gets the money of the Jews tied up and when he does that oh my oh my he's called the Antichrist until the end of the church age for he he is the he and his children are against Christ and the word this man's called the Antichrist now he's going to hold of money and that's where I think he'll come in just a minute I say this and we go back to it a minute he's called the Antichrist and will be called the Antichrist in the sight of God until the end time now but then you'll be called something else now when he gets the money all under control then he'll break this Covenant with the Jews as Daniel here said he would do it in the midst of the last half of the 70 weeks of Daniel and then brother what will he do he'll have all of the world trade in the Commerce packed with the world because he'll hold the wealth of the world completely and during that time them two prophets arise on the scene and call that 144,000 then what will take place then the mark of the beast of Revelations 13 will set in because he holds all the Commerce trade and everything in the world and what will take place then the mark of the beast will come in that no man can buy or sell except him that has the mark of the beast thank God the church will be enjoying a great three and a half years you don't have to go through that I not it at the end time at the end of the church ages now he is called he and his children are called the Antichrist calls anything that's against Christ is Antichrist and anything that's against the word is against Christ because Christ is the word he Antichrist then in Revelations 1279 when Satan is cast out the accuser you'll put that down because want you read we haven't got time now it's course 15 but in the revelations 12 7 and9 Satan the spirit the devil which is up there now accuser of our Brethren all right the church is taken up and Satan is cast out when the church goes up Satan comes down then Satan incarnates himself in the Antichrist and is called the beast then Revelations 13 He sets the mark down amen see when he that lth only now Christianity is left on the earth and is Purity is because him that led it remember back here in Thessalonians setting up the temple of God God call himself God forgiving sins on Earth and that'll go on and iniquity shall abound and all CA won't be known yet until it's time to be revealed his called and then the church will be caught away and when it's caught away then he changes himself from an antichrist now oh my the church the great church now he becomes the Beast I wish I could make people see that I remember the Antichrist and the is the same self Spirit there's a trinity yes sir it's three stages of the same devil power remember Nicolia see it had to be incarnate before it could be crowned see now watch this three stages first stage is called Antichrist second stage is called the false prophet third stage he's called the beast notice nickia the Antichrist teaching has started in the days of Paul against God's word Antichrist then he's called again the false prophet which when the teaching become a man he was a prophet to the teaching of the hierarchy of the the hierarchy of the Catholic Church the Pope was the prophet to the false word and that made him a false prophet the third stage is the Beast a man that's crowned in the last days with every Power that Pagan Rome ever had because the seven headed beast dragon was cast out of heaven and come incarnate in the false prophet there it is he had seven crowns and he was cast out and thrown into the Earth and received all right what are we saying who is this Rider this horse rider you know what it is it's Satan's Superman I went the other night two brothers sitting in this church now brother Norman back there and I believe brother Fred was over to hear a man teach on the Antichrist a wellknown man one of the best Assemblies of God is God and His interpretation of antichrist was that they're going take a bidam of some sort out of a of a man and transfer this life out of a man into a great image it's going to stick step a city block at a time and that's could you imagine a man filled with the Holy Ghost under such illusion as that claim to be when here is the Bible says who the Antichrist is it's not a it's a man notice this writer is nothing but Satan's Superman an incarnate Devil he's an educated genius I hope you got your ears open is trying one of his children out not long go on a television cast to see if it wasn't smarter than next man to run for presidency but however he's got a lot of wisdom so Satan he tries to sell it he sold it to Eve he sold it to us we've been wanting a Superman we got it all right the whole world's Wan a Superman they're going to get it just wait till the church goes up and Satan's cast out he'll incarnate that's right they want somebody who can really do the job he'll do it educated this is a Satan Superman with education with wisdom with church Theology of his own word of his own making and he rides his white denominational horse to deceive the people yeah and he will conquer every religion of the world because they've all gone into the confederation of of the of churches and the world Confederation of churches and they already got their buildings building everything setting right in line there ain't one thing left every denomination stuck right into it a Federation of churches and what's back in it Rome and the popes now crying we're all one let's come together and walk together and these people even some of you Full Gospel people deny have to deny your Evangelical teaching to take such a step as that what have you done so blind to that denominational thing you've rejected truth and truth is set before him and they they walked away from it and left it and now they've been given over to a strong delusion to believe a lie and be damned with it it's exactly what it is and the Antichrist takes it all and the Bible said that he deceived all a amen all upon the face of the Earth whose names were not written under those Shields from the [Applause] found now if the Bible said he did it he did it they say well I BL there you are that's just exactly it's the same prostitutes uh Institution it's the same system that started in the beginning which is Antichrist throughout I'll hear from it but that's it's a truth I expect now notice he'll conquer and almost has in his grip right now while he's still Antichrist before he becomes Beast you talk about cruel punishment you just wait watch what Dage left your old Earth will have to go through there will be weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth for the dragon Rome spurted water out of his mouth to make war with the remant of the woman's seed that was left upon the Earth after the bride had been selected and took out and the dragon made war with the rib that didn't want to come in but hunted down and the real Church would go through that if it was possible but you see there are done under this Blood by the grace of Christ no tribulation next thing for the church [Music] is oh how I love this let me tell you we're telling why a conquer he's going to do and he's really going to conquer he's already done it it's just already solded up that's all we short for the money filthy ler exactly they love money more than God everything they think about now is how much money's he got what is it you know it's been said lots of times give the church the money and she'll revolutionize the world give the church the money and she'll stand evangelist all over the world and what will she do she will conquer the world for Christ let me tell you something my poor Li friend the world's not won by money but by the blood of Jesus Christ give God man whose Gall man will stand on that word libert eye that'll conquer there'll only be one thing that can conquer those that's got their names written in the land's Book of Life from the foundation of the world that's the only thing you'll hear it money won't have nothing to do with the send them farther into the denominational Traditions let's see yes with educational genius he'll be he'll be smart my my my all of his children around him will be smart P HD l l d dou l d Qs a b c d f on down diseas still have it all smart why it's after the order of Satan any shrewd craft against the Bible is of Satan that's exactly what he tuck Eve with Eve said oh it's written God said first not do that he said but wait surely God won't do it but I'll open your eyes and give you some wisdom she got it yes we've been wanting it and we got it too this nation notice he'll conquer the whole religious World he'll conquer make a covenant with Daniel's people here it is both in the Gentile and in the Daniel's people the Jews for the last week and here we are even draw out on boards and you see it perfectly there's where it is thank God there he is that organizational system is of the devil that's no punches pulled on it either exactly it's a root of the devil it's a and not not people not people in there them are God's people many of but you know what when we get over here we get these trumpets sounding next time I come by these trumpets sounding remember when them last angels that third Angel come across come out of her my people and that angel found us at the same time that message Dro sh for the last trumpet last Angel's message last seal open all happens at the same time that's all up and goes over into eternity now what at the same time that this guy's a conquered and I'll close God's going to do something then too that's not just give Satan all the credit here let's not talk about him all together see while this great thing is going out there this great system winding in these organizations in a union so they can pull themselves together and stand against communism and not knowing of God raised up communism to conquer sure what what what made communism rise in Russia because of the impurity of the Roman Church and the rest of iten they took all the money there was in Russia and starve the people to death and give them nothing instead and live just like the rest of the world I was down in Mexico not long ago and see I'm poor little children any Catholic country is not even self-supporting it's not a one of them ask me where show me where they're at any Catholic controlled country can't even support its own South France Italy and all them Mexico wherever you go they're not self-supporting why the church took everything to have that's the reason Russia kicked it out what's what taken place I know this myself I stand down there and you think that golden jubilee was on you hear the bells ringing and you hear a poor little woman coming down the street dragging her feet and a father packing a baby and two or three of them crying she was doing Penance to some dead woman up there that her thought she get to Go to Heaven by oh what a pitiful thing then I see stand down there here come their economics are so poorly balanced the church takes everything to God here a little Poncho uh uh maybe uh maybe Poncho Frank he comes down and he's a brick mason and he make he makes a 20 pesos a week but it'll take the whole 20 pesos buying a pair of shoes that's your economics but now here what about then if if he being a Mason and a brick layer and makees 20 PES a week just say I don't know what he makes but say that kind of economic or way it's balanced up notice now if he makes 20 PES a week Here Comes Chico see which means little one and he works out there for about five pay SS a week and he's got 10 kids to feed but there'll be somebody knocking on his door to take about five of those pays or four of them anyhow to pay for some grease candle to burn on a million dollar gold order for his sin amen there you are that's a balance of the economic that's the way the countries are the thing takes it all the church takes it all she's just got it in her hands that's all her with the money of the Jews in that Covenant the Bible said they'll take the whole thing and then he becomes a beast he breaks his Covenant he ravishes he tears out the rest of that woman's seed like that and Spurs water out of his mouth makes war and be weeping and wailing and Ash the teeth and the brides getting married in glory same time don't miss it friend God help me I want to be there I don't care what I want to be there I notice in the same time this is going on just before this takes place rather on the earth God has promised while all them Scruples of denominations arguing their difference about the Creed God promised that he would send us a true prophet of the true word with a message to return to the original word of God and the faith of the fathers bring down the power of the Holy Ghost amongst the people with a power that will raise her above these things that take her [Music] [Applause] in same word be Vindicated of Jesus Christ that he is the same yesterday today and forever l i Am With You Always even to the consummation and the works that I do shall you do also I'll be right with you a little while and they won't see me no more because you'll organize themselves and Scatter out but you'll see me for I will be with you I'll even be in you unto the consummation when he said s Nation should be poured out after consummation there you heart oh God who is that white horse rider you're not blind you see who it is it's that Antichrist that deceitful Spirit that's gone now and crept in made see God just keeps repeating it he shows as a man going forth with the White Horse and with his bow and no Arrow he's a bluff he has no power say the power of the church where is it at what do they do they say we're the original Church the original Church cast out Devils heal the sick and raise the dead salt visions and everything else where is it now the bluff B with no eror that's right but you see when Christ come a sword went forth from his mouth like a lightning flesh it went forth and consumed his enemies he Cast Away the Devils he cut away everything else and he calmed his vesture di in Blood and on his thigh was written the word of God Amen here he comes with his army coming from Heaven that white horse Rider's been in the land all the time he will change from Antichrist he does that and becomes to a false prophet see he first started Antichrist the spirit then he become a false prophet then later when the devil is cast out he's in carnate then with the devil three stages the first he's a devil to begin with a spirit of the devil then he becomes a false prophet teacher of a false Doctrine next thing he comes is the very Devil Himself incarnate see there he is and at the same time that this devil falls out of heaven and becomes incarnate in a man the Holy Spirit goes up and comes down incarnate man oh my what a Time thank you [Music] Jesus [Music] h [Music] oh [Music] h [Music] in

chapter 3 and I believe I have another scripture in Exodus 7 second Timothy chapter 3 verse number one this know also that in the last days perilous time shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection Tru Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away for this is the sort are they which creep into houses and Lead captive silly women Laden with sins LED away with diverse lusts ever learning never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now as Janice and jambus withstood Moses so do these resist the truth men of corrupt Minds Repro great concerning the faith but they shall proceed no further for their Folly shall be made manifest unto all men as theirs also was but thou H has fully known my Doctrine manner of life purpose Faith longsuffering charity patience persecutions a afflictions which came unto me at Antioch and Ikon and lisra what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me amen I can stand with Paul on that one he's delivered me out of some mighty tight places oh my he's delivered me out of all of them amen and take one more scripture in Exodus chapter 7 verse number 10 and Moses and Aaron went unto pharaoh and they did so as the Lord had commanded right and Aaron cast down his Rod before pharaoh and before his servants and it became a serpent then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers Now The Magicians of Egypt they also did in like manner with their enchantments for they cast down every man his rod and they became serpents but Aaron's Rod swallowed up their rods and he hardened Pharaoh's heart that he hearkened not unto them as the Lord had say Amen take a little title this morning idolatry in the last days idolatry in the last days and um just dealing with this last day uh issue that we are all dealing with these perilous times so let us pray Lord we ask your blessing on your word you bless your people we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated now in speaking on the last days the first prophet to actually see the Gentile kingdoms from the beginning to the end was the Prophet Daniel and brother random brings it out and and um I think we'll read a little bit there in Daniel chapter 2 if you'll just turn there quickly but this um here at the church we were sharing with the church here this dream that brother Billy Paul had of the uh where his dad came into the church and he had fire in his eyes and we read that to you when we played it for you how many remember that what message was that in can you remember can somebody help meas no not Blasphemous names what what what message was it there's a man that turn on oh you guys know it now there's a man that can turn on the light and it it was a dream that shook brother Billy Paul up and brother brandom says that's exactly scriptural because in this dream brother uh brandom says before between now and daylight the Lord will come and he saw this great Stone cut out without hands and it smote a great image well let's take Daniel chapter 2 just for a moment and just to get a little bit of what this King saw and so verse remember I can't take it all this morning but I'll take some of it in verse 31 thou oh King sawest and behold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible this image head was of fine gold his breast and his arms of silver his belly and his thighs of brass his legs of iron his feet part iron and part clay thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands which smote the image upon his feet that were all that were of iron and clay and break them to Pieces then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broke into pieces together and became like the chaff of The Summer's threshing floor and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that SM the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth now brother bam tells us that that stone was Christ and he smites this image and this image the head of gold the breast of silver the thighs of brass and then the legs of iron and the feet iron and Clay mixture the prophet tells us and many historians and many many many Protestant Bible readers know that these were the Gentile kingdoms this is what Daniel saw he saw uh an interpretation actually of what King Nebuchadnezzar saw this King ungodly King you could call him whatever but he saw he sees this dream he needs an interpretation Daniel brings the interpretation of what this is and Daniel actually sees uh uh this great Kingdom of the Gentiles which this is our time he sees the beginning and the ending of the Gentile dispensation now we know brothers and sisters what time it is don't we we know that we're not looking for a great Revival to come and get a bride ready for to hear the message of Malachi 4 we're not waiting for Elijah to come we already know that he has come like the disciples they didn't even know that John had already come and Jesus said he's already come and they did what was said they would do to him so they missed the timing a little bit that's not us today we know what time it is we know that Israel is a very important piece in God's time that God tells time with them we know that there is coming a persecution last Wednesday night we played in the message here the uh uh uh um Church order in 63 and in there he put in there he said it right in there he says now remember they're going to close the doors of this church one day I don't know what that's going to look like all I know is that the church doors have been open all I know is that when I want to go to church I can go freely we don't know what it looks like I can tell you this it's not going to be easy time no sir and I don't think a halfway prayer life is going to get you ready for that time and I don't think we should wait I wouldn't gamble with my soul to wait to see things happen to wait somebody you know who we think is going to be president and who is this and who wait for this to happen and then start trying to get ready I I don't think that's why the prophet came I think the prophet came so that you can hear what he had to say so that you can get yourself ready now let let me say this in every Church in whatever Church you're born in or you ever come in to the message that church has a culture and that church has a way that they do things they have their emphasis and the things that they don't emphasize they might be loud and Rowdy or they might be quiet and still that's it with all of us we all come in under some kind of way or the other and you know what I think there's a little Grace for us if if we were born in the church that didn't emphasize certain things that are hidden in the word and I think that God will wink upon you if you are in an assembly or are accustomed to an assembly that didn't really cherish the message like they should but it's so beautiful that he's made it available where you and I can hear the message for ourselves and then when you hear it for yourself then there's no excuses it's not the pastor's fault it's not the piano player's fault it's not the organist's fault it's not the false teacher fault God sent you Elijah and when you take it personal it will bless you personal amen amen so so he gives Every Man a chance to say Amen to the word amen I don't have to pick up somebody else's message book that's already been underlined for me and here I already highlighted for you say Amen where I said no no no no he gives me a chance to hear it for myself I thank God for it Saints I thank God for it cuz now I don't have to ask anybody permission on how to worship or permission on when to say Amen or permission on which quote is valid or not I I'm not asking nobody permission God sent me a message Glory Hallelujah and it's my message and I handled it like it's mine very personally amen and you can handle it that way too praise the Lord so God gives each of us an opportunity to say Amen to the word he says that in the spoken word is the Original Seed each generation gets a chance at the word he says that so we see in this last day that there would be this um the the these kingdoms that be beginning and the ending of them and what brother brandom said about them and the things that would happen and we see a lot of things develop here around the message so to say and the groups and the different influences that have pulled in certain directions there people are doing things that we' have never seen before pastors have never seen this before people in church have never seen people uh behave the way they behaved before I went to bury my good friend brother Al Albert stole there in Jasper Texas fine Brother how many you know him amen he's on the harmony of the desert singing I want a Godly attitude he wrote that song I want to walk like the Lord talk like the Lord live like the Lord I want a Godly attitude in everything that I do you need to go hear that one and as I went back there was it was sad because we had to uh say goodbye to our brother I'm glad because his suffering is over here on this Earth but there is a condition there where you I was sad because there were so many Believers there in this little town little city of Jasper that are not going to church anywhere and for what reason and the reasons why is probably a long list reason as to why used to be a thriving church and Ministry there it's not there anymore lots of Believers there and none of them gathered together to um honor the Lord as to coming together to to Fellowship in the church as it were now that might be agreeable or disagreeable it might be you might be able to understand it or not but that's what it is and so you see these uh things and conditions that you know that's something I've never seen before like that I couldn't understand why a condition to be that way but there's there's a background to it but in this Vision that uh Nebuchadnezzar sees and that Daniel interprets brother random now shares with us that those were the Gentile Kingdoms in the future now in Revelations chapter 17 you'll see John sees this great Beast brother ROM talked about it in the a first seal this morning Sunday School he sees this beast and Daniel sees the same beast but when Daniel sees it it's four separate beasts it's a a bear a leopard a terrible strong Beast a lion and the teeth the Beast that had teeth and so forth they were separated and and and but when John sees them they're all put together and they're just one Beast brother brandom tells us that but here in the message one think you're of Christ here brother brandom tells us 1954 paragraph 29 he says Daniel that great prophet who saw the beginning of or the same time he saw it down through to the end through an image surely he saw Jesus in there somewhere if he saw the beginning with the head of gold King Nebuchadnezzar and the Gentile Kingdom he saw the mees and Persians and the brass and so forth out into the Roman ROM Empire unto his coming what think ye of Christ and brother mam continues in the message seven Church ages and he says this 1954 in paragraph 50 he says we'll get it in a few moments showing how the Old Testament typed up in the seven Church ages seven ages set or seven churches set here in Asia which the Bible plainly teaches which was a shadow or type of the seven Church ages that was coming and by God's help with the Bible can prove that every Church age landed just exactly where it said it would just exactly where the Bible said it would and we're at the end of the last Church age I can go back in the Old Testament pick up Daniel's dream and show you the vision of the Gentile Kingdom how that he saw an image standing with the head head of gold breast of silver thighs of brass feet and legs of iron and clay and show how every one of those kingdoms have succeeded one another just exactly the way the Bible said and look the head of gold Babylon me in Persia Greek the Roman Empire and the Roman Empire broke up into 10 kingdoms eastern and western Rome and so forth and in there there was iron and clay and they wouldn't mix together Protestant and Catholicism under the same Gentile domination and he said that even they would even try to break one another's power they would intermar with one another just exactly what they're doing today and that the kingdom in the days of those kings the god of Heaven cut a stone out of the mountain without hands that's Stone this image in the feet and broke all the Gentile kingdoms down and the kingdom of Christ ruled and rained and growed and covered the earth and the Sea and the sky the Gentile kingdoms faded away like trash like the husk of a thrashing floor in the summertime what a picture that we're living in that's true and today you see Catholic and Protestant marrying among one another trying to break the power down raise your children have to promise him to raise them this way or that way we'll get into that after a bit so here brother bam is now showing us what that mountain was in Daniel chapter 2 can you say Amen it was Christ right just read it for you Rose up it smoted this image and the image are the Gentile kingdoms now many of the secular teachers and preachers and many many Bible historians and people that uh that are maybe not in the message they know and they use this prophecy of Daniel as proof of the Bible's validity because when Daniel gives this prophecy and Nebuchadnezzar sees this dream written and showing the kingdoms that would come into power the history proves it out exactly it happened just that way those those four kingdoms it's beautiful so the Propet is now showing us who that Christ was what that stone was and how it smote that image shows us the beginning and the ending of an age now we know that we're in the last day we're in the end time with the very closing time of this world's history we know that the gospel next goes to the Jews They will receive it they will accept it and God will do Mighty Works amongst them but just before that happens there's a little there's a catching away that comes there's a revelation that strikes the gentile people that he calls out a gentile Bride for now when you can identify what time of the day it is or what day of the week it is and then you can see where you are in the scriptures it does something to your heart it makes it the main thing it highlights it's above everything every other plan you know we all have plans as human beings and aspirations and dreams some of them we'll realize and some of them we won't but there's one thing I don't want to miss and there's one thing I don't want to be ready for that I want to be ready for and that's this great catching away and that's this great revelation of the last day Church the last day bride just before he goes back to the Jews amen amen so these are wonderful things for us to preach on to teach on shows us that we're not going to be here much too longer look at your neighbor and say neighbor we're getting out of here look at them good all of y'all didn't say it now we're getting out of here it won't be very long you know if that make you mad stay mad all but for for me I'm I'm ready to go I mean I don't want to stay here an extra week to get caught up on what to see what happened no I'm ready to go as the Lord would call us and this is part of why we have gathered here this morning I sure hope so I sure hope we didn't just gather so we can see who came who didn't I sure hope that we're Gathering to be ready for the coming of the Lord and a great catch in way here brother brandom says this here in this message the mark of the beast I'll take several out of this one 1954 paragraph 153 the prophet of God says this here now we're going to come down notice a little further let me get this to you maybe I can have time got 30 minutes watch close let's go back every reader just in your mind for a minute for a mental picture every Orthodox believer here knows that the Gentile Reign began with King Nebuchadnezzar is that right every Orthodox believer knows that and King Nebuchadnezzar had a vision and Daniel gave the interpretation is that right amen it was a head of gold which is which was the Babylonian the second was the me and Persians the next was the Grecian Empire then the Roman Empire and at the end of the Roman Empire Jesus Christ was the rock that was hewed out of the mountain without hands that rolled in and broke down the images is that right covered the Earth anyone knows that any believer knows that and how that in the last days when they broke up in these many different kingdoms and so forth to the toes there was iron and clay and it means the prophet said as much as thou did see Iron and Clay won't mix together neither will these cleave one to another but they'll mingle them seeds in other words they'll marry into them trying to raise their children and break uh for the powers like that you know that's truth paragraph 163 notice when King Nebuchadnezzar in the beginning back Yonder when the Gentile age was issued in let's watch how it come in and the way it come in you'll find out it goes out the same way we know that there is a beginning of time of Grace for the Gentiles and an ending of time is that right now watch King Nebuchadnezzar Daniel sent down there a smart Prophet with all the rest of the Jews had kind of humbled down and was bowing to the Romans to the Babylonians but there was three four men three Shadrach mesach abedo and Daniel who purpos in their heart they serve God and then when they throwed Shadrach and Daniel and and Daniel had become a great man before King Nebuchadnezzar and belar and so forth when he become a great man now watch King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold and set it up in the field and said that everybody would have to bow to that image did you ever notice the innocent sense of it who that image was made of it was Daniel the image of a man and didn't he say the spirits of the Gods Heathen as they are today got three or four of them spirits of the Gods lived in him and they made an image to Daniel and he said and all that won't make all that won't make bow to that image will be throwed in the fiery furnace you notice Daniel's off the seen at that time get what I mean and every who would not bow to that image should be cut to pieces and throw it into the lion's den or burn in the fiery furnace of something of punishment that's the way the Gentile dispensation begin with the Pagan form of religious worship with the persecution to make them bow to it and the Bible predicts it'll end the same way a holy man Jesus Christ an image to him to worship it and so forth you remember Fox book of Martyrs that hold crucifix before them and put an ox on each arm like that and if you wouldn't renounce renounce protestantism and become a Catholic and kiss the crucifix they start one Ox one way and one the other way and then pull them apart they burned them to the stakes they' done everything I've been to the old catacombs I know what I'm speaking of and see that that's right and there they lay and notice how they went through the days of martyrdom before Martin Luther I want you to think about that these were our brothers and our sisters that these things happen too and if we were to if we were to switch places just for a moment and move you back a hundred years or so what kind of position would you take I mean I I know that we can't do that because we have things so easy but I do believe there is a revelation of Jesus Christ and it's a true Revelation for the day you live in that should keep you on your knees and keep the fire burning bright I mean I've never seen so many lazy Christians I've never seen so many people that want credit for coming to church it's like I made all three services and it's like and what um you needed to be at all we need to add a service and then I see the faces frown like I got a schedule I'm busy I'm doing this what if we had service every five every every five you know five nights of the week yeah don't get no amens on that cuz we busy we got things to do but guess where we going we're going to heaven we're going to a place that will never grow old our purpose in being here was to reflect the place over there not to rep reflect our own uh you know things that we have here you got so many weak Christians lazy weak can't handle a prayer meeting can't handle uh uh a uh you know the service is too long yes I didn't know I was going to go here but I'm here now come on sorry soft young men young women that you know they're tired tired from what yeah what are you doing I'm so tired I can't you know I can't barely you know I made it to church you know for three services in a row um what you want to Star you want a you want you want us to give you a prize do you want a a a trophy do we want to hand out gifts because you came to church um really I need to be in the house of the Lord or in the presence of the Lord and I know with the Leo Dean age I'm in the minority what I'm saying right now I know that because it's the spirit of leod deia but when you listen to the dream of what brother Billy Paul had and that was just a dream and the urgency of that there's going to come a time time when the door actually closes and I can see the age people out there they don't know what time it is they're looking for another great Revival to happen they don't know what's going on we know the door is closing and yet we still are like sleeping in Zion we can't break through we can't break through the the prayer meeting is too early or it's too late and you know make it more comfortable for us offer coffee give us something make it more easy for us I mean I'm sorry I'm sorry and then the poor preachers have to apologize because they preach a little too long about something that's trying to help your soul something that's trying to break your daughter your son into the baptism of the Holy Ghost something that's trying to get you ready for the Rapture and we got to apologize to the American church that can't pray for an hour can't pray for one hour God have mercy amen you know what that's on you that's on me I'm so glad you're not my example but God gave me an example God help me to follow the example you left before us am amen God help us Lord wake me up I read a quote there in Phoenix where brother R said this is the most glorious age that ever hit the earth yes and he called out the prophet he said if Daniel Moses and Elijah could come here today amen they would be running up and down the streets proclaiming the gospel and they would lock him up and put him in prison amen because they would realize the day that we're living in amen excuse me yes sir amen I want you to like me I want you to smile I want you to be happy this kind of preaching don't garnish that but it's still the truth amen Lord if I got to praise you by myself I'm not coming to church and let the song leader Teach Me How To Worship I'm not coming to church to see who else can praise you I'm coming to Worship You Lord king of kings and Lord of lords doesn't matter who's here who's not I'm here to worship you in spirit and in truth Lord help me Hallelujah help me Lord cuz everybody else leave don't mean it's time for me to leave just because they close the service don't mean the service is over God is speaking to your heart amen if it's to get right with God then you need to get right with God Amen thank excuse me Saints all right right but we know we're at the end this Gentile dispensation coming to a close the beginning and ending of the Gentile Gentile dispensation now brother brandom is now showing us that that image was the image of Daniel these prophets these Believers were forced to worship the image of Daniel I have like seven or eight quotations just on that alone well brother brandom tells us that what it was wasn't some Theory some preacher someone else brother brandham tells us that those Believers were put to the test they were squeezed to worship this image and the image of was a god a real true prophet and that reality exists and we know that there there's doctrines and there's issues that people always want to force you to do something and and I I can't even see it you know quite clear in the scripture where Jesus even does that he where he comes and he forces you to bow down and recognize who he is but it's rather a revelation of who he is and through a revelation We Worship the Lord hallelujah so in other words me reading a couple of quotes on worship and you feeling guilty and then you raise your hand that's not what we looking for that's not what it's about it's not about me guilty you into anything I'm going to make you feel guilty then you'll come to the altar no what you need is God to give you a revelation and when he gives you a revelation it don't matter who says what you'll do what he reveals to you to do that's right amen yes sir you rais your hand because of a revelation you say Amen because it comes from the inside you worship God because that's what he is to you amen praise the Lord but that image of the the last day forcing people forcing people to see this forcing people to catch this and if you don't see it you ain't bride no more you was bride when we agreed but now we disagree you ain't bride no more Oh They'll mess you up if you follow them that's right they have you all messed up I'm so glad there ain't no man can tell me whether I'm bride or not there ain't no man can tell me what I'm seeing or not there's only one and he's the eyeopener he's the light Giver he reveals himself and when he reveals himself he does a very good job yes he does of showing you what he's talking about yes he does Amen praise His name amen glory to God but we see this great Temptation that happens in the end time we've had these Temptations through the years the pressures that come around the word but we see the G how age is closing now let's go a little bit further the prophet of God says this in that same message beginning and ending of the Gentile dispensation uh paragraph 25 Elijah I mean not Elijah but Daniel fora he saw a prophet he saw the coming of the Lord he saw the end time come he saw the Gentiles start and if you notice the Gentiles started off with a idol worship they was worshiping a great Idol setting out in the field an idol of a man I believe Daniel himself cuz King Nebuchadnezzar called him basar which was his God excuse me he started worshiping the image of a righteous holy man and Daniel refused to do it so did the Hebrew children Shadrach mesach and abedo that's the way it was issued in and it was condemned the head of gold was issued in by image worship forced to it it ended up in the Supernatural handwriting of a supernatural language that only the supernatural understanding could understand it amen that's the way the Gentile Kingdom issued in and it'll go out the same way that's right by Supernatural Works Supernatural interpretation you know what I'm talking about the working of the supernatural oh how marvelous aren't you happy tonight you believe in the Supernatural yes sir now then often these Vision he showed him just where the nations would be standing he showed them how that there would so many years depend on the Jews he said that the Messiah shall come he'll Pro prophesy in the 70th week which is three and a half years in the midst of it he'll cut be cut off which is seven which is seven years 70 weeks is is determined for thy people 7 years appro approximately to the Jews and he said and Messiah the prince shall come and prophesy in the midst of the seven weeks seven days will he be cut off in the Abomination and make a desolation will stand in its place and they'll tread Down the Walls of Jerusalem Gentiles for a time time and dividing the time now when the Messiah come Jesus he preached exactly 3 and 1/2 years it was cut off for a sacrifice the daily obligation was taken away and the and desolate the Abomination that make a desolation the mosque of Omar was was stood today in the place of the Holy Temple the mosque of Omar stands exactly where the temple stood and he said that they would tread Down the Walls of Jerusalem over Jerusalem until the Gentile dispensation be finished but at the end of the Gentiles there would still be three and A2 Years yet to the Jews now notice one of the most striking things of prophetic history I don't claim to know the prophecy of the Bible but this is like reading a newspaper more plain and what we read here we know is the truth notice 2,000 years 2500 years of Jews has been scattered to every nation under heaven and as God hardened Pharaoh's heart bringing them back he hardened Hitler's heart mellen's heart and so forth till he drove them back to Palestine coming back they had made them a nation again and on May the 6 1947 the Jewish flag was raised over Israel for the first time for 2500 years isn't that nice how the Lord would Harden their heart so that they can get back where they need to go Harden not more friends less friends so that you God can perform his will in your life you said well brother I need more friends so I can be more like God no you need maybe maybe you need less friends I need to take I need a break no maybe you need some pressure you I need somebody to love me no maybe you need a rumor spread about you maybe you need something to tie you up to where you can't go nowhere but your knees because when it's too easy we don't pray we don't pray when the checks are cleared and money's in the account we don't pray when all the vehicles are working properly we don't pray like we should when everybody loves us but when those things break down and the Lord allows the breakdown and this is the time that we are living in I want you to think of this Saints we'll never get 2023 back again it's only 2024 and you'll never get the back years back again but you have today now is the time and there's be a great deception to come that all would be deceived and if it wasn't for the very elect if you wasn't elected you would be deceived that's a tremendous deception but God is the one that allows it and so this this kind of moves us into let me move a little bit further so brother random continues on he's talking about how their hearts were hardened these people's hearts were hardened and then paragraph 30 says the Fig Tree putting forth his Bud Not only that but the other trees are putting forth its Bud the Communist is putting forth buds the Antichrist is putting forth Buds and the Church of God is putting forth buds she's blooming out into her power again the Palmer worm eat part of it the cankerworm eat part of it the hookworm eat part of it the caterpillar eat part of it God said it'll live again amen she's putting forth buds now the trees are putting forth buds Daniel foresaw it and rejo now are you putting forth buds amen are you is God doing something in your life is God working the works of his word in your life for today you know this message should mean more to us today than it ever has amen we're in the greatest deception that there ever was we're living in it that's right right now we see iten happening we see the images of false worship and people are calling whatever they want to call they're doing anything they want to do in the name of the Lord you know uh Satan brother Brandon makes a statement Satan can't impersonate any gift that's right I was raised in a Pentecostal church I never could understand that I couldn't understand that I thought that if a man would be gifted and maybe prophesy and it come to pass that that would have to be God and so therefore everything they're saying is true but there's a tremendous message brother Brandon brings anointed ones at the end time and he opens up and shows us some of these things that we want to get into here this morning how you know here is Moses now following the leading of the Lord something he had never experienced in his life to go down and let my people go I can't talk Lord we said we're going to fix that Aaron will be the prophet you will be like God now go let my people go you don't have no Spears you don't have no army army you know all their secrets and you know that's a tremendous Nation this is not Pharaoh's not to Fly by Night go and let him go so gets the courage after coming into the pillar of fire and he's one man Invasion I wonder he never did this before I wonder if you put yourself in his shoes I mean the courage of Moses to get an audience with pharaoh and look at it says God said let my people go what what are you talking about man this is our whole economical base it's based on the slaves and you going to be one pretty quick you don't get out of my office let God's people go who's God who's his people I'm Pharaoh all right you don't want to let him go we got a sign for you oh a sign let's see stick on the ground he puts a stick on the ground and his Rod turns into a serpent a miracle wow it didn't move Pharaoh one bit Pharaoh called Janice and jamas that's right and when he calls Janice and jam they do the same thing now this wasn't you know got to face the fact that the signs wonders and miracles exist outside of the message did you know that all right y'all need to travel a little bit you think all the blessings is here you going to a Pentecostal church I'm not saying going to one but as an example if you happen to go into one and you start hearing them people praise the Lord and worship there's an anointing that comes down there's a blessing that comes down it actually feels good and many times they know how to do it better y'all want to finish it for me better than some of us I say it like that many times and you don't know that if you haven't experienced it I come out of it these people fast and pray and there's an anointing that comes and God actually honors their faith I've seen them get healed I've heard of testimonies of them being delivered off of drugs and God blessing them and God anointing them and it'll blow your mind if you don't understand that God allows it am here is a tremendous Miracle taking place I'm going wind down just now here's a tremendous Miracle taking place and you would think like well if God sent me me and if God sent the message all of the people that are out there coming against it that they would just explode that Holy Fire would just burn them up you know you go online and you try to witness to someone about William brandham you got to be careful now because the first heading up there is false preacher false prophets yeah lying on the prophet I mean straight up lies too amen I was listening to One of brother Billy Paul's testimony I think it was in ' 86 or ' 87 he was telling of a testimony of this gentleman that had took for his thesis on who William brandham was he says in his class there back East I forget what school brother Billy gives a testimony and he says that the professor gets up and says that William brandham was shot and killed in the platform because he prophesied a false vision that's an egregious lie we know that but this guy sitting in the classroom he said he didn't know but he he rose up he said that's a lie and so he told the professor that he would do his thesis on that but you you think of an egregious lie like that you say well somebody that would tell a lie like that God would just put him to the stop but God allows it and there's a reason why he allows it and brother vom deals with it in the anointed ones at the end time and when you get this Revelation then you let everybody do whatever they doing because you can't make a circle into a square you can't make a square into a triangle he's either a Believer or he's not a Believer and it's not about explaining the word of God to them you either see it or you don't see it and if it wasn't for the election we would all be de seed can you put that together if God didn't elect you you would be lost this morning you would be deceived Jesus said so it would be so great the deception Glory that if it wasn't for election we'd all be deceived but I'm so glad he knew me he saw me and he put my name in the book of life so let's deal with this just for a moment in the anointed ones at the end time notice paragraph 148 they did the same Miracles but they notice they didn't do it till after the original word went forth that's the way Satan done in the Garden of Eden that's the way he done all the time who prophesied first Moses who come on the scene first Moses or balum Moses who come on the scene first Jeremiah or haniah you see what I mean notice they copied carnal impersonators sincere thinking they were doing God a service as David did last week but carnal impersonation I'm just waiting a minute I want you to think about those place these places if you don't say it surely the holy spirit will reveal it especially to the elected see Pharaoh's denomination we have man that can do the same thing and they did it see why did Pharaoh do this why did God permit it why would God send a true anointed Prophet down there to perform a sign before Pharaoh then let a denominational copy come around and copy it before the people good question right why would he let an imp an impersonator rise up to do it and do the same thing exactly the genuine spirit of God done see the scripture must be fulfilled exactly notice he did this so that he would Harden the heart of pharaoh and the Egyptians to prove that Moses wasn't the only one that had the word oh my that's tremendous to me so he allows them to display this gift to come under the anointing allow them to succeed in their lie telling allow them to lie online in the name of the Prophet allow them to retell the story of brother bradam story and they're succeeding and we try to hide it but God allows it why so that they're Hearts will get hard and they'll have a valid reason to disbelieve it but to us all right good to us it causes us to believe more actually why did God let this thing happen in the last days the so the same thing as a lying spirit said to zedekiah how are we going to get Ahab out there to make these things come to pass you know just you getting ready isn't all of it in the coming of the Lord there's the iniquity of the amorites that cup has to be filled the iniquity and the sin has to get to the place where judgment can be poured out they work both together let's take a scripture here and we will close after this first Kings chapter 22 all right First Kings 22 verse 18 oh what a mighty God we serve and the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat did not I tell thee that that he would prophesy no good concerning me but evil amen and he says Hear thou therefore the word of the Lord I Saw the Lord sitting on his throne and all of the hosts of Heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left and the Lord said this is what the Lord is asking who shall persuade Ahab that they may that that he may go up and fall at Routh Gilead and one said this manner another said of that matter and there came forth a spirit and stood before the Lord and said I will persuade him and the Lord said unto him wherewith and he said I will go forth and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all of his prophets and he says Thou shalt persuade him and Prevail also go forth and do so so the Lord gives the permission for the lie to continue and then a church will split because of it and we all heartbroken a fake friend finally leaves you and you all heartbroken a false a false Ministry you thought it was true finally exposed and you all heartbreaking I'm so sad who allowed it we we might have to dance by ourself it might not be a full church when we get the victory you might have to dance but I I want the victory I don't care who's with me I want the Victory and everybody that's supposed to be here will be here that's right at the word amen it's a beautiful thought it's a powerful thought it's a sobering thought that God allows the Janice and the jambers he allows the lying Spirit he allows the false prophets he allows the false doctrines to permeate through to test the True Believer but I'm so glad there's a Shadrack there's a meak and there's an abendigo somewhere there somewhere they might be in this assembly they might be in another assembly they might be in South Asia somewhere but there's a shatra somewhere somewhere amen that got his Revelation together amen and no matter what everybody else is doing no matter what the crowd is trying to pressure us into I'm going to stay with the word of the Lord hallelujah then they threaten you go go ahead kick I've been kicked before give me what you going to take my life that's the worst thing you can do is take our life and then what street of Glory Just Dance all right all right all right don't come crying at my funeral don't cry at my funeral dance cuz that's what I'll be doing dancing in glory thanking God that I finally got up out of this no good nasty [Music] age amen hallu so is it sad yes it's sad but who allowed it who allows the Janice and the jambus who allows the lies to continue who is the one who allows the pressure to squeeze and remember only the elected will be saved let's take one scripture in Matthew 24 before we go Matthew chapter 24 verse number four now as I said this has to be your Bible right amen it's not like our Bible come on let's all hold hands and say Amen together no that's something we talking about that's what Choirs do but Believers have their own Revelation amen amen I'll say Amen with you amen but if I have to say it by myself guess what you will too right Matthew 24 verse number four and Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many and shall hear and you shall hear of Wars rumors of wars see that you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for Nations shall rise against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilence and earthquake in diverse places all these are the beginning of Sorrows then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall do what betray one another you can't betray him if we wasn't friends shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall rise and shall do what how many many and because of iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that endureth he that can make the Wednesday night prayer meeting can I add that in there he that can make all services during the week come on now help me now said Brothers I'll make all the services okay we going to
