========================================

[Music] foreign prayer and go into our adult Sunday School the message God hiding in self and simplicity and brother Branham will be uh taking from paragraph 186 to 251. two places in the scriptures he reads in Matthew and then also on Isaiah we're going to read in Matthew chapter 11. and let's bow our heads forward of Prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for bringing us together once again Lord we thank you for the opportunity to come into your presence speak to our heart through your word Lord bless this service and the following services to come today Lord we just committed all into your hands speak to our hearts we pray we love you we thank you in Jesus name amen Matthew chapter 11 and verse 25 at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and The Prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so far there for so it seemed good in thy sight amen and God hiding himself in Simplicity and then revealing himself in that same Simplicity amen let's sing only believe [Music] only believe [Music] all things are possible only believe foreign [Music] [Music] Lord I believe [Music] Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe Lord I believe [Music] Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe I bless you you may be seated brother Branham and they said that Moses never cross actually the Red Sea that it was a a bunch of reeds down there a sea of reeds and he brought the children of Israel through this sea of reeds up at the end of the the sea there's a big bunch of reeds up there and Moses crossed the sea but it was the Sea of reeds that he crossed you know grass tall like thuleles and things that he crossed through that Howry thickness when the water the Bible says departed from right so they think God calls a mighty East Wind to separate [Music] they want to try to figure it out in their own way and that's why they've always failed and they'll continue to fail you know all these things that came or the very type of the carnal-minded man today who's religious uh outwardly he wants to do something outwardly but he's uh he goes to church and and you'll do lots of things for the the building there's only one church and you don't join that these are lodges see you joined the Methodist Lodge the Baptist Lodge the Presbyterian Lodge the Pentecostal Lodge but you're born into the church these all are lodges they're not churches they're lodges no such a thing as Methodist Church our Pentecostal Church no there isn't such a thing no that's all wrong see there that's right there are lodges that people join but you're born into the Church of the Living God and that's the Mystic body of Jesus Christ amen the form now but it pleased God to reveal his secret to Abel by simple faith in the shed blood oh I wish I had time to lay on that alone see yet it came with all this wisdom the smart man oh you say now brother Branham you said you're trying to make him the educated genius he was he was a smart followers Far East strain look at his children every one of them were scientists and doctors and smart man everyone but you follow the generation of saith they were humble peasants and farmers and so forth on down to the destruction but Kane's children were the smart intellectual group they even uh they could claim to temper copper and they make Medals and Builders and they were smart man when when these other menus go out intense and hurt their sheep and rested upon the promises of God Amen see where it was now just follow the genologist they rested upon the promise of God that's how Noah was chosen that kind of a people that's how uh Paul was taken out from his flock see that's how John Wesley Martin Luther what more that's how you come to be what you are today the same thing humble to believe the simple promise of God now notice it pleased God to to identify now God always will a vindicate whether it's the truth or not now many people try to ask themselves into something that God Saves a million miles from that's right but when you see God come back around say it's punctuated says right that's right that's right then you know that's true now when the offerings is on the altar God refused his intellectual conception of God but when he's seen Abel by simple Faith to believe that it was not apples or fruits of the field but it was blood by faith he believed it by Revelation from God God of indicated Adam by accepting his sacrifice that's where we think of praying for the sick anything else Jesus said if you abide in me in my word and you just ask what you will that shall be done to you now as we're coming right on down fastly now for 20 minutes more notice Elijah's day God chose to hide himself in a simple person now just think of it God chose that was his choosing remember they had rabbis priests they had great man in them days even King Ahab himself was a Jew he had great man in the land in that day but God hid himself in a simple man not a scholar no not only noun man of the world some great military genius or something no no big name we don't even know who he's popping mama was we don't know anything about his genealogy just a plain old farmer somewhere that was raised up for the purpose to be a prophet God had him living to himself in the wilderness only thing we know he stomped right out of nowhere walked right in and condemned the whole ecclesiastical system my and you know what they thought about him what school did he come from what denomination is he with is he with the Pharisees the Sadducees or what more they had he didn't belong to any of them but he condemned the whole thing God chose to do that but a simple man no education we had no place where he ever went to school we had nothing about him just a simple man but God was pleased to hide in that simple person God back there with this simple man hiding in a human being can you grasp it God hiding in a illiterate crank to the world because you know they they accused him of everything even being a witch Elijah all prophets are accused that so Jesus excuse me be Elizabeth be crazy said well you're mad we know you got a devil you're off at your head see that's where he told him when it come to the last days that the bless that'd be blasphy to do such he forgave him but it wouldn't be forgiven in these last days it had to be faithful with eternal separation never to be forgiven in this world of the world to come but Elijah was considered a crazy man could you imagine standing up to the the women was all cutting your hair like the modern days I guess and painting up like Jezebel the first lady of the land and and the preachers all gone worldly and everything and then what taking place then here come the old Elijah condemning the whole thing all the way from Jezebel down I thought that we don't have to listen to you but we can sure they didn't ask you but he wasn't a pastor anyhow and Jezebel's Pastor she didn't she might have had a different kind but but God said he was God sent Pastor for her she hated him but he was pastured just the same notice and Elijah humbled himself and stayed with what God Said in such a way that it pleased God to take that same Spirit from Elijah and promise to shove it three times down the road from that man he promised it that it would come and to come up on Elisha his successor that come on John the Baptist according to Malachi 4 Sports to be here again in the last days God loved that spirit that was up on that simple uneducated Woodsman from back there in the woods somewhere and so it was so obedient to his word that he could say Elijah do this and Elijah would do it and God hid himself in their sub-simplicity they all told him that old crank don't have nothing to do with him and so forth but one day when he got old and his head Paul in his in his Whiskers hanging down grave what few heirs he had hanging over his shoulders little skinny arms and the meat flopping on him like that come walking down that road to Samaria in my eyes look it up towards the skies with a crooked stick in his hand he wasn't very much to look at but he had thus saith the Lord [Music] he didn't stand her with it were you stutter he didn't say now great Ahab he woke up said not even the Dew will fall from Heaven till I call for you all right God had honored his Simplicity and I see while it was in the simple way and everybody made everybody against him everybody was at his throat all the Ministerial Association everything else was at his stroke that's true trying to get rid of him and everything else but in that Simplicity even though they had no cooperation with these campaigns and whatever more he had everybody thought he was a crank God was hiding himself but when it comes time for that seed to get right that had been planted God manifested himself by sending fire out of heaven Lord God hiding in Simplicity himself again sure it pleased God to do that he's always hidden in such a way that's syrup now we find out that he he promised these things yes uh the trouble is today was so many of us people we want to get so uh you know so Seminary and denominational educated mind is that God can't use it God can give a man a start to do something and uh give him a Ministry the first thing you know you'll go to catering to what others say and the first thing you know you'll be all wrapped up in a big bunch of stuff and then God just takes his hands off of him let him alone see Nanny will try to find him another man somebody that will do it see he's got to find something else we'll we'll take his word we'll take the divine revelation and won't move with it but stay right there on that word that's what he he does it he's always done it that way so when man gets so educated and smart that he tries to put his own interpretation well like to say uh the baptism of the Holy Ghost they'll say oh that was for another day but if they don't well it wasn't for another day but I'll tell you it don't come just like it did on the day of Pentecost we receive the Holy Ghost when we believe in and all kinds of stuff like that you see and talk about the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ they where the Bible teaches that we will say well but the Seminary says and so and so says that's compromising he may let a man be beat all across the country like that and the Man cast out and laughed at and made fun of and everything else like that but when the real Showdown come God stands up and vindicates himself [Music] why is that affect the flower the seed looks like it's over with it dies and falls into the ground dig the little seed up button it looks like a mess but out of their Springs life to reproduce another Power again God is Simplicity he does the same thing the Way Up Is Down always humble yourselves don't never say well I got this and that you ain't got nothing just remember if you got the grace of God just be thankful for it is keep humble yourself now I'll move after her because the clocks I don't want to keep you too long cause don't wear you out see we got a long time here through this week now and now we find out that people get so smart and educated now I want to show you another the others go so far to the other side they become Fanatics trying to be religious now we know we have that group amen they go up the other side that's where I differ with a group of Brethren that pulled off here not long ago from the The Way of Light they they just couldn't see the phenomena being done unless they made themselves a group so they gathered up in Canada and made a group of people that they was going to give out make Apostles and Prophets out of one another and things then it fell right through see and it always will yeah they come they feel that the cause that they are that they don't they so condemn the other things and and the things do they go Plum on the other side see this one side this highly intellectual cold and in different they deny everything there and the others get on the other side on the other side of the radical bunch of an emotion and deny the word but the real true church stays right in the middle of the road now if you notice it's it's it's got the Bible knowledge of what God Said and it's it's spiritual enough to be warm in its heart and it's just the road Isaiah said it would be that way he said there shall be a highway and a blessed holy precious Friends of the nazarene's church a mighty little move that God started up but what did they get when God began to speak with tongues in the church they were so religiously and so self-starch that they call it the devil and you see what happened to him amen and um and so we find out that all those things goes to seed and dies right out Amen to the other side now one side becomes a fanatic the other side becomes cold and starchy now Isaiah said there shall be a highway and the nazarenes and many of the old Holiness people you say the Blessed Old Highway glory to God we're walking up the old highway but you remember that wasn't exactly what he said he said there shall be a highway and and is a conjunction and a way and it shall not be called The Highway of Holiness but the way of holy now on the highway of holies people try to make themselves holy and when you do it's just like I've said before it's like a it would be like a buzzer trying to put Dove feathers in himself to make a dove out of it when his nature is still a buzzard it'd be like a cruel trying to put a a pigeon's feathers in or a peacock and saying you see I'm a beautiful bird see it's something manufactured but a peacock don't have to worry whether he's going to have peacock feathers or not the dog don't have to worry whether he's going to have Dove feathers or not as long as his nature is a dove he'll have Dove feathers and see the Holiness people and again they'll say the women must wear long hair and long sleeves and and all these things and long skirts and not wear any wedding rings or jewelry of anything I see it become a self-righteous Holiness see see that that's that's manufactured holiness but the real Church of the Living God is look what's happened to the denomination now they've all got cut hair like the Pentecostals and and so forth and and they all really wear rings and so forth look at the Pentecostals years ago how they harped on that see and we the church we the church the church is Christ's body it's an individual amongst other individuals that is born in the kingdom of God that comes from the inside out it's automatically lived you don't ask the Sheep to Bear wool or a manufacture wool I mean a sheep don't have to manufacture wool you say now my master wants me to have some more this year I got to get busy and all the only thing he has to do is just remain a sheep that's right the war will actual article it will um it will he will bear it because and we're not asked to manufacture fruits we're supposed to produce fruits their fruits see we are supposed to bear fruit and as long as you are a fruit tree of God with God's word God's word will vindicate itself it'll bear fruit as long as the words in there Jesus said if ye abide me in my word in you that's what you will and it shall be done amen you don't manufacture to work yourself not up to it's just actually there and it goes on and on now let's go just hurrying up now with just a few minutes left and then we'll close down now others go so far as to be fanatics now they go on the other side and they think it's because if they jump up and down or get some kind of a sensation or emotion speak with tongues or or or give a prophecy that happened to be right or something like that they think that's it they got it but it isn't Jesus said many will come to me in that day and say Lord have not I prophesied your name your name done many works the cast out Devils he said depart I never knew you see that isn't it that isn't it friend that's the reason that tongues evidence I'm not even speaking in tongues but I don't think it'd be the only evidence of the Holy Spirit no sir the fruit of the spirit amen and now you see that's the reason I have different with the move of the Pentecostal brethren in that manner that they say is of a man speaks as long as he has the Holy Ghost how different that's no sign he's got the Holy Ghost I've heard they will speak with him just as fast they could drink blood out of a human skull and call on the devil I see Indians take snakes wrap around them and the rain dance out there in Arizona hold their hands up I can't run right around the witch doctor come out laying sitting myself and flee a pencil down right now no one comes and give the interpretation see so don't don't tell me that happens I'm too old for that see so the the fruit of the spirit is if Jesus said buy their fruits not tongues or emotions but buy their fruits well that is the fruit of the spirit it's God unfolding himself in humility sweetness and every day the same it's something about it a man that stays right with the word every time that he sees the word he punctuates you with an amen no matter what the other people say that he believes it's just a man all right see but we go far enough then to rest upon a fanatical and Satan gets amongst the people that's Satan's business and he's a good businessman and he gets amongst people make them think that they got it it's because they can jump up and down and then hate your neighbor no see yeah the same things and speak in tongues just wonderfully and things like that and remember you can speak in genuine Holy Ghost tongues and still not have the Holy Ghost the Bible says so the law speak with tongue of man and Angel and have not shared yet Prophet me nothing I'm become as a sound embracement amen First Corinthians 13. so you don't that don't do it see the Methodist said when we shouted we had it but they didn't and as we said when they lived holy they had it but they didn't the Pentecost is that we speak in tongues we got it but they didn't see God unfolding himself not the sensations no Sensations yets with it you see the place it just gets us so humble to anybody can see it if you if you don't try to inject your own mind to it see your own thoughts it's God now and then they become a bunch of Fanatics then here's the cold formals on this side here's the Fanatics on the other side and your goals the bride right straight through it all right God vindicating it as he goes along his word [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music]

services from the special meetings up in Mesa and a chance after the fact to also listen to last Sunday's service that brother Israel brought but you know there was absolutely nothing we could do when we were listening to those that could change the atmosphere the outcome of those services so it was nice to be able to have and to get caught up on what what you guys had heard but we could we could shout all we want it wouldn't have made any difference may have helped our spirit but didn't affect your service and we have the opportunity now yes take advantage of the time that the Lord's given us today and everyone that's here is playing a part you won't leave here like you came so you leave it leave closer to him or further away and I don't think any of us want to leave further away from God than we are right now but let's not waste our time let's not play church today come with an expectation and just looking around on Wednesday night it was so good to be in the house of the Lord and you know just the end of the service thinking about some of those that paid the greatest sacrifice got the biggest blessing and will and Lindsay and they travel a long way to come here on Wednesday night

each of you we'd like to welcome any visitors we have and each of you that are gathered here in his name I'm going to ask you to stand further to honor God's word as we read in the scripture at one place in the scripture we'll take in first Thessalonians before we go to Thessalonians we'll take a psalm 27 you'll read that together as a class thank you for those songs of Zion this this morning song specials it's always so good to hear that Psalms 27. I'll read the first verse and the class will alternate with me the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid are you the whole shouldn't Camp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will I be confident for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in this Pavilion and the secret of his Tabernacle surely hide me he shall set me up upon a rock of my enemies to the Lord hear O Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me amen amen High not thou face far from me put not thy servant away in Anger thou has been my help leave me not neither forsake me o God of my salvation teach me thy way O Lord lead me in a plane path because of my enemies I would have fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living wait on the Lord we have good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord how many is willing to wait on the Lord if you wait on him he'll strengthen your heart amen first in second Thessalonians we'd like to take a scripture here first Thessalonians chapter four pardon me verses number 13. he said but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the Shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words how many find comfort in these words amen is certainly greed each of you will greet the Saints there in Phoenix the little group there that's gathered God bless the Ember the art and the Saints there and each of you a man a little message here this morning faith for the rapture the title of the message this morning faith for the Rapture God bless you can be seated this great word the Rapture or the catching away as your Bible doesn't have at least the King James version doesn't have the word rapture in it but we use that word because it expresses uh what the great catching away is and so we know that with anything you have to have a motive and an objective and a motive is the reason why something is doing what is doing the objective is the object that it is moving towards and so as brother Branham tells us when you have a question about things you always want to look at your motives and your objectives amen and so God has a motive and an objective and so does Satan and the whole purpose of us being here is uh to play out the motive in the objective that God has for us amen and we've been talking a bit on this third pool last Sunday we brought in this little widow woman that gave a few pennies in the offering it looked real simple it was very simple it's probably something she did before and sometimes we're looking for God to speak to us in some way that's an angel coming down or the lights flashing but God hides in Simplicity he hides in the shadows he hides behind the scene to get his message across he's a very um it's very interesting the more you know about him the more you realize you don't know and you just want to know more about him he's very secretive but yet he's very open he's the greatest King greatest leader but he knows how to follow too when he came in flesh he submitted and humbled himself and this is part of the greatness he being so great and so pure and so holy can actually humble himself and be robed in a sinful nasty sticky flesh with all the filthy desires that come with that he humbled himself to come to the Cross that's what makes him so great you know when God gives you something it's one of two things can happen as God blesses you that blessing can turn into a curse if you allow Pride to lift you up but then it also sets you up to really be elevated and exalted in God if you take that same blessing and learn how to humble yourself learn how to stay small and little and humility is not you know what others would say or do or Pride it's really how you view yourself pride is when youth have an unhealthy thought of who you are and how important you are and you know you can be a great man you can have all the gifts and talents but you carry yourself like you know you're just nobody you're in the background you don't have to be heard you know that's powerful that's powerful and the more you do that God will give you more but by the same token you can be gifted and talented and all those things and allow that to get to your head and then you'll get puffed up and then there's the problem it's interesting how in the scriptures a bishop or Pastor is not to be a novice and there's a reason why in Titus it says that the bishop shouldn't be a novice or a newcomer why because a novice or a newcomer comes in he'll get left it in Pride with the things that's being shown to him now it's a good thing for him to come in it's a good thing to desire a work of the Lord but then if it comes to you too quickly and you can't handle it then Pride sets in and then that Pride now and it's true you might be the fastest you might can jump the highest you might can quote the you know the best memory you might all that might be true but you see the way you're viewing yourself is going to be your destruction the Bible tells us Pride goes before what we see the fall but what happened before the fall there is some pride God in there there's some haughtiness some upliftedness you don't want to ever you don't want that Spirit on you because that's the spirit of the enemy he'll get up on you and start to move you into a direction that God does not want you to go and you know God wants to bless us but those blessings can turn a curse if we're not careful but we took this little widow woman The Widow's might she just gave a few pennies in the offering and God the Lord Jesus pointed it out to his disciples that she gave more than all of those that gave even though the amount she gave may not have been the direct amount that the others gave and you know this uh it's it's not the amount you give it's it's the amount that you're not giving it's are you giving your all are you giving your best are you really giving till it's a sacrifice and brother Banner brings this out and this little woman that this little woman uh sister Hattie Wright we spoke of her and those of us in the message are well acquainted with her story she was a poor woman I'm not going to re-preach that message but she was a poor woman and here she is now you know something happened in her life she becomes a widow her husband was killed in a terrible accident her oldest boy finds his dad crushed in this accident it creates a break right at that teenage time of his life and that creates the background for the scene of why God chose sister Hattie to express this great thing and so it's it's always on purpose whatever God is doing he doesn't accidentally do stuff like us he doesn't get caught slipping you didn't catch him off guard everything that happens before it ever happened he already knew exactly all of the details he knew all about it hard for our mind to comprehend that but that is true that's the god that we serve and so when we look at a testimony it helps us helps us when we can look backward and see we see the grand you know she said that's nothing but the truth she had a great desire and then God honored that by giving her the salvation of her two boys but look how simple and humble it was the background of it that led up to that now brother Branham brings a message Christ is the mystery of God revealed in 1963 and as we've been bringing you some of these thoughts on the third pull I want to read just one part again for you out of the message Look Away to Jesus paragraph 43. and I'll get into it I trust I know there's some of you Saints here or some of you visitors here may not understand everything but we'll there's something on the table for you today all right you will all get a bite to eat okay I trust I trust the Lord will bless you program 43 he says this it says it's so sacred that I mustn't say much about it as he told me in the beginning said this say nothing of it you remember that years ago it speaks for itself but I've tried to explain the others I made a mistake this will be the thing that to my opinion I don't say that the Lord tells me this this will be the thing that will start the rapturing faith for the going away interesting how he brings in this third pool will be the thing that will start this second Thessalonians event to take place now we know the Rapture the catchy in a way is ahead of us that's what's ahead of us so that is a single event that happens multiple times before the actual happening takes place so a Rapture or the catching away or being caught away that will continue to happen to a Believer as you go into God's word when you read his word he raptures he opens up more he catches you away into another level than what you were before thank the Lord for it I'm not the man I was 20 years ago 30 years ago I had a little faith a little knowledge but the Lord keeps pouring out more and so that moves us up into these cycles of God developing our faith because our faith is the most important thing that you got it ain't your knowledge it's not your head knowledge but faith is the most valuable thing you if Satan can destroy your faith then you can't even please God you cut off all the channels to God you can't even get right with God you can't even make an approach to God when he when he crushes your face when he when he when he ruins that that possibility that God can move or do something in your life then he's got you so we know that faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen so the Rapture is event to come it's an event to come we know that tomorrow is Monday right that's an event to come that's a day to come that's in the future for us we still have to live out Sunday and um um we don't want to get ahead of ourselves we have to plan for it for Monday but we still have to live out today and the Rapture is an event to come you know what's interesting about the Rapture is the pre-rapture and the post-raptor we're in the pre-rapture we're just before the church is caught away and there's things that's going to take place after the Rapture that the world will know nothing about it they won't understand that there's a group that was taken out of the earth it happened in the days of Noah it happened in many ages even when John the Baptist the Jews who were looking for Elijah missed him and when Elijah came and was manifested and gone they still was asking I thought the Scribe said Elijah was supposed to come well they missed him isn't that interesting and take a a quote here in the message scriptural signs of the time 1964. this is a sobering thought the brother random says this here now one of these days that little minority is paragraph 12. as it was in the days of knowing wherein eight Souls was saved by water so shall it be in the coming of the son of man in the days of lot wearing three Souls were saved from fire so shall it be at the coming of the son of man they're looking for a great big Universal something when it's not even in the scripture see one of these days they'll say well I thought the Bible said that the church will escape all of this the bride escapes this and just think after Noah as it was in the days of Noah Noah went into the ark and the door was closed he went on went in on May the 17th the door was closed and never rained for seven days after he was in the ark and they didn't know it God closed the door and one day the door of Mercy will be closed and people will go right on thinking they're getting saved and preaching and so forth and mercy has done been spurned this last time and know it not until it's missing remember there is hundreds of people missing every day that we cannot find or give an account for them world over there will be one in the field I'll take one two in the bed I'll take one universal so it won't take very many to make that escape the raptured bride remember these signs but the random continues in the message who do you say this is 1964 paragraph 114. do you realize the day that we could be in see it could be that they never get it do you know Jesus said when the sleeping virgin now remember the sleeping version come to call for oil it was all sealed out she didn't get it she never got it do you realize that after the bride is done gone Rapture to Heaven churches will still go on people think they're getting saved and everything just like they always did continue just like it was in the days of Noah they went right ahead eating drinking everything just like they always did they didn't know it but the door was closed and it could be friends that the door could close at any time maybe already for all I know we don't know there's just going to be a few of them go in we know that as it was in the days of Noah eight Souls were saved so shall it be at the coming of the son of man so there's just be a few Souls safe so this is striking reality isn't that to think that the door will be closed and churches the people the politics the work schedules careers daily life will continue on the Bible was very clear in Genesis I believe it's six it says until the day that Noah went into the ark they ate they drank what what do we expect like a perfect heads up day that the Lord is coming let's say on a Sunday morning some Sunday morning and all my bills will be paid my garage will be straightened out all of the junk in these files and folders I'll get all those things but and up like I've always said I would do and everything will be tidy and then I'll sit back in my chair and be like Lord okay today is a perfect day for you to come that's how it's going to happen he's going to come in a day while people are doing whatever they're doing right now some will be late to church and it won't be a matter it won't even matter because the door is closed some decide well I'm not going to go this morning well don't go because it's too late anyways but this is reality this is how it's going to look after this great event the rapture now brother Banner makes it very clear that he believed that this third pool had something to do with the Rapture the rapturing faith that's required so there's an object that God has he has a motive and objective and that is based your motives and your objectives are surrounded around what your desires are and when the the opportunity came to Sister Hattie what is your greatest desire what's your greatest desire and she said what do you mean like what do I need this week what I need in the fridge what I need in the account no we want to supersede art what is your greatest what narrow it down real quick take inventory what is your greatest desire what do you really want what's motivating you what is your why your purpose what is your really your greatest desire I can tell you this if your greatest then that's something worth striving for you know God has a great motive a great desire and he tells us this in Christ is the mystery of God revealed the prophet of God tells us that God had a threefold purpose that God wanted to reveal himself to the people he wanted to have preeminence in his people the bride and he wanted to restore the kingdom to his right position so we're all men here men and women I'm certainly some people maybe try to identify as an animal or something but we're all men and women here will be very clear and so let's go back to the first man just for a moment take your Bible with me and turn in Genesis you know this man Adam the first man on the earth very interesting a gentleman he didn't say the Bible doesn't record many words that he spoke and but God could see the need in his life he was lonely and before the loneliness came uh he God gave him verse this is Genesis chapter two excuse me in verse number 18. this is the Lord in his great creation bringing man about and the Lord God said it is not good that man should be alone I will make him a help me for him and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name there uh smart guy this is a smart man yeah yeah this is an intelligent man I can hardly name a few animals and creatures and Adam gives name to all of the living creatures he's the first man Adam he's the first uh human being he's made in the image and the likeness of God as a spirit then he was made flesh we don't really know what Adam lost because we can see in the fall he loses everything before we can actually hear him talk more but when Jesus come Jesus showed us what kind of man Adam was because Jesus was the second Adam and what Jesus did showed us what Adam had the ability to do and the prophet of the age is not written in the in the Bible like that but in the prophet of the age shows us The Authority that Adam had now all the creation comes to him he had the intelligence to give them a name and a name denotes that there's some order there any names and classifies them the little creatures the big creatures the bugs the birds all of the living beings were named by Adam so when the second Adam come Jesus he now takes control over the elements he has the power to stop a storm he has the power to tell a fig tree no man eat from you and the next day it's gone but in the Old Testament he could take a branch from a from an almond tree and in 24 hours in it increases life that it bugs Blossom and blooms the same God of creation can bring it he can take it away he's got full power and this is what Adam lost so as a man this is what our desires are is to go back to what Adam lost in the first seal second seals brother Branham and the breach also message he brings in what this book of redemption was what Adam had in the garden he had the ability over the fishes and the fowls of the air he had the ability to move nature he had the ability to move the mountains and the trees and plant in the garden the way he wanted it he used the power he used the power that God had given him in that one in that nice think of it this is why Jesus can say if you say to this mountain be thou moved he's not talking to an Angelic being he's talking to a man he's seen men do it before Adam was the first man he had this power he had this ability and so these are the great objectives that God had from the beginning let me read a few quotations for you from the message in the message the Rapture paragraph number 65 the prophet of God says this here before we read that let's take Matthew 24 just briefly what are we talking about faith for the rapture we've got to have faith for that Rapture that is an age requirement all right how many Saints are here this morning this should be your objective all right we want to refocus your glasses this morning pick up those spiritual glasses and you start looking through those and that should be your object your objection Matthew 24 37 but as the days of Noah were 24 37 so shall it also at the coming of the son of man be for in the as in the days that were before the flood they were eating drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the yard and Noah knew not until the flood came and took them all away so show also the coming of the son of man be then shall two be in the field the one shall be taken the other one left two women shall be grinding at the mail the one shall be taken the other left watch therefore for you know not what our your lord doth come now in Christ is the mystery of God revealed the very last right at the end of the message paragraph 6 37. Prophet God says this year and remember this is the three and a half three hour plus sermon three and a half hours three hours 20 minutes whatever it was how many minutes was that message somebody tell me please Christ The Mystery of God revealed 359. thank you three almost four hours we would say it was over four hours how we like to exaggerate who's in there for over four hours he preached for four hours and we don't know what they did at the pre-service we don't know if there were any song specials and these are the these are the Saints that we say you know they don't really know who the prophet was because we have all the tapes now we really know who he is they can sit and say Amen throughout the listen to the tape they're saying amen all hour one hour two hour three hour four days still saying Amy he's getting ready to close they said no no no keep going what kind of church was he preaching in we supposed to be more anointed more revelated got more time servers we got everything taken care of and we can't after 45 minutes y'all start I feel it you start tightening up there's some people here back in the early 60s for our sermon still saying amen and there he is now at the end of the sermon he was trying to close he kept saying I'll cut this out I'll bring this in and then right at paragraph 637 look what God does not knowing of course being spiritual you watch spiritual things not knowing this God Knows It But if you'll turn and look at the clock it's on the dot two o'clock the end of the second pool the third pool is at hand nobody's bringing this to the people and so he makes this statement and then he starts to sing the song that they were singing Take the name of Jesus and the song takes an octave higher ah how do you remember that go hear it again all right get to the message there don't fast forward it listen to the whole thing but I fast forward to it it's like I fast forward through my Bible so but paragraph 637 and he's bringing in you who are spiritual you watch spiritual things he didn't time this he didn't he wasn't trying to manipulate this this is two o'clock you've been preaching for three hours what time did the service start okay it is on the dot two o'clock the second pool is over the third pool is at hand this is what's to look for now so we see this great three third pool is a very important subject to the believer it's a it's a age requirement to have faith for the Rapture let's go back to a couple other ages just for a moment and those other ages let's take like I said Adam we don't hear very many words out of Adam oh I'll see him again I believe the Jehovah Witnesses don't believe Adam is saved he's lost can never be redeemed because of the sin that he committed but the Bible says that Adam knew that he was doing and he did that in order to redeem his right Eve showing in the great uh pre-figure of what Christ was doing for the church he was given his life for the church so he became a sinner on the cross of Calvary to take our sin he didn't know any sin he knew no sin but that we might be made the righteousness of God he put partook of the sin he partook of the fruit like Adam partook of the fruit that Eve gave adam had every right to leave Eve hang him but I'm so glad the Lord didn't leave me hanging amen she was wrong but he extended out Grace to her to bring her and when God saw that great he made a plan of Escape for both of them to be saved and so after Adam we'll see that um our Lord uh the Jehovah of the Old Testament brings in Noah we read about Noah requirement for Noah and this age was to have faith to believe him all you had to do was get on the ark or would you or be married to one of his sons basically all you had to do was get on the ark you had plenty of time and Noah's out there preaching away and preaching away and God is through with man and Humanity every imagination is evil all the time he says I'm through it man I'm going to destroy but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord I'm through with everybody but you know you found Grace now this is what you need to do here's the wood here's the plans here's the length of the wood here's how I want it built three floors here's the animals that need to come in I'll do my part you do your part and he built he's working on this Ark and all you had to do was get into Noah's Ark after the Hebrews go down to Egypt there were slaves they're let out with a mighty hand under a tremendous law Giver one of the greatest prophets in the bible one of the names that's known throughout the Bible one of the most famous names throughout the Bible That's The Prophet Moses Moses born a proper child God calls him and raises him up and the people followed Moses that age requirement was to be in the Covenant that God gave them of circumcision and followed the laws and all of the protocols and and the land was very important to God restoring Israel their land and then of course we know John the Baptist another great time or age for Humanity he was a forerunner to Christ the Lord Jesus Christ that requirement in Jesus's day was to believe that he was who he said he was he was God made flesh he was The Lord Of Glory easy for us to believe that today we have history to prove it but in that day it was hard for Pharisees and Sadducees who spent their whole life studying the scripture and the law of Moses and here comes a new Young priest or young new Prophet Jesus from Nazareth doing things we've never seen done before but you had to believe that you had to receive that Jesus said except you believe that I am he you'll die in your sins you'll die in your sins except you believe that I'm the one before Abraham was I am he I'm the one and I had a hard time but there was an elect that caught that and then of course after the day of Pentecost and the great Reformation of the church and the ages and here we are today our requirement today is a little bit more difficult more deep than any other age that's gone on before so let's get into that just a little bit here as the Lord will help us in the message the Rapture paragraph 65. prophet of God says this here but to the church the bride the Rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her that the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture now it is a revelation for the Revelation is faith you cannot have Revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that has been revealed to you like it was to Abraham that could call anything contrary to what have been revealed to him as though it wasn't so now Faith that's what faith is is the revelation of God the church is built upon a revelation the whole entire body brother Madam continues on paragraph 154 same message the Rapture he said the first thing that comes forth in his message calling the bride together the next thing is the resurrection of the sleeping bride the ones that died back in the other ages they caught together and the trumpet the feast in the heavens in the sky that's the thing that takes place friends we're right there ready now the only thing the church coming out has got to lay before the sun to ripen and you say Amen amen we're right there ready now ready for what ready for the Rapture the going away we're getting out of here it's all culminating to this God had an objection in his mind he had a purpose in his mind he had a reason why he brought man here there's a reason why he allowed to fall so that he can produce a savior to the world we wouldn't know what a savior was if nobody wasn't needed a savior if nobody was lost wouldn't know what a Healer is somebody had to get sick we wouldn't know what a friend is unless you had an enemy or a fold but God reveals that he allows it he doesn't do it but he allows it and then he reveals himself as the friend as the Savior as the Healer brother Benham in the message once more he says this here paragraph 177. so we know there's a Rapture to the church Saints we're looking for that rapture here's what the prophet of God says Lord Jesus Great Master Of Life The Shepherd of the sheep come forth Lord these people are hungry they're thirsty Lord years I've wanted to see this happen maybe it will just once more Lord one more great move of the spirit One More Time Lord and the church might receive the rapturing faith to go in granted Lord make known that you are with us and we will praise thee for it in Jesus name we ask it amen in the message the token 1963 the prophet of God says this I am looking for a time of a Break Forth a Break Forth of the spirit of God in these last days that we're now living in for another surge of the Holy Spirit into the church now he's looking for that he's looking for it into the church for a rapturing faith just before it comes and everything is sitting straight in order for that and I believe that we're now at the time that the word should have preeminence I believe that the time to lay aside our Creeds and our thoughts and come back to the word as our brother said this morning it's time to stop playing Church we're not here to play Church we're here to get ready for the rapture for the great going away and before we can have a rapture we got to have Rapture in faith amen I'm gonna have a power a surge come to us something greater than what we have right now some of us can't get along we can't we don't have what it takes we have a little bit God's been good to us but we we know we don't have what it takes for the body change something is lacking something is missing and whatever's missing whatever I need I want it Lord is that your attitude if God sent a great move of the Holy Spirit to this church would you get offended by it would you call it fanaticism would you be tripping on Church order would you would you step back with your arms folded trying to examine Who's In the Flesh and who's not or would you be looking for power to come upon me Lord if you're blessing him bless me too amen I'm looking for a surge I need a surge I need an anointing I need a touch from the master I need to feel his precious one more time amen the prophet continues says and everyone knows that look away to Jesus everyone knows that for certain as the first was identified so the second has been identified and you'll think real closely You Are Spiritual as the Bible said here's to him that has wisdom the third is properly identified see we know where it is so the third pull is here so sacred I mustn't say much about it as you told me in the beginning say nothing of it remember that years ago it speaks for itself I've tried to explain the others I made a mistake this will be the thing that to my opinion I don't say the Lord tells me this this will be a thing that will start the rapturing faith for the going away see this is 1963. it comes down to 1964 and the message countdown and he says this here now paragraph 175 now look I've said some pretty rough things about airplane automobile remember they are horsepower too all of it is a horsepower the church is just moving up holy ghost power is the holy ghost that we're justified by you ministers know that don't you the Holy Ghost sanctifies us the Holy Ghost fills us the Holy Ghost gives us Rapture in faith as we move up Jehovah Jireh 1964. now I may not have faith enough to make every word of it Act but I certainly wouldn't stand in the way of nobody that did have that Faith Enoch had faith enough one day to take an afternoon stroll with God and just keep on walking he went on home without dying now I think the church has got to come to that to a rapturing faith I may not have that Faith just now listen to The Prophet now I may not have that Faith just now but I sure wouldn't stand in the way of somebody that did have that faith all right paragraph number four in spiritual food and due season and I want to maybe close here or prepare to close here and just really hammer on this one here and he says this here have a prayer line as we can get one up here but you're dedicating this service tonight for prayer for the sake and I want you to get built up now in this holy Oracles of God in the faith the faith of this hour the faith is going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be rapturing Faith be taken up and so we want you to believe tonight in all that you have seen heard the word that you have heard preached the signs and wonders that you have seen done we want you we want you to accumulate all that together in your heart and consider it whether it be God or not so here the prophet is telling us that our age requirement is more than any other age required you know the sin of today if I was to go back and was able to transfer back in time and just go back to 1980 I was 10 years old or so in 1980 and I was to go back and look at the churches in that day and I and I handed them a piece of paper of what we would be preaching against and what the world is struggling with Humanity wise and church people them church people probably wouldn't even believe what I was trying to tell them like we know it's gonna get bad it'll never get that bad and I had a one of the preachers that I always looked up to he was a bishop a bishop Foster CT Foster he wasn't our pastor but he was an evangelist like he wasn't a bishop he was an evangelist that went around very experienced I always looked up to him and I said under a bishop Bishop Lewin and I always looked up to him these are just Pentecostals Pentecostal Holiness preachers and they did things that wasn't right doctrinally they didn't understand a lot of things Dr Lee but but those Holy Ghost preachers back in the 1980s I will take them over some of the message preachers today that's a hard statement to say but their attitude their reverence their commitments you talk about a prayer meeting five babies talking about fasting a week I'm talking about meetings a weekday of meetings preaching Services Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Saturday we can't do that here y'all won't let me we can't do that here because amen oh but but their their life that they live I'll take I'll take some of what they had over a lot of the nonsense that I see today because we're in a different time and it requires a tenacity in your faith that you can't be looking at other people as your guide to serving the lord you gotta have your guide as the Lord himself in Your Vision he's the one that we serve yes sir he's the one that we're dedicated to is that Mike too loud is that too loud for you all right good I can hear myself good but if we're the one we're the ones we're dedicated to him and this age requires I'm talking about a tenacity just to make a prayer meeting just to make it to Wednesday night's service just to make it to Sunday night service just to keep the all the Commandments of the Lord because this age has us so busy with the things of the world and people have changed and the requirement of the age is rapturing faith or Rapture in Grace and there's a reason why Satan is howling it's a terminology brother Branham uses howling look at what he's done in the world today look at the look at the the garbage that's going on in the world today look at what's going on in the churches look at look at the young men today look at the young women today and so-called preachers too it requires a faith and I thank God that he's given us the evening light that we can have the faith for the rapture that's our objective today that's our Focus today is that I will be ready to stand before the son of man that I would accumulate the faith that this age requires not The Faith from any other age but this age requires a rapturing faith what are those virtues add to your faith virtue into virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness Godly Miss brotherly kindness brotherly kindness charity which is love which is perfect love this is our objective is perfect love this is our objective is to be sealed with his Divine love now the prophet of God takes the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed and he says this here many many things he says but I want to bring this here to you as he's he was going further and deeper into the message he was at the three hour mark and he says this here so you know that God had his great Secret in his mind and he revealed that to his people and they were the prophet of God says here this is paragraph 541. so he's already built the message up he's gone three hours already you've got an hour left to go but at the three-hour Mark he says this in this message Christ is the mystery of God revealed you newcomers you visitors we're not going to preach three hours okay I'm not setting you up but yeah but if I did I bless you paragraph 541 it says one more great remark I want to make if I have to move over a little bit now notice listen to this now is the great thing now is where we want to watch remember in the last days we'll exactly go back and vindicate the first day see Adam and Eve husband and wife know sin life then the fall now notice notice closely notice what caused it Lucifer Lucifer is doing now as he did at the first time just as the kingdom of the Gentiles was brought in with King Nebuchadnezzar Vindicated the Gentile raised by a prophet who could interpret unknown tongues visions and dreams and it's come down through the Gentiles without anything just medoin Persians iron and so forth the feet goes out the same way the Gentile Kingdom notice Lucifer in the last days is doing as he did at the first what did Lucifer do the first thing that Lucifer done to separate the fellowship of God and man he wanted to build him a United Kingdom a greater Splendor and seemingly more cultured and a greater Kingdom than Michael Christ had you got it now if you miss it just hold up your hand I'll say it again you see Lucifer at the beginning his purpose in heart was to achieve a brighter and greater thing in heaven than Christ had is that right by seemingly a more cultured more beautiful more splendored than the kingdom of Christ do you do you think we'll have automobiles in the Millennium and airplanes see see what Lucifer is doing now the big fancy intellectual denominations are doing the very same thing Gathering themselves together to do the same thing they're Gathering and denominating themselves each one trying to beat the other I was one of the other definitions on Pride I I left those little notes in on my desk there and I didn't bring it out but it's okay on this Pride it's usually a flex it's comparing themselves with someone else too it's not just it's not just them being who they are they've got to now be better than someone else see because their desire is ill-gotten so it will never be full it's Inc it's corrupted if they would just be who they are you can be satisfied with who you are but when you're competing and trying to take what Michael had and you're trying to build something bigger and better than the other denominations have this is Lucifer's job he comes down in Pride I want let's take a scripture here quickly I don't know how this will tie in but I I want to read this this came to me this week Ezekiel 28. it's believed about where I want to take Ezekiel 28. in verse 1 through 10 I think it talks about this Prince we've always look at verse 11 and 12 and 13 about the the king of Tyra how he's been in Edom the precious stones but look at look at in in Ezekiel 28 and verse 1 it said verse two son of man saying to the prince of Tyrus thus say the Lord God because thy heart is lifted up and thou has said I am a god I sit in the seed of God in the midst of the Seas yet thou art a man and not God though thou set thy heart as the heart of God behold Thou Art wiser than Daniel there's no secret then they can hide from thee with thy wisdom and with thy God without thine understanding thou has gotten these riches has gotten gold and silver into thy Treasures by that great wisdom and by that traffic has thou increased thy riches thy heart is lifted up because of thy riches therefore thus saith the Lord God because thou has set thy heart as the heart of God behold therefore I will bring strangers upon thee the terrible of the Nations and they shall draw their swords against the beauty thy wisdom and they shall defile that brightness they shall bring thee down to the pit thou shall die the death of them that are slain in the midst of the Seas without yet say before him that slate Thee I am God but thou shall be a man and know God in the hand of him that slayeth thee thou shall die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of the strangers for I have spoken it says the Lord the Lord is rebuking this Prince because he lifted himself up like he is a god even lifted himself up against who Daniel was Daniel had the spirit of the Gods in him God made Daniel who he was he is a prophet he saw Visions the nation recognized it God made him that Daniel didn't make himself that that would be different a man can't make himself anything you are who you are the problem comes when you try to be something that you are not and then in your heart you lift yourself up above this is why people you know they're scrapping claw for positions on the job they'll see other people come with gifts and talents and selling them appreciating those and working with those they feel threatened by it because it's a competition now you got another churches growing or another church is another Ministry is coming up another and then you start feeling the flex you start feeling the threat because you got your eyes on the wrong thing you're supposed to be serving the God who brought you here and in that service we're preparing our hearts for the greatest event that our lives will know that's the Rapture amen we don't want to get that Focus off of our mind but this Pride it's a horrible thing it it sits it sets this message God hiding in Simplicity brother Branham brings that before he brings the great revelation of the Seven Seals brother Brianna preach the message Pride and he talks about that woman that brought the alabaster box how Simon invited him to his house and didn't wash his dirty feet if you listen to the tape brother Venom gets all emotional it's like he gets into character of the woman and he actually sees Jesus with dirty feet this is where you can preach this is when you can pray this is when you can live when you get into character of what you are reading about it's not a story it becomes a reality and he was weeping Jesus with dirty feet but here comes a woman now she's an ill-fained woman prostitute and she makes her way to Jesus finds his dirty feet and begins to cry and weep over his feet she begins to kiss his feet I want you to look at that just for a moment that's that's a pretty that's a pretty I mean a woman kissing this man's feet She's kissing the right feet though and Simon there said if he knew what kind of woman she was this is the religious people the Pharisee religious people they know the Bible they know Moses they know all the laws all of them their knowledge on the word ain't the problem their pride is the problem their pride will lift you up to where you can't identify with people who ain't you you cross the street when you see something different you cross the street when you see something threatening I'm a priest I can't touch nothing dirty I came you know I gotta I'm on my way to pray I can't be late for prayer meeting I'm not gonna stop with this sinner and help him I'm too busy trying to serve God why would I spend my time on a sinner when I'm trying to serve God if he knew what kind of woman she was he wouldn't let her be washing his feet and Jesus caught it he picked it all up he catches it all this woman is kissing him kissing his feet her hair falls down the only Glory that she has she begins to wipe his feet with the tears that flow from her heart and she she gets the most expensive box of oil alabaster box of oil she purchases it and she brings out alabaster box of oil and breaks it open and begins to anoint his feet kisses feet and with tears she's just weeping and crying what a sight and brother random brings that over to today and how we the religious people we're so we're so religious that for us to do that that's not our job to do that that's for the foot wash flunky they're supposed to wash his feet that's where those newcomers the altar is not for old-time Elders altars for newcomers officers for Sinners I mean like real Sinners not like us like real sinners but you see that's the spirit that's an attitude that's Pride and if they're ever was a group of people that could get lifted up in Pride it would be the people that followed this word because this word is the truth you had a greater opportunity to get caught into Pride so what do we do we want to stay humble don't we God hides in that simplicity and we're looking for this great event of the Rapture to take place and here Pride will get in our way that's why we have to have faith virtue knowledge temperatures in all of those virtues and then the love of God seals it he begins the message if you remember isn't one of these long really heavy heavy messages Christ is the mystery of God revealed he begins the message with a word to the church how many remember that huh time to remember that a word to the church remember love one another no matter what Satan will come among you and then at the end of the message he ends it again with the warning of loving one another hmm let me finish this message here what the prophet of God says here in this message God's uh trying to do God a service without it being as well one two three a couple quotes here and then and then we will let you go all right all right paragraph 259 trying to do God of service without it being his will he says there won't be any denomination just remember for the Jack's here he's a historian many of you are there's never been a Revival but about three years after the Revival they started a denomination on it is that right and this great miracle move of God in the last days it's went 20 years it's a million miles from a denomination going further away all the time the Shucks pulling away no cooperation no nothing with it see always it pulls away from it there can't be no more it's a week now but we're plenty of green mm-hmm that's right we have to have to lay in the presence of the sun to be mellowed up that's all of it plenty green we haven't got what the sincerity the sacredness yes the thing we ought to have in our midst to know that the spirit of the Living God is moving his word is showing us the things yet God's provided place of worship he continues paragraph 40 he says I believe the church is beginning to hear the message I begin and begin to understand but friends listen we've got to lay in the presence of the sun we've got to be ripened our faith isn't right intellectually we're hearing the message that God has given us in seeing the signs that he showed us and proving it by the Bible it's there but oh how the church needs to lay in his presence till it tenders up you know and gets sweet in the spirit so they can be so it can bathe down sometime in speaking the message you get harsh you have to break it like that because you got to clench a nail to make it hold but when the church once gets it the elected is called out and separated then in the presence of God I know it'll be something like the people was there when it takes its rapture praise the Lord don't you love the Lord hear this quote here in the message all things like just recently when our movements got started God begins to adding something to them and went off with it and made a tradition out of it lost its power instead of bringing Brotherhood together it's separated Brotherhood you do it sometime just for tradition without the sincerity of it he got to enter the Feast of God with sincerity no real sincerity no real sorrow for sin people come up to the Altar and many of them take a lot of music a little dancing clapping of the hands maybe run up and down the aisle maybe just speak with tongues now I believe in speaking in tongues I believe in running up and down the aisles I believe in clapping other hands but if there isn't some feeling behind there if there some sincerity that Jesus Christ has cleansed you not doing it because Miss Jones did it but doing it because there's something in you pulsating the sorrow for your sins and the joy of the victory that you share in the resurrection of your for of your sacrifice the evidence of your eternal security how can you not be sincere in that amen oh my we want that sincerity don't we need that mellowness that sweetness we need that humility we need that Pride taken away from us Lord Purge me and Purify Me of how I think how good of a Preacher I think I am or good of a Christian I think wait till they meet me wait till they hear me say it wait to hear my testimony wait wait till you know what that's just a wrong view of yourself ain't about you there's nothing to do with you it's about what he did he had a purpose and that purpose was to save you and that's the only reason why you're saved because he purposed it within himself don't that make you thankful don't that make you grateful doesn't that make you appreciative doesn't that make you want to share that with someone else that he can do that for if he can do it for you um he could do it for them and we know I won't get into it this morning but we know that Satan has launched this great attack brother Branham says he is howling because because of this great work that God is doing in you and I you know that woman that was washing Jesus's feet brother Branham said that you know Jesus could ruin his reputation with that woman yeah yeah and then brother random comes back and says no he makes his reputation with sinners it's the Sinners that makes him famous it's the Sinners The Sinner that needed to be saved is what elevates that he's a savior and when he told that woman those words your sins are no more I don't know what greater words a human being would want to hear from the god of creation your sins which are many are all gone they're no more he had the power to tell her that and he told her that look at her broken Spirit look at her knowledge or whatever look at her history look at her you know she wasn't perfect she didn't have all the history of other believers she her life was all messed up she got but she got this right she got this right she saw Jesus with dirty feet she got the most valuable thing she could get she brought it to him and we're preaching about her this morning and that's the way it goes that's a God that we serve faith for a Rapture rapturing Faith that's what the age requirement is Faith for this great that's the next move Saints and God will give that to us if we stay humble and stay with us word God bless you let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your word this morning we thank you for these Saints and these Believers that have come we commit our ways to you Lord we commit these words that were spoken to think of your great promise the power that you have Unleashed Upon Us Lord you you made us your Victory we're the prize that you fought for at Calvary we're the reason that you took the stripes on your back we're the reason you came down to redeem Fallen men that we can be put right again to be put back in place like Adam as a as a man of authority Lord and we're coming to that place of redemption oh God I just thinking how you stand in the shadows of our life influencing us and we can't even see it until finally our eyes come open like the man in the pig pen he came to himself he recognized that he has a father that his father had riches that land he had a Heritage he had an inheritance and he recognized that you know I don't deserve even a room I don't deserve even the status to be a son of such a great father but maybe I can go back home and I'll just work for that as a servant I don't deserve it but I sure need it I'll I won't come back entitled I'm the son I'm your son I got your last name no no I'll go back as a servant and I'll just try to work for him and it's in that humility it's in that Brokenness that you'll never turn or broken in a contrite heart Lord I've seen it so many times seated so many times man or woman they'll somehow just come to themself and they realize they deserve nothing you owe them nothing and they'll make that turn to you and you're standing there with your Arms Wide Open all along all the time waiting for them to make that turn in their life and they run off and they're doing whatever they're doing there's doing their secret sin they're running not many people know about it and so they keep running but you're standing there with your Arms Wide Open waiting for them to Humble themselves and say Lord I can't do it I can't do it anymore I need your help I'm running back to you Lord and this man turns back to head to his father's house it is Father sees him from afar and his father doesn't judge him his father doesn't have a rules or regulations for him his father was so happy to see him that he leaves the house and he meets him halfway and brings his son back home kills a fat calf gives them the clothes that he needs washes him up puts them back in place again and we're trying to get put back in place like what Adam lost you're trying to put us put us right Lord set us right in our spirits in our humility the way we handle the word the way we handle other people the way we handle denominations and handle people who don't have a revelation where we handle a sinner girl or sinner boy the way we think about them people Lord put us right put our minds right again because that's the kind of people that makes the rapture and the Rapture in faith is wrapped in that I believe that lord it's in that humility and our thoughts to our words oh God others [Music] we pray father for those precious Hearts gathered here today Lord let there be one here
