believe only believe only believe all things are possible only be you may be seated brother BR now anyone knows that the Catholic church was brought into existence at the nen Council before there it was called a nickel Adan by God which means nickel nickel to conquer overcome or overthrow the Ley and when they did that they didn't want the spirit amongst the people and pastors which means Shepherds to let the Holy Spirit you say well can't the priest be a Shepherd what kind of foods he feeding you do you get the same results they had the day of Pentecost certainly not Hail Mary who ever seen that at Pentecost no venas all this sprinkling Po and using a Triune god father son Holy Ghost where do you ever get that at Pentecost amen hallah Jesus set up the house of Israel oh surely God's made the same Jesus who you crucified both Lord and Christ amen that's right where do we get those things it's a nicadan begin with and formed up into Catholicism now you say well I'm sure glad that I'm not amongst them now just don't be too sure I remember Christianity nicadan now do you get the story listen close before we go any farther I want you to get it if we stay here till midnight amen because brother it's your soul amen you said well I belong to I ain't I ain't if you haven't got the Holy Ghost brother I don't care how many churches you belong to you're lost if you are not born again in the spirit of God by the baptism of the Holy Spirit you're lost because you haven't got eternal life and eternal life is the only thing that God will raise up because it's the only life it's left if a grain of corn as I quoted year at the agriculture hour how many rememb his old brother Spurgeon the Methodist preacher up in Henryville a wonderful old character we were setting at the ice cream fountain at red furnishes one day eating ice cream and we were talking about a meeting that I had up there and the agriculture hour was on and red had the the little speaker turned on and of the of His Radio sitting out there and somewhere they were speaking of course the messages coming from Louisville but the 4 Club had had got a machine that could turn out a grain of corn that they could put the calcium and petroleums and everything into the corn and make it look just exactly like it was made from uh the 4 head it science had perfected it that the corn look so real that you could take a handful out of the sack grow in the field handful out sack machine it turned out and this over here at the machine turn would make the same kind of corn flakes cornbread and actually you could take them down to the laboratory and cut them apart the grains and you couldn't tell one from the other had the same amount of petroleum sound same amount of calcium and and moisture everything that went in one grain it was in the other he said the only definite way to know that which was grow in the field and which was made by the machine big bury both handfuls and they both rotted and the one that was made by Machine would not come up again amen but the one that God growed lived again why because it was not gerti am and you might look like a Christian act like a Christian and do every good deed that you could do and live faithful to your church but unless you are geraedts amen the life of God eternal life coming in you not by confession but by a gift of the Holy Ghost how do you get it the doctor said on the day of Pentecost it wrote the prescription repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the gift of the Holy Ghost which is eternal life that's the only thing that God will raise up it's the only thing he's got life he can raise up up that's the only thing it can go hope that's clear God grant that it's clear now uh the nians then had the formal sign and they married to the Pagan Church bringing in Pagan altars making Christian altars brought in a pagan God and made it speak and talk in this form of a bishop set up there rob it up and make it look like a god see it's not what's on the outside it's what's on the inside them two grains of corn look the same it wasn't what was on the outside it's what was on the inside the inside the light well it was made there and that was the birthplace of early Catholic Church was the mother of all church denominations now you say well uh brother Brandon then as long as I am Catholic not just one minute let's stop here just a second by the way and let's us turn turn now to Revelation 17th chapter just a minute just turn right straight to it now this is a revelation of what Jesus Christ to his churches as I read listen close and there came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying come here and I will show Thee the Judgment of the great that set up on many Waters now so that I can have a witness how many knows that a woman in the Bible every time that's given an assemble means the church all right how many knows that the great right here in the same chapter is the city that's set on Seven Hills amen all right and now how many knows that the Bible said the waters here she set up on many Waters not a water but Waters and Waters means the people I get the 15th chapter you can see there 15th verse and he said unto me the waters which thou sawest where the hor sth are people multitudes Nations and towns see now this woman was an apostate wasn't she now this is teaching so you must put your conscience behind you now see what is uh that foul woman called is a woman that's untrue to her marriage vow now the church the Catholic Church claims to be the bride and the wife of Christ even the nuns cut off their hair and have no affections they're all affections to Christ is that right sure anybody I come from a Catholic background see I got their facts of our faith and their books and your Protestants and the Baptists and whatever you believe they in my study so I studyed so if anybody says anything whoop I can back you right up to your own say so the hour has come for this to go out now first thing God had to move across the nation showing signs wonders and miracles that the people would know God's sheep knows his [Applause] boy you know exactly you have to find first you go out without being KNN then you just what do you do you do more harm than ever let it let God take care of that I'll show Thee the Judgment of the great now if she was that then she was a woman professing to be something that she was committing adultery is that right well then if it was a church she was committing adultery against God is that right then adultery be fornications spiritual fornications she's teaching something to the people that it's not God's word amen is that right right she's teaching something that isn't true amen that's the nians amen see it coming here going about putting popes and Priests and taking the Holy Spirit out days of Miracles is passing the Bible said Jesus Christ SE yesterday and forever the Bible said repent be baptized everyone in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins he says Father Son and Holy Ghost sprinkle poor oh my see all watch what this woman was doing whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornications and the inhabitants of Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornications drunk kill you putt you to death shoot you or anything else brother they're absolutely drunk on that stuff see the wine that's what she's giving out her wine of her fornications let me tell you something my mother was Catholic God you said that's horrible now just wait a minute proest I'm talking to these on the tapes so he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw I saw a woman sitting up a Scarlet colored Beast now what does the word scarlet detect it detects royalty means I mean means Ro loyal Royal see like kings and so forth full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and 10 horns now the seven heads are the seven mountains on which the city sits and this woman is the city and the woman was arrayed in purple the woman the Beast was Scarlet but the woman was arrayed in purple now have I not warned you the other day there's three curtains I don't know how long I live but remember this as I told you many years ago what Russia there's three curtains remember this there is the Iron Curtain there is the bamboo curtain red ch and so and there's a purple curtain amen you watch that curtain that's the deceiver so much the woman was arrayed in purple Scarlet colors decked with gold precious stones and Pearls remember me speaking back here what the first alar was of the nickel see woman being the church having a golden cup in her hand remember the gold overl alter cup she was giving to people full of the abomination of the filthiness of her fornication that's what she's giving the people they were swallowing it sure drunk on it just drunk all that bunch of Irish and French and so forth cut your throat if you say one thing against that church and upon H her forehead was a name written mystery Babylon now where did Babylon mooved from from Babylon up into pergamus and become Satan shifting his seat oh I wish we could go through all Revelations so he could see it Babylon the great the mother of harlots a mother of harlots and Abominations of the earth what was she a mother of har that was his sons was he Church yes sir said isn't a church called in the Bible Babylon see in their own book all right now if she was a prostitute a and she was a mother of harlots she had to have daughters and if they were daughters they were girls they were churches now where did the Protestant Church come from is that right what's the difference between a a and a harlot the same name Martin Luther came out to switch out to give the true church a chance Wesley on into Pentecost and every one of them went right back to that nickel idea amen amen of organizing with General overseers and everything else and went right back with the same baptism that they were baptized with same Farm same ceremonies even many them with catechisms and hail not Hail Marys but U what's this it's about the same thing that Apostles Creed show me the Apostles Creed in the Bible brother if they had a Creed it's acts 238 amen that's what they commanded everybody to do or did you ever hear Apostle make a Creed say I believe in the Holy Roman Catholic Church lead in the communion of saints when the Peter the one that had the key said there's no other mediator between God and man but Christ Jesus but look at the Protestant churches what did they do they couldn't be satisfied each one of them had come out come out with a Pentecostal blessing it's exactly right even Martin Luther spoke in tongues it's exactly right excuse the S saying God these horrible words I'm muttering I don't know what I'm saying sure he believed in it certainly he did now down through the age they've had had the spirit but they always pull away and make organizations they have them first Founders are gone if You' left the Lutheran Church go on and not organized it it' been Pentecostal what is the Pentecostal church I mean the real Pentecostal not the denomination now it's just as uh pot and KD again see but they've done the same thing and I put them right back at the nickel adans just like they did at the beginning how many sees that say amen I just sort I have your word that you see a mother of prostitutes if they're prostitutes how did they become prostitutes by committing fornications amen against the word of God if the word of God said repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and every person in there was baptized in jesus' name and then you take Father Son and Holy Ghost that's prostitution amen amen that right amen and if the Bible of baptizing is by immersing baptizo from the Greek word then how do you get sprinkling and porn amen where does that coming at if you substitute shaking hands or taking a wafer on your lip and swalling or something other like that for the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost came from heaven like a russan might he went and filled the people and made him speak in tongues and shout and act like a drunk person and you subtitute shaking hands or put your letter in a church or something like that how are you ever going to get out of the way of committing spiritual fornications amen I just ask yourself that shake your minds down open up your heart and be honest Brethren we're at the end of the road these meetings are just not set here in vain they were ordered of God Amen I believe it is ch you believe me to be his servant I said in the name of Jesus that God placed upon my heart to come here I don't get one penny for doing it I could be out praying for the sick somewhere or something like that or I could be out under uh going fishing and drawing my money just the same I get a salary from the church but God placed it up on my heart I couldn't get away from it just kept crying to me at it and I'm doing all I can I'm here in the name of the Lord everything I know how to do yes don't let it pass you amen now Protestant do you see what I mean by the Catholic and Protestant church just one is just the same as the other it's exactly right now means wedded pergamus means wedded now let's take he said thou has them among you that has the doctrine of balum let's just just take that have we got time I'll hurry just quick as I can or would you rather just wait and see if we can come back in the morning how many just wor to go ahead just a little while longer all right I know it's hot in here if you're sitting still and hot what do you think up here you see but oh my we're trying to get away from that place that is hot that's what it is eternal now of course when they set up a church like that what happened I listen closely my children what happened well of course that took the Holy Ghost right out of the church no wonder another Bishops raised the dead or done the Miracles and them talking about some of these Saints being in their Church they protested the things but they claim them look at Jon of Arc that young girl I ask you Catholic people are you Protestants any of you Jonah Ark and her D wasn't nothing in France there but the Catholic church that smothered the Saints down but God moved upon that girl and she had the Holy Ghost and what did she do she could foretell things the Lord would give her visions and foretell it she prayed for the sick she prayed for a little dead baby and he come back to life again that's Pentecostal amen see and what did the Catholic Church due to her because she protested the Catholic Church they called her a trial and burn her to the stake as a witch and now you say sa jonar 200 years later about when the church found out what they had done as she was a saint oh of course they done repentance part they dug up those priest's body who sanctioned her death and fow him in the river you think that'll ever wash the blood off its hands the Bible said the the blood of every Marty was found in it that's what the angel of the Lord said said was found in Babylon every murder or martyr and all the Saints of Christ that was ever Marty was found right in here from the nickel age on through every Marty think of that thank you brother now thank of that now just a little further now the Christian Church married to um to uh to Babylon perus means the wedding now the doctrine of balum you have them among you who has the doctrine of balum oh I just love these things if you just stay a little longer on one see but you just we W to let you see it and then move on to something else cuz it's just just full of golden nuggets I'm a prospector I like to go down and dig these nuggets up and shine them up and polish them up like this look at them and every one of them will reflect Jesus Christ every one of them amen see every one of them reflects Jesus Christ amen he's the Alpha and the Omega every every carriot of golden the Nugget that's right he is every bit of it that's reason he's deity made flesh Among Us e [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

the Lord and give him the glory come on give him some praise give him some praise Lord thank you for your grace for your mercy for the word of the Lord amen praise the Lord they can't take our praise brother John they can put us in jail they can take our houses our land take our family but they can't take our praise amen God bless you amen so we like to go to the word this morning God bless you thank you for those songs Amen in the New Testament scriptures the book right before the Book of Revelations the little big book called The Book of Jude just one chapter we have been talking about the Great Purge and um really speaking of Joshua and Caleb and the real theme of these series of meetings I've been in for the last few months was the inspiration comes from that prophecy that brother bandam gives about Joshua and Caleb he said let us stand like them so what is he telling us he you know the scriptures are written to highlight the believer now we talk about the evil that's out there because it's appropriate to talk about it the word tells us to to point those things out but it's really all about you know Calvary isn't that someone died and suffered but why did he die and suffer he died and suffered because he loved you it was his love the great love of God it wasn't because he felt sorry for you and he just you know felt like doing something good for he actually loves you and he's concerned about you and when you can think about the love of God you be like Lord you did that for me yes for you then then all of this begins to make sense then he's not he's not trying to catch me and trying to beat me over the head and just correct me out he loves me that's why he's all in my business that's why he's on top of me that's why my conscience won't let me do certain things because he loves me how many thank God for his love this morning and the the whole purpose of this Joshua and Caleb to highlight let me close this door real quick to highlight it is to really bring out the True Believer and how there is no there is no other set of human beings like Christians people who believe God when they get in contact with their maker there's nothing greater nothing more tenacious nothing more powerful you cannot stop a Believer when a Believer has been in contact with their God you know their home can be parted their spouse can leave and families can leave but a Believer like job job is going to stay with the word Hallelujah nothing more tenacious nothing more beautiful nothing more is drought resistant it's tolerant to all kind of environments is a True Believer amen and that's what the scriptures are highlighting that's the purpose of the word for us today now Jude takes a little bit of time in Jude chapter there's only one chapter there and I want to read for you starting with verse number five he says I will therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this how that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterwards destroyed them that believe not and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habit ation he hath reserved in Everlasting chains under Darkness unto the Judgment of the great day remember he's reminding you even as Sodom and gomorah and the cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh are set forth for an example suffering the vengence of Eternal fire likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh despise dominion and speak evil of dignities Yet Michael the Archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses there not bring a against him a reling accusation but said the Lord rebuke these but these speak evil of those things which they know not but what they know naturally as brute B beasts what they can prove on the internet whatever in those things they corrupt themselves woe unto them for they have gone in the way of C so he's calling names now and it ran greedily after the ER of balum for reward and perished in the gangsing of Kora these are spots in your feasts of Charity when they Feast with you feeding themselves without fear clouds they are without water water carried about of winds trees whose fruit withered without fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots and it continues on Raging um waves of the sea and these are and he he talks about Enoch but look at verse 20 says but ye beloved building up yourselves on your Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost keep yourselves in the love of God Amen looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life now isn't that nice what a message to you beloved amen let us pray Lord Jesus ask your blessings on your word this morning as you bless every heart that's gathered bless the brethren in Mesa this morning the stream and those ones that cannot be here Lord my dear wife and Levi that are traveling remember them and each one Lord that's associated with the church here may you bless them and help us we pray from the youngest one to the oldest one today speak to our hearts we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated brother L's nephew is here with us for the first time this is Thomas he's been with us before and and he's brother L's nephew so we welcome him to the house of the Lord amen and everyone else is welcome as well amen so but you beloved it's it's beautiful how Jude turns this to you belov it he's pointing out all of these that did not believe now Jude doesn't interesting thing the Lord will help me we'll move right forward and and just get right to this message and um and we'll just stop when we stop okay but Judas is um pointing out he he reminds them and and as what what he does he putting them in remembrance and he brings the example with Israel coming out of Egypt then he goes beyond the curtain were the Angels they kept not their first estate that's another example so it's Israel in Egypt the angels that didn't keep their first estate then he brings in Sodom and gomorah as an example all the cities about them they gave over to all these crazy things and then he deals with the filthy dreamers and those that are now he's speaking of the apostasy so this great Purge that we were talking about as we talked about Joshua and Caleb and how to stand like them or to stand with them you got to stand like something you got to stand with something and we are believers today and we stand with the word that's what we are we we're we're not contractors we're not Farmers we're not this that or the other we're not Americans we're not this citizen or that one we are believers and it's true we are Americans We Are Farmers we are contractors but that's just secondarily really who you are in God is a Believer and God has given us an example on how to walk and how to live and the day that we live in and Jude is bringing this out he's highlighting how the Angels didn't keep their first estate how the Lord delivered Israel and then destroyed them afterwards and then Sodom and gomorah and then he brings in these um ones these filthy dreamers as the Apostle Peter and the Apostle Paul gives warning of the great apostasy to come we spoke about that last Sunday the falling away the Sunday before that we spoke about gilgal and how we needed another circumcision in that journey and how men and women we can neglect that and it's part of you know the Lord reminds us of those things and then and under this Great Purge as well the first one that we spoke about was Jesus making statements that he did not explain so that he can knock off all the parasites that's what that's what the prophet called them and so he made statements to shake them off and we're calling this the Great Purge because every believer needs that the tree needs it the plant needs it you need it a church needs it the people need a cleaning of the Dead things in your life things get old things get crusty you need to renew that you need to you know cut things away you need to shave things off so you can get lighter and be more efficient in your service to the Lord and this is why we call it the Great Purge and you know this is probably why Joshua was so successful it's because of the Great Purge that happened now he was successful for many reasons and one of those reasons is found in Joshua 1 and8 we spoke about um the prophecy for the believer and then how the true believers they stand with the word and doing so we see the success of Joshua is not only because of Joshua 1 and8 that the Lord told him to meditate on these things day and night and to keep the word in your mouth and to observe to do them amen then you'll be successful and so that's his success came from staying with the word day and night keeping the word in his mouth meditating on it and also the Lord cleaned house for him it was a 40-year cleansing it was 40 Years of cleaning house took them 40 Years of cutting off this one cutting off that one so let's look at this time of wandering we know that kades barnea was a pivotal time for them K kades Baria revealed to us who Joshua and Caleb was it highlighted them these two brothers stood up against not 500 not a th they stood up against the entire congregation and and and without any without any Supernatural vind Vindication that the Lord was going to bring them out they was willing to go For Broke they were willing to give their lives and that's what a true Revelation does it causes you to take a stand without checking out the repercussions not checking out if how popular it is you said it because it was the right thing to say you stood because it was the right thing to do you made that Proclamation because somebody pushed you to take the stand that you took and then the Lord May vindicate it or you might you might you might have to go we don't know you know by faith they escaped the edge of the sword and by faith they also embrace the sword by faith so we see Caleb and Joshua are now highlighted they're brought out at kades Baria and at kades Baria testing time for all of Israel everybody was tested those that went those that didn't go you're sitting at home in your little tent like the other Hebrews and the brothers are coming back telling you this is what the Lord said this is what we saw and you're just a nobody you're sitting out there you didn't go you have to take the words from these brothers and these are main brothers that you have to listen to them and you're listening very intently what is this brother saying what is this brother saying and out of the whole group of them 10 of them made the same Proclamation and there there's two of these other crazies these two of these others that look odd that made a proclamation and you're a little brother man and you're a little sister whoever and you get to hear these brothers preach and then you got to make a decision too think about that they had to make a decision it was a Cades barer for everybody and we see the stand that was made we see the stand that they took and now the Lord begins to bless them but after the Lord got upset he proclaimed to them that you will not taste you would not see the land I'm going to uh cause you to die off in the wilderness for each day you were there I'm going to add a year to it so it's 40 Years of wandering because of your unbelief and your children will bear your iniquity you going to go go around and doing your thing whatever you do and I am done with you they were blessed but lost they had the blessing of the Lord upon them still but God was done with them you know what interesting as you take the scripture that the Lord just moves right on in numbers 14 is kades Baria they make um uh uh um they make their Pro they make their stand numbers 14:33 and he told them they'll Wonder for 40 years and then numbers 15 the Lord just goes on with normal conversation and telling them how to do their sacrifices and offerings very interesting study take some time and go read it it's like the Lord's anger was kindled I'm done with you 40 years you're going to go into the Wilderness okay now next when you give your offering your shiv offering and your he offering and your burn offering and your drink offering and your offerings with fire he begins to explain in detail to them all about the offerings it didn't stop him one bit he moved right on with what he needed to tell them and Numbers chapter 17 we see the rod of Aaron budding and blossoming that the Lord even chose Aaron out of all people He commands Moses to gather all the rods of the of the children the the leaders and the rod that I choose I'll do a miraculous sign so they put that rod in the sanctuary in in the presence of the pillar of fire and in 24 hours that Rod of Aaron bued it brought forth blossoms and a bushel of almonds overnight and the rod had the member's name on the Rod so we knew this was Aaron's Rod showing that that God is going to choose Aaron through that lineage I'm I'm choosing Aaron and he made it very clear amen amen now he had already declared you're goingon to be here for 40 years I brought you to the land the Wilderness was necessary but this Cades Baria is extra time because you disbelieve me and Aaron he chooses Numbers chapter 18 he's setting aside Aaron's sons Numbers Chapter 19 he's introducing the red heer and all of the types with that Numbers Chapter 20 our dear sister Miriam dies we lose one of our great matriarchs in the household of faith she's got to go it's part of the Great Purge not everybody's going to make it over there miam has to go Numbers chapter 20 Aaron has to go before he goes the Lord tells him Moses grab Aaron bring him before the congregation strip him of all of his Priestly garments he's got to go by the way of the Grave he's very serious so Aaron has to has to go Numbers Chapter 20 as well this is where we see Moses speaking to the Rock how many was here on Wednesday night how many you remember that message speak to the rock that came out of this is Israel while they're wandering now this is after Cades barnea this is their 40-year period of wondering and the Lord is still dealing with them and blessing them speak to the Rock Numbers chapter 20 verse 24 Aaron will die he won't see the land because of what he did at the Waters of miraba Numbers chapter 21 they there's a king a Canaanite King King Aid comes up against Israel now remember Israel messed up they they they they they went to Cades barer and they said we can't do it and the Lord was angry with him he says I'm done with you 40 years I'll leave you alone and here there is a here they are a king comes up against them and Israel the Bible says they vowed a vow Lord if you deliver deliver him in into our hand we will destroy all of his cities and the Bible says the Lord hearken to them very interesting I want you to take note of that the Lord hearkened unto them and delivered them they were blessed but they were lost Numbers chapter 21 veres 5 and six the people speak against God and Moses familiar familiar they've done it before they'll keep doing it he just delivered the king of the Canaanites into their hands a few verses later they're speaking against Moses and God again tell me what does this look like this is how people are this is how church members are just like this they can't stay steady but you need to build yourself up on your Most Holy Faith not some carnal Faith but your Most Holy Faith you're a Believer my sister brother you're a Believer God called you to the highest calling we can't walk around here all discouraged all the time we can't walk around complaining all the time always upset always offended you're a Believer you're not a chicken you're an eagle flap your wings come out of it snap out of it you're a Believer amen by the grace of God you know what Calvary means you know the price that was paid you experienced it how many you know what I'm talking about you you're going to come out of it how do I know you going to come out I know you're going to come out of it because you're a Believer yes yes can I get a positive testimony here this morning uh what I'm going through I'm coming out of it God's going to bring me out of this I can't stay like this God is going to raise me out of this because I am a Believer amen amen we have our bad days we have our discouraged moments We Fall Down but guess what we get back up again and we get back up again and we get back up again we keep getting up keep getting up keep getting up cuz I'm a Believer praise the Lord amen so he blessed them delivered them and then they spoke against him when he spoke against God he tells them to raise up a brass serpent this brass serpent now many people died and the Lord gives Divine Healing as part of their blessing if you look you live you talk about God's grace these are people who denied him on every level criticize him on every level and as soon as he gets sick he calls on God and God still heals him heals her what a mighty God we serve yes it's not by works it can't be by your works there is no works that you can work to get good enough but it is by his grace by his grace and his Mercy that he is shown to me amen and so the brass serpent we see that as St John chapter 3 as Moses lifted up the brass serpent so must the son of man be lifted up all these types through the scriptures that are being brought out while they are wandering another king comes against them in numbers 21 and the Lord delivers the amorites and gives them the victory over all these cities then in Numbers 22 we see this famous Prophet balam brother brandom said he had a true anointing one place he said he had a genuine anointing in another place he said he had the same anointing that Moses had upon on him this is balum he was gifted but his gift had a price tag on it and the influence of other men now remember balum made the right decision in the beginning but deep in his heart the prophet said he didn't really like those people anyways and the Lord knew in his heart he didn't like them so he tested them and just gave him another opportunity you said no but what if I give you a position you said no but what if we change you said no but and instead of staying with the original he got playing around and found the permissive will of God instead of the perfect will it's under this great understanding I'm not sure how many churches have this truth that the prophet brought out to us he said that that this is God's Will and man's will he's talking about the perfect will and the permissive will and how we can walk in his permissive will and God will permit you to do things but it's still not his perfect will how many of us are interested in his perfect will that's what we want his perfect will but it's a beautiful teaching lesson on how his permissive will can slide around and work around his perfect will my mother was a woman Pastor she did a good job as a raising us and she did a good job she was okay with preaching I guess and but she had a beautiful way of prayer she would come sing when she prays and sometimes when I'm really praying by myself I pray like my mama prays I can't get away from it okay and she was anointed and God used her and God blessed her and I will never take that away from my mother I believe I'll see her again but it was under the permissive will God perfect will is that I suffer not a woman to teach her Ur authority over a man that's a perfect will Amy simple mcferson wonderful women preacher wonderful gifting calling there in California tremendous Ministry helped hundreds and thousands of people her Ministry brought healing to many people but it was the permissive will how could this be because these these Dynamics work and because of the message it brings us these truths that even though a man is gifted or talented even though miracles signs and wonders will follow him you still have to get the okay from the word what did God's word say about it now that's a beautiful discipline that we all exercise because we're in the message but how many Pentecostal how many churches out there follow people just because they're gifted or talented but we know you got do more than have a gift you got to do more than heal the sick or have a talent you got to do more than just preach you got to live the life and then what did the word say about whatever you're trying to do amen someone so these are the wanderings of Israel so kades Baria they get thrown back 40 years into the Wilderness and balam appears now this blessed but being lost is how the prophet puts it here in this message can I read for you here what he says in the message turning northward paragraph number 33 just above paragraph number 33 they stayed on the mountain 40 years we stayed in our denominations 40 years fussing this way and that way you ever think what them people done out there for 40 years well sure God was with them he's been with us they've been out there 40 years and they raised children God prospered them had good crops they done a lot of good out there God blessed them and healed their sickness there wasn't a feeble one among them when they come out of the Wilderness but he let them stay right there till that old bunch of Fighters all died out that's just exactly what he's done today set us right down join the assemblies join the Church of God join this join that join join join oh until we sit here and raise children and bought Cadillacs and prospered in business and everything else you got any Cadillacs out there I like a good Cadillac they're nice but at the end of the 40 years it's up brother there's a new generation been raised up that's right there was a Joshua raised up one day he absolutely believed God's word every bit of the promise not only to take care of you and bless your business and so forth but there's more of it than that God's done the same thing today amen look at what he says in church choosing law for Grace hope we're not leaving these quotes out to the Pentecostals back there hope we look down right here did you ever think what they done oh God blessed them didn't he he said he did he they raised good crops they had good families they stayed there they were blessed and prospered why some of the Pentecostals are boys some of them why worth millions of dollars a lot of them sure God has prospered us I want you to think about this for a minute have you ever seen a Mormon church in a strip mall or like on the corner in the hood somewhere barely can pay their rent Windows broken out have you ever seen a Jehovah Witness church in the hood like that like you know like a storefront they don't make them do they no and and and it's almost it's almost like us in the message too how many storefront message churches do we know about in the US very few we used to be one so I can talk about them don't remember where y all remember where you came from now people hanging on the Windows stealing our air conditioning breaking into our cars need a flashlight at night but God has blessed the message people most of the message people after a generation or two you should have a few families like in this city if it started with 20 after 20 years there should be more than 20 families here wouldn't you say just by marriage and you know marriage and having kids it's going to grow and these are good people they pay their tithes they pay their bills they go to work they and they're blessed and they have the finest cars very few of us have to walk to church and if we did I would get a Tex say I ain't going to make it this week because my car is in the shop go catch the bus the bus what do you mean the bus the bus is for them y'all don't look at me like that I know who I'm talking to yes but the Lord has prospered us hasn't he what y'all gonna eat today let me think is chicken or steak shrimp or what what am we going to eat today oh I feel like well let see what I feel like you know many people don't have the option of what I feel like eat it's like you got to go eat what is available to eat and it used to be many of us have come through that many of our fathers or grandfathers come through that where going out to eat was a privilege huh but God has blessed us and we've been blessed financially we've been blessed physically we have we have health care we have access to clean drinking water we have air conditioning and electricity like 24 hours a day many parts of the of the world they have electricity for certain windows so many hours in the day how many know that's true oh my yes God has blessed us and prospered us and sometimes these blessings can blind us to the reality A a am I am I circumcised am I in the promised land am I actually getting the inheritance that God has for me and so these questions arise because of his love towards you the prophet of God continues in God's power to transform he says this paragraph number8 there's a line you can cross you know that now ministers both here and out in the telephone land where this broadcast is coming across Across the Nation do you realize that when you see it in the scriptures you won't do it God won't always oh you go on be blessed so was everyone of Israel they live right in the wilderness raised children crops and blessed in everything but every one of them eternally separated from God Jesus said so oh yes God will bless you right on but you're gone certainly that's what the Bible says now that's what he said notice you can cross a separating [Music] line let's go a little bit further here now so Jude is picking this he's picking up these brothers Kora Cain and Dayan and he is highlighting what they did and so going back to cor just for a moment what did Kora do Kora rose up in Numbers Chapter let me get the scripture here for you it's right after numbers 14 there I would ask you to find it for me but who said it numbers 33 let's try that sis Numbers Chapter 14 that sounds right thank you sis yes let's see here number 16 num numbers 14 is bringing in Kora but here number 16 is what I was looking for thank you now Kora the son of isar the son of Kath the son of Levi and Dayan and abam the sons of elab and an the son of pth Sons of Ruben took men and they rose up before Moses with certain of the children of Israel 250 princes of the assembly famous in the congregation men of renown and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and said unto them you take too much upon you seeing all the congregation Are Holy everyone of them and the Lord is among them wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the Lord now who is speaking here this is Kora Kora is the son of kohath he's a kohathite which also Moses is too interestingly enough Moses Aaron Miriam and Kora come out of the same lineage under Levi one of Levi's son under the coites and so this is Moses's first cousin he rises up against um Moses he grabs a group of Brethren with him and they were renowned men these are men amongst men and spoke against Moses and this is what they said to Moses they didn't have a problem with the pillar of fire they didn't have a problem with the signs wonders and miracles they didn't have a problem with the Vindication and the anointing that followed Moses's Ministry they had a problem with Moses and the problem that they had was that he's taking too much upon himself like you're the only you're the only important one Among Us I mean you put your pants on the same way we do you're just a brother just like anybody else why are you taking so much upon yourselves this is what this is this is what the problem that they had with Moses this arose up in Israel and the influence is coming great now remember they're under the wandering stage they 40 years of this we're going to be here for a minute for 40 years and here cor Rises up not not King Canaanites not the king from any other Nation it was my first cousin he rose up famous in the congregation and he tells Moses you put too much on yourself now if you know me and if you've been around a little bit you know how I you know I jab a little bit okay and I kind of tease a little bit all right it's either that or maybe I would lose my mind I don't know but I I'm you all know my you know I'm it's in the right spirit I sure hope so I trust you receive it that way amen and every now and then like last week I'll drop out there about the visions that people have a problem with you know I talk about the tent vision and I I bring up you know the white horse rider whatever it is the the third pool that people you see seems to have a an issue with and I do that on purpose not because I'm trying to lean one way or the other but what it is what's interesting to me is that people have a problem with statements that the prophet made and this is where this is what this is what I you know I kind of I I I I mess around a little bit it seems like I don't mean no harm but it's it's a valid it's a valid PR I mean I'm only mentioning a quote of the Prophet I'm not saying it's going to be this way or that way but to see the contortions on people in their Spirit when you bring up something that they're they're so dead set that you believe this or they believe that and they they won't even come around what the word said about it and be in agreement with that and so the reason is it's really it's really not whether he said a white horse or a blue horse it really don't matter what matters is what did he say that's the point that I try to get across is it in the Bible if it's in the Bible I am a believer in all of the Bible I'm not ashamed of any of it so there's no scripture I want to take out or no chapter I don't want to talk about it's all there The Good The Bad the stuff against me the stuff for me is it's in the Bible I'm with it and that's my attitude towards the message too and and these brothers here Kora specifically was not only a first cousin to Moses not only were they from the lineage of Levi remember Abraham Isaac Jacob Levi and Levi was given credit for paying tithes in the loin of his great great grandfather and under the same lineage was Kora was Moses was Aaron was Miriam as well they're under the same lineage what else the kohathites the gites and the muries were All Sons of Levi under the levitical order these were his sons and the Lord called them and separated them and made Levi his firstborn is that right Saints yes we brought it before you before it's in the scripture Levi shall be my first born and then so he gives them all specific duties the coites they were to to um they were to um to Camp their tent on the South Side I believe me get it here for you they were camped on the south the gersam and his family were camped in the west mirria Miri and his family were camped in the north his sons were camped in the north on the four sides of the Tabernacle and on the east side was Moses and Aaron that's the way they were structured and camped and each of these sons of Levi were given the duties and the instructions to handle the Tabernacle how we're going to move it because they had a lot of moving the tents the poles the the rods it wasn't just anybody get up and move it hey y'all let's get out of here can you help me today no it it was specific people that were given the order of moving this Tabernacle some of the stuff can be moved with the ox cart go God told Moses set up an oxcart the tents and all the poles and everything that's how these brothers are going to move this over here and these other ones are in charge of the curtains and the things that hang but but the coites are in charge of the most holy things they were in charge of the table of showbread the Ark of the Covenant the lampstands and everything that was in the mo the closest to where the anointing would come down in the holiest of holies these brothers were in charge of that this is their position and they couldn't move and go help the other Levites do their duties they all had their specific duties it was death if they did so read the scripture there in numbers he brings it out beautifully let me give you a few scriptures here numbers um chapter 4 veres 4-4 details this Numbers chapter 10 vers 21 I want you to read that and really internalize what it means 1 Chronicles chapter 9 for those of you that take notes go back and read this and how this order was established and God is a god of order yes he is absolutely the message came in a order the message came in a pools series of them first pool second pool third pool the the our our life is written out in ages and stages every seven years and then when you're 14 and then when you're 21 your life is written like that in stages and God built the universe in stages there's an order to it creation was built in stages there's an order to it and in the Tabernacle when Moses built this Tabernacle it was after the pattern that he saw In Heaven There is an order to it now tell me does God have a hand over your life if God has a hand over your life then there is a order to your life and somebody's in control of your life somebody is ordering your steps the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the Lord every step every place every test every trial every setback every discouragement is ordered can I get a witness here this morning yes so we see this number seven also brings in the mirites they had the four carts for The Oxen and you can see why David in doing God's service how maybe he he thought we can just get anybody to bring the ark so they went and got the ark and they threw it on a new cart well they it's okay to move other instruments on on a cart but this right here is the most holy thing and this has to be specifically carried on the shoulders of Brothers can I get a scripture there let's take Numbers Chapter 4 quickly I think that's what I want verses number one the Lord spake unto Moses Aaron saying take of the sum of the sons of coath from among the sons of Levi after their families by the house of their fathers 30 years old and upward even up to 50 years old enter into the ho host to do the work in the Tabernacle of the congregation this shall be the service of the sons of Kath in the Tabernacle of the congregation about the most holy things and so we see this is is bringing um this these are the most holy things look at number seven quickly verse six and Moses took the wagons and the oxin and gave them unto the Levites two wagons and four oxen he gave them to the sons of gersam according to their service four wagons eight ox and he gave Unto the Sons of myi marari I think I'm saying that right marari according unto their service under the hand of ithamar the son of Aaron the priest but Unto the Sons of Kath he gave none because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders we need some men we don't need a cart we don't need an oxen we need a shoulder we need your shoulder to bear this and you'll know you're carrying something and this is not just in any time or any day you just feel like it no you got to move you got to go get your shoulder ready so I you know I stayed up late last night I I don't know if I'm going to make it what what if the the sun said it didn't know if it was going to make it but the sun was put in direct order by his great Creator the Su win and he set in order perfectly at his post of Duty when at all times what about a s o n of God is he in order at some time or maybe time or halftime or part-time no it's at all time the Bible says you always be ready to give an answer you're a Believer you know even when you don't feel like it did you know you're still a Believer even when you're down on the ground that you're not less a Believer or more of a Believer you're just a believer but you're going to get up again aren't you because you're a Believer it's not a part-time position you're a believer and these are the sons of Levi so they had a tremendous uh calling there were the anointing was with them Lord had the Lord had placed them through their birth through their calling in life who they were and they were uh these are the ones that's giving Moses this problem he rose up against against them and told him do you take it all upon yourself aren't the whole congregation holy do those Spirits die are they still here today oh yeah they're still here Brothers we came to your church you mentioned brother brandham 10 times and you mentioned Jesus eight times did you say Amen anytime that would be my question to you did you take any notes down you know if you come in the right spirit in the right attitude you will receive whatever you're expecting I I like something brother globber said on Sunday night he said the prophet introduce this spiritual principle that you get what you expect I like that it's a spiritual principle that you actually get what you expect I love it I took that down I had to text I said I like that one yes it's a principle that he introduced to us you always get what you expect so let's deal with this Dayan and cor just for a moment moment the prophet picks it up and in the message why it had to be Shepherds he makes this statement here God bless you so much paragraph 153 now is they complain about God's provided way was the reason they died now closely don't miss these last few remarks they complain what made them die in the wilderness they complained about God's provided way by a Onan message a prophet a leadership of one man tell me when God ever use a group to lead you won't find it in the Bible one man the word came to Moses cor we all know that he got himself together and complained about God not being just to do a thing like that to make one man with the message he says we're all holy why can't we have a denomination why can't we have set up this and do this and do that God told Moses separate yourself from him I had enough of it and remember Jews speaks the same thing in the last days they perish in the gain saying of Kora look that word gain saying up and that word gain saying it it's used a couple of times in the Bible it is used as the contradiction it's also the same word as opposition and I believe it's in it's also used as Strife a couple of times but the main use for it was Rebellion many of the new translations translate that gain saying as Rebellion they rebelled against Moses he says God said separate yourself from from him I've had enough of it remember Jude speaks the same thing in the last days they perished in the game saying of Kora we also know what happened to Kora and the rest that question God's word and God's wisdom of that Onan leadership every one of them perished now we will notice God and the shepherd Prophet showing his future plans in the next sign voice now watch we see it there now let's watch it in the next sign notice he was sent to his brethren in slavery under bondage with the message of Deliverance with a god-given sign to prove his claims Israel went for his message they believed it every one of them but in the evening time they went for his miracles but in the evening time when they he gave his message it was different all that did not believe that message died that's that's right what was the message the message was of the coming Judgment at the evening at the evening time God went out through the camp of Israel to find if the people have believed a Shepherd prophet's message and all had not believed it perished oh my how many can say praise the Lord prophet of God continues in the message who do you say this is paragraph 128 oh my how many love the Lord today yes now the question come up in the wilderness here's where it brings see now I want you to watch my brethren now remember these people enjoyed them blessings they enjoyed the preaching of this Prophet this anointed one they believed him they followed him but there rose up in the wilderness one by the name of Dayan one by the name of Cor and they said this has got to be a Onan Affair Moses thinks he's the only one God's called that one man message they didn't want it no they didn't want it and God never did deal but with one person at a time it's always a Onan message can I say that again it's always always a one man not one man plus not one man and everybody else it's one man and those are the tapes that we promote these are the people that I this is who I'm going to quote from I'm not ashamed of it Saints and you shouldn't be ashamed of it either but there is a spirit that has a problem with it and that problem has grown over the years I've just been in for a little while 30 years or so I've seen things develop I've seen things grow and see directions that people take and look at the direction of the churches today just take your mind back 20 years or go back a little bit we did it a little bit for you last week talking about the first few brothers that fell away in the great apostasy and how others started to fall away and here we are the this this great a uh uh um situation arising where these ones that are now following you know they have a problem with the one man message now the pillar of fire the gifts the anointings the third pool Mana Mysteries revealed they preach that they quote it but the one man message they'll tell you you're trying to lift up a man it's too much brother brandom not enough Jesus that sounds good Jesus is our Lord and savior but who did Jesus send to us in this day he sent us a message and daythan and Kora had a problem with this and Jude picks it up and as Judas picking it up he goes through it he goes through Cain he goes through he goes through Kora he talks about they did it in Sodom and gomorah they did it in in Israel when they came out even the angels did it but you beloved but you beloved look at your neighbor and says God bless you beloved now a few weeks ago I told you to I called each other Ali rat or something like that but you know the point that I was making there's no rats in here we know that right and uh but but but you beloved look at him again says God bless you beloved it's easy to do if it's your husband or your wife isn't it verse 20 but ye beloved you chapter 1
