TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. [Music] Only believe. Only believe. [Music] Only believe [Music] all things are possible. Only believe. You may be seated. Brother Brennan, &gt;&gt; this being this way would answer exactly Enoch's sign in Egypt, the pyramid. Was it &gt;&gt; Enoch before the antivian destruction when justification was coming in he brought forth a sign and in this pyramid is seven steps going to the king's chamber once on the seventh step if you ever studied the dimensions of the pyramid what comes out to take the oncomer to introduce to the king what's station that is standing there and you'll see the day you're living in a pyramid. Now God made three Bibles. Now there's a pyramid teaching. It's nonsense. But there's a genuine pyramid. &gt;&gt; Notice now God first Bible he made three. They have to be everything in three. Jesus comes three times. Come once to redeem his bride, next time to get his bride, next time with his bride. See now notice how beautiful. See? And in this pyramid was seven steps. And then the king's chamber. And we're in the seventh church age. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Before the king takes his throne. And remember, the pyramid never did have a capstone on it. &gt;&gt; God's first Bible was in the skies, the zodiac. It starts off and runs every age. The first beginning of the zodiac is the virgin. That's how he come first. The last figure in the zodiac is Leo the lion, the second coming. Just before there is a cross fishes which is a cancer age that we're living in now there was a pyramid after that Enoch which testified exactly we wouldn't have time to go into it but someday with God's help I'll show you just exactly draws a dimension of the hour we're living see notice but this geographical measure now that we have whose dimensions are the same doesn't necessarily mean that it has to be a a cube notice this would answer Egypt's or the Enoch's sign in Egypt in the first time of purifying by its baptism of fire there will be volcanic such as this earth exploding and will push up a pyramidel like mountain see plenty of room to do it this whole thing will be changed the whole surface will be changed you got it &gt;&gt; you'll push up a pyramid like mountain this would exactly be with the word if it doesn't, which it will. Now notice, for in Isaiah 65:25, where we just read, it said, "They shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain." &gt;&gt; Sayaeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All my holy mountain. Remember, it's always a mountain. If the walls were straight up and down, the city could only be seen from the outside. From the inside, the throne could only be seen from the inside. But notice, it would be seen only from the inside. But now we see the promise of Isaiah 4. Let's just read it. Are you in a hurry? No. &gt;&gt; Don't don't be in a hurry now. We we we're in too too particular a thing now. too much too much of a a time that you must understand right here because I want to make this clear and then when we get back to it again I'll I'll show you then where we where we're talking about when our next study on this at another time. Oh, praise the Lord Jesus. Watch here how the words cannot fail. Now watch here in Isaiah I got wrote down here if I can find it again just a minute. Isaiah 4 and5. Now listen, he's talking of the coming of the Lord. how that women would be so immoral. &gt;&gt; Oh, he said seven women. Let's let's just read it. Let's hear it. And in that day, seven women shall take a hold of one man, saying we'll eat her own bread, wear our own apparel, only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach. &gt;&gt; That's the end time where we're living now. &gt;&gt; Marriage, divorce, and prostitution. What? &gt;&gt; In that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious. The fruit of the earth shall be excellent and commonly them that escaped of Israel. How that you escaped all that damnation. See, and it shall come to pass that he that is left in Zion, and he that's a remnant in Jerusalem shall uh let's see, in Jerusalem shall be called holy, even everyone that is written among the living in Jerusalem. See, wherein the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughter of Zion. Remember, that's always the bride. See, and shall have purified the blood of Jerusalem. That's the remnant of the Jews plus Lebrine. See, and in the midst thereof with the spirit of judgment. &gt;&gt; That's always God's judgment. When he makes his final judgment, calls you, justifies you, brings you to redemption, then his judgment breaks forth upon you, and the Holy Ghost and fire cleanses away the sin. Then you're his. Same thing he does to the earth when he purges it with fire and by the spirit of burning. Now look, listen. Are you ready? And the Lord will create upon every dwelling place of Mount Zion, and upon her assembly a cloud of smoke by day, and a shining of fire by night. For upon all the glory shall be a defense. The Lord in that day upon the pavement shall create a fire of light to burn upon the day. And it goes ahead and says it'll be a shelter of rest, a refuge. Notice making exactly the speaking of the Bible. Exactly. The walls are straight up and down. You couldn't see it. It has to lean all my holy mountains. He'll create this light upon this mountain and it shall be for defense. Oh, we sang that song. Oh, that city of Mount Zion. And as a pilgrim, yet I love it still. &gt;&gt; Now, through those ages when I reached that city on the hill, see, notice Mount Si was where God descended on top of it when he spoke to Israel in a pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; He descended on top of a mountain. &gt;&gt; Amen. Mount Sani on the mount of transfiguration when he declared, "This is my beloved son. Here you him." He descended in a pillar of light and shining brightness &gt;&gt; up on top of the mountain before Peter, James, and John. And in there, he was represented with both Moses and Elijah, the translated and the dead raised. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; The new city and the new earth, the new creation, the city on the hill with the throne in the top of it. The throne up here in the top and the dwellers all up and down on this mountain. And the wall that's around this had 12 foundations. And each one of them had the breast stone was in Aaron which represented the 12 tribes of Israel. And in the gates they had four gates that just exactly like the temple in the wilderness like the temp was in the wilderness. Notice each one had had the apostles three on each side. 12 apostles each and it was 144 cubics high. 144 cubics is exactly 216 ft in each one of those big stones. almost 20 foot tall the breastplate in that gate making up that wall that was around the city. Now it the city doesn't rest on top of the wall because the city 1500 miles cannot do that. It's the wall here that you enter in like the gates of the old Jerusalem. You entered through the wall into that and each one of these had the 12 foundations and each one had the amber and the different stones which represent the 12 tribes of Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the apostles each over that big one solid pearl gate set a name of an apostle. And didn't Jesus said, "You'll set on 12 thrones &gt;&gt; judgeing the 12 tribes of Israel. Who set at the gate to judge when they come into the city?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There you are. &gt;&gt; The kings of the earth entering into the city. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Comes before the apostolic judge. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Jesus promised. Oh my. On this throne, on top of it, 1,500 miles high, the whole world will see the light of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus sitting on the throne on top of the world, top of the church, top of Mount Zion, which is 1500 miles, half size in the United States, and raises plum up to you can see the world over 1,500 miles high. And all up and down the earth will be the redeemed. &gt;&gt; There will be the houses of pure gold. There will be avenues and parks and gardens. And the river of life coming trinkling out from the throne and running down two little chasms and over the terraces. And the tree of life will be blooming in every yard and bear its fruit 12 times a year, change fruit every month. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And the kings of the earth shall come into it and bring their honor. And the leaves are for the healing of the nations. When the kings are living in peace out there, will he go out? They'll pick a tree, a leaf off like that like the dove come back that the wrath of God have been settled and brought the holly leaf into the ark. So when the king leaves by bringing his glory into the bride's chamber here into the city, he'll hold a leaf to his neighbor, king, and we're in peace forever more. &gt;&gt; Healing all the nations. &gt;&gt; It's all settled. One time we fought for one another's bloods, brother. And we cherished and hollered and shot and burnt and everything. But now there's peace. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The healing, not disease. Healing is all done. &gt;&gt; Healing of the nations. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; City with the throne and top. Revelation 21:23. And they need no light for the lamb and the Lord God is the light &gt;&gt; thereof. Lord, &gt;&gt; see &gt;&gt; the Lord God is that pillar of fire that follow the children of Israel through the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he has ascended upon the throne in that perfect kingdom. When time the kingdom that Jesus is to surrender to the father that God might be all and in it all, Jesus sets upon his throne here as our chosen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the king is that light &gt;&gt; that will be on top of Mount Zion &gt;&gt; and his holy light will flood the entire city. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. 1,500 miles high and 1,500 mile square with the paradises of God built all through that city. &gt;&gt; Streets, avenues. Read your Revelations 21. See if it isn't right. See, they need no light there. For the lamb is like &gt;&gt; and on the throne can be seen sitting 1500 mile. It don't just run right straight up like this. It slants off like the pyramid. If it' be half of the distance in that' be about run up like this. You see from one city to the other. Now if you'll notice from one side of the city to the other. I could drop a little something here if you want me to. &gt;&gt; Did you notice a little group here? It's just about that part of circumference. It covers [Music] &gt;&gt; from Georgia, California to Saskatchewan &gt;&gt; from Kansas to the rockbound coast of Maine. &gt;&gt; That's what's gathered. &gt;&gt; That's why what's represented right here about 1500 miles square. Oh, they come from the east and west. &gt;&gt; They come from the land of fire &gt;&gt; to feast with our king to dine. What on man shall not live by bread alone by bread worthy? To dine as his guest. How blessed these pilgrims are in the world have said, I never seen people like him. &gt;&gt; Oh, beholding his hallowed face, &gt;&gt; a glow with light divine. Bless partakers of his grace as gems in his crown shall shine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus is coming soon. &gt;&gt; Our troubles will then be over. &gt;&gt; Oh, what if our Lord this moment should come? &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It won't be long. &gt;&gt; Everything's perfectly geographically. Sodom, the messengers, everything's sitting just exactly right. &gt;&gt; What does it mean? just ain't coming to this one little tabernacle 1,500 miles square from the same dimension. &gt;&gt; Why is it God so thought and cared so much about that little place of Palestine? &gt;&gt; Hey, well, it's just a little spot, &gt;&gt; but right in there is where the temple is at. &gt;&gt; That's where the new Jerusalem would break up right there. &gt;&gt; Olive, Mount of Olives shall cleave part to the right, left. Sure. When she pushes up from the beginning, &gt;&gt; not they say it's pushing apart like this, it's pushing up. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that day when he stands his holy feet upon the mountain, notice on his throne 1500 miles high. Remember, Satan tried to tempt him one time on top of a mountain. &gt;&gt; See, the new city has 12 foundations as through 12 patriarchs, 144 cubics being the breastplate of Aaron, 12 gates of pearl, 12 disciples name. Jesus stand the headstone on the throne &gt;&gt; when his saints has crowned him the king of kings &gt;&gt; the lord of lords &gt;&gt; and he's a headstone &gt;&gt; I don't have my pocket book with me but if you'll notice in your pocketbook if you have a $1 bill they have the seal of the United States a eagle on one end holding the spears, the uh coat of arms as it were. And on the other end, it's got the pyramid with an allseen eye on top of it. &gt;&gt; See, they didn't know what they were doing. And on there, it's wrote in Latin, and you'll find out it says it. This is the great seal. &gt;&gt; They didn't know what they were doing. &gt;&gt; Neither the cafe know he was prophesying. Right. &gt;&gt; There's the great seal. Here it is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, the city is not just a flat cube like this. See, but it leans up so it can be seen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And upon this holy mountain of the Lord, the Lord shall descend up on top of his mountain. &gt;&gt; There he is. &gt;&gt; That's the reason the capstone wasn't put on by Enoch. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; that's the reason the capstone has to come now. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the mount will be pushed up and it'll be the mount of the Lord. And in here will dwell the redeemed these avenues and big freeways as it was. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Parks and the river of life will draw run right through it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And every house will be made of transparent gold, and the streets will be made of gold. &gt;&gt; And the trees of life will be there, &gt;&gt; and will bear 12 manners of fruit, &gt;&gt; and the kings and the honored man of the earth shall bring their honor and glory into the gates, and the gates shall not be shut by night, because there is no night there. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory. &gt;&gt; In that city where the lamb is alive. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. in that city where there cometh no have a mansion over there that's free from toil and care. Oh, I'm going where that lamb is alive. &gt;&gt; Don't you see the the towns, the cities, the houses, the dwellings are are speaking of that right now. &gt;&gt; All these natural things are a shadow. Take a shadow at a distance like my pan. Before there can be a a positive or negative, there has to be a positive. And you see that shadow look like I got a dozen fingers. But then when you go to get it close together, it it focuses it down to one and then the shadow fades into the hand. That's a lot of time people think there's three or four gods. You're looking too far back in the early reformations. Come on down now. You find focus into there's one. &gt;&gt; Exactly. There's one bride. Not a dozen denominations, but one bride. &gt;&gt; That's the elected out of every out of the out of the earth that's been predestinated to this. That's right. The ones who can recognize their place in the kingdom on this throne. Look so high. The new city with the foundations, 12 gates, Jesus a headstone. The apostles judging the 12 tribes. The pyramid of Enoch casts no shadow, no time of the day. &gt;&gt; I've been in Egypt at the pyramids. It's so geographically fixed. And then the dimensions of this uh uh great geometrical uh figure that no matter where the sun is, there's never a shadow around the pyramid. See how it is? And there'll never be no night there. &gt;&gt; Him on top of the mountain floods it with his glory. &gt;&gt; His glory light will be there all the time. There will be no night there. Jesus the headstone. Now notice, so the redeemed shall walk in the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We sing now. We'll walk in the light. that beautiful light. There's something in us calling out pass from death and life. It's because that's waiting. &gt;&gt; See, that's what's the attribute what we feel truly. This is, are you ready? This is the city that Abraham was looking for. &gt;&gt; Being a prophet, he knowed that city was somewhere. The Bible said so. &gt;&gt; And he forsook the city he lived and he went over. Look where he went. exactly where it'll be. &gt;&gt; See, he was looking for a city whose builder and maker was God. &gt;&gt; See, being a prophetise, &gt;&gt; Jesus gone to prepare with divine hands, a divine city, divine architect, for a divine bought people, for predestinated people. He's gone to prepare. Abraham was looking for it &gt;&gt; and he professed that he was a pilgrim and a stranger. That's right. &gt;&gt; For he looked for a city whose builder and maker was God. That prophet knowing it was somewhere, John saw it coming down. &gt;&gt; But Abraham thought it must be on earth right then. Why? He met &gt;&gt; Melzdc. &gt;&gt; The king of it &gt;&gt; and gave him a tithe &gt;&gt; which had no father, no mother. &gt;&gt; He had no beginning of life or no ending of life. That's right. &gt;&gt; Abraham met him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And they took communion &gt;&gt; right on the literal spot where the city will be raised up. &gt;&gt; The holy mountain of the Lord where the redeemed will live. Oh my. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Hollywood. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] To God be the glory.

The trial of this world was getting closer. The pull I felt was more than I could bear. When I was on the verge of giving over, the strength within myself just wasn't there. But something keeps holding me. Every day I see he's helping me faithfully. to overcome my trials. He's guiding me constantly. He's given me victory. Aren't you thankful that he's a reality? &gt;&gt; Something keeps holding me. &gt;&gt; Satan made before me. his temptation of his desire to steal away my faith. But I have found inside the revelation. It's the strength I need to keep me in his grace. Something keeps holding me every day. I see. He's helping me faithfully to overcome my trials, guiding me constantly, giving me victory. [Music] He's a reality. Something keeps holding me. Something keeps holding me. Every day I see he's helping me faithfully to overcome my trials. He's guiding me constantly, [Music] giving me victory. [Music] And he's a reality. Something keeps holding me.

He abides. Oh hallelujah. He abide with me. I'm rejoicing that day as I walked in for the comfort of life with me. And once my heart was full of sin. Once I had no peace within until I heard how Jesus died upon the tree. Then I fell down at his feet. There came a peace so sweet. The comforter abides with me. Yes, he abides. He abides. Oh, hallelujah. divides with me. I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk the narrow way for the comfort of me.

This morning we had 10 children, nine Bibles, $1 in Sunday school offering. So nice to have good crowd this morning. In the way of our prayer requests, certainly want to remember the kings traveling and our precious Bobby WZ as he's going through this trial in his life. So remember the family this morning we have upcoming meetings early November. We want to hold those up before the Lord and Lord of direct brother Israel and all those that are planning to come. We'll keep brother Joe Yarbor held up in prayer and I don't see my Sarah this morning. So remember Sarah and Joseph and she's getting big pregnant and due any day and going to be Thursday if baby doesn't come then before then. So uphold them in prayer if you would. And if you've got a desire on your heart, let's bring that before Almighty God, our prayer answering Father this morning. Dear God, so good to be able to come before you in service this morning. No better place we could be, Lord. We've maybe allowed something to get between us during the week, but it's nice just to set it aside for the day, Lord, that you set aside for men and to be restful and to worship and honor of you, Lord. And we expect to hear from heaven this morning. We appreciate brother Israel's family and looking forward to the word that you'll bring through him today, God. And we bring you our cares, Lord, the toils of this life. We know they'll soon be over. We're making preparations, Lord, for your soon coming. We hold up our needs, Lord, Sarah and uh baby Joseph and Joseph, and just help them through this time. And for those missing among us, Lord, be with those. Our precious brother Joe Yarro, we miss him, Lord, out east. and just pray for him and his family and for the other knees. Lord, good to see sister Lori and the snows this morning and just continue to remember them. Brother Bobby, Lord, he's done so much for your people. And I'm not sure his time is over, Lord. We will leave that up to you, but we pray for him, Lord, for his faith and for the kings, Lord, traveling today. All things, Lord, we bring before you, asking for your perfect will to be done, Lord, as we worship you and this soon coming, Lord, our soon cominging King. We thank you for it. We thank you for the tithes and offerings we bring to you for the glory and honor of your kingdom. We love you and thank you in Jesus name. All God's people say, "Amen." Somebody could help. Joy has a song special. I She's going to need help getting the microphone set up and maybe they can help with that in a minute. But just want to sing that chorus before we do. Heavenly Father, I appreciate you. I was just thinking of that verse yesterday. God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and a love and a sound mind. And you know, that's something we had to say, Lord, thank you. This world is falling apart, but we have complete rest and comfort to give. And just tell him, Lord, thank you for all your goodness to us this morning. Oh heavenly father, I appreciate [Music] you. Heavenly Father, I appreciate you. I love you, adore you. I bow down before you. Heavenly Father, I appreciate. [Music] We sing that verse. It says, "Holy Spirit, you're a comfort to me. Holy Spirit, you're a comfort to me. Holy Spirit, you're a comfort to me. You lead me. You guide me. You're dwelling inside me. Holy Spirit, you're comfort. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be seated if you like. I wanted to share just a quick little testimony that's helped me so much. I went to Arkansas and I just had a lot of burdens and cares on my heart and in the middle of the night the Lord woke me up. I couldn't sleep and I thought, well, I'll just put on the Lifeline app and see what Brother Brandham's saying. And this this came on immediately when I put the the tape on. It says just like a baby. This is from letting off the pressure in 62 paragraph 69. It says just like a baby to lay your trust upon him and let him take all your cares for he cares for you. Don't try to do anything about it. He will do it already. He has promised he would do it. It's his business. As long as you're fooling with it, well then he can't have it. But when you turn it loose and let him have it, he will take care of it for you. Oh, I like that. What a perfect calmness that Christian ought to have. And this has just given me such a peace through the midst of our trials that he's with us and he cares about us. [Music] Here on the Potter's will, I find myself once more. My faults and my failures. Bring me here just like before. With strong and loving hands. The pressure is applied. Of times I tremble as he puts me through the fire. [Music] I'll trust the potter's hands.

Lord, we ask you to bless this portion of the service as we move forward in your word. Send your anointing upon us once again, Lord Jesus. Father, as we stand here, Lord, insufficient in ourselves, Lord, we claim you the sufficient one, the allsufficient one. You have exactly what we have need of. It is in you, Lord. And we pray that you'll bless us today. Bless every heart that's gathered here. Those that desire to be here and could not, the saints that are on the stream in Mesa, the different place. Oh God, bless every heart as we ask these things in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. So God bless each of you saints. So happy to be in the house of the Lord with you. We welcome each of you to the house of the Lord. Amen. Are you happy to be here? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Certainly welcome you. Um I have a gentleman in the back. His name is Omero. He's from Colombia and this is his first time here with us today. Um I'm going to ask him to stand. Stand up. And let's make him feel welcome. [Applause] He speaks Spanish, so brother Ezekiel will be interpreting for him. Of course, it's good to see Sister Lori uh here with us this morning and each of you. So happy to have all of you. Amen. And so we'd like to go right into the word this morning. We will be observing footwashing and communion tonight and every one is welcome to be a part of that. Amen. Also, um I think we had uh a work day on Saturday. I want to thank the people, the brethren and the sisters that came together to help get those things done that uh needed to get done. And then we'll have another one that will be posted. Um hope, you know, we need to have another workday before our meetings. Amen. So, let's all stand to our feet and we'll go right into the scripture in the New Testament. Romans chapter 11. Always good to have uh those that were traveling back, Brother John and uh the Smiths. I can't think of any uh ever who else was traveling. We're so happy to have you back. Good to see uh you and keep those that are traveling in prayer. Romans chapter 11 verses 1-5. I say then hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite of the seed of Abraham of the tribe of Benjamin. God hath not cast away his people which he forneew. What ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? How he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying, Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and dig down thine altars, and I am left alone, and they seek my life. But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself 7,000 men who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what we're going to talk just a little bit or maybe our title this morning is um a remnant according to election. May God bless you. You may be seated. We've been talking on this the little ones as we shared with you in the scriptures that these little ones are the unfortunate ones that Jesus was speaking of in um Matthew chapter 10 as he separated the sheep from the goats. He talked about how those that gave to the poor went to visit those in prison. those that were less fortunate that Jesus said in so much as you have done it unto the least of these you have done it unto me. So we took the least of these and we shared a few places out of the message where brother Vanam told us who these little ones are, who these least of these are. And he gives some examples of that pregnant lady that wanted to get her medication in the time of the depression and the drugist there told her they didn't have enough money was going to turn her away and something told his heart to know go and serve her and when he did he went to put it in her hands and he saw the face of our Lord Jesus saw his nail scarred hands and this was um a reminder of the scripture. When you've done this to the least of these, you have done it unto me. We also see where the great St. Martin in his great calling as a soldier, he cut half of his coat off to give it to a beggar one night, freezing cold. He wasn't even converted yet. And that night in a dream he saw the Lord standing in that old ragged coat that he given the beggar. And brother Adam says he knew then that God had called him. That was the that was his calling into the ministry and that he knew that if you do it to the least of these, you have done it unto me. And so we were talking about this and sharing a little bit of that, showing how Benjamin was the last son there with Jacob and the children of Israel. And Joseph was um um asking about him. Our Lord Jesus at the cross, I'm just giving a little background here. Our Lord Jesus at the cross, he says um all of you will be offended of me tonight because the scripture says smite the shepherd and the ski the sheep will scatter. He was quoting out of Zechariah 13. If you take that scripture, Zechariah 13, there's another portion that Jesus didn't mention. And he says, uh, smite the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered, but I will turn my hand upon the little ones. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam tell us those little ones are the Benjamin group, the 144,000 that are now in existence today. Now, carnal, coldminded people are not realizing what's going on with Israel is prophecy being fulfilled. God is not going to forget Israel. &gt;&gt; No. No. The nations will and they will turn against them. But there is a little group &gt;&gt; over there now and we call them the Benjamin group. They represent the 144,000. They will be revealed in their time. And so um and so just bringing that and and then moving forward into this election and the small group of people that maybe you don't know who they are, you don't see who they are, but there is an elected bride coming up even right now. One other type I'd like to share is the 11th hour worker. &gt;&gt; We are a type of the 11th hour worker. Who are they? they they showed up at the end of the day and the the hour uh the rate that they were getting paid per hour was the same as those that worked at the beginning of the day. And so the Lord poured upon them grace and favor and caught up all the lost time at the end of the day. Made a covenant with them and gave them everything that all the others had. And um we represent that group. &gt;&gt; We represent that 11th hour worker, that one that just barely made it in, &gt;&gt; but he still made it in. and he gets the same pay as the one who's been here all along. How many love that? &gt;&gt; You represent that group today. And so I wanted to go forward in that thinking and that thought that God has a church that's being raised up now as Ramsy's is growing, Moses was growing, as Satan's powers was growing, the power of God is growing in the church. And let me say this here, the church that many of us are looking for um you know maybe the internet version or um a uh social media platform that we'll all be able to look at it and say, "Oh, that's the church over there." No, I don't think that's I don't think that's scriptural what we should be looking for. But God's going to have a church and he does present tense have a church. Now, if you don't see one here in your city, that still doesn't take away from the word of God. &gt;&gt; God is going to have a church. And he has a church. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about young people, old people, preachers, pastors, teachers, mamas, daddies, the whole gamut. &gt;&gt; The newcomer, the old-timer, he's got a church without spot or wrinkle, &gt;&gt; and they're growing. If we don't see them, they're still there because the word of God said that. So, here in our scripture in Romans chapter 11, as I said, I love the Old Testament and the Apostle Paul is pulling his text or he's quoting out of First Kings 19. If we'll turn there quickly, we'll speak on this remnant just for a moment. Here is the prophet Elijah. First Kings 19. He had a great outpouring of a manifestation where the Lord proved that he was right. In first kings chapter 18, you remember the story when the false prophets rose up against this true prophet Ahab and his team Jezebel his wife. They were in the politics. They had the power. They had everything going for them. And a and Elijah called for a showdown. Can I get a witness? &gt;&gt; Amen. He um first closes up the heavens and then he opens them back up again three years later. Then the Lord tells him to go see Elijah. He goes and sees him and Elijah comes and all the 400 prophets come. This is representing Israel. We're not talking about the heathens and the false nations out there. We're talking about all Hebrews. talking about all of the children of Jehovah, the most the most high God. And so there's a showdown in that camp. Ahab, which is a king of Israel after the lineage of David, but yet he was a wicked man. He marries an unbeliever. And this unbeliever was a strong, influential woman by the name of Jezebel. Please don't name your daughter Jezebel. Don't name anything you have Jezebel because it represents a character in the Bible. And this Jezebel wooed and pushed and twisted and influenced Ahab to do more wicked than all the kings before him. He was married to a woman that influenced him, that turned him to do things that were not right. You might think you're strong and you might think you have the power to overcome influences, but if you're a man or a woman, you all are being influenced by something or somebody. &gt;&gt; Every one of us are being influenced. That's what advertising is all about. This is what you wanting to do things a certain way is all about is because you're being influenced. It's not all bad and it's not all good. But this was a bad influence in this king's life. So the conflict was on. Elijah comes up. He's standing alone by himself and he's standing against 450 prophets and he has to manifest his ministry before them. As we know the story, the fire comes down. God vindicates him and kills those prophets. Then Elijah gets his sword and goes and slays all of them and he leaves. Now we get to First Kings 19. He's now leaving from this great uh Mount Carmel showdown. It was a great and tremendous victory. He said, 'If God be God, serve God. If Baal be God, serve Baal. And the God that answers by fire will vindicate who is telling the truth or not. And God answered by fire. &gt;&gt; He gave those prophets an opportunity to show that what they're saying, what they were saying was true. And they cut themselves and they waited and they prayed and they called on God. And then Elijah came out and mocked them a little bit. He says, "Where's your God at?" Maybe he's on vacation. Maybe he's sleeping. Maybe he can't hear. Cry a little louder. So they cry louder until the evening time. No fire, no vindication, no nothing. And then it was Elijah's turn. Standing before all of Israel to vindicate who was right and who was wrong. See, words are just that. They're just words. But when God vindicates the words, then you have a way now that you can choose to go on the Lord's side or not. &gt;&gt; I will agree. All of the churches in the city, many churches, organizations, and denominations have their doors open and they all have something to say that we're right. We're better than them. They did this wrong. And we all have something to say. But the time is coming where God is going to prove who is right. And this was that time. We call it a showdown, a great showdown. So Elijah comes up there with his humble ministry. He comes down and he begins to repair the altar of the Lord. He puts the stones in place. He gets the sacrifice, places it in place, pours water on the sacrifices. Then he comes to Jehovah and he prays a simple prayer. He says, "Lord, I've done all this at your command. &gt;&gt; Now prove and show today who is God." And then the fire from heaven came down, &gt;&gt; consumed the sacrifice, licked up all the water. It was a great victory. And God proved that Elijah was right. &gt;&gt; Now, here's the danger here. When you prove or God vindicates that you're right, remember it's not over yet. We call that a victory. And after a victory, Satan will always come and challenge you. &gt;&gt; So this woman threatens Elijah. And in her threat, she tells her husband Ahab and goes tells his wife. This is what Elijah did is she threatened his life. And this great and mighty prophet who just went through this great victory and God vindicated who he was. He takes off running and he's running for his life. And we find him here in First Kings 19. He goes a day's journey into the wilderness and he came and sat down under a juniper tree. Verse four. And he requested for himself that he might die and said, "It is it is enough now, oh Lord, take away my life, for I am not better than my fathers." &gt;&gt; Now, is this a man of God or not? Is this a true Christian, a true believer or not? &gt;&gt; This is a true believer. This is a true man of God that got to a place where he felt so under the pressure and his nerves had got so bad that he asked God to take his life. He said, "I'm not better than the prophets that went before me." Brother Bham deals with this juniper tree experience and he breaks this message out, this um first kings chapter 19 into three places. It's the Mount Carmel showdown. There is the juniper tree and then there is coming into the cave. Now, we know that this um juniper tree, Elijah's alone. He's in the wilderness by himself. Sometimes we got to get alone. Um, you can't be um with everybody all the time and still have a spiritual walk with the Lord. You have to take time alone. I know a lot of us are very social social people. We like talking to people, like people over, coming together, riding with them, group text, group email, group uh fellowships and stuff. But every believer needs to find a place where they can get alone with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Jesus did it. He &gt;&gt; called us to do it as well. &gt;&gt; You cannot be successful as a believer today if you don't have those times where you get alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With God by yourself for yourself. It's better for your mind. It's better for your strength. It can recalibrate what you're doing in your life. You can take inventory without the outside voices &gt;&gt; and then influences going on. And I would challenge you today to find a place in the wilderness where you can get alone. I tell you, it's not easy. &gt;&gt; It really takes effort to go find a place to get alone with God. And this is Elijah. He's here. He's under the juniper tree and under this juniper tree begins to pour out his heart. This man actually wants God to take his life. I don't know if you ever got in a situation where you felt like you wanted God to take your life. I wonder if you've ever got in a situation where you felt like your life was not even worth that. You shouldn't even be here. You wanted to move out. You wanted to get away. He wanted to leave the earth because the pressures are too great. This is what happens to spiritual people. This happens to people that are God called that are absolutely God's elected go through these times &gt;&gt; where they just want to quit. &gt;&gt; Like Elijah says, it is enough. &gt;&gt; How many of you ever got to that point where you said, "It's enough." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've reached my limit. It's enough. I quit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I quit. I quit. This is where Elijah is. And he's calling out to God at this time. So, he begins to pray and then the Lord puts him to sleep. He lays him to sleep. He gives him a cake and then puts him back to sleep again. As he's sleeping, the angel of the Lord touches him a second time, raises him up, tells him to rise and eat, and puts him back to sleep again. And so, here is the angel and the Lord calling for Elijah to get some rest, to get some sleep. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; To stop running all the time. As I shared with the church on Thursday, I just had to made a cons conscious decision to stop eating in my truck, driving everywhere I go. I'm getting on the freeway, eating a meal there, getting on going over here while in between that eating. It's like I mean, what how crazy is that? I mean, how where where am I going? Stop &gt;&gt; and pray for the food properly and then enjoy it. How you going to be eating a meal on the freeway going 55, 65, 75, getting off trying to open up the ketchup, trying to put the salsa on the little burrito or whatever? You got a big old mess going. What you doing? Are you driving or are you eating? Is this a supper? Is this supper time? What's going on? The the And that's not for everybody. That's for me. I said, you know what? I need to stop. I need to pull over. I need to thank the Lord for this meal &gt;&gt; and enjoy it because wherever I'm going, he's already there. &gt;&gt; He's got time in his hand. &gt;&gt; He can slow the day down or he can speed the day up for you. &gt;&gt; He's in control &gt;&gt; of every hour of the day. and you think your rushing is going to get things done better. &gt;&gt; It'd be better to be sound in your spirit with the Holy Spirit leading you and guiding you &gt;&gt; than running up and down trying to manipulate the hours in the day &gt;&gt; and then at the end of the day you throw together some prayer because it's what you need to do. But this rest, the the the Lord calls for it. And I think that as brother Bham explains, this juniper tree place is a place for believers to regroup and find themselves again. I'm going read a few quotations for you here in just a moment. Let me take this here as a prophet is talking about this juniper tree. Okay. What does thou hear 1959 paragraph 50? Now our story goes in three different places. One Mount Carmel, the next under the juniper tree. The third place God meets him is he's in a cave. It's very strange. Pastor here knows and other ministers, watch after your Mount Carmel, you're going to have a juniper tree. Whenever a man has a blessing and the power of God pours down and does something for you, look out. Satan is on the track. Just remember the next day, that Monday after a good day on Sunday is going to be a hard thing &gt;&gt; because he's going to do everything he can &gt;&gt; to knock that confidence out of you &gt;&gt; that the Holy Spirit instilled in you the day before. So the Holy Spirit instills things in you, gives you beautiful things, victories, anointings, and then Satan comes afterwards and deals with you. Paragraph 58, same message. Brother Brandham says this here, "And I tell you, Elijah, his nerves on the edge." Anyhow, I always felt sorry for him. His nerves was about ready to break. Anyhow, and that great pound from Jezebel finished the stroke. Then he run and went into the wilderness and laid under the juniper tree. Oh, that experience of the juniper tree. There's many of us find ourselves under the juniper tree. I get myself under there many times to a place that you don't know what to do. You're frustrated. I think frustrated is the word flustered. and then frustrated. And brother Random calls it frustrated. Frankly, I'm right under it now and wondering, "Oh, God, what would you have me do?" How many's ever been there before? &gt;&gt; How many's there right now? &gt;&gt; You know, people under the juniper tree is like Elijah. They like to sleep. &gt;&gt; I preach to more tired people than anybody in the world. People is so tired. They they they're so mentally strained until they're filling the insane institutions in the hospitals everywhere. They're went in such nervous conditions till they don't know what they do believe and what they want. They're just laying there. They don't know what to do. Such a sad sight. And listen here. Uh uh uh um it's such a sad sight. And listen here, my brother. You can't drink it off. You can't shout it off. Neither can you play cards till it's dawn. You could take a thousand siestas and try to sleep it off. You can't do it. All of our little remedies, only thing it does is help the symptoms. We got to have a cure for the disease. All the psychiatrists in the world cannot cure it. &gt;&gt; It only helps the symptoms. The cure is the blood of Jesus Christ. not take a rest at the seashore, not go get an anthem, a choir to sing anthems. That's what we're trying to do today is sing it off. &gt;&gt; Brother Bham continues paragraph 63. There he laid under the juniper tree. He didn't know what to do. His nerves was broke. He was shaking. He was crying, no doubt. And he was in a terrible condition. Brother Bannam continues on under this juniper tree. It says, "Sometimes you feel like, as I did one time, put a pistol against my head to commit suicide, but I couldn't do it. I took my glove off to lay it on high voltage line where I was working, but I couldn't do it. Something still held." &gt;&gt; The same God that was with Elijah, the same God today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He seen me under the juniper tree. My wife and baby laying yonder in the grave. My daddy, my brother, and all. I was just about gone myself. I've laid under the juniper tree. It's hard. And I've got to a place I was so besides myself. I tried to make a gun and shoot my brains out. It wouldn't do it. See, there's work yet to be done. Something has to be done. God wasn't God wasn't finished. He'll always take care of you. poor, tired, weary servant, servant. He saw him. He knowed where he was. He knows where you are tonight. &gt;&gt; You may be under a juniper tree, everything gone. But remember, he knows where you're at. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? &gt;&gt; You get those gloomy times. You don't want to go forward. You don't know what to do. You're nervous. You're tired. just mentally tired. You slept all night and you wake up, you're still tired at the task at hand. You're tired to move forward. You're tired and you're under a juniper tree. I hope you get this message today. &gt;&gt; I hope you know where your tiredness is coming from. Hope you know where that glooiness is coming from. &gt;&gt; It happens to the prophets. It happens to God's people. Amen. &gt;&gt; It happens to all of us. And when it happens to us, we need a juniper tree. &gt;&gt; We need a juniper tree. &gt;&gt; We need to rest. &gt;&gt; We need to find a place alone with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Take one day off. &gt;&gt; Just take it off &gt;&gt; and go meet with the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm tired. I don't know which way to go. I'm trying to make ends meet. I'm trying to make it work. I'm trying to make everybody happy and nobody's happy. I don't know what to do. Lord, &gt;&gt; go find a juniper tree. &gt;&gt; Go take a day journey and rest a while. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every believer needs to rest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go rest. Take some time. Get some rest. Matthew 6:31 says, "And he said unto them, come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a while. For there were many coming and going," and they had no leisure so much as to eat. Who Who is he talking about? Is he reading my emails? coming and going, no leisure. What did Jesus tell them? Huh? What did he tell them? Where am I this morning? What did he tell him? Let's read it again. Mark 11:6:31. And he said unto them, can we get it on the screen for me, please? Thank you. He said unto them, let's all read together so we're all on the same page. All right. And he said unto them, &gt;&gt; "Come yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a while." So what did he tell him to do? &gt;&gt; Go rest a while. For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat. And they departed into a desert place by a ship with who? &gt;&gt; Privately. You know how some people always want to be in contact with you. Want to know where you're at, what you're doing, where you at, what you're doing. You know, sometimes you just got to get alone. &gt;&gt; Huh? Look at somebody and tell them, get alone. &gt;&gt; Look at your neighbor and tell them get some rest. Jesus said it. You're running on fumes. You need to fill up. And your fill up doesn't come from other people. Your fill up doesn't come from fellowships and getting with other people. Those are things are great. They have their place. They have God gives us brothers and sisters to talk with and to fellowship with. But if our Christian experience is based on our friends around us and people always assuring us and always patting us on the back and always there for us, you know, that's not going to last. &gt;&gt; You've got to get alone with the invisible one. &gt;&gt; The one who settles things in your mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Settles things down in your heart and in your spirit &gt;&gt; where he can speak to you. Matthewap 11 verse 28. Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I'm weak and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light. Luke 5:16, he withdrew himself into the wilderness and prayed. I like that. Matthew chapter 14 verse 13. When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by a ship into a desert place apart. And when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities. This is after um John the Baptist was was killed, was murdered. Matthew 14:23. And when he had sent the multitude away, he went up into the mountain apart to pray. And when the evening was come, he was there alone. This is our Lord Jesus. Matthew 14:23. He was there alone. Mark 1:35 says, "And in the morning," I want us to get this one here, "Rising up a great while before day, he went out and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed." This is our Lord Jesus, the God of glory. He gets up early in the morning. We'll get up early in the morning for a men's trip. We'll get up early in the morning to catch our flight and we won't be late. We'll get to two hours. They said to be there before your We'll get up early in the morning to go to work because those are appointments that are set. I got to catch this flight. I got to be with this, you know, this group, this team. I got to be at work early. But here is an appointment where Jesus says that where Jesus gets up early in the morning and he withdraws himself apart to in a solitary place. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in the morning, Mark 135, you all have it there? It's on the screen. Little quiet this morning. It's okay. And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed. And it came to pass, Luke 6:12. And it came to pass in those days that he went out into a mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to God. Who are we talking about? Someone more spiritual than all of us. Think of that. When the weakest Christian prays, it means something. Amen. &gt;&gt; Here's the founder of the church, the leader of all eternity, the king of glory in flesh. And while he was here, he developed that discipline of getting up early. Lord, help me. &gt;&gt; Lord, help us &gt;&gt; to get up early. &gt;&gt; We'll get up early to babysit our children. We'll get up early to dispense family times because of an appointment. But how about getting up early and finding a solitary place and there pray &gt;&gt; Lord help us. I pray &gt;&gt; Luke 9:28 came to pass about 8 days after these things he took Peter, John, and James and went up into a mountain to not gossip but to pray. &gt;&gt; Now, when you get out into these solid solitary places, you're not thinking about your work. You're not thinking about some advantage you can take because you're already up anyways. You're thinking about the Lord. You're coming to this place for prayer. And this is where he begins to unfold himself to you. It's beautiful. Just even meditating on the Lord, &gt;&gt; getting away one afternoon. Sometimes you take a drive. Sometime you just take a drive. You just get out. You get out. Look in the mountains. Let the mountains preach to you. Look at the trees. Look at nature. Just get out apart and begin to think about the Lord &gt;&gt; and where you are in your life and where you're going and let the Holy Spirit begin to deal with you. You can't do that when you're connected all the time. You got to disconnect and get into this juniper tree. Let me take one more on the juniper tree here. What the prophet of God says about this juniper tree? And what hearest thou Elijah? 1959 paragraph number 37. So what happened? He called them together and the God of heaven answered in a supernatural sign to Israel that he was still the God that could answer by fire. He did just what he always did. Answered prayer, kept his word. And after all this, still it wasn't sufficient. Little and little old Elijah, he didn't know what to do. So he run to the juniper tree. I'm glad that there is a juniper tree. All God's people needs to go to that juniper tree. &gt;&gt; It's a place where he was so discouraged. He didn't know what to do. So he ran out to himself and got under the juniper tree. Many of us feel like going there. And today when we see the institutions filled with people of God, nervous breakdowns, tensions, oh, it makes us all want to run to the juniper tree. I think if we could express it like the old colored lady said down south when she had been hit by an automobile, a car had struck her and they asked her if she wanted to sue for damages. She said, "Lordy, no, child. I don't need damage. I need repair." &gt;&gt; And I think that's about the way the church needs tonight is repair. a place under the juniper tree so we can be alone. This is where the repair happens is under the juniper tree. I thank God there is one. &gt;&gt; It's a juniper tree. I thank God there's a place that believers can go there when they're discouraged. How many's ever been discouraged? Some of you are discouraged now. Some of us has discouraging aspects of our life. All of us go through them. And this juniper tree is for that. &gt;&gt; But you got to go there alone. &gt;&gt; You don't go there with a group. You go there by yourself and you get alone with God &gt;&gt; and you call out to God and you open up your heart. &gt;&gt; Elijah was there. He was discouraged. This woman's trying to take his life and he's like, "I'm no better than the men that went before me. Lord, take my life. He was discouraged. So we see after the juniper tree, the angel puts him to sleep there, feeds him a cake, wake puts him back to sleep, wakes him up, does it twice, and then sends him on a journey, a very long journey, by the way, 40 days and nights he went into the strength because he had to go from Beerseba all the way to Horeb. And we know that Horeb is Mount Cyani as well. The scriptures use the the names are interchangeable. Cyani and Horeb. We heard it in the Sunday school this morning. This great mountain where God dwells. And this is where Elijah is now going to the mountain. He leaves from the great victory. Then he's under the juniper tree about taking his own life and wanting to die. And then the angel puts him to sleep. He gets his rest. He gets his repair. And he feeds him and tells him, "You got a long journey ahead." And he sends him on a journey in strength to go to Mount Hor. Where's Mount Horb? Where is Mount Cyani? Well, that's where Moses went. That's where the Ten Commandments came down. This is a be a special place that God has shown himself to be there. And in those on this mountain side, in this mountain range, there was a cave. And in this cave, oh my, he got into this cave alone, didn't he? And what happened in the cave? He started to uh uh uh call out to the Lord this prayer in Romans 11. They've killed all the prophets, Lord. They've slain your servants. They didn't hear what I said. And I'm the only one left. I'm so discouraged. I preach exactly what you told me to say. You have vindicate me over and over in all these years. And I get out here and you vindicate me and still there's not even I'm the only one left in all of Israel. He didn't know that there was a remnant there. Amen. Can I keep going for a few more moments? &gt;&gt; He didn't know that there was a remnant there. And that remnant were the 7,000. &gt;&gt; This is beautiful. I love this &gt;&gt; because just because Elijah didn't know them, it don't mean that God didn't know them. &gt;&gt; And just because the world don't know who these people are, God knows exactly who these people are. And when he got up in the cave and God began re to reveal the opening of the word, he says, "Elijah, you're not alone. &gt;&gt; I got 7,000. &gt;&gt; 7,000. I've numbered them. They have never bowed their knee. They never kiss bell. I got them in my hand. They're mine. Elijah, &gt;&gt; it's beautiful. &gt;&gt; It's beautiful. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; That hidden church, that secret church, &gt;&gt; that little neighborhood church, that little mama, that little daddy that's got the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; that true believer. God knows who they are. &gt;&gt; The messenger of the age didn't even know who he who they were. &gt;&gt; He just had this great thing. He knows Israel. He knows them. He had this great victory, this great outpouring. And he's praying to the Lord. He says, "I am the only one left. I want to leave." Oh, Elijah, don't think like that. I got 7,000. How many, Lord? 7,000. &gt;&gt; Oh, really? Yes, I got them. They have not bowed their knees. &gt;&gt; Who are these 7,000? Can we get into it? Will you say amen if we do? &gt;&gt; Oh my. Who are these 7,000? Let's talk about him just a little bit. Okay. Bless his wonderful name. &gt;&gt; So Elijah now is in prayer. He's in his cave. He's in a holy mountain spot that the Lord has dealt with great men like Moses up there in this cave. And here the prophet of God says in the forgotten biatitude 1961, he says this here quickly. He says, "But God said, "No, I got 7,000 more that had never bowed their knee to Balum yet." See? See? But I that's all right, Elijah. You're doing a great work, but I still got another bunch you see that you don't know yet. But take my life. I'm not more than my father's. But the prophets was and that's Elijah. But madam continues on says in the message of true sign that's overlook. He says Jehovah does care. It's got to be his word. And Elijah stood boldly on that word with thus said the Lord. God gave him a little secret. One day, he said, "I got 7,000 Elijah that you're a witness to &gt;&gt; out here." They haven't got the nerve enough to come out and claim it. They're hiding around in bushes, but yet in their heart, they're my servants. They haven't bowed a knee to Balum. They're afraid to do it. But I'm giving you a sign and you are a sign. Stand out there and stand on my word. I'll take care of you. Give them a sign. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; So these 7,000, they were there, weren't they? &gt;&gt; Didn't have the courage yet, but in their heart, they were true believers, hiding in bushes, &gt;&gt; hiding around Circle K, maybe &gt;&gt; hiding in the hood, &gt;&gt; hiding on the college campus. There's more believers out there than perhaps you realize. &gt;&gt; You think everybody that believes is here. There's some believers in God's economy. &gt;&gt; And God knows exactly you was one of them. One day you was a believer. &gt;&gt; Always a believer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Out there in the world doing whatever you were doing, but in your heart, you wanted something genuine. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Didn't Elijah find you? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The message people don't know who you are. &gt;&gt; Message folks that are in, they don't know what's going on on the south side or the north side or in the prisons. They don't know. They think everybody that's we're the only ones. Is that how we think? Like the brother I think it's Aaron Garrett gives that it's kind of a humor. He says that in heaven there was these different groups, the Baptists over there praising the Lord, other Christians praising the Lord and and there was another little spot. He he looked in there and and these people over there praising the Lord and he said, "Who is that? Those are the message people, but sh they think they're the only ones here." I thought that was kind of comical, kind of funny because sometimes we think we're the only one that God loves. But I'm so glad &gt;&gt; that he loves my family. He loves my loved ones. He loves the one that are not walking in the word. He knows who they are and is not my business or Elijah's business. God opened up the seal and showed them I got 7,000 &gt;&gt; that never bowed their knee. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's some believers out there. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my. Prophet of God continues in the message the fourth seal. Now this one you have to say amen to. All right. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 366. He says, "Look, Elijah never knew even one of them was that way. He thought he was the only one saved until God opened one of the seals and showed him in the mystery in the book." Amen. &gt;&gt; That he had 700 that never bowed down to them creeds that they had &gt;&gt; when God opened his book to Elijah. Now wait a minute, son. I got 700 that's tucked around out there that's got their name on the book since the foundation of the world. They're mine. God opened the seals. That's the reason I think John was doing a lot of shouting the other night. &gt;&gt; He must have seen his name on there. You see, &gt;&gt; one day God opened. Elijah had preached. He had done everything. Preached his heart out. He done everything he could and still they're just hottie. Called him everything. Said, "You're the cause of all of this. You're the spiritualist. You're the one who makes all this trouble to come. You're guilty." And everything like that. He said everything. They said everything to him. Jezebel threatened to cut his head off. Everything else, that's right. Everybody was against him. And then he said, "Lord, after I've done that, all you told me to do, I've stayed exactly with your word. When you told me anything, I was fearless. I walked right into the king's face and everything else and told them, "Thus sayeth the Lord, you haven't told me a thing. I have not told them one thing." But what happened? Now here I am, the only one left. out of the whole bunch, I'm the only one left and they're trying to kill me. God said, I'm going to open up one of the seals and show you something. &gt;&gt; He says, you know, I got 700 back there that ain't never bowed to me. &gt;&gt; Join any of them creeds yet denomination? There are 700 of them ready for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Now, who's he talking about? Elijah in the Old Testament or Elijah who had the seven seals &gt;&gt; who's going in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Which Elijah is he talking about saints? &gt;&gt; Ah yes I have 700 through the scripture I have 700 prepared names. Yet out of this generation 700 of them they have not bowed their knees to any. If I say it in this day, religious organizations see come see and brother Bham continues on. So here's a very nice thing. So &gt;&gt; I think if you're counting that message, he says 700. I think he said it seven times. So maybe it's 700. Maybe there's a spiritual and I've heard that that that uh version too. And so which is it 700 or 7,000? Huh? &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Thank you, Lord." &gt;&gt; Huh? Is it 700 or 7,000? &gt;&gt; Does it really matter? &gt;&gt; Long as you're one of the number. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? So whether whether it's 7,500 I heard a number there's 500 in the bride elected and it just so happens you know we took up most of those numbers here in the US. Uh too bad for the rest of the nations that are going in the rapture. You know what kind of what kind of people are so interested in how many are actually going in the rapture? It's like, you know, you've been invited to get into this great uh uh building for whatever show and you get in there and it says they have seats for so many people. Okay, fine. Great. You got a seat for me? Yeah. Okay, I'm good. That's it. &gt;&gt; Y'all got a seat for me and my family? Oh, absolut Oh, great. It doesn't matter how many other seats are there long as there's a seat there for me. And if I am going in the rapture, that's all that counts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we might argue if it's 700 because he said it seven times. Now remember spiritual catch it &gt;&gt; right even though he corrected it. Oh don't no don't don't take that. You got to take what he you know how they do. I know how they do. So you just got to stay with the what what he said and what difference does it make at the end of the day? Whatever doctrine you're following, so what what next? What is it going to do for you? &gt;&gt; Is it causing you to draw closer to him? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Yes. So he opens up one of the seals. Another place he says he shows Elijah a secret that there was this remnant there. the secret that there were 7,000 that he didn't even know about. I think that's beautiful. I love it. In flashing red lights of the sign of his coming, the prophet of God says this here. Jezebel refused to hear the word of the Lord. She wouldn't want to call that old fuzzy looking preacher Elijah her pastor. But he was her pastor anyhow, right? God sent him and he bellowed out his message. Though uneducated, they don't know where he come from or where he went to. He came on the scene with the word of the Lord. He sent his message that he preached. He condemned everything that was called sin that the modern Jezebel had switched and bewitched the people under the witchcraft of her powers until the whole nation was corrupted. And Elijah stood alone out there on the mountain. God said, "Elijah, don't think that. I've got 7,000 down there." That's honest in heart. Yet, that's his second pool. And the third one went back for them. &gt;&gt; Oh, nice. Nice. &gt;&gt; Nice. The second pool showed who the 7,000 were. The third pool went back to get them. the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. Is that what you trying to say? I ain't trying to say nothing. I'm trying to say amen. That's what I'm trying to say to the word. His third pool went back and got, you know, Moses and Elijah are coming back. &gt;&gt; Do you know that? &gt;&gt; Revelations 11 says that &gt;&gt; they come back. Did you know they were on Mount Transfiguration? Did you know they both went to the same Mount Horeb on on this Mount Horeb on Mount Si? That's where God appeared to Moses in the burning bush. Exodus 3. It's also where Moses received the Ten Commandments in Deuteronomy 5. And then we here we see that Elijah now is getting a revelation of the 7,000 in the cave on the same mountain. Now, God is into mountains. &gt;&gt; And it just so happens in our city, we have a beautiful one. And I'm not talking about a mountain or twin peaks or the sovere. I ain't talking about none of them mountain. They're beautiful. They're nice. But that's not the mountain that's on the map for us. &gt;&gt; There is a mountain where there's some beautiful things took place. &gt;&gt; And I'm not ashamed of them. Are you? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; What happened in these mountains? A sword came down. A revelation came down. Revelations of marriage and revelation of the truth of God of the third pool. The furtherance of the ministry. Seven angels come down. The revelation of the seals. The opening of the word on this Catalina mountain range in this uh sunset mountain, Sabino Canyon, Puma Canyon. The whole mountain range was put on the map in God's great economy. Just like the mountain in Mount Si was right. &gt;&gt; A sword came down in that mountain over there. &gt;&gt; It did come down. How do you know? Something in my soul told me so. How do you know? The prophet said so. I believe his word. That's what happened in these mountains here. I wonder if the prophet in 1963 when the seals was open, I wonder if the Lord would have opened up the seals of time and showed him the future of 2025, would he see you? It's a beautiful thought, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Because God saw you. And if God wanted the prophet to know, he would have let him know. But he doesn't let the prophet know everything. Just how that's how Elijah was. Elijah didn't know. He thought he was the only one. But God showed him that there were 7,000 that didn't bow their knees. I want to be a part of that 7,000. &gt;&gt; I want to be a part of that 700. I want to be a part of that 500. &gt;&gt; I want to be a part of that hundred. &gt;&gt; Actually, I only need one space. &gt;&gt; Don't you? &gt;&gt; I want to be a part of the number that's going in the rapture. Let's go a little bit further here. What does thou hear? No, let's go a little bit further here. The prophet of God takes this here. My time is gone. God bless you. And see what he says in the souls that are in prison now. 1963. Notice when Jezebel rose on the scene, there was a man rose up against it. God brought a man. We don't know even know where he come from. He had no background of ministry. He never was a priest or nothing. He come forth an old rugged woodsman by the name of Elijah. He laid the axe to the root of the tree. They hated him. Not only that, but his whole congregation hated him. And one time he thought he stood alone. He says, "No, I got 7,000 yet. That's right with you." See, that was that elected group. See, there is always that group said, "Don't fear Elijah. I know you think you're run out because the denominations run you up there on top of the hill, but said I got 7,000 that believes the same thing you're preaching. See, I got them. Now, are you a part of the group that believe the same thing that he's preaching? &gt;&gt; That's an identification right there. There's a group that's not believing 90% of it or part of it. They're believing the same thing that's being preached in the tape ministry. &gt;&gt; They're believing it. They're standing with it. There's a number. There's a evening seed. There's a remnant that's believing it. and they're standing with the word 100% with what's on the tape ministry. You know, many have changed and they'll continue to change. Huh? But there's a group that believes exactly the way he believes. And Elijah didn't even know who they were. Didn't even know who they were until God showed him. &gt;&gt; Don't be so discouraged. You're not by yourself. Elijah, I got 7,000. &gt;&gt; Let me take one last quote. and events made clear by prophecy. Paragraph 69. The Bible says they were raised up to take that place. They was raised for that purpose. That's true. Romans 8 says that now the believers can see the word is made flesh in their generation. God speaking. Now them real true believers, them 7,000 or was it 700 in the days of Elijah? 7,000 is right. In the days of Elijah, there was 7,000 men out of about two or three million that saw that that was right. Not even a hundth of the people, Harley, but they saw it was right. They saw God manifested. The old widow. And he brother goes on. Let me take that one more time. Now the believers can see the word is made flesh in their generation. Can you see that? Or there's a lot of mistakes and it's not the same. It's this and that. The same sun that rose in the east is the same sun that sets in the west. Not sun like it. It's the same sun. You wake up in the morning, the sun rises in the east. It's the same sun. And the gospel has traveled that way. And the light that comes down isn't a junior light. Isn't a secondary light. It is the light itself that has come down. The same sun from the east is the same sun that's setting in the west under this ministry. What is it doing? It's revealing who these 7,000 are. They're standing with Elijah. They're with his ministry. Baal and a Ahab and Jezebel has taken up the whole nation and all it looks like is just Ahab and Jezebel's people and all that they had to offer. That's all you saw. That's all Elijah saw. That's all everybody saw. But God saw another little number. &gt;&gt; And this little number was actually standing with Elijah. &gt;&gt; Beautiful, isn't it? Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Standing with Elijah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; The believers can see the word is made flesh in our generation. God speaking them real true believers. Believers 7,000 or was it 700 in the days of Elijah? 7,000 is right. So this was revealed to him in the cave. What's the cave? The cave is that secret place where when you get along with God, there's a lot of things that might come and grab and try to grab your attention. As I close, let's just take one scripture in first Kings chapter 19 just for a moment. Verse 12, it says verse 11, the Lord tells him to go stand up on the rock. And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great strong wind the mountains, and breaking in pieces the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind. And after the wind, an earthquake. But the Lord was not in the earthquake. And after the earthquake, a fire. But the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire, a still small. Does he still speak in a still small voice? &gt;&gt; That's how he speaks to you today. &gt;&gt; Now, does the Lord use the wind? Yes. There's scriptures I can show you that the Lord was in the wind. Does the Lord use the earthquake? Yes. I can show you where he spoke through the earthquake. Is the Lord in the fire? The Bible says he's a consuming fire. &gt;&gt; But that's not one of those times. This time year, the Lord sends the wind, sends the fire, sends the earthquake, and then he wasn't in none of it. Then a still small voice. Every Christian, every man or woman, boy or girl, needs to have this still small voice speaking to them. &gt;&gt; It's the voice of the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's the voice of the word. And you can find that voice in the cave somewhere. You know, David was in the cave and he read wrote a couple of his psalms. He was on the run. Remember one time David ran into the cave and the man that was chasing him ran into the same cave and David his men are in this cave and then Saul says, "Hey, let's get some shelter. Let's go into that cave." They're coming to the cave and David's in the cave with this man like and Saul is looking for David. Saul was looking for David and they're all in the same cave. His enemy was after him in the same room and couldn't even find him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, God knows how to hide a believer. &gt;&gt; And he'll hide a believer and use him as a secret weapon many times. He He hid David. Here's Saul in the cave. They're in this cave all hiding. One's looking. The other one's running from. And the Lord puts Saul's men to sleep. &gt;&gt; And David gets up. &gt;&gt; Okay, David. This is your time to get them. The Lord has delivered your enemy in your hand. What did David do? No. No, no, no. I won't touch the Lord's anointed. That's the God that we serve. &gt;&gt; How many know that you're hidden today? &gt;&gt; Where's your hiding place? Your hiding place is in Christ. &gt;&gt; He'll hide you from the storms. He'll hide you from the troubles. He'll hide you from even your enemies. Even if they happen to follow you in the same cave, when it's time for the Lord to give you the victory, he will give you the victory. But this all happens in the still small voice and the voice, the voice of his word. We pray that God will bless you remnant seeds, you 7,000 or 700, you faithful few, and we'll find a time to get a part to pray in a solitary place and get along with him and let him reveal his will to you. God bless you. Let us pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Let us pray. Lord Jesus, thank you for your word today. Let it find its resting place in the heart of your people. Lord, visitors in the midst, our brother, young people, families, friends. Lord, let each one receive their portion from you. Oh God, as you speak to us in a still small voice, how many times, how many times have we decided to do things our own way, but a little voice will tell us not to do that or wait or don't don't go there or go here, go make this right, go handle this a certain way. It's in the still small voice. Will you open up your heart to that voice today? Will you let him have his way in your life? Would you stop all the other voices that are speaking to you, trying to influence you? Let the voice of the Lord speak to you in a still small place. God richly bless your people here today. Bless every heart we ask in Jesus name. Amen. Brother John, thank you if you'll come. Bless you. Remember, we'll have communion Lord's supper tonight. The Lord willing. God be God be with you. Pray for me. I'll pray for you. Amen. You always fill my heart with songs of deliverance. Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in you. I will trust in you. Let the weak say I am strong in the strength of my Lord. I will trust in you. Yes, I will trust in you. Let the weak say and strong in the strength of my Lord. I will trust in you. You are my hiding place. You always fill my heart with song and deliverance. Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in you. Yes, I will trust in you. [Music] Let the weak say I am strong in the strength of my Lord. [Music] Amen. Let's go to the key of C. My boat of life sails on a troubled sea. And ever there's a wind in my hand. But I have a friend who watches over me when the breeze turns into. [Music] I know the master of the wind. [Applause] I know the maker of the rain. [Music] [Applause] He came off the storm. Make the sun to shine again. I know the master of the wind. Sometimes I sow like an eagle to the sky on the peaks my soul car. An unexpected storm may drive me from the high. It may bring me low, but it'll never bring [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I know the master of the wind. [Music] I know the maker of the rain. He can calm the storm, make the sun to shine again. I know the master of the wind. [Music] In moments like these, I sing out a song. I sing out a love song to Jesus [Music] in moments like these. I lift up my hands. I lift up my hands to you, Lord. Sing it as I love you, Lord. [Music] Sing it. I love you, Lord. Sing it. I love you, Lord. I love [Music] Let's just all stand together this morning. We'll sing one more before we dismiss. This was one that we heard the end of the tape this morning. They come from the east and west. Maybe to keep sing. Let's try that. They come from the east and west. They come from the land of Lord to feast with the king to die as his guest. How blessed these pils are. Beholding his hall, the glory divine. We're blessed part of his praise as gifts in his crown shine. This Jesus has set me free. I'm happy as hard can be. No longer I share the burden of care. His yoke is so sweet to me. My soul was as black as night. My darkness has taken light. Now I shout the victory. For Jesus has set me free. And I look on that great white before in the ransom stand. No longer our tears, nor is nor death in the good land. My savior is gone before. Prepare the way for thee. To will be to heart no more through time is etern. Third verse. The gate to that holy place. The gates of that holy place. Stand open by night and day. Just look to the Lord who giveth for grace whose love has prepared the way. A home in those spare. His hand has reserved for all. for the way peace prepare obeying the grace. And the last verse, oh Jesus is coming soon. Our trials will then be. [Music] What if our Lord this moment should come for those who are free from sin? Well, then would it bring you joy? Or sil and deep despair. When our Lord in glory comes, we'll meet him up in the air. The course. Oh, since Jesus has set me free, I'm happy as heart can be. No longer I bear the burden of care is your kiss so sweet to me. My soul was as black as night, but darkness has good life. Now I shall wherever we come. This is the prayer. Jesus has set me free. Amen. [Music] Let's all bow our heads. Heavenly Father, thank you Lord so much for this service this morning. Thank you, Lord, for your word that you've brought to us. Lord, I just ask that you would sink the words into our hearts, Lord. that Lord we would fully comprehend and understand everything that was preached this morning. Lord, help us to find a place of solitude, Lord, to meet with you, Lord. Lord, to set the greatest appointment that could ever be made, Lord, an appointment with Almighty God. &gt;&gt; Lord, to to meet with you, to talk with you, Lord, to have a conversation with you, Lord. Lord, help us to be more intentional with our time, to be more proactive and serious with this great hour, Lord, with our relationship with you, Lord, and the seriousness of it, Father. Lord, we love you so much. We thank you, Lord, and we just ask that you would just be with the communion this evening, Lord. Just help us to be prepared in our hearts for that, Lord. Help us to make ready and to be right, Lord. We thank you so much once again for your word. We pray this in the name of Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. [Music] Amen. You're dismissed. One other song that I came to my mind this morning when listening to the tape and that's that city where the lamb is the light. Key of C. [Music] In that city where the lamb is the light. Oh, in that city where they're calling no night. Oh, I a manion over there. And when we come to the fear, I am going where the lamb is alive. Yes. In that city where the lamb is alive. In that city where there comes no night. I have a mansion over there. And when we come to here I am going. The land is alive. Well, here we have our days of sunshine. But we know that the sun which shines upon us now so bright will be changed to clouds and rain until we go to that city where the lamb is alive. In that city where the lamb is alive. In that city where the no. Oh, I have a mansion over there. And with me to go where the land is the light. Now here we have our disappointments all the while. And our bondest hopes but meet with bitter blood. Oh, by night we weep, the morning brings us smile. In that city where the lamb is the light. Oh, in that city where the lamb is alive. In that city where they're coming none. Oh, I'm a mansion over there. And when we boil I am going where the land is alive. [Music] Years I spent in vanity and pride caring not my Lord was crucified. Oh, and not it was for me. He died on Calary. Oh, mercy there was great and grace was free. Pardon there was multiplied to me. Bear my burden so bound at Calary. [Music] Now I've given to Jesus everything. And now I gladly own him as my king. And now my raptured soul can only sing of Calary. [Music] Mercy there was great and great was free. There was multiplied to me. There my burden soul found liberty at Calary. Glory [Applause] [Music] to you. [Music] [Music] [Music] Wonderful. Hallelujah. [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh.
