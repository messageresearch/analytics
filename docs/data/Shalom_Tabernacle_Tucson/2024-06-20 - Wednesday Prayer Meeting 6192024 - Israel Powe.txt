the house of the Lord we pray God will bless you as you made the effort to be here and we'll take a few moments to go on the word of God and before we go to prayer and um i' like you to uh as they play softly let's bow our heads for a word of prayer just as we go to his word Lord Jesus father we come to you tonight asking your blessings Lord speak to our hearts what we have need of Lord you know exactly uh where we're headed if we're not headed in the right direction tonight or today Lord readjust our our path and our steps Lord that we would think the right way walk the right way and get in get in line with you and your perfect will we ask your blessings upon each one Lord Jesus forgive us of our sins and our shortcomings here our cry meet the need in our life we pray we ask your blessings now in jesus' name thank you for all the saints that made it out tonight may may you bless them richly we pray in Jesus name amen amen there's a portion in James chapter 4 we' like to turn there just for a moment in um James chapter 4 versus number six and the scripture [Music] says but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resisteth the proud but he giveth Grace unto the humble submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil he'll flee from you you draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands you Sinners purify your hearts you double-minded be afflicted and mourn weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness humble yourself in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up amen powerful portion of the word let us uh uh think on these things as you're seated God bless you of course we know in the word of God as the prophet told us the way up is down and we have been talking about receiving more power and I've just been really dealing with this down in my heart and I want to take just a few moments and and uh take a few quotes from Sunday that I didn't get to and and then we'll go to prayer Amen in the message the faith of Abraham so here um brother banam is talking about the young convert and the new convert and as we read the scripture here that um he gives more grace he he resists the proud but he giveth more grace and more grace is more power more grace is more of his love and he gives you more of that he resists your pride he resists the proud but he gives grace to the humble and let's think about that in the message the faith of Abraham brother bam says this in paragraph number 62 he said to the one who believes that is scientifically this is another dimension to the Christian it's another sphere of the holy spirit it's only the same holy ghost that saved you young convert if it's yielding yourself to him so brother random is making it very clear that as a Christian as a young convert that's the holy spirit that lifts you out of the world to believe that the Lord Jesus is the son of God Amen to believe that his word is true it takes something to break you out of what you used to be doing and then now you're coming to church on a Wednesday night yes it's it's a power and that was faith and so brother bam continues in the message of Grace and he says this paragraph 177 he says then as much Faith as you have that's where you live once way down here in the muck of sin now you young converts now you believe you're saved don't you then you raised up here you raised a little higher what does that your faith Faith because you believe you're a Christian now you'll live above that thing now see now if you want to raise a little higher just have more faith because it's unlimited just keep on so this faith that we're talking about the powers of God are unlimited there's more of it for you how many need more amen sure I know a lot of people would say they want more but how many actually need more like it it it becomes a need and when it becomes a need then it becomes your prayer and when it becomes your prayer becomes your expectation it's where your heart is set now it's where you now are it's becomes most the most important thing to you and I believe it's for the believer and brother random deals with this a little bit more in the message going going beyond the camp then I'm going to take an Old Testament scripture just for a moment so he's dealing with the young converts and then he deals um as he talks about this the the most powerful church let me let me take that one first so because we dealt with this on Sunday talking about your soul your thinking and your attitude and that's all in James chapter 4 if you look at it there that we read your soul your thinking your attitude if you can get that right there's a powerful church and this is in the message this is paragraph number 44 and it's in the message enticing spirits and brother bam says this here I said why um someone ask if there's wrong to do a certain thing why are you questioning about if there's a question in your mind leave it alone don't do it at all just stay with that when you start to do anything and if it's a question whether it's right or wrong stay away from it don't go into it at all then you know you're right now all things ought to be considered prayerfully first seek you first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things will be added I am positive sure this morning if men and women could only get into the position of where their soul their thinking their attitude will be perfect in the sight of God that would be one of the most powerful churches that ever existed now think about that Saints my soul my thinking my attitude to get that all in line put all of that in check then there's there's where the power is now does everybody have to come into that maybe everybody won't does everybody have to agree with that maybe everybody won't but I can I can internalize it I can pick that up and make that word work for me because it's unlimited to the believer so brother Trevor I don't have to ask permission to say Amen to anything in the word I don't say can is it okay for me to pray today or should I pray for more Holy Ghost let me ask for permission no you don't have to ask permission for that that's unlimited go get it it's for the believer it's right there in on your knees if you can believe it you can have that that's on you now it's not on God he made the promises that's not on God that's on you my brethren he said the church young men is a dead church that's on you the church y men we got problem that's a you problem that is not the church problem that is not a Bible problem that is not everybody else problem that is on you because the promises are to you the individual now go pick it up and make it work in your life hallelujah amen and I love that freedom don't you brother will I love that unlimited power that's in the word of God that I can actually claim my entire family even my second cousins even the ones that don't live with me even the ones that everybody else rote off I can claim them that's my that's on me now that's unlimited I can pray for all of my family some of y'all can pray for half of yours or the little bit that you see but you actually can pray for all of them that's on you now that's on the believer now the prophet of God goes a a little bit further in this message going beyond the camp and I like this here and he says paragraph number 48 he says you know I was told some time ago that they had a Jet Plane makes them noises we hear around here that shakes the windows it's when the plane has got so fast that it crosses its own sound called sound barrier and when it goes beyond its own sound barrier it's almost unlimited to what it'll do and I think in there that we got a lesson when we go beyond our own sound barrier into the word of God then it's unlimited so you got to get past you you got to get past your sound barrier and all the sounds of negativity and all these other sounds you got to get past you I don't have to worry about everybody else who on what they doing who's here who's not that ain't even the problem I got to get past the man in the mirror and if I can get past the sound barrier in my mind and my thinking in my attitude and then pick up the word of God then it's unlimited to me amen amen it's you don't have to have a bad day how many's ever had a bad day you don't have to have one you can make it a good day it can start out bad but get down on your knees and make it good we're creators and we can create a good day we can create a good attitude we can create an atmosphere as Believers as creators and that's deliberate saints that is the prophet of God says in going Beyond said as it continue says I think we got a lesson when we go beyond our own sound barrier into the word of God then it's unlimited what God can do with the man that's ready to go beyond the camp the camp of man that is now we see that going beyond the camp going Beyond this and so brother vam continues on so we see it's unlimited when we go beyond our own sound barrier now I trust the Lord will bless your heart on these few quotations here tonight and that when we go to the Lord in prayer that we're actually getting our mind our soul and our attitude in line with the word of God Amen that's what I want that's what I need in my life that's what I'm trying to accomplish and achieve in my life if this is my last series of preaching if this is my last service this is my last opportunity then I want it to be well spent my time on my knees this is yes yes that's that's what it is that's exactly what it is it's taking advantage of every heartbeat every breath every moment on the clock every Wednesday taking advantage of that and we have the opportunity to do that the word of God is unlimited to the believer now churches and people limited and they limit themselves but God never put those limits on you you listen to the you look in the word of God and you hear of um deaf ears being open and blinded eyes coming open and even the dead being raised you think you can't see that you think that you can't pray for someone and that happened who put that limit on you you can pray for the sick and they will recover yes you can lay hands on the dead and they'll raise again why by what Authority are you speaking these things on the word of God as you pick up the word in there you can see that it's unlimited to the believer so I'm trying to rise up out of status quo what I did the last 20 years of my life I'm trying to get out of that I'm moving in something greater why because the Rapture is greater and we call ourselves looking for a Rapture that's greater and where am I living today I can internalize these things tonight and take God at his word I want to take just the power of humility and we're going to go on the Old Testament in First Kings chapter 21 very familiar portion of scripture and just read that very soberly and just get a context on how the Lord views humility sometimes it's contrary to our carnal thinking came to pass that after these things that nebat the jezreelite jezreelite had a Vineyard which was in jezel hard by the Palace of Ahab king of Samaria and Ahab spake unto nabat saying give me thy Vineyard that I may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near unto my house and I will give thee for it a better Vineyard than it or if it seemed Good To Thee I will give Thee the worth of it in money and naboth said to Ahab the Lord forbid it me that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee now naab is standing in on something here in this scripture and there's uh three places in the scriptures it's in Leviticus 25 numbers 36 and Ezekiel 46 where the Lord strictly commands the children of Israel not to sell their inheritance The Inheritance that the Lord has given them now they can lose that inheritance because someone fell in debt or what not but it was always determined that that inheritance would be restored back through a seven-year release or like in the case with Ruth and Naomi there's a way you can redeem the land that you lost but it was never in God's intention for you to take what he gave you and you to profit off of it to sell it because somebody else wanted it this was God's land so he says this wasn't a business decision this was all about the Lord and Nebo was standing for something and if you don't stand for something something some people say you'll fall for anything you got to have some principles that you're standing on and that's this word and so he and Ahab came into his house heavy displeased because of the word which nebot the jezreelite had spoken to him for he said I will not give Thee the inheritance of my father and he laid down upon his bed and turned away his face and would eat no bread but Jezebel his wife came to him and said unto him why is thy spirit so sad that thou eatest no bread he said unto her because I spake unto nebar the jezreelite and I said unto him give me thy Vineyard for money or else if it pleas the I will give thee another Vineyard for it and he answered I will not give thee my Vineyard and Jezebel his wife said unto him don't thou now govern the Kingdom of Israel arise eat bread and let thy heart be merry I will give Thee the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite so she wrote letters in ahab's name and sealed them with his seal and sent the letters unto the elders and to the Nobles that were in the city dwelling with nabo we'll see how Noble these Elders are she wrote in letter saying proclaim a fast and set naboth on high among the people he set two men sons of Bal before him to Bear witness against him saying thou did blaspheme God and the king and then carry him out and stone him that he may die and the men of his City even the elders and the Nobles who were the inhabitants in his city did as Jezebel had sent unto them and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them they proclaimed a fast they said naboth on a high among the people and there came in two children of Bello and set before him the men of bellel witnessed the the the and the men of bell bell say that for me help me bow witnessed against him even against naboth in the presence of the people saying Nebo did blaspheme God and the King Then They Carried him forth out of the city and stoned it with stones that he died how many know this ain't a fairy tale how many know this really happened who are you in the text if you were to put yourself somewhere who would you be in this text put yourself in nebot shoes these people are lying on him they hired Witnesses against him put yourself in the in the shoes of the Nobles and the Elders of the city who get a letter from a powerful woman and tells them do this do this do this where's the men in this city where's the noble ones at you know some people just go along with whatever power is ruling them they don't stand for nothing they have no principles I mean if this was another guy like neot he didn't care he would have just sold his property he' still be alive or he would have kept life but look at these letters come these nobl men the Elders of the city these are people that handle the law of Moses they're gonna shump up charges against this man take him out of the city and stone him I wonder if he pleaded his innocence I wonder if he said that's not true I wonder if he screamed for his life didn't matter they lied they took this man's life and he took his Vineyard now that Spirit of Jezebel we know is still alive today the Bible identifies her in the Book of Revelation that spirit is out there and you know it's it's as easy as this it's just as easy as this why we pick nebot the only reason why they got neighb is because his farm his field was next to the Kings that's the only reason and he wasn't going to budge he was standing for some principles and so his evil man come and get him they Stone him verse 14 they sent to Jezebel saying Neath is Stone and is dead it came to pass when Jezebel heard that nabo was stoned and was dead that Jezebel said to Ahab arise take possession of the vineyard of Nebo the jezreelite which he refused to give thee for money for nebot is not alive but dead and it came to pass when irhab heard the nabo was dead that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of nabo the jezreelite to take possession of it and the word of the Lord came to Elijah the tishbite saying arise go down to meet Ahab king of Israel which is in Samaria behold he is in the vineyard of nebach wither he has gone down to possess it and thou shallal speak unto him saying thus sayeth the Lord hast thou killed and also taken possession and thou shal speak unto him saying thus sayeth the Lord in the place where the dogs lick the blood of nabot shall dogs lick thy blood even thine and Ahab said to Elijah hast thou Found Me Oh My Enemy he answered I have found thee because thou has sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the Lord behold I will bring evil upon thee and will take away the posterity and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and left in Israel and will make thine house like the house of gerbo the son of nebat and like the house of Basha the son of aijah for the provocation where with thou Hast provoked me to anger and made Israel to sin and of Jezebel also spake the Lord saying the dog shall eat Jezebel by the wall of jezrael him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat but there was none like unto Ahab which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord who whom Jezebel his wife stirred up and he did very abominably in following Idols according to all things as did the amorites whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel look at verse 2728 and 29 and it came to pass when Ahab heard those words that he rent his clothes he put sackcloth on his flesh fasted and lay in sackcloth and went softly and the word of the Lord came to Elijah the tishbite saying seest thou how Ahab humbled himself before me because he humbled himself before me I will not bring this evil in his days but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house and the church said amen powerful portion of the word of God wouldn't you saying seemed like you know the Lord would have just maybe maybe pronounced judgment on Ahab and Jezebel and dealt with them for the wickedness and the evil that that they did and the Lord did pronounce it upon them but look at the Lord's response to Ahab humbling himself even as evil as what this man did he was one of the worst kings that there were that's right he stirred up he stirred up with him and Jezebel to just a horrible Duo that will last throughout all time their evil and their wickedness but the even this evil man who did all this wrong come to a recognition of humbling himself you see our pride the Lord resists that any level of Pride you you know pride comes in so many forms soon as God blesses you your little pride wants to rise up and think that it's you you're so talented you're so gifted it's you Israel it's you brother man it's you sis it ain't you and and and God resists The Pride but even the even he'll he'll he'll receive a humble heart even if the things you done were evil the Lord will even in the case of this story here he takes ahab's humility he sees it and he tells the prophet about it do you see what Ahab just did did you see what he just did now go tell him it's all gonna happen but not in his days why because he humbled himself now let me ask you something is there something in your heart and in your life that you can humble yourself to tonight your pride will tell you there isn't nothing your pride will lie to you but when you get your heart right and you lying it up properly and when you really get in the presence of the Lord in prayer you'll find out there's some little evil intentions that we have and we want the Lord to remove that I do BL remove it all Lord you know I I'm looking good in front of the Saints I'm looking good here I haven't bothered nobody they can't see it but in my heart I know and he knows and it's not the SE it's not the open sin that I'm talking about that we got to come and make right it's those secret sins it's those little ones that needs to be tuned up and lined up and that's what a prayer meeting is all about humble yourself in the sight of the Lord not in the sight of man oh I'm so sorry you know weeping and crying make sure the camera's on me now I'm so sorry I'm repenting make sure make sure sir they you humble yourself in the sight of people the Bible says humble yourself in the sight of who in the sight of the Lord and He will lift you up you know your your pride you know you got it you know what that is we want to Humble that present that to the Lord and we know that there's power in there and then we can just raise up a little bit higher in our faith for salvation we can raise up a little bit higher in this unlimited Faith that's in the word of God and I believe God has that for us tonight amen amen the musicians come God bless you I just pray you take these things to the Lord in prayer Pray For Me pray for us pray for the church pray pray for the Saints of the most high God Amen thank
