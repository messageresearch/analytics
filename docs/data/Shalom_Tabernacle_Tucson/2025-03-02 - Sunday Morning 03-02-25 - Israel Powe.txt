========================================

good morning everyone welcome to the adult Sunday school can we all stand we're going to be continuing with the samerian church age today uh we'll start at paragraph 144 and end after 166 let's all go to him in prayer Heavenly Father we're thankful to be here today and Lord we're asking your blessing upon this Sunday school lesson father that as we hear the Bible preaching father that you give us an understanding Lord and a a wisdom father to take what we're hearing father and apply it to our lives Lord just help us father everyone this young children in their class every worker every musician Lord everyone that would sing and pray and lift up your Holy Name father we pray Lord that your hand would just rest upon all father we thank you be with us now Lord as we hear your word father let it become a part of us even more in the name of Jesus Christ we ask it amen let's sing only believe only [Music] be only be all things are possible only believe only be only be all things are possible only be you may be seated brother Brena now remember if hell is eternal then the Bible was wrong when he said hell was created and then if a man's go to burn for eternity in hell then you'd have to have eternal life to be conscious to burn is that right well how many forms of eternal life is there one amen that's right there one eternal life I don't go away and say brother BR don't believe in Hell brother BR does Believe In Hell the Bible teaches there's a hell just ass sure as there's a a place for rest there's a place of of punishment and God will certainly make a soul that sins against him be punished and for reject reting Jesus Christ as your savior you certainly will be punished for it but there will be a time when you'll be no more but how many million years that'll take for you to go back to that I don't know but sometime you're a time being until you're born again then you're Eternal being and the only way you can get it is have part of God in you being eternal life can you see it certainly he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit saith un the churches I love him don't you I'm so glad to have eternal life that doesn't bother me anymore uh because we have eternal life now I know that and I trust that everybody will have it all of us irenius yes I had a note here on ireneus about to read this history that a reason irenius was chosen is because that he had the signs of the Pentecostal original Church following him now if God how many believes that the church begin at Pentecost all right how many believe that God endorsed the church at Pentecost all right sir then if that was God's first church and that's what he called a church and he's the vine now we're the branches if the vine ever puts forth another Branch what will it be Pentecostal now maybe not the name now we got names of Pentecost but that's no more than Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal that don't mean a thing see that's just the name but as long as you got a Pentecostal experience in in your heart Pentecost in your soul giving you eternal life then God has promised you that you'll never be touched with the second death that you got eternal life and can't be touched with the second death see you got you're grieve not the holy spirit of God now don't grieve it do things that's wrong if you do you'll pay for it because the Bible said grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption is that right gri not the Holy Spirit oh it's going to be a wonderful day some more some these times to show you if the resurrections going to be Universal there'll be two in the field and I'll take one and two in the bed and I'll take one See it'll be the night one place and daylight on the other side of the earth be a universal resurrection that Rapture The Trumpet Of God shall sound and every one of these of this little church here here here and even that little Bunch that went through there come out here here here when that virgin that virgin when she seen in the seventh watch that I remember there were seven virgins is that right I mean five virgins one out 10 virgins went out to meet the Lord five was wise and five was foolish is that right and now in the watches though there was seven watches and at the end of the seventh watch some slept from this watch this one this one this one that the seventh watch there was a voice went out behold the bridegroom cometh go you out the meeting and they Rose and trimmed their lamps and all these others Rose down to here oh won't that be a wonderful time I we used to sing a little song it's a wonderful time for you what a wonderful time for me if we all prepare to meet Jesus our King what a wonderful time it will be let's see if we can sing it a wonderful time for you a wonderful time for me if we all prepare to meet Jesus our King what a wonderful time will be won't that be wonderful oh won't it be wonderful there having no burdens to bear joyously singing with heart or ringing oh won't it be wonderful there how many of you knows that you'll get home how many knows you'll go out that door you don't know how many knows if you do go out you will come in again you cannot tell so don't let this night fail don't you fail God in this night for this might be the last night that you'd have a time or a chance who are you anyhow where did you come from where are you going the only book in the world can tell you what it is is this blessed old Bible here and that's the Bible that we believe in that's the god that we believe in and if you're not into that bride into this little bunch of minorities way down here today being squeezed out by Creeds and denominations and so forth if if if you're not in that little group now you don't have to jar this Tabernacle you don't have to jarn anything you just have to be born into that Kingdom now if you want your fellowship in the Methodist Baptist Presbyterian wherever you want it that's up to you see you put your fellowship with anybody you want to but I'll tell you one thing when you're born again your birds of a feather someone asked me one time said brother R you told them people going back to Methodist Church I said sure let them throw him out and they had no place to go so so go on back won't be very long won't be right they'll be right back again you know one time in the ark a place of safety Noah there was a big flood come and so Noah turned the crow out of the Ark and he just went on hawing and looking around well he was satisfied CU he was a vulture to begin with he could fly from an old dead carcass and need a belly full off of this mule and go there on this this old sheep needed belly P off of him and something else was just all kind of old dead carcasses laying around so the crow would just sit down there call around boy I'm having me a jubilee all by myself just calling away but when they turn the little Dove out he's a different nature that stink he couldn't stand why a dove hasn't got any G he's the only bird that doesn't have a gall he couldn't digest it so the only thing he could do is get right back to the ark and be on the door just go anywhere you want to only thing I'm asking you to do is just come into the kingdom I know where you'll go you won't be able to stand it anymore brother you say I've crossed a separating line I've left this world behind yes sir it sure is oh they were gathered in the upper room all praying in his name they were baptized with the Holy Ghost and Powerful service came now what he did for then that day he'll do

so we like to go right into the word this morning and uh try to be mindful of our the day today there's a portion in the scripture in Matthew chapter 19 um is where we're going to kind of touch a little bit but let's take Hebrews 11 and we'll stand to our feet and turn there just for a moment and the brother from Germany where's that brother at let's see right there God bless him amen Lord bless you my brother welcome Hebrews 11 very famous portion of scripture the heroes of the faith are mentioned here you know we've been speaking of Joshua Joshua is not mentioned here but what he did to the walls of Jericho are mention but in Hebrews we're going to focus on this verse number 23 and the Bible says by faith Moses when he was born was HD three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter it's a pretty tremendous Choice there choosing rather to to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ what greater greater riches than the treasures in Egypt or any other economy you can think of for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward amen there's coming a day where rewards will be given out and we are in a great race a race like no other race the race of your life amen the race the challenge the great test the turmoil and we want to finish that race as God will help us amen amen one more scripture Matthew chapter 7 verse number 14 verse 13 enter ye in at the Straight Gate for wide is the gate and Broad is the way that leadth to destruction and many there be which go in there at because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadth unto life and few there be that find it amen the title of the message uh this morning is simply the harder way the harder way is my way the harder way is my way amen we'll go to the Lord in prayer heavenly father bless your word bless your people we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated our sister there's a sister um I don't know if she's here Sharon you mention her maybe she's not here sister Dorcas she right there okay oh my so our dear sister is a a True Believer we she's been among us a few times and we um you kind of move kind of quick you know so we can't catch her like we want to but I believe this is going to be her last service here I believe she's moving to Phoenix and so uh her father is one of the pioneers of this message that brought the message to what country was that sis equ Equatorial Guinea and so she's a PK preachers kid pastor's kid and um a good one at that and the Lord has kept her and she's been among us and we just get to know her and she's leaving already but she's not too far she's she'll be in Phoenix and we hope to see her there if the Lord are will she's a young lady and she'll be getting married here soon and so we pray the Lord will bless her richly amen thank the Lord for her now the harder way is my way is the title of this message and as I was um something had been Direct directing me to the marriage and divorce sermon very strict sermon and I would I would in Los crues last week I asked the group of Youth in the youth meeting I don't think it was a Sunday morning but the youth meeting I was quoting out of the message um um spoken word is the Original Seed a 5H hour sermon and I asked the youth how many had heard that message and I was surprised but I'm wasn't too surprised that there was a number of them that had never heard that message of course if you're a young person and you're going to pick a message to listen to it's probably not going to be a five hour one but as I said to them it it's only 30 minutes for the first 30 minutes and then the next 30 minutes that'll get you an hour and then you just eat it a little bit at a time all right so say that with me it's only 30 minutes only 30 minutes for the first 30 minutes minut now can you do that and so there was a number that didn't hear that and so I encourage them to hear that and I like each of you to hear that as well but this message marriage and divorce just was striking my heart as brother Nathan was doing a test one day here trying to work out the sound and a portion of that test brother bam he he blasts it out he said if I really preach marriage and divorce how it should really be preached it would tear up every Church in the country and then he slides in there and maybe they should be tore up he slid that in there it would tear up every Church in the country and then maybe it should be tore up and so I like us not to walk away from this message but to embrace it Embrace that teaching on marriage and divorce and what brother randam did was he took Matthew chapter 19 as his scripture to open it up and when he gets into it he begins to share with us that when you get a chance he said to take all the scriptures he said don't get up and walk out says he says brother don't turn the tape off he Saidi want you to hear it all the way to the end and he said' if you if there's something you disagree with he said take the scriptures go home and read it and then pray about it and so many times we'll listen to a message or listen to the tape and not hold that discipline in there well we know the prophet said it yes we know the Bible said it yes but did you you take that scripture to your prayer closet and ask God to let it reveal itself to you and this is the point in taking notes or recording something from the service you don't come here to be entertained this is not a movie this is not you know the high points something to make us happy or laugh we're actually trying to hear from the word of the Lord and you should be getting something I be getting something when I read the Bible when I read the word of God that I can go back and now meditate on it pray about it because every one of us will give an account for the the Deeds that are done in our body and the things we do and so looking into this message in marriage and divorce it um was um right consistent in the beginning there he gives this um prophecy that happened to him in 1961 it was in February in 1961 he was in California and he preached a whole string of meetings 19 1961 in February there in Long Beach California uh February 7th 8th 9th 10th 11th the 12th two services on the 12th the 13th the 14 14th two services on the 16th and 17th um on the 18th and then on the 19th he preach the queen of shba and here he is preaching about Abraham in this series of messages and as he was preaching that he preached um just a few titles Jehovah Gyra Abraham Abraham's Covenant confirm Jehovah Gyra again and thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemy the basis of Fellowship so it's very uh Centric around this topic of Abraham which we have brought to you in Genesis chapter 15 this is why this is where Israel was uh the Lord showed Abraham that Israel would go to Egypt and will be there in bondage for 400 years and that I would bring them out of this Strange Land and then there's a story of Joshua and Caleb and the people of God coming out of this slavery basically abuse and then going into this great new land a promised land and then having to cross over Jordan and at Jordan they couldn't all go over so it was delayed again by an extra 40 years because they wasn't all ready Joshua and Caleb were ready and we have been encouraging the church here it's been on my heart that this Joshua and Caleb um positions that they took you know the word of the Lord continues to recycle itself around and it's a great drama and a great play of redemption not just Israel coming out of Egypt but it's brother Israel coming out of Egypt not just his son um uh Moses and the Hebrews he's talking about his Sons and Daughters you and you and you coming out of Egypt the great Plan of Redemption and it keeps playing itself over and over again in the scripture then you see it in the New Testament with the Gentiles and then you see it in your very life that God is trying to move you to the next level and that was crossing over Jordan into the great promised land and see and so now brother randam is bringing this Covenant of ab Abraham and he's bringing all these messages here on the West Coast it was very very difficult for him to bring it but at the end of one of those sermons this young man who was a Baptist man grabs him and begins to tell him the things that you were preaching it could have been like the the the the the the addition to the Bible and so forth and then the anointing strikes this man he was is a French man and he prophesies over the prophet now that was in February he doesn't mention it to his people until 10 months later in December he doesn't mention it to the Tabernacle because obviously he's traveling in the ministry and so forth but here he picks it up in the message Paradox and 1961 of December and the prophet of God says this here and this Frenchman the second one over here he wrote it out because he had been taking minutes of the meeting here is what he wrote I Victor Leo am a French man full blooded born again Christian filled with the Holy Spirit I live at 809 North King Road Los Angeles attend Angeles attend bethl Temple Arie Vic is our pastor a Pentecostal Minister biggest Pentecostal Church in Los Angeles a translation of the prophecy over brother randana given by Danny Henry in French February 11th 1961 at the Full Gospel businessman's breakfast a true translation of the prophecy all three of them said this so there was three witnesses that said this very same thing because thou H has chosen the Narrow Path see just against I'd have to walk by yourself see I can understand that Moses had to make his choice too see he didn't have to do it but he did it see the harder way see because thou has chosen the Narrow Path the harder way thou has made thou has walked of your own choosing in other words I didn't have to do it I can side in go with them if I want to but I stayed I want to stay with the word thou has picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way if you'll notice it punctuated underline if you notice it's wrote in French this spoken French verb before the adverb see because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee now that's what I wondered when I die will it be then I happen to think Heaven is not portioned off to different portions to us up there Heaven is the Kingdom of Heaven that's within us one waits for see now watch what a glorious decision thou Hast made this in itself is that which will give and make come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine H see we would would say in the tremendous victory in Divine love but in French it would be love divine just like German or any other see put the verb before the ABB now you see what's coming down to the Jordan minant so here what he saying now he's bringing in Jordan where's Jordan at it's in the Old Testament where's Jordan at it's in the Book of Joshua in the book of numbers so he's now relaying his own this this Paradox message and then now this tremendous Victory this decision to choose the harder way now we're coming to the Jordan now let me stop here for a minute all of us are coming to a Jordan and even kades Baria a time of decision we're all faced with that different areas in different stages of our life in one place don't worry I'll get back to the quote in one Place brother brandom says that the brandom Tabernacle is now at kades Baria like what you talking about where we I mean the brandom Tabernacles that CAD you got to get the spiritual application of what he's saying you're at ksh Baria you got to make a decision and God forces the decision out of all of us you know at some point you got to say what you believe you got got to take a stand on something and we can hide behind this and we're not a fighter we don't want to fight so we don't like conflict we don't want to bring it up we try to run it but the time is coming well you got to say what you believe all colors will be made known and we see that hour approaching to us now so here he's bringing in the Jordan you now you see what coming down to Jordan meant we're down here now let's cross over now let's quit playing who we preaching to let's quit playing Let's cross the other side now cuz it all belongs to us it's all ours then invisions has never failed they can't fail because they come from God I believe with all that is within me we're not the hirling that will run back into the Wilderness we'll cross Jordan the separation God break to us the seals that's on the backs side of the book let us enter into this great place now for Joshua divided to the people their inheritance that God had left for them Oh Glory praise the Lord does anybody want to cross over over or do you want to stay with church church normal the way it's always been I want to cross over yeah no no if the prophet said it that's our example if it's in the word of God that's what I want I don't want an excuse why we can't have it I don't want an excuse of why it can't happen in our church I want across all over I'm coming to the Jordan amen our days are numbered here all of our days are numbered here and I want to cross over what a beautiful message God has given us in this last day he didn't give us a message so we can argue and fight give us a message so we can look good in the mirror he gave us a message to change us and be ready for the Rapture the resurrection amen amen amen so I love how he types that he's bringing in this Narrow Path this harder way thou has walked of your own choosing now brother brandom has this experience and he's preaching all of these sermons and all these messages this seemingly no nobody out of nowhere grabs him and prophesies this to him that that you have walked in your own choosing so as you focus in on this message of marriage and divorce it's one of those critical ones and I think that we should all listen to it again and hear it again you know there's some hard hard places in there I haven't heard anyone else preach on it quite like that of brother Ram's time his contemporaries you go back they're not preaching the origin of you know the original sin and he's bringing in the original sin and then he he brings this up in marriage and divorce let's just go there quickly in um paragraph number 57 if we could take it there it's always an issue it comes up all the time he says with Believers and there's a reason why it comes up the script this scripture this question confronted Jesus at the very beginning of his ministry and it confronted Moses at the very beginning of his ministry it's a foremost question in Believers Hearts The Sinner doesn't care but it's to Believers because the believer is trying to do all that he knows how to do to live right before God therefore for it any question comes up on religion then the marriage and divorce case comes up why because it is the cause of the original sin that's where sin started and that's the reason it's brought up every time because it is the very beginning of sin and I'll say this here today if you're a young man or young woman and you're not married you need to get that message and embrace it and you need to hear the truth at least one time and you need to hear it until you really understand as you take the notes and the scriptures of what the prophet of God is saying this message you ain't going to get nowhere else this message on marriage and divorce comes out of the opening of The Seven Seals the seventh angel had to break that and bring bring that to the people and that Revelation that's hidden way way back behind the shakina glory there's some bread back in there that come up from behind the shakina of glory and now it's been broken and open to us today amen and our young people need to embrace it the married folks need to embrace it our elders need to embrace it our beloved sisters need to embrace it what is it it's the cause of the original sin and it opens up it wasn't one of those easy messages you know he says in the beginning there in paragraph number five it's like he was handcuffed to telling the truth he had to say it were some ministers you know brother BR had a successful Ministry of science wonders and miracles he had a beautiful Ministry that you know just signs wonders and miracles why don't you leave all of this harsh preaching this uncomfortable material why don't you leave that alone leave that to somebody else but that wasn't his ministry was it he had to say it and that was that was God leading him and guiding him because we gone so far away from the truth in any and many of our churches today have gone so far away from it that when you bring up these subjects it's like Foreigner you get even tightening from from the from Home Folks you know take a subject on you know the bride and the condition of the church and the women and the way they dress and every you know I really don't preach on it that much like I should and you know but still you preach on it once in a year and somebody say oh I sure appreciate that but you remember there's a balance wait wait wait wait wait what are you talking about the balance we I haven't preached on it in like for how long you said well remember there's a balance hey wait a minute the tapes are already balanced so every time you hear it on the tape you going to stop the Propet wait brother brand there's a balance to that you better say Amen to the word amen amen yes but I know it's tightening time cuz we're in Leo deia and I know it's a hard time it's the hardest time for you to be a young person to you be a father for me to be a pastor for you to be whatever you are it's the hardest age ever to do it but God has given us what we need marriage and divorce paragraph number four he says this here we've had a tremendous time in the Lord we're under great anticipations for this service and now tonight being the closing time for this four days paragraph 5 now I hope that the audience will not be nervous and I'm trusting the God that I will not be nervous for I've had a tremendous night a lot of strain for I realize that the things that I say this morning will be held against me in the day of judgment and I couldn't sleep and I know if I don't say them it'll be held against me in the day of judgment so it makes it hard you can't explain L it a't that beautiful how he opens his heart there and shows us that if he doesn't say these things this critical uh message on marriage and divorce caus from the original sin which was adultery and now he's trying to bring a church that had ages six ages before it that had it pretty much all wrong as he was standing talking to his uh audience he said there's a curtain before me and I have a crowd on the left and a crowd on the right because the the building or the hall that they had to rent or the school I believe it was and so he's um talking to these two different sides these two different portions of the audience and then the curtain there right before him and and then to me to me as I'm embracing this more the invisible audience is really his main audience can I get a witness the tape was recorded that raised it up above even those that were sitting there amen now it's to those that have an ear to hear Glory this message was to an invisible audience the people not even born yet people in problem and troubles they're not even on the earth yet but they need to hear this message thank God for the tapes cuz I was that invisible audience Hallelujah many of you were the invisible audience too you wasn't there GL huh but I'm there now there I'm listening to it now and I have the opportunity to hear what God says from this seven seal message so the invisible audience becomes a more important audience thank you than all the people that were in physically in the meetings beautiful to be in the meetings yes I'm not downplaying that but the recording is even if you were in the meetings huh even if you were in the meetings you still got to thank you hear me some here little damn there even if you were in the meetings you still got to go get the tape am I right about it somebody somebody help me so what was more important more important is the recording it's beautiful to be in the Bible days but the Bible has been written and recorded and now when I read it it's the word of the Lord to the believer that receive it so this invisible a audience is now highlighted Amen Brother Art and the Saints and Mesa yes it's the harder way it's the fourmost question in the believer's mind so here the prophet now is moving into this message now why is it so strict why is it so hard why are our churches so like they just on you like that why can't why can't we just compromise a little bit you know just water it down just a little bit become more like a Christian Christian Light Christian easy Christian um you know a remix of Christianity you sometime they remix the they remix stuff and it don't it ain't the same I remember they used to make the the anima syrup it used to be good but now it's not that good anymore they even cut her hair and bobbed her hair and they gave her a little lipstick how remember when she was a big big Aunt your mom had the big cheeks and everything I don't want the remix where's Big Mama at just give me what what you had before why you messing with the recipe and that's what they want you to do with this message they want you to remix It remake it our song service remix It remix remake how we operate How We Do how we handle sin re re reinvent marriage and divorce I'm so glad he preached the way he did and there's nobody else preaching it that way why because he's calling out a bride for the Rapture this is a harder way not a prophet of God continues in the message Abraham and this is that series of meetings that he was in when this prophecy was given I went back and looked up a few places there some of the things that he said and in 1961 he says in the message Abraham now let's follow Abraham paragraph 79 aimik said you know there's a beautiful Hebrew woman is that your husband no that's my brother he said that's right that's my sister which it it it which is was his half sister well so he said well I'll take her over to a palace she'll become my wife I'll give her a lot of things see I'll I'll give you a lot of things see all right so he took her over there could you imagine a man doing a thing like that so he stepped over there see why why he done it why did he compromise he was out of the promise he went down in Greer that's the reason your women chop off your hair you use makeup and you fellows smoke cigarettes and carry on the way you do you get out of the promise and still remain deacons and members and so forth like these Baptists Presbyterians methodists Pentecostals and so forth you just get right out of the promise that's all the devil pushed you and he stay over here where you be long prayed up that's right let the devil speak to you listen to him he's saying so he's saying why did Abraham get off the ground why did he compromise because he was out of the will of the Lord he didn't stay in the grounds that God called him to now every one of us is called to a post a place that we're supposed to be and when we get out of that place then that's where the compromise can happen sometimes it looks better you know it's Greener over there it's better over there but God called Abraham to not leave the promised land and he left because of a drought and he's trying to figure it out and that's what we do sometimes we try to manhandle things and figure it out for ourselves but God is the one who's in charge of Our Lives we got to stay with him stay with his word and he'll make everything else line up exactly the way it's supposed to line up and this is our this is the harder way you know for you to be a real Christian a True Believer today it's a harder way than the natural Believers or the carnal Believers out there you know the churches are full there are lots of options you can go to to be a part of a quote unquote Christian church and some of them do a very very fine job and those first few steps as a baby coming to Christ I mean you have to receive the Lord Jesus by faith that he paid the price at Calvary how many believe that I don't have anything I'm for that 100% And many of the churches they'll take you all the way to the Altar and bring you to Christ on the cross and making a decision for him and that's beautiful and we do that too here but then how much further can you go after you have come to Christ he wants to be involved with your life he wants your planning he wants to be in your planning he wants to be on your calendar he wants to know where you are going tomorrow and be involved with what kind of friends you have what are you listening to what are you influenced by he wants to know every detail about your life so you come to him that's beautiful but then the next step he wants to find out more about you so he cleans up starts convictions and starts little things and starts to pull on this and Nag on that and do I have to give that up some people come to Christ and they don't think they have to give up anything they just want to come to Christ and then go to heaven you're like no no no we got to clean you up brother we have to clean you up my sister yes and this is the harder way you might have to let go of some friends there might be some family members not like you no more you might have to change careers have you had have you thought about that you might have to move from where you are today in order to follow Christ Jesus said take up your cross and follow me remember he came to that rich man and he offered him he says come follow me and it was too great it was too much for him to sell all that he had to follow Jesus well if I sell all that I have Lord what about my investments what about my retirement what about if I get sick what about if I need some money I don't want to borrow no money I'm going to follow you where you going where you live at Jesus well I don't have a house if you don't have a house why am I following you you Jesus asked the rich man to follow him and Jesus was broke Naturally Speaking where you live Jesus like where you going to eat at where's your next meal like he's just going wherever he going preaching on a boat preaching in villages laying hands on lepers like no Jesus I need something more stable than that I need something more stable than that Lord if you want me to sell everything I got and to follow you yes he wants you to follow him he's the great Shepherd you're just a sheep you don't know where you're going you think you know where you're going but when you get real real sick and your money can't get the sickness off of you you going to need somebody that can heal you you get lost you get you get hurt you get pain you're going to need somebody and that somebody is the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen it is the harder way it's the way that many have not gone it's the way of the cross the prophet of God Mo moves forward in this message here and he says this here in the message the true Easter seal praise the Lord he said this Pentecostal church if it would stand for another 2,000 years they'd be worse than the Catholic is now they're getting so far away from everything I was questioned the other day are you going to preach if you come to this place on women wearing makeup they shouldn't wear shorts shouldn't wear these things I said don't ask me then no sir don't ask me to come are you going to preach it they even said what business is that of yours I said it's the Lord's business and I'm about his business that's exactly right exactly so I said what do you do that for ain't them other things to say I said yeah but let them do that and then we'll talk on other things how many know there's some other things he talked about but don't deny these things you see so he let let's get the foundation laid that's what's the matter you're trying to jump on top of the ladder when you ought to be on the bottom yet see get started down here clean up get started right and then we could build upon that otherwise you cannot build because any foundation that's not built upon the principles of Christ will fall in the Bible it said it's an Abomination for a woman to wear a garment pertains to a man it hasn't changed one bit and God hasn't changed he's Eternal his his thoughts yesterday is the same as they are today and will be forever his spirit is the same yesterday today and forever his works is the same yesterday today and forever his Redemption is the same yesterday today and forever and he is the same yesterday today and forever there's no way of getting around it no the proof of the pudding is the eating thereof we know that is that right God said it was man was forced to make a decision what was they forced first in the days of Christ what was they forced to do they were forced first to accept him he showed them his sign his sealed he was the me Messiah how did he show it by just exactly what the Bible said he would do he was a prophet and he discerned the thoughts in their mind and they said he's a devil be elab they were forced to make a decision they could not hold it any longer neither can the Pentecostal church or the Baptist or the Presbyterian the Holy Ghost Christ has arisen and he's in the church amen and they say this man baptizes in the name of Jesus he believes you don't have to speak with tongues for the Holy Ghost and things like that that's not the initial evidence he believes in women or women all wearing their hair like that I think it has nothing to do with it then why is God vindicating that this is the truth find out where it's at they refused his messiahship when he showed them he was the Messiah they were forced to say something and so are they today turning it down and won't sponsor it washing their hands from it the decision is forced upon them there's no Middle Road where at the end time man is forced to receive it or reject it you've got to accept it or turn it away it's forced upon America it's forced upon the brandom Tabernacle it's forced upon the Pentecostals on the Methodist it's forced first everywhere you have to take it or leave it God has confirmed his word showing his sign back in his ministry showing exactly what he is by proving that he's God Jesus said if I do not the works of my father then don't believe me see they can't find nothing in that because that's true why don't they receive it it's because of a denomination they can't receive it so they are forced now to make a showdown can I keep reading and in Ohio just a few days ago the same churches that sponsored me a year ago because I attacked it and showed that it was wrong there wasn't one of them but one Church brother Sullivan would cooperate I said I still have the same hand I still have the same feet I still have the same message I'm still brother brandom what's the matter with me it's not me the Holy Spirit still speaks the Holy Spirit still does the same Works he still shows it but you're forced that's right they are forced and the great Holy Spirit falling right in their midst and speaking the words and saying the things that he said see so brother bandam is bringing this to the people that it comes the time where they're forced to make a decision we know that right around 1962 and just before brother Bam's Ministry was on the decline in the sense of opportunities to preach they started to close the door on him finally when he moved here to tucon he said he didn't have any nobody invited him to preach for three years the greatest Ministry that they'd ever seen or would ever see in in that respect like a a Ministry uh uh that had a you know a Revival a a pastor a A Prophet that God used is in your city and you're a church and a pastor but you wouldn't open your pull pit to him and he had he used to have open doors all over but now his ministry is closing down and tightening down and he had to make these harder decisions he had to take subjects and titles that no one else would touch and we thank God that he did it that he stayed true to the word God showed him a vision and he shared with us the vision and then some people argue say it ain't going to happen and run aren't you glad that he showed it to you he revealed to us these great truths these great visions that would take place first second and third poem and now he's preaching on you know serpent seed and marriage and divorce and the the the the the conduct of women today and women preachers had gone just rampid and people women called the preach and he stood against that my goodness and so they asked him are you going to preach on the women when you come here he's like well don't invite me to come because he had to preach it not in the bad attitude but that was his message and here he was 1961 is all coming together now because you have chosen the harder way you have walked in your own choosing I didn't force you to do it you made that choice you walked in your own choosing and you chose the harder way but the harder way is my way Glory Glory Hallelujah oh my what a constellation that must have been it's the heart way this you know the in invitations are dropping I know I'm not as popular as I used to be they don't want me coming to their convention uh you know the others that sprung off of my Ministry their Ministries are growing greater than mine here I am out here in the city and they won't even come they won't invite me to come to their to their meetings anymore you chose the harder way but the harder way is my way oh my how many are willing to take the harder way today the harder way is his way it's God's way it's not the popular way it's not the way where you get the most money or the most Fame it's not the way where you're appreciated like you should be appreciated it's not the way of comfort and ease you're not going to retire as a you know a nice uh over you know just a you know just a soft lifestyle you got to be able to cut with the twoed sword all the days of your life you got to cut it you got to say things that are uncomfortable how many the people that love you people that encourage with you come up with these little ideas let's do this let's do that where'd you get that idea from where the next church is do let's do this let's do that you got to stay with the word amen it's the harder way Hallelujah but it is my way oh why don't you look at your neighbor and say the harder way say it like you mean it the harder way is God's way that's the way I want to go I want to go you know when he when he walked that rugged the the the the Via De La Rosa when he walked those steps where was The Fanboys at then where was all the people that he fed what about the lepers what about all the people that he rose them up in their life and helped them in their Ministry in their life where were they amen but it was God's way and he walked all by himself didn't he why did he walk all by himself so that you can walk by yourself if you have to remember you're never alone he's walking with you you're never alone he's a witness with you today Glory sometimes the doctors give you report and it's it's just going one way and all the examples is just going one way it looks like you're the only one standing but you're not alone you got Isaiah 53 1 through five that said he was wounded and bruised so that you can be healed amen sometimes you got to take a stand on the word everything is looking worse everything is looking crazy and traumatic but you stay with God's word and he will be with you it's the harder way but it's God's way amen glory to God Lord help me Hallelujah to stay in the heart way to stay with the vision all of them stay with the visions and the prophecies even the uncomfortable ones you hear Brother R talk about his third pool and he mentioned that so many times how many know he mentioned the tent Vision hold on don't say nothing about that Brothers don't say why not I love it somebody said open it up put put it on the table I want a bite I want a slice of that tell me some more about it go get the tape go get the tape and get the vision that the prophet brought and then you feed on that it's the harder way oh my I know when I say that people get nervous yeah they get nervous but that ain't my problem that's a them problem we ought to be rejoicing when we bring out amen man what church am I am anyway I hope I'm in God's Church there ain't no scripture or quotes that offend us or is there huh okay now but the Visions it's the harder way brother bam talked about this great ministry that would unfold in the last days he called it a bride and he saw the preview of her now he takes that in July of 1964 I shared a bit of it with you before I'll touch on it for you again here today and you said brother you preached on that before well you got you get the chance to say Amen again and then when you going to stop preaching on it when I'm raptured you won't have to hear about it no more when we're out of here we won't have to hear about it no more you see this is not radio content this is not a television series that I have to keep new fresh this is the word this is the word of the Lord I'm not writing a book I am re I'm preaching the gospel and every time you hear the word of the Lord it should be opening up something to you fresh and new every morning so I embrace this you know harder way is my way he has this you know experience that the The Voice spoke to him he had three Witnesses of people that didn't know him the the the person from the UN and then another person that was right there and uh uh I forget the third Witnesses but there were three witnesses that wrote it out this brother that was taking minutes of the meeting and they wrote out this prophecy it's the harder way and this will bring and come to pass the tremendous victory in love divine you might think you're preaching love but if it ain't the harder way it's really not love because Real Love is corrective now brother brandom deals with this um and I shared it with you all just a little bit on the influence what would be worse one woman that would come and influence one or two men or one woman ill dressed that would would influence an entire Congregation of women and we see this warning in Esther let's turn there quickly this thought was has been on my mind and I need to get it off okay and Esther that's in the Old Testament somebody please help us where is it at after 559 he said what kind of Bible is that that's scoffield okay 559 what' you say Miguel 559 tell me brother okay that's what he said yeah so if you got the scull fi Bible is 559 okay all right did that help some of you thank you brother Miguel that helped me all right this is the Book of Esther here we see um this young lady Esther coming into view in verse number two those days when the king harus aerus sat on the throne of his kingdom which is shushan the palace the third year of his Reign he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants in the power of Persia Mia and the Nobles and the princes of the promises being before him so he's making his great king and he's sh join all of his great Kingdom and so forth in these days were he it was a 7-Day feast or several days of a feast day and he's bringing it up to a highlight there and um verse seven they gave him drink in the vessels of gold the vessels being diverse one from another Royal Wine in abundance according to the state of the king and the drinking was according to the law none did compel for so the king had appointed to all the offic of his of officers of his house that they should do according to Every Man's pleasure also vashti the queen Made A Feast for the women in the Royal house which belongeth to the king somebody help me say that yeah okay just like me some of y'all got it some of you didn't and on the seventh day when the heart of the King was merry with wine commanded these men muham bisa harbona Bika abata zetar and carus the Seven chamberlains that served in the presence of uh aerus the king to bring vasy the queen before the king with the Crown Royal to show the people and the princes her beauty for she was fair to look on but the queen vashy refused to come at at the king's commandment and by his chamberlains therefore was the king very wroth and his anger burned in him I'm going to stop there just for a moment and in the um let's see if I could pick it up in the message marriage and divorce right before he gives um the release of what the Lord showed him him on the on the mountain there he mentions this woman here in paragraph 257 and it's a little place that you I want you to go and you read it and you go study it and you get a nice grip and handle on it for yourself I was going to read it here but I'll hold it and you get go get that paragraph 257 cuz the message marriage and divorce is very deep it's a lot to it there's a you know it's opening up he brings in what it was from the beginning then he brings in the polygamy and after the beginning and all the things that we see today and this was open up it's recorded on tape so you can hear it like more than one time for free and you can listen to it on your way wherever you're going and you can't understand it all that's not the point but the attitude should never be I don't understand at all so I'm not going to going to listen to none of it why was it recorded it's recorded for you to feed on it and hear it straighten out the two um extremes that he calls them one went on the right one went on the left and there were two extremes and he brings it that they both have a truth but the truth lays in the middle of the road and if you really look at all of the doctrines that he brings it all Lays in the middle of the road you can go on Extreme many things and you want to be balanced in any teaching or any Scripture you want to take all of it comprehensively everything that he says about it and not just be rigid in one way or the other and so maybe I'll slip in something here on on the music on the music program you know there's a there's a you know what you call Christian music and then you have you know you got you know different uh examples of people that call whatever they call Christian music and then you have cultures that have their certain style of music and then some like it fast some with it beat some with a little slow but you know it it still comes down to you got to have the Holy Spirit you got to have the Holy Spirit he leads you and guides you you're trying to Worship the Lord it can't just be because somebody else says it's wrong or somebody else says it's right you have the Holy Spirit you have the examples and you have the scriptures that tells you if it's okay or not and so when I first came into the message I'm not g to finish this today so I know that when I first came into the message it was just different very everything was different the the beat the offbeat the onbeat the say in my notes I'm just talking very different so what I did with all my music Good gospel music brother will I had a nice little Library I got rid of all of it please somebody give me them tapes back beautiful music music from my childhood it was cornbread it was beans it was flavor it was Mama's cooking and then I come out to a place when I'm not going to criticize but I was eating but it wasn't Mama's cooking talking about the music and so I got into that and this because everything I was doing quote unquote was wrong but you know you got to be led by the Holy Spirit you got to look and see what what and then look in the word look in the message actually and the message opened up to me that God made me the way that I am and I'm not supposed to try to be like somebody else house be what God made if God made me when I'm singing by myself this is how I sing now some of y'all can only see through the glasses when they on your head but it's other people can see too now and you need to travel a little bit that's probably what you need to do and you need to go to an orchestra and watch a Orchestra play and perform and it give you some range of difference and God is a god of variety huh is he what if everybody look like me y'all take off running right but God's a god of variety he made you exactly the way he made you all the details all the flaws all whatever it is he made you and he made every human being it's it's his design and it's beautiful when it stays in its original in it's the original way that God made it Satan can get in any of it sure can get in any of it okay so why we get into that but God's a god of variety and um he makes us and he gives us a uh H H he he leads us by the holy spirit amen so the message marriage and divorce is your message if you embrace it as yours and then you take that and you Embrace that for yourself sister you the way you dress and the way you go about and if you think it's somebody says it's too tight or it's it's looking worldly you need to talk to your husband about that because it is about him right or is it about you amen amen and so you should really talk to I mean right amen so so so it's got to make sense to you and preaching and reading a quote to you is not going to correct your heart and me reading any Vision to you is not going to correct your heart you have to be led by the Holy Spirit to do what you're doing and then when the holy spirit gives you the okay to do it you don't have to worry about getting permission from nobody else you just go forward this is you know this is why this what I like to do how I worship the Lord amen so now the prophet is bringing this here and this one little place in paragraph 258 as he's bringing this message and um and it's really really good it's a it's it's really caught me I've had to go back and and hear it several times and I did not bring my watch to the pull pit somebody say praise the Lord prise the Lord everybody didn't say praise the lord it's okay it's all right what time is it somebody just tell me quickly brother obey your pastor what time is it please 12:00 12 o' thank you thank you sis now answer the rest of the questions I asked too all right 12:00 no we're going to close just now so just get this point here in with Esther so she refuses now get get the point now she had her own party too now so the king had a party then she has her own party and then when the king tells her to do something she disobeys the king so what happens here then the king said to the wise men verse 13 which knew the times for so was the king's manner towards all that knew law and judgment and next unto him were these gentlemen as he speaks in verse 15 he says what shall we do unto the queen vashi according to the law because she had not performed the Commandment of the King aerus by the chamber liims and mman answered before the king and said answered before the king and the princes vases the queen hath not done wrong to the king only but also to all the the princes and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king of azerus for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes when it shall be reported the king azerus commanded vasi the queen to be brought in before him but she came not likewise shall the ladies of Persia and M us say this day shall say this day unto all the king's princes which have heard of the deed of the queen thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath if it please the king Let There Go a royal commandment from him let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the mes that it be not altered that vashi come no more before the king azerus and let the King give her Royal Estate unto another that is better than she and when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his Empire for it is great all the wives shall give give to their husbands honor both to Great and Small and the same pleased the king and the Princess and the King did according to the word of Muk man Muk KH for he sent letters into the king's prophet provinces to every Province according to the writing thereof to every people after their language that every man should bear rule in his own house and that it should be published according to the language of every people so this influence had to be stopped and it started you know it started with the head the head uh Lady of the lady of ladies she was the leader of all of these other nations her example and her to do this would cause a horrible influence to not just to this little Province but to all of the other ones too it sets a precedent so it's harsh he probably no doubt loved his wife his Queen she was beautiful but he had to make this law and in order to correct the error and in correcting any kind of error now you can start looking around and start getting you know make take it personal but it's not for you to take personal this is God's word you got to get you got to get it right because why why you'll be held accountable you men brothers you'll be held accountable how you hold your post of Duty you'll be held accountable to answer for your wife and your family that's what the Bible says and that's uncomfortable but that's what I have to remind you of and the prophet says I'll be held at the day of judgment for the things that I say and if I don't say it I'll be held at the day of judgment so he had to stay with that word and it was the harder way he preached the message on the west coast there and he's dealing with all of the sin in the West Coast Co and he he's talking about it in Jehovah Gyra 1961 he he says that in paragraph 48 and I'll close with this one here all right heal the sick Save The Lost get glory to thyself for it is all for your glory Lord It's not nothing to us we're just it's our sympathy our heart we feel that it helped the people it's something to help the church why would we be here would would be much better for me to be home this morning in my Tabernacle and with my wife and babies and them calling me on the phone crying being Lonesome and oh God have I spent 31 years of my life out on the field here how easy would would how easy it would for me to go home but God something down in my heart stays says stay there on the west coast where sin's abounding stay there where the wall for East and West is meeting like the wind sweeping across and blowing the contamination against this West Coast here where Cults and things is not known anywhere else in the country God why would we stand here because it's your commission how are we going to Break Down The Walls I don't know Lord but you're Jehovah Gyra that can provide hide yourself away we'll stand because in our hearts we feel that we could help your precious little church that's struggling along the coast among all this Hollywood glamour all of this other stuff God somehow you'll call your elected those who he forne he called those who he called he justified those who he justified he's already glorified lord they're here somewhere speak to them Lord as we work in labor and love to bring your church out of the chaos granted father amen that's what this message does it brings the church out of chaos so when you get to that marriage and divorce take paragraph 256 and brother man is bringing in there on the reasons or how um remarriage could be he brings up that example and he just leaves it like that and he brings the vision of the Bride July of 64 we don't have time to get into it we have time but I won't take it I'll just get a a a a quick definition for you here of what that preview of The Bride is it's an an inspection or viewing of something before is brought it becomes generally known and available to view or to show beforehand so he was given a preview of the rme receive or give a preview of to see hear or show something before it is available to the public so that Vision he saw the preview of the Bride he saw what she looked like before it was available to the public to give a general description of something that will happen in the future that's what a preview is to see an example example of what something will look like so this preview of The Bride where he sees her and how she was dressed and how she was walking and what she was wearing compared to what the other church was doing and it was a church we're not talking about people in the bar or people out there World we're talking about it was the other church was dancing to rock and roll music led by a witch they were still a part of the church they look horrible they're they're morally he saw them he said he was ashamed to look at them they were stripped with no clothes on in the name of the church and he said that's how God sees it and this age in this day brother and sister brother and sister if you're going to make it out of this age to be a part of the Bride for the rapture it is the harder way you will be in the minority and and you can't let other another church um you can't let another sister influence you on how you should dress my little sister or M and grandmas or whoever you might be because that's the influence I seen it I remember we moved to Montreal it was not a bad thing but you know come in one style of hair big braids and then another one get and before you know all the people have the same kind of style of hair and it just sister speaking of and then you'll see that and you just see these little things that that's alloud and aligned and so forth H H we have an example we've seen the preview didn't we the preview of the Bride go get that go read it it's before the public before it happened that Vision if it's true and we believe it is that's a preview of what we should be looking like and we should not be looking like the denominations huh God has given us an example we believe in the Holy Ghost signs wonders Miracles believe in the love of Christ we believe in being as nice and respectful as we can showing love to all people all men doors are open to anyone we'll cooperate with them but we don't compromise for no one God help us to stay in that narrow way God help us let us pray Heavenly Father we ask your blessings upon our service today word that we spoke Lord the harder way is your way as we're reminded of this great event that took place with the prophet in 1961 before the seals were even open and all of the other great happenings in Sabino Canyon and sunset Mountain and some of the great Revelations of who elzer was and who is this mezic and even some of the great visions of the great white horse Rider as a chief a Indian chief Vision speaking with authority and all these things are on tapes Lord youve recorded it for us and some people think they're the chief they think they're in charge but oh God we thank you for the recordings that we have it stored up for us today Lord and just to highlight this one little portion you walk in your own choosing it's the harder way but it is my way Lord let us walk that way is our prayer we ask these blessings in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you richly don't you love the Lord amen that I love you I than thank you Jesus for the grace that you have given us given [Music] us that I Lord I

to the prayer meeting I was listening to the the message on the lifeline app and brother Brandon was praying for he was talking about about the meeting with the president with Russia and he says that they have what it takes to blow America up and and so forth and he says but what's keeping it from happening he said it's the saints that there're still righteous people in this country and we know that's going to happen one day sometimes we think it's our own achievement or abilities but it's the holy spirit in The Believer that's keeping it from happening where are we at Saints look at the hour that we're live looking in look at the technology the AI and the the all of the things that are going on with the world and its condition and we know that we're in the end time and we know there is um coming a final finality if we have one more year two more years here am I prepared am I ready am I ready ready for the Rapture or something great to happen something to shift or to take place

Jesus name Lord help me amen let's stand to our feet we'll sing it one more time thank you Jesus Grace that you have given us though I can't repay like to say that I [Music] thank you amen we'll go to
