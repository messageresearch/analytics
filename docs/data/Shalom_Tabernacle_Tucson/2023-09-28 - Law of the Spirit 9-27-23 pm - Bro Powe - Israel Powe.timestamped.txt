[26:02] tonight um before we go to the Lord in
[26:05] prayer in Romans chapter
[26:08] 8 and then also we'll take of Psalms
[26:14] 51 Romans chapter
[26:24] 8 verses number one and two
[26:37] when you have that you can say amen
[26:40] amen therefore there is therefore now no
[26:45] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[26:48] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[26:52] after the spirit for the law of the
[26:55] spirit of life in Christ Jesus
[26:58] has made us free from the law of sin and
[27:02] death amen thank God for that we take
[27:05] one more scripture in Psalms 51 this is
[27:08] a prayer of
[27:09] Psalm a Psalm of
[27:14] David he's crying
[27:17] out in this
[27:25] Psalm he says have mercy upon me oh God
[27:29] according to thy loving kindness
[27:32] according unto the multitude of thy
[27:33] Tender Mercies blot out my
[27:37] transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from
[27:40] my iniquity cleanse me from my sin for I
[27:44] acknowledge my transgression and my sin
[27:47] is ever before me against thee the only
[27:52] have I sinned and done this evil in thy
[27:55] sight that thou mightest be justified
[27:58] when thou speaketh and be clear when
[28:01] thou judgest behold I was shapen in
[28:04] iniquity and in send that my mother
[28:06] conceive me behold thou desireth truth
[28:09] in the inward parts and in the hidden
[28:11] part thou shal make me to know wisdom
[28:15] Purge me with his up and I shall be
[28:18] clean wash me and I shall be whiter than
[28:22] snow amen we like to take a little uh
[28:26] subject this evening on the uh law of
[28:29] the spirit and I trust it to be a
[28:32] blessing to you you can be seated law of
[28:35] the spirit and we're going to go a
[28:37] little bit further into this Jacob's
[28:40] Latter that we spoke on uh Sunday
[28:43] morning we thank the Lord that he has
[28:47] given us his word to live by amen and
[28:51] there's
[28:52] laws there's laws of the land there's
[28:55] laws in science there's the laws of
[28:59] electricity and
[29:00] gravitation and you have to respect
[29:02] those laws and then God has laws too
[29:05] they're laws in the spirit and we
[29:08] believe those laws that we just don't
[29:11] make them up as we go they're actually
[29:14] principles that God will honor that's
[29:16] his in his word and so we we take these
[29:19] keys from the word as we try to na
[29:22] navigate through this life I'm going to
[29:25] take and read a quote here in the
[29:27] message show us the father and it shall
[29:29] satisfy
[29:31] 1956 paragraph number 31 brother random
[29:35] says this now listen at this let me give
[29:38] you a little illustration here's a crop
[29:40] over on this hill and it's burning up
[29:43] for water can you hear me a crop on this
[29:46] hill are burning up for water and over
[29:48] on this hill you own both Hills and over
[29:52] on here's an artisian well just spurting
[29:55] up water going to waste now what if you
[29:59] stand out there and say I want this
[30:01] water to come over on my crops water I
[30:05] command you to go over there on my crops
[30:08] water I command you to go over there on
[30:10] my crops it'll never go over certainly
[30:13] not but there is a law of gravitation
[30:17] sure now if you can get the water over
[30:20] here if you'll work it the right way if
[30:23] you work according to the laws of
[30:26] gravitation you can bring that water
[30:28] around the mountain and throw it right
[30:31] on this side and irrigate that whole
[30:34] crop is that right you stand out there
[30:37] screaming water come over here water
[30:40] come over here it won't do it but if you
[30:42] work according to the laws of
[30:44] gravitation you get your water over
[30:47] there but you've got to work according
[30:49] to the laws of
[30:51] gravitation I mean I can imagine some of
[30:53] our prayers are like that we're
[30:55] screaming for things to happen happen or
[30:57] for God to do things or changes to be
[31:00] made in our life but there's a law that
[31:03] that of the spirit we got to work
[31:05] according to the the laws of the spirit
[31:08] just as we would in gravitation now Ben
[31:10] Franklin once said that there's enough
[31:13] electricity in a room to blow it up if
[31:16] the heat and so forth was separated the
[31:19] heat from the heat from the cold making
[31:21] the lightning or the electric now what
[31:24] if I stood out in the middle of one of
[31:25] these Great Big Woods night out here on
[31:28] the mountain you were saying oh
[31:30] electricity I'm lost out
[31:33] here I can't see a thing
[31:36] there you're here electricity I know
[31:39] you're here so all you electricity come
[31:42] on and light up the way and make me a
[31:44] way out the the electricity is there
[31:48] that's true but you don't get it that
[31:50] way you have to work according to the
[31:53] laws of electricity is that right if
[31:56] that electricity is brought down run
[31:59] through a generator out to a light it'll
[32:02] light the way to show you out yes but
[32:05] you got to work according to the laws of
[32:08] electricity the same way it is by God
[32:12] here's a sick man dying the doctor can
[32:14] do no more for him but he can he can't
[32:17] just holler hey Jesus I want you to come
[32:20] and heal me say I'm going to do this
[32:23] that won't work you got to work
[32:25] according to the laws of the spirit
[32:28] that's right see you got to work
[32:31] according to God's
[32:34] laws amen how many you know God has laws
[32:37] and those laws are his word and those
[32:41] laws are put in his word and they're
[32:44] there for a
[32:46] purpose they're not there just for us to
[32:48] memorize or hear them spoken to us
[32:51] that's good to memorize them that's good
[32:53] to hear them spoken but they're there to
[32:55] put in practice in our life we come to
[32:58] church and we come not to just hear a
[33:01] sermon but we come to hear words that we
[33:05] can put in practice for our Liv amen
[33:08] amen that's right I mean doable workable
[33:12] manageable pieces from the word that you
[33:15] can apply to your life maybe you know it
[33:18] or you heard it before but this time you
[33:20] hear it you're leaving out to find where
[33:23] can I actually make this work in my life
[33:27] how can I change my behavior based on
[33:31] what I just heard based on the word that
[33:34] I just heard and we know what A good
[33:36] sermon sounds like we know what an
[33:38] anointed Ministry sounds like and things
[33:41] that are said that can maybe tickle our
[33:44] ears and our desires and we'll know that
[33:46] it's good and we say that was a
[33:48] tremendous service God spoke to us but
[33:51] then we'll leave out and not even really
[33:54] put it into practice and I think that's
[33:56] a danger I think that that the reason
[33:59] why the word was spoken to you so you
[34:01] can grab it amen and then apply it in
[34:04] your life amen and so these are these
[34:09] are laws so Genesis 28:12 I read a
[34:12] scripture there Old Testament scripture
[34:14] about Jacob how many remember it that he
[34:17] was fell into this dream and then the
[34:21] dream he saw a a ladder going up to
[34:23] heaven and above the ladder God stood up
[34:26] there
[34:27] and then and he saw angels coming up and
[34:30] down that
[34:32] ladder we fast forward it and saw that
[34:36] in St John chapter 1 our lord Jesus is
[34:38] now speaking to a man had just come to
[34:41] him he showed him some things in his
[34:44] life and that really excited him about
[34:47] the things of the Lord that this man
[34:49] could know him he said that excited you
[34:51] he said from here forth you'll see
[34:54] Angels ascending and descend descending
[34:57] upon the son of man now uh we read some
[35:01] quotes we went One Direction there for
[35:03] you on Sunday and this evening I want to
[35:06] take a few quotes here in what brother
[35:09] random says about this Jacob's Ladder
[35:12] all right and this is in the message um
[35:15] the faith of Abraham paragraph number 53
[35:18] he says this here I trust this to bless
[35:21] you I trust that you would look at that
[35:24] scripture differently I don't think you
[35:26] know those scriptures Genesis 28 and
[35:29] John 1 are not just Parables so as to
[35:32] talk about it's something that I can
[35:34] actually oh that's what that
[35:37] means and so today this is what I'm
[35:39] going to do based on what that scripture
[35:42] said there all
[35:44] right I was baptized by the Holy Spirit
[35:47] same one was upon
[35:49] Abraham baptized me in the same body I'm
[35:52] heir of every one of the promises if
[35:54] something looks just a little bit bit
[35:57] High I go get me a step ladder and get
[36:00] on it and examine it see what it looks
[36:03] like that's the way if Divine Healing
[36:06] seems to be a little out of my reach I
[36:10] got to get on my
[36:12] knees that's Jacob's Ladder and climb
[36:17] right on up in prayer till I find out
[36:20] what it's all about see see what I own
[36:24] it's mine it's yours it's all of
[36:28] youed if you believe it you was baptized
[36:32] by the grace of God into this great big
[36:34] arcade that got every Redemptive
[36:37] blessing in it everything Jesus died for
[36:40] is right here in the body of Christ
[36:43] healing salvation joy peace all these
[36:47] things belongs to you it's
[36:50] yours let the devil say oh don't you do
[36:53] it don't you do it that's that old nasty
[36:56] Porter at the door don't you believe in
[36:59] that walk right on in it's yours you got
[37:04] a pass you got an abstract Deed on the
[37:07] place if sickness dwells in there you
[37:10] got an abstract deed if you went home
[37:12] tonight and what if there's an enemy
[37:15] sitting in your house and the enemy said

[39:36] found out Divine Healing was mine Joy
[39:39] was mine Rivers flowing of life eternal
[39:42] power eternal life Grace all these
[39:46] things belong to me something looked a
[39:49] little high I got me a ladder and
[39:51] climbed up and pulled up and looked at
[39:54] it that's right if you see something
[39:56] something that I can't reach if I see
[39:58] something that I can't reach I just keep
[40:00] on praying on Jacob's Ladder till I get
[40:04] up there and look at it yes Lord I see
[40:09] where you give Visions The Works that I
[40:11] do shall you do also these things that I
[40:14] do shall you do also amen prophet of God
[40:18] says in the message forsaking all 1962
[40:21] my last one on this he says this
[40:25] here
[40:27] paragraph number
[40:29] 995 that's what's the matter with
[40:31] Christians tonight God gives it to us
[40:35] but we're afraid to investigate it when
[40:39] you become a Christian you're air to
[40:42] every promise in the Bible now can I say
[40:46] that tonight that if we're Christians
[40:48] we're air to every promise in the
[40:52] message we believe the message don't we
[40:55] so every promise in the message belongs
[40:58] to the believer now the next guy might
[41:01] say we don't believe in that day or that
[41:03] day is pass but as a Believer the
[41:06] message becomes yours the Bible becomes
[41:11] yours and if there's something in the
[41:13] message or in the Bible that's a little
[41:16] too high that it's not in your realm
[41:18] then what do you do you don't complain
[41:20] about it you don't you know say it
[41:22] doesn't uh uh it doesn't work anymore
[41:25] you don't disbel know you get down on
[41:27] your knees and getting down on your
[41:29] knees it's for the purpose of climbing
[41:33] up higher so your faith can reach the
[41:36] point that that is mine and it's mine
[41:39] now I believe it I receive it brother
[41:42] bam calls that Jacob's Ladder so tonight
[41:46] we're about to get on Jacob's Ladder
[41:48] those of
[41:50] us that believe
[41:53] that these things Bel belong to us
[41:56] everything that God promis is yours it's
[41:58] just like a great big arcade by one
[42:00] spirit all baptized into this arcade
[42:03] which is Christ if somebody give me
[42:05] something I'm going to look around and
[42:08] find out what I own I think that's what
[42:10] Christians ought to do tonight find out
[42:13] what you've got if something gets a
[42:15] little high up that I can't reach it
[42:19] I'll get me a step ladder and climb up
[42:21] to it and if it seems a little Out Of
[42:23] Reach in the Bible that God has promised
[42:26] I'll stay on my knees and climb Jacob's
[42:29] Ladder till I reach it because it's mine
[42:32] God gave it to me if Divine Healing is
[42:35] Promised in the Bible and I'm sick I'll
[42:37] stay there till God gives it to me cuz
[42:39] it's a promise God promis I forsake the
[42:42] world he'll give me the Holy Ghost I'll
[42:44] stay right there till he gives it to me
[42:47] because he promised it if God promised
[42:49] to give me the desire of my heart and
[42:51] the desire of my heart is the right
[42:53] thing I'll stay there till God
[42:56] gives it because it's a promise and I
[43:00] forsaken all the world I want to walk
[43:03] after him and if he'll pay I know that
[43:06] to be the truth it's exactly right what
[43:09] did he do he forsook his land his
[43:12] country God give him the entire Province
[43:15] the whole continent of
[43:18] Palestine amen so this law one of these
[43:22] laws of the spirit is a life of prayer
[43:27] it's this is a prayer life it's not new
[43:30] news but it's very valuable
[43:33] news it's not a new thing that we never
[43:35] heard before as a Christian a Christian
[43:38] reads his Bible and prays every day but
[43:43] prayer isn't just you know it isn't just
[43:47] us uh spending time on our knees and
[43:50] saying a few words prayer is getting
[43:53] into an
[43:55] atmosphere when Jacob got out of that
[43:58] presence from that dream he said surely
[44:01] the Lord is in this place and this is
[44:04] the place that a Believer you can never
[44:08] pray too much I can actually preach too
[44:12] much and what I can be saying can be
[44:14] right out of the Bible I can sing too
[44:17] much and the songs that I would be
[44:18] singing will be correctly with the word
[44:21] I can talk too much I can do a lot of
[44:24] things too much in our service here but
[44:27] there's one thing we can't do too much
[44:30] and it's the law of God and it's part of
[44:33] who we are and that's praying because
[44:36] when we're praying that's bringing us to
[44:39] the level where God can give us the
[44:42] things that we have need of first we see
[44:45] it in the word as a promise and then we
[44:48] know that that promise is is it belongs
[44:52] to us and then we say okay I see this
[44:56] believer have it I see it in the Bible I
[44:59] see it in you know brother brandom's
[45:01] Ministry maybe then I'll see a brother
[45:03] or sister in our church that has it then
[45:06] I say well maybe I can have that too you
[45:09] know and then I can hope for it I can
[45:11] think and wishful thinking all of that
[45:13] that's good but I got to get down on my
[45:15] knees and actually pray for it and
[45:18] believe God for it even for the simple
[45:21] things I go brother random says here in
[45:25] um
[45:26] 1953 take a few quotations here and he's
[45:30] talking about
[45:31] prayer and he
[45:34] says
[45:36] uh in the message the revelation of
[45:38] Jesus
[45:40] Christ paragraph 53 now the thing that
[45:43] thing creeped down until another age and
[45:46] finally it come out then we notice as
[45:49] the church become out into the
[45:50] Reformation it pulled off and pulled off
[45:53] from that time and got away from the
[45:55] spirit got away away from the spirit
[45:57] right on down until this last age when
[45:59] it's ready to consolidate itself and
[46:02] make an image unto the
[46:04] beast but that little Spirit shall live
[46:07] in the hearts of people until Jesus
[46:10] comes it's got to be bear that in mind
[46:15] we'll draw it out on the maps take the
[46:16] history and everything and show you
[46:18] that's it exactly that way let you take
[46:21] the history yourself and read it see
[46:22] what the Bible said and then what the
[46:24] history said see how it meets just
[46:26] exactly I like that oh may we all now
[46:30] just take may we all not just take this
[46:34] as a lecture but may we
[46:37] solemnly solemnly take the warnings of
[46:41] the Holy Spirit and pray day and night
[46:47] don't let nothing stop you from
[46:52] praying that's that's a solemn warning
[46:55] yes sir it's a simple warning but a
[46:59] powerful one it's a simple warning but
[47:02] it's very clear it's actually a warning
[47:05] we'd heard before it's a warning that
[47:08] Jesus told us he said the don't let that
[47:11] day come upon you unawares like a trap
[47:15] will ens snare you and then you know the
[47:19] eating and the drinking and the cares of
[47:21] this life will catch you like a trap you
[47:24] know what a trap is don't you
[47:26] a trap is set there's bait there there's
[47:28] a familiarity whatever you're trying to
[47:31] trap it makes it he feels comfortable
[47:33] that squirrel or that bird or the deer
[47:36] or a pig whatever you're trying to trap
[47:38] it's it gets to where you know it's a
[47:40] little and then you got the bait out
[47:41] there and then you and then you set it
[47:43] up to where he gets into an environment
[47:45] where he doesn't even know doesn't even
[47:49] know until bam the cage door
[47:53] closes and Jesus talk talked about the
[47:56] day that we lived in and he told us to
[47:59] watch and
[48:02] pray and it's true it's probably one of
[48:06] the hardest things that we can do to
[48:08] keep up on is our prayer life am I
[48:11] talking to myself yes sir yes sir how
[48:14] many know what I'm talking
[48:16] about to pray day and night so you're
[48:20] not caught so you're not caught with
[48:23] with with with your guards down
[48:26] yeah we're not talking about sinful
[48:27] things we're not talking about you know
[48:29] drinking in the things of the world of
[48:31] course we don't do those things we're
[48:33] just talking
[48:35] about not being caught up in your prayer
[48:39] life a
[48:41] warning it is a law of the spirit I
[48:45] can't I can't move up in God if I don't
[48:48] have a prayer life I'm not going to be
[48:51] sealed by the Holy Ghost I'm not going
[48:54] in the rapture without a prayer life I
[48:57] can't receive the Holy Ghost if I don't
[49:00] have a prayer life what's the next great
[49:03] thing you need in your life I guarantee
[49:06] you it will be acquired through your
[49:08] prayer life it's a
[49:11] law and many of us break it I break it
[49:15] we break that
[49:16] law but it's a law that God's not going
[49:19] to
[49:21] break we get in it it'll dig up our Liv
[49:26] Liv we get in it it'll it'll dig up the
[49:29] lives of those great men back there how
[49:31] they sacrifice you'll see how little
[49:34] you've done makes me feel ashamed of
[49:38] myself sometimes how we have to
[49:41] everything is so easy and they had
[49:43] everything so hard wondered about Paul
[49:47] said in Hebrews 11 sheep skins goatskins
[49:50] tormented Afflicted destitute what will
[49:53] our testimony stand bes besides theirs
[49:56] how will it be up besides of that and we
[49:59] have to have everything so
[50:04] nice here the prophet of God goes into
[50:06] the message the way of the true prophet
[50:08] he says this here this will come to our
[50:11] Psalms 53 scripture he says I do believe
[50:15] in a Purgatory Purgatory but I believe
[50:19] it's right
[50:20] now you purge your own soul Purgatory
[50:24] means to to purge when you see you done
[50:28] something wrong get out there and clean
[50:30] it out of You by confession and crying
[50:35] and fasting and
[50:39] praying someone even laughed at me when
[50:41] the Lord came here not long ago and give
[50:44] me a vision I've always wanted to see
[50:45] about binding that serpent I've always
[50:48] wondered how to I should step out like
[50:51] that when that's what I've wanted all my
[50:54] life then and I began to fast and pray
[50:56] he said what do you do that for I said
[50:59] in there he said I was not sincere
[51:02] enough after he come then I wanted to
[51:05] purge myself not wait till you die let
[51:09] some priest try to purge you purge your
[51:13] soul Amen brother random continues in
[51:17] the message the um testimony on the sea
[51:21] paragraph
[51:23] 127 brother random was talking he's
[51:25] talking about zachus and Rebecca his
[51:28] wife how she was praying for him to be
[51:32] saved the Lord was coming his way for
[51:35] dinner and he kind of gives a drama on
[51:37] it and he says this here paragraph 127
[51:39] so the
[51:41] morning that he was to appear Rebecca
[51:43] must have prayed all night for her
[51:45] husband she wanted him to be saved
[51:48] that's the way you got to pray for
[51:51] people Prayer Changes Things so she must
[51:56] have prayed all night along about
[51:58] daylight little old zakus got up and put
[52:01] on his best clothes that he had you know
[52:03] and stepped out just told Rebecca he was
[52:06] going to get a fresh breath of air but
[52:08] that night maybe the Lord had been
[52:10] dealing with him according to Rebecca's
[52:14] thoughts and prayer now if you want God
[52:17] to save your husband or your wife just
[52:22] keep praying for them just keep praying
[52:25] that's all you have to do just keep
[52:30] praying and believing if there's any
[52:33] spark of Life there at all God will P
[52:36] put something across their path that
[52:39] they'll see it then if they reject it
[52:42] then that's up to
[52:46] them so we just keep praying don't we
[52:49] want to see a loved one
[52:51] saved you want to fight with them you
[52:53] want to argue with them you want to
[52:55] force them you want to dialogue with
[52:58] them and bring up things you know they
[53:00] disagree about no no pray for them it's
[53:04] a tremendous weapon it actually changes
[53:08] things you pray for your son your
[53:13] daughter pray for your brother and your
[53:16] sisters and those nieces and
[53:19] nephews and those family members that
[53:22] are not safe pray for them
[53:26] believe God it's the best thing you can
[53:28] do for him is call on God the law of the
[53:33] spirit is that when we pray he will hear
[53:37] us the scripture says that we know that
[53:39] if we pray that he will hear us and
[53:44] answer us amen you believe that tonight
[53:47] amen is this a prayer meeting yes it is
[53:50] a prayer meeting praise God Amen the
[53:54] message in indictment paragraph 265
[53:57] prophet of God says this here now what
[54:00] did they do they didn't know it today
[54:02] men walk ignorantly they don't know
[54:05] that's the truth they think it's some
[54:08] kind of ism they don't dig down deep
[54:11] enough to get into the spirit of
[54:12] Revelation they don't pray enough they
[54:16] don't call upon God
[54:19] enough
[54:24] uhhuh
[54:26] let me read two more quotations for you
[54:29] all
[54:30] right and this is in the law of the
[54:32] spirit here brother brandom is taking
[54:34] this out of questions and
[54:36] answers paragraph 105 just about done
[54:40] here Paul said My
[54:43] Flesh wants always to yield to that your
[54:47] flesh does
[54:50] too see but the law of the spirit of God
[54:53] in the heart overcomes the Flesh and
[54:57] makes the body obey what the heart says
[55:00] do hallelujah look then if it will do
[55:04] that for a sinner then won't that work
[55:07] for sickness too the law of the spirit
[55:10] of God in the heart that knows that by
[55:13] his stripes we're healed they stand with
[55:16] their their power and make that sickness
[55:19] in that body obey them because it's a
[55:21] devil there you are whool that's got
[55:26] cream on it that deep I tell you that's
[55:28] it see now the law of sin and death
[55:32] works in your flesh but the law of the
[55:35] spirit of Life Works in your heart so
[55:39] your heart your your so your heart your
[55:44] spirit in your heart will make your body
[55:47] obey what it says do that's exactly
[55:49] right and that's what Paul said always
[55:52] the flesh I'm too tired I'm unable I'm
[55:56] not sufficient I cannot do it I said to
[55:59] Lois or Dolores or somebody that's been
[56:02] talking to me about the Holy Ghost about
[56:04] something or other like that I said the
[56:06] Lord said what made me feel that way
[56:08] just the time I should have felt good I
[56:12] said the Devil he's seen you just ready
[56:15] to receive it he said I'll put a little
[56:18] damper on her pH fan her a little bit
[56:22] you know kind of cool down a little see
[56:25] but oh my that's when you rise and claim
[56:29] your god-given rights that's what Paul
[56:32] was meaning see always when he said when
[56:35] I would do good evil is pre present so
[56:39] brother vom is talking about how the law
[56:41] works in your flesh but the law of the
[56:45] spirit is what's in your heart and the
[56:48] law of the spirit in your heart will
[56:51] overcome the law of your flesh and the
[56:54] law of your flesh is lazy doesn't want
[56:56] to pray it's too tired doesn't want to
[57:00] struggle doesn't want to fight for it
[57:02] wants everything instant instant instant
[57:05] but the law that's in your heart will
[57:08] stay there until you start to rise up
[57:12] that
[57:13] ladder rise up into the spirit and start
[57:16] claiming your God given privileges
[57:21] amen the restoration of the Bride tree
[57:24] the prophet says this paragraph 89 the
[57:27] law of the land is to enforce it's by
[57:30] the land for the
[57:33] land but the law of the spirit of God is
[57:35] to force Satan to give that which he has
[57:40] unrightfully deceitfully taken from God
[57:43] Souls of men he took from God Souls of
[57:46] women children sickness of the body he
[57:48] placed upon people where God Made Them
[57:50] In His Image to be like him and the
[57:53] church is given the rightful legal
[57:55] rights by the Bible to take the Holy
[57:58] Spirit and enforce this upon him now
[58:03] that's a law in the spirit can we can we
[58:06] see it that way can we receive it that
[58:09] way it's a law in the spirit to take
[58:14] what God has rightfully given to you and
[58:18] claim it and enforce it to take place
[58:22] and how long should we do that we do
[58:24] that until God calls us off the Earth we
[58:26] do that until we receive what we're
[58:28] asking for we don't let up on that
[58:31] because God is in control he gives us
[58:34] the promise he reveal he he re uh
[58:38] reveals that word to us that promise to
[58:40] us and then we take that to the Lord in
[58:44] prayer and we can't have a selfish
[58:46] motive or selfish um um objective in our
[58:51] hearts it's got to be hum humility it's
[58:54] got to be God's perfect will for our
[58:56] life James 4 speaks very clearly of this
[59:00] in James chapter 4 it's really talking
[59:03] of prayer if you take a portion of that
[59:07] uh uh James chapter 4 and one and you
[59:10] bring it all the way down he says from
[59:11] whence come Wars and fightings among
[59:14] you come they not hence even of your own
[59:18] lust that war in your members you lust
[59:22] and you have not you killed and Des
[59:24] desire to have and cannot obtain you
[59:27] fight and War yet you have not
[59:32] because see you cannot pretend you fight
[59:34] you War yet you have not because you ask
[59:37] not you ask and receive not because you
[59:41] ask a miss that you may consume it upon
[59:45] your lust you adulterers and
[59:48] adulteresses know ye not that the
[59:51] Friendship of the world is enmity with
[59:53] God whosoever therefore will be a friend
[59:56] of the world is the enemy of God do you
[59:59] think that the scripture saith in vain
[1:00:01] that the spirit that dwelleth in us
[1:00:03] lusteth to Envy but he giveth more grace
[1:00:07] wherefore he saith God resisteth the
[1:00:10] proud but giveth Grace unto the humble
[1:00:15] that's a law in God did you know that
[1:00:18] the arival spirit that's what got Satan
[1:00:22] kicked out of heaven right that Pride
[1:00:26] was lifted up in his heart he had
[1:00:28] everything it looks like he should have
[1:00:30] been happy God had given him the right
[1:00:32] hand man he was a right hand to God and
[1:00:36] pride had got so that he did everything
[1:00:40] but he couldn't create and he couldn't
[1:00:43] receive worship like God but he wanted
[1:00:45] people to he wanted the angels to
[1:00:47] worship him remember in I think it's
[1:00:49] Revelations 12 when he was kicked out of
[1:00:52] heaven and the the Bible says Satan and
[1:00:56] his angels now Satan didn't have any
[1:01:00] angels of his own that he created he
[1:01:02] created nothing but he took angels He
[1:01:06] deceived angels and those angels came on
[1:01:10] his bandwagon with his agenda and that
[1:01:14] Spirit you'll see it it rose up in W
[1:01:17] with with with with Moses in Kora Kora
[1:01:21] still up says why Moses you're the only
[1:01:23] one you're the only holy one see with
[1:01:26] Judas that spirit rose up and you see
[1:01:30] that spirit and that Spirit wants to get
[1:01:33] on us
[1:01:35] too this why we God resists the proud
[1:01:39] proud heart you know you can be saying
[1:01:42] the right things and you could be
[1:01:44] Desiring something that is Honorable but
[1:01:46] if your heart has pride in it God
[1:01:50] resists that and James 4 makes it very
[1:01:53] clear he says wherefore he said God
[1:01:56] resist the proud but he giveth Grace
[1:01:59] unto the humble and then what does he
[1:02:01] say verse seven submit yourselves
[1:02:03] therefore to God resist the devil and
[1:02:06] he'll flee from you draw nigh to God and
[1:02:10] he'll draw nigh to you cleanse your
[1:02:13] hands that's purging again you Sinners
[1:02:17] and purify your hearts you double minded
[1:02:21] be afflicted mourn weep let your after
[1:02:24] be turned to morning your joy to
[1:02:26] heaviness humble yourself in the sight
[1:02:29] of the Lord and he'll do what and he
[1:02:33] will lift you up you know this prayer in
[1:02:39] our prayer should be the Lord allowing
[1:02:43] the Lord to purge US during this
[1:02:47] time
[1:02:49] lord Purge me with
[1:02:52] hisp and I'll be clean wash me and I'll
[1:02:56] be wider than snow this was a cry of
[1:02:59] David's heart after he made a tremendous
[1:03:02] mistake in his life and he got down in
[1:03:05] prayer and he asked the Lord to purge
[1:03:08] him and this is scripture the the the
[1:03:11] Purgatory you know the Catholicism I'm
[1:03:13] not very clear on what they believe on
[1:03:15] that some things I do know but on the
[1:03:17] Purgatory I get the understanding that
[1:03:20] that Purgatory is the place that dead
[1:03:23] the people that lived in they died
[1:03:26] there's still a chance for them to be
[1:03:27] saved through
[1:03:29] purgatory and the people that are alive
[1:03:32] can pay so much money as they're being
[1:03:35] purged through this Purgatory time
[1:03:37] something like that something I'm not
[1:03:39] real clear on it but of course you got
[1:03:41] to be dead in order for this cleansing
[1:03:43] to take place and brother Bron makes
[1:03:45] that very clear he believes in purgatory
[1:03:48] but it's right now it's like Wednesday
[1:03:51] night it's Purgatory it's where we per
[1:03:54] Purge our hearts from worldly desires
[1:03:59] and even the things you know before you
[1:04:02] speak a word it's a thought first we
[1:04:06] want the Lord to purge our thoughts you
[1:04:10] know the words are what we said and
[1:04:12] somebody maybe caught us cuz we said it
[1:04:15] but if we thought something that ain't
[1:04:16] right don't you want God to purge my
[1:04:19] thinking Purge it before it becomes a
[1:04:22] word Purge me with his up Purge me with
[1:04:26] the blood Purge me Lord with your
[1:04:30] word that I can be
[1:04:33] cleansed wash me that I can be wider
[1:04:37] than
[1:04:38] snow it's interesting how the James 4 is
[1:04:41] talking to Believers he's talking about
[1:04:43] the wars that's amongst them and this
[1:04:46] envy and fighting and only through
[1:04:48] contention through pride is contention
[1:04:52] comes through the pride I think brother
[1:04:54] Joel brought that out to the men yeah I
[1:04:56] think proverbs 10 I believe it is that
[1:04:58] it's through Pride that we start flexing
[1:05:02] against one another that's a heart
[1:05:05] problem that's something wrong in your
[1:05:08] heart because you desire more than what
[1:05:12] you're supposed to
[1:05:14] have
[1:05:16] or you think that you should be you know
[1:05:19] more respected better or more
[1:05:22] acknowledged or you know more whatever
[1:05:24] it is whatever the contention is coming
[1:05:27] where does it come from from your own
[1:05:28] heart he tells us from whence come the
[1:05:31] wars and fighting among you why are you
[1:05:33] fighting among yourself come they not
[1:05:36] hint of the own lust that wore inside of
[1:05:41] you so where's the purgey need to be we
[1:05:44] look good we look clean but some of us
[1:05:47] need the inside cleansed
[1:05:50] out
[1:05:51] amen Purge Me Lord
[1:05:55] Purge my thoughts Purge what I really
[1:05:58] want let it be about
[1:06:01] you purge my desires let it be about
[1:06:05] you purge my reputation let it be about
[1:06:09] you purge my Ministry let it be about
[1:06:12] you my Praise My Worship whatever I'm
[1:06:15] doing in the name of the Lord Purge me
[1:06:20] Lord that it would be
[1:06:22] pure that it will be
[1:06:25] clean that it will be
[1:06:28] right and
[1:06:30] then I can come to
[1:06:33] you with a humble
[1:06:36] heart you know when Satan made his great
[1:06:39] move against God and I have to close
[1:06:41] now when Satan made his great move
[1:06:45] against
[1:06:47] God the Bible says that iniquity was
[1:06:50] found in his
[1:06:51] heart he operated with with this great
[1:06:54] power he's beautiful actually the most
[1:06:57] beautiful you think he would have been
[1:06:59] happy to be the most beautiful the most
[1:07:03] talented the closest to God all of these
[1:07:07] pluses all the jewels in the Carles that
[1:07:11] that Ezekiel 28 explains all the beauty
[1:07:13] that was found in his being he was an
[1:07:16] anointed cherub he led to worship he had
[1:07:20] the best position of all the angels and
[1:07:23] it wasn't n't enough because his heart
[1:07:26] wasn't right and if your heart ain't
[1:07:28] right doesn't matter what position you
[1:07:30] get it doesn't matter what anybody
[1:07:32] throws at you or gives you if your heart
[1:07:34] ain't right you ain't right and until
[1:07:38] your heart gets right you'll never be
[1:07:43] right Purge My Heart Lord Purge my
[1:07:47] motives Pur my
[1:07:49] desires Purge the innermost underlining
[1:07:53] under lining being of who I am my
[1:07:56] Essence Purge that Lord and let it be
[1:08:01] clean and Satan had all of
[1:08:04] this and if the individual's heart ain't
[1:08:07] right they'll gripe and
[1:08:09] complain you give it to them wait a few
[1:08:13] minutes a week or two they'll be griping
[1:08:16] and complaining about something else why
[1:08:19] it's a heart
[1:08:20] problem Paul
[1:08:22] said
[1:08:25] whatever state I find myself let me be
[1:08:29] what let me be
[1:08:31] content this man's in a
[1:08:34] prison this man got the greatest
[1:08:36] Ministry outside of the Apostles and
[1:08:39] he's talking like in a prison he should
[1:08:41] be he should have his own church all
[1:08:44] bills paid Paul we talking about Paul
[1:08:48] who went to the third heaven Paul who
[1:08:51] was visited by the Lord himself and here
[1:08:54] he is in the prison broke about he got
[1:08:57] beaten twice 39 Stripes his life he was
[1:09:02] stoned he's in the prison broke nothing
[1:09:06] no Fanfare nothing people trying to take
[1:09:08] his life and here he's talking about
[1:09:11] that whatever state I find
[1:09:13] myself I'll be
[1:09:15] content that's a man of God that's a
[1:09:19] servant of God that's an
[1:09:22] example of a true servant thank God for
[1:09:27] him I was reading the other
[1:09:30] day something that the historians say
[1:09:32] and mostly all of them agree that Jesus
[1:09:36] is the people that went to hear Jesus
[1:09:38] 90% of
[1:09:40] them were
[1:09:43] illiterate dumb people people that
[1:09:46] couldn't read I mean the known world it
[1:09:49] was not the known world wasn't real
[1:09:51] literate you had to you educated people
[1:09:54] that are liter but most of his disciples
[1:09:56] were ignorant and unar
[1:09:58] unlearned they didn't know how to argue
[1:10:01] laws of Moses fighting with people
[1:10:04] arguing but they had the spirit of God
[1:10:07] in them and they had a revelation of who
[1:10:10] Jesus was and they knew who they were in
[1:10:15] God they had a revel isn't that what we
[1:10:17] want isn't that what we
[1:10:18] desire it's not what we know what we
[1:10:22] know sometimes lifts us up in
[1:10:25] Pride because we know more than you or
[1:10:29] them so we get lifted up and Paul was
[1:10:32] the only really smart one among
[1:10:35] them and God had G him so many
[1:10:38] Revelations that he had to
[1:10:41] drop this sickness in his
[1:10:44] body he said because of the abundance of
[1:10:47] the Revelation the Lord had to and the
[1:10:49] Revelation and the sickness in his body
[1:10:51] kept him humble didn't it
[1:10:55] amen Lord keep us humble purging with
[1:10:58] hisp it's a law of the spirit and we're
[1:11:01] going to call on God tonight in this law
[1:11:04] of prayer if you don't have it you can

[1:11:47] start to think of this getting in
[1:11:51] contact with you this anointed
[1:11:54] ladder where the spirit of the Lord is

[1:12:19] on in the position to be raised up to
[1:12:22] the level
[1:12:24] that we need for the
[1:12:26] things that the word has told us are
[1:12:29] that belong to us these great promises
[1:12:33] that the law of the spirit is to enforce
[1:12:36] those promises to come back to
