[54:10] family are here in Tucson with my
[54:13] hometown I was born here but it sure

[54:22] everywhere all day all night I said Lord
[54:26] to be a little quiet you know but anyway
[54:29] uh they're multiplying on the earth the

[54:35] spiritual things amen so it's only the
[54:38] grace of God that we're here and uh it's
[54:41] a great privileged to uh have this first

[54:48] rather have one of the other brothers be
[54:50] preaching good to see you brother and uh
[54:55] and uh we uh that's all right because uh
[54:58] we have something to say so you don't
[55:01] have something to say just say something
[55:04] am the bride every bride member has
[55:06] something to say am while I was praying
[55:09] somebody touched me you know that's what
[55:11] you could say God's good to me amen amen

[55:40] doesn't have the hope of Jesus Christ
[55:42] and Resurrection in your life I trust

[55:47] something that might present to you
[55:50] truth and that you by grace of God might
[55:53] receive the truth and be set free amen
[55:55] that's right you will know the truth but
[55:57] you have to meet the truth you have to
[55:59] more than just have it here when the
[56:02] truth comes in as a person then that
[56:05] person makes you free amen so we thank

[57:22] it one time and if I can remember I'll
[57:25] never do again all right with the help

[57:49] how we appreciate the music and the
[57:50] worship and the service you know and the
[57:52] the freedom that you have in Christ and
[57:55] I believe that we do have a freedom to
[57:57] express oursel in the presence of the
[58:00] Lord and uh you know when you really
[58:02] have the Holy Ghost sometimes he gets a
[58:03] bubbling over and you just can't control
[58:05] yourself when our brother started
[58:07] dancing there I thought I was in Africa
[58:09] and I said well this is going to be good

[59:02] you could just uh we can do that so we
[59:05] thank the Lord and I appreciate the

[59:13] it's my first time here brother and so I
[59:15] haven't even been to your church yet so
[59:17] uh maybe next time we can do that but
[59:20] you are welcome to come back up to us
[59:22] okay anytime Ephesians chapter 2 vers
[59:25] one let's and you hath he
[59:27] quickened who were dead in trespasses
[59:30] and sins wherein in time past you walked
[59:35] according to the course of the world
[59:36] according to the prince of the power of
[59:39] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[59:42] the
[59:43] children of
[59:45] Disobedience uh pretty pretty dark uh
[59:49] description of our past you know among
[59:52] whom all also we all had our
[59:55] conversation which which means our
[59:57] lifestyle in times past in the lusts of
[1:00:00] our flesh fulfilling the desires of the
[1:00:02] Flesh and of the mind and we by we were
[1:00:05] by Nature the children of Wrath even as
[1:00:09] others and here's the verse that we want
[1:00:11] to capitalize on but God who is rich in
[1:00:15] Mercy for his great love wherewith he
[1:00:19] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[1:00:23] hath quickened us together with Christ
[1:00:25] by Grace you are saved verse six I like
[1:00:29] that being put in parentheses but it's
[1:00:31] still powerful right there and God
[1:00:34] raised us up together and made us you
[1:00:37] know you didn't have anything to do in
[1:00:39] this God Made You amen God made you do
[1:00:43] it how many believe that God made us to
[1:00:46] sit together in Heavenly places in
[1:00:48] Christ Jesus that in the ages to come
[1:00:51] what ages brother seems like I've been
[1:00:53] here for ages since I first heard this
[1:00:55] message the ages of our life the ages of
[1:00:58] the ages of Misery the ages of problems
[1:01:01] the ages of fighting the battle hoping
[1:01:04] to go out of here any minute but yet
[1:01:06] we're still here it seems like ages but
[1:01:09] in these ages to come amen he might show
[1:01:13] the exceeding Riches of his grace and in
[1:01:16] his kindness toward us say kindness
[1:01:20] toward me say itday kindness toward me
[1:01:24] through Christ Jesus Hallelujah for by
[1:01:27] Grace you saved through faith and that
[1:01:29] not of yourselves it is the gift of God
[1:01:32] hallelujah then I read another scripture
[1:01:34] and that's in the book of Ephesians
[1:01:35] chapter 3: 19 one verse only and then
[1:01:37] we'll
[1:01:40] pray and to know the love of
[1:01:43] Christ which passes
[1:01:47] knowledge that you might be filled with
[1:01:49] all the fullness of God Amen shall we
[1:01:52] bow our heads heavenly father it's a joy
[1:01:54] and a privilege and an honor yet a great

[1:02:04] seeing us how we how we behave oursel in
[1:02:07] the house of God how we receive the word
[1:02:10] and you're interested in each of us as

[1:03:24] amen that's struggling there's always
[1:03:26] somebody that's so beat down they just
[1:03:27] don't know where to go and Lord as I was
[1:03:30] so reminded the other day a brother gave
[1:03:32] me a little coffee cup and it said on
[1:03:33] there said when the world gives you more
[1:03:35] than you can stand
[1:03:38] kneel and Lord I just pray that you
[1:03:40] would hear their prayer hear their cry

[1:03:43] Jesus Wonderful Name everybody said amen
[1:03:47] God bless you you may be seated we're
[1:03:50] happy then that God is uh promised that
[1:03:54] he'd be in the in the midst of us and
[1:03:57] where two or three are gathering in his
[1:03:59] name and my wife and I are alone that's
[1:04:02] two and so he's always there amen but
[1:04:05] you know I had a brother one time used
[1:04:06] to live in Veil Arizona he was kind of
[1:04:08] lonely because a lot of his family
[1:04:10] weren't converted and he was just kind
[1:04:12] of all alone he said brother Ted I'm
[1:04:13] always alone I said no brother there's
[1:04:15] always two and the Bible said if were
[1:04:17] two or three of you there'll be another
[1:04:19] one a third one coming so amen there's
[1:04:22] always two because Christ is with you
[1:04:23] amen he promised he never leave you he
[1:04:26] never came to you to walk away when when
[1:04:28] you got discouraged amen how many's ever
[1:04:30] been discouraged in your life how many's
[1:04:33] discouraged right now oh you're not
[1:04:35] discouraged right now how many's
[1:04:37] planning on being discouraged in the
[1:04:39] future it's just something to kind of
[1:04:41] goes with it you know but see that's
[1:04:43] Satan's job but but if if you can keep
[1:04:46] focused on who you are in Christ and
[1:04:48] what God has done for you and that's why
[1:04:50] I love the theme of these meetings
[1:04:52] brother po I don't I've you know this is
[1:04:54] this is so V
[1:04:56] I've actually prepared about seven
[1:04:58] sermons and uh so this I I worked on

[1:05:04] uh to me you know CU all every word
[1:05:06] every quote is good to me I love every
[1:05:09] one quote I can I can fly to the moon on
[1:05:11] that amen when God quickens you one word
[1:05:15] it doesn't take you know just that's why
[1:05:17] when a preacher preaches you don't have
[1:05:20] to be afraid you're not going to get it
[1:05:21] all you'll never get it all you'll never
[1:05:24] get it all cuz God been talking to the
[1:05:25] preacher for weeks and months and years
[1:05:28] sometimes and by the way this my Jubilee
[1:05:29] of 50 years serving God in 47 47

[1:06:03] God dead and buried or Jesus hanging on
[1:06:05] the cross it wasn't about Christ in you
[1:06:08] amen but this message is Christ in you
[1:06:12] this message lifted God out of history
[1:06:15] and brought him up to this moment that
[1:06:17] we live in now well here I am sitting
[1:06:19] there you know as a as a boy interested
[1:06:21] in only Sports my favorite school in

[1:07:25] I didn't see that light and somebody
[1:07:27] asked me brother Ted did you see that
[1:07:29] light I said no I didn't see that light
[1:07:31] because my teacher was one of those just
[1:07:34] a few of the teachers wouldn't let their
[1:07:36] students out you ever had a teacher like
[1:07:39] that uh I had one I said he wouldn't let
[1:07:42] us out we were all begging him let us
[1:07:44] out we can see what all these people are
[1:07:46] raving about over at AI high school and
[1:07:49] I I says uh and uh by the way uh on the
[1:07:53] grace of God sister Norman was our class
[1:07:55] M Mary Norman and and uh the Sister
[1:07:59] Sarah Brandon was there at the school as
[1:08:01] well at AI so we we knew them and there
[1:08:03] and they knew me and they they told me
[1:08:06] after I got converted they said there
[1:08:08] was no
[1:08:09] way there was no way you were ever going
[1:08:12] to be a
[1:08:13] Christian well see you know God does
[1:08:16] things that people don't
[1:08:18] understand I don't understand it but I
[1:08:20] believe it amen so but it was in my
[1:08:24] heart you know something God does just
[1:08:25] touches you you know and something just
[1:08:27] stays there and you don't ever forget it
[1:08:29] am you know and that's why I believe
[1:08:31] that you'll never forget things that you
[1:08:33] need to know the holy spirit's there to
[1:08:36] Quicken them to you amen and and uh so I
[1:08:39] couldn't go go see the light but uh I
[1:08:42] always wanted to know what it was or to
[1:08:45] see it well then years later after I
[1:08:48] came in by the grace of God the message
[1:08:51] 1974 uh right here baptized up in Sabino
[1:08:54] Canyon and preached my first sermon to a
[1:08:56] my coworker on a painting crew
[1:08:59] interesting testimony but it's I know
[1:09:01] you're not here for testimonies but I
[1:09:03] just have to get it off out of my off my
[1:09:05] chest you know like could to speak and
[1:09:07] uh so then so I preached my first sermon
[1:09:09] and man he was so close you know I
[1:09:12] preached my first sermon and he was
[1:09:15] trying he was a Buddhist and I was a
[1:09:16] Hindu you know
[1:09:17] before yeah you don't want to hear that
[1:09:21] part and uh so we were arguing who had
[1:09:24] the best religion here I am standing in
[1:09:26] the pool up at 7even Falls being
[1:09:28] baptized and he's sitting up there
[1:09:31] meditating trying to get through and
[1:09:33] here I am I got through something
[1:09:35] already got me
[1:09:37] through he said Ted is that you I said
[1:09:39] yeah Gary is that you he said yeah he
[1:09:41] said he said I thought you were a Hindu
[1:09:43] he said I did too but that didn't that
[1:09:46] didn't work said I never got what I
[1:09:48] found when Jesus came to me one day and
[1:09:51] I preached my first sermon brother I
[1:09:53] tell you what he was in tears and he
[1:09:56] just about to get up and dive in that
[1:09:58] pool and he said nope he said I'm so
[1:10:01] close I'm just going to stay with my
[1:10:03] meditation I never saw him again you
[1:10:04] know if you're if you're close go a
[1:10:07] little further if you're close don't go
[1:10:09] back don't go back when you see you feel
[1:10:12] God pulling you don't turn back because
[1:10:15] you this may be your last opportunity
[1:10:17] amen I don't know what happened to him
[1:10:19] you know if we're predestinated we know
[1:10:20] we'll be there but we are predestinated
[1:10:22] to act amen so so so by the grace of God
[1:10:27] after I was after I was converted I went
[1:10:30] by after some time and I saw some of my
[1:10:33] old
[1:10:34] schoolmates and uh and I uh I said say I
[1:10:39] found out what that light was that you
[1:10:41] all were running up and down and and
[1:10:45] knocking on the doors and saying come
[1:10:46] out you got to see this this is neat you
[1:10:49] know and um that's an old time that
[1:10:52] dates me right using that word
[1:10:55] uh and uh I don't mind being dated amen
[1:11:00] but my conversion is eternal amen no
[1:11:03] time there and uh so I said I found out
[1:11:07] what that light was and they were the
[1:11:09] ones that were jumping up and down
[1:11:10] raving about see in the light you know
[1:11:12] they saw it with their eyes I never saw
[1:11:14] it and then they they
[1:11:16] uh and then they said every one of them
[1:11:20] they said what what light are you
[1:11:23] talking about
[1:11:25] see I didn't see it but I know what it
[1:11:28] is I know what it was and I believe it
[1:11:30] amen they they saw it and it meant
[1:11:33] nothing to him brother that's why
[1:11:35] brother bam he said so many times in
[1:11:37] different ways he said it's better for
[1:11:38] you to see a photograph with a pillar F
[1:11:40] than to see it with your own eyes
[1:11:41] because your eyes might be playing
[1:11:42] tricks on you that day but when you see
[1:11:44] that photograph you know that's true
[1:11:46] amen but the best way is to see it by
[1:11:49] Revelation amen when God reveals it to
[1:11:51] you it becomes a part of your life
[1:11:55] amen blessed be the name of the Lord so
[1:11:58] we thank God for that so I wanted to I
[1:12:01] wanted to
[1:12:07] uh anybody have one of these tablets
[1:12:10] that thinks for
[1:12:22] itself so we want to read uh
[1:12:25] we want to talk
[1:12:27] about what what this s this scripture
[1:12:30] said but God rich in Mercy well I'm
[1:12:33] saying that I need to say this testimony
[1:12:35] about Seth Wallace he was sitting
[1:12:36] Wednesday night we do tape services in
[1:12:38] the church we I believe in everything
[1:12:40] that God gave us whatever God gave us we
[1:12:43] need it we need every brother every
[1:12:45] sister pulling together we need every
[1:12:47] gift every every Ministry amen and we
[1:12:50] need to we need to uh do like the
[1:12:52] prophet of God said and just stay in
[1:12:54] those tapes and say only what the pro
[1:12:55] the prophet said because otherwise you
[1:12:58] got nothing for the bride everything the
[1:13:00] bride needs is right there amen so we
[1:13:02] thank God for that so we were listening
[1:13:05] to a tape and brother Seth was there

[1:13:09] I'm wrong somebody correct me that from
[1:13:11] the church we have a few from up there

[1:13:36] make this my home church right here and
[1:13:38] come back to tucs Sun I have a house
[1:13:39] over here might as well do it
[1:13:44] right people will let me do it but you
[1:13:47] know when you got one or two or three or
[1:13:49] 10 or 15 or 20 or 30 Souls that depend
[1:13:51] on you being faithful and being there

[1:13:56] worlds we're going to do that by the
[1:13:58] help of the Lord
[1:14:00] amen so I'm going to tell you the title
[1:14:02] of my sermon is but
[1:14:04] God and that doesn't even sound
[1:14:08] right but
[1:14:10] God it doesn't sound like a
[1:14:13] much and it doesn't even sound right but
[1:14:15] the whole plan of God is expressed in
[1:14:16] these two words and I want to tell you
[1:14:17] about it for the next few minutes we're
[1:14:20] talking about love you know being the
[1:14:21] theme of the greatest force in the
[1:14:23] universe and when love projects and and
[1:14:26] so this scripture talks about mercy so
[1:14:29] we were here in this tape God rich in
[1:14:31] Mercy and brother Seth was sitting there
[1:14:32] and he'd been he'd been having to take
[1:14:35] uh medic medication neurological
[1:14:37] medicines for his uh seizures
[1:14:41] epilepsy and uh you know he was wanted
[1:14:43] to get married and have a family and
[1:14:45] everything like that and it was going to
[1:14:46] be tough and brother Dennis knows the
[1:14:48] whole story real well you twoo my
[1:14:51] brother um so we were hearing that tape
[1:14:53] this tape God rich in and mercy and
[1:14:55] while he was heing it he was sitting
[1:14:57] right there and his mother was on one
[1:14:59] side of him and his dad was there on the
[1:15:00] other side or something like that and he
[1:15:02] looks at both of them and he said Mom
[1:15:06] Dad God just healed
[1:15:09] me I'm not going to take my medicines
[1:15:12] anymore know it was you know God came on
[1:15:15] the scene it was one of those but God
[1:15:17] moments amen everything look like you're
[1:15:19] going to have to go do in this the rest
[1:15:21] of your life and all of a sudden God
[1:15:22] changed the whole picture amen no I I I
[1:15:25] love this sermon for that reason I hear
[1:15:27] it once a once a week I hear this sermon
[1:15:30] I so I guess maybe that's why I'm
[1:15:32] preaching this tonight after all the
[1:15:35] other ones that we had prepared I fell
[1:15:36] on this one and uh so we want to thank
[1:15:40] God not Ephesians 19 it says this I've
[1:15:43] always and I've always wondered about
[1:15:45] this anybody here always wondered about
[1:15:50] something anybody here wondered about
[1:15:52] something a long time then God revealed
[1:15:53] it to you don't wonder about
[1:15:55] anymore we have all kind of people here
[1:15:58] you know I always wondered before I was
[1:15:59] a Christian I wondered who I was what my
[1:16:01] purpose was what I was here for why I
[1:16:02] was alive why why nothing couldn't kill
[1:16:04] me I had friends dying of this and that
[1:16:07] overdoses of drugs and
[1:16:10] I something was there something was
[1:16:12] watching over us and you that are here
[1:16:14] tonight if you haven't given your heart
[1:16:16] to Christ you must but you will but he's
[1:16:19] not going to force you but he'll draw
[1:16:21] you he he will he will create an
[1:16:23] atmosphere around you where you you
[1:16:25] can't help it amen it'll just be
[1:16:27] something you he'll touch a button
[1:16:29] nobody else ever touched he'll he'll
[1:16:31] he'll touch a spot in you you didn't
[1:16:33] even know you have CU down in you is a
[1:16:36] little spot of eternal life I'm changing
[1:16:39] my sermon already it's always been there
[1:16:42] and it just takes the right finger to
[1:16:44] touch it can you say amen
[1:16:46] amen like the man that had his air
[1:16:49] conditioner broke down and he called a
[1:16:50] man to come and fix it and the man came
[1:16:52] and he spent 5 minutes he opened up the
[1:16:53] panel box he took his screwdriver and he
[1:16:56] put that screwdriver on a screw and he
[1:16:58] turned it about a quarter of a turn and
[1:17:00] he said try it now said it was perfect
[1:17:02] said how much do owe you he said you
[1:17:04] don't owe me anything said I'll send you
[1:17:07] a bill the bill came in the mail he
[1:17:11] $373 and the man said sir said I got a
[1:17:15] complaint about this bill the man your
[1:17:16] your service man only spent 5 minutes at
[1:17:20] my house and I'm supposed to pay him
[1:17:23] $373 for fixing my my uh air
[1:17:27] conditioners that I could have fixed it
[1:17:29] myself oh he said wait a minute what's
[1:17:32] your problem sir well I'm I'm I'm I'm
[1:17:34] protesting that the
[1:17:36] $373 well sir it was only $23 for the
[1:17:41] for the the the labor that he did the
[1:17:44] and for turning that screw was only for
[1:17:46] $23 that's what he told me but said the
[1:17:49] rest of the money was with all those
[1:17:52] thousands of screws in there to turn he
[1:17:54] knew the right one amen hallelujah so
[1:17:58] sometimes it comes with a great price of
[1:18:01] having met somebody who knew what screw
[1:18:04] to turn what what button to touch in
[1:18:07] your life amen blessed be the name of
[1:18:09] the Lord that's how we find our mate in
[1:18:11] life that's how we find our home church
[1:18:14] that's how we find it's by inspiration
[1:18:16] God is leading us amen blessed be the
[1:18:19] name of the Lord amen so we do
[1:18:21] appreciate that amen and so I told you
[1:18:24] it's going to be salad don't if it's
[1:18:25] something you don't like put it aside
[1:18:27] and then you know come back at it you
[1:18:29] know the other meals will come the other
[1:18:31] parts of the meal will come they'll be
[1:18:32] heavy they'll be good they'll be deep
[1:18:34] but this is real simple that's way I
[1:18:36] like to preach and stay and sometime I
[1:18:39] need to go deeper but I find out that
[1:18:42] Simplicity just works so
[1:18:45] well amen and so we find out then
[1:18:50] that that
[1:18:53] uh I've always wondering about
[1:18:56] how that we could know something that
[1:18:58] surpasses
[1:19:00] knowledge cuz it seems like it doesn't
[1:19:02] make
[1:19:03] sense you can know what can't be known
[1:19:07] it's beyond knowing it's the same word
[1:19:10] goo G in the Greek chos and it means to
[1:19:14] to know or to know a practical knowledge
[1:19:17] about something to know a factual
[1:19:18] knowledge about something and then the
[1:19:21] other word is that it surpasses that to
[1:19:23] know the love of Christ which surpasses
[1:19:26] knowledge amen so I thought about it
[1:19:28] like this it would have to be Revelation
[1:19:31] it would have to be a divine revelation
[1:19:34] that drops something in you that you
[1:19:36] still don't even know but you know it
[1:19:38] right it's like it's like like how to
[1:19:40] know I know the rain was going to I
[1:19:42] don't know but I know how do you know
[1:19:44] what to do I don't know but I just know
[1:19:47] it's a scripture that says and to know
[1:19:49] the love of Christ that passes knowledge
[1:19:53] but when you have it in your life you
[1:19:55] know it can you say Amen but better than
[1:19:58] that he knows you he knows how to move
[1:20:02] you he knows what he's going to do with
[1:20:04] you that's why sometime if he has to
[1:20:07] slap us around a little bit brother
[1:20:09] that's good for you amen because he's
[1:20:12] getting you right into your position
[1:20:15] sometimes things that we run away for
[1:20:17] from is good for us because God didn't
[1:20:20] want us to stay there God wanted us to
[1:20:23] get somewhere like Jonah in the belly of
[1:20:25] a whale where we would cry out to him
[1:20:28] amen and then he would send us in the
[1:20:31] right
[1:20:32] direction blessed be the name of the
[1:20:34] Lord my water bottle is sitting here for
[1:20:40] Lorn you belong to me and I'm going to
[1:20:43] use
[1:20:48] you you served your purpose well
[1:20:55] excuse me for just being
[1:20:58] me EXC my dear wife she's put up with me
[1:21:00] for so long excuse me for just being me
[1:21:03] but you wouldn't want me any other way
[1:21:05] would
[1:21:06] you
[1:21:08] well wives don't do it like that don't
[1:21:10] say
[1:21:13] well God God knew what he was doing when
[1:21:15] he brought us together I'm so glad for
[1:21:17] that appreciate his mercy and his grace
[1:21:20] so we find out then you don't know how
[1:21:23] but you just know yes amen and to know
[1:21:25] the love of Christ which
[1:21:26] surpasses your own knowledge I don't
[1:21:30] even have the capacity to reach to where
[1:21:32] that is but yet I can still know it amen
[1:21:36] and I want to know him more I want to
[1:21:37] know him deeper I want to go deeper than
[1:21:39] that knowledge I want that that's why I
[1:21:41] said you know you say well brother said
[1:21:43] when am I going to get there I don't
[1:21:44] know because I've been I've been at this
[1:21:46] 50 years and it's just look like look
[1:21:48] like I'm just beginning look like young
[1:21:50] people are for surpassing me at this
[1:21:52] time because you know we get knocked
[1:21:54] around little bit amen things don't go
[1:21:56] the way we thought they were going to go
[1:21:58] all of a sudden we think well this can't
[1:21:59] be according to God's program but you
[1:22:01] know God has a program that a lot of
[1:22:03] times he don't let us in on amen he
[1:22:05] gives us the main part but then between
[1:22:07] the lines there's a whole lot going on
[1:22:09] in there Amen in the love affair between
[1:22:12] you and Christ there's a lot of things
[1:22:13] he hides from you until the moment you
[1:22:15] need it and brother B said there's
[1:22:17] things in the scripture that God hides
[1:22:19] from you until the moment that you need
[1:22:21] it because if you get it too early
[1:22:23] you'll waste it you will not use it
[1:22:25] wisely amen so God's preparing us for
[1:22:28] the great moving the great infilling the
[1:22:31] great Revival amen and I believe that so
[1:22:34] but there has to be a killing first
[1:22:35] brother man before you can have a
[1:22:36] Revival that's one of the sermons I was
[1:22:38] going to preach tonight you have to have
[1:22:40] a killing you have to empty out you got
[1:22:42] to get your own thoughts out of there
[1:22:44] amen and that takes love brother that's
[1:22:47] where love comes in it's the greatest
[1:22:48] Force who else can do it science brother
[1:22:51] they can cut they can cut the heart out
[1:22:53] of you but brother in said a doctor can
[1:22:55] lay there and cut your heart right out
[1:22:56] of you but he cannot cut the blessing
[1:22:59] out of you he cannot cut the blessing of
[1:23:01] the Holy Ghost out of your life amen cuz
[1:23:04] that's way deeper yeah it's deeper there
[1:23:05] it's like you know doctors are trying to
[1:23:07] find cancer and they go look for it and
[1:23:09] they go look and brother man said he
[1:23:10] escaped the doctor's knife but brother
[1:23:13] you got something in you that escapes
[1:23:15] the world it escapes the man's mind it
[1:23:18] escapes your own Fallen nature escapes
[1:23:21] your own problems your own hangups your
[1:23:23] own conf lexes there's something that
[1:23:26] runs free amen moving inside of you amen
[1:23:30] that's God's love that's God's love but
[1:23:32] then God's love uh let me let me say it
[1:23:35] this way if it's all right um to use an
[1:23:40] analogy of how you can know something
[1:23:42] that surpasses knowledge of what you do
[1:23:46] know could I say it like this that it if
[1:23:49] the eagle in the chicken yard story that
[1:23:52] brother Ram told how many's heard that
[1:23:54] how many hasn't heard it I'm not going
[1:23:56] to tell you but I'm going she tell you
[1:23:58] what tape it's on not right now
[1:24:00] cuz if I need to remember I'll
[1:24:03] remember but I I'll show you where
[1:24:05] brother Ram talked that story but he
[1:24:07] likened that to us as eagles which is
[1:24:11] Children of the Great Eagle God you know
[1:24:13] amen so here this Eagle is with all
[1:24:15] these
[1:24:16] chickens and this
[1:24:18] Eagle well he looked like an
[1:24:22] eagle amen he dreamed Like an Eagle he
[1:24:26] had an appetite Like an
[1:24:29] Eagle he didn't like all those worms and
[1:24:31] stuff he wanted fresh meat you know he's
[1:24:34] already an eagle he he sounded like an
[1:24:37] eagle they were going and he was
[1:24:41] going so if you do that in church don't
[1:24:44] worry about it that's that's Eagle talk
[1:24:49] amen some people are afraid of that say
[1:24:52] that people are losing their mind I say
[1:24:53] praise the Lord
[1:24:54] praise that's the best thing you ever
[1:24:56] happened to me amen hallelujah you
[1:24:59] wouldn't want my mind you wouldn't want
[1:25:01] my old mind brother Dennis no sir they
[1:25:03] wouldn't want our old mind would they no
[1:25:05] sir amen they will we have a new mind
[1:25:09] thank God in Christ amen so there was
[1:25:12] this Eagle he he sounded like an eagle
[1:25:15] he felt like an eagle he dreamed Like an
[1:25:17] Eagle he had a nature of an eagle but he
[1:25:19] never knew what an eagle was until he
[1:25:20] looked up and saw something that he
[1:25:23] reflected up there in the Sky he said I
[1:25:25] had to see his reflection amen so I
[1:25:28] believe that God's the same way with his
[1:25:29] love when God uh come down and I'll just
[1:25:33] maybe I'll just cut this
[1:25:35] short nobody said no
[1:25:38] okay I preach in Africa it's different
[1:25:41] You Preach in Africa say I'm going to
[1:25:43] cut cut this short brother we've given
[1:25:44] you three hours I said
[1:25:47] what I went to a convention over lashi
[1:25:50] and we preached the brother said he
[1:25:51] brother Ted's going to preach and said
[1:25:53] every body come so they were going to
[1:25:56] turn me loose you know and preach all my
[1:25:59] five sermons at once and uh I just
[1:26:02] preach one and after about an hour hour
[1:26:05] and a half with the translation uh I sat
[1:26:08] down and the pastor come over and said
[1:26:10] hey we expected you to preach all
[1:26:13] afternoon we don't have an evening
[1:26:14] service we're going to go all
[1:26:16] night why didn't you tell
[1:26:19] me sometimes it's good to talk you know
[1:26:23] amen
[1:26:24] blessed be the name of the Lord like
[1:26:26] people saying you know around the
[1:26:27] message oh I wish brother Ben said this
[1:26:29] about that or said this about that or
[1:26:30] said brother sometimes sometimes we just
[1:26:32] got to go look again and find out that
[1:26:34] he did say something about that he
[1:26:37] absolutely told us everything we need to
[1:26:39] know already I believe that he just not
[1:26:42] looking deep enough sometimes we think
[1:26:44] we we were cheated but we weren't
[1:26:45] cheated we were given the best there
[1:26:47] could possibly be given to us in this
[1:26:49] hour amen blessed be the name of the
[1:26:51] Lord so this Eagle all haded to look up
[1:26:54] and saw that reflection he said now I
[1:26:57] know see it's in a different way it's a
[1:26:59] different capacity so I could say to you
[1:27:01] once I was young and I thought I knew
[1:27:03] and now I know you know but it it's a
[1:27:06] personal you can't even explain it it's
[1:27:09] just something that identifies A Life
[1:27:11] That's in you and what it does is on the
[1:27:14] as well it creates a love affair between
[1:27:17] you and Christ until you can't stand for
[1:27:21] five minutes not to talk to him you
[1:27:23] don't like people day are so hooked on
[1:27:24] their cell phones you got to have cell
[1:27:26] phone what if you what if we'd all
[1:27:28] checked in our cell phones at the door I
[1:27:29] don't know if that's a rule in your
[1:27:31] church it's not in ours either but we're
[1:27:33] going to do it what they say you can't
[1:27:36] go five minutes without looking at it
[1:27:38] you know because it you're you're
[1:27:39] addicted what it's telling you and what
[1:27:41] it's showing you what it what it's the
[1:27:43] emotions that it's pulling and
[1:27:45] everything like that what if my friend
[1:27:47] what if my brother and my sister that we
[1:27:50] could be so full of the love of God
[1:27:52] until there wasn't anything else
[1:27:55] existed amen even the devil wouldn't
[1:27:57] exist in that place amen sin couldn't
[1:28:00] exist there brother bam said I I long
[1:28:02] you know brother Bram had you know the
[1:28:04] Bram Tabernacle in those days that were
[1:28:06] spiritual that had all the gifts and the
[1:28:07] things working in the under the prophet
[1:28:09] and they were cleaning up their lives
[1:28:11] they were living Godly and they brother
[1:28:13] B said if I could just walk into a
[1:28:14] church one day where sin couldn't come
[1:28:17] in these doors he said where he said if
[1:28:20] it did said God the Holy Spirit would
[1:28:21] call it out right now they'd either make
[1:28:23] it right or they'd get out you see
[1:28:26] brother Ted that would empty the church
[1:28:27] it doesn't matter amen God is God you
[1:28:30] cannot turn away an elected seed of God
[1:28:34] you you canot preach too hard for an
[1:28:37] elected seed you can now but now on the
[1:28:39] other hand if you don't have any love
[1:28:40] you're going to drive them away right
[1:28:42] now if you you come on it's hard and
[1:28:44] it's critical and it's bullying and they
[1:28:46] feel like they they didn't get blessed
[1:28:48] they got beat up over there at the house
[1:28:50] of God I'm telling you what that kind of
[1:28:52] ministry isn't the ministry for this
[1:28:54] hour this is the ministry of healing
[1:28:57] this is a Ministry of Mercy amen we're
[1:28:59] talking about Mercy now we're talking
[1:29:02] about Mercy that got me back to Mercy
[1:29:05] and so with this I'm going to start this
[1:29:07] uh quote here in uh The God Who is rich
[1:29:10] in Mercy brother man said in paragraph
[1:29:15] 35 The God Who is rich in Mercy not
[1:29:18] 65119 that's the one we're in I want to
[1:29:21] take from
[1:29:22] there paragraph 35 I want to take from
[1:29:24] there a few or part of the verse but God
[1:29:28] the brother B separated those two words
[1:29:30] but God that's what I'm titling my
[1:29:31] sermon today but God The God Who is rich
[1:29:34] in Mercy but God The God Who is rich in
[1:29:38] Mercy and I want you to notice here of
[1:29:41] the uh Prophet or the Apostle rather
[1:29:43] Paul who wrote how that he made mention
[1:29:46] of this and how that uh and how you has
[1:29:51] he quickened who were once dead
[1:29:54] amen amen you hath he quickened it amen
[1:29:58] who were once dead now if you were once
[1:30:01] dead why do you remember your former
[1:30:05] life CU when you're dead you don't do
[1:30:07] any
[1:30:09] thinking but you remember your past
[1:30:11] because the devil remembers your past
[1:30:13] that's right but you were once dead you
[1:30:16] were once dead but now you're alive
[1:30:18] here's what he says watch
[1:30:20] now now if you don't you don't you don't
[1:30:22] believe it don't say Amen but if you say
[1:30:24] amen and you don't believe it you're a
[1:30:26] liar so you got to be careful
[1:30:29] amen better be careful what you what
[1:30:32] you're saying Amen to listen careful
[1:30:36] amen this might be deeper than you
[1:30:39] think but we find out see he said you
[1:30:43] were dead in sin and trespasses walking
[1:30:45] after the things of the world boy there
[1:30:48] I that was me I was doing
[1:30:50] that the desire of the flesh fulfilling
[1:30:53] the desire of the
[1:30:56] mind my this the Mind age right
[1:30:58] expanding the
[1:31:00] mind what caused this change verse
[1:31:04] 37 what caused this change you see and
[1:31:07] what caused it from one time being dead
[1:31:11] and then to Quicken Quicken means to be
[1:31:14] made alive how many's been made alive
[1:31:16] how many been made Quicken by God but
[1:31:18] you had to be once dead before you could
[1:31:20] be made alive amen that's why my sermon
[1:31:23] that I might preach next time or anytime
[1:31:25] or some sometime is you got to have a
[1:31:28] killing before you can have a Revival
[1:31:29] how you going to revive unless you're
[1:31:31] dead amen you're going to die to self
[1:31:33] and that's thank God the Lord knows how
[1:31:35] to do that for us amen God knows how to
[1:31:38] make us get sick and tired of oursel
[1:31:42] that's right sick and tired of
[1:31:45] how how little love we have and how much
[1:31:48] maybe knowledge but a little lack of
[1:31:50] real power amen cuz see say love the
[1:31:53] greatest Force everybody wants power but
[1:31:57] now it's personality power now it's uh
[1:31:59] you know it's it's a it's a Charisma
[1:32:04] power it's a knowledge power it's a
[1:32:07] money power comes right into the church
[1:32:10] amen some kind of thing like that
[1:32:12] brother B said anything that comes into
[1:32:13] any church that gives the promises the
[1:32:17] people power that isn't the Holy Ghost
[1:32:19] he said that's an antichrist Spirit you
[1:32:21] turned loose in there God help us friend
[1:32:24] we don't want the devil in here we don't
[1:32:26] want Antichrist but first we got to get
[1:32:28] him purified out of here otherwise he
[1:32:31] goes with us amen I want to walk in
[1:32:34] clean don't you want to walk in I want
[1:32:37] to walk into these meetings here in the
[1:32:39] 9th anniversary meetings of this church
[1:32:41] and find a place where I can get revived
[1:32:44] again I can get a fresh start again
[1:32:47] brother Chad well you started good a
[1:32:48] long time ago I need a fresh start I
[1:32:50] need a I I I need a a new burst of faith
[1:32:53] I need need a a new Awakening I need a I
[1:32:56] need to see my reflection again I I need
[1:32:59] to I need to find my bearings again you
[1:33:02] say well I thought you did already yes I
[1:33:04] did but you know the life and time
[1:33:07] that's why I said Through the Ages to
[1:33:09] come right brother Bill you've been
[1:33:10] through some ages man I mean Hard Times
[1:33:13] brother you know things that seems like
[1:33:16] it's taken forever for this thing or a
[1:33:18] promise and this is one of the big
[1:33:20] questions people ask me all the time say
[1:33:21] brother Ted Pastor tell tell me why I
[1:33:25] believe right I've been prayed for I've
[1:33:29] accepted it and I know I know God's
[1:33:33] going to do it and I believe he has done
[1:33:36] it and I'm confessing that he's done it
[1:33:38] but it still hasn't
[1:33:40] happen well if I could say to you what
[1:33:42] brother B said to you know blind blind
[1:33:44] John Ryan he'd say what does that have
[1:33:46] to do with it but sometimes that's kind
[1:33:49] of slaps us on the side of the face say
[1:33:52] wait a minute why are you say saying
[1:33:54] that you're because if we had more
[1:33:57] love we'd be feeling the presence of God
[1:33:59] in the in the fire in the problem in the
[1:34:03] challenge in the trauma amen you'd be
[1:34:07] feeling the power of God I believe that
[1:34:08] don't you because it's the greatest
[1:34:09] force in the universe and if there's
[1:34:10] anywhere in you there nothing that can
[1:34:13] beat it down aren't you glad for that
[1:34:15] all right some of you look tired already
[1:34:17] you're really going to look tired when
[1:34:19] I'm done if that's the case yeah if
[1:34:20] we're going that direction
[1:34:28] don't go that direction wake
[1:34:33] up Daniel Williams he had something he
[1:34:35] said he said he said sometimes I preach
[1:34:37] and people are so feel so comfortable
[1:34:39] they just fall
[1:34:42] asleep say they are so blessed and so
[1:34:45] they they're just they just loving every
[1:34:48] minute of
[1:34:50] it he said' if you do that in my
[1:34:52] preaching he said it's my
[1:34:54] fault he said because usually what I do
[1:34:57] when somebody falls asleep in my church
[1:34:59] he's gone to be with the Lord now I
[1:35:00] could say this you wouldn't want to know
[1:35:02] that about him while he was alive but
[1:35:04] other he said if if they did that in my
[1:35:06] church he said I would grab a song book
[1:35:08] or something like this candle here and I
[1:35:11] just slam it on top of their head and
[1:35:13] said until they woke
[1:35:18] up you would want a pastor like that
[1:35:20] would you what would what would you say
[1:35:23] if you had a a pastor saw you taking up
[1:35:26] big three four five six offerings in the
[1:35:29] church and then he come in there kick
[1:35:30] down the kick down the offering box
[1:35:33] Jesus did it Jesus Walks since they were
[1:35:36] making money they're God that's right
[1:35:38] amen they were making power their God
[1:35:41] love is our God our God is love amen our
[1:35:45] God is love am how's the salad
[1:35:54] and so brother B
[1:35:56] said see if you if it was dying
[1:36:00] physically and find your place again and
[1:36:03] it could be healed physically that would
[1:36:07] be a great thing but nothing so great as
[1:36:10] when he is spiritually dead and God
[1:36:14] quickened him to
[1:36:16] life you once in times past were
[1:36:19] dead you were dead amen
[1:36:24] even many things tonight here tonight
[1:36:26] even
[1:36:27] many here tonight one time can look back
[1:36:31] and know that you were dead but now why
[1:36:35] aren't you dead
[1:36:36] tonight as you were then you deserve to
[1:36:39] be that
[1:36:40] way because you was a
[1:36:44] sinner I'm many to go a step further
[1:36:46] than say an amen and say I was a sinner
[1:36:50] I was a sinner I mean we could just it
[1:36:53] like this if brother brandham said it
[1:36:55] that's what you got to say that was the
[1:36:57] truth but it's more than that you got a
[1:36:59] revelation I was a sinner because the
[1:37:03] nature even though if you never did it a
[1:37:07] lot of things brother random never did
[1:37:08] but he said I'm guilty of it all because
[1:37:10] I wanted to that nature was in there
[1:37:13] amen amen but one day I found out there
[1:37:16] was another William Brandon all right
[1:37:18] amen all right and I was born again amen
[1:37:21] the love of God found him aren't you
[1:37:22] glad for that
[1:37:24] I'm watching the clock don't think I'm
[1:37:26] not trouble is I need new glasses so
[1:37:30] don't worry about that don't worry about
[1:37:36] that I got a way to fix those clocks
[1:37:38] just take the battery
[1:37:43] out that's why the devil can't fix you
[1:37:46] he can't get your
[1:37:50] battery he can't find your battery he
[1:37:52] don't know what makes you tick he don't
[1:37:55] know what makes you run
[1:37:58] amen he thinks it's just all the people
[1:38:01] say a nice things about you in church
[1:38:03] brother God can turn the tables on that
[1:38:05] one right there amen all of a sudden
[1:38:08] you're still just is happy you're still
[1:38:11] just is BL you got your prayer just got
[1:38:14] longer you got more people to redeem
[1:38:18] amen and we love the
[1:38:21] Lord that's right huj
[1:38:24] and so he says uh he says uh but God yes
[1:38:30] amen who is rich in Mercy that's the
[1:38:33] thing say God who is Rich all these
[1:38:35] things that they were but but God that's
[1:38:38] where I got my sermon title but God that
[1:38:41] made the change right there God who is
[1:38:44] rich in Mercy Hallelujah and he says
[1:38:46] paragraph 39 where we'll stop with it I
[1:38:49] am so glad for that that he being rich
[1:38:52] in Mercy
[1:38:54] and if he was just rich in money or if
[1:38:57] he just rich in materials which he does
[1:38:58] you know how many times we pray Lord you
[1:39:00] own the cattle on a thousand hills you
[1:39:01] all the blessings your coffers are full
[1:39:03] you have silver and gold unres Untold
[1:39:05] and so Lord bless my pocketbook you know
[1:39:07] but what if God keeps it empty but
[1:39:09] blesses your heart I'm telling you what
[1:39:11] that is the greatest blessing can you
[1:39:13] say Amen sometimes no money is better
[1:39:15] than some money amen because when you
[1:39:17] have no money God has to create
[1:39:19] something for you God has to God has to
[1:39:21] do a miracle everybody wants to see
[1:39:22] miracles excuse me oh my too much
[1:39:25] basketball when I was
[1:39:28] young I'm not fighting with the my
[1:39:30] microphone stand now amen trying to
[1:39:33] block him
[1:39:35] out I'm going to get the reme
[1:39:37] remembrances sometimes of your childhood
[1:39:39] and things and dumb things idiotic
[1:39:41] things that used to do and stuff like
[1:39:43] that the devil said aha I caught you you
[1:39:45] were D you were wishing you could go
[1:39:47] back there brother the devil's in for a
[1:39:49] surprise it ain't that way at all
[1:39:51] because he can't get in your heart he
[1:39:53] can't get in where your real thought is
[1:39:56] he can he can maybe read your mind but
[1:39:58] he cannot read this mind there's another
[1:40:01] mind you got a you got a live wire
[1:40:03] moving around sending fire out brother
[1:40:07] it'll go across the universe brother
[1:40:10] it'll take down every devil in his path
[1:40:12] how many believe that you see but I my
[1:40:14] problem's too big brother Ted your
[1:40:17] problem is too big for me your to
[1:40:19] problem is too big for maybe a church
[1:40:22] but your problem isn't too big for love
[1:40:24] love can take care of your problem how
[1:40:26] many believe that amen but then out of
[1:40:29] that and did I finish oh what a great
[1:40:32] word that is that how we were once dead
[1:40:36] but now the word but you know my mother
[1:40:39] was an English teacher God Rest her
[1:40:42] soul I'm I'm speaking a lot of slang
[1:40:46] now and uh she said it's those tapes

[1:40:59] kids five boys two girls I was the only
[1:41:01] boy qualified by health reasons to be a
[1:41:04] priest so she never spanked me worst

[1:41:46] Bible I felt at home amongst these
[1:41:49] people but brother you find out what
[1:41:50] they really thrive on that's right and

[1:42:17] you ever thought you would let yourself
[1:42:19] go brother when that happens there's
[1:42:21] only one thing that can

[1:43:02] gentleman that's right he is a gentleman
[1:43:05] he won't make you offensive amen he
[1:43:08] won't make you offensive that's why
[1:43:10] ministers have to draw back sometimes
[1:43:13] because they want to say something and
[1:43:15] the Holy Spirit isn't pulling them
[1:43:17] pushing them nobody's pulling no maybe
[1:43:19] it's not time maybe next time I'll say
[1:43:21] it but you're learning that don't you

[1:47:09] it's supposed to be when God uses you
[1:47:10] you're not supposed to feel all puffed
[1:47:12] up it used to be in the old days when
[1:47:14] God used a preacher the preacher would
[1:47:16] get small and then the people would get
[1:47:18] big the the hearts of the people would
[1:47:20] get full amen nowadays preacher gets big
[1:47:23] and everybody wants to worship the
[1:47:25] messenger instead of the instead of the
[1:47:28] message himself which is Christ brother
[1:47:31] I'm tell you the truth hallelujah don't
[1:47:33] you let yourself fall into that
[1:47:35] preachers God Made You small stay small
[1:47:37] if God made you a nobody stay a nobody
[1:47:41] God can't make something out of a
[1:47:43] somebody he can make something out of a
[1:47:45] nobody he took took nothing and made
[1:47:47] something out of it amen yes sir blessed
[1:47:49] be the name of the Lord Brother B said
[1:47:51] he caught me when I was nothing you
[1:47:53] heard this quote said he caught me when
[1:47:55] I was nothing what brother man said
[1:47:57] perfect strength my perfect weakness he
[1:47:59] said I'm still
[1:48:01] nothing our Prophet said I'm still
[1:48:04] nothing but I'm in his
[1:48:07] hand but God you know they said you're
[1:48:11] not supposed to I got off on my mother
[1:48:14] being a English teacher that's why I
[1:48:15] went off I know where I went off my
[1:48:18] mother being an English teacher it
[1:48:19] doesn't even sound right you're not even
[1:48:21] supposed to rules of the English
[1:48:22] language or any language what if you
[1:48:24] said going around in Spanish and said
[1:48:27] P yes Hallelujah
[1:48:31] P or in France M
[1:48:34] you you
[1:48:36] brother but God doesn't seem to make
[1:48:39] sense and not even in the English
[1:48:40] language how that could be a word but
[1:48:43] God didn't know about it God put in the
[1:48:45] Bible 49 times we got the quotes in the
[1:48:48] Bible I'm going to read them to you I'll
[1:48:50] be done in about 3 hours is that good
[1:48:55] amen am I to take that as a
[1:48:59] no I don't know how to interpret that
[1:49:01] because I don't know you all that
[1:49:10] well but God
[1:49:12] see but is conjunction you don't begin a
[1:49:16] sentence with a conjunction that is
[1:49:18] rules of grammar but God can do it amen
[1:49:22] he did it in the
[1:49:24] Bible and a prophet did it
[1:49:26] too
[1:49:29] am brother BR said but God 600 and some
[1:49:32] times in the message but God so it's
[1:49:36] okay for me to preach a serment on it
[1:49:38] amen I'm going to do it anyway
[1:49:44] amen but is a it signifies a contrast or
[1:49:48] a change or a nullification of the
[1:49:51] previous
[1:49:52] and a and a rising of the of the new
[1:49:57] away with the old and on with the new
[1:50:00] amen but means there's a change here oh
[1:50:04] we take it as an
[1:50:06] example of uh somebody comeing to pay
[1:50:10] you and say Hey brother Ted I come to I
[1:50:13] was intending to come and pay you today
[1:50:17] period but I left my wallet at home
[1:50:23] I don't like that if I need the money I
[1:50:25] I didn't want that using
[1:50:29] butt isn't that
[1:50:31] true yes sir what the doctor says oh I'm
[1:50:36] glad you're my patient oh this new
[1:50:37] medicine I've been using it and it's
[1:50:40] working great for most of my
[1:50:44] patients
[1:50:46] period but in your
[1:50:50] case How about if it was different you
[1:50:52] go down to in a car down there you fly
[1:50:53] in you're late and you're get there and
[1:50:55] you wait you got a you got a little
[1:50:56] smart car reserved over there and one of
[1:50:59] those little tiny putt puts and uh and
[1:51:02] uh you you you you that's all you could
[1:51:04] afford so you reserved it and everything
[1:51:06] you got down to the to the desk and the
[1:51:08] man says I've been traveling a lot of
[1:51:09] time these things happen they really do
[1:51:12] and uh he says to he says to you oh sir
[1:51:15] I'm sorry oh yes you said said yes yes
[1:51:18] yes oh that smart car you had reserved
[1:51:20] guess what we don't have it we don't
[1:51:21] have it
[1:51:23] period but I got a brand new Lexus would
[1:51:26] you like to get in that so so it can
[1:51:29] change either way amen but with God it
[1:51:31] changed from bad to good it changes from
[1:51:33] negative to positive amen all the time
[1:51:35] how many love the Lord how many like the
[1:51:38] salad God bless you amen it's it's light
[1:51:42] fair but it really prepares the way for
[1:51:44] the good preaching that's going to be
[1:51:46] coming here I really believe it does I
[1:51:48] believe that's why God narrowed it down
[1:51:49] from all those sermons to just this one
[1:51:52] amen so the word but godic suggests an
[1:51:55] intervention to move from one event to
[1:51:56] another from one situation to another
[1:51:59] from one condition to another amen and
[1:52:02] and and it uh it speaks of redemption it
[1:52:04] speaks of God's love it speaks of moving
[1:52:06] on the God moving on the scene to uh to
[1:52:10] to as a as an interloper as a as an
[1:52:13] interceder as someone who steps between
[1:52:16] you and it you and that you and whatever
[1:52:20] it is it steps me between you and you it
[1:52:25] steps between you and you amen blessed
[1:52:29] be the name of the Lord it not what you
[1:52:31] know it what knows you amen and knows
[1:52:34] who you are aren't you glad for that and
[1:52:36] and then he stands in the gap for you
[1:52:38] see the love love The Power of Love is
[1:52:42] the greatest force in the universe that
[1:52:45] friends you can get so
[1:52:47] rotten a human being can get so bad that
[1:52:50] nobody going to stand in the gap for him
[1:52:52] then nobody going to take their side
[1:52:54] amen amen amen you know the thief on the
[1:52:58] cross was so bad but he was hanging out
[1:53:00] with a guy maybe worse than him I don't
[1:53:02] know but in their business together but
[1:53:04] they go both got caught on there they
[1:53:06] are both on both sides of Jesus but one
[1:53:08] of them there was a but God moment
[1:53:11] coming for him the other one he was just
[1:53:14] he was just cursing he was blaspheming
[1:53:17] amen listen don't
[1:53:19] blaspheme by saying God can't help me
[1:53:22] don't blaspheme by saying my pastor
[1:53:25] can't help me anymore don't blaspheme by
[1:53:29] saying my brothers in the church don't
[1:53:32] can't help me anymore because what
[1:53:33] you're doing is you're rejecting God's
[1:53:35] love cuz God's Love Takes human form
[1:53:38] friends the miracle about it is he takes
[1:53:40] the form and the devil doesn't see him
[1:53:43] you know that Jesus was the same Christ
[1:53:45] that was Michael in the beginning and
[1:53:47] Lucifer and him were together for
[1:53:48] thousands of years and here they meet
[1:53:50] later and Lucifer did not recognize
[1:53:54] Michael amen and he said if you be the
[1:53:57] Son of God how many of you ever say
[1:54:01] that Lord Jesus if you be the Lord if
[1:54:04] you be Christ if you I used to but I
[1:54:07] don't anymore brother cuz I know he is
[1:54:10] nowall Peter didn't know about it but
[1:54:12] one day when that Revelation came to
[1:54:14] Peter he said Thou Art the Christ
[1:54:16] brother I'm not looking for anybody else
[1:54:19] amen but then what happened to Peter
[1:54:22] he didn't see the rest of the story
[1:54:26] unfolding how many of you like me if you
[1:54:28] saved 10 years 15 years ago and you
[1:54:30] thought the Rapture be not over by now
[1:54:32] we'd be out of here yeah and we wasn't
[1:54:36] going to have all these
[1:54:37] problems and the ride was just going to
[1:54:39] get sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and
[1:54:42] sweeter and sweeter and sweeter with the
[1:54:45] love of God he gets sweeter and sweeter
[1:54:47] the message gets sweeter and sweeter but
[1:54:50] come to find out there was corruption in
[1:54:52] us that only bitter herbs can take out
[1:54:56] amen amen blessed be the name of the
[1:54:58] Lord so thank God for that you say well
[1:55:00] I like the sweet better all right you
[1:55:02] might your man part does but I think my
[1:55:05] soul part likes the real shaking part
[1:55:09] amen of the message of the hour how many
[1:55:12] believe that so we're going on here a
[1:55:14] few seconds
[1:55:16] more these are going to be long seconds
[1:55:19] and these are like
[1:55:26] thousand one that's
[1:55:33] weird there's there's a joke about that
[1:55:35] but I don't tell jokes in the
[1:55:40] Pulpit you uh you got to uh just keep
[1:55:45] pulling and God will feel you I I want
[1:55:48] that I want God to pour out his holy
[1:55:50] spirit his
[1:55:51] love I think we know about love a little
[1:55:53] bit the longer we battle against
[1:55:56] everything that ain't love you know
[1:55:58] sometimes you come to know something
[1:56:00] true by seeing all the
[1:56:02] counterfeit like the bankers and people
[1:56:04] that study money you know they study all
[1:56:05] the they can pick up a counterfeit bill
[1:56:08] right like that because they're handling
[1:56:10] the right all the time but you know on
[1:56:13] the other hand people that are in this
[1:56:14] message that are taking most of their
[1:56:16] inspiration from
[1:56:21] the then new
[1:56:23] sacrifice I've heard this some people
[1:56:25] they oh it's in the five-fold ministry
[1:56:28] now I said well it should be because we
[1:56:32] should be feeding on those tapes night
[1:56:33] and
[1:56:35] day then they go and they go don't they
[1:56:37] brother George and they go they but but
[1:56:40] now those tapes is an old sacrifice you
[1:56:44] cannot get cleaned by old
[1:56:47] sacrifice my brother I have something to
[1:56:49] say to that person amen I said first of
[1:56:51] all you are never going to pre preaching
[1:56:52] my church again second of all he said I
[1:56:55] I didn't really mean it the way it
[1:56:57] sounded I said then why did it sound the
[1:56:59] way we got it why didn't you explain
[1:57:04] yourself he said well I didn't want to
[1:57:07] he say kind of what I've been feeding on
[1:57:08] I said where did you feed on that where
[1:57:10] did you feed on
[1:57:12] that what do you got to what do you got
[1:57:14] to preach to the bride that the prophet
[1:57:16] didn't
[1:57:17] say what do you got the preach that the
[1:57:19] prophet didn't say
[1:57:23] well this this this we're going deeper
[1:57:24] we're going deeper than he ever could
[1:57:25] because we outlived him my brother
[1:57:27] you're lying you are absolutely telling
[1:57:30] a lie God in that day it's it is
[1:57:33] finished he said it is finished he
[1:57:36] finished the mysteries of God he
[1:57:39] finished the the open book he finished
[1:57:42] the closed book he finished your life
[1:57:45] off he finished you as a finished
[1:57:48] product and he said I don't call you the
[1:57:51] church no no longer I call you bride now
[1:57:56] you are moved
[1:57:58] into
[1:58:00] Glory yes
[1:58:02] [Applause]
[1:58:08] sir man if salad can make you that happy
[1:58:10] what will the real meat I'm telling you
[1:58:13] what brother every quote of the Prophet
[1:58:15] one quote one quote can change your life
[1:58:19] one word can change your direction
[1:58:23] how many believe that I'm going to read
[1:58:25] a few scriptures where the word but God
[1:58:26] is used it's used a lot of times in the
[1:58:30] Bible I lost the exact
[1:58:33] number 49 times but God is used in the
[1:58:36] Bible it's used brother Rand used it 400
[1:58:38] sometimes in the quotes but God so
[1:58:42] here's one and Abraham and Sarah went
[1:58:46] she's my wife and they were down there
[1:58:48] in guer and the King aimc which is a
[1:58:52] pretty good man and he was looking for
[1:58:54] another wife a younger one a more
[1:58:57] beautiful one and here Sarah and Abraham
[1:58:59] had been changed back she was youthful
[1:59:02] and beautiful fair to look upon and
[1:59:05] Abraham was strong and he had gone young
[1:59:08] again so that they could they could
[1:59:10] fulfill the
[1:59:12] promis and then as a result of that aimc
[1:59:17] said who is this beautiful girl and
[1:59:20] Abraham said well she's my sister
[1:59:22] well it wasn't really a lie and yet it
[1:59:24] was a lie the prophet God said he lied
[1:59:27] so if if you know that isn't the whole
[1:59:29] story you should tell the rest all
[1:59:31] right otherwise it's a lie you're
[1:59:34] purposely keeping something way but he
[1:59:37] had to say that reason why was fear now
[1:59:39] what was Abraham doing having fear
[1:59:41] because he got out of the promised land
[1:59:43] he had left where the blessings he left
[1:59:45] when you get away from those tapes when
[1:59:47] you get away from this message when you
[1:59:49] get away from a pastor who's preaching
[1:59:51] this message friend you're going to
[1:59:53] you're going to start having fear friend
[1:59:54] you're going to have fear now you're
[1:59:57] going to be afraid this isn't going to
[1:59:58] work that ain't going to work this a't
[1:59:59] to work that isn't going to work amen
[2:00:02] pretty soon you be want to Suicide
[2:00:04] yourself The Whole World's full of it
[2:00:06] now if you don't want to Suicide
[2:00:07] yourself you'll go out there and start
[2:00:09] shooting at cops and they'll suicide you
[2:00:11] one way or another it's a cop out it's a
[2:00:14] yeah that's a play on words but it's a
[2:00:16] it's a it's a way of back and out where
[2:00:17] you don't have to take responsibility
[2:00:20] but brother when God comes to you and

[2:00:44] would preaching he still had that
[2:00:45] Evangelistic fire even as the deeper he
[2:00:47] went in God he always had that reaching
[2:00:49] out reaching out cuz he loved people
[2:00:52] how many believe brother Bam could could
[2:00:54] could spread the blanket over you
[2:00:56] brother amen even though didn't seem to
[2:00:59] be enough for both of you but he'd

[2:01:13] measure his suit and give him his suit
[2:01:15] right there on the platform you talk
[2:01:17] about what seems to be silly what seems
[2:01:19] to be but brother that's what love will
[2:01:21] make you do sometimes things that
[2:01:23] everybody else can't understand but then
[2:01:25] when they start grumbling about it your
[2:01:28] love will still be strong for them you
[2:01:30] will never say oh they're they're just
[2:01:32] you know they just don't have the spirit

[2:01:39] thought had no Revelation got had more
[2:01:41] than I

[2:07:48] be yourself you got to be just where the

[2:07:54] [Applause]
[2:07:57] brother just be
[2:07:59] yourself God made you the way you are
[2:08:02] specifically trained you and and used
[2:08:05] you and put you in that position where
[2:08:06] you're at so he could step into
[2:08:11] you and be an irresistible Force to
[2:08:16] somebody
[2:08:18] amen
[2:08:19] amen and we believe that so
[2:08:22] Abraham but God came on here's another
[2:08:24] thing about Abraham and I think I'll
[2:08:25] close on this and this will be we'll
[2:08:28] call this part one
[2:08:37] salad so here's
[2:08:40] Abraham and I love this part it just
[2:08:42] seems to get so good you know deeper
[2:08:45] when they get deeper in the message
[2:08:50] were we're looking for a
[2:08:55] place where we can
[2:09:00] live that God can use
[2:09:02] us when we're not even capable amen
[2:09:08] amen now I think I'm getting to that
[2:09:10] part in life for you know used to travel
[2:09:11] like four or five times a year overseas
[2:09:13] for up until about two years ago now as
[2:09:15] we had some health concerns and things
[2:09:18] we thought well I'll just say all my all
[2:09:22] my uh preaching and going overseas and
[2:09:25] conventions and things has come to a Hal
[2:09:27] but next year I'm back at it again hope
[2:09:31] but you know when reality hits and you
[2:09:32] may not be able
[2:09:35] to you can still project love amen
[2:09:39] because love doesn't just sit around
[2:09:40] that's right love doesn't just sit
[2:09:42] around how many got a holy spirit inage
[2:09:44] just sits around in
[2:09:47] there you got to stir him up that's what
[2:09:49] the Bible says stir him up it's like
[2:09:50] preaching you know
[2:09:51] stir up that gift that's in you stir up
[2:09:54] that life that's in you stir up that
[2:09:55] fire sometimes my stove I I still burn a
[2:09:58] wood stove up there you you wouldn't
[2:10:00] want that in Tucson it burn you out of
[2:10:01] the house right brother Dennis but we
[2:10:03] thank God for wood otherwise we'd be out
[2:10:05] of our house right brother Dennis we
[2:10:07] couldn't afford the electric bill up
[2:10:09] there where it gets real cold so I get
[2:10:11] that Fire Burning Brother David I never
[2:10:14] taught you how to really get a fire
[2:10:15] burning so hot that you couldn't stand
[2:10:17] being in the house cuz that's what I do
[2:10:19] and then when it D down you start feel
[2:10:21] chill little chill comes on you got to
[2:10:23] get you don't need to throw new wood on
[2:10:25] there you just need to go stir up those
[2:10:27] coals that are in there stir up the fire
[2:10:29] you once had amen stir up that fire that
[2:10:32] was once in there that's what these
[2:10:33] meetings are supposed to do it better
[2:10:36] maybe not teach you new things but
[2:10:37] reinforce the old things maybe get you
[2:10:40] back to the love amen maybe starting
[2:10:42] with salad isn't so bad you know the
[2:10:44] heavy meat and everything but brother
[2:10:45] don't let it ever become a head
[2:10:47] knowledge right brother right brother no
[2:10:49] so many times you see that with people
[2:10:51] qu quote quote the prophet quote quote
[2:10:53] just what the prophet said there's no
[2:10:54] feeling brother there's no feeling
[2:10:57] that's why I like to go back to the tape
[2:10:58] and hear hear the feeling that brother
[2:11:00] Brandon preached this with brother
[2:11:02] brandham didn't say well but but you
[2:11:04] know you were you were once dead and you
[2:11:06] know no we know this and you're all
[2:11:08] scientific but brother Brenham he had
[2:11:10] heartfelt religion brother he had
[2:11:12] heartfelt religion do you believe that
[2:11:15] and God used him and he came down like
[2:11:17] Jesus Christ did in his day and brother
[2:11:19] brandom was Among Us to to project love
[2:11:23] and to stand in the gap for us all amen
[2:11:26] but you say well why am I here still
[2:11:28] standing in the gap for them standing
[2:11:30] the gap for somebody else for your
[2:11:31] family member for somebody on the street

[2:11:37] matter with you go out there and start
[2:11:39] talking start telling people start
[2:11:41] witnessing but I'm afraid they won't
[2:11:43] receive it what's the matter your
[2:11:44] feelings up on your shoulder you're such
[2:11:46] a baby that somebody's somebody resists
[2:11:49] you you haven't got no love love is more
[2:11:53] powerful than resistance

[2:11:59] one day I was out in the park down there
[2:12:01] Fourth Avenue in tucon I said my soul

[2:13:09] you I was there I know what you're going
[2:13:13] through see that you have to know where
[2:13:14] people are you have to know Jesus had to
[2:13:16] catch their Spirit right brother Ram had
[2:13:18] to catch their Spirit when you have love
[2:13:21] you you're able to tune in how many
[2:13:22] believe that is this okay am is this a
[2:13:25] way get you a little bit of last morsel
[2:13:27] of salad here that you could catch their
[2:13:30] spirit and you could feel like all right
[2:13:32] I can't say everything but if I just say
[2:13:34] the right thing oh brother it isn't in
[2:13:38] the abundance of words in abundance of
[2:13:40] knowledge amen it's by a simple
[2:13:43] Revelation some little something that
[2:13:45] sticks with a
[2:13:47] person and he
[2:13:49] said you say one more more word and I'm
[2:13:51] going to turn my dog loose on
[2:13:55] you and he said sick but he didn't say
[2:13:59] it like he usually
[2:14:00] does something had come over him and he
[2:14:03] was
[2:14:04] afraid he was afraid that wasn't Ted how
[2:14:09] many knows it isn't
[2:14:10] you it's love that does that in you love
[2:14:14] creates love is a creative it creates an
[2:14:16] atmosphere when you have love you can
[2:14:18] create an atmosphere you can change the
[2:14:21] atmosphere how many needs to change the
[2:14:23] atmosphere in your home around your job
[2:14:25] or in your situation change it out clean
[2:14:28] it out clean it out change it amen and I
[2:14:32] I I was just praying I Lord I'm not
[2:14:35] afraid of his dog biting me if if that
[2:14:38] has to happen I'm just if if I'm a fool
[2:14:41] I'm your fool Lord I was just saying it
[2:14:43] in my
[2:14:44] heart how many know God hears that kind
[2:14:46] of
[2:14:48] prayers because he lives in your heart
[2:14:50] he is close to where he
[2:14:52] lives even if you whisper you close to
[2:14:55] where he lives when you're praying in
[2:14:56] your heart like the woman you know went
[2:14:59] and said inner heart if I could just
[2:15:02] touch His Garment rather that was right
[2:15:04] there because the inner heart was that
[2:15:05] love that God was pulling her can you
[2:15:07] say amen hallu and he said sick but the
[2:15:11] dog didn't recognize his voice and the
[2:15:12] dog sat still
[2:15:15] there then this man looked and he lost
[2:15:19] it cuz Sinners when they can't control
[2:15:21] something they just blow their top yes
[2:15:24] when they can't understand something
[2:15:26] they just blow their top yes newborn
[2:15:28] Christians if they're not full of the
[2:15:30] Holy Ghost yet they still got to get
[2:15:32] that
[2:15:33] sanctification they'll blow their top
[2:15:36] and things don't go the way they wanted
[2:15:37] it to go amen cuz that human love is
[2:15:40] still there brother say that self love
[2:15:44] and that love in the last days lat
[2:15:47] Church age brother said that self L and
[2:15:48] love for material things would literally
[2:15:51] take the place of the love of God in the
[2:15:54] church but not in this church right
[2:15:57] Shalom Tabernacle not in this church the
[2:15:59] love of God still got his place in this
[2:16:01] church can you say Amen how many says he
[2:16:02] has first place in this church say I
[2:16:05] give the love of God first place in my
[2:16:06] heart did because I want what that
[2:16:09] Prophet had I that Prophet had what
[2:16:11] Jesus had he they had those butt God
[2:16:14] moments going on in their life you had a
[2:16:16] butt God moment I want another one I
[2:16:18] want another one I'm in a place right
[2:16:20] now what but I'm waiting for God to
[2:16:23] intervene and he will because and here's
[2:16:25] why I'm going to stop with
[2:16:29] Abraham you know the the word love was
[2:16:32] never used in the Bible until
[2:16:36] Abraham you know what was going on with
[2:16:38] Adam and God well whatever it was it
[2:16:40] wasn't described like
[2:16:42] love but it was first used with Abraham
[2:16:44] it was this when Abraham God told him
[2:16:48] take your son your only son Isaac whom
[2:16:51] you love right in Genesis 22 amen and
[2:16:54] you offer him to me for a
[2:16:57] sacrifice and we know that brother said
[2:16:59] God was testing Abraham amen amen right
[2:17:04] so hey Abraham goes and he they see the
[2:17:07] mountain far off where the Lord directed
[2:17:08] them to go and he says to the the
[2:17:11] brothers the men family and different
[2:17:14] ones that were going with
[2:17:16] them uh you stay here said I and the lad
[2:17:19] we're going to go up on the mountain and
[2:17:20] I L we going to come back you know just
[2:17:22] prophesying is that
[2:17:24] true how many ever had enough love to
[2:17:26] say something like that amen you just
[2:17:29] knew it was going to happen how many
[2:17:31] here would raise your hand I'm not
[2:17:32] ashamed God spoke something and it
[2:17:35] happened through my life you know with
[2:17:37] brother BR you say well you're trying to
[2:17:39] be like brother friend brother brand had
[2:17:41] those things happen every minute of his
[2:17:43] every minute of his life brother amen he
[2:17:45] was walking in a realm amen what could
[2:17:48] you call the realm that he was in
[2:17:49] perfect love yes perfect Grace perfect
[2:17:53] Mercy amen amen and so here's
[2:18:00] Abraham let's he
[2:18:05] run9
[2:18:09] now that's not funny
[2:18:12] anymore it's timey to
[2:18:15] quit when a preacher Smiles make cracker
[2:18:17] smile or something that people don't
[2:18:19] time to stop
[2:18:22] you learn those kind of things don't
[2:18:26] you here's here's what I wanted to say
[2:18:28] brother
[2:18:29] Joe you've been standing there a long
[2:18:31] time God bless
[2:18:34] you wait a minute is that
[2:18:39] better okay let's back up and get part
[2:18:42] you
[2:18:45] missed and uh so
[2:18:49] Abraham he's
[2:18:51] there and Isaac
[2:18:53] says Papa here's the wood here's the
[2:18:57] fire the words of sacrifice
[2:19:00] and and Abraham says Jehovah Gyra
[2:19:05] amen hallelujah yes sir and so Isaac
[2:19:09] typing Christ that gentle nature
[2:19:12] surrendering his life he laid down
[2:19:16] Abraham maybe tied him down so he
[2:19:18] wouldn't arrive with the pain
[2:19:21] he couldn't stand the thought of it but
[2:19:23] yet he was being
[2:19:26] obedient and
[2:19:29] uh he drew the knife up now Abraham was
[2:19:31] a herdsman you know Abraham was a man of
[2:19:34] butchering animals and things like that
[2:19:36] and said no you know that when a moment
[2:19:39] comes you don't you don't fool around
[2:19:42] amen but Abraham raised his hand he was
[2:19:44] ready and was just
[2:19:47] about three seconds not my kind but 3
[2:19:51] seconds amen and it and it would have
[2:19:54] happened and then God spoke through an
[2:19:57] angel the angel spoke said stay your
[2:19:59] hand Abraham
[2:20:02] amen and here's the words that that
[2:20:04] baffled me baffled
[2:20:07] me because I believe in for knowledge I
[2:20:09] believe that God is in omniscient amen
[2:20:13] he knows everything
[2:20:17] yes but God said
[2:20:21] now I know that you really love
[2:20:24] me I use the word fear that you fear me
[2:20:27] but that word fear if you trace it down
[2:20:28] and I did and I studied It Old Testament
[2:20:31] they used fear and New Testament they
[2:20:33] used
[2:20:34] love fear meant such a reverence that
[2:20:38] came from a close amen Union with God so
[2:20:44] it's
[2:20:45] love now I know you love me
[2:20:50] now I thought God already knew
[2:20:55] that God already knew you loved him but
[2:20:58] why didd he put you through this trial
[2:21:03] amen did he know it he knew it like that
[2:21:05] but then there's something that
[2:21:06] surpasses knowledge like
[2:21:09] that right amen I mean the prophets had
[2:21:13] spoken about it and everything and
[2:21:14] everything all the scripture and the
[2:21:15] prophecies all had to come together and
[2:21:17] it couldn't be it couldn't be this could
[2:21:19] not be the sacrifice yes
[2:21:22] right but he said now I know that you
[2:21:25] love me so here's
[2:21:26] the finish of that Brother David is
[2:21:32] this God would just say it this way he
[2:21:36] couldn't even
[2:21:38] know what was really in him amen until
[2:21:43] he saw it in a
[2:21:44] man and when he saw himself in Abraham
[2:21:48] amen that same love he said now I know
[2:21:50] you love me and then he says out from
[2:21:52] his soul came the blessing of blessings
[2:21:55] upon Abraham said because you have done
[2:21:58] this amen yes now we have brother bam
[2:22:02] making the same stand in this hour and
[2:22:03] God said the same thing to him he said
[2:22:05] because you you have made a glorious
[2:22:08] decision amen and you've chosen the
[2:22:11] right way because it is my
[2:22:13] way
[2:22:16] amen and he said because of this a huge
[2:22:20] portion of Heaven will we granted to you
[2:22:22] brother B said that's not Thousand Acre
[2:22:25] property on on the other side said
[2:22:27] that's the word that's in you that
[2:22:30] you're waiting for to come into
[2:22:33] manifestation God huge portion of Heaven
[2:22:35] is in you waiting to come into
[2:22:37] manifestation then he said this in
[2:22:40] itself if I'm not if I'm not right
[2:22:43] brother Bill you're correct and I know
[2:22:44] you if this in
[2:22:46] itself I I learned that in French but I
[2:22:48] can't repeat it I just forgot the words
[2:22:50] but
[2:22:51] this in itself is that which will make
[2:22:54] which will bring and make come to pass
[2:22:57] the tremendous victory in the love
[2:22:59] divine amen friends when you have love
[2:23:02] divine in your
[2:23:03] life you don't have no
[2:23:06] defeat you got
[2:23:09] Victory amen and it's a tremendous
[2:23:13] Victory because sometimes we got these
[2:23:15] nagging besetting
[2:23:18] sins that we couldn't get rid of
[2:23:21] but once they're gone amen once that
[2:23:24] love just speaks so loud that the Old
[2:23:26] Devil can't hang around like brother B
[2:23:28] said when they was sick said devil you
[2:23:30] like me to praise God said if you do
[2:23:32] hang around but if you don't I'm going
[2:23:33] to praise God for my healing
[2:23:36] anyway and they said brother bam you
[2:23:38] were miserable your face was turning
[2:23:39] blue you were throwing up he said your
[2:23:41] stomach was obviously sick and yet you
[2:23:44] said you were well he said brother you
[2:23:46] got it wrong said that wasn't me that
[2:23:48] was my faith talking
[2:23:50] let your faith do the talking Amen Let
[2:23:52] Your Love do the pushing let your
[2:23:54] desperation do the crying amen I believe
[2:23:56] those things are and let the mercy of
[2:24:01] God show his love to you cuz how would
[2:24:05] you know love if you didn't know Mercy
[2:24:08] right how would I know it's love if it
[2:24:11] wasn't merciful to me amen how many love
[2:24:13] the Lord
[2:24:14] today and mercy is kindness to the
[2:24:18] helpless amen and so that's why brother
[2:24:21] man said perfect strength by Perfect
[2:24:22] weakness he said we think we're so
[2:24:24] strong he said we got to have a killing
[2:24:27] he said' we got to get weak yes and when
[2:24:29] we're weak then we're strong amen aren't
[2:24:32] you glad now we're not going to jump up
[2:24:34] and down and shout when we we're sick
[2:24:37] we're hurting we get a bad diagnosis
[2:24:41] people tell lies about us friends that
[2:24:44] we
[2:24:45] love won't talk to us people turn their
[2:24:47] nose at you instead of their reach their
[2:24:49] hand they turn you the cold shoulder
[2:24:52] that don't feel good that is not fun I'm
[2:24:55] not asking for that but I'm just asking
[2:24:58] for more love to lift me
[2:25:00] higher so I can still keep joyful in the
[2:25:03] midst of it amen amen how many wants to
[2:25:06] have that Joy back in your life the joy
[2:25:08] of the Lord is my strength how are you
[2:25:09] going to get the joy of the Lord well
[2:25:11] what does it matter my love is so strong
[2:25:12] ain't nothing can separate me from the
[2:25:14] love of God that's in Jesus Christ I'm
[2:25:16] all right I'm good to go everything's
[2:25:18] going to be good because love is on the
[2:25:20] seen but God came and changed my life
