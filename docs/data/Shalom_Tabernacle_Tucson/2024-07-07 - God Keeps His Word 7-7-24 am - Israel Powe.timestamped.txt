[9:02] became black as sackcloth see of hair
[9:05] and the moon became as blood and the

[9:47] day of his wrath is come who shall be
[9:50] able to stand it's perfectly turn right
[9:53] back or see what Jesus said you're not
[9:54] Matthew 24:29 listen that's to this ikan
[9:58] case is so forth um immediately after
[10:00] the tribulation of those days shall the
[10:02] sun be darkened the moon shall not uh

[10:29] these angels and so forth and with the
[10:31] sound of a trumpet and Shall Gather them
[10:33] together as the Four Winds strove
[10:34] together see just exactly comparing what
[10:37] Jesus said in Matthew 24 and what the
[10:41] Revelator here opened up in the six seal
[10:44] is just exactly and Jesus was speaking
[10:46] of the tribulation period see first he
[10:50] asked when these things would be when
[10:52] the temple be taken away he answered
[10:54] that next thing he asked when there
[10:56] would have come time there come the
[10:57] Marty Ag and when this would do when the
[10:58] an Christ rise and when the Antichrist
[11:01] would take away the temple Daniel how we
[11:03] could go back and pick up Daniel there
[11:05] when he said that this Prince that would
[11:07] come you readers know that and what
[11:09] should he do he would take away the
[11:11] daily sacrifice and what all would take
[11:13] place during the times that Jesus even
[11:15] speaking of your underline said when you
[11:17] see the Abomination that make a
[11:20] desolation spoken by the Prophet Daniel
[11:22] standing in the Holy place what is that
[11:25] the mosque of Homer stood in the place
[11:26] of the temple when they burned it down
[11:28] said let them that's in the mountains uh
[11:31] let them that's on the housetop don't
[11:34] come down to take things out of the
[11:35] house for him it's in the field return
[11:37] back for there will be a time of trouble
[11:40] you see and all these things would take
[11:42] place moved them on down now and
[11:44] vindicating it back to this opening of
[11:48] the six seal now I want you to
[11:53] notice
[11:55] Jesus uh about tomorrow night on this
[11:58] Jesus Jesus omitted the teaching of the
[12:02] seven
[12:05] seal it's not here watch she goes right
[12:08] on with Parables now after
[12:11] that and John
[12:15] omitted the Seven Seals the seven last
[12:18] the seven
[12:23] seal that's going to be a great
[12:28] thing it's not even
[12:31] written omitted the seventh seal both of
[12:34] them did and the Revelator when God just
[12:38] said was John said it's just silence in
[12:41] heaven Jesus never said a word about it
[12:45] notice now back to the 12th verse notice
[12:48] no beast that's the 12th verse starting
[12:51] off on our seal see it open um no Beast
[12:56] like living creatures is represented
[12:58] here either like was on the fifth seal
[13:01] why this happened the other side of the
[13:04] Gospel age in the tribulation period
[13:08] this six seal is the Tribulation period
[13:11] that's what takes
[13:12] place the bride has gone see there's no
[13:18] living creature nothing there to say it
[13:19] it's just now God is not dealing with
[13:21] the church no more it's been gone he's
[13:23] dealing with
[13:24] Israel this is the other side this is
[13:27] when Israel
[13:29] receive the message of the Kingdom by
[13:33] the two prophets of Revelations 11
[13:36] remember Israel is a nation amen God's
[13:42] servant
[13:44] nation and when
[13:46] when when Israel is brought in it'll be
[13:51] a a national
[13:53] Affair Israel the kingdom age is where
[13:59] David the son of David sits on the
[14:03] throne that's the reason that woman
[14:06] cried thou son of David and David is the
[14:09] son of David God swore by him the David
[14:13] that he had raised up his son that would
[14:15] take his throne and be a Everlasting
[14:19] Throne see it have no
[14:21] end Solon giv in a type in the temple
[14:24] and Jesus just told him here that's
[14:26] there won't be a rock left on one of
[14:28] them but he's trying to tell him here
[14:30] what's he's coming back when are you
[14:33] coming back these things will take place
[14:34] before I come back and here they
[14:37] are now we're at the time of the
[14:40] tribulation
[14:42] remember when the kingdom is set up on
[14:45] the
[14:47] earth uh this may be a little shocking
[14:50] and if there's a question you you still
[14:51] ask me uh if you want to put the
[14:53] question up as it called just hit it if
[14:56] you didn't if you don't already know it
[14:58] in the time of the
[15:01] Millennium it's Israel that's a
[15:06] nation the 12 tribes is a nation but the
[15:12] bride is in the palace amen she's the
[15:16] queen now she's
[15:18] married and all of the Earth shall come
[15:22] in to this city
[15:25] Jerusalem and shall bring the glory of
[15:27] it in there and the Gates will not be
[15:29] shut by by by night because it won't be
[15:32] any night see the gates will always be
[15:36] open and the kings of the earth
[15:40] Revelations 22 bring their honor and
[15:43] Glory into this city Hallelujah but the
[15:46] bride is in there with the
[15:50] lamb oh my you can see that in there not
[15:57] the bride isn't going to be out your
[15:59] laboring in The
[16:00] Vineyards noer she's the bride she's the
[16:05] queen to the
[16:07] king it's the others that labor out
[16:11] there the
[16:13] nation not the
[16:15] bride amen all right notice these
[16:19] Messengers
[16:21] now these messengers of the revelations
[16:25] 12 these two prophets they're going to
[16:27] preach the king kingdom is at hand the
[16:31] kingdom of Heavens to be set up the time
[16:35] last three and one half years of
[16:37] Daniel's 70th week promised to the Jews
[16:41] his people remember now that to prove
[16:45] that that this is Daniel's last part of
[16:50] the 70th week I got a question on that
[16:52] for tomorrow see now 70 weeks was
[16:56] promised which was seven years and in
[16:59] the midst of the seven weeks the Messiah
[17:03] was to be cut off to be made a sacrifice
[17:06] he would prophesy three and one half
[17:09] years then he'd be cut off for a
[17:11] sacrifice for the people and there is
[17:13] still a determination that three and a
[17:16] half years is still determined for
[17:19] Israel then when Messiah was cut off the
[17:22] Jew was blinded so he couldn't see that
[17:24] was Messiah and then when Messiah was
[17:27] cut off then the gospel and Grace Age
[17:30] come to the
[17:32] Gentile and they come down and God pull
[17:35] one from here and there and here and
[17:36] there and put them away Under The
[17:38] Messengers and here and there and here
[17:39] and there put them away Under The
[17:40] Messengers and he sent forth the first
[17:42] messenger and he preached the trumpet
[17:44] sounded we pick it up after a while and
[17:47] then the trumpet was declaring war
[17:49] trumpet always denotes War the messenger
[17:52] the angel come on Earth the messenger of
[17:54] the hour like Luthers like any of the
[17:57] messengers that we talked of what does
[17:59] he do he arise and a seal opens reveal a
[18:03] trumpet sounds war declared and away
[18:05] they go and then the messenger dies he
[18:09] seals away this group they're put in and
[18:11] a plague falls upon those who rejected
[18:14] it see then it goes on then they
[18:16] organize get another organization we
[18:19] just come through it then here they come
[18:21] out with another Power see another Power
[18:24] another age of the church another
[18:25] Ministry and when he does that long
[18:28] comes God with his ministry when the
[18:30] Antichrist comes with his see anti is
[18:32] against they run side by
[18:35] side I want you to notice a little
[18:37] something just about the time that that
[18:42] Cain come on Earth Abel came on
[18:45] Earth I want you to notice just about
[18:48] the time that that Christ came on Earth
[18:51] Judas came on
[18:52] Earth about the time that Christ went
[18:55] off of Earth Judas went off the Earth
[18:58] just just about the time that the the
[19:00] Holy Spirit fell the Antichrist Spirit
[19:03] fell just about the time the Holy Ghost
[19:06] is revealing himself here in the last
[19:08] days the Antichrist is showing his
[19:10] colors kind of through his politics and
[19:12] things and just about time the
[19:14] Antichrist moves himself fully on the
[19:17] stream on the scene God moves himself
[19:19] fully
[19:20] on just run this right together and
[19:24] they're both side by side Cain and
[19:27] abelen The Crow and the dove on the ark
[19:32] Judas and Jesus just on down you can
[19:35] take it just here was Moab and Israel
[19:38] both of them Moab was not a heathen
[19:42] Nation no so they offered the same
[19:44] sacrifice that Israel was offering they
[19:46] prayed to the same God exactly Moab was
[19:51] C was one of Lot's daughters uh that uh
[19:55] slept with their father and had a child
[19:58] and that child was called Moab and from
[20:00] him sprang the Moab
[20:03] race the country of Moab and when they
[20:06] seen Israel their redeemed brother come
[20:10] they were
[20:11] fundamentalists they were a big
[20:13] denomination Israel had no denomination
[20:15] he just dwelt in tents and wherever he
[20:17] could goise Lord hallelujah but Moab had
[20:20] the dignitaries Kings and so forth and
[20:24] they had balum up there a a false
[20:27] prophet and they had all this then they
[20:30] come down there to curse their little
[20:32] brother that was on the road to the
[20:34] promised land going to his promise and
[20:37] he went and asked them can I pass you
[20:39] your land if my cows drink water I'll
[20:41] pay for it if they look up grass we'll
[20:43] pay for it he said no you're not holding
[20:45] no Revival like that around
[20:47] here right you're not holding anything
[20:50] like that around here and then what what
[20:52] he done he come right back in the
[20:54] Jezebel farm and come down through a
[20:57] that false prophet and caused the
[21:00] children of God to a and married Mite
[21:03] women into uh into Israel and caused
[21:07] adultery and he did the same thing in
[21:09] that same age on the journey on the road
[21:11] to the promised land we're on what did
[21:13] he do the false prophet come right
[21:15] around and married and called into the
[21:18] Protestant church and called
[21:19] denominations just exactly what they did
[21:21] back there but little old Israel moved
[21:23] right on the scene she railed in the
[21:25] wilderness for a long time and all them
[21:27] old Fighters had to die but she went
[21:29] right on into the promised land yes
[21:33] watch them all an arm just before the
[21:34] cross the jard I like that now we're
[21:37] getting down to that age right now here
[21:39] now notice now we find out that the time
[21:44] last I said three and one a half years
[21:46] of Daniel's 70 weeks let me explain that
[21:49] a little closer now because I see
[21:51] somebody here that's always watch that
[21:53] now I want to try to make myself clear a
[21:56] teacher notice when the 70 weeks come in
[22:01] when Daniel seen the vision of the time
[22:03] coming and the ending up of the Jews but
[22:06] he said there was determined 70 weeks
[22:09] that's seven years in the midst of it
[22:12] while the Messiah would be here or and
[22:14] would be cut off for a sacrifice now
[22:17] that's exactly what taking place then
[22:20] God dealt with the Gentiles till took
[22:23] out of people for his name as soon as
[22:24] the Gentile church is taken out he taken
[22:27] up
[22:28] the
[22:29] church and when he did the sleeping
[22:31] virgin the church itself the bride went
[22:34] up and the church itself was put into
[22:37] outer Darkness where there's weeping and
[22:38] wailing and ashing of teeth and the same
[22:41] time the tribulation falls upon that
[22:44] people and while the tribulation is
[22:46] falling in there comes these two
[22:49] prophets of Revelations 11 to preach the
[22:52] gospel to them and they preach a
[22:55] thousand 103 score days see well that's
[22:59] exactly with 30 days in a month like the

[1:10:30] while they beheld he was taken up and a
[1:10:34] cloud received him out of their sight
[1:10:38] but ye shall receive power after that
[1:10:42] the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye
[1:10:45] shall be Witnesses unto me both in
[1:10:49] Jerusalem and in Judea all Judea and in
[1:10:54] samarra and unto the uttermost parts of
[1:10:58] the earth amen let's take one more
[1:11:00] scripture found in Matthew chapter
[1:11:10] 24 and verses number 34 and
[1:11:14] 35 and the Bible says Jesus speaking
[1:11:19] verily I say unto you this generation
[1:11:23] shall not pass till all these things be
[1:11:27] fulfilled Heaven and Earth shall pass
[1:11:30] away but my words shall not pass away
[1:11:35] amen today's message the title this
[1:11:38] morning is God keeps his word very
[1:11:41] simple title but we're in that subject
[1:11:43] of you shall uh how to receive more
[1:11:47] power may God add a blessing to the
[1:11:49] reading of his word you may be seated
[1:11:51] God bless each of you and so this
[1:11:56] uh subject of how to receive more
[1:12:01] power is very uh it's a subject that we
[1:12:06] can go on and on and on with and um we
[1:12:12] know with the message that we spoke last
[1:12:15] week that the prophet of God was looking
[1:12:18] for a coming church he was looking for
[1:12:22] it a coming church that had
[1:12:25] the same signs and wonders as displayed
[1:12:29] in Acts where ananas and sa these two
[1:12:35] Believers that came and approached the
[1:12:38] gift of God the wrong way and in doing
[1:12:42] so uh they both suffered with a a
[1:12:45] massive heart attack and they died
[1:12:48] instantly first the wife she came with
[1:12:51] the story and then three hours later the
[1:12:54] husband came with the story sorry
[1:12:57] husband first and then the wife three
[1:13:00] hours later comes with the same story
[1:13:02] and Peter asks the question and then
[1:13:05] declares to her and them why has Satan
[1:13:09] filled your heart that you would lie to
[1:13:12] the Holy Ghost and brother random takes
[1:13:16] that example as many of us do it's one
[1:13:20] of those it's a glaring example that we
[1:13:23] always remember like how brother randam
[1:13:25] titled one of his guns Blondie how many
[1:13:29] remember that he didn't say it many
[1:13:31] places in the message I think it's only
[1:13:32] one place where he titles that but it's
[1:13:34] a remarkable thought to name your gun a
[1:13:38] blonde and your wife is a brunette he
[1:13:40] said because he spent so much more time
[1:13:43] with that but it's just one of those
[1:13:44] points in this ananas and saf Believers
[1:13:48] being death fallowing falling on them as
[1:13:53] the Christian Church their now in this
[1:13:55] new message the movement of the message
[1:14:00] and the Lord is working with them the
[1:14:03] work is growing and growing and these
[1:14:06] two decide to do what others are doing
[1:14:10] but they're wasn't real honest with it I
[1:14:13] really don't think that the Lord was
[1:14:15] concerned about how much money they gave
[1:14:18] or didn't give I think the issue was
[1:14:21] that they lied to the Holy Ghost and
[1:14:25] they had a
[1:14:26] tremendous discernment problem because
[1:14:29] they thought they were just lying to men
[1:14:33] but really they were lying to God and
[1:14:36] God held them responsible for that and
[1:14:38] when that Death Stroke struck that
[1:14:40] couple and they buried them right away
[1:14:44] it caused great fear to fall upon all of
[1:14:47] the church and then people now begin to
[1:14:50] take things serious and as I think of
[1:14:53] this coming church that brother brandham
[1:14:55] was looking forward to he desired to see
[1:14:59] it he wanted to see that and we shared
[1:15:03] those quotes with you last week maybe uh
[1:15:06] sis in the back there if you could take
[1:15:08] that one the last one in the message
[1:15:11] communion and we're going to have
[1:15:13] communion tonight that I kind of labored
[1:15:15] on that that that
[1:15:18] quote um
[1:15:21] and and let's read it read it again
[1:15:25] brother brandom says the trouble today
[1:15:27] of us today what I think I'm saying us
[1:15:30] me and the church that the Lord God has
[1:15:33] let me speak to in these last hours that
[1:15:35] we believe we're in the closing time we
[1:15:39] believe that God has give us a message
[1:15:42] it's been ordained of God it's been
[1:15:44] proven of God it's been showed of God
[1:15:48] now we must come to him with reverence
[1:15:52] and with love and with purity of heart
[1:15:57] and mind and soul you know the hour will
[1:16:00] soon arise when right Among Us will be
[1:16:04] the holy spirit will speak out like it
[1:16:07] did in ananas and saf remember see that
[1:16:11] hour is arriving see and now you just
[1:16:16] remember that see that God is going to
[1:16:18] dwell among his people that's what he
[1:16:21] wants to do now we can receive received
[1:16:25] the message as saying and brother Adam
[1:16:27] continues on and so he and it continues
[1:16:31] on very well too it's very nice to go
[1:16:33] forward but he says that we see that
[1:16:36] hour is arriving it's arriving and let's
[1:16:40] be real honest if there was a church and
[1:16:43] this was that church or your church that
[1:16:46] you Fellowship in was operating in the
[1:16:49] power of God like that um we'd have a a
[1:16:52] different I think we'd have a different
[1:16:54] song service I think our altar call
[1:16:56] would be different I think everything
[1:16:58] about our praise and worship would
[1:17:01] Advance not that we not serving the lord
[1:17:03] now I'm not saying that but I'm saying
[1:17:05] that it would increase even more when
[1:17:07] you knew that death can strike the
[1:17:10] insincere heart funny little feelings
[1:17:14] bad thoughts that we let go unchecked
[1:17:17] saying things and doing things about
[1:17:19] people in the back door the back way
[1:17:21] that we slight people and do things
[1:17:24] that's contrary we know it's contrary
[1:17:26] and just let it go on and if if this
[1:17:30] judgment struck our assembly one or two
[1:17:33] times I think it will
[1:17:35] revolutionize our uh Church attendance
[1:17:38] our worship the altar time our praise
[1:17:40] our worship my preaching
[1:17:43] everything would change would would
[1:17:45] Advance don't would you say so and I can
[1:17:48] say in my in my thinking and looking
[1:17:51] back over my life as a Christian I can
[1:17:54] say say I thank
[1:17:56] God that I didn't go to a church like
[1:17:59] that cuz I might have got struck
[1:18:01] dead I wasn't
[1:18:03] ready but I W to
[1:18:06] be I want to live a life that I can that
[1:18:09] I can be in his presence with the utmost
[1:18:13] sincerity and I'm not hiding or faking
[1:18:16] or trying some kind of
[1:18:18] foolishness and brother Ron was looking
[1:18:20] for this church he said that hour will
[1:18:24] arise and so I believe that if we take
[1:18:29] one
[1:18:30] example in our approach this little
[1:18:34] woman in Mark chapter 7 as we turn there
[1:18:37] quickly the little syap phenician
[1:18:40] woman brother mam uses her many times to
[1:18:43] talk about her approach she's found also
[1:18:46] in Matthew chapter
[1:18:48] 15 how many of you are familiar with the
[1:18:52] text this little woman was a mother
[1:18:54] mother that was coming for prayer for
[1:18:57] her
[1:18:58] daughter and she comes to the right
[1:19:01] place okay she has a need and she comes
[1:19:04] to the right place and she presents the
[1:19:07] need to the right
[1:19:09] person and look at how she's treated in
[1:19:14] Mark chapter 7 in verse let's take it
[1:19:17] here starting from verse number 24 I
[1:19:19] think and from then he arose and went
[1:19:21] into the borders of Tyra and sidon and
[1:19:24] entered into a house and would have no
[1:19:26] man know it but he could not be hid for
[1:19:30] a certain woman whose daughter had an
[1:19:33] unclean Spirit heard of him and came and
[1:19:37] fell at his feet so he wasn't inviting
[1:19:40] people to come he was trying to hide and
[1:19:43] she heard about it and she came
[1:19:47] Uninvited the woman was a Greek ass syri
[1:19:49] Phan by nation and she besought him that
[1:19:52] he would cast forth the devil out of her
[1:19:56] daughter but Jesus said unto her let the
[1:20:00] children first be filled for it is not
[1:20:03] meat to take the children's bread and to
[1:20:06] cast it unto the
[1:20:10] dogs and she answered and said unto him
[1:20:13] yes Lord yet the dogs under the table
[1:20:17] eat of the children's
[1:20:19] crumbs and he said unto her for this
[1:20:22] saying go thy way
[1:20:25] the devil is gone out of thy daughter
[1:20:29] and when she was come to her house she
[1:20:31] found the devil gone out and her
[1:20:34] daughter laid upon the bed I mean Jesus
[1:20:39] just calls her a
[1:20:41] dog but worse than that her daughter had
[1:20:43] a devil so which would you rather be
[1:20:46] called a devil or a dog her daughter had
[1:20:50] a devil so I can be called a dog to get
[1:20:54] this devil devil off of my daughter this
[1:20:56] not about the daughter now this is about
[1:20:59] me standing for my daughter she can't
[1:21:02] stand for herself and brother random
[1:21:04] talks about the approach how this woman
[1:21:08] was
[1:21:09] perseverant she couldn't be offended
[1:21:12] it's like it's gonna take more than that
[1:21:14] to get me to leave this
[1:21:17] church you going to have to do more than
[1:21:19] that Jesus to get me to give up and
[1:21:23] throw my hands in the air and say I quit
[1:21:26] I ain't coming back unlike block
[1:21:29] whatever they do today to to say that we
[1:21:32] are done here but this woman she had a
[1:21:36] perseverance about her and she came to
[1:21:39] Jesus with the right approach brother
[1:21:41] brandom deals with this a bit in the
[1:21:43] message believest thou this in paragraph
[1:21:46] number 80 number 81 right in there now
[1:21:50] watch I look look like she had a right
[1:21:53] to up braid him looked like she had a
[1:21:55] right to scold him ter talking about
[1:21:58] Mary Mary and Martha they say why didn't
[1:22:01] you come Oh I thought you could heal if
[1:22:04] she if she would the miracle would have
[1:22:07] never taken place so he's talking about
[1:22:09] Mary and Martha her brother Lazarus is
[1:22:12] dead they called for him he delayed his
[1:22:16] coming then he finally comes but he's
[1:22:18] late and she came still with the right
[1:22:20] approach and brother vom says it's your
[1:22:23] approach to Divine gift what brings the
[1:22:27] results it's the way you come to it
[1:22:31] isn't that right the way you approach
[1:22:35] anything she come in the right approach
[1:22:38] she came out came out she fell down on
[1:22:41] her knees she said Lord don't disregard
[1:22:45] his title Lord if thou would have been
[1:22:48] here my brother would have not died and
[1:22:50] my that touched him she knew if she
[1:22:53] could get right into his heart she'd get
[1:22:55] what she wanted said Lord if thou would
[1:22:58] have been here my brother would not have
[1:23:01] died but even now Lord whatever you ask
[1:23:05] God God will do it I like that even now
[1:23:09] Lord he's dead been buried four days
[1:23:13] Undertakers taking him out there and
[1:23:15] involving his body put him away he's
[1:23:18] been dead four days he's just mortifying
[1:23:22] in the earth there but even now now
[1:23:25] whatever you ask God God will do it I
[1:23:29] love this perseverance of Mary and
[1:23:32] Martha I love how they come to the right
[1:23:36] one the Lord Jesus who was a friend to
[1:23:39] Lazarus and I love how even it looks
[1:23:42] like all hope is gone they still
[1:23:45] maintain the right
[1:23:47] attitude and it's easy to be offended in
[1:23:52] such a time as this everyone seems to be
[1:23:54] offended I'm offended you're offended
[1:23:57] we're offended so much that we're even
[1:24:00] offended when nobody's offending us
[1:24:03] we're offended when we think we're being
[1:24:05] offended where're they're thinking about
[1:24:07] they talking about us and nobody's even
[1:24:09] thinking about you they're thinking
[1:24:11] about there being offended themselves
[1:24:14] like you offended me no you offended me
[1:24:16] and we F we both feel like we offended
[1:24:18] one another and nobody's offended nobody
[1:24:22] but it's just that time that age that we
[1:24:24] live in that everybody seems to be
[1:24:27] offended but this approach is what I
[1:24:30] want to talk about or deal with just a
[1:24:33] little bit our approach to the gift of
[1:24:37] God the way ananas and Safara approached
[1:24:42] Peter and the church it was the wrong
[1:24:45] approach the way many times we approach
[1:24:48] the message is the wrong approach we
[1:24:51] approach the Bible with the wrong
[1:24:54] approach approach we approach the gifts
[1:24:56] of the Spirit the signs the Wonders the
[1:25:01] Miracles maybe not with the right
[1:25:03] approach but I want you to know that God
[1:25:06] keeps his word and his word is where we
[1:25:10] develop the right kind of approach so in
[1:25:13] other words I can't look at other people
[1:25:16] how they choose to approach I got to
[1:25:19] look into the word and the word will
[1:25:21] determine to me or inspire ire me on how
[1:25:25] to approach his word
[1:25:29] amen approach to a Divine gift so let's
[1:25:33] let's stop on that just a minute I kind
[1:25:34] of got ahead of myself I want to take
[1:25:37] this
[1:25:38] message it's a quote where brother bam
[1:25:41] is talking about
[1:25:44] his new
[1:25:47] ministry and we know the ministries of
[1:25:50] the Prophet the first pool second pull
[1:25:53] and the third pool we we're aware of
[1:25:55] that
[1:25:56] amen can I get a
[1:25:59] witness we're aware that he had these
[1:26:03] pools that were a part or associated
[1:26:06] with his
[1:26:08] ministry
[1:26:10] and in my new ministry the message my
[1:26:14] new ministry brother random is talking
[1:26:17] about this and this is what he says
[1:26:23] here paragraph
[1:26:26] 2117 so he he's talking about you know
[1:26:29] how the Lord called him first to be an
[1:26:32] evangelist to go in the field with the
[1:26:34] Divine gift a gift of Divine Healing to
[1:26:39] all the way all the nations all the
[1:26:41] world in paragraph 2117 he says now I'm
[1:26:44] sure you all could see what it is it's a
[1:26:48] coming of a greater deeper anointing of
[1:26:52] the Holy Spirit how to get into it I
[1:26:57] don't know only thing I know it takes
[1:27:00] God to put you into it so you just live
[1:27:04] a sweet and humble and close to God as
[1:27:08] you can don't doubt him just believe
[1:27:11] that everything is working just to the
[1:27:14] good for you and everything will work
[1:27:18] around all right so here he's talking
[1:27:21] about his new ministry he knows a coming
[1:27:24] Ministry a coming gift up ahead we see
[1:27:28] him looking for this new ministry and
[1:27:31] now he he knows and he classifies it as
[1:27:35] a greater anointing a deeper anointing
[1:27:40] of the Holy Spirit and then he says how
[1:27:43] to get into
[1:27:45] it how to get into this deeper anointing
[1:27:49] this greater anointing and then he says
[1:27:52] live a sweet and humble and as close to
[1:27:56] God as you can I like that I really do I
[1:27:59] like that it puts it back on us in
[1:28:03] Simplicity the prophet of God continues
[1:28:05] on talking about this approach how we
[1:28:07] approach a gift the ministry of Christ
[1:28:16] 1953 and paragraph number
[1:28:22] 61 she just PR pressed right on through
[1:28:25] never paid attention she got out to
[1:28:27] where Jesus was now naturally she had a
[1:28:29] right to abraid him look like to say why
[1:28:33] didn't you come to my brother listen
[1:28:35] close why didn't you come when we called
[1:28:37] you now we left the church we left
[1:28:39] everything we left our priest we went
[1:28:41] against we went against his will we kept
[1:28:44] you in our home we paid you our money we
[1:28:47] fed you with our food we give you
[1:28:50] clothes and when my brother was sick we
[1:28:52] sent for you and you turned your back on
[1:28:55] us and went away every bit of that would
[1:28:59] have been the truth but brother let me
[1:29:02] tell you something now it's your
[1:29:05] attitude towards any Divine gift Let the
[1:29:08] church say any Divine gift any Divine
[1:29:12] gift your approach to that attitude
[1:29:17] determines what you're going to get out
[1:29:19] of it you just come to God in the wrong
[1:29:22] way Jesus just come walking into the
[1:29:26] city but she didn't do that she ran out
[1:29:28] to him she fell down at his feet she
[1:29:30] says Lord that's what he was Lord if
[1:29:34] thou would have been here my brother
[1:29:35] would not have
[1:29:37] died brother bam continues in the
[1:29:39] message Continue for the faith and he
[1:29:41] says this here still talking about our
[1:29:43] approach he
[1:29:46] says now let us be reverent and let us
[1:29:50] take the right attitude towards the Lord
[1:29:52] Jesus for be it assured that your
[1:29:56] attitude towards any Divine gift will
[1:29:59] determine what results you get from it
[1:30:03] the woman that touched His Garment she
[1:30:05] felt virtue but the man who put a rag
[1:30:07] over his face and eyes and said I
[1:30:10] understand that you're a prophet and
[1:30:11] shuck him on the head and said tell us
[1:30:13] who hit you and we'll believe you he
[1:30:15] felt no virtue it was his approach he
[1:30:19] went to Jesus it's the way you come that
[1:30:23] what what that's what it will happen
[1:30:26] just the attitude you take towards it
[1:30:32] amen Lord give me the right
[1:30:35] attitude towards any Divine gift
[1:30:38] continues in the message 1 for
[1:30:52] Life paragraph 8 two just down a little
[1:30:55] bit it says that's the reason Mary got
[1:30:57] something in Martha when she said my if
[1:31:00] you'd have been here my brother would
[1:31:01] not have di but even now if you ask God
[1:31:04] God will give it to you he said I'm the
[1:31:06] resurrection and the life he that
[1:31:10] believeth he that heareth my words he
[1:31:12] that heareth my words has everlasting
[1:31:14] life said I am the resurrection and life
[1:31:17] the way he said it he that was dead yet
[1:31:20] yet shall he live and whosoever liveth
[1:31:23] and believeth in me shall never die said
[1:31:24] believest thou this she said yes Lord I
[1:31:28] believe that you're the Son of God that
[1:31:31] was sent into the world see her
[1:31:33] reverence to approach that gift of God
[1:31:37] he said thy brother shall rise again
[1:31:39] there you are it's your
[1:31:44] approach brother brandom continues on in
[1:31:47] the message believest thou this
[1:31:49] paragraph number
[1:31:51] 114 oh Little Martha come running
[1:31:55] out and she looked like she had a way to
[1:31:57] have something against him why didn't
[1:32:00] you come to my brother look what you've
[1:32:03] done for you look what we've done for
[1:32:06] you and you let us down well if she'd
[1:32:09] have said that the story never would
[1:32:12] have finished the way it did no sir it's
[1:32:15] the way you approach a Divine gift of
[1:32:18] God if God sends a gift you've got to
[1:32:22] approach it right
[1:32:24] if you're ever expected to get anything
[1:32:26] from it you've got to approach it right
[1:32:29] and Martha knew that she probably read
[1:32:32] about the shunamite woman and her baby
[1:32:35] and if that shunamite woman knew that
[1:32:37] God was in Elijah how much more was he
[1:32:39] in Jesus sure so she went up with the
[1:32:43] right at with the right approach she run
[1:32:46] up and fell down at his feet I like that
[1:32:49] fell down at his feet and said Lord
[1:32:52] that's his right TI Idol that's what he
[1:32:55] was he was her Lord Lord if thou would
[1:32:59] have been here my brother would not have
[1:33:01] died oh my I can just imagine seeing his
[1:33:05] great heart as he looked at that
[1:33:07] beautiful woman the tears running down
[1:33:09] her cheeks and said Lord if you would
[1:33:11] have been here my brother would not have
[1:33:14] died watch what he what she said but
[1:33:17] even now Lord though he's dead though
[1:33:20] the skin worms is crawling through his
[1:33:22] body even now Lord whatever you ask God
[1:33:26] God will give it to
[1:33:27] you oh that's the
[1:33:30] secret you might say I've seen through
[1:33:33] every hospital the doctor says I'm going
[1:33:35] to die but even now Lord I'm crippled up
[1:33:40] with arthritis I can't move but even now
[1:33:44] Lord you see that's an attitude those
[1:33:48] aren't just words that's an that's an
[1:33:51] atmosphere that you can walk in no no
[1:33:53] matter what circumstance you're going
[1:33:55] through no matter how bad it is or what
[1:33:58] you going whatever has happened or
[1:34:00] what's about to happen even now Lord
[1:34:04] that's the right attitude that's the
[1:34:07] right approach when you pick up your
[1:34:10] Bible when you come to praise and to
[1:34:13] worship it's the right approach it's the
[1:34:16] right atmosphere it's the right attitude
[1:34:19] even now Lord you can change this
[1:34:22] circumstance brother says oh that's the
[1:34:26] secret this
[1:34:30] approach now this
[1:34:33] woman in Mark chapter 7 brother bam
[1:34:37] deals with her on this quote as it
[1:34:40] pertains to the
[1:34:42] approach paragraph 111 she said truth
[1:34:45] Lord but the dogs can eat the crumbs
[1:34:47] that's under the children's table that's
[1:34:50] got it that got it she was was not a hot
[1:34:54] house plant well how do we know she
[1:34:57] wasn't a hot house you got to call her a
[1:34:59] dog
[1:35:01] first we don't know we solid we strong
[1:35:04] we Believers we don't know what kind of
[1:35:06] believer you are let me call you or your
[1:35:08] daughter a
[1:35:10] dog from the pull pit publicly let me do
[1:35:13] that how many of y'all can take
[1:35:16] it
[1:35:18] huh yes and this is what proves who she
[1:35:22] was Jesus had to call her this this
[1:35:26] example had to live itself out and here
[1:35:29] she is now we're going to find out what
[1:35:32] kind of woman she is that's got it she
[1:35:35] was not a hot house plant she was not a
[1:35:37] highbrid bunch so called Believers that
[1:35:41] we have the crop of today she had a
[1:35:44] genuine Faith she admitted he was right
[1:35:48] but she wasn't after even all the bread
[1:35:52] that the children could eat she was just
[1:35:54] searching for
[1:35:56] crumbs you see a crumb is the right
[1:36:00] attitude no I deserve a loaf I deserve
[1:36:03] more bread I deserve a full plate that's
[1:36:05] the wrong attitude the right attitude is
[1:36:08] just a crumb just a crumb I'll be a dog
[1:36:11] whatever don't shake my hand don't give
[1:36:13] me the worst seed in the house don't
[1:36:15] even matter the right attitude is I just
[1:36:18] want a crumb from the master's table
[1:36:24] Lord help me with my
[1:36:26] attitude she had genuine
[1:36:30] Faith she admitted he was right she
[1:36:34] wasn't after all the bread that the
[1:36:36] children could eat she just searching
[1:36:38] for crumbs we either get the best or we
[1:36:42] don't have any at all we'll walk away
[1:36:46] from it and then say we got faith they
[1:36:49] don't treat me right I'll walk out
[1:36:52] that's not that's no faith that's not
[1:36:56] faith faith is there what I'm trying to
[1:37:00] say to you friends we're going to have a
[1:37:03] prayer line here one of these nights and
[1:37:05] I want to see not one stretcher one
[1:37:08] wheelchair one crutch or nothing but
[1:37:11] laying here on the floor and then
[1:37:13] walking on out see unless you come with
[1:37:15] the right kind of approach you're not
[1:37:17] going to get anything that's right
[1:37:20] you're just walking right through and
[1:37:22] somebody SLA cling a hand on you and
[1:37:25] going on out that's no good you got to
[1:37:27] know what you what you're come he that
[1:37:30] cometh to God Must Believe watch
[1:37:33] remember she had never seen a
[1:37:35] miracle she was a Greek she was a
[1:37:38] gentile she had never seen a miracle yet
[1:37:41] she had faith that there was such a
[1:37:43] thing and year after year and day after
[1:37:47] day we see Miracles and just can't hold
[1:37:50] on an hour or two she was like Rahab the
[1:37:54] Harlot Rahab didn't that Gentile woman
[1:37:58] she didn't want to see how Joshua wore
[1:38:00] his clothes or C Joshua she said I've
[1:38:03] heard and I believe that's all she heard
[1:38:07] and she had believed Jesus said for this
[1:38:11] saying she had the right approach to the
[1:38:14] gift of God remember she was the first
[1:38:17] Gentile that a miracle was ever
[1:38:18] performed on because of her faith faith
[1:38:23] admit M the word is Right humbles itself
[1:38:28] same as it does today now your faith
[1:38:31] will admit that the word of God Is Right
[1:38:34] what is the word of God the word of God
[1:38:36] is the words of the prophets all of them
[1:38:41] the words of the prophets you'll admit
[1:38:44] that that's right and when you hear it
[1:38:47] you'll just comply with the word that is
[1:38:52] right now
[1:38:55] brother Bram as I was going through this
[1:38:57] message in a couple of the prayer lines
[1:39:00] brother branon would call someone out
[1:39:02] under the
[1:39:03] discernment and then he
[1:39:07] would tell the person you had more faith
[1:39:11] than you thought you had it kind of
[1:39:13] would shock them that he would call them
[1:39:16] out and so I looked a little bit further
[1:39:18] and he actually says it many many
[1:39:21] times where a person had more faith than
[1:39:26] they actually thought that they had we
[1:39:29] see this with Moses and this is what a
[1:39:32] good coach will bring out of his uh his
[1:39:37] team or a good teacher brings this out
[1:39:41] of its students its abilities it's
[1:39:45] always up a little bit higher then
[1:39:48] perhaps you realize you think you can't
[1:39:51] sing that those notes they're too high
[1:39:53] or you you think you can't you know
[1:39:56] accomplish that but the word of God and
[1:39:58] a good uh teacher of the word will
[1:40:02] always stretch you out further and bring
[1:40:06] out those talents and Gifts out of you
[1:40:09] that perhaps you don't think you have
[1:40:11] remember when the Lord came to Moses he
[1:40:13] told him you're going to be the one to
[1:40:15] deliver Israel he says he come up with
[1:40:18] all these excuses no I can't speak I
[1:40:20] can't talk and they won't believe me and
[1:40:23] a criminal I'm just running and so forth
[1:40:25] and all and the Lord finally got upset
[1:40:27] with him with all the
[1:40:29] excuses and somehow we make excuses but
[1:40:33] you really have more faith than perhaps
[1:40:36] you realize and sometimes as we said the
[1:40:39] last Services we put too much pressure
[1:40:42] on ourselves to make something happen
[1:40:45] when it's God is the one that makes
[1:40:48] anything happen but our job is to be
[1:40:52] sincere and to be humble
[1:40:54] and to walk before him in the Simplicity
[1:40:57] of a Christian Life he'll take care of
[1:41:00] the rest of it and sometimes we we want
[1:41:03] to be the one in control of
[1:41:07] everything but God's the one that's in
[1:41:10] control any gifts any signs any wonders
[1:41:14] they're in the word of God and we should
[1:41:16] be able to see those in the word of God
[1:41:18] and then uh believe for those and don't
[1:41:23] back up on them don't make excuses
[1:41:25] because we don't see them and don't use
[1:41:27] other churches or other people or even
[1:41:29] your past as an example this is the
[1:41:33] example does the word of God say it is
[1:41:37] it on the tapes is it in the message
[1:41:40] then that becomes your example you
[1:41:43] always want your faith to look up to the
[1:41:45] word and not find this you know Common
[1:41:50] attitude or atmosphere that we see
[1:41:52] Prevail at many many times you see it
[1:41:55] and then when somebody does have faith
[1:41:56] everybody starts well we don't do that
[1:41:59] here no more yeah they used to do that
[1:42:01] we don't you find some old
[1:42:04] grump spiritual Grump no they're not
[1:42:07] enthused they're not excited they just
[1:42:09] read it already yeah I heard that quote
[1:42:11] already read it
[1:42:13] again read it again and say Amen again
[1:42:16] you know the Grump like yeah we heard
[1:42:18] that you already stretched that re you
[1:42:20] already said that so come on to the next
[1:42:22] one you didn't say Amen to the first
[1:42:27] one yes it's Eternal it's the word of
[1:42:32] God and it needs a childlike Faith
[1:42:37] people that are foolish enough to
[1:42:39] believe it seems that it says exactly
[1:42:42] and it means exactly what it says people
[1:42:46] that actually believe that it's the
[1:42:49] impossible that can happen even if we
[1:42:53] never seen it before does God still
[1:42:55] raise the dead well when's the last time
[1:42:58] you seen him do it that don't got
[1:43:01] nothing to do with it he still raises
[1:43:04] the dead he heals the sick he's the
[1:43:08] Healer of our bodies in any
[1:43:10] disease whether we've seen it happen
[1:43:14] years uh uh was it years ago or never
[1:43:17] seen it happen at all if it's in God's
[1:43:19] word we believe it amen and brother
[1:43:23] brandom is talking in this message God
[1:43:25] keeps his word in
[1:43:27] 1957 he says if if God will tell me what
[1:43:32] your need is being that you're in
[1:43:34] contact with the spirit of God now will
[1:43:36] you believe then the plur Z will leave
[1:43:39] you that's right isn't it you got more
[1:43:42] faith than really you thought you had
[1:43:46] now you really know that something's
[1:43:49] anointing you now when I said that that
[1:43:52] just boosted your Faith wasn't that
[1:43:54] right now you look at me as God's
[1:43:56] Prophet you're not from this
[1:43:59] city you're not from around here you
[1:44:01] come from a big place is Detroit that's
[1:44:03] right Elizabeth is your name your last
[1:44:07] name's

[1:44:18] trouble with his legs if you believe

[1:44:31] the Lord wasn't that strange her coming
[1:44:35] right back so I mean it just over and
[1:44:38] over and over just little places through
[1:44:41] the prayer line and in the message Faith
[1:44:44] 56 and the message faith and 58 he says
[1:44:47] he says do you believe that lady sitting
[1:44:50] right there yes you have more faith than
[1:44:52] you thought you had see faith is a
[1:44:55] subconscious Thing lady faith is not a
[1:44:59] mental act see it's something you
[1:45:02] subconsciously do it people try to look
[1:45:06] to their intellects for Faith When Faith
[1:45:08] doesn't lay in here reasons lay here
[1:45:14] Faith lays in the soul now the trouble
[1:45:17] with your foot and leg you believe that
[1:45:20] Jesus Christ will make you well you do
[1:45:23] you accept it so brother bam is here
[1:45:25] telling us that faith is not a mental
[1:45:26] act not something I'm going to think
[1:45:29] more and I'm going to have more faith
[1:45:31] it's down in your soul you already have
[1:45:34] it it's in you now it's there and you
[1:45:40] just believe God be a Christian that he
[1:45:42] made you a Believer you're not trying to
[1:45:46] be a believer you are a Believer and you
[1:45:50] got the faith in you right now if you're
[1:45:52] a believer to receive any healing any
[1:45:56] blessing anything that God's word
[1:45:59] declares you got the faith in you now to
[1:46:03] receive that
[1:46:06] amen and brother Ram brings that out
[1:46:09] again in the message Faith 1958 says
[1:46:12] what about the lady sitting right here
[1:46:13] on the end of the row right back behind
[1:46:15] the gentleman Fanning the baby you had
[1:46:18] more faith than you thought you had you
[1:46:21] believe that hernia will
[1:46:24] will be healed you do wave your hand to
[1:46:26] God if you think it's it'll be healed
[1:46:28] have a prayer card you don't you don't
[1:46:30] need any do you believe brother random
[1:46:34] continues on same thing in the message
[1:46:37] the eagle stirs its nest and just
[1:46:39] reading these to show you it's all
[1:46:41] through the message where this great
[1:46:42] gift is now dealing with people and the
[1:46:45] people trying to muster of Faith
[1:46:47] thinking they don't have faith and the
[1:46:49] prophet is telling them you have more
[1:46:51] faith than perhaps you even
[1:46:54] realize you can overcome my brother my
[1:46:57] sister yes you can you say I can't get
[1:47:01] over this and I can't let that go yes
[1:47:03] you can't but your faith can because
[1:47:07] faith is the
[1:47:08] Overcomer it's by our faith and without
[1:47:12] it actually faith is the most valuable
[1:47:14] thing you got more valuable than what
[1:47:18] you drove here in more valuable what's
[1:47:20] in your bank account your faith is it's
[1:47:23] faith that we please God with it's with
[1:47:26] faith that we will make the Rapture it's
[1:47:30] by faith that we believe that we are
[1:47:32] believers and Christians is by faith
[1:47:34] that we will receive another touch
[1:47:37] Another Blessing another anointing is by
[1:47:41] your faith and that faith is
[1:47:44] unlimited if you can just believe it
[1:47:48] amen Lord increase my faith
[1:47:53] touch my faith one more
[1:47:55] time now I like this one here because
[1:47:57] this deals with something in the
[1:47:59] approach and it deals with something
[1:48:00] with our attitude many time towards
[1:48:03] people who maybe are not in the word
[1:48:05] like us this is in the message
[1:48:08] 1962 in the message why paragraph
[1:48:12] 74 brother manam is dealing in the
[1:48:15] prayer lives little woman s here with
[1:48:17] that trouble with their breasts if
[1:48:19] she'll believe God Will Make Her well
[1:48:21] you believe it lady you do
[1:48:23] you don't have a prayer card you don't
[1:48:25] need one if you'll believe it that
[1:48:27] swelling will go down and you'll be
[1:48:29] normal and well will you believe it all
[1:48:32] right here set a woman sitting here with
[1:48:34] her head down
[1:48:36] praying the woman's going to die if God
[1:48:40] don't help her she's not from here you
[1:48:43] have more faith than you thought you had
[1:48:47] you're from down around Santa Ana you
[1:48:50] got cancer sitting in the wheel you've
[1:48:53] been operated on for it do you have a
[1:48:56] prayer card you don't you don't need one
[1:48:58] you got cancer it's come back God will
[1:49:02] heal you listen someone brought you here
[1:49:05] tonight that was here last night and had
[1:49:08] enough Faith to be called out of the
[1:49:10] line and healed with heart trouble
[1:49:13] that's thus say the Lord here's another
[1:49:15] thing I see you're a woman preacher
[1:49:18] that's right now if you'll believe God
[1:49:20] and won't doubt in your heart you go on
[1:49:23] with your message you just believe if I
[1:49:27] was in your place I believe I would get
[1:49:29] up out of that chair and walk out of
[1:49:31] this building and take God you're going
[1:49:34] to die said in there so I'd come from
[1:49:37] that chair and go believe in God and go
[1:49:41] be well you know what I like about this
[1:49:45] this quote here here's a woman
[1:49:47] preacher and he's showing the same
[1:49:51] respect to this gift like any any other
[1:49:54] patient never rebukes them and we know
[1:49:57] what the word says about it and we know
[1:49:59] that if we can sit down and maybe talk
[1:50:01] to her we might be able to show her in
[1:50:03] the scripture but this wasn't that time
[1:50:06] this is what she needed healing and
[1:50:08] rather brandom says that she could that
[1:50:11] if she'll believe it God and don't doubt
[1:50:13] in her heart she'll be able to go on
[1:50:15] with your message a woman preacher go on
[1:50:19] with your
[1:50:20] message you see this this gift and see
[1:50:24] our approach to other people even when
[1:50:28] the way we witness we shall receive more
[1:50:30] power after the Holy Ghost will come
[1:50:31] upon us so that we can be
[1:50:34] Witnesses this what the Holy Ghost is
[1:50:37] for so it's to be a witness but how can
[1:50:40] you witness to people if you don't
[1:50:42] approach them right you don't even know
[1:50:45] what they're into you don't know what
[1:50:48] politics they're into you don't know
[1:50:50] what their struggle is into and you're
[1:50:52] not even concerned and then think that
[1:50:54] that they're supposed to hear what you
[1:50:57] have to
[1:50:59] say I think I think our approach is not
[1:51:02] just our approach towards the word it's
[1:51:05] our approach towards the message towards
[1:51:07] the gifts towards
[1:51:10] Humanity towards life itself our
[1:51:14] approach towards the time that God gave
[1:51:18] us what if we approach our time knowing
[1:51:21] that we just have a few more days left
[1:51:23] here what if we what if we approach that
[1:51:27] with the attitude you know the Apostle
[1:51:30] Paul they their their their lives were
[1:51:33] centered around the message of their
[1:51:36] day and then everything else they did
[1:51:39] was on the side and it's like we flipped
[1:51:42] that we we have our career is our whole
[1:51:45] life and everything is balled around
[1:51:47] that what we have what we achieve and
[1:51:49] this and that and then we kind of serve
[1:51:51] the Lord on the
[1:51:54] side but I believe that the coming
[1:51:57] church and that that New Testament
[1:51:59] Church that's all they had was the word
[1:52:03] and that's what they lived and they
[1:52:05] pushed it they preached it and they
[1:52:07] lived it and God Vindicated that word in
[1:52:11] their lives I believe I believe that's
[1:52:15] what we're coming back to I believe that
[1:52:17] the church that brother banam is talking
[1:52:20] about that coming church is a sold out
[1:52:23] church it's a church that spends more
[1:52:26] time in the word than it does with
[1:52:30] internet
[1:52:32] entertainment preaching to
[1:52:34] myself preaching to myself right now
[1:52:38] spend more time in this message more
[1:52:43] times in the Bible than is spending on
[1:52:46] some Earthly you know
[1:52:50] Amusement all these time time wasters
[1:52:54] and things that we just get caught
[1:52:56] into oh God help us is my
[1:53:01] prayer in the message the Queen of Sheba
[1:53:05] let me close this off here all right in
[1:53:08] the message the Queen of Sheba brother
[1:53:10] random says this in paragraph 115 how
[1:53:12] many's been in the meeting raise your
[1:53:14] hand now and see that done raise your
[1:53:17] hands everywhere certainly it will it's
[1:53:20] perfect it's God some sometimes times I
[1:53:23] want you to catch this quote here
[1:53:25] sometimes people have more faith than
[1:53:28] they think they have you try to make
[1:53:31] yourself have faith don't do that just
[1:53:35] humble yourself a man setting right in
[1:53:38] there that's light still around him here
[1:53:41] right there didn't it it surprised him
[1:53:44] he had that much Faith that's right is
[1:53:48] that right so here brother bam is
[1:53:50] telling us that sometimes
[1:53:53] some people have more faith than perhaps
[1:53:56] they realize is that you
[1:53:58] today is that you today are you sitting
[1:54:01] there in that Pew with more faith than
[1:54:04] you thought you
[1:54:05] had it's
[1:54:07] there you have more faith than perhaps
[1:54:10] you realize and then when we make these
[1:54:13] things known to you then you say okay
[1:54:15] now let what can I do to make this
[1:54:17] happen and he says don't do that just be
[1:54:21] humble
[1:54:24] be who you are you have to be brother
[1:54:27] Israel I don't have to be brother who or
[1:54:30] sister who you could be what God Made
[1:54:34] You and humble
[1:54:37] yourself you know that coming gift that
[1:54:39] brother Brandon was looking forward to
[1:54:42] he says how can I move into that and
[1:54:45] then the Lord comes to him later and
[1:54:48] shows him this dream of the serpent that
[1:54:52] was going to bite the great Mamba it's
[1:54:55] in the message
[1:54:58] Paradox and then that and in that
[1:55:01] message the
[1:55:02] Paradox in that dream he he saw that
[1:55:05] serpent that God had given him power to
[1:55:08] bind it and then to loose it again how
[1:55:12] many remember the dream it's in the
[1:55:14] message to Paradox
[1:55:16] now if you're a note taker in your mind
[1:55:19] or physically taking notes take some of
[1:55:22] these messages and go hear them it's in
[1:55:24] the message Paradox I want you to get
[1:55:25] the full experience of what he's talking
[1:55:28] about in that quote it's in
[1:55:30] paradx 1961 December 10th
[1:55:35] 1961 it's a spiritual dream it's a very
[1:55:39] intense
[1:55:40] dream he said that he he said he knew it
[1:55:44] was a vision paragraph
[1:55:47] 59 and then when I come into the vision
[1:55:49] again it seemed that I was lifting up
[1:55:51] and I was sitting on a highway a narrow
[1:55:54] Highway with some brother I never knew
[1:55:56] who the brother was I looked around now
[1:55:59] I'm sure I know this is a vision the
[1:56:02] Lord God is here and it seemed like
[1:56:05] everybody was afraid I said what's
[1:56:07] everybody so afraid of and a voice came
[1:56:10] and said there is such danger in these
[1:56:15] days there's a great hideous thing
[1:56:17] that's death when it strikes you now let
[1:56:21] me let me let me stop here just a
[1:56:24] moment are we in worse times World
[1:56:28] speaking than we have ever
[1:56:31] been how many would agree with that has
[1:56:35] the sin and the crime
[1:56:37] increased is it going to get
[1:56:40] better no matter who you vote for right
[1:56:43] let's be clear is it going to get better
[1:56:46] you know they just dropped the gas
[1:56:48] prices what a
[1:56:51] coincidence it's the voting season they
[1:56:53] dropped the the gas prices might get
[1:56:55] better for a season but sin out here on
[1:56:58] the streets it's not gonna get no better
[1:57:02] it's actually getting worse it's
[1:57:04] actually terrible and dangerous times if
[1:57:09] we ever were a time in history a gospel
[1:57:12] preacher or anybody that handles or
[1:57:14] studies the word would have to say if
[1:57:17] you're teaching or preaching to an
[1:57:19] audience if you're going to lead a group
[1:57:20] of people or encour enourage anyone you
[1:57:23] have to bring the intensity of how
[1:57:27] dangerous the times are in this day it
[1:57:30] will be
[1:57:32] irresponsible for us to get up here and
[1:57:35] talk about the popcorn and the candy and
[1:57:37] the balloons and the clowns and the
[1:57:40] rainbows and that's the Christian
[1:57:42] experience no my brother something's
[1:57:44] trying to kill you something's trying to
[1:57:47] bring you down my
[1:57:50] sister AB absolutely that's the hour
[1:57:54] that we're living in and in this Vision
[1:57:57] the voice tells them there are such
[1:58:00] danger in these days I can say that
[1:58:03] too great hideous thing that's death
[1:58:05] when it strikes you and I heard the weed
[1:58:07] smashing down and I looked here come A
[1:58:09] huge monster snake crawling through the
[1:58:11] weeds I thought now knowing this is a
[1:58:14] vision then I shall see what this animal
[1:58:17] or this Beast is and he crawled up on
[1:58:20] the highway and as soon as I got sight
[1:58:22] of him I knew it was a Mamba now a Mamba
[1:58:26] is an African snake which is the most
[1:58:28] deadly bite of all things there is
[1:58:31] there's nothing as poison as a Mamba and
[1:58:35] the snake of course represents sin death
[1:58:38] see in there we have in this country the
[1:58:41] rattlesnake the copperhead the cotton
[1:58:43] mouth moccasin many of those snakes that
[1:58:45] if you're in bad Health one would bite
[1:58:48] you you it would perhaps kill you but
[1:58:52] you didn't get Aid of some sort right
[1:58:54] away then we go on Africa India we find
[1:58:57] a cobra the black cobra and he goes
[1:59:00] through the different snakes paragraph
[1:59:02] 63 then comes the Mamba he's death he's
[1:59:06] so fast you can't see him he goes over
[1:59:10] the tops of the weeds he propels itself
[1:59:13] with the back of his tail whoosh and
[1:59:16] he's gone hits you in the face usually
[1:59:19] stands up high and Strikes hard and when
[1:59:22] he hits you you just got a few breaths
[1:59:25] till you're finished it don't only
[1:59:27] paralyze get into the bloodstream gets
[1:59:30] nerves everything you just die just in a
[1:59:33] few seconds them native boys and track
[1:59:35] boys you can say Mamba and they'll butt
[1:59:38] their heads together scream cuz it's
[1:59:41] death just in a few seconds see when one
[1:59:44] hits you and here he was on the highway
[1:59:47] and I thought well this is it so I
[1:59:49] looked at him and he looked angry at me
[1:59:51] and he licked his tongue and here he
[1:59:53] come but when he got right close he
[1:59:55] would run up fast and then he would get
[1:59:57] slower slower and just quiver and stop
[2:00:00] and something would hold him off he
[2:00:01] couldn't bite me he would turn around
[2:00:04] the other side try to approach from this
[2:00:06] side he would get back and get start and
[2:00:09] swish right towards me got slower slower
[2:00:12] slower and then to a stop then he would
[2:00:15] shake like that and move back he
[2:00:17] couldn't strike me now paragraph 65 let
[2:00:20] me stop here for a minute how many know
[2:00:21] these spiritual things how you know this
[2:00:24] isn't just like a story time how you
[2:00:27] know this is a reality of Vindicated
[2:00:31] Prophet is dropping down a tremendous
[2:00:35] dream of the times that you and I Liv in
[2:00:38] and showing how this Death Strike how it
[2:00:43] operates this is not something you go to
[2:00:45] sleep on this is something that you pick
[2:00:48] up and you bring it in your prayer
[2:00:50] closet and drop down on your knees and
[2:00:54] say Lord help me to be more
[2:00:58] sincere and
[2:01:00] live a Godly Christian humble simple
[2:01:06] life
[2:01:09] amen it's that simple is that simple
[2:01:12] brother will it's catching the vision or
[2:01:16] the or the message hearing it and then
[2:01:19] acting upon it that God keeps his word
[2:01:22] it's just that simple it's not a it's
[2:01:24] not me trying to figure it out or break
[2:01:25] it down or identify this it's just
[2:01:28] simply I heard what he said I heard it I
[2:01:33] can't live the same I can't preach the
[2:01:35] same I can't give my Christian walk the
[2:01:38] same it's got to be an effect of what I
[2:01:41] just
[2:01:42] heard God help us because we know that
[2:01:46] God keeps his word
[2:01:49] amen let me finish this quote okay
[2:01:54] turn looked at my friend he went away
[2:01:56] after my friend and I see my friend just
[2:01:59] jumping way in the air over him and
[2:02:01] trying and the thing was striking him
[2:02:03] and I thought oh if it ever hits him
[2:02:05] it'll be
[2:02:07] instant
[2:02:10] death paragraph 66 just then the serpent
[2:02:14] turned to me when I said that looked at
[2:02:16] me again and a voice came from above me
[2:02:19] and said you have been given power to
[2:02:22] bind him the worst or any and I said
[2:02:27] well God what must I do see there's one
[2:02:31] thing you must do you must be more
[2:02:35] sincere see you must be more sincere I
[2:02:40] said well God forgive me for my
[2:02:42] uninc and let me have sincerity when I
[2:02:46] raised my hands to him again there's a
[2:02:48] great something came over me just lifted
[2:02:51] me up seemed like that my whole body was
[2:02:54] charged with something I look at the
[2:02:57] serpent then he started towards me and
[2:02:59] he couldn't do it yet and I said Satan
[2:03:02] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I
[2:03:05] bind you and the serpent a blue smoke
[2:03:07] flew out of him he curled up and made
[2:03:10] that sign like a s capital S made
[2:03:13] backwards and
[2:03:15] signed means buy this one or anything
[2:03:18] below him cuz he was the worst blue
[2:03:21] smoke fell fell out of him and his tail
[2:03:24] choked his own self to depth around his
[2:03:26] head when he made this backwards s that
[2:03:30] s sign like a conjunction you see choked
[2:03:33] it to death and the brother was free and
[2:03:36] I went over mashed on it I've got to
[2:03:39] find out about it about this because
[2:03:41] it's a vision I hid it one thing and it
[2:03:45] turned like that look like a handle on a
[2:03:47] glass handle on a picture just made a
[2:03:50] solid Crystal and I said think of that
[2:03:52] how quick that blue smoke was life and
[2:03:55] everything it left it all the elements
[2:03:59] turned to Glass just then a voice came
[2:04:02] again it says you can unbind him also so
[2:04:05] I said then Satan that I might know I
[2:04:07] unbind you when I did something come to
[2:04:10] life again wiggling I said I bind you
[2:04:13] back in the name of Jesus Christ and
[2:04:14] when it did the smoke flew out of him
[2:04:16] again he choked himself right back again
[2:04:19] turned to a crystal
[2:04:22] and then when he did that the voice said
[2:04:24] now you must be more sincere than what
[2:04:28] you are to do this then it left me and I
[2:04:33] was standing in the
[2:04:34] room that would be the message to all of
[2:04:36] us here this
[2:04:39] morning uh to be more sincere we've
[2:04:42] heard it before yes we heard it before
[2:04:44] but but let's say this let's say
[2:04:48] that whatever level of Christianity
[2:04:51] you're living on right now whatever
[2:04:52] power of God that God has delivered you
[2:04:54] and lifted you up you're not a
[2:04:57] unbeliever or a make believer you're a
[2:04:59] True Believer but whatever you are now
[2:05:03] let God double that
[2:05:06] anointing so that what you are now you
[2:05:09] are what you are now
[2:05:11] plus that's what I'm talking that's what
[2:05:15] I'm praying for another Touch of his
[2:05:19] anointing over what he's already given
[2:05:22] me this is not taken away he's already
[2:05:25] blessed you to be a Christian you have
[2:05:27] faith more than perhaps you realize but
[2:05:29] can he increase your
[2:05:31] sincerity can he anoint you in the
[2:05:34] spirit can he raise you up that next
[2:05:38] notch or that next level let me say this
[2:05:40] God keeps his
[2:05:42] word God keeps his word and when the day
[2:05:46] of Pentecost was fully come they were
[2:05:48] gathered in one place one mind in one
[2:05:51] Accord
[2:05:52] then suddenly there came a sound from
[2:05:54] Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind and they
[2:05:57] all it filled all the house where they
[2:05:59] were sitting and tongues of fire rested
[2:06:03] upon each of
[2:06:05] them and they were all filled with the
[2:06:08] Holy Ghost and they spoke in
[2:06:12] tongues and Jesus said you shall receive
[2:06:15] power
[2:06:17] after after the Holy Ghost has come upon
[2:06:21] you can I get to one final point is that
[2:06:24] okay brother Joe all right brother Joe
[2:06:28] said it's
[2:06:29] okay one final point and I won't get to
[2:06:32] all of
[2:06:33] it brother brandom introduces in the
[2:06:37] message it's a Easter message the
[2:06:40] mechanics and the
[2:06:43] Dynamics and he introduces this to the
[2:06:47] Believers showing that Believers many
[2:06:51] times so I want you to take that message
[2:06:53] Paradox and go hear it for yourself
[2:06:55] catch that whole dream catch it get the
[2:06:58] inspiration of it under it let it touch
[2:07:01] you and anoint you and you get the
[2:07:03] seriousness of what that Vision or that
[2:07:05] dream was to brother brandham and then
[2:07:07] this message here he's he he deals with
[2:07:10] how
[2:07:12] Believers we put so much stress on the
[2:07:17] mechanics and then not enough on the
[2:07:20] Dynamics and this is and this is the
[2:07:22] point he brings out brother will that I
[2:07:24] didn't never caught before until going
[2:07:26] through it again he says I think it's in
[2:07:29] paragraph number 209 somewhere in
[2:07:33] there he says they had the
[2:07:36] mechanics but they were still
[2:07:40] cowards on the day of Pentecost they had
[2:07:43] the mechanics because they had the word
[2:07:45] they had Jesus they had the promise they
[2:07:48] were in the message they had the
[2:07:50] mechanics but they were still
[2:07:53] cowards but when the Dynamics Came Upon
[2:07:57] on their mechanics then they weren't
[2:08:00] cowards no more they were
[2:08:02] Fearless they were
[2:08:04] Fearless they went forward with the
[2:08:07] boldness of a
[2:08:09] lion and the ox and the wisdom of a man
[2:08:13] and then like a flying
[2:08:15] eagle those Powers just got greater a
[2:08:18] lion a ox a man and other flying like
[2:08:22] eagles another level a greater anointing
[2:08:26] your Christianity
[2:08:28] plus your level of anointing plus where
[2:08:33] you are let God increase that
[2:08:36] plus and take the cowardness out I'll
[2:08:39] read one quote here and notice they were
[2:08:42] cowards notice but they had the
[2:08:44] mechanics see but they were all standing
[2:08:47] back in there saying oh I'm afraid of
[2:08:49] them now I'm afraid to go out
[2:08:52] make a claim cuz oh all of them great
[2:08:55] big Bishops and things out there oh I'm
[2:08:58] afraid to them priests and things I'm
[2:09:00] afraid to make the claim afraid I say I
[2:09:03] believe on him or I just can't do it you
[2:09:06] see but all of the sudden the Dynamics
[2:09:11] came yes and what did it do it not only
[2:09:15] filled their spirit inside but it
[2:09:18] quickened their mechanics
[2:09:22] you know
[2:09:23] this you know highlighting this
[2:09:27] message under the mechanics is one thing
[2:09:31] but when the Dynamics come it highlights
[2:09:33] it even more it don't change the message
[2:09:36] it don't change the words of it it just
[2:09:38] changes me as I'm reading it and that's
[2:09:42] what I'm talking about this
[2:09:44] morning that's what our desire is that's
[2:09:48] what I believe that remember Saints the
[2:09:51] next move for the
[2:09:53] church
[2:09:55] is the changing of our
[2:09:58] bodies and then we go into the
[2:10:01] Rapture is that right Saints the next
[2:10:04] move isn't a prophet to come on the
[2:10:06] scene to get everybody ready nope
[2:10:09] already did that Prophet already came
[2:10:11] that's this message that we're here
[2:10:13] what's the next move for the church
[2:10:15] what's the next great move series of
[2:10:18] camp meetings tent meetings what is
[2:10:20] what's the next move the next move for
[2:10:22] the believer is a body change a
[2:10:26] quickening where that quickening power
[2:10:28] comes over and it your mortal body will
[2:10:30] become
[2:10:31] immortal and then Earth can't hold you
[2:10:34] here no more then you go into the Wrath
[2:10:37] you don't go into a Rapture without a
[2:10:38] body change the next move is a body
[2:10:42] change that's the quickening power where
[2:10:45] I'm really
[2:10:47] healed back a young man again all the
[2:10:50] pain
[2:10:51] gone everything that the church has
[2:10:54] preached and talked about led up to
[2:10:56] comes to this climax right here a body
[2:10:59] changed the dead and Christ shall rise
[2:11:02] first then we which are alive and remain
[2:11:05] shall be
[2:11:06] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[2:11:09] an eye they will be caught up together
[2:11:11] to meet him in the
[2:11:13] air we talk about a Rapture a lot we
[2:11:16] don't talk about this body change
[2:11:18] enough that's the next move
[2:11:22] it's a body change and the body change
[2:11:25] is a real deal it's not like you sitting
[2:11:28] there listening to the tape the
[2:11:30] anointing is on the tape and you can't
[2:11:31] say amen and you'll see it that's not
[2:11:34] what I'm talking about the body change
[2:11:36] is you are
[2:11:38] changed this Mortal puts on immortality
[2:11:41] had so much more to bring out of there
[2:11:43] but we're going to wrap that message up
[2:11:46] right there God help us to take a stand
[2:11:50] on his word that God keeps his word
[2:11:55] that's the right approach keeping the
[2:11:57] right attitude knowing that he does that
[2:12:00] staying with it not trying to make
[2:12:02] something happen be a humble simple
[2:12:05] Christian Life s sincerity means without
[2:12:09] pretense without
[2:12:11] pretending got to be more
[2:12:14] sincere the The Voice told the prophet
[2:12:16] you got to be more sincere to do this
[2:12:19] this is the next greater anointing got
[2:12:21] to be more sincere got to live closer to
[2:12:26] God got to lay aside every
[2:12:28] weight God to draw closer to him that is
[2:12:31] our desire and our prayer God bless you
