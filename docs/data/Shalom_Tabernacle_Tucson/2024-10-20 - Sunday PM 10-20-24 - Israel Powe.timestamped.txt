[40:38] from where we were this morning St Luke
[40:41] chapter
[40:44] 22 we know we're in the battle zone is
[40:46] that right it's war on every

[41:01] Chuck the True Believer will always
[41:03] shine he'll come forward because of the
[41:06] word of God Amen St Luke chapter
[41:12] 22 first off did you enjoy the word of
[41:15] the Lord this morning sir amen it's so
[41:18] good to
[41:19] us Luke chapter
[41:22] 22 verse number 23
[41:29] and they began to inquire among
[41:31] themselves which of them it was that
[41:35] should do this thing and there was also
[41:39] a
[41:40] Strife among them which of them should
[41:43] be accounted the
[41:46] greatest and he said unto them the kings
[41:48] of the Gentiles exercise lordship over
[41:52] them and they that exercise Authority
[41:55] upon them are called benefactor factors
[41:58] but ye shall not be so but he that is
[42:02] greatest among you let him be as the
[42:06] younger and he that is Chief as he that
[42:10] doth
[42:11] serve for whether is greater he that sth
[42:15] at meat or he that serveth is not he
[42:19] that sth at meat but I am among you as
[42:24] he that serveth
[42:33] amen verse 31 let's drop down there and
[42:37] the Lord said Simon
[42:41] Simon
[42:43] behold um let me see here yeah Simon
[42:48] Simon behold Satan has
[42:51] desired to have you that he may sift you
[42:55] as wheat but I pray for thee that thy
[42:59] faith fail not and when thou art
[43:01] converted strengthen thy
[43:05] brother amen what a a beautiful portion
[43:09] of scriptures our lord Jesus is leaving
[43:11] off the scene here and now the disciples
[43:14] started to inquire within themselves and
[43:17] actually started to dispute amongst
[43:19] themselves who is greatest who's in
[43:23] charge who's next and this argument rose
[43:26] up among them not just once this was
[43:29] kind of an ongoing issue that they had
[43:32] and Jesus had to put it in his place
[43:35] didn't he so the Lord bless you may God
[43:37] add a blessing to the reading of his
[43:39] word you may be seated Ephesians chapter
[43:42] 6 is where we were taking our scriptures
[43:46] from Luke chapter 4 also we read the
[43:50] discourse that Satan had with our lord
[43:53] Jesus and then brother random takes the
[43:55] message Harvest Time
[43:57] and shows us the three tactics or the
[44:00] three temptations that Satan attacked
[44:03] Jesus ministers the church the
[44:07] organization and individuals amen and
[44:12] did you learn something this morning you
[44:15] know that's what the word of the Lord is
[44:17] for is to equip Us in the evil day the
[44:21] battle that you're raging against is not
[44:23] me it's not you but Satan is after every
[44:27] one of us and he's trying to get us off
[44:31] of the main path that God has called for
[44:34] us so simply put the scripture gives us
[44:38] the whole armor of God that we should
[44:40] put on the whole armor of God so that
[44:44] you would be able to stand in the evil
[44:48] day and brother Bandon brings it
[44:52] out that Satan has a A Punch coming to
[44:57] every one of us I don't care who you are
[45:00] and I asked the question it's a real
[45:02] question have you received your punch
[45:05] yet or are you being hit now or is that
[45:09] something in the future we everyone have
[45:13] our besetting sins the weaknesses of our
[45:17] flesh as
[45:19] Believers and brother random tells us
[45:22] that those areas we need to keep them
[45:25] covered in prayer is that right we got
[45:28] to keep those spots covered in prayer
[45:31] the minister and his wife came to him
[45:33] because they were nervous and brother
[45:36] bandam says that you got to keep th that
[45:39] area covered in prayer that everybody
[45:41] has a hit coming a blow an open shot
[45:45] that the way brother Randon put it he
[45:48] legally has a right to do it and um so
[45:53] we want to be prepared for that shot
[45:55] amen so here's what brother bam says in
[45:58] that message Christ is revealed in his
[45:59] own word and he says you read last month
[46:03] reader digest you'll notice the subject
[46:05] there it's on Billy Graham the great
[46:07] evangelist he got so tired he just
[46:10] couldn't hold his meetings he went to
[46:12] Mayo's clinic for a physical checkup
[46:14] there wasn't nothing wrong with him only
[46:16] just didn't doesn't do enough work and
[46:19] they put him to running physical
[46:21] exercise he runs a mile every day and
[46:24] then the article goes on to say that
[46:26] science has proved that today that the
[46:29] young children these little boys and
[46:31] girls hit their middle age at 20 years
[46:34] old and by 25 many times in many cases
[46:37] girls are out of menopause at 25 years
[46:41] old I don't know if you knew it or not
[46:43] but a few nights ago while the Holy
[46:45] Spirit speaking here in the meeting a
[46:47] little girl sitting down here that's
[46:49] exactly what was wrong with that child
[46:52] when it called out I looked at her the
[46:55] second time I looked again and seeing
[46:58] what was the matter I thought it can't
[47:00] be that child is too young but it was
[47:04] menopause about 20 years old 23
[47:07] something like that see my mother your
[47:09] mother struck that age about 45 to 50 my
[47:13] wife struck that age about 35 now it's
[47:16] down to 20 the whole human race is
[47:21] rotten well if them physical beings of
[47:24] our body is tearing down like that from
[47:27] eating hybrid Foods tensions that rotten
[47:32] it does not that also rot the brain
[47:36] cell then when we can see how women can
[47:39] get on the street naked we can see how
[47:41] they can speed through the streets 120
[47:43] miles an hour all these things it comes
[47:46] to a place where the whole nation the
[47:48] whole world not only this nation but
[47:52] everywhere mentally
[47:55] gone and then when we open up those the
[47:58] Lord willing on those seven vows and
[48:01] show those hideous things men will be so
[48:05] insane after a while till they'll
[48:07] imagine their seeing ants the size of a
[48:10] mountain it'll be tormenting women be
[48:14] locust come upon the Earth with long
[48:16] hair to torment women who cut theirs off
[48:19] hairlike women hanging down long teeth
[48:22] like a lion Stingers in their tail like
[48:24] a scorpion and so forth to torment men
[48:28] upon the Earth but then it'll be too
[48:31] late to do anything about it you get it
[48:35] right now you get right now
[48:39] tormenting so brother random is
[48:41] obviously referring to the scriptures in
[48:44] the Book of Revelation the seven last
[48:47] plagues I'm going to give you a
[48:48] reference and you can go read that when
[48:51] you get home it's in your Bible you
[48:53] don't have to understand it all but you
[48:55] should be aware you should become
[48:57] familiar wise with what your word says
[49:01] it's in Revelation 17
[49:03] verse1 also found in Revelations 21
[49:07] these seven last plagues the seven
[49:09] vows but he also speaking of the Locust
[49:12] with hair like women and there were
[49:15] horses actually Locust like horses that
[49:19] hair like women faces like men that's
[49:22] found in Revelations chapter 9 for those
[49:24] of you who want that
[49:27] reference and that's just a
[49:30] prefigure of the Demonic forces that
[49:34] have been poured out and opened up this
[49:36] is why the movie industry is so popular
[49:40] it's supercharged it's Anointed with
[49:45] media and the uh entertainment industry
[49:48] is tremendous because Satan has
[49:52] Unleashed himself and so we Believers
[49:55] are not we're not um ignorant of his
[49:59] devices because what because of the
[50:01] third poll because of the revelation of
[50:04] the Seven Seals because of the opening
[50:07] of the word Luke
[50:09] 17:30 it's called the message it's on
[50:14] tape you read it you hear it there is a
[50:18] preparation taking place every time you
[50:20] read it every time you hear it so let's
[50:23] go back a little bit into this
[50:27] conversation that Satan digs up with
[50:32] job it is in Job chapter
[50:35] 1
[50:39] quickly maybe I'll just quote it I won't
[50:41] read it I I'll read it a little
[50:46] bit in verse
[50:53] number six there was a day when the sons
[50:57] of God came to present themselves before
[50:59] the Lord and Satan came also among
[51:04] them and the Lord said unto Satan whence
[51:07] cometh thou then Satan answered the Lord
[51:10] and said from going to and fro in the
[51:13] earth and from walking up and down in
[51:18] it and the Lord said unto Satan hast
[51:21] thou considered my servant job that
[51:24] there is none like him in the earth a
[51:28] perfect and an upright man one that
[51:30] fearth God and and asseth evil then
[51:34] Satan answered the Lord and said th job
[51:37] fear God for not for nothing Hast not
[51:41] Thou made a hedge about him about his
[51:45] house and about all that he hath on
[51:48] every side thou has has blessed the work
[51:51] of his hands and his substance is
[51:54] increased in the land hand but put forth
[51:58] thy hand now and touch all that he hath
[52:00] and he will curse thee to thy
[52:03] face so we see that Satan here has
[52:09] boundaries we see that Satan can't just
[52:12] go and move in on job he first had to
[52:16] consider
[52:17] him have you considered my servant job
[52:21] he's walking up and down the Earth to
[52:24] and fro he's not walking for the
[52:25] exercise either he's not walking just to
[52:29] see the Earth he's the great tempter he
[52:33] lost his position in heaven brother
[52:36] brandom says in marriage and divorce
[52:38] that he was co-equal with God had all
[52:41] the power that God had except he could
[52:44] not create he was the most beautiful
[52:47] thing that was ever created talented in
[52:50] music the stones that made him up the
[52:53] settings in Gold the topaz and the
[52:56] beauty that he had and his ability to
[52:59] even get a portion of angels to turn
[53:04] their back on the great Jehovah
[53:07] God the almighty God we'd
[53:10] say so his ability as we heard this
[53:13] morning to deceive he's not something to
[53:17] play with or to toy with you don't
[53:19] halfway fight him he's not in it to hurt
[53:22] you he's in it to destroy you if you can
[53:26] but he can't do it if God has got a
[53:29] hedge about you and this is my prayer
[53:33] for my life for my wife for my children
[53:35] for my Ministry for my Christian Journey
[53:39] Lord put a hedge about me on every side
[53:44] like all the way around every spot
[53:47] covered by the blood of him and only him
[53:51] that was worthy for praise hey satan
[53:55] can't get you when God's got you covered
[53:58] there is no security system or insurance
[54:02] plan like what I'm talking about right
[54:04] now the good Lord Is Watching Over Us
[54:08] all day all night we're sleeping at
[54:10] night watching us not thinking about it
[54:13] watching in our ignorance watching us
[54:17] and Satan was watching job and he saw
[54:20] that on every side he couldn't get in on
[54:24] this man he couldn't touch his Ministry
[54:27] couldn't touch him nowhere Satan telling
[54:31] God on every side you got to hedge about
[54:34] him there's a wall of protection around
[54:38] this man that's why he fears you that's
[54:41] why he's blessed oh
[54:45] my but
[54:47] God um takes the challenge and he allows
[54:51] Satan to move against
[54:53] him
[54:55] so we see this wall of protection now
[54:58] it's a beautiful thing to know that
[55:02] first of all we are on The Winning
[55:06] Side how many knows
[55:08] that we already won brother
[55:11] Tim it's a it's a game that's already
[55:14] been played it's like watching who won
[55:17] the Super Bowl last year we already know
[55:21] see we already won the victory is
[55:25] already won one I'm not praying to
[55:28] overcome we have already overcome
[55:32] because the lamb was slain not my
[55:34] righteousness not my goodness the lamb
[55:37] was slain and his blood covered me
[55:41] covers you and I so he gives us the
[55:44] grace and the power to
[55:46] overcome all
[55:48] evils let's look at another portion of
[55:52] scripture here in St Luke chapter 10
[55:56] Jesus now sending 70 and remember these
[56:00] 70 are not going to stay with him but
[56:02] he's sending them and show you how the
[56:05] power of God works and how and we can't
[56:07] get into every aspect of it how Satan
[56:10] and his demons and Devils how they work
[56:13] and how there's a great battle that we
[56:15] are
[56:16] fighting and Satan don't like you and he
[56:20] don't like God and when you made a
[56:22] decision to serve him he put a bullseye
[56:25] on your back my sister my brother he's
[56:29] got a bull's eye on you and in Luke
[56:32] chapter 10 it says in the s0 return
[56:34] again with Joy saying Lord even the
[56:37] devils are subject unto us through thy
[56:41] name and he said unto them I beheld
[56:44] Satan as Lightning falling from Heaven
[56:47] this is our Lord talking to his
[56:48] disciples to the 70 behold I give unto
[56:51] you power to tread on serpents and
[56:54] scorpions and over over all the power of
[56:58] the
[56:59] enemy and nothing by any means hurt you
[57:05] nothing shall by any means hurt
[57:10] you amen there's nothing by any means
[57:15] can hurt
[57:16] you when you know this what are you
[57:19] worried about then when this reality
[57:22] strikes that you're on the winning side
[57:25] and that the lord gave you power to
[57:27] overcome nothing shall by any means hurt
[57:31] you not even the biggest baddest devil
[57:34] not 10 of them not 20 of them not
[57:37] 200,000 of them because greater is he
[57:42] that is in us than he that is in the
[57:46] world nothing can hurt us nothing can
[57:49] harm us if he could stop us he would
[57:51] have stopped us but he
[57:54] can't Oh Glory
[57:58] sir not withstanding in this Rejoice not
[58:02] that the spirits are subject unto you
[58:04] but rather Rejoice because your names
[58:07] are written in heaven I wonder if we
[58:10] knew our names are written in heaven I
[58:11] wonder if that would help the song
[58:13] leader when it's time to praise and
[58:17] worship
[58:19] H I wonder if I got to pump that
[58:22] up I wonder if I got to push you and
[58:25] pull you through the song service drag
[58:29] you through the goodness of the Lord
[58:32] jump you grab you and physically give
[58:35] you a dance but I wonder if you knew
[58:37] your name was written in heaven before
[58:41] the foundation of the I wonder if that
[58:43] can even get a praise the Lord thank you
[58:46] Jesus yes I love you
[58:49] Lord don't Rejoice because the subject
[58:52] the devils are subject to you but
[58:54] Rejoice because because your names are
[58:57] written in
[58:59] heaven then in Luke 22 as we read
[59:04] Simon the Lord tells him the Lord tells
[59:08] uh Peter Simon behold Satan has desired
[59:10] to have you that he may sift you as
[59:13] wheat but I have prayed for thee that
[59:18] thy faith fail
[59:21] not okay so he's not going to just take
[59:24] the Temptation away he's not going to
[59:26] just take the battle away he's going to
[59:29] pray that your faith don't
[59:32] fail I pray for you that your faith fail
[59:36] not and when thou art converted
[59:39] strengthen thy Brothers Acts chapter
[59:43] 26 can I move forward just a little bit
[59:47] this is the Apostle Paul coming to his
[59:51] conversion seeing that he's going to be
[59:54] a secret weapon
[59:56] in the kingdom of God he saw now chasing
[1:00:00] folks but we don't know what he looks
[1:00:02] like when he's turned to
[1:00:04] Paul but finally the Lord catches up to
[1:00:07] him knocks him off his horse and begins
[1:00:10] to reveal to him his purpose in life his
[1:00:14] purpose in the
[1:00:16] ministry and the scripture says in verse
[1:00:18] 16 but arise stand upon thy feet for I
[1:00:21] have appeared unto thee for this purpose
[1:00:25] to make thee a minister and a witness
[1:00:30] both of the things which thou has seen
[1:00:32] and of those things in which I will
[1:00:35] appear unto thee delivering thee from
[1:00:39] the people and from the Gentiles unto
[1:00:42] whom now I send thee to open their
[1:00:47] eyes and to turn them from Darkness to
[1:00:50] light and from the power of Satan unto
[1:00:54] God that they may receive forgiveness of
[1:00:57] sins and inheritance among them which
[1:01:00] are Sanctified by faith that is in me
[1:01:03] you see the purpose that Paul was called
[1:01:06] he was called to go to the
[1:01:09] Gentiles so he had to be saved first his
[1:01:12] eyes the scales come off of his eyes but
[1:01:14] I called you for this purpose to go to
[1:01:17] the
[1:01:18] Gentiles that you might deliver them
[1:01:21] from the power of darkness and from the
[1:01:24] power of Satan unto
[1:01:27] God Amen What a Mighty Ministry did he
[1:01:31] do it yes he did he went into those
[1:01:35] little alleys and those dark places he
[1:01:37] was locked up in prison for it he went
[1:01:39] into places that others wouldn't go he
[1:01:41] went in those places knowing that God
[1:01:43] spoke to him he went in there
[1:01:46] deliberately turning Darkness to light
[1:01:49] grabbing hold of people that are bound
[1:01:52] with Satan and literally breaking them
[1:01:55] out of the darkness of Satan and
[1:01:57] bringing him over into The Marvelous
[1:02:00] Light is that what the gospel did to you
[1:02:04] is that what the message did to you it
[1:02:07] got you where you were and where you
[1:02:10] were and delivered you he said I can't
[1:02:13] do this I'm Bound by this I looked on
[1:02:15] this I did this my whole life the
[1:02:16] message just broke that all up and
[1:02:20] delivered
[1:02:21] you into His Marvelous Light amen
[1:02:28] yes so we see this
[1:02:31] is this great purpose that was in Paul
[1:02:36] now
[1:02:38] this Satan
[1:02:40] desires to have you but he can't have
[1:02:43] you so he's going to make it hard on you
[1:02:47] so when it's time to pray how many's
[1:02:49] ever been sleepy when it's time to pray
[1:02:52] you forgot you made a commitment but you
[1:02:54] forgot remember that I'm going to read
[1:02:56] through the Bible in the year this year
[1:02:58] forgot ran out of time whatever it was
[1:03:01] you know Satan's after you he's out to
[1:03:04] get you he know you ain't going to go
[1:03:07] out here and worship him or go out there
[1:03:09] but he's going to make it very difficult
[1:03:11] and hard for you but I have prayed for
[1:03:16] you Satan desires to sift you as wheat
[1:03:20] but I have prayed for you Satan desired
[1:03:23] to take you out but I got a head about
[1:03:26] you Joe he can't touch you nothing by
[1:03:30] any means shall harm
[1:03:33] you amen I'm talking about the gospel
[1:03:37] Saints I'm not talking about our Good
[1:03:40] Deeds I'm not talking about our
[1:03:43] ability but it is the gospel of the Lord
[1:03:46] Jesus Christ here what brother brandham
[1:03:47] says in this message speak to the Rock
[1:03:50] if I can take 10 more
[1:03:53] minutes now I want you to notice another
[1:03:56] thing before they went
[1:03:59] out calling out now the children of
[1:04:01] Israel was given a sign they went out
[1:04:04] and began to preach to them and we know
[1:04:06] the story and when Moses preached to
[1:04:08] them this is the message speak to this
[1:04:10] rock paragraph 28 God met him and he
[1:04:13] didn't want to go but he give him a sign
[1:04:16] to do a
[1:04:18] healing healing was one of the signs
[1:04:21] next was to perform a miracle with the
[1:04:24] stick and when that was done they
[1:04:28] believed Moses and started on the March
[1:04:30] all right they didn't go very far until
[1:04:32] they got into some trouble every time
[1:04:35] when you start to make a March for God
[1:04:39] look out you're headed for
[1:04:41] trouble huh you're headed for trouble
[1:04:45] the devil's going to lay right along the
[1:04:47] path there to get every foot in he can
[1:04:51] get in he will trip you upset you do
[1:04:56] everything
[1:04:58] mean he's a devil oh I just love to pour
[1:05:02] the scripture on him don't you yes sir
[1:05:05] say it's written the word of the Lord
[1:05:07] that's right God said so the devil hates
[1:05:11] me and I know he hates you too and he's
[1:05:16] my enemy but as long as God's my friend
[1:05:20] I don't have no fear of him I just drive
[1:05:23] him right on back take the word of God
[1:05:26] and move right on back out of his out of
[1:05:30] the place that he thinks he's are
[1:05:33] holding he hasn't got no
[1:05:35] strongholds he's absolutely legally
[1:05:40] defeated in every place the devil hasn't
[1:05:43] got one legal right at all
[1:05:46] nowhere he's just a
[1:05:49] devil and a password that's all he
[1:05:52] hasn't got no legal right to any man
[1:05:55] that that'll accept the promise of Jesus
[1:05:57] Christ he's whipped yes sir he's whipped
[1:06:02] in sickness he's whipped in
[1:06:05] disappointments he's whipped in
[1:06:06] everything he's whipped in death he
[1:06:09] can't scare me he can't scare you that's
[1:06:14] all he is is a big old
[1:06:18] Shadow you know he has no legal
[1:06:21] right he has no power over you did you
[1:06:24] know that that's the word of the Lord
[1:06:27] he's a
[1:06:28] bluff he's a shadow he's a bunch of hot
[1:06:31] air but if you have taken a promise of
[1:06:34] God he has no legal right over you amen
[1:06:39] so we thank the Lord for that he would
[1:06:42] love to have you but he
[1:06:45] can't so
[1:06:48] Satan has tried this tactics many times
[1:06:52] we see him moving up to gain position
[1:06:56] and power let me ask you this what does
[1:06:59] Satan really want from
[1:07:01] you what does he really want from you
[1:07:04] brother will brother
[1:07:06] George sister
[1:07:08] Sharon what is what do you have that he

[1:07:14] something do you know what that
[1:07:17] is or we just pity Patty and just you
[1:07:20] know putting out fires as they come or
[1:07:21] do you know that there's actually a
[1:07:23] strategy against your life
[1:07:27] that it's bigger than tomorrow's washing
[1:07:31] or tomorrow's work that you have in your
[1:07:34] blueprint or your plans for the job or
[1:07:37] your vehicle whatever you got going on
[1:07:38] you know Satan has a plan against you to
[1:07:41] come after you brother Trevor yes he
[1:07:45] does and and he wants something from you

[1:08:32] without me you can do
[1:08:35] nothing I built I created heavens and
[1:08:38] and Earth alone by
[1:08:41] myself besides me there is no other if
[1:08:45] you miss me you missed everything he's
[1:08:48] the only one that if I said that that
[1:08:50] would be Pride if you say that You' be
[1:08:52] off your knock but he says it it is true
[1:08:57] he's the only one that deserves our
[1:08:58] praise and wor but Satan wants us to
[1:09:02] worship Hollywood
[1:09:05] Stars basketball
[1:09:08] teams you are wildc cap for
[1:09:11] Life whatever it is Chicago Bears

[1:09:44] your time he wants your attention he
[1:09:48] wants you to say things that are not in
[1:09:51] the word and this is where he tried to
[1:09:54] get Joel
[1:09:56] to curse God in his face so what did the
[1:09:59] Lord do the Lord turned him loose didn't
[1:10:01] he go get him and look at what he did
[1:10:04] when he hit job can we take it just for
[1:10:07] a moment first thing he did he caused
[1:10:10] the sians to come and steal his Ox s and
[1:10:14] all his donkeys and then killed the
[1:10:16] servants second thing he did was he sent
[1:10:19] a fire they said a fire from God came
[1:10:21] down and burned up the sheep and all the
[1:10:24] sheph Shepherds and
[1:10:26] servants then he turns loose with the
[1:10:29] child Deans that came and stole his
[1:10:32] animals his camel and killed all his
[1:10:35] servants then a great wind from the
[1:10:38] Wilderness blew his son's house down
[1:10:43] that just so happened to have all of his
[1:10:47] children in that
[1:10:49] home it looks like it was a mistake it
[1:10:51] looks like it was an accident it was
[1:10:53] actually an agreement
[1:10:55] between God God said go get them you can
[1:10:58] get them and Satan said I'll get him to
[1:11:00] curse
[1:11:01] you and God said no you won't you can't
[1:11:04] do it he says well go get him just don't
[1:11:06] touch his life and he goes after him and
[1:11:09] he turns all of these you know natural
[1:11:13] disasters a great wind a fire The
[1:11:16] Neighbors come and start coming against
[1:11:19] him and then finally he strikes job
[1:11:23] himself with
[1:11:25] boils from the top of his head to the
[1:11:29] SES of his feet you know God is the
[1:11:32] healer is that right any sickness and
[1:11:35] disease comes from
[1:11:37] Satan all of it but God allows them
[1:11:41] sometimes is that right how many of you
[1:11:43] have ever known a Believer True Believer
[1:11:46] that had to bury a
[1:11:48] child
[1:11:49] huh pretty painful wouldn't you say what
[1:11:53] about more than one child what about all
[1:11:55] all of the children who was behind that
[1:12:00] yes Satan was behind it but who allowed
[1:12:04] it for all these years we were blessed
[1:12:09] and he anointed us and gave us wisdom
[1:12:12] and caused us to grow and caused us to
[1:12:15] prosper and then over one
[1:12:18] season Satan comes and takes all of my
[1:12:22] wealth all of my camels all of my family
[1:12:26] is gone in one
[1:12:29] season but what job say he said what a
[1:12:33] True Believer will say he said blessed
[1:12:35] be the name he didn't do like some of us
[1:12:38] some of us can't take what job went
[1:12:39] through we read about them but think
[1:12:42] about it if it was you would you still
[1:12:44] make it to service would you still have
[1:12:48] a helping hand to the Brethren would you
[1:12:51] maintain your
[1:12:52] integrity in the face of the challenge
[1:12:57] when these evils have happened to you
[1:12:59] you got to know where it's coming from
[1:13:01] brother sister stop weeping stop crying
[1:13:05] about it gge yourself with the knowledge
[1:13:08] of where it's coming from but somebody
[1:13:11] allowed it and the one that allowed it
[1:13:15] got you in his
[1:13:17] hands and he's watching you through the
[1:13:20] test through the
[1:13:22] trial through the situation
[1:13:25] yes
[1:13:26] sir
[1:13:28] heyen somebody allowed it Satan was
[1:13:32] responsible but God allowed
[1:13:35] it think about that then finally his
[1:13:39] health strikes
[1:13:42] him bottom of the SES of his feet the
[1:13:45] crown of his head he grabs an old piece
[1:13:47] of pottery 10 more minutes okay a piece
[1:13:51] of pottery and begins to scratch his
[1:13:53] boils
[1:13:55] laying on an ass sheep wondering what's
[1:13:57] going on can't get a prayer through no
[1:14:00] church members encouraging him he's got
[1:14:03] he's bewildered he don't know what's
[1:14:05] going on he doesn't he can't process

[1:14:10] answer he'll got an
[1:14:12] answer and then his wife his lovely wife

[1:14:25] didn't bring the strength that she
[1:14:27] should have brought to him what she
[1:14:29] bring to him exactly what Satan wanted
[1:14:32] him to say why don't you curse

[1:18:27] Satan we'll move right up can I take one
[1:18:29] more example all
[1:18:31] right I'm going to take the prophet of
[1:18:33] God
[1:18:35] here in the
[1:18:38] message well there's several quotations
[1:18:40] in the message wisdom versus Faith I'd
[1:18:42] like you to get
[1:18:43] that read I gave several references for
[1:18:46] you to get and read for
[1:18:49] yourself but let me pull over with this
[1:18:51] one right
[1:18:52] here now Satan can't make you do
[1:18:57] anything but he can sure encourage you
[1:19:00] or influence you he can't make you but
[1:19:04] you're giving the choice that's in the
[1:19:06] message greatest battle ever fought
[1:19:09] that's the grounds we're
[1:19:11] on wisdom versus Faith worldly wisdom
[1:19:15] versus
[1:19:16] Faith he can't make you do anything but
[1:19:19] you can make him back
[1:19:21] up God gave you that a power and that
[1:19:23] Authority
[1:19:25] he can't
[1:19:27] create but God has given us the power to
[1:19:31] create that's been placed in the man's
[1:19:33] hand and little by little we're creating
[1:19:36] more aren't we but let's take the
[1:19:39] prophet here just for a moment as I as I
[1:19:41] close there so many notes in wisdom
[1:19:43] versus
[1:19:47] Faith but we'll take this one here all
[1:19:50] right
[1:19:51] Saints where the little kitties at all
[1:19:53] the kids from Sunday
[1:19:55] school man they did a good
[1:19:58] job even made me a little
[1:20:02] sword that was so cute wasn't
[1:20:09] it oh
[1:20:11] my did I give that to you sis let me see
[1:20:15] think I have it
[1:20:16] here yes we'll take this here
[1:20:20] here brother bandham now in the
[1:20:22] beginning stages of his ministry he's
[1:20:25] telling us how Satan came to him now God
[1:20:27] is the author of Faith Satan is the
[1:20:30] author of
[1:20:32] wisdom no not that one I'm
[1:20:34] sorry what was uh this is wisdom versus
[1:20:38] Faith the last one that Joe brother Joe
[1:20:40] gave you on the paper there I want to
[1:20:43] read that one this is when he was going
[1:20:45] through his test and his trial I have it
[1:20:46] printed out here but I didn't
[1:20:50] um
[1:20:52] yes and no see can bring it life until
[1:20:55] it's dead and rotten and out of that
[1:20:57] rotten mess when there's nothing else
[1:20:59] left to rot it it's only the life that
[1:21:02] lives when the son comes to God he has
[1:21:04] given test
[1:21:07] plural I stood there that day I remember
[1:21:10] as I took my test when I've been days
[1:21:15] after days months after months and years
[1:21:18] four or five years on the streets
[1:21:21] Corners preaching the gospel and trying
[1:21:24] to do that which was right in God's
[1:21:26] sight and he let my wife go right out
[1:21:30] from under me my baby lying there dying
[1:21:34] and I got down to the baby I says Lord
[1:21:36] God don't let my baby die eight nine
[1:21:40] months old little baby I looked up and
[1:21:42] looked like a black sheet coming down he
[1:21:44] even refused to hear me he wouldn't even
[1:21:47] look at me I raised up about 23 years
[1:21:50] old there laid the wife in the morg he
[1:21:54] ref refused to hear me for her when all
[1:21:57] I had done I said God tell me what I've
[1:22:00] done if I've done wrong punish me not
[1:22:03] then I said what have I done work all
[1:22:07] day preach all night stand on the street
[1:22:09] corners what have I done tell me what
[1:22:12] I've done he wouldn't even tell me then
[1:22:15] Satan come up to my
[1:22:17] side he said then you'll serve him when
[1:22:20] one word would change the whole
[1:22:22] situation one word will save your your
[1:22:24] baby but he refuses to do it he won't do
[1:22:28] it then when one word then you'll go
[1:22:31] ahead and serve him all the human
[1:22:35] reasonings that's right why should i
[1:22:37] serve him if he won't even as much as
[1:22:39] just look down at my baby that'll take
[1:22:42] all it would take and as much as
[1:22:45] I as I had thought I done for him then
[1:22:49] he wouldn't even listen to my own baby
[1:22:51] that was the hardest temptation all all
[1:22:54] human reasonings have broke away why
[1:22:57] should i serve him if he can't do that
[1:23:00] much for me and I go day and night for
[1:23:03] him he even refuses to tell me what I've
[1:23:05] done well human reasonings is gone but
[1:23:10] oh when a man is born
[1:23:12] again that's something in there that
[1:23:15] holds it come down to that spot when I
[1:23:18] thought where did I get her where did
[1:23:22] she come from what am I
[1:23:26] anyhow where did I come from see all the
[1:23:31] human part had broke away then that real
[1:23:33] genuine spirit of God laid there I
[1:23:37] walked over to her put my hands on her
[1:23:39] head she was suffering so bad till her
[1:23:41] little eyes was crossing together I said
[1:23:45] sweetheart in a few minutes I'll take
[1:23:47] you and lay you on mommy's arms out
[1:23:49] there in the morg I'll bury you out here
[1:23:52] under the pine trees and someday Daddy
[1:23:54] will see you again I looked up I said
[1:23:58] God though you slay me yet I'll Trust
[1:24:02] you you gave her you taken her blessed
[1:24:07] be the name of the Lord for then all my
[1:24:10] human reasonings had vanished I was at
[1:24:12] the end of my road but when you come to
[1:24:15] the end of your road then there is that
[1:24:17] real spirit of God there to take you
[1:24:21] over at the time and lift you
[1:24:26] up how many believe
[1:24:29] that that whatever you have God gave you
[1:24:34] and what you don't have God has
[1:24:37] refrained from you getting
[1:24:40] it if I got everything I wanted in life
[1:24:44] I probably wouldn't be serving the lord
[1:24:46] I probably would have lost my mind by
[1:24:48] now and be dead or strung out on
[1:24:50] something if I have got everything I
[1:24:52] wanted in life that I think I wanted in
[1:24:55] life but when I gave my life to him
[1:24:58] everything I need I found in
[1:25:01] him I'm
[1:25:03] satisfied I thank the Lord I ain't lost
[1:25:05] my mind I can read his word it
[1:25:09] challenges me it challenge me today I
[1:25:11] still know how to repent I still know
[1:25:14] how to say I'm sorry there is no message
[1:25:17] I'm I'm afraid of I thank God for the
[1:25:19] that's the grace of God I wouldn't trade
[1:25:22] that for a million dollars
[1:25:24] I wouldn't trade that for the greatest
[1:25:26] amount of friends or anything I'm so
