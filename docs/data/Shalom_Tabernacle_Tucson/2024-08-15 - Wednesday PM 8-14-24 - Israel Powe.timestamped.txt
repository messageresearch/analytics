[35:58] number 18 St John Chapter
[36:01] 13 just before we go to prayer and I
[36:05] really want to go and take some time to

[36:10] more thank you to go into prayer tonight
[36:14] to get into the spirit of prayer as we
[36:16] gather together in his
[36:18] name and
[36:22] um there's a time to read there's a time
[36:25] to study there's a Time time to meditate
[36:29] but there's also a time to pray and I
[36:31] would like for us to get into and
[36:33] sometimes they all go together and but
[36:36] we really like to get into the spirit of

[36:40] and I trust that the Lord Jesus will
[36:43] bless us
[36:45] everyone amen and
[36:51] so in Ephesians chapter
[36:54] 6 verse number 18 says this
[37:00] praying always with all prayer and
[37:04] supplication in the spirit and watching
[37:08] there unto with all perseverance and
[37:12] supplication for All Saints I'll take
[37:14] that one more time praying always now we
[37:18] know this is the Christian armor we've
[37:20] been talking about put on the whole
[37:21] armor of God it says praying always with
[37:25] all prayer and supplication
[37:28] in the spirit and watching there unto
[37:31] with all perseverance and supplications
[37:35] for all the saints amen St John
[37:42] 13
[37:44] 3 4 and
[37:49] 35 our lord Jesus speaking he says when
[37:53] you have that you can say Amen
[38:03] a new
[38:05] commandment I give unto you that you
[38:08] love one another as I have loved you
[38:12] that you also love one another by this
[38:15] shall all men know that you are my
[38:19] disciples if you have love one to
[38:24] another amen may God add a blessing to
[38:27] the reading of his word I bless you may
[38:29] be seated we'll take a a moment and um
[38:33] just so happy to see all of your fine
[38:35] Faces tonight it's good to see you we
[38:38] don't know when it's our last time to
[38:40] come together but it's always good good
[38:42] to see uh sister Bethany and Edward
[38:46] making it back amen and so God bless
[38:49] each of
[38:50] you uh brother bam took a little Message
[38:53] Church order sis uh 1958 I'm going to
[38:56] read a couple places that out of there
[38:59] and just to remind us on a few things on
[39:03] a Prayer meeting just to encourage our
[39:06] heart he takes this message Church order
[39:11] 1958 and as he's laying out the order
[39:14] and the direction of how we should
[39:16] approach the Lord we've been through it
[39:18] many times he says this I think is
[39:21] paragraph
[39:22] 21 in that church order 1958
[39:27] this is a software version so I don't
[39:29] know if that number is the same you have
[39:31] there he says I think that yes I think
[39:35] first that every member or every
[39:37] worshipper of the brandom Tabernacle
[39:40] should be so much in Divine love with
[39:43] each other until it would their hearts
[39:47] would long for each other when they have
[39:49] to go away to leave each other at the
[39:53] service at night I am a True Believer in
[39:56] Divine love
[39:58] the Apostle Paul said that that was the
[40:00] evidence of the Holy Spirit by this
[40:02] manner all men will know you are my
[40:06] disciples said Jesus when you have love
[40:09] one for the other and we believe that
[40:12] it's the love of God that sent Jesus
[40:15] Christ to the Earth to die for us all
[40:19] God so loved the world he gave his only
[40:22] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[40:25] him should not perish but would have
[40:28] everlasting life and the everlasting
[40:30] life here is God's own life because we
[40:33] become Sons and Daughters of God by the
[40:36] baptism of the Holy
[40:39] Spirit which is the Seed of Abraham and
[40:42] gives us the faith that Abraham had when
[40:44] he believed God before he was even
[40:47] circumcised you know this is um this is
[40:51] a a statement that we all know and we've
[40:54] heard it many times John 133 5 by this
[40:58] shall all men know that you are my
[41:01] disciples when you have love one for
[41:06] another and so the spirit as brother
[41:09] random identified it in what house will
[41:11] you build me the spirit of this city
[41:14] Tucson he said I can't think of any
[41:17] place more spiritually dead than the
[41:21] City of Tucson then he talked about the
[41:24] fighting amongst the churches the
[41:26] members the
[41:28] congregations and then so if we just put
[41:30] that aside just for a moment the
[41:33] churches but just just let's focus that
[41:36] to just this little
[41:38] church you know we should have love for
[41:42] every member in this little
[41:45] Tabernacle and if there's anything that
[41:47] we have anything that's
[41:50] contrary that's bothering us between
[41:54] someone we want to get that out of our
[41:56] spirit
[41:57] we just don't want it in our mind we
[42:00] don't want it in our spirit we don't
[42:02] want any funny feeling towards anyone
[42:06] and here brother bam is laying that out
[42:08] to this Divine love that every member
[42:12] should have for one another our care Our
[42:15] concern our love for one another and so
[42:19] that Divine love is is a Divine love for
[42:23] every word of course we know that as a
[42:26] believer
[42:27] we have to love the word of God Amen but
[42:30] it's not just for every word it's for
[42:32] every
[42:33] believer every member and it's even for
[42:38] the
[42:38] Sinner and I think if we can focus our
[42:42] divine love towards everyone you know we
[42:46] have things that we have to get
[42:47] accomplished as we work together we we
[42:51] we we we you know I was listening to
[42:53] brother Dalton's testimony brother Jim
[42:55] Dalton his given us testimony how
[42:58] brother Randon was talking to a brother
[42:59] about those Tall Pine trees that grow so
[43:03] straight and he talked about how he
[43:05] warned that brother to never get off
[43:07] alone to yourself stay in
[43:11] Fellowship because those trees are
[43:13] straight because as they're growing they
[43:16] bump against one another and that
[43:18] straighten that keeps us straight and so
[43:21] it's not that we you know we all need to
[43:24] be
[43:25] bumped huh is that right or wrong we all
[43:29] need a bump every now and and that's
[43:30] what Fellowship is and that's what Godly
[43:33] love for one another is is I want to see
[43:36] the best come out of you you want to see
[43:39] the best come out of me we're on the
[43:41] same team I love you you love me I want
[43:47] you to prosper on every level in your
[43:50] life and I don't want any kind of funny
[43:53] anything towards any family member you
[43:56] know this little group is pulling a sign
[43:58] and that little group has this agenda
[44:00] and this one we can't talk to that one
[44:02] and that one can't speak to this one you
[44:04] just don't want that so we're just
[44:06] reminding one another to love one
[44:09] another this is how Jesus know that
[44:12] you're my disciples when we have love
[44:15] one for
[44:17] another and of course we want to love
[44:20] the word we want to love the sinner but
[44:23] we want to love one another too think of
[44:26] the people that's sitting in this the
[44:29] little families that are associated with
[44:31] this little church and let's move in
[44:34] that direction and so that's what I
[44:35] would like our prayer to be focused on
[44:37] tonight one of the points that I wanted
[44:39] to bring is the unity of the spirit the
[44:43] unity in this little Tabernacle for
[44:47] divine love
[44:49] first now we want the Lord Jesus to show
[44:55] himself in Greater measure in healings
[44:58] and spiritual happenings and the
[45:01] anointing coming in our services this is
[45:05] something that we desire Paul told us to
[45:07] and let's take the scripture in 1
[45:09] Corinthians chapter 12 just for a
[45:14] moment so I'm going to put this this is
[45:16] a bulletin board for our prayer tonight
[45:19] these points please don't forget them
[45:21] just take these few little notes in your
[45:23] mind about being love in the unity
[45:27] and then Desiring we have not because we
[45:30] ask not many times in 1 Corinthians
[45:33] chapter 12 verse 31 says
[45:37] this but covet earnestly that means to
[45:41] desire earnestly the best gifts and yet
[45:45] show I unto you a more excellent way
[45:48] look at verse uh 1 Corinthians 14 ver1
[45:52] follow after charity and desire
[45:55] spiritual gifts
[45:57] but rather that ye may
[46:00] prophesy we want to see we thank the
[46:03] Lord for the healings that we have seen
[46:06] but we want to see those healings
[46:08] increase and I believe that you know the
[46:10] saints that are sick and they're weak
[46:12] and they're Afflicted God has touched
[46:14] them many many times but we want more of
[46:17] that we want to see it happening we want
[46:21] it to raise in our midst we want to see
[46:26] the power of God God and I believe the
[46:27] True Church of the Living God we're not
[46:30] asking for something that's not in his
[46:32] word that is in the word I want a double
[46:35] portion of his anointing I want this
[46:38] church to have a double portion I want
[46:41] the signs wonders and miracles that
[46:43] Jesus said would accompany his church to
[46:47] accompany my Ministry my prayer life and
[46:51] I believe that that should be our prayer
[46:53] tonight as a group of Believers that the
[46:57] holy spirit will answer our prayer
[47:01] requests when we bring them it's very
[47:04] deliberate we're we're not shooting in
[47:06] the dark it's a scriptural prayer
[47:11] desire spiritual gifts the Bible says
[47:14] that and this is in the word amen and so
[47:18] that our healings would increase that
[47:20] the salvation would
[47:22] increase we want to see souls coming to
[47:26] the kingdom you say well brother Israel
[47:28] you know we're in a gleaning time all of
[47:30] all of the you know the great miracles
[47:32] of of of missionary works are beyond our
[47:35] Shores but God is still a
[47:38] savior and our attitude he never told us
[47:41] to stop fishing I mean we're not
[47:43] catching a lot but he never said stop
[47:46] casting the net and when your love is
[47:49] right then your witnessing will be right
[47:52] you view that Center that one you come
[47:54] across in wherever you're traveling
[47:56] you'll start to view them as maybe it
[48:00] could be a seed of God starts with that
[48:03] love for the
[48:04] sinner love for one another love for the
[48:08] word of God Amen our healings would
[48:11] increase our Salvation would increase
[48:14] and then this this is another one that
[48:16] is scriptural I'll read it for you in
[48:17] the message there we want to pray that
[48:20] God would give us greater
[48:25] Revelation and this
[48:27] is on the heels of this tremendous
[48:31] message that we heard on Sunday how many
[48:33] know the seven seal that's a tremendous
[48:35] word of the Lord that was that's it's
[48:38] it's Rich it's very deep it's very heavy
[48:42] there's something for
[48:44] everyone but I don't think it's
[48:46] something that like Revelation is like
[48:48] something well I'm going to listen to
[48:50] the tape I'll listen to the pastor and
[48:52] if it sticks it'll stick to me well
[48:56] that's not the attitude that brother
[48:57] Adam gives us in this quote here I'm
[48:59] going to read for you just for a moment
[49:02] this is in the
[49:03] message
[49:05] um the indictment paragraph
[49:09] 265 1963 the
[49:12] indictment the prophet says now what did
[49:15] they do they didn't know it today men
[49:20] walk ignorantly they don't know that
[49:23] that's the truth they think it's some
[49:25] kind of a ISM
[49:28] they don't dig down deep enough to get
[49:30] into the spirit of
[49:32] Revelation they don't pray enough they
[49:35] don't call upon God enough you know
[49:39] Revelation means so much to us that it's
[49:43] not just a happen stance it's something
[49:46] that we can actually pray for Lord open
[49:49] up my understanding on a level that has
[49:53] never been open before I'm sitting under
[49:56] the greatest Ministry that the world has
[49:58] ever known it's here God gave us that
[50:02] much now Lord open my eyes so I can see
[50:06] what the prophet is saying and just a
[50:08] little crumb just a piece of it just a a
[50:12] table Spoonful a a cup full Lord open up
[50:17] my heart um for divine re Revelation and
[50:22] this revelation God opening up our
[50:25] understanding and revelation
[50:27] is going to is going to help us in our
[50:29] maturity and this is big a big problem a
[50:32] lot of Christians they don't they we're
[50:35] Believers True Believers but they
[50:37] they're they still bicker and complain
[50:40] and trip over the same baby items that
[50:44] we should be maturing over and that's a
[50:47] revelation issue if God is revealing his
[50:50] word to you then that Mellows you out it
[50:54] gives you depth it gives you the ability
[50:58] to work with other people who are
[51:01] immature acting like a baby you know
[51:03] babies start acting like a baby and then
[51:05] we start all acting like bab we all
[51:07] fighting because he started and that one
[51:09] started it who's the adult in the room
[51:12] well the man that has the Revelation the
[51:14] woman that has the Revelation they're
[51:16] the adult in the room the Revelation
[51:18] comes from the word so he said Lord give
[51:21] me a revelation so what so I can argue
[51:24] no so I can change my beh Behavior so
[51:27] that I can mature under this seven seal
[51:31] anointing that I can become a seed of
[51:35] God that's um ready or or or or or or
[51:40] maturing in that atmosphere for the
[51:43] Rapture and so Lord increase our love
[51:48] for one another increase our love for
[51:51] the word increase our love for The
[51:54] Sinner and increase my my revelation of
[51:57] this word every one of us needs a deeper
[52:00] Revelation in his word amen he said well
[52:04] you know I was on this trip here I had a
[52:06] wonderful trip maybe I'll tell you more
[52:07] about it on Sunday the Lord willing but
[52:10] one of me and one of the brothers we
[52:11] were talking and when he first came into
[52:14] the message there was an old Deacon
[52:16] brother that had all the red volumes and
[52:19] me and this Brother Tyrone we were
[52:21] talking about how excited we were when
[52:24] we came to the message and how we were
[52:25] trying to build our library we were just
[52:28] Reminiscing on that and he said one of
[52:30] the deacons told
[52:32] him uh he had all the red volumes
[52:35] sitting on his wall in his study there
[52:38] and the Deacon told him he says Brother
[52:41] Tyrone you can have all of those books
[52:43] because I read them
[52:45] already and I thought that was hilar I
[52:48] was like are you kidding me so you read
[52:51] it already so now you can give it
[52:54] away that that's not the purpose of your
[52:57] seal book or the church age book or any
[52:59] message is that you can get through
[53:01] reading it and then you can pass it on
[53:03] to someone else no you have to
[53:05] internalize it you have to read it again
[53:08] you have to let it soak let it let it
[53:12] let it uh settle in into your heart let
[53:16] God open up another layer to you another
[53:20] level to you and that's a prayer that we
[53:23] can pray now brother bandom tells Us in
[53:26] the message trying to do God a service
[53:29] without being his will in
[53:32] 1965 paragraph 259 and he says this here
[53:36] he says there won't be any denomination
[53:38] just remember brother Jack here is a
[53:41] historian many of you here are there
[53:44] there's never been a Revival about three
[53:47] years after the Revival they started a
[53:49] denomination on it is that right and
[53:51] this last great miracle move of God in
[53:54] this last days it went 20 years and it's
[53:57] a million miles from a denomination
[53:59] going further away all the time the
[54:03] Shucks pulling away no cooperation no
[54:06] nothing with it always it pulls away
[54:09] from it there can't be no more it's a
[54:12] wheat now but we're plenty green uh-huh
[54:16] that's right have to lay in the presence
[54:19] of the sun to be mellowed up that's all
[54:23] of it plenty green we haven't got the
[54:28] sincerity the sacredness the thing we
[54:31] ought to have in our
[54:36] midst showing us to things yet now he
[54:40] says this at the at the end of his
[54:42] ministry this is November of
[54:45] 1965 he makes these statements that we
[54:48] are plenty green we don't have the
[54:52] sacredness or the sincerity this is what
[54:55] he's telling
[54:56] the people that's following the message
[54:58] all right so his ministry is coming all
[55:00] the way up God's getting ready to take
[55:02] him off the scam in just a few days from
[55:05] there around Christmas time and he's
[55:07] making these statements he continues on
[55:10] in the morning message the next day and
[55:13] God's provided place of worship
[55:16] paragraph number 40 look at what he says
[55:19] here and it's just really beautiful to
[55:21] hear it and then put yourself into this
[55:25] time frame he he says I believe the
[55:28] church is beginning to hear the message
[55:32] and begin to understand but friends
[55:36] listen we've got to lay in the presence
[55:37] of the sun we've got to be ripened our
[55:41] faith isn't ripe intellectually we're
[55:45] hearing the message that God has given
[55:47] us and seeing the signs that he showed
[55:49] us and proving it by the Bible it's
[55:52] there but oh how the church needs to lay
[55:55] in his
[55:56] presence till it tenders up you know and
[56:00] gets sweet in the spirit so that it can
[56:04] bathe down sometimes in speaking the
[56:07] message you got to get harsh you have to
[56:09] break it in like that because you got to
[56:11] clinch a nail to make it hold but when
[56:14] the church once gets it the elected is
[56:17] called out and separated then in the
[56:20] presence of God I know it'll be
[56:23] something like the people was there
[56:26] when it takes its Rapture so brother
[56:30] banam is now identifying to the church
[56:33] world to the people uh did you all get
[56:36] that it was 65 you got it he's
[56:39] identifying to the church world to the
[56:41] message Believers
[56:43] followers November
[56:45] 65 that you are beginning to hear the
[56:50] message but you got to lay in the
[56:53] presence of the son to get
[56:57] ripened now I want to be more mature
[57:01] than I've ever been as a
[57:04] Believer I don't want to be so easily
[57:08] upset and teed
[57:10] off from this world's
[57:13] challenges or
[57:16] challenges
[57:18] Believers I believe that you know God's
[57:21] given us a tremendous work a tremendous
[57:23] word and and it's time for us to move
[57:28] on to move on not just to quote battle
[57:34] with someone else a quote and your quote
[57:36] and my quote against you but no I'm
[57:39] talking about maturing in the presence
[57:41] of the Lord and that comes by divine
[57:44] revelation you can't make yourself see
[57:47] anything God make me see God you can't
[57:50] make yourself see anything if you see
[57:52] anything it's because of God's grace but
[57:55] you can sure pray pray for God to open
[57:58] up your understanding when the word is
[58:01] coming forth so that you can leave from
[58:03] the presence of the Lord a better
[58:06] Christian than what you was than the
[58:08] last time you heard the seven seal amen
[58:12] and he says now the church God's only
[58:15] provided play place of worship this is
[58:17] my last quote the church re teach you
[58:20] now but
[58:22] remember when you leave here start
[58:24] moving out of the Shu now you're going
[58:29] into the grain but lay in the presence
[58:32] of the sun don't add what I've said
[58:35] don't take away what I've said because I
[58:38] speak the truth as far as I know it as
[58:42] the father has given to me see don't
[58:57] to come seek the Lord Jesus that's what
[59:00] we're telling you
[59:02] tonight and then you yourselves lay
[59:06] right in his presence just make love to
[59:09] him oh Lord Jesus Son of God I love you
[59:14] tender My Heart Lord take away all the
[59:17] filth and the love of the world let me
[59:20] live holy in this present world before
[59:24] you don't you like that that's coming
[59:27] down to the close of his message there
[59:30] he's telling it's very simple you fall
[59:33] in love with Jesus and he is the word
[59:36] and in falling in love with him you fall
[59:37] in love with his people it's very simple
[59:40] it's difficult to do many times and but
[59:44] we have these little attitudes and these
[59:45] little immature ways about us that the
[59:49] Holy Spirit needs to bake all of that
[59:52] out of us and I don't want to have an
[59:55] attitude toward towards any a bad
[59:57] attitudes towards any other human being
[1:00:01] on this
[1:00:03] planet not in this city not in this
[1:00:06] church not on this
[1:00:07] planet I want my heart free from all
[1:00:13] man free from any um evil gu or
[1:00:18] thinking and that comes as the Holy
[1:00:21] Spirit as I fall in love with
[1:00:23] him as I worship Him
[1:00:26] I seek the Lord and I lay myself right
[1:00:30] in his presence to make love to him oh
[1:00:34] Lord Jesus Son of God I love you tender
[1:00:37] My Heart Lord take away all the filth
[1:00:41] and the love of the world and let me
[1:00:44] live holy in this present world before
[1:00:48] you now we have spoke on that coming
[1:00:54] church that brother R talks about with
[1:00:57] ananas and
[1:00:59] Safar and how no sin will enter that
[1:01:03] church and as I really look into that
[1:01:06] towards myself and you know that no sin
[1:01:09] would enter into me when he's talking
[1:01:12] about the church he's talking about
[1:01:14] people he's talking about people he's
[1:01:16] talking about
[1:01:17] individuals that no sin would enter me
[1:01:20] as an individual that I would make it
[1:01:22] right before I came here to the house of
[1:01:24] the Lord that's what I want to increase
[1:01:28] that's what I'm asking God to increase
[1:01:30] now so that Divine
[1:01:32] love and a second thing that we can
[1:01:35] focus on praying is for Wisdom James 1
[1:01:41] 15-6 says this about
[1:01:45] wisdom I just have one I think those was
[1:01:48] my last scripture here we just take
[1:01:51] James chapter 1
[1:02:00] and verse five if any of you lack wisdom
[1:02:03] let him ask of God that giveth to all
[1:02:06] men liberally and abrath not and it
[1:02:10] shall be given him but let him ask in
[1:02:13] faith nothing wavering for he that
[1:02:16] wavereth is like a wave of the sea
[1:02:18] driven with the wind and tossed how many
[1:02:23] of you here can use
[1:02:26] more wisdom you know wisdom and
[1:02:30] Revelation are the same because the
[1:02:33] foolish version and the wise version the
[1:02:37] wise version had oil in her lap the wise
[1:02:40] version had a true Revelation so this
[1:02:44] Revelation and God giving you wisdom how
[1:02:47] to handle the word let's just take that
[1:02:50] one discipline of not adding or not
[1:02:52] taking away that is a discipline and
[1:02:56] it's easy for us to make the story to
[1:02:58] fit our point to add a little bit of
[1:03:01] juice to the story if we're trying to
[1:03:03] make our point but it but a real True
[1:03:06] Believer a true Minister a true sister
[1:03:10] or brother that that is preaching the
[1:03:12] word or speaking the word you don't need
[1:03:15] to add
[1:03:16] anything not to none of the Visions not
[1:03:19] to none of the word and you don't need
[1:03:21] to take anything away from it don't hold
[1:03:23] that back don't say that they they can't
[1:03:25] take take it you took
[1:03:28] it um you don't add you don't take away
[1:03:33] and this is this is his word that that
[1:03:36] that God gives this discipline for the
[1:03:40] Believers that they don't add they don't
[1:03:43] take away and this is what brother
[1:03:44] random says there in that last message
[1:03:47] that we read for you there is not to add
[1:03:51] not to take away you just say what I
[1:03:54] said
[1:03:56] amen yes are there some things that
[1:03:59] cause controversy of course they're all
[1:04:02] through your Bible but the discipline is
[1:04:05] the maturity is just to say what he
[1:04:09] said I don't have a message I don't have
[1:04:12] to make it sound more interesting I
[1:04:15] don't have to make it sound less
[1:04:18] interest I don't have to do any I just
[1:04:19] have to say what it says and that's
[1:04:23] where the power of God is right there is
[1:04:25] when you don't add to it you don't take
[1:04:28] away from it and then you give everybody
[1:04:30] a chance to hear it just like he said it
[1:04:33] many people they have formed an opinion
[1:04:38] over many of the visions of the Prophet
[1:04:40] because of the ministers that they have
[1:04:42] listened to but you need to go get those
[1:04:45] tapes for
[1:04:46] yourself listen to those visions that
[1:04:49] brother Adam gave in November of
[1:04:52] 65 and then you tell me that you can
[1:04:55] stand before God and say he didn't mean
[1:04:58] what he said or you want to add an
[1:05:00] interpretation to it no no no no
[1:05:02] brothers no my sister you say what it
[1:05:05] says and God will bless it that's where
[1:05:08] the blessing is is when we keep it right
[1:05:10] there and so let's do that and then
[1:05:13] finally so those are two spiritual
[1:05:16] things the Divine love love for one
[1:05:18] another Lord increase our love increase
[1:05:21] the gifts of the Spirit the healings
[1:05:22] signs wonders Miracles your presence
[1:05:26] give us wisdom Lord and then we have
[1:05:30] some natural things that we need
[1:05:32] to we need a church
[1:05:35] building
[1:05:37] and
[1:05:39] God has one for
[1:05:42] us
[1:05:44] and um can't nobody take that from what
[1:05:47] God gave you can't nobody take it from
[1:05:49] you but you have to believe that and you
[1:05:52] have to have faith in that and you have
[1:05:56] to be willing to declare it before you
[1:05:58] see
[1:06:00] it right if his commandment is that we
[1:06:05] have to be gathered in his name I like
[1:06:08] that point John's always brings that up
[1:06:11] the Commandment is that we should Gather
[1:06:12] in his name but he ain't going to
[1:06:14] provide a place to
[1:06:16] gather no he provides a place to gather
[1:06:19] just like he provides everything else
[1:06:21] and you know there's folks here they're
[1:06:24] at the crossroads in their
[1:06:26] careers and they're looking for a place
[1:06:30] to settle themselves for jobs careers
[1:06:34] for school and so forth and we need to
[1:06:38] pray for that that is something that we
[1:06:41] place in the it's a carnal thing it's a
[1:06:43] natural thing but you want to place that
[1:06:45] in the hands of the Lord you don't want
[1:06:48] to go online and compare what everybody
[1:06:51] else says a good job is but you want the
[1:06:54] holy SP Spirit to provide you a job and
[1:06:58] it will be the right job how many can
[1:07:01] say Amen to that how many's ever taken a
[1:07:03] job that it wasn't the right
[1:07:06] job but when God gives you a job and he
[1:07:10] he's able to do that but you have to ask
[1:07:12] him he's able to give you the direction
[1:07:15] that you need you must ask him and those
[1:07:19] are the carnal things career job want to
[1:07:21] pray for our musicians our deacons our
[1:07:25] chur trustees the
[1:07:27] administration those that handle every
[1:07:30] aspect of the church and the orders of
[1:07:33] the thereof pray for that do that
[1:07:38] there's three things the Divine love
[1:07:41] wisdom of God and administration in
[1:07:44] these carnal things in our life and I
[1:07:46] believe God will do that amen we'll
[1:07:49] search our hearts and we'll see if
[1:07:52] there's something developing in our mind
[1:07:54] towards someone
[1:07:56] towards some group say Lord take that
[1:07:58] out of me no I want to have perfect I
[1:08:01] want to have pure love for every man
[1:08:03] every woman I want my I want my thoughts
[1:08:06] and my attitud my thoughts to be
[1:08:09] positive towards everyone and keep me
[1:08:12] Lord in the place that you've called me
[1:08:14] to be that's what I want that's my
[1:08:18] prayer little things develop all the
[1:08:20] time people meeting one another after
[1:08:23] service jacking them up
[1:08:26] um if it was in a playground it'd be a
[1:08:29] fist fight but it's we're so spiritual
[1:08:32] we ain't going to swing on you but we do
[1:08:35] it spiritually we got attitude we need
[1:08:38] to get let that go we need to let the
[1:08:40] Holy Spirit give us love for every
[1:08:43] member on every Pew not just the nice
[1:08:46] ones that are like

[1:09:22] revelation that you have to give me I
[1:09:25] can't make myself more mature but the
[1:09:28] wisdom of God coming down will give me
[1:09:31] that and I believe we can pray I just

[1:09:34] they're scriptural for us to ask for
[1:09:36] that amen amen God bless you we'll take
