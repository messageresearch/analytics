[52:53] his Gallant stand on the Gospel of Jesus
[52:56] Christ and
[52:58] we recognize brother sister that we're
[53:00] standing before the purchase of his
[53:03] blood
[53:04] we don't take that lightly
[53:07] our desire tonight of course is just to
[53:11] as God would help us get out of the way
[53:14] and have him speak to us through his
[53:16] word amen we can turn the pages of this
[53:20] Bible
[53:21] we can read the statements and quotes of
[53:24] our seventh Church age messenger but God
[53:27] Alone is the only one that can give
[53:30] divine revelation of his word so we're
[53:33] depending on him tonight
[53:35] praise the Lord we thank the musicians
[53:39] and
[53:41] brother Tim I didn't realize you
[53:44] could play one of those things he did a
[53:46] beautiful job there
[53:49] I wish I could sit on a box and make it
[53:51] sound like that
[53:54] it's tremendous
[53:56] brother Trevor good to see you on the
[53:58] steel and just each and sister Sharon
[54:01] and God bless you brother Zach good to
[54:03] see all of you
[54:04] praise God I feel I just feel at home
[54:08] amen praise God
[54:11] brother George you know when you've got
[54:14] brother George in the meeting he's
[54:16] really the only one you need
[54:23] I know I'm going to hear some amens
[54:26] I'm just going to have to have the
[54:28] brothers turn this mic up so you can
[54:31] still hear me
[54:33] so it's just good you can tell I'm
[54:35] feeling right at home
[54:37] God bless you tonight
[54:40] if you would turn in your Bibles with me
[54:42] I want to read from the gospel of Saint
[54:45] John chapter 16.
[54:48] and as the Lord will help us tonight
[54:52] we have several messages up here
[54:56] um
[54:57] and
[54:58] we want to just take some things that
[55:03] brother Branham preached uh later in his
[55:05] ministry
[55:07] late 61 brother banham preached a
[55:10] message
[55:12] there in the Branham Tabernacle you must
[55:14] be born again
[55:15] and then January of 65 he preached a
[55:19] message birth pains
[55:23] so here I've got both these messages up
[55:26] here with me tonight they're very very
[55:28] outstanding
[55:29] uh later in brother benham's Ministry of
[55:32] course we know that brother Branham
[55:34] being the manifestation of Malachi 4 5
[55:38] that he was sent to restore
[55:40] the hearts of the children back to that
[55:43] faith that was once delivered to the
[55:45] Saints and uh but just very striking to
[55:49] me the things that he points out in
[55:52] these two messages especially the
[55:54] message in 65 birth pains and so we want
[55:59] to take this text out of Saint John 16
[56:02] which brother Branham refers to this in
[56:05] the message birth pains so we'll pick it
[56:07] up here Jesus speaking verse 20. fairly
[56:13] verily I say unto you
[56:16] that ye shall weep and Lament
[56:21] but the world shall rejoice and ye shall
[56:25] be sorrowful
[56:27] but your sorrow shall be turned into Joy
[56:32] [Music]
[56:34] a woman when she is in travail hath
[56:39] sorrow
[56:41] but her hour is come because her hour is
[56:44] come
[56:45] but as soon as she is delivered of the
[56:49] child she remembareth no more the
[56:53] anguish
[56:54] for the joy that a man is Born Into the
[56:59] world
[57:00] Amen Let us just approach the author for
[57:04] a moment before we're seated Heavenly
[57:06] Father
[57:07] how we thank you tonight Lord from the
[57:10] very depths of our hearts
[57:13] for the grand privilege that you've
[57:15] extended to each of us tonight
[57:18] to be able to assemble ourselves those
[57:21] of like Precious faith Lord in the house
[57:25] of God this evening and Lord we thank
[57:28] you for the privilege and we ask your
[57:31] favors tonight Lord that you would just
[57:34] move us out of the way
[57:36] would you please raise us up together in
[57:40] Heavenly places
[57:42] and father speak to our hearts is only
[57:45] you can and would you impart to each of
[57:49] us Lord that measure of Revelation that
[57:53] you've ordained for the service tonight
[57:56] that Lord we be not just hearers but
[57:59] also doers of your word we commit the
[58:04] remainder of the service into thine
[58:06] hands and that to your glory in the
[58:09] lovely name of Jesus Christ God's people
[58:12] said amen you may be seated tonight
[58:15] thank you
[58:17] so much
[58:19] for your patience now
[58:24] in getting started this evening
[58:27] and I'd like to take you just a moment
[58:29] here and
[58:31] point something out as it pertains to
[58:36] the title of the two messages that we
[58:39] were mentioning a moment ago the one you
[58:42] must be born again which we know is
[58:45] Jesus's first Doctrine is you must be
[58:49] born again because of the Fallen birth
[58:53] that we come into the world with the
[58:55] Bible says conceived in sin shaped in
[58:58] iniquity come the world speaking lies
[59:01] that God requires a new birth
[59:05] and so
[59:07] we know that brother banham said over
[59:09] and over
[59:10] he said that
[59:13] if you are not born again you're lost
[59:18] so in order to make the Kingdom of
[59:20] Heaven to see the kingdom of heaven we
[59:23] must be born again
[59:26] and so what I'd like to
[59:29] point out as the Lord would help us is
[59:33] in this title that he preached late 61
[59:37] you must be born again and then January
[59:39] of 65 he entitles his message birth
[59:43] pains and what's so striking to me in
[59:47] this message is that brother branham's
[59:50] Focus
[59:52] is not so much
[59:55] the born part
[59:58] as it is on what it takes to get there
[1:00:04] because the two words birth and born are
[1:00:09] two completely different meanings
[1:00:12] so I want to take that tonight and
[1:00:14] getting started here this is out of the
[1:00:16] Webster dictionary but
[1:00:19] the word birth
[1:00:22] in its meaning
[1:00:24] is the act
[1:00:27] of coming in to life
[1:00:31] it means the ACT
[1:00:33] of bringing forth
[1:00:36] so brother sister we all know it's
[1:00:39] required to be born again
[1:00:41] and every single one of us here tonight
[1:00:43] certainly
[1:00:44] if we're not recipients of this are
[1:00:47] seeking this
[1:00:51] brother Benham said the theme of every
[1:00:53] Apostles message was have you received
[1:00:57] the Holy Ghost since you believed
[1:01:00] and so
[1:01:02] this birth means the act of bringing
[1:01:06] forth
[1:01:08] and born means brought forth
[1:01:13] so the born is a result of the birth
[1:01:19] so brother sister if we're truly
[1:01:22] Desiring and seeking this experience and
[1:01:26] and I've got something here tonight
[1:01:29] if you've been born again already
[1:01:32] I'm going to say it this way you're not
[1:01:35] finished yet
[1:01:38] brother Madam on the tape said that's
[1:01:40] where you Pentecostals made your mistake
[1:01:43] he said you were born in the family by
[1:01:47] the genuine Holy Ghost but you failed to
[1:01:51] continue with the tutor
[1:01:53] and become an heir
[1:01:56] so you see brother sister a Christian
[1:01:58] walk isn't just one birth
[1:02:02] if you've ever heard the tape or studied
[1:02:04] the message blasphemius names and
[1:02:08] brother it's one of the keynote uh
[1:02:10] messages for me he preached this the
[1:02:13] month following the statures of a
[1:02:16] perfect man and I want to read this to
[1:02:19] you this boy you talk about you know
[1:02:21] there's times in your listening to the
[1:02:24] message or studying and we recognize
[1:02:26] that
[1:02:27] God knows what he's doing with each of
[1:02:30] us as individuals he knows how to unfold
[1:02:33] spiritual food in due season
[1:02:36] you can hear it take 50 times
[1:02:39] and on that 51st time a statement will
[1:02:43] stand out that you never even remembered
[1:02:46] was there
[1:02:47] [Music]
[1:02:49] but when I came across this many many
[1:02:51] years ago oh let me read it to you
[1:02:55] brother Benham says how do you get in
[1:02:57] the church this is Page 39. born how do
[1:03:01] you get into the church born
[1:03:04] by what the Breath of God he says
[1:03:07] Breathe on Me Breathe on Me Spirit of
[1:03:09] living God breathe on me that's my
[1:03:11] prayer just let the Holy Spirit breathe
[1:03:14] oh my for the Breath of God what is it
[1:03:16] sealed away in the kingdom of God
[1:03:18] knowing that when I first confessed I
[1:03:20] believe Jesus Christ yea he says then to
[1:03:24] my faith at virtue see the Blasphemous
[1:03:27] names brother banham picks up on the
[1:03:30] lesson of statures of a perfect man and
[1:03:33] I believe just puts a few finishing
[1:03:35] touches to that lesson of course we know
[1:03:38] that there's an illustration that goes
[1:03:40] with it and God dealt with the church
[1:03:42] ages dispensationally the same way that
[1:03:45] he deals with the individual now here he
[1:03:48] says that's my prayer he says then add
[1:03:51] to my faith I add virtue Godly virtue
[1:03:54] then to my virtue I add knowledge of the
[1:03:57] word to my knowledge I had Temperance
[1:03:59] self-control he goes on to say tested
[1:04:03] don't you worry 3 Satan will try them
[1:04:07] for you
[1:04:09] just want to encourage you tonight that
[1:04:12] after this lesson
[1:04:14] Satan is just waiting there as a tool in
[1:04:16] God's hand to test you and brother if
[1:04:20] we'll be honest with ourselves and God
[1:04:22] brother through these messages you can
[1:04:25] know exactly where you're standing in
[1:04:29] your journey and growth in Christ
[1:04:33] you know I have found as I've gotten
[1:04:37] older and I am officially old
[1:04:39] I have a Medicare card when you get that
[1:04:42] in the mail just face the facts
[1:04:46] you are old
[1:04:49] but brother sister the prophet of God in
[1:04:51] his 50s on the tape
[1:04:53] he talked about Satan's crown
[1:04:59] he said I do not want Satan's Crown in
[1:05:03] my life
[1:05:04] I do not want to become a grumpy grouchy
[1:05:08] bitter old man but I want to be crowned
[1:05:12] with the fruits of the spirit
[1:05:15] brother Madam said life dishes out its
[1:05:18] disappointments
[1:05:19] he says you have to learn to let them go
[1:05:23] the Bible says let not the sun go down
[1:05:25] upon your Wrath
[1:05:27] so you see brother sister as we get
[1:05:30] older
[1:05:34] you might think you know what
[1:05:38] I'm fellowshipping with the same group
[1:05:41] of people that I have fellowshipped with
[1:05:43] for years but for some reason they're
[1:05:46] all getting more aggravating
[1:05:48] [Music]
[1:05:51] yes
[1:05:54] I've not changed but everybody else is
[1:05:58] just getting more aggravating
[1:06:00] now when you feel that way do yourself a
[1:06:03] favor walk into the bathroom and look in
[1:06:05] the mirror
[1:06:06] because the problem's not with the folks
[1:06:11] brother banham said we are our worst
[1:06:13] enemy
[1:06:16] so brother sister the prophet of God
[1:06:18] said thus saith the Lord You Have To
[1:06:21] Change
[1:06:24] brother you're not going to be an
[1:06:25] adopted son and daughter of God if
[1:06:28] you're not changing
[1:06:29] because it's line upon line line upon
[1:06:32] line here a little there little precept
[1:06:36] precept brother when you finally die out
[1:06:39] enough to get born again now you enjoy
[1:06:43] that experience
[1:06:45] but I'm letting you in on a secret
[1:06:48] you're in for it
[1:06:50] you ain't your brother you just you're
[1:06:53] just starting brother Madam said from
[1:06:55] there you grow up yes you don't get born
[1:06:59] an adult
[1:07:00] you're not born again a matured
[1:07:03] Christian
[1:07:04] there's things that must be added
[1:07:10] now brother look you might hear these
[1:07:13] things I know how I have and you think
[1:07:15] oh Lord
[1:07:17] how
[1:07:18] am I ever gonna get there well brother
[1:07:20] he required it and if God requires it he
[1:07:24] makes a way for us to obtain it
[1:07:27] now if you try to do it all
[1:07:30] I'm telling you right now it ain't gonna
[1:07:32] work
[1:07:33] but see that's why brother sister a
[1:07:35] Christian walk is a walk of self-denial
[1:07:38] Paul said I Die daily
[1:07:41] I know yeah so here look what he says
[1:07:45] tested don't you worry Satan will try
[1:07:48] them for you I'm climbing up the ladder
[1:07:51] now see I've added virtue knowledge
[1:07:54] Temperance now I've got to add patience
[1:07:56] I still ain't got the Holy Ghost
[1:08:00] brother when I read said what
[1:08:03] I got this far
[1:08:05] and I ain't got the Holy Ghost but
[1:08:07] mother look you've got to keep these
[1:08:09] statements within the context that
[1:08:11] they're being made brother Madam is not
[1:08:13] referring to the birth here he's
[1:08:15] referring to the seal to the adoption
[1:08:21] so you see you brother you've got to
[1:08:24] rightly divide these things the way they
[1:08:26] were divided for us
[1:08:28] so you see brother it doesn't mean that
[1:08:32] you weren't born again because look okay
[1:08:34] watch let me read it watch
[1:08:37] he says I still ain't got the Holy Ghost
[1:08:38] then after I add patience I add
[1:08:41] godliness you know what that is like God
[1:08:43] I add that don't miss don't misbehave
[1:08:46] myself go like a Christian gentleman
[1:08:48] ought to
[1:08:49] let that not be a put on but something
[1:08:52] in me
[1:08:54] you've already got brother sister the
[1:08:56] nature of a lamb through that new birth
[1:08:58] experience now the dove can lead you
[1:09:03] so brother sister you ain't adding
[1:09:05] nothing without the Holy Ghost adding it
[1:09:08] otherwise you're just a crow trying to
[1:09:10] stick some dove feathers in there okay
[1:09:12] watch
[1:09:14] he says
[1:09:15] oh go like a Christmas gentleman ought
[1:09:18] to not be a put on something in me the
[1:09:20] love of God just boiling boy I could do
[1:09:24] it but maybe I better not uh uh he says
[1:09:29] uh
[1:09:30] you got to go beyond that
[1:09:32] brother it's got to be something as
[1:09:34] brother man put it in statures of a
[1:09:35] perfect man from the sweetness of your
[1:09:39] heart
[1:09:39] forgiving every man now watch watch
[1:09:44] he says
[1:09:46] it's there anyhow he says it's a birth
[1:09:48] now look what he says next
[1:09:51] I've been birthed into this into this
[1:09:54] into this into this into this seven
[1:09:57] times he States it I've been birthed
[1:10:00] into this into this into this so you see
[1:10:03] brother sister our growth in Christ is
[1:10:05] dependent upon a birth
[1:10:08] and you can't have a birth without a
[1:10:10] death
[1:10:13] right and president that's the hard part
[1:10:15] brother even though we come into a
[1:10:17] wonderful service and under the
[1:10:19] anointing of God brother it's not enough
[1:10:22] because you're made of three Realms
[1:10:24] you've got a body of spirit and a soul
[1:10:28] you can come into a wonderful Holy Ghost
[1:10:30] meeting you might even shout and have a
[1:10:33] time and you leave no different
[1:10:36] it's going to drop deeper than just the
[1:10:38] flesh deeper than the spirit down into
[1:10:41] the soul brother Benham called it a
[1:10:44] birth of the word
[1:10:46] he said if you truly have that you will
[1:10:49] punctuate every word of God with an amen
[1:10:53] you might not understand it all I don't
[1:10:55] understand it all but I believe every
[1:10:58] word
[1:11:00] Jesus told those men on the road oh
[1:11:03] fools and slow of heart
[1:11:05] to believe some
[1:11:08] all that the prophets have spoken so you
[1:11:13] see brother sister
[1:11:14] the birth of the word is what we're
[1:11:16] looking for because look the prophet of
[1:11:18] God said your birth is not your
[1:11:21] conception brother a birth just produces
[1:11:24] what was sown
[1:11:27] let every seed bring out brother banham
[1:11:30] in the you must be born again he says
[1:11:33] false teachers produce false births
[1:11:38] a birth's a birth
[1:11:40] but brother you've got to be sure that
[1:11:42] the seeds you've sown that your birth is
[1:11:45] based on the word Jesus asked Peter who
[1:11:49] the men say I the son of man in Peter he
[1:11:52] said upon this Revelation I'll build my
[1:11:54] church
[1:11:59] so here
[1:12:01] he points this out he says
[1:12:05] into this into this and then the love of
[1:12:08] God Christ comes down and seals all that
[1:12:10] up in me for service then what does he
[1:12:13] do when he gives me the Holy Ghost he
[1:12:16] sets you out in a separate place to
[1:12:18] yourself marks you a different person
[1:12:22] he says the wedding garment's been put
[1:12:25] on you he says then when we have met
[1:12:29] these qualifications and become full of
[1:12:33] the virtues of God and the things of God
[1:12:36] then the Holy Spirit comes down and
[1:12:38] seals us into the kingdom
[1:12:41] don't you worry everybody will know you
[1:12:44] got it
[1:12:45] you won't have to say well glory to God
[1:12:47] I know I got it
[1:12:49] I spoke in tongues you don't have to say
[1:12:52] a word
[1:12:54] glory to God I danced in the spirit
[1:12:58] once he says you don't have to say a
[1:13:00] word about it everybody will know you
[1:13:02] got it don't you worry it'll testify for
[1:13:05] itself he'll let it be known among men
[1:13:09] so you see brother sister we just have
[1:13:12] to be willing to surrender and give it
[1:13:14] to the Lord now in in let me get back
[1:13:18] here to my definitions
[1:13:21] now I read here in John 16 in text and
[1:13:26] the Bible uses these words Lament
[1:13:30] anguish travail
[1:13:33] and I want to take these definitions
[1:13:38] the word Lament
[1:13:40] it means to mourn
[1:13:43] to grieve
[1:13:45] to weep or wail
[1:13:49] so you see brother there's no such thing
[1:13:51] as a dry eye dying out
[1:13:56] you're not going to get this by shaking
[1:13:58] the preacher's hand
[1:14:01] it's going to take some dying
[1:14:05] and that's the part we don't like
[1:14:10] to mourn to grieve to weep or wail to
[1:14:15] express sorrow to regret deeply
[1:14:20] anguish extreme pain
[1:14:24] look at the title birth pains
[1:14:27] our dear mother is in the building
[1:14:29] tonight
[1:14:31] Little Junior that brought so much joy
[1:14:35] to your home
[1:14:39] came with pain
[1:14:42] you know what's amazing about that
[1:14:44] process
[1:14:45] it's not a 10-minute deal
[1:14:48] it's more than 15 minutes at the altar
[1:14:52] all right
[1:14:55] and brother when them contractions come
[1:14:57] think about what that dear Mother to be
[1:15:00] goes through
[1:15:01] sick in her body
[1:15:03] all kinds of symptoms and sorrow that
[1:15:07] goes along with it and us guys
[1:15:11] I remember when my little son this he'll
[1:15:14] be 42 this year and my dear wife sister
[1:15:18] Tina she now personally for me now I'm
[1:15:21] old but I'm I'm really I am old school
[1:15:24] because I thought that it would have
[1:15:26] been ideal for me to be back like in the
[1:15:28] father's knows best ERA and be able to
[1:15:31] wait in a little room with the other
[1:15:33] dads until they Wheel junior in he's all
[1:15:36] cleaned up wrapped up a beanie on him
[1:15:38] he's got his name marked on the little
[1:15:40] bassinet and they put him in the room
[1:15:42] with a window and I could say oh that's
[1:15:44] mine
[1:15:46] but sister Willard had a different idea
[1:15:48] on that she said no you're partially
[1:15:51] responsible you're coming with me
[1:15:54] so we took them classes I don't know if
[1:15:57] they still have them or not but they
[1:15:59] teach you how to breathe they figure it
[1:16:01] out on improved way to make the birth
[1:16:04] easy and they show their little films
[1:16:06] they teach you how to breathe my wife
[1:16:08] and I we were breathing machines I could
[1:16:12] have taught the class I was such a good
[1:16:14] breather
[1:16:19] but when them contractions come
[1:16:22] and brother that little sweet little
[1:16:25] thing you married she lets you know them
[1:16:28] Pains start
[1:16:30] and so we get to the hospital and you
[1:16:32] know what's I love about the hospital
[1:16:34] they have a special Ward for births
[1:16:38] return they don't send you just anywhere
[1:16:40] and brother I feel like the church ought
[1:16:42] to be that
[1:16:43] this ought to be a birthing room
[1:16:46] it's ought to be a Maternity Ward we
[1:16:49] ought to be trained you might have got
[1:16:51] the Holy Ghost 40 years ago but brother
[1:16:54] we've got a sacred charge and that's to
[1:16:57] come to the house of God With a Purpose
[1:17:00] on purpose and that's to do everything
[1:17:03] we can to create an atmosphere that our
[1:17:06] children a sinner folk can come through
[1:17:09] and get the same experience you've got
[1:17:12] [Applause]
[1:17:13] [Music]
[1:17:18] yes sir
[1:17:20] you go in there I remember we went in
[1:17:25] and of course after the first little one
[1:17:29] you know the program but when you're in
[1:17:31] there for the first time
[1:17:33] and you walk in and all you hear from
[1:17:36] down the corridor is a blood curdling
[1:17:39] scream they did not show that on the
[1:17:42] film
[1:17:44] because that's a real birth
[1:17:47] if it's in a hospital or a pink Decker
[1:17:49] or a barnyard it's a mess
[1:17:52] brother if you search this message the
[1:17:56] 1200 or so messages we have you will
[1:17:59] find the number one word that brother
[1:18:01] Benham used to describe the new birth
[1:18:04] was the word mess look the word up it
[1:18:07] means out of order it means disorderly
[1:18:11] Wonder we're called the message
[1:18:13] the message
[1:18:15] whether it's not how long you've been in
[1:18:17] the message how long's it been in you
[1:18:21] it only gets in there by a new birth
[1:18:33] English extreme pain
[1:18:36] you know what's amazing about the birth
[1:18:38] process
[1:18:40] is the pains don't get easier
[1:18:44] they get more intense
[1:18:47] and the contractions get longer not
[1:18:51] shorter you know the prophet of God said
[1:18:53] about the New Birth he said we want a
[1:18:55] classic he classical way we'll go where
[1:18:58] they don't shout and boohoo and pound on
[1:19:00] an altar you want to be too human
[1:19:04] that's what he said
[1:19:07] he says you're not willing to skip a few
[1:19:09] meals
[1:19:11] oh there's always some when I make that
[1:19:13] statement a few of you Brothers eyes get
[1:19:15] big especially at home
[1:19:18] skip a few meals huh
[1:19:21] what's that
[1:19:23] well how bad do you want it yes
[1:19:25] [Applause]
[1:19:28] it means eternity
[1:19:31] joining Church ain't gonna get you there
[1:19:34] shaking the preacher's hand ain't gonna
[1:19:36] get you there
[1:19:39] you know what the prophet of God said he
[1:19:41] said we've gotten to a place where we're
[1:19:43] just concerned about getting people to
[1:19:45] our church
[1:19:46] instead of to Christ
[1:19:48] now brother if they can get to Christ in
[1:19:51] your church wonderful but that's the
[1:19:53] main thing is to get to Christ
[1:19:57] you know what brother banham said it
[1:19:59] matters who teaches you he put picking
[1:20:01] the church you attend on the same
[1:20:03] parallel as your spouse
[1:20:06] he said there's something to it he said
[1:20:08] not what's sociable but true Bible
[1:20:12] teaching
[1:20:15] I feel like I'm preaching to the right
[1:20:17] crowd
[1:20:22] but brother those pains get worse
[1:20:27] not easier
[1:20:29] he says we ain't willing to skip a few
[1:20:31] meals
[1:20:34] he said we're
[1:20:36] we won't stay
[1:20:38] at the altar more than 10 or 15 minutes
[1:20:42] well brother sister how bad do we want
[1:20:44] it
[1:20:45] it should be our Focus
[1:20:49] here recently at home I did a little uh
[1:20:53] opportunity and a little questions and
[1:20:55] answers for the teenage group
[1:20:58] and one of the most amazing questions
[1:21:01] and I'm not making light of any question
[1:21:04] I'm not making fun of the question but
[1:21:07] one of the questions I got was
[1:21:10] many of us are worried
[1:21:13] about
[1:21:14] whether we've been born again
[1:21:17] well brother sister first of all I don't
[1:21:20] believe in worry
[1:21:22] because brother it's based on fear
[1:21:26] now to be concerned yes we should be
[1:21:30] but brother
[1:21:33] what are we doing about it
[1:21:36] if you're concerned or worried about the
[1:21:38] Holy Ghost what are you doing about
[1:21:40] getting it I just read the definition of
[1:21:42] birth is the act
[1:21:45] of bringing forth
[1:21:47] we're to show Meats of repentance
[1:21:49] we should be doing what the prophet of
[1:21:51] God brother just sometime punch in the
[1:21:55] Holy Ghost and the word altar and see
[1:21:57] how many times they're used in
[1:21:59] conjunction even in the tent Vision
[1:22:01] which is a future event brother Branham
[1:22:04] has just made an altar call all right
[1:22:07] and there's still a prayer line
[1:22:16] anguish extreme pain listen to this now
[1:22:19] agony
[1:22:21] to distress with extreme pain
[1:22:26] deeply distressed see brother sister we
[1:22:30] don't want that
[1:22:32] but God's got a provided way
[1:22:35] and brother you've got to come his way
[1:22:38] we want everything instant everything
[1:22:40] easy
[1:22:42] that don't come that way brother bam
[1:22:44] says we want shortcuts there is no
[1:22:47] shortcut to the new birth
[1:22:49] you've got to meet God's requirement for
[1:22:52] it
[1:22:54] travail okay to labor with pain severe
[1:23:00] toil
[1:23:01] toil
[1:23:03] to strive
[1:23:04] to strain
[1:23:06] prepare to work with efforts of some
[1:23:11] duration
[1:23:14] I've been told over the years well I
[1:23:16] went to The Altar and I didn't get
[1:23:19] anything
[1:23:21] so
[1:23:24] go back
[1:23:29] you can't make God's word lie
[1:23:32] brother Madam said God obligates himself
[1:23:35] to his word he said if he failed to
[1:23:39] bring his word to pass he'd have to stop
[1:23:41] being God
[1:23:43] and that's not possible
[1:23:51] God obligates he's obligated brother man
[1:23:54] said that he said brother we've got a
[1:23:56] promise of the Holy Ghost we've got
[1:23:58] brother your Bible says that as the
[1:24:01] bride of Christ we've been predestinated
[1:24:05] now I love this because you know God
[1:24:07] just took it all the way to the finish
[1:24:08] so that you and I wouldn't have to worry
[1:24:10] about it he didn't say you were
[1:24:12] predestinated to a birth or a Sanctified
[1:24:14] life he said you were predestinated to
[1:24:17] your adoption that's the finished work
[1:24:20] so brother you're predestinated to it
[1:24:23] now we just have to catch up to what
[1:24:26] we've been predestinated to
[1:24:28] you've got to act out what God foresaw
[1:24:31] you would do with the word the putting
[1:24:34] your name in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:24:37] brother I believe it's an hour that we
[1:24:38] should be getting busy with God's
[1:24:41] Redemptive plan
[1:24:43] not just say God sent a prophet and go
[1:24:46] to church
[1:24:47] way more than that to a Christian walk
[1:24:55] with efforts of some duration
[1:24:58] to strive
[1:25:02] to make efforts
[1:25:10] make efforts
[1:25:12] really brother sister if you're seeking
[1:25:15] the Holy Ghost and I love the fact that
[1:25:18] brother Israel has an old-fashioned
[1:25:20] altar bench he's not managed to put that
[1:25:23] in the basement
[1:25:25] brother this thing wasn't designed for
[1:25:27] flowers that was Cain's offering it was
[1:25:30] designed for us
[1:25:32] we're supposed to be the offering we're
[1:25:35] the sacrifice
[1:25:37] [Applause]
[1:25:40] I see a Kleenex box
[1:25:45] brother Benham talked about let me read
[1:25:47] it to you watch watch
[1:25:49] okay now this is late 65 if there's
[1:25:53] anybody hung up on something said before
[1:25:56] 63.
[1:25:57] now I'm not
[1:25:59] it doesn't matter my Prophet prophet's
[1:26:02] quote book was written two thousand
[1:26:04] years before 63.
[1:26:06] [Applause]
[1:26:08] and this is God's absolute unadulterated
[1:26:10] word of God
[1:26:11] [Applause]
[1:26:13] just cleared that up
[1:26:17] so this is late 65.
[1:26:19] invisible Union of the bride of Christ
[1:26:22] brother Madam says and if a woman won't
[1:26:25] have a baby for her husband she'll take
[1:26:28] a dog or a cat or something she's got
[1:26:30] the mother something it's nature but to
[1:26:33] Bear a child for her husband raise it to
[1:26:35] the service of God it's entirely out of
[1:26:37] her line oh she'd be so disgraced if she
[1:26:40] did by her sin love and Society of the
[1:26:43] 1965 type of woman rather look at it's
[1:26:46] almost 60 years later look at the
[1:26:48] conditions today

[1:27:46] why such a child would immediately put
[1:27:48] her out of her denomination sure will
[1:27:50] right amongst us brother if you want to
[1:27:53] see the Judas is scary Spirit that's
[1:27:55] living right amongst us preach an
[1:27:57] old-fashioned sin killing sky blue
[1:27:59] Pentecostal blessing experience and
[1:28:02] watch old Judas show his color
[1:28:07] [Music]
[1:28:13] I got permission to go ahead God bless
[1:28:16] you
[1:28:18] I would have anyway
[1:28:20] because it's too late for me yeah
[1:28:25] I've had it both ways I like it beggar
[1:28:27] like this
[1:28:28] yes sir just pray for me
[1:28:34] look
[1:28:37] she don't want any of them hoop and
[1:28:39] crying screaming amen hallelujah why
[1:28:42] such a child would have put her
[1:28:43] immediately out of her denomination if
[1:28:45] they had one like that in one of the
[1:28:47] churches why'd they'd throw her outright
[1:28:49] quick why are you letting such as this
[1:28:53] go along
[1:28:55] oh yes brother
[1:28:57] he says so you see she's pregnant with
[1:29:01] something because she's bringing forth
[1:29:03] members all the time but she don't want
[1:29:06] none of them screaming hollering
[1:29:08] blabbering Acts 2 38 miserable creatures
[1:29:11] that she thinks they are it would
[1:29:13] certainly embarrass her it would ruin
[1:29:16] her her educated ethical scientific
[1:29:18] Society Church that she belongs to here
[1:29:21] they would throw her out at the next
[1:29:23] Council she can't have it so she don't
[1:29:26] want to be pregnated with the word
[1:29:32] brother I want to be pregnanted with the
[1:29:35] unadulterated word
[1:29:37] look
[1:29:44] because that's the only kind that the
[1:29:46] word can bring forth
[1:29:51] Amen brother ain't no wither room in
[1:29:53] this
[1:29:54] now brother sister look
[1:29:56] I've been in this way a long time like
[1:29:58] many of you have
[1:30:00] and I know what brother Benham said that
[1:30:02] we're Beyond Pentecost
[1:30:05] I know the quotes the word that fell at
[1:30:07] Pentecost won't work today that's right
[1:30:10] well brother sister look
[1:30:13] he said we're in the bride age we've
[1:30:16] come out of laodicea yes we have
[1:30:20] and brother sister certainly we've got
[1:30:22] way more word than what they had at
[1:30:25] Azusa
[1:30:28] way more
[1:30:30] but brother sister were never Beyond The
[1:30:32] Experience brother we're 400 years
[1:30:35] Beyond Luther's age
[1:30:37] but brother what Luther preached is just
[1:30:40] as true today that the just shall live
[1:30:42] by faith as it was 400 years ago we
[1:30:45] still believe in justification we still
[1:30:48] believe in the truth of the age that
[1:30:50] Luther preached it in we're Beyond it
[1:30:53] but we believe it if you didn't believe
[1:30:55] in justification none of you would be
[1:30:57] saved thank you
[1:30:58] [Music]
[1:31:00] and the next dispensation under Wesley
[1:31:03] was sanctification I trust we still
[1:31:06] believe in that
[1:31:07] he taught without Holiness you'll not
[1:31:09] see God
[1:31:11] don't fill an unclean vessel you
[1:31:14] remember brother Branham brought what
[1:31:16] completes a birth there's three things
[1:31:18] one is justification second
[1:31:21] sanctification third is the life the
[1:31:23] birth the Holy Ghost he took the analogy
[1:31:26] you find a glass in your yard and it's
[1:31:29] dirty yet it's a good glass you paid for
[1:31:32] it it still got value it can still be
[1:31:35] used so you pick it up well you don't
[1:31:38] use it in that condition
[1:31:42] it's got to be clean
[1:31:45] that's where sister Willard and I have a
[1:31:47] little difference at home
[1:31:48] I've got a coffee cup
[1:31:50] I'm the one that uses it so I feel like
[1:31:53] I make sure she's not looking I can just
[1:31:56] rinse it out and put it back
[1:32:00] that's not the Gospel According to Saint
[1:32:02] Tina
[1:32:03] no it needs to go in the dishwasher and
[1:32:05] get washed right what's wrong
[1:32:09] well brother God has a provided way he's
[1:32:12] not going to fill over the top of the
[1:32:14] filth of the world that you're living in
[1:32:16] oh that's got to die out
[1:32:22] brother and the Holy Ghost will burn it
[1:32:24] out of you see brother sister look God
[1:32:27] when he sanctifies you he takes the
[1:32:30] desire brother he changes your appetite
[1:32:32] amen that's the problem today we just
[1:32:36] want the benefits of a new birth but
[1:32:39] still dabble out in the world it don't
[1:32:41] work that way brother sister you might
[1:32:44] come in as I said earlier to an
[1:32:45] Old-Fashioned Holy Ghost meeting and
[1:32:47] feel the anointings of God that's
[1:32:49] wonderful
[1:32:51] but brother it's going to go deeper than
[1:32:52] that
[1:32:55] You Gotta Die you know what he said not
[1:32:58] only die he said rot
[1:33:01] like an old potato
[1:33:04] I don't know has anybody ever opened up
[1:33:07] the pantry
[1:33:09] and look down in there and your your
[1:33:11] potatoes have grown tentacles
[1:33:13] have you ever seen that to have one of
[1:33:16] them go rotten
[1:33:18] no my wife ain't never burned in our
[1:33:20] house a rotten potato candle
[1:33:24] that's not part of aromatherapy I might
[1:33:27] smell like an apple pie or something
[1:33:29] but never a rotten potato
[1:33:32] because it stinks
[1:33:34] and brother that's how the world's got
[1:33:36] to get to us if you expect to truly be
[1:33:39] born again you're going to have to die
[1:33:41] out to that old stinking nature
[1:33:45] [Applause]
[1:33:52] okay you thought I was done with this
[1:33:55] quote but I'm not
[1:34:00] he says you've been pregnated with
[1:34:02] something
[1:34:03] because she's bringing forth members of
[1:34:05] all time but they don't want none of
[1:34:06] them screaming hollering blabbering
[1:34:08] brother look at the words he used that
[1:34:11] he tied into a new birth there ain't one
[1:34:13] single word that's classical
[1:34:19] not one of them
[1:34:20] every one of these words is a mess
[1:34:23] but you know you can act this way at a
[1:34:25] ball game
[1:34:27] we're just one of the fans
[1:34:29] isn't it amazing how the Devil Makes the
[1:34:31] ball game Lively and church is dead as a
[1:34:34] doornail
[1:34:36] that's true I'm telling you right now
[1:34:38] shouting didn't begin in a ball game it
[1:34:41] was before the foundations of the world
[1:34:43] sons of God shouted
[1:34:45] [Applause]
[1:34:49] brother if you get happier at a ball
[1:34:51] game you do in the house of God
[1:34:52] something's wrong with your walk
[1:34:55] and brother Benham called them folks
[1:34:57] Unholy rollers it's on the tape if we're
[1:35:00] Holy Rollers them are Unholy
[1:35:04] and brother Jesus did way more than a
[1:35:07] home run yes
[1:35:08] you and me
[1:35:11] brother he he saved our souls
[1:35:15] we're headed to Hell a thousand miles an
[1:35:17] hour
[1:35:18] and he said oh the father hath given me
[1:35:20] will come to me and I'll not lose one of
[1:35:23] them brother he interrupted your life
[1:35:26] who didn't look for him he was looking
[1:35:28] for you
[1:35:30] not you Adam where are you
[1:35:32] [Applause]
[1:35:37] turned you around
[1:35:41] save your sinful soul
[1:35:44] gave you a book full of blessings and an
[1:35:48] eternal life out in front of you
[1:35:50] that's worthy of a praise that's worthy
[1:35:54] of a shock
[1:35:58] three
[1:36:00] years
[1:36:01] [Applause]
[1:36:05] since when do we go by feelings anyhow
[1:36:08] do the battle you'd be in in this late
[1:36:10] hour every devil inhales against this
[1:36:13] teacher
[1:36:15] so he tells us offer unto me the
[1:36:18] sacrifice of praise
[1:36:21] that means you didn't feel like it
[1:36:25] man if you came down the road getting
[1:36:28] here singing and worshiping in your car
[1:36:30] only got one hand maybe you're steering
[1:36:33] with your knee because your hands are in
[1:36:34] the air worshiping God whether it
[1:36:37] wouldn't be no sacrifice
[1:36:38] [Music]
[1:36:41] but it's when you don't feel like it
[1:36:43] it's when the symptoms are raging
[1:36:47] it's when the discouragement had been
[1:36:49] piled on you
[1:36:51] it's when the devil's telling you you
[1:36:53] there ain't no way you're just kidding
[1:36:56] yourself that you think you can be bride
[1:36:59] of Christ
[1:37:02] it's when then
[1:37:05] take God at his word
[1:37:07] amen
[1:37:09] God looks and honors faith
[1:37:12] you don't go by feeling but brother it's
[1:37:15] what's motivating you I'm gonna go to
[1:37:18] church anyway brother man said I don't
[1:37:21] care if you have to hobble
[1:37:23] that's on the tape hobble
[1:37:26] you know brother you've heard the
[1:37:27] message brother Bannon preached digging
[1:37:30] the valley full of ditches he preached
[1:37:32] it right there in Phoenix and he talked
[1:37:34] about you know the story Elisha out of
[1:37:37] sorts sees Jehoshaphat ahab's son son
[1:37:40] and he wouldn't even speak there in the
[1:37:42] presence of ahab's son except for the
[1:37:44] righteous man Jehoshaphat brother Benham
[1:37:46] said his temper got the best of him he
[1:37:48] was out of sorts so he called for
[1:37:51] someone to play he called for timbrel
[1:37:56] and so when he got in the spirit
[1:38:00] he prophesied saw vision and he said dig
[1:38:03] the valley full of ditches
[1:38:06] brem says it wasn't some soft pliable
[1:38:09] soil it was like out here in Phoenix it
[1:38:11] was a dried up old hard pan desert but
[1:38:15] the deeper you dig
[1:38:16] the more water you're going to get
[1:38:19] it's what he said on the tape so brother
[1:38:21] sister there ain't nobody here one of
[1:38:24] the reasons we stayed in school and
[1:38:26] found a different vocation because maybe
[1:38:28] you did dig some ditches nobody really
[1:38:31] says I can't wait for my career path I'm
[1:38:34] going to be an expert ditch digger
[1:38:37] it's hard work it's labor
[1:38:40] it's brutal
[1:38:43] well brother sounds like a process of a
[1:38:46] birth
[1:38:47] the process of dying
[1:38:50] it's a dying process
[1:38:58] and this is what he said on the tape
[1:39:01] he says when you're digging and you run
[1:39:03] into that teapot
[1:39:05] dig it out and then he started giving
[1:39:07] names to the things you run into one of
[1:39:11] them was tiredness
[1:39:14] it's what he said on the tape brother
[1:39:16] really really is there anybody here that
[1:39:19] is not tired I'd like to shake your hand
[1:39:22] after church I'd like to actually know
[1:39:24] someone that isn't tired I wake up tired
[1:39:26] and I go to bed more tired
[1:39:29] tired's a way of life
[1:39:32] I'm up here tonight tired
[1:39:36] I don't feel it right now but I know I
[1:39:38] am
[1:39:44] but you put one foot in front of the
[1:39:47] other and you say I'm gonna offer a
[1:39:49] sacrifice of prayer I'm going to go to
[1:39:51] church and I'm going to pretend I'm not
[1:39:53] tired because I'm going to worship my
[1:39:56] God he's worthy to be worshiped I'm a
[1:39:59] child of his I'm a believer I'm going to
[1:40:02] act like what I'm not gonna sit back
[1:40:04] with my arms folded hoping somebody can
[1:40:06] entertain me I've come to get in the
[1:40:09] spirit
[1:40:10] yes
[1:40:15] [Applause]
[1:40:17] praise the Lord
[1:40:19] okay
[1:40:21] you want me to quit get quiet
[1:40:26] trust me there's only somebody that
[1:40:28] won't be quiet I got a brother at home I
[1:40:30] go to say that he's preach it brother
[1:40:33] take your time I know he gets glared at
[1:40:37] sits in the front so we can't see who's
[1:40:40] doing it
[1:40:44] born look what he says
[1:40:47] born of the spirit of God
[1:40:51] it has the spirit of God in it no
[1:40:54] intellectual Church joined Creed joined
[1:40:57] going bobbed hair painted-faced there's
[1:41:00] no such thing as that in it all of it
[1:41:02] you don't find that in the word of God
[1:41:04] you find an old-fashioned Sanctified
[1:41:06] holy ghost-filled child born of the
[1:41:09] spirit of God screaming hollering
[1:41:11] shouting praising God
[1:41:13] [Applause]
[1:41:14] praise God
[1:41:16] [Applause]
[1:41:19] I never forget a brother I preached for
[1:41:22] in Africa years ago
[1:41:25] he was in some meetings I want to say
[1:41:28] there were some folks from North America
[1:41:31] in the meetings
[1:41:32] and one of the dear brothers in the
[1:41:35] message
[1:41:36] over there in Africa told the brother
[1:41:38] who was African he said now the reason
[1:41:41] you folks act the way you do
[1:41:43] is because it's your culture
[1:41:46] and the dear Pastor said I beg to differ
[1:41:49] with you
[1:41:51] because I've been to I've seen one of
[1:41:52] your Super Bowls yeah

[1:42:08] the great big old bellies they don't
[1:42:10] even care that they're showing them
[1:42:12] things
[1:42:15] because they're a football fan
[1:42:17] they're supporting the team and all that

[1:44:21] with a new birth you can leave this
[1:44:23] meeting adding a virtue
[1:44:25] because you're birthed into each one of
[1:44:27] them
[1:44:28] brother there's not one of us here that
[1:44:30] doesn't need more of God The Man Behind
[1:44:33] the pulpit tonight needs more of God
[1:44:40] maybe you've got the Holy Ghost years
[1:44:41] ago but how's your lamp doing you know
[1:44:45] the prophet of God said late in his
[1:44:46] ministry it's lamp Trim in time
[1:44:49] even the wise virgin fell asleep in
[1:44:51] Matthew 25 and was woken up because the
[1:44:54] bridegroomed Terry they fell asleep too
[1:44:56] but at midnight there was a cry and even
[1:44:59] though she had extra oil even though she
[1:45:02] had the oil to stay topped off but
[1:45:04] brother sister she still had to trim her
[1:45:06] lamp a wick trimming time cleaning the
[1:45:10] globe
[1:45:12] getting ready for the coming of the Lord
[1:45:15] brother how many could use a refilling

[1:45:18] maybe your clamps gotten a little low
[1:45:21] you could use a refill he's here tonight
[1:45:26] okay I'm I know I'm in amongst the right
[1:45:29] crowd tonight
[1:45:32] praise God
[1:45:35] brother let's quit making excuses and
[1:45:38] just take God at his word
[1:45:43] okay
[1:45:47] oh my
[1:45:50] let me
[1:45:52] I want to take this here
[1:45:56] brother Branham in the Patmos vision
[1:45:59] this is off the tape
[1:46:04] he's referring to Revelations chapter 1
[1:46:06] verse 10 how that I John was in the
[1:46:09] spirit on the Lord's Day
[1:46:11] and brother Madam said John was a type
[1:46:12] and the vision of the Bride of Jesus
[1:46:14] Christ he was a type of you and I he
[1:46:17] said for on Patmos in Vision God
[1:46:19] transmitted him through time as though
[1:46:21] he lived in our day
[1:46:26] and John says I was in the spirit
[1:46:31] brother Bannon Bears down on that I'm on
[1:46:33] page 96. he says all right now in the
[1:46:36] spirit on the Lord's Day
[1:46:38] now remember the first thing you have to
[1:46:40] do is what get in the spirit
[1:46:45] man that's the first thing you come to
[1:46:48] the house of God the very first brother
[1:46:50] why do you think God ordained worship
[1:46:52] prior to the preaching of the word it
[1:46:55] was to create an atmosphere
[1:46:58] for the word
[1:47:02] it's not just a ritual there's a purpose
[1:47:05] behind it brother years ago back in the
[1:47:07] mid 80s thereabouts I come across an
[1:47:10] article I think it was at my
[1:47:11] father-in-law's house and he hadn't
[1:47:14] stack or had some National Geographics
[1:47:16] and one of the articles in the
[1:47:18] geographic magazine was entitled the
[1:47:20] wars Within
[1:47:22] and it was an extensive study on the
[1:47:25] immune system
[1:47:26] and as I began to read through it right
[1:47:28] away it caught my attention
[1:47:31] because it speaks of five cells
[1:47:35] that work
[1:47:37] in the immune system to keep your body
[1:47:40] alive
[1:47:42] to kill and drive out sickness that
[1:47:44] comes in
[1:47:45] because 24 7 your entire life there's
[1:47:48] all kinds of germs and bacterias viruses
[1:47:52] diseases trying to kill you
[1:47:55] so God equipped us with this a cellular
[1:48:00] response system to Keep Us Alive it's
[1:48:04] called the T cells
[1:48:07] okay I don't have time that's a whole
[1:48:10] different but brother sister
[1:48:13] every one of us here has dealt with
[1:48:16] symptoms
[1:48:17] otherwise Christ didn't need to be a
[1:48:19] Healer
[1:48:21] Remnant says Divine Healing was the bait
[1:48:23] on the hook to get folks hooked to the
[1:48:26] Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:48:28] so brother sister if if we didn't have
[1:48:30] symptoms how could we be Overcomers
[1:48:34] Birmingham said don't sign for that box
[1:48:37] of snakes
[1:48:38] you know what he said on the tape he
[1:48:40] said as long as you are complaining
[1:48:43] about your symptoms God can't heal you
[1:48:49] how are we doing
[1:48:54] sure we get symptoms
[1:48:56] absolutely do
[1:48:58] our prophet got symptoms Jesus got
[1:49:02] symptoms
[1:49:03] [Music]
[1:49:05] that's so that God could display himself
[1:49:07] as a Healer Brandon says don't never let
[1:49:10] your uh testimony your confession be
[1:49:13] negative
[1:49:14] be positive he said don't you never say
[1:49:17] you're not saved he said say you're
[1:49:21] saved and one day you will be
[1:49:24] amen don't ever say that your faith is
[1:49:28] weak
[1:49:29] confess your faith is strong and then
[1:49:33] God will bring your faith to your
[1:49:35] confession
[1:49:37] he's the high priest of what
[1:49:39] our confession
[1:49:45] have you ever met somebody a dear
[1:49:48] brother or sister that you didn't even
[1:49:50] want to ask how they were doing
[1:49:53] because of the track record
[1:49:55] and by the time they get done with you
[1:49:57] know it's amazing how people can detail
[1:49:59] all the symptoms
[1:50:01] brother honestly they could win an
[1:50:03] Academy Award
[1:50:05] and putting such detail to all the
[1:50:08] symptoms and
[1:50:09] by the time they get done with you
[1:50:11] you've got a few
[1:50:13] you didn't even know we're there man you
[1:50:15] know I got that too
[1:50:17] have you ever read one of them articles
[1:50:19] do you have stress you know that's
[1:50:22] backed by some pharmaceutical that wants
[1:50:25] to put you in some mind-altering drug
[1:50:27] that has side effects to give you
[1:50:29] another drug to take care of the side
[1:50:31] effects from The Other Drug
[1:50:33] and I love they show that you know
[1:50:35] brother this age that you and I live in
[1:50:37] I ain't never seen such anxiety in my in
[1:50:40] fact when I grew up I don't think the
[1:50:42] word existed I don't know we just lived
[1:50:46] they got a name for everything
[1:50:51] you know that anxiety is actually one of
[1:50:53] the definitions under the word fear
[1:50:56] fear produces it
[1:51:02] never seen such that's what we got today
[1:51:06] anxieties
[1:51:09] panic attacks
[1:51:11] whether it's gotten to a place well the
[1:51:12] Bible says men's Hearts failing for fear
[1:51:14] but brother sister look all that Death
[1:51:17] Angel all that was going on darkness in
[1:51:20] Egypt but there was light in Goshen
[1:51:22] brother we don't have to drink that
[1:51:25] Kool-Aid
[1:51:28] we take God's word
[1:51:30] we've got a safe place we've got a
[1:51:33] hiding place we've got a Goshen and
[1:51:36] that's God's promised word thank you
[1:51:40] yes thank you Lord amen

[1:52:28] mother the devil didn't Rob David of his
[1:52:31] salvation he just robbed him of the joy
[1:52:34] of it
[1:52:36] we spoke this morning brother Caleb's on
[1:52:38] the first love
[1:52:39] and it says to love you once had for
[1:52:42] them old-fashioned Holy Ghost meetings
[1:52:44] he said you left it it didn't leave you
[1:52:46] we leave it
[1:52:49] he says and you begin to slide
[1:52:51] slip it's just gradual slip into the
[1:52:55] formal
[1:52:57] the Bible brother and brother Bannon
[1:52:59] brought it he says God hated
[1:53:03] the formal d
[1:53:05] of the Nicolaitans he says and so does
[1:53:08] his church hated it now brother God
[1:53:11] doesn't like a lot of things but I don't
[1:53:14] know in serving him I would think it
[1:53:16] would be wisdom to focus on the things
[1:53:18] first that he hates
[1:53:20] okay if we're going to get busy serving
[1:53:22] God let's take a look at what God hates
[1:53:25] let's get those out of the way and then
[1:53:27] we can work on the rest of that he hates
[1:53:29] formal religion he said formal religion
[1:53:33] is no different than Catholicism Look up
[1:53:35] the word formal in the Webster
[1:53:36] dictionary you know what the word means
[1:53:41] stiffly
[1:53:42] the base meaning of formal is stiffly
[1:53:46] stiff stiff it means unbendable
[1:53:49] unyielding
[1:53:53] stubborn
[1:53:55] stiff neck
[1:54:00] bro that means you can't even get a head
[1:54:02] nod out of them
[1:54:04] they're next to sniff to nod their head
[1:54:07] brother what do they call a dead person
[1:54:10] what do they call them
[1:54:12] a stiff why
[1:54:14] they're dead
[1:54:17] there's no life in them
[1:54:19] they're not moving because why they're
[1:54:21] dead
[1:54:23] stiff
[1:54:26] brother I'm gonna let you in on
[1:54:27] something here if the Deacon board back
[1:54:29] here watching you for a two or three
[1:54:31] hour service can replace you next Sunday
[1:54:33] with a mannequin
[1:54:35] you're formal
[1:54:38] there's no wiggle room around it you
[1:54:39] just face the fact I'm formal I need to
[1:54:42] change the way I am because God hates
[1:54:45] formalism
[1:54:46] [Music]
[1:54:48] brother I don't care if I don't feel
[1:54:49] like it or not I'm still going to clap
[1:54:52] I'm gonna Pat my foot I'm gonna offer to
[1:54:55] him the sacrifices of Praise because
[1:54:57] he's worthy of it
[1:54:59] you know what God does to a sacrifice
[1:55:01] that's based on the word of God and its
[1:55:03] efforts he consumes it and then after a
[1:55:07] while you feel like
[1:55:10] brother we just got to take God at his
[1:55:12] word know what we're doing know why we

[1:59:44] sinner okay I'm talking to everybody
[1:59:46] Even If you deny it
[1:59:49] every one of us a sinner born in sin
[1:59:52] Shake come to the word of speaking
[1:59:53] lies every one of us need a new birth
[1:59:55] every one of us need a savior
[1:59:58] sinner okay brother man gives us an
[2:00:00] analogy he says when you was a sinner
[2:00:03] you went to the dance
[2:00:05] you've gotten that spirit I love to see
[2:00:07] oh you press the sister with the fans
[2:00:09] could someone turn one this way
[2:00:12] God bless you
[2:00:14] you're showing yourself a rugged
[2:00:16] Christian
[2:00:18] I was down in Nogales last week
[2:00:21] pulled up the big building for these
[2:00:24] meetings and didn't have no windows and
[2:00:26] the car said 111 as we went in
[2:00:30] I said oh I hope when I get home nobody
[2:00:33] complains the church is too warm brother
[2:00:36] I sweated my tie down to where it was
[2:00:38] Dripping the top of my trousers changed
[2:00:41] colors
[2:00:43] if I just hope trust that the man that
[2:00:45] invented air conditioning makes heaven
[2:00:47] I'm going to look him up and shake his
[2:00:50] hand
[2:00:53] thank the Lord
[2:00:57] when you was a sinner you went to the
[2:00:59] dance and you got a Nets now whenever I
[2:01:01] read this quote there's always somebody
[2:01:02] out there that gets real happy and they
[2:01:05] seem too happy about how then they used
[2:01:07] to act as a sinner
[2:01:10] I always get that you know oh we're
[2:01:12] heading on or a big smile or a little
[2:01:14] chuckle because they remember how they
[2:01:17] acted they probably wore the lampshade
[2:01:22] come to the house of God like a wart on
[2:01:24] a pickle
[2:01:27] okay
[2:01:30] when you was a sinner you went to the
[2:01:32] dance you got in that Spirit you started
[2:01:34] Clapping Your Hands and patting your
[2:01:36] feet and shin digging I love the fact my
[2:01:39] Prophet used the word Shin digging
[2:01:42] that means your shin was digging
[2:01:45] that's a shin dig
[2:01:48] Shin digging you got in the spirit of it
[2:01:51] look what he says
[2:01:53] he says you went to Shin digging throwed
[2:01:56] your hat on the floor going around and
[2:01:58] around acting silly acting silly there
[2:02:00] wasn't one of us that driving to church
[2:02:02] with honey next to us sitting next to
[2:02:04] you and go honey can't wait to get to
[2:02:05] the house of God so we can act silly
[2:02:09] but it'll make you do things you didn't
[2:02:10] think you'd do I'll tell you one thing
[2:02:13] bro it take the starch out of your
[2:02:15] collar it'll take care of that formal

[2:02:53] system article
[2:02:54] every one of us in battling symptoms
[2:02:57] have had a fever did you know that it's
[2:03:00] not actually the virus that causes the
[2:03:02] fever
[2:03:03] it's the immune response the macrophage
[2:03:06] has a direct connection with the
[2:03:08] intelligence your brain and it notices
[2:03:11] identifies and discerns that there's a
[2:03:13] virus infected the body and the immune
[2:03:16] response those cells cannot respond in a
[2:03:18] normal body temperature
[2:03:20] to an enemy so it tells the brain heat
[2:03:23] up the body
[2:03:26] that's what we do when we come to the
[2:03:28] house of God that's why we worship
[2:03:31] before your killer tea comes out of the
[2:03:33] back room is you're raising the
[2:03:36] temperature in the building the
[2:03:38] spiritual thermometer so that the enemy
[2:03:41] can be cast out
