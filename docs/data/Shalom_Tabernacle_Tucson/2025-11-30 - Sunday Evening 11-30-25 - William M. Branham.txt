On a hill stood [music] an old rugged [singing] cross, the emblem of suffering and shame. And I [singing and music] love that old cross where [singing] the dearest man [music] for [singing] a world of us sinners was [music and singing] slain. And [singing and music] so I'll cherish the old rugged cross till my trophies till my trophies [music] at last [singing] I laid down [music] and I will [singing] cling [music] to the ruging cross [singing] [music] and all stra [singing] and brown.

Oh, I [singing] will cling [music] to the old [singing] brother cross and [music and singing] I'll exchange it someday. Let's sing that third verse as well. And the old rugged cross stained with [music and singing] blood so divine. And the old rugged cross stained with blood [singing] so divine a wonderous beauty I see. For it was [music and singing] on that old cross that Jesus suffered. And I [singing and music] hallelujah to pardon and sanctify [music] the [music] [singing] soul. the old [music] rugged cross [music] until [singing] my bro at last I lay down [music and singing] Hey, boy.

Let's give him a hand of praise. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. God bless each of you. Amen. I just had a note or two before we go to the tape message uh [music] tonight. I wanted to um just share my love and express my love to the saints here and appreciate you. I like this uh setting of the crowd. Uh it's not a large large group of people, just home folks pretty much. God bless you, Sister Hope, and each of you. Welcome. I see brother uh Will's dad there. Welcome the house of the Lord. God bless him. It's always so nice to see him and see each of you. And um the prophet of God takes a scripture in James chapter 5 verse 12 and he reads that out at the beginning [music] of this tape and it's he he'll be laying hands on some sick folks and some ministers and then he goes down and gets into this [music] his message which starts at paragraph number 10. And um what I wanted to do is read James 5:12-16 with you. And if you can turn there, I'll read that for you. And then I'll read a note or two. I'll bring you greetings uh send you greetings from Sister Sharon. I know she would love to be here. I believe she's streaming right now. And so we thank the Lord for her. And also I know the Robsons, we always miss them when they're not here. and many others that are not here, the ones traveling and so forth. Amen. James 5:12. But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by earth, neither by any other oath. Let your yay be yay, and your nay nay, lest you fall into condemnation. Is any among you afflicted, let him pray. Is any marry? Let him sing songs. Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church. Let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith shall save the sick. I love this scripture. I really do. And the Lord shall raise him up. And if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. Confess your faults one to another. Pray one for another that you may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avaleth much. So thank the Lord for that. We appreciate the Lord Jesus. And we it's my desire as always is to uh stand for the word of the Lord. The way I have always approached churches and ministries and other ministries as the early years of me serving the Lord and particularly when I started in the ministry and meeting the different people that I met, I found it was very very important to to know the position of which ministry that I would choose to follow. And that was always been a prerequisite for me. I've always thought I wanted to know what is that brother preaching? Where does he stand? What is his position? And so I and I know that might be a different approach for others and for people, but that's the way it kind of works with me. I like to see the position that a brother takes, that a ministry would take. And um and over the years I always appreciate the position or the ministry or pastors that would play the prophet in their churches. That's a position that is a position that I take. And so I um kind of lean towards pastors and ministers that gives brother Brandham a a place in their pullpit. I um in the in the tape ministry and I'm not criticizing those that don't. I might come across that way or might come out that way back and forth. I know some of the brothers don't criticize us that way that play the tapes. If they choose not to, that's fine. But that's kind of the position that I've uh looked at and those are the ministries that I kind of lean into. Brother Chris are the ones that will have a place for the profit. Um, and I actually view my ministry way, way way, way below brother Brandham's ministry. I do not place my ministry equal to the profit of this age, brother Brandham. And that doesn't mean the Lord doesn't love me or love us the same. He does love us the same. But we have positions in the body of Christ for the purpose of serving the people. And and there is no replacement for the voice that come in this generation. &gt;&gt; So locally there's pastors in every country, city, state, village, hut, whatever. There's pastors, teachers, evangelists, the five-fold ministry. I may or may not ever get to hear all of those brothers because that's not uh a requirement to be a part of the bride. But to be a part of the bride and to make the rapture, you have to hear the voice of the messenger, the Reverend William Brham. That is a position that I take. &gt;&gt; And I don't take that like flexing against somebody else. That's just in in the message, the rapture. Brother Brandham says the shout, the voice, and the trumpet. Jesus does all three. And he said, "What was the shout?" It was the message calling the bride together. &gt;&gt; So if you can't catch the shout, you won't be in the voice or in the trump. You won't be in the resurrection as far as that goes. Now, when it comes to salvation, of course, there's lots of people that receive salvation &gt;&gt; that will never hear per se about the message. At least that's the way I understand it. They've asked Brother Bandom about about that. To be a Christian, you don't have to hear uh this message to be a Christian or hear Brother Band's message to be saved, but to be a part of the bride, I believe that every member of that bride has to hear the voice of of that prophet. &gt;&gt; And so, we're going to do that in just a moment. And so, um I I pay close attention to those things. I I talk to brothers as you get to know them and different ministers that you have come and stand at this pulpit here. I have some that I like more than others, I'd say. And uh but and and that's just the way things go. You like ministers, they fit different people at different times. And so, but I generally will not open my pulpit to someone that's negative towards the message because I just don't see um um that position being consistent with what's God is doing in this age. Okay. So, um we see this example in the message. I'm going to read one quote for you. is in the sardis and church age 1960 where brother Brandham here he is uh he's preaching the church ages I'm going to read paragraph two and paragraph number four he he's preaching the church ages and he's having tape services of his own tapes for the people to come and hear those tapes here's brother Neville he's a pastor here's brother Brandham he's alive preaching and yet he has people listening to his tapes while he's alive as a part of the tape ministry. So, here's a nice example for that. Let me read that for you. And then someone just passed a note, come around and pass a note over about the services tomorrow. You who are visiting us, we sure be glad to have you come down in the afternoon at 2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon. They're going to have tape services. And if you're not doing anything, there will be one of the messages that you've never heard will be played and have prayer meeting and we'll just expect a good time tomorrow afternoon at 2:00. It's going to be a pretty busy time for me because tomorrow, see, I have to pick up Sunday morning and also Sunday night, tomorrow night, too. And all the history on those churches. And now Sunday morning, the Lord willing, we're expecting a great time cuz Sunday morning be off. Drop down to paragraph number four. Uh Sunday night, we'll take up that last great angel, the message to the Leodyian. Sunday night, the Lord willing. And now then tomorrow afternoon is the service here, a tape service. Brother Jean just told me we begin at 2:00 tomorrow afternoon. And you people that like to come and hear the messages have prayer around the altar. You that seek in the Holy Spirit or something wonderful time church is a nice and warm open ready for anybody at any time that wants to come in and pray and seek the Lord. The church is open and waiting and we will be expecting you. Put it like that. Be expecting you tomorrow afternoon. So who was that? So, Brother Brandham had a tape service in his own tabernacle. People coming to pray around the altar and seek the Lord. &gt;&gt; We don't have a problem with playing the tape. I I I actually thank the Lord for it. It's the the greatest ministry and we certainly hope our ministry is lifting that up before you to keep that before the people. Amen. So, God bless you. So, can we add another service on Sunday? [laughter] No, I'm teasing. It's at 2 o'clock. It would be perfect, Brother Ben. Get everybody in here at 2 and then be back here at 5:00. Actually, be here at 4:30 to pray and be ready for Yeah, I'm testing. I'm looking at who's really smiling. Some of y'all are not smiling at all, but it's okay. So, God bless you. God bless you so much. I wanted to read that. Had that on my heart. So let's stand and we'll sing this old hymn of the church only believe. Amen. Only believe [singing and music] only believe that all things are possible. Only believe. [singing and music] Hallelujah. Only [music] believe. Only [singing] believe. [music] All [singing] things are possible. Oh, let's lift our hands. Lord, I believe. Oh, Lord, [music and singing] I believe. Lord, I believe that all things are possible. Lord, [music] I believe. [singing] Lord, [music] I believe. Lord, [music] I believe that all [singing] things are possible. Lord, I believe. Amen. Brother Brandham is taking out of the scripture of Mark chapter 12. Let's remain standing as he reads that portion of the word. God bless you. the 12th chapter. We want to take a portion of this and read it and because it is God's holy unadulterated word and we believe that God is in his word. Do you believe that? And we are praying that God will add his blessings to it as we read it. And I'm sure that he will. And then I want to take another portion of his word out of Acts the first chapter and we shall read from them. And I'm asking the Lord if he will add his blessings to the to the reading of his word. I was just looking here. I had a mark here in my in my Bible that I wanted to read from first, but I don't think I can find it just at the time. Just excuse me for a moment. I can find it. If I can. I thought I had it. Jesus said unto them, have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, if you shall say to this mountain, be moved and do not doubt in your heart, but believe that those things you say will come to pass, you shall have what you say. Now over in Acts the the first chapter and the 8th verse. But ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria and to the utmost parts of the earth. I'd like to draw your attention to the word of of the Lord this morning for just a while. And I want you to pay the utmost attention to it. Listen closely. The value of this word after 25 years of ministry for the Lord in his work and in his word and after this being coming in my 12th year of international evangelism and by the grace of God to meeting tens of thousands of of people and seeing our Lord in our own campaigns when now as I have seen to him right in toward towards 2 million people a million500,000 somewhere along in there in the meetings I've come to this conclusion and of all of our efforts and so forth it's impossible for God to do anything for the people until the people first get settled on whether it's truth or not &gt;&gt; you just can't no matter I have seen great ma masterpieces of our Lord in the the word who could explain the word better than anyone I ever seen and yet could not make the program go over. Now, I have on my mind this morning a certain man that I think has one of the best radio programs on the air, but there's somehow the man can't put his program over. That's Dr. Wine. [clears throat] a real teacher, but there's something wrong. I don't know where it's at. He's got the vision. He's got the idea. He's got the ability, but he just simply can't get the program to move him somehow. The program that he's got strictly on the word, and it should bring the world to their knees. And I seen here not long ago in Louisville when I seen Dr. Mori Ham and many great theologians that I know which is far better preacher than [clears throat] the young 38 or 40 year old redheaded evangelist walked out to the platform passed those men and they took a backseat and stood there that night wasn't one tenth or 100th the preacher that the man was sitting behind him though he had the program of God and put it over Billy Grim. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; I've noticed those things and in noticing them then I come to this conclusion. No matter what you are, God's got to furnish the audience. And no matter if I could stand here this morning and bring the dead to life and to bring the cripples to their normal condition and yet God is not in the program, it would go nowhere. God has to be in the program. And um any man is known uh his character is known by his works. &gt;&gt; No matter who he is, his works prove his character. If you take a man, no matter how good he tries to be, if his works are evil, all his goodness won't amount to nothing. Amen. &gt;&gt; And a man's word is his characteristic. A man that his word is no good, then you'll never have confidence in that man because his word's no good. So therefore, God our father, his character and his works prove what he is. Now we know that this world come here by some great creator. It could not have just happened to be. Now I want this just few moments to be just as simple as possible but I want you to get it in praying that the Holy Spirit will move it right into the light that it belongs in. Now, IF YOU WILL JUST LOOK AND see the trees growing and the limbs and the leaves, how they come and go and the flowers, the spring, the fall, the winter, the summer, something's got to be behind that. There could not be a tree unless there could be an intelligence to make it a tree. No matter what kind of a life would be in it, there has to be behind that an intelligence to make it what it is. Now, think that straight now. Don't let it go over. Think of it deeply. For if you notice our scripture lesson, Jesus said, "If you WILL SAY IN YOUR HEART, not in your intellects, it'll never work there." No matter how much you try to make it work, it won't work. &gt;&gt; Cuz it's intellectual and has an end. But when anything's eternal, it has no end. &gt;&gt; And it had no beginning. &gt;&gt; Anything with an beginning has an end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's just those THINGS WHICH HAS no beginning. AND ONLY GOD HAS NO beginning or no end. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then to have these things that has a beginning, there had to be something WITHOUT A BEGINNING TO START THE BEGINNING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; The first tree that was ever made that like the one that Jesus cursed here said, "No fruit grow on thee from henceforth. No man eth." There had to be somewhere that tree had to have a beginning. AND IT HAD AN ending when the words that for the lips OF THE ONE WHO GAVE IT THE BEGINNING TOOK IT TO THE END. &gt;&gt; So you see how eternal his words are. BUT WE HAVE JUST ACCEPTED the word on the intellectual basis and seen so many total failures TILL IT HAS BROUGHT PEOPLE TO A place that THEY JUST HARDLY KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; They're just got a lot of loose ends to their their religion. &gt;&gt; Amen. They run out ON LIMBS THIS WAY AND limbs that way which comes to the end. And here they come crawling back. Great movement starts and they run out like the Methodists, the Baptists and the Pentecostals and all this and the first thing you know they get a little psychic idea and they run out to the limb and they're having a big time but the first thing you know they find themselves at the end. But the ONLY THINGS THAT EVERLAST IS the eternal things &gt;&gt; and the eternal things are God. Now if you notice a man known by his his character is known by his works. If we WOULD THINK OF HOW GOD SHOWS HIS CHARACTER BY HIS WORKS. He's got his own character and he made his works. And if you look at his works, how great they are. Now, let me challenge every scientist in the world to build me one tree. Let me CHALLENGE EVERY SCIENTIST IN THE WORLD TO make me one little simple spring of grass. AND IT'S TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE. WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE THEN UPON thinking those things that there COULD BE A PLACING by reading the word A FAITH THAT WOULD GO BEYOND the intellectual conceptions into the heart. Jesus said, "If thou shalt say in the heart." Now, we get all frustrated in our minds and we go out and say, "Oh, I've seen that done. Yes, I and once in a while it's a hop, skipping a so forth, but it seems LIKE IT JUST CAN'T GET MOVING right because we try to mix the intellectual with the supernatural. They have no dealings with each other at all. Intellectuals will say one thing AND SUPERNATURAL WILL SAY ANOTHER. And any man that's ever led by the SPIRIT OF GOD DOES NOT TAKE ANY THOUGHT OF ANY INTELLECTUAL, but he's LED FROM HIS HEART by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; He's misunderstood. People say, "OH, HOW COULD IT BE?" Right now, I'm getting letters and phone calls. You mean brother Brandham that you wouldn't be going overseas AFTER ALL THIS GREAT BUT it looks wonderful but something weighed down inside &gt;&gt; said be careful AND THEREFORE WE DON'T LOOK THAT WHAT WE SEE WE LOOK AT THOSE THINGS WE do not see &gt;&gt; but what God says in the heart &gt;&gt; AND IF WE COULD PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE THINGS. HOW MUCH MORE BY divine healing? IF GOD MADE THE PROMISE AND IT ANCHORS in the heart, well, WHAT GOOD DO WE NEED INTELLECTUALS ANYMORE? I don't look at my affliction. I don't look at MY SYMPTOMS. I LOOK AT WHAT God said about it because after all, he is the boss and the supreme boss. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If the doctor said so and so, now if you try to bluff that, it won't work. If you try to reason it in your mind, say, "Yes, God's word's right. I believe that. I believe it will come to pass. I think that." Now, if that's intellectually, you just might as well stop thinking it &gt;&gt; UNTIL SOMETHING COMES down on the inside of you. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT JUST SAYS IT'S SO AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT. &gt;&gt; THERE IS NOT ENOUGH DEMONS out of torment could ever shake it from you. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's something on the inside called the heart. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; There's where real faith finds its resting place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Intellectuals will try to reason about it. Now, let us be reasonable. BUT FAITH HAS NO REASONING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT JUST HAS ONE THING, AND THAT'S GOD'S WORD IS RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, &gt;&gt; THERE'S WHERE THE SOUL SETS IT &gt;&gt; AND [clears throat] REST ETERNALLY RIGHT THERE. FOR GOD said so. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOT A BLUFF, BUT KNOWING IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And the EARTH BEING GOD'S WORK, it absolutely speaks AND TESTIFIES OF HIS BEING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THANK GOD. THERE HAS TO BE A GOD OR THERE WOULD BE NO EARTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE HAS TO BE A CREATOR OR THERE'D BE NO CREATION. AND IF THIS WORD that he CREATED THE EARTH BY GIVES THE PROMISE, IT HAS TO CREATE EXACTLY WHAT THIS EARTH CREATED by his word in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD SAID, "LET THERE BE." And it might took 10 BILLION YEARS. I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKEN, &gt;&gt; BUT HOW LONG IT TAKEN, THAT MEANT NOTHING BECAUSE GOD'S ETERNAL. &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, "LET THERE BE and it begin to tell." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; FOR GOD TOOK HIS OWN WORD AND BELIEVED. AND IF HIS WORD of his creation, his work here proves that he is a creator, then why can't we take his word AND WHAT IT SAYS AND BELIEVE IT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Because it's the same creator's word. Now, his works bear witness. NOW BEFORE GOD THE INFALLIBLE ONE COULD speak anything, it has to be perfect because it can only it CAN ONLY IF IT COMES FROM GOD IS COMING FROM A PERFECT CHANNEL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Now notice this ALL PEOPLE'S everything mannered by their works. when the great municipal bridge was built in Sydney, Australia, when they sent around THE WORLD TO GET BRIDGE BUILDERS, architects and from what across the peninsula at at Sydney, AUSTRALIA TO SPEND OVER TO SOUTH SYDNEY. The architects AND ALL CAME AND DUG UP THE SORROW AND TESTED IT. AND ALL OF THEM COME TO THIS CONCLUSION. IT CANNOT BE DONE. SAID THE WHOLE BAY IS FULL OF QUICKSAND AND THE SOIL WILL NOT HOLD TOGETHER ENOUGH. IT'LL SHIFT FROM PLACE TO PLACE. THEREFORE, IF THE bridge would be built, it would be a dangerous thing to try to pass over it. AND FINALLY THERE WAS A MAN WHO WAS A MAN OF VISION, a bridge builder in England. He came over and he looked at the sands. He he SURVEYED IT. HE TESTED the soils. HE SAMPLED THE WATERS. HE LOOKED IT ALL OVER FIRST. OH, I love that. Amen. &gt;&gt; HE LOOKED IT ALL OVER. FIRST, JESUS SAID, "A MAN BUYING A GROUND OR GOING TO MEET AN ARMY, FIRST HE SITS DOWN AND COUNTS the cost." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every one of you at the altar THIS MORNING WOULD SIT THERE IN YOUR SEATS BEFORE YOU COME TO BE ANOINTED AND WOULD COUNT WHAT IT MEANS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. It wouldn't be just going through a prayer line half-hazardly. IT WOULD BE GOING THERE WITH A FIRM CONFIDENCE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT GOD HAD PROMISED IT AND GOD [screaming] WAS ABLE TO KEEP IT. &gt;&gt; Thank God. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO THIS MAN tested the soils. He tested the each bed in there that had the quicksand. And finally he went TO THE OFFICIALS. HE SAID, "I WILL build the bridge and it will be safe." THE BRIDGE BUILDERS OF AMERICA AND different parts of the world only laughed AND SAID THE MAN IS MENTALLY ILL. NO MAN COULD PUT A BRIDGE across that. Said even IF A CHICKEN SHOULD WALK THE BRIDGE THAT WOULD BE BUILT, IT WOULD SINK. THE BRIDGE CANNOT STAND IT. THE VIBRATIONS OF EVEN THE DOG RUNNING ACROSS THE BRIDGE WHICH WILL VIBRATE THE BRIDGE. SO IT WOULD SHAKE THE SANDS AND THE BRIDGE WOULD GO DOWN. IT CANNOT BE DONE. BUT THIS MAN WAS A MAN OF VISION AND HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT FOR SOMETHING DOWN IN HIM TOLD HIM HE COULD DO IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD GIVE US MAN IN THE CHURCH LIKE THAT. AH, &gt;&gt; now from all of the scientific research that it could not be done, SCIENCE PROVED THAT IT COULD NOT BE DONE. BUT THIS MAN had a vision he could do it. So he took the contract quickly. He went to work. He went to testing the soils. He went to testing and sounded the depths OF THE QUICK SANDBED. HE TESTED EVERY BOAT. HE TESTED EVERY PIECE OF OF WOOD, EVERY PIECE OF METAL, EVERY CONCRETE. EVERYTHING HAD TO BE PERFECTLY TESTED BECAUSE HIS his great name AND HIS CHARACTER AND HIS ABILITY RESTED ON WHETHER THAT BRIDGE STOOD OR NOT. &gt;&gt; MY AND IF A MAN OF THIS EARTH BY A VISION WOULD BE SURE THAT EVERYTHING WAS TESTED PERFECTLY BEFORE HE PUT IT IN A BRIDGE BECAUSE OF HIS CHARACTER &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE OF HIS NAME. HOW [screaming] MUCH MORE DID OUR BLESSED HEAVENLY FATHER &gt;&gt; AMEN. TEST EVERY WORD THAT WAS EVER SAID OR WROTE IN THE BIBLE. &gt;&gt; HE TESTED EVERY WORD EVERY PROPHET AND EVERY SON THAT COMETH TO GOD must be tested. &gt;&gt; THE MATERIAL THAT GOES IN THIS great highway, EVERY ROCK, EVERY MATERIAL BEFORE IT'S PLACED INTO THE THE BODY OF CHRIST HAS TO BE TRIED. CHASEN EVERY SON THAT COMETH TO GOD MUST FIRST BE TRIED. &gt;&gt; No exceptions. EVERYONE, [screaming] &gt;&gt; EVERY PROPHET BEFORE HE COULD WRITE IN THAT BIBLE, HE WAS TESTED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. God &gt;&gt; just as he the bridge builder, I'm sorry I forget his name. I knew it COUPLE DAYS AGO. I WAS READING THE ARTICLE. PROUD OF IT. He had everything tested. HE GOT THE BEST MECHANICS HE COULD FIND. HE GOT THE BEST CONCRETE MAN. HE GOT THE BEST THAT HE COULD FIND TO PUT TOGETHER THE BEST THAT HE HAD. &gt;&gt; OH MY SOUL WOULD CRY, HALLELUJAH TO GOD WHEN I THINK THAT GOD PUTS IN HIS CHURCH THE BEST THAT HE CAN FIND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise God. GOD TAKES HIS CHILDREN AND TESTS THEM WITH ACID [laughter] TEST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Then he places them into the body of Christ because they are tested. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; they believe. &gt;&gt; THEY'VE WENT THROUGH THE TRIALS. &gt;&gt; THEY'VE HAD THE EXPERIENCE. THEY ARE WITNESSES OF HIS. &gt;&gt; THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE talking about. NOT JUST AN INTELLECTUAL CONCEPTION, BUT THEY'VE BEEN BORN AGAIN OF THE PRECIOUS HOLY SPIRIT and time tested and tried &gt;&gt; UNTIL THEIR SOULS ARE SET LIKE plate towards Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, they are timeested. They are witnesses of his powers. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; AND THROUGH THAT, GOD'S BUILDING A BRIDGE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. from earth to glory that the way we man may come ON THE HIGHWAY S THE trees &gt;&gt; in the cool of the day but timeested material &gt;&gt; those who take God at his word NO MATTER WHAT THE SYMPTOMS ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT DOESN'T STAND IN IT way &gt;&gt; God's got timeested material as a witness &gt;&gt; and he places it And this great bridge builder, WHEN FINALLY THE ARCHITECT STOOD ALONG ON THE SIDE AND SAID to the builder, "Man, the critics, it'll never stand." So have they said, "The church will never rise." So have they said the days of miracles has passed. SO HAVE THEY SAID THAT OLD TIME RELIGION CANNOT be enjoyed anymore. BUT OH, when this man placed all those materials together, HE DUG, HE GOT BLOWERS AND HE BLOWED OUT THOSE QUICK SAND BEDS. HE WENT ON DOWN, DOWN, DOWN FOR HUNDREDS OF FEET BENEATH THE WATER UNTIL HE BUMPED THAT SHIFTING SANDS AWAY UNTIL HE PUT THIS CONCRETE ANCHORED IN THE ROCK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA. OH, it was a price. Yes. AND ANYTHING THAT'S WORTH HAVING HAS A PRICE ATTACHED to it. &gt;&gt; How great is salvation. What a great price. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; BUT HE FINALLY GOT DOWN UNDER THE shifting sands and God has taken Christians and tried them and tried THEM AND HAD TO BRUSH THEM OFF AND BRUSH THEM OFF AND BRUSH THEM OFF TILL FINALLY ONE OF THESE days &gt;&gt; he comes down to the solid rock. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some man just takes this little wishy-washy experience of shaking hands and joined the church and being sprinkled A FEW TIMES OR BAPTIZED OR SOMETHING and he washes ALL THE SHIFTING SANDS BACK UNTIL HE'S ANCHORED ON THE ROCK CHRIST JESUS. &gt;&gt; All devils in torment can't move him. &gt;&gt; The bridge builder know what he was doing. And when finally was completed, some of them said, "It won't stand. It'll be dangerous for anything to cross it. He got around a bunch of engineers and with railroads. And that DAY WHEN THEY PASSED FROM SOUTH SYDNEY GOING TO NORTH Sydney across the span, [clears throat] HE PUT ABOUT EIGHT BIG FREIGHT trains loaded down and HE PUT THE MAYOR OF THE CITY IN A CAR AND HE GOT IN THE FRONT OF it walking PACKING THE FLAG. THAT IS THE GREAT ARMY AND THE BIG eight big steam engines LOADED DOWN MARCHED ACROSS that bridge [clears throat] WITH THE BUILDER TAKING THE FIRST PLACE GOING IN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SHE NEVER EVEN MOVED. &gt;&gt; AND JESUS CHRIST, GOD'S SON, WHO'S THE ARCHITECT OF THE CHURCH, &gt;&gt; come to THIS EARTH AND LAID DOWN THE FOUNDATION. WHEN HE MET THE DEVIL, HE WAS TESTED BY THE WORD OF GOD AND HE SAID, "IT IS WRITTEN." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; MAN SHALL NOT LIVE BY BREAD ALONE. &gt;&gt; When he took him to the pinnacle of the temple, HE SAID, "IT IS WRITTEN." SEE THE MATERIAL HE'S PUTTING IN HIS CHURCH. &gt;&gt; He took him to the mountain AND SHOWED HIM ALL THE GREAT PROGRAMS HE COULD HAVE. HE SAID, "IT is written." [clears throat] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ALL THE WORD OF GOD WAS TIMEESTED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND HE'S A GREAT CAPTAIN THAT IS GOING BEFORE US WITH HIS OWN BLOODY COAT WAVING THAT TO THE REDEEMING OF THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST HAS BOUGHT A CHURCH BY THE HOLY SPIRIT THAT TESTED every boat and every person has ever anchored in the street church of the living God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's a timetestive material that does it. AND AS HE MARCHES ON THE GREAT REGIME COMING BEHIND HIM AS A BORN AGAIN CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SHE DON'T MOVE BECAUSE WE HAVE RECEIVED A kingdom that cannot be moved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's dug plumb to the solid rock of Christ Jesus being that chosen. &gt;&gt; And as he goes before us with his own bloody coat making the way, it's a sign of redemption. witnesses. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YE SHALL BE my witnesses &gt;&gt; both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaritan. &gt;&gt; His church stands as his witness. &gt;&gt; Now this morning, I'd like to state this to leave this to you. We are his WITNESSES AFTER YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE Holy Spirit. For there can only be one THING YOU CAN WITNESS. THAT IS WHAT YOU KNOW TO BE THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; THAT FELL COULD WITNESS AFTER HE HAD BLOWN ALL THE SANDS AWAY AND FOUND THE SOLID ROCK ON THE BREAST OF THE EARTH. HE WAS A WITNESS THAT THAT WOULD HOLD. HE PUT THE GUGERS AND THE machines on those GREAT PIECES OF MATERIAL AND TESTED EVERY one of them. My &gt;&gt; he WAS A WITNESS THAT THEY WOULD HOLD &gt;&gt; FOR IT TO STREAK AND she held &gt;&gt; and we who are thorned again of THE HOLY SPIRIT THAT'S BEEN FILLED WITH GOD'S POWER THAT'S TASTED THE ETERNAL LIFE OF the eternal GOD AND THAT DWELLS IN US ARE WITNESSES of his goodness and his word and his power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's no more guess so. It's a no. Amen. &gt;&gt; By experience, NOAH WHEN HE BUILT THE ARK, he gave WITNESS TO THE UNRIGHTEOUS world that there was a righteous God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Although it seemed to be crazy while it WAS BEING BUILT, BUT IT PROVED OUT THAT IT WAS THE ONLY BOAT THAT WOULD FLOAT THROUGH THE STORM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And as it was being erected, it was he condemned the unrighteous world and justified those who believed in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. How ridiculous sometime God does things and as a man. Did you ever stop to think what kind of wood that Noah built that boat out of? &gt;&gt; IT WAS BUILT OUT OF SHED WOOD. &gt;&gt; And that is the softest wood that can be gotten. &gt;&gt; It's just like balsam. &gt;&gt; IT'S WHY YOU THROW IT IN THE LAKE UNDER IT WOULD SINK IN five minutes. It's balsam wood or shed wood has holes to it. And isn't it a strange thing that a art was the standard test of the great Andolian DESTRUCTION WAS MADE OUT OF SOFT WOOD. &gt;&gt; WELL, it was appliable. And sometime when WE GET SO HARD AND SET IN OUR WAYS, GOD CAN'T APPLY us to anything. &gt;&gt; But here's the reason he DID IT. DID YOU NOTICE AFTER HE MADE IT &gt;&gt; THAT HE BORROWED some tar or some rosin? It was OUT OF THE OTHER TREES. NOW, WHAT does this mean? WHEN HE PUT THE ARK TOGETHER, IT WAS MADE OUT OF THIS REAL LIGHT soft wood. You can lift it around very easy. It's so light and pliable. AND THEN HE CUT DOWN ANOTHER TREE WHICH WAS A PINE TREE. And they beat that the way they used to get it. beat it and beat it until THEY BEAT THE ROSIN out of it. And then HE TOOK THIS ROSIN AND POURED IT INTO this lightwood and the little holes that WAS IN THE LIGHTWOOD FILLED UP WITH THE ROSIN AND CASED MADE IT HARDLY STEEL. &gt;&gt; AND GOD TAKING HIS CHURCH WHO EMPTIES HIMSELF OUT &gt;&gt; AND NOTHING BUT [laughter] THE PLIABLE IN THE HANDS OF GOD. GOD CUT HIS OWN SON DOWN AND TOOK THE LIFE OF HIS SON BY BEATENS AND BRUISES AND POURED IT INTO THE BELIEVER AND HE BECOMES CHASENED FOR THE JUDGMENTS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S the only thing who take THE JUDGMENT. IT PASSED RIGHT OVER THE JUDGMENTS. OF COURSE, SHE went right through the the water was the judgment &gt;&gt; and it passed through the judgment. It was A WITNESS THAT GOD KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING. &gt;&gt; Noah followed the word of God. Many things could be said that Daniel was a witness that there was AN ANGEL IN HEAVEN OR A GOD IN heaven that know the secrets of the heart. For he sent his angel and DELIVERED DANIEL. MANY OTHERS WAS WITNESS WHEN JESUS died on the cross. The heavens give witness. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE IS THE MATERIAL. &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE THING. IF YOU'LL NOTICE, ALL CREATION GAVE WITNESS TO IT. &gt;&gt; Right in the middle OF THE DAY WHEN GOD HAD PROPHESIED BEFORE WHEN THE SABBATH WOULD CEASE. SAID, "There'll be a time when the sun goes down in the middle of the day and from THE SIXTH AND GOING HOUR, IT WAS DARKNESS." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT? THE SUN. DARKNESS DOESN'T MEAN IT'S got a little LIGHT IN IT. DARKNESS IS ABSOLUTELY TOTAL DARKNESS. SO DARK LIKE IT WAS IN EGYPT TILL IT COULD BE FELT. &gt;&gt; NOT A RAY OF LIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND THE SUN GAVE WITNESS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE'S THE ONE. THAT'S THE MATERIAL THAT GOD'S GOING TO BUILD A CHURCH OUT OF. THE MOON AND STARS GAVE WITNESS. WHEN IT DIED, THE HEAVENS GAVE WITNESS. THE EARTH BELTS. THE ROCKS RAN OUT. The earth gave witness. [clears throat] And the saints who stepped in THE EARTH DUST OF THE EARTH ROSE GAVE WITNESS. &gt;&gt; The people AT PENTECOST WHEN THEY WERE making fun. PETER STOOD UP AND GAVE WITNESS. BUT SOME OF THAT SAME LIFE THAT HAD BEEN BEAT OUT OF CALVARY WAS POURED INTO PETER IN THE FORM OF THE HOLY GHOST. AND HE STOOD THERE AS A WITNESS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD'S WORD. AND HE GAVE WITNESS WITH A TEXT OUT OF SCRIPTURE. THAT SAID, "YOU MEN OF JUDEA, YOU DWELL IN JERUSALEM, LET THIS BE KNOWN UNTO YOU, TO HEARKEN TO MY WORDS, FOR THESE ARE NOT DRUNK AS YOU SUPPOSED, BUT THIS IS THAT." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS SPOKEN OUT BY THE PROPHET JOEL. IT'LL COME TO PASS IN THE LAST DAYS, I'LL POUR OUT OF MY SPIRIT UPON ALL FLESH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It was a witness. &gt;&gt; Yes. Now, we're coming into these last and evil days when he's going to have witnesses. He's got to have witnesses. God lives. God's word is eternal. Now, let's take back to our scripture reading. Jesus coming off the mount. He was hungry and he looked in a tree and there was no fruit on it. He perhaps never raised his voice. He never stood out and said, "Now, gentlemen, stand to one side. I want to show you my power." He said, "I HAVE POWER TO MAKE THAT TREE do such and such." He never said that. He just walked up to it. He didn't find no nothing on it. So, he said, "No, man." He just knew walked away. Peter heard it. And the next day when he come back, oh, the tree was still there, but it was dead. And he remarked about it, how quick that tree had dried up from its roots. Jesus said, "No." And look, it wasn't the tree's fault. It was not time for figs yet. But he did it to magnify himself, to prove himself, to he was the Messiah. And that was one of the testimonies that he was the Messiah. &gt;&gt; That was a seal of his messiahship. The last seal was his resurrection, his ascension. That was the last steel of his messiahship. What he done was a proof that he was now he went around said all you treat. He just did it there so that the disciples that was going to write this scripture later would know that he was Messiah. Amen. &gt;&gt; See &gt;&gt; now then when Peter asked this question, behold how quick the tree witherth, then he said to them, if thou should say to this mountain, be moved and cast into the sea, and don't doubt, but believe that what you say will come to pass, you'll have what you say. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now listen, that's part of the material in this great economy of God, this great ship that we're in, the old ship of Zion, in the body of Christ. Now to the testimony. It has been sometimes I've watched this. And now listen close now for a little teaching. There's been times in life when all when I've looked at the suffering and see those who were afflicted and tormented with demon powers, my heart just bleeds for him. And yet I've had him to call me on the telephone and in the meetings that clamor and move and draw and pull. It is so hard to say no to those people. Frankly, I can't do it. Somebody says it for me. &gt;&gt; I can't get to them. How my heart just bleeds for them. Day after day I go through the tortures of that. I wonder sometimes and I then I console myself by going back to scripture see going through that place of Bethesda and seeing all those and afflicted and went over to one man healed in lay on a pallet and walked away and left the rest. But still down in my heart that makes me it doesn't take away that burning. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Oh, how I wish there was something that could happen. Then I noticed yonder in Portland, Oregon that maniac that night run to the platform to kill me. I remember there something happened and it wasn't intellectuals at all. Intellectually, I would have run like the rest of preachers did, but I didn't run. There was something. GOD WAS GETTING READY TO DISPLAY HIS POWER. &gt;&gt; One time he said, "Be still and know that I'm God." &gt;&gt; If the church would only stand still long enough, &gt;&gt; God will do a little something. They'll get all excited and run around doing, see, get out of the will of God. be still. One time he's going to show his power in the Red Sea. He said, "RED SEA, YOU JUST stand still &gt;&gt; and he marched his children right through it." &gt;&gt; What if they turn around and said, "Let's do it again, Lord." It wouldn't have happened. &gt;&gt; Certainly not. One time he needed a little time to fight a battle, too. God just made the son stand still to watch what he's going to do. &gt;&gt; Now, son, you just stand still in there a few minutes. I'm going to show you something. Now what if the next day Joshua say son stand still it would have done it. &gt;&gt; God was going to do something. &gt;&gt; He's going to give a witness to his power. &gt;&gt; His word is almighty and he's give a witness to it. One time there's a blind man come out from Jericho. And as Jesus passed through the blind man scream have mercy on me. And the Bible said and Jesus stood still. said, "Bring him here." &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Christ stood still for God was going to use him &gt;&gt; to show his power. There might have been 100 more blind men down the road. I don't know. Perhaps the priest said, "Come here, MAN. WHO ARE YOU WHO RAISED THE DEAD? RAISE. WE GOT A GRAVEYARD FULL of them. We heard you raised Lazarus." But God was confirming his messiahship. &gt;&gt; That's what he was doing certainly. Now, I've often wondered what takes place. But there is a place that man can live so close to the presence of God. It's not by your choosing. It's by God's election &gt;&gt; that you live IN THAT SPOT TO WHERE your own intellectuals has nothing more to do with it. down in South Africa. I was challenged by a bunch of witch doctors and standing there one among the dozen or more and them TRYING TO THROW SPELLS on me, but God just made them stand still. What's the glory of God to restore sight and blindness stuff to the afflicted people? &gt;&gt; Yonder in Carl's Route Germany. One afternoon when the spears come out to the they wanted to fuss with me at the hotel, the man wouldn't let him come in. They said we'll throw a spell on that meeting this afternoon and there'll be no one coming. No, I said we'll blow it down with the storm and the sky is pretty and bright. But when we got over there and just started the singing, up come a great powerful storm. There's about 20 on one side of it, 20 on the other. And they were all going through their enchantments and cutting their feathers with scissors and going through things like that to throw the spell. And all of a sudden that great 30,000 teeth begin to quiver and shake and the winds blowing. And I was preaching [clears throat] and something said, "Stand still." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't say excuse me. That means praise our God. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND GOD MADE THAT STORM STAND STILL. &gt;&gt; Move back TO SEE THE PRAISES OF GOD WHERE ABOUT 40,000 SOULS THAT DAY AND NIGHT SWEPT INTO THE KINGDOM of God by &gt;&gt; stand still. &gt;&gt; That's right. He gives witness &gt;&gt; yonder in Sweden or Switzerland. Well, I hear I say over in Finland one day, a little dead boy was laying on the side of the road. Automobile had run over him, mashed his little body to pieces. HE WAS SO BROKE UP UNTIL HIS FOOT WAS even to his stocking. The car run over HIM AND WRAPPED HIM UP LIKE A RAG like that and kicked him way up in the air and throw him across the road. &gt;&gt; HIS EYES IS BULGED OUT. HIS MOUTH IS OPEN. HIS TONGUE IS HANGING OUT. BLOOD RUNNING FROM his ears. But two years before there, God had showed the vision of it &gt;&gt; and I walked up so stupid and looked at the child, walked away crying and [clears throat] the Lord or someone supernatural put their hands on my shoulder said, "Isn't that the boy I showed you?" &gt;&gt; Oh, what a healing. There stood the mayor of the city, the chief man he's called, and many standing by. AND GOD HAD THEM TO STAND STILL THAT HE COULD SHOW HIS MIGHTY POWER TO RAISE THE DEAD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Bring him back to life again. Stand still. Believe God. Be a witness. His word's eternal. It was a few days ago when we were just TO SEE HOW GOD does things so simple and we were so frustrated till we look for great big things. &gt;&gt; Be satisfied with little things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch him when he does his glorious works. &gt;&gt; How he protects you. Don't be looking way over the top of something. Look down here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Notice I begin to think this that it is possible that when a man like the apostles and when you can live close to God AND GOD TO HIS GRACE OPERATES THROUGH you that the MORE GOD YOU GET THE MORE GODLY YOU BECOME. &gt;&gt; The more eternal life comes in the more of the intellectual it pushes out. &gt;&gt; Now I don't mean to be a fanatic. I mean to be a real sane sound believer. &gt;&gt; Not a bunch of ism but a real solid true sensible intelligent believer. Amen. God bless you. How many thank the Lord for the word? An intelligent believer. That's what he says. A sane, sensible, intelligent believer. Amen. We will uh we just want to thank the Lord for his word tonight. So, so good. And we'll continue to listen to that. Uh let's sing that old hymn, What a Friend We Have in Jesus. before we prepare to go. What a friend have in Jesus. [singing] All our [singing and music] sins and grief to bear. And what [singing and music] a privilege to care [singing and music] [music and singing] to God in prayer. and oh we [singing and music] off and oh what needless [singing and music] pain we bear and all because we do not air bring every ever every to God in prayer. [singing and music] Have we trials and have [music] we trials and temptation? [singing] [music] Is there trouble anywhere? [singing and music] And we should never [singing and music] be disturbed. Praise [music] [singing] to the Lord in prayer. [music] Can we find a friend so faithful? [music] [singing] And who will all our [music] sorrow share? [singing] Jesus knows.
