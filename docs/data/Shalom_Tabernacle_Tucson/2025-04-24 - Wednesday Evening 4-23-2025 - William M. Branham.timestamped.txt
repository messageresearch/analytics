[4:04] Are you happy to be here today? I'm glad

[4:17] [Music]
[4:23] Dear

[4:31] Lord
[4:33] Jesus, dear Lord, will you open up our

[4:46] your presence here tonight. Lord, to
[4:49] meet with us, Lord, to be in the
[4:51] singing, to be in the preaching, Lord
[4:54] Jesus. Be in the prayer,

[5:12] name. Amen.
[5:16] Amen. Go ahead and turn and shake the
[5:18] hand of your brother or sister next to
[5:20] you. Don't give them a high five, but
[5:22] welcome them to the house of the
[5:23] [Music]
[5:26] Lord. Let's go with the key of
[5:31] G above all
[5:35] powers, above all
[5:39] kings, above all nature.
[5:42] and all created
[5:47] things above all
[5:49] wisdom and all the ways of
[5:54] [Music]
[5:56] man. You were there before the world
[6:02] began. Above all
[6:06] kingdoms, above all
[6:10] thrones, above all wonderers the world
[6:15] has ever
[6:18] known. Above all
[6:21] wealth and treasures of the
[6:27] earth, there's no way to measure what
[6:31] you're
[6:34] worth. You were
[6:39] crucified, laid behind a
[6:42] stone. You live to die.
[6:47] Rejected and
[6:49] alone like a
[6:52] rose trampled on the
[6:57] ground. You took the
[7:00] fall and thought of
[7:05] me above all. For you were
[7:12] [Music]
[7:14] crucified, laid behind a
[7:17] stone. You live to
[7:21] die, rejected and
[7:24] alone like a
[7:27] rose, trampled on the ground.
[7:32] You took the
[7:35] fall and thought of
[7:40] me above
[7:44] all. Amen. You may be
[7:47] seated. You are not a God
[7:51] created by human hands.
[7:55] You are not a God
[7:59] dependent on any mortal
[8:02] man. You are not a God in need
[8:07] of anything we can give by your
[8:13] plan. That's just the way it is. Let's
[8:17] sing that verse one more time.
[8:21] You are not a God
[8:25] created by human
[8:28] hands. You are not a God
[8:33] depending on any mortal
[8:36] man. You are not a God in need
[8:41] of anything we can give. and by your
[8:46] plan. That's just the way it
[8:52] is. For you are God
[8:56] alone from before time
[9:01] began. You are on your
[9:04] throne and you are God alone.
[9:10] And right now in the good time and
[9:16] bad you are on your
[9:20] throne. And you are God
[9:27] alone. You're the only God whose
[9:32] power none can contend.
[9:36] You're the only God whose
[9:40] name praise will never end. You're the
[9:44] only God who's
[9:47] worthy of everything we can give. You
[9:52] are God and that's just the way it
[9:59] is. For you are God
[10:03] alone from before time
[10:07] began. You were on your
[10:11] throne. And you are God
[10:15] alone. And right
[10:18] now in the good times and
[10:23] bad, you are on your
[10:26] throne. And you are God
[10:31] alone. You're
[10:35] unchangeable. You're
[10:39] unshakeable. You're
[10:42] unstoppable. That's what you
[10:45] [Music]
[10:46] are. You're
[10:51] unchangeable. You're unshakeable.
[10:55] You're
[10:58] unstoppable. That's what you
[11:01] are. For you are God
[11:05] alone from before time
[11:09] began. You are on your
[11:13] throne. And you are God alone.
[11:19] And right now in the good time and
[11:25] bad you are on your
[11:29] throne. You are God alone.
[11:34] And right
[11:36] now in the good time and
[11:41] bad you are on your
[11:44] throne and you are God
[11:50] alone. Amen. It's the only God we can
[11:53] say that about. You are God alone.
[12:00] Jesus has a table spread where the
[12:04] saints of God are fed. He invites his
[12:08] chosen people. Come and
[12:11] die. Oh, with his man a he
[12:15] of supplies our every need. Oh sweet us
[12:21] up with Jesus all the time.
[12:25] Oh, come and dine, the master calling.
[12:29] Come and
[12:31] dine. Oh, you made feast at Jesus table
[12:36] all the
[12:38] time. Oh, he who fed the
[12:42] multitude, turned the water into wine.
[12:46] to the hungry call it now come and
[12:52] on the disciples came to land thus
[12:57] obeying Christ command for the master
[13:02] called to them come and
[13:06] die oh there they found their heart's
[13:10] desire bread and fish upon the fire thus
[13:15] he satis satisfies the hungry every
[13:20] time. Oh, come and dine. The master
[13:24] callth. Come
[13:28] and you may feast at Jesus table all the
[13:35] time. He who fed the
[13:39] multitude turn the water into one. To
[13:44] the hungry call it now come and
[13:49] die. And soon the lamb will take his
[13:53] bride to be ever at his
[13:57] side. All the host of heaven will
[14:01] assembled
[14:02] [Music]
[14:04] me. Oh, it will be a glorious sight. All
[14:09] the saints in spotless wine and with
[14:13] Jesus they will feast
[14:18] eternally. Oh come and die the master
[14:22] call it come and
[14:26] die. Oh you may feast at Jesus table all
[14:31] the
[14:33] time. He who fed the
[14:37] multitude turned the water into wine. To
[14:42] the hungry call it now come
[14:48] and oh he who fed the
[14:52] multitude, turn the water into wine. To
[14:58] the hungry call it now. Come and
[15:04] dine. Amen. That's what we're here to do
[15:06] is to come and and feast on his
[15:10] table. Let's go to the key of
[15:13] C. I know not why God's wonderful grace
[15:20] to
[15:21] me have made known.
[15:26] For why
[15:30] unworthy Christ in
[15:32] love
[15:34] redeemed before his own.
[15:39] Oh, but I know whom I have believed
[15:45] in and am
[15:49] persuaded that he is
[15:52] aable to keep that which I've
[15:59] committed unto
[16:02] him against that
[16:06] day. And I know not how this
[16:12] saving
[16:14] faith to
[16:16] me
[16:18] did
[16:20] part, nor how
[16:25] believing in his word brought peace
[16:31] within my heart. Let's go to the next
[16:34] verse. Oh, I know not how the
[16:41] spirit
[16:42] moves,
[16:44] convincing men of
[16:49] sin,
[16:51] revealing
[16:53] Jesus through his
[16:56] word,
[16:58] creating faith in him.
[17:03] Oh, but I know who I have believe
[17:09] in and am
[17:13] persuaded that he is
[17:17] aable to keep that which I've
[17:25] committed unto
[17:27] him against that day.
[17:32] And I
[17:34] know not what of good or
[17:39] ill may be reserved for
[17:44] [Music]
[17:46] me of
[17:49] weary ways or golden
[17:54] days
[17:55] before his face I see.
[18:00] Next verse. And I know not when my Lord
[18:07] may
[18:08] come at night or no day
[18:15] fair. Nor if I'll walk the veil with
[18:23] him or meet him in the air.
[18:30] Oh, but I know
[18:33] whom I have believe
[18:36] in and am
[18:40] persuaded that he is
[18:44] aable to keep that which I've
[18:52] committed unto
[18:54] him against that
[19:00] Hey,
[19:02] amen.
[19:03] Amen. As we move to change the order of
[19:06] the service, let's go to the key of D.
[19:08] Let's all stand. Sing that song. I'm
[19:12] amazed. I'm
[19:16] amazed that you love
[19:19] [Music]
[19:20] me. I'm
[19:24] amazed how you care.
[19:28] Through your
[19:30] preious blood, I found
[19:34] [Music]
[19:35] pardon. And my
[19:38] sins are
[19:40] washed. They're all washed away. All my
[19:46] sins are washed away.
[19:52] Oh, no one
[19:54] knew how
[19:56] alone I was
[20:00] feeling. And the emptiness I tried so
[20:04] hard to
[20:07] hide. Though I laughed and said, my life
[20:12] was fine without you.
[20:16] I was covering up the secret tears I
[20:23] cried. And one day someone told me of
[20:29] your
[20:30] [Music]
[20:31] mercy and the love you showed on a hill
[20:36] called Calvary.
[20:37] [Music]
[20:40] You
[20:42] died and purchased my
[20:47] redemption. When you broke sin's power
[20:50] and set my spirit
[20:55] free, I'm
[20:59] amazed that you love
[21:03] me. I'm
[21:06] amazed how you care.
[21:11] Through your
[21:13] preious blood, I found
[21:18] pardon. And my sins are washed. They're
[21:24] all washed away. All my
[21:28] sins are washed away. Let's sing that
[21:33] one more time. Oh, I'm amazed. Brother
[21:37] Jill,
[21:44] so amazed that you
[21:48] care. Through your
[21:52] preious blood, I found
[21:57] pardon. And my sins are washed. They're
[22:03] all washed away.
[22:06] All my sins are
[22:09] washed away. And my sins are
[22:15] washed. They're all washed away. All my
[22:21] sins are
[22:23] washed
[22:26] away. Amen. So amazed that he loved even
[22:29] a sinner like me. Saints, so good to be
[22:32] in church with each one of you. I know
[22:33] William James is happy to be here. How
[22:36] did you know that, Brother Joe? Well, he
[22:37] watches me bang a little bit in the back
[22:39] on that tambourine and he smiles. So, we
[22:42] got a few smiles tonight. It's sure good
[22:44] to be with each one. A couple of
[22:45] visitors. Sister um Arvy, we're sure
[22:48] glad to have you here at the new church.
[22:50] And uh the Dubskys here all the way down
[22:53] from Phoenix, a musician, great musician
[22:55] for brother Ron there. And so, we
[22:57] appreciate having them. Good to see uh
[23:00] Josh and Mate and really Rosie, but
[23:02] we're happy to have them too. Um we know
[23:06] you've been doing some traveling. We
[23:07] miss your father-in-law. He'd probably
[23:09] poke you a little bit. So sorry for the
[23:12] jab there, but it's good to have you
[23:13] guys. And we miss them in different
[23:15] ones. So as far the order of a service
[23:18] for our visitors, we'll listen to the
[23:21] best preacher here for about 30 minutes
[23:23] finishing once more. A real good tape
[23:25] we're looking forward to tonight. And
[23:27] then we'll go in pray for pray requests.
[23:30] I'll mention a few of those things if
[23:31] you've got something you'd like to bring
[23:33] to the church. We'll let you do that
[23:34] after the tape and we'll just go in
[23:36] prayer as we miss our pastor tonight
[23:39] over in Liberia and and those things.
[23:42] So, God bless you real real good
[23:45] tonight. It's good to be in house of the
[23:47] Lord. You know, Wednesday we let our
[23:48] hair down a little bit, maybe come a
[23:50] little underdressed or just coming in
[23:52] from work. Um my daughter is always uh
[23:55] coming directly from work and things. So
[23:57] just real good to take time out with the
[23:59] Lord and with you tonight. Amen. Only
[24:03] [Music]
[24:05] believe.
[24:06] Only
[24:10] believe.
[24:12] Only
[24:15] believe that all things are
[24:21] possible. Yes.
[24:24] Only believe.
[24:27] [Music]
[24:28] Only
[24:32] believe,
[24:34] only
[24:37] be all things are
[24:43] possible.
[24:45] Only me. Let's confess together. Lord, I
[24:49] believe.
[24:51] Lord, I believe.
[24:55] Yes,
[24:57] Lord, I
[24:59] [Music]
[25:01] believe. All things are
[25:06] possible. Lord, I I
[25:12] believe.
[25:14] Lord, I
[25:16] [Music]
[25:18] believe.
[25:20] Lord, I believe.
[25:24] All things are
[25:29] possible. A Lord
[25:35] I Amen. You can be
[25:44] seated. How we ought to let the thoughts
[25:47] go through our mind of the great
[25:49] victories. I don't have time to get it
[25:51] and keep my word to
[25:54] you. And of
[25:57] God that raised him up for this purpose.
[26:01] And there he stands between those two
[26:03] posts, blinded, defeated,
[26:07] humiliated. He was still the same big
[26:10] bulk that he ever was, but his strength
[26:12] was gone. The church is anything. It's
[26:17] stronger in membership than it ever
[26:20] was. But where is the word the strength
[26:23] being
[26:26] manifested? It's been cut off from
[26:29] you by
[26:31] your power shaving
[26:36] organizations. He had failed
[26:39] God. Not only had he failed God, but he
[26:42] failed his own people.
[26:45] He was a total
[26:46] failure. Now he was a prisoner to the
[26:49] very nation that God raised him up to
[26:52] destroy. And here stands the last
[26:55] organization of the church Pentecost
[26:57] this afternoon just as defeated as
[26:59] Samson was.
[27:03] You might not believe that, but if
[27:06] you'll just open your mind to the word,
[27:08] you'll see it's the truth.
[27:15] had him doing tricks for
[27:20] entertainment. How sometime I said not
[27:23] long ago, these full gospel businessmen,
[27:25] as well as I love them, they're in their
[27:28] magazine writing up, "Holy Reverend
[27:30] Father, so and
[27:32] so, you poor, deluded, blind
[27:36] Pentecostals.
[27:38] What's the matter with you?
[27:42] Don't you know our savior said, "Don't
[27:44] call no man on this earth father."
[27:50] Don't you realize the devil's only
[27:52] taking somebody's been kicked out of one
[27:54] of those out here and just making a
[27:56] laughing stock out of you?
[28:01] They're not coming in. Don't you let
[28:04] anybody tell you they are. What's the
[28:07] matter with this deluded church? world
[28:10] has punctured its eyes. Don't you know
[28:13] Jesus said that that would happen? And
[28:15] when the sleeping virgin come in to buy
[28:17] oral, she never got it.
[28:22] There's a sleeping virgin. Lutheran,
[28:24] Methodist, Presbyterian, they're not
[28:27] getting it. They might speak with
[28:29] tongues and jump, but that don't mean
[28:31] anything. I've seen heathens do the same
[28:34] thing. and devil worshippers speak in
[28:37] tongues and jump and sing and shout.
[28:43] Drink blood out of a human skull and
[28:45] call on the devil and speak in tongues.
[28:49] You rely on sensations. It's a word of
[28:51] God that don't pass.
[28:56] There she is, defeated just as much as
[28:59] Samson was defeated.
[29:02] doing tricks
[29:03] now. How Satan stand up and laugh at him
[29:06] and said, "Look, they claim they believe
[29:07] the Bible.
[29:09] Look, telling all the angels of heaven,
[29:12] look, look, they they they're Bible
[29:15] believers. Each one of them look at them
[29:16] all, call it together. I'm going to
[29:17] throw them everyone over just exactly
[29:19] going to lead them right in just exactly
[29:21] what the scripture said." They have to
[29:23] do that. There they are,
[29:26] defeated, Delilah, eyes punctured. So
[29:30] they can't see the truth. Jesus said to
[29:32] the Pharisees, "You got eyes and you
[29:35] can't see." You got ears and you can't
[29:38] hear. Why? I said because Isaiah said
[29:41] so. He referred back to the word, the
[29:44] prophet. The God himself, Jesus Christ,
[29:47] referred back to the word of his
[29:49] prophet. And today, the Holy Spirit's
[29:51] bringing your memory back. Amen. Head
[29:55] highminded. Lovers are pleasure more
[29:57] than lovers of God. women, painted
[30:00] faces, wearing shorts, acting like the
[30:03] world, bobbing their hair and doing so
[30:05] forth, having a form of godliness, but
[30:08] denying the power they're up for. You're
[30:10] on the worst screen
[30:11] [Music]
[30:13] that's the Holy Spirit in the word
[30:16] pointing right back to the word again.
[30:18] Oh, you say, "I got
[30:19] it." When you take medicine for a
[30:22] disease, if it don't show up, you better
[30:24] change your medicine.
[30:27] you're dying your
[30:30] sins. The nation, the very
[30:33] purpose, the very thing that they was
[30:36] raised up to destroy Samson is now a
[30:39] victim. And so is the church. Raised up
[30:43] to put denominationalism and the world
[30:46] in the denomination to shame. And you
[30:50] come right into the denomination. And by
[30:52] doing that, you can't follow the
[30:54] scriptures. Every one of them's got a
[30:56] different
[30:58] idea. So you lost your
[31:01] strength. That blinding
[31:05] devil. Let a lure of a woman take him
[31:08] from the the word of God. Now you say,
[31:11] "Brother B, was it was the word of God.
[31:14] Delila took Samson from the word of
[31:17] promise." Yeah. And so has the Jezebel
[31:22] of this day taken the church, lured it
[31:25] from the word of the promised God, holy
[31:29] bible.
[31:32] Oh, same
[31:34] thing. Same exactly
[31:38] thing. What did they do? Let Jezebel
[31:42] spoke of in
[31:43] Revelations the 17th, Revelation 17th
[31:47] chapter.
[31:48] The Catholic Church is represented there
[31:51] and they tell you Sam too. They don't
[31:53] their own book says so. They make no
[31:54] bones of it. How many ever read their
[31:57] own writing and know that that's true?
[31:59] They say the Catholic church is
[32:01] represented. That's right. And you
[32:03] remember she was the mother of harlots.
[32:07] She was a and a mother of harlots.
[32:09] See, it had to be churches, not boys. It
[32:12] was girls, Protestant churches.
[32:16] a mother of harlots. As soon as they
[32:18] organized, they done the same thing they
[32:20] did there. They stripped themselves from
[32:21] the word and have to follow the
[32:24] dictations of some organization.
[32:28] I know this is not popular, but it's the
[32:31] truth.
[32:33] I haven't got no big radio programs and
[32:35] television programs support. God help me
[32:38] to never have. I only want one thing,
[32:41] and that's the support of Jesus Christ
[32:43] by his word.
[32:48] Let him vindicate that I'm telling him
[32:50] the truth by his word.
[32:53] Not some bogus makebelie un scruple
[32:57] thing, but the genuine Holy Spirit
[33:00] himself who takes the promise of this
[33:02] day and shows it as the truth. That's
[33:05] all I long to see. Like Jesus said, if I
[33:08] don't do the works of my father, then
[33:10] don't believe me.
[33:13] Now
[33:15] blind or you say we're not
[33:18] blind. You are blind.
[33:23] The Bible said he was. Every scripture
[33:25] reader knows that this is the Lady Osia
[33:28] church age. How many believe that?
[33:32] Then the Bible said that the Lady of
[33:34] Church was
[33:36] blind,
[33:38] naked, and didn't not
[33:41] There's the bad part. She don't even
[33:44] know it.
[33:46] She's worse than all the other church
[33:48] agents put together.
[33:54] The ox knows his master's crib or stall
[33:59] and the mule knows his crib. He said,
[34:03] "My people don't
[34:04] [Music]
[34:06] know." Blind. Spiritually blind. Blind
[34:10] to what? God's word.
[34:12] Amen. Just as blind as they can be. And
[34:16] they don't want to see it.
[34:19] And you tell them this. Oh, yes. I'm I'm
[34:22] intended to do that, but none of them
[34:23] does it.
[34:26] They can't do it and maintain their
[34:28] fellowship in an organization.
[34:30] They'll kick him right out of it.
[34:34] There she stands.
[34:36] Delilah shaved off his
[34:39] locks. Now he's he's
[34:42] bobbaired like the women in it. Same
[34:46] thing.
[34:47] Now look at them defeated just like they
[34:53] was
[34:55] ministers, the Pentecostal messengers of
[34:59] the early days. You would have never
[35:01] made them man believe that their own
[35:04] children would organize
[35:07] seminaries that they criticize by the
[35:10] word of God and come out of
[35:15] right. What by these seminaries have we
[35:19] got? We brought world into the church.
[35:23] An old ministry used to sing we let down
[35:25] the bars, we compromise, we sin. We let
[35:29] down the bars. The sheep got out. But
[35:30] how did the goats get in? You let down
[35:33] the bars. Got away from the
[35:37] word. When Eve let down the bars to
[35:40] intellectual reasonings of Satan, death
[35:43] come in. And the bars that God had her
[35:46] barred in with was his word of promise.
[35:52] And we substituted something else, a
[35:54] creed instead of the word.
[35:58] Amen.
[36:00] You know that's the truth.
[36:02] What have we got the Pentecostal people
[36:05] today? Too many
[36:08] Ricky's that word Elvis and Ricky. You
[36:11] never heard of that in other days. It's
[36:13] a word. It's a name for this day. It
[36:16] goes with this. It means something. You
[36:17] say a name means nothing. Then why
[36:19] didn't he change Abraham's name to
[36:20] Abraham? Yes.
[36:23] Why did he change uh uh Saul's name to
[36:26] Paul, Simon's name to Peter? Why did he
[36:30] change his own name?
[36:32] Why did he change Jacob to Israel?
[36:36] Not until he wrestled with the Lord.
[36:39] Not until he
[36:41] overcome. And when Jesus overcome death,
[36:44] hell, and the grave, the Bible said he
[36:45] had a new name. Amen.
[36:48] And when Jacob overcome, and if the
[36:50] church can overcome, she'll stop saying,
[36:53] "I'm Methodist, Baptist, and
[36:55] Presbyterian."
[36:57] When she can overcome her
[36:59] creeds and the world that's draw her in
[37:02] there, she'll come back to the bride of
[37:05] Jesus Christ, Miss Jesus Christ.
[37:09] Amen. Amen.
[37:12] What a sad sight as we see Samson
[37:15] standing there.
[37:18] women with short hair, wearing shorts,
[37:21] painted
[37:23] faces and
[37:25] Pentecostals calling themselves
[37:27] Christians, singing in the
[37:30] choir. I was in a Pentecostal assembly
[37:32] not long
[37:33] ago, a great city where a famous great
[37:36] man lives and the meetings got so big I
[37:40] had to take it over to a big place and
[37:41] they had a selected Pentecostal choir.
[37:44] And little did they know I was sitting
[37:45] right down behind the curtains
[37:47] praying. And there every girl in that
[37:50] robe about 35 girls and 35 boys to sing
[37:54] the
[37:55] Messiah was wearing makeup and bob hair.
[38:01] And when David Duplicus was taking up a
[38:04] missionary offering they were acting
[38:06] like they were blonde Barnameus running
[38:07] along passing the cup.
[38:11] That's Pentecostal grandchildren.
[38:14] That ain't a Pentecostal servant of God
[38:17] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The
[38:20] Holy Ghost won't make fun of his own
[38:22] word.
[38:23] He came and remained the Holy Ghost. But
[38:26] that's where you've got to. Amen. Oh,
[38:29] Samson, get to thinking a little bit.
[38:32] Hallelujah.
[38:34] Remember, these tapes are recorded and
[38:35] sent around the world. I'm not only
[38:37] speaking to this group
[38:39] here. Samson begin to think of his
[38:43] eras. Oh, he begin to think of what he
[38:46] was one time. Pentecost, think what you
[38:50] was 1900 years
[38:52] ago. Church, Catholic, Protestant, think
[38:55] what you were 1900 years ago and look
[38:59] what you are
[39:01] today. Study a little
[39:03] while. Just got about eight more
[39:05] minutes.
[39:06] to keep a
[39:08] word.
[39:11] Notice, but while he was standing
[39:16] there, he cried. He began to think of
[39:19] his errors. And when he begin to think
[39:21] of what had happened to him, he was
[39:24] blind. Therefore, he couldn't see no
[39:26] more. He He's accepted something
[39:29] else. For the love of this woman, that's
[39:31] what got him. And she turned him down.
[39:34] Oh, what a trap. I can speak on here
[39:36] that Satan's set for the church. Just
[39:39] get your eyes blinded from the truth and
[39:42] that's what they got you then. And if
[39:43] you only knew it one of these days,
[39:45] God's going to prove it to you what the
[39:47] mark of the beast
[39:52] is. Notice, but when once blinded, there
[39:56] she
[39:57] stands. And there he stood. And he began
[40:00] to remember the things of his eras where
[40:03] he had left the straight and narrow
[40:04] road. Where he'd got away from God's
[40:08] promise and he cried
[40:12] out, "Lord, revenge my
[40:15] eyes." Why do you do this? He knew there
[40:19] was a
[40:21] possibility. Now is where I want you to
[40:23] listen. Samson must have thought of all
[40:27] where he had left the path. He saw it
[40:29] then. It's too late
[40:31] now. He saw it where he'd left the pad.
[40:34] And he thought there must be a
[40:37] possibility that God would
[40:40] answer. He knew if he could repent and
[40:43] get God to see that he was sorry for his
[40:46] error, there was a possibility that God
[40:50] would still achieve his promise.
[40:53] God will do it. He's going to do it.
[40:58] Say
[41:00] now God's going to have that church.
[41:02] Don't you worry. She's going to be to
[41:04] have
[41:06] the Holy Spirit will be moving so in the
[41:09] church and the church in Christ will be
[41:10] the same spirit.
[41:12] Luther stood down on the feet in
[41:14] justification. Wesley stood in the
[41:16] heartbeat of love of sanctification. But
[41:18] this is raised up to the head
[41:21] now. More than that she denominated and
[41:24] the husbandman come along and prune the
[41:26] vine. that died. They never did come
[41:28] back no more. They never will come back
[41:29] no more. But still, there's a seed of
[41:31] life there that's coming
[41:35] on. But
[41:37] notice Samson thought there must be a a
[41:42] possibility. He caught the idea. But the
[41:45] sad part is
[41:47] today the church don't catch that. They
[41:51] don't realize that there is a
[41:53] possibility of a revival.
[41:56] They don't realize the possibility. They
[41:58] haven't caught the vision yet. They just
[42:01] set. Oh, they say, "Now, Brother
[42:03] Brandon, what are you doing?" Oh, I
[42:04] know. You clap your hands and have great
[42:07] big gatherings and glittering with
[42:09] whirly
[42:11] tinsel. You have to go to the biggest
[42:13] places. You have to have the most best
[42:16] entertaining. You have to do this, that,
[42:17] and the
[42:18] other. Your pastor must be a seminary
[42:21] scholar with a doctor's degree. are. You
[42:23] can't tell your neighbors down there
[42:25] that your pastor's some little guy out
[42:27] of the cornfield peel out there that got
[42:28] saved.
[42:31] Amen. He's our pastor is Dr. LLD so and
[42:35] so to me that means he's just that far
[42:38] away from God. That's all. Just that far
[42:41] away intellect always takes him
[42:45] away. Oh, you're shining with
[42:47] scholarship.
[42:49] And another thing about a lot of this
[42:51] modern evangelism today, all the way
[42:53] from Pentecost all the way back is a
[42:56] bunch of Hollywood showmanship.
[43:00] You certainly are glittering with that
[43:03] as the tinsils in the hall of the fish
[43:05] god dagen.
[43:09] But that title and scholarship and
[43:13] intellectual showmanship with a great
[43:16] bride, let none of the public see any
[43:18] defeat and so forth. All that stuff like
[43:20] that, intellectual conceptions of the
[43:22] gospel and so forth that don't bring the
[43:25] power of God to make women quit wearing
[43:28] bobbed hair and man to act like
[43:29] Christians to take their place in a
[43:31] house and raise your children like they
[43:33] ought to. It don't bring the spirit of
[43:36] God. Samson stood there just as big a
[43:39] bulk as he ever was. And the church
[43:42] stands stronger in members than it did
[43:44] 40 years ago. But where is the spirit of
[43:47] God?
[43:51] Oh
[43:53] God, where is the spirit of God in it? I
[43:57] see the spirit of Hollywood. I see the
[43:59] spirit of the world. I see the spirit of
[44:02] glamour go right to you. I've been 15
[44:04] years preaching against it and it's it
[44:05] worsen all
[44:07] around. I can see
[44:09] it and I can see the spirit there. But
[44:12] where is the spirit of God that can
[44:14] grasp God
[44:17] that can recognize the word itself when
[44:19] it's made manifest?
[44:22] Can recognize truth. Only the spirit of
[44:24] God can do that. That's right.
[44:28] You can take glitter, polish,
[44:33] showmanship. Samson had just as big a
[44:35] body as he ever had, but his strength
[44:38] was taken from him. The church,
[44:40] Pentecost today stands, I believe three
[44:43] years ago, the Sunday visitor of the
[44:45] Catholic Church said that the they had a
[44:48] million conversions to Catholicism in
[44:50] one year, but the Pentecostal church had
[44:55] 1,500,000. Amen. more there. Well, what
[44:58] have you got when you got it, child? I'd
[45:01] rather have five that can surrender
[45:04] their life to Christ. He can do more
[45:05] with five men or one man surrendered
[45:08] than he could with 40 million outside.
[45:13] What does members need? just means
[45:16] another thing that you're blinded and
[45:18] adding more strength to the
[45:21] harlot.
[45:23] Right?
[45:25] Notice the church today is not willing
[45:27] to pay the
[45:29] price. Samson prayed the right kind of a
[45:32] prayer.
[45:34] Lord, let me die with this enemy. Oh my.
[45:38] There you are. You don't want to die to
[45:41] your proud.
[45:43] You don't want to die through the things
[45:46] of the world.
[45:48] I remember I'm talking to literally
[45:50] thousands around the world when I'm
[45:51] saying this.
[45:53] And it's not speaking here in Chicago.
[45:55] I'm speaking at the
[45:56] world. You don't want to
[45:59] die. But the only way that there's a
[46:02] possibility of a
[46:03] revival, you blinded Samson. Can't you
[46:07] see that the Delilah has blinded your
[46:10] eyes? And the only way that you'll ever
[46:13] be able to bring back the strength to
[46:15] the church is to die to the enemy that's
[46:18] got you in this worldly.
[46:20] Samson said, "Let me die with the
[46:22] enemy." There's a great price to
[46:25] pay. You must die to the thing that's
[46:28] brought you in this thing. You must die
[46:32] to the thing that's brought you, you
[46:34] Pentecostal people, to where you are
[46:35] this afternoon. You've got to die to it.
[46:39] Amen.
[46:40] Samson was willing to pay the price to
[46:43] get the power of God back in his life
[46:45] again. I wonder if the church is this
[46:48] afternoon willing to pay the price and
[46:52] die with the enemy to think all your
[46:54] popularity and all your this that just
[46:56] to see the power of God back on you
[46:58] again and become a prisoner of Jesus
[47:00] Christ. Oh, I hear somebody say, "Oh,
[47:03] yes, we we're having revival, but it's
[47:05] denomination revival."
[47:08] The oneness wants to take all the
[47:10] threeness and make them all oneness. The
[47:12] threeness wants to take all the oneness
[47:14] and make them threeness. The church of
[47:16] God wants to take the church of God of
[47:18] prophecy. One wants to take the other
[47:20] making big. Don't you realize you're
[47:23] only catering to man.
[47:27] We are brethren.
[47:30] There's no denomination can separate the
[47:33] love of God. Amen.
[47:37] We are
[47:38] brethren. This will all men know you're
[47:40] my disciples when you have love one for
[47:42] the other. Say, why are you hollering
[47:44] about a man? Love is corrective. If love
[47:47] doesn't correct, then it's not love. You
[47:50] see your child out on the street and
[47:51] don't give him a little bit of posterior
[47:54] polarplasm stimulation. You're not a
[47:56] good dad. But a real mother or dad will
[47:59] turn him up and spank him.
[48:02] Let him know he's got to get out of that
[48:03] street or perish. Amen. That's genuine
[48:06] love. But you say, "Junior, dear, I
[48:09] don't know you. Maybe you shouldn't be
[48:11] out there at this time of day, the end
[48:13] time, when the cars are going pretty
[48:15] fast, all nonsense. You
[48:17] sissified preacher."
[48:20] Not the audacity to take God's word and
[48:22] call white, white, and black, black.
[48:26] Right, right, and wrong.
[48:28] That's right.
[48:30] But they do it. Yeah, we have revivals.
[48:33] All right. But look at your morals
[48:35] behind these revivals.
[48:38] Don't change them a bit.
[48:42] Getting farther from God into the world
[48:44] all the time.
[48:47] Notice Samson knew what was going to
[48:50] happen if his prayer was
[48:52] answered. But we haven't counted the
[48:54] cost yet. What's going to happen if God
[48:58] answers your prayer to become a real
[49:00] genuine child of God? You know you're
[49:03] gone from your denomination right then
[49:07] and them women that you play bridge with
[49:09] and everything. Oh no, you're gone.
[49:12] That's all. Better count it up first.
[49:15] But Samson said, "Let me
[49:18] die." He was willing to pay the
[49:21] price. And he knew, listen close now to
[49:25] this remark. He knew that his present
[49:28] backslid condition could never meet the
[49:32] challenge of that
[49:33] hour. Yet he was just as much man as he
[49:36] ever was in his muscles. His frame was
[49:39] as big as it ever
[49:41] was. He was just as big a muscle that
[49:43] ever could raise up on his arm at any
[49:45] time. Is probably larger because they've
[49:47] been grinding down in the doing heavier
[49:50] work. We got better churches, better
[49:53] buildings, and everything. But where is
[49:56] our strength spiritually
[49:58] speaking? Oh, we could take a boat in a
[50:00] nation. Sure, we could do these things,
[50:03] but that that ain't what I'm talking
[50:04] about. I'm talking about the presence of
[50:06] God being recognized among us. That's
[50:08] what we are to live for. He knew that
[50:11] his backsliden
[50:14] condition could not meet the challenge
[50:16] of that
[50:19] hour. And so does a church know it now.
[50:23] We can't do it under this condition. You
[50:26] can't do
[50:27] [Music]
[50:28] it. Denominations does not vindicate the
[50:32] word. It denies the word.
[50:35] The very denomination itself denies the
[50:39] word as soon as it's denominated.
[50:44] Just the thing itself, you just get on
[50:45] the other side to begin with. It denies
[50:49] a word.
[50:52] All the time I've just a little minute
[50:56] or two longer, but notice as I hurry now
[51:00] to keep my
[51:01] word. All the times while they were all
[51:04] standing there and these thoughts was
[51:05] going through their mind, I hope it
[51:07] sends some to
[51:09] yours. They never noticed while Samson
[51:12] his thoughts went through his mind.
[51:13] Maybe they passed the bottle and took a
[51:15] drink again. They're fine. Hollywood
[51:17] women stood there with their cigarette
[51:19] in their mouth or if it was such a thing
[51:20] in that day. I don't think they got
[51:22] quite that low in that
[51:23] day, but pushed up their hair, took
[51:28] another drink, hollered, "Hello, Joseph
[51:31] or John, are you up there somewhere? We
[51:33] played cards together last night." Was
[51:35] at a big
[51:38] party. There's a possibility that God
[51:40] will hear me. There's a possibility. And
[51:43] while he thought the Philistines had not
[51:46] noticed him, while this little boy had
[51:48] untied his
[51:50] hands, walked back, he said, "Lay my
[51:53] hands up on the
[51:55] post. There's a possibility." Oh
[52:01] my, I wish the church could see
[52:05] that there is a
[52:07] possibility of a real revival.
[52:12] What did he do? He raised up his
[52:15] sockets. He had no arms towards God.
[52:19] They never noticed the moving of his
[52:21] lips as he was sincerely confessing. We
[52:24] don't need just a little Lord forgive me
[52:26] and Jim, Joe, and all of us. Amen. We
[52:29] need a sincere cleaning up from the pull
[52:32] pit to the janitor.
[52:36] They never noticed the tears running
[52:38] down from them sockets where he once had
[52:40] eyes.
[52:42] They never noticed the moving of his
[52:47] lips. His eyes briny tears streaming
[52:50] down from the sockets.
[52:53] He wanted God to make his word once more
[52:57] vindicated
[52:58] to prove as I'd say to this Delilah
[53:01] today or this Samson rather, Jesus
[53:04] Christ the same yesterday, today and
[53:05] forever.
[53:08] Once more he thought it would
[53:10] happen. Not a new denomination, not a
[53:14] new
[53:15] sectarian, but a vindicated word from
[53:17] you, God. I know you're still God. I'm
[53:22] blind. I've got off the track. I'm not
[53:24] worthy to live. Let me die with this
[53:26] enemy. You raised me up to destroy it.
[53:28] And I failed you, Lord. But there's a
[53:30] possibility. You hear me? Once more,
[53:32] Lord. Once
[53:35] [Music]
[53:37] more. Dead earnest. He prayed. He knew
[53:41] what was coming. Lord, just this once
[53:46] more. Once more, let me see Jesus Christ
[53:49] as he was yesterday.
[53:52] When he prayed that prayer, the tears
[53:55] rolling from his cheeks with deep
[53:57] sincerity of confession. That's what the
[53:59] church needs.
[54:02] Confess your wrongs. Don't care what Dr.
[54:05] Jones says or what anybody else says.
[54:08] You're out of the word of God. Confess
[54:10] it that you're wrong.
[54:13] Cry out once more, Lord. Once more.
[54:18] Once more, Lord. once more. Hallelujah.
[54:22] Avenge my blindness upon these
[54:24] denominations of give me strength Lord
[54:27] to shake this denominational world.
[54:29] Hallelujah. With your vindication. Amen.
[54:32] Give me strength, Lord. Once more
[54:37] proven. He knew what was going to happen
[54:40] if his prayer was answered. He knew.
[54:43] Dead earnest crying once more, Lord. And
[54:47] while he was praying and making his
[54:49] honest confession, every fiber in his
[54:52] body begin to vibrate.
[54:56] Oh God, if the body of Jesus Christ
[54:59] could stand as one and every fiber and
[55:02] every member begin to vibrate with the
[55:04] literal baptism of the Holy Ghost
[55:07] together. Hallelujah. Not with new
[55:09] members and shaking hands and some
[55:11] creed. As the strength began to move
[55:13] into those big muscles, every fiber be
[55:16] to twist. He be to feel himself again.
[55:19] And he twisted
[55:21] out. When he did, the big wall
[55:25] fell. All we knew to do today is to see
[55:28] these denominational walls fall is get
[55:31] deeply sincere before God to heal these
[55:34] blinded eyes that's been blinded from
[55:36] the word of
[55:38] God. That was Samson's greatest victory
[55:41] he ever had. because he was willing to
[55:43] confess over every enemy first that he
[55:48] was brought up to destroy. Oh Pentecost,
[55:52] stand at your post this afternoon. Your
[55:54] post of the duty of God's word. Repent
[55:58] and cry out, Lord God. Once
[56:02] more, let me tell you something. You
[56:05] better destroy your enemy before your
[56:07] enemy destroys you.
[56:10] Right. Bring back the oldfashioned
[56:12] prayer meetings, the real godly
[56:15] repentance, the allnight altar service.
[56:20] Oh,
[56:23] Pentecost. Hear me. Leave. Oh, leave
[56:27] this corruption
[56:31] that
[56:32] Jezebel has worked among you. Leave it.
[56:35] Leave it quickly and return back to the
[56:38] word of the Lord. Away from this
[56:41] Hollywood
[56:42] showmanship. Turn with your whole heart
[56:45] back to the word of God. Turn back to
[56:48] the power of the Holy Ghost. You women
[56:51] dress like women. You men act like man,
[56:54] like sons and daughters of God. Turn,
[56:57] old, turn from this Jezebel system
[57:00] that's choking you and blind in you.
[57:04] God, help us to have a true repentance.
[57:08] Not halfheartedly. You can't do it.
[57:12] I think today at this very moment when
[57:16] my time is up, we should stand to our
[57:19] feet and cry with our hands in the air,
[57:23] "Lord, once more. Once more. Oh, Lord,
[57:28] once more." Let's stand. Everybody
[57:30] that's willing to do it to see a revival
[57:32] that's ready to die to this Hollywood
[57:35] showmanship. Everybody that's ready to
[57:37] die to see the power of God come design
[57:40] with joy. All these holy mountains never
[57:44] heard shall destroy. Let's raise our
[57:46] hands and cry once more Lord. Once more
[57:50] Lord once more Lord. Once more, Lord,
[57:55] send the Holy Ghost with
[57:59] Russian.
[58:18] Amen. Once more, Lord. Once more.
[58:23] If your children humble themselves and
[58:24] repent, you just want to do everything
[58:26] for them. So tonight, I just ask him
[58:29] once more, Lord. We'll bring our
[58:30] requests to them. And we sang only
[58:33] believe. We
[58:35] sang I believe. Let's sing Jesus is
[58:38] here. Now before we take their
[58:41] requests,
[58:44] Jesus is
[58:47] here.
[58:49] Jesus is here.
[58:53] Here all things are
[58:59] possible.
[59:01] Jesus is
[59:04] here.
[59:06] Jesus is
[59:10] here.
[59:12] Jesus is
[59:15] here and all things are possible.
[59:23] Jesus is
[59:26] here. Yes. Once more. Lord, we believe I
[59:30] made a mistake today. Lord, forgive me.
[59:34] We're not looking at ourselves. How
[59:36] we've performed today or what we've done
[59:38] or didn't do. But when that person
[59:41] brought that lamb up to the priest, the
[59:44] priest didn't look at the person. He
[59:46] looked at the lamb. And was it without
[59:47] blemish? Do we have a perfect lamb
[59:50] tonight? Saint slain from the foundation
[59:53] of the world. And just put all our hope
[59:55] and trust in him tonight. Looking
[59:58] forward to him moving in our lives in
[1:00:01] each heart. We'll mention these that we
[1:00:02] know of and give you a chance to mention
[1:00:05] those needs that you might
[1:00:07] have. So thankful for a perfect word
[1:00:10] tonight and for the precision of the
[1:00:12] word. You know, in Revelations 10:7, it
[1:00:14] doesn't say in the days of the seventh
[1:00:15] angel. It says in the days of the what
[1:00:19] is it? The voice. And so we've heard
[1:00:21] that voice. We recognize it. We're
[1:00:23] thankful for it tonight. There's been a
[1:00:25] couple of people mention request prayer,
[1:00:28] urgent prayer to please pray for brother
[1:00:30] Jim
[1:00:31] Alexander. He had a brain surgery for a
[1:00:35] blood clot. Gave him a stroke. He's in
[1:00:37] the hospital. He's a deacon at Landmark
[1:00:39] Church in Mesa. So we certainly want to
[1:00:41] uphold
[1:00:43] this believer, this friend of the
[1:00:46] Galantes and different
[1:00:48] ones. Continue to hold hold up our
[1:00:50] precious sister
[1:00:52] Lori. She's come a mighty long way here
[1:00:55] in the last week or 10 days, but her
[1:00:58] legs are bothering her. They're she's
[1:01:00] only able to move her toes a little bit
[1:01:02] at the moment. We just don't accept that
[1:01:04] that tonight. That devil trying to
[1:01:06] hinder her recovery. I mean, we just
[1:01:08] believe for a complete recovery for our
[1:01:09] precious sister there in Seattle and
[1:01:12] going through this battle and for our
[1:01:14] precious brother Randy here and he's had
[1:01:17] a a nice surgery and has some things to
[1:01:21] go through and all the decisions the
[1:01:22] family. So, we sure hold up our precious
[1:01:25] sister Lorie Snow and the
[1:01:27] family. I know there's a number missing
[1:01:29] tonight. We missed the I won't don't
[1:01:32] want to mention too many names. we'll
[1:01:34] miss some, but our precious sister
[1:01:35] Ellie, we've been praying for her. Our
[1:01:37] elder in the faith should love to be
[1:01:38] here. Also struggling with health
[1:01:41] issues, so remember her. Uh, brother
[1:01:43] Chuck, Sister Barb,
[1:01:46] um, of course, the Moors as they make
[1:01:47] preparations. We miss them. And it's
[1:01:50] going to take a few of us to make up
[1:01:52] that amen corner, Brother John. So
[1:01:54] remember, Brother George, Sister Brandy,
[1:01:57] Eden, and the
[1:02:01] family. Of course, we want to remember
[1:02:03] brother Israel and his journey there.
[1:02:06] Quite a bit of preaching to do yet and
[1:02:09] journeys and travels and coming back
[1:02:11] next week. So, I want to uphold him in
[1:02:12] prayer. I think he posted some pictures
[1:02:14] and testimonies and things to the
[1:02:16] WhatsApp. If you're not part of that, we
[1:02:17] we can get you part of that. So, just be
[1:02:20] in prayer for brother Israel. What have
[1:02:22] we missed or what would you like to to
[1:02:24] bring to the saints out loud? Is there
[1:02:26] something that should be mentioned? M
[1:02:28] brother
[1:02:29] Vic, were you going to say something
[1:02:31] there?
[1:02:32] No. Is there something else? Yes,
[1:02:35] brother.
[1:02:40] Will. Yes. We'll remember Aunt Wanda
[1:02:43] Scales. We've been praying for her. Yes.
[1:02:48] Angel. Okay. So, has Josephina Valdez,
[1:02:52] we remember other Angel's mom tonight.
[1:02:56] Is there something else that you'd like
[1:02:57] to bring before the church?
[1:03:00] [Music]
[1:03:02] How about something on your heart? Maybe
[1:03:03] a family member, a a work situation, a
[1:03:06] physical, a healing. Let's bring that to
[1:03:08] the Lord in faith. Believing
[1:03:11] tonight, all things are possible because
[1:03:14] we believe.
[1:03:16] Lord, I
[1:03:19] believe.
[1:03:21] Lord, I believe.
[1:03:26] All things are
[1:03:30] possible. Lord, I
[1:03:36] believe.
[1:03:38] Lord, I
[1:03:41] believe.
[1:03:43] Lord, I
[1:03:47] believe. All things are possible.
[1:03:54] Lord, I
[1:03:59] believe. Amen. Let's be reverent. Be in
[1:04:01] prayer for the next 20 or so minutes as
[1:04:04] we remember these needs. Make yourself
[1:04:06] comfortable. The altar is open and we'll
[1:04:08] pray and then we'll sing before we
[1:04:11] dismiss. God bless you.
