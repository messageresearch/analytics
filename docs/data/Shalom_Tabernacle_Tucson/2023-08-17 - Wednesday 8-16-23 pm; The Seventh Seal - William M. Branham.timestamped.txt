[23:30] the Lord this evening
[23:32] we have a portion of the tape that we
[23:35] like to play in the seventh seal before
[23:38] we do I have a few things I'd like to
[23:40] say
[23:40] to bring up
[23:44] to
[23:46] what brother random is going to say in
[23:47] that seven seal a few notes that I have
[23:50] kind of tying in from Sunday morning
[23:52] service last week Sunday and we
[23:55] certainly enjoyed the service Sunday
[23:57] night hey man how many Joy brother Bob
[24:00] it was very nice we enjoy that
[24:02] just a bit of announcements
[24:05] um he's having his special meetings
[24:08] coming up in September the Labor Day
[24:11] weekend and it's a Friday Saturday and
[24:14] Sunday and he's invited myself and
[24:17] brother George to be the speaker and a
[24:20] brother
[24:21] brother from California I believe
[24:23] brother
[24:25] um Ronnie slavens
[24:27] will be the speakers and so that'd be
[24:29] nice if some of the Saints are able to
[24:31] go there
[24:32] we're gonna
[24:34] me and George are going to fight over on
[24:35] Friday or Saturday we service to take no
[24:39] no but it'd be nice if the Saints can go
[24:42] and be a part of that to support
[24:44] those meetings and that's the Labor Day
[24:47] weekend we'll get the announcement we'll
[24:49] put it on the board for you also this
[24:51] Sunday night we will be observing a Fort
[24:54] Washington communion we have put it off
[24:56] for this month for various reasons we
[25:00] haven't been able to but we'll do that
[25:01] this Sunday night the Lord willing
[25:06] and also there is
[25:10] a um just a
[25:12] way of uh announcement to you all that
[25:15] there is kind of what's developing in
[25:18] the Phoenix area with our brother art as
[25:21] you know he served as a deacon here for
[25:24] five and a half years he traveled
[25:27] every Sunday and pretty much every
[25:29] Wednesday I get off of work and you come
[25:32] here and he served and then his work
[25:35] changed the way it did and so he had to
[25:39] um
[25:41] stream from home there and he would
[25:45] still be I mean we've brother we all
[25:48] love Brother Art and he's been very
[25:50] faithful sister Annabelle and the girls
[25:52] they've and like I say I just really
[25:54] felt I prayed for them I've
[25:57] tried to get a answer for them and I
[26:01] thought the Lord would get them uh the
[26:04] the finance or the stuff that they
[26:06] needed so they can continue to be a part
[26:10] of the church here and it just didn't
[26:11] work out and
[26:13] um and so he would stream from his home
[26:16] and at the same time brother Roland
[26:20] McGraw had been asking us to come to be
[26:23] a part there and to help him out and
[26:25] sober the art would go there and brother
[26:27] Ezekiel
[26:28] and a couple others that go there to be
[26:30] a part
[26:31] of that service there but he still
[26:33] hadn't found his way and so instead of
[26:36] streaming from home he is able to stream
[26:39] from a hotel it's still a part of our
[26:44] our work here he's streaming the service
[26:46] now and I just wanted to
[26:49] um
[26:51] I wanted them to
[26:54] let Brother Art know how much we
[26:56] appreciate him and love him and
[26:59] um I know it's quite a sacrifice and I
[27:01] know that there could be a fear or
[27:03] concern as to is that another church
[27:06] that we're starting
[27:08] if it wasn't for Brother Art and the
[27:10] commitment I have for him we probably
[27:12] wouldn't
[27:14] maybe go that direction but
[27:16] because of
[27:18] the way things are as it stands that's
[27:23] what we are doing our last the first
[27:25] service I think was two Sundays ago they
[27:27] streamed together at the hotel just a
[27:30] couple families and so you be in prayer
[27:33] for for that amen
[27:36] Iraq thank you brother Chris
[27:40] and so
[27:42] um
[27:44] there's a fine gentleman that's in the
[27:47] city in Arizona his uh brother is a
[27:50] pastor in Lagos Nigeria for the delay I
[27:54] know him very well his Junior brother is
[27:56] here for the first time he's in Phoenix
[27:58] tonight and he'll be speaking to that
[28:01] little group there
[28:03] in Phoenix and then Friday he will be
[28:06] with Armando Rivera and then he'll be in
[28:09] Tucson I'm not sure where he'll be
[28:11] um for Tucson but the Lord willing we
[28:13] might be able to meet him on Sunday
[28:15] night the church here so you'll be a
[28:17] prayer prayer with him uh forget his
[28:20] first name I think it's femi and so
[28:22] we'll keep that in prayer amen can I get
[28:25] the lapel mic please if it's ready
[28:28] brother
[28:31] thank you
[28:33] so let's go right into the word before
[28:36] we go into this portion of the tape that
[28:38] I'd like to play for you
[28:40] and the portion of scripture we want to
[28:43] read is found in Revelations chapter 8.
[28:47] if you would stand with me
[28:49] and turn with me for the reading of the
[28:51] word
[28:57] now how many is glad to be here
[28:59] amen we certainly
[29:03] always counted a privilege to be found
[29:05] in the house of the Lord we'd like to
[29:07] welcome each of you
[29:08] and we pray that the Lord Jesus Christ
[29:10] will bless you
[29:13] Revelations chapter 8 verse
[29:16] number one
[29:24] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[29:26] there was silence in heaven about the
[29:30] space of half an hour let us pray Lord
[29:34] Jesus we ask your blessings upon this
[29:38] service tonight
[29:39] may you bless each Heart Lord that's
[29:42] gathered
[29:43] and may you father take full control
[29:46] over all that we would say or do
[29:49] move away the unbelief and may our
[29:52] hearts be settled in on your word
[29:54] tonight
[29:56] give us what we have need of I pray we
[29:58] ask in Jesus name amen God bless you may
[30:02] be seated as you're being seated get
[30:05] turned into Saint John chapter 6. thank
[30:08] you musicians
[30:11] the scripture in Saint John chapter 6 is
[30:14] what we read on Sunday morning
[30:18] it was two days that our lord Jesus was
[30:22] ministering to the people we see the
[30:24] great miracle of the Loaves and Fishes
[30:26] thank you brother
[30:30] Roger switch over here
[30:35] and we see at the beginning of
[30:39] his
[30:41] great miracle signs and wonders a great
[30:44] crowd was gathered I'd like to turn
[30:47] into the verse we read it on Sunday and
[30:51] Jesus answered them have I uh on Sunday
[30:54] he says will you also go away
[30:58] now
[31:00] our lord Jesus as we brought it to you
[31:03] the three pulls in Revelations 8 1 that
[31:07] there was silence in heaven and we read
[31:09] those quotes for you or we read a quote
[31:13] for you in the seventh seal where
[31:15] brother random said that was
[31:17] he said that that silence was that so
[31:21] that Satan wouldn't know what the great
[31:24] mystery or the great secret was
[31:27] and we know that there's mysteries in
[31:30] the word
[31:31] that if it's common knowledge is not a
[31:34] mystery a mystery is something you don't
[31:36] know it has to be revealed
[31:39] and the revelation of the Seven Seals
[31:41] was a great mystery of the Bible down
[31:46] Through the Ages that had to be revealed
[31:48] through the seventh angel messenger in
[31:51] this last day and we share with you our
[31:54] brother around his ministry composed of
[31:55] the three pools first pool second pool
[31:58] third pool
[31:59] we read in Saint John 6 and showed in
[32:02] the scripture that Jesus had the same
[32:05] that that was his ministry first a great
[32:09] crowd of people came
[32:11] because of the signs wonders and
[32:13] miracles they were attracted to it and
[32:16] and then as he got deeper into the word
[32:20] the words begin to offend him
[32:23] and now
[32:25] brother Branham tells us and he preaches
[32:27] a message entitled three kinds of
[32:29] believers
[32:31] amen
[32:33] y'all praying with me or no
[32:35] all right and these three kinds of
[32:38] Believers are believers
[32:41] unbelievers and make-believers and we
[32:44] can see those three kinds of Believers
[32:46] identified in just that one chapter
[32:49] Saint John chapter 6.
[32:52] in in Saint John chapter 6 we'll see the
[32:58] Believers
[33:00] they take the word no matter what Jesus
[33:03] says it it isn't a question of
[33:07] understanding what he said it was just
[33:10] that he said it
[33:12] and so you make it work you reconcile it
[33:15] he'll bring the understanding later
[33:18] but then there's a group of people they
[33:20] want to follow Jesus and the great crowd
[33:24] remember the the first pool we'll call
[33:27] it signs wonders and miracles attracted
[33:31] everybody
[33:32] everyone was attracted to that a great
[33:34] large group of people unbelievers make
[33:38] Believers and True Believers but the
[33:41] only way that he could separate who was
[33:43] true believers
[33:45] signs wonders and miracles will never do
[33:48] that the way we separate whether you're
[33:51] a True Believer or not is through the
[33:53] hard sayings
[33:54] and there's hard sayings in the Bible
[33:56] there's hard sayings in the message
[33:59] there are areas that God will say things
[34:02] that you simply can't understand
[34:04] scientifically it won't under you can't
[34:07] make it uh come together even
[34:10] scripturally maybe but he said it
[34:13] and if Jesus said it it it matters who's
[34:18] speaking if if Jesus said it then that's
[34:21] the most important thing to understand
[34:24] who is speaking remember the disciples
[34:28] didn't know what he was talking about
[34:30] either Eat My Flesh and drink my blood
[34:33] and Jesus could have made a lot of
[34:35] statements why would he pick that
[34:37] statement that terminology except you
[34:40] eat my flesh and drink my blood he could
[34:42] have said except you receive my words
[34:44] and Believe on me that's not what he
[34:47] said he said except you eat my flesh
[34:50] totally contrary to Moses except you
[34:53] drink my blood totally contrary to Moses
[34:56] you have no life in you and then he goes
[34:58] further and says that before Abraham was
[35:01] I am
[35:03] and I was the bread that came down in
[35:05] the wilderness and all the while this is
[35:08] stumbling the people it's shaking I'm
[35:10] stumbling everybody's being stumbled the
[35:13] disciples are being stumbled the
[35:15] unbelievers being shaken and the
[35:18] make-believer they're all being shaken
[35:20] this is why we see in the beginning a
[35:23] large crowd and then as he began to
[35:26] teach they walked away from him
[35:29] and as they walked away from him it
[35:32] shifted the crowd it shifted the
[35:34] Dynamics of who the followers were and
[35:38] that's why he asked the question will
[35:40] you also go away
[35:42] now
[35:44] these hard sayings are necessary
[35:47] the hard sayings are like
[35:50] Lord don't say that when I'm inviting
[35:54] somebody to church for the first time
[35:56] like Lord Don't Preach on that like this
[35:59] I'm just get I just convinced this girl
[36:02] or this guy to come to church for the
[36:04] first time and you're gonna preach on
[36:07] that
[36:08] this is what I mean by the hard sayings
[36:11] they're in there there areas in the word
[36:14] that is it's hard for a carnal man to
[36:17] comprehend how many know what I'm
[36:20] talking about your heart sayings might
[36:22] not be mine but we we all come across
[36:24] these hard sayings and they're there on
[36:27] purpose they are necessary they must be
[36:31] there if they're not there you won't
[36:34] know who a True Believer is
[36:36] you won't know who What Judas is you
[36:39] won't even know who a real friend is
[36:41] until a hard saying comes along and so
[36:45] here we see the unbelievers in Saint
[36:48] John 6 64 and verse 66. I'll take 10 15
[36:52] minutes and it will go right to this
[36:54] portion of the tape
[36:56] Jesus speaking he said but there are
[36:58] some of you that believe not
[37:01] for Jesus knew from the beginning who
[37:04] they were that believed not and who
[37:07] should betray him and he said therefore
[37:10] said I unto you that no man can come
[37:12] unto me except it were given unto him of
[37:15] my father from that time many of his
[37:19] disciples went back and walked no more
[37:23] with him so here it is
[37:27] you're following him because of because
[37:30] of something these a disciple is a
[37:33] follower of Christ and these were
[37:35] Disciples of Jesus
[37:37] and Jesus begins to make these
[37:39] statements these are not Pharisees and
[37:42] Sadducees these are disciples these are
[37:45] people that are followers of the work of
[37:48] the movement and he starts making these
[37:51] statements now and many of his disciples
[37:55] decided not to follow anymore so what
[37:59] were they following for in the first
[38:01] place
[38:03] was it just the Miracles
[38:06] was it just the signs and was it the
[38:08] excitement of it
[38:10] and if I were to ask you the first the
[38:13] second and the third pool a Ministry to
[38:17] see that on display
[38:19] uh probably the first two Ministries
[38:22] would be the most exciting for human
[38:25] beings because this is what draws the
[38:28] biggest crowd is the first of the second
[38:30] pool
[38:32] the third pool which encompasses the
[38:35] signs wonders and miracles but it
[38:38] encompasses the hard sayings
[38:41] the visions that we can't explain
[38:44] the statements that seem very very hard
[38:49] to reconcile is he saying that he's the
[38:52] one or is he the only one or what is he
[38:55] saying here how can we make this but let
[38:57] me let me say this here if if the word
[39:01] of God is true and you're a True
[39:03] Believer there is no statement that
[39:07] Jesus can make that will cause you to
[39:10] turn back
[39:12] if your true son because you're not
[39:15] following based on your understanding of
[39:18] what he's saying you're following him
[39:21] because it was revealed to you who he is
[39:25] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[39:28] Living God who do men say I am who do
[39:30] they say I am him some say you John some
[39:33] say you're this but who do you say I am
[39:35] says he he looked he looked beyond the
[39:38] veil of the little man there to
[39:40] Carpenter son he looked behind all of
[39:42] the bad name of him being an
[39:44] illegitimate child he looked beyond all
[39:46] of that he says Thou Art the Christ when
[39:49] Peter calls this man the Christ
[39:52] there is no other man that he could have
[39:55] called that
[39:57] he's calling him God in flesh
[40:01] the Messiah the the one that we have
[40:04] longed and looked for and Peter got the
[40:06] Revelation and when he got it Jesus said
[40:09] nobody taught you that
[40:11] yeah you didn't learn that in Sunday
[40:13] School
[40:15] said but my Father in Heaven came down
[40:19] and revealed that to you Peter and upon
[40:24] this kind of stuff this material is how
[40:27] I'm going to build my church so the
[40:29] church is built upon the hard savings
[40:33] being opened up and you can see who's
[40:36] speaking amen all right so now that is
[40:41] the unbeliever look at the make-believer
[40:43] in Saint John 6 67 verse 70. so we
[40:47] already see a group that walked away
[40:49] from him there were no more with him
[40:52] verse 67 then said Jesus unto the twelve
[40:54] will you also go away Jesus answered
[40:58] them have not I chosen you twelve
[41:01] and one of you is a devil
[41:04] so he leaves a great multitude
[41:09] dwindles it down to the 70 that leave
[41:12] him
[41:13] and he's left with just 12 in even
[41:16] amongst just the 12 one of you guys are
[41:20] a devil
[41:23] and
[41:30] first John 2 18 says this little
[41:33] children it is the last time as you have
[41:35] heard that the Antichrist shall come
[41:37] even now are there many antichrists
[41:40] whereby we know that is the last time
[41:42] they went out from us but they were not
[41:45] of us for if they had been of us they
[41:49] would no doubt have continued with us
[41:52] but they went out that they might be
[41:54] made manifest that they were not all of
[42:00] us that's what your Bible says talking
[42:03] about the Antichrist they left
[42:07] they were with us and then they left us
[42:10] and they left us prove that they were
[42:13] never really with us
[42:16] the the scriptures go on to say this
[42:20] here let me read this for you here
[42:26] actually I'm going to take
[42:29] maybe I'll take a quotation for you
[42:36] and I'll I'll read some more some more
[42:38] scripture all right
[42:40] second Corinthians chapter
[42:44] 10 verses 1 through 11.
[42:47] amen don't you love the Lord
[42:50] is it more of a brethren
[42:52] I would not that you should be ignorant
[42:54] how did all of our fathers were under
[42:57] the cloud and all passed through the sea
[43:00] and we're all baptized unto Moses
[43:05] in the cloud and in the sea and did all
[43:08] eat the same spiritual meat they'll all
[43:10] drink the same spiritual drink for the
[43:13] drink of that spiritual rock that
[43:14] followed them and that rock was Christ
[43:16] but with many of them God was not well
[43:19] pleased for they were overthrown in the
[43:22] wilderness now these things were are
[43:25] what
[43:27] there are one
[43:30] examples to the intent we should not
[43:32] lust after evil things as they also
[43:34] lusted neither be idolaters as for some
[43:38] of them as it is written the people sat
[43:40] down to eat and drink and Rose up to
[43:42] play
[43:43] neither let us commit fornication as
[43:45] some of them committed and failing one
[43:47] day three and twenty thousand
[43:49] neither let us tempt Christ as some of
[43:52] them also tempted and were destroyed of
[43:54] serpents neither remember ye as some of
[43:58] them also murmured and were destroyed of
[44:00] the Destroyer
[44:02] now all these things happen unto them
[44:04] for what
[44:06] and samples or examples and they are
[44:10] written for our admonition upon whom the
[44:15] ends of the world are come second
[44:17] Corinthians 11 verses 13 and 15 says
[44:23] this for such are false Apostles
[44:26] deceitful workers transforming
[44:29] themselves into the Apostles of Christ
[44:31] and no Marvel for Satan himself is
[44:34] transformed into an angel of Light
[44:36] therefore it is no great thing if his
[44:41] who
[44:43] ministers whose ministers
[44:46] Satan's ministers
[44:48] also be transferred transformed as The
[44:53] Minister's of righteousness whose end
[44:56] shall be according to their works now we
[44:59] didn't see who Judas was the disciples
[45:02] didn't know exactly who he was because
[45:06] the Antichrist Spirit hides very well
[45:09] and it it lingers around looking for a
[45:14] loophole
[45:15] and it is it is a spirit
[45:18] and if you if you come in contact with
[45:21] the Antichrist spirit it's not just a
[45:24] person it's a spirit that we're talking
[45:26] about that wants to find a loophole or
[45:29] someplace to to come against the hard
[45:33] sayings to come against the words of our
[45:37] Lord Jesus but that all happened for our
[45:40] example
[45:41] and this
[45:43] um
[45:44] great pool of promise I call it it is
[45:48] also a pool of problem problems
[45:53] I call it the problem pool because this
[45:56] is where many of the problems come with
[45:59] the brethren
[46:01] the problems don't come under the signs
[46:03] wonders and miracles that come under the
[46:06] hard sayings
[46:08] the heart sayings are the words that
[46:11] Jesus intentionally says or puts in
[46:15] there to sift out the make-believer and
[46:19] the unbeliever
[46:20] now brother random says this here
[46:26] about these hard sayings
[46:30] he says this here right
[46:38] all right
[46:40] let's see here if I can get this for you
[46:50] and the three kinds of believer
[46:55] he says this here in paragraph 267 267.
[46:59] remember
[47:00] and all ages has been as it is right now
[47:05] so brother random is now bringing all
[47:08] the ages into what's going on and what's
[47:10] taking place now what is now now is now
[47:13] present tense you look in the past
[47:16] you'll see those Spirits back there for
[47:19] an example to what's going on now
[47:21] there's nothing new Under the Sun the
[47:24] way we can know how to stand is we look
[47:26] how we we stood back there and then we
[47:29] know how to address what's going on
[47:30] right now because it's a spirit take
[47:33] names and faces off of it and just look
[47:36] at what is trying to accomplish then you
[47:39] can identify what kind of spirit it is
[47:41] and it says he says this here in three
[47:43] kinds of believer remember in all ages
[47:46] has been as it is right now
[47:48] there is always a popular belief among
[47:52] the people
[47:53] and it's always been just a little bit
[47:56] contrary to the real word
[48:00] remember it's never been just a ride out
[48:05] deny it oh no the Antichrist don't deny
[48:10] the word certainly not he says he
[48:14] believes it
[48:15] but just not all of it the way it's
[48:19] wrote here
[48:20] see
[48:21] now let's let's go over these three
[48:23] pools just for a moment what's the first
[48:25] pull was healing what was the second
[48:28] pull discernment and what was the third
[48:31] pool the revealing of the word and
[48:35] there's no higher order to reveal the
[48:39] word than a prophet so you can't preach
[48:42] a third pool without a prophet because a
[48:47] prophet reveals
[48:49] what Revelations 8 1 says what was the
[48:52] hour of this half an hour of Silence
[48:55] what does that mean what was that all
[48:58] right
[49:00] so I'm gonna close here
[49:02] and this is where brother random is
[49:04] going to end up on this portion of the
[49:06] tape I want to play for you just for a
[49:08] moment here it's in the revelation of
[49:10] the seven seal
[49:12] I want to take paragraph number
[49:16] 324 and that's actually we're gonna
[49:18] listen to paragraph 238 to 324
[49:22] and you're going to see that this third
[49:24] pool
[49:26] is not a haphazard subject as we said
[49:29] Sunday morning it has a big range a long
[49:32] range it's actually almost nine years in
[49:35] the making
[49:36] this is given to brother Branham as a
[49:38] vision he saw a vision of a tent it was
[49:42] given as a vision of him fishing it was
[49:44] given a vision of a part of it was down
[49:47] in Mexico
[49:48] you see the healing you see there's so
[49:51] much in there and then as it developed
[49:53] he as he brings out the great Mysteries
[49:56] of the seven seal you'll see how it
[49:59] progressed so it's a there's a lot to it
[50:01] and then this quote in the seventh seal
[50:03] I want you to listen to it carefully and
[50:06] closely and these these mysteries on the
[50:09] seventh seal this book here on this
[50:11] revelation of the seven seal is not just
[50:13] for preachers it's not just for men this
[50:17] is for believers you picked this up and
[50:20] read it and pray God will bless you
[50:22] there's something in there for you now
[50:24] hear this now
[50:26] hear this
[50:28] in paragraph number three
[50:30] what did I call 324. let me read that
[50:33] for you here
[50:40] now some specifically bringing this for
[50:42] a purpose I felt it on my heart to bring
[50:45] it on Sunday and then this working this
[50:48] day this week yesterday and then today I
[50:52] really feel to bring this because the
[50:54] importance of it as I was studying it
[50:56] then I heard brother Randall say this in
[50:58] paragraph 324 he says this here but
[51:03] it's moving into that cycle see it's
[51:06] coming up close
[51:08] so the thing for you to do now this is
[51:12] the closing of the Seven Seals he
[51:14] preached one through six seals he
[51:16] preached a seven seal he brought all the
[51:18] background and he reads Revelations
[51:20] eight one that we read and he brings in
[51:23] all of his third pool and how it
[51:25] happened and then he kind of climaxes it
[51:28] with this in paragraph 324.
[51:30] it's moving into that cycle see it's
[51:32] coming up close so the thing for you to
[51:35] do is to remember that I speak to you in
[51:40] the name of the Lord
[51:43] be prepared for you don't know what time
[51:47] something can happen now
[51:52] I take that very personal
[51:54] that's uh that's a word to me amen
[51:58] that's a word to you how do you prepare
[52:02] will you prepare well the tools that God
[52:06] gave you to prepare with and that's his
[52:08] word all right God bless you
[52:11] let's hear this portion of the message
[52:13] if you're ready back there sis paragraph
[52:17] uh two 38
[52:20] to paragraph 324
[52:23] and brother Branham
[52:25] is going to give explanation I want you
[52:27] to just pay closer tissue God bless you
[52:32] notice the breaking of this seal was a
[52:36] great
[52:37] that heaven was hushed by it in silence
[52:41] for the space of a half hour
[52:45] ah is it great
[52:48] what is it
[52:50] it was hushed Heavens it was a thing
[52:53] moved
[52:55] for a half hour
[52:56] now if I belong if you're having a good
[52:59] time
[53:00] but in the suspense or between death and
[53:04] life it seemed like a millennium
[53:07] it was so great Jesus never mentioned it
[53:10] now the rest of them John couldn't even
[53:12] write of it no
[53:15] he is the forbidden right here see
[53:16] there's just a just didn't write this is
[53:19] silence and the Four and Twenty Elders
[53:23] that stood before God they're harping
[53:26] with their Harps they quit playing their
[53:28] harps
[53:30] the Angels hush their singing
[53:34] in heaven
[53:36] thank the holy cherubins and seraphants
[53:39] that Isaiah saw it in the temple with
[53:42] six sets or three sets of wings three or
[53:45] two over his face and two over his feet
[53:47] and flying and he's day and night there
[53:49] before God singing holy holy holy is the
[53:52] Lord God Almighty and even when he
[53:54] walked there come into the temple the
[53:56] post of the temple move with their their
[53:58] presence
[53:59] and these holy cellophans hushed up
[54:06] Angels quit singing
[54:13] lying in the presence of God saying holy
[54:15] holy holy they shut up
[54:18] no angels singing
[54:20] no Praises no no altar service no
[54:23] nothing
[54:24] there was silence hush deadly silence in
[54:28] heaven for a half hour
[54:29] all the hosts of Heaven Was silent for
[54:32] this half hour when the seven sealed
[54:34] mystery in the book of redemption was
[54:37] broke open
[54:41] think of it but it's broke amen
[54:45] the land breaks it
[54:48] you know what they were awed by it I
[54:50] mean
[54:52] they didn't know there it was they just
[54:55] stopped why what is it
[54:58] now
[55:01] none of us knuckles
[55:03] but I'm
[55:08] I'm going to tell him I can my
[55:10] revelation of it
[55:14] and uh
[55:16] I am not prone to be a fanatic if I am
[55:19] I'm ignorant of it
[55:22] I am I'm not giving away to uh such as
[55:27] uh
[55:28] Delirious uh carry-ons and imaginary
[55:32] things I said some things might have
[55:35] been kind of strange to some people but
[55:37] when God comes around behind in
[55:39] Vindication and says it's the truth then
[55:41] that's God's word they seem strange that
[55:44] way
[55:46] and now
[55:48] uh certain
[55:50] as I stand in the platform
[55:53] tonight
[55:56] I had the Revelation that revealed it's
[56:00] in a three-fold manner
[56:03] that I will speak to you by God's help
[56:06] of a fool of it
[56:08] and then you let's go to that first
[56:11] here's the Revelation to begin what I
[56:15] want to tell you what it is
[56:17] what happens is that those seven
[56:21] Thunders
[56:22] that he heard thunder and was forbidden
[56:26] to write
[56:27] that's what the mystery is Lay behind
[56:30] those seven consecutive Thunders rolling
[56:32] out
[56:35] now why let us prove it why it is the
[56:40] secret that no one knows about John was
[56:43] forbidding to write about it even even
[56:46] not a symbol about it wow
[56:49] that's why
[56:50] there was a no active activity in heaven
[56:54] it might give away the secret
[56:57] do you sit now amen if it's so great it
[57:02] must be included because it's got to
[57:04] happen but when the seven Thunders I
[57:07] noticed when the seven angels come forth
[57:09] the sound their trumpets there was one
[57:11] Thunder
[57:13] when Israel was gathered there was a
[57:15] trumpet
[57:16] when time shall be no more the last
[57:19] trumpet
[57:21] one Thunder
[57:23] but here is seven straight Thunders
[57:26] right in a row one two three four five
[57:28] six seven
[57:31] that perfect number
[57:33] seven thunders in a row
[57:36] uttered not lick it is just one two
[57:39] three four five six seven straight
[57:42] then
[57:44] Heavens couldn't write that
[57:46] Heavens can't know about it nothing else
[57:49] because there's nothing to go on it's
[57:51] relaxing time it was so great till it
[57:54] was Kept Secret from the angels
[57:57] now why if Satan should get a hold of it
[58:03] you might do great damage and that's one
[58:06] thing he don't know
[58:09] how he can interpret anything he wants
[58:12] to and impersonate any kind of a gift
[58:20] but he can't know this it's not even
[58:23] written in the word
[58:26] it's a total secret to Angels everything
[58:28] shut up
[58:31] if they made one move if I give
[58:32] something away so they just shut up
[58:35] quit harping
[58:37] everything stopped
[58:39] uh seven God's perfect number seven
[58:44] just write down the road seven
[58:47] Thunders utter straight together
[58:51] like you're spelling out something
[58:53] notice at that time
[58:56] John's started writing he said don't
[58:59] ride it
[59:01] Jesus never spoke of it
[59:05] John couldn't ride it
[59:07] Angels know nothing about it
[59:10] what is it
[59:11] it's the thing that Jesus said even the
[59:15] angels of heaven didn't know nothing
[59:17] about it see if you have anything
[59:20] he had ignored himself amen I said only
[59:23] God would know it amen
[59:26] amen but he told us when we begin to see
[59:27] these signs coming up
[59:33] we can see these signs coming up me
[59:38] if Satan you get a hold of it if you
[59:40] want something to happen
[59:42] uh you'll have to take my word for this
[59:44] if I'm planning on doing something I
[59:47] know better than to tell anybody about
[59:49] it
[59:50] not that that person will tell you but
[59:52] Satan will hear it
[59:53] see you can't get in my heart there as
[59:56] long as God's got it closed up for the
[59:58] holy spirit so that's between me and God
[1:00:03] he don't know nothing about it until you
[1:00:05] speak it then he hears it
[1:00:06] and I'll try I tell people I'll do a
[1:00:08] certain certain thing and once the devil
[1:00:10] cut off every wheel he can to get there
[1:00:12] see to beat me to do it but if I get the
[1:00:15] Revelation from God this don't say
[1:00:16] nothing about it
[1:00:18] that is different
[1:00:21] remember
[1:00:24] Satan will try to impersonate
[1:00:28] he'll try to impersonate everything that
[1:00:31] the church will do he's trying to do it
[1:00:33] we notice it through the Antichrist but
[1:00:35] this is one thing he cannot impersonate
[1:00:39] there'll be no mimics to this
[1:00:44] because he don't know it
[1:00:48] no way fine to know amen it's a third
[1:00:50] pull he just knows nothing about it
[1:00:53] it doesn't understand it
[1:00:56] but there's a sacred lays beneath that
[1:01:00] amen glory to God
[1:01:08] I could never think the scene the rest
[1:01:10] of my life
[1:01:12] when I seen now I don't know what I know
[1:01:16] the next step there but I don't know
[1:01:18] what how to interpret that
[1:01:21] it won't be long
[1:01:25] I've got roll down here when it happened
[1:01:27] if you can see here stop
[1:01:30] go no further
[1:01:33] than this right here I'm not prone to be
[1:01:36] a fanatic I'm just telling the truth but
[1:01:38] you remember
[1:01:40] the little shoe that I always tried to
[1:01:43] explain how the the soul laid next to so
[1:01:46] and so in the inner conscience and all
[1:01:48] that kind of stuff which it only made a
[1:01:50] big bunch of impersonation to start
[1:01:52] acting how do I take up the hand and
[1:01:54] hold the people and have vibration
[1:01:55] everybody had a vibration in their hands
[1:01:57] but you remember when he took me up
[1:01:59] there and said this is that third call
[1:02:01] and no one Lord amen

[1:11:13] tell you the truth this is exactly what
[1:11:15] happened something hit and said Don't
[1:11:17] Fear this is that third pool
[1:11:22] third party remember
[1:11:25] he said you've had so many impersonators
[1:11:28] on this what you tried to explain

[1:11:51] he said don't I was standing with a
[1:11:53] little baby's shoe when he told me
[1:11:55] something make your first pool and when
[1:11:57] you do the fish will run after the lure
[1:11:59] so then watch your second pull said
[1:12:01] because there's only these small fish
[1:12:03] he said then the third Paul will get it
[1:12:06] and all that ministers got around he
[1:12:07] said brother Graham we know you can do
[1:12:09] it Hallelujah brother Brown that's where
[1:12:10] I always get tied up with a bunch of
[1:12:12] preachers I love people they want you to
[1:12:14] explain everything this that and I said
[1:12:16] well uh uh uh uh I said I I don't know I
[1:12:19] said I've understand fishing now I said
[1:12:22] now first thing you do here's what it's
[1:12:23] done you see all the fish around you got
[1:12:25] to jerk The Lure well that's exactly the
[1:12:27] tactics of fishing so I said jerk the
[1:12:29] Lord now I see when I jerked The Lure
[1:12:31] the first time now the fish takes out
[1:12:33] after but there were little ones that's
[1:12:35] like they were catching so then I I said
[1:12:37] Daniel you're set and I jerked it out on
[1:12:40] the bank I had a fish but it looked like
[1:12:42] a skin Over The Lure it's just it was so
[1:12:44] little and then I'll stand there and
[1:12:46] said I told you not to do that
[1:12:52] and I started crying all the line was
[1:12:54] Tangled around me like this I had a
[1:12:56] standard of crying with my head down
[1:12:58] like that I said God oh I forgive me I
[1:13:02] I'm a stupid person Lord don't forgive
[1:13:05] me and I I had this line and that what I
[1:13:08] had in my hand was a little baby shoe
[1:13:11] about that long and I had that string
[1:13:13] was about as big around as my finger
[1:13:15] about a half inch like
[1:13:17] and the eyelet in this shoe was just
[1:13:20] about the size of a a littler than a 1
[1:13:24] 16 probably of an inch in the island and
[1:13:27] I was trying to lace this little shoe up
[1:13:29] with this great big inch card
[1:13:33] a voice comes that you can't teach
[1:13:36] Pentecostal babies Supernatural things
[1:13:40] said now let him alone
[1:13:43] just then he picked me up he took me up
[1:13:45] and set your way up high the world
[1:13:47] meeting was going to look like a tent or
[1:13:48] a Cathedral of some sort now look
[1:13:51] there's a little box like little place
[1:13:53] over in the side and I seen that light
[1:13:55] was talking to somebody about me that
[1:13:58] light that you see there on the picture
[1:13:59] it Whirled away from me like that and
[1:14:01] went over that tent and said I'll meet
[1:14:03] you there
[1:14:04] and said this will be the third pool and
[1:14:07] you won't tell it to nobody
[1:14:11] and in sabinia Canon he said this is the
[1:14:14] third pool and the street great things
[1:14:17] it goes with it
[1:14:19] and one unfolded today or yesterday the
[1:14:24] other one unfolded today and there's one
[1:14:27] thing that I cannot interpret because
[1:14:29] it's in an unknown language
[1:14:31] let's stand right there and look right
[1:14:34] straight at it and this is the third
[1:14:37] poll coming up amen and the Holy Spirit
[1:14:40] of God oh my that's the reason all
[1:14:45] Heaven Messiah
[1:14:48] now I better stop right here see
[1:14:52] I just I just feel checked not to say no
[1:14:54] more about it see so just remember
[1:14:57] the seventh seal the reason it was not
[1:15:00] over
[1:15:01] okay
[1:15:03] the reason it did not reveal it
[1:15:05] no one should know about it and I want
[1:15:08] you to know before I even note any word
[1:15:11] about that that Vision come years ago do
[1:15:13] you remember that and here it is just as
[1:15:16] this other has slides right straight
[1:15:18] into the word exactly what it was and
[1:15:20] God knows my heart I never one time
[1:15:23] thought of such a thing as that amen
[1:15:25] amen you're it was
[1:15:26] it's later than we think
[1:15:31] hello Ma
[1:15:34] that shows us from God
[1:15:36] for see if it's exactly in the promises
[1:15:40] of God
[1:15:41] from the end of the the message you
[1:15:45] notice
[1:15:46] notice now are they in the time message
[1:15:52] the seal after all he's revealed all the
[1:15:55] six seals but don't say anything about
[1:15:57] the seven
[1:15:59] and the end time seal when it starts
[1:16:02] will be absolutely a total Secret
[1:16:05] according to the Bible
[1:16:08] before knowing that and remember
[1:16:11] Revelations 10 1 7
[1:16:15] one to seven chapter 10 1-7 at the end
[1:16:20] of the seventh Angels message
[1:16:23] all
[1:16:26] the mysteries of God will be known

[1:16:47] didn't realize what it really was
[1:16:49] talking about and now I see it it is in
[1:16:52] such a humble way you think it's
[1:16:55] something like that would be revealed to
[1:16:56] the Vatican or but it comes just like
[1:16:59] John the Baptist amen it comes like the
[1:17:01] birth of our Lord in a state of the Lord
[1:17:04] glory to God

[1:17:34] mission that was brought here has been
[1:17:36] revealed that it had proven that it was
[1:17:40] of God

[1:19:03] that looks estranged to me was the one
[1:19:06] on mine beat the left where I entered
[1:19:09] the consolation at but counting from the
[1:19:12] left to the right it would have been the
[1:19:13] seventh angel
[1:19:15] see coming across now
[1:19:18] remember the seven Messengers do you
[1:19:21] remember the Pyramid of flight Rock of
[1:19:26] Junior Jackson's dream that I attributed
[1:19:28] you
[1:19:32] notice
[1:19:34] the night that I left
[1:19:37] and uh there were six dreams came and
[1:19:41] every one of them directly to the same
[1:19:42] thing
[1:19:43] then the vision started and sent me West
[1:19:47] Junior
[1:19:49] he was watching well notice look how
[1:19:52] perfect
[1:19:54] I'm I'm open and trusting at you people
[1:19:57] realized that I'm trying to put this
[1:20:00] grace on Jesus Christ who is the author
[1:20:04] of all of it and the only reason you
[1:20:06] never heard me talk like this before in
[1:20:08] your life
[1:20:09] but this hour is approaching amen
[1:20:14] amen notice
[1:20:17] how to make it sure to you so it can be
[1:20:21] driven down I'm fixing to leave you
[1:20:24] again
[1:20:24] I don't know where I'll go I must preach
[1:20:27] the gospel other places
[1:20:29] but now that you might say I've heard
[1:20:31] all that kind of Fanatics I don't know
[1:20:33] why I can't judge any other man I only
[1:20:36] have to answer to God for what I or for
[1:20:38] myself
[1:20:40] but has there ever been one time I ever
[1:20:42] told you anything in the name of the
[1:20:44] Lord it wasn't right in all these years
[1:20:46] nobody else can say so because I always
[1:20:48] told it just the way he told us now let
[1:20:50] me just show you that this is exactly
[1:20:53] true and confirming now remember if
[1:20:55] there be a spiritual or Prophet I'll the
[1:20:58] Lord will speak to him in visions and
[1:21:01] make known to him by dreams
[1:21:03] interpretting dreams is that Joseph you
[1:21:05] can interpret dreams and speaking and
[1:21:07] see Visions is that true
[1:21:09] now notice this the sound when this
[1:21:13] taking place Junior was standing in a
[1:21:16] field that had a had a big pyramid to it
[1:21:19] like that and there was something good
[1:21:21] on the rocks and I was revealing that to
[1:21:23] the people is that right Junior
[1:21:25] about a year before it happened
[1:21:27] and notice the next thing now I took
[1:21:30] some kind of a bar and cut it off and on
[1:21:32] the inside was White Rock that had
[1:21:34] nothing wrote on it
[1:21:35] and at that time I started to the West
[1:21:38] and I told them all I said don't go out
[1:21:41] west stay here
[1:21:43] and look on this till I return
[1:21:47] went West for the blast return back
[1:21:51] to the east
[1:21:53] with the Holy Spirit interpreted this
[1:21:57] Unwritten word amen
[1:22:00] amen now that isn't perfect God Almighty
[1:22:04] I want you know what it is what am I
[1:22:06] trying to say this for friend is to show
[1:22:07] you where at the end time now if that
[1:22:11] others is perfectly on the dot with the
[1:22:13] word so is this perfectly on the dock
[1:22:16] with the word
[1:22:18] we are here
[1:22:21] we're at the end friends
[1:22:23] soon it shall be time run out
[1:22:28] Millions will lose their lives
[1:22:30] Millions will be now believe that they
[1:22:33] are saved
[1:22:35] will be counted father
[1:22:38] for the atomic age
[1:22:41] we are living at the last hour
[1:22:44] by the grace of almighty God by his help
[1:22:49] to his people that they might look
[1:22:52] forward to the soon appearing of Christ
[1:22:54] how long brother brown maybe 20 years
[1:22:58] maybe in 50 years maybe in a hundred
[1:23:01] years I don't know and maybe in the
[1:23:03] morning maybe yet tonight
[1:23:05] I don't know and anybody says they do no
[1:23:08] they're wrong amen
[1:23:12] God Only Knows amen now notice so help
[1:23:17] me by God I tell the truth
[1:23:20] that these are spiritually discerned to
[1:23:25] me
[1:23:26] discerned by the Holy Spirit
[1:23:30] and by every one of them has identified
[1:23:33] its place in the Bible
[1:23:37] now what this great secret is that lays
[1:23:40] beneath this seal I do not know I don't
[1:23:44] know it I couldn't make it out I
[1:23:48] couldn't tell it
[1:23:49] just what it is what it said but I know
[1:23:52] that it was in seven Thunders uttering
[1:23:55] themselves right close together just
[1:23:57] banging seven different times and it
[1:24:00] unfolded into something else that I see
[1:24:03] then when I've seen that I look for the
[1:24:05] interpretation of Phil Crosshair and I
[1:24:07] couldn't make it out
[1:24:08] that's exactly right
[1:24:11] the hour isn't quite yet far amen but
[1:24:14] it's moving into that cycle see it's
[1:24:17] coming up close
[1:24:19] so the thing for you to do is to
[1:24:22] remember that I speak to you in the name
[1:24:24] of the Lord
[1:24:25] [Music]
[1:24:29] Hallelujah be prepared or you don't know
[1:24:32] what time something can happen
[1:24:42] I bless you how many can say Amen to the
[1:24:45] word no you tell me what's more
[1:24:47] important than the coming of the Lord
[1:24:51] what's more important than being
[1:24:53] prepared for the coming of the Lord
[1:24:56] either brother Branham is telling the
[1:24:58] truth or he is not
[1:25:00] I believe he's telling the truth that's
[1:25:03] the position we take amen God bless you
[1:25:06] so much I was listening to uh this great
[1:25:10] preacher what was his name not listening
[1:25:13] to him but about him Charles Finney and
[1:25:16] there was a great atheist
[1:25:18] he's a doctor atheist would go and hear
[1:25:20] him and they asked him why does he go in
[1:25:23] here uh brother Finney preach he says
[1:25:25] because Charles Finney believes what
[1:25:28] he's preaching
[1:25:30] and that's the way I want to be I want
[1:25:32] to believe what what God sent to me and
[1:25:35] not have any questions or doubt there so
[1:25:37] God bless you so much just that bless
[1:25:39] your heart
