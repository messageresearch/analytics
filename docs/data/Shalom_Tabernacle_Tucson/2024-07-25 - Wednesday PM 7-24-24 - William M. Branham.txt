our young musicians today and brother Scott he's younger than me so he's young too only be only believe all things are possible only believe oh only believe only believe all things are possible [Music] only amen God bless you you can be seated God's Prophet brother brandham now let's read some scripture first now I have three places in the Bible that I would like to read and first one of them if you'd like to mark it down and if you got a pencil I want to refer this morning to several uh a texts that I would uh or several scriptures rather that I would like to refer to the first will be 1 Peter 58:10 Ephesians 61017 and Daniel 12114 now and reading taking our time and everybody practically seated so a few standing yet in the back and on the side but we are going to try to get through as quick as possible and let you out then we're going to pray for the sick we got a little lady laying here this morning it's very sick I understand that she was very sick yesterday and I I just wanted her to hear this morning first before I prayed for her and I know the conditions of the little lady and she's very sick but we got a very great heavenly father who has more than conquered all sickness and I got a A little I asked Mrs Woods if she would read it but she she's a little reluctant of of doing so an article where a medical doctor was certainly surprised when he was a critic on Divine Healing and wouldn't even let anybody talk about in his office and his nurse also so it happened to be he got a patient that was a cancer case the big cancer he wanted nothing to do with that so he sent her over to another clinic they wanted nothing to do with it over there so they sent her back so they all it is on the breast and in a terrible condition and all this uh skin had been eaten off and the cancer went out into the breast into the ribs I guess you understand what I mean you got our little doctor friend from Norway sitting with us this morning and he got all of his material ready for he said you know she wanted him to operate and remove the breast and it was a very bloody job and and he got all his packs and everything the nurse got got the lady ready and brought her into the operating room and then she went back to get the instruments to that would have to be used by the doctor and his assistant to take the breast off and so they had the pals and things laying over and so they started when he started to turn around her husband won't know if he could set in the end of the room and pray he was a Holiness preacher and he sat there by side of the foot of the bed and praying of course the doctor wasn't too well satisfied with that you know him being in there but as long as he wouldn't look it wouldn't hurt him I guess it was all right wouldn't F wouldn't faint so while it's sitting praying they come a fluttering in the room and the doctor turns to go to with his instrument to start to remove the breast he moved pack after pack it wasn't even a scar on the bre not even a scar he said does it does it move and he started and the nurse gave her testimony both of them went out and has become Pentecostal filled with the Holy Ghost serving the lord not even a scar the doctor Holbrook testified himself said one minute before there there was a the woman laying there and the nurse and a great big Cancer all pushed out on her breast and one minute later there wasn't even a scar where it been moved that's one of our fine medical doctors here in America he said he was convinced right then and yet he was a deacon in a church see see the people just think church is something you just go to and it's um oh you go there to learn to be good or something like that that isn't it friend no God is God Amen he's just as great today as he was ever was and he always will be the same and he's a we just love him now we want to read now from first Peter the 5th chapter the 8th and 10th verse to start with be sober diligent because your adversary the devil a roaring line walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resists steadfastly in faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who has called us unto his eternal glory by Jesus Christ after that you have suffered a while make you perfect established strength and settle you how God be praised now in the book of Ephesians we'd like to turn here to the book of Ephesians the 6th chapter and would like to read the 10th to the 17th verse I have marked out finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of the world of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto yourself the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand in the evil day having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins G about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace Above All Things The Shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God Amen now over in the Book of Daniel I would like to read some more now Daniel the 12th chapter I want to begin at the first and read quite a a lengthy part of this 14 verses and at that time Michael stand up a great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even into that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book and many of them that sleep in the dust of the Earth shall awake and some to everlasting life some to shame and everlasting contentment and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn away turn away many to righteousness as the Stars forever and ever but thou oh Daniel shut up the shut up the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased and I Daniel looked and behold there stood other two one on this side of the bank of the river and one on the that side of the bank of the river and one said to the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river how long shall it be to the end of these word wonders and I heard the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven and swear by him that live forever that it shall be for a time time and a half and when he has accomplished the scatter the power of the Holy people these things shall be finished I believe I'll stop right there I want to take a text if it would be called a text out of there from that to draw this conclusion of the greatest battle ever fought that's what I want to use for a text now how I come to get a hold to this for a text for this morning we have just come back couple couple of the trustees here at the church and myself was out in Arizona and we went out really to have a meeting at Phoenix with brother sherid at his Tabernacle but uh when I found out that a a brother was in town having services in a tent then I felt a little reluctant about holding a meeting I thought maybe I would have it on the Sunday afternoon so that no one would be bothered in their churches but find out that he had Sunday afternoon Services also and I was uh a little bit worried about having a service and so we Brethren instead of going um uh on through the day as we were out hunting we went into the city on and got ready and went to the brother Allen's Services brother AA Allen was having services so we went to the services and brother Allan preached a mighty sermon we had a a time a good time listening to brother Allan hearing the the singers and so forth how they sang and shouted and had a great service then we sing seen all along the road the hand of the Lord wherever we went the Lord Jesus would meet with us and there's something about being out to yourself out in the deserts there's something about it that if you're ever alone that way there's something that draws you that's I guess is one reason I like those outway places you get away from the power of the enemy so much as we have here a devil is almost harmless unless he can have something to work in he's got remember those Devils that were cast out of Legion they had want to do more mischievousness so they wanted to go in the Hogs so Devils must have something to work in somebody to work through and that's the way God does too he has to have us he's depending on us to work through us and many came while we were on the trip with dreams and the Lord Jesus never fail but give the interpretation correctly and just be that just exactly that way and then he was good to us to lead us to the game and tell us where it was at and you know just to be around like that it's just wonderful sat around a night by the campfire away from everybody for miles and miles and miles and watched the uh the flickering campfire around the rocky rims and all it was tremendous one brother there who had been having trouble with a his wife that had years ago she raised her head in a meeting where that I was having service and I'd asked them to keep their head down uh had an evil spirit that wouldn't leave a a woman on the platform and the lady uh just uh irreverent raise your head anyhow and the spirit left the woman on the platform and went to her and this is around 14 years and the lady has been in serious condition so much even Mally till she just does things that's not even right for instance left her own husband went married another man while she's living with her husband claim she didn't know she done it and um so the um they tried to examine her for this what don't you call that when you Amnesia my ever what that name is I guess that's right doctor um but it wasn't that it was a spirit it and her and the lady was a fine friend of mine but from that night on she deliberately hated me of course you could see why it was but then when her husband came and we knelt in the room to pray then the Holy Spirit came down that was it then he appeared to her husband that night in a dream he came back with a dream he thought it was jokey come to find out it was the very answer to his wife's healing how that the Holy Spirit did deal on down into Tucson with brother nman and them and there the Lord begin to work again with great powerful things and revealing things one night what drew me to this conclusion here I was standing with brother wood and brother sthan and we were about 10:00 at night and I was looking up towards the sky and a great awe came over me and I said just look all that great heavenly host and I said everything is perfectly in Harmony and brother wood said looking at two little stars so close together that may look like a light I said but you know brother wood according to science in that Dipper the Little Dipper the Big Dipper those Stars don't look over about 2 Ines apart and they're farther away from each other than we are from them and if they would start to this earth it would take at thousands of miles an hour it would take hundreds and hundreds of years from the reach the Earth and I said in all this great vast system here and yet they tell us that they look through glasses can see 20 million years of Life Time way out in there and they still Moons and stars and and yet God made every one of them amen and he sits in the midst of them and I said somewhere in there I had pointed out to me one time in an observatory the Zodiac beginning with the uh virgin coming over through the cancer age and on down until the last was the line Leo the line the first coming of Christ for the Virgin the second coming by the lion of the tribe of Judah and I said I've tried my best to see that zodiac and I can't see it but yet it's there those who are trained know it's there job saw it man used to look at it it was a Bible at one day but in that whole great mass of millions of billions of of light years God sits in the midst of all of it amen and he looks down Paul is in there my mother is in there somewhere looking down and I thought of the order of that heavenly host not one of them's out of place everyone keeps its time perfectly God's Great Army a thought of the soldiers how that if that Moon would happen to get out of order the Earth would be covered again with water just in a few minutes the Earth would be just like it was when God decided to use it for to have us year on it it was without farm and void and darkness and water was up on the breath of the earth if that Moon would ever move it would do the same thing again when the moon rocks a little bit away from the earth the tides come up when it goes down just follows the tithes it's God's Great Army when I thought about the that being God's Great Army there now we went to bed and then I begin to think let not one of those get out of their place they all set in place and if there's a moving anywhere of them it's for a cause and will affect this Earth we just see the results of it now from some of them moving into their other spots it's effective it affects everything I thought then if that great Heavenly Host like that had has to keep its place to make everything in order what about the disorder of the Earthly host how when one gets out of order how it throws the whole thing out of cater the whole program of God is upset when one member gets out of order we should continually to strive to keep the order of the spirit amen and I would to God this morning that we would bring this to a real healing service that we could keep this part group that we have gathered under the roof this morning in such a Harmony that the Holy Spirit would place every member of the body to Che this morning in such Harmony Till There be such a spontaneous healing of soul and body if we just hold our positions now as I said at the beginning this lady who had the cancer that Dr Holbrook take was going to take off now the god that caused the flutter noise to come into that clinic and Tuck that cancer without even leaving a scar don't you know that same God here am and the only thing that he is waiting for is for his his army to get to position like the stars get the position now do you know we've had Wars after wars and rumors of Wars and if the Earth stands we'll have plenty more Wars but do you realize that there is really only two powers in all the universe of all of our differences between nations and differences between each other and everything it all mounts up to two Powers there's only two powers and there's only two kingdoms two powers and two kingdoms all the rest of little minor things are connected with either one of those powers and those Powers is God's power and Satan's power amen that's what the every war every disorder everything that comes along it's either controlled by God's power or Satan's power because that's the only two Powers there is and that is the power of life and the power of death now that's the only two powers and Satan can only his power he's got is a perverted power of God it isn't no real power it's a perversion of God's power everything that Satan has death is only a perverted life a lie is only the truth MLD see adultery is a Act misused a righteous act misused see everything that Satan's got is something that was perverted but it's a power and we are today sitting here and one or the other power is going to control us so let's cast out the evil one let's take our position like the stars of the heavens as the Bible speaks wandering Stars over the book of Jude Hing out their own shame and we don't want to be wondering Stars wonder if this is right wonder if that's right wonder if it will happen wonder if how it could be don't wonder stay like those stars of the heaven as a real soldier at his post of Duty stand there believing life and death now an army when really an army a nation makes ready to go against another Nation it should first sit down and figure what's right and wrong and whether they're able to go against the next Nation or Not Jesus taught that and um if people would do that if the nations would have would sit down and stop and think those things both sides we would have the more war now we find out if a man doesn't do that if the military heads of the nation doesn't sit down first and figure and see that they're right and their motives and objectives right and if they have enough strength and power to overcome the next Army then they're sure to lose that's where general kustard made his fatal mistake General custard as I understand had orders from the government not to go into the land out the Su because it was a religious time for them it was a time of worship they were having a feast but kustard got drunk and he thought that he would just do it anyhow he would cross whether it was arter or not arter and then they actually shot some innocent man shot at him I think they hit some of them it was scouts out hunting for food to feed their their people while they were in worship and custard Crossing seen them and thought they were uh after their side and so they shot into these Scouts and these Scouts escaped got back what did they do they armed themselves and here they come and that was the end of General custard because he didn't sit down and think first you had no business there you had no right to be there You' push the Indians from the East Coast all the way across the West anyhow and they had a treaty but he broke the treaty and when he broke the treaty that he lost the battle and so a army first in getting ready for a battle first has got to be a select some soldiers they've got to be dressed for fighting they've got to be trained for fighting and I believe that the greatest battle that was was ever fought is now ready to go in action I believe that God has been selecting his soldiers I believe he's been dressing them training them and the Battlefront is now set getting ready to start this great first battle that was ever fought began in heaven when Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on Earth it originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of Heaven to the Earth and fell on human beings then the battle from Angels become human battles and Satan come to destroy God's creation what God had created to be for himself he had Satan come to destroy this that's what his purpose was was to destroy it then the battle begin here on Earth and begin in us and it's been raging ever since now before any battle can be put in a ray they first have to choose a meeting ground are a place where the battle is to be fought a selected place in the first world war it was so place in old man's land and places where they fought and uh they've got to be a place selected like when Israel went to war with the Philistines there was a a a hill on each side where they gathered and that's where GLA come out and call to the armies of Israel that's where David met him in the valley when he passed over the little creek that run between the two hills he picked up the Rocks there has to be a place selected and in this there's a a mutual ground no man's land and they fight here at this place they just don't one fight over here and one down here and one run over here there's a Battlefront where they meet and test their powers where each Army tests its strength against the other Army a mutual meeting place now don't get miss this when this great battle started on Earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage and that battle grounds begin in the human mind the that's where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where it was begin and that is because that decisions are made from the mind the head now they never started it from some um organization they never started from some uh mechanical Affair the Great SS never started there therefore that organization can never never do the work of God because the Battlegrounds where you've got to meet your enemy is in the mind you've got to make your choice it meets you I want this little girl here that's very sick to be sure to listen now to this real closely decisions are made in the mind the head that's where Satan meet you and the decisions are because they God made a man that way now I have if you looking on my Note here a little map draw out I had it here not long ago on used on the board the human being is made up just like a grain of wheat it's a seed and the human being is a seed physically you're the seed of your father and mother and the life come from the Father the pup come from the mother so the two together the egg and the the blood comes together and in the blood cell is life and in there it begins develop making the the child now any seed has a shell on the outside the inside is Pulp and inside of the pulp is the germ of life well that's the way we're made we are Body Soul and Spirit the outside the body the shell the inside of that the conscience and so forth is the soul and the inside the soul is the spirit and the spirit governs all the other now if you'll sit down when you get home and draw three little rings you'll find out that the outside body has five senses it's contacted by and that is see taste feel smell hear that's the five senses that control the human body inside of the body is a soul and that soul is controlled by imaginations conscience memory reasons and affections that's the thing that controls the soul but the spirit is only has one sense the spirit oh oh let's get it the spirit has one sense and that sense is either dominates it is Faith or doubt that's exactly and there's only one Avenue to it that's free moral agency you can accept doubt or you can accept Faith either one you want to work on therefore Satan begin at the principal part that cause the spirit of man to doubt God's word god begin the principal part to lay his word in that Spirit there you are that's what does it if this church right now could be put together and knitted together with such that every person would be in one Accord with not one Shadow of Doubt anywhere there would not be a feeble person in our midst in another five minutes there would not be nobody here Desiring the Holy Ghost but what would receive it if you could just get that certain thing fixed now there's where the battle begins right in your mind whether you will now remember it's not Christian Science Now mind over matter that has the mind accepts the life which is the word of God and there brings the life just your thought doesn't do it but the word of God brought in the channel of your thought see it's not the thought as Christian Science make it mind over matter no that isn't it but your mind accepts it and grasp it what is your mind controlled by your spirit and your spirit catches the word of God and that's the thing that's got life in it it brings life into you oh brother when that takes place when life comes down that channel into you the word of God is manifested in you if you abide me and my words abide in you then ask what you will and it'll be done for you then what does that do from the middle of the heart which is the soul from There Goes Forth feeding every channel the trouble of it is we're standing in here with a lot of Doubt trying to accept what's out there you've got to stop that and come down that Channel with the true word of God and then it goes out itself automatically it's what's on the inside that's the thing it counts as the inside Satan's approach is from the inside now you say I don't steal I don't drink I don't do these things that has nothing to do with it see it's the inside no matter how good you are how moral you are how truthful you are those things are respected but Jesus said accept a man be born again see there's got to be something happened inside if you don't that's artificial put on for down in your heart you desire to do it anyhow amen it can't be artificial it's got to be real and there's one only one Avenue that can come down and that's by the way of free moral agency come into the Soul by your thoughts as a man thinketh in his heart so is he amen if you say to this mountain move and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you said you get it there you are see there's the Battleground if you could only get that started first we're so anxious to see things done we're so anxious to do something for God this little lady is no anxious no doubt anxious to live she wants to be well others are here wants to be well and when we hear about uh that case like the doctor the resurrection of the Dead the Great Mighty things that our God has did then we're anxious and the thing of it is we try to reach through these senses to grab a hold of something here like conscience so many people lots of times has misconstrued the word and I've been misunderstood by this by making alter calls I said I wasn't much on an alter call not meaning that you shouldn't make an alter call but somebody get somebody the arms and oh brother John you know what me and you have been neighbors all this time come up here at the altar get down what's he doing wish I had a Blackboard here I can show you what he's doing he's trying to work through his soul on affections that don't worken that's not the Avenue certainly it isn't maybe he's working in a memory through the sense of his soul old brother John you had a wonderful mother she died a long time ago a memory see you can't do that it's got to come down the line of free moral agency you yourself let the word of God you don't come because your mother was a good woman you don't come because you're a good neighbor you come because that God calls you to come and you accept him on the basis of his word that word's what means everything that word if you can get everything out of the way all conscience all senses and just let the word come in that word will produce just exactly here see what it's covered over with you say well now uh you say well these conscious and senses and so forth don't have anything to do with the brother BR certainly it does but if you let the word come in it covered over with conscience then it can't grow it'll be a deformed word did you ever see a good grain of corn plant in the ground and let a stick fall over it it'll grow crooked anybody anything he grows up with because something has hindered it well that's what's the matter with our Pentecostal faith today we've let too many things hinder it the faith that we've been taught the Holy Spirit that's been living in us we've let too many things looking at somebody else and the devil's always trying to point you to somebody's failure but he tries to keep you away from the real testimony that's genuine he'll point you to a hypocrite sometime who went out impersonating something he didn't do it because he was impersonating but if it come from the true source of the word of God heavens and earth will pass away but my word cannot pass away it's got to stay there you see it says it must be accepted in the mind then it's believed with the heart then the word of God becomes a reality then every senses of soul and body is just scoured out with the Holy Spirit am then your sense of God your conscience of God everything that's Godly flows through you there's not a doubt anywhere there's nothing can rise up there's nothing can come up in the memory and say well I remember Miss Jones tried to trust God Miss so and so miss do tried to trust God for healing one time and she failed see but if that channel has been cleared out and been purged and been filled on the inside with the holy spirit that don't even come in memory don't matter about Miss J and what she did you and God together nobody else but you two how you are there's your battle kill him at the beginning stop him dead in his trap amen it ain't how long you make the war linger just stop it right now if you'll come and you'll keep them memories and conscience and everything thinking about well I might fail it might not be right don't you do that at all you throw aide everything and open up a channel and say God your word is eternally true amen as for me if the whole church fails if the whole world fails yet I can't fail because I'm taking your word there's the battle that's the thing why would almighty God remove a cancer from a woman's breast without a scar and let a child L die no sir a little girl come here not long ago from the high school her mother called me up said brother random my girl's got hjis disease that's cancer at forms and lumps and the doctors took a piece from a break on her throat sent it away and it's perfectly hodin disease so he said the next one breaks may break over a heart when it does she's gone said she hasn't got a away they breaking she's got anywhere about three months to live the mother said what shall I do send her back to school said let her go because she'll go probably suddenly and said just let her go and live an noral life as she can don't tell her nothing about it so the lady said to me what must I do I said bring her up and put her in the prayer on I said you come with her I've had a little funny feeling and when the little girl come by that morning with blue looking lips from makeup and school has them and and the little thing come by I didn't know who she be go called me on the phone I tuck a ho over her hand I said good morning sister there she was that was her just in a few moments looked down to her mother and seen both of them without god without Christ I said how can you expect healing on these grounds will you accept Jesus Christ as your personal savior I said will you come to this pool here and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins they said we will do that oh you know what happen the woman may be sitting here this morning many of you know the case brother Mike Ean one of the trustees here what the case that's been about four or five years ago the little girl was tuck back to the doctor not even one trace of haj's disease was found in her what was the matter you had to open the Channel first you've got to get the soldier the Holy Spirit placed at the Battlefront that takes God's word he is the word and he stands there and there's nothing going to stop but then there's nothing every one of the other channels is cleared out it's like an old barter with the flu stopped up you put a fire in little blow your thing up that's what a matter so many blowed up Christians is because that they don't clean the channels out they don't go down to the inside Lord Merc you've got to clean it conscience memory pops laying aside everything and coming from the inside out with that unadulterated word of God that it's a truth no matter if 10,000 died on this side today trusting 10,000 died on that side tomorrow trusting that has nothing to do with me am I'm the individual I'm the one that's trusting I'm the one that believes it and we see back under if we want to open up our channels and if we can and see we find this and and that and this and that and thousands of them testifying but the devil will try to come right back see if he can get in there at all he's got your army routed right then if you've got your senses see taste feel smell and hear they're all right but don't trust them unless they agree with the word they're all right but if they disagree with the word don't you listen to them now imaginations conscience memories reasons and affections they're all right if they agree with the word but if your affection doesn't agree with the word get rid of it you blow a flu right quick if your reason disagrees with the word get away from it that's right the if your memory if your imaginations if your conscience anything disagrees with that what's on the inside get rid of it what you got then you got a solar system Hallelujah God set the stars in order and said hang there God call you and stay there nothing's going to move them when God can get a man in his hands till he can get senses conscience everything cleaned out until it stands with God behind it in the spirit there's not a devil in the world can poke it down in there Hallelujah right he come around and say you don't feel any better your conscience is even gone to that the flu so clear it shouts Hallelujah the outlet blows a whistle glory to God it sounds out just is clean and clear for the word of God to work through the power of God see that's the main thing there's your Battleground your Battleground is back here at the beginning back here in the soul back in your mind that opens the the mind is the gate to the soul the gate to the spirit rather your mind opens up and accepts the spirit or it rejects the spirit you can have little Consciousness little feelings and little Sensations all these things that has nothing to do with it that's just little Sensations and things but when it comes to reality your mind opens it up amen your mind either accepts it or rejects it that's it friends God let none of them miss it see it's your mind that opens up the door or closes the door and listens to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affections but when your mind closes itself self to these things and let God the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of the stuff out every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of Doubt is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of God and Satan cannot battle against that no sir he cannot battle against it now we know that's truth the these battles has raed since the day of the Garden of Eden the battle in the human mind Satan started it what did he do when he met Eve he didn't deny God's word but he whitewashed it he stopped up some little channels here somewhere he said but surely God Genesis 3:1 he surely God all these things that he he he promised he know the word was right but he know he couldn't just come right out and blast it out uh blurry like that but he he he sugarcoated it like Mama used to get us to take medicine and she try to put orange juice and Castor o might just rather take the castor oil without the orange juice anything that's hypocritical see she we used to have to get up at night time and she'd give us Co oil for cro and she'd put Co oil and put sugar on it see kind of hypocritical but just burn your tonsils out nearly going down at the sugar L well that's the way it is is friend Satan tries to to be hypocritical about it he tries to show you something better a easier way a more sensible plan but there is no more sensible plan in that God laid down at the beginning of his word hold that word get a grip on it let it get a grip on you and stay there with it that's the that's the thing the battle rage when Eve opened up her mind to listen to her reasoning that's the flu it come in that's a the chainel that run down her reasoning she in her soul she reasoned her eyes was sight she saw the serpent is beautiful handsome far better than her own husband he the most subst of all the beasts of the field and he was probably a fairer man than her husband he looked like a great masculine Beast standing there how great he was and he was trying to tell her what a great thing it was and first thing she did she opened up her mind and when she did human reasonings call it why wouldn't that be a thrill that's the thing he does to a woman today some woman with a lovely little husband find some great big masculate man this man will try to open up the reasons remember that's Satan that's the devil or vice versity man to woman woman to man either way what does he do work in that reasoning power that conscience or something he begins to move through but give God's word the first place amen a man can't even come to God he can't sin Hallelujah there it is this coming fresh a man cannot sin until first he cast the God's word you can't even sin Hallelujah that's disbelief on first he gets rid of the word of God the presence of God he cannot sin Eve cannot sin until she laid aside God's word opening up her channel of reasons to her soulen and begin to reason why certainly my husband's never told me these things but uh I believe that you he told me I should do this but you know you make it so real it's so plain I I believe it would be wonderful because you're making this so plain to me see there was the first battle and through that battle has caused every other one every Bloodshed that ever come was caused right there at Eden she disbelieved God's word and if one little iot of God's word was disbelief caused all this trouble how are we going to get back disbelieving the word word you can't do it got to shut off all these other things conscience memories and say reasonings and all these other casting down reasonings we don't reason about it all nothing at all we just accept the word upon on the basis God said so it sets a stream between you and God every channel comes open between you and God then there's the battle the very first front line let's not use a 22 rifle let's get a an atomic bomb let's do the job right let's get God's atomic bomb why is it brother brandom f a r t in his word that's God's atomic bomb G sickness and Devils right and left it it annihilates them discriminates oh it's it just destroys it disintegrates everything that's unod when that bomb of Faith drops in there with the word of God behind it it blows every devil every sickness every disease you say is that right brother BR why does it on some and not on others it's because of the channel you can look out and see it but you got to have it in here looking this way not out there looking in you got to be in looking out amen you can't come through reason you can't come through these other things you've got to come right down God's channel of it right into the soul and how do you do it watch's the last Channel it'll Reas right on down you say senses oh I I can feel it yeah there it is oh I I might smell it or so forth these things are there yeah next thing you Reas him well it looks like he ought to know what he's talking about the doctor says I can't get well that ought to be see right there you you're Rob that's the devil standing there that's the devil poking these things into you don't you believe it Hallelujah God's word said above all things I wouldn't you prosper and Hell how can you be a real Soldier out there I want you to prosper in Hell there it is right there those channels you just get them open up don't this bypass him then if Satan can get through there get by these conscience and all these other things then he gets right down here at the end of the soul in the mind now if he can just get you you'll never you'll never look at one of them on till first you have to let him in here you have to let him in then when he gets in he's got control then what does he do he begins to use the conscience he begins to use this begin to use this Outlet what is it see taste feel smell hear it imaginations conscience memory reasons affections he begin to use all those different little channels as long as he can get in above this one here he's got to come in your mind first and you have to accept it it can listen it can batter against you but it can't get to you until you accept it amen help us when Satan walked up to even and said you know the fruit's pleasant she stopped for a moment oh that's when she made a mistake when she stopped for a moment don't stop for nothing you got the message Jesus Lives God's A Healer that's the message don't stopped for nothing no reasonings no nothing else but she stopped for a moment that's when Satan walked right into that mind said well it sounds reasonable don't do that just take what God Said Abraham what if he stop for reasoning when I told him he was going to have a baby but Sarah and she was 65 and him 75 and when he was 100 and she was uh and she was 90 he still he he he confessed that God's word was true and he called those things which were not as though they were see he even a Hope Was there any hope he didn't even use hope well you say I hope I can get all right I hope I'll be well I hope I get the Holy Ghost I hope I'm a Christian I hope I do this you don't want that Abraham never even looked at that am I against hope he still believe God's word faith is beyond hope faith comes from back here in the inside faith comes from here how does it get in through this mind this this door the Battlefront standing there now when you get the battle set in Ray now the devil's setting right to every heart this morning he's setting this little girl's heart he's setting at your hearts he's sitting all around there he's saiding oh I seen a try before I've heard that before cast him out it's all cast him out amen what does the Bible say here our text casting him out that's right casting him out we've been trained I think what's the matter with us preachers I wonder what kind of training we've had help us God's training for this great battle help us Jesus Matthew 24 said there and also Daniel 12 said there be a time of trouble such as never like on the earth before and we're living in that time when culture and education and things have smothered over the word of God and got into reasonings and so forth the Battle Is Now who stand Hallelujah the battle's ready to go in she's R now look what a great opposition we got who will be like David said you stand and let that uncircumcised Philistine defile the armies of fight amen God wants man and women this morning you can raise up and say I take the Lord at his word no matter what F this and that and what that and did that has nothing to do with you SS and so forth if you're afraid of him get back where you belong but God's arm is moving forward amen man of veiler man of of of Faith man of power man of understanding they don't have to be smart they don't have to be educated they have to be channels God takes those little channels she stopped for a moment to reason saying well now let's see well just like what if this little lady this morning no doubt that the doctors told her she's just about the end of the road there's nothing can be done well now that's that doctor I don't condemn him that man is a scientific man he sees that the disease has conquered the child's body it's beyond anything he has got a medicine that will stop it so that cancer conquered that woman sure D to conquer that baby our chief Captain Hallelujah of this great Army hallu he is a Resurrection Life Hallelujah nothing can conquer him Hallelujah the brains of the army lays in its captains the intelligence ROM all and Germany was the brains of Germany not Hitler Romo that's right Eisenhower military man Patton those men who were at the front it depend on which way they gave the order you follow your captain if he's a right kind of a general if he's a right kind of he's a fourstar general if he's proved if he's been proven to be right though it may seem wrong to you go out to the front do as he told you Hallelujah we got a fstar general St Jesus placing five stars on a f a i t h he's never lost a battle Hallelujah he conquered death hell in the grave get the devil out of the way he's the great Chief Captain so the devil isn't even the picture the greatest battle has ever raged is sitting right ready now certainly it is oh Hallelujah when I think we can clap to that and all God's people say amen we'll do some singing after the prayer for time sake but I'd like to just bring a few quot quotes that I caught there during this tape early on brother Brenham said we should continually to strive to keep the order of the spirit just after that he said the only thing that he's waiting W for is his army to get their position he was talking about the stars get their position like the stars get the position shortly after that he said that word means everything he said it must be accepted in the mind then it's believed with the heart then the word of God comes a reality then every senses of soul body is scoured out with the Holy Spirit then your sense of God conscious of God everything that's Godly flows through you there's not a doubt anywhere there's nothing that can rise up every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of God and Satan cannot battle against that so sometimes I know we think maybe it's brothers or sisters or boss at work or these things that these battle places that we're fighting but maybe one of our children can help us uh Timmy Christina where is the greatest battle fought did you catch that tonight right here the devil is fighting you right here and if you can accept that word and let him manifest in your life then we will conquer amen so it's just real good to be with you tonight um we miss our pastor of course we appreciate him and we want to lift him up in prayer tonight sister Sharon together we also want to appreciate our precious brother George brother John and the Saints for covering while we're up in the cooler climate this weekend love you and appreciate you and and missed you this weekend so we thank you we want to remember the the prayer request before before we do that just a short testimony my son's good at giving you the 10-minute story and turning it into an hour but it is a a testimony that I'm thankful I have all my children tonight because I could be doing a funeral this weekend my son works for a subcontractor to Duke Energy they were they they even do aerial uh cleanup trees and things with saws that hang from helicopters all that Dylan just slings a chainsaw and sometimes people don't like them in the backyards or whatever cleaning around the power lines I don't know all the Gory details but uh gentleman had talked to them went into the house end up he uh took his brother's life and came out and started shooting at this crew three of my son's co-workers were hit there was bullets we whizzing around him but everybody's going to do okay and so we just thank the Lord for watching over him things could be much different and so I do want to remember this fella Lucas if I was there I probably would wanted to take things into my own hands and put them down but the Lord saw fit that everybody except for this man's brother is still with us and so I want to hold up Lucas um you know the scripture came to mind the L say the prodigal son he said he came to himself and maybe this man he needs to come to himself come to the Lord I don't know if there's an opportunity there but we're going to just apply Faith tonight for this man these three gentlemen that are in the hospital they're serious but they're expected to live and of course interviews and things my son is going through and and I don't know what the future holds it doesn't matter he's alive we serve a living God if he wasn't alive doesn't matter we serve a living God and so we hold up um these gentlemen in North Carolina that we're cleaning up around the uh you know cutting trees down and things around the power lines and so we hold them up Lucas and I'm just thankful to the Lord tonight these three co-workers my son and the mental The Great Battle those things we just thank the Lord for apply the word tonight so happy to to be with you and worshiping instead of mourning tonight so that being said I'll read a couple of other prayer requests and then if you have something you'd like to mention a testimony or prayer request or an unspoken we'll do that so while up in Flash this weekend my mom fell broke her ankle it's actually the leg right by the ankle they call it that ankle uh broken and she's in a lot of pain and we know the Lord will help
