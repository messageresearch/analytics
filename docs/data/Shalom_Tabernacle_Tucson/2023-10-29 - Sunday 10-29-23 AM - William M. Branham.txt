Heavenly Father how we just want you to come down here in this service this morning Lord Jesus and may we feel your presence Lord let your Holy Spirit baptize each one aresh Lord God and Lord help us

ye also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the p possession under the praise of his glory amen let's sing only believe as brother renam comes to speak to us this morning only [Music] be only [Music] be all things are possible only believe only be only be for all things are possible only be God bless you may be seated in the Bible in the Book of Ruth as you read it you'll find out such a person was called the goal g o e l was called the goal or it was a person that could meet the requirements and the goal must be able to do it must be willing to do it and must be a Kinsman next to Kinsman to do it and God the creator of spirit became kin folks to us when he become m in order he could take our sin upon him and pay the price and redeem us back to God again there it is there is the Redeemer Christ has redeemed us now we are now redeemed but he has not claimed his possession yet now you might differ that but you just hold on a minute we'll see he hasn't claimed it see if he took the the book of redemption everything that Adam had and everything that he lost Christ redeems back and he's already redeemed us but he hasn't took the possession yet he cannot until the time appointed and then will come the resurrection and then the Earth will be renewed again and then he'll take possession his possession which he got when he redeemed us but we'll do at the appointed time oh my uh this is described in this seven seal book that we're talking of now all right the book of redemption it's all described in here all that what Christ will do at the end will be revealed to us this week in the Seven Seals of God lettuce all right it'll be revealed and revealed as the seals break and are released to us then we can see what this great Plan of Redemption is and when and how it's going to be done it's all hidden in this book of mystery here it's sealed up with Seven Seals and so lamb is the only one who can break them now pardon me we realize now if you'd like to look in the scriptures you can get over in Jeremiah and find out there when uh he was um when he he was going into the Captivity land you know he he bought his uncle his uncle's son had some uh some property and he went through that uh ceiling and if we talk it all we got that also in the seven Church ages and seals and so forth in there you see a seal in the Old Testament was like a roll like this and here was a mystery and this mystery was hidden all right it was sealed around and put here the claim to so and so then the next mystery was wrapped around of what this inheritance was and stuck out your on this side uh the the the claim to so and so and went on down until it made a scroll because people didn't have books like this then it was in a roll how many knows that called a scroll well a seal scroll you could break loose one here what the mystery of this was and tear it loose and you can see what that claim was and then break the other loose and you see what that claim was and the whole thing here is Seven Seals got the mysteries of God from the foundational world all sealed up in there and revealed by seven different seals that of God willing let him let us pull back these seals and look down through the book and find out what it's all about oh I hope we have a great time there the mystery of Redemption is sealed until this book could not be broken until the last Angel's message the Scrolls there we know it was there we know that it was Redemption we believed it was Redemption Jeremiah said this scroll must be kept as you read it there he say he must be kept in an Earthly vessel see oh what a beautiful thing talk about a while this scroll was kept in an Earthly vessel a vessel that once became flesh Glory di rose again and kept in the Earthly vessel until the time of the purchase beautifully all right now these messages are all kept up until this Earthly vessel until the time of God's appointed time at the last messenger at the Earth and all that these people had judged that and said I know it's there I believe it's there and they followed it and brought it forth and produced The Things by faith they believed it but now it's going to be brought to us in Revelation and from the hand of God by Vindication God said so you promised it now now let's see what where was we at let's go to verse two now that's a long time for verse one but let's let's take verse two now we probably won't stay that long on the next one and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open book and to loose the seal thereof now remember let's read the first verse again so we get get it together I saw in the right hand of him that's set up on the throne God who is that the absolutely original holder of the book of life he holds it God does when Adam forfeited it went back to its original owner it belongs to him and John in the vision looked over and saw in the right hand of him that set upon a throne uh a book written within and on the backside seal with Seven Seals see inside now when we go to Breaking these seals you're going to see it goes Plum back in the scripture all the way back for each one of those seals the whole thing together the whole mystery lays right you're in these seals see every mystery of the Bible lays in these SE seals and the seals cannot be broken until that time am amen I prove it here just a minute notice now the book remember is sealed there's one here is this seal then another one's WRA a seal another one's WRA a seal it's a book of redemption and the whole thing together makes the book and it's sealed with Seven Seals and but in on the backside is because it's wound up the seal mystery is on the inside and only says the white horse rider the black horse rider and what more on the outside but the mystery of the whole book is in them seals from Genesis Revelations a complete Plan of Redemption is revealed in these Seven Seals what it's an important time God help us to get it now and a strong angel now verse two the strong angel with a loud voice proclaiming who is worthy worthy for why who is worthy to take that book now we find out where's the book at now to its original owner because it has been forfeited by a son the first Son of God in the human race and when he forfeit his rights to listen to Satan he give up what did he do he accepted Satan's wisdom instead of God's word now couldn't we stop here a while sons of God will take a seminary's idea about it instead of the word of God same thing Adam did for fored his right and when it did it went rightous straight back can't you see where those ages has been see went right straight back to the original horror and John in the spirit standing up here in heaven he's just been lifted up now from the church ages see saw the church ages and then he was taken up in the fourth chapter he said come up higher I'm going to show you things that will come and he saw one sitting upon the throne with this book in his hand in his right hand think of it now and then in this book was a title deed to Redemption and it was sealed with Seven Seals and then an angel came forth a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who was worthy to open the book to take the book who was able to open the seals who was able to open this book see the angel asked it John saw it and he said now who's worthy let him oh my maybe I'm is feeling this this way but let him said the angel amen let him here is the book of redemption here is the Plan of Redemption here is the only way you'll ever be redeemed for there is the title deed to Redemption of the whole heavens and earth let him come forward if he will oh my now speak of forever holy spe let him come forward and claim this book who's worthy to do it and John said there was no man in heaven found worthy no man on Earth found worthy no man beneath the Earth that ever lived and died was found worthy amen no man was found worthy the Angel's call was a call for the kinsman redeemer to appear God said I have a law a kinsman redeemer can can be a substitute where is that kinsman redeemer who's able to take it and it come from Adam all the way down through all the apostles and Prophets and everything else and nobody was found now what about that amen nobody in heaven nobody on Earth nobody that ever live Elijah was standing there Moses was standing there all the apostles were standing there uh all the ones that had died all the holy man job the sages everyone was standing there and nobody was worthy even to look at the book let alone take it and break the seal Now where's the pope and all these coming out where's your Bishop where's our worthiness were nothing right he asked for the kinsman redeemer to step forward if he could but John said no man was worthy not that there wasn't worthy people there now like an angel like uh for instance we'd say a Gabriel or Michael but remember remember it had to be a Kinsman remember John said here and no m n not Angel not sarapin they hadn't seen but they were in a different category they had never fallen but this had to be a kinsman redeemer no man because there was not a redeemed no man was worthy to look at it oh no my my so it took a human Kinsman and he asked for it and he wasn't found nowhere there's nobody no Bishop no Archbishop no Priest No hierarchy no nothing was even and didn't even have the Holiness enough to even look at the book amen my that's pretty strong but that's what the Bible say Amen I'm just quoting what John said amen the Bible said that John wept not as some people has taught it I hear a man teach this one time said John wept because and he found himself not worthy oh any man under the Holy Spirit was no different from that see under the inspiration of God but no different than that but John wept here's what I think he went for because if no one was worthy and could open this book of redemption the whole creation was [Applause] lost there is the book there is a title deed and it will be offered to the kinsman redeemer that can meet the qualifications that's God's Own law and he can't defile his law can't defile law see God required a kinsman redeemer who was worthy who was able to do it we had the substance to do it and the angel said now let that kinsman redeemer step forward John looked he looked all over the Earth he looked benath the Earth and there was nobody am their creation and the everything was lost of course John went everything was lost his crying didn't last but just a minute of Hallelujah the N took one of the other said don't weep John amen hallelujah praise the Lord oh this Cryme didn't last for just a minute hallu John thought oh my where is the man there s of prophets this born like I was there stand stages there say holy to nobody here I want a man that's able to do it I want a man that can redeem and he wasn't found so John broke out everything was lost and he wept bitterly and he he was sad cuz everything the whole creation everything was gone if they couldn't find somebody glory to God if they couldn't find somebody that can meet that requirements there every human being of the whole world and creation was gone PA everything had fallen the the the rights of redemption the rights of of eternal life uh the light all these rights have been forfeited and there was nobody who could pay the price and John started crying because no one was worthy and no one could even look at the oh it took the Human Being John we because no one could do it and everything was lost and there came a voice from one of the elders standing amidst the four beast and all that great host of Heaven said don't weak John oh my grace of God don't be brokenhearted John don't we for the lie of the tribe of Judah the rud and Offspring from David he has vailed prail means rational work can overcome the garden of gean blood dropped down out of his face he was overcoming the line of and the root of David has prevailed has overcome like uh uh Jacob the supplanter and when he got in contact with the angel he held on and the angel tried to pull away he said I'm just not going to let you go he held on until he got what he wanted for and his name was changed from supplanter which means deceiver to what to a prince with God Israel he prevailed and this line of the tribe of Judah Prevail he said don't weep John for the line of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed he's already overcome he's done it it's over John hallelujah praise the Lord he produced a [Applause] beach Glory that sand sent on back to the greasy hands that the with his wisdom that defiled it the human being yes but when John turned to look he saw a lamb what a different from a line he said the line has prevailed see again I could use that there God hid in Simplicity he said is a line that's a king of the Beast the line has prevailed the strongest thing there is is a line I've laid out in the jungles in Africa and hear the uh the giraffe squealing and the Great Mighty elephant with his trunk in the air we we we and hear the the the Savages of the desert screaming out their bloody curle cries and the The Beatles to and Billy Paul and I laying in a little place covered over with stickers and hear way off in a distance a line Roar and everything on the desert shuts up even if beetles stop har the king speaks I tell

today I believe God bless you brother random and now today I want to read some scripture uh just a minute from the holy sacred word of God found in the book of St Luke the 23rd chapter of of St Luke the basee get a a platform of what I I want to say a basic thought on the thing that I want to speak on and uh you're turning now to St Luke the 23rd uh chapter and I want to read one verse that's all I need for this basis this morning to place it up on now we read the 20 uh 23rd chapter the 33rd verse of the 23rd chapter and when they came to the place which is called Calvary There They Crucified him and the malif factors one on the right hand and the other on the left now I want to take four words out of there out of that reading to base what I want to say there there They Crucified him four words and I'm my subject is called uh I'm bringing an indictment uh to the denominational churches of this day and Al so many of The Independents for crucifying Jesus Christ aesh in this day inditing them this morning it's called the indictment and I want to kind of use it more like it it was like a room of a courtroom where there was and after all the pulpit and the church is a courtroom the Bible said it's a judgment seat at at must begin at the house of the Lord and this is like the the throne and the and the jury and the witnesses and so forth and I have today for my witness is God's word and my indictment is against the churches of today now I I'm not bringing the sinner into this I'm just speaking this to the church and it's it's to be in the tapes now and uh I try to get through as quick as I can I indite this generation for the second CR crucifixion of Jesus Christ and now to do this in this age that we live in I I do this I'm must show an Evidence if I have to bring an indictment you have to show an Evidence of the criminal offense that has been done I I have to indict them I I have to bring the the evidence to prove it that it is that what I'm saying will stand up before the main judge which is I take myself as an attorney uh on this indictment that the word of God being my witness I indict this generation for the crucifixion I'm must show and will show uh that the same spirit is on the people today that brought the first crucifixion and doing the same thing I I must do that if it's going to be a crucifixion that they've crucified I'm must show to the the people that the same attitude in the people today is doing the same thing spiritually that they did physically then they crucified physically Jesus Christ the son of God and now today by the same word and by the the same Holy Spirit and the same word I I wish to show the churches their their where they stand uh that they are doing the same thing today and the Bible said they would do it and prove that this is the day that we're living in it could not been done a few years ago I say 50 years ago it could not have been done but today this is very timely and it could not have been done maybe 10 years ago but it can be done today because the the time is run out we are we are the end time and I believe as his servant that we are we're just about to cross from this land to another therefore the time for repentance for a nation it's gone I believe that this nation cannot repent I believe that it's cross the line between mercy and judgment I believe she t Ling in the bounds brother brandham before you start your case how you going to prove that just this that we're guilty of the same sins that God destroyed the World by in the Andel luian World we're guilty of the same sins that he destroyed the world in Sodom and gomorra and now and we got all the same spiritual evidence laying here before us all the same spiritual evidence worldwide known that brought down the mercies of God upon those Generations that also to reject brought judgment so if this generation has rejected the same Mercy that was spurn in them days God would be unjust to let them get by without judgment and Jack Moore a friend of mine once said if this nation gets by without a punishment from God then God to be obligated to raise up solom Gore and apologize for burning him up now we know that spiritually they're doing the same thing today for they are doing it to for the same purpose and in the same way that they did in the crucifixion of the Lord physically they're doing it because of jealousy because of spiritual blindness that they don't want to see they won't listen to it Jesus in his journey here on Earth he said well did Isaiah speak of you you got eyes and can't see and ears and can't hear the same reason the same um the same purpose and the same reasonings they're bringing the crucifixion of Christ a new aresh as we'll get to it after a while for the same reasons that they did then they cannot find nothing against it they're Dar to try to challenge it and they know the evidence is there and they know the Bible says so and the only thing they can do is blaspheme it exactly so and all this the same reasons now upon all this bases I challenge thisgeneration of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ for a crucifying and guilty with dirty Wicked selfish denominational hands has crucifying the Prince of Life that wanted to present itself to the people you say the same person in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and manifested itself the word was manifested in flesh and they condemned the Flesh and put it to death because the word was manifested Hebrews 13:8 said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever it's the same word amen and for the same reason they are trying to crucify the word now to my text to break back upon the subject that I'm want to take there the four words let's explain there there the most holy city in the world Jerusalem there the most religious city in the world there they the most religious people in the world at a religious feast the Feast of the Passover there the most religious spot the most religious City the the greatest of all the organizations the head of all of it there they the most religious people people in all the world had gathered from all over the world They Crucified the most shameful death that could be kill person could be killed naked stripped the clothes from him he he despised the reproach the the crucifix has a a a rag wrapped around him but they stripped his clothes from him the most shameful there the greatest religious City they the most religious people crucified the most shameful death him the most precious person that ain't enough to condemn this generation there the most religious organization the biggest of all the churches gathered together in one place they the most religious people of all the races the people who are supposed to be the very worshippers of God they gathered at the the greatest holy Feast they got the cleansing of the the Passover when they was brought from bondage into Liberty and there in that time they at that time the most religious people in the most religious feast at the most religious Place brought upon the Prince of Life the most shameful thing that could be done to strip a man and to hang him on a tree because cursed is he said the law that they worship by cursed is he that hangs upon a tree and he was made a curse for us stripping his clothes beating him and mocking him the very God Of Heaven taking his clothes from him and nail him to AC cross him there they crucified him under Roman capital punishment the most shameful death today would not be shot the most shameful death today would not be to be uh uh run over by a car and killed drowned by water burned by fire but the most shameful death today is public capital punishment where that the whole world condemns you and calls you guilty and the whole world put their hands upon this man and called him guilty when he was innocent and he died under the enemies not his friends not his laws but under the enemy's crucifixion the Prince of Life the most precious person that there ever lived or ever will live Jesus Christ him the most precious person keep that in mind now as we build that platform around today could you imagine at a place like Jerusalem where for 2500 years or more that the people or hundreds of years I maybe a little long than that might have been about 8 or 900 years or something I don't know it's how what the distance in time Solomon built the temple I imagine about 800 years something like that and they' look for a coming Messiah they had gathered there for the worship of the Passover just think of it now the head of all of the Pharisees Sadducees and what have you one great Gathering to worship God Most Holy Place Jerusalem the Temple of the Lord and the people of the Lord took the Lord himself and crucified him with capital punishment such a thing now then four words they there they crucified him now you so so the Bible you see it's just four words but the Bible condenses its truths now me I have to go way around and explain what I'm talking about but the Bible don't have to explain nothing it just it's all truth so the the the Bible don't have to explain anything it it it doesn't have to explain it because it is all the truth here is four words of its great chain of Truth I'll try to explain it and to try to explain it clearly would make a library there's no way for me to explain those four words but now let us by the help of him who caused it to be written try to explain these four words to bring it in such a way that people would understand it what we got before us now we got the first crucifixion laying before us at the most holy place the most religious people the most shameful death to the most precious person oh it's such a cont contradictory my my it's disgraceful now let's take first the first word there let's talk on it a few minutes before we bring the indictment we'll break this down and show you what they was doing then we'll find out if my indictment is correct or not there Jerusalem Most Holy simple place because the temple was there the most holy place because it the temple was there and Jews from all over the world gathered to this one place of meeting grounds uh for worship the most greatest place for worship that there was was at Jerusalem the temple was there it's it's written all men ought to worship at Jerusalem all right because it's a center of worship and today you hear them one of them wants to say they all we come to these great conventions where these uh denominations have it and and then we we have the the opening of the the Vatican City and and these ordinations of popes and so forth everybody says we all ought to go to the campgrounds of the Methodist or the the Bible Baptist convention or are we all art to go to to Rome and there were the Great Center they call of Christianity during the time of the last war when Rome fell these German soldiers many of you boys know about this them German soldiers got back up into the Vatican City there and firing out at the Americans as they were advancing brother Funk and brother Roberson and many brother beer and many of those Brethren who was in that war knows and you know what we issued orders that they could not fire on that City Americans you stood there and you was a Target to them but at the West uh the West Minister uh Abbey at the in England you could fire on that all right that's where the Protestants gathered so it was all right to fire on that but not to fire on the Vatican because as president uh Roosevelt I heard his speech when he when he broadcast it that night called the Fireside talk he said when Rome fa he said it's such a shame because Rome is the head of all Christian ity could you imagine a Protestant saying that so the great Center of Christian religion well we're going to we're going to place that like Jerusalem if you wish to if you'd like to do that let's put that at Jerusalem the head of all these other the the the sanadrin and and of the Pharisees and of the the Sadducees all of them went up to Jerusalem that was really the headquarters and in the organizational life you you've got to admit that Roman Catholic Church is a mother of all of it she sure is and it started from Pentecost that's where they got to when they organized now we the Protestants are just little sisters off of that church and now let's say it would be there at the Vatican today or there at Jerusalem as it was at that day when all men ought to come to Jerusalem work worship why did they do it in the days of Jesus why did they say all man should worship at Jerusalem for there's only one place that God will fellowship with man that is under the blood of the sacrifice that's the reason they had to come to Jerusalem God will never meet with man nowh else but under the blood when you turn the blood down then your meeting place with God has been taken away God made his first decision in the Garden of Eden that man would only worship him under the shed blood of the sacrifice and that's the only place that God met with man then and that's the only place that God ever did meet with man and that's the only place he meets with man today is under the shed blood of the sacrifice see I don't care if you're a Methodist Baptist Presbyterian if you can forget your differences Roman catholic whatever you might be and will come under the shed blood God will meet with both of us there that's where we can all meet and fellowship on the same ground but otherwise he will not meet just because you're a Methodist he'll not meet just because you're Pentecostals he'll meet with you under one condition that's under the shed blood when your sins has been confessed and expelled in his presence then by the blood and the blood is always before him and therefore he only can see you through that shed blood and you're white as snow when you've confessed your sins otherwise you're not there you cannot Fellowship that's the reason that you don't see things happening in the churches they confess that they believe the blood but they reject the very plan to get to the blood the word there's only one way God will honor that word you'll never honor that word come and say I'm a Roman Catholic I demand this to be done you can't do it Methodist Baptists are Pentecostals you can't do it the only way you can do it is under the mercies of God through his grace is to come through the shed blood of Jesus Christ say Lord I claim the promise then if you really are under that blood God's obligated to that word hallelujah But first you you got to be under that blood amen you see it now no wonder they can't believe in miracles no wonder you can't believe in the Supernatural no wonder they condemn it the same reason they condemned it back there is the same reason they condemn it today they're guilty as guilty can be because only under the shed blood and those who are dare some little brother who dares under humility to take God at his word and walk out there and confess his sins and and forget all these dogmas and things and stand there under the blood and believe it then they want to call him a fanatic they want to class him as we said it it's not a good word to use at the pulpit but so that you'll understand he's a Oddball after all aren't we all oddballs see the believer is an oddball to the unbeliever and the unbeliever is an oddball to the believer so who is the Oddball the farmer is an oddball to the business man the businessman's an oddball to the farmer see so who is he anyhow I tell you salvation is an individual affair with man and God Alone one individual searching out our own salvation with fear and trembling and I know no other basis as a teacher this morning or as a minister from Christ than to lay it down upon the word I cannot place it on anything else now we find there then that only under the blood the god met the worshippers so they met at Jerusalem and Christ is God's provided lamb of sacrifice and today there's only one place that God will meet man and that's under the blood of Jesus Christ anywhere else it is condemned God will never hear it you might do all kind of emotions and all kind of isms and shake and jump and have blood and fire and smoke and everything else but as long as that life isn't compared with the word and God thoroughly identifying that life then there's no need of trying it because you're out and God will never meet it till it comes under the care of that blood that's right so you see in the scripture we've got a Jerusalem the church has it's in heaven a Heavenly Jerusalem where God is God and today it's not under some Creed or something that we try to make make it of Jerusalem we'd like the methodists like to like to make the the Methodist headquarters of Jerusalem the Catholic like to make Rome and and the different places where we have our headquarters we like to make that a Jerusalem but the Bible says that our Jerusalem is from above which is mother of all the Believers now and Christ is God's provided lamb notice how appropriate it was now showing it that Jerusalem had was ceasing when it was in effect until that hour the blood of the Lamb was all right until that day but now at the crucifixion it changes the old system is done there was a new one and the the lamb was at the sacrifice the lamb the sacrificial lamb was on the grounds that they were condemning and doing the very thing there that they had to do it's right God be blessed for seeing this wonderful Heavenly light in this last day because the churches is doing the same thing today until the hour that organization religion is condemned and proved to be sacrificing Christ word and then on comes the word and the word only from the old Pascal lamb passed away and Christ become our lamb at the day of the crucifixion and the day that the denomination crucified the word of God and accepted a Creed in the Ste of the word that's the day the word come into full effect that's just been recently notice secondly first there Jerusalem secondly they they who the Jews the worshippers think of it the worshippers themselves was killing the very one they they claimed to be worshiping could you imagine such a thing as intelligent man that were priest that were trained that had doctor's degree till it probably there they had to come out of a certain generation before they or tribe before they could even be a priest they had to be Levites their fathers as priests their grandfathers as priests their great great great great great grandfathers is priest and they had to live such a consecrated life the one IOD against them they'd be stoned no mercy was granted holy certainly but self-made Holiness had to act like that to show their face for their Church inside of them Jesus said you're full of Dead Man's Bones how I could bring an indictment right there man who know that to be the truth this word to be the truth and will compromise on it to show a face before some organization I have a right to indict him right upon God's word notice they the worshippers the man who had looked for the promise the man who had looked for it to years and ages and with nothing to do but in that constant Seminary but they had divided the word according to the teaching of the Seminary and they had missed the very truth of it they the priest the ministry of that day there at their headquarters they the ministry of that day was killing the very God the very lamb the very one that they claim they were worshiping they were killing and today I indict this bunch of ordained ministers in their Creeds and denominations they're crucifying to the people the very God that they claim that they love and serve amen amen I indict these ministers in the name of the Lord Jesus upon their doctrine that claim that the days of Miracles is passed and the water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ is not sufficient and not right upon any of these words that they have substituted Creeds for I indite them as GI guilty in the blood of Jesus Christ upon their hands are crucifying aresh the Lord Jesus the second time they are crucifying Christ to the public taking from them the thing that they're supposed to be given to them and they substituted something else in its place amen a church Creed for popularity there they they the one who ought to have know better if anybody should have know better it should have been their ministers if anybody should know better it should be the clergy of this day if anybody ought to know the the the Bishops and archbishops and and ministers and doctors of divinity are to no different but why can't they what a contradiction what have we got before but a a contradiction they claim that they worship God and they're killing the Prince of Life they there they crucified him and here they again do the same thing for he is the word that's what is only a reflection of the word and that's what he is today a reflection of the word trying to find somebody to reflect himself through and these people keep the congregation away from God and and if there anything happens and is spoke of in the congregation they condemn it from the platform from the pull pit and say it's fanaticism stay away from it and doing so they crucified Jesus Christ in 1963 and are just as guilty as those guys at the that day that's an awful statement but it's the truth upon that's exactly what they do today and upon this grounds upon the grounds of crucifying Christ upon the grounds of taking the word and taking it away from the people is exactly what they were doing there the very word that God was reflecting through his own son to prove it was and the one that they claimed that they love the Jehovah that had manifested himself by the scriptures done exactly what he said he would do exactly what God said he would do and reflected it before because the love of their Church groups and things like that they condemn the Prince of Life and I condemn the same group today and indict them as guilty before the God by the word of God that they're doing the same thing this generation is indicted remember he Hebrews 138 he's the same yesterday today and forever how did they indict him because that their Creeds would not accept him and down in their heart they know different didn't not Nicodemus in the third chapter St John well express it Rabbi we the Pharisees the preachers the teachers we know you're a teacher sent from God for no man could do the things that you do unless God was with him they publicly witnessed it by one of their renowned man and to because of their Creeds they crucified Christ and today there's not a reader that cannot read acts 238 is same as I can read it and the rest of it is the same as I can read it but because of their Creeds and because of their denominational tickets that they got in their pocket the marks of the Beast that they're packing around as Fellowship cards and taking those things they crucified to themselves Jesus Christ the fresh and crucify him before the public and blaspheme the very God that promised to do this bringing damnation upon the race there there they not the sinner they that is the Church of that day they found fault with the man who was the word is that right they found fault with the man who was the word now they find fault with the word working through the man they just Vice ver Versa which is in the person that's the holy spirit is working through is God's Vindication how do they know he was Christ because his Works prove what he was he said which one of you can condemn me of sin if I haven't done just exactly what the scriptures said I would do and which somebody tell me where I fail somewhere if I hav showed every sign of that I am the Messiah that I'm the very one that you promis said they said well we have Moses We Believe Moses said if you would have believed Moses you'd believe me if you Moses seen my day and desired to to live in this day Moses seen a far off in the prophets and here you are living right by and can said you Hypocrites said you can discern the face of the Skies but the sign of the time you can't discern amen there it is a sign of the time what did he class him a fanatic a crazy man yeah they found fault with the man who was the word he was the word St John first chapter proves it in the beginning was the word and the word is with God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us he was the Living Word of God because he was expressing God through himself he was so completely to surrender to the to the word of God to he and the Word was the same and that's exactly what the church ought to be today that the word of God is the same how can can you be part of that word when you deny practically all of it and the reason it's none is not because the people that's the reason I think God spoke to me about calling his people the Ricks and ricettas it's because of these selfish denominations has got those people living out there in the way they're living They Crucified the truth and the people call it a blasphemy and they make it blasphemy rather they call it fanaticism and so forth and not knowing that they're blaspheming the very God that they go to church to serve therefore I indict this bunch of clergy today andite this generation in the name of Jesus Christ under the authority of God's word you are crucifying him again notice he's the same yesterday today and forever God's word of Vindicated in a man compare the two calvaries and their acquisation remember because he made himself God we will not have this man rule over us what was the acquisation that they could find in the council that morning uh when crucified Jesus that he made himself God he was God and he broke the Sabbath and he was the lord of the Sabbath they condemned him because that he made himself God you have no right to do this you have no right our high priest if anything is coming come through our priest now compare that with the calvary today when God had so pleased the father God the spirit to raise up his own son overshadowed the Mary by the Holy Spirit and brought forth a body that could serve him and serve his purpose to he the God was in Christ the fullness of the godhead bodily in him reflecting what God was to the people letting the letting the whole world know what God wanted each individual to be a son and daughter he took one man and did did it and because that he didn't jar with their organizational ranks they condemned him and crucified him now compare that Calvary with the day because of organizational Prejudice yes because of indifference between Scholars who ought to know God's word and plan because of this God can take a little group of people that he can work through somewhere and reflect self who will humble themselves to the word and they cannot say it isn't so they could not say he didn't do it for their congregation was witness of it it was before them they couldn't deny it they couldn't deny his claims because the very word that they said they believe was the one who proved that he was because God took the word that was supposed to be the Messiah and show it to a man and had to get rid of him so the only way they could go on was get rid of the Messiah and they did it to blindness and ignorance regardless of their education they were smart intelligent worldly speaking as we compared the other night when the light struck the rich rung ruler look what he did he rejected a smart man Paul another smart man the light struck him what he do he accepted it he forgot all he ever know that he might know Christ that made his life worthy of the Gospel last Sunday night's message there it is today it strikes maybe some little a man has went off had a call of God he felt went to some Seminary and learn some Creed he must live by that Creed or give up his Fellowship card if he does he's black marked nobody else will have him because once he belonged to something else and now he don't belong to it they figure there's something wrong with that that man and they will not have him in their congregation when the congregation are only looking for one sign that is if he believes what they believe if he's got a card if he's a Methodist if he's a card he belongs to another fellowship or Oneness or trinitarian or whatever it might be Church of God or in the Pentecostal ranks all those ranks if he packs a card they feel that the headquarters has uh looked him over and tested his mind and give him a psychiatrist test and see if his IQ was high enough and he can speak before him if you don't they turn him down that's right but you see the congregation ought to be watching the hand of the Lord see whether God's giving his ordination or not that's what we ought to be looking at Hallelujah but today they crucify the the the Son of God aresh when a man is Able by the grace of God be called of God to let God reflect himself through him the works that I do shall you do also he said notice what a day that we're living they they take they they take the the very Calvary we can this morning and the very reason now they know that was truth but because of jealousy Prejudice what did Jesus say to them if I cast out Devils by the Finger of God then who who do you cast them out by let them be your judge if I by the Finger of God cast out Devils now it's like you heard him say can you prove it's a finger of God I'd like to I'd like to heard that question asked they were too small for that notice because that he made himself God and he was God and we will not have him rule over us but now the thing the same old cry comes again that Bible was written by man they say we don't have to live by that that's God's that's God's word it's God himself I talking to man yes I said well some man might have wrote that Bible I said yes it was his name we know him as God it was Wroten 4,000 years apart almost the scriptures back from Job all the way to the New Testament and wrote by hundred by by and hundreds of years apart and was wrote by different man and them not knowing the other and different parts of the country and not one word of it will condemn the other right I dare anybody to come under the blood of Jesus Christ and claim any promise in there God's obligated to take care of it but they won't do it they'll come say oh Lord I want to do something give me a great gift Hallelujah Lord glory to God I believe I got it Hallelujah it'll never work you might bring forth a lot of psychology but it won't work God's got to recognize that repentance God's got to do that we could say a lot along that line but I hope you're you're understanding look but now now they won't have the word rule over them I say every one of you return back you're baptized wrong you're baptized in the Catholic Church who are you to tell us that it's not me it's a word well I tell you we we believe I don't care what you believe it's what the Bible says well we don't have to live by that you do not or you're under the Judgment of this Bible for whosoever shall take one word out of it or add one to it the same will be Tak out of the part of The Book of Life Let It Be Minister clergyman whoever he is you've got to come under the rulership of this word for it is God the Bible says it's God we won't have it rule over us they take their Creeds and the nominations and their little petty things that they believe in has been adopted by councils of man and take it instead of God's word what did they do they tuck a Barabas a murder instead of the Son of God at the day of the first crucifixion and today they're taking some man's word which is a lie in the way of death in refusing to take the way of life God's word I condemn this generation and died in the word of the Lord that they're wrong they're guilty of crucifixion or trying to Hallelujah crucify the spirit they call for a Revival everywhere how you going to have a Revival when the word itself can't work to the people I'd like for somebody to answer that for me how can it do when you deny the very Revival itself amen well did the prophet speak of them forms of godliness their own forms back there denied the Word of Life their own Farms today deny the thing that can bring them a Revival their Creeds and Farms yes sir they take the denomination and their Creeds instead of the the word and that crucifies his word and makes his word of no effect to the people when they see the word of God so vividly in just Place itself that God made a promise he would do this and here he is doing it and they make fun of it and get away from it it's blasphemy and they try to crucify the word itself how do they crucify it they can't crucify the word no more they could crucify God they could crucify the body that help God the Son of God they could crucify that but they can't crucify God he had to be that time on account of being the sacrifice to bring in many sons that's predestinated to eternal life they had to do it then but they can't do it now they can't do it for the word itself will live on but they what do they do how do they form what are you saying that preacher how you building your platform here that they crucifying there they are crucifying the effects of the Gospel upon the people by their Creeds amen that's a crucifixion that were the public set these big margs called churches denominations and draw a line of creed and that had the word of God can't have an effect upon it because they they condemn the very things that Christ said would take place it just don't come according to their Creed and neither did Jesus come according to their understanding of him coming he coming the way that God sent him and he come exactly with the word no he said he hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and reveal it the baby such as would learn Hallelujah do you understand oh they have crucified the effects of the word I got a bunch of scriptures here I might just quote to a three of them they crucified you say how do they crucify the word when Jesus said that he's the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13:8 they say in such a way he is all right and the Jesus said his last commandment to the church go go ye into all the World Mark 16 go ye into all the world and preach the gospel these signs shall follow them that believe all the world to Every Creature it ain't half reached yet and his millions die every year that don't ever even heard the name of Jesus so it's still the general orders it's still the Commandment of God all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth in his baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues if they take up serpents or drink deadly things it shall not harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover and they say that was for that generation and they make the Commandment of God of not effect to this and they crucify the effect of the word to the people amen Peter said on the day of Pentecost with the keys to the kingdom that Jesus had just given him whatever you you say here I'll say it up there and on the day of Pentecost they asked what they might do to receive the Holy Spirit if they was so enjoying it watching others acting uh what they would call uh silly stagger and jump and fall and AC like they were drunk and they said these men are full of new wine but there was a man stood up by the name of Peter who had the keys to the kingdom and said these are not drunken acts two as you suppose since the third out of the day but this is that which is spoken of see right back to the word again showing that the spirit is still word the word is still Spirit yes the word of God and it shall come spoken by the prophet Joel Joel 238 and it shall come to pass in the last days sayith God I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh listen to that Prophet standing there look at him Fearless standing there upon that bunch and condemning them indict them said this is the scripture this is that that was spoke of by the prophet I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy all my hands maids and Maid servant I pour out of my spirit I'll show signs in the heavens above and on Earth fire and pillars of smoke and Vapor proven it by the word that it was the word and they laughed and made fun of it and they went to judgment and the city was burnt and they eat one another's children and today there scattered people throughout all the world showing the Holy Spirit Still Remains the word of God to bring this word to make it live Jesus Christ was the person man God hallelujah amen he was the manifestation of God he was God in a body form to reflect the word of God for that age to make that age see God's promise for that age and the Holy Ghost ghost is the same thing today it's the spirit of God upon the written word trying to find somebody to reflect itself to this age to prove that he's the same yesterday ver St John 14:12 The Works that I do shall you also Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and forever see constantly trying to find its way to reflect itself and they could not do it the people thought so much of their denominations their little Nest that they had and so forth call their churches so they wouldn't listen to it so do the do it today same thing crucify aresh Peter on the day of Pentecost he said you men that dwell in Jerusalem in Judea hearken to my words these are not drunk if you'll stand still I'll show you what it is and he goes ahead and explains to them well their hearts is pricked when they heard this so what can we do to be saved what can we do to receive this we're convinced that your word is right he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for this is to you and your children them as far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call this is what they got to do repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and today the Roman Catholic Church adopted father son Holy Ghost to take that place instead of that a communion lick out a tongue and take a wafer and the priest drink the wine and you're one together the communion instead of being the Holy Ghost called Holy Eucharist and a father son Holy Ghost a trinitarian baptism was not even spoke of in the Bible amen amen the name of father son Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ and when you show that to this honored generation as Peter said save yourself from this honor generation when you show it to them what do they do make fun of it and say our church don't teach it that way then you're guilty you're guilty of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ by taking the power of God away from the people you crucify the very word to them and you condemn yourself with your congregation lead him into a death trap as I said about that Minister last Sunday as Martin Luther King down there with them precious people leading right into a death trap oh somebody could only talk to that man wish I could just for an little uprising of a school proposition see it's somewh different my goodness if the people ain't got hard enough to associate with a man because of his color they're condemned and dead anyhow the nation gives right don't fight against it don't what if somebody said all the Irish or somebody all the German or somebody else had to dissociate that would never bother Christians that move right on and that man's a Christian is is a minister he shouldn't lead them people into a revolt against that they're going to cause Millions to die it'll start another revolutionary and it's a shame to do that the same thing happens right here exactly the same thing again that's right see the people how that they'd only look at truth and see what truth is our church don't believe that we got some other way well it ain't the right way it ain't the thing he said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins now they won't do it oh then what do they do now that's just one thing upon hundreds we'll get to maybe as fast as we can now the second crucifixion then if a man accepts Father Son and Holy Spirit a a Creed instead of the word titles instead of the name what does he do to the people he crucifies the effects of the word to the people when he says that Mark 16 was just for that generation and God said himself right there Jesus talking to him said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth in is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them how for every nation every Creed every tongue every race every people the same gospel and these signs shall follow them that believe and when a man tries to cut that out of the Bible he crucifies the effects of the Gospel to that congregation amen hallelujah so I indict you in the name of Jesus Christ you're guilty of murdering the Lord hallelujah the church hated him why he was their very God they hated him and denied him to be their Messiah no sir they didn't want such a messiah as that and today the church does the same thing it denies the word they don't want it it's contradictory to what they've been taught to believe by their Creeds amen and the word is the Messiah you believe that well the reflection of the word then is what amen a reflecting a messiah which is the Holy Ghost Among Us he's reflecting himself try not to where he find a lamp that he can look through it ain't smoked up with Creeds and things he can give light through remember they Rose and Trimm their lamps and washed out the chimneys but it's too late so when a man sees these Lutheran Presbyterian methodists trying to come in in these last dayses to receive the Holy Ghost why you know they don't get it that's right oh they might speak in tongues and jump up and down but Watch What Happens they absolutely it's a Time sign that she's over we're at the end most any time the the church can hear the challenge to come on high amen amen just exactly setting us in order the Holy Spirit here making Jesus Christ a reality through the ones that he can work to proving himself come down takes his picture shows it makes Science Tech talk about it everything else proving just exactly what he said he would do doing exactly the things he said he would do scripturally not not some Creed or some man's worked up idea a lot of blood fire and smoke and stuff but a scriptural Messi evidence got a lot of impersonations and impersonators and and so forth but that only makes the real word shine its best right that's people who are spiritual who can judge between right and wrong Lord see denies him denied their Messiah we didn't want him the same thing they do today well if I had to go down there and act like that bunch I don't want it at all all right then you don't have it at all that's all same now although he was properly identified they didn't want him they hated him why was it we call their pastors a bunch of snakes he said you bunch of whed walls you're nothing but a graveyard the outside of his polish was roll and turned around collars and the insides Dead Man's bom he didn't pull no punches one little bitty Galilean a carpenter son but he didn't pull no punches he told him don't think John said the Forerunner of said he's another didn't pull any punches he said don't come around here saying now you got Abraham to our father God's able to these stones to rise children Abraham yes sir the axes laid to the root of the tree and every tree that don't bring forth fruits HED down and cast Into the Fire yes sir God is strict and firm and Stern with his word yes sir notice Jesus proven by the scripture do you hear me Jesus was identified by God through the scriptures that he was Messiah is that righten we get to Peter's indictment a few minutes you'll find out where it was WR he was thoroughly identified that he was God manifested in a man called the Son of God that's right although he was properly identified and Vindicated the promised word that he was Messiah Moses said this Messiah when he comes he'll be a prophet and all these things will take place the little woman with the stand at the well and all that dirty condition that she was what did that symbolize that God in these last days would pull out Outcast remember last night at the wedding or the other time I preached here at the wedding supper you s how they said I've made a great feast and so forth and all these men I bit them and each one had an excuse I can't do it because it would ruin our Creeds I can't come because I have a uh uh married a wife she won't let me come my I I got married to a church down here my mother was Methodist or Baptist or Catholic or I just can't stand for that he said and you won't come and you won't taste my supper but get out there and compel prostitutes and harlots and drunkards and whatever there is bring them in I'll straighten them up Hallelujah I made my supper and my guest my table setting there going to be somebody [Applause] there they didn't come it's condemning them Jews what about today I I belong to the Presbyterian I can't Lutheran I'm a oness I'm a Tess I'm a this I can't I can't there you are you won't be there thenen that's exactly what he said all right properly a Vindicated Messiah properly a Vindicated the word the promised word the god that promised the word that this what the Messiah would be here he come and stood exactly and he said to him now word have I failed if you can't believe me as a man believe the word works that I do for they are the things that tell who I am they're the ones that says I'm Messiah you don't want to believe me because you think of Joseph over there and I was born over there and that little Hut and and my uh Foster father here is a a carpenter down there and and you when he come into Galilee there they and was going to make he said here who is this fell who is this well this man isn't isn't Jo and all them his brothers here isn't his sisters with isn't mother called Mary and his daddy called Joseph where to get a guy like that what school did he come from he has no Fellowship card he don't have any credentials where did a guy like it where'd you get this in anyhow and the Bible said he was a is offended he said many mighty Works he could not do and just turned his back and walked away from him he said a prophet's not without honor except is among his own people in his own County watch or in his own country there he is properly Vindicated the Messiah took no credit of his own he said I can do nothing but what I see the father doing and he challenged them to ask that that was the Messiah and look at that little old ill Fame woman she recognized it she she wasn't document the lamp she was morally wrong of course no one would endorse that the laws of God condemn that she was morally wrong but she see God don't judge you uh upon your what you are he enjoy he judged not how big you are how little you are he judges your heart what you want to be and she didn't want none of that stuff when just flash before that's what she wanted Hallelujah no matter what she was then she's ready to come amen God judges the heart man judges the outward appearance God looks upon the heart no matter what she was that light flash that settled it she caught the the the the essence of eternal life oh my how Rich this is to me to see and know that it's the truth I I'll stand by this I let the god of heaven will raise up in my voice will be on the Magnetic Tape of God's great time H Earth and it'll condemn this generation in the last day it's on magnetic tape then to be on the Eternal tape then try condemn this generation of preachers who has a form of godliness and denying the power of the word and manifestation when it's properly identified that he still Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I indict them by the word of God I have to get to another promise quickly cuz you only got about 15 minutes there they there they what oh Calvary They Crucified thirdly They Crucified him not by recognizing God's PR promise word made manifest and why did they crucify that man could you just imagine let me go back a minute why would them people crucify a man like that as Mary as I read a book one time called The Prince of the House of David is wrote by Ingram Dr Ingram wonderful booket of drama supposed to be partly true of some old manuscript is taking off of a woman named Adena at her she went over to Palestine from from down in Egypt Cairo I believe it was to finish her education she was there during a time of of Christ and she's spons right back to her father it'd be good if you picked it up and read it it's really good uh Prince the House of David the same man wrote Pillar of Fire and out of that Cecil de Mills tuck The Ten Commandments now we find it in this book this Adena wrote back and she said on the day of the crucifixion that Mary magalina Bon Hood he cast out Seven Devils run out before the crowd and said what has he done what what has he done only heal the sick and Tred to deliver those that were in prisons what has he done but good somebody said and a man slapped her Plum across a yard almost and said would you bed that silly woman before your priest there you are see what had he done done nothing why they crucified why why because they didn't recognize who he was that's the same thing today the preachers and people of this days and our modern teachers has so indocumentadas day sign the churches if you don't belong to their organization they'll say oh well that's some makeup that's that's a hoax we look down here so and so and so and so but let them one time prove the real thing to be a hoax let them one time prove that it's wrong they can't do it right it's never been known to be wrong and it never will be because it's God but they like the point they think oh well if it was some a man with a great name because it's a little group a little Bunch it's kind of outcast well we turn that person out of our church he they they used to come to our group see but they went over with this and they went over that now they see they want up well look what it is who it is I don't care they could said the same thing about Peter James and John or ignorant an unlearned man they said but they had to take notice something that happened since that time they had been with Jesus that's what made the difference they did it because they didn't know who he was they didn't know that the Vindication of God's word wasn't standing up there in that day now it wasn't one day that was right it wasn't one day just keep them laws and things but the same laws that was they were to keeping pointed them to a time that when he would come and be this man that he was supposed to be they had this part but didn't take the other part and that's the same thing they're doing now they got a church and they believe in Jesus Christ and say they're doing things but deny the hour we're living in still brings the old proverb back again man always praising God for what he has done looking forward for what he would do and or will do and ignoring what he's doing and being condemned by amen they think God's wonderful how great he is what going to do he's going to come and be a Rapture someday go home and deny the very signs and wonders right here at the time that the scripture says that he'll be doing it Miss the whole thing if the blind lead the blind Jesus said they'll all fall in a ditch let's pray God to open our eyes in this last stage all right now the same they do the same today they deny and crucify the same God today but not knowing him the same by denying him and doing by denying the things that they're doing today they don't crucify Christ again exactly but they blaspheme the Holy Ghost and by doing it they are how do they blaspheme the Holy Ghost how how did they blaspheme it that back there why they couldn't blashe it then hadn't come yet they called Jesus be elub called him be elub because he could know the secrets of their hearts and things he said this is a devil in other words he's a fortune teller that's how he does this is by fortune telling he's nothing but a devil see they had had a prophet in 400 years and done grow out of it see they just had their laws they said this is Bey about and Jesus said I'll forgive you for that but when the Holy Ghost has come now you speak a word against it and it'll never be forgiven you remember it will and cannot by no means no mercy when you blashe and call the spirit of God the word of God that's being Vindicated by the spirit see the word says so the spirits are vindicating it and you call it an unclean thing you've crossed the line between mercy and judgment and can never be forgiven for it that's the reason I di this generation of guilty of crucifying blaspheming the manifested Son of God amen hallelujah amen as is Promised for all the prophets and Christ himself to be in the last days like it was in the days of Noah in the days of Sodom blasphemy which they crucify to the people the Son of God of Flesh he is a Vindicated word one word against it can never be forgiven now what are you going to do then why are you going to stand there condemned just waiting the hour of God's Wrath to be poured out you come on loving doctrine of man made the denominations and dogmas better than they do the Vindicated word of God this generation of people oh I I just wish I had a long time for this this generation of people this generation sperms God's revelation am but we're walking where the apostles have tried God you say well others say that too God vindicates it Jesus said if if if the works don't speak of me then just go ahead say I'm saying it myself but the works speaks you better believe the works because it's the hour said you know tomorrow the sun's going to shine or it's going to be foul weather but the skies red and L tomorrow be fair said you can discern the face of Skies but the signs of the time you know nothing about if you would have known God You' have known my day and they said you take so much upon yourself you make yourself God and he put him on the cross and the Holy Ghost today is not no third person it's God himself manifested in human flesh by the blood of Jesus Christ to sanctify a life that he might reflect himself through and they crucify that same word made manifest you understand am the crucifixion of Christ today is the people who will deny the Vindicated and manifested Son of God Among The People by his things that he said would take place in this day by his word than now the same Vindication would have to be the same if he's the same Son of God because he said in St John 14:12 now that the works that I do shall you do also Hebrews 13:8 is same yesterday and forever if ye abide me John 15 if you abide me and my words abide in you just ask what you will it'll be given to you yes sir remember they were very religious people that did that they wasn't Outsiders they were the religious people of that day that's what's doing it today is the religious people same crucifixion same thing today quickly There They Crucified him then sure then they were rejecting God's word made manifest accepting their Creeds instead of the word is that what they're doing today exactly doing the same today he was the word and they rejected the word that's one point I want you not to miss I want you not to miss he was the word and when they rejected him they rejected the word and when they did reject him they finally crucified him and that's what they've done today reject the word of God and accepted their Creeds and is crucified publicly before their congregation the working of the Holy Spirit and they're guilty and I di him in the name of Jesus Christ 15 years I've seen and all God's people say amen he said they did not recognize the word they did not recognize their day I trust that you recognize this morning what God is doing then now today and in the future I do believe brothers and sisters we should sing about the blood and that it will not lose its power a couple of things he said here I wanted to just mention before we do do that you thankful for the word this morning amen I'm thankful for the Revelation that he gave to [Music] us we certainly are grateful for it this morning he said God doesn't judge upon what you are he
