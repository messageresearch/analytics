with us tonight I'm sure brother Israel would have put you to work my brother but we're going to finish this tape tonight but it's sure good to to see you God bless you only believe only only believe all things are possible yes only only only all things are possible oh be let's sing Jesus is here oh my Jes Jesus put it everything under the blood tonight when Jesus is here all things they are possible Jesus is here oh my Jesus is Jesus is is here all things are possible Jesus is here God bless you you can be seated 15 years I've seen him move across the land and still they hold theirs you're guilty they took the word that would have brought the church all the churches together and made a great big Union Brotherhood amongst Pentecostals and all the rest of them instead of doing so they rejected it and turned it down made fun of it and called everything out and now by a Federation of church through the devil's plan trying to come in and say now we'll come by some oral they're rejected and it they're guilty of crucifying Jesus Christ amen you take it on God's terms or your terms won't work they rejected God's word made manifest for their Creeds and they're doing the same today he was the word John St John 1 Hebrews 138 says he's the same yesterday today and forever now they are crucifying him aresh did you know the Bible said we could do that how many like to read just a little bit will you give me another 15 minutes of it all right let's turn over now just a minute uh crucified aresh let's go over to Hebrews the 6th chapter and read just a little bit Hebrews the 6 and see if we crucify the Son of God AR fresh see if it can be done you say you can't crucify him second time we find out where we can or not God's word's true is that right Hebrews 61 therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection not into the laying of foundation of repentance and dead Works um and of Faith towards God and of doctrine of baptism laying on our hands and of the resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment this we will do if God permits see Paul wants to know that these things here are absolutely essential baptisms laying on a hands Resurrection second coming all these things are Eternal they're absolutely the truth now notice for it is impossible read it with me this one verse I want you to read it with me now the fourth verse for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted of the good word of God and the power of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing that they crucify to themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame is that my word or his a man who comes to a knowledge remember they never got it they were borderline Believers after we have receive the knowledge of the word of God you get it from a knowledge from reading and seeing it and then rejected then you it's impossible for you to ever be saved am do you read that now am have received a knowledge of the truth just you understand you never got it it's like them uh Believers that went out it's a very type of the journey this this this Third Exodus is just a type of the rest of them look look back there let me show you something now just a minute pardon expression look Israel pulled out 12 men one out of each tribe denominational head and took them over to the age of the border the promised land and showed them the good things to come what they had and they come back complain meaning that we wasn't able to do it but there was two out of the 12 Joshua and Caleb said they looked at the word God said it's ours and we are more than able to take it is that right what was that barline believer see they were actually BN in the church they were heads of the people they were Bishops as to say they walked right down to where the word of God was shown to be the truth there is the land they never been there they didn't know it was there but they come down to see it was there there it was and Caleb and Joshua went over and brought back a a bunch of grapes and let them eat some of it and they tasted of the good land and then went back and said we can't do it see we just can't do it here's the same group in the time of Jesus Christ Rabbi we know thou art a teacher come from God see borderline we know th are teacher come from God no man can do the things that you do we recognize that God has to be there why didn't they accept it why didn't they take it borderline borderline here they are on this Third Exodus same sign same manifestation same Christ same Holy Ghost same Works same God same message and they can't take it they'd have to give up their Fellowship card what is it he had a knowledge of the truth they looked and seen that it's absolutely the truth they can't deny the magazines has to testify theyve seen it the pictures the papers the evidence the resurrection of the Dead the doctor statements of the sick they have to say that's him and the predictions not one of them ever failing down through the years every one of them just exactly on the dock amen they can't say but what it's God but they can't accept it a bunch of ministers in Chicago 300 and something of us going to come down be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ where they at the price is too great they can't do it what is it the Bible said when they do that what do they do they separate themselves between mercy and judgment for it is impossible for those that were once enlightened has been brought to look at him amen and had a knowledge of the truth and have tasted of the good word of God yes if they return away from it or they have to renew themselves again say well now I will yes you Presbyterians you methodists and Baptists and Lutheran and this Full Gospel businessman stuff saying they're coming in turned away the message your church WIll these individuals in there sure but not the church you have come out of the church to get it right individuals is all right but when you think the Presbyterian Church is going to receive the Holy Ghost and all them take their documents down don't you never think that you think you methodists is going to do it you'll never do it you think you trinitarians ever receive the name of Jesus Christ and be baptized every one of you you'll never do it you'll never do it but individuals will come out and do it that's right that's the satom is coming but them churches who seen the truth and rejected it in their councils it's impossible possible then they're guilty of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and I indict them by the word of God that God is how do you indict them brother Brandon I indict them that God has clearly identified himself in his word in the last days and made himself to know that he's still the same yesterday today and forever and they've coldly turned it downen Lord and you're guilty of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ by blaspheming the Holy Ghost that's right that's right we take you on to Hebrews 10 again where it tells us again in the scriptures not only being impossible but you can never separat you from God eternally you can never come in the presence of God again when you turn down the Holy Ghost and make fun of it now see if tasted of the word see borderline Believers oh you say them guys wasn't believers they was Believers yes or professed Believers but when it come to the word they were Israel they come out under the blood they come out under the signs of Moses they had seen those signs working God said I'll take you over Yonder and when they come right down to the principle of the promised word that was to come what do they say oh we can't do it see and here they come back with grapes and everything to prove the lamb was right God's word's right God said I give it to you but the circumstances my said we look like grasshoppers upside of we can't do no matter what a few years ago in this old Hull stood your as a tabernacle somebody come in walked out talked to me he said Billy you're going to preach to four post one of these days with messages like that I said I'll be preaching to four post because God's able to imp poost to rise children of Abraham it's the truth I said if you got something that you can disprove it let's have it hallelujah it's long a crow but when he comes to a place to show it that's different amen yes that's what makes a difference all right yeah with their Creeds they crucify him aresh now Hebrews the 6th chapter and we go on down we can just read on down on down in through here we got plenty of time I marked out a scripture here um where will be Hebrews the 6th chapter is I guess take it all impossible for those who were once tonight and made partakers of the Holy Ghost we haven't got time to go too far because got another scripture I want you to read just in a moment notice this they crucify to themselves the Son of God aresh what do they do what by having a taste and knowing as the truth and then turn around and denying it yeah what do it's impossible so that's what this nation has done that's what this people has done that's what these churches has done they've turned it down and they've crucified the message they've crucified the truth to the people how they do Jesus they put him to shame stripped his clothes off of him hung him up on a cross and nailed him up there the Prince of Life the same thing they've done today with their creeds they've done the same thing they stripped the things they stripped the the goodness and the clothing of the Gospel by trying to place it somewhere else and hung him on the cross oh my why there they there they crucified now the last quotation him him this most precious person why did they do it they didn't know him why are they doing it today they don't know this is the truth they're they're dumb and blind of it they don't know it that's the reason their Creeds and traditions has gotten them away from the word of God Amen not to you he just in closing I'll pay close attention I know it's hot I'm hot too oh brother this word amen it's life if you hold to it look it's not something we talk about and may happen here and after it's something that's already here with us and happening now not something will be something it's already we're not testifying we know what he has done we know what he's going to do but now we're telling him what he is doing this is our hour we may not live to see the Rapture I may die today you may die today I don't know but the Rapture is coming that's that's when that comes we'll be there don't worry sold all the rest of them back through the ages has believed it look for they walked in the light of their day and here is the light Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever forsake your Creeds and believe this word this is the truth the word is truth Jesus said my word are Spirit my word is life how you go to receive life when you reject life how you go to take in a Dogma which is death and a Word of Life turn out the word of life to take death how you go to accept the twoth at the same time you can't do it let every man's word be a lie every Dogma a lie God's word's the truth amen I challenge any man to show me anybody and I know this tape goes around the world any man any Bishop Bishop that'll come to my study or before this congregation and point their finger to one place anybody was ever baptized in the name of the father son holy ghost in the New Testament I'll show you where every person that ever was baptized and those who are baptized different had to come and be rebap tized to get the Holy Ghost amen what are you going to do about it stay out there in your Creeds stay out there in your dogmas and die you're guilty Wicked hands you took the Prince of Life The Word of Life and crucified it to the people now what did they do they didn't know it today man walk ignorantly they don't know that's the truth they think it's some kind of ism they don't dig down deep enough to get into the spirit of Revelation they don't pray enough amen they don't callau up on God enough they just lightly take it oh well I believe there God sure the devil believes the same thing the devil believes it more than some people claim to be the devil believes it in trembles people just believe it go on but the devil trembles knowing his judgment is coming and people believe it and don't pay no attention to the judgment's coming guilty of crucifying him sure I indict this generation finding them Guilty by the same word that found them guilty at the beginning that's right Jesus said who can condemn me he was the word made flesh and today the same word made flesh Peter said in his indictment in Acts let's just read it Peter when he saw this taking place what they had done the spirit look Peter was defending Christ what they had done I'm defending what the gospels are H Peter was inditing there for killing the man Christ who was the word I'm indicting this generation for trying to kill the word which is made manifest in man watch what Peter said his righteous indignation must have rose up pretty highly listen at him here in Acts the 2 chapter and begin with the 22nd verse ye man of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth approv a man proved of God among you by Miracle signs which God did by him in the midst as of you as ye yourselves also know imagine how they felt listen to that ye man of Israel the prince ye Church man you holy man you priest you man are supposed to be man of God here these words Jesus of Nazareth was approved of God among you I say to you clergymen and to you people Jesus of Nazareth the Holy G ghost he's here in the person of the Holy Ghost amen which was the life that was in him he's here working through people and declaring himself by signs and wonders which he does and here they hang around on the walls scientific identification and people sitting here that was dead is a living today and cancer eating or well today blind are seeing today and crippled that are walking today amen praise the Lord he's Jesus of Nazareth him being delivered by the determined counsel and the for knowledge of God predestinated for his job ye have taken and by Wicked hands you have slain is that con is that indictment he's indicting what that Sanhedrin Council I'm indicting this morning the Federation of churches I'm inditing the Pentecostals I'm inditing the Presbyterians the Baptists every denominate nation of the World by Wicked selfish greed you took the word of life and crucified it before the people and blasphemed it and called it fanaticism which God has raised up in our midst to prove that he's the same yesterday today forever this generation hallelujah amen God has proved himself alive God has proved that this is his word what have you got but a bunch of dog and Creeds where can you show the Living God because you've turned down the word of life that would have give you these things yes sir oh what an hour that we're now living in same oh I call Peter said you've tucked by Wicked hands and have crucified and slain who God raised up having loose the Pains of death because it was not possible you should be holding of it and through your Creeds and your organizations and your denominations with your form of godliness your forms of godliness you've denied the power of his resurrection but the hour has arrived the last days are here when God promised according to Malachi 4 that he would raise up in the last days and would turn the hearts of the people back to the original blessings and the Pentecostal faith of praise the Lord and you can't deny it and you can't withstand it God and then I condemn you guilty and challenge you and indict you before God that with Wicked selfish denominational hands you crucified the word of God before the people and I call you guilty and ready for the Judgment amen yes sir I call the same thing Peter did he called repent repentance of that generation I call repentance to this generation repentance towards God and come back to the original truth of the word come back to the Faith of Our Fathers come back to the Holy Ghost because God cannot change it when God said these signs shall follow them that believe he has to stay with that all through eternity it's his word when you say shake hands or take communion or something like that or some on that Creed or something on that idea that any man any drunker any unbeliever can do it any impersonator any pro prostitute can do that take communion have farms and things like that you could do it but Jesus said this will be the identification these sign shall that they maybe they Willen and all generations to them that believe my name they'll cast out Devils they'll speak with other tongues speak with new tongues and take up serpents drink deadly things won't harm l their hands on the sick they shall recover heal the sick raise the Dead cast out Devils as freely as you receive freely give all this big money-making schemes and things are hooked up in things today no wonder that's a full of judgment yes sir oh my let's see now yes sir call to repentance my inditing now in this new Calvary is the the church soall most holy places great pull pits Catholicism alar Catholic aler call their Pulpit the methodists the Baptist the Presbyterian the Lutheran the Pentecostals the most holy places there he receives his heartest pierces a new Calvary where is it found at in the Holy place is the church where is he crucified at from the pastors you Hypocrites you know better than that not angry but something inside him is stirring God's been thoroughly identified among you where did he gets his Spears at in his side where did he get his pieres on Calvary where does he get today in the Pulpit where did they come from Jerusalem where did they come from the denomination the ones who claim to Lov him that's who did it that's who does it today his second Calvary where he receives his pierces against the word that's what pierces him who is he he's the word he is the word where does it pierce the hardest from the pulpit in the holy places just like it was then I've got a right to indict this generation I got a right to do it as a minister of the Gospel of Jesus Christ with these signs and proving that he is God I got a right to bring indictment against this generation because his hardest spear points has been right from the pulpits where they've criticized and said don't go out to hear that stuff that's of the devil right in the place is supposed to love him and the Very signs that Jesus said would take place the world of God is sharper than a two- aged sword or a discerner of the thoughts of the intense of the heart and it's called the devil where from the pulpits amen the holy places oh God how can he look down just just Mercy that's all Grace we can't do nothing else but head for judgment we're already there think of it his hardest pierces comes from the pulpit that's where his new count cies at they crucify him the word at the pulpit that's right how how they do it by their Farms of godliness exactly Crown from the audience the scoffers he got a new Crown of Thorns scoffers pierced from the pull pit crowned by the scoffers is he crucified again aresh stripe the man-made Creeds teachers of denomination against his word they stripe it shame condemn it Jesus said in vain they worship me in vain don't do no good who do they worship they worship that same God they is worshiping that same God at his first crucifixion yeah and it was vain worship it's the same thing today in vain they build these denominations in vain they build these seminaries in vain they have these Creeds teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of man and denying the word of God you're guilty of crucifying the Prince of Life teaching man's doctrines for his word in vain they worship me striped pierced crowned when you see that go down the street some of you lady long hair say she's oldfashioned isn't she remember that's scoffers that's a crown that you're wearing God said it was your glory wear it with pride hallelujah praise the lord we with pride you would wear a crown of thorns for your lord Hallelujah wear it with pride don't be ashamed he said so no matter what these Jezebel says today what these impostor stand in a pole pick crucifiers of Christ no matter what they say you wear it with pride God said so you keep it crown with scoffers again Thorns pierced from the pull pit with Creeds he got a new golgatha where they take him to these Ro choirs short wearing women bobbed haired painted face singing in the choir like angels with talents that's his new golgatha just modern strip teases protected by a law like in Sodom gamor you see a little female dog go down the street at certain times there's not a male dog even go out where she's at let a certain thing happen every one of them going run after her there's something happened to her you know why let watch these women take off their clothes far and go down the street don't tell me it ain't the same thing it's an identification don't condemn the man but they're protected by a Sodom law that Lord I say it's you know lawful for them to be out there and preachers in the pull pit ought to have pen coats instead of the clergy Co standing out there and were permitted and ashamed to speak against it because denomination put them out you crucify to the the congregation the word of God which says it's an Abomination for a woman to wear a garment that pertains to the man I I condemn the thing a a accus of crucifying the word of God before the people bobbed haired women short wearing in the crown stand up in the quoir some said to me the other day some woman asked me said well where do you think you'd find I said if the Lord asked me to pick a dozen out over the world I'd be I'd be scared to death and by the discernment of the spirit stand there and watch them and stand like that and see them things over the dirty filthy low down cigarette suckers out there carrying home like that and standing in a robe choir and sing in that condition and let the audience see and there say well she can do what I can too a Christian Life is a life of Holiness and Purity and amen praise the Lord Hallelujah I them in the name of Jesus Christ for their filth and dirt they have brought the gospel to a disgrace and those who try to hold it or call call that's oldfashioned nonsense i d in the name of Jesus Christ just modern strip teas is on the street singing choirs cigarettes smoking tell dirt dirty jokes three or four husband after the sixth one and then singing the choir because he got a voice you poor intellectual spiritual deprived rejected upon your own ground you read the same Bible any other man can read but you've turned down the spirit of God to the Bible said you'd be given over to a strong delusion to believe a lie and be damned by you actually believe that you're right and the Bible say that You' believe it and be damned by the same lie that you believe to be the truth therefore I indite you by the word of God you're teaching of people era and crucifying the principles of Christ of Holiness and life above a poor person might walk out on the street and be a different person preacher standing on Ball Ground smoking cigarettes stumbling box all the other Tommy rot that they put up with women in their choir wearing shorts bobbed hair and carrying on like that painted faces and then call it sister this and that and the Bible condemns that stuff try go to parties and carry on still a member of the church maintain your testimony and live any way you want to don't think I'm talking all together about Presbyterians I'm talking about you Pentecostals right you once knew the truth but you thought you couldn't take it you couldn't support your Pastor your your pastor couldn't have that big job with so many hundred a week in a big fine Church to preach in and ride and carry on the way they do if he condemn that the organization would throw him out to he has to keep it he has to say it therefore he sold his birth rights for a mesop poage of the world of Esau's SLO and once he go to get F both fall into the ditch of condemnation and be B them as prostitutes of the Gospel am I was at a choir one of the famous big places not long ago one of the highest ranks of Pentecost that there is I have be sitting in this brother study one of four or five choirs got together and one of some of the finest organizations of the Pentecostals and they didn't know I was in this Minister study at Oklahoma I was sitting down there below where this Minister studies before he comes to his platform and what it did there was them little Ricky out there and Rick edas paint not a one of them had long hair every one of them with bob hair every one of them makeup on every one of them with robes on and little Ricky standing around there going along like that and another man was taking up a missionary offering he act like he a blind man with a cup and going around saying all kind of blasphemy things about taking up the offering and things like that but got out there and tried to sing the um the Messiah oh man it could do a pretty good job at it but it didn't have the ring no it was dead see oh my there you are that's his new gol gotha why do you think it's some little girl or some little woman in there well if she' come in there dressed like she should have been with long hair and paint on off and things like that they' have made fun of her if she have stood up and when is making that D do there that bunch of young people about 30 or 40 of the selected part of Pentecost and doing things like that if that little lady would have said something about there put her out of the choir let the gospel preacher stand in the P pit and say something about they put him out the organization you crucify the Son of God of frh and put him to an open shame his gospel that you claim to preach you're crucifying I indict this Christ rejecting Generation by the word of God hallelujah and by its power of this last days of vindication that he is still alive yes they are against the Clean Cut Vindicated word of God there organizations can't stand up to it big churches and denominations is this new Calvary I say it again this their modern strip teases are their choirs the high priest of each denomination cries out like the high priest of that day now come down and show us a miracle that was the first crucifixion it's a same today I've had him say Well now you raised the dead do you w't you go up there you got a wife in the graveyard got a baby up there they said to him we heard you raise the dead we got a graveyard full of them up here come raise it oh ignorance will breed ignorance big churches big choirs high priest to this day come down show us a miracle our denomination can't do I had a man not long ago made a remark on a after a little broadcast I had Jonesburg Arkansas telling about some woman being healed this fell belonged to a certain denomination of church and he got up behind there and said I challenge any man to bring me and show me a miracle I went and got a doctor a man had been cured with cancer went and got a woman been in a wheelchair for about 20 years she was healed of arthritis in a wheelchair I Tu it over and said now I want the money

take a razor and cut her arm and then you heal it before our Brethren they'll give you the money I said you devil if thou be the Son of God come come off of this cross tell us who hits you with a rag around his head hit him on and said now if you're a prophet tell us who if thou be the Son of God come down off the cross blind leaders of the blind they need mental healing a man to do a thing like at or make a remark like that certainly The Familiar old cry oh let us see you do a miracle Master we would desire a miracle from you when every day every hour is happening right along just as God would lead it to be done but they wasn't present if they was they called it be above the devil Master we desire if you do it the way we want you to do it that's it go where we want you to go do what we want oh yes they had no strings on him no sir that's the reason we had to get him out of their midst yes sir they're trying to do the same thing today and through the Federation of churches they'll finally accomplish to do it all of them going The Familiar old crime here we see again the most religious place the best polished theologian calling out again and against him calling out the very best theologians which ought to know different the very highest churches and best trained theologians cast him out of their midst they don't want it you say that's wrong brother bom then you wasn't here to see the church AG as you he it preach you wasn't here when this lady of seeing Church age was the only one that they cast him out of the church and he's out the outside knocking trying to get back in they cast him out because he haven't got no use for him they crucify him AR fresh amen how long could we go remember the prophet of God's word for told us in second Timothy 3 if you're writing it down we haven't got time to read it but said that in the last days scoffers would come they'd be he High minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God false accusers incontinent Fierce and despisers of those that are good tray headyy highminded scholarly having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away for this is a s that takes silly Bob haired women short wearing painted faces from place to place lead him captive said exactly he said turn away from it in the last days let's obey the prophet turn away from those things in the last days de here I'm calling to the church now yes sir get away from it they have they the Ministers of this day should know these things they should have know Jesus and his days they should have know and now they should know it but they don't know it just as the Jewish teachers of his days should have known him by his day so is it today of God's clearly ad Vindicated word then he was the word and he proved he was the word he proved he was the word for that day and God is proven today that he's the word of this day the light of the hour and they should have know it then and they should know it Now They Crucified him then and they crucify him now I died him of it right just keeps flashing through me D them CU God's going to make them pay for it the Jews of their days God again in the days on Earth Jesus said Jerusalem Jerusalem how off would I have gathered you in one great big group but you would not how God has tried in this last days and unite his people together but you would not you've desired your Creed so now you're given over to destruction that's what Jerusalem received she is tore down burned down she's no more and that's exactly what will be some of these days to all these big things your your big Creeds and denominations will die and perish but the word of God will be eternal and live forever his deepest wounds come from the house of so-called friends think think of it think of it stop I'm waiting a minute ministers think of it where did his wounds come from the house of his so-called friends amen as it was so is it think of it at Calvary he wasn't surrounded by by Savages barbarians but of ministers who claim to love him and today when the gospel is Thoroughly identified when the Great Signs of his resurrection is proven Among Us it isn't the street out there that jumps on you it's the so-called ministers them exposed to love him is what he's surrounded by today we'll not have that thing among us we'll not have this man rule over us we'll not support we'll have no cooperation about that in this city if that thing comes this way it's nothing but spiritualism it's the devil not knowing the word of God the blind leading the blind as it was then think so is it now just as it was and so is it now think his power to heal and to set man and woman free from the love of this present World from the bobbed haired painted Facey Jezebels that calls themselves Christians and producing such a life as that cigarettes smoking dirty joke telling sit down and have a missionary society and Stitch and sew and talk and Scandal and and get out on the street and wear shorts and everything like that and then call themselves Christians before other women that's right you remember my story about the slave knowing he was a son of a king his character what art we to be men and women and deny these clergymen these pull pits where he gets his pierces they po up and endorse that kind of living amongst the people or they piercing they deny the power to to set him free from it and they endorse it to be so when it's a contrary to the word of God for a woman to Bob her hair or to paint her face or to wear shorts it's contrary to the word of God but they endorse it making another Calvary from where from the street from the barroom from the pull pit amen ppit and again what was the cry He makes himself God they denies his deity they try to split him up make three or four Gods out of him when he is God he was God he'll always be God amen the same yesterday today and forever when you talk about one God to them they laugh at you we believe in a Holy Trinity I believe in one holy God hallelujah his power to heal to set free and take these people out of the love of the world to free them like it did Mary magdalina remember she was a little painted up Jezebel too she had Seven Devils in her she's a strip teas just like the modern woman on the street today go anywhere you want to look if you want believe people bows it's a shrine of naked women look out on the street today as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be look out if you don't believe it just go anywhere open up a paper open up a magazine look at a billboard what are you find remember what it said when the sons of God saw the daughters of man was Pharaoh they taken un them women look at the scandal in England look at the Scandal here look at the whole thing become a house of prostitution yeah why is it why why did Russia become communism because of vulgar and dirtiness and the non-power of the Catholic church that's exactly why this nation is taking over communism and the Federation of churches and Jing itself up with the Catholic Church which Communism and Catholicism will unite together you know and here they are doing it why because they have rejected the gospel it separates them and makes them a different people exactly the reason and ministers in the P pits putting up with it for a meal ticket for a social standing of some Creed say I belong to so and so swapping education for the power of God free them from this mad race like Mary magdalina the very power that could take that little strip teas on the street and make her put on clothes and act like a lady make a Christian out of her they condemn that power and crucify the man that had it at Calvary and today the very go goel in the Holy Ghost that'll take that little strip tease and make her dress like a lady and act like a Christian they call it fanaticism don't mixed among their congregation get us stirred up among them cause other women to do it what do they do they as it out just like they did then and now they crucify the very word and say it was for another age and died him again yes sir than just the same as it is and died then the sign that made old Legion put on his clothes remember a person that takes off their clothes are crazy how about a woman Legion was crazy he stripped his clothes off of him goduck his power and made him put his clothes on his clothes in his right mind sitting down at the feet of Jesus look at the power that made old blind Barney mayus to see right among their Creeds he was on the earth when just much unbelief as there is today but it never stopped him he went on he didn't pull no punches for him he told him you're your father the devil he condemned the whole thing the power that can raise Lazarus out of the grave and gave the woman of naan back her son oh God the power that could do those things that could foretell the things that happened there's two cult cult tide of two ways and all these things that he foretold the very man that possess that power away with him we won't have him among our people he pollutes our teachings and they crucified him the very same thing today away with the Holy Ghost they don't want nothing to do with it it condemns and does these things and tells our people these things we don't want to get mixed among our organization is against our Creeds they crucify him again oh my notice now as we're closing got the close and again they call it fanaticism and they called him a fanatic they said he was crazy anybody knows that the Bible said that Jesus was the Pharisees said this man is a Samaritan and he's mad now why is the word mad mean crazy the man's crazy there a bunch of crazy people follow him he's bbub and again to say the same thing it's a sord of Witchcraft it's fortunetelling placing him again on the cross of Shame what cross what shame is a Vindicated word making fun of it telling the people it's the devil making something call he said they calling the holy works of God an unclean Spirit doing it no forgiveness part making shame of his word trying to expose it and call it a fake or fanaticism don't go to it don't attend that meetings are they do doing that they take their denominational Creed Nails that's right these pleasure hunting teachers worldly ungodly denominational mad take the denominational nails and crucify the Son of God with it aresh from their pulpits amen why do they do this they love the Praises of man the degrees that the church can give him more than the love of the word of God I condemn them they can't conform to the world because they're can't conform to the word because they're already conformed to the world they've all read the hypocritical day that we live in is not this is not one Calvary enough for my Lord why will you do this you the supposed to love him you that knows this is his word you can read Revelations the 22nd chapter and say whoever will take one word or add one word why do you do it isn't one Calvary enough for him amen I stand in his defense I'm his attorney iite you by the word of God change your ways or you'll go to hell your denominational a crumble I Indi you in the presence of the judge you your Farms of godliness hypocrisies why do you call it in one Calvary enough as Peter said your denominational fathers Peter Andi you by the said your which of your fathers hasn't done this Stephen's done the same thing with Wicked hands you've crucified the Prince of Life didn't Jesus say he which one of your fathers didn't put the prophets in the tombs and you garnish them afterwards so has it been through the righteous man down Through the Ages so do I indict this High polished churchgoing bunch of Christ rejecting people of this day you with your Farms of godliness Crucify My Christ the second time by telling the people that these words are for some other day and it isn't for this day I indict you your guilty of the same crime that they was on the day of the crucifixion repent and turn to God or perish and again I say here the churches they the teachers crucify by blasphemy him the word God be merciful let me say that again it might have been mixed up on the table here the churches they the clergy crucify by blasphemy him the word no wonder it's again mid rendering rocking darkening Skies My Savior B his head and D but the opening Veil revealed the way to Heaven's Joys and endless day amen I say on this tape and for this audience I say this under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost who's on the Lord's Side let him come under this word God will surely bring this wicked Christ denying Christ rejecting generation into judgment for blasphemy the crucifixion of his identified word amen you're coming to the Judgment I indicted who's on the Lord's Side said Moses let him come unto me when the pillar of far hanging there is an Evidence Hallelujah who's on the Lord's Side let him take up the word deny his Creed follow Jesus Christ daily and I'll meet you in the morning let's bow our heads now for a word of prayer oh Lord God The Giver of eternal life the author of this word who brought again from the dead the Lord Jesus who properly identified it before a generation of unbelieving people it's been long this morning many is set here the church is packed people are standing around and the tapes are being made to go out across the world into different places ministers will hear this in their study I pray for them Lord let these words fall deep into the heart cut deep cut away all the world that they might say like this little Methodist Minister down in kenty came to me the other day and said when I was here in those seven Church Ag and I heard it cry out get away from them walls of Babylon said I give it up and left I don't know which way to go or what to do but I left blessed be the courage of that young man the wife and two three children God May many find their way to the word of God the only way of life for he is the word I pray for each one father sometimes in seeing these things it's not in cruelty it's in love because love is corrective Hallelujah and I pray God that the people understand it to be that way that it is meant to be corrected you who had to correct them prayed for them at the cross saying father forgive they they're blind they they just don't understand what they're doing I pray for them ministers today who's crucifying the word again by taking their Creeds and denominations and dogmas and substituting it for the word of life and then before the people they they criticize the real truth that God is vindicating to be his truth we pray for them Father that you will call them to the married supper again and may they come this time and not find excuses or I realize the last call may have already gone it may be too late now I trust that it's not bless this little congregation present here these few hundred people that's gathered in here this morning this hot day set here for a lengthly maybe two hours or more service and listen they haven't left they sit still and listen many of them waiting their dinners and the women standing with their babies and they're waiting they're holding on on to every word Lord I realize what will happen to me at the day of the Judgment if I mislead those people I'm conscious Lord is conscious that I can feel that I'm trying to take them to the word and let them live by the word telling them that you're the same yesterday day and forever that the great holy spirit is Jesus Christ just in the form of the Holy Ghost the same man you said so a little while in the world sees me no more yet you'll see me for I'll be with you even in you and I know know that this is you Lord and we believe you because we see you do the same thing among us we yield ourselves as today soberly we do here in this congregation and on the tapes Lord just at this minute May every man and woman boy or girl who's who's here present or standing outside or hear it on the tape may we at this moment make a deep Consecration and yield our complete self to this service of God move upon the audience Lord EMP power and heal the sick they said they had a little boy sitting over here let that great Holy Spirit we know this to set in his presence like this is it'll do it if you can go through radio and television out through the lands and heal the sick you sent your word and heal him you can do the same thing at this minute I pray God that you'll heal every sick person ever crippled ever Afflicted hearing hears these words God granted my prayer is for them with a with a love of Christ in my heart and a feeling for the needy I present them Lord to you upon the altar of sacrifice where the bloody body of that lamb lays as a propitiation for our sins and sickness laying there I plead for Mercy for the people I want to stand as Moses did in the breach for them Lord and say God be merciful for him to him a little longer and give them another chance don't don't do it right now Lord let let the gospel go just a little further they're they're condemned Lord I pray that your great mercy and Grace will will extend to the last person that's got their name on the book and I know they will it's not hard to pray against your Divine word against or against the with the Divine word I mean to say Lord the word that's promised the word that's been Vindicated the word that predestinated these people back there before the foundation word it's not it's not hard to to pray that you'll save those whose names are on the book because I know you'll do it Jesus said so all the father has given me will come and no man can come unless he's been given now I pray God that everywh these words fall both on tape and present here that the holy spirit will call ever predestinated person just now from the foundation of the world when their name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life may they hear the voice of God speaking today in that little still Small Voice down in their hearts saying this is the way walk in it granted father I ask it in Jesus name and while presently we have our heads bowed here in the audience if you believe this to be truth and you you I B put my hand up on these handkerchiefs laying here and packages for the sick and The Afflicted I want to ask you a question sincerely now I don't come down here just to be heard uh uh I'm tired I'm wore out I'm not as young as it used to be and I and I know our days are numbered and I know I got to put in every little thing that I can or the kingdom of God I got to preach every time I get a chance I got to I got to go where I feel like it or not I come here because I I feel to do it I I want to do it I love you and I don't say things harsh and hard to to because I want to there there's a pulsation inside of me this very thing that's been Vindicated is a thing that presses me to do these things I say it kindly with love I don't mean to scold our women or our man I don't mean to do that brother sister I only mean to bring you to a a sharp place to where you can see the correction in the whip of the Lord that you must come in now don't put it off you might wait too long and you who desire to come on the large side with a full surrender in your heart in the presence in the audience now or either in the land where the tapes will be would you with your heads bowed don't raise your hands if you don't mean it uh if you really mean it you want to come to the Lord with a more consecrated life I want you to raise your hand right now you the Lord bless you you're consecrating

right now there's no room to bring people around an altar let your seat where you're at be an altar as many as believe while we pray heavenly father it's looked to me like that most every hand of
