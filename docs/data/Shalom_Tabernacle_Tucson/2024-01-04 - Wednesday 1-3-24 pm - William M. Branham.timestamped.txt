[9:39] me amen is that your prayer
[9:42] tonight amen that's our prayer amen
[9:46] we're going to listen to a portion of
[9:48] the message here uh Church order we
[9:51] listen to the one in
[9:53] 1958 this was preached in 19 uh 63 I
[9:57] believe the end close to the end of the
[10:00] year and um brother random will take
[10:03] part of that message tonight and I think
[10:05] it's going to be a blessing to all of us
[10:07] it it's always a groundwork for what the
[10:11] Church of the Living God should look
[10:13] like and I know every church is
[10:15] Sovereign and maybe our song service
[10:18] might go a little bit longer or we might
[10:21] not have two songs or three songs we
[10:23] might conduct ourselves you know as we
[10:25] grow in the Lord and what we need and
[10:28] what um we have available but this is uh
[10:32] what the prophet put on the tape that he
[10:35] believed was the way the Church of the
[10:37] Living God should be operated amen so we
[10:40] heard that in 58 and this is five or six
[10:44] years later after the Tabernacle was
[10:47] rededicated he had already preached the
[10:48] seals and here he's bringing Church
[10:51] order again and so as we prepare to go
[10:53] there um let's sing only believe before
[10:56] we do let's read a scripture and that
[10:59] would be found in 1 Corinthians chapter
[11:02] 14 like to welcome you all to the house
[11:05] of the Lord so good to see each of you
[11:07] and those that had to travel and you
[11:10] made it back safely God bless you
[11:17] amen 1 Corinthians chapter
[11:22] 14 and this is the Apostle Paul speaking
[11:25] verse 37 If any man think himself to be
[11:29] Prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge
[11:32] that the things that I write unto you
[11:35] are the Commandments of the Lord but if
[11:38] any man be ignorant let him be ignorant
[11:41] wherefore Brethren covet not to prophesy
[11:45] and forbid not to speak with tongues let
[11:48] all things be done decently and in order
[11:52] amen and and one of the messages the
[11:54] church order messages you know the
[11:57] Apostle Paul said the things that I
[11:58] write our Commandments one of the church
[12:01] orders brother bam says you let this
[12:03] tape be an absolute to you and you go
[12:05] back to this tape and so it's not the so
[12:08] much the writings of brother Brandon but
[12:10] the word the voice of God In Our
[12:13] Generation so we like to go to that
[12:15] tonight if it's ready I don't know if
[12:17] it's ready if I don't see the uh deal on
[12:20] the screen there amen praise the Lord
[12:24] and so let's sing only

[14:09] motion my head to you like that
[14:12] pleas my motion my head to you
[14:24] [Music]
[14:26] you Brethren we' called this meeting
[14:29] together here tonight for the purpose of
[14:32] knowing
[14:34] how that to operate the Church of the
[14:37] Living God which we believe to be a part
[14:41] of this
[14:42] church I want to first thing I want to
[14:47] say that in my
[14:50] travels around the world so far as I
[14:54] know this is one uh of the most
[14:59] spiritual places where you feel the
[15:02] spirit of God more than any other place
[15:05] I know I had two other places in mind it
[15:08] used to
[15:09] be but so far we we don't uh seem to see
[15:15] those places one of them has went into
[15:17] the
[15:18] organization and the other has U has
[15:21] kind of fallen so uh I was called
[15:27] yesterday and was has told me that you
[15:30] all want a meeting to ask me these
[15:32] questions concerning your duties in this
[15:36] church and I um that's what I'm here for
[15:40] tonight is in to to set the church or to
[15:44] give to you the things that I think that
[15:47] that is what's
[15:50] substantial to make this church to
[15:52] continue on Brethren I'm sure that you
[15:56] do
[15:57] realize that is I've made this remark
[16:00] about uh this being a spiritual place it
[16:03] isn't the biggest place in the world and
[16:05] it isn't what we have the most singing
[16:07] the most screaming and the most
[16:09] hollering or the most speaking in
[16:12] tongues and things that isn't it but
[16:14] it's the
[16:16] quality of the spirit that's operates
[16:18] here in this Tabernacle and so far I
[16:21] want to command and thank brother
[16:24] Neville and and you Brethren here
[16:27] trustees and deacons and Sunday school
[16:30] superintendent and all for for what you
[16:32] have done and helping keeping this us
[16:35] away it's been a long prayer a mind and
[16:38] a desire s a boy to see the church put
[16:41] in order and kept in order now we
[16:44] dedicated the church I told you a little
[16:47] later I had something to talk to you
[16:50] about how to set this thing in order the
[16:54] way it should be run and um you started
[16:58] off uh after leaving here we had
[17:01] ministers and so forth but now brother
[17:03] Neville being just young Among Us come
[17:06] Among Us I thought it'd be better for
[17:08] brother Neville to get better
[17:09] established in the faith before I
[17:11] presented such things as I'm about to do
[17:14] now but now after I find out that he is
[17:18] uh getting well established in the faith
[17:20] and understands what the doctrine is and
[17:23] and has uh played the part of a faithful
[17:26] witness to Christ and holding for what
[17:28] we believe to be the truth I think it's
[17:31] the hour now would be a good time to
[17:34] approach him and among you elders and
[17:37] things for the church that you would
[17:40] take these orders and remember them
[17:42] they're the best of my knowledge before
[17:45] God and then I'm looking to you to carry
[17:49] these things out the way that I'm saying
[17:52] because somebody has to be a head around
[17:54] here you have to have now I'm not trying
[17:56] to assur Authority or something like
[18:00] that but you see a man or anything with
[18:03] two heads to it it it doesn't know how
[18:05] to go God never did have two heads to
[18:07] his church he never did it's one head he
[18:11] always dealt in every generation as
[18:13] we've studied through the scriptures
[18:14] there's always one individual that he
[18:17] deals with because you get two men you
[18:19] got two opinions it's got to come to one
[18:22] final
[18:24] absolute and my absolute is the word the
[18:28] Bible and as a pastor here of the church
[18:32] my absolute is the word and I I know you
[18:36] are brothers you kind of look to me to
[18:38] be your absolute to what as long as I
[18:41] follow God as Paul said in the scripture
[18:44] you follow me as I follow Christ and
[18:47] then I'd expect you Brethren at any time
[18:50] that you see me to get away from this
[18:52] scripture to come to me privately and
[18:54] tell me or I'm wrong I don't care if
[18:57] you're one of the truste
[18:58] if you're the janitor whoever you are
[19:01] your duty bound to me as a brother in
[19:04] Christ to tell me when I'm wrong
[19:07] scripturally if it's a question let's
[19:09] sit down and solve it out together
[19:12] that's why you've come I suppose to me
[19:14] tonight brought me in here is because
[19:16] that there's questions here that seems
[19:18] to be questioning you in your mind for
[19:21] the things that I have have here I
[19:24] remember Brethren I don't know there's
[19:26] no name signed on any of these tickets
[19:29] but and they wrote and I can't don't
[19:31] know who wrote them but their questions
[19:33] that's on your mind and I'm here to
[19:36] answer them the best of my knowledge and
[19:38] remember God is looking to me to see
[19:42] that I stay in the word and I'm looking
[19:45] to you to see that you carry out the
[19:47] word see in this church and keep it
[19:51] spiritual for remember all the forces of
[19:56] of the dark kingdom of Satan will be
[19:59] turned against you as you begin to grow
[20:02] and the Lord and you must be
[20:04] soldiers not just fresh recruits you're
[20:09] age soldiers now have been trained to
[20:11] fight and Satan will come among you
[20:15] cause you to dispute with one another if
[20:16] you can turn him down just immediately
[20:19] you're Brethren and it's the enemy and
[20:22] we're here to hold a standard in this
[20:26] evening light time
[20:28] that when the world is darken and the
[20:31] whole church kingdom is going into the
[20:34] Council of churches and pretty soon
[20:37] they'll try to tack a sign on this door
[20:39] here
[20:40] closed then we're going to have to meet
[20:43] other places because they'll certainly
[20:45] close these churches one of these days
[20:47] if we don't take the mark of the beast
[20:50] and uh we're depending on staying true
[20:53] to god Till Death sets us free and
[20:57] that's what we we intend to do now
[21:00] straight to the and I would ask that if
[21:03] ever a time that any of these things
[21:06] come into question that this tape may be
[21:09] played before the members of this church
[21:12] at your meetings or prayer of the
[21:14] meeting just before the meeting starts
[21:16] turn this tape on and play it and may
[21:19] the congregation here understand that
[21:22] these men are Duty bound to God is their
[21:26] oath in this church to help hold these
[21:29] principles you may disagree with them
[21:32] and if I let you run it then I disagree
[21:35] with you we've got to have some Source
[21:37] somewhere where there's got to be an
[21:40] ultimate and best that I know I'm giv it
[21:43] under the Holy Spirit letting him be my
[21:46] ultimate and let this tape be your
[21:49] ultimate on these
[21:51] questions now the first one is how shall
[21:55] the church act towards calls for
[21:58] financial help uh uh for food and
[22:04] clothing
[22:05] what what act what what should the
[22:09] church do now we realize that the church
[22:14] is responsible for its own for our
[22:17] members here of the church we are
[22:20] totally responsible as far as we have
[22:23] needs to supply them with we are respons
[22:28] responsible for our own that's steady
[22:31] constant members of the Tabernacle come
[22:33] here and worship with us we are Duty
[22:36] bound to them as our brothers and
[22:38] sisters who have proven to be our
[22:41] members of this
[22:43] Gathering now we realize that there is
[22:47] millions tonight without food without
[22:50] clothing and we would love to be able to
[22:52] help the whole group of them to do
[22:54] everything we could but financially we
[22:57] cannot do that that we can't support all
[22:59] the world but we are Duty bound to our
[23:02] own and I think in that and then if we
[23:06] have anything left over that you would
[23:08] want to contribute to people who are
[23:11] not members here of this church
[23:15] something that you want to give to them
[23:18] it should be met between the the board
[23:22] of the
[23:23] deacons the deacons is the one that that
[23:27] has to meet this opposition or this
[23:30] problem rather because that in the Bible
[23:34] when the dispute come up about food and
[23:37] clothing and so forth in the book of
[23:40] Acts they call the apostles in about it
[23:43] they said go look out for yourself uh
[23:47] seven man of honest report and full of
[23:49] the Holy Ghost that they might attend to
[23:52] these things because we will give
[23:53] ourselves continually to the word of God
[23:56] and in prayer and it isn't the pastor's
[23:59] duty to look out to the for the food and
[24:04] so forth that's supposed to be by the
[24:06] deacons it isn't the
[24:07] trustees it is the Deacon's office to do
[24:10] this and then this should be remember in
[24:14] the Bible they was contributing to their
[24:17] own the Greeks and the and the Jewish
[24:21] where the argument come up that one was
[24:23] getting a little more than the other but
[24:25] it was people who had sold all their
[24:27] goods
[24:28] and given into the church for its
[24:31] support and then to to be divided out
[24:35] among them equally and there was a
[24:36] little dispute come up and there's where
[24:38] we got our first deacons and that's one
[24:40] of their duties is to do that I think
[24:44] that as our own as our own people uh we
[24:48] should take care of them and it should
[24:49] be turned in any complaint to the
[24:52] chairman of the deacon board and then it
[24:54] should be met by the Deacon board and
[24:57] see what they are able to do about it
[24:59] and all of those things which is
[25:02] clothing and food and financial help or
[25:05] whatever it is should come through the
[25:07] deacons then the deacons when they
[25:09] decide that they are that they are what
[25:13] they're going to do about it then it
[25:15] should be presented then unto the uh the
[25:18] treasure to see if the treasure is able
[25:21] at this time to pay this certain amount
[25:24] of Finance or or buy these clothing or
[25:26] whatever it is to that but the the
[25:28] Deacon board should meet on that and it
[25:31] doesn't go to the trustees or to the
[25:33] pastor it's a Deacon's thing alog
[25:36] together now then question number two is
[25:41] it s sufficient to say openly from the
[25:46] pulpit that tongues and
[25:49] interpretations should be done in a
[25:52] meeting before the service that's the
[25:55] second question on this uh slip of paper
[25:58] that I have here which is a little card
[26:01] now this would be uh pertaining to the
[26:05] pastor here see because he after all
[26:08] over the spiritual part he's the head of
[26:11] that deacons are a policeman in the
[26:13] church to keep order and to take care of
[26:15] these things and feeding the poor and so
[26:17] forth the trustees are over the finance
[26:20] in the building that's what they are to
[26:21] look at but the pastor is over the the
[26:25] supervising of the spiritual part and
[26:28] this would go to you brother Neville now
[26:33] there some time ago when the uh order
[26:37] was set the
[26:39] church uh I do believe in speaking in
[26:42] tongues and interpretation and all the
[26:45] fine spiritual gifts that's ordained of
[26:47] God to be in the
[26:49] church but we are living in a day just
[26:53] like it was in the Bible time where the
[26:57] church churches now you notice Paul he
[27:00] founded the church at Ephesus the
[27:02] Ephesian Church which is a
[27:03] well-established Church did you notice
[27:07] we believe that Paul and did say so
[27:09] himself that he spoke with many
[27:11] tongues and we know that he had gifts of
[27:14] tongues not ones that he had learned but
[27:16] those who were spiritually given to him
[27:18] because how he speaks it in Corinthians
[27:20] there and the same time I'm not just
[27:23] turning in the Bible and reading it for
[27:25] you because it would make our our stay
[27:27] here too long tonight as I don't have
[27:29] too much time and now but just so that
[27:32] you could openly see
[27:35] now uh Paul never one time had to speak
[27:39] to the Ephesian church or to the Roman
[27:41] church or any of those other churches
[27:43] about their spiritual gifts about how to
[27:44] put them in order but he did have to
[27:47] speak to the Corinthians continually
[27:49] about it because they made it an issue
[27:52] all the time and Paul said when he come
[27:55] among them if uh they found found out
[27:58] one had a tongue and one had a Psalm and
[28:00] he thanked the Lord for all their fine
[28:02] gifts and things like that and if you
[28:05] notice in the first chapter or two of
[28:07] Corinthians Paul was telling
[28:09] positionally what they were in Christ
[28:11] how he they were positionally in Christ
[28:13] and after he told him L like a father he
[28:16] be to let the whip down on him and say I
[28:19] hear there contentions among you and I
[28:21] hear that you get drunk at the Lord's
[28:23] table he didn't UNC christianize them
[28:26] and don't you Brethren do that un
[28:28] christianizing but it's the way they're
[28:30] behaving themselves in the house of God
[28:33] that's where it say now I would say this
[28:37] that as Paul of old said that when you
[28:40] come together if one speaks let another
[28:43] uh interpret there be no interpreter
[28:46] then hold your peace but if there be an
[28:48] interpreter I've watched The church here
[28:51] and I've seen you grow up I've seen many
[28:54] spiritual gifts operating among you
[28:56] frankly one I had to come brother Nev
[28:58] about with a word from the Lord to
[29:00] correct him on something that he was
[29:02] doing and if I if the Lord is the Holy
[29:04] Ghost is made me an overseer of the
[29:06] flock then it's my duty to tell you the
[29:10] truth and I'm very grateful for brother
[29:12] Neville he heeded to the truth I can
[29:14] only say it as he tells me now on this
[29:17] as I noticed your church growing and
[29:20] noticed it and in the church here's the
[29:22] way we had it first and this is the way
[29:24] we we want it again now if you don't
[29:27] watch when
[29:29] babies the first thing a baby does is
[29:32] try to talk when he can't talk he makes
[29:35] a lot of bubble and noise and and so
[29:38] forth but he thinks he's just he can out
[29:41] talk the preacher at that time well we
[29:44] find that not only in the natural life
[29:46] but we find that in the spiritual life
[29:48] also it's a little one and if you try to
[29:52] correct that baby and spank him a little
[29:54] bit because he gooing and trying to talk
[29:57] you you'll ruin the child and you'll
[29:59] hurt him and it's best to let that baby
[30:02] grow a little while until he actually
[30:05] can speak his words right and then tell
[30:06] him when not when Papa's talking or When
[30:09] Mama's talking but when it's appropriate
[30:12] time let him have his say do you
[30:15] understand me now let him talk when his
[30:19] time comes to talk now if I've ever had
[30:22] anything that's been a thorn in my flesh
[30:24] out in the meeting is someone to rise up
[30:26] when speaking and then give a message in
[30:29] tongues and break the spirit I've just
[30:32] come out of a meeting in New York and
[30:34] different places to where ministers let
[30:36] that go on time after time and it's
[30:39] nothing but but a confusion see when God
[30:43] is dealing in one line of thought he it
[30:46] would be it would he would be defeating
[30:49] his own purpose if he's trying to get a
[30:51] line of thought to you to the
[30:53] congregation to make an altar calling
[30:55] something bu him for instance like this
[30:57] we're sitting at the table talking and
[31:01] we're talking uh about the Lord and
[31:04] Junior runs into the table real quick
[31:06] takes all the attention away from what
[31:08] we're doing and hollers scream out dad
[31:11] mom m my I just hit a home run down the
[31:14] team and we doing all this that and the
[31:16] other and when we were right on a real
[31:19] right down sacred subject now him
[31:23] hitting a home run that's all right at
[31:26] the baseball game that's all right but
[31:28] he's out of
[31:29] order when he breaks in on the message
[31:31] that we're talking about let him wait
[31:33] till his time comes and then tell us
[31:36] what he did at the baseball game now
[31:38] that's just the same thing we find with
[31:40] gifts today that's the reason God cannot
[31:42] trust too many spiritual gifts with
[31:44] people they don't know how to control
[31:45] them that's what's the matter today the
[31:47] reason we don't have no more than we do
[31:49] and we do find there's a lot of
[31:51] impersonation of spiritual gifts but I
[31:53] don't believe that's so here in our
[31:55] church I'm thankful for that I don't
[31:56] believe it's an impersonation at all I
[31:58] believe we have genuine gifts but we
[32:00] must know how to control those gifts
[32:02] then when you go to doing something good
[32:04] just like you working for a boss and you
[32:06] start out on the first year job and
[32:07] you're willing to take
[32:09] orders then the boss has confidence in
[32:12] you and will keep raising you up to a
[32:15] higher office all the time now I believe
[32:18] that time has struck the brandom
[32:19] Tabernacle to know what to take the
[32:22] gifts that God gives us that God can
[32:24] trust us with something even greater and
[32:27] what we have got but we cannot uh go
[32:31] along and you see a man that's always
[32:33] have to be tell him and everything and
[32:35] remember the spirit of the prophets is
[32:38] subject to the prophet says the
[32:40] scripture when you see a man that you
[32:43] have to correct or a woman and that
[32:46] person gets out of order and then you're
[32:48] telling them the scriptural truth then
[32:51] it shows that the spirit that's on them
[32:53] isn't of God because the Bible said the
[32:56] spirit of the
[32:58] prophets are prophesying that's
[33:00] testifying preaching speaking in tongues
[33:03] or whatever it is C tongues interpreted
[33:05] is prophecy so it's subject to the
[33:09] prophet and the word is the
[33:13] prophet so we we see that it's out of
[33:17] order for a man or woman to jump up and
[33:20] give a message no matter how much they
[33:22] want to do it while the preacher is in
[33:25] the pulpit
[33:27] now I suggest this for the brandom
[33:32] Tabernacle that being that our our gifts
[33:34] that we find and we have some very fine
[33:37] gifted people here now each one of those
[33:41] gifts are a Ministry of their
[33:44] own they are gifts just like preaching
[33:47] is a gift like healing is a gift like
[33:51] other things are gifts these are gifts
[33:54] they are ministries of Their Own and
[33:57] each man is commanded to wait on his own
[34:02] Ministry therefore let the brandom
[34:04] Tabernacle be operated like this and in
[34:07] the day especially this day when we've
[34:09] had so
[34:10] much um I don't want to say this but so
[34:14] much make
[34:15] belief we don't want make belief no man
[34:18] no honest person wants to have a make
[34:21] belief we if we don't can't have the
[34:23] real let's not have any at all let's
[34:25] wait till we do get the real
[34:27] I believe you you man would agree with
[34:30] that we don't want nothing make believe
[34:32] brethren we can't start on make believe
[34:34] something and leave in this world we got
[34:36] to have what's real what's genuine if we
[34:39] haven't got it let's wait till we do get
[34:41] it then say something about it see
[34:44] now I would say let all these men and
[34:48] women who speak in tongues and prophesy
[34:52] and give messages and I I'm believing
[34:55] with you man if they are
[34:58] genuine
[34:59] now the Bible has said prove all things
[35:02] and hold fast to that what's good for
[35:05] with stammer lips and other tongues will
[35:07] I speak to this people this is the rest
[35:09] that I said that they should enter into
[35:12] over in the book of Isaiah
[35:15] now I would suggest this so that the
[35:20] sanctuary will only be ministered by one
[35:23] gift at a time for it brings it straight
[35:25] back in order again what I'm trying to
[35:27] say if one Speaking let the spirit of
[35:29] the prophets be subject to the prophet
[35:33] do you understand now let those who have
[35:37] a Ministry to the body of
[35:40] Christ and now it's being said now let
[35:43] it be done let those who have a
[35:46] Ministry to the body of Christ wait on
[35:50] their Ministry because it is a Ministry
[35:53] from Christ to the
[35:55] church
[35:57] but you can't all Minister the same time
[36:00] there's got to be one at a
[36:03] time the brandom Tabernacle should be
[36:05] like this let those who speak with
[36:08] tongues and those who interpret tongues
[36:11] and those have
[36:13] prophecy that's to be given to the
[36:15] church let them come among themselves
[36:20] early in the before the meeting starts
[36:23] let them Gather in an appointed room and
[36:26] wait on the ministry of the Lord as the
[36:30] pastor has to do himself before he comes
[36:33] into the audience he must take the Bible
[36:36] study in the quietness of his room in
[36:40] the spirit and be anointed to come out
[36:43] before the audience to speak if he
[36:46] doesn't he's going to be confused when
[36:48] he gets out there let each man and each
[36:51] woman with a spiritual gift come before
[36:54] the Lord and being that the pastor has a
[36:58] single Ministry he is a prophet the
[37:02] English word a preacher means a prophet
[37:04] that's a fourth tell of the
[37:07] word let those who have Ministries that
[37:12] has to be part of someone else like one
[37:15] to speak with tongues and another to
[37:17] interpret they wait together on their
[37:20] Ministry they cannot stay in a private
[37:22] study and speak in tongues and then come
[37:25] tell the other what he said because
[37:26] because he to have both tongues and
[37:29] interpretation now if he has that very
[37:32] well we want it to receive it like that
[37:34] and we want the church to benefit by
[37:37] these gifts that's in our church God
[37:40] sent them to us and it's we want our
[37:43] church to benefit by these spiritual
[37:45] gifts so let the man who speaks with
[37:48] tongues and the one who interprets and
[37:51] the one who prophesies let them come
[37:55] together before before the the church
[37:59] ever meets let them meet in a room to
[38:02] themselves waiting on the ministry of
[38:04] the Lord to the
[38:06] church is it
[38:08] understood and
[38:10] then like this if brother Neville say
[38:14] well I let me pardon me let me say this
[38:16] if brother Collins speaks with tongu and
[38:19] brother Hickerson gives the
[38:23] interpretation
[38:25] then they have a Ministry together for
[38:29] the
[38:30] church now that isn't the ministry of
[38:33] brother
[38:34] naille that's your ministry to the
[38:36] church I'm giving this as example then
[38:40] you Brethren should be just as
[38:41] interested in getting your ministry in
[38:45] the place in the house of God as a
[38:48] pastor is interested in getting his
[38:50] because it's just essential that you do
[38:53] it but you can't do it in the privacy of
[38:56] your own room if you speak and you
[38:58] interpret you've got to come
[39:00] together now come together in the church
[39:04] off in a room to yourself because you
[39:07] have a private Ministry it's not an
[39:09] openly Ministry it's one that's to help
[39:12] the church see it's something to help
[39:15] the church but it isn't to be done in
[39:16] the main congregation only the way I'm
[39:18] going to tell you it is to be done see
[39:21] then whatever brother Collins speaks and
[39:25] brother Hickerson gives the interpet
[39:26] ation as example then let brother uh
[39:30] somebody write this down what it
[39:34] is and
[39:37] then if it's coming now we all know that
[39:41] the Lord is coming we're aware of
[39:44] that and if brother Neville got up each
[39:46] night and said behold the Lord is coming
[39:49] behold the Lord is coming that would be
[39:51] all right see but he's saying that the
[39:54] pastor at the platform for for he's got
[39:57] the word for that and if he be a pastor
[40:01] Prophet to the church or Pastor rather
[40:05] he's to study the word of the Lord and
[40:06] tell you what's written in the word of
[40:08] the Lord about the coming of the Lord
[40:10] and you're warned by
[40:12] that a Ministry otherwise to the church
[40:16] which he wouldn't have any connection
[40:17] with is tongues interpretation of
[40:20] tongues which is prophecy or a prophet
[40:23] speaking that's something is not written
[40:25] in the word
[40:28] what's written in the word he's to bring
[40:29] it but what's not written in the word is
[40:32] what you're to tell him like for
[40:34] instance uh tell um brother wheeler thus
[40:38] sayeth the Lord tomorrow in his sandpit
[40:41] not to go to it because you'll be a
[40:43] truck turnover or something like that
[40:45] it's got to be done and you've spoken
[40:47] and he's interpreted and then lay that
[40:49] on the platform after your ministry is
[40:51] finished the other night after the
[40:53] church the hymn starts singing and so
[40:55] forth if your Ministries finished then
[40:58] let them come forth with what prophecy
[41:00] has been
[41:01] given and I do not think that we have or
[41:04] if you do put this in there when these
[41:07] people meet together let them who have
[41:09] wisdom first come because you see if one
[41:12] speaks in tongues and gives an
[41:14] interpretation according to scripture
[41:16] that cannot be received unless it be uh
[41:19] witnessed by two or three people two or
[41:21] three more witnesses see has to witness
[41:24] to that that they believe it to be the
[41:26] word of the Lord because sometimes in
[41:28] these minor Ministries just like in any
[41:30] other Ministry you get Spirits that's
[41:32] wrong see they'll fly in there and we
[41:35] don't want
[41:36] that no we want these Ministries ready
[41:39] to be exposed if they to be exposed
[41:41] because anything of God can don't worry
[41:43] about exposing it it'll it'll stand the
[41:46] test if it's of God it's like the pastor
[41:48] if somebody challenges him on the word
[41:50] he don't have to back up about it you
[41:52] know it's just exactly what he's talking
[41:53] to come on up here see and same as these
[41:56] other Ministries got to be the same way
[41:58] now if if one speaks in tongues and
[42:01] gives a message now some people speak in
[42:03] tongues when they're just edifying
[42:06] themselves the Bible say they just have
[42:08] a good time to speak in tongues they
[42:10] feel and they do speak in tongues they
[42:12] actually speak with tongues and it's the
[42:14] spirit doing it but if it's sitting out
[42:17] there in the audience of speaking in
[42:19] tongues just edifying themselves then it
[42:22] isn't any profitable thing for the
[42:23] church the man's edifying himself or the
[42:26] woman or whoever is doing it see to
[42:29] speak in tongues as a gift of God to
[42:31] edification as Paul says in the
[42:33] scripture that it's to edify the church
[42:36] so it had to be some direct message from
[42:38] God to the church outside of what's
[42:41] wrote here in the
[42:42] Bible see it's something if you could
[42:45] ask me brother brandom uh how must I be
[42:48] baptized I can tell you right quick you
[42:50] don't have to speak in tongues and tell
[42:51] me that it's wrote right here in the
[42:52] Bible what to do about that see I don't
[42:55] have to you don't have to ask ask no
[42:56] questions on that have somebody speak in
[42:58] tongues and tell you see that's already
[43:00] written but if you say brother Brandon
[43:03] uh what must I do I've got a decision
[43:05] here I've got to make whether I should U
[43:08] uh take this church or go to another
[43:10] church or something like that or should
[43:11] I do this now that have to come from God
[43:15] see God has to tell us that but that
[43:17] would have to come to another Ministry
[43:19] because the word don't say let arm and
[43:21] nille leave brandom Tabernacle and go to
[43:24] the Fort wi gospel t Tabernacle see they
[43:27] don't say that in the word here see so
[43:29] that's what these gifts are for like a
[43:31] person come up here and say you believe
[43:33] in Divine Healing we preach that we
[43:35] believe it we believe in nor and the all
[43:37] but here some man says he can't get
[43:38] through what's the matter then it takes
[43:40] God through tongues interpretation
[43:43] through prophecy or some way to go down
[43:45] in that man's life and pull out that
[43:47] thing that he's done and tell him about
[43:49] that's a Ministry that doesn't belong to
[43:52] the pastor it belongs to these
[43:54] ministering gifts
[43:56] but they're not to be done out there in
[43:58] the audience see now Paul and remember
[44:00] one time had to tell those tell those
[44:03] Ephesian Church anything about that they
[44:05] were in order the Roman church or none
[44:07] of those other churches only the
[44:09] Corinthian Church and they never could
[44:11] get themselves now Paul believed in
[44:13] speaking in tongues he had speak in
[44:15] tongues in the Ephesian church as same
[44:17] as he did in the Corinthian Church see
[44:20] but he could speak to the Ephesians
[44:22] greater things than what just speaking
[44:24] in tongues interpretive Tong
[44:27] now then if someone writes a message
[44:31] that's been given in tongues or given in
[44:32] Prophecy and laid upon the platform it
[44:35] must be read by the pastor before the
[44:38] service starts of thus sayeth the Lord
[44:42] from these people who spoke and
[44:44] interpreted and if that comes to pass
[44:46] exactly the way the interpretation said
[44:48] we raise our hands and give thanks to
[44:50] God for his Spirit among us if it
[44:53] doesn't come to pass then don't do it
[44:56] anymore to that evil spirit's out of you
[44:59] God don't lie he's always
[45:01] truth then you see you're old enough now
[45:04] to act like man not children goo goo goo
[45:08] you got to have some meaning to
[45:09] something Let the church now is is
[45:12] coming in order come to this
[45:14] order if one prophesy if one come among
[45:17] you unlearned and you speak in tongues
[45:21] you'll be a barbarian to him you don't
[45:22] know what you're talking about see and
[45:24] really in this day where there's been so
[45:26] much confusion about it it causes a
[45:28] stumbling BLX but let one speak in
[45:31] tongues and another interpret and give
[45:33] the message and let it be read off right
[45:35] here at the platform of what's going to
[45:36] take place and then let it happen and
[45:38] see what happens tell them at tomorrow
[45:41] at a certain time or next week at a
[45:42] certain time it's going to be a certain
[45:44] thing then let the unbeliever sitting
[45:46] there listen to that and see it's
[45:47] foretold before it happens then they'll
[45:50] know what kind of spirit's among you
[45:51] it'll be God's spirit that's what Paul
[45:54] said then if one can prophesy and reveal
[45:58] the secret things won't the whole
[46:01] congregation fall down to the unbeliever
[46:03] and say God is in the midst of you see
[46:06] because it cannot be but now we don't
[46:09] what when we was a child Paul said I
[46:11] acted like a child he told the
[46:12] Corinthians there I spoke like a child
[46:15] he had a child mind but when I become an
[46:18] adult I put childish things away now I'm
[46:22] telling you all see now a few years ago
[46:25] you were children with these gifts
[46:27] playing back and
[46:29] forth but you've been to a long school
[46:31] now it's time to be man not use these
[46:35] just to play with these gifts are sacred
[46:38] they're of God and you don't play with
[46:41] them let's let God use them that's what
[46:43] your ministry wants to be that's the way
[46:46] to put the brandom Tabernacle in the
[46:48] service and and if this is question
[46:50] anytime let this tape stand as a witness
[46:54] that's the way it's to be done in the
[46:56] brandom Tabernacle if there would be a
[46:58] stranger come in CU you have them all
[47:00] the time because this been an inter
[47:02] denominational Tabernacle there's people
[47:04] come in that doesn't have this well
[47:05] training they don't have it they don't
[47:07] know better in their own pastors they'll
[47:09] jump right up and break his message up
[47:10] and tear Al or call up and speak in
[47:12] tongues and everything like that you're
[47:14] a better trained man in that see then
[47:17] after the service if he gets unruly then
[47:19] it's a Deacon's place to go to them
[47:22] don't let your pastor have to do it let
[47:24] it comes to a spot where no Deacon here
[47:26] but a deacon is supposed to see to that
[47:28] see now after the service if the person
[47:30] just raises up and gives a message the
[47:33] pastor if he wants to stop just a minute
[47:35] go ahead very well see that's up to the
[47:37] pastor but then immediately let the
[47:39] Deacon before that person gets out of
[47:41] the building take them to one
[47:43] side and talk to them about and if they
[47:46] question it bring him to this tape and
[47:48] say this is what the bishop or the
[47:50] overseer of the church which is Bishop
[47:52] the any overseer that's what it's called
[47:54] in the Bible Bishop PR see so that's
[47:56] General overseer of the church let this
[47:58] is the arst and way our church does it
[48:00] now we love for you come give your a
[48:02] message but if you've got a message from
[48:04] the Lord and it's let it be given come
[48:07] up here and lay it on our platform and
[48:09] our Minister will read it to the
[48:11] congregation a message to this
[48:13] congregation but it must not be just
[48:16] repeating scriptures and things like
[48:18] that it must be a direct message to the
[48:21] people of something that's fixing to
[48:23] take place or something they should do
[48:24] is it understood
[48:26] all right now is there any better way to
[48:30] keep order in the church than to uh keep
[48:34] uh reminding the people uh with
[48:39] a uh repeat from the deacons
[48:45] accordingly no that I've just explained
[48:48] that that's question number three the
[48:51] deacons your duty is to keep order in
[48:54] the church with
[48:56] kindness friendliness and then you are
[49:00] supposed to if someone gets out of order
[49:03] in the church or comes in here like a
[49:04] drunk or somebody com in like the shot
[49:06] that Minister out of the platform other
[49:08] night up there you heard about that that
[49:09] drunk coming in with a double barrel
[49:11] shotgun scream for his wife and and
[49:14] wanted wife and went up towards the
[49:16] pastor and and the pastor showed him his
[49:19] wife sitting there but he's going to
[49:20] shootter right in the church and the
[49:22] pastor started dealing with him and
[49:24] instead of uh in instead of the U uh the
[49:28] man with the shotgun turned around and
[49:29] shot the pastor out of the pull pit and
[49:31] then shot his wife and then shot himself
[49:33] now if there been a bunch of deacons
[49:35] there when that man entered that door
[49:36] that shotgun that had their arms around
[49:38] the shotgun out of his hand see see
[49:41] that's that's orderly deacons and now
[49:44] these things have gone the way they're
[49:45] doing now you might can just expect
[49:47] anything but remember the deacons are
[49:50] God's policemen in the house of God no
[49:54] matter what anybody else thinks
[49:57] sometimes a policeman won't have to go
[49:59] and make arrest on somebody maybe one of
[50:01] his friends but he swore into an office
[50:03] he's got to do it anyhow that's his duty
[50:06] to his City see that's the duty of a
[50:10] deacon to the church and U if uh someone
[50:14] jumps up and starts interrupting the
[50:16] pastor or something know like that and a
[50:18] pastor in his message the Deacon's
[50:20] supposed to walk up to them people two
[50:22] or three of them say could we speak to
[50:24] you brother see bring him from the
[50:27] church out into the office in here or
[50:29] some other office and speak to him about
[50:31] it say you not to interrupt you know
[50:33] it's a it's a great fine by the law to
[50:36] interrupt a service anyhow see but some
[50:39] people such as a delinquent person or
[50:41] something come among you know and and
[50:43] some religious fanatic and and start
[50:45] carrying on then the deacons and if and
[50:48] if the deacons don't seem to be able to
[50:50] control it then the trustee board or
[50:51] anyone else in the church can step up
[50:53] and give help to such a person you know
[50:56] and um and now let me ask the question
[50:58] again here is there any better way to
[51:00] keep order in the church than to re
[51:04] remind the people with a repeat from the
[51:09] deacons now occasionally now I think
[51:14] that the the pastor ever so often or
[51:17] play this tap let that stand for a
[51:20] witness
[51:21] deacons are policemen and their word is
[51:26] Law and
[51:28] Order and they have the authority from
[51:31] the church and even from the laws of the
[51:34] nation to make that house of God be the
[51:38] right place and anyone to contro a
[51:41] deacon like that is subject to two to 10
[51:46] years in federal
[51:48] prison if you tell them to go and they
[51:51] don't do it or something like that
[51:53] somebody with dis orderly conduct you
[51:55] just don't don't know what he's doing to
[51:57] he's subjecting himself relive on
[51:59] himself to all kinds of fines anything
[52:01] and then if it comes to a spot at
[52:04] somebody and I like and somebody jumps
[52:05] up and get this arly just maybe speak in
[52:08] tongues or something I wouldn't go in on
[52:09] that see let them go because if they're
[52:11] stranger if there are own people then
[52:13] just let the next night you deacons just
[52:16] get this tape and say now we're going to
[52:17] play the orders of the church before we
[52:19] start the service I want everybody to
[52:21] understand it you pastors and you all
[52:23] can work together like that
[52:25] now brother brandham what about the
[52:28] Sunday
[52:29] School um brother Bram about the Sunday
[52:32] School all right should it be before the
[52:36] preaching
[52:38] service yes we've always had it that way
[52:40] have the Sunday school before the
[52:42] preaching service and um that gives a
[52:45] chance for the little fellas who attend
[52:46] Sunday school to dismiss their classes
[52:49] and if and if they want the little
[52:50] fellas don't understand it they have to
[52:52] sit all the way through the preaching
[52:53] service and then have Sunday school the
[52:54] little fell are wore out let the Sunday
[52:57] School be first have a set time just at
[53:00] one set time that Sunday school goes to
[53:03] session Sunday school superintendent is
[53:05] supposed to see that at this Sunday
[53:07] school goes to session at a certain time
[53:10] set time and it's dismissed at a certain
[53:12] time all the Sunday School allow so much
[53:14] time for that then dismissed should the
[53:17] teacher for the adult class be someone
[53:19] other than the pastor if it's so agreed
[53:23] if the pastor wants to teach the Sunday
[53:24] school and then bring the message later
[53:26] that's fine and dandy if he wants to do
[53:28] the double service but if he doesn't
[53:31] then have your adult Sunday school
[53:33] teacher see for your Adult class and
[53:35] then if U if the uh Pastor uh has
[53:39] somebody else there in mind and the
[53:41] person wants to do it give yourself 30
[53:43] minutes or whatever you go to allow your
[53:44] Sunday school for 30 or 35 40 minutes
[53:47] whatever it is and there should be a
[53:48] bell set your and when that Bell is
[53:50] tapped that means or either the church
[53:52] bell when it Taps on the outside that's
[53:55] dismissing Sunday school and when that
[53:58] bell rings that mean everything come to
[54:00] order right there there' be so much time
[54:03] then for a hym or two whatever you to
[54:05] sing not too much time you wear the
[54:07] people out but keeping them too long see
[54:10] and U just tap the Bell have a hymn and
[54:14] whatever you're going to do and then
[54:15] send your classes to the place and
[54:17] immediately when that time comes say
[54:18] it's going to be at at 10:00 or 10:30 or
[54:21] 10:15 whatever it is tap that Bell and
[54:24] ever teacher dismisses her class come to
[54:26] the audience out here and then and give
[54:28] the report Sunday school report and then
[54:31] dismiss the whole thing and let all that
[54:33] wants to stay for preaching service be
[54:35] next and it's an
[54:38] AR
[54:40] questions how many you mean have a spit
[54:43] class in other words oh yes you should
[54:45] have a three-year-old can't understand
[54:47] what a 14year old would understand I
[54:49] think I got that a little farther how
[54:51] many classes should there
[54:52] be you should put your classes
[54:55] and like a little bitty class that wants
[54:58] to have flannel graph that's too much
[55:00] for a 14-year-old boy or girl you should
[55:04] have a someone to take a class for those
[55:06] little babies some old mother or
[55:08] something who knows how to take care of
[55:10] other classes I think U should be uh
[55:13] somebody who's more uh able to present
[55:17] the word see and uh there should be
[55:20] classes to say now they be like a class
[55:22] of from the at least three classes there
[55:25] should be a little bitty baby class
[55:27] there should be from about 5 years old
[55:30] and all the others under that should be
[55:32] kept with a mother and taking in the
[55:33] nursery if necessary during the time of
[55:35] the preaching if they go carrying on
[55:37] that's what the nurser is out there for
[55:40] and I think that the the classes should
[55:42] be range from like the little babies
[55:44] about five or six years old up to eight
[55:47] or nine 10 something like that and then
[55:49] from 10 years old on to 15 should be in
[55:53] the teenage class and and then the adult
[55:55] class over at 15 because they if they're
[55:58] old enough to nowadays they can get a
[56:00] job and they're want them to vote at
[56:01] that age almost so they they should be
[56:04] able to hear the word but come out in
[56:06] the main Auditorium and have
[56:10] that uh who should be the teachers there
[56:13] you are that's up to you to bolt your
[56:14] own teachers in and you ought to do that
[56:17] put them in there get somebody and meet
[56:19] with the church and say uh who's uh who
[56:21] here feels LED of the Lord and then get
[56:23] a qualified teacher and then let it be
[56:26] done it's got to be strictly business
[56:27] brother if the teacher can't qualify to
[56:30] it then change
[56:31] teachers when the time comes is under
[56:34] God if I feel like an arm and devil
[56:35] can't no more qualify to be Pastor here
[56:38] I'm going to mention it to the
[56:40] church when I'd see one thing here think
[56:43] that you deacons couldn't qualify to be
[56:44] deacons I would to mentioned it to the
[56:46] church and I find out there's a certain
[56:48] Deacon out here doing something he
[56:49] shouldn't do and he doesn't keep his
[56:51] post of Duty and so forth like that or a
[56:53] trustee or whatever it is I can't vote
[56:55] it in or out the church has to do that
[56:56] but I'm certainly going to present it
[56:58] before the
[56:59] church because that's what it should do
[57:01] that's what I'm supposed to be as
[57:03] overseer I'm supposed to look and see
[57:04] what's going on we're going to heaven
[57:07] not out here somewhere to Rally or
[57:09] something to have a lot of fun and run
[57:11] over one another and play baseball we're
[57:13] here handling the most gracious thing
[57:15] there is on Earth the word of God and be
[57:18] carried on in Godly
[57:21] order um who should be the teachers
[57:24] that's up to you to select them uh but I
[57:27] would take for the babies I'd take an
[57:29] old woman some that can do that but for
[57:32] the teenagers I'd take some teacher
[57:33] that's
[57:34] strict and not just going out here and
[57:37] having weener roast that' be all right
[57:38] they want to go on to weener roast but
[57:40] just put all the thing of that put it to
[57:41] the word that's somebody who's able to
[57:44] hold the word and it's going to be this
[57:46] church stands not for weener roaster all
[57:49] right and and little picnics that you
[57:50] want to go together in Fellowship that's
[57:52] fine that that's what you should do the
[57:54] entertain the children but in this place
[57:56] in here this is the word of God witer
[57:59] roast is when you get together something
[58:01] like that but not in this house of God
[58:03] and these no of course we know we don't
[58:06] believe in this your foolishness of of
[58:09] parties and everything like that around
[58:10] here we we you know better than that who
[58:13] should be over the Sunday School to keep
[58:16] it in order the Sunday school
[58:19] superintendant that's what his business
[58:21] is he's not supposed to have anything to
[58:23] do with the deacon trustees pastors or
[58:25] nobody else he's got an office of his
[58:27] own whoever your Sunday school teacher
[58:29] is I know not that Sunday school teacher
[58:31] is supposed to see that every class is
[58:34] in its place and every teacher is
[58:37] present or substitute another teacher
[58:38] for that teacher if they're not there on
[58:40] that date then just before the Sunday
[58:42] while the lessons are going on this
[58:45] Sunday school superintendent is to go by
[58:47] and take up the offerings that they've
[58:49] had in there their Sunday school
[58:50] Collections and the report of how many
[58:52] present how many bibles they had in this
[58:54] class and so forth and make a report of
[58:56] it and then stand before the audience
[58:58] just before the preaching service when
[59:00] he's give the spot to do it when they
[59:01] have the Sunday School report after the
[59:03] Sunday school is over tell how many
[59:04] teachers how many present how many the
[59:07] whole Sunday school total whole C total
[59:09] of offerings and so forth like a deacons
[59:11] trustees pastors are not supposed to do
[59:14] that they have nothing to do into it
[59:16] that is a Sunday school superintendent's
[59:18] job and then if he sees that the Sunday
[59:21] School needs certain things then he is
[59:23] to present that
[59:25] to the U uh uh to the trustee board and
[59:30] the trustees has a meeting up on it
[59:32] first and then the trustees that they
[59:34] find that there is sufficient funds and
[59:37] so forth through the treasure then this
[59:39] can be purchased if you wants something
[59:41] there for literature or whatever it is
[59:42] or some Bibles or something they want to
[59:44] buy a Bible for uh the one you know it
[59:47] can uh find the most words and quote the
[59:49] most scripture or some Prize or
[59:51] something they going to give away like
[59:52] that or said they want to buy it to the
[59:54] church then let that be presented to the
[59:56] to the to the um the deacons and then
[1:00:00] let them find out if it's if it's if
[1:00:02] it's in the Treasure see and that I
[1:00:04] think that takes care of them five
[1:00:07] questions on that now on the next one is
[1:00:11] brother brandham in respect to the order
[1:00:14] of the church we have tried to go
[1:00:17] accordingly to the way we understand the
[1:00:20] orders given in the dedication of the
[1:00:23] new church
[1:00:25] and by doing so some have gotten mad and
[1:00:31] left the church and others will not
[1:00:34] listen to anything we
[1:00:37] say especially the children we have talk
[1:00:41] to the parents about their children and
[1:00:44] they won't take care of them
[1:00:48] now have we misunderstood or are we
[1:00:52] going about it in the wrong long way
[1:00:55] thanks now let me answer this as they
[1:00:58] come
[1:00:59] down um in respect to the order of the
[1:01:03] church we have tried to go accordingly
[1:01:05] to the way we understood at given in the
[1:01:08] dedication of the new church now that's
[1:01:10] correct you're doing right now this is
[1:01:13] supposed to be deacons I suppose because
[1:01:14] it's right here it's a Deacon's job all
[1:01:17] right and by doing so we have often
[1:01:21] people has often gotten mad at us they
[1:01:23] do at me too
[1:01:25] they'll do it any man see a person that
[1:01:27] does that there's something wrong with
[1:01:30] that person they're not right with God
[1:01:32] for the spirit of Christ is subject to
[1:01:36] Christ teaching Christ house Christ
[1:01:39] order and any man that or any woman or
[1:01:43] any person children that would get angry
[1:01:46] with a Godly Deacon that would tell them
[1:01:48] to be or any parent would get angry with
[1:01:51] the Deacon really we want everybody in
[1:01:54] this church that we can get but if that
[1:01:56] would only cause trouble somewhere else
[1:01:58] there's a thorn or a rabbit in the wood
[1:02:01] pile as we used to say it that person
[1:02:03] isn't right if they leave there's only
[1:02:05] one thing to do let them go and pray for
[1:02:08] them and maybe some of the deacons go to
[1:02:10] the church or go to the house sometime
[1:02:12] and find out why they left and ask them
[1:02:14] what was wrong then and if they see if
[1:02:17] he can reconcile them if he can't then
[1:02:18] take two or three Witnesses with him
[1:02:20] that they might be understood then if it
[1:02:22] can't be understood then it's told
[1:02:23] before the church that they are a member
[1:02:25] here of the church then they are and
[1:02:27] then if they're not members of the
[1:02:28] Church of course they're not members of
[1:02:29] this congregation they should be made to
[1:02:32] be rud see they they've got to listen to
[1:02:34] our ERS here because this is the orders
[1:02:36] of the church this is things we don't
[1:02:38] want to do things that I don't like to
[1:02:40] do but it's things that must be do I'm
[1:02:42] exposing myself and tell them here but
[1:02:44] this tape it's me they can hear me
[1:02:45] talking and know that's me not you man
[1:02:48] you've asked me these questions and I'm
[1:02:50] giv it to you the best that I know how
[1:02:51] from the word of God now if those people
[1:02:55] get angry go out from you what does the
[1:02:57] scripture say about it brother BR they
[1:02:58] went out from us because they wasn't of
[1:03:01] us that settled
[1:03:03] it left the church that's what they did
[1:03:06] all right others will not listen to
[1:03:09] anything we say especially the children
[1:03:12] the children are supposed to know
[1:03:14] discipline they should get it at home
[1:03:16] but even if it's mine my kids get in
[1:03:20] here at any time they get this hardly I
[1:03:22] don't want you to draw one string Sarah
[1:03:24] Rebecca Joseph Billy or whoever it might
[1:03:26] be you tell me I'll see to it if they
[1:03:31] can't behave then they'll stay away from
[1:03:32] church till they do learn to behave this
[1:03:34] is not an arena this is a house of God
[1:03:37] this is not a place to play and skate
[1:03:39] and write notes and laugh and cut up
[1:03:41] this is the house of God be cared out
[1:03:44] Godly you come here to worship not even
[1:03:46] to visit this is not a this not a picnic
[1:03:49] ground this is not a visitation place
[1:03:52] this is the visitation place of the Holy
[1:03:54] Spirit Spirit listen to what he has to
[1:03:55] say not to one another we don't come
[1:03:57] here to Fellowship uh with one another
[1:04:00] we come here to fellowship with Christ
[1:04:02] This is a house of worship and children
[1:04:04] must be disciplined and if they are of
[1:04:07] the parents let it be known if these
[1:04:11] deacons if these parents of the children
[1:04:15] will not listen to what these deacons
[1:04:17] said then this parents should be
[1:04:19] corrected
[1:04:20] themselves we have talked to the parents
[1:04:24] about about the children and they won't
[1:04:26] take care of them if they are members of
[1:04:29] this church then you should take two or
[1:04:31] three with you and call that parent into
[1:04:33] a private
[1:04:35] meeting into one of the offices I don't
[1:04:38] care who it is if it's me if it's
[1:04:40] brother Neville it's Billy Paul and his
[1:04:43] little boy if it's brother Collins and
[1:04:44] one of his children or any the rest of
[1:04:46] you we are we love one another but we're
[1:04:49] Duty bound to God in this
[1:04:53] word
[1:04:54] it's do no matter who it is we're to
[1:04:58] call one another in and be honest with
[1:05:00] one another how can God ever deal with
[1:05:02] this if we're not honest with one
[1:05:03] another how are we going to be honest
[1:05:04] with him see this is an order we must
[1:05:08] keep the house of God and deacons are
[1:05:10] supposed to know how to do that and
[1:05:12] that's why I'm telling you now I keep
[1:05:14] them things call them and if this you
[1:05:16] tell the parents and they won't listen
[1:05:17] to the won't listen to it then you get
[1:05:19] you another Deacon or one of the
[1:05:21] trustees or some good person in this
[1:05:22] church and call they your trust take
[1:05:24] your Deacon boore all your deacons
[1:05:27] together say brother Jones brother
[1:05:29] Henderson brother Jackson or whoever it
[1:05:30] might be see they children are
[1:05:32] disbehaving we've told them two three
[1:05:34] times about these children they won't
[1:05:35] listen to it then call Brother Jones in
[1:05:36] or brother whoever it is and say brother
[1:05:38] Jones We've called you in here for a
[1:05:40] meeting we love you and you're a part of
[1:05:42] us you're one of us let me just set this
[1:05:44] certain tape and listen to what brother
[1:05:46] brandom said about it see now we've
[1:05:48] asked you to make those children behave
[1:05:51] see if they won't behave and you can't
[1:05:53] make them behav in church leave them
[1:05:55] with someone while you come to church
[1:05:56] until they learn how to behave
[1:05:58] themselves in the house of
[1:06:00] God but this is an order it's got to be
[1:06:02] carried out see now other question goes
[1:06:06] on now have we misunderstood no sir you
[1:06:10] haven't misunderstood that's correct I'm
[1:06:12] saying it again the orders in the army
[1:06:15] they don't ask you will you go do a
[1:06:17] certain thing if you're in the Army
[1:06:20] you're compelled to do it see and that's
[1:06:23] the way it is in the I'm compelled to
[1:06:25] preach the gospel I'm compelled to stand
[1:06:27] for this regardless of what my other man
[1:06:30] and Brethren and so forth say about it
[1:06:31] I'm compelled to do this I have to hurt
[1:06:33] feelings and cut man to Pieces but if I
[1:06:36] you don't want to get like oswal see if
[1:06:39] you can't disagree with a man and things
[1:06:41] then shake his hand and still have the
[1:06:42] same feelings towards him then there's
[1:06:44] something wrong with you if I can't
[1:06:47] disagree with a man bitterly from one
[1:06:49] side to the other and still think as
[1:06:51] much of him as as Christ would then
[1:06:53] there something wrong with my spirit I
[1:06:55] haven't the spirit of
[1:06:57] Christ if he says well brother brandom I
[1:07:00] believe that you are teaching is this
[1:07:02] all right brother let's come together to
[1:07:04] reason you and I we'll take it ourselves
[1:07:06] we'll go over here in the room to
[1:07:07] ourselves we'll reason it out and he
[1:07:09] just cuts me to pieces and I have to say
[1:07:11] things back to him if in my heart I
[1:07:13] can't feel the same about him and he's
[1:07:14] still my brother and I'm trying to help
[1:07:16] him then I'll never help him there's no
[1:07:19] way for me to help him if I don't love
[1:07:21] him what's use of going over there tell
[1:07:24] you in the first place first brother I
[1:07:25] don't love you and let me get that out
[1:07:26] of my heart right here before we go in
[1:07:28] there because I can't help you until I
[1:07:30] love you and that's right and that's the
[1:07:33] way see car it on you've done it exactly
[1:07:35] right that's the way it should be you
[1:07:36] never misunderstood it are we going
[1:07:38] about the wrong way no it is the right
[1:07:41] way to car that let order be kept
[1:07:43] because it's constantly uh Little
[1:07:46] Children mothers little babies and
[1:07:47] things they they'll cry and if they get
[1:07:49] crying too much and interrupting your
[1:07:51] pastor up there remember you are here
[1:07:54] his bodyguards you're his gospel
[1:07:57] bodyguards see and if it's interrupting
[1:08:01] the message of the Lord then you are
[1:08:03] deacons what are you to do just like man
[1:08:05] speaking in tongues he's Duty bound and
[1:08:07] a man preaching he's Duty bound to the
[1:08:09] word he's Duty bound to these things
[1:08:11] each one of you Duty bound to an office
[1:08:13] and that's that's just what we're uh
[1:08:17] we're here to
[1:08:22] do
[1:08:33] amen how many can say Amen to the word
[1:08:35] of God thank God for that it's always
[1:08:38] good to hear that over again amen it
