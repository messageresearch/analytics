[3:18] untimely figs when she is shaken of A
[3:21] Mighty Wind and the heaven departed as a
[3:24] scroll when it is rolled together and

[4:53] public uh
[4:55] confession that you're finished with sin
[4:58] and you you want the mercies of God and
[5:02] you've accepted them in Jesus Christ the
[5:05] fool he'll be ready to baptize anybody
[5:07] who wants to be baptized today or
[5:10] tomorrow right now or whenever it may be
[5:13] do you enjoy the six seal you see where
[5:17] it's opened at now have you believed
[5:21] it in said who has believed our report
[5:25] and to whom has the arm of the Lord been
[5:28] revealed believe the report then the arm
[5:30] of the Lord is revealed the arm the word
[5:33] of God is revealed the Lord willing now
[5:36] tomorrow morning I'll try my best to
[5:38] answer those questions I'll spend
[5:40] probably the rest of the night and or
[5:42] most of it in prayer over them I'm
[5:45] getting about from 1 to 3 hours a night
[5:48] I never got to bed last night till going
[5:50] on 1 and at 3:00 I was in
[5:53] study see I'm going to have to answer
[5:57] for
[5:58] this that's right we're too close for
[6:01] anything any foolishness or any
[6:03] presuming or halfway believe I've got to
[6:05] see it first and then when I see it it's
[6:07] got to be in the word too and so far by
[6:11] the grace of God they perfectly I took
[6:14] it from all the way through you know
[6:16] that it's it's Blended right together
[6:19] it's got to be thus sayeth the Lord
[6:23] because it's not only as it say it from
[6:26] I me knowing it myself but the word of
[6:28] the Lord is thus sayth the Lord and here
[6:31] is the word taking what he has given to
[6:34] me and blending it together and showing
[6:37] you so you know yourself it's thus
[6:38] sayith the Lord see here's the word says
[6:42] so and then the Revelation that he gives
[6:45] me which is contrary to what any of us
[6:47] has ever
[6:48] thought well contrary to what I thought
[6:51] because I never went into it like that
[6:53] but now we find it slides right together
[6:55] and what is it it's thus sayeth the Lord
[6:58] amen
[7:01] it's been a place open up holding there
[7:04] to this hour and then the Lord comes and
[7:06] pushes it right in like that so you see
[7:08] there it is it's it's the Lord oh I love
[7:11] him I love him with all my heart I
[7:15] remember you we couldn't get to the
[7:17] altar several held their hands up now
[7:19] see it's an individual affair with you
[7:22] it's whatever you want to do see the
[7:25] hour is so close to hand you ought to be
[7:27] pressing as hard as you could not had to
[7:29] be pulled full things just pressing
[7:31] trying to get in Lord don't let me out
[7:33] don't leave me out Lord the doors are
[7:35] closing if I can just get in see God
[7:38] will close the door one day he did in
[7:40] the day of Noah and the beat on the door
[7:42] is that right now remember the Bible
[7:45] said that in
[7:58] the e
[8:40] the fruits of the spirit what proves
[8:42] what it is the fruits of the tree proves
[8:44] what kind of a tree it is not the bark
[8:47] the
[8:48] fruit now
[8:58] notice it now
[9:00] I believe I got it yeah we're getting
[9:04] it I I I better not say this because is
[9:07] it might cause a confusion when I said
[9:09] the day the Rapture H would come I uh
[9:12] now if you say you you'll take it all
[9:14] right watch watch all right that's up to
[9:17] you when the sleeping virgin
[9:21] see that thought she was prayed up to
[9:24] come
[9:25] back the bribe was done
[9:28] gone amen
[9:30] amen it went and she didn't know
[9:35] it like a thief in the night then they
[9:38] begin to bang on the door and what
[9:41] happened what taken place they were cast
[9:44] into the tribulation period the Bible
[9:47] said there will be weeping and wailing
[9:51] and nashing of teeth is that
[9:53] right when is going to be brother sister
[9:56] I don't know but
[9:59] me it may be just me here now see this
[10:03] this is this is my thought see I I I
[10:06] believe it's so close um each day I I
[10:09] want I'm just trying to walk as softly
[10:11] as I can and I when in know one
[10:15] something happened today and I seen
[10:17] something come
[10:19] up I I just I couldn't get my breath
[10:22] anymore see there he was standing there
[10:24] that light standing right there and here
[10:26] it was ano of Truth amen amen although
[10:29] God I couldn't say that I I can't say
[10:31] that I can't I just walked out of the
[10:34] room went out walked up and down I
[10:37] thought my what can I
[10:40] do and I I have to go fishing or
[10:43] something or boy you you I can't tell
[10:46] you see so we have a good time don't we
[10:48] praise the
[10:50] Lorden we're in a we're in a a
[10:52] tremendous time
[10:54] amen see for my heart is overflowed with
[10:59] happiness and joy but when I think of
[11:02] this world and the thousands that I know
[11:05] that's
[11:06] lost black
[11:12] shadow then your heart just bleeds what
[11:15] can you do what can you you just feel
[11:18] the Holy Spirit crying out in your heart
[11:20] like it must have been in our Lord when
[11:22] he looked over Jerusalem his own
[11:24] people said Jerusalem Jerusalem how off
[11:28] would I have hovered you as a hen would
[11:30] are Brew but you would not just feel the
[11:33] holy spirit said how often I would have
[11:35] geted you but you would
[11:38] not we're we're right here at something
[11:40] friends Whatever It Is God knows nobody
[11:44] nobody knows when it's going to happen
[11:47] that's a secret nobody knows when it's
[11:49] going to happen but Jesus told us when
[11:52] you see these things all these things is
[11:55] what what it went comparing with the six
[11:57] seal to what he said in Matthew 24 I
[12:00] remember what he said when you see these
[12:02] things come to begin to come to pass
[12:05] then the times at the door watch the
[12:08] very next verse the 30 the 30 and 31st
[12:12] verses is one on down 32nd 33 verses he
[12:16] said and he shall send forth his angels
[12:20] to the four corners of the Heavens to
[12:22] the Four Winds together his elected amen
[12:26] is that right so now learn now remember
[12:29] he stopped right there he never went
[12:31] ahead at that Sixth Seal he never said
[12:33] anything about the seventh he said the
[12:34] first 2 third fourth fifth and sixth but
[12:37] he stopped there never mentioned about
[12:38] anything but watch the next thing he
[12:40] said now learn a
[12:41] parable then he starts on Parable he
[12:44] said these things will be he's answering
[12:46] them three questions what will be the
[12:48] these signs and what will be the sign of
[12:50] your coming what will be the sign of the
[12:52] end of the world and the sixth one there
[12:55] was the end of the world and the
[12:57] sounding of the seventh angel
[13:00] raised up the hands and swore by him
[13:03] that lives forever the time shall be no
[13:05] more their Earth is giving birth to a
[13:07] new
[13:10] one it's over here we are right you're
[13:15] at the
[13:16] door oh I
[13:19] tremble what must I do Lord what what
[13:22] else can I do
[13:23] see and then just think of seeing that
[13:26] place and those precious people I stood
[13:30] there looking at myself and I thought oh
[13:32] God what they came this this I I ought
[13:36] to push him I to just reach out the
[13:38] audience and got him and push you can't
[13:40] do that you and no man can come except
[13:43] my father
[13:44] draws but here's one consolation we have
[13:47] all the father has given me will
[13:50] come but the rest of at those
[13:53] organizations depending on them like
[13:55] that see and he deceived all that lived
[13:59] upon dwelt upon the Earth whose names
[14:01] were not written in that Lamb's Book of
[14:03] Life slain from the foundation of the
[14:06] world so see it's a sad thing the only
[14:09] thing you can do is just just just just
[14:11] stay right with the word watch this
[14:13] whatever he says do and then do that see
[14:15] whatever says do do that you look out
[14:16] there and think oh my they do this oh
[14:20] it's just you don't realize what a
[14:22] stream now I want to say I Sports P off
[14:30] lot of people say brother Brandon with
[14:31] the ministry of that type I have to
[14:33] watch because people just take them
[14:34] tapes just try to pick them to pieces
[14:35] you know so when uh they said brother BR
[14:39] wish we had a Ministry you don't know
[14:41] what you're
[14:44] saying yeah honest you don't know what
[14:48] goes with it brothers and
[14:50] sisters and the
[14:52] responsibility when you got people hangs
[14:55] to what you say remember if you tell
[14:58] them wrong
[14:59] God will require their blood at your
[15:03] hands and you think of
[15:06] that it's a terrific thing so be
[15:11] lovely love Jesus with all your heart
[15:14] just F be simple don't never try to try
[15:16] to figure out anything just be simple
[15:18] before God because more you try to
[15:20] figure out the farther you get away from
[15:21] him see just simply believe him say now
[15:24] well when will he come if he comes today
[15:27] all right if he comes 20 years years
[15:29] from now still all right I'm going to go
[15:30] just the way I'm going now following him

[15:37] my great great great great grandchildren
[15:39] still live to see it coming let Lord I

[15:48] somewhere coming down to that glorious
[15:50] Palace shter that kingdom of God there

[16:10] young woman and a young man standing
[16:12] there and never can get old never can be
[16:15] sinful never can be anything of jealousy
[16:18] or hatred or
[16:20] anything oh my I think a tapes is off
[16:23] now I just got about three four minutes
[16:25] I want to talk to you is that all right
[16:27] yeah amen amen now this is just
[16:30] personal because tomorrow I that's going
[16:33] to be so tremendous I think I just
[16:35] better say it now see I go
[16:38] stand uh this is just for us now I was
[16:42] just um you know uh I got a wife that I
[16:46] love and that's me and I I would not
[16:50] even a maritor because my love for my
[16:52] first wife and yet as much as I cared
[16:55] for her I I wouldn't have married her if
[16:57] it hadn't been God told me to do it and
[17:00] you know the story of it how she went to
[17:02] pray and how I did and he told me
[17:04] exactly what to do and go Mar at that
[17:06] time to do it she's a lovely woman and
[17:09] she's praying for me tonight and so now
[17:11] it's 8:00 at home she's probably praying
[17:14] now now
[17:17] notice one day she said to me she said
[17:21] Bill she said I'm just want to ask you a
[17:23] question about heaven I said all right
[17:26] mey what is it she said you you know I
[17:29] love you I said yep right after this
[17:31] happened up here she said you know that
[17:35] hope loved you too I said yeah and she
[17:39] said now she said I don't think I would
[17:42] be jealous she said but hope was and she
[17:45] said now when we get to heaven and you
[17:47] said you seen her there I said she was
[17:49] there I've seen her I've seen her twice
[17:52] there she's there she's waiting for me
[17:55] to come so is a so is Sharon I've seen
[17:58] her just the same I'm looking at you I
[18:01] seen her there and I said she said well
[18:04] now when we get over there said which
[18:06] ones go to be your wife I said both of
[18:09] you there won't be
[18:12] any yet both of you be she said I can't
[18:16] understand it and I said now honey sit
[18:18] down let me explain something to
[18:20] you I said now I know you love me and
[18:23] you know how I love you and respects and
[18:25] honor now for instance what if I dress
[18:29] up went downtown and some
[18:31] little prostitute real pretty come throw
[18:35] her arms around me and say oh brother
[18:37] brandom I sure love you start putting
[18:40] her arms around me hugging me what' you
[18:41] think she said I don't think I'd like
[18:43] that very
[18:44] well and uh I said um I want to ask you
[18:48] something do you who do you love the
[18:50] best if had to be a showdown me or the
[18:53] Lord Jesus asked his family talking and
[18:56] she said the Lord Jesus said yes bill as
[18:58] much as I love you but before I would
[19:01] give him up I'd give you up I said thank
[19:03] you honey I'm glad to hear you say that
[19:05] now I said now what if that same little
[19:08] woman would come up to Jesus and throw
[19:09] her arms around him and say Jesus I love
[19:11] you what would you think about that she
[19:12] said I'd enjoy
[19:16] that see it changes from felio to AG goo
[19:21] think it's a high love see and there's
[19:24] no such thing as husband and wife is as
[19:27] a raiseed children it's all gone the the
[19:29] female and male sex the glands are all
[19:32] they're all the same there see there's
[19:34] none of it no more see there's no sex
[19:36] glands at all not at all you're just
[19:40] just think of yourself without a sex
[19:41] gland the reason they were put in US is
[19:43] to repopulate the Earth you see but
[19:46] there there won't be any there there
[19:48] won't be neither male nor female gland
[19:51] God no but the statue of the art of God
[19:55] will be there that's exactly right but
[19:57] we'll be truly genuine no no felio at
[20:02] all all agapo see therefore a wife would
[20:05] be no more and just some lovely
[20:08] something it's it's yours and she you
[20:10] belong to each other there's no such
[20:12] thing as h no no not even see the fio
[20:15] part's not even there at all see there
[20:17] can't be anything like a jealousy ain't
[20:18] nothing to be jealous about there ain't
[20:20] no such a thing there you never know
[20:22] such a thing is that see and just the
[20:24] lovely uh young man and young women to
[20:28] live and then after she said I see it
[20:31] now Bill I said yes I want tell you a
[20:34] little thing happened this was a
[20:36] dream I was asleep and I've never told

[1:06:45] done that yearly for a couple of years
[1:06:48] now and it almost crept up on us um so
[1:06:52] we're kind of squeezing it in but I
[1:06:53] think it'll be a blessing for the men
[1:06:55] for the brothers to come together and to
[1:06:59] uh pray first and then there's a
[1:07:02] breakfast that we have and a few

[1:12:20] whosoever will let him take the water
[1:12:23] and whosoever will will let him take the
[1:12:26] Waters of Life freely for I testify unto
[1:12:30] every man that heareth the words of the
[1:12:32] prophecy of this book If any man shall
[1:12:35] add unto these things God shall add unto
[1:12:38] him the plagues that are written in this
[1:12:41] book and if any man shall take away from
[1:12:44] the words of the book of this prophecy
[1:12:47] God shall take away his part out of the
[1:12:49] book of life out of the holy city and
[1:12:53] from the things which are written
[1:12:55] in this book and our text is coming out
[1:12:59] of Ephesians chapter 6 verse number 17
[1:13:05] it says take the helmet of salvation and
[1:13:08] the sword of the spirit which is the
[1:13:11] word of God and that's the title The
[1:13:13] Sword of the spirit amen God add a
[1:13:16] blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:13:18] may be seated amen so glad to see the
[1:13:22] shers here this morning they're faithful
[1:13:25] Believers and they're here from Phoenix
[1:13:27] and um my good friend the brother there
[1:13:30] and his friend they've been around many
[1:13:33] many times and I haven't seen them for
[1:13:35] quite some time it's so good to hear him
[1:13:37] he called me yesterday so it's good to
[1:13:39] see them amen God bless you now we see
[1:13:43] the scriptures that we read here are
[1:13:47] admonishing us not to add or to take
[1:13:51] away from the word of the lord we read
[1:13:55] many scriptures for you last week about
[1:14:00] the um the words of the Lord being
[1:14:04] written down as a
[1:14:07] memorial and I'll just read through a
[1:14:09] few of those scriptures and just to set
[1:14:13] the foundation and put our minds on the
[1:14:16] same direction how God is the author of
[1:14:20] the word and he commanded that it be
[1:14:23] written down
[1:14:25] it was his
[1:14:27] intentions for it to be
[1:14:30] recorded it was never the intentions for
[1:14:33] it to go in one ear and out the
[1:14:36] other now if God can give us a memory so
[1:14:40] we can retain his words that's beautiful
[1:14:43] that's great amen some people have that
[1:14:45] retention ability but a lot of us can't
[1:14:49] retain it all in fact I know all of us
[1:14:52] we can't retain it all but we can get
[1:14:55] get something all right and hopefully
[1:14:57] you know more today than what you did
[1:15:00] when you started and this is the this is
[1:15:03] the beautiful thing it starts in Sunday
[1:15:05] school I believe or at home with Mom and
[1:15:08] Dad teaching you to memorize scripture
[1:15:13] St John
[1:15:14] 3:16 how many know that scripture do you
[1:15:17] even need to read your Bible it's been
[1:15:20] written in the table of your heart
[1:15:23] that's where it should be be its final
[1:15:26] resting place anyways for God so loved
[1:15:30] the world that he gave his only begotten
[1:15:34] son and it's written there there's the
[1:15:36] gospel message it's in the table of your
[1:15:39] heart now and the tables of your mind
[1:15:43] and in Exodus chapter 17 the Lord is
[1:15:48] moving from Moses to
[1:15:50] Joshua and it says in verse 13 and
[1:15:53] Joshua disc confited amalec and his
[1:15:57] people with the edge of The Sword and
[1:15:59] the Lord said unto Moses write this for
[1:16:03] a memorial in the book and rehearse it
[1:16:07] in the years of
[1:16:09] Joshua for I will utterly put out from
[1:16:13] remembrance amalik from the under the
[1:16:15] heavens so the Lord is telling Moses to
[1:16:18] write it down for a book of Memorial and
[1:16:22] after it's written down go reread read
[1:16:25] it to Joshua Joshua needs to hear it and
[1:16:29] if you can get Joshua a copy get him a
[1:16:31] copy
[1:16:32] too um Exodus 341 and the Lord said unto
[1:16:36] Moses heue thee two tables of stone like
[1:16:40] unto the first and I will write upon
[1:16:42] these tables the words that were in the
[1:16:45] first table which you broke breest and
[1:16:50] the Lord said unto Moses Exodus
[1:16:52] 34:27 says write thou these words for
[1:16:57] after the tenor of these words I have
[1:17:00] made a covenant with thee and with
[1:17:04] Israel Deuteronomy 1718 and 20 goes in
[1:17:09] detail about how a king should take the
[1:17:13] words of the Lord the law of Moses and
[1:17:17] rehearse those I think it's good for a
[1:17:20] king I think it's good for a pastor I
[1:17:21] think it's good for a mom or dad I think
[1:17:23] it's good for every everybody to take
[1:17:26] the word of the Lord and rehearse and
[1:17:29] reread and re internalize and
[1:17:37] redigested upon his throne of his
[1:17:40] kingdom that he shall write him a copy
[1:17:42] of this law and a book out of that which
[1:17:44] is before the priest the Levites and it
[1:17:47] shall be with him and he shall read
[1:17:50] therein all the days of his life that he
[1:17:53] may love learn to fear the lord his God
[1:17:58] you see the purpose now it's not just so
[1:18:01] you can win a a a scripture memorization
[1:18:06] contest it's not so that you can argue
[1:18:09] but that you can fear the word of the
[1:18:12] Lord Thy word Lord have I hid in my
[1:18:17] heart that I don't sin against you
[1:18:20] that's the purpose of it to take that
[1:18:23] word and let Let It Be inscribed in your
[1:18:27] spirit down in your heart the scriptures
[1:18:30] in Jeremiah 36 1-4 says and it came to
[1:18:34] pass the fourth year of jeaken the son
[1:18:38] of Josiah king of Judah that this word
[1:18:40] came unto Jeremiah from the Lord saying
[1:18:44] take thee a rooll of a book and write
[1:18:47] therein all the words that I have spoken
[1:18:50] unto thee against Israel and against
[1:18:53] Judah and against all the nations from
[1:18:57] the day I spake unto thee from the days
[1:19:00] of Josiah even unto this day it may be
[1:19:04] that the house of Judah will hear all
[1:19:08] the evil which I purpose to do unto them
[1:19:11] that they may return every man from his
[1:19:14] evil way that I may forgive their
[1:19:18] iniquity and their sin and so this is
[1:19:21] the purpose that we read it in fact no
[1:19:24] service is complete without reading the
[1:19:28] word that's the reason why we come is to
[1:19:32] hear the words of the
[1:19:35] Lord something a crumb one scripture
[1:19:39] half of a scripture a whole chapter
[1:19:43] whatever something that the Lord spoke
[1:19:45] to me today from his word now many of us
[1:19:49] know who's here and who's not here many
[1:19:52] of us know what time it is and what time
[1:19:54] time I should be
[1:19:57] done many of us know a lot of things but
[1:20:00] when we leave from here I trust that we
[1:20:04] got something written in our heart from
[1:20:07] the word of God it's sad many pulpits
[1:20:10] today you coming to church and you're
[1:20:13] getting the politics of the day you're
[1:20:15] getting the news of the day you're
[1:20:18] getting the pastor's personal feelings
[1:20:20] of the day but I want to get the word of
[1:20:22] the Lord and that's what my ears and our
[1:20:26] ears should be in tune to
[1:20:28] hear I guarantee you if you come I I
[1:20:31] love brother Chris's testimony as he
[1:20:33] talked that he was a Catholic and I've
[1:20:35] been to a Catholic mass a number of them
[1:20:37] here recently actually and you know I
[1:20:40] have all the little things that they do
[1:20:41] and the little things and they they
[1:20:44] Crossing themselves and doing all this
[1:20:46] but when that priest or whoever it is
[1:20:48] some sometimes it's a woman up at the
[1:20:50] mic whoever it is that's reading the
[1:20:53] word of the Lord man and I stand to
[1:20:56] attention my spirit is like oh yes I'm
[1:21:00] eating now something's good going to
[1:21:02] happen now because it's the word of the
[1:21:04] Lord and I think if we came to church
[1:21:07] with that attitude we would be less
[1:21:11] disappointed I will disappoint you
[1:21:13] brother sister will disappoint you our
[1:21:16] skills and talents will disappoint you
[1:21:18] but if you came here and they read the
[1:21:21] word you should be
[1:21:23] full you should have said amen that's
[1:21:26] enough to dance on right there just
[1:21:29] hearing the word the word of the Lord is
[1:21:31] being preaching somebody take off
[1:21:33] running set on fire like well we ain't
[1:21:37] even singing We Don't Need No music to
[1:21:39] dance I tell you what the reason why we
[1:21:43] dance is written right here amen the
[1:21:47] word of the Lord elevated in your life
[1:21:52] elevated in our services
[1:21:55] elevated in our expectations and you
[1:21:57] won't be so mad it'll put a smile on
[1:22:01] your face just from the reading of the
[1:22:05] word now can I close
[1:22:08] now
[1:22:09] huh can I keep going young man said I
[1:22:13] keep going so he don't have no kids he
[1:22:14] ain't married and he said keep
[1:22:18] going but the word of the Lord that's
[1:22:21] why we came here
[1:22:22] Saints amen don't leave here upset with
[1:22:26] your mouth stuck out talking about what
[1:22:28] they didn't do or what didn't happen did
[1:22:30] they read the word did you say Amen
[1:22:35] thank you then it should be complete
[1:22:38] because this is the highlight of the
[1:22:41] service this is the Highlight this is
[1:22:44] the highlight of Our Lives is God's word
[1:22:47] and God wanted it to be recorded and
[1:22:50] written down Deuteronomy 30 vers number
[1:22:54] 10
[1:22:55] says if Thou shalt hearken unto the
[1:22:57] voice of the Lord thy God to keep his
[1:22:59] Commandments and his statutes which are
[1:23:02] written in this book of the law and if
[1:23:04] thou turn unto the Lord thy God with all
[1:23:07] thy heart and with all thy soul for this
[1:23:11] commandment which I command thee this
[1:23:13] day it is not hidden from the neither is
[1:23:16] it far off it is not in heaven that thou
[1:23:20] sh say who shall go for us to heaven and
[1:23:23] bring it unto us that we may hear it and
[1:23:25] do it neither is it beyond the sea that
[1:23:28] thou should as say who shall go over for
[1:23:31] the sea for us and bring it unto us that
[1:23:33] we may hear it and do it but the word is
[1:23:37] very nigh unto thee even in thy mouth
[1:23:41] and in thy heart that thou May how did
[1:23:45] it get in your
[1:23:47] heart before it can get in your mouth it
[1:23:49] had to get in your heart how did it get
[1:23:51] in your
[1:23:52] heart somebody had to read that to you
[1:23:55] somebody had to speak that to you
[1:23:58] somebody had to bring the word of the
[1:24:00] Lord to you and you catch it and then
[1:24:04] you place it in your heart there's the
[1:24:07] blessing right there the work can be
[1:24:09] flying all around you the work could be
[1:24:12] laying on your shelves the work could be
[1:24:14] in your phone or tablet but if if it
[1:24:17] ain't in your heart we missed
[1:24:22] it it's a strikeout it's a it's a
[1:24:24] terrible Miss if it ain't in your heart
[1:24:27] Romans 2:11 says there's no respect of
[1:24:30] persons with God for as many have sinned
[1:24:33] without the law shall also perish
[1:24:36] without the law and as many as have Sinn
[1:24:38] in the law shall be judged by the law
[1:24:40] for not the hearers of the law are just
[1:24:43] before God but the doers of the law
[1:24:45] shall be
[1:24:46] justified for when the Gentiles which
[1:24:49] have not the law do by Nature the things
[1:24:52] contained in the law these having not
[1:24:55] the law are a law unto themselves which
[1:24:59] show the work of the law what written in
[1:25:03] their hearts their conscience also
[1:25:06] bearing witness and their thoughts the
[1:25:09] mean while accusing or excusing one
[1:25:14] another you know you don't have to have
[1:25:17] your Bible out in front of you knowing
[1:25:21] that something is right or wrong if
[1:25:24] somebody read something out of the Bible
[1:25:27] to you it's written in your heart and in
[1:25:29] your conscience so then when you go to
[1:25:32] do something that word pops up that's
[1:25:35] what we want anyways want that word to
[1:25:37] come to the Forefront of whatever you're
[1:25:39] about to do or say any act you're going
[1:25:43] to engage into you want the word of the
[1:25:46] Lord whatever format however it came
[1:25:49] into your heart you want that to come up
[1:25:51] and remember that now
[1:25:54] the beauty of this word is when you keep
[1:25:58] it in its
[1:26:00] completeness it's beautiful it's
[1:26:02] powerful when we don't take nothing from
[1:26:05] it it's holds its
[1:26:10] Integrity when we just say it in its
[1:26:14] rawest form the unedited
[1:26:17] version and this is um what we want we
[1:26:21] we want to be have our integrity that uh
[1:26:25] we want to be unimpaired we wanted to be
[1:26:28] honest everything that we say and do and
[1:26:30] that's what that's the way we want the
[1:26:31] word you know the the word of the Lord
[1:26:35] had to be recorded from people who had
[1:26:39] the Integrity to keep the text the
[1:26:43] text and don't add to it based upon how
[1:26:47] it's going to affect you or your family
[1:26:49] or your
[1:26:50] friends I need you to record my word
[1:26:55] and I might be recording you might have
[1:26:57] to record something that's to your own
[1:27:00] detriment but if you have the Integrity
[1:27:03] of the
[1:27:04] word the Integrity in your
[1:27:07] ministry the Integrity as a
[1:27:10] Christian you're not going to twist none
[1:27:14] of the scriptures none of the quotes or
[1:27:17] anything you'll just say it let the text
[1:27:21] keep its integrity and if you can't
[1:27:24] handle it that way then leave it
[1:27:27] alone
[1:27:29] amen
[1:27:31] amen you're not in you don't have
[1:27:33] integrity if you don't let the text
[1:27:35] speak The Way It Was Written that's
[1:27:38] right the the text in itself has its own
[1:27:43] original Integrity it came the way it
[1:27:46] did there's some areas that look a
[1:27:48] little rough a little tough the
[1:27:50] vernacular doesn't work in all uh you
[1:27:52] know ages and times doesn't speak well
[1:27:55] in this group and that group but you
[1:27:57] still got to say what it
[1:27:59] said amen now in keeping the Integrity
[1:28:03] of the text it might mean you lose your
[1:28:06] job you might lose some
[1:28:09] friends you might lose a lot of things
[1:28:12] but you will gain favor with the Lord if
[1:28:16] you stay with the original text the
[1:28:19] unedited version the one that we must
[1:28:23] Embrace and so with this this thought I
[1:28:26] like to approach the new versions of the
[1:28:30] Bible that we have
[1:28:32] today many of them have lost this
[1:28:35] Integrity I think there's 16
[1:28:38] scriptures that are not in many of the
[1:28:41] new versions of the
[1:28:43] Bible the King James version has a
[1:28:48] certain amount and then the new versions
[1:28:51] have taken out part of some of those
[1:28:54] versions be some of those verses because
[1:28:57] they're not valid it that's right for
[1:28:59] for whatever their mind whatever it is
[1:29:02] they they come up with and so um the
[1:29:05] prophet of God takes the King James
[1:29:08] version and that's what he use not
[1:29:12] criticizing the other versions they have
[1:29:15] their part their Noble works and and
[1:29:18] that you can refer to them that's great
[1:29:21] that's nice but if I'm going to point a
[1:29:24] class or a group of people or a young
[1:29:25] man coming up I just say stick with the
[1:29:28] Bible that the prophet
[1:29:29] used stick with the Bible that that
[1:29:32] Pillar of Fire came down over amen now
[1:29:36] the other versions are great the
[1:29:38] vernacular is smoother it's easier
[1:29:40] reading it's you know it's you know they
[1:29:43] they they they made it they have all
[1:29:45] kind of versions of the Bible but be
[1:29:47] careful because Satan probably has a
[1:29:51] version too
[1:29:54] and it probably will be coming out and
[1:29:56] he started coming out with more and more
[1:29:58] I'm going to take two scriptures that
[1:30:00] are not in your King James Version Bible
[1:30:03] Acts
[1:30:04] 8:37 1 John
[1:30:08] 57-8 now this one in Acts chapter 8: 37
[1:30:12] is a seemingly I brought this on
[1:30:14] Thursday night to the Saints there and
[1:30:16] some of the Saints there in on Thursday
[1:30:18] night in
[1:30:19] Phoenix and it goes so much deeper than
[1:30:22] this you know you have some guys some
[1:30:24] gentlemen out there that are called the
[1:30:26] King James only people and they they
[1:30:29] call any other Bible a work of the devil
[1:30:33] some of them do that's that wasn't the
[1:30:35] attitude of the prophet he you know he
[1:30:38] he included that the ls of Bible and all
[1:30:41] the other new work Bibles they have
[1:30:44] their place but look at verses 8 verses
[1:30:47] 37 and chapter 8th chapter of Acts and
[1:30:50] Philip said if thou believest with all
[1:30:53] thine heart
[1:30:54] thou mayest and he answered and said I
[1:30:57] believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of
[1:31:01] God that verse is not in many of the
[1:31:06] newer translations you won't find it
[1:31:09] here's the one that really gets me it's
[1:31:12] 1 John 5:7 it's debatable it's been used
[1:31:15] in debates on the godhead and the
[1:31:20] Oneness of the godhead they've the
[1:31:23] trinitarian Ians are very well happy
[1:31:26] that this verse isn't in some of the
[1:31:28] newer Bibles and here's why let me read
[1:31:31] it in the King James vergins 1 John 5:
[1:31:37] 7-8 for there are three that bear record
[1:31:39] in heaven the Father the word and the
[1:31:42] Holy Ghost these three are
[1:31:46] one and there are three that bear
[1:31:48] witness in Earth the spirit and the
[1:31:50] water and the blood and these three
[1:31:53] agree in
[1:31:54] one now here's a version here I think
[1:31:57] this is the NIV says for there are three
[1:32:00] that Testify the spirit the water and
[1:32:03] the blood and the three are in
[1:32:07] agreement and that's
[1:32:09] it amen that that's all of it so if
[1:32:13] you're raised in a church under this
[1:32:16] version of the Bible and have never read
[1:32:19] the King James version which the prophet
[1:32:21] explained the Father the word in the
[1:32:24] spirit then you can see the discrepancy
[1:32:26] there and and here here here's here's
[1:32:30] where it's a big deal you say brother
[1:32:32] Israel that's just one scripture that's
[1:32:34] where it
[1:32:37] starts you're not holding the Integrity
[1:32:40] of the text if you don't keep it the way
[1:32:42] it originally
[1:32:45] was so if I can take away one scripture
[1:32:48] today and then the next Generation take
[1:32:51] away two or three scriptures then what
[1:32:53] we going to to have in a few
[1:32:55] years so this is why maintaining the
[1:32:58] protection that God put in writing the
[1:33:02] word down first recording it yes writing
[1:33:06] it down rehearsing it now he's going to
[1:33:09] protect it by saying don't add or take
[1:33:12] away from it he caps both ends of it
[1:33:15] don't add to it don't take nothing away
[1:33:19] from it that keeps that keeps the power
[1:33:23] of the that keeps the power of the word
[1:33:26] intact that's the way we want it in its
[1:33:30] original form amen
[1:33:33] somebody and so this adding or
[1:33:37] takeway is is just simply a no no so
[1:33:42] let's go even further in that thought
[1:33:44] the adding or taking away is is even
[1:33:49] adding an
[1:33:51] interpretation that God never gave
[1:33:56] so you're not just adding words I'm
[1:33:58] going to add a new verse but if you add
[1:34:01] an interpretation to the verse to the
[1:34:04] word that God never gave you're in
[1:34:07] violation of adding or taking
[1:34:10] away this is very very important Saints
[1:34:13] yes it is because Satan like a roaring
[1:34:16] lion seeking how he can take away or add
[1:34:21] something because when he does that he
[1:34:23] makes the word say something that it
[1:34:25] does not say now brother vanam deals
[1:34:28] with some of this in the message
[1:34:31] recognizing your day in this message he
[1:34:32] talked about splicing
[1:34:36] tapes two places here recognizing your
[1:34:40] day in this message paragraph number
[1:34:43] 29 let me see if that's what I want
[1:34:47] yes notice again the Seven Seals which I
[1:34:50] had no idea it was that here the
[1:34:53] Tabernacle he spoke it and sent me to
[1:34:56] Tucson Arizona telling you all what
[1:34:59] happened what would happen and there is
[1:35:02] men sitting present today who has who
[1:35:05] was there to see it
[1:35:12] happen just exactly the way it was told
[1:35:15] here would happen seven angels would
[1:35:18] come then the newspaper packed that and
[1:35:21] the magazines Across the Nation
[1:35:24] mysterious circle of light in the form
[1:35:26] of a pyramid just like I drawed it here
[1:35:29] and showed you raised up from where
[1:35:31] those angels were standing and went 30
[1:35:35] mil high and was 27 miles across or
[1:35:38] either 27 miles high and 30 mil across I
[1:35:43] forget which it was and was seen through
[1:35:46] the states just above tcon Arizona right
[1:35:49] where it happened same time see the
[1:35:52] Bible God is is not just this is just
[1:35:55] not someone trying to press something to
[1:35:57] you but to reveal to you the very
[1:36:01] spiritual application of this hour and
[1:36:04] then the next message that opened up the
[1:36:07] Seven Seals which undone all the hidden
[1:36:10] mysteries of the Bible the doctrines and
[1:36:13] so forth which the world so rudely
[1:36:16] attacks nowadays attacks it and says
[1:36:20] it's wrong this that here the other day
[1:36:23] in AR Ona splicing tapes to try to make
[1:36:27] me say things that I didn't
[1:36:30] say just remember the vision about the
[1:36:33] Arizona proposition the Bible said it
[1:36:36] was far better for you that you had a
[1:36:39] rock at your neck and another thing that
[1:36:42] whosoever let him be preacher or what he
[1:36:45] will will take one word away from it add
[1:36:48] one word to it people putting their own
[1:36:51] interpretation upon the word as it's
[1:36:54] been given trying to make it say
[1:36:57] something that I did not say and not my
[1:37:00] it's and not my word it's his word who
[1:37:04] shall add to or take away you know this
[1:37:07] splicing of tapes you can do that in the
[1:37:11] text you can do that in
[1:37:13] preaching you can do that in arguing
[1:37:17] knowing full well there's more context
[1:37:20] on the subject but for you to get a
[1:37:22] point across you only want to highlight
[1:37:25] one part of it that's not being that's
[1:37:28] not holding the Integrity I can't have
[1:37:31] any respect for a man or a woman that
[1:37:33] would do that take bits and pieces of a
[1:37:37] vision bits and pieces of a message and
[1:37:41] try to make it say something that it
[1:37:44] does not say just because I can't
[1:37:47] explain it all I have to twist it and
[1:37:49] turn it to make it more palatable for
[1:37:52] you but God gave it to us the way he
[1:37:55] gave it to us can't we be honest enough
[1:37:59] just to say what he
[1:38:01] said huh is that
[1:38:04] right you know I've had this let me pull
[1:38:08] over here just a minute I've had this
[1:38:10] question asked me so many times y'all
[1:38:13] excuse me for this so but I have to say
[1:38:15] it I had this question asked me so many
[1:38:17] times concerning the church said brother
[1:38:19] Israel do you believe the return
[1:38:22] Ministry people have asked me
[1:38:25] that checking out checking out the uh
[1:38:28] you know our my Ministry or what I
[1:38:31] believe you know they don't want to know
[1:38:33] how I got saved they don't want to know
[1:38:34] what kind of Christian I am they just
[1:38:36] want to know that one little
[1:38:39] part because if you believe that one
[1:38:42] little part I'm GNA put you in a box I'm
[1:38:44] going to judge you I'm going to deal
[1:38:46] with you I mean there's so many more
[1:38:48] things that we could talk about let's
[1:38:51] talk about fishing
[1:38:53] let's talk about something else but you
[1:38:56] want to talk about that one little part
[1:38:59] and why so I always say uh I don't know
[1:39:03] what you're talking
[1:39:05] about in that language a return Ministry
[1:39:09] I don't have any quotes for that but now
[1:39:11] if you're talking about Visions brother
[1:39:13] will oh yes I believe all of
[1:39:17] those I believe all of the Visions
[1:39:20] that's not a problem at all no man no no
[1:39:24] no there's no man there's no group of
[1:39:26] people going to make me feel ashamed for
[1:39:28] believing any of the
[1:39:30] Visions you got to be careful how the
[1:39:32] devil would twist that on you right
[1:39:35] following some doctrine of people and
[1:39:37] what other brothers did with the word
[1:39:39] and how they mishandled it and how they
[1:39:41] got out on the Forefront they said we
[1:39:43] the people that believe this and the
[1:39:44] people that that's just
[1:39:46] lazy
[1:39:48] laziness if you want to know what
[1:39:50] somebody believes sit down and talk to
[1:39:51] them in the word and find find out what
[1:39:54] they believe out of God's
[1:39:58] word and these banners and titles that
[1:40:01] we call people to judge one another by
[1:40:05] find out what the brother believes in
[1:40:06] the word does he believe every word then
[1:40:10] he's one of your
[1:40:11] brothers
[1:40:13] amen so brother vandom is dealing with
[1:40:15] this splicing of the tapes in paragraph
[1:40:18] 220 he says this in light of this hour
[1:40:22] that we're now living the light of the
[1:40:24] day that we're now living in precious
[1:40:25] and beloved ones who come from different
[1:40:27] states across the country let us now me
[1:40:31] with you on this altar let us take
[1:40:34] inventory how is the spirit of God in
[1:40:38] our hearts today remember it's the
[1:40:41] spirit uncondemned
[1:40:43] uncontaminated any church doctrine
[1:40:46] everything has gone completely amen you
[1:40:49] would be Daron to try to add to that or
[1:40:54] take from it for if you do try to put
[1:40:57] the interpretation on it yourself your
[1:41:01] part is taken from The Book of Life are
[1:41:04] you trying to say something that the
[1:41:06] spirit hasn't said are you trying to
[1:41:10] make it sound like it said something or
[1:41:13] you just take it exactly what it said
[1:41:16] and leave it like that are you splicing
[1:41:20] cutting taping doing things that's not
[1:41:23] not right have you say well I just don't
[1:41:26] feel like I should do this or maybe I
[1:41:28] know my church don't believe it that's
[1:41:30] just one man's word about it that one
[1:41:33] man is
[1:41:34] God the Bible here says you should not
[1:41:37] cut your hair the Bible said it shall
[1:41:39] come to pass women wear garments like a
[1:41:42] man and how they would be an Abomination
[1:41:44] to God how the Holy Spirit spoke through
[1:41:47] it this humble unworthy vessel that just
[1:41:49] happened to be standing present in the
[1:41:51] age that that great king said here is my
[1:41:55] suprer my word here's my scepter rather
[1:41:58] take my scepter and go forth and bring
[1:42:01] the
[1:42:03] message so this keeping the Integrity of
[1:42:06] the word keeping the Integrity of the
[1:42:08] quote that is what our heart's desire is
[1:42:13] this is where when you come into a
[1:42:16] conversation you don't have a message I
[1:42:18] don't have a message so I can't lose cuz
[1:42:22] I don't have nothing in the fight I'm
[1:42:25] just standing behind what already was
[1:42:27] said you know the Bible and standing
[1:42:30] with the word of God is not fighting in
[1:42:32] the word is find out if you you're right
[1:42:34] and they're wrong on the word you can't
[1:42:36] be wrong if you're just staying with
[1:42:38] what the word says it's not your word
[1:42:43] it's God's
[1:42:45] word and he's the one who brings it to
[1:42:49] pass now
[1:42:51] this keeping this text together and
[1:42:54] keeping uh embracing that and holding
[1:42:58] that version of the word that God give
[1:43:01] this is how we want to approach every
[1:43:05] every other quote every scripture every
[1:43:07] Vision every book of the Bible this is
[1:43:10] how we approach it amen and so and and
[1:43:14] and and we just you know get our
[1:43:15] feelings out of it and just take what
[1:43:18] God said about it in his word now the
[1:43:22] prophet of God deals with this oneman
[1:43:25] message and I have to say that you know
[1:43:29] I I think many people get this confused
[1:43:32] with that the Onan message terminology
[1:43:36] bothers some people because they believe
[1:43:39] that you're saying it's one man to be
[1:43:42] saved or it's just one man that's in the
[1:43:44] body of Christ or the body of Christ
[1:43:46] it's a one man message because it's a
[1:43:50] prophet that brought the word but
[1:43:52] there's many
[1:43:53] men and women that follow it that are
[1:43:56] true believers many Elders pastors
[1:44:00] teachers uh people that follow the word
[1:44:04] women brothers sisters they're we're all
[1:44:06] included in that and it and this this
[1:44:12] the two highlights from the word is with
[1:44:15] Moses and Elijah this
[1:44:18] Moses had um the daans the koras that
[1:44:23] rose up against his authority in the
[1:44:25] word and these were brothers in the
[1:44:28] message of the day and they rose up
[1:44:30] against Moses and they said that Moses
[1:44:34] thought that he was the only one that
[1:44:36] had these gifts in his life Moses you're
[1:44:40] the only Holy One among us but you know
[1:44:43] who didn't have a problem with that was
[1:44:47] Joshua you know Caleb didn't have a
[1:44:50] problem with that they didn't have a
[1:44:52] problem with Moses's position in the
[1:44:55] word and they won't have a problem with
[1:44:58] it
[1:44:59] today because it wasn't about Moses
[1:45:03] being better than anyone this is what
[1:45:05] God made him in order to bring forth the
[1:45:10] Commandments and so him bringing forth
[1:45:13] the Commandments and God using them the
[1:45:16] way he did and highlighting and
[1:45:18] elevating his ministry the way he did
[1:45:21] you know why would I have a problem with
[1:45:25] that except I had the spirit of Dayan
[1:45:28] and Kora upon me this brother Ram deals
[1:45:32] with this in the message why it had to
[1:45:33] be Shepherds he says paragraph 112 now
[1:45:37] the word of God does not come to a
[1:45:40] theologian he's the one who messes it up
[1:45:43] that's right there's no such a thing as
[1:45:46] ever saying you saying well this guy's a
[1:45:48] theologian that just puts him further
[1:45:51] away from the were than anything I know
[1:45:54] of see the word of the Lord God the
[1:45:58] unchanging God never does change
[1:46:00] anywhere in the Bible the word of God
[1:46:02] always did come to prophets not to
[1:46:05] theologians or doctors to prophets and
[1:46:09] they always every time was refused and
[1:46:13] rejected now what's wrong with a
[1:46:16] theologian a theologian studies
[1:46:19] theology a biologist studies biology
[1:46:22] ology there's nothing wrong with a
[1:46:25] biologist and a theologian is a studier
[1:46:28] of the word they take the Theology and
[1:46:31] they break the words down biblically
[1:46:34] scripturally and they bring a better
[1:46:37] understanding of the history or the root
[1:46:39] of the word and they can study so much
[1:46:41] that they can get a doctor's degree and
[1:46:43] be able to explain it so
[1:46:46] well but the word of the Lord doesn't
[1:46:48] come to a
[1:46:50] theologian the word of the Lord comes to
[1:46:53] a prophet so the theologians today told
[1:46:58] us that the King James virgin Bible is
[1:47:01] old and out of date we need a new one
[1:47:04] but that's the Bible that the prophet
[1:47:07] used so what Bible do I want to
[1:47:11] use where do I want to stand with the
[1:47:14] Theology of the day or the prophetic
[1:47:18] inspiration of the day God calls the
[1:47:23] prophet and he uses the prophet to bring
[1:47:27] forth this word of the Lord amen amen
[1:47:30] Prophet God continues and who do you say
[1:47:34] this is
[1:47:35] 1964 the question comes up in the
[1:47:38] wilderness see now I want you to watch
[1:47:40] my brethren now remember these people
[1:47:43] enjoy them blessings they enjoy the
[1:47:45] preaching of this Prophet this anointed
[1:47:48] one they believed him they followed him
[1:47:50] but there rose up in the wilderness one
[1:47:52] by by the name of Dayan one by the name
[1:47:55] of Kora and they said this has got to be
[1:47:59] a oneman affair Moses thinks he's the
[1:48:02] only one God's called that one man
[1:48:06] message they didn't want it no they
[1:48:09] didn't want it and God never did deal
[1:48:12] but with one person at a time it's
[1:48:15] always a oneman message when did you
[1:48:18] ever when did he ever deal with the
[1:48:21] people outside of just one person it's
[1:48:24] an individual it ain't a group you're
[1:48:27] responsible to God each one of you you
[1:48:29] say oh I believe it just what you do you
[1:48:32] just entertain it you entertain a
[1:48:36] thought so brother brandom is bringing
[1:48:38] out this dayon and Kora how they had a
[1:48:43] problem with the one man message and God
[1:48:47] has used one man all the way through the
[1:48:49] Bible all the way through amen and then
[1:48:53] even in this last day a
[1:48:55] Onan message on the tape still a oneman
[1:49:00] Ministry for this
[1:49:03] day and many have a problem with that
[1:49:07] but some of us don't the True Believers
[1:49:10] don't have a problem with that and
[1:49:13] what's the what's the end goal then I
[1:49:16] can see almost where some of these
[1:49:19] brothers feel like they're the eighth
[1:49:21] messenger or they're taking brother
[1:49:22] Bon's place that's more scriptural I
[1:49:26] guess than this group idea that the
[1:49:29] five-fold ministry is trying to uh
[1:49:32] propagate that brother brandham is gone
[1:49:34] now he preached the word and now we have
[1:49:38] the spoken word we
[1:49:41] who which one of you have the spoken
[1:49:44] word God doesn't deal with groups of men
[1:49:48] like that but when it comes to the word
[1:49:50] of the lord The Authority the
[1:49:53] direction that the Church of the Living
[1:49:55] God is to follow that's a oneman
[1:49:59] Ministry now we all have our ministry
[1:50:01] that God calls us to each Minister has
[1:50:04] his ministry that God calls him to a
[1:50:07] wife her Ministry at home pastors
[1:50:10] evangelists whoever it may be they have
[1:50:12] their we have a Ministry yes but our
[1:50:15] ministry isn't that everybody here are
[1:50:19] tapes but there is a Ministry where
[1:50:22] every everybody has to hear their
[1:50:24] Tes it's a on man
[1:50:27] Ministry and you'll see that attitude
[1:50:30] flexing up more and more as we see the
[1:50:33] days
[1:50:35] approaching but my um my instruction to
[1:50:39] you my my job today is to remind you not
[1:50:42] to add or take away from anything that
[1:50:44] the prophet said or the Bible you know
[1:50:47] this this principle of not adding or
[1:50:49] taking away isn't just with the Bible
[1:50:52] it's with the
[1:50:54] message don't add or take away from
[1:50:58] it so some brother you'll send me a
[1:51:01] quote here's the explanation of the
[1:51:04] tent Reverend so and so Pastor so and so
[1:51:07] preached a beautiful message explaining
[1:51:10] the
[1:51:11] tent if you can't explain it by sending
[1:51:14] me a tape of the
[1:51:16] Prophet
[1:51:18] H
[1:51:20] what is that too much Saints
[1:51:25] I'm I'm just dumb like that I'm that
[1:51:27] dumb Caleb I'm picky eater picky
[1:51:31] eater I got to know where my food is
[1:51:33] coming from that's not my mom's cooking
[1:51:37] mom's quicking cooking ain't no question
[1:51:39] I'mma eat that mom cook it I'mma eat it
[1:51:43] now sister so and so brother so and so
[1:51:45] like who cooked
[1:51:47] that do they even know what a cornbread
[1:51:50] is
[1:51:52] can't just eat anybody's cornbread I can
[1:51:55] I only got so much space to get full
[1:51:57] it's got to be the right
[1:51:59] stuff
[1:52:00] huh this is spiritually speaking you
[1:52:04] know the explanation of the third pool
[1:52:07] if it ain't from the message or I've got
[1:52:11] to twist it and turn it and make it say
[1:52:14] something that it did not say I need to
[1:52:17] keep the Integrity of the vision and the
[1:52:20] way we do that we start by just saying
[1:52:24] what the playing what the prophet said
[1:52:27] about it start there that's your
[1:52:29] Baseline start right
[1:52:32] there many young people have an
[1:52:34] explanation of the great vision of the
[1:52:37] third pool they have explanation and
[1:52:40] they can't even see where brother random
[1:52:42] said it their explanation came through
[1:52:45] their Pastor or the Ministries today so
[1:52:49] we go online to look and see what this
[1:52:51] means or what that means why don't you
[1:52:53] pick up the prophet and let him explain
[1:52:56] and let him you know open it up the way
[1:52:59] he gave it was a progression the way he
[1:53:01] introduced it you just don't pick out
[1:53:04] highlights the part you want that makes
[1:53:06] it sound okay they can take this but
[1:53:08] they can't take that they can take this
[1:53:09] tell me everything he
[1:53:11] said bring it up from the 50s all the
[1:53:14] way up like how he brought it and then
[1:53:17] bring it all the way
[1:53:19] up amen there's nothing to hide
[1:53:25] am there's nothing that I'm trying to
[1:53:27] you know maintain I want to be right all
[1:53:30] the time I can't be but the word is
[1:53:33] right all the
[1:53:35] time so they had a problem with this one
[1:53:37] man message and I am warned to warn you
[1:53:42] stay with that original word of the
[1:53:46] Lord
[1:53:48] amen and that original word was given to
[1:53:52] a prophet can I move forward just a
[1:53:54] little bit so we don't add to we don't
[1:53:56] take away it's been written down we hold
[1:53:59] the complete Integrity of it and from
[1:54:02] beginning to end the the this
[1:54:03] comfortable places like marriage and
[1:54:06] divorce huh is that an easy tape is that
[1:54:11] for
[1:54:13] everybody yes or no it's for everybody
[1:54:16] in the bride but it's not for everybody
[1:54:17] in the world you know that that marriage
[1:54:21] and divorce tape it's like man brother
[1:54:24] Randon why you say it like that like
[1:54:28] wow man let me um H how can I do this
[1:54:32] let me see how can I do this let me
[1:54:34] think tap on my head see if I can think
[1:54:38] faster how should I do how should I
[1:54:41] approach the marriage and divorce this
[1:54:42] sister is talking about coming to the
[1:54:44] word she wants to know about these
[1:54:47] things eternal life and salvation wants
[1:54:50] to know about the message okay give her
[1:54:52] all the message but don't give her
[1:54:54] marriage and
[1:54:55] divorce because marriage and divorce
[1:54:57] might confuse her she's already confused
[1:55:00] yes sir that's the
[1:55:02] problem everybody is
[1:55:05] confused they need the light in its
[1:55:08] purest form to take off the rubber
[1:55:12] gloves and the games that people play
[1:55:14] about the truth of the original sin this
[1:55:19] is why we got the problems we have today
[1:55:22] because nobody told us the truth but a
[1:55:26] prophet came in his humility in the
[1:55:30] Integrity of staying with the vision he
[1:55:33] preached it when nobody else would he
[1:55:36] stood with it when nobody thought it was
[1:55:39] popular but look at his ministry
[1:55:42] today a huge portion of Heaven awaits
[1:55:47] you it's the harder way but it's my way
[1:55:54] hallah it's not easy to keep your
[1:55:57] integrity you got to say it when you
[1:55:59] don't want to say it say it when it
[1:56:01] hurts say it when it hurts your friends
[1:56:04] even your own
[1:56:08] children and we'll find out
[1:56:10] today in an age like this aren't you so
[1:56:14] glad he
[1:56:16] did aren't you glad that he kept it
[1:56:19] clean
[1:56:22] I'm so
[1:56:23] glad there's my confidence in the
[1:56:27] message he can't be Bal he can't be
[1:56:29] twisted he can't be you know manipulated
[1:56:32] he's going to say what God put in his
[1:56:34] mouth to
[1:56:36] say
[1:56:38] hallelujah
[1:56:40] amen write the
[1:56:42] vision make it plain so when the people
[1:56:46] read it they got something to run with
[1:56:50] they got something to talk about
[1:56:52] something to preach
[1:56:54] about
[1:56:56] amen praise His
[1:56:59] name so we hold that we keep that now
[1:57:03] there
[1:57:04] are some
[1:57:07] messages a number of them that are
[1:57:10] prophetic that brother randam preached
[1:57:12] as I wind down
[1:57:15] here he talks and I read one of them for
[1:57:17] you I think last week in that message
[1:57:23] the indictment how he says that a
[1:57:26] message like that couldn't have been
[1:57:27] preached 50 years
[1:57:30] ago and then he says it couldn't have
[1:57:32] been preached even 10 years ago from
[1:57:36] 1963 he says but today it can be
[1:57:39] preached what the
[1:57:42] indictment where they have turned their
[1:57:44] back on God any he put a thus sayith the
[1:57:47] Lord on this country he said that this
[1:57:50] nation can not in will not
[1:57:54] repent you know when I hear that and I
[1:57:56] really Embrace that then I stop fighting
[1:57:59] with these people out
[1:58:01] here it's not worth
[1:58:04] it you fighting with them and what they
[1:58:06] trying to do to our country look what
[1:58:07] they doing you know we need to take our
[1:58:09] country
[1:58:10] back uh-uh you need to go back to God
[1:58:15] that's the only that's taking the
[1:58:17] country back no no no it's going to the
[1:58:20] fire huh
[1:58:23] it's
[1:58:24] over I'm not I'm I'm not uh you know I'm
[1:58:27] not ignoring things that are wrong in
[1:58:29] this makes me mad too it inflames me too
[1:58:32] but at the end of the day it's like what
[1:58:33] I'm getting upset about what am I
[1:58:35] arguing with people I don't know
[1:58:38] about what am I all fired up about yes
[1:58:42] sir when that fire should be turned
[1:58:45] towards the word and he gives this
[1:58:47] message the indictment and he says it as
[1:58:50] a true 100% American who love this
[1:58:55] country and he said that this country
[1:58:58] will not and cannot
[1:59:01] repent it was a disgrace what they did
[1:59:04] to the word of the Lord they took this
[1:59:07] prophet in they took him to court try to
[1:59:09] take his money through the taxes and so
[1:59:11] forth probably help more Americans than
[1:59:14] many other Americans but they wanted to
[1:59:17] come after him said the spirit of the
[1:59:20] nation the spirit of all nations are
[1:59:23] ruled by
[1:59:24] Satan yeah that's not you know we can be
[1:59:27] you know we you know I'm I'm an American
[1:59:29] I'm a proud American and you're not more
[1:59:32] of American than I am I'm not more of
[1:59:34] you I'm just one that's
[1:59:37] it and the sentiments that I have have
[1:59:42] moved and shifted from what's going on
[1:59:44] in the neighborhood to what's going on
[1:59:46] in God's word and in my life that's what
[1:59:50] I want to be fired up about because
[1:59:52] that's what's going in the Rapture is
[1:59:55] the word that has been made Flesh on the
[1:59:58] tables of my
[2:00:00] heart
[2:00:02] huh
[2:00:03] yes you look at it long enough good
[2:00:06] enough you'll be mad too but stay with
[2:00:09] the word and you'll have something to
[2:00:11] preach about and stand for so this
[2:00:14] message the indictment was a timing
[2:00:16] message brother Bam put the timetable on
[2:00:19] there he put the timetable in 19 56 on
[2:00:23] this country but then in he says this
[2:00:26] attitude you couldn't see it um 10 years
[2:00:30] ago or 50 years ago and then he brings
[2:00:33] another message entitled the
[2:00:37] token and this message the
[2:00:40] token was another one of those timing
[2:00:45] messages he said that he was out in the
[2:00:47] woods and the Lord spoke to him and told
[2:00:50] him to they've gone up so far now bring
[2:00:54] this token message to them what was the
[2:00:58] message of the token it was Israel were
[2:01:02] enslaves for hundreds and hundreds of
[2:01:05] years and and then finally there there
[2:01:08] there came a deliverer and the deliverer
[2:01:11] was a prophet Moses and then finally
[2:01:13] there's a message of the Passover of the
[2:01:17] blood being
[2:01:18] applied now we know you're all Jews we
[2:01:21] know you you been circumcised we know
[2:01:24] that you have you know you you you're a
[2:01:26] part of the Great economy of the Hebrew
[2:01:31] but but this is another level here we're
[2:01:34] going into an exodus and so now I'm
[2:01:38] going to require a token from every
[2:01:40] household even if you're the lineage of
[2:01:43] Levi or Reuben or Gad or whatever
[2:01:46] lineage if you don't come under the
[2:01:48] token you'll be left out and that's what
[2:01:52] this message the token was and brother
[2:01:54] Brandon brings it out in um I'm going to
[2:01:57] take paragraph 74
[2:01:59] 9399 and paragraph 37 137 in that
[2:02:03] message and just bring it up to you
[2:02:07] okay the prophet of God says this
[2:02:17] here showing the timetable and bringing
[2:02:20] it
[2:02:20] through and there's a benefit to
[2:02:23] it you know in this token he talks about
[2:02:27] the Assurance how when you have it
[2:02:29] applied in your life then there's no
[2:02:33] worries all the pressure is taken away
[2:02:36] and he says this here paragraph number
[2:02:38] 74 and the message the token said this
[2:02:41] is the evening time of the age that we
[2:02:44] live
[2:02:45] in this is the evening time for the
[2:02:48] church this is the evening time for me
[2:02:52] me this is the evening time of my
[2:02:55] message I'm dying I'm going I'm moving
[2:02:59] out in the evening time of the gospel
[2:03:03] and we just come through justification
[2:03:06] so forth but this is the time that the
[2:03:09] token has to be
[2:03:12] applied I told you last Sunday I had
[2:03:15] something I want to talk to you about
[2:03:18] this is it the time that when you just
[2:03:22] can't play with it it's got to be done
[2:03:25] if it's ever going to be done it's got
[2:03:28] to be done now because we can see that
[2:03:31] the Wrath is about ready to pass through
[2:03:34] the land and everything from under the
[2:03:37] token will perish the blood has
[2:03:42] identifies you so brother bam continues
[2:03:46] on what a solemn portion of of word
[2:03:49] there now that doesn't stay solemn that
[2:03:53] doesn't stay interesting if you don't
[2:03:55] read it and you can just forget about it
[2:03:58] you say he didn't say it but for those
[2:04:00] of us who can pick it up and read it it
[2:04:03] does something to us I say either that
[2:04:05] means something or it don't mean nothing
[2:04:07] he's just talking to them back there or
[2:04:09] maybe brother Bam could have been wrong
[2:04:11] maybe or does it really mean what he
[2:04:14] said it
[2:04:15] meant I think we all have to be honest
[2:04:17] and start with what did it say
[2:04:22] and then from there you give me what
[2:04:25] your version of it is you tell me what
[2:04:28] it
[2:04:30] means we have to do that with every
[2:04:32] scripture everything that God brings to
[2:04:35] us brother brandom continues on in the
[2:04:37] paragraph number 93 and he says this
[2:04:39] here it's been the lamb all the way
[2:04:42] through it was the lamb in Luther's time
[2:04:45] it was the lamb in Wesley's time but now
[2:04:49] is the token time that each house house
[2:04:52] must be covered by the token each house
[2:04:56] of God must be covered by the token all
[2:05:00] that's inside of it must be covered by
[2:05:02] the token and the house of God is the
[2:05:04] body of Jesus Christ and by one Spirit
[2:05:07] we're all baptized into this token and
[2:05:09] become part of it that God said when I
[2:05:12] see the token displayed I'll pass over
[2:05:15] you what an hour that we're now living
[2:05:22] oh brother he says paragraph 99 the hour
[2:05:25] of that token to be displayed is at hand
[2:05:29] we can see it we know that we're near
[2:05:31] the end now we brought all kind of
[2:05:33] messages up to show signs and wonders
[2:05:36] and now here we come back for what the
[2:05:38] church has got to do the token has got
[2:05:41] to be displayed when I see the blood I
[2:05:44] will pass over you nothing else would
[2:05:47] work it must be the blood now the holy
[2:05:51] ghost is our token from
[2:05:55] God
[2:05:57] Amen he goes a little bit
[2:06:00] further and he says
[2:06:03] this paragraph
[2:06:06] 137 how many love the Lord
[2:06:08] today amen paragraph 137 he says this
[2:06:12] here when I see the token I'll pass over
[2:06:15] you it's God's requirement of the
[2:06:19] hour the evening time message is to
[2:06:22] apply the token Satan has throw all
[2:06:26] kinds of counterfeits of shaking hands
[2:06:29] evidence everything like that forget it
[2:06:31] the hour has arrived that the token
[2:06:34] itself not some counterfeit make belie
[2:06:38] substitutionary anything the hour is
[2:06:40] here when the token himself is
[2:06:43] identifying himself right Among Us and
[2:06:46] proving that what he is the same Jesus
[2:06:50] yesterday today and forever he's right
[2:06:54] with the word amen
[2:06:59] amen I like what he says in paragraph
[2:07:01] 147 says now the spirit is the
[2:07:05] token you shall be filled with the Holy
[2:07:07] Ghost not many days hence and when the
[2:07:10] blood was shed the token was sent down
[2:07:13] on the day of Pentecost like a Russian
[2:07:15] Mighty win that was the theme of every
[2:07:19] Apostle yes that was have you received
[2:07:23] the Holy Ghost since you believe repent
[2:07:27] every one of you and be baptized in the
[2:07:30] name of Jesus Christ is that still our
[2:07:34] theme is that still the theme of every
[2:07:37] Apostle sir absolutely all through your
[2:07:40] Bible that was the
[2:07:42] theme have you received the Holy
[2:07:46] Ghost since you
[2:07:49] believe now brother brand says a
[2:07:52] wonderful thing in this
[2:07:54] message many of them but in paragraph
[2:07:57] 203 he says
[2:08:07] this let's move forward just to save a
[2:08:09] little bit time let's take paragraph 338
[2:08:13] okay all right Saints the prophet of God
[2:08:17] says the token is the sign that the
[2:08:21] purch has been made and been accepted
[2:08:24] now you can't get the token from the
[2:08:27] railroad uh Fair until you pay the price
[2:08:31] and the only way you're going to pay the
[2:08:32] price is pay it that's right what
[2:08:37] believe it accept it now here's right
[2:08:40] right right here here here it is right
[2:08:42] here full
[2:08:44] obedience to part of the
[2:08:47] word am I reading that right you say
[2:08:51] brother I believe the word do you
[2:08:54] believe the whole
[2:08:56] word like all of
[2:08:59] it see the whole
[2:09:02] point in keeping the word from not
[2:09:06] adding or taken away from it is so that
[2:09:09] a True Believer can come up to it in its
[2:09:12] purest form and accept it exactly that
[2:09:15] way and when you get to that point and
[2:09:18] you can accept it exactly that way then
[2:09:22] you're entitled to the
[2:09:25] Token full
[2:09:29] obedience to the whole word of God would
[2:09:32] entitle you to the Token full obedience
[2:09:36] not the part of it as far as your
[2:09:38] denomination goes but all of it full
[2:09:42] obedience to the word which is Christ
[2:09:46] brings you into Christ it entitles you
[2:09:51] amen amen it's just like a baby being
[2:09:54] born it's entitled to live its life
[2:10:00] that's an entitlement the the title deed
[2:10:03] to a property you get the title deed
[2:10:06] that means you own that property a
[2:10:09] little baby being born here in at least
[2:10:11] in this country he has he's he's
[2:10:14] entitled to to to keep his life to stay
[2:10:17] alive even the parents can't take his
[2:10:19] life mom and dad say we want to take his
[2:10:22] life you can't take that child's life
[2:10:24] it's
[2:10:25] protected that's part of the entitlement
[2:10:28] for it being born it's a little human
[2:10:31] being even mom and dad might change
[2:10:34] their mind and says no no but you know
[2:10:36] now that is born even he doesn't know
[2:10:39] how to feed himself or care for himself
[2:10:42] if you fail to keep it alive you're
[2:10:45] responsible these are the the rights to
[2:10:49] this little baby just being born in this
[2:10:52] country it's entitled to the right to
[2:10:55] keep its life even if he because doesn't
[2:10:58] know his name it can't talk it can't
[2:11:00] feed it can't walk doesn't know how to
[2:11:02] protect itself don't know where the
[2:11:03] environment needs to be in somebody is
[2:11:06] its caraker and needs to make sure that
[2:11:09] baby stays
[2:11:10] alive is that
[2:11:12] right what about in the Christian
[2:11:15] church
[2:11:17] huh who's the caretaker to make sure the
[2:11:21] babies get born in the
[2:11:23] church there's an
[2:11:25] entitlement that the word every
[2:11:29] generation has its
[2:11:31] own
[2:11:33] opportunity to say Amen to God's
[2:11:37] word and when I take this out and I take
[2:11:40] that part out and then it it takes it
[2:11:43] loses Integrity some Churches you know
[2:11:46] they'll it's cold former dry dead no
[2:11:50] spirit in it at all and then them little
[2:11:52] babies raised up in that church nobody
[2:11:55] sing nobody say praise the Lord oddly
[2:11:57] nobody's called to the ministry
[2:11:59] everybody sitting there on Le and then
[2:12:01] they go to Camp somewhere and Believers
[2:12:04] in the word they see somebody running
[2:12:06] and getting filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:12:07] and they like what kind of where is this
[2:12:10] from two different
[2:12:13] worlds because somebody didn't hold the
[2:12:16] Integrity if if if if you're sitting on
[2:12:19] a Pew and you're listening to a tape and
[2:12:22] there's a big difference between the
[2:12:23] tape Ministry and the church you're
[2:12:26] worshiping in somebody didn't keep the
[2:12:29] Integrity of the pull
[2:12:35] pit the word of God tells our sisters
[2:12:37] how to dress and then I look to the
[2:12:39] congregation if you ain't dressing that
[2:12:41] way somebody didn't keep the Integrity
[2:12:44] of what the word
[2:12:48] said it's easier not to say
[2:12:51] nothing it's easier on my personal
[2:12:54] feelings it's easier us on us humanly
[2:12:58] but standing before God if he says don't
[2:13:02] add or diminish
[2:13:09] art
[2:13:12] amen praise the
[2:13:14] lord it's a matter of our integrity to
[2:13:17] the text amen
[2:13:22] so we see it in the
[2:13:24] word and the word becomes our
[2:13:27] example and our absolute
[2:13:30] then when we have kept the whole word of
[2:13:34] God it entitles us to the
[2:13:40] token and what is the token it's the
[2:13:42] Life of Christ we present it in our
[2:13:45] prayers we claim our family with it it
[2:13:48] will take us in the Rapture the same
[2:13:50] power amen but you have to believe it
[2:13:54] all and even the part you don't
[2:13:57] understand you have to believe it and
[2:14:00] accept it all you know this message the
[2:14:02] token brother random talking about it
[2:14:05] the next
[2:14:07] service which he preached desperation so
[2:14:10] he preached this on the Sunday morning
[2:14:12] I'm closing now music musicians can come
[2:14:15] please he preached this on the Sunday
[2:14:18] morning the token and then Sunday night
[2:14:20] he preached
[2:14:21] the message desperations and he says
[2:14:23] this now you people in the tapes in
[2:14:26] there paragraph n this morning the
[2:14:30] message this morning was to me the
[2:14:35] Highlight message of my entire
[2:14:39] Ministry this morning see a highlight
[2:14:42] message of my entire Ministry someday
[2:14:45] I'll tell you how it come about and I
[2:14:48] know that everything has worked for mon
[2:14:51] months and months and months up to that
[2:14:54] one
[2:14:55] message moving up to come to that place
[2:14:59] that was the capping off time of it see
[2:15:03] now I'm sure or hope that you got what
[2:15:05] the token meant the token is a sign that
[2:15:08] the blood has been applied the price
[2:15:11] that's been asked required of God Jesus
[2:15:14] Paid the price by shedding his own blood
[2:15:16] he did that he the he did that then from
[2:15:21] his life came the Holy Spirit when the
[2:15:24] blood is applied to you the holy spirit
[2:15:26] is a token that your price is paid God
[2:15:30] has received you and that's the token
[2:15:33] remember that is the token now there's
[2:15:36] many
[2:15:37] people they don't know what the token is
[2:15:40] see and you have to make it like nobody
[2:15:43] knows it see so that all of them will
[2:15:47] get it now if you get that message the
[2:15:50] token
[2:15:51] right at the end there brother bam says
[2:15:54] many of you actually most of you have
[2:15:58] already received it he says that and you
[2:16:01] listen to that message the token is like
[2:16:03] man do I got anything am I even saved
[2:16:07] today but he has to preach it that way
[2:16:11] and the word of the Lord comes that way
[2:16:13] because you want to be very very sure on
[2:16:17] these things of eternal life you don't
[2:16:20] want I mean there's no wasted time at
[2:16:23] the
[2:16:24] altar and there's no wasted Prayer by
[2:16:26] saying Lord is it
[2:16:30] I am I the
[2:16:32] hypocrite am I wrong in my spirit what's
[2:16:36] wrong with
[2:16:37] that I I think that that's the attitude
[2:16:40] of many True Believers is they're always
[2:16:42] on the edge that they're not measuring
[2:16:46] up and they're constantly looking for
[2:16:49] God to show show them more grace and
[2:16:52] more of their
[2:16:53] word but we know that is it is by his
[2:16:56] grace that we can be or do anything that
[2:17:00] we're doing the very thought that I my
[2:17:03] heart wants to be like him that is the
[2:17:06] grace of God the very conviction that
[2:17:09] maybe I'm not measuring up that is a
[2:17:12] blessing because a lot of people just
[2:17:14] don't care they really don't and if you
[2:17:16] have that conviction that little Edge on
[2:17:19] you that you know maybe I'm not maybe
[2:17:21] I'm not just right maybe I'm not maybe I
[2:17:23] you know that that's a good thing
[2:17:25] because you just want to be for
[2:17:27] sure and there's nothing wrong with
[2:17:30] being
[2:17:32] sure but it's by his grace that we are
[2:17:35] saved it's his grace that put these
[2:17:37] Desires in our heart is by his grace you
[2:17:40] read the book of Galatians it take you
[2:17:42] about 30 minutes or so chapter 1 through
[2:17:45] six you could take your time and read it
[2:17:47] all those verses how Paul is taking you
[2:17:51] from The Works of the law to the grace
[2:17:54] of God what you going to circumcise
[2:17:57] yourself and now you think you're going
[2:17:59] to find you know you can't find peace
[2:18:01] with God but by the works of the law
[2:18:03] that's why his grace came to you it's by
[2:18:07] his grace that we are
[2:18:08] saved and it's the grace of God that
[2:18:11] will lead you to
[2:18:12] repentance it's the grace of God that'll
[2:18:15] put you on your knees and say Lord let
[2:18:17] this Vision open up to me even greater
[2:18:20] this third pool the ministry of the last
[2:18:23] day this great token Ministry this
[2:18:25] message Let It Come to Me Lord let it
[2:18:29] let me just empty out my he brother bam
[2:18:31] said it in the Sunday school this
[2:18:32] morning how many heard that that drive
[2:18:35] that you want to you know you should
[2:18:38] just Lord more of
[2:18:41] you amen there's nothing wrong with that
[2:18:45] from the preachers all the way to the
[2:18:47] newcomers the altar is open for for
[2:18:51] every
[2:18:52] believer prophets
[2:18:55] included and there's many people in
[2:18:56] their pride and arrogancy as a Christian
[2:18:59] they can't even make a move to an altar
[2:19:02] because their pride won't let them
[2:19:04] because you know I'm the Big B I'm the
[2:19:06] pastor I can't be at the altar that's
[2:19:08] the one that should be at the altar is
[2:19:11] your
[2:19:12] pastor and you right next to him and the
[2:19:16] altar is in your heart that's right in
[2:19:19] your pew Lord is it
[2:19:22] I Lord am I keeping the Integrity of
[2:19:26] your word or am I making it fit the way
[2:19:29] I want it to fit some of you sisters and
[2:19:32] some of you Brothers
[2:19:34] alike making the word fit for
[2:19:37] 2024 because you know just more
[2:19:39] comfortable that's too harsh this is a
[2:19:41] different way you know just keep the
[2:19:43] Integrity of the text what did he say
[2:19:45] what did the Bible say what did the word
[2:19:47] say and then say Lord help me amen and
[2:19:51] it's not looking around to others and
[2:19:53] how they apply it and how they handle
[2:19:55] the word it's none of that it's like M
[2:19:58] the prophet he said Micah 450 of them
[2:20:02] prophesied say what they said and you'll
[2:20:04] be in good graces of the king he says I
[2:20:07] will only say he's out there all by
[2:20:10] himself no Fellowship no friends
[2:20:13] nobody's even included him in all the
[2:20:16] the parties and the Banquets and the
[2:20:17] prayer breakfasts and whatever else is
[2:20:19] going on in the great denomination's by
[2:20:22] himself but somebody was with him and
[2:20:25] when it came to get a true honest report
[2:20:29] who did they go get somebody that's not
[2:20:32] going to manipulate the word or the
[2:20:35] quotes somebody that only say what God
[2:20:39] put in his mouth let that be me let that
[2:20:43] be you amen I will only say what God put
[2:20:47] in my
[2:20:48] mouth he said well will leave
[2:20:51] amen there's your funding we won't
[2:20:53] support you we won't like you no more
[2:20:55] like you wasn't supporting me
[2:20:59] anyways God is the one that's supporting
[2:21:01] his church amen amen God richly bless us
[2:21:07] all that I'll keep the Integrity I'll
[2:21:10] understand it's a oneman message and
