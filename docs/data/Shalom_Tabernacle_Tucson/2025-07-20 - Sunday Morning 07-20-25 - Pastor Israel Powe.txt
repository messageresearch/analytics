========================================

[Music] [Music] Good morning everyone. Everyone, can we all stand? Open up in a word of prayer. Bow our hearts and heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're grateful to be here today. Lord, we're we've come with anticipation for what we're going to hear. We're thankful that you, Father, left the throne of glory and you became flesh and dwelt among us, Father. Then you died for our sins, Lord Jesus. The blood shall never lose its power. Let it cover everyone, Lord, that would enter this house of worship today, Father, and know, Father, that you save to the uttermost. Lord, as we listen to the preaching of your word, we pray, Father, that you'd open our eyes and heart. Lord, you said you stand at the door and knock. If any man hear your voice and open the door, you come into him, sub with him and us with you, Lord. So, we're looking forward to that. Father, come into us today in a great way. And we'll give you all the praise and the glory for it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. We'll be starting at paragraph 74, end 128. This is from the book of Revelation chapter 3 verse 14-22. And can we sing only believe? Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. Only believe. [Music] Only believe. [Music] Only believe. [Music] All things are possible. Only believe. You may be seated, brother Brennan. Now we also find that has in his first coming wasn't at the day of the Lord. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Now back to Malachi. Let's straighten this out first. Coming at the day of the Lord. Now watch this compound coming is one coming and his second. Have you got your spiritual thinking ready? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sixth verse. Now he shall he'll stand Elijah before the great and dreadful day of the Lord. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we realize that that wasn't John. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz it wasn't a dreadful day of the Lord, was it? &gt;&gt; And he knew that he could burn the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it must have meant a pre or another future coming of John of of uh of Elijah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? cuz he said, "I'll send Elijah and I'm going to burn the whole earth and I'm going to clean it off and you'll walk out upon their ashes." That's the millennium. We know that. And the atomic bomb shall blow it from pieces. Then there'll be the earth will straighten up and there be a great day here on the earth. And the church will reign with Jesus on the earth for a thousand years. Is that right? But before that great and dreadful day of the Lord when it's going to be blowed up, I'll send to you Elijah the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So it did not mean John the Baptist in that state. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because a dreadful day of the Lord was the name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 2,000 years off. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Now watch the next verse. And if you'll be real spiritual now, now this is a love letter and you have to read between the lines and then it's made right. You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Remember how I said the scripture Jesus thanked God because it hid it from the wise and eyes and prudent reveal it to babes that I've often illustrated about my wife when she writes me a letter. I see what she's saying on the letter but I read between the lines and know what she means. See because I love her and I I know her nature and you have to know God's nature and love him. Then the scriptures stand right out to you. He reveals it. Now watch the next verse. And he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children. Now watch. And the hearts of the children to the fathers. &gt;&gt; See now when John came as Elijah, he turned the hearts of the Israelites uh the hearts of the children that was then accepting his message. Uh the hearts of the fathers to the children. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when he comes this time, he's going to turn the hearts of the church back to the Pentecostal fathers. &gt;&gt; See, it's a vice versa there. &gt;&gt; You get it? &gt;&gt; Now read it. &gt;&gt; Now listen close now. And he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, the old Orthodox priest. He's going to tell them that uh while God's able, these stones shall raise children under Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you think that you can see now he's going to take the hearts of the old callous Orthodox priest and turn their hearts to the faith that the children had here. &gt;&gt; See how all these has been baptized are waiting for the coming Messiah. And who's warned you, you generation of vipers to flee from the wrath to come? Oh my. See, he's turning the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers. Now when this great Elijah comes in the end of this age, he'll be taking the message of Pentecost to turn the children to the faith of the fathers. &gt;&gt; Because he'll be rebuking them because they didn't keep this same faith that was back there at the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, I believe we pretty well realize it's going to be Elijah, don't we? &gt;&gt; Now, we know it. It has. Now see, the dreadful day of the Lord ain't come. I often wondered, would this man just be a preacher then? Elijah had done all miracles, no preaching. But when his spirit was up on John, it done all preaching and no miracles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Jesus was going to follow him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He'd do the miracles. For the son of righteous shall rise, he said with healing in his wings. &gt;&gt; So John had no need of doing miracles. He just announced the coming of the Christ. And they now remember and this John or this Elijah that will come will be misunderstood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll be such a great powerful man before the Lord until people think he's actually the Messiah &gt;&gt; because his very best friend said to him, "You're the Messiah." He said, "I'm not worthy to lose his shoes, but he's coming after me." &gt;&gt; Because they were under expectation then to see a Messiah. They thought the Messiah was coming. When they seen this great phenomena rise up among them, they said, "He is the Messiah." &gt;&gt; John said, "I'm not him, but he's coming after me." &gt;&gt; Oh my. You get it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So, his close friends will think he is the Messiah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, notice another thing will take place. The nature of this, he'll come just before the Lord's day or the earth never burnt in the days of John. So it is in the future when he comes the first time he only preach the second time he uh he will both do preaching and signs. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Promised by Jesus Christ. All right. Now let us look at the nature what it will be the nature of this prophet that's coming out. We're satisfied that the angel of this last church age predicted from the Old Testament down. Now, the rest of them wasn't. Paul, Arinius, they wasn't predicted. But this last age at the end of the consummation, the end of the world, it'll be such a tremendous time that we got just ahead of us. So this angel of this age was predicted all the way back in the scripture, the old scriptures, the beginning up of this age. &gt;&gt; It's Elijah, great anointed one. Now watch. What kind of a nature will Elijah have? First, he'll be a mighty prophet, true to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Or Elijah was true. &gt;&gt; Sean was true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. doing signs and wonders will turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers. He will hate denominations &gt;&gt; like Elijah did. &gt;&gt; That's right. He will I think we just got the thing started for him now. About time he gets to come. He'll hate denominations. Elijah hated him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And so did John hate denominations. John said, "Don't come think now we got Abraham to our father, you Pharisees and Sadducees, you bunch of vipers, snakes in the grass, other words, for I tell you, God's the stones to write children of Abraham." &gt;&gt; Elijah said, "They've all gone astray. Every one of them, nobody left but me alone." Oh my. He will also hate fancy women. &gt;&gt; Elijah did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jezebel. Is that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; John did Herodia. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Both them prophets, &gt;&gt; the spirit of the same spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They hated the denominational world, the church world. They hated also fancy no good women. They something in their spirit cried out against the thing. &gt;&gt; Jezebel was after Elijah's head is going to cut off and she also had John's head cut off. Herodia did both of them. This prophet will be a lover of the wilderness &gt;&gt; like Elijah. He lived in the wilderness alone. John in the wilderness alone. &gt;&gt; Then we know it's going to be Elijah. All right. I am this prophet will be one that'll stay with the true word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. He'll stay with it. &gt;&gt; Oh, the word. what to to restore back a faith to the Ephesus church that's been lost all this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith in a church that had an open door set before it and rejected it. Not a learned person. Elijah was not a learned person. The Tishvite. John was not a learned person. Luke 1:67 the Bible said that he was at the child was in as soon as he was born he talked to the wilderness was in the wilderness till the day he was shown to Israel. &gt;&gt; That's right uh Luke 1 167 to the 80th verse if you want to mark it down. This prophet will also be a moody sort of a guy. Elijah after he had a great meeting, nobody could get along with him. Elijah had spells when he went out there and called fire down out of the heaven and burned up the altars of Baal and everything. He ran out in the wilderness. He said, "Lord, I'm no better than my fathers. Let me die." Is that right? &gt;&gt; And John, he sat on a juniper tree and after a great revival. Now he wanted to die. And John when they cast him in prison, this foul woman, he sat back there and began to get moody. I believe Timberman or one of them said his eagle eye got filmed over in the jail. He sent some of his disciples and while he declared there's the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world. John saw the pillar of fire hanging over him like a dove and come down settled up on him witness it all and said that's the lamb of God and said I have need to be baptized you and why you come to me Jesus said suffer to be so now but when he put him in prison he gets down in the dumps real quick see &gt;&gt; kind of hard pick him up and when they did he said go ask him if he really is the one or should we look for another to come &gt;&gt; just exactly like Elijah did see just the same he sort of a mood he our fellow. So we feel sorry for him because we know what that is. All right. Now at the um the church Jesus &gt;&gt; at his manifestation I better leave that alone. at his manifestation. The the church when he makes himself known, this mighty Elijah that God will send to us. When he makes himself known, like Elijah did, the church was ready to be delivered. &gt;&gt; We're delivered out of the hands of paganism. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just when he come up there and said, "We'll prove who's God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Elijah delivered the church. And John just as John did he said when he seen Jesus he said I must decrease and he must increase. John started preaching he said going just before the coming of the Lord &gt;&gt; right at the end the manifestation. &gt;&gt; All right. Now we find out that Elijah must mean there is age to this church to prove that it was Elijah. Elijah after he had give his prophecy, Elijah did not have to die. He was translated &gt;&gt; and was taken up into heaven a type of the church at the end of this Elijah that will come at the end of his time. The church will go in the rapture without going through the shadows of death. It'll be the rapture. I believe the great Elijah, the great one that's to come will be the anointed Elijah that's prophesied for the last days. Amen. &gt;&gt; I think he will be when he comes the angel or the messenger to the church in the last days. A rejected, degraded people as this church will get into and is already. I think Elijah is promised in the Bible. I think we can understand that that Elijah was the one that was promised in the Bible to come in this day. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's turn now to Lady Oia and we'll see what our Lord has to say to us tonight about Lady Oia. Lady Oia. All right. The salute to the church. Unto the angel of the Lord, the 14th verse of the third chapter of Revelation. Unto the angel of the Lord of Lady Oas. Write these things which saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness and the beginning of the creation of God. Oh my, we got all we had all night on that right there. &gt;&gt; How the Lord would reveal that to us. Watch the amen is the last. &gt;&gt; He's appeared all the way down through and different things, but here's the last church age. So it says I am. This is the finish. &gt;&gt; I am the last. Now to show that he was the first also as he was he's the beginning of the creation of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you catch it? &gt;&gt; See your way to &gt;&gt; how could God be created and he's a spirit. &gt;&gt; How could he be? He's He is eternal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He never was created. He never will be created because he was God at the beginning. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he that is the beginning of the creation of God was Jesus Christ when he was made manifest when God lived in him. &gt;&gt; He is God's creation. &gt;&gt; See the first and the last. The amen. &gt;&gt; The beginning of the creation of God. When God created himself a body and come down to live in that's the beginning of the creation of God. &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we find at the first he showed his deity right here. I am the Almighty. &gt;&gt; I am he that was, which is, and shall come. The Almighty to the church of Athens. They said it three times. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Comes right on over. The lady was standing and said, "I'm the Amen. &gt;&gt; I was the first back there. I'm the last over here. &gt;&gt; I am the beginning of the creation of God." &gt;&gt; Through the church ages, I would have you learn that I am God. Glory. &gt;&gt; God created a man form. I'm the beginning of the creation of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That would make a Presbyterian shout. Just think of it. Beginning of the creation of God. Now, oh, how I like that. The creation of God. When God was created, when God was made flesh in Jesus Christ and dwelt among us. down. Now, the next verse would be to the other churches. Come in. But he didn't commend this church. He had a complaint against it, not a command. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't command this for nothing. This lady was seeing her age with all the light that they had and went back on it. They didn't need any commanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They need a rebuke and they got it. &gt;&gt; He had a complaint for this church, not a command. Now I'll read the 15th and 16th verse here. Now I know thy works. Thou art neither cold or hot. I would that thou were cold or hot. In other words, don't don't just be lukewarm. So then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth. &gt;&gt; Talk. Isn't that a command? That's a rebuke. &gt;&gt; Amen. to this ungodly leosian age. The worst of the whole bunch. All the rest of them under the torments and everything they had. They had nothing. They was povertystricken, wondered about and sheep skins and goat skins and destituted and sawed and burnt to death and fed the lions and everything else and still helped the faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this bunch is rich and have need of nothing and everything else and a prostitute. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we got a great big lesson I hope the Lord helps us in. He He said, "Because you're neither hot or cold, lukewarm like milk." See, a good cold milk's good, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Hot milk's good for you, but lukewarm milk will make you vomit. &gt;&gt; Remember one night I got sick down on the river about 25 years ago. I was in a little shiny boat living down there. I got sick and I come up, my brother-in-law, take me over to Dr. Eiser. So what's the matter? I said I'm so sick at my stomach. So drink a glass of warm milk. Oh brother, lukewarm milk. It made me sick. So I just cleaned it all out. Was on the inside. Now God said, "I'd rather you be hot, real red hot or freezing. Be one or the other. Don't get lukewarm cuz you make me sick." That's what this church age does for God makes you sick. Either be don't e don't be red either be red hot or don't be lukewarm. warm or hot, cause you make me vomit. The chilliness of the England church in the days of John Wesley drove him to have meetings elsewhere because it was cold. Chilly. &gt;&gt; The chilliness of the Methodist church caused William Booth to become a red-hot salvationist. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, God said, "If you won't come and repent, I'll remove the candlestick. &gt;&gt; Now, take it out. Give it to somebody else." So when the Methodist church went received John Wesley sanctification, William Booth come right up with the Salvation Army and tuck it right on. That's right. Why? They organized it. It's exactly made an organization out of it. God said, "I hate the thing." So the William Booth come right along. They picked it up and the Salvation Army. Then what do you do? The same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Turn around and organized it again. After him come the Calites and they existed a while and John Smith for the Baptist. And after that come the Nazarines. and the Nazarines come Pentecost. Nazarines what they do big series up the same way denominated. What come in that time? Two little branches, church of God and so forth grow there. What they do organize? Just let them go. Along come the Pentecostals with the latter rain blessing. What they do? Organize. We just let them go. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now we're going to get down here at the end. You get something real strong in a few minutes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. He wants you red hot or or freezing, one or the other. Don't be lukewarm. Just don't pretend something that you haven't got. Either be on fire for God or go on back into the in an organization. Don't uh don't be lukewarm. It's the same thing now. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat.

When the redeemed are gathering in wash like snow and free from all sin. How I will shout. How I will sing. When the redeemed are gathering in and there will be a great procession over on the streets of gold with a redeemed a gathering in. Oh, what musical, what singing or the city will be ruled when the redeemed are gathering in. When the redeemed are gathering in, [Applause] washed like stone and free from all sin.

They shall mount up with wings as a shall run and not be weery. They shall walk and not faint. Teach me Lord. Teach me Lord to way. Oh, teach me Lord to wait. Down on my knees till in your own good time. You answer my please. Teach me not to rely [Music] on what others do, Lord, but to wait in prayer for an answer from you. And they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as an eagle. They shall run and not be weary. The one that cannot wait. Teach me. Teach me to wait. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe we could just all stand and we'll sing a worship song as the brother Joe Galante and somebody else can come up to take up the offering. See a lot of people that I know are traveling today. The Robsons are I think they're maybe in Washington state still on their way up to Canada. So remember their clan. It's big clan.

He was born with extreme heart defects and now he has to have brain surgery this Thursday. Very serious condition. Amen. Anyone have an unspoken request? Amen. Let's let's go to our Lord. Heavenly Father, Lord, this today will come unto you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. A name that it's above every name, Father. Lord, that every knee and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. Father, we want to give you the honor that you do, Father. And Lord, as these requests have been spoken, Father, we just pray, Father, that you'd intervene. Drive the enemy of our souls, the devil, Lord, away from every one of these people, Father, we claim their healing. We're asking, Father, that those stripes you bore, Lord, be their portion today. Your blood, Father, can never lose its power. Father, just save, heal, and deliver in every situation. Guide, and keep every one of them. Father, you said that if any man be a worshshiper and do your will, Lord, that you would hear. Father, we want to be a worshipper of you today, Father, because Lord, if we can create that atmosphere, Lord, that pleases you, nothing will be impossible, Father. So, we're just asking, Father, in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that you'd come on the scene, Lord, make everyone whole. Deliver every situation, Father, and we'll give you all the praise and the glory for it. Amen. And amen. [Music] Let's go to the key of G. [Music] I came to worship you. [Music] I came to sing your praise. [Music] I came to love you Lord. Your holy name to reign. Hallelu. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Oh, how I worship you. You are my Lord. Let's tell him that again. Lord, I came to worship you. I came to sing your praise. I came to love you Lord. Your holy name to reign. Hallelujah. [Music] Oh, [Music] oh, how I worship you. You are my sister Melissa has a song for us this morning. Maybe we could just stand as she comes and we'll sing one more worship song. I'm longing longing for Jesus. I'm longing longing for Jesus. I have a longing in my heart for you. Just to be near him and to feel his presence. I have a longing in my heart for him. How many can say you've got a desire this morning? Yes, I am longing longing for Jesus. [Music] I have a longing in my heart for him. Just to be near him, just to feel his presence. I have a longing in my heart for [Music] him. [Music] There are times in this life when fear is so heavy and burdens weigh on your mind. You are weak in the near and no strength can you find. Just hold on. Helps right on time. My Jesus is always on time. And though you may see a valley, he sees the mountain you'll be standing [Music] down. I'm so glad he sees what we don't. I've seen his children walk through the darkest of midnight. I've witnessed faith put to the test. I have watched as the storms loo in with the thunder. But in each trial, he knows what's best. &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad he knows what's best. And though you may see a valley, he sees the mountain you'll be standing [Music] down. I'm so glad he sees what we don't. &gt;&gt; Now, we're expected to be tested. &gt;&gt; That's a good lesson for my my brother back there also. He that cometh to God must first be tested. &gt;&gt; Tested what? With the word. &gt;&gt; That's God's test. Do you believe it? Amen. &gt;&gt; He that cometh to God must be tested. That only shows a true job. &gt;&gt; Be tested. And when the test comes on, you can't overcome unless there's a test given to you. &gt;&gt; And when test is given is to see whether you can overcome or not. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said to him that overcometh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The test, the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you. And I believe it's written in the scripture. Peter said uh that our trials are worth more to us than precious gold. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's a testing time. It's one good evidence to us that God is with us when we're tested. &gt;&gt; For all children of God are tested and tried. He knows the end from the beginning. And he looks ahead pass the hurt and the pain to a place where the peace passes all understanding. He sees the sun through the rain. [Music] And though you may see your valley, [Music] he sees the mountain. You'll be standing on me when all you can see are the tears falling down. I'm so glad he sees what we [Music] don't. [Music] [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is so good. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful reminder of just who how big of a God that we serve. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He sees what we don't. He's got the answer for all of our problems. He is the answer for all of our problems. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I just want to accept that this morning. Lord, increase my faith. Take away any unbelief that we have. Amen. Fill my cup, Lord. Why don't we just ask him to do that this morning? I don't think you'll refuse any good thing from those that love him. So, Lord, just take out anything that would hinder you from filling me this morning. And just pour your spirit out on me. Just fill my cup. to you, Lord. I lift it up to you, Lord. I lift it up to you, Lord. Why don't we stand as we ask it? Come and this thirsty Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Feed me this morning, Lord, till I want no more. Oh bread of heaven, won't you feed me till I walk? No more. Here's my cup. Oh, just fill it up, Lord. Make me whole. Ask him one more time. Oh, just fill my cup, Lord. I lift it up to you, Lord. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, come and quench this thirst in my soul. Oh bread of heaven. Oh, just feed me till I want no more. Oh, here's my cup. Just fill it up and make me whole. [Music] Just ask him in your own way as the musicians continue to play. Hallelujah. Grant it, Lord. Hallelujah. He promises those that hunger and thirst after righteousness will be filled. So we ask him to that, Lord. That's me. I'm hungering and thirsting after righteousness. And so Lord, you promise you'll fill me. Come and quench this thirsty this morning. Oh bread of heaven, feed me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Wonderful Jesus. Thank you Lord. Just thank you for his faithfulness. Oh, just fill my cup. [Music] You can be seated if you'd like as they continue to play. [Music] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Amen. Bless you. Let's bow our heads for a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we come before you this morning, Lord, asking you to fill our cups. Lord, fill our souls, our minds, our thinking with more of your word, more of your truth. Lord, more of your power, more of your anointing. Lord, we lead it in our lives, Lord. Come down in a very special way today, Lord. Speak to our hearts, Lord. We've laid aside the things of the world, Lord, and we come to hear your word, Lord, to feed on your word, oh God. feed our souls we pray. Lord, may you meet every need, Lord, that's gathered here. And for the saints, Lord, that is tuning in on the stream. May each one receive their portion. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. So, God bless each of you. So happy to be in the house of the Lord with you today. Amen. Always count it a privilege to be gathered in his name. Amen. So, we'd like to welcome our visitors. This gentleman here we met in the back there when brother Ben had met him, invited him, and so happy to have him. Happy to have each of you. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let's go right into the word of the Lord. We'll take our Bibles and turn in the New Testament, Mark chapter 8. We were went to uh the meetings there with brother Mark Castillo on uh Friday and Saturday. We had a good time there in the Lord. Certainly thank the Lord for the fellowship we have with them. Lord always blesses us as we come into his presence. Amen. All right. Scripture is in St. Mark chapter 1. We'll take that one. Yes. Excuse me just a moment here. All right. My my. All right, let's get it here. Verse number 21. And they went into Capernaum, and straightway on the Sabbath day he entered in the synagogue and taught. And they were astonished at his doctrine, for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes. And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out, saying, Let us alone. What have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? are thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him. And they were all amazed in so much that they questioned among themselves, saying, "What thing is this? What new doctrine is this? For with authority commanded he even the unclean spirits and they do obey him. Amen. I'll take one more scripture in Matthew chapter 8 verse number five. And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion beseeching him, saying, Lord, my servant lith home sick of the pausy, grievously tormented. And Jesus, saith unto him, I will come and heal him. Then the centurion answered and said, Lord, I'm not worthy that thou should come under my roof, but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this man, "Go," and he goeth. And to another, "Come," and he cometh. And to my servant, "Do this," and he doeth it. And Jesus heard it, he marveled. And he said to them that followed, "Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. And I say unto you that many shall come from the east and west and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness. There shall be weeping and nashing of teeth. Amen. So um two portions in the scripture there. We'll read one more one more portion in Matthew chapter 8. All right. or we just read that in Matthew 8. Sorry, we'll take um Mark chapter 5 is what we want. And this is another ruler, a man of authority coming to Jesus. Mark chapter number eight. I'm sorry. Mark chapter 5. You're all gonna have to pray for me today. All right. Mark chapter 5. We'll get it here in just a minute. All right. That's right. Right. And the scripture that I want here is in verse number 21 Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side. Much people gathered unto him, and he was nigh unto the sea. And behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jarias by name. When he saw him, he fell at his feet. He besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lith at the point of death. I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she shall live. And Jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him. And a certain woman which had an issue of blood. Let's skip down. She comes through there and she touches the hymn of Jesus. And then verse 35. And while he spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house a certain which said, "Thy daughter is dead. Why troublest thou the master any further?" And as soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, "Be not afraid, only believe." And so we know that the Lord went to this man's house and calls her forth from the dead and he'll do that again even today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us pray and ask the Lord to bless a word. Father, we ask your blessing upon this meeting this morning. We place it into your capable hands. We're not capable, but it's you. You're the one here that can speak to our hearts. And we need that, Lord, today. Every one of us need you to speak to our hearts so that we can grow in your grace and mercy so that we can do the things that would be pleasing unto you. May you grant it, Lord. Move aside every hindrance and every weight. Bring the clarity of our minds under the authority of the Holy Spirit. Right now is our prayer in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. So, we've been speaking about this adoption and how the sons and daughters of God in Romans and Ephesians are predestinated to the adoption of children. We're not just predestinated to be saved. We thank God for salvation. But then there's a portion that we move forward in the authority and that is a position in Christ where that son leaves from just being a son to where in the Roman way they had this ceremony of adoption and we've been through that a number of times and with this is several services on it. It just keeps going different ways. How this a son different nothing than a servant and a son. There's no difference. But that son is put under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father. And then at that appointed time, we don't know how long this tutoring time takes. Um how long that great testing takes for Abraham was quite some time. Joseph had a tremendous test. Elijah and Elisha. Elisha coming from rowing, hoing uh the field out there to coming into becoming a prophet. There was a training time for him that he finally had to take Elijah's mantle. He couldn't just follow him and be a servant to him. But Elijah came to him and says, "I'm going to believe in you." And so that puts another stress. It's easy to be in the backseat of the car and tell everyone how they need to drive &gt;&gt; and we're going miles and miles and miles and you wake up and start pointing fingers on where you should have how we should have did it. But when you get behind the wheel yourself &gt;&gt; and you now have are responsible to getting to the place on time and safely um it's a different responsibility. And so I believe that the Lord trains us and teaches us those um things through the things that we suffer, tests and trials. Every child here can probably point out what a perfect parent should be. But when they get married and have their own children, don't tell me, just show me. Show me what a perfect parent is because you'll get the fine opportunity to do just that. &gt;&gt; And Elijah and Elisha went through this time of training. Joseph had these dreams and this call of God on his life. And he went through this tremendous test, a test he didn't know he would have to go through. Moses and all the great leaders and the true believers have to go through these times of testing before you're placed with the authority of a son, an adopted son or let's say a son that has reached his his position in Christ. That placing, you know, every time a young man comes to the altar to be saved, we don't know if that could be the next pastor in this city. We don't know if that could be the next missionary. We don't know what God is going to do with that newcomer. &gt;&gt; But time will tell us through the teachings, through the test and trials and life. Everybody that come don't stay. Everybody that gets baptized, they don't remain in it. We've seen them come and go. But God by his grace has us here today. &gt;&gt; And all we can say is thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there's people better than you and I &gt;&gt; that fell off a long time ago. &gt;&gt; But we're still here &gt;&gt; with God's grace and a desire to serve him. &gt;&gt; Amen. We ought to be grateful for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. We should be thankful for that today &gt;&gt; that we're still here. But here is uh two portions in the scriptures. We read three. But these two places in the scriptures are highlighting two men of authority coming to the man who really has the authority, the Lord Jesus. One was a Roman centurion. He has no background for faith as it pertains to um being a Hebrew. Doesn't say that he was a procelite. He was just a ruler. Ruler of a hundred men. He's a gentile, but somehow the Romans being rulers over the Hebrews or the Israelites, he would have to know some of the customs and the hearsay. And you have to hear of the fanaticism amongst this group of Jews, these folks that have this strange way that they worship and so forth. Um but something how faith comes to him somehow some way with all of his Roman uh intellectuals and his access to health care maybe of the day. Maybe his ability to take that servant in to get healed or sick through their physicians and so forth. For some reason this man with a hundred men under him wants to bring his servant to Jesus. He finds the right man, doesn't he? &gt;&gt; He brings him, he brings his request to the right person. And that person was the Lord Jesus. And he calls out to him and said, "I have a servant that is violently sick. Actually, he's being tormented with a policy. And this policy is a paralysis. It's a it's the losing of of the the the nerves, the sensation in the nerves. There's a couple of different um uh uh definitions of what that is, but the Bible tells us it he was in torment. So, it wasn't just a little sickness, but he his body is being torn down and deteriorating. And this man, a Roman centurion, actually loved this man that was his servant. So he comes to Jesus, brings his request to the right person and he tells him, "Lord, I have a servant and I want you to heal him." And Jesus says, "Okay, we'll come to your house and we'll go heal him. Where's he at?" Oh, no, no, no, Lord. We don't need you to be troubled that way. I am an important guy, too. And I have people that are under me and I have many tasks that have to get done. So what I do is I tell this one to go and go and come and come and they obey me. They just do it. And Lord, if you got the power to heal right here or whether you go lay hands on them, if you just say it in the word, &gt;&gt; just speak the word &gt;&gt; and my servant will live. You know what's nice about this is that there is no Mosaic Mosaic teachings that taught him this. &gt;&gt; What he learned this from was just the ability to understand authority. &gt;&gt; The ability to understand authority. Authority is something that is given to you. They they um I read this study here some time ago that um they took these people and they had them to look into a crowd of other people. I think it was a public place like a like an airport. He said looking in the airport you can see um the people that had authority and those that did not just by watching them. And it's not that they were wearing uniforms. This is not this, but it's just the way that a person carries themsself when they know who they are. &gt;&gt; If they're a position of authority, if they know what they know and they're confident in who they are, they carry themselves a certain way. Remember the story brother Bam gives of the slaves that the buyers were coming to buy a slave and he looked over the field and he was trying to assess which slave to buy and he finds a certain slave that he wanted. He said, "I want to buy that one." He says, "Well, that one's not for sale." Well, why not? Well, that's the one I want. I've noticed him. He has his head up. Do you feed him any different? No. He eats in the same place like all the other slaves. Do you treat him any different? Nope. Is he a boss like the Nope. He has the same circumstances like all the other slaves. So why is he conducting himself this way? Now this is um this is a slave buyer looking at a slave from a distance. This isn't the slave buyer talking to the slave himself. This is him looking at him from a distance and saying that one is valuable. What if the Lord can look at our praise service this morning &gt;&gt; from a distance &gt;&gt; and don't tell me how much you believe? Don't tell me how much faith you got. Just let me look at the video &gt;&gt; and see who really was worshiping the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; You know, worship and praise has an uh emotion to it. &gt;&gt; There's something to it. I can tell those that were in the game just by watching the fans how they act. I know which team you're on. When somebody scores, doesn't matter what you're wearing, doesn't matter what you look like. If you're in the game and somebody scores, we're going to see that. We'll notice that. And so this this authority is something down on the inside. And I believe that the church of the living God has to come to the knowledge that they are sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; That they're just not a, you know, a sideway or part-time believer, &gt;&gt; but that we actually belong to somebody. &gt;&gt; That actually somebody loves us. &gt;&gt; And everything we need is not in some praise from some man or some outside, you know, reinforcement. Everything I need is right here &gt;&gt; in the presence of the most high God. &gt;&gt; That's where I'm safe. That's where I know I'm complete in him. &gt;&gt; So all people that run, they leave. They they they they don't want to have anything to do with you. They'll criticize you and it hurts for a little bit. But when you know that you belong to the Lord, &gt;&gt; guess what you're going to do? &gt;&gt; You're gonna keep on going. &gt;&gt; You're gonna keep on moving forward. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And this this authority is quite clear with this Roman centurion. Now, Jarius, he was a ruler of the synagogue. And so, he was a believer as well, but more than a Roman centurion, he was a Hebrew. He was one of the Jews. He actually had a position in the temple, in the synagogue. He um uh they they were responsible over overseeing many of the tasks that would take place, the worship and setting things up. They were not priest. They were not um uh uh in that order of a Levite or a priest, but they were rulers and they had a name I can't pronounce right now that they would uh they had the oversight. And so they they managed the upkeep of the synagogue. they they help coordinate the different things that take place and make sure that uh the prayers and the reading of the of the word was in order and those things and how that position was developed I don't quite know but there's not just one uh ruler of the synagogue in the New Testament there's another one Chrisus in the book of Acts you can read about him but this one here his name is Jarius and he has a daughter you know What's interesting about Jarius, he was a believer. He was a ruler in the synagogue. He comes to Jesus and Jesus is in a great campaign. He has a lot of people following him at the time and his ministry had grown so much. He preached over on one side of the uh of the sea and he comes back on the other side and this large group of people follow him. And this ruler in the synagogue finds Jesus and he falls down at his feet to worship him. And I want to say that he came with the right approach. He was a he was an important man. Yes. But I I I it'd be hard to find many so-called Christians that would do what this man did to actually fall down on before the Lord Jesus with his requests. Many Christians, we hate to say it, but there's so much pride involved in us because we we know so much and we're not like that one and we're not like them out there and we so ain't like them over there and it just breathes this little pride or like a arrogancy. But a true believer knows where he comes from &gt;&gt; and he knows that his praise and his worship belongs to him. And we didn't actually come here to be seen by one another. &gt;&gt; We came here to worship the most high God. &gt;&gt; I wonder how many times I've come to church and I didn't even worship him. I wonder how many times people have come to the house of the Lord. Open up their Bible. Went through the motions but never really worshiped him. have spiritual requests and needs in their life but will never take the time to fall down and worship him. God have mercy upon that spirit. We all get it, don't we? We all get a little coldness and we feel like I'm not going to bother the service or I'm not going to bother the master or you know it's just about time to close. I'll just keep this little thing here. But this man's daughter was violently ill. She was dying. &gt;&gt; So that moved him out of his position, didn't it? &gt;&gt; And he comes into the presence of the Lord and he fell at his feet. And the Bible says he besought him greatly. &gt;&gt; It wasn't just like, "Lord, yeah, I got a prayer request. Let me just slip." No, he besought him greatly. &gt;&gt; He had a serious need. &gt;&gt; And let me say this. If there's ever a time you're in a church service and there's one soul or two that's beseeching him greatly, please don't get in their way. &gt;&gt; Please don't make them feel out of order. &gt;&gt; Please encourage them to beseech the one who can change their circumstance. &gt;&gt; Make it easier for them. Actually pray for them. stop staring and start praying &gt;&gt; for them. &gt;&gt; And there are many Christians, they're very curious because Christians are very interesting people. Particularly church folks. We like to look around at one another. Who's mad at who? Who's fighting today? How did y'all get here? Look at her. She's a little mad. He's a little upset. He need to go to the altar. She need to, you know, church people. Huh? Come on. Somebody help me preach in here. But we didn't come here to look at nobody else. We came here to meet Jesus &gt;&gt; because he's got the power &gt;&gt; to move on our behalf. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen, somebody. &gt;&gt; You know the Satan likes to disturb that. He likes to change that and and and and move our motives and our objectives because that's his job. He's a great adversary and he wants you to come here and leave from here and not achieve. He wants you to achieve everything but what you were supposed to achieve according to the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so here he comes to Jesus. He lays down himself. He beseechs the Lord greatly. He has a request and that was, "Lord, would you come and lay your hands on my daughter? She's violently sick. She's dying. Would you come?" And Jesus, after being besought greatly, he he answers this request. He makes the test. He makes the the trip to this man's house. And while on the way to the house, this woman with an issue of blood comes and touches him. And we know the story with her. We won't take time to go there, but she he uh he's on the way to fulfill this request. And then out of nowhere, another servant comes from Jarius's home. And says, "Don't trouble the master any further. Your daughter is dead." There was a little hope when she was still alive, but she's dead now. Don't trouble him. any further. So, we know that he was troubled. We know that Jesus dealing with all of these people, this great ministry he had. And here's one man pulling him aside to come to his house. I mean, to break up the meeting and come to his house. And so, he's a Jew. And this is the way he is taught. The prophet of God tells us that the Jew has been taught that hands must be laid upon them. And this is a teaching. So he's definitely working in him in the way he was taught is for this uh Jesus to come and lay hands upon him. And we see this and Jesus is going to fulfill this request for this man. And while going there the real bad news come the bad bad news they go from bad to worse. She's dead. Your daughter is dead. Jesus stops immediately when he hears this. The Bible says when he hears this, he looks at the man says, "Don't be afraid. Be of good cheer. Only believe." And this is what we need to hear today. Sometimes we bring our requests before the Lord. It looks like the situation gets worse. How many's ever had that happen to you? Looks like nobody heard you or it got worse or it's just doing on the same. But I'm going to say to you, be of good cheer. Only believe. Only believe. You know, God doesn't have a hearing problem. He heard you the first time you prayed, but he does hear also your complaining and your dismay, too. And every time things get worse, we start to complain a little bit. Even within our heart, we know our faith kind of drops down when those bad news come our way. But we have to have faith, saints. &gt;&gt; We got to be encouraged. &gt;&gt; We have to be of good cheer. &gt;&gt; Not of a sad cheer, but of good cheer. &gt;&gt; Only believe. And so here our Lord is now coming to the house. The girl is dead. The people are crying. Jesus has to put all the people out of the house and he brings Peter, James and John and calls for the life of this child and God answers that request. Now why is the Gentile moving in this realm of authority and the Jew is moving in the realm of laying on of hands? Well, they're moving that way because that's the way they were taught. And sad, but it's true. Many Christians today, Hebrew or not Hebrews, but gentile Christians still live under the teaching of lay hands on me. &gt;&gt; And it is biblical and as the scriptures are for. They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. He that is sick or he that committed any sins call the elders of the church. Let him anoint him with oil and the prayer of faith shall save the sick. It's absolutely part of the scriptures is absolutely a way to get to it to get the job done. Let me ask you a question. If laying hands on the sick and you still have to call on God or believe God to do the work, laying hands on the sick is still no guarantee that it's going to happen. We're just going through the motions of laying hands on the sick. That's what the word says. It still needs a supernatural to make it happen. &gt;&gt; So, what's easier for the word to just be spoken? &gt;&gt; Receive your healing. you're already healed. &gt;&gt; Or going through the task of having hands laid upon you. They're both work. They're both good. One's taking a flight to Phoenix. The other one is maybe riding a bicycle, but you're still getting to Phoenix. They both work, but which one is better? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; What is a better way of travel? Come on, somebody. A better way of travel is Actually, if I have a choice, first class. &gt;&gt; If it's free, is it free? First class. Absolutely. And and um and and that is a better way of travel. And I don't criticize those that would take the bus or ride their bike or drive their own car or take the shuttle, but if I have a ticket to fly wherever I'm going, then that's the way I want to go. And this is all to do with the teaching. How were you taught? &gt;&gt; The Roman came without any religious, you know, he didn't have any religious stuff. All he knew was authority. &gt;&gt; And it's interesting that God wants to get the church to move in this line of the authority of the spoken word over just lay your hands upon me. What an example did God give us as the first gentile convert. Who was he? He was a centurion, an Italian. Acts chapter 10. What was he was a roy? He was a a Roman. He was a centurion. He was a gentile. He was an Italian. And God uses him as the first convert for the Gentiles. Here he is a man of authority that God uses. Pours out the Holy Ghost upon him. I think it's saying something. I believe it's saying something. Now, let's go into the message just a little bit. All right. Hear what the prophet of God says in the message who Let's take here. Just read a few places here. The Lord will help us. Amen. Now the scripture that we read there in Mark chapter 1, he taught as one that had authority. Hear what the prophet says here in the message to see Jesus. What a difference Jesus was in the church of that day. That what he is in the church of today. He taught them as one with authority. That he knew what he was talking about. We speak today as if, well, I just don't know whether it's so or not. I read here that they uh that they healed the sick, but I just don't know whether it's right or not. Not Jesus. He knew where he was standing. He knew what is his authority. He knew that God would keep his word. He said to them, "Destroy this tabernacle. Destroy this temple. I'll raise it up in three days." He was speaking of his body knowing that one scripture in the Bible, one scripture had reference to that. And David and the prophet said, "So, so this authority comes back to you knowing what you're talking about." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You got to know what you're talking about. You know, somebody came to my house and begin to tell me who my brothers and sisters were. And they started adding people and adding names in there that didn't belong. I'm going to stop him real quick. No, you got the wrong family. That's not my family. Now, I know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; And therefore, I can stand firm when I'm saying it. I don't have to go back in the corner like I kind of, you know, I think you're kind of No, I'm going to stand firm. I know who my brothers are. I fought with all of them. I know who my sisters are. I got into it with all of them. Those are my siblings. I'm a man speaking with authority because what? I know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; And this is Jesus. He taught the scriptures as one that knew what he was talking about. And when Jesus was preaching, they heard his preaching. This man preaches like he knows what he's talking about. &gt;&gt; How you're supposed to witness. How should you be singing? How should you be praising the How should you be doing anything associated with the Lord? You ought to sing that song like you know what you're singing about. Preach the gospel like you know what you're preaching about. Claim your healing. Like you know &gt;&gt; what you're talking about. &gt;&gt; Claim the deliverance. Claim your family. Claim your healing. Claim everything &gt;&gt; based on the authority of the word of God. &gt;&gt; He spoke like a man that had authority. He knew what he was talking about. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, have you seen people tell things that wasn't true? You know, he's lying. You know that's impossible. They're selling some product or something they're saying is miracle, whatever the new miracle is. But the man who's telling it is quite convincing because he's telling it because he really believes it. And even though it's not true, it's like, man, this I like listening to this guy because I'm not gonna buy his shoes. I'm not gonna buy his product, but he sure knows his stuff. And this is, you know, he he doesn't have the authority. His authority is that he can get you to sign a contract. His authority, his motivation is to get you to buy or sell or whatever it is. What about a son or daughter of God? What about a Bible preacher? What about a mom or a dad that believes in the word of God? Can they not take the authority of the word and take their confession and make it line up with God's word? &gt;&gt; Absolutely you can. Don't let the devil fool you. Don't let the devil make you feel like you don't know that this is right or this is true. like you hiding something or like you're not telling the truth. This is the only thing that is true, saints. Amen. And so Jesus taught like one had authority here. What the prophet of God says in the greater than Solomon is here. Now look, everyone has been taught this tradition. And I say to my brothers and which is all right. It's scripture, but we want to lay hands on one another. Did you notice that? But that wasn't given to the Gentiles. That wasn't the way the Gentiles accepted it. So if you want to know the way the Gentiles received the Holy Ghost, remember he went to the Jews, he went to the Samaritans, then he went to the Gentiles. In Acts chapter 2, the Holy Ghost fell out upon the whole group. Then it goes over to the Samaritans. And then in Acts chapter 10, he opens up Peter uses the key to the kingdom to open it up to the Gentiles. And how did it happen with the Gentiles? It's not a nothing, it's a something. While he was ministering to them other groups, Peter went and laid their hands on them that they would receive the Holy Ghost. But not with not with Cornelius. Not in not in Cornelius's house. in Cornelius's house. He they hadn't even been baptized yet. &gt;&gt; And the preaching of the word has started preaching. And as he's preaching the word, they received it by the word. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost fell while he was preaching. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost came down while the preaching was going on. &gt;&gt; That's the Gentile program. We receive it by the spoken word. &gt;&gt; I didn't have to be in Jeffersonville. &gt;&gt; I didn't have to be at the literal tape service. &gt;&gt; But I heard something. And when I heard it, I received it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's our claim. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Now, many times, Brother Brandham, he would go in prayer. I got one or two examples. He'd go in prayer because of his great gift in his life. How God used him and the angel of the Lord came to him in his great commission. He tells that story in the life story in many other places in the prayer line. Went around the country, went around the world and many times in his prayer he would include by what authority he was doing what he was doing. sometimes when he married a couple at the end he says a divine gift that was ministered to me by an angel and and in one place I think it's in the message um I jotted it down in the message uh the power of decision paragraph 83 he's laying hands on this sister and he says by the power of the authority of the word of God and the Holy Spirit and the angel that was ministered unto me, that had ministered unto me. So, he uses this authority now to move this other power off of his sister. He's using his ranks now to call the bluff of the enemy. I am a man of authority. I say to one, go and it goes. I say to one, come and it comes. This authority has been given to the church. Whatever you say in my name, you can have it. We just don't pray it. We speak the word and the spoken word brings our deliverance. Is that right? Brother says this in faith is the substance 1951 paragraph 50 59 says, "Now I've tried to be honest. I tried to be as true as I know how. Now please my Christian friends accept my word now. Now I speak now upon the authority of the angel of God who is coming nearer and nearer me all the time here at the platform and on the word of God which is Jesus Christ inspired to write men to write. Says it again in God testifying of his gifts. 1952 almighty God bless this woman who I bless in thy name. He said, "Whatsoever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. Whatsoever you loose on earth, I will loose in heaven." The keys was given unto the church. Now upon the authority of the Bible and upon the authority of my risen Lord who is present now with his angel manifesting these things, I now say, "Cursed be this tumor in the woman in the name of Jesus Christ. May it go from her. How many's ever heard any messages from Oral Roberts? He's on the YouTube. He's got a had a tremendous healing ministry and TL Osborne and many of them. And they they they did great things that God used him to heal and save. Aa Allen, another one great ministry, great. By what authority were they doing that on? They was doing it by the authority of the word of God. God is a healer. He's not confined to your organization or the denomination. He's not confined only to your church or to your little group. He is confined in his word. And anybody that takes him at his word now has the authority that comes with that word. &gt;&gt; So you don't have to ask permission to receive the word of the Lord. You just receive it freely and you go forward with it. Amen. So the word of God gives us the authority. Is that right? That's where we get our authority. Who? They asked Jesus several places. By what authority are you doing this? Now, as I said the other day, Satan wants you to try to grab a position. He wants you to rise yourself above somebody else. And he wants you to have a position in his kingdom. But God has a position for every believer too that we should be coming to. And Satan and his power and the way he wants to exercise the authority and power is one man ruling over another man. But that's not so in the kingdom of God. In the kingdom of God, we're trying to find the Holy Ghost power in our lives. He has anointed us and endowed us with his spirit. And with that spirit being the church of the living God, he gives us power over all unclean spirits. We have that power now. This church has it now. The true church has it. Is that right? The Bible church has it. Is that right? &gt;&gt; They have the authority over every unclean spirit. Does that include cancer? Yes. that include deafness and and and paralysis includes all of it. Church has a power, but we're afraid to use it. Many times we speak as if we don't know what we're talking about or maybe it didn't happen before. Maybe we're just a little we need to be taught what authority is. It's not by might. It's not your power, but it's the authority that God has given us. Now, brother Bam takes this and he goes further and he tells us that it is the way that they were taught. He said that everyone has been taught to lay hands, have someone to lay hands upon you. But now let's take this message. The Roman nobleman 1955 messenger says this here paragraph number four. Did you notice when he was going to pray for Jarius's daughter to be raised? Jarius was a Jew and he would been trained to lay hands on people. Jarius said, "Come lay your hands on my daughter and she'll live." He had been taught that laying on hands. But to the Gentile, he had been taught power and authority. It's according to what you believe. Both of their faith was in Christ. One said, "Speak the word and it be done." The other one said, "Lay your hands on and it'll be done." See, it's according to what you believe. Now, I I I I think the main goal is here is that you have faith. All right, all of you just have faith in the Lord. If laying hands up on you is going to get the job done for you. Praise the Lord. I believe that 100%. I have a lot of confidence in laying hands on the sick. I really do. I believe it's God's word. It's not my word. I didn't make it up. And so when we call people up to pray for them, I believe it with all my heart. It's in the scripture. James 5 and lay anoint them with oil and pray for them. And I believe it makes a difference. But there's a teaching for the Gentiles that we should be coming into. And there's a tutoring and a teaching that the redeemed son should be coming into. And that is the spoken word. And that is the word spoken from the mouth of the word of God ought to be enough. &gt;&gt; Now, if you can hear it spoken, then that's your permission right there. Then it's yours right there. If you can have faith to believe it, but it's according to what you believe. The prophet continues in what would visions are 1956. And he says this here, these handkerchiefs being I I have more success with the handkerchiefs, I guess, than anything else, especially with the American people. American people got an idea in their head that somebody has to touch them or do something to them or lay hands on them where they ever got that. Just a Jewish tradition. And I'm trying to get you to believe the Gentile way of it. See, the Jews says, "Now you come lay your hands on my little girl, she will live." Jarius, that was a Jew. But the Romans said, "I'm not worthy that you'd even come under my house. come under my roof said I'm a man under authority say to this one go he goeth everything under me has to mind me and he recognize the supreme authority that Jesus had over diseases he said you just speak the word and my servant will live now there you are that's it now Jesus never said too much about Jarius only he got what he asked for he went and laid his hand on the daughter. But he said to these people there that followed, he said, "Now that's great faith. I haven't found faith like that in Israel." See, now we want the greater faith. We want to run a higher level. The Lord Jesus wants us to believe in him. We want first class. That's how we want to fly. We want to fly first class. And we want the higher faith, the higher level. Now, we're not disparaging the other levels. They all get there. It's all faith. But Jarius did that because he was taught that way. The Roman did what he did because he was taught that way. and the prophet now through the word, the third pool and the opening of the word. What is he trying to teach those who are the children of Malachi 4? What is he trying to teach you sitting in the pew listening to the tape? What is he trying to teach you? Oh, I missed it. I wasn't here when the prophet was here. I missed the meeting. I wasn't here. Or is he trying to teach you to pick up the word &gt;&gt; and receive the word of the Lord that was spoken? Amen. Amen. And it's a higher level. We want a greater faith. We want the Lord Jesus wants us to believe him. This is the authority of the word of God that we have already been given that authority. Is that right? We've been given the authority, but we don't use it. Many times we're afraid to use it. Why is that? Why are we afraid to take God at his word? Um, it's the higher order of believing. It's what hopefully we're being taught and trained into. You know, the authority is like is like, you know, in those ranks in the Roman ranks or any soldier or any kind of hierarchy like that, you got to start somewhere. And some people can't receive authority and therefore they probably shouldn't be in authority. And some people want the authority, but they can't be submissive to nobody. Every job they had, it was the boss's fault or somebody else's fault. They can't submit. You know, submitting doesn't mean you're going to submit to people that are always right. You got to submit to people that are wrong. You got to submit to the situation until God gets through what he wants to accomplish in your life. I feel like Joseph was a prime example of somebody that went through all of the rungs of being a slave and being lied on and being tested and tempted. Now he's ruler over everything. That's the kind of man I would want judging my case. I wouldn't want somebody who's never been through nothing judging my case. If you're going to get a fair deal, you're going to get it from Joseph. Because Joseph knew what it was to be in the the the the the the very lowest of society around criminals and people who lied on him and all of those things that happened. And then and then to know that he really overcome brother John when he was at authority. Now he's got his position. This is the prime example, Joseph, to get him back. You got the power to get him and you can legally do it. But it proved that he really passed the test, didn't he? Because when he had the opportunity to turn it on his brothers, he didn't. He showed grace and forgiveness to them. Some of us want to get Joseph's place so we can get back at them. Soon as I get the opportunity, I'mma get them. I'mma get her. She messed with the wrong person this time. Soon as I get my money right, I'mma get you. And that's the attitude of many people. But Joseph, he went through all of that. He was given the authority. He's given the power. He's given now he's at the right. Could you imagine Joseph running into potterer and his wife? Imagine that. Now, Joseph, this woman lied on him. Got him sent into another prison. He doing more time when his life is doing kind of good. I mean, he's doing better than he ever did as a prisoner. But this woman lies on him and throws him into another prison and it's got this big old cycle again. And then the Lord begins to build him up and make it the way he made it. And then you come to find out the Lord wanted him in that particular prison. And so now he's up at a position of authority. Now he's placed above everybody. It's Pharaoh, then Joseph, and Piper had to be under there. Could you imagine Joseph, let me go hunt her down. Let me go get her. That lie she told on me. I'm going to That's how some of us are vindictive. It shows that our maturity isn't there yet. But when you really mature and you really got the healing that you needed and you really advanced by the right way, oh my, you'll be hunting them down to show them grace and favor. And this was Joseph. And we don't have that like we should. I don't think Lord help us. Right? How many can say Lord help us. God has given us a great heritage, a great portion of his word. And what if he gave you that power to do the miraculous today? Would you use that power against those that disagree with you? Would you use it in an argument? I'm going to prove you're wrong. Smoke them. Smoke. Would you use it as a pastor? You going to leave my church? I'm gonna show you you're wrong. Smoke them, Lord. call fire down. Lord, let their business burn up. I'm praying, "Dear Lord, let their business burn." That's not the right prayer. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. That's not a mature son. &gt;&gt; That's what foury olds do. That's what children do. But sons that have matured, they take that power and they have it graced with character. Now they got the power to hurt, but they're not going to use it to anyone's hurt. They now return it with grace. Now, &gt;&gt; it's frustrating trying to serve people. Um, this is why the people that work in the public, they have such a hard time and they're not happy really happy to see you. Many times they they got a bad attitude. The bus drivers and people serving the public and they just they've seen it. They're they got they're just upset. They have a bad and then, you know, you you take that over into the realms the church. You're trying to help people. They're trying to, you know, show them away and show grace and favor to them and then they turn around and do things that's a little shady. It makes you mad, right? And you want to get back at them. But you you'll know you're mature when you're not getting back at them. And you can. No, you're not done yet, sis. You're not done yet, bro. You need to come back. You still want to get back at them. Yeah. I just can't wait to come back. Come back. Come back. sit back in the back of the bus for a minute and you need to take this trip over again. Like, come on, Lord. I already took this trip. No, you ain't learned nothing yet. Lord, help us. And we get through our destination and we went through whatever we went through that we come out and all of our accusers and all of those that did whatever they did, there's nothing but grace and love and forgiveness to them. Lord have mercy upon them. Bless them. Lord have mercy. Show favor. Show grace. Maybe your attitude towards them might determine their eternal destination. That's a quote. Now, you want me to read it? It's in the message. It's in the fly leaf of my Bible. It's not in my notes. I'm going to close here just now. send spiritual revelation or it was changed to the great commission 1958 March 18. If you want a blessing and get a blessing when a man has done you wrong, he's absolutely justly I mean he has done you wrong and you know that he's done you wrong. He has done you evil. Don't mention that. you take him to prayer before God and don't take it in a way of just a selfish say well I'm ashamed to do this but stand with your shoulder to his shoulder and stand in the presence of God our father the way a prayer should be made in the presence of God say father here's my brother he is justly he deserves punishment because he has done me evil and I don't see why he did it then let go of talking to you and You'll see maybe what the man's been through. The devil has twisted him up somewhere and caused him to do that. Though he's absolutely wrong, before you leave the throne of God, you'll be feeling sorry for that man. You'll be sympathizing with that brother. When you get back down to where earth again, you'll go after to that brother and shake his hand because you know what he's been through. You can't stand with the mortal in the presence of God and condemn anybody. I don't believe. No. Even if he's a ranked sinner. What about a brother that made a mistake? Though I say he's wrong sometime that he's accused wrong when he's not wrong. But if he is wrong, we'll take him to the throne of God. stand there shoulderto-shoulder with our brother knowing he's immortal and maybe his destination rest upon our attitude towards him. Huh? When we come back from the throne of God, we'll realize that we're everyone guilty and we all need help one from the other and the best way is to pray. That's powerful. That's an authority. That's a You know, the the the believers, the Christians are the difference makers. &gt;&gt; The Christians that are in your family, that are on the job, that are in the neighborhood, they ought to be the difference makers. They're not the ones starting the fires. They're putting them out. It's sad. So many Christians join in in this negativity and they just start this thing and then they just get carnal and more carnal and more carnal when we're supposed to be headed to little gods. We're supposed to be moving into that realm of amateur gods. Is that right? An amateur god still gossiping. Amateur gods ain't gonna be gossiping. No, they're doing something different. A church members gossiping. Church members doing all kind of stuff. But an amateur god, he gonna get back at you. You going to find a way to catch to to to to you know get in a quote battle with you? I'm not looking for no quote battles, brother Scott. Brother John, get in a quote battle. I throw this quote at him. Hit them in the head with this quote. Then they hit me with a quote. Then I hit them back with a scripture. And we're fighting back. Fighting back. Hey man, I ain't got time for that. I'm supposed to be believing the word. Amen. somebody. It's a higher level. It's a higher order to take the spoken word. Now, we can lay hands upon you and we will. And I need hands laid upon me. Yes, I'll receive that. Absolutely. But what is the message trying to teach us? The higher level. And the higher level is the word said it. And we believe it that way. And not only does the word say it, but you say it. You speak the word. And that spoken word will take on flesh. It'll take on material. It'll happen if you believe it. The Roman centurion simply says, "Lord, if you say it in the word, my servant will live." And Jesus marveled at that. He stopped Jesus in his track. He had all of his disciples there. He had this great ministry, the thousands following him and coming after him. And the Romans says, "You know what? Keep keep ministering to them. You don't have to leave what you're doing. Just say the word. If you say the word, it's going to happen." And when he spoke the word, Jesus said, "Wow, what a faith. What a faith." And that very hour, boom, it happened. His servant was healed of a violent disease. He'll do the same thing for you today. If you believe that, you believe the spoken word can come forth from this pull pit here. Believe a scripture can be read that change the dynamics of what you're going through. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. That's where it comes from. It comes from the word. All right, let me read one more for you. Okay, and we'll close right here. The prophet now starts to share with us and we all know this. And he brings the difference between an angel and a son. And he's talking about the authority that a son has over an angel. Now in power, an angel would have more power as far as his ability to do things because he's created such. But a son has the authority over all the powers if he can only believe it. He's a slave. Yes, he's in the slave house. Yes, he's getting the same food. He's getting the same thing like the other slaves. But he knows he's taught that his daddy was the son that he's the son of a king. And so that slave owner was looking I never finished that story, did I? The slave owner I'mma finish it right now. Thank you. The slave owner was looking out over the house. He's like, I want to buy that one. Well, that one's not for sale. Well, why not? Well, that's the one I want. Why you want him? Is he prettier than others? Oh, I want him. Why do you want him? I've been watching him work. I've been watching him. And there's something about him that's different than the other slaves. His head is up. He's working. He's getting it done. You must He must be a boss. You must be feeding him more. He must have a position. Says, none of that is true. He's just a regular slave. Said, "What makes him act so different?" He said, the boss said, "I wonder, too." So, I found out that he is the son of a king. That over in Africa, his daddy is the king over a tribe. And even though he's an alien, he's a he's been taken in slavery, he's going to conduct himself like the son of a king. &gt;&gt; And that's you and I today. How are you conducting yourself? Are you looking for vengeance? Are you looking you got animosity in your heart? Are you jealous? You know, jealousy, look the word up. Jealousy is a spirit that wants to get on all kind of human beings. I'm talking about all colors, all genders, all positions. Jealousy is one of them. Preachers jealousy, other preachers, this guil jealous of that one. It's a spirit. It's not your brother is. Look the word up and you tell me, "Oh, that spirit never came. You stop telling a a lie like that. Jealousy is a real spirit. &gt;&gt; How many you know what I'm talking about? Who going to be honest here? Don't Don't raise your hand. Don't raise your hand. Cuz because if you sitting here, I know that spirit come to you. Anybody has anything like you or close to you, a little bit better than you, it's like you don't start hating on them. Jealousy. Church is jealous of other churches when we should be thankful and praising the Lord with a testimony. You giving a testimony you thinking people praising Lord people getting jealous over you and that spirit just one of them emulations. Emulations is to compete against greed. How many know what it means to be greedy? I'm not talking about getting a second scoop of ice cream or whatever it is. I'm talking about greedy, not content what the Lord has given you, never happy, just upset all the time. You're you if if if these spirits are on you, you're not walking your in your authority. Brother or sister, you're a son of the most high God. &gt;&gt; That's your authority. You're a son of God. You're a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Nothing can hurt or harm you or even stop you unless God allows it. So this slave, he's there, he's a son of the king. He's conducting himself like the son of the king. And the slave masters and everybody around him watching from afar can see it just like God can see you too. Your morale, the way you carry yourself. Just walk through the airport, you'll see the ones who have some kind of thing about them. Look at public. Look into the look into the just the worship of of just any little sanctuary. You just watch the believers. You watch them. You watch human nature. You watch people. People that have money, they walk a certain way. And people that are broke walk a certain way. I know what I'm talking about. Because I was broke. I'm still broke, but I don't act like I'm broke. There's a big difference because why? My dad owns everything. &gt;&gt; And if I need it, guess what? I'm going to have it &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; It's the authority. It's the authority. So, God bless you. I pray the Lord will bless you richly that you saints will move into this authority. I was going to read one more. I I'll reserve it another time. Okay. Come on now. Now. Now. That's an authority. That's a son coming to his position right there. Oh my. So, God bless you. I'm going to close with this one right here. The prophet of God says this here. See, in your body, inside of you, we got another question directly to answer it better. Inside of you is a spirit, another man. The outside of you is one man. The inside of you is another man. So the inside of you is the supernatural, the outside of you is the physical. See, and this being if you are spirit led by God, you become a messenger of God or an angel, God's messenger. God's angel. It's the very same word. Can't separate it. God's messenger or God's angel. And which has the greatest authority? an angel from heaven or an angel at the pull pit. Which has it? The angel at the pull pit. Paul said, "If an angel from heaven comes and preach any other gospel, what the this which I've already preached, let him be a curse." So the angel anointed with the Holy Spirit with the word stands next to God. That's right. in heaven, his authority. All powers in heaven and earth is given to my hand. Go and I'll go with you. Whatever you bind on earth, I'll bind in heaven. Whatever you loose on earth, I'll loose in heaven. Oh, if the great holy church only realizes power to do these things, but there's so much doubt and fear and trembling and wondering if it will, could it happen? As long as that exists, the church can never stand upright. And when every talk of fear is vanished and the Holy Spirit is completely in control in control of the church, then all fears are gone. And that church has the power. See why? They have everything that heaven owns behind them. They're ambassadors of the throne. Absolutely. An ambassador of Christ has the authority and everything that Christ owns belongs to that ambassador. And he said, "Go ye into all the world." You are my witnesses after the Holy Ghost has come on you. And what is a witness? Is an ambassador. It's to come and witness something. The whole powers of heaven is right in your hands. Oh, why do we sit and the church is barren and we sit dormant? Is because that we don't recognize these things. God help us. God help me to recognize these things. Lord, you don't have to trouble yourself. If you just show me the word, if you just say it in the word, my servant will live. And the Lord says, "Wow, that's great faith. That's a great faith. I haven't seen that in Israel. God help us that I that will be our testimony. That would be our faith." God bless you. God bless you. Let's pray. Musicians, come please. Heavenly Father, we thank you for the word this morning. We thank you for this time, Lord, to minister on these great principles, Lord. Thanking you for salvation.
