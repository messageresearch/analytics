[9:58] for me.
[10:01] Oh Jesus, I'll never forget what you
[10:04] done for me. Jesus, I'll never forget
[10:09] how he set me free. Oh Jesus, I'll never

[11:22] for me. I cannot tell it all. He has
[11:27] taken all my sins away. Spring up a
[11:31] well. Spring up a well
[11:34] within my soul.

[13:03] never.
[13:08] Amen. He's done so much for us.
[13:12] &gt;&gt; He's died. He died for us, too. Isn't
[13:15] that love? Isn't that love?
[13:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, he left the Splender
[13:26] of heaven,
[13:32] knowing
[13:34] his destiny
[13:42] towards a lonely
[13:45] hill of Galatha.
[13:53] dare to lay down his life
[13:58] for me.
[14:04] If that is the love,
[14:12] the ocean
[14:15] is dry.
[14:20] There's no stars in the sky.
[14:30] And the eagle
[14:34] can fly
[14:39] if that isn't
[14:42] love.
[14:46] Oh, heavens
[14:49] ab.
[14:54] There's no feeling
[14:57] like this.
[15:02] If that is your love.
[15:11] Even
[15:13] in death
[15:16] remember
[15:21] all the thief
[15:24] hanging by
[15:26] his side.
[15:32] He spoke
[15:35] with love and
[15:38] compassion.
[15:42] Then he took him to paradise.
[15:53] Give that
[15:57] love.
[16:02] The ocean
[16:04] is bright.
[16:10] There's no stars in the sky.
[16:17] And the eagle
[16:20] can't fly.
[16:26] If that is
[16:34] then heaven,
[16:41] there's no feeling like this.
[16:49] live that is in love.
[16:57] Amen.
[16:59] Let's sing that song. I surrender.
[17:02] Humble and broken,
[17:04] I surrender all to him.
[17:07] Humble and
[17:10] broken,
[17:13] I give
[17:16] to you.
[17:23] Trusting
[17:27] to see what you will do.
[17:40] At your feet I find my rest.
[17:46] I'm coming to you.
[17:55] I am
[18:01] I

[18:08] I

[18:15] Lord. I surrender my life.

[18:44] Lord. I surrender my life.
[18:51] I give it all to you. Let's sing that
[18:54] first verse one more time.
[19:01] Humbolden,
[19:06] broken,
[19:08] I
[19:10] come to you.
[19:16] I'm trusting
[19:19] and waiting
[19:22] to see what you will do.
[19:29] Lord, you know
[19:32] what is best.
[19:36] And at your feet I find my rest.
[19:42] I'm coming to you to be
[19:49] again. Lord, here I am.
[19:57] I surrender.
[20:04] I

[20:12] Lord, I surrender my life.
[20:19] I give it all to you.
[20:26] I
[20:28] surrender.
[20:34] I surrender.
[20:40] Oh Lord, I surrender my life.
[20:48] I give it all to you.
[20:59] Lord,
[21:01] your plan for me
[21:06] is
[21:12] I need you
[21:15] to fulfill your
[21:19] purposes.
[21:21] In my life,
[21:25] I submit
[21:27] to you
[21:29] my king.
[21:32] Oh, you be my everything.
[21:39] I'm coming to you
[21:44] again,
[21:46] Lord. Here I am.
[21:51] Let's stand and raise our hands. I
[21:55] surrender.
[22:01] I
[22:02] surrender.
[22:08] Lord, I surrender.
[22:12] I
[22:13] love I give it all to you.
[22:23] I surrender.
[22:30] I
[22:31] surrender.
[22:36] Oh Lord, I surrender my life.
[22:43] Oh, I give it all to you.
[22:51] Amen.
[22:54] I'm amazed that you love me, Lord. I'm
[22:56] amazed.
[22:59] Let's start with a verse. Sister Joy,
[23:03] no one knew. No one knew
[23:07] how alone
[23:09] I was feeling.
[23:13] And the emptiness I tried so hard to
[23:18] hide.
[23:21] Though I laughed and said my life was
[23:25] fine without you.
[23:29] I was covering up the secret tears. I
[23:34] cried.
[23:37] Then one day someone told me of your
[23:42] mercy
[23:45] and the love you showed on a hill called
[23:49] Calary.
[23:52] And there you
[23:56] purchased my redemption.
[24:01] when you broke his power and set my
[24:04] spirit free.
[24:08] I'm amazed
[24:12] that you love me.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; I'm amazed
[24:20] that you gave me
[24:24] through your preious
[24:27] blood. I found pardon.
[24:32] All my saints
[24:34] are washed there. All washed away. All
[24:40] my saint
[24:42] are washed away. Let's stand and sing a
[24:46] second verse. Is it true? There have
[24:50] been days when I failed you.
[24:55] Lord, you know the many times I've gone
[24:59] astray,
[25:02] but I
[25:06] love
[25:07] my weakness.
[25:11] &gt;&gt; And your ear is open every time I pray.
[25:18] No one else has ever cared for me like
[25:23] you, Lord. Other
[25:27] friends could never be as close.
[25:34] &gt;&gt; I'm not afraid to face the problems of
[25:38] tomorrow.
[25:42] Knowing you are everything I'll ever
[25:46] need.
[25:49] I'm amazed
[25:53] that you love me.
[25:56] Oh, I'm amazed
[26:01] that you care.
[26:04] Through your preious
[26:07] blood, I found pardon.
[26:12] All my sins
[26:15] are washed. They're all washed away. All
[26:20] my sins
[26:22] are washed
[26:24] away.
[26:26] Yes, it's true. Yes, it's true.
[26:31] Time has failed you.
[26:42] But I learned that your love is stronger
[26:47] than my weakness.
[26:51] And your ear is open every time I pray.
[26:58] No one else has ever cared for me like
[27:03] you, Lord.
[27:07] other friends could never be as close to
[27:11] me.
[27:14] I'm not afraid
[27:16] to make of tomorrow,
[27:22] knowing you are everything I'll ever
[27:27] need.
[27:29] I'm amazed
[27:33] that you love me.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; I'm amazed
[27:41] that you came
[27:45] through your preious
[27:47] blood
[27:53] and my sorrow.
[27:57] You're all washed away. All my sins
[28:03] are washed
[28:05] away.
[28:07] How many can thank the Lord for that?
[28:09] Amen. I'm amazed that you love me.
[28:13] Amen.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord Jesus Christ for his love
[28:18] towards us. Amen. We'd like to welcome
[28:21] each of you to the house of the Lord
[28:22] tonight as we prepare to go into the
[28:25] word in Ephesians chapter 1. Uh we'll be
[28:29] finishing up the adoption number four um
[28:32] that brother Brandon preached. I know
[28:35] it'll be a blessing to each and every
[28:36] one of us tonight. Amen. Thank the Lord
[28:40] for his presence that we can feel among
[28:43] us. And we just pray that the Lord Jesus
[28:46] will give us more of his grace and mercy
[28:50] &gt;&gt; through the preaching of his word. Amen.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:53] &gt;&gt; Ephesians chapter 1 verse number nine.
[28:59] having made known unto us the mystery of
[29:01] his will according to his good pleasure
[29:04] which he hath purposed in himself that
[29:07] in the dispensation of the fullness of
[29:09] times he might gather together in one
[29:13] all things in Christ both which are in
[29:17] heaven and which are on earth even in
[29:20] him in whom also we have obtained an
[29:24] inheritance
[29:25] being predestinated according to the
[29:28] purpose of him who workketh all things
[29:31] after the counsel of his own will. that
[29:34] we should be to his praise of that we
[29:37] should be to the praise of his glory who
[29:41] first trusted in Christ whom and whom ye
[29:45] also trusted after that you heard the
[29:48] word of truth gospel of your salvation
[29:52] and whom also after that you believed
[29:55] you were sealed with that holy spirit of
[29:58] promise
[30:00] &gt;&gt; which is the earnest of our inheritance
[30:02] hence until the redemption of the
[30:05] purchased possession unto the praise of
[30:08] his glory. And so, Brother Random kind
[30:11] of finishes up what this um what this
[30:16] purchase is and what this down payment
[30:19] is, the earnest. He talks about that a
[30:22] little bit tonight and we look forward
[30:24] to that and he'll close the meeting off.
[30:26] So, let's prepare to go there and sing
[30:29] only believe all things are possible.
[30:31] Amen. Only
[30:36] believe.
[30:40] Only
[30:42] believe
[30:46] that all things are possible.
[30:52] Holy,
[30:57] holy,
[31:06] we
[31:10] all things are possible.
[31:16] Holy
[31:19] Lord, I believe.

[31:31] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[31:34] And all things are possible.
[31:48] I believe
[31:54] I believe
[31:58] all things are possible

[32:08] bless you may be seated brother Brandham
[32:11] &gt;&gt; I'll hurry And then we're close cuz it's
[32:13] late and we pray for the sake.
[32:16] About five more minutes.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; 14th verse. Reasonably read the 13th
[32:22] over. Get it background. In whom you
[32:25] trusted after that you heard the word of
[32:27] the truth, the gospel of your salvation.
[32:32] Now remember what salvation they have.
[32:34] These were these were Ephesians
[32:35] Christians. They Now look, did you
[32:38] notice the Corinthians? He always had to
[32:40] tell them when I come among you, one has
[32:42] a tongue, one has a tongue, one has a
[32:44] psalm, one has a prophecy, one has See,
[32:46] he couldn't teach them nothing. Cause
[32:49] was always desiring this, that, or the
[32:51] other. These people had the same thing,
[32:53] but they had it in order.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; He never taught the Corinthians nothing
[32:57] like this. He couldn't. The church was
[33:00] in order to teach it. Now, he could
[33:02] teach these people a real thing. What's
[33:05] your salvation? In whom also after you
[33:08] believe, you receive what the Holy
[33:10] Spirit have promised, which is the
[33:12] earnest. Oh, let me not pass that. The
[33:17] earnest of our inheritance
[33:20] until redemption
[33:23] of the purchase possession
[33:27] unto the praise of his glory.
[33:30] What is the Holy Ghost?
[33:33] Now, then I'll read the rest of it real
[33:35] fast if you'll bear with me. this much.
[33:38] Where was we at the other night, brother
[33:41] Mike? Whether we're all happy. Oh,
[33:45] everything was peace. That was perfect
[33:47] love. Now, every time you come this way,
[33:50] you drop down a little. Drop. Every time
[33:52] you make a step, you come inches closer.
[33:54] When it gets down to the earth, you got
[33:56] a shadow of the shadow of the shadow of
[33:58] shadows. Now, that's how much Holy
[34:01] Spirit you got in you. That's love. But
[34:04] oh, you thirst for something. Oh, would
[34:07] not people like uh old old people. How
[34:12] would I like to go back and be 15 again?
[34:15] 20. Oh, I'd give anything. What good
[34:18] would it do me? I might be 15 and die
[34:21] yet tonight. It's uncertain. Well, if he
[34:24] was 15 tonight, how you know where the
[34:26] mother be living got home or not? How
[34:28] you know you're going to get home?
[34:31] How do you know you're going to be
[34:32] living tomorrow if you're 12 years old?
[34:34] Perfect health. You may be killed in an
[34:37] accident, dropped dead. Anything might
[34:38] happen to you. Uncertainty. There's
[34:40] nothing here certain. But you long for
[34:43] that. What is it? It's that up there
[34:46] making you long for it. Now you walk
[34:49] into this, then you have eternal life.
[34:52] Now what does it happen? It is the
[34:54] earnest.
[34:57] What is the earnest money on anything?
[34:59] If I come to you to buy a car,
[35:02] I say, "How much is that car?" You say,
[35:04] "This car, Brother Brown, cost you
[35:06] $3,000.
[35:08] What's the down payment?" "Well, I let
[35:11] you have it for $500." "All right,
[35:13] here's the $500. I'll I'll bring the
[35:16] rest of it to you sometime soon as I
[35:17] can. You hold a car. I'll give you $500.
[35:20] That's the earnest.
[35:22] Is that right?
[35:25] I hold that. It's the earnest. It's the
[35:27] down payment. After
[35:31] you were sealed by the spirit of
[35:33] promise. The spirit of promise. After
[35:35] you were sealed, which is what? What is
[35:39] this seal of promise? The Holy Spirit
[35:40] promise which is the earnest of our
[35:43] inheritance until redemption of the
[35:48] purchase possession.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; What is it?
[35:53] &gt;&gt; It's the down payment.
[35:56] And brother,
[36:04] &gt;&gt; if this is the down payment,
[36:06] &gt;&gt; what's it going to do?
[36:09] &gt;&gt; What is it going to be? If this is the
[36:12] if this what we enjoy now and get a
[36:14] happy I've seen man 90 years old just
[36:17] could not I seen an old preacher that
[36:19] raised out one night I said like this
[36:21] come out on platform and I said that old
[36:24] man go to preach and he said well bless
[36:27] the Lord no colored fellow great big old
[36:29] long preachers co on I said why didn't
[36:30] they let some of young preachers preach
[36:32] that old man how can he ever preach he
[36:34] said well he said bre and he said the
[36:37] day I've been hearing the brothers
[36:38] preach all day long he said about what
[36:39] Jesus done on earth I'm going to tell
[36:41] what he done to heaven. He said, "I'll
[36:43] take my text tonight from Job 7:27 said
[36:45] when way back down kind of before the
[36:46] foundation the world said when he said
[36:47] the morning stars sang together the sons
[36:49] of God shouted for joy like that said
[36:52] you know listen what something went on
[36:53] back then he said you know and he be to
[36:56] bring on what taking place in heaven
[36:58] brought him down the horizontal rainbow
[36:59] and the second coming about that time
[37:01] the Holy Ghost struck him
[37:04] now they had to lead the old fell out he
[37:06] was around 95 years old he's just like
[37:09] this all bent over and loose a little
[37:11] rim of hair you know like He got out
[37:12] there and he started preaching that
[37:14] peace. Hallelujah. Glory. Got the jump
[37:17] up down like that. Oh, you ain't got
[37:18] enough room. Your feet preach like that
[37:21] hard as he go.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; And that's just the earnest.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, what does the Holy Spirit do? Oh,
[37:36] here's a good place. Let me read the
[37:38] first verse of the next chapter. Can I?
[37:40] Is it all right? Say amen.
[37:42] All right. The first verse of the second
[37:44] chapter quickly listen. You who were you
[37:48] and you has he quickened who were one
[37:52] were dead in trespasses and sins.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; You has he quickened.
[37:59] What does quicken mean?
[38:01] &gt;&gt; Made a lie.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; Just about gone. But he quickened you
[38:08] just by the earnest money. What will it
[38:10] be when you when you really get all the
[38:13] dividends available? Oh, no wonder Paul
[38:17] caught up into the third heaven said,
[38:19] "Eye has not seen, ear has not heard,
[38:21] neither has it entered the heart of man
[38:23] what God has for them in store that love
[38:25] him."
[38:26] &gt;&gt; What will that be? You talk about joy
[38:28] unspeakable and full of glory.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. You were once dead in sin and
[38:35] trespasses has he quickened together by
[38:37] the shadow of the shadow of the shadows.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; What's it going to be when you come
[38:42] through the shadow of the shadows into
[38:45] the shadow? The shadow then into the
[38:47] creek. The creek into the river. The
[38:48] river into the ocean. And what is it
[38:51] when you're way out there in redemption
[38:54] with a brand new body? You turn back to
[38:57] a young man alltogether again or a young
[38:59] woman. You'll never go to die no more.
[39:02] And you look down on earth and think, I
[39:04] could enjoy some grapes and some good
[39:06] cold water, but you know, I don't need
[39:08] it here, but someday Jesus is coming.
[39:10] And this angelic body, this theophony
[39:14] that I'm living in will not come through
[39:17] the womb of a woman anymore. It'll not
[39:19] come through sexual desire anymore. But
[39:22] because that he was born without sexual
[39:24] desire, I'll be resurrected without it.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he will speak someday and the
[39:31] dead in Christ shall rise. And that body
[39:33] that I once lived in will resurrect into
[39:36] a glorified body. And I'll walk and I'll
[39:39] talk and I'll live and I'll enjoy.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:44] That is to come through Jesus Christ our
[39:46] Lord.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; There you are, brother. That's the
[39:50] gospel.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; Wherefore I also Paul's just telling now
[39:55] what he is. I'll read the rest of this
[39:56] and then we pray for the sake of
[40:00] until the possession.
[40:03] This is an earnest until the possession
[40:06] unto the praises of his glory. Wherefore
[40:09] I also after I heard of your faith, I
[40:12] heard that you believe this stuff. I
[40:15] heard that you really believe in
[40:16] predestination, eternal life, and
[40:18] salvation and so forth in the Lord Jesus
[40:21] and love unto all saints.
[40:24] cease not to give thanks to you, making
[40:27] mention of you in my prayers,
[40:30] that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[40:32] the Father of glory, may give unto you
[40:36] the spirit of wisdom and revelation,
[40:40] knowledge of him, just keep revealing
[40:42] himself to you all the time, growing
[40:45] from grace unto grace, from power unto
[40:48] power, glory unto glory, not fall back,
[40:53] but from glory under glory. Before we
[40:54] keep moving on, I'll keep praying for
[40:57] you. The eye uh the eyes of your
[41:01] understanding.
[41:05] You know, when the Bible said you were
[41:06] blind and didn't know it, but here Paul
[41:09] said, "I'm going to pray that your eyes
[41:10] of understanding, you understand with
[41:13] your heart." That's what he's talking
[41:16] about. You look with your eye, but you
[41:19] see with your heart.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; You know that. All right. that the God
[41:25] of glory. Let's see that the 18th verse.
[41:28] The eyes of your understanding be it
[41:30] enlightened that ye may know what is the
[41:34] hope of the calling and what the riches
[41:38] of glory of his in inheritance in the
[41:42] saints. And what is the exceeding
[41:46] greatness of his power to usward? They
[41:50] say the power is gone. The power hasn't
[41:53] even arrived yet.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Who believed according to the working of
[41:59] his mighty power.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; You who have believed to the working of
[42:03] his mighty power. I just pray that God
[42:05] will just pour out his power upon you.
[42:08] See,
[42:10] &gt;&gt; which he wrought in Christ when he
[42:12] raised him from him from the dead and
[42:15] set him at his own right hand in the
[42:17] heavenly places far above
[42:20] principalities, powers, might, dominion,
[42:24] and that every name that is named Oh,
[42:31] &gt;&gt; for no, I better not.
[42:35] We could sure take the rest tonight on
[42:37] that.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Every name that is named not only in
[42:42] this world but in the world to come.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; What is every what'sever name ever name
[42:50] of every person will bear the name of
[42:52] what?
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; The whole heaven's name Jesus.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; The whole church is named Jesus.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Everything is named Jesus. For it's the
[43:04] only name that God ever had.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; He's called Jehovah. Jehovah Gyra, the
[43:12] Lord's provided sacrifice. Jehovah Rapi,
[43:14] the Lord that health thee, Jehovah,
[43:16] Lord's banner, Manasses, Jehovah
[43:19] different Jehovah. He's called the
[43:20] morning star. He's called Father. He's
[43:23] called Son. He's called Holy Ghost. He's
[43:25] called Alpha. He's called Omega. He's
[43:27] called beginning. He's called the
[43:28] ending. He's called the branch. Oh, he's
[43:30] called Jesus called all kinds of titles.
[43:33] But he had one name.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; That's what Matthew was talking about.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; When he said, "Go ye therefore and teach
[43:41] all of baptizing them in the name."
[43:45] &gt;&gt; Not in names.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; In the name of the Father, Son and Holy
[43:51] Ghost. Father's not a name.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Son's not a name. Holy Ghost is not a
[43:57] name. It's a title to a name. Yes.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; It's a name of three attributes that
[44:04] belongs to one God.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; What was his name? The angel said, "Thou
[44:08] shalt call his name
[44:11] &gt;&gt; for he shall save his people from their
[44:14] sins."
[44:15] &gt;&gt; That's the reason they all baptized that
[44:16] way in the Bible.
[44:19] That's how St. Augustine baptized the
[44:21] king of England about
[44:24] about 150 200 years after the death of
[44:27] Christ
[44:29] in the name of Jesus Christ. All right.
[44:32] for above principalities, powers, might,
[44:35] dominion, that that every name that is
[44:38] named not only in this world, but also
[44:41] in that which is to come, and has put
[44:44] all things under his feet, and has given
[44:48] him to be the head over all things to
[44:53] the church, which is his body.
[44:58] Now, if my body has a power over all
[45:02] things, then what my body is is what I
[45:04] am. Is that right? That's what I am.
[45:08] That's what you know me as.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Well, then all that God was, he poured
[45:16] into Jesus.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; For he was the fullness of the Godhead
[45:20] bodily. Is that right?
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; And all that Jesus was, he poured into
[45:24] the church. Amen.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; These things that I do shall you do all
[45:28] things also. Even greater than this
[45:30] shall you do.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; For I go to the Father,
[45:36] which is his body, the fullness of him
[45:39] that fillth all in all.
[45:42] Oh, how I love that.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; How I love that. Yes.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; I was reading the other day a book that
[45:48] was wrote about a trip I went to
[45:50] minister in Africa. Never did read it
[45:54] before.
[45:55] How many ever read the book Prophet
[45:57] Visits Africa? In there, I was looking
[46:00] at a little Indian boy. How many seen
[46:03] that picture? I heard a certain
[46:06] evangelist been praying for the sick for
[46:08] about 15 years or more. He said, "I
[46:12] never seen a miracle performed in my
[46:14] life." He said, "I've seen people that
[46:17] said they had headaches, got well. I've
[46:19] seen people say they had tummy ache, got
[46:21] well, and so forth. But a miracle,
[46:24] something that created and made
[46:26] something. I thought that boy already
[46:27] been standing there and seen that. That
[46:30] Indian boy's leg was just about this big
[46:32] around one of them. The other was a
[46:35] normal leg like a human being's leg. And
[46:37] if you notice his brace, there was his
[46:39] shoe about 14 in or 15 in high like
[46:44] this. He had an iron plate on the bottom
[46:46] of it. His shoe set up on top of two
[46:50] long standers that stood. He walked up
[46:52] to where I was standing. They brought
[46:54] him up there. He had two crutches. He
[46:56] took this big arm, shoot him, chomped it
[46:58] down like that. I looked at his leg.
[47:00] He's about that big around. Now them
[47:02] people are Mohamad. Mohamadins. Did you
[47:06] remember last Sunday when I read you
[47:08] what the papers had to write? I've got
[47:10] it right here myself from Africa sent to
[47:12] me by our returned missionary brother
[47:15] Stricker. There's the article how Billy
[47:17] Graham backed up on it.
[47:19] Exactly that. The Mohammad push him
[47:21] right into the sea. What's the matter?
[47:23] The missionaries are leaving the field.
[47:24] What used to stand any longer?
[47:27] They're just whipped.
[47:30] I love Billy Grim and think he's a
[47:32] wonderful man of God. But what Billy
[47:34] Grim ought to have charged him with
[47:35] said, "Wait a minute.
[47:38] If some of these self-starch Baptists
[47:40] would have let him do it, I believe he
[47:42] would have done it.
[47:44] I believe Billy Grim's a man of God. But
[47:47] if he'd said, "Wait a minute. I'm a
[47:49] minister of the gospel. You believe in
[47:52] the Old Testament and you said that
[47:54] Jesus wasn't nothing but a man. I
[47:57] challenge you on a debate.
[47:59] I don't believe you taking the devil's
[48:01] challenges. No sir. But I have
[48:02] challenged him back and said, "Let you
[48:04] and I come together. I'm a doctor of
[48:06] divinity. Billy Grim is a doctor of
[48:08] divinity. Let me u challenge you on this
[48:12] and let me prove to you that Jesus was
[48:14] the Christ." Now, when it comes to
[48:16] divine healing, I don't possess those
[48:18] gifts, but we've got some brothers that
[48:20] does.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Now, if you want to bring them people
[48:25] out there, let me just call one of them
[48:28] or Roberts or somebody.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Somebody that has a great ministry that
[48:32] would really get there, come over there
[48:34] and and see what take place. Say,
[48:36] "Christianity is not what you think it
[48:38] is." Now, everybody feels let down
[48:41] because he just walked off and left him.
[48:43] Of course, now I don't believe in the
[48:45] devil giving you a challenge. I've
[48:47] spitten his face too like that and
[48:48] walked away from him. That's right. But
[48:50] when it comes to a place where Billy
[48:52] could have could have made that Mohamad
[48:54] feel like a little weed like that,
[48:56] &gt;&gt; he could have took that Bible and took
[48:58] Isaiah 9 and6 and said, "Who was he
[48:59] talking about? Unto us a child is born.
[49:02] To us a son is given." Who was this man?
[49:05] Who was he was talking about? Who was
[49:08] this prophet? Who was this Messiah that
[49:10] was to come? Show me where he produced
[49:12] himself in Muhammad. He was wounded for
[49:14] our transgressions, bruised for our
[49:15] iniquity, chasted our peace upon him
[49:17] with his stripes, we were healed. Show
[49:18] it to me in Muhammad.
[49:21] How did he cry, my God, my God, why has
[49:23] thou forsaken me that pierced my hands
[49:24] and my feet and so forth. Show me by
[49:26] your own word, your own testament. Why
[49:29] he had beat that Muhammad so bad that he
[49:31] wouldn't know where he was at? That's
[49:33] right. But when the paper had to turn
[49:35] around, that's what hurt what made my
[49:38] heart jump. When said there though Billy
[49:40] had to back up and made a backup, how
[49:42] can the Muhammad say that it was wrong
[49:45] said when Reverend William Brandham at
[49:47] Durban South Africa on undisputed
[49:50] miracle after miracle
[49:54] when 10,000 Mohamads fell on their face
[49:56] at one time and surrendered their life
[49:58] to Jesus Christ.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. They know about it.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Them fundamentals know about it. Don't
[50:05] you tell me. One time this one come to
[50:07] Jesus said, "Rabbi," you know, he was a
[50:10] Pharisee. He said, "We know your teacher
[50:11] come from God." We know it.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; We know it because no man could do the
[50:16] things you do except God be with him.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; We understand it. We know it, but we
[50:20] just can't confess it. See, cuz if we
[50:22] do, well, we will put out of our church.
[50:24] See, we'll lose our prestige. And so
[50:27] Jesus said began to tell him, "You must
[50:29] be born again." On that Mohamadan boy
[50:31] when he was standing there, there's his
[50:33] picture. The camera won't take a line.
[50:36] There he's standing there, one leg that
[50:39] much shorter about 14 inches than the
[50:41] other one, standing on that iron shoe.
[50:45] Said to him, I said, "Do you speak
[50:46] English?" "No, sir." Couldn't speak
[50:49] English. The interpreter said he don't
[50:50] speak English. "How long you been that
[50:52] way?" The interpreter asked him, "Since
[50:54] birth, can you move the leg at all?"
[50:57] "No, sir."
[50:59] "Do you believe in Jesus Christ?" He
[51:02] said, "I'm a Mohamadan."
[51:04] I said, "Will you accept Jesus Christ if
[51:06] he'll make you well?" I will accept
[51:07] Jesus Christ as my savior. He make me
[51:10] well. If he'll make that well, that leg
[51:12] come like the other. You'll accept him.
[51:14] I will.
[51:16] Oh, God. What will you do? This is the
[51:18] next thing. All questions are answered.
[51:22] Brother Mike got the feeling.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; I waited just a minute to see what he
[51:25] was going to say. I looked over and seen
[51:27] the boy going walking along like side of
[51:29] the walls like that.
[51:31] I said, "How many of you Muhammads will
[51:33] accept it?" Here's a Muhammad and the
[51:35] boy. Look at him. Stand him up there. I
[51:37] said, "You doctors, you want to look at
[51:39] him?" There he stands. Oh, you know
[51:41] where you're at, Dan.
[51:43] You know where you're standing.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Nobody. There he was. I said, "Walk
[51:48] across this way, son." And they got him.
[51:50] Here it comes. Shalom. Shalom. I said,
[51:54] "Look like about 12, 14 inches short."
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Like that. Yeah. Thousands of those
[52:00] black hands went up out there through
[52:01] like that.
[52:04] But Lord, now's the time. I said,
[52:06] "Heavenly Father, if you ever answered,
[52:08] answer me now. This is for your glory.
[52:11] This is for you.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; I pray you make this boy well."
[52:15] I just prayed over him. I said, "Take
[52:17] off your shoe."
[52:19] He looked at me real funny interpreter.
[52:21] I said, "Take off your shoe." He unlen
[52:25] vision what was going to happen. He took
[52:27] off that thing. When he tucked it back,
[52:29] walked over there to me. Both legs just
[52:31] as normal as both of them walking like
[52:32] this. I said, "You want to walk back and
[52:34] forth?" He started crying
[52:38] &gt;&gt; like that. Going back and forth. He
[52:40] didn't know what to do.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Walking like that. He said, "Oh, I said,
[52:44] "Jesus, Jesus.
[52:47] Oh, Jesus. Jesus." And Jesus, Jesus. I
[52:50] got I said, "Is there any questions? Any
[52:54] questions?" Julius Stadcliffe. time
[52:56] knows he brother stats please come here
[52:58] at the church just just went to Germany
[53:01] &gt;&gt; said just a minute brother Brand just a
[53:03] minute so bring a photographer can I get
[53:05] his picture I said walker stand your
[53:07] shoe here you stood like that took the
[53:09] picture of the boy there's both legs
[53:10] just his arm and straight they could be
[53:12] there his old shoe embraced like that
[53:14] like that I said how many of you
[53:16] Muhamadans now reject Muhammad his
[53:18] prophet and believe Jesus to be the son
[53:20] of God and accept him as your personal
[53:22] savior 10,000
[53:25] Amen.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; They don't want to.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; They try to keep it back because we're
[53:34] holy rollers. He call us. You see, just
[53:37] the same God's a moving
[53:39] &gt;&gt; placing his church. He's doing it
[53:42] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[53:44] could even do or think.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; He's just as much God tonight as he ever
[53:48] was. So little friends, let me tell you
[53:50] something right now. My darling precious
[53:52] people, you here in this land and the
[53:54] others in tape lands which will be
[53:56] overseas and wherever you are. Don't be
[53:58] afraid. Everything's all right. Father
[54:01] God before the foundation of the world
[54:03] knew everything that would happen.
[54:04] Everything works right along. You love
[54:06] him. Keep your heart right. And
[54:09] remember, when this breath passes from
[54:11] this life to you old people or to you
[54:14] young people and you mothers, when you
[54:16] see your little babies, that little girl
[54:18] baby died when she wasn't 8 days old or
[54:21] 5 days old. She'll be a beautiful young
[54:23] woman when you see her.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; That old grandpa was all so stoked over
[54:28] he couldn't hardly see where he was
[54:29] going. When you seen grandmother, he'll
[54:32] be a fine, handsome young man, just as
[54:34] young as about 20 years old, just in a
[54:37] splendor of youth. And he'll be that way
[54:39] forever.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; You can touch his hand. You can shake
[54:42] hands with him. You'll throw your arms
[54:44] around him. But he won't be hubby. He'll
[54:47] be brother. Oh,
[54:50] &gt;&gt; he'll be so much greater than hubby. You
[54:52] think you loved him? Sure you did. But
[54:55] that was Felio. Wait till you get a
[54:57] goppel. Wait till that real divine love
[55:00] catches and name on him. This year this
[55:03] is like an old smoldering dump. It's no
[55:06] good. There's nothing to it. Only thing
[55:08] I advise you to do now is this. My my my
[55:11] friends.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; A little later on, I would you like for
[55:14] me to pick up them other two chapters
[55:15] sometime? Lord, I I got to rest just a
[55:18] little before talk. Now, I can't
[55:20] preach these things in that meeting.
[55:22] It's too many too many different
[55:24] beliefs. See, this is just church alone.
[55:28] See, I can't preach. I got a right to
[55:30] preach in here whatever I want to. This
[55:32] is my tabernacle.
[55:33] And I'm telling you now, I believe that
[55:35] people are saved. Yes, sir. I truly
[55:37] believe. But oh, how much more it is to
[55:40] walk when you know where you're walking.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; How much know is to know what you're
[55:44] doing. You see, instead of staggering,
[55:46] stumbling along, let's just stand right
[55:47] up in the light and walk in the light.
[55:49] Know which way you're headed.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; That's true. The Lord be with you. And
[55:53] if each one of you in here now has not
[55:56] been positionally placed, you might not
[55:59] be nothing but a housewife. Well, you
[56:01] say, "Brother Brandon, I never done a
[56:03] thing in my life. I'm not a preacher."
[56:05] Well, maybe God brought you here to
[56:07] raise a family of children. Out of that
[56:09] family of children may come another
[56:11] family of children that'll be a preacher
[56:12] that'll send a million souls to Christ.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; You had to be here. You're here for a
[56:17] purpose. Did you know that?
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Or you say, "All I ever done was hide
[56:21] across these old clouds. I take out
[56:24] early in the evening, get high, make my
[56:25] kids a living. I looked at the poor
[56:27] little fellas with no shoes on. I sat
[56:29] and cried. I got an old buggy man. Mo
[56:32] went to church. Don't you worry,
[56:33] brother. You just keep loving him. He's
[56:36] got a purpose for you. You just stay
[56:38] right the way you are. Just go right on.
[56:40] See, you might not never preach a
[56:42] sermon, but you might be the great
[56:44] grandfather of one that'll do it.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Did you know that God credited
[56:54] uh let's see now? What was his name?
[56:56] Levi to pay tithe when he was in the
[57:00] loins of Abraham when Melzdc met him.
[57:02] How many knows that?
[57:04] &gt;&gt; And let's see. Abraham begott Isaac.
[57:08] Isaac begot Jacob. Jacob begot um
[57:14] Levi which was father, grandfather,
[57:18] greatgrandfather. When he was in the
[57:21] loins in the seed of his
[57:25] greatgrandfather,
[57:26] the Bible credit him for paying tied.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; My
[57:38] brother,
[57:39] &gt;&gt; oh,
[57:40] as a little as a little Englishman got
[57:43] converted over there one night in
[57:44] England, he said, "I am so happy.
[57:48] I am so happy yet so happy to know
[57:56] that that is true and some glorious day.
[58:00] I don't know when that day will be, but
[58:03] if that was the vision, I don't say I
[58:06] was here. I remember always bear this in
[58:08] mind. May the tape holders do the same.
[58:11] Whether I was in a vision or carrying
[58:14] away in the spirit, I do not know. But
[58:18] it was just as real as I hold my brother
[58:21] Neville.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Just as real. And I could look and talk
[58:25] to those people. And there stood my
[58:28] first wife.
[58:30] She didn't holler at my husband. She
[58:33] said, "My darling brother."
[58:36] There stood a girl that I used to go
[58:38] with years ago. Perhaps some number of
[58:40] people sitting near. Alice Lewis from
[58:43] Utica. Very fine royal Christian girl.
[58:46] Got married a little late in life and
[58:47] had her first baby and died in
[58:49] childbirth. Alice Lewis. I walked into
[58:52] the funeral home to see her. I just got
[58:53] in home. I heard she was dead. I walked
[58:55] down there. There's nobody in the room.
[58:56] I said, "Is there a woman here, Mrs. Her
[58:58] name was Emiry. She married a fine
[59:00] Christian boy and she is a fine
[59:02] Christian girl. I've been with that girl
[59:04] everywhere. All kinds of places and
[59:06] everything and just kids 18, 19 years
[59:09] old everywhere. Fine Christian and never
[59:12] know nothing about it but genuine
[59:13] Christianity. I was a sinner. But I
[59:17] would go with her. I walked into and her
[59:19] husband a bornagain Christian, real man.
[59:22] And I didn't know I know she was dying.
[59:24] I'd seen the paper. I went down. They
[59:26] told me I went down there to cooches and
[59:28] I said, "Have you got a Mrs. Emerick?"
[59:29] He said, "Billy, she's right in the room
[59:31] there." I went in there and stood there
[59:33] by the side of the casket. I thought,
[59:35] "Alice, I've been in the darkest of
[59:38] dungeons. I've been over dark roads. You
[59:41] and I have walked together down through
[59:43] the roads and down across the the river
[59:46] when used to have the old showboats.
[59:47] We'd sit down and listen to that clappy
[59:49] play up and down the lanes. What a lady
[59:53] you were. How I thank God for your life.
[59:56] Rest, my dear sister. Rest in the peace
[59:59] of God. And the other night in the
[1:00:01] vision, there she come running to me.
[1:00:03] She said, "My blessed brother." And
[1:00:06] threw her arms around me.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, sister. It's changed me.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; I can never be the same no more.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; It's so real. It's just it's just as
[1:00:22] real as I'm looking at you.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Just that real. So there is no fear. I
[1:00:28] may die before the night's over. I want
[1:00:31] to raise my little boy back there,
[1:00:32] Joseph. I want to see him in a pull pit.
[1:00:35] When I can take this Bible,
[1:00:38] when I get to a place I see Joseph in
[1:00:40] the pull pit preaching as a as a young
[1:00:42] man filled with the Holy Ghost, anointed
[1:00:45] with the spirit of God upon him, and I
[1:00:47] believe he'll be a prophet.
[1:00:49] The day when I when I when I saw him six
[1:00:52] years before he's born, you remember me
[1:00:54] telling you he was coming.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Remember when I caught him right there
[1:00:56] at the side of the altar, not knowing
[1:00:58] what I was saying, dedicating babies. I
[1:01:00] said, "Joseph, thou art a prophet?" The
[1:01:02] other day standing out in the yard
[1:01:03] already come to me and he said, "Daddy,
[1:01:05] has Jesus got a hand like yours?" And I
[1:01:08] said, "Well, yes, son. Why?" He said, "I
[1:01:11] sitting on my bicycle watching for
[1:01:13] Sarah," that's his little sister to come
[1:01:15] home from school. Sitting out there, I
[1:01:16] won't let him go out on the road. He's
[1:01:18] sitting back like this and said I was
[1:01:19] looked up and said when I did there's a
[1:01:22] hand like yours with a white sleeve
[1:01:24] holding over me
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; and said it went on up said was that
[1:01:27] Jesus's hand going up
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; I looked at the mother looked at me we
[1:01:32] went out to Miss Woodses every where
[1:01:34] she's at sitting here we cross question
[1:01:36] him back and forth in every way we could
[1:01:39] vision he saw it when I can see the time
[1:01:42] at little Joseph standing I hope I live
[1:01:44] to see married of Jesus terries and I'm
[1:01:46] an old Man, the gray whiskers hanging
[1:01:49] around my neck here. I've sent I want to
[1:01:52] send two or three more million souls to
[1:01:54] Christ if I possibly can. It's my
[1:01:56] determination to preach the gospel to
[1:01:59] every corner of the earth.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So help me God. So when I can
[1:02:04] see that time come, Brother Mike, I can
[1:02:06] look at the time. Mama media, I call her
[1:02:09] my darling. See, she's we're getting
[1:02:12] old. See her hair turning gray and see
[1:02:14] us going away, fading away. Rebecca, I'm
[1:02:17] grateful for Rebecca. Her music teacher
[1:02:19] told me the other night said, "My if she
[1:02:21] keeps that up, Brother Brandham said
[1:02:22] it's hard to tell what she'll do." See,
[1:02:24] going on music, I want her and I want I
[1:02:26] want Sarah on the organ, Becky on the
[1:02:28] piano. I want Joseph in the pulpit.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; And I can see that happen. And me and
[1:02:33] mama can stagger in me on my old cane
[1:02:35] some night. Come down along the road.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; I can look in there and see my voice in
[1:02:40] there
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; anointed with the Holy Ghost.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. preaching the same gospel.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; I want to take this old book and say,
[1:02:47] "Son,
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; here it is. It's yours. You stand with
[1:02:51] it. Don't you compromise on one word.
[1:02:54] You stay right with it, honey. Don't you
[1:02:57] don't care. I don't care who's against
[1:02:58] you, who's God will be for you. You
[1:03:01] preach every word just the way it's
[1:03:02] wrote in there. And daddy will see you
[1:03:04] across the river."
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; I like to reach around and take her in
[1:03:06] my arms,
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; my wife, and cross over Jordan. Until
[1:03:11] that time, God, let me stay on the field
[1:03:14] loyal. Let me I don't care what cost is
[1:03:17] or how many what I do or this that. Let
[1:03:19] me stay loyal and true to the word of
[1:03:21] the living God. That when that day
[1:03:23] comes, I cross over there and I can look
[1:03:25] cross and say, "There you are. Oh my
[1:03:29] precious friend, my precious brother, my
[1:03:32] precious sister, young preacher, get
[1:03:34] into the field. Stay into the harness.
[1:03:37] All you young preachers and things,
[1:03:38] don't you sit around. Don't you just sit
[1:03:41] and do nothing. Get out young and win a
[1:03:43] soul. Do something. Get on. Get moving.
[1:03:46] Don't stop. Young preacher over there.
[1:03:48] God bless your heart. He reminds me of
[1:03:50] when I was about that age, I guess, and
[1:03:52] maybe a little younger than him. I was
[1:03:53] only about 20 something years old and I
[1:03:55] laid that cornerstone there. I remember
[1:03:57] I used to wear a blue coat and a white
[1:04:00] pair of pants and stood there and laid
[1:04:02] that cornerstone about 31 years ago.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; See how old I was. I was just a boy. and
[1:04:08] stand there laying that cornerstone. I
[1:04:10] haven't compromised on one word. I've
[1:04:13] kept it just exactly the way I laid that
[1:04:16] cornerstone. Y's my testimony laying y
[1:04:18] where I wrote it out on the fly leaf of
[1:04:20] the Bible and tore it out and laid it in
[1:04:22] that cornerstone and she still lays
[1:04:23] there. May it be written on the pages of
[1:04:26] God's eternal word in heaven. Let me
[1:04:28] stand true unto the end. Let us bow our
[1:04:31] heads now just a minute for prayer.
[1:04:37] in the closing of this night, the
[1:04:40] closing of these one chapter which is
[1:04:43] not justified.
[1:04:45] You ought to have the other how he goes
[1:04:46] ahead and places a church in his place.
[1:04:48] I'll get it to you sometime, God
[1:04:50] willing. I've got to get just a little
[1:04:52] rest now before going to the shiitaka y
[1:04:54] to another big meeting when I cross over
[1:04:56] there to Oklahoma from there on to
[1:04:58] Plymouth Falls and Plymouth Falls on
[1:05:00] down to California up into Yakamo. Won't
[1:05:02] be back until next August the 15th. But
[1:05:05] look, let me ask you something. If
[1:05:08] something should happen to you or I
[1:05:11] before that time comes, if I should pass
[1:05:15] over the river into that land,
[1:05:18] or if you should pass over before that
[1:05:20] time into that land, do you feel the
[1:05:23] assurance tonight that we'll meet there
[1:05:25] in that place? If you do, raise up your
[1:05:27] hand. Say, I feel the assurance in my
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, amen.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:05:34] If there's one of you that doesn't feel
[1:05:35] the assurance that they would be there
[1:05:37] and would like to say, "Remember me,
[1:05:38] Brother Brandham, that I will have that
[1:05:41] assurance," raise up your hand. I want
[1:05:44] to be there, too. God bless you, lady.
[1:05:46] God bless you.
[1:05:52] Our heavenly father,
[1:05:54] we bring to you tonight this
[1:05:57] congregation.
[1:05:58] Every hand, as far as I know, was up.
[1:06:02] All but one person, some precious soul
[1:06:07] sitting back here,
[1:06:09] just a little weary whether they could
[1:06:12] cross over the land where there's enough
[1:06:15] of real divine love in their heart and
[1:06:17] that precious woman's heart that she had
[1:06:20] come to that land or she is dying
[1:06:22] tonight. Would it pour her weary soul
[1:06:26] into the promised land of God?
[1:06:29] Father in heaven, as I have stood here
[1:06:31] at this pulp pit and preached and
[1:06:34] sweated and cried and begged and
[1:06:36] persuaded,
[1:06:38] let me ask you once more, Lord. Let me
[1:06:41] ask for my sister back there.
[1:06:45] God placed within her heart tonight
[1:06:49] that divine love, that Holy Spirit of
[1:06:52] God,
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; that peace that passes all understanding
[1:06:57] that she would receive thy spirit be
[1:07:00] sealed away by the Holy Ghost until that
[1:07:03] day. I want to see her, Lord, when we
[1:07:06] cross over the bridge. If it's if it's
[1:07:08] my if it's my privilege to cross, if
[1:07:11] that what you showed me is real and I
[1:07:14] cross there, I want to meet her there
[1:07:17] and see her running grab me by the hand
[1:07:19] and say, "My precious brother,
[1:07:22] it was that night that something told me
[1:07:23] to raise up my hand when you got through
[1:07:25] preaching on the book of Ephesus. I
[1:07:28] raised up my hand and something happened
[1:07:30] to me after that. Here I am. I'm young
[1:07:34] now forever. God grant it to that
[1:07:37] precious one
[1:07:39] these who have raised their hands that
[1:07:41] they have been sealed away by the Holy
[1:07:43] Ghost. The spirit of God is upon them
[1:07:46] and they have received the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:48] They're sealed away with that godly love
[1:07:50] in their hearts. How we thank you for
[1:07:53] them
[1:07:54] realizing, Father, that out into the
[1:07:57] world these tapes will go. Many
[1:07:59] microphones are stretched across this
[1:08:01] pulpit which means that tapes are being
[1:08:04] made turning back there. The voice will
[1:08:06] be going into different lands across the
[1:08:08] world, around the world. 20 or 30
[1:08:11] different nations will hear it. I pray
[1:08:14] for every person that hears this tape
[1:08:17] that hasn't got that hope of eternal
[1:08:19] life, that hasn't got the baptism of the
[1:08:21] Holy Spirit, may it come to their hearts
[1:08:24] sweetly. Grant it, Lord. And may I, if I
[1:08:28] never see them in this life, when I
[1:08:30] cross over into that land, may their
[1:08:33] running grab me. And I grabbed them and
[1:08:35] they we holler at precious brother to
[1:08:38] one another say I heard your tape on
[1:08:41] Ephesus.
[1:08:42] How that God predestinated us eternal
[1:08:45] life and it was on that tape that I
[1:08:48] received the voice of God and was sealed
[1:08:50] away by the Holy Ghost into the kingdom
[1:08:52] of God. Grant it, Father, heal all
[1:08:55] that's sick and afflicted. Give glory
[1:08:57] into thyself for we commit all this unto
[1:09:00] thee in all efforts in the name of Jesus
[1:09:02] thy son. Amen.
[1:09:05] Is there any here that's sick and wants
[1:09:07] to have hands laid on to be prayed for?
[1:09:10] Would you raise your hands? All right.
[1:09:12] Would you walk quietly now to the altar
[1:09:15] right here and stand just a moment while
[1:09:17] brother Neville comes with us?
[1:09:35] All this seems praying for the sick.
[1:09:38] This just seems like coming down to
[1:09:40] where you know where you're standing
[1:09:41] exactly.
[1:09:43] God knows all about this.
[1:09:47] When I hear that song, remember
[1:09:50] if you all are living when I go
[1:09:54] play this for me only believe. Remember,
[1:09:57] I'm not dead.
[1:09:59] I won't be very far from you listening
[1:10:01] at it.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; I can't die. Jesus gave me eternal life.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Going to raise me up at the last day.
[1:10:12] I'll see you. And if you go, I'll
[1:10:14] believe the same thing for you. I
[1:10:17] believe we'll see one another again.
[1:10:20] Look at this precious lady standing here
[1:10:22] with gray hair.
[1:10:24] You're Christian
[1:10:28] filled with his spirit waiting for him
[1:10:29] coming. Just stand out here waiting for
[1:10:32] the boat to come along. Amen.
[1:10:34] Oh, sister.
[1:10:39] Praise the Lord. Musicians, come please
[1:10:42] sweep over my soul. Sweep over my soul.
[1:10:46] We're going to take some prayer requests
[1:10:48] for those that have one tonight. I had
[1:10:52] one written here for um
[1:10:57] Melissa Snow has severe back pain and
[1:11:02] she asked for prayer
[1:11:04] asked for us to remember us in prayer.
[1:11:06] Sister Melissa Melissa Snow. So we want
[1:11:10] to keep her in prayer. Was there someone
[1:11:11] else that has a request tonight you'd
[1:11:14] like to make known? No one. Yes.
[1:11:20] for Sister Bethy's hand. Yeah, we'll do
[1:11:22] that. Let's stand and sing that song.
[1:11:25] Someone else have

[1:12:22] my hallelujah. Hallelujah.

[1:12:37] my soul.
[1:12:42] My rest
[1:12:45] is complete
[1:12:48] while I sit
[1:12:51] at your feet.
[1:12:54] Holy Spirit,
[1:12:57] sweep over.
[1:13:00] One more time. Let's ask him one more
[1:13:02] time.
[1:13:04] Oh, sweep over
[1:13:10] Lord Jesus. By your power, by your
[1:13:13] grace, by your healing,
[1:13:15] by your peace, oh God
[1:13:18] spirit.
[1:13:21] Hallelujah.
[1:13:23] Yes, Lord Jesus.
[1:13:26] We need you every hour. Father,
[1:13:30] press
[1:13:34] while I sing,
[1:13:38] please.
[1:13:40] Sweet spirit,
[1:13:44] oh
[1:13:46] my soul.
