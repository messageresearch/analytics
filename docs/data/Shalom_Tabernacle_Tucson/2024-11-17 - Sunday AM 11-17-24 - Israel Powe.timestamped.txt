[4:01] now now remember this is the Revelation
[4:03] you cannot take from it now what a
[4:05] challenge find one person in the Bible
[4:08] one place they ever baptized anybody in
[4:10] the name of father son holy ghost or
[4:12] ever sprinkle anybody find that in the
[4:15] Bible for the remission of their sins
[4:17] they never and every person no matter
[4:19] how they was baptized had to come and be
[4:21] baptized over again in the name of Jesus
[4:23] Christ to get the Holy Ghost Acts 19
[4:25] Paul passed through the upper course of
[4:27] ephes finds certain disciples he said
[4:29] disciples they're having a great meeting
[4:30] there were following a man by the name
[4:32] of Apollos who was a converted lawyer a
[4:34] Baptist who believed on John the Baptist
[4:37] and is proven by the scriptures that
[4:38] Jesus was the Christ Paul passed through
[4:40] and seen a quill and Priscilla in the
[4:41] 18th chapter of the acts and then he
[4:43] went over to have a dinner or something
[4:45] other with the quill and Priscilla they
[4:46] told him about this great man they went
[4:48] to hearing he listened at him that night
[4:50] he said he's very well that's very fine
[4:52] that's good but said have you received
[4:54] the Holy Ghost since you have believed
[4:56] what about you poor Baptist back there
[4:58] believe you received the Holy Ghost when
[4:59] you believe he said have you received
[5:02] the Holy Ghost sent you believe someone
[5:04] said that wasn't written in that I defy
[5:06] that I've got the authentic Greek right
[5:07] you're Hebrew
[5:09] too the Bible says in the Greek and both
[5:11] Hebrew and also in
[5:14] arenic all three them I got them right
[5:16] here that said have you received the
[5:18] Holy Ghost since you
[5:21] believe that's right have you receive
[5:24] the Holy Ghost sent you
[5:25] believe amen now he said we not know
[5:29] where there be any Holy Ghost then he
[5:30] said unto what was you
[5:32] baptized they said we've already been
[5:34] baptized for the man that baptized the
[5:36] Lord Jesus Christ we've been baptized
[5:38] under John's baptism same hole of water
[5:40] perhaps the same man Paul said that
[5:41] won't work he only baptized unto
[5:45] repentance not for remission of
[5:47] sins that's some of you wondess people
[5:49] come around and baptize that wrong you
[5:52] baptize that un far salvation water
[5:55] don't save a man it's the blood
[5:58] repentance not to baptism of you
[6:00] regeneration no sir regeneration comes
[6:02] by the spirit baptism is a is a outward
[6:05] expression of the inward work of
[6:06] regeneration has been done see all right
[6:10] notice he said have you received the
[6:11] Holy Ghost s you believe they said he
[6:13] said we not know where there be ho ghost
[6:15] He said how was you baptized said we've
[6:17] been baptized under John he said John
[6:19] barely baptized unto
[6:22] repentance unto repentance saying if you
[6:25] should believe on him the land the
[6:26] sacrific was to come on the Lord Jesus
[6:28] Christ and when they heard heard this
[6:30] they were re-baptized again in the name
[6:33] of Jesus Christ and Paul laid his hands
[6:35] on them and they received the Holy Ghost
[6:36] and spoke in tongues and
[6:39] prophesy tell me that's not scripture
[6:42] and show me anywh anybody's ever
[6:43] baptized any other way in the New
[6:45] Testament but the name of the Lord Jesus
[6:47] Christ show me St acus and many others
[6:50] who was baptized W down until the time
[6:52] of the of the of the Ning Council and
[6:55] every one of them was baptized in the
[6:56] name of Jesus Christ the missionaries
[6:58] kill the fields with the name of Jesus
[7:00] Christ but when the N seeing counsil
[7:02] come they had to have three gods they
[7:04] took down Paul or Tu down Juniper and
[7:06] put up Paul they took down Venus and put
[7:09] up Mary they had all kinds of gods all
[7:11] kinds of saints and everything else they
[7:12] made a tri baptism and fed it to the
[7:15] Protestants and they still GTH it down
[7:18] but the evening lights has come now the
[7:21] prophet said it'll be light in the
[7:22] evening
[7:23] time there it'll be light in the evening
[7:27] time the path to Glory GL you will
[7:30] surely find in the Waterway that's the
[7:33] light today buried in the precious name
[7:37] of Jesus young and old repent of all
[7:39] your sins the Holy Ghost will surely
[7:42] enter in the evening lights have come it
[7:45] is the fact that God and Christ are
[7:49] one Hallelujah you believe it Peter said
[7:52] on the de Pentecost let this be knowto
[7:54] you the house of Israel that God's made
[7:56] the same Jesus who you crucified both
[7:59] Lord and
[8:00] Christ 16th verse of the second chapter
[8:04] yet God's made the same Jesus who
[8:06] crucified both Lord and Christ that all
[8:09] the house of Israel know surely talked
[8:11] to a Jew not long ago up here at the
[8:13] house of David he said you Gentiles
[8:15] can't cut God in three parts and giveing
[8:17] to a Jew we know better than that I said
[8:19] that's just it Rabbi we don't cut God no
[8:22] three
[8:23] parts I said Do you believe the prophets
[8:25] he said certainly I said um um Do You
[8:28] Believe Isaiah 9:6 he said yes I said
[8:30] who is the prophet speaking of Messiah I
[8:33] said What relation will Messiah be to
[8:35] God he said he will be God I said that's
[8:37] right amen there you are so you can't
[8:40] cut him in three parts if you
[8:41] missionaries here one of is going here
[8:43] to the Jews I this man sitting here well
[8:44] Sheri give God that you know Father Son
[8:46] and Holy Ghost he'll tell you right
[8:48] quick he know where it come from the I
[8:49] seeing counsel he won't listen to that
[8:51] but you let him see where the God was
[8:53] made flesh and he is the only God there
[8:55] is God made flesh in human form and
[8:58] lived among us to sanctify
[9:00] take away that he himself might come in
[9:01] the form of the Holy Ghost God the
[9:03] Father Holy Ghost is the same person the
[9:05] Bible said in the geologies of Jesus
[9:08] Christ in the first chapter of Matthew
[9:09] it said Abraham begot Isaac Isaac beg
[9:12] got Jacob on down said and then uh and
[9:16] how me you read it now you know just
[9:17] what I'm talking
[9:19] about Matthew the first chapter and
[9:24] we'll now let's begin at the 18th verse
[9:27] now the birth of Jesus Christ is on this
[9:29] WI when his mother Mary was exposed to
[9:31] Joseph before they came together she was
[9:33] found with a child of God the Father
[9:36] does that read that
[9:38] way found the child with who
[9:41] the I thought God the father was his
[9:44] father and God the father and the Holy
[9:46] Ghost is the Same Spirit who had two
[9:50] fathers then Joseph her husband being a
[9:52] just man not willingly make her public
[9:54] example was minded to put her away
[9:55] privately but while he thought on these
[9:57] things behold the angel of Lord appeared
[9:58] to him in saying Joseph thou son of
[10:01] David fear not taken thee marry thy wife
[10:02] for that which is conceived in her is of
[10:05] the God the father huh the Holy
[10:08] Ghost then who was the father of Jesus
[10:10] Christ the Holy Ghost what is that in
[10:13] you well that's God the Father too isn't
[10:16] sure and she shall bring forth a son and
[10:19] thou shalt call his
[10:20] name Jesus here's God the Father here's
[10:24] God the Holy Ghost here's God the son
[10:26] see that's three Gods the Bible said
[10:29] this two has to be the same or he had
[10:31] two
[10:32] fathers see you can't have two fathers
[10:35] you know that now she shall bring forth
[10:37] a son and they shall call his name Jesus
[10:39] for he shall save his people from their
[10:41] sins now this is all done that it might
[10:43] be fulfilled which is spoke by the Lord
[10:45] by the prophet saying a virgin shall be
[10:48] with child and shall bring forth the son
[10:50] and they shall call his name Emmanuel
[10:52] which is by interpretation God With Us
[10:56] that's the first chapter of Matthew
[10:57] Matthew 28:19 where Jesus go baptized in
[11:00] the name of father son Holy Ghost what
[11:01] is the name of the father son Holy Ghost
[11:03] Jesus Christ of course you read a love

[16:02] ninth verse listen close now he's
[16:04] speaking of the
[16:07] coming Zechariah 12 and we begin at the
[16:10] N the ninth
[16:11] verse and it shall come to pass
[16:14] Zechariah prophesying 487 years before
[16:17] the coming of Christ and it shall come
[16:19] to pass in that day that I will seek to
[16:22] destroy all nations that come against
[16:25] Jerusalem think of it and I will pour
[16:29] out upon the House of David and upon the
[16:32] inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of
[16:34] Grace and of supplications and they
[16:37] shall look upon me whom they have
[16:41] pierced now when's the gospel returning
[16:44] to the Jews when the day of the Gentile
[16:46] is finished the gospel is ready to go to
[16:48] the Jews oh I could I could just for
[16:52] tell you a little something it's fixing
[16:53] to happen right here see right in this
[16:55] day see it's fixing to happen we get in
[16:57] the church age and this great thing is
[17:00] fixing to happen will carry over to
[17:02] Revelations 11 and pick up those two
[17:04] prophets Elijah and Moses returning back
[17:06] again for the Jews we're ready for it
[17:09] everything's set in order just ready
[17:11] this Gentile message as the Jews brought
[17:14] it to the Gentiles the Gentiles will
[17:16] take it right back to the Jews again and
[17:18] the Rapture will come now remember this
[17:21] year coming after the tribulation the
[17:23] church does not go through the
[17:25] tribulation we know that the Bible says
[17:27] that see all right now he'll pour out
[17:30] upon the house of Israel why the same
[17:32] Holy Spirit see after the Gentile church
[17:35] is gone and they look upon me whom they
[17:38] have pierced and they shall mourn for
[17:42] him as one that mourneth for his only
[17:44] son and shall be in bitterness for him
[17:49] as one that is in bitterness for his
[17:52] first born and in that day shall there
[17:55] be great mourning in Jerusalem and
[17:57] mourning and and the valley of mol and
[18:01] uh and the land shall mourn every family
[18:05] apart the family of the House of David
[18:07] apart and the family of the House of
[18:10] Nathan apart and each one of the houses
[18:12] apart when they see what will happen
[18:15] what will take place when he comes in
[18:18] the Clouds Of Glory at his second
[18:20] appearing and when those Jews who pierce
[18:23] the you know another scripture says
[18:25] they'll ask him where did he get these
[18:27] wounds he said in the House of my
[18:29] friends and not only will it be a
[18:32] mournful time for the Jews who rejected
[18:36] him as Messiah but it'll be a mournful
[18:38] time for them left Gentiles back here
[18:40] who has accepted who has rejected him as
[18:43] their Messiah of their faith they'll be
[18:45] wailing and weeping the sleeping virgin
[18:49] will be wailing that's that church that
[18:51] refused to get orl in its life there was
[18:54] 10 virgins went out all good people but
[18:57] five of them had all in their land the
[19:00] other five were good people good people
[19:03] but failed to get orl in their land and
[19:06] they were cast out into outer Darkness
[19:08] where there be weeping wailing and
[19:09] nashing of teeth here it is they'll be
[19:12] wailing the Bible said here they'll be
[19:14] wailing and so
[19:17] brokenhearted until even here I'll give
[19:19] you another Genesis 45 if you want to
[19:21] get to that let's get to it just a
[19:23] moment and read that also in Genesis the
[19:25] I believe the 45th chapter of Genesis
[19:28] I'd like to get this here Joseph making
[19:31] himself known to his to his people and
[19:33] we'll get this just show the the types
[19:36] of what will take place in that day now
[19:39] we bind together then Joseph could not
[19:42] refrain himself before them that stood
[19:46] by him and he cried cause every man to
[19:49] go from me now remember Joseph making
[19:52] his KN he cried every man go from before
[19:55] me and there stood no man with him while
[19:58] Joseph
[19:59] made himself known to his Brethren and
[20:01] he wept
[20:03] aloud and the Egyptians and the House of
[20:06] Pho H him he must have screamed out
[20:09] Joseph said un to his Brethren I am
[20:12] Joseph does my father yet live and his
[20:15] brother could not answer him for it they
[20:17] were troubled at his
[20:20] presence and Joseph said unto his
[20:23] Brethren come near me I pray you and
[20:26] they came near and he said I am Joseph
[20:29] your brethren who you who you sold into
[20:32] Egypt now therefore do not be grieved
[20:34] nor angry with yourselves that you have
[20:37] sold me hither for God did send me
[20:41] before you to preserve life oh how
[20:43] beautiful for these two years has famine
[20:46] been in the land and in which shall be
[20:51] there shall be neither be ear no Harvest
[20:54] and God sent me before you to preserve
[20:57] you a osty in the earth and to save your
[21:02] lives by great Deliverance let me just
[21:05] take now compare that with Zachariah the
[21:07] 12th just for a
[21:09] moment now we know that in type if you
[21:12] teach types then you always get it right
[21:14] I think in type now Joseph when he was
[21:17] born he was hated by his Brethren is
[21:21] that right I want to show you Joseph
[21:23] represents the spirit filled Church
[21:25] Joseph was hated of his Brethren why
[21:28] because he was
[21:30] spiritual Joseph could not help because
[21:33] he could see
[21:34] Vision he could not help because he
[21:37] dreamed dreams see and could interpret
[21:40] dreams that was what was in him he could
[21:43] not display anything else of what that
[21:46] was in
[21:47] him well then his brothers hated him
[21:50] without a cause but his father loved him
[21:53] because his father was a
[21:55] prophet see how it was with Jesus God
[21:58] loved his son but the Brethren the
[22:00] Pharisees and Sadducees hated him
[22:03] because he could heal the sick and
[22:05] foretell things and see Visions inter
[22:07] interpret see what I mean they hatte him
[22:10] without a cause and what did they do to

[1:08:08] opportunity to be here with you we have
[1:08:12] um a scripture reading uh that we'd like
[1:08:14] to go to found we got three places I
[1:08:19] believe in uh Psalms 31 Ephesians
[1:08:23] chapter 6 and then also we'll take a
[1:08:27] scripture in
[1:08:30] Exodus I'll give you I'll quote those
[1:08:35] again we'll
[1:08:52] take Psalms 131
[1:09:34] excuse me just for a
[1:09:41] moment actually before we read our
[1:09:43] scripture in Psalms let's take uh
[1:09:46] Genesis chapter 4 okay
[1:10:08] when you have that you can say
[1:10:22] Amen in verse number three
[1:10:26] and in process of time it came to pass
[1:10:29] that Cain brought of the fruit of the
[1:10:31] ground an offering unto the Lord and
[1:10:35] Abel he also brought of the firstling of
[1:10:37] his flock and of the fat thereof and the
[1:10:40] Lord had respect unto Abel and to his
[1:10:44] offering but unto Cain and to his
[1:10:46] offering he had not respect and King was
[1:10:51] very wroth and his countenance fell am
[1:10:54] man we'll take one more scripture in
[1:10:56] Exodus chapter
[1:10:57] [Music]
[1:11:11] 2 in verse number
[1:11:20] 23 and it came to pass in process of
[1:11:23] time that the king of Egypt died and the
[1:11:27] children of Israel sighed by reason of
[1:11:30] the bondage and they cried and their Cry
[1:11:32] came up unto God by reason of the
[1:11:36] bondage and God heard their groaning and
[1:11:39] God remembered his Covenant with Abraham
[1:11:42] with Isaac and with Jacob and God looked
[1:11:45] upon the children of Israel and God had
[1:11:48] respect unto them amen we'll take one uh
[1:11:53] final scripture over in Psalms it's
[1:11:54] psalm 105 is that is the one that we
[1:11:57] want to read
[1:12:10] from verse number 15
[1:12:29] we'll start with
[1:12:31] verse
[1:12:32] number 11 saying unto thee will I give
[1:12:37] the land of Canaan the lot of your
[1:12:40] inheritance when they were but a few men
[1:12:43] in number yay very few and strangers in
[1:12:47] it when they went from one nation to
[1:12:50] another from one Kingdom to another he
[1:12:53] suffered no man to do them wrong
[1:12:55] yeah he reproved Kings for their sakes
[1:12:59] saying touch not my anointed do my
[1:13:02] prophets no harm moreover he called for
[1:13:05] a famine upon the land he break the
[1:13:08] whole staff of bread he sent a man
[1:13:11] before them even Joseph who was sold for
[1:13:15] a servant amen we're going to take um
[1:13:22] this this um
[1:13:27] portion of the scripture and um speak on
[1:13:32] respects we'll speak on respects just
[1:13:34] for a moment so let's let's go back to
[1:13:36] Psalm
[1:13:37] 105 um and verse number one and it says
[1:13:41] oh give thanks unto the Lord call upon
[1:13:44] his name make known his deeds among the
[1:13:47] People Sing unto him sing Psalms unto
[1:13:52] him talk of all his wonderous Works

[1:13:58] of them Rejoice that seek the Lord seek
[1:14:02] the Lord and his strength seek his face

[1:14:27] which he commanded to a thousand
[1:14:29] Generations which Covenant he made with
[1:14:31] Abraham and his oath unto Isaac and
[1:14:35] confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law
[1:14:38] and to Israel for Everlasting Covenant
[1:14:41] saying unto thee will I give the land of
[1:14:44] Canaan the lot of your inher
[1:14:47] inheritance we repeat that verse 12
[1:14:50] again when they were but a few men in
[1:14:51] number yay very few strangers and in it
[1:14:55] when they went from one nation to
[1:14:57] another from one Kingdom to another
[1:14:59] people he suffered no man to do them
[1:15:02] wrong yay he reprove Kings for their
[1:15:06] sake saying touch not my anointed do my
[1:15:09] prophets no harm amen let us pray Lord
[1:15:13] Jesus we ask your blessings on the
[1:15:15] reading of your word this morning I pray
[1:15:18] you help us Lord to deliver uh what you
[1:15:21] want us to say and the way you want us
[1:15:24] to say it in uh Lord the time that
[1:15:27] you've given to us we want to thank you
[1:15:30] Lord we do not take it lightly we
[1:15:33] appreciate it father and we're uh
[1:15:35] depending on you to speak to our hearts
[1:15:38] as you've always done in such a loving
[1:15:41] way in a way that would be edifying to
[1:15:44] us that when we leave from here we' be
[1:15:46] better Christians better men better
[1:15:48] women better young people it's our
[1:15:51] prayer it's our great desire in jesus'
[1:15:53] name we pray
[1:15:55] amen God bless you you may be seated now
[1:15:59] we certainly thank the Lord for the
[1:16:00] meetings we've had and we've gotten
[1:16:03] through those meetings and I know it was
[1:16:06] a lot of work hard work and we want to
[1:16:08] thank you Believers
[1:16:10] for um the deacons trustees boards and
[1:16:13] the sisters and just each one that did
[1:16:17] their part and we certainly appreciate
[1:16:19] that and we've been enjoying that still
[1:16:22] feasting on that and um I I was teasing
[1:16:25] with someone about the special meetings
[1:16:27] and then I've had several meetings with
[1:16:30] I think with everyone on the board and
[1:16:32] different families and so forth and
[1:16:35] really those are the special meetings I
[1:16:37] guess meetings after the meetings you
[1:16:40] know you have to meet and talk and deal
[1:16:42] and so we thank the Lord amen so on this
[1:16:46] little message respects it's such a vast
[1:16:49] topic and I don't know how many services
[1:16:52] will take to go into it but it seems
[1:16:56] like we can't even get out of the book
[1:16:59] of Ephesians because Ephesians chapter 6
[1:17:02] as the little kids did their play on put
[1:17:05] on the whole armor of God and that whole
[1:17:08] uh equipment um just before that it kind
[1:17:12] of deals with the
[1:17:14] preparation of putting on the whole
[1:17:16] armor of God so let's just turn there
[1:17:18] quickly we've been there for many
[1:17:21] services in Ephesians chapter
[1:17:23] 6 and I trust it'll be a blessing to
[1:17:27] you as I was approaching this subject I
[1:17:30] come back into Ephesians chapter 6 and
[1:17:33] we know that we put on the whole armor
[1:17:37] of God which is the word of God but I
[1:17:39] like this in
[1:17:42] verse number five it says
[1:17:46] servants you have that there you say
[1:17:49] Amen if you got it yeah servants be
[1:17:52] obedient to them that are your master
[1:17:55] according to the flesh which Fear With
[1:17:58] Fear and Trembling and singleness of
[1:18:01] your heart as unto Christ not with eye
[1:18:05] Service as men Pleasers but as the
[1:18:08] Servants of Christ doing the will of God
[1:18:11] from the heart with Good Will doing
[1:18:14] Service as to the Lord and what not to
[1:18:19] men knowing that whatsoever good thing
[1:18:22] any man doeth the same shall
[1:18:26] what he shall receive of the Lord
[1:18:30] whether he be Bond or free and your
[1:18:33] Masters do the same things unto them
[1:18:35] forbearing threatening knowing that your
[1:18:37] master also is in heaven neither is
[1:18:41] there respect of persons with
[1:18:45] him
[1:18:47] now this subject of respect or Godly
[1:18:51] fear um is something that it's all
[1:18:56] throughout the scriptures and I and it's
[1:18:58] very notable in the laws that the Lord
[1:19:02] made it very very clear his attitude
[1:19:06] towards uh respecting persons in
[1:19:10] judgment a good friend and you all know
[1:19:12] him brother banza he's from this from
[1:19:15] Congo Africa and then this latter years
[1:19:19] as a refugee into Rwanda because of wars
[1:19:22] and fightings and so forth
[1:19:25] and he is s of appreciative of being an
[1:19:28] American citizen in fact when we went to
[1:19:31] his wedding he he he took us up to the
[1:19:34] front this large wedding all these
[1:19:37] Africans and people from all over and he
[1:19:39] says I thank God God Bless
[1:19:42] America I was like well brother bonso I
[1:19:44] don't want to get that started
[1:19:47] here and so he was just showing his
[1:19:50] appreciation to the freedoms and the
[1:19:53] laws that we have and he shared with us
[1:19:56] many times that if a poor man is abused
[1:20:00] or any hurt or anything taken from him
[1:20:04] and he goes to the police and he's
[1:20:07] abused a from a rich man and he goes to
[1:20:10] the police is very seldom is very uh
[1:20:14] very often that he would get arrested
[1:20:17] for bringing such an accusation to a
[1:20:20] wealthy man or a man in power so the
[1:20:24] rule of law isn't just if you have money
[1:20:30] if you have position or power um you can
[1:20:34] get by and do things that maybe the
[1:20:37] other guy wouldn't do and the Lord
[1:20:38] didn't want this established and it's
[1:20:40] all through the scriptures have not
[1:20:42] respective
[1:20:43] persons um God doesn't have respective
[1:20:46] persons and that we are not to have
[1:20:48] respective persons in judgment and it's
[1:20:52] a human flaw and so so this is part of
[1:20:55] the problem with race issues that one
[1:21:00] race thinks they're better than the next
[1:21:03] race or one nation than the other one
[1:21:05] and you just pull out your Globe every
[1:21:08] continent on the globe has these
[1:21:10] problems they're a human problem and God
[1:21:14] makes men and then men wants to rule
[1:21:17] over men and they create these statuses
[1:21:20] and who's more important than the other
[1:21:23] we'll do it with gifts we'll do it with
[1:21:24] talents we do it with anything that we
[1:21:27] have we'll start measuring how much
[1:21:29] money did you make and how much are you
[1:21:32] getting for this job and then we start
[1:21:34] flexing it's a human flaw human problem
[1:21:37] the disciples had that issue it's
[1:21:39] through the scriptures and the Lord
[1:21:41] deals with it in Deuteronomy I'll start
[1:21:46] in uh in
[1:21:49] Leviticus ye verse 15 Leviticus 19:15
[1:21:53] I'll quote some scriptures and he says
[1:21:55] ye shall do no unrighteousness in
[1:21:58] judgment Thou shalt not respect the
[1:22:01] person of the poor nor honor the person
[1:22:04] of the mighty but in righteousness shalt
[1:22:08] thou judge Thy Neighbor Thou shalt not
[1:22:12] go up and down as a tail Bearer among
[1:22:16] thy people neither shalt thou stand
[1:22:19] against the blood of thy neighbor I am
[1:22:22] the Lord now that tail Bearer
[1:22:25] my my we got to chase that one down but
[1:22:27] we don't have time to do that this
[1:22:29] Whispers and people who talk we call it
[1:22:32] gospel uh uh
[1:22:34] gossiping uh the Hispanics might say
[1:22:38] chismosos this
[1:22:40] little just talking and and it's a human
[1:22:43] it's a human thing Leviticus 26: 3 and
[1:22:47] 12 says this here if you walk in my
[1:22:50] statutes keep my Commandments and do
[1:22:53] them then when I give you rain in due
[1:22:55] season your land will will yield her
[1:22:58] increase the Trees of the field shall
[1:23:00] yield their fruit your threshing shall
[1:23:02] reach unto the Vintage and the Vintage
[1:23:05] reach unto the sewing time he's talking
[1:23:07] about how you'll be abundantly blessed
[1:23:09] and how you'll begin to increase and
[1:23:11] even the rain and even your plants and
[1:23:13] your Harvest if you do and keep my
[1:23:16] Commandments verse 6 and I will give
[1:23:18] peace in the land and ye shall lie down
[1:23:21] and none of you shall make no one shall
[1:23:23] make you afraid I will rid the evil
[1:23:26] Beast out of the land neither shall the
[1:23:28] sword go through your land ye shall
[1:23:30] Chase your enemies and they shall fall
[1:23:33] Before You by The Sword five of you
[1:23:36] shall chase a hundred and a 100 of you
[1:23:38] shall put 10,000 to
[1:23:41] flight and your enemies shall fall
[1:23:44] Before You by The Sword for I will have
[1:23:47] respect unto you and make you fruitful
[1:23:51] and multiply you and establish Lish my
[1:23:54] Covenant with you and you shall eat of
[1:23:57] the old store and bring forth uh the old
[1:24:00] because of the new and I will set my
[1:24:02] Tabernacle among you and my soul shall
[1:24:05] not abore you and the scriptures go on
[1:24:08] so this is talking about if you keep the
[1:24:10] laws you keep my statutes that I will
[1:24:14] have re this is who we want to respect
[1:24:17] us is the
[1:24:19] Lord and many times we feel
[1:24:23] disrespected from our brother or our
[1:24:25] sister or someone disrespected my kids
[1:24:29] they disrespected my office and really
[1:24:32] that's going to happen but I shouldn't
[1:24:34] be looking for you or craving or needing
[1:24:38] respect from you be great will be nice
[1:24:41] but really my desire for respect should
[1:24:44] come from the Lord if the Lord will
[1:24:47] respect me then that's all I need I'm
[1:24:50] good I'll be good for the rest of my
[1:24:53] life if I can get the Lord respect when
[1:24:56] Abel and Cain came forth to bring forth
[1:24:59] their offering Abel did something and
[1:25:02] the Bible says that the Lord had respect
[1:25:05] unto his offering and when the Lord
[1:25:07] respected him the Lord Vindicated him
[1:25:11] isn't that what we all desire you know
[1:25:13] it' be great for every one of us to
[1:25:15] respect one another like we should but
[1:25:17] that's not going to always happen I'm a
[1:25:19] man you're a man we're flesh but don't
[1:25:21] you really desire the Lord to respect
[1:25:24] your prayer respect your cry respect
[1:25:29] your offering I'm giving this to you you
[1:25:31] know the Lord is still looking at what
[1:25:33] we come to give the Bible says that he
[1:25:36] stood back and he watched them giving in
[1:25:39] the offering the Widow and the great and
[1:25:42] they all and he watched them and he saw
[1:25:45] what she gave and she gave more than
[1:25:47] them all it had nothing to do with the
[1:25:50] amount he saw what she was giving from
[1:25:53] from her heart and the Lord is still
[1:25:55] looking at our offering today and we
[1:25:57] want the Lord to respect our offering so
[1:26:02] he respect our giving and respect what
[1:26:04] we do he looked at Israel he had respect
[1:26:08] unto them because of Abraham he looked
[1:26:10] at them he says if you keep my laws I
[1:26:13] will respect you if God respects you how
[1:26:16] are you not going to be blessed no
[1:26:19] matter who doesn't like you or
[1:26:21] acknowledge you they might not know who
[1:26:23] you are now it don't matter
[1:26:25] he he knows who you are he's got you
[1:26:29] covered you're not going to lose if the
[1:26:32] Lord respect you and this is really the
[1:26:35] desire that we have for
[1:26:40] eyes you know everyone wants someone
[1:26:43] looking at them looking up to them in
[1:26:48] respect but we want the Lord's eyes upon
[1:26:51] what we're doing and he looks upon our
[1:26:54] heart and he looks at our our our goals
[1:26:58] and our achieve he looks at our motives
[1:27:00] and our objectives and sometimes
[1:27:03] outwardly we might look a certain way to
[1:27:05] other people but really our heart is
[1:27:08] what the Lord sees and this um is
[1:27:12] followed in Deuteronomy 1: 8-18 just
[1:27:16] showing you that the Lord is
[1:27:18] establishing to his people not to have
[1:27:21] respect of persons in judgment don't
[1:27:23] look get people on the outside and judge
[1:27:27] them based on that can I get a witness
[1:27:29] this
[1:27:30] morning behold I have set the land
[1:27:32] before you go in and possess the land
[1:27:35] which the Lord swear unto your fathers
[1:27:38] Deuteronomy 1 verses
[1:27:41] 8-8 Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give unto
[1:27:45] them and to their seed after them I
[1:27:47] spake unto you at that time saying I am
[1:27:50] not able to Bear you myself alone the
[1:27:53] Lord your God hath multiplied you and
[1:27:57] behold you are this day as the stars of
[1:28:00] Heaven for multitude the Lord God of
[1:28:03] your fathers make you a thousand times
[1:28:07] so many more as you are and bless you as
[1:28:11] he hath promised you so that's a
[1:28:14] different time in the scripture than in
[1:28:18] Psalms where we read in Psalms 105
[1:28:21] remember Psalms 105 says says that when
[1:28:25] you were few in number you're just a
[1:28:28] small group we didn't even know who you
[1:28:30] are as a nation you weren't on the map
[1:28:33] you're not very important but how
[1:28:36] important is Israel today how important
[1:28:39] is that Nation today the reason why we
[1:28:42] got the Bible today is because of that
[1:28:44] Nation the Old Testament writings how
[1:28:46] important but it started out just like a
[1:28:48] little bitty number of people but he
[1:28:50] says I will multiply you now that m
[1:28:54] multiplication started when they were in
[1:28:57] bondage in
[1:28:58] Egypt remember the Lord blessed them and
[1:29:01] they started having so many and then
[1:29:02] they started trying to put a tally on
[1:29:05] they wanted to to kill the men and save
[1:29:08] the women children under this bondage
[1:29:11] but the Lord be to increase them and but
[1:29:15] before that he says when you were few in
[1:29:19] number I rebuke Nations for you I
[1:29:23] brought down Kings for you when you were
[1:29:27] few in number when you had nothing when
[1:29:30] you were nobody no name at all but when
[1:29:34] God respects you and God respects
[1:29:37] respected Israel he gave them a name and
[1:29:40] a nation one of the most gifted and
[1:29:43] talented Nations on the earth their
[1:29:47] talents their gifts that they are their
[1:29:50] musical talents their intellectual
[1:29:52] talents the way the Lord has bless that
[1:29:56] Nation because he had respect unto them
[1:29:59] and this is the respect that we all
[1:30:03] desire we all long for God to respect us
[1:30:10] now
[1:30:16] um the scriptures and the quotes that I
[1:30:18] would read to you your mom or dad or
[1:30:21] your favorite preacher or whoever or
[1:30:23] listening to it tape to the tape that we
[1:30:26] would read to you and labor and lay out
[1:30:29] to you was only one part of you moving
[1:30:33] into what God would want you to be
[1:30:36] that's only one part reading the
[1:30:38] scriptures reading the quote playing the
[1:30:40] tape does not change you that's a start
[1:30:44] to the change but God has to do a work
[1:30:47] in you and make those words your words
[1:30:52] those scriptures become yours when you
[1:30:55] embrace the truth that you're hearing
[1:30:58] and it becomes yours then that's when it
[1:31:01] happens the Bible says that um he that
[1:31:05] heareth my words and Believe on me hath
[1:31:09] ever lasting light go out on the street
[1:31:11] do you believe on the Lord Jesus yeah I
[1:31:12] believe um and uh you believe he's
[1:31:15] raised from the dead oh yeah I believe
[1:31:17] does he have everlasting life eternal
[1:31:19] life well no he that heareth my words
[1:31:23] and believeth on him he that confesses
[1:31:25] with his mouth and believe uh in his
[1:31:29] heart he shall be saved it's not just
[1:31:31] confessing you got to believe in your
[1:31:32] heart I can teach a a parent I can teach
[1:31:35] any child or anyone to say I believe
[1:31:39] that Jesus is the son of God it doesn't
[1:31:42] mean they have eternal life doesn't mean
[1:31:45] that there's any change there the change
[1:31:47] happens when you receive it into your
[1:31:50] heart and I love something one of the
[1:31:53] ministers said during our meetings and
[1:31:55] I'll read that it's in a a quotation is
[1:31:58] brother brandham is referring to the
[1:32:02] children or after the resurrection when
[1:32:05] Jesus meets with his disciples on the
[1:32:09] road to
[1:32:10] emus and he
[1:32:12] is um talking to them and after all that
[1:32:17] the three years of him being there his
[1:32:19] ministry teaching seeing the signs and
[1:32:22] wonders it still wasn't enough enough
[1:32:24] for them something else had to happen in
[1:32:27] their life and he says this in the
[1:32:29] message when their eyes were open they
[1:32:32] knew him paragraph number
[1:32:36] 70 the prophet of God says this here now
[1:32:39] we notice again how he made himself
[1:32:42] known to them after he got in how did he
[1:32:46] do it he opened their eyes to see who he
[1:32:49] was when he got into them then he opened
[1:32:53] their eyes eyes to see now when the word
[1:32:56] comes into
[1:32:58] you when you accept God's word and it
[1:33:02] comes into you then the promise of that
[1:33:06] promise that you've accepted manifests
[1:33:10] itself then you know who it is by what
[1:33:14] did he do how did he make himself known
[1:33:17] to them because he did the same things
[1:33:20] he did before his crucifixion then they
[1:33:22] know that that that was him because he
[1:33:25] had raised from the dead all the
[1:33:27] preaching all the teaching and
[1:33:30] everything else he had done had
[1:33:33] failed but when he revealed himself
[1:33:37] doing the same thing he did before his
[1:33:40] crucifixion they knew it was him it
[1:33:44] opened their
[1:33:45] eyes amen so the opening of the eyes is
[1:33:49] what we want to take place in any
[1:33:51] service and that might happen one CE or
[1:33:54] twice or three it might be throughout
[1:33:55] the whole service you just want it to
[1:33:57] happen to you you can't catch everything
[1:34:01] but catch something Lord give me
[1:34:05] something a word something that I didn't
[1:34:08] have before open my eyes to this truth
[1:34:12] so he says all of the preaching all of
[1:34:15] the teaching that he had given before
[1:34:18] we're talking about the Lord Jesus all
[1:34:20] the preaching all the teaching it all
[1:34:23] fail failed until their eyes were open
[1:34:26] it's these eye openening moments of the
[1:34:30] service song service of your prayer
[1:34:33] closet of your take time of your Bible
[1:34:36] reading it's those eye openening moments
[1:34:39] that really make the difference in your
[1:34:41] life that's the Revelation that we all
[1:34:43] long for
[1:34:45] amen and so he deals with that so you
[1:34:51] know bringing these together I took a
[1:34:53] few m messages back on Divine love here
[1:34:55] some time ago we went through the
[1:34:58] messages on conduct order and Doctrine
[1:35:00] several Wednesdays on it and I got a lot
[1:35:03] of good comments from some some people
[1:35:05] and their fire was on and the the quotes
[1:35:08] were there it's like wow that's exciting
[1:35:10] but then you if you don't if you're not
[1:35:12] careful you'll Retreat you'll go back
[1:35:14] into some behaviors that's contrary to
[1:35:17] to the
[1:35:18] tapes contrary to the
[1:35:21] teaching because it needs to open up in
[1:35:24] your heart in your eyes and when that
[1:35:27] when that happens then you'll begin to
[1:35:30] do these things by Revelation
[1:35:33] now as I said I I know there's a number
[1:35:37] of messages that can come from this I
[1:35:40] don't know how many I'll do I know I got
[1:35:43] at least three sermons that I want to
[1:35:47] address in some of this because there
[1:35:49] there's so much on this respects and as
[1:35:54] you take the tape the message respects
[1:35:56] and listen to it brother
[1:35:59] brandham really breaks it down in
[1:36:03] examples of how different groups had
[1:36:07] disrespected the Lord he says when you
[1:36:10] disrespect the servant you dis you're
[1:36:13] actually disrespecting God when they
[1:36:15] disrespected Samuel or or Saul Samuel
[1:36:18] the prophet they were actually rejecting
[1:36:21] God when they did it gives the example
[1:36:24] of Elisha when those children started
[1:36:28] teasing him because of his bald
[1:36:31] head and you know it was like you know I
[1:36:35] if if if brother random identified a
[1:36:38] spirit for America it's it's the hahaa
[1:36:41] spirit it's a joking playing
[1:36:45] teasing I'm from that cloth I'm from a
[1:36:48] large family and either you laugh or you
[1:36:51] cry or you fight or something you're
[1:36:55] twisted and you need to be
[1:36:57] untwisted in a sense you know I have a
[1:36:59] loving family but you know we had our we
[1:37:02] had our spaces that you had to carve out
[1:37:04] your little space or somebody's going to
[1:37:06] eat eat your
[1:37:09] portion and you survive and God makes
[1:37:12] you that way for whatever purpose and
[1:37:14] you single single you know single child
[1:37:18] homes you have your challenges too
[1:37:20] everybody had their challenges all right
[1:37:22] the the the kid that don't didn't have
[1:37:24] any brothers or sisters wish they had a
[1:37:26] brother wish they had a sister and I
[1:37:28] always wish I had my own room and today
[1:37:31] I don't have my own
[1:37:34] room maybe on the other side I'll get my
[1:37:37] own
[1:37:39] room God bless you amen so but he was
[1:37:43] talking about those children how they
[1:37:47] disrespected um Elisha because his head
[1:37:50] was bald and what I was saying about you
[1:37:52] know the hahaa and the joking you know
[1:37:54] you got to be real careful because the
[1:37:56] scriptures are talking about this
[1:37:57] jessing and joking and I and I I've done
[1:38:00] it many times I'll tease and joke and
[1:38:03] I've heard others tease and joke about
[1:38:05] the third pool and how you make an
[1:38:08] example you know this person they're
[1:38:10] going through the third pool of their
[1:38:13] you know their pity party and will laugh
[1:38:16] and joke and say things like that but
[1:38:18] you know I really don't think those are
[1:38:20] subjects that are that we should be
[1:38:22] playing with it's not funny those are
[1:38:25] serious sacred truths it's so sacred
[1:38:28] that if Satan can get a hold of it he'
[1:38:30] do great damage but because we play and
[1:38:32] joke and laugh so much we can find
[1:38:35] ourselves joking and playing because
[1:38:38] it's so common with us over things that
[1:38:42] really should be sacred so Lord help me
[1:38:46] not to take these quotations of the
[1:38:48] message and knowing God has a sense of
[1:38:51] humor there's an appropriate place for
[1:38:54] humor but then there are things that you
[1:38:56] should we just shouldn't play with we
[1:38:57] got something else we can laugh at we
[1:39:00] don't need to use something sacred so we
[1:39:03] can laugh at for the expense of of
[1:39:08] getting a joke being funny getting the
[1:39:11] attention on ourselves so brother vam
[1:39:14] deals with that Elisha and what he
[1:39:17] taught us was that in the home those
[1:39:21] parents spoke against Elisha so the
[1:39:25] children now had a disrespect towards
[1:39:28] him and it wouldn't be you I mean you it
[1:39:32] doesn't seem like it was a a disrespect
[1:39:34] like they called him a bad name or sore
[1:39:37] at him or threw a rock at him they just
[1:39:40] said go up thou Baldhead and they
[1:39:43] laughed and he cursed them in the name
[1:39:46] of the Lord and the sheers came and uh
[1:39:51] devoured him and brother R says that
[1:39:54] wasn't the action of the holy spirit
[1:39:57] that was the false or in the the bad
[1:40:00] teaching he says those children when
[1:40:02] they saw Elisha even though they didn't
[1:40:05] agree with him they should have said God
[1:40:08] bless you man of God and just let it Let
[1:40:10] It Go like that or don't say nothing at
[1:40:12] all it's better don't say nothing at all
[1:40:17] if say it's something you don't
[1:40:18] understand that's that's the better way
[1:40:21] but in the message uh being led of the
[1:40:24] Holy Spirit brother bham says this here
[1:40:27] 1956 he says paragraph number 38 and
[1:40:29] today that's today that's the thing
[1:40:32] today we see people people are so
[1:40:35] subject in this day to jumping at little
[1:40:37] flowery things till it makes you kind of
[1:40:40] wonder sometimes don't never think above
[1:40:44] one man above
[1:40:46] another no sir no matter who he is if
[1:40:51] he's just a little fellow out here
[1:40:53] giving tracks or out on the street if
[1:40:56] he's a Billy Graham no matter who he is
[1:41:00] if he's God's servant respect them all
[1:41:04] the same everyone don't have one above
[1:41:08] another and favorites we don't have that
[1:41:11] don't do that don't respect one person
[1:41:15] above
[1:41:16] another let everybody be on the level
[1:41:21] all right now is that that easy to do do
[1:41:25] we have our favorites sure is that easy
[1:41:29] it's not easy to do but we don't want to
[1:41:31] judge people based on their finances you
[1:41:37] know people that have money they get a
[1:41:39] lot of respect from people because they
[1:41:41] have money but really our respect
[1:41:45] towards a man or woman or human being is
[1:41:49] through the lens of God's word we look
[1:41:53] at at that brother that sister that
[1:41:55] sinner whoever it is through the lens of
[1:41:59] God's word and we don't respect people
[1:42:02] one above the other we shouldn't at any
[1:42:06] cost so brother bam deals with that
[1:42:10] now he talks about
[1:42:13] how he can lose respect for a man that
[1:42:17] that wouldn't keep his word he he makes
[1:42:20] this statement in um Love 1956
[1:42:25] July uh 26 1956 he says this here
[1:42:28] paragraph
[1:42:30] 25 now you get when you get those ideas
[1:42:33] you're wrong that's right don't you
[1:42:35] never think that man has anything to do
[1:42:39] with it it's God alone it's all right
[1:42:41] for you to respect men and to love them
[1:42:44] as your brother but don't never put the
[1:42:47] love of anybody in your heart like you
[1:42:50] have of God or for God keep him first
[1:42:55] love one another but that love in the
[1:42:58] Greek is love is felio which means human
[1:43:01] love but the love you have for God is
[1:43:03] agapo love which is divine love so now
[1:43:07] keep God's love
[1:43:09] first and so brother ROM continues on
[1:43:13] so I'm sorry I didn't read that one that
[1:43:16] I had yes we continue
[1:43:19] on in the message the F father the Al
[1:43:22] has has come he's dealing with this
[1:43:26] brothers that you might disagree with
[1:43:27] and and so forth in paragraph number
[1:43:31] 3056 he says this here and then if we
[1:43:35] become Christian we must put all the
[1:43:37] loyalty and respect in honor on the Lord
[1:43:40] Jesus Christ then if we're not and do
[1:43:43] not believe it don't just wishy-washy
[1:43:46] about it just let the world know where
[1:43:48] you're standing that's the best way and
[1:43:51] it will be a great day when the church
[1:43:54] comes to that place its members rather
[1:43:58] that whether it will either be for
[1:44:00] Christ or against Christ then the whole
[1:44:04] world will know how you stand I don't
[1:44:07] like anyone to Pat me on the shoulder
[1:44:10] and say now brother bam I really love
[1:44:11] you when he knows that I know different
[1:44:14] see he knows that I know different cuz
[1:44:17] his Spirit just doesn't fit right and it
[1:44:22] just isn't
[1:44:24] there and so I then I lose respect for
[1:44:27] that person I like to see a man if he
[1:44:30] said now look I disagree with you with
[1:44:33] that well then he's honest about it but
[1:44:36] Ahab wasn't that kind of a person he was
[1:44:39] the one who wanted to serve the Lord one
[1:44:41] time and his wife wanted to do something
[1:44:42] else then he turned that way and have
[1:44:45] the prophets killed and so forth one of
[1:44:47] those
[1:44:49] wishy-washy up and down in and out God
[1:44:53] can never do nothing with a person like
[1:44:56] that he couldn't in that day or any day
[1:45:01] could he ever use a person like that
[1:45:05] amen so we just want to be who we are if
[1:45:09] we don't see something we disagree with
[1:45:11] something that's fine that's what you
[1:45:13] see you disagree or you like something
[1:45:17] but don't pretend like you like or say
[1:45:19] you do if you really don't and brother
[1:45:21] bam says El Lo respect for a person that
[1:45:24] would do that tell them you love them
[1:45:25] and they really don't in their heart all
[1:45:28] right so we could see that you know that
[1:45:32] we can have respect and then we can lose
[1:45:34] that respect too if we do things that
[1:45:37] are that that lack that you know lack
[1:45:40] those um you know those core values of
[1:45:44] just being honest and being who you are
[1:45:47] I think people respect you when you just
[1:45:49] say what you are what you believe they
[1:45:52] they know you disagree with them they
[1:45:54] know where you stand but then you're not
[1:45:57] trying to destroy them you're not going
[1:46:00] behind their back to hurt them you're
[1:46:03] just telling them you know this is where
[1:46:04] I stand this is what I see don't you
[1:46:07] wouldn't you appreciate that or would
[1:46:10] you want you know people to love you and
[1:46:12] a and behind the scenes they really
[1:46:15] don't you know that's just a it's just a
[1:46:17] toxic environment to be in right and so
[1:46:20] we want to be who we really are are now
[1:46:25] the
[1:46:29] scriptures continue on in dealing with
[1:46:34] how to respect one another and
[1:46:37] respect in our judgments and the things
[1:46:41] that we would say and do in
[1:46:44] Deuteronomy uh 16 verse 19 says Thou
[1:46:47] shalt not rest judgment Thou shalt not
[1:46:50] respect persons neither take a gift for
[1:46:54] a gift does blind the eyes of the wise
[1:46:57] and pervert the words of
[1:47:02] righteous pervert the words of the
[1:47:04] righteous Deuteronomy 16:19 you know in
[1:47:07] this uh this is another translation that
[1:47:11] says it do not pervert Justice or show
[1:47:15] partiality um is using that same you
[1:47:20] know respective person of showing part
[1:47:22] IAL it to someone in judgment because of
[1:47:27] their family name or because of their
[1:47:29] position because of their clout or their
[1:47:32] status you know you have to treat
[1:47:35] everybody the same and that's a
[1:47:37] challenge huh sure Psalms
[1:47:40] 40:4 it says blessed is that man that
[1:47:44] maketh the Lord his trust and respected
[1:47:48] not the proud nor such as turn aside to
[1:47:51] lies
[1:47:53] Psalms
[1:47:54] 138:6 says though the Lord be high yet
[1:47:58] hath he respect unto the lowly but the
[1:48:01] proud he knoweth a far off and so this
[1:48:06] is you know this is the god that we
[1:48:09] serve you know the Lord respects he sees
[1:48:13] everybody he sees an honest heart he
[1:48:16] sees where you're coming from if you're
[1:48:20] honest and truthful doesn't matter you
[1:48:23] have all this other stuff and maybe
[1:48:25] others look better or bigger than you or
[1:48:27] maybe they're more spiritual than you
[1:48:29] the Lord will respect you if you're
[1:48:31] honest and you just honor his word he'll
[1:48:35] hear your prayer hear your cry and he'll
[1:48:39] give ear to you and this is the respect
[1:48:42] that we're longing for you know when you
[1:48:45] want respect from a worldly perspective
[1:48:47] you'll do things that you shouldn't do
[1:48:49] you'll dress in a way and get attention
[1:48:51] that you shouldn't get because you're
[1:48:53] trying to get somebody else's respect
[1:48:55] but the Lord doesn't respect that don't
[1:48:57] you want his respect amen one Psalms
[1:49:03] 24:23 says these things also belong to
[1:49:06] the wise it is not good to have respect
[1:49:08] of person in judgment Proverbs 28:21 to
[1:49:13] have resp of persons is not good for for
[1:49:16] a piece of bread that man will
[1:49:20] transgress now one one of our new
[1:49:23] testament examples to this truth is in
[1:49:27] Acts chapter
[1:49:28] 10 and the scripture is dealing with the
[1:49:32] great Apostle
[1:49:34] Peter and how many love
[1:49:37] Peter wouldn't you want Peter on your
[1:49:40] team cut somebody's ear off even speak
[1:49:45] things that he shouldn't speak Peter was
[1:49:47] on Peter was on a 10 he was ready ready
[1:49:49] to go and uh you know you have encourage
[1:49:53] him to fight for what was what he
[1:49:55] thought was right and you need kind of
[1:49:57] need a little craziness on your team
[1:50:00] sometime it's the
[1:50:02] Fanatics that get the message out many
[1:50:05] times and this is Peter he is he um
[1:50:11] openly uh as the Lord was trying to
[1:50:13] bring the gospel to
[1:50:16] Cornelius he deals with Peter in vision
[1:50:18] and Peter hesitated and in the vision he
[1:50:22] says Lord Lord I've never eaten anything
[1:50:24] common or unclean and the Lord had to
[1:50:27] show him don't call that common or
[1:50:30] unclean I'm respecting a man who has
[1:50:34] given arms who has prayed he's not in
[1:50:37] the Commonwealth of Israel you don't
[1:50:39] even know who he is but he praying and
[1:50:42] his prayers have come up to me for arms
[1:50:44] you don't know who he is yet nobody
[1:50:46] knows who he is all the disciples they
[1:50:48] don't know who this man is yet but I
[1:50:50] know who he is and Cor Millions got
[1:50:54] God's
[1:50:55] respect and when God respects you the
[1:50:59] doors will open for you that's the
[1:51:03] friend that you need that's the person
[1:51:07] it's not what you know it's who you know
[1:51:09] that's the person who you need to know
[1:51:11] who needs to know you is if you can get
[1:51:14] God's respect and that and that comes
[1:51:17] when you do what's right when wrong is
[1:51:20] handed to you it's not always your
[1:51:23] reaction It's the reaction to an action
[1:51:27] and it's placed there before you and
[1:51:30] something is maybe laid out in your path
[1:51:33] that you did not deserve it's wrong and
[1:51:37] you handle it with the word of God with
[1:51:40] the humility of the scriptures with the
[1:51:42] anointing of the Holy Ghost the Lord
[1:51:44] sees every bit of that the church might
[1:51:46] not see it the pastor might not see it
[1:51:49] your parents might not see it your
[1:51:51] husband might not see it your your wife
[1:51:53] might not see it the congregation might
[1:51:55] not see it but there is somebody who
[1:51:58] sees all
[1:52:00] things and you'll never come up short
[1:52:03] when you're doing what's right because
[1:52:05] he sees it all he sees it
[1:52:09] all looks like you don't see it looks
[1:52:12] like maybe somebody else is getting over
[1:52:14] but if you're doing what's right God
[1:52:17] sees you my brother my sister and I
[1:52:21] encourage you to continue to do that um
[1:52:24] he saw Cornelius didn't he he's famous
[1:52:28] today but he wasn't known then but God
[1:52:31] made him known to Peter now this is
[1:52:34] interesting with Peter he had an issue
[1:52:37] with the Gentiles as the Jews did
[1:52:42] amongst the Gentiles the Gentiles of
[1:52:44] those heathens those dogs and he had an
[1:52:46] issue with
[1:52:48] them the Lord had to show him a vision
[1:52:51] to get him to go into this gentile's
[1:52:53] home sit down and eat with this
[1:52:55] man eat with
[1:52:58] him well the Lord had to reveal that to
[1:53:01] him and we see he still had this issue
[1:53:04] in Galatians Chapter 2 let's turn there
[1:53:07] quickly just to show you it's a human
[1:53:09] issue a problem amongst the best of us
[1:53:13] and you
[1:53:14] think you
[1:53:16] know you think it don't exist exist
[1:53:19] today it absolutely exists today there
[1:53:21] are people who play
[1:53:26] favorites
[1:53:29] H just so happen I'm not one of
[1:53:32] them now if you if that was your thought
[1:53:35] you're wrong my brother my sister if
[1:53:38] that's my thought I'm
[1:53:39] wrong I play
[1:53:42] favorites you play favorites human
[1:53:44] beings play favorites but Lord help me
[1:53:48] not to respect men based on their gift
[1:53:53] their talents their economics their
[1:53:57] looks but respect them through the word
[1:53:59] of God Amen Lord help
[1:54:04] us let's take this scripture is uh
[1:54:06] Galatians Chapter 2 I think is verse
[1:54:09] 11 but when Peter was come to Antioch I
[1:54:12] with stood him to the face because he
[1:54:14] was to be blamed for before that certain
[1:54:17] came from James he did eat with the
[1:54:20] Gentiles but when they were come he
[1:54:24] withdrew and separated himself fearing
[1:54:28] them which were of the
[1:54:31] circumcision and the other Jews
[1:54:34] disassembled likewise with him so he
[1:54:37] influenced others in so much that
[1:54:40] Barnabas also was carried away with
[1:54:43] their disass imulation what does that
[1:54:46] word mean somebody look that up for me
[1:54:48] real quick and give me the definition I
[1:54:50] know it's not you know it's a
[1:54:51] disagreement or just give it to me real
[1:54:53] quick all
[1:54:54] right but when I saw that they walked
[1:54:57] not uprightly according to the truth of
[1:55:00] the Gospel I said unto Peter before what
[1:55:04] in private what' he
[1:55:08] do and my mom
[1:55:10] said you acted up in public I'mma get
[1:55:13] you in
[1:55:17] public you embarrass me in public I'm
[1:55:19] going to embarrass you in public
[1:55:22] that's what she would say and this is
[1:55:25] where this is the this is the precept
[1:55:27] that that Paul is dealing with here
[1:55:29] Peter wasn't a nobody Peter was a real
[1:55:32] man Peter was a True Believer but he got
[1:55:34] caught up in this thing he's eating with
[1:55:36] the Gentiles these brothers who's just
[1:55:38] coming in and he's eating with them and
[1:55:40] at the table with them and then a
[1:55:42] certain amount of Jews come of the
[1:55:44] circumcision he sees them and he's
[1:55:46] separated and then he got Barnabas
[1:55:48] involved and he got all the other Jews
[1:55:50] involved it was terrible what he did
[1:55:53] what do you think those Gentiles felt
[1:55:56] like that was eating with brother Peter
[1:55:59] and then all of a sudden he gives him a
[1:56:00] cold shoulder I mean we cool right now
[1:56:03] talking everything's good then you get
[1:56:05] up and just walk I might I was just
[1:56:06] telling you a testimony and you walk off
[1:56:10] because I'm a gentile tell me that feels
[1:56:13] good how many you ever had something
[1:56:15] like that happen to
[1:56:18] you few human beings in here
[1:56:22] few human beings in here sure how many's
[1:56:25] ever did that to
[1:56:28] somebody the altar will be
[1:56:31] open
[1:56:33] yes it's a it's a human flaw it's a
[1:56:36] human it's a human thing you know we we
[1:56:39] have those we have those you know
[1:56:42] weaknesses that we get caught up into
[1:56:44] and Peter a true Apostle a True Believer
[1:56:48] got off track here and it was was in him
[1:56:53] because we see it with corneus here it
[1:56:55] happens again and he's got other
[1:56:57] involves and Paul said I had to rebuke
[1:56:59] him to his face I withstood him and told
[1:57:03] him Peter you're wrong bro you are
[1:57:10] wrong to treat your brothers the
[1:57:13] Gentiles that way just because of
[1:57:15] whatever class you're in and make your
[1:57:19] Gentile Brothers feel that way as you
[1:57:22] could this dissim disass simulation what
[1:57:24] does that mean you have it brother Joe
[1:57:27] who thank
[1:57:29] you concealment of one's thoughts
[1:57:32] feelings and character pretense I'm sure
[1:57:35] there's another an attempt at
[1:57:38] dimation all right thank you that's a
[1:57:41] bit more than you guys are good so I
[1:57:43] bless
[1:57:45] you it's this you know creating these
[1:57:48] little issues these little problems can
[1:57:50] I take five or 10 more minutes it's only
[1:57:52] 11:40 all right thank you so thank you
[1:57:56] so this
[1:57:59] disrespects is it's hypocrisy thank you
[1:58:02] it's hypocrisy like you're here we're
[1:58:06] good over here but then when my family
[1:58:11] comes I change on you or people with
[1:58:15] more influence or more money come I
[1:58:17] change on you but I you know I love you
[1:58:20] brother Sean you're my friend and we're
[1:58:22] hanging out together we go out to eat
[1:58:24] together I do things that embarrass you
[1:58:27] you do a few things that embarrass me
[1:58:29] keep it at 100 as they say but but but
[1:58:33] you're my friend we're out to eat you
[1:58:35] know if another group of important
[1:58:37] business people or whoever Ministry in
[1:58:39] the city come in and I get up and walk
[1:58:41] from your
[1:58:42] table would that be
[1:58:44] nice that's
[1:58:46] incorrect and and Paul saw it and he
[1:58:48] rebuked him to his face it's wrong for
[1:58:51] you to do it what does this show us it
[1:58:53] shows us that men filled with the Holy
[1:58:56] Ghost who are leaders who handle the
[1:58:59] word of Truth who were spokesman who
[1:59:02] were Jesus's rightand man has fallen
[1:59:04] into this so you're capable
[1:59:07] too and this is why the word of the Lord
[1:59:10] is here for us to remind us
[1:59:13] on this respect of
[1:59:17] persons respect of you know a Godly
[1:59:20] person comes into your missed I think
[1:59:22] it's James chapter 1 chapter 2 chapter 3
[1:59:25] when a man with good Godly apparel comes
[1:59:28] in he gets a great seat when one comes
[1:59:30] in he's all roughed up he's all looking
[1:59:33] not very nice we treat him a certain way
[1:59:36] we ought not to do that we not we ought
[1:59:39] to give them the time to at least hear
[1:59:41] where they're coming
[1:59:43] from
[1:59:44] huh am I saying something to somebody is
[1:59:48] this true or
[1:59:49] no don't let brother pet tell you his
[1:59:56] testimony should I squeeze a little bit
[1:59:58] of it out to you brother blei came to
[2:00:01] the message and you know the church said
[2:00:04] he came into the message this is
[2:00:07] testimony he he said he smelled bad cuz
[2:00:11] he was a street guy he was on the
[2:00:12] streets his hair was long and his
[2:00:14] clothes were dirty and he says in the
[2:00:17] assembly there he said they're all great
[2:00:18] lovely people he was talking about you
[2:00:21] know North side the church that's what
[2:00:22] he was talking about it's his testimony
[2:00:24] openly says it all right no indictment
[2:00:26] on that was in the 70s way back whenever
[2:00:29] he came in and he said that there was
[2:00:32] only one brother that befriended him
[2:00:34] enough to tell him that you know you
[2:00:37] need to take your clothes to the laundry
[2:00:39] and wash them and clean and come to
[2:00:43] church like that and and he he never
[2:00:45] knew he said he felt so bad he would
[2:00:47] come to church he loved to hear Brother
[2:00:49] Muse preach and loved to hear his
[2:00:50] singing But then after the service he
[2:00:54] just felt like an outsider now now we we
[2:00:58] we have done that we've been guilty of
[2:01:00] that and we do that because of whatever
[2:01:03] our experience are when you see somebody
[2:01:05] with a full beard you see them with her
[2:01:07] collar up you see him with a tattoo
[2:01:09] whatever it is we we make those
[2:01:11] judgments on people and those are not
[2:01:14] signs of whether somebody's even a seed
[2:01:17] of God or even a believer or even worthy
[2:01:20] of time or no time
[2:01:22] have no respect of persons in judgment
[2:01:27] for the small the great whoever they are
[2:01:30] it's a human flaw and typically people
[2:01:34] who do good Who come out of something
[2:01:36] who God has showed them something they
[2:01:38] are
[2:01:40] susceptible of looking down at people
[2:01:43] because you come out of something you're
[2:01:45] susceptible of looking down on people
[2:01:48] okay I'm not talking about people I'm
[2:01:50] talking about spirits all
[2:01:53] right okay so Peter had this little flaw
[2:01:58] can I go a little bit further
[2:02:00] here
[2:02:05] now brother random deals in the message
[2:02:09] respects and there's so much in there
[2:02:12] that we can
[2:02:13] bring
[2:02:15] but I want to get to this one part here
[2:02:18] it's at the end of the message we'll go
[2:02:19] back through it at another time cuz I'm
[2:02:22] going to close here just
[2:02:24] now and he and he says this here about
[2:02:28] what AA Allen did to
[2:02:30] him and he
[2:02:33] says I think it's in paragraph
[2:02:35] 205
[2:02:37] sisters brothers in the back there he
[2:02:40] says this here and as I started to go
[2:02:43] through this I was like whoa this is
[2:02:45] really this really something now we
[2:02:47] heard this we listened to this I've
[2:02:49] heard this many times but to put this in
[2:02:51] practice ractice it's really something
[2:02:53] else we ask you all to read I think it
[2:02:56] was Matthew chapter
[2:02:57] 18 remember that scripture we ask you
[2:03:00] all to read and we can read that we know
[2:03:02] yeah you got a brother be you know you
[2:03:04] got a a problem with a brother you need
[2:03:06] to go to him alone we could say that we
[2:03:09] can read that but yet and still do we
[2:03:12] practice
[2:03:13] that and that's been one of the flaws or
[2:03:17] weaknesses in my own personal character
[2:03:22] that I've seen that weakness in this
[2:03:24] city in particular and amongst you know
[2:03:28] everybody's talking about one another
[2:03:30] but you're not talking to the person
[2:03:32] that you're talking about they don't
[2:03:34] even know you're talking about them and
[2:03:37] you they deserve that the scripture says
[2:03:40] you owe it to go to them brother R says
[2:03:42] if if I taught anything that was wrong
[2:03:45] in the scriptures you are Duty bound to
[2:03:48] come to me and show me in the scriptures
[2:03:51] where I'm wrong and thankfully there's a
[2:03:55] number of Brothers in this city that I
[2:03:58] know that have done that we've sat and
[2:04:01] talked we agree to disagree total
[2:04:03] respect I respect them I love them I
[2:04:06] know where they stand on the subject
[2:04:07] they know where I stand on the subject
[2:04:09] but they came to
[2:04:11] me and I think that's and that's why I
[2:04:14] respect them if I see them if they come
[2:04:16] into this church here today I have the
[2:04:18] utmost respect because how they handled
[2:04:21] their
[2:04:22] disagreement all right amen so let's
[2:04:26] take this as we as we prepare to close
[2:04:30] here in
[2:04:32] paragraph number
[2:04:37] 20 is it
[2:04:39] 205 very
[2:04:41] good so I think we might be a different
[2:04:46] yeah that's 205 we we'll go down a
[2:04:48] little bit we'll catch that one another
[2:04:50] time we'll take number
[2:04:55] 209 so he's talking about the G he talks
[2:04:58] about the gifts how to respect that he
[2:05:00] talks about people that go into the
[2:05:01] Flesh and all of that but look at this
[2:05:03] in paragraph 208 but here in the
[2:05:05] Tabernacle we want you all to know these
[2:05:07] things
[2:05:08] here when God begins to pour out the
[2:05:10] Holy Spirit upon people sometimes I know
[2:05:13] I've seen people get in the flesh when
[2:05:16] they were under the anointing of the
[2:05:18] spirit I seen them go to extreme
[2:05:22] with
[2:05:23] things but
[2:05:25] what but don't you say nothing about it
[2:05:29] you respect it bow your head you might
[2:05:34] not understand it neither would I but I
[2:05:36] want to respect it anyhow now we must
[2:05:39] have respects to God and when God pours
[2:05:42] out the Holy Spirit I just thank say
[2:05:45] thank you Heavenly Father you're doing
[2:05:47] something for that poor precious soul
[2:05:50] that wants to come to your your home
[2:05:52] like I do someday I seen men like here
[2:05:56] one time a brother that's in the
[2:05:58] ministry said that I talked about him
[2:06:01] and we went and got all the taints and
[2:06:03] sent to him it was brother AA Allen he
[2:06:05] said that I made fun of him talking
[2:06:08] about blood coming out of your hand and
[2:06:10] calling that initial evidence of the
[2:06:12] Holy Ghost and I believe it was blood
[2:06:15] and oil coming out of his hand and
[2:06:17] forehead and things he said was that I
[2:06:20] made fun of and told him that it was of
[2:06:23] the devil I sat back I just wrote him a
[2:06:25] letter I said brother Allan he wrote a
[2:06:27] piece you read it dear brother bandam
[2:06:30] see and so then put out tracks all
[2:06:34] across the all across the country
[2:06:37] instead of coming and see me about it he
[2:06:41] did
[2:06:45] that but now here's what I said I said
[2:06:47] I'll take up all six nights at Phoenix
[2:06:50] I'll send you my tapes and show which
[2:06:51] Leo and them did sent the tapes to them
[2:06:55] I said only one time was your name
[2:06:57] called people put it on my desk and said
[2:06:59] brother brandham brother Alam has just
[2:07:01] been in town told us the initial
[2:07:03] evidence of the Holy Ghost was bleeding
[2:07:04] in the hands and bleeding in the face
[2:07:06] oil running out of your hand that was
[2:07:08] the initial evidence I said I disagree
[2:07:11] with brother Allan upon that being the
[2:07:13] initial evidence of the Holy Ghost cuz
[2:07:16] there was nowhere in the Bible where
[2:07:18] they ever bled at the hands of oil
[2:07:19] coming out their face and hands of proof
[2:07:21] Pro that they had the Holy
[2:07:23] Ghost I said the Holy Ghost was the
[2:07:26] power of God in their lives and Jesus
[2:07:28] said these signs shall follow them that
[2:07:30] believe see in my name shall they cast
[2:07:32] out devils and so forth but I said
[2:07:34] here's one thing I would say about
[2:07:36] brother Allan he's a great man of God
[2:07:40] and if I could preach as good as brother
[2:07:42] Allan could i' never have a healing
[2:07:44] service I just preached the gospel then
[2:07:47] see after he's done put that paper out
[2:07:50] and everything that I did that just on
[2:07:53] what somebody else said but even I
[2:07:56] disagreed with the brother upon his
[2:07:57] theory I certainly wouldn't want to
[2:08:00] blaspheme the brother and then standing
[2:08:03] right there up here in Minnesota at
[2:08:06] night in Minneapolis Minnesota there was
[2:08:07] a great Cathedral temple with Gordon
[2:08:10] Peterson and this guy that wrote the
[2:08:12] book about AA Allen he said everything
[2:08:14] about him that could be said he even had
[2:08:17] the audacity to he said he said he even
[2:08:19] had the audacity to write that book of
[2:08:21] biting Devils about the woman showed a
[2:08:24] print on her hands of a devil bit her
[2:08:26] and things like that now I certainly I
[2:08:28] don't know whether that could be true or
[2:08:30] not because the Devil is a spirit you
[2:08:32] see but this woman claimed a big hairy
[2:08:35] devil come and bit her all over her
[2:08:36] hands and all over her face everything
[2:08:38] like that and he said a a Allen wrote
[2:08:41] that book and the man that wrote the
[2:08:42] book wrote a nice article about me he uh
[2:08:47] here he was sitting right there in the
[2:08:49] meeting that night when brother Peter
[2:08:51] Pon and then come and told me there he
[2:08:53] sit and was bragging on me and Downing a
[2:08:56] a Allen I thought here's the time I
[2:08:59] could take up for brother Allan now
[2:09:01] would I have done that would you have
[2:09:04] done that brother this brother this
[2:09:07] sister actually accused you of something
[2:09:10] that wasn't even true didn't even call
[2:09:12] you or ask you about it and then here's
[2:09:15] another person that's now getting on
[2:09:18] that brother that accused you and taking
[2:09:20] up for you you well whose side you going
[2:09:23] to be on right let's be human beings
[2:09:26] here for a minute take the Holy Ghost
[2:09:28] Halo off from over your head and let's
[2:09:31] be honest for a minute how would you
[2:09:33] behave how would you offer operate
[2:09:37] H here brother brandom is now publicly
[2:09:41] at the pull pit taking up for this
[2:09:44] gentleman that put things in the paper
[2:09:47] all across about him and never came to
[2:09:51] him him and now he's taking up for him
[2:09:52] and this is what he says and this is
[2:09:54] really good now I want to I want to just
[2:09:56] lay this out and then we'll close so I
[2:09:58] walked out there I said I was reading
[2:09:59] here the article in the paper today that
[2:10:02] this certain man that's in the city
[2:10:05] knowing he was sitting right out there I
[2:10:07] said he said here that AA Allen and the
[2:10:10] criticism I said although I appreciate
[2:10:12] the man saying the compliment about me
[2:10:14] that he did I said that wasn't that I
[2:10:17] wasn't out for money and things like
[2:10:18] that and he held the cleanest meetings
[2:10:20] of any of of them and so forth the nice
[2:10:23] things he said I said I appreciate that
[2:10:25] but if that man that wrote this article
[2:10:27] here in the paper never checked his
[2:10:30] notes any closer than to say AA Allen
[2:10:33] wrote this Bing of devils AA Allen never
[2:10:36] wrote that book I know the man that
[2:10:39] wrote it I said he never wrote the book
[2:10:41] at all if the man never checked up on
[2:10:44] his article any closer than that I doubt
[2:10:47] the rest that he's ever said about Allan
[2:10:50] is the truth brother Allen is a truth
[2:10:53] taking up for brother Allen and I said
[2:10:58] besides look at your neighbor and say
[2:11:01] besides
[2:11:03] besides if brother Allan would be
[2:11:07] wrong I'd rather be found at the
[2:11:11] Judgment bar taking my stand with
[2:11:14] brother Allen in the wrong when he's
[2:11:17] trying to win souls to Christ then to be
[2:11:22] criticizing what the man's trying to do
[2:11:26] amen that's right yes sir everyone calls
[2:11:30] on the name of Jesus Christ I'm with him
[2:11:33] whether he's Protestant catholic
[2:11:34] whatever brother bam goes on you might
[2:11:36] disagree with him so there's so much
[2:11:38] more in this message but here W that's a
[2:11:41] good one that's a good one even if he's
[2:11:43] wrong if he's trying to do something for
[2:11:45] Christ even if he's wrong you know I'm a
[2:11:48] picky eater what I said before
[2:11:50] spiritually speaking I like to listen to
[2:11:52] people that's reading the quotes I
[2:11:54] really do I appreciate that but you can
[2:11:57] get over picky and then you start
[2:11:59] becoming
[2:12:01] critical and that I don't want is a
[2:12:05] critical spirit because it doesn't stop
[2:12:08] if you criticize that do you criticize
[2:12:10] this there's everything that can be
[2:12:13] critiqued it doesn't
[2:12:17] stop and you bow your heads don't say
[2:12:20] nothing about it you know there's things
[2:12:22] said right here at this Pulpit different
[2:12:24] Ministries that come I you know I I've
[2:12:28] talked to the brothers they know my
[2:12:29] position on the word and I've tried to
[2:12:32] um be clear with this church where I
[2:12:35] stand I have a a great respect for the
[2:12:38] people here and any other audience that
[2:12:40] I'm preaching or ministering to I
[2:12:42] respect the subject matter that what I'm
[2:12:45] bringing you the prophet brought it I
[2:12:48] try to hold that respect and and um but
[2:12:52] you know special meetings you have
[2:12:54] people that come and even they don't
[2:12:56] even speak maybe they're in the meetings
[2:12:58] they're inviting they're saying things
[2:13:00] and their groups and their ministers and
[2:13:03] they say things that you need to be
[2:13:05] careful of and you know if you got a
[2:13:08] question about it you need to ask you
[2:13:10] need to ask your pastor and or or don't
[2:13:15] but I I I could tell you you know
[2:13:18] there's people that come and they do
[2:13:19] things and I find out and then I hear
[2:13:22] their background I'll call other pastors
[2:13:24] other ministers and I know no I'm not
[2:13:27] going to deal with that I don't want
[2:13:28] anything to do with that and I certainly
[2:13:30] hope that that brother do get tied up
[2:13:32] with this one and get tied up with that
[2:13:34] one because there's a spirit on that
[2:13:36] brother and he's here amongst our midst
[2:13:38] and then people just open their hearts
[2:13:41] their homes their children their
[2:13:43] Ministries up to these
[2:13:46] gifts you got to be careful of you got
[2:13:48] to judge everything by the word
[2:13:50] absolutely you know as it pertains to
[2:13:53] this church in this Pulpit I try to um
[2:13:58] to um keep that communication open with
[2:14:02] the brothers you see something that's
[2:14:03] not right you come tell me there's a a a
[2:14:06] comment Bo you have a question about
[2:14:08] anything you can ask me you can't ask me
[2:14:10] write it on a piece of paper put it in
[2:14:12] the comment box in the back there that's
[2:14:14] what we here for that's what we're here
[2:14:16] to do is to help with that but you know
[2:14:19] this this
[2:14:22] um you know even if a brother is wrong
[2:14:25] there's still a respectful way of
[2:14:28] disagreeing with the brother that is
[2:14:30] that is the point that I'm making and
[2:14:33] so I've seen this disrespect
[2:14:37] amongst the
[2:14:39] um uh the youth with their you know you
[2:14:44] know Moses's sister disrespected
[2:14:48] him and she had the commonality of
[2:14:51] knowing him that's her Junior brother
[2:14:53] that's her little brother but she
[2:14:56] disrespected him and and I'm I'm only
[2:15:00] going to say this because it's on the
[2:15:02] tape not criticizing sister brandom at
[2:15:05] all she was a true servant of God but
[2:15:06] brother Brandon brings that example
[2:15:09] where she got out of the line and
[2:15:11] disrespected him and the angel of the
[2:15:13] Lord didn't like it and if you think
[2:15:16] that brother bam didn't love his wife or
[2:15:17] the angel of the Lord didn't love sister
[2:15:19] Brown you would be absolutely wrong but
[2:15:22] just to show you Peter got off and here
[2:15:24] brother randam exposes this on tape how
[2:15:27] real is that to you this is his
[2:15:31] wife who was frustrated with the kids
[2:15:35] and the whole thing and the pressures
[2:15:38] and she said something or she slammed
[2:15:41] the door I think it was slammed the door
[2:15:42] in his face you all are familiar with it
[2:15:44] right I don't I don't like to bring it
[2:15:46] up but it's on the tape and it's for our
[2:15:49] warning for our edification slam door in
[2:15:51] his
[2:15:52] face well she shouldn't have slammed the
[2:15:54] door in brother B's face is there
[2:15:56] anybody's face that we should slam the
[2:15:58] door
[2:16:00] in that's the point right
[2:16:02] there oh so yeah you slam the door in
[2:16:06] Satan's
[2:16:07] face but sometimes we think Satan is on
[2:16:10] my so you got to be careful with that
[2:16:14] amen you be careful you slam the door
[2:16:17] you slam a door in a in a Brother's face
[2:16:20] slam the door you're in a sis your
[2:16:22] wife's face some people some people
[2:16:24] don't respect a wife just because she's
[2:16:26] a woman just because you know there's a
[2:16:30] disrespect just because she's a woman I
[2:16:32] am not going to listen to No Woman tell
[2:16:35] me nothing what she's saying is right
[2:16:38] don't matter she's out of her place well
[2:16:41] you need to pick up your Bible and read
[2:16:43] your Bible huh
[2:16:46] sure and so we don't res we we we
[2:16:50] respect the word we respect your office
[2:16:52] you slam the door in your mama's face
[2:16:55] slam the door in your daddy's face slam
[2:16:57] the door in your husband's face slam the
[2:16:59] door in your wife's face really as
[2:17:04] Believers you know we need to really
[2:17:07] check that when we fear one another when
[2:17:09] we love one another then brother B says
[2:17:12] we fear one
[2:17:13] another and that's a respect that we
[2:17:15] have for one another and that respect
[2:17:18] and brother mam gives this example with
[2:17:20] AA Al did to him that you know he
[2:17:23] shouldn't have did that brother Allen
[2:17:26] should have came to him and told
[2:17:29] him found out about it before writing a
[2:17:31] public
[2:17:33] paper dealing with it so God help us to
[2:17:37] have thisr I just have to stop here okay
[2:17:41] don't you love the
[2:17:44] Lord God bless you if the musicians will
[2:17:48] come it's a whole another part I have
[2:17:51] several parts I need to get to but I
[2:17:52] want to just lay that out for you there
[2:17:56] maybe tonight we can play a portion of
[2:17:59] that so let me thank
[2:18:02] you okay we'll keep sister Peggy and
[2:18:06] prayer Peggy Thorn here she's not
[2:18:08] feeling well she was here this morning
[2:18:12] God bless her so let me let me read that
[2:18:15] quote that I started with uh this
[2:18:17] morning one more time for you
[2:18:22] as we
[2:18:24] close it says it's in the message when
[2:18:26] their eyes were open paragraph number 71
[2:18:31] now when the word comes into you when
[2:18:35] you accept God's word and it comes into
[2:18:37] you then the promise of that promise
[2:18:41] that you've accepted manifest itself
[2:18:44] itself and then you know who it is but
[2:18:49] what did he do how did he make himself
[2:18:51] known to them because he did the same
[2:18:53] things he did before his
[2:18:55] crucifixion then they know that that was
[2:18:58] him because he had raised from the dead
[2:19:01] all the preaching all the teaching and
[2:19:03] everything else he had done had failed
[2:19:06] but when he revealed himself doing the
[2:19:08] same thing he did before his crucifixion
[2:19:12] they knew it was him it opened their
[2:19:15] eyes so this my brothers and sisters is
[2:19:18] not just information on on what's
[2:19:21] respect what's disrespectful you want
[2:19:23] God's respect what God disrespects and
[2:19:26] all this is a revelation that we need
[2:19:30] Lord give me the love give me the
[2:19:32] respect for your word first the members
[2:19:35] of the body next and then to the
[2:19:39] stranger or The Sinner amen God bless
[2:19:42] you let us
