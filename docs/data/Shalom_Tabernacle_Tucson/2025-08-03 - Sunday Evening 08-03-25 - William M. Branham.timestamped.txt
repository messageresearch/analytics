[11:12] Don't you worry, little children. Oh,
[11:17] should death knock on your door. Oh,
[11:21] don't know. Death is a doorway
[11:26] that leads to the heavenly shore.
[11:30] And over there is no heartache.
[11:34] No sorrow, grief, nor pain, is perfect
[11:39] love. Peace and joy beyond compare.
[11:46] One day I'm gone.
[11:50] and take a step. Oh, to my
[11:55] one day I'm going to take
[11:58] another step
[12:01] into my

[12:41] Oh, come on
[12:43] a little higher.
[12:46] So through the heavenly

[12:55] me.
[12:57] [Music]
[12:58] Well, the next hill I look. Oh, I see
[13:06] victory
[13:08] around the next turn in the road.
[13:13] That old devil, he's got to flee. God's
[13:17] army is marching.
[13:20] We're marching onward
[13:22] to slay that old enemy
[13:26] around the next turn. I see King Jesus
[13:31] coming for me.
[13:35] One day I'm going to take a step all
[13:40] toward my

[13:47] another step
[13:50] to my
[13:53] one day I know
[13:56] the final step
[14:01] sending free all might the offering
[14:05] Oh, I hear it falling in.
[14:12] [Applause]
[14:15] Couple song specials tonight. Sister
[14:17] Buckles is with us. So maybe she could
[14:19] come and sing for us. And before we take
[14:23] the request of the Lord,
[14:26] it's calling. Come up.
[14:29] A little higher
[14:32] into a perfect word. It's falling. Come
[14:37] on.
[14:39] A little higher
[14:41] into a godly love. It's calling. Come
[14:46] on.
[14:48] A little higher.
[14:50] tore through the heavenly
[14:54] my theoping.
[14:57] Oh, I hear it calling me.
[15:46] Sing
[15:49] [Music]
[15:58] it with me.
[16:00] There is
[16:03] a day
[16:05] when
[16:08] shall come.
[16:11] No more clouds
[16:14] in the skies.
[16:16] No more tears
[16:18] to dim the eyes.
[16:21] All this peace
[16:24] forever more
[16:27] on that
[16:30] golden chore.
[16:32] What a day.
[16:35] A glorious day
[16:38] that will be.
[16:43] What a day
[16:46] that will be
[16:48] when my Jesus
[16:51] I shall see.
[16:54] And I
[16:56] upon his face, the one who saved me by
[17:02] his grace.
[17:05] When he takes me by the hand
[17:10] and leads me through
[17:13] the promised land.
[17:16] What a day, a glorious day
[17:21] that will be.
[17:26] There will be no
[17:29] sorrow there.
[17:32] No more burdens
[17:35] to bear.
[17:38] No more sickness,
[17:41] no pain,
[17:43] no more parting
[17:46] over there.
[17:49] And forever
[17:51] I will be
[17:54] with the one who died for me.
[18:00] What a day,
[18:02] a glorious day
[18:05] that will be.
[18:10] What a day
[18:13] that will be
[18:16] when my Jesus
[18:18] I shall see
[18:21] and I look
[18:24] upon his face.
[18:26] The one who saved
[18:29] me by his grace.
[18:32] When he takes
[18:34] me by the hand and leads me through
[18:40] the promised land.
[18:43] What a day,
[18:46] a glorious day
[18:49] that will be.
[18:54] What a day
[18:57] that will be
[18:59] when my Jesus
[19:02] I shall see.
[19:05] And I look
[19:07] upon his face, the one who saved me by
[19:14] his grace.
[19:16] Then he takes me by the hand and leads
[19:22] me through the promised land.
[19:27] What a day,
[19:29] a glorious day
[19:32] that will be.
[19:37] What a day,
[19:40] a glorious day
[19:43] that will be.
[19:45] [Music]
[19:51] [Applause]
[19:54] Amen. What a day that'll be.
[19:58] Amen. We think about that day. You can't
[20:01] not have an emotion when we're thinking
[20:03] about that. It's either a good one or a
[20:04] bad one. And I trust it's a good one
[20:06] when we're thinking about that day. And
[20:08] if it's a bad emotion that you're not
[20:10] ready for that day, well, make it a good
[20:12] emotion before you leave here tonight.
[20:14] Amen. There's no sense in in playing
[20:17] church anymore.
[20:19] It's it's it's too late and it's it's
[20:22] it's not worth it. Satan doesn't have
[20:24] anything to offer compared to what he
[20:27] has to offer.
[20:29] Amen. But there is coming a day where
[20:32] every knee will bow, every tongue will
[20:34] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. Maybe
[20:36] we could just stand and sing that. He is
[20:38] Lord. He has risen from the dead and he
[20:41] is Lord. as our brothers come for the
[20:43] offering tonight. For he is Lord.
[20:52] Yes, he is Lord.
[20:59] Yes, he has risen
[21:04] from the dead.
[21:07] that he is Lord.
[21:13] Oh, every
[21:16] knee
[21:18] shall
[21:20] bow
[21:21] and every tongue
[21:25] confess
[21:29] that
[21:30] Jesus
[21:34] Christ
[21:36] is
[21:38] Lord.
[21:39] [Music]
[21:46] Can we all bow our heads in prayer?
[21:49] Father, we're thankful, Lord, that
[21:51] you're the Lord of our life. We're
[21:54] happy, Lord, to bow a knee, Father, and
[21:58] Lord, just contact you.
[22:00] Lord, you have everything in control,
[22:02] Lord, of our lives,
[22:04] Lord, many needs here tonight perhaps,
[22:08] Father. And we pray Lord for the service
[22:12] for brother Israel Lord the family Lord
[22:15] every musician Lord every teacher Lord
[22:19] all those that labor and ministry of
[22:22] helps Father we pray your hand upon her
[22:24] mightily
[22:26] Lord we think of Sister Waver Lord as
[22:28] she's up in years and just barely
[22:31] hanging on Father Lord we don't know her
[22:35] appointed time but Father if there's
[22:38] still time on the clock. We ask you,
[22:40] Lord, to comfort her and bring her
[22:41] healing and help her in every way she
[22:44] has need of. Father,
[22:46] Lord, tomorrow, Lord, I face a surgery,
[22:49] I pray your mighty hand would just bring
[22:51] me through, Lord, and guide the doctors,
[22:55] Lord, for every unspoken request, for
[22:58] every heart that's lifted to you now,
[22:59] Father. We pray you'd bring mighty
[23:01] deliverance, Lord, that you grant the
[23:04] desires of every heart.
[23:06] Father, tonight we pray your word would
[23:08] be more precious to us than ever. Lord,
[23:11] let it become Christ in us shining
[23:14] through. Father,
[23:17] Lord, and those that may not be here, be
[23:19] with everyone and we'll give you all the
[23:21] praise and the glory. Father, we also
[23:23] think of Natalie McGawan. Lord, help her
[23:26] through this time of pneumonia. And
[23:29] there's other things, Father, others
[23:31] factors, but you've brought her this
[23:32] far. We pray Lord that you would later
[23:36] unto all that you have for us. We thank
[23:39] you for everything. In the name of our
[23:40] Lord Jesus Christ, we ask. Amen.
[23:47] Amen. Just singing that song. You can't
[23:49] help but think of the hundreds of times
[23:52] that we sung that when we went to Tucson
[23:54] Tabernacle years ago. That was one of
[23:56] Brother Green's theme songs. It was He
[23:59] is Lord. And you just you think about
[24:02] that, you start thinking about what a
[24:04] day that'll be when we see our loved
[24:06] ones as well. And we're looking forward
[24:08] to that, but it's going to pale compared
[24:10] to to seeing him. So maybe we just sing
[24:12] that one more time. Brother Zach has a
[24:14] has a special for us tonight. Yes, he is
[24:19] Lord.
[24:23] Yes, he's my Lord.
[24:30] Oh, he has risen
[24:35] from the dead
[24:38] and he is Lord.
[24:45] Every
[24:48] knee
[24:50] shall
[24:51] bow and every
[24:55] tongue
[24:57] confess
[25:01] that
[25:02] Jesus
[25:06] Christ
[25:08] is
[25:10] Lord.
[25:12] Amen. You can be seated.

[40:58] to the house of the Lord tonight. Like
[41:01] to stand and go right to the word. We're
[41:02] going to listen to this message. Brother
[41:05] Rom preach Jehovah Gina and in the
[41:09] scriptures Genesis chapter 22.
[41:14] I think he was on a series because he he
[41:17] mentioned that never got to his and he's
[41:19] been reading the scripture over and
[41:21] over, but it doesn't I don't think he
[41:23] actually reads it in the sermon, but he
[41:26] will be referring to out of Genesis
[41:29] chapter 22,
[41:31] the offering of Isaac
[41:35] in verse number one.
[41:38] And it came to pass after these things
[41:41] that God did tempt Abraham and said unto
[41:43] him,"Abraham,"
[41:45] and he said, "Behold, here I am." And he
[41:48] said, Take now thy son, thy only son
[41:51] Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee in
[41:54] the land of Mariah, and offer him
[41:56] therefore a burnt offering upon one of
[41:58] the mountains, which I will tell thee
[42:00] of." And Abraham rose up early in the
[42:04] morning, saddled his ass, and took two
[42:07] of his young men with him, and Isaac his
[42:10] son, claved the wood for the burnt
[42:12] offering, and rose up, and went unto the
[42:15] place which God had told him. Then on
[42:18] the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes
[42:21] and saw the place a far off. And Abraham
[42:25] said unto his young men, "Abide ye here
[42:28] with the ass, and I and the lad will go
[42:31] yonder and worship and come again to
[42:34] you." And Abraham took the wood of the
[42:37] burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac
[42:38] his son. And he took the fire in his
[42:41] hand and a knife, and they went both of
[42:44] them together. And Isaac spake unto Abra
[42:47] his father and said, "My father." And he
[42:50] said, "Here I am, my son." He said,
[42:53] "Behold the fire and the wood, but where
[42:55] is the lamb for a burnt offering?" And
[42:58] Abraham said, "My son, God will provide
[43:01] himself a lamb for a burnt offering." So
[43:04] they went both of them together. Amen.
[43:09] Thank God for the reading of his word.
[43:10] Let's sing Only Believe.
[43:17] We believe
[43:19] [Music]
[43:26] that all things are possible.
[43:32] Oh,
[43:34] [Music]
[43:38] only
[43:41] [Music]
[43:49] all things are possible.
[43:54] All things. Say, Lord, I believe.
[43:59] Oh Lord,
[44:01] I believe.
[44:04] [Music]
[44:08] &gt;&gt; I believe
[44:11] all things are possible.
[44:17] Lord,
[44:19] I believe.
[44:22] Lord,
[44:24] I believe.
[44:28] Lord,
[44:30] I believe
[44:32] [Music]
[44:34] all things are possible.
[44:39] Lord,
[44:43] God bless you. You may be seated,
[44:45] brother.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thank you very much.
[44:52] [Applause]
[44:57] I'm sorry that I had such a raspy throat
[45:00] today.
[45:02] But this is 4 months straight in service
[45:06] and it just seems I could just go from
[45:08] one to another. I wonder if you can hear
[45:10] me. Can you hear me? Can you hear me up
[45:13] in the balcony?
[45:16] [Applause]
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Um
[45:19] I guess my zeal is eating up my wisdom.
[45:24] I preach a lot then all hours I pray and
[45:30] then another thing I get hot really easy
[45:33] and when I'm speaking
[45:36] as I say that about my hair coming out
[45:40] that's not a natural thing that was an
[45:42] accident
[45:43] a barber did it was going to put some
[45:47] stuff on my hair to take the dander out
[45:49] is
[45:51] [Applause]
[45:53] carbolic acid.
[45:55] So, medicine's all right, but you want
[45:58] to know who's giving it to you.
[46:01] One ghost killed the father.
[46:04] So,
[46:06] and one treatment fixes me all up. So,
[46:10] just know who's giving it. That's the
[46:12] same way I think about salvation. I want
[46:16] to know where it comes from.
[46:18] I want to know somebody's talking about
[46:20] has had an experience of what they're
[46:22] talking about.
[46:24] That's what makes it so real. When Jesus
[46:27] become so real to us,
[46:30] I'm I'm standing probably a little too
[46:31] close to this.
[46:34] A little more conscious of my horses
[46:36] than I guess I should be.
[46:39] But as far as I know, I don't have no
[46:40] cold. It just preach for each four month
[46:44] straight all the way to the frozen
[46:46] regions of the north to the jungles of
[46:49] the south and just change one day one
[46:51] place and couple days somewhere else and
[46:55] that does it constantly speaking outside
[46:58] all kinds of weather.
[47:00] So we're happy to be here, happy to be
[47:04] in Colia.
[47:06] This has been indeed to me a great
[47:10] thrilling time to visit the Colinas.
[47:14] And as I said the other night, I believe
[47:16] like the wine at the wedding supper, the
[47:18] Lord left the best for last. I don't
[47:21] mean that uh any disregards to other
[47:25] states. They've all been very nice and
[47:28] the whole world that I visit has been
[47:30] very nice. But I've certainly the
[47:34] Carolina people has found a warm place
[47:36] in my heart that'll be there until I
[47:38] meet you in the rapture.
[47:41] This little pastor here, Brother
[47:43] Jeffrey,
[47:44] what a wonderful little character. He,
[47:47] brother, I believe Pardon and Brother
[47:52] Dixie, the three pastors that I've met
[47:54] in the association of in these revivals,
[47:59] how wonderful they've been to me. How I
[48:02] appreciate them all. So glad that has
[48:05] ministers like that. Just got a chance a
[48:07] few minutes ago to shake hands with some
[48:09] of the closure behind it.
[48:11] Just a good old warm
[48:14] panel
[48:16] handshake.
[48:17] I like it like that. Don't you?
[48:20] We forgot that.
[48:23] I hope my wife forgives me. She said
[48:26] that
[48:27] I call her up here but she faint.
[48:30] She's so vual. She's like me.
[48:34] So I was very vaguely once, but I had to
[48:37] get out of it for the Lord. So, but she
[48:40] is very vual. And I called her on the
[48:44] platform one time. She seen me go into
[48:46] visions many times at the house. She
[48:48] just stepped out of the room. But the
[48:50] first time she was ever on the platform
[48:51] is a few months ago. Mr. Mohler kind of
[48:54] tricked her into it and got her to the
[48:55] platform. One ning had already come on.
[48:59] She said, "I I I don't desire."
[49:02] And so, but
[49:07] if there's any credit to be given to the
[49:09] brand family, let it go to her. She's
[49:12] the one who deserves it. She stands
[49:14] between me and the public. 37 years old,
[49:16] almost completely white.
[49:19] And a real mother, sweetheart. Why? I
[49:23] trust that all you boys when you get
[49:26] married, you get a wife like God gave
[49:28] me. And I'm so happy for my children.
[49:34] Billy, Paul, little Rebecca,
[49:37] Sarah, and little baby Joseph. We greet
[49:41] you all and we thank you for your
[49:43] kindness. A few moments ago, they
[49:47] taken up a love offering for me. I
[49:49] didn't have to do that. Wasn't asked to.
[49:53] Just a courtesy.
[49:55] I could have been all a millionaire. You
[49:57] know that if id just taken what was
[50:00] given. One offering, one
[50:04] bank was over a,500,000.
[50:09] I refused to look at it. When agents
[50:12] brought it to me, said I don't want
[50:14] people's money. I want their confidence.
[50:17] I can win them to Christ.
[50:19] I'd rather have.
[50:22] You got some lovely homes. You I've been
[50:25] driving around your city, some fine
[50:28] places, but you know, I'd rather and I I
[50:31] appreciate that. Oh, you don't know how
[50:33] glad I am to see God prosper someone.
[50:37] I love it.
[50:39] But the Lord has given me a home. It's a
[50:43] parage. It belongs to the church that I
[50:45] used to pastor. I just live there.
[50:48] But
[50:50] I I tell you, I'd rather have favor with
[50:52] God than anything I know.
[50:56] And I can't have favor with God
[50:59] and not favor with you all.
[51:02] You are the one who works with me in
[51:05] Christ. If you didn't believe me this
[51:08] afternoon, there would be nobody here.
[51:11] What good would my message do to the
[51:13] people if there's nobody here to receive
[51:15] it? What good would it do if it fell on
[51:18] the hearts that were stony and didn't
[51:20] believe it? See, you're just as much
[51:22] into it as I am or the rest of it. All
[51:26] together, we're co-workers in Christ
[51:28] Jesus.
[51:31] As I was speaking about my wife a few
[51:33] moments ago, thought first I let it pass
[51:35] by, but it's just too good.
[51:38] She'll tell me about that on the road
[51:40] home this afternoon.
[51:42] You know what? I I just I like
[51:45] oldfashioned things. That's the reason I
[51:47] like the oldfashioned gospel.
[51:50] I believe that when you handshake, it's
[51:52] just not reach out. I like one of them
[51:55] real good old times. See, like we used
[51:57] to have love seems to be failing in our
[52:01] generation.
[52:03] I was down sometime my wife
[52:07] and a lady said, "How do sister Brad?" I
[52:10] see my wife turning.
[52:12] I looked around. I said, "Honey, that
[52:14] lady spoke to you." She said, "I spoke
[52:17] to her."
[52:19] I said, "I didn't hear it." She said, "I
[52:22] smile." Oh. I said, "Honey, that's not a
[52:25] that old little silly pot and greetings
[52:27] is not a hello." I said, "I I like to
[52:30] hear somebody hello. I I like to where
[52:33] you really speak and use the
[52:34] oldfashioned way."
[52:36] I remember brother Bworth,
[52:40] Dr. FForth, if he ever comes this way,
[52:43] greet him. He's a lovely brother.
[52:46] And he had retired. He not retired. He
[52:48] just quit. He thought his ministry is
[52:50] over. That's been about seven or eight
[52:52] years ago. And now he's one of my
[52:55] managers. So he is down was having a
[52:59] campaign down in Florida and there was
[53:03] some kind of a duchess or something was
[53:06] left had the ground. So in the afternoon
[53:08] when he started leaving he said,
[53:09] "Brother Brand Duchess is back here."
[53:12] Now friends, I didn't know then what a
[53:14] duchess is. I don't know anymore today.
[53:16] I don't know what one is, but it was
[53:19] some kind of a woman back there and she
[53:22] was dressed.
[53:25] She had enough jewels on her arms to
[53:26] send a dozen missionaries around the
[53:28] world like that's not necessary.
[53:32] and she had a pair of specks on a stick
[53:36] holding out that far from her. Now, you
[53:37] know, nobody can see through glass
[53:41] and she's looking out like that and she
[53:44] said, "Are you Dr. Ray?" I said, "No,
[53:49] I'm not." I'm rather you call me Brother
[53:52] Dale.
[53:54] And she I had her hand like this. She
[53:56] said, "I am charmed to meet you.
[54:02] We shoved our handful down. I said,
[54:03] "Well, sister, get it down here so I
[54:05] know.
[54:12] You know, I just wonder how people put
[54:14] on when after all you're just 6'."
[54:19] I standing by a big museum here some
[54:22] time ago. I love art,
[54:25] music, and in this museum, there's two
[54:28] young fellas looking at analysis of a
[54:31] human body of a man that weighed 150
[54:33] pounds. You know how much you're worth
[54:35] if you weigh 150 lbs? You're worth 84
[54:38] cents.
[54:40] You got whitewash about you to sprinkle
[54:42] a human's nest. Just a little bit of
[54:45] calcium and so forth is worth 84 cents.
[54:49] Thank you, sister. With the $1,000 be
[54:51] cool on
[54:54] nose turned up and rained and drowned
[54:56] and thinking you're somebody when you're
[54:59] only worth 84 cents.
[55:02] That body's that boy stand there said,
[55:03] "Well," one looked toward said, "John,
[55:06] we're not very much after all, are we?"
[55:09] Oh, this is my chance. I tapped him on
[55:12] the back. I said, "That's true, boys.
[55:14] That you got a soul that's worth 10,000
[55:16] words.
[55:19] Take care of that soul. Let the 84 cents
[55:21] go.
[55:23] Watch that soul before it forever. And
[55:26] that's true, friends. Now,
[55:29] with this in mind,
[55:31] and I'm I'm ashamed to even try to read
[55:34] that same text again. I've been two
[55:36] times on it. Never did get to it. You're
[55:40] such a wonderful audience. I believe I
[55:42] could stay on that same text months.
[55:45] I remember one time at my church at
[55:48] home, I preached nearly a year on Job
[55:52] and I had him on the ash sheet back
[55:54] there for about 4 months.
[55:57] Some nice lady, very diplomatic.
[56:00] She was too nice, I guess, to come up
[56:02] and tell me, but she wrote me a nice
[56:04] little letter. She said, "Reb
[56:07] I'm sure enjoying every one of messages,
[56:10] but when you go to get job all day, she
[56:15] Well, I was waiting for a climax.
[56:19] Got several souls to the altar when Joel
[56:21] got off the edging. I just love the Old
[56:24] Testament. It's nuggets and every one of
[56:27] them point to Christ Jesus at Calvary.
[56:31] Now, friends,
[56:32] if there's been any blessing or anything
[56:35] in our come has been, we don't go unless
[56:38] we're led to places. And I know it's
[56:41] been a blessing to us. Not only have you
[56:44] been blessed, but we've been blessed by
[56:45] coming.
[56:47] And now
[56:49] I trust to God that the meetings will
[56:52] mean lots to him. That you people who've
[56:55] been saved will join some good
[56:58] spiritually church. And all these
[57:01] pastors, I pray that their ministry will
[57:04] be blessed exceedingly abundantly. all
[57:07] you people prosper health. God bless you
[57:11] all.
[57:12] Till I see you again, pray for me.
[57:17] And if I have to go before I see you
[57:20] again, won't you do me a favor?
[57:24] If I go and my bodies can be buried,
[57:29] when they let me down to the ground,
[57:32] they're going to say only believe.
[57:35] So when you hear on the radio or news or
[57:37] somewhere that I'm gone, stop this few
[57:40] minutes and I'm only leaving. I believe
[57:43] I'll come out for my mama dead someday.
[57:48] Most all brands when they get old,
[57:52] some of them live long lives. My
[57:55] grandmother was 110. My grandfather died
[57:59] at 97. My grandmother on my mother's
[58:03] side, she died young. the scarf on her,
[58:06] but
[58:08] she was the one that was a half breed
[58:11] Cherokee Indian. And my grandfather died
[58:16] about four years ago on my mother's side
[58:19] being somewhere in his 90s. My father
[58:22] went at 52.
[58:25] I don't know when that will come but
[58:28] usually when they get old the brand it's
[58:31] just a nature like Isaac went blind
[58:34] Jacob went blind both of them prophets
[58:36] and so forth just seem to render family
[58:40] strain
[58:41] the Brandoms when they get old they go
[58:44] to shake pause
[58:48] I expect if I leave
[58:51] something gre preach my last sermon
[58:54] Pray for the lick person.
[58:58] I hope I'm an old man with me. Jesus
[59:01] tries.
[59:02] I come all the way through every broad
[59:04] patch, every hard place.
[59:07] I come down to the river and I can feel
[59:09] its dashers coming.
[59:12] The foam coming in from out there and I
[59:14] know what time has come. Standing with
[59:16] the gray hairs hanging around my
[59:18] shoulders and shaking with the stick in
[59:19] my hand.
[59:22] Home
[59:23] helmet. Lay it down.
[59:27] Stick the old sword deer back in the
[59:29] sheath of eternity.
[59:31] Scream out, "Father, send out the light
[59:33] bulb coming over this morning. He'll be
[59:37] there. I don't worry about that. That's
[59:40] been settled for 25 years. It's more
[59:44] settled today in my heart than ever was.
[59:47] I know who I am believing. I'm persuade
[59:50] he's able to keep that which I committed
[59:52] to him again today.
[59:54] I hope to see you over there
[59:57] and until then I've got a trip to Africa
[1:00:00] many places coming when the winds are
[1:00:03] blowing hard the hot breezes across the
[1:00:06] country and I'm standing in challenge of
[1:00:08] which doctors and so forth. Will you
[1:00:10] promise to be praying for me?
[1:00:14] I'll pray for you. Now let us speak to
[1:00:16] him. Our heavenly father, we thank thee
[1:00:19] today for Jesus, thy son,
[1:00:23] closing this revival,
[1:00:25] not closing it, Lord. May it just be
[1:00:28] beginning. May the influence of your
[1:00:32] visit with us never leave these people
[1:00:35] until Jesus comes. Then start an
[1:00:38] oldfashioned revival throughout the city
[1:00:41] and the state. every church, all the
[1:00:44] full gospels,
[1:00:46] Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians,
[1:00:49] Nazarines, whatever they are. Father,
[1:00:51] send a great revival to us.
[1:00:54] Bless these handkerchics who are here
[1:00:56] before us. Oh, eternal God, let your
[1:00:59] spirit come upon each of them and bless
[1:01:02] them that they'll be healed as they go
[1:01:05] to their destination.
[1:01:07] when they're laid up on the sick folks
[1:01:09] that they're intended for. May diseases
[1:01:11] leave their body. Bless us. Love the
[1:01:14] audience. Lord, bless Brother Jeff.
[1:01:18] God, be with these other pastors. Be
[1:01:21] with all these members, other churches
[1:01:23] everywhere, all the pastors of the city
[1:01:26] and throughout the regions. Grant these
[1:01:29] things to us. Father, give us just a
[1:01:31] little voice to speak, a great meeting
[1:01:33] service. May many find their way to
[1:01:36] Christ. let him be healed or we ask it
[1:01:39] in Jesus name thy son. Amen.
[1:01:53] The same text
[1:01:56] Genesis 22.
[1:01:59] Satan says you can't finish it. I can't.
[1:02:02] by God. We brought Abraham from the time
[1:02:06] that he was called of God
[1:02:10] and was brought to a place where he had
[1:02:14] received the promise in figuratively.
[1:02:18] Last night we left his El Shadi, God
[1:02:22] speaking to him. Then we got over to God
[1:02:26] promised you Sarah and Abraham and
[1:02:28] showed a sign what he was going to do
[1:02:30] for all his children. How many was sure
[1:02:32] last time I see your hand? Do you
[1:02:34] believe it? Say amen.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; That our hope is built on nothing less
[1:02:40] than Jesus blood and righteousness. All
[1:02:43] around my soul gives way and is all my
[1:02:46] hope and stay. On Christ's solid rock we
[1:02:50] stand over the grounds is sinking
[1:02:53] silence
[1:02:55] fails. Everything else fails. God's word
[1:02:59] can fail.
[1:03:01] I was with a great doctor here not long
[1:03:04] ago, doctor of science.
[1:03:07] He gave a a degree to a boy, a young
[1:03:11] fellow, a friend of mine. And after he
[1:03:13] embraced him as receiving his degree in
[1:03:16] science, he was from Washington.
[1:03:20] and he embraced him and paid this thing
[1:03:23] on him and he said, "Son, after all
[1:03:26] these years of study in science, he said
[1:03:30] in Washington or somewhere some hall of
[1:03:33] science, I forget how many books was
[1:03:35] written on the latest science."
[1:03:38] He said it would take you at least two
[1:03:40] years if you read day and night to read
[1:03:43] them all through. And by the time you
[1:03:45] got them all read through, then you had
[1:03:48] to discard everything that you learned.
[1:03:51] It's that fast. To them, things that
[1:03:54] scientifically proven now would be
[1:03:56] scientifically proven to be wrong. Then
[1:04:00] I stood waiting. That night, that same
[1:04:02] man in Streetport, Louisiana, sat in my
[1:04:05] meeting.
[1:04:07] I see him. I said, "I'm glad to have the
[1:04:09] doctor here with us tonight." And I
[1:04:11] heard his remark what he said that this
[1:04:14] young student who's here now with us a
[1:04:17] leader of this music here tonight on the
[1:04:19] platform. But if he would take two
[1:04:22] years, how science will absolutely prove
[1:04:26] that the things that they once proved to
[1:04:28] be right, they prove again to be wrong.
[1:04:31] When I went to school, they told me the
[1:04:33] sun set perfectly still and the world
[1:04:35] went around it. That scientifically
[1:04:37] proved to be a lie. Now
[1:04:40] the sun runs also. That's right. See, so
[1:04:45] I suppose Joshua, he wasn't so ignorant
[1:04:47] after all when he prayed for God as the
[1:04:49] sun. See, it always comes back to the
[1:04:52] book.
[1:04:53] Here some time ago, science said, "Oh
[1:04:56] my, isn't that awful that that Bible
[1:04:59] says that God said as a man thinkketh in
[1:05:02] his heart?" There's no mental faculties
[1:05:04] in his heart to think about. But you
[1:05:05] know what? Last year they found out God
[1:05:07] was right.
[1:05:08] The soul lives in the heart and not in
[1:05:11] the mind. That's right. So God was
[1:05:14] right. As a man thinkketh in his heart,
[1:05:16] so is he. Not as his intellectuals
[1:05:19] introduced to him, but as his soul tells
[1:05:21] him, it can't fail there. Now, so I said
[1:05:25] to that science, I said, "Sir, them
[1:05:27] books will fail and always will fail,
[1:05:29] but I can tell you a book that you'll
[1:05:32] never have to take back anything it ever
[1:05:34] said. It'll always be proven to be true.
[1:05:37] That's God's word.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Heavens and earth will pass away, said
[1:05:40] Jesus. But my word shall never fail. I
[1:05:45] love that.
[1:05:47] Abraham trusted in God's word. And we're
[1:05:49] the children of Abraham today because we
[1:05:52] trust in God's word. We believe it
[1:05:55] regardless what people says and what
[1:05:58] theologians say and educators say,
[1:06:00] science says. If it's contrary to the
[1:06:02] word, every man's words a lie. God's
[1:06:05] true. It's the way I believe it. And no
[1:06:08] matter how strange it may seem, I
[1:06:11] believe it to be true anyhow. Now, want
[1:06:14] you to notice Abraham. Now, we're going
[1:06:17] to finish up the text just for a few
[1:06:19] minutes before we start the prayer line.
[1:06:21] Could you imagine this little boy Isaac
[1:06:24] being born?
[1:06:26] Abraham and Sarah now about 115
[1:06:31] years old was Sarah and about 11 125
[1:06:36] years old was Abraham
[1:06:39] waiting. Here's the promised child. The
[1:06:42] pretty little boy about 16 years old,
[1:06:46] little hair hanging out over his
[1:06:47] shoulder. A handsome little lad. how he
[1:06:50] loved his father and mother and just as
[1:06:52] obedient. You know, children, that's
[1:06:54] what you ought to be to your father and
[1:06:55] mother. I think it's awful when you hear
[1:06:59] young people say, "My old man and my old
[1:07:01] woman." I don't believe you people in
[1:07:03] Coran, you little children say that. We
[1:07:06] up in the Northlands where I come from,
[1:07:08] they say it. And it's too bad they ever
[1:07:10] said it. Listen, that's not the old man
[1:07:13] and old woman. Someday when the floors
[1:07:15] is squeaking and cracking and a casket's
[1:07:18] going out and you look and see a
[1:07:19] grayheaded person laying there, it won't
[1:07:22] be the old man, but your daddy, that's
[1:07:25] your mother. You honor them. Now, that's
[1:07:29] the first commandment was promised.
[1:07:31] Honor your father and mother, which may
[1:07:33] lengthen the days on the earth that the
[1:07:35] Lord giveth thee. So little Isaac being
[1:07:39] so sub subject in subjection to his
[1:07:42] father and mother because he was a type
[1:07:44] of Christ as he was the subject to the
[1:07:47] father perfectly
[1:07:49] and how he minded his father and mother
[1:07:51] and one day God said now Abraham you
[1:07:55] know way down years to come there's
[1:07:58] going to be a people all kinds of
[1:08:01] scientific things and they're going to
[1:08:03] try to disprove my word but I want to
[1:08:06] double my word. After I swore I'd keep
[1:08:09] it, I'll let you live to see the day
[1:08:13] when you was 100 years old and I turned
[1:08:16] you back to a young man of about 25, 35
[1:08:18] years old. Again, you and Sarah and he
[1:08:22] brought forth this child. You see my
[1:08:24] hand, I'm going to give an example for
[1:08:27] the people of Charlotte today for
[1:08:29] everywhere else. This how I keep my
[1:08:33] word. I'll tell you what I want you to
[1:08:36] do. Abraham,
[1:08:37] I want you to take
[1:08:40] your little boy and go to a certain
[1:08:43] mountain where I'm going to show you.
[1:08:45] And I want you to take him up there and
[1:08:46] lay him on an altar and offer him up for
[1:08:49] a sacrifice. I want you to kill him,
[1:08:52] Abraham, because in him I'm going to
[1:08:55] bless all the world.
[1:08:57] Doesn't that sound strange? How is that
[1:09:00] boy? How's Abraham now actually waiting
[1:09:04] all a hundred years to receive his child
[1:09:07] and the child being born
[1:09:10] as the last ser no more that was all of
[1:09:14] them
[1:09:15] and how
[1:09:18] could this be now after he's waited all
[1:09:21] this time in the young man here now
[1:09:23] about 16 now take him up and destroy
[1:09:28] the only hope that you
[1:09:32] of my promise being fulfilled.
[1:09:34] Wish I had just a little more voice. I
[1:09:37] just like to show you something here.
[1:09:40] Sometime God takes away everything. Let
[1:09:43] the doctor tell you you're going to die.
[1:09:45] That's right. Prove it. Scientifically
[1:09:48] show you you're going to die just to
[1:09:49] show his mercy to you.
[1:09:52] Doctor says that cancer we got nothing
[1:09:54] for it. You know, I heard on the radio
[1:09:56] the other day that there has never been
[1:09:59] one successful cancer operation.
[1:10:03] That's right. We haven't got nothing
[1:10:05] far. We have in the medical science. God
[1:10:09] has in his hands.
[1:10:12] Moses brought the children of Israel all
[1:10:14] the way through the land of Egypt. And
[1:10:17] when he come out of Egypt,
[1:10:21] just think 2 million people.
[1:10:24] And when they left Egypt, there wasn't a
[1:10:26] feeble person among them.
[1:10:29] How did he for 40 years
[1:10:33] fight cancer, tuberculosis? How many
[1:10:37] babies is born overnight?
[1:10:40] How many houses did Dr. Moses have to
[1:10:42] visit? How many broken arms and out
[1:10:45] there in that desert running around? How
[1:10:47] much pneumonia? How much malaria
[1:10:50] drinking out of ponds and whatever they
[1:10:52] could get to? How much bacteria did they
[1:10:55] pick up in those germs and things in the
[1:10:58] waters?
[1:10:59] Say doctor, wouldn't you like to look
[1:11:01] into Moses medicine kit and find out
[1:11:03] what he kept that people all well and
[1:11:06] not even their clothes got thr
[1:11:10] how many like to look in Dr. Moses
[1:11:12] medicine kit? Would you like to see it?
[1:11:14] I know where it's at in the Bible. Would
[1:11:16] you like to hear it? Raise up your hand
[1:11:18] if you will. Just a minute.
[1:11:21] I'll show you just exactly where we're
[1:11:22] at.
[1:11:24] We see what Dr. Moses said.
[1:11:31] Dr. Moses had one prescription. He kept
[1:11:34] them all well.
[1:11:37] I'm the Lord that healed all thy
[1:11:39] diseases.
[1:11:42] That's the only prescription he used.
[1:11:44] And it worked on every case.
[1:11:48] say that's a good thing for a doctor to
[1:11:49] pack in his briefcases.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; I'm the Lord who heal all night. That's
[1:11:55] what Moses used. And he kept uh people
[1:12:01] alive for 40 years and not a feeble one
[1:12:05] among them.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? Because he used
[1:12:10] God's word. You can't go wrong as long
[1:12:13] as you're using the word. Stay with the
[1:12:16] word. Now God said to Abraham, "Take
[1:12:19] your little boy out there and I'll show
[1:12:21] you a mountain and you go up on this
[1:12:23] mountain and kill him."
[1:12:26] Now what if Abraham said, "Now wait a
[1:12:27] minute. Was that vision true?" Let me
[1:12:30] study. Was that vision true? Now God
[1:12:34] said, "Take my boy and kill him."
[1:12:37] Now how am I ever going to be the father
[1:12:40] of nations? And that's my seat and
[1:12:42] that's the promise. How? How am I ever
[1:12:45] going to be the father of nation when
[1:12:47] God is destroying the only hope I have
[1:12:49] here? Is that the only hope I have? No.
[1:12:51] I still got his word. He promised me
[1:12:53] back there that he'd do it. And through
[1:12:55] Isaac, all the world would be blessed.
[1:12:57] So said, I listen to Abraham now. I
[1:13:01] received him as one from the dead. I'm
[1:13:06] persuaded that God's able to raise him
[1:13:08] up from the dead.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:13:12] Even with a horse throat, I feel
[1:13:14] religious.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:13:17] Abraham said, "If I received him as one
[1:13:21] from the dead," what? The seed in his
[1:13:23] own body was dead, 100 years old. The
[1:13:26] deadness of Sarah's womb, they were both
[1:13:28] sterile to begin with. And then if God
[1:13:32] performed a miracle and put this germ of
[1:13:34] life in there, he received him from the
[1:13:36] dead as one being dead. Then God's able
[1:13:40] to raise him up from the dead. Praise
[1:13:42] the Lord.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Perfect type of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:13:46] Hallelujah.
[1:13:48] Oh my. That would make Presbyterian
[1:13:51] shout.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Think of that. Certainly. Abraham stared
[1:13:57] not at the promises of God through
[1:13:59] unbelief, but was strong giving praise
[1:14:02] to him.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; I can imagine it was on Sunday afternoon
[1:14:07] when he spoke to him. on Monday morning.
[1:14:10] How's he going to do? Poor little Isaac.
[1:14:13] He looks at him. Oh, he loves him. But I
[1:14:15] can't look at that. I got to think of
[1:14:17] obeying God. So he couldn't tell Sarah
[1:14:21] cuz you know the ladies are the weake of
[1:14:23] the vessel. So he sometimes you had to
[1:14:25] watch. So I I can't tell Sarah cuz she
[1:14:29] wouldn't understand. Sarah never was too
[1:14:31] strong anyhow in the faith because she
[1:14:34] lacked. She didn't believe the promise.
[1:14:36] But Abraham held her because the man and
[1:14:39] woman are one. The woman cannot be saved
[1:14:41] in the Old Testament only by the man
[1:14:44] because it was circumcision and she had
[1:14:46] to be joined to her husband in order to
[1:14:48] receive it. But in the last days, God
[1:14:50] poured out his spirit and the women are
[1:14:52] circumcised in the heart. Just like the
[1:14:54] man now, but she believed her husband
[1:14:58] and called him Lord. So he said, "Now I
[1:15:01] can't I I can't tell Sarah." So he maybe
[1:15:05] say Sarah, Isaac and I are going to take
[1:15:08] a little trip. We'll be back. How are we
[1:15:11] coming back?
[1:15:14] God's able. If he said so, he'll bring
[1:15:17] us back. That's good. So he saddles up a
[1:15:21] mule the next morning, cut some wood,
[1:15:23] laid it on the mule's back. He's going
[1:15:24] out in the desert. And now look, he
[1:15:27] walked three days.
[1:15:31] And at the end of the three days, he
[1:15:32] lifted up his eyes and saw the mountain
[1:15:34] where God showed him in the vision
[1:15:37] way off.
[1:15:39] I watched an ordinary man ought to walk
[1:15:43] 25 miles a day. When I was patrolling
[1:15:46] for 5 years, I walked 35 miles a day
[1:15:49] through the woods, 10 hours, year in and
[1:15:53] year out. And today while man's got
[1:15:56] gasoline feet nearly and could do that
[1:15:59] what could a man days who only
[1:16:01] transportation he had nearly was either
[1:16:03] by a little slow mu or he could out walk
[1:16:06] himself nearly so only way he had was
[1:16:10] travel by foot and now Abraham let's say
[1:16:14] he walked 25 miles a day
[1:16:17] and he was 75 miles back now and he
[1:16:20] lifted up his eyes and perhaps maybe
[1:16:22] another 25 to 30 mi away. He saw the
[1:16:26] narrow said, "Yep, that's the one God
[1:16:28] showed me the vision." Now
[1:16:31] he said to the servants, the boys is
[1:16:34] with him. Listen to this now. He said,
[1:16:37] "You all tried here.
[1:16:42] While the boy and I go yonder to
[1:16:46] worship,
[1:16:48] the boy and I will return.
[1:16:54] Oh my.
[1:16:56] What?
[1:16:58] With a knife in his belt
[1:17:01] and in his heart to do the will of God
[1:17:03] was going to kill his own son.
[1:17:07] You wait here.
[1:17:09] The boy and I are going yonder to
[1:17:12] worship. The boy and I will return.
[1:17:17] How?
[1:17:19] He know God would keep his word
[1:17:20] somewhere. On they go up to the top of
[1:17:24] the mountain. Now watch. When he got to
[1:17:26] the mountain, he took all this wood and
[1:17:28] laid it on Isaac's back. Wonder why he
[1:17:31] done all those things?
[1:17:34] Because he was a figure of Christ. Isaac
[1:17:37] packed the wood up the hill that he
[1:17:40] himself was the sacrifice to lay on.
[1:17:43] Christ packed the cross up the hill
[1:17:46] where he the sacrifice is to be laid on.
[1:17:51] Abraham
[1:17:52] shadow of God the father given his only
[1:17:55] begotten son for our sins. Abraham was
[1:17:59] giving his only son for uh obedience to
[1:18:04] God.
[1:18:05] Notice now as he go up the hill, Abraham
[1:18:09] packing the fire.
[1:18:11] And when he got up there, he said,
[1:18:14] "Father,"
[1:18:16] he said, "Here I am."
[1:18:19] He said, "Here is the wood
[1:18:23] and here is the fire.
[1:18:27] Here is the altar,
[1:18:29] but where is the lamb for the sacrifice?
[1:18:35] Oh, could you imagine that father's
[1:18:38] heart pumping hard? His only child.
[1:18:42] Where is the sacrifice?
[1:18:46] Abraham choking back the tears. Think of
[1:18:49] your own self. Choking back the tears.
[1:18:52] Well, let's turn and look towards
[1:18:54] heaven.
[1:18:55] He said, "My son,
[1:18:57] God will provide for himself a lamb for
[1:19:02] the sacrifice." Amen.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; I'm not emotional much, but that just
[1:19:11] gets me.
[1:19:13] God will provide for himself a sacrifice
[1:19:19] or a lamb for the sacrifice.
[1:19:21] So, turn around, Isaac. Turn your back
[1:19:24] to me, son. He did. Isaac thought,
[1:19:27] "What's this?
[1:19:29] It's leather cards taking my hands.
[1:19:32] Surely father understands what he's
[1:19:35] doing. Around his feet, went some cards,
[1:19:39] tied him together. He looked over.
[1:19:42] Abraham, looked at him, brushed back the
[1:19:46] hair out of his eyes, kissed him on the
[1:19:48] cheek. God be with you, my son. Laid him
[1:19:53] up on the altar,
[1:19:55] looked back, choking back the tears.
[1:19:57] Little Isaac, obedient to death, not
[1:19:59] asked him a question. Abraham pulled a
[1:20:01] big knife from his the sheath from the
[1:20:05] knife from the sheath, brushed back the
[1:20:08] hair away from his little neck,
[1:20:10] looked up to God and started to take the
[1:20:13] life of his own son. Just as he raised
[1:20:16] his hand, the Holy Ghost called his
[1:20:19] handb
[1:20:25] for I know now that you love me, not
[1:20:28] even to spare your own son. And about
[1:20:30] that time,
[1:20:35] oh God,
[1:20:39] a sacrifice bladed.
[1:20:42] A little ram,
[1:20:43] not a female, not a yo, a ram
[1:20:48] was caught in the wilderness by his
[1:20:50] homeworks.
[1:20:54] What was it Jehovah Gi had provided of
[1:20:58] him?
[1:20:59] Where'd that lamb come from?
[1:21:02] Where did that lamb come from, friends?
[1:21:07] You know what it was? Well, he was 100
[1:21:10] miles from civilization.
[1:21:13] Where did it come from? Besides that,
[1:21:16] he's way up on top of the mountain where
[1:21:17] there's no water.
[1:21:20] Where did it come from? It wasn't a
[1:21:22] vision. hour. He took the ram, loosed
[1:21:26] Isaac, his son, laid the ram up, and cut
[1:21:28] it short, and blood run out of it. It
[1:21:31] was a real ram,
[1:21:34] not a myth,
[1:21:36] neither a vision. It was a real ram.
[1:21:39] What was it? The God that I spoke to the
[1:21:42] other night had brought himself down in
[1:21:43] flesh, had brought a ram there.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Jehovah Gyra had provided a ram for the
[1:21:51] sacrifice.
[1:21:53] I say to you this afternoon, my
[1:21:55] Christian friend, that Jehovah Gyra,
[1:21:58] still exist.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; And that's lamb which was a type of the
[1:22:04] Lord Jesus Christ that came down from
[1:22:08] glory, made itself a little lower than
[1:22:10] angels to suffer death for all. Has
[1:22:14] provided for everything that you have
[1:22:16] need of this afternoon, and has provided
[1:22:19] for your salvation. He's providing for
[1:22:22] your healing. And besides that, he said,
[1:22:25] "I'll not leave you. I'll pray to the
[1:22:27] father and he'll send you another
[1:22:29] comforter, which is the Holy Ghost. He
[1:22:30] will abide with you forever. And the
[1:22:33] things that I do shall you also, even
[1:22:36] more than this, for I go to my father."
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Jehovah
[1:22:40] Jalai has provided a sacrifice this
[1:22:44] afternoon for your sin. Jehovah Gyra has
[1:22:49] provided the same lamb this afternoon
[1:22:52] for your sickness. Can you believe it?
[1:22:55] And will you believe it? When Jesus is
[1:22:58] here on earth, he said, "A little while
[1:23:00] and the world won't see me no more
[1:23:02] because I come from God
[1:23:06] spirit."
[1:23:10] And now I in the world a little while.
[1:23:13] And now I go back to God.
[1:23:17] Then I'll come again and be with you in
[1:23:20] the form of the Holy Ghost in you to the
[1:23:23] end of the world.
[1:23:26] And he that believeth on me, the works
[1:23:31] that I do shall he do also.
[1:23:35] Now he shared God has provided a way for
[1:23:38] you. God's provided a sacrifice. He's
[1:23:41] Jehovah Jarai who provided for Abraham
[1:23:44] carried through. And you are the seed of
[1:23:47] Abraham as long as you're in Christ
[1:23:50] Jesus. You are the seed of Abraham. And
[1:23:54] you're hes of the same promise by the
[1:23:57] same God only in a more positive way
[1:24:00] than Abraham was.
[1:24:03] You got about 2,800 years of experiences
[1:24:07] to look back through others and see what
[1:24:10] he's done. And if the Old Testament
[1:24:12] provided that, how much better did the
[1:24:15] new covenant a better thing
[1:24:18] that we without them would not be made
[1:24:20] perfect or them without us rather would
[1:24:23] not be made perfect. God has provided. I
[1:24:26] trust that you will believe it with all
[1:24:28] your heart as we pray.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. We thank God for his word tonight.
[1:24:40] Amen. So nice.
[1:24:45] Um,
[1:24:46] Sister Mother Wheeler passed on just a
[1:24:49] while ago and um, I got this news from
[1:24:53] brother Chris. So, we want to keep the
[1:24:54] Wheeler family in prayer.
[1:24:58] So, remember them. Very special request.
[1:25:01] First Corinthians
[1:25:03] chapter 11. as we go to the table of the
[1:25:06] Lord
[1:25:09] and um stand with me
[1:25:13] in verse number 23.
[1:25:17] The brothers can help move the altar in
[1:25:20] I guess you'll plan to do that
[1:25:22] appropriate time. Thank you.
[1:25:29] Let's sing a chorus of Amazing Grace.
[1:25:32] [Music]
[1:25:37] Secret grace
[1:25:42] the sound
[1:25:45] that
[1:25:46] [Music]
[1:25:51] I
[1:25:53] [Music]
[1:26:00] was lost.
[1:26:03] But now,
[1:26:05] [Music]
[1:26:12] but now
[1:26:15] I see.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Can we lift our hands and just praise
[1:26:19] the Lord?
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:26:24] Praise God.
[1:26:27] Praise Lord. We give you praise tonight.
[1:26:31] We worship you Lord
[1:26:33] in spirit and in truth.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; It's still over Gyra.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:44] Praise God.
[1:26:47] Praise God.
[1:26:50] Praise God.
[1:26:53] Praise God.
[1:26:56] Praise God.
[1:26:59] Praise God.
[1:27:03] Praise God.
[1:27:05] Amen.
[1:27:07] For I have received of the Lord that
[1:27:09] which also I delivered unto you, that
[1:27:11] the Lord Jesus the same night in which
[1:27:13] he was betrayed, took bread, when he had
[1:27:16] given thanks, he broke it and said,
[1:27:18] "Take, eat. This is my body which is
[1:27:21] broken for you. This do in remembrance
[1:27:24] of me. And after the same manner also he
[1:27:27] took the cup when he had sucked, saying,
[1:27:30] "This cup is the new testament in my
[1:27:32] blood. This do ye as of as you drink it
[1:27:36] in remembrance of me. For as often as
[1:27:39] you eat this bread and drink this cup,
[1:27:42] you to show the Lord's death till he
[1:27:43] come. Wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:27:46] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:27:48] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:27:51] and blood of the Lord.
[1:27:53] But let a man examine himself, and so
[1:27:55] let him eat of that bread and drink of
[1:27:57] that cup. For he that eateth and
[1:27:59] drinkkeeth unworthily, eateth and
[1:28:01] drinkkeeth, damnation to himself, not
[1:28:04] discerning the Lord's body. For this
[1:28:07] cause many are weak and sickly among
[1:28:10] you, many sleep. For if we would judge
[1:28:13] ourselves, we should not be judged. But
[1:28:16] when we are judged, we are chasened of
[1:28:18] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:28:21] with the world. Wherefore my brethren,
[1:28:24] when you come together to eat, one for
[1:28:26] another. If any man hunger, let him eat
[1:28:29] at home, that you come not together unto
[1:28:31] condemnation, and the rest will I set in
[1:28:35] order when I come. Amen. This is one of
[1:28:38] the orders that the Apostle Paul was
[1:28:40] bringing to the church. He brought order
[1:28:43] to the communion service. I like how he
[1:28:46] says to be chasened of the Lord that we
[1:28:49] should not be condemned with the world.
[1:28:53] And every time we hear the word of God,
[1:28:55] it is chasening us, sharpening us, and
[1:28:58] making us ready for that soon rapture.
[1:29:00] Amen.
[1:29:02] So, let us t one for another. You pray
[1:29:05] for me, I'll pray for you. Um, many
[1:29:09] times I would take this service over to
[1:29:12] Mother Wheeler, Sister Jackie. I go
[1:29:14] right into their home, read this little
[1:29:16] service, and have a communion service
[1:29:19] for them.
[1:29:21] And for the few months. I haven't been
[1:29:24] able to go and do that, but I believe
[1:29:26] she continued. Brother Dan Evans would
[1:29:29] go and she was just a witness of
[1:29:33] she couldn't get up and leave from the
[1:29:35] house, but she held on as a believer. It
[1:29:38] was so sweet to see her and served the
[1:29:41] communion to her. Sometimes I would sing
[1:29:43] one song and she would always say, "I
[1:29:47] don't know why I'm still here."
[1:29:50] should always be talking like that for
[1:29:52] years. Well, now she's gone on to get
[1:29:54] her reward. We believe. Amen. And so,
[1:29:58] let's t one for another as we bow our
[1:30:00] head in silent prayer.
[1:30:38] Heavenly Father, in my hands I hold this
[1:30:41] bread that was made for this service and
[1:30:43] we consecrated it, Lord, by asking your
[1:30:46] blessing on it. Lord, we know that it's
[1:30:50] just the ingredients from the grain to
[1:30:53] the bread. service, but it has a type
[1:30:57] and a meaning behind it. It's a type of
[1:31:00] your word. It's a type of your body.
[1:31:03] It's a type of the bitter
[1:31:06] price that was paid at Calvary. Lord, as
[1:31:09] we partake of it tonight, we know that
[1:31:12] it represents your body. It's just a
[1:31:16] representation.
[1:31:18] And you commanded us to do it until you
[1:31:21] call us home. And you said in that great
[1:31:24] kingdom, in the land in the millennium,
[1:31:27] in the great wedding supper, we would
[1:31:29] eat and drink of the vine over there.
[1:31:33] But Lord, until we come, you told us to
[1:31:35] tar. And this bread is made for that
[1:31:38] service that you commanded us. Lord, we
[1:31:42] just want to be obedient.
[1:31:44] We ask that you'll bless everyone that
[1:31:46] would take their hand down to pick this
[1:31:48] up and put it in their body. And may
[1:31:51] they be putting in more of the obedience
[1:31:55] to your word in their spirit. May they
[1:31:58] receive the blessings of that. May they
[1:32:00] receive the strength that comes from the
[1:32:03] word of God. It's our prayer shows to
[1:32:06] the believers that we believe every word
[1:32:08] now. Blessed father in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:32:19] Heavenly Father, in my hands I hold the
[1:32:22] cup of the New Testament of your blood.
[1:32:25] It's the blood of the grapes. It
[1:32:29] represents your body. It represents your
[1:32:32] blood tonight. And we ask that you would
[1:32:35] bless it. May everyone that partake,
[1:32:38] Lord, receive the blessings that comes
[1:32:41] with
[1:32:43] being obedient to your word. We know
[1:32:45] this is divine healing. We know that
[1:32:48] this is a promise. And father, may each
[1:32:52] one receive that blessing, not just a
[1:32:54] ritual. Lord, let it be life to us. In
[1:32:58] Jesus name we pray. Amen. God bless. You
[1:33:02] may be seated. Follow the directions of
[1:33:05] the ushers.
[1:33:09] [Music]
[1:35:04] [Music]
[1:37:05] Hallelujah.
[1:37:06] Hallelujah.

[1:37:36] [Music]
[1:40:38] [Music]
[1:41:59] [Music]
[1:42:29] Amen.
[1:42:31] This portion of bread will be burned
[1:42:33] with fire before the rising of the sun.
[1:42:35] Amen.
[1:42:36] Let's all stand and take our Bibles.
[1:42:38] Turn to St. John chapter 13.
[1:43:03] Verse number two.
[1:43:06] The supper being ended, the devil helmet
[1:43:09] now put into the heart of Judas the
[1:43:11] Scariot, Simon's son, to betray him.
[1:43:14] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:43:16] all things into his hands, that he was
[1:43:18] come from God, and he went to God. He
[1:43:21] riseth from supper, laid aside his
[1:43:24] garments. He took a towel and girded
[1:43:26] himself. Let's read al together verse
[1:43:29] number five all the way through. And
[1:43:31] after that he pou water into a basin and
[1:43:35] began to wash the disciples feet and to
[1:43:38] wipe them with the towel wherewith he
[1:43:40] was girded. Then cometh he to Simon
[1:43:44] Peter. And Peter said unto him, Lord,
[1:43:47] dust thou wash my feet? Jesus answered
[1:43:51] and said unto him, What I do, thou
[1:43:53] knowest not now, but thou shalt know
[1:43:56] hereafter? Peter saith unto him, "Thou
[1:44:00] shalt never wash my feet." Jesus
[1:44:03] answered him, "If I wash thee not, thou
[1:44:06] hast no part with me." Simon Peter saith
[1:44:10] unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but
[1:44:13] also my hands and my head. Jesus said to
[1:44:17] him, "He that is washed needeth not
[1:44:20] saved to wash his feet, but is clean
[1:44:23] every wit, and ye are clean, but not
[1:44:26] all. for he knew who should betray him.
[1:44:30] Therefore said he, "Ye are not all
[1:44:32] clean." So after he had washed their
[1:44:35] feet, and had taken his garments, and
[1:44:38] was set down again, he said unto them,
[1:44:41] "Know ye what I have done to you. You
[1:44:44] call me Master and Lord, and ye say
[1:44:47] well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord
[1:44:51] and Master, have washed your feet, you
[1:44:54] also ought to wash one another's feet.
[1:44:58] For I have given you an example, that
[1:45:00] you should do as I have done to you.
[1:45:04] Verily, verily, I say unto you, the
[1:45:07] servant is not greater than his Lord,
[1:45:10] neither he that is sent greater than he
[1:45:12] that sent him. If you know these things,
[1:45:16] happy are ye if you do them. Amen. Thank
[1:45:20] God for the reading of his word. It's so
[1:45:23] nice to hear the voices read the word of
[1:45:28] God. Amen.
[1:45:30] Just a closer walk with thee. Let's sing
[1:45:33] a little bit of that.
[1:45:35] I
[1:45:37] am weak, but thou are strong.
[1:45:46] Jesus
[1:45:47] [Music]
[1:45:48] keep me from all
[1:45:56] and I'll
[1:45:59] be satisfied
[1:46:01] as long
[1:46:06] as I walk.
[1:46:09] Let me along
[1:46:12] close to thee.
[1:46:18] Oh, just
[1:46:21] close
[1:46:23] with thee.
[1:46:26] Hallelujah.
[1:46:29] And
[1:46:32] Jesus
[1:46:33] is my
[1:46:36] [Music]
[1:46:40] [Applause]

[1:47:04] this world of false
[1:47:09] [Music]

[1:47:15] my
[1:47:18] Lord who cares
[1:47:24] and You
[1:47:27] may be my
[1:47:30] [Music]
[1:47:35] but
[1:47:38] [Music]
[1:47:46] then just
[1:47:49] closer
[1:47:51] with me.
[1:47:53] [Music]
[1:47:58] Great.
[1:48:00] Jesus
[1:48:02] is my king.
[1:48:05] [Music]
[1:48:11] Walking close to you.
[1:48:19] Let it be.
[1:48:21] [Music]
[1:48:24] Let it be that my life is over.
[1:48:31] And when
[1:48:33] my people
[1:48:42] and time
[1:48:44] for me will be
[1:48:53] Lord I
[1:48:56] need

[1:49:30] that Jesus
[1:49:32] is my
[1:49:35] [Music]
[1:49:39] Let
[1:49:41] me walk close to thee.
[1:49:49] Let it be.
[1:49:52] [Music]
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that last verse thinking of
[1:50:00] the Wheeler.
[1:50:02] And when
[1:50:04] my people
[1:50:06] life is over
[1:50:13] and time
[1:50:15] for me will be known.
[1:50:20] [Music]
[1:50:24] Lord God
[1:50:27] be gently
[1:50:29] safely over
[1:50:35] to thy king
[1:50:38] of soul
[1:50:41] to thy soul.
[1:50:45] God bless you. Amen.
