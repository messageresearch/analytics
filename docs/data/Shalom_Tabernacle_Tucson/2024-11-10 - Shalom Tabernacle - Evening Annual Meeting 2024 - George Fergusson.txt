here somewhere brother Ted huh oh he didn't come back all right um we probably met him I would say about maybe 40 years ago he came to men and M we had a wonderful time together and we always cherish those moments and you know I was just I think it was probably one year after we got married Sharon was just a little baby at the time and brother Ted brother Ted cman what a wonderful time we had and my I was so blessed to hear him last night I this my he's just a different kind of preacher but we all enjoyed it we oh what a blessing i Bill brother Paul what a blessing amen and my I sat there and I I took several notes from some of the stuff he was saying you know he just went from here and he was able to P all of that together my what a preacher you know I I just pull me you know get it up at the pit and I've always told the church back home and says you know I don't have a gift to speak like some of the brothers you know I I have to realize so much on the anointing I have to pray and beg the Lord and if the anointing is not that just makes it so hard and it's true because I remember I was I came out of Africa you know you go into different types of anointings you brothers who travel know what I'm talking about you know you get into a missionary type anointing and you come back and you know to move from one anointing to the other is kind of hard but brother Brandon told us about that and do you Believers that are here you know all of us as Christians we understand as we move into the supernatural we understand these different things and tonight I'm not going to be talking about that though but I came back I was kind of pulling out of the I was pulling out of trying to get out from the missionary type anointing to get back into the pastor or take you of to work back home and it looked like I just had a hard time to get my mind off Africa I remember when I went the first times you know I'd come home and Shan was a little girl at the time and marinata and Gracie and I'd been gone for weeks cuz it was so much was during the time of the war and I was kind of talking to Bill lingar and brother de perbly let him know how the Lord kind of trained me in cuz I passed I I passed a part of my life in the tropical forest to kind of prepare me for that when I went into those times you and some of the most brutal Wars I was in Angola during the most one of the most brutal wars in the Congo I was there during the time of the war and it was really something that the Lord just helped me to be able to go and sometimes when I get back out my mind is just so much on it you know and you know elizel come and she says you know Fergie and you want to talk about the children and and I would s just you know I can't I can't my mind is just so much H my spirit is still in Africa if you understand it in the spiritual sense of it you know I go to Jeffersonville and give the whole reports some what's going on and you know we need this amount of messages to be sent here and how we could send the tapes here and how we could send there and all the things what the Lord has done and God is just working a mighty way and you know to see what he has done is just amazing amen and I've I've often stop sometimes to share few testimonies with you just before going before the message but tonight I think I'm going to you know I'm going to go almost direct to the message but I I'm kind of tempted to share one with you I think I did before and maybe some of you that I hear probably never heard this testimony before what I I think I'll just share it again with you all but it concerned a a Swedish a Swedish missionary that traveled into Africa and he thought you know he would go there and evangelize or missionary the Africans so he thought the best way to do it was to buy some land and build a house and employ the natives to cult make some cultivation and cultivate some crops and stuff so he built a big house with enough room you know brother George so he could the people the natives the people who work on the farm could sleep there and stuff build a very big house and then he employed these people but he noticed among the workers there was a one worker that was different to all the rest so he called this this worker in and he says I notice you're different to all the rest you're honest I could trust you you know you're such a hard worker uh what makes you so different and then the little worker said he said you know I read the books of a man called William Maran Brandon and it changed my life well the missionary didn't like to hear that thing William brandom say he says brandom so the missionary said it changed the little brother said it changed all my life so one day the missionary the Swedish missionary called his brother in and he said to him he said listen he says he says you're my best worker and he says if you will burn these books of brandham these brandham books he said I'll pay you more money and the little brother said said he said listen sir he says I can't burn those books he said I read those books and my whole life was changed so he said you're my boss he said you can do whatever you want if you want to find me whatever he says you're my boss he said I can't burn those books so this kind of you know irritated the Swedish missionary little B he wasn't happy so one day when the workers was out in the fields the Swedish missionary went into the room where this brother was staying he took all the books of brother brandom and he put it outside he poured a little bit of gasoline he pour some gasoline on that those books and he LD the books of fire and while the books were burning a wind came and blew the fire on his house and burned the whole house down and then this beish missionary saw that he smacked up everything he had left Africa and we never heard about this man again touch not man on be careful what you do with the word of the Lord see that God has done wonderful things amen I there was a little testimony I think maybe brother Paul you probably heard me say it because I shared it on a lot of the cat Division and maybe I'll just share that one with you and then be go to the word and of course just before wife for got I'm so happy my wife came with me and she wasn't feeling well and we prayed for her and tonight she feels much better and there's brother Luke and sister Stephanie with me and brother Luke has started to minister he's president of our trusty board and he started to minister so we simply honored to have him anybody share with you one R this is a testimony that has already trilled the hearts of people in different countries of the world where we had the cast Division I remember when we were in guara Andy in in in in Mexico when we were in St Petersburg on the last flag of the C division tour and also in Belgium and in uh in England when we had the cash division tour I shared this testimonies this testimony in different places and it was always a blessing but what it was is that we had sent voice of God had sent a huge shipment it was one of the largest shipment at the time that we ever sent to Africa and we sent it to [Music] Cameroon so when the shipment got in I think we had about 28,000 tapes on that shipment uh different tapes if I remember right maybe it could have been less than that and about 72 or 75,000 booket messages that we sent it was huge it was not just for Cameroon we included Cameroon the country of Chad and also central Africa Republic so and also goria so the shipment went through the so when it got in Cameroon the head of the Customs called our our local representative and he told him he said hey he says you know uh the charge if I remember right I don't remember the exact amount I think it was something like uh 28% of all the the day evaluation of the books and I think if I remember right it was probably about 70 75% of their evaluation of the tipes so the evaluation came up at the time to over $50,000 so I called that I talked about for Joseph and I said Brother Joseph he said brother F what are we going to do I said we pray I says God do promise to answer prayer so we prayed and what happened brother George is that when the the shipment arriv and the Customs official because our local Representatives say well you know what can we do you know to get the exemption because this is this is religious materials so he said well the only thing I can tell you is go to the ministry of Justice the ministry of justice is in another city called Yi between between you and the is about two hours drive and the mission the local representative said so you know how it works here it will take months he said that's not our problem he says if you want he said you either pay pay the duties or you go to the ministry of justice so while we were praying a strange thing happened the Vatican Center container to Cameroon and the papers for the container from the Vatican got mixed up with our papers now now there's no sometime things get mixed up and you think it's wrong but sometime it's a blessing God knows exactly how we work things out so the Catholic priest went to the custom official he said official representative of the Vatican he says we want our container to be released so the the head of the custom official says he says well I don't have the authority to release it taxfree he says you need to take these documents to the ministry of Justice in onlyi so the Catholic priest now didn't check the documents to see what it was all about all what was in there he took the file from the custom official jumped in his car and rushed off the Y because they had to get that container that Vatican City Senter out quickly he went into the Customs officials and Y the ministry of Justice he said official representative of the Vatican he said we request that our container be Exempted from all taxes duties fees of the government of Cameroon been a Rome spee you know what happened I S Ministry of Justice because was urgent but but he didn't check all the papers to see what it was he put on the stamp Exempted Exempted Exempted Exempted from all the taxes duties fees of the government of Cameroon and he handed the papers back to the Catholic priest the Catholic priest didn't check it because he knew that the ministry of Justice given he jumped in his Sky and rush back TOA and he handed it to the Customs officials when the custom official opened it there was all the documents of voice of God for all those States thousands of States thousands of books tax Exempted tax Exempted so he called them our local official said come and get your stuff so God knows exactly what he does Amen to get his word all over and how happy we are amen you know these are testimonies I could you know share many of them with you there so many testimonies of the things that God has done and we know that it's not us it's what he has done for us and we're grateful to him now tonight I have a little message on my heart and you know sometimes you travel in places and you get a you think in your heart you're going to speak on a subject that will be a blessing to everyone and then to your surprise some people get a little IR irritable and they say well one brother tell me Well you not placing the quotes right I said brother I don't know I says all I could all I know to do is read the quotes and say Lord you you place it right I don't know he is he said it's the quotes truth the quot but you're not BL I said but please I don't know I said tonight I'm going to read for you and share with you some scriptures and some quotes and I trust that you love me after I trust that it'll be a Revival and a blessing for you I sat in the meeting and I I heard brother Paul speak and brother I say Paul me you know I kind of felt a little sorry for myself coming up after these brothers because really it was a tremendous message that you know I've heard brother Paul speak many times I think that was one of the best I've ever heard him and it was really it was not him I think it was really the Lord to Jes our brother and certainly we do appreciate it we can really one of the things we can do we can truly appreciate it when we see the hand of the Lord using a brother to to bring something that is a blessing to the people now tonight um I know that the theme is love and stuff and I I'll probably talk a little bit about it but I'll go into it in a slightly different direction tonight the direction is going to be different to brother Paul different to brother Ted last night and just stress it will be a blessing to you this subject I want to share with you has a personal appeal to me because since I've been around this message I've heard people talk about you know I've heard them say well the Lord revealed to me and the Lord revealed to me and the Lord reveal and sometimes I've seen people that tell me said brother you know why do you believe this this this this this and then they say well it's a revelation brother and then I some of it I can see it's the truth and then some of it I was puzzled and I remember when I came in into this message from the Jesus name Pentecostals I was just 21 years old at the time and I wasn't married at the time and um I was an evangelist working for the several Pentecostal moves if I were call it the Jesus name Pentecostals at the time and even trinitarian Pentecostals uh preached in many in some of the conventions among them I remember I preached in the convention with Bishop Johnson who was the Bish Bishop of the Church of our Lord Jesus Christ and Bishop Lawson who was a a bishop of the Church of our Lord Jesus Christ Bible Way and some of the Bishops of the Church of our Lord Jesus Christ Apostolic Faith we had meetings and I spoke in their conventions and we had campaigns to speak and stuff and I wasn't in the message and when I came to the message in you years they still invited me to come so I had open doors to go to several denominations but this word when I begin to read the message and hear the tapes of brother bam this word revelation has always been a something that kind of if I would bring a personal confession something that kind of puzzled me a little bit I said Lord this maybe there's something about it that um I just don't seem true the hears this might sound strange of me telling you this in this way I just don't seem to be in the H it looked like I've looked at it I've heard many we just talk about it I've heard people in the message say that the Lord revealed this to them and revealed that to them and I've even felt like that in my own self Lord you know you you know I know you revealed it to me I know that but then there was always just a little element there that I I didn't seem to be able to really put my finger on to really be able to until a couple of weeks ago that the Lord already dealt with me and I saw some things and I really feel in my heart that for the first time I'm able to stand at the puppet and to be able to speak to you all in a way that I wasn't probably was not able to before because I saw some things concerning Revelation that really changeed my whole concept and one of the things that we do thank the Lord for as I go into the word is that as Christians that those Junctions and changes in our lives means a lot to us that there are times that we going in a certain direction and the Holy Spirit seem the changes and we know in our hearts it's not us it's not something something we imagine but it's really that the lord it's what the Lord does because to me you know we can do whatever we want I can do like I've always thr the church back home I can pray and pray and pray and pray you can pray and pray and pray and the most important part of a prayer is not you saying it and not me saying it but it's when God answers it's what God does so the emphasis shifts from us to him and uh I kind of like the emphasis brother Paul put on that and I really certainly thank the Lord and tonight I'm going to go in a certain direction and uh I trust I really trust with all my heart it will be a blessing to you and I'll try my best as I used to say in a funny way I'll try my best to take my time and hurry up so I won't hold you all too too long so I trust the Lord that he will help me with that now I got SCS of scriptures and I do not believe that we'll be able to finish this subject tonight it's just too much I got many many scriptures and I trust that it will be a blessing to you okay now I I pray the Lord that he would help me to make it as simple as possible to you because I I you know I'm not here to criticize complicated preaching I've heard preachers preach and when they preach you scratch your head after because it's so complicated one brother was in Europe and he preached at a convention and nobody was able to catch anything what he said and some of the people said said well he preached so deep yeah that nobody was able to but to me that's not deep preaching you know the prophet tell us that the deeper you go in God the simple it gets and what caused people to think it's complicated because brother Brandon said that even the scribes and far as these made it complicated man loves to make because man knows as the prophet says man knows that God is so great that you think it's complicated it's not complicated it is simple but hidden you see God hides it and then when he when he when he opens your eyes and you see it wow it's so simple he says wow that is so simple amen and we are certainly grateful to God for it so tonight I my prayer is that he would help me to be able to bring it to you in a simple way and trust the Lord that at the end of this service when you leave you're going to leave with something not from me but something from him you see and that's the most important thing is what you receive from him because what do what do we have to give you nothing what say he have to give you everything and if we can bring something it's not us it's he using us and that's what we want to do it's him to use us to be able to be a blessing to you here tonight amen God bless you all now we will take a scripture and I want to show you a pattern running through the entire scriptures and we would look at that and talk a little bit about it and we will stand at this time and we will look at the book of the the the the um the book of of Isaiah Isaiah chapter 550 I'm sorry not F yeah yeah Isaiah chapter 55 from verse 10 for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and return it not th but water it the Earth and make it bring forth in blood that it may give seed to the SE and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where unto I sent it and then I'd like to take a little other scripture here which is Matthew chap 23 and verse 37 oh Jerusalem Matthew 23 and verse 37 oh Jerusalem Jerusalem thou that killest the prophets and stonest them which have sent unto thee how often will I have gather thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings and ye would not and then another little scripture found in Luke chapter 18 that's for our Day verse 7 and 8 Luke 18: 7 and 8 and shall not God avenge his own elect which CED day and night unto him though he be along with them I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth that's right oh god of Heaven may you bless your word may you help us Lord as we look at the Simplicity of this message tonight we thank you and we glorify you in Jesus name amen God bless you you can be seated now now all of us I believe that almost all of us here if not all of us here tonight you know we say that we are message Believers and even me to I I am a message believer but what is the message what is the message because if we tell someone if you go up to someone and say he's a Baptist or he's a Catholic and say I'm a message believer I would think the mind would look at you and he he doesn't understand what he's trying to say and to him what are you trying to tell me what are you trying to say you're a message believer what does that mean but if we look at what that does that mean when we say that we a message Believers we know that this Bible that we've got here I've got in my hands here this Bible here it's got two important phases to this Bible god promise and God fulfill before he fulfills it he promis and when he promises it he fulfills it he fulfills what he has promised well we see a pattern running through the entire scriptures that touches Us in this day and that is this people when they see God make a promise hold to the promise and reject the manifestation of the promise now which is strange because life comes by when the word of God is manifested that's what the prophet tell us in the message turn on the light but before we look into all of that I want to go back and look at the pattern running through the scriptures now when we we all know that Moses and brother bam told us this Moses had the Scrolls and the children of Israel had the Scrolls so Israel knew that God was going to deliver them right they knew that God was going to deliver them and then God came down filled in a pillar of fire and Called Moses now Moses had the Scrolls and he knew that he was the deliverer that's he also knew that God had raised him up to deliver the children of of Israel of course all of us here tonight we're aware of that but when Moses met God in Exodus 4 listen close now because we're going to go deep into this in Exodus chapter 4 and Moses answer because God says I heard the the cries of my people and I come now to deliver them God had given them a promise of Deliverance and God was going to honor his promise because God will always keep his word God always keeps his word amen now and when uh God came down and spoke to Moses in Exodus 4 and Moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken un my voice for they will say the Lord had not appeared unto thee so what Moses told God God didn't tell Moses Moses you're wrong because Moses has already went to the children of Israel 40 years before that and what happened they had rejected him and then Moses spread into the wilderness we all know that we all we're aware of that we know that that is the scripture so when God when Moses told that to God in Exodus 4:2 and the Lord said unto him what is that in thine hand and he said a and he said cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and become a serpent and Moses fled from before it and then God spoke back and God says it shall come to pass in verse 8 if they will not believe the the neither hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the latter sign so God gave Moses two signs to the children of Israel to prove that his Commission because Moses had met the of fire now and Moses was God had commissioned him to go God was commissioning him God says go do it Moses and Moses was already excused he said no they believe me so God says I'm giving you the signs and these scientists identified that I sent you now when Moses went down to Egypt I mean to Egypt in Exodus chapter if you look at it here Exodus chapter 4 verse 30 and 31 and Aaron this is what happened and Aaron spake all the words I'm going to go back to Exodus chapter 4 I'm sorry in my Bible because I got from verse 30 here on my notes but I'll go back a little further on it and um we will read a little a little further up okay are you with me tonight now I love to hear amen sir could you give me an amen that sounds good all right now let's go to now don't say Amen if you don't agree but if you really agree and you being blessed you can say Amen all right we get into that a little while I know that on some of the things I might say tonight I might probably not have much amens but that's all right all right let's see here now Exodus 4 and we go to verse 30 verse 29 and Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the Elders of the children of Israel and Aaron spake all the words which the Lord had spoken un Moses and did the signs in the sight of the people and the people believed and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel and that he had looked upon their affliction then they bow their heads and worshiped did Israel believe did Israel believe I'm you hesitation the Bible said they believe that Israel believe yeah they believe did Israel believe no sir you said brother person you're contradicting the Bible all right all right let's go to the Bible let's go to Hebrews chapter 3 you says I'm not go I'm not going to listen to you brother Ferguson you contradicting the Bible all right good let's see what Paul says Hebrews chapter 3 from verse 17 but with whom was he grieved 40 years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness and to whom sway that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believed that believed I'm not hearing that I'm not hearing I'm not hearing the voice I'm not hearing you say nothing to me but to those who believe not let's go further let us therefore fear L A Promise left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it so did Israel believe now you don't know what the answer did Israel believe no what happened how come Exodus said they believe here is what the prophet of God tell us and we're going to quote another scripture to prove it the scripture is in Jude Israel started off as believers they started off this is the danger they started off as Believers two million strong now I'm going to read for you what happened to Israel and we'll show you a pattern running through the entire scriptures on that okay so that everybody will begin to see and trust it will be a blessing to you amen amen I'm not hearing a big amen there what's the matter amen amen did Israel believe yes that Israel believe no let's see what the prophet says what it happened I'll read it for you ain't he wonderful to us yes sir yes sir now you're not saying amen all right we're going to you're going to be saying amen just now we're going to we're going to get a few amens out of you just now and you'll see it as we go further then then you're going to see really what we're trying to say okay ever present water from the Rock brother bam says then what kind of people ought we to be having faith in this great redeeming Christ that lives in US amen the smitten rock that never leaves the church I'm with you always even to the end of the world the ever presence of the Great gusher of Salvation and power that poured forth from Calvary into the church amen the ever presence of the Living God the great fluence smitten rock that goes with us in our journey and brother bam talks about Israel now Israel lost their faith they got off the path they begin to last for the flesh Parts if they had stayed with faith and believing that God was going to take them to the land they would have been nothing hinder them they had already opened up Seas they had smoked plagues upon the enemies they had crucified the enemies behind them and had walked over into the land and still couldn't have faith to go into the promise then brother bam says he quoted the scripture here in Jude if you want I'm going to just read the quote for you quick I don't want to spend too much time on it because what we see Happening Here Exodus is a pattern running through the entire scriptures um over in in the message those that are in prison now brother Bram says here now let's read over in the book of Jude first I believe I have marked on here for the first place in Jude and then over in second Peter then brother brandham goes on I'm going to skip a little bit he quotes Jude where Jude says I will therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this how that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterwards destroyed them that believe not so God saved them so the people says did God save me yes I was saved and then God turned around around and destroyed them who he saved because of unbelief let me continue let me continue here with you because see God had made the promise and here God fulfilled the promise before them and when God fulfilled the promise before Israel instead of Israel accepting the Fulfillment because when Moses appeared on the scene that was the Fulfillment of the promise that's right that's right and life comes by the word of God made manifest now let me read it for you he said saved them first brought them out of Egypt and then have to destroy them because they didn't continue with their message you see it you see they didn't continue on with their message Israel lost their faith yes now this is something we see throughout the scriptures all we see it with Moses we see we see what happened with uh in the time of of of Samuel when Samuel came all right when Israel rejected Samuel we saw what happened one of the things that really touched my heart and almost brought tears to my eyes is what I read Daniel chapter 9 we saw it happen with Jeremiah let me just take a little bit before I go further into Revelation let's take a minute and just look at this because it's a pattern where we see people start off as Believers and ended up unbelievers this happened in the ministry of Our Lord when Jesus was here on Earth multitudes followed his ministry multitudes and then when he made that statement if you if you don't eat my flesh and drink my blood then those multitudes left him and at the end of his ministry there was only 120 that went up to the upper room all of them left which we see in the scriptures and we can show you a little bit in the scriptures the pattern and Paul wanders he said let us fear this this happened to us yeah because we see the people start off as Believers believe in the prophet and then they deviate into all kinds of confusion now let's let's look at it a little bit I'll just read for you a little bit so you can see for yourself what happens now Moses warned people as Paul also did and in Deuteronomy 4:2 Moses told the people he shall not add unto the word which I command you neither shall he diminish ought from it that he may keep the Commandments of the Lord your God which I commanded you so it was very important to Israel to stay exactly with what Moses brought and then this is why God told the same thing to Joshua because the people deviate and as the people deviate they don't realize it it's so easy to deviate see to get away from it and Israel deviated until 2 million left Egypt and only two out of 2 million entered into the promised land we are all aware of that and it stands as an example to all of us tonight amen now God warned Joshua and what God told Joshua is this in Joshua chapter 1 and verse 7 God speaking to Joshua he said only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not not from it to the right hand or the left that thou mayest Prosper wheresoever thou goest this book of the Lord shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate there in day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein okay for then thou sh make thy way prosperous and then thou shallal have good success have not I commanded thee be strong enough good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed but say that word dismayed means to be discouraged that's what he says for the Lord thy God is with thee wheresoever thou goest amen now God tell Moses and Moses told the people do not add do not take away told Joshua stay exactly with it because the people deviate to the left to the right they're bringing all kinds of stuff into it which of course but Paul was talking about ulry this morning now we have Joshua here doing exactly what God told him and we have something very very I love this what Joshua did so we look at Joshua 8 from verse 33 I'm just got to hurry now because I haven't really gotten into the main part of my message yet but if not I'm just going to cut because I'm I'm not going to hold you too long but Joshua chapter 8: 33-35 and all Israel and their elders and officers and their judges stood on this side of the Ark and on that side side besides the priests the Levites which bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord as well as the stranger now even the stranger was there okay that's what as the stranger as he that was born among them half of them over against M Mount gim and half of them over over against Mount ebal as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded before that the people should bless that they should Bless the people of Israel and afterwards he read all the words of the law the blessings and the chrs according to all that is written in the book in The Book of the law there was not a word of all that Moses commanded which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel with the women and the little ones even the little bitty ones you said when he's too little to hear the message let him hear it yes sir you says the The Strangers in our midst if they hear us are reading the message you're quoting Moses if they hear us talking about Moses they will get offended forget about the strangers read it let God take care of [Applause] that Hallelujah I told you everybody going to me because this there is this idea among the people you know you know we can't bring this to the people we can't bring that people what is this thing I remember I went among the menites in in MOBA now you might disagree that's all right you got to right too no problem if somebody want to disagree and theit came in there probably would we had some meetings here at the beginning when I wor to to Manitoba there probably about 300 of those menites was there at the meeting the school was we we had it in the school auditor it was packed and I got a whole bunch of B books like this and I put it on the paper I told those people I said listen I said I don't want to stand here and pretend that I believe something I don't believe it I says I want to be honest with all of you I believe what this man preached and those menites stood there and they looked and they said the nervous this guy but then they say well at least he's being honest you know what I baptized menite families I baptized the freezin the weees the dakes large families came to the message and was baptized and accepted the message because the people knew what they were coming to not something that we try to falsify no let them hear it Joshua read it you're a stranger hear it you're a little B kid hear it you're an adult hear it the woman hear it to the women the men everybody hear [Music] it amen am amen you know there's all kinds of nonsense people say and sometime I shake my head when I hear it you know they said that we we we uplifting brother bam if we call his name that's one of the excuse my expression one of the biggest lies being told amen because if God in a man's name is uplifting the man okay then we should take our Bibles and TR it to the track that's because my Bible your Bible that you got in your hand mentions the name Moses 854 times right amen I know that people AR going to say Amen go to your computer and check that's right 800 imagine if I have to stand at the puet and mention Moses name 854 times in an age like this what are they going to say of me what they going to say mother Ferguson what are you trying to do with Moses call it up person's name is not lifting them up where do we find it in the Bible do you know how many times the Bible mentions the word David do you know how many times the the Bible mentions the word Paul you take your Bible and look at the book of Acts Paul Paul did this Paul said that Paul Paul Paul Paul Paul Paul Paul is that lifting up a [Music] man listen Church the hour has come where we have to St stop listening to all kinds of nonsense and come back to the truth of the word of God thank you Lord amen and Min got the pre not the congregation Amen brother and they claim to be Believers of what they claim to believe the Bible excuse me if I say it but I could to say it because too much nonsense is going around amen true amen and it need to be it need to be told amen and then the blame falls on us but Joshua didn't listen to that he at all what Moses said no let's move a little bit from Moses from Joshua let's go a little further let's go to to Isaiah and Isaiah in Isaiah 53 verse one he said Isaiah said who would believe our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed is all right thank you my brother who believed our report Isaiah speaking then if we go to before we go on to Isaiah let's look a little bit and see what happened with Samuel you think you think that God's prophets when God sent a message and S of prophet you think everybody opens their hearts and says hey we we believe no here's what the people said to Samuel St to hurry now Lord help me to hurry 1 Samuel 8 verse 7 and the Lord said unto Samuel hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that I should not Reign Over them you see the thing that they rejected in Samuel they thought they were rejecting Samuel but he was not Samuel they were rejecting that's right it was God Amen Let Me Go On Again H REO the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected me thee but they have rejected me that I should not Reign Over them according to all the work The Works which they have done excuse me just drink a bit of water here in Arizona it's a little bit more the temperature is pretty dry for us and we used to a more humid climate now brother Paul excuse me and the Lord said unto Samuel hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that I should not Reign Over them according to all the works which they have done since they did I brought them out of the out of Egypt unto this day where it they have forsaken me and serve other gods so do so do they also unto thee excuse me now therefore hacken unto their voice how be it yet protest solemnly unto them and show them the manner of the king that shall reign unto them and Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked of him a king nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel and they said but we will have a king over us am you want to listen now we want to we want to go and see what they did in the time of Samuel in the S of now this song is a little negative but we'll get to the positives in a little bit some things that will really be blessing to you now Isaiah when Isaiah came he said who would believe our report of course we all know the job faced the same rejection too the prophet of God tell us that job's three deacons turned against him they were what you call his comforters they came to miserable com and not only the job's deacons turned against him but job entire congregation turned against him we know that Noah was rejected in his day with the message he brought and out of that whole generation how many came out of all that generation only eight people and there is something I want to share with you as I go forward in all of this and trust it will be a blessing so Jeremiah said um Isaiah said that in the case of Jeremiah chapter 44 the people told Jeremiah to said Jeremiah go and ask the Lord go inquire of the Lord for us Jeremiah went and the inquired of the Lord and brought back the word of the Lord and here's what the Bible says when Jeremiah came back with the word of the Lord then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense and other gods and all the wom that stood by a great multitude even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt in patros answered Jeremiah saying ask for the word that thou has spoken un Us in the name of the Lord we will not hearken unto thee now brother bam says in this particular age the people are not saying that right I'll show you what the attitude of the people is they're not saying of the message we don't believe many of them say they believe it but I'll show you what the prophet of God said is the problem with this particular age that we are live in and this is hindering Revelation because a lot of people say well God revealed to me and God revealed to me we get to that in a little bit and show you what the true Revelation is because I'm the I don't want to stand there and say this is wrong this is wrong I not show the truth amen I want to be able to show you exactly what the truth is what is the true Revelation what it is and how God does it so that when you leave here you can have an idea in your mind you can have a mighty in your mind you know exactly what it is is that is that is that fair is that good could everybody say Amen to that all right so when you leave now let me hurry here I don't want to spend too much time on Jeremiah but let's go to the prayer of Daniel and then we will move we'll move quickly now this prayer of Daniel brought tears almost brought tears to my eyes because I didn't read for you in Jeremiah but Jeremiah made the same prayer when he was praying concerning the prophets and how the people rejected every time God sent prophets now here in Daniel chapter 9 from verse 3 Daniel said and I set my face unto the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplications with fasting and sa and Ashes and I prayed unto the Lord my God and made my confession and said oh Lord the great and Dreadful God keeping the Covenant and mercy to them that love him and to them that keep his Commandments we have sinned and have committed iniquity and have done wickedly and have rebelled even by departing from thy principls and from thy judgments what is these princip and these judgments Moses said don't add don't take away stay with it exactly why because Moses knew it was not him he knew that what he receed came from God Amen and as the people deviated to displease God exactly what happened to Eve in the Garden of Eden when God gave her the word to deviate a little bit from that brought death and destruction you see it has to be exactly that word which we'll get to in a little bit see now now we continue here uh Daniel prayer he says and I prayed unto the Lord my God and made my confession and said oh Lord the great and Dreadful God keeping the Covenant and mercy to them that love him and to them that keep his Commandments we have sinned and have committed iniquity and have done wickedly and have rebelled even by departing from thy principes and from thy judgments neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets which spoke in thy name to our Kings our Prin princesses and our fathers and to all the people of the land oh Lord righteousness belong unto thee but unto us confusion of faces as at this day to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to all Israel that are near and that are a far throughout all the countries wherein thou has driven them because of their trespasses that they have trespassed against thee Oh Lord to us belong confusion of Faith to our Kings to our princesses and to our fathers because we have sinned against thee to the Lord Our God belong mercies and forgiveness though we have rebelled against him neither have we obeyed the voice of Our Lord God to walk in his laws which he set before us by his servants the prophets yeah all Israel have transgressed thy law even by departing that they might not obey thy voice therefore the curse is poured upon us and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God because we have sinned against thee what how did Israel sin brother said there's only one way to gain God's favor back to the word there's only one way that displeases God is when we deviate from that word when Jesus came we had the same situation and I want to read for you in John was the same thing when John came preaching I won't have time to go into all of it in Mark chapter one The Bible says all of Judy and all of them came out and baptized and got baptized the people started off good they all came out to hear John and they got baptized out of all those multitudes that follow John do you know how many that John presented to the because he was sent to prepared away do you know how many of those people that he was able to present to the Lord Jesus Christ butam said it was just a handful of them just a few of them because all of them came and got baptized but did they continue did they continue with the word did they continue with their message [Music] no so we have the same thing here happening with Jesus now if we look at John chapter 1 and verse 11 verse 10 rather he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came under his own and his own receed him not but as many as receive him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name if you want to I'm trying to hurry now and um let me just hurry a little bit here uh in John 12:37 and though he had done so many miracles before them yet they believe not on him you see when the word was manifested before their eyes you see to recognize the manifestation of that word is life amen you see when you see that word manifested that's the word God made the promise in the Bible here it is it's being manifested before your eyes amen amen amen amen you see it's like when when the angel came to Mary and Elizabeth was able to recognize that that was Isaiah 9 and verse 6 being fulfilled she was able to see the scriptures being fulfilled when John came on the scene he was the scriptures being fulfilled and the scribes and Pharisees missed the Fulfillment they knew that Elijah truly has to come first they knew all those scriptures but when Elijah appeared on this seen they held on to the promise Elijah is supposed to come and rejected the Fulfillment of the same promise I'm not hearing much amen here isn't that the truth yes sir all right let's go quickly Paul and Paul here in Galatians chap 1 and verse 6 he he said I Marvel that he is so soon removed from him that called you onto the grace of Christ onto another gospel which is not another but there be some that troubles you and would prefert the gospel of Christ but though we or an angel from heaven preach only other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be a curse as we said before so I again if any man preach and hear the gospel unto you then he have receiv received let him be a curse for do I now persuade men or God do I seek to please men if I yet pleased men I should not be the servant of Christ but I certify you Brethren that the gospel which is preached of me is not after man for I neither receive it of men neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ so Paul is telling that first age it was God that revealed it to him and warning the first stage about that now we have the same repeat in this age sir amen amen okay I hope I can find it for you quick are you being blessed what a poor amen what a poor amen I think we can do a little better amen than that oh I didn't write the the um maybe I'll find it quick Lord help me here yep um it's where he said oh I I wrote it down and didn't write the reference I've got it in here but I didn't write the exact page it's where he says he was talking about the Revelation that he had and he said you might disagree with me he said that's all right he said but if you search it out quite right you would find out that first the angel of the Lord showed it to me and then he showed me to find it in the Bible now brother Bram claimed that it was the angel of the Lord that gave him the Revelation that he preached here's the danger preacher see brother bam standed to pet and EXP explain the Bible they think they can do the same so they get up behind the and they preach could they said at the angel of the Lord told him that now let me get let me let me read something for you I told you what I'm going to be saying I'm not going to get many amens I'm going to get a lot of amens here that's all right but let's go to Revelation now okay let's go to the let's go to the revelation right now are you being blessed all right this is so so so good we love him with all our hearts don't we I I'm getting a little problem to get it all but I think it will be it will be all right well oh praise His name come on pray for me tonight that the Lord would help me out I'm not getting it I'm not getting it yeah I'm not getting it the way the way I should but it's where brother Brandon mentions oh Lord I got to get that uh it's he mentions here and I there's some was some of my notes I could have probably left back at my hotel room I think the devil just kind of tie me up on that yeah okay I got it thank the Lord I got it thank you for your prayer amen that's wonderful I remember brother Billy Paul used to tell me he said watch him when he begin to get his notes mixed up brother Billy Paul used to tease me on that one okay let's see here now in the church ages brother Brandon made this statement and of course many of us sitting here probably aware of it he said notice here that Jesus by the spirit in every age addresses himself only to one person relative the word for that age we all know that only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say to our age many people don't believe that because they're looking for something else to tell them amen why I don't understand the people on here God sent Moses why to something else listen to go cor listen to D listen to this one listen to that God sent Moses pill of fire confirm him to have to truth God sent Isaiah he had the truth God sent s Samuel he had the truth God said Jeremiah he had the truth it's just the nature of man to Rebel that's right and in this particular age we have to the same problem amen only one there's not 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 doesn't it exist only one we can't listen to everybody amen so only one messenger receives what God has to say 40 age excuse me I'm sorry here got to get this now I'm getting into my message now trying to hurry yeah only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say to our age and that one messenger is the messenger to the true church he speaks for God by Revelation to the churches both true and false the message is then broadcast to all but though it is broadcast to all who come within range of that message that message is received individually by only a certain qualified group Hallelujah in a certain way now I'll share with you that in a certain way so God sends his Revelation to us in a certain way which we will look at in a little bit in a certain way each individual of that group let me read that for you but it is Rec but all who come within range of the message that message is received individual individually by only a certain qualified group not everybody because the angel of the Lord told Brother Bram he says many would not believe you but many will so if the angel of the Lord said that we expect that there'll be many who will not believe so don't don't be don't don't don't don't be be stumbled when you see people turning your backs on the word it happened in every age it happened in the time of Moses it happened in the time of Jeremiah it happened in the time of Samuel it happened time of Jesus don't be don't be amazed amen it has to happen to fulfill the scriptures amen let's continue here uh he says he okay the message is in broadcast to all but though it is broadcast to all who come within range of the message that message is receive individually individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way each individual of that group group is one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by way of the messenger let me hear the whole church say that by way of the M messenger so they were able to hear what the spirit was saying by way of Moses they were able to hear the true the true believers what the spirit was saying by way of Noah they were able to hear what the spirit was saying by way of Jeremiah by way of Isaiah but the majority of them rebelled some started but they didn't continue many started but they didn't continue you true because they deviated here let me read for you a little bit as we go forward now okay so it's is a certain way that God s that that that that God sends it to us we'll get into that in a little bit so each individual of that group is one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by way of the messenger those who hear are not getting their own private re Revelation me got a little Revelation boy you don't see it brother George but I got my little Revelation you know what brother George it's a revelation brother listen anybody could say anything and call it our Revelation and that's what we seeing [Music] today somebody can say I got a revelation that I don't have to pray a lot is that scripture when Jesus says pray without without ceasing somebody got a revelation he shouldn't come to church is that scripture it's exactly the opposite of what the prophet said but they call all this stuff Revelation and they blame God that's right God is getting a lot of blame for things he's not guilty of the devil does what he want to do and God gets blame for it so they put it on God that's what the devil has done the devil is not going to tell the people it's me Satan telling you that he's saying it's me God telling you that right and we all aware of this problem now let's continue here quickly I'm just have to hurry Lord help me to hurry help me all right now let's see so each individual of that group okay we read that those who here are not getting their own private Revelation that's right man I got a little Revelation you know there nothing about it but brother Ferguson what is it you pray maybe the Lord will give you the same Revelation as me what's the next verse have you heard that listen have you heard that then join the rest of us we have heard that many it's a revelation it is what is this mysterious Revelation brother where is it in the scriptures where is it in the word of God well I can't tell you because it's a revelation that's true a revelation that cannot be told is that a revelation that's right there you go yes sir amen where in the word of God do we have a revelation that cannot be told now Church listen the hour has come for us to wake up and realize what's happening too many people are asleep it's to the realities of what's going on true amen amen am let's continue so those who here not getting their own private Revelation nor is a group getting their own Collective Revelation so you know it's me us four and no more it's me and my old church we got a revelation brother you know what brother my pastor brought a mighty Revelation from God but nobody else got it now we're talking like this but we got to get back to see what the true Revelation is yeah okay we don't want to dwell too much on the negatives but let's look at we have to look at the negatives for you to to you to see it see because God always God always projects it in a contrast you see day and night you know he projects everything so you all understand all right we won't spend much time on that so he said those okay they're not getting their own private Revelation or is a group getting their own Collective Revelation but each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from God am now if these individuals are getting their little Revelations it didn't come true the messenger then where are they getting it from you know in the time of Noah instead of lining up with Noah they want to build their own arck and by then when the rains come you know that brother B tell us that when the rains came all those ARS that Noah didn't build went down the only one AR Flo it was Noah you see so that's what we have now brother brandham goes on he says now think it not St that this is the case for Paul set this pattern under the hand of God Paul alone had the full Revelation for his day as evidenced by his confrontation of the other apostles who admitted that Paul was the prophet Messenger to the Gentiles for that day and also note by actual illustration in the word and when Paul desired to go to Asia butam continu see I'm going to try to skip some of this to continue and then he says here in every age we have exactly the same pattern so there's no without this pattern uh that is why the light comes through some god-given messenger in a certain area and then from that messenger there spreads the light through the ministry of others the what the what amen the ministry of who of only one sir all right the light comes through the minist through one and then it spreads through the ministry of others who have been Faithfully taught the problem is not how is spreading the light right we see what the problem is the problem is that ministers preaching is what they're preaching bam gift but said was God his teaching was the devil amen that's this church is be on fire Ste Amen brother let's continue we continue here I'm going try try to hurry all right but of course all those who go out don't only always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken am remember Paul warned the people to say only what he said 1 Corinthians 14:37 If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual Amen Let Them acknowledge that the things that I WR unto you are the Commandments of God Amen amen amen amen amen and then Paul goes on but if you want to be ignorant let him ignorant still what Paul brought was the Commandments of God that's right because the angel of the Lord God revealed it to him what brother Bram brought was the same thing God came down and revealed it to brother Bram the angel of the lord gave it to him and show him where to find it in the word so when we hear in brother Brandon we know for sure that his message came from God Amen am yes sir now let's go a little step further now let's go on Paul warned them let's go on the adol here will take away there and soon the message is no longer pure and the Revival dies down now brother bam thought of something here that I love and read it for you that a lot of people don't believe these are the quotes of our no amen all right perseverance says you know when Jesus preached there wasn't one 1% of the the one millionth of the people on Earth ever heard him look what heard John to make preparation see it's the elected hears it that's all that's right no man can come to me except my father draws him first and all the father had given me will come that's right now I believe that there's a church coming into that Perfection that Ministry of perfection where the officers where Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists for the Perfection of the church I'm not explaining anything for the what for the what who said that not only B said Paul said it too for the Perfection of the church them pastors and teachers and so forth will be so with the [Music] word until the whole thing would work right up into the coming of the Lord I believe that and I believe we are nearing that time now I believe it is so do we all believe it is so could we lift our hand and give God praise for that hallelujah amen amen amen now let's continue on God has a way that he gives you and I Revelation and the revelation we receive is what he has already already given that's right to the prophet that's right now this Bible I have in my hand here the prophet that God tell us and I'm not going to go back and read the course I got all the course on it this Bible I have in my hand here is the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen this book we have in our hands here this book is already brother said the word is already revealed here right amen okay sir now when I read my Bible I'm reading the revelation of the word of God that does not mean I have the Revelation I'm reading the Revelation if I listen to a tape I'm hearing the Revelation it does not mean I have the Revelation there is a process that God goes through to give me the Revelation and give you the revelation of what he has already revealed so we're not getting a private revelation we getting a revelation that is already revealed all right this might sound a little strange to you but I'll read it from the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed for you it's why the prophet of God when you talk about Revelation it's so vast we talk about love and brother brandom says the revelation of divine love when God give you a revelation of divine love what is that the revelation of divine love is a revelation that God has already given in the Bible already given it's nothing new it's not you and I getting a new revelation it's you and I getting a revelation from God okay we'll get to that in a little bit I'll share that with you a little bit to see how God does it okay I'm going to try to hurry is that all right now let me read it for you so everybody can see what we are saying yeah all right aren't you being blessed am all right let me see here I got a little quote here yeah we read that already the Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ okay and of course there's one I think I should read for you just the same so you will see the importance of the message and when we talk about you know people deviating from the message they got to it has to happen it happened in Moses it happened in in in Jesus time it has to be it's not it's not a well you know we surprised to see this Paul said I'm marveled but it happened even Paul marveled but it happened what are you going to do amen now um I need to read something for you here I think you probably noed but I think I'm going to deviate a little bit from where I'm going and just read this one for you so that you can see little what brother PanAm says as we come into the revelation of this here's what he says um this is in Gabriel's instructions to Daniel he said now the closeth he said now the close is a fact that God deals with Israel only when she's in her homeland of course brother Ted Teddy spoke a little bit about that that's when God Abraham left the Homeland and went down into Egypt what happened he walked away from the will of God and never was blessed till he returned back to the Homeland God never dealt with him not One Vision not nothing else did he come back to the Homeland look at Israel when they was they were sent down in Egypt for 400 years not one Miracle not one sign not one thing happened among them not recorded in the history of the book the same old 99 go to church offer the lamb say he Mary or whatever it was back then next year same thing the priest will argue Rabbi so and so we elect Rabbi so and so he's got a better scholarship he knows more than the Egyptians first thing you know the Egyptians and all of them was the same thing it's the same it's the same way it was in Egypt and God never did deal with Israel till she come back to her Homeland are you ready now now sit still we're going to bring the power no we got the punch coming out heam says he said hear me thus sayith the Lord God will not deal with his church till she comes back to the Homeland the message of the hour amen it's just sayth the Lord come back to the original get away from your Methodist Baptist Presbyterian ideas your Pentecostal assemblies Oneness tress Fess whatever it is Church of God Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness Church of Christ all Antichrist movements and I realize this strikes the word all wrong all of the devil High there Godly men in every one of them there's godly people in every one of them but the organization itself is not of God and God will never bless them amen he never has done it amen it's thus sayith the Lord all right let's go back to the way that God gives us Revelation okay there's a way that he gives you the Revelation this Bible is a revelation let me read something for you that you could see I'm going to dwell on that just a little bitty bit so that everyone could see and what we're talking about is that all right because now we're going to go into how God gives us the Revelation yeah here I got it the angel give it to me let me read that for you I'm sorry I taken so much time but I'll read it is that all right it's in the message be not afraid he says now I regard you all as my friends and my brothers and sisters I I expect to spend eternity with within glory and if if you disagree with me on my teaching that's perfectly all right he didn't stop there right but I believe if you search your Bible real good you'll find out it's on the mark Cuz first the angel of the Lord came to me and taught it to me then he showed me in the Bible we to find it I've got to find the first man that get down it and that's been for years it's the truth yes sir what you minister in this age could stand before the people and say the angel of the Lord came to me and give me this this this this this and and then then the purifier come and confirm it listen Church the entire Revelation came to one man Elijah truly shall first come and restore what restore it many people don't believe that I remember I was in a church in Ean buul in Turkey I was preaching a message on the restoration of all things the pastor of course let me preach and he told me said brother fuson go ahead whatever is on your heart preach you want to talk about whatever preach I took my Bible I said the Bible says Elijah truly shall first come and restore all things and then I look at the congregation I said who is going to restore all things a congregation said Jesus I says Jesus said Elijah shall first come and restore all things who is going to restore all things they said Jesus I called the Pastor said pastor come he came I said read it out of your Bible for the congregation he read it out of his Bible for the congregation and the congregation will not accept it if Jesus said Elijah truely shall first come and restore all things that word from the mouth of Jesus is D yet the Lord and he is not coming to restore some things and it's not going to be Elijah bless somebody else amen get that thing out of your mind amen it's Elijah and Elijah alone el If he if he restore 99.9% and somebody restore .00% then the CH of the Bible is wrong he got to restore all all means all we don't have to interpret it or explain it all means all but that doesn't mean that say that's what they do to try to get WR it but it doesn't mean that it means exactly what it says and it says what it means Elijah will rest and we believe that oh we no we won't go into out of that the restoration of all things but let's get back to what we seeing here and how God reveals it to you because we need Revelation amen all right um oh oh this is so wonderful are you being blessed all right we need now let me read something for you here quickly um that's all right I think you you being blessed aren't you huh could you say Amen to that we're being blessed thank the Lord for that now brother man goes on he said the evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost today is just the same as it was back in the day for Lord it is receiving the word of Truth for the day in which you live now we get back to that and receiving the word in a little bit Jesus never did stress the importance of the works as he did the word he knew that if the people got the word The Works would follow that is Bible you get the word I get the word The Works would follow wor with works I don't have to worry about God blessing me if I walk in his way and I stay with his truth he's got to bless me he's under obligation to bless the man that will stay with his word he's got to keep his word amen he's got to keep it he can't do anything else I wish I had more time to get into that go ahead some that I'm thinking in My Heart Lord should I really ask God for this should I really ask God for that because I believe if I ask him for it how you give it to me he gives it to even if it's against his own perfect will look let's not going into all of that it's all right you know that you know that the truth look at Hezekiah so put your house in order because you're going to die what did Hezekiah do imagine a major prophet came to Hezekiah what would you do if you were in that condition and he told him put your house in order you're going to die you're going to fall in your knees Lord help me you know Lord help me but look at Hezekiah pray said Lord you know that I have served you what a perfect heart I've done what you want me to do and God didn't say you didn't do it God said to to Isaiah go back and tell him at 15 years so he could put he could put everything when he need to put in in order see now this might sound a little strange but that's the Bible That's the Way of God and we can go before the Lord father I know I believe your word that's not boasting that's telling the truth that's right that's why Elijah could stand said and said Lord I have done this at your command you see if you could stand and say Lord I know I've stood in your word Lord God I know Lord I've made many mistakes but I know I believe your word hallelujah can we feel that way can we give our hand give our hand give God praise for that Hallelujah isn't he worthy of praise praise His wonderful name now now let me read this for you here as we go on to show you where the Revelation is is lacking where we need to come back to it all right amen I got so much here oh this is a strange hour that we are living in but let me see here maybe the Lord can help me here uh yeah I got it here MH all right let's see yeah are you ready amen all right now listen but Adam says here now we're going to see how God gives us Revelation now no man knows the things of God say the spirit of God unto whom the spirit of God reviews them we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world we have accepted the Bible we have now that's the first step we which we'll get to in a little while we have accepted the great truths of it but it still is not real to most people because the Revelation by the spirit is not there the word has not been quickened amen but Ram gives an example he said the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:21 that we have become the righteousness of God by our Union with Jesus Christ do you get it it says that we are the very righteousness of God himself by being in Christ it says that he Jesus became sin for us it does not say he became sinful but became sin for us that by our Union with him we might become the righteousness of God for if we accept the fact and we must that he literally became sin for us by his substitution for us then we must also accept the fact that we by our Union with him have become the very righteousness of God Amen to reject one is to reject the other to accept the one is to accept the other now we know the Bible says that it can be denied but the revelation of it is missing it is not real to the majority of God's children it is just a good verse in the Bible but we need to have it made alive to us this will take Revelation now let me read for you a little bit here is the word of God revealed but there comes a time when God gives you the Revelation yes amen now when God gives you the Revelation something happens because the first thing is you you accept the Revelation just what God says I'm going to skip now because I'm if I stop here to read all the qu going to take me a lot of time so I'm going to just try to hurry as I as I go along let's say you hear the Revelation you push aside everything contrary to that Revelation you realize that you cannot get a revelation that God has not spoken we not talking about prophecy now like I could probably get a prophecy you can get a prophecy to do certain things we're talking about the gift of Prophecy here okay an anointing fall on somebody and say brother George you need to leave tomorrow and go to Texas we're not talking about in that sense we're talking about the revelation of the word we're talking about you having a revelation in the in in the word of God in the message in the things of God that the Bible says we're talking in that sense you understand okay now when God takes his Revelation to give you the Revelation now let me um this is something that sounds a little strange to you and I need to read a quote or two I have to take some time and just read a little bit of quote or two to you on that okay yes oh but the devil's really fighting me tonight I I had it written out here it's I should have it I'm sorry Church please just pray for me that the Lord yes I got it now the devil is really trying to get me a little upset here on that but that's all right I got it are you ready now amen okay when the truth of a promised word of God has been truly revealed to his Saints that's filled with oil they all get they all get stimulated give me a revelation is that true when the truth of a promised word of God has been truly revealed to his Saints that's filled with oil they all get they all get Hallelujah let me see the hands of all those who got a stimulation Hallelujah glory to God Jesus what do you do when you got a stimulation on Hallelujah you get like David my cup is pull and running over running oh brother god let's continue here see stimulated with joy shout see and what it what it does it has the same effect upon them that wine upon a natural man you ever see a man with have you ever seen a man with a lot of wine in him and he's standing like this listen my father was a drunk and I'll tell you the truth when you meet a drunk the drunk doesn't have to tell you I am drunk you see all the signs in him off a drunk come on church we all know that he's staggering he can't walk right he go like this he goes like that and you know the reason he's doing it is because he had too much wine or too much bear to this bears with they drink or too much alcohol whatever it is like I remember I was in grenado once in a missionary trip and I saw little a little place there brother I saw a place there and it's my cane juice so I got a little curious I said let something sweet here maybe some kind of a drink they selling I walked into that place and I said what is the can juice and he showed me all those bottles of alcohol there boy I got out of that place as fast as I could all right so brother Bram says here he continues he said because when the Revelation has been given of a truth of God and the True Believer filled with oil come on and listen to this now and the Revelation is is revealed yes Lord amen the stimulation becomes so great that he makes him behave himself unnormal come on Church you know I think some of us when we get to Revelation tonight some of us is going to begin to believe a little a little different than how we came in come on Amen see because and the Revelation is revealed the simulation becomes so great that he makes him behave himself un normally right Glory see that's what's the matter with them now that's right makes them be behave themselves unseemingly now let me get to something here and how he gets the Revelation I want to try to finish up with this I'm going to read it for you are you ready are you do you want me to stop here keep going sir all right now here he's talking about Brother P giv the illustration of when Jesus was on met the disciples on the road to EMAs okay and he read the scripture we won't go back and read the scripture one have more time and it says here he says they walked on the road down to the little city IM just a few mile or two down there a Sabbath's day Journey or something the first he revealed the promised scripture of himself to them for that day now notice when Jesus comes on the scene if we want to see him and talk with him after his resurrection like they did like they saw him the first thing he did to them was reveal himself to them by the scriptures that's right amen amen then he goes on he said always the churches gets that all scrupled up and they all get out and man has inject what they believe about it you have some people this is what I believe Lord help me Lord help us I don't want to know what you think and what you believe it means nothing to me I want to know what God say man shall not live by what he thinks and what he thinks man shall live by every word and come out [Music] God you said brother BR make statements like that the angel of the Lord was with brother Bram to give him the revelation to me what I believe has to be what the Bible say has to be what the prophet say to me I deny myself I deny my thoughts I deny my reasoning I deny what I think the first thing he does when he comes to you is to reveal to you his word give you the make give you the revelation of himself by the scriptures amen now that doesn't stop there that's right let's continue here he says always the churches get at all scrupled up and they get out and man has to inject what they believe about it and this one says well I believe a little different from that and he makes him something and this one has got to do something and each one has a tower excuse me excuse me Church Hallelujah now why did we come out of the denomination it's because of this uhhuh go ahead we came out of the denomination to escape man's ideas yes that's right I'll we denomination to escape man's ideas to go back into man's ideas we have a message came down and confir the truth just like Moses if you were in the time of Moses you have to come out of all that Egypt and all of that come out amen amen prise the Lord and oh something that they got to build always trying to add something to do something and say that we did this or that's the way you that is the way you got confused then you sit in the meeting and wonder in your mind well how come this and how come that and I don't understand this and I don't see that and I and I don't blame you because I have sit in meetings already and I heard people people explain stuff and say stuff and I wondering I just going to condemn the brother but the real truth of it is it's not the message the prophet did not bring it that's it's not in the Bible amen amen amen amen amen we can go to many illustrations but I won't take time on that but goes on here he says and we found out that he revealed himself to cleopas and his friend here it's Unknown by name the other party but it was clear P we know that and he revealed himself to them by the scriptures notice how he said amen notice they called him a prophet you know and these things in Jesus of Nazareth where B goes on and then they had recognized the one they were talking about of being a prophet so when they he was there they said that Jesus of Nazareth who was a proph Mighty in work and deeds then but they didn't recognize here he was among them he's sending them the scriptures he's showing them now what man goes on which he was the word and was revealing him by mouth the word that was written of him and he begin and he started from Moses and explained to them all that the prophets had said about him oh my how he made it known for that age fools slow of heart knowing that Moses and all the prophets said that Christ m and enter into his glory see and for that age that was was supposed to take place see revealing the written word for them taking the Bible showing them here it's written in the Bible this is what and look it happened David said that this is what supposed to be they Fierce my hands and my feet here this this is what the Bible says this is what happened this is what the Bible says this is what happened this is where the word of God says this is what happened it's the same thing he did in this age look here is where the Bible says the seeds are supposed to open they are open amen has to restore the F of the fathers he did restore the F of the fathers the ministry in the day that the son of man is being revealed son Man Came long and is revealed himself here it is said here it is being done hallelujah Glory let's continue than you Jesus oh I don't think I'll be able to finish oh Lord help us it it's happening before them and you know what they do they hold on to the promise reject reject wow the manifestation and when they do that look oh Lord they claimed that they had believed and that they were his disciples they loved him they believed it and he was standing right among them interpreting the word what he was and still didn't know it just think of that they didn't know it and him standing there himself written in written in the scripture and goes back and picks up the scripture have been written for hundreds of years concerning him and telling how he must do and these things and walked around and say they didn't see it what a picture of this they same now they claimed they believe that he had raised from the dead but when he appears to show himself they didn't believe it see yet they claimed they believe it oh yes we believe he rose the third day let him do something to show he raised the third day oh I don't believe in that see there you are the same thing amen but B continues he said now notice he said they didn't see it even when he explained to them they sit right there they heard a six- hour message and prophecy being fulfilled but B said still didn't see it here what he says he says he couldn't do it by preaching them the word it went over the top of their head people think that if they sit in a meeting oh my and they hear a preacher preaching telling them all the scriptures that are fulfilled it will be enough it's not enough amen people think that's how the people think today that's they miss an important element of Revelation that's why when the difficulties hit them they go back am because they heard the Revelation but they didn't receive the revelation you see which we'll get to in a little bit I'm I'm trying to hurry now brother Bram says here he couldn't do it by preaching them the word it went over their head him walking on there saying well you ought to know there and you fool slow of heart the Bible said these things that Christ must do these things and so forth walking along there well look like they they would have seen who it who he was they didn't but mam goes on to say he says we found out that the only way he can reveal is to come into you thank you Lord how does he come into you how does he get into you then he can reveal himself brother goes on he is he can he's the word amen and the word in you then the Holy Spirit reveals Christ through the word after he gets in you he is in you you must take his word so the first thing is you open up and invite him abide with us abide with us we need you Lord amen now as you open up what are you doing you're crying you're begging him you're pleading with him to abide with you Lord Jesus come in me how do you accept him in in you but bam says you open your heart for the Word of Promise for your day and you accept it so you accept the Revelation amen when you accept the Revelation it does not mean that it is revealed to you it just means you have accepted the Revelation this is the manner that God works you have accepted it I have accepted the Revelation I believe what the prophets say amen I believe what the Bible say I believe I have recognized it to be the truth and I believe it that is not enough amen I'm not hearing any amen and that's fine amen this as far as many people go but I'm happy because I believe the message the devil believe to that's right what he have no Revelation the prophet said he has a knowledge but no Revelation that's right yes amen yes amen that's why when the Trials come and problems come you see them drift back they didn't have no Revelation what is this Revelation you're talking about brother Ferguson you see there is only one way you and I could get the revelation God God had to meet Moses Moses had the Scrolls Moses believed he was to be the deliverer Moses believed all of that but there was something lacking in Moses what Moses lacked the pillar of fire had and then Moses met that Pillar of Fire that pill of fire gave Moses what he La when you meet God God gives you you can say I've accepted the Bible I've accepted all the truths of the Bible I believe the Bible I believe it I've accepted all the truth that is not enough the Revelation has to come and when the Revelation comes Oh Glory to God when God steps in when you begin to realize with all your heart that this Revelation is what God saying is what the Bible says it's what the messenger say it's not somebody saying I have a little private Revelation all of that has to be cast out of the window and there little explanations and all the stuff I believe this and I think that all of that you know what church all of those things should be dead Among [Music] [Applause] Us God how could God step in with unbelief and we got our an ideas and we got this and we got that and we call in our idea Revelation and we call it somebody preached something from the hand of pet and we never heard of in our life and we call it a revelation one brother told his congregation he said I'm going to preach to you something you never heard before yeah he said when God created Adam before the the before the theophany he created what he called a theophonic body what does this mean what does it mean what does it have sense to are people brother I don't not understand the people of this age amen now when you open your heart and you accept him just like brother Brandon says the woman at the well when Jesus stood there and he told her you had five husbands she looked at him and she recognized right then that he was a prophet she saw the word fulfilled and when she accepted that then he gave it a revelation he said I who am speaking to you I am he I am he glory to God she what did she do she accepted it and when she accepted it brother bam says he was already in the inside he got in how does he get in you open your heart and you accept him when you accept him he gets him what how does he get in he is the word and that word is the word of God everybody says what they have is the word everybody I've never been a preacher that preached he didn't say what he preaching was not the word of God regardless to what he preached one preacher preached that the Rapture there's no such thing as a Rapture and he believe was preaching the word amen listen Church the word is what God s through his mouth through the and we open our hearts and we believe [Music] that glory and as we believe it God steps in then we have accepted him even when we accept it it's not oh Church oh church I trust the Lord you see it I put says we have accepted the Bible we have accepted all these truths but the Revelation is missing listen when you get the Revelation here is what happened I'm going to hurry now and just because I got quotes here on it look excuse me I got to read this for you then I I got to just read it please church are you being blessed [Music] now all right here wow all right Christ is the mystery of God revealed this is the this is where God build the whole foundation for the church amen the whole church is based upon a revelation that's right it's a revelation that God has given to you amen not a revelation that you simply have accepted amen it's a revelation that God given you it's one thing to accept the Revelation it's another thing when God gives it to you and then the whole thing is revealed to you then the Revelation is revealed to you in other words you receive the Revelation what you receive it's not something that was not revealed you're receiving something that is already revealed you're receiving a [Music] reation amk that's exactly right all right better this here but the Revelation came through the blood see through Jesus Christ who is the blood of God creative blood in the womb of Mary and Paul knew him by Revelation that's how we know him today is only it's the only way you could know him not say I'm Methodist that means nothing I'm Baptist that means nothing I'm Catholic that means nothing but by the Revelation that God has revealed the word to you he is the word amen and the word how you know it's revealed yes amen right there it is how you know it's revealed amen it lives itself and expresses itself through you thank you Lord amen amen you read a scripture concerning the new birth oh preacher stand behind the purpose and explains to you the new birth amen or you sit in the meeting and hear a tape on the new birth amen what you hearing is a revelation that's right it doesn't mean you have the Revelation I have the Revelation right amen now what do I do I accept it I said Lord this is what I want this is what I believe I've accepted the new birth amen I've accepted it but what is the new birth brother says the new birth is a revelation yesen what does God do he reveals to you and you and the word that is revealed to you becomes one that word [Applause] BEC it's not a in the [Music] word exactly what is said here you he must be born again that's a revelation right here preach what the new birth is you sit in the Mee you hear it it doesn't mean you have you can go right and backslide and when people see you backed this had it no he never had it he never had a true Revelation if he had that true Revelation he becomes a part of the word [Applause] preaching brother amen Glory Hallelujah see it just like what we see but God says he took your place that you could take his place he became s for you that you by your un with him will become the right of God how many people in this meeting here tonight can leave this church and said I am the righteousness of God somebody look at you and tell you you're boasting you're not boasting I [Music] [Applause] Amah Glory Paul could say Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ not by the word of men but by the word of God Jesus Christ isting speaking brother Lord stood a p and said if you believe me to be his servant if you believe me to be his Prophet better Knew by Revelation what he was knew not by knowledge holy ghor they do all kinds of stuff come see word whate the message go show born again cuz long as you're not born in you line up with the word we wouldn't going into that tonight but see as you come now because what you realize what you ring is this you're not relying on your on the fact that you have accepted the mess amen you not rely just on the fact of that that's right am am yes brother B says a revelation has to come from God [Applause] amen amen and then amen you open your Bible back amen how you think you're speaking because God has done it for you then within you is the weakness God give you the witness he does correct if got it then you and the message become one says he said the voice of God is in the bride where that's all they can see some people want see the Revelation in the Bible that's all they can see says the word is manifested when it come Ines I my here it's not in the book here where the Holy Ghost is one that can do that amen then all glory belongs to him you recognize what he has done for you you open your heart how do you open your heart for him to come in by accepting what he says you open your heart and accept you got some come to me but the Lord what I remember I used to go with Jesus preacher he was L Pastor when I met her that little Jesus call the church and he will tell the people empty empty empty empty yourself before the Lord get your mind all all empty but says no he says you empty yourself say you open up the devil he says you have to come on the basis of his promise you accept the promises and then you approach the Lord Jesus Christ you're approaching him on the basis of his word his promise what he that you know in your heart I have received it I have accepted what he said and now I'm coming to him and all that what I have accepted becomes a part of me because not because you accept it it means of you accept the devil could come out what he did to Israel Israel lost the Bible said they believe what happened they lost you look around you see people wor few years later I'm not sure did these people have Revelation no did they see it oh yes they said they start off as Believers yes amen amen you see a church yes a church my brother and sister don't stop by saying we've accepted the truth of the Bible exactly we have accepted all these things don't stop there that's what the prophet God is tell don't stop here open up your heart and says Lord God Of Heaven he says the church should be screaming for Revelation more than anything else in the world the new birth is a revelation amen Divine love is a revelation yes it is Faith is a revelation the Rapture Isen that's what said I can stand here and explain the whole of a to you and all the steps of the Rapture and this is going to happen before this and this is going to happen and this is going to happen you will miss that Rapture a million mil if you have the Revelation because the Rapture is a revelation and the true Bri of Christ will be waiting [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] for when it comes from God you're not going to deviate from the message and believe all kind of stuff I believe this I believe that listen when you get that Revelation is every word come out of the M of God you line up with it it didn't come from the message forget it well if I forget it I would be a true person listen you got to do what the word of God says you have to make up your mind you going to live by live what somebody else tells you it come got to forget all these things Jesus himself said he said when the son of man come back is he going to find faith is he going to find those bunch of believers stand with his word yes amen where is the Revelation people say I have the Revelation where is the Revelation when you have the Revelation there's a stimulation in you in you yes you got a revelation that you healed nothing can stop that healing you have accepted healing but you got to get a revelation of it when the Holy Ghost gives you the Revelation you are healed then you are healed the Holy Ghost gives you the Revelation you are saved you are saved the Holy Ghost gives you revelation of the Rapture you are a part of the Rapture you wait for the Revelation do you see a church you accept the truth and you wait then he reveal himself to you first by the written word yes by the written word why is he giv why is he giving you the Revelation for you to accept the word to get in you to get first he comes in by you accepting the word then then that word is Quicken is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] something I'm going to share with you something strange after says here's mes for still a little bit here's Moses going on into Egypt in egpt I come say said there was thousands of armored Angels matching with Moses you about see one man but there thousand ofes going you know what happened our come on husband to me the angel of the Lord was to kill because he would sacrifice his own son action on the Rock mes is going down the Revelation in his heart is stopping him the argument of you know I have a big argument with my wife you know what I'm going to do I'm not going to go to church iue my husband you know what I'm going do I'm I'm going to pray Revelation do that boy brother sister she told she told Moses had an argument and here is Moses going on Revelation re stop him stop himy to stop work theel tried to kill him didn't stop [Applause] inp brother

AR with your brother is not going to stop you sister is not going to stop you you're in the king Mar [Music] going Egypt didn't have a chance says one of those angels one to destroy the whole [Applause] [Music] [Applause] world we need to open up now and if you want to get the Revelation quit believing I believe this and I got to explain that and I think this quit all of that you want to get the Revelation get away from all of that because the Revelation is not that the Revelation is what God sent through [Applause] Malachi hon I'm appreciate you I'm tempted to give my ideas too you think I'm not tempted sure I am look I'm closing by giving you one little example I was in l i could call his name now he's going on to meet the Lord we got a big meeting there I'm sorry thank you very we had a big meeting there thousands of people in the meeting many churches were there and I told the church how I was in the tropical forest you know I'll hurry with the story I was leaning against the wall my left hand and a scorpion bit me here I told that story to brother Bill and when the Scorpion bit me in tropical forest my daddy put a rag here to stop the blood from going up because all here you know turn right and blue and stuff blue and black and stuff and the poison was going was moving up I I got that scorpion hit and I prayed I was a Christian at the time and I prayed and the Lord healed me daddy wanted to rush me to the hospital he didn't and then I told myself you know what a scorpion with me I'm going to eat a scorpion no this is not a Doctrine you don't mean you have to eat SC I know you wouldn't do it but that's all right anyway there was a a patch of ginger in the forest here I don't know why but scorpions love you know Ginger batches those gingers is in the grass family I went there with my machete craft until I get a be of Scorpion I took a while ran in his back cut this thing out with a p had all those blood but the poisonous cut the little thing in the front that that little uh in the front cut his feet off put some butter on him and I roast him in the fire I eat him so I told it to the people in Africa would you eat cion with me I will not invite you to that you know why I can't invite you because I told that story about you and there was a little brother I didn't know as a little kid he was probably eight or nine years old so you heard me after the meeting I told him I says would you want to eat this cop un P Ferguson the port little guy you know being his Pastor he loved me a lot you know he didn't want to say no to me so the PO kid didn't know what to answer and then his father standing there and his father accorded the scripture he says Jesus said if one of your sons asked you for a bread would you give him a scorpion and that cured me sister hary I will not ask no kid to eat scorpion with me anyway I told that story so after I told that story Ingo my friend and Buddy and now this doesn't mean that all Africa eat snakes there are some tribes eat snakes and some doesn't but he was from one of those tribes that atat snake so he took me to a restaurant now and he was my buddy but my bosom friend and so he ordered the meal because he was a wealthy man and uh so he told me he said you eat a scorpion I said yeah he said what if you eat a scorpion he say you can eat snake I says well I don't think so I says and I says I rather a scorpion than the snake so he said to me he says but brother Ferguson you becoming an African now so you have to become one of us he said the he said the python steak is the most tender meat you can eat he said it's more tender than any other meat you can eat I I said I said I understand you said but I rather not because not anything but you know I don't like I don't like snake that's just me so anyway he said you know what he says I'm going to purchase it he says taste it he said if you don't like it he said I'll eat it so I said boy he's going to finish he's going to finally convince me to eat snakes I said I know what I got to do something to stop this I said brought anyway he said yes I said could be blessed what God has cursed I said didn't God curse the SN curse the snake he said yes I said well how could we bless that he said I never thought of that now listen close now listen to this he says I said yeah I said and you're trying to say and I'm your buddy and friend and you're trying to encourage me to eat something that God curs he said please brother Ferguson forgive me for it and when he said that I realized that he was going to make a dotion out of that and I says but ain't I I said that is not the message that's not the Bible that's me that's brother Ferguson saying that he says what do you mean I saids brother the message doesn't say that you can't eat snake the Bible doesn't say that I says you pray over it and you want to eat it he says I can't condemn you I said you reason why I say that to you said but ain't going to keep your balance in the word when you hear things that's not in the message don't accept it it sounds look at how reasonable that sounds look at how reasonable I go to a congregation and I explain that oh brother I can easily form a Doctrine like what brother Paul was warning us about this morning I can easily but when you do things like that what do you do you displease God because you have formed in a doctrine that didn't come from the M of God I told him I said listen I says God cursed the whole earth because of Adam I said should me we should need from the earth here's where Church some of the stuff sounds so reasonable but if a prophet didn't bring it God didn't send it Malachi Force to restore all things amen I know I'm not popular with this kind of preaching right I know that that's fine that's fine doing good brother am could you say amen amen could you leave this meeting tonight and begin to do what the word of God says yes no man know it the father say the son reveal it to him who rals it to you it's not me that's right it's not your pastor sir it's not your brother he says no man the the the father safe and as the son reveals him amen we got to take these statements serious amen and come before the son and wait for him to give us the Revelation that's why he could tell Peter he said fresh and blood didn't reveal it to you but my father was just in heaven yes amen let's bow heads oh God in heaven the hour is here now we've heard the truths we have accepted the truths we've confessed to each other that we believe what you said but now we need to take a step further we need to invite you to give us the Revelation it's true that when we open our hearts and receive your word your Prophet tell us we have invited you in as you said if my word abide in you then father we have accepted your word just like the woman at the well when she says I received that thou art a prophet she accepted it but father you made that set that other step and the other step was to give her a revelation that rivers of living water could flow from her then down into the city she went as Moses went looking to Egypt she went into the city testifying yes as your Prophet said she was a house she was like a house on fire on a windy day Lord oh God Heaven the church has just got into a time of slumber feasting only in what they have heard not waiting for the Revelation the stimulation the quickening of your word as Moses when he met the pillar of fire as Paul when he met the pillar of fire oh God let it be tonight that there be a burden come upon the hearts of all of us here tonight to scream more than ever for Revelation not just one Revelation but for Revelation upon Revelation as we realize the importance of the word being revealed to us we thank you with all our hearts in Jesus name amen God bless every one of you I love you all with all my heart and if I said anything tonight that was contrary may God forgive me for it as brother Paul prayed God bless all of you brother
