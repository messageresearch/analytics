[7:54] under the false pretense oh my goodness
[7:59] under the false pretense of the true
[8:02] word he Associates himself with the word
[8:06] he did just the same thing that his his
[8:10] type did which was Judas 2,000 years ago
[8:15] what did he do Judas came in as a
[8:18] Believer being a devil from the
[8:21] beginning he was born the son of
[8:24] predition he pulled up over on Jesus C
[8:27] he know him from the very beginning amen
[8:30] for he was the word all right and
[8:33] remember Judas took the place as
[8:36] treasure and fell by money so does the
[8:41] church of this day the Catholic churches
[8:44] we noticed last night charging for
[8:45] novenas charging for prayers and
[8:48] charging for everything it's almost same
[8:50] that fell the same thing to the
[8:52] daughters of the Catholic church was the
[8:54] Protestant the whole thing wrapped up in
[8:57] money and Lord Judas
[9:00] and here's where he fell and there's
[9:02] where the Protestants
[9:04] fall watch rides a Pale Horse oh as he
[9:11] appears on his ride this last ride he's
[9:15] on his last now now that is not in our
[9:18] day that will be on down it's a seal for
[9:21] to because see the church is done gone
[9:23] up when this happens when Christ appears
[9:27] here on Earth as je as um as this fellow
[9:31] appears and becomes
[9:34] completely completely the devil from

[9:42] prophet then into the Beast of Devil
[9:45] Himself Hallelujah and he's riding on a
[9:49] Pale Horse colored all up mixed with all
[9:51] kind of colors to make him pale and
[9:53] deathly but when our Lord appears here
[9:57] on Earth he'll be right in on a Snow
[10:01] White Horse and he'll be completely
[10:04] fully the emmanual the word of God
[10:08] incarnate in a
[10:10] man how much different there is in
[10:13] that's the difference
[10:15] of notice the Antichrist is on a pale
[10:19] horse mixed colors a horse is a beast
[10:23] that represents a power his power is all
[10:25] mixed up why it's politics amen it's um
[10:30] it's National Powers it's uh religious
[10:34] Powers it's demon powers it's all kinds
[10:37] of powers mixed
[10:39] together a mixed Pale Horse was he's got
[10:42] all kinds of powers but when Jesus comes
[10:45] it's on a one solid color
[10:49] horse the word
[10:54] amen this one mixes his colors of red
[10:58] white black three colors in one
[11:01] represented in one and three powers
[11:05] represented in one white horse black
[11:08] horse red horse and three crowns in
[11:13] one sure I seen the crown

[11:33] Heaven purgatory and Earth three powers
[11:37] United
[11:38] together all mixed up in a color pale
[11:42] death spoken a whole thing political and
[11:45] and religious and and demon powers mixed

[11:52] politics Satan is
[11:55] smart sure don't try to out wi just just
[11:58] trust the Lord
[12:00] amen I've all went through it before all
[12:04] smart educations and things like that
[12:07] come from the wrong
[12:09] side just follow through the scripture
[12:12] find out if that's right follow King's
[12:14] Children see what they become then
[12:16] follow say children see what
[12:18] they not as I'm supporting ignorance not
[12:20] at all no but you take any person's
[12:24] Harley of the Bible very seldom and
[12:26] there's one named Paul that was a smart
[12:28] man and he said he had to forget
[12:30] everything he know in order to know
[12:31] Christ he said I never come to you with
[12:34] enticing words of wisdom of man but I
[12:36] come to you in the power of the
[12:38] resurrection of Christ that's right
[12:41] power of the Holy Ghost look at the
[12:42] others some of them didn't know right
[12:44] the left hand and and all I look down
[12:46] through the age of the prophets and
[12:47] where they come from and so forth see
[12:49] what I mean see it's a smart
[12:52] intellectual and wisdom wisdom is
[12:54] exactly the very thing that takes you
[12:56] away from God hallelujah
[12:59] he had three powers or three three
[13:01] Jewish dictions of Earth heaven and
[13:04] Purgatory he is himself a trinity that's
[13:07] what he's made up of and he rides in a
[13:10] trinity his powers in a trinity his
[13:12] crowns in a trinity his horses in a
[13:15] trinity that what he is a trinity a
[13:19] power of Trinity a crown of Trinity a
[13:22] horse riding of Trinity that's offices a
[13:25] four

[13:30] right three stages of his ministry makes
[13:34] him one person Satan incarnate three
[13:37] stages of the many
[13:39] Antichrist false prophet
[13:42] and
[13:44] Beast and three typing see now these
[13:47] three types now that makes him go uh God
[13:50] makes himself knowing too and water
[13:52] blood spirit makes a Christian a Son of
[13:55] God by the word of God see and these
[13:58] three power makes him a devil see all
[14:01] this sh is water blood and spirit which
[14:03] is of god and that's politics religion
[14:07] and Demon power mixed together makes him
[14:09] the devil Christ first coming Immortal

[19:01] realize that that's a that's a woman
[19:03] that lives untrue to her marriage vows
[19:06] you see she's supposed to be says
[19:09] herself calls herself the Queen of
[19:12] Heaven that would be the Bride of God
[19:15] God is Christ and we find that she's
[19:18] committing
[19:20] fornications and she's causing the king
[19:22] to the Earth to commit
[19:24] fornication all the rich man and great

[19:55] let's look the thing right in the face
[19:56] we're too late down the road I to go to
[19:57] pulling punches good here we are living
[20:00] in the lady of sin Church age and that
[20:01] was the most ridiculous Church age of
[20:03] all the rest of
[20:05] them Luke Warman the only one that
[20:08] Christ was on the outside trying to get
[20:10] back in and that's a Pentecostal

[20:30] tried to help himself but when he when
[20:33] he don't know it you can't tell him no
[20:34] different then he's in a bad shape God
[20:36] have
[20:37] mercy notice oh my I
[20:42] remember this Antichrist himself being
[20:45] the man his bride which is his church
[20:49] was given a space to repent and she did
[20:52] not do it in that church age th you
[20:55] remember can you let's go back this man
[20:57] it won't hurt us to go back just let's
[20:59] go back first second chapter just a
[21:02] minute we'll just read second chapter of
[21:07] now I'll watch this this right quick
[21:11] now my we're just about closing time
[21:14] haven't got started but notice thar now
[21:18] it begins at the 18th verse of the of
[21:21] the second chapter unto the Angel that's
[21:24] the messenger of the Church of Tara
[21:27] write these things say the Son of God
[21:30] who has his eyes like to flames and his
[21:33] feet lik to fine brass I Know Thy works
[21:37] and thy charity and thy service thy
[21:39] faith thy patience and the works and th
[21:44] uh has to be more than the and the last
[21:47] be more than the first not withstanding
[21:50] I have a few things against thee because
[21:52] thou suffers that woman
[21:55] Jezebel there you are you know her
[21:58] andine
[21:59] she was the wife of
[22:02] Ahab and here is the woman Church
[22:05] Jezebel the wife of the false prophet
[22:09] which is supposed to be the
[22:12] Janine prophet of God the
[22:16] poor right the genuine prophet and his
[22:20] wife
[22:22] Jezebel now Ahab was supposed to be a
[22:25] genuine
[22:26] Jew but he was a rascal
[22:30] you know
[22:31] that because his wife just let him any
[22:34] way he wanted
[22:35] to we find out Jezebel takes her money
[22:38] and leads these the way they want to
[22:40] too which cth herself a
[22:43] prophetess get
[22:45] it to teach and subdue my servants see
[22:49] that Jezebel teaching is equp the
[22:51] country the commit fornications and eat
[22:55] things a sacrifice the idol I gave her
[22:58] space to
[23:01] repent of her fornications and she
[23:03] repented not watch this next verse I
[23:07] will cast her into a bed that's hell and
[23:12] them that commit adultery with her onto
[23:15] great tribulations that's going into the
[23:16] great tribulations not the church now
[23:19] except they repent of their deeds now

[23:33] word I will kill them with death if
[23:36] they're killed they're Eternal
[23:39] separated all right remember he gave her
[23:42] a space to repent th Ty age was the Dark
[23:46] Age the dark horse rider rode in that
[23:50] time when all the masses and everything
[23:53] had to be paid for and the prayers and
[23:56] and the novenas and so forth now

[24:31] sometime and just like that church did
[24:35] it's
[24:36] over God patience will not always strive
[24:39] with man see and when she refused it and

[1:11:37] in Revelations chapter 5 we've been in
[1:11:39] there for a little bit and just
[1:11:43] can't um move from it right now in
[1:11:46] Revelations chapter 5 will'll

[1:11:52] few verses there we have you seated
[1:11:56] verse number
[1:11:57] one through
[1:12:02] 4 when you have that you can say
[1:12:10] amen and I saw in the right hand of him
[1:12:13] that sat on the throne a book written
[1:12:16] within and on the backside sealed with
[1:12:19] Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel
[1:12:23] proclaiming with a loud voice who is was
[1:12:25] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[1:12:28] seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor
[1:12:31] in Earth neither under the Earth was
[1:12:34] able to open the book neither to look
[1:12:38] thereon and I wept much because no man
[1:12:42] was found worthy to open and to read the
[1:12:45] book neither to look
[1:12:48] thereon amen we will ask God's blessings
[1:12:53] the reading of his word

[1:12:59] read your holy word word father we pray
[1:13:02] that you now would take the service into
[1:13:04] your care and bless each one we pray in
[1:13:07] Jesus name amen God bless you may be
[1:13:11] seated title of the message this morning
[1:13:15] the most Sublime thing in
[1:13:19] scripture the most Sublime thing in
[1:13:22] scripture is what is just taking place
[1:13:25] in Revelations chapter 5 we have taken
[1:13:29] this scripture and we read and if you
[1:13:32] continue reading on in verse number five
[1:13:35] and then eight down through verse 14 you
[1:13:40] see this is a tremendous happening
[1:13:42] taking place why is the Elder John
[1:13:48] weeping why is he so
[1:13:51] moved that he wept because no man can
[1:13:57] open this book what kind of book was in
[1:14:00] it what kind of book was it and what was
[1:14:03] in it that would cause the Apostle to be
[1:14:06] so
[1:14:07] overwhelmed that he wept much because no
[1:14:11] man was worthy to even look at this book
[1:14:14] and we know that this book was a
[1:14:16] complete Plan of
[1:14:18] Redemption we know that this book held
[1:14:20] names in it and the whole uh Recon
[1:14:25] ilation of sin would be dealt with once
[1:14:29] a kinsman redeemer was found worthy
[1:14:32] enough to take this book and to loose
[1:14:36] the seals and to open
[1:14:38] them and so we are grateful and thankful
[1:14:42] that we know what day and time of the
[1:14:44] week it is we know that we are in not
[1:14:47] the sixth Church age not the fifth
[1:14:50] Church age but we're in the seventh
[1:14:51] Church age and the scripture says in
[1:14:54] Revelations 10
[1:14:56] 1-7 verse 7 but in the days of the voice
[1:15:00] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[1:15:03] to sound what else does it say The
[1:15:06] Mysteries of God should be what finished
[1:15:11] if brother brandom is not the seventh
[1:15:14] angel then tell me who
[1:15:18] is and if he is not the seventh angel
[1:15:22] you better find one that can fulfill
[1:15:25] this scripture that's right somebody has
[1:15:27] to fit that role and it's so easy to say
[1:15:30] what's not what's not what's not what
[1:15:33] are we going to replace it with let's
[1:15:35] take some of the greatest men and Minds
[1:15:37] that we known in the Pentecostal
[1:15:39] movement let's take the Reverend Oral
[1:15:42] Roberts phenomenal Ministry worldwide
[1:15:46] Ministry outlived his life and his
[1:15:49] ministry is still carrying on those that
[1:15:51] hold his Theology and that position
[1:15:55] can we say that or Roberts would fit
[1:15:59] that scripture to reveal the Mysteries
[1:16:03] that were supposed to be revealed can we
[1:16:05] say that with an honest face would it be
[1:16:07] the Reverend Billy
[1:16:09] Graham would it be any of the
[1:16:11] Pentecostal fathers even the great FF
[1:16:15] Bosworth great man or uh Smith
[1:16:19] Wigglesworth or even the little brother
[1:16:22] the oneeyed black man in isus that
[1:16:25] brought that original Pentecostal move
[1:16:29] the Reverend William Seymour would he
[1:16:31] fulfill Revelations
[1:16:35] 10:7 who is it who could it
[1:16:38] be um um the great evangelists is of our
[1:16:43] day the ones that have come and gone and
[1:16:45] so let's fast forward today do we have
[1:16:47] somebody
[1:16:48] today would it the Bishop TD
[1:16:52] Jake how about our friend uh Joel
[1:16:56] ostein he's just a friendly guy I have
[1:16:58] to call him a friend he looks like a
[1:17:00] nice guy I've had so many customers tell
[1:17:04] me they would love to go to his church I
[1:17:06] know a Greek or Orthodox attorney said
[1:17:09] he went all the way to Dallas or Houston
[1:17:12] wherever he is and he had to go to
[1:17:14] brother olin's church he don't even
[1:17:16] believe like
[1:17:17] that but would it be the the Reverend
[1:17:20] Joel
[1:17:22] ostein F find a minister find one just
[1:17:25] pick one so so so I want to Value what
[1:17:29] you're following so when I stand up here
[1:17:32] and I'm reading the quotations of the
[1:17:34] Reverend William brandham I'm G to be
[1:17:37] reading from
[1:17:38] somebody and so are you it might be Fox
[1:17:42] News it might be something you heard out
[1:17:44] there and that's what you're you got it
[1:17:47] all figured out and you have something
[1:17:48] that you have to Center Your Truth
[1:17:51] around and I thank God that that
[1:17:54] question has been answer for me and I
[1:17:55] don't want to be obnoxious to those who
[1:17:59] don't have that answer but this is my
[1:18:02] answer the Reverend William brandham
[1:18:05] fulfills this scripture in Revelations
[1:18:08] 10:7 one that would come to reveal the
[1:18:12] Mysteries as contained throughout the
[1:18:15] entire Bible That's Right amen and so
[1:18:19] brothers and sisters be encouraged we
[1:18:21] have nothing to be ashamed of we have
[1:18:25] nothing to hide or put our head down
[1:18:28] because God has done a marvelous thing
[1:18:32] and opening up his word to us and that's
[1:18:34] what I'm here on this particular message
[1:18:38] here the most Sublime thing in the
[1:18:41] scripture we took of course a couple of
[1:18:43] services on this Hebrew servant that in
[1:18:47] in the Commonwealth of Israel so that
[1:18:49] none would be broke or lose it all the
[1:18:54] Lord had a year of release he released
[1:18:57] them from their creditors and their debt
[1:19:00] it was a law that God established so
[1:19:03] that you just came out of Egypt you're
[1:19:06] not going to handle one another the way
[1:19:08] the Egyptians handled you so after seven
[1:19:11] years you've been bound you owe this
[1:19:13] money at the year release comes I'll
[1:19:16] blow the trumpet the priest will blow
[1:19:18] the trumpet and then when you hear the
[1:19:21] sound of the trumpet it's a sign that
[1:19:23] you can go free it's a great reset we're
[1:19:27] going to reset you messed up bad
[1:19:30] investment did something wrong you lost
[1:19:33] this you fondled that but now you're in
[1:19:36] bondage for seven years and when the
[1:19:39] trumpet sounds you can go free brother
[1:19:42] banam we went through the scriptures and
[1:19:44] the quotes on that brother banham brings
[1:19:46] the type to us for today that we hear
[1:19:49] the gospel trumpet and when that gospel
[1:19:52] trumpet we hear it through our ear right
[1:19:55] and once you hear that not everybody can
[1:19:57] hear it some people can be in range of
[1:19:59] it and still not hear it but how many
[1:20:01] remember when you heard
[1:20:03] it you had to move didn't you you had to
[1:20:06] get up even if it drugg you to the altar
[1:20:10] you had to come forward because
[1:20:13] something was calling your name it's a
[1:20:17] very pivotable point in your life very
[1:20:21] memorable you don't have to make it up
[1:20:24] have this not something you're trying to
[1:20:26] make up this is what happened to me I
[1:20:29] was going this way and then I Heard a
[1:20:31] Voice and he turned my heart this
[1:20:36] way that will always be with
[1:20:39] me you know on you hear the death of
[1:20:42] saints many Saints dying they'll and
[1:20:45] they start to lose their faculties their
[1:20:47] memory they'll forget their wives name
[1:20:50] they'll forget their children's name
[1:20:52] they'll forget many things but some of
[1:20:54] the last things things they they will
[1:20:55] never forget are the old
[1:20:59] hymns they'll never forget the name
[1:21:02] Jesus it's a beautiful thing because
[1:21:04] it's a it's a happening that stays with
[1:21:08] you when you hear that gospel trumpet
[1:21:11] it's you know I've been you know
[1:21:13] preaching over 30 years now I've sat
[1:21:17] under seven different pastors over the
[1:21:20] years and like I said I tease all the
[1:21:22] time I don't look that old
[1:21:25] but I've been around a little bit I'm
[1:21:27] going stop teasing that way because then
[1:21:28] I might start looking old
[1:21:30] too but I've been around for a little
[1:21:33] bit and I've seen a lot of things go on
[1:21:35] and take place over the years but when I
[1:21:38] start talking about those early years of
[1:21:41] the Lord calling me it just moves me
[1:21:45] brother
[1:21:46] Bobby because I remember what I used to
[1:21:48] be and how he turned me over to here
[1:21:52] that is the gospel trumpet that's the
[1:21:55] hearing of the word of Truth and that
[1:21:58] old Hebrew servant now he has to make a
[1:22:02] decision and the decision is would you
[1:22:05] like to continue on with your master
[1:22:07] they've been good to you they feed you
[1:22:09] well he's a good boss or would you like
[1:22:13] to go free now when he makes this
[1:22:15] decision to stay with his master he's
[1:22:19] got to go to the priest there must be a
[1:22:21] witness and he's got to say it from his
[1:22:23] mouth I love my master I want to stay
[1:22:27] and you know the master can make it look
[1:22:30] convenient make it seem you know cool or
[1:22:33] the nice thing to do but once he makes
[1:22:36] that decision he can never go free
[1:22:39] again it's a GameChanger for the rest of
[1:22:43] his life from this day on forward if he
[1:22:47] stays with that Master no matter what no
[1:22:51] matter what other trumpet sound no
[1:22:53] matter other folks that are in the the
[1:22:56] agreement with the master they might go
[1:22:57] free you can never go free and they take
[1:23:01] that all pierce it through the earlobe
[1:23:04] of his ear because that's where he heard
[1:23:06] the trumpet and he made the decision to
[1:23:09] stay
[1:23:11] permanent and so we see that this gospel
[1:23:13] trumpet is the announcing or the
[1:23:18] proclamation that you can go free now
[1:23:22] this this Proclamation it's written all
[1:23:25] through your Bible we can talk about you
[1:23:27] being free for our Salvation we could
[1:23:30] talk about your healing we can talk
[1:23:32] about any Redemptive blessing you need
[1:23:35] the Peace of Mind the peace of God your
[1:23:38] family needs to be saved you find that
[1:23:40] in the word and that sounds to you you
[1:23:43] can have
[1:23:44] that and you know uh this great
[1:23:48] happening that happened here in um
[1:23:51] Revelations chapter 5 brother vandom
[1:23:54] makes makes that statement he said it's
[1:23:55] the most Sublime thing in the scripture
[1:23:59] so let's look at it just for a moment in
[1:24:01] Revelations chapter 5 here the great
[1:24:04] Apostle is weeping he's emotional this
[1:24:07] is not a nothing this is a
[1:24:10] something that causes him to to to
[1:24:15] recognize that even all the Angelic host
[1:24:18] in heaven they can't open the book good
[1:24:22] men like job and Daniel and Joseph great
[1:24:27] men who had tremendous testimony like
[1:24:30] Ezra and Nehemiah some of the great
[1:24:33] prophets throughout the ages couldn't
[1:24:36] open this book men better than you and I
[1:24:40] great men men that the angel of the Lord
[1:24:44] came to men that show that was shown
[1:24:47] God's glory men like Moses men like
[1:24:51] David that had a heart after God the
[1:24:54] great tremendous man throughout the
[1:24:57] entire Bible were not worthy to open
[1:24:59] this book and John
[1:25:03] wept now in verse number five the
[1:25:06] scripture goes and says this and one of
[1:25:08] the elders Sith unto me weep not Behold
[1:25:12] The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root
[1:25:16] of David hath prevailed to open the book
[1:25:20] and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and
[1:25:23] behold and lo in the midst of the throne
[1:25:26] and of the four beasts and in the midst
[1:25:27] of the elders stood a lamb as it had
[1:25:30] been slain having seven horns seven eyes
[1:25:34] which are the seven spirits of God sent
[1:25:37] forth into all the Earth and he came and
[1:25:41] took the book out of the right hand of
[1:25:43] him that sat upon the throne so here
[1:25:46] John in the great vision the Lord's
[1:25:48] showing them these things he's weeping
[1:25:51] no man's worthy then the Elder tells to
[1:25:54] stop weeping the lion has prevailed and
[1:25:58] when he hears that the lion has
[1:26:00] prevailed and he turns and he went to to
[1:26:04] go look and see and he says in the midst
[1:26:06] of the throne here arises a lamb a
[1:26:11] bloody lamb that was slain now we can
[1:26:15] get a kind of a visual of what's taking
[1:26:18] place we can see uh uh Calvary we can
[1:26:21] see the Old Testament land that was
[1:26:24] slain that something now is being
[1:26:27] redeemed a price is being paid and now
[1:26:31] the lamb comes forth out of the midst of
[1:26:35] the throne and he takes this book it's
[1:26:40] it's so Sublime if you're a Christian
[1:26:43] today this is what happened to
[1:26:45] you this is your
[1:26:48] experience this is your
[1:26:51] testimony as I've been sharing with the
[1:26:53] church here on the Wednesday night
[1:26:55] conduct order and Doctrine and under the
[1:26:59] conduct I was just sharing it with the
[1:27:01] church and I quoted it last uh yesterday
[1:27:04] evening that we as Believers on the
[1:27:07] outward motion one of the greatest
[1:27:10] single outward things that we can
[1:27:14] identify that God is dealing with
[1:27:17] someone as we watch How often they come
[1:27:20] to the house of the Lord particularly
[1:27:22] newcomers
[1:27:24] I I've gone to visit different places
[1:27:26] and you'll see a new face in the place
[1:27:28] and you'll ask about them oh this
[1:27:29] brother I used to work with them he
[1:27:32] finally decide to come to church first
[1:27:34] thing I'd ask how long has he been
[1:27:36] coming oh he's been coming for like two
[1:27:38] months now he hasn't missed the service
[1:27:41] and it's likeing okay God's dealing with
[1:27:43] him something's going on there it's not
[1:27:46] everything but it is
[1:27:48] something and it's just an outward
[1:27:51] identification that you can say
[1:27:53] something something is happening in this
[1:27:56] young lady's life or this young man's
[1:27:58] life and I started to meditate on that
[1:28:00] even more and I started to think of what
[1:28:03] would be one of the greatest things that
[1:28:07] a Believer has from his very birthday at
[1:28:11] the altar wherever it is and coming to
[1:28:14] Christ up till today what would be the
[1:28:18] greatest um relationship what would be
[1:28:21] the greatest constant thing that we do
[1:28:25] as Believers that helps to keep us clean
[1:28:29] and I can't think of anything
[1:28:32] greater than
[1:28:36] repentance the ability to
[1:28:40] repent and find
[1:28:43] Grace when you messed
[1:28:46] up what if that was taken from us
[1:28:50] today what if from today no more mistake
[1:28:55] your repenting is over this is your last
[1:28:58] chance to repent today after this if you
[1:29:02] messed up you're out of here well all of
[1:29:04] us just need to quit right there we
[1:29:06] wouldn't even step out of this
[1:29:08] building huh because repentance is the
[1:29:12] single greatest thing that a man I don't
[1:29:17] care how long he's been in church how
[1:29:20] how new he is to church he'll always
[1:29:24] be finding grace and mercy Lord forgive
[1:29:29] me I'm messed up I'm wrong I'm not where
[1:29:32] I should be my mind isn't right I got a
[1:29:36] bad attitude I didn't handle that Lord
[1:29:38] forgive me I'm
[1:29:41] sorry how many know what I'm talking
[1:29:44] about is that valuable to you or
[1:29:47] not oh my think of it think if we
[1:29:51] couldn't have that but he has provided
[1:29:54] that for us the reason I can preach this
[1:29:57] morning is because I repented this
[1:30:00] morning the reason you can come and
[1:30:02] worship this morning because there's
[1:30:05] blood on the throne there's Mercy on the
[1:30:08] throne the reason those of you that can
[1:30:10] dance in the spirit You Can Dance
[1:30:13] because of his Mercy because of his
[1:30:16] grace I can worship God I can read my
[1:30:21] Bible I can say Amen to the word I can
[1:30:25] go forward with God because of
[1:30:31] repentance
[1:30:32] amen I'm so glad about
[1:30:37] it and this
[1:30:40] lamb removes
[1:30:42] himself or appears and comes forth out
[1:30:46] of the throne look at verse number
[1:30:49] eight and when he had taken the
[1:30:52] book and the four beasts and four and 20
[1:30:55] Elders fell down before the lamb having
[1:30:58] every one of them Harps golden vows full
[1:31:03] of the odors which are the prayers of
[1:31:05] the
[1:31:06] Saints what did they
[1:31:09] do they sung a new
[1:31:12] song saying
[1:31:14] what Thou Art
[1:31:16] Worthy Thou Art
[1:31:19] Worthy one of them songs right Thou Art
[1:31:22] Worthy oh Lord
[1:31:25] Amen to receive Glory blessings and
[1:31:27] honor they sang this
[1:31:30] song and he
[1:31:33] says for thou was slain and H has
[1:31:36] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[1:31:38] every Kindred and tongue and people and
[1:31:40] nation and has made us unto our God
[1:31:43] Kings and Priests and we shall reign on
[1:31:46] Earth and
[1:31:47] behold and I heard the voice of many
[1:31:50] angels round about the throne and the
[1:31:52] Beast and the elders
[1:31:54] and the number of them was 10,000 time
[1:31:56] 10,000 and thousands of thousands
[1:31:59] there's a lot of people here now saying
[1:32:02] with the loud voice do you think that
[1:32:04] was like our praise service today you
[1:32:07] think they looking around see who ain't
[1:32:10] praising him is there a worship leader
[1:32:13] saying y'all stand up and help me praise
[1:32:15] the Lord was there somebody else pushing
[1:32:17] them along helping them to appreciate
[1:32:19] what's taking place no no no them seats
[1:32:23] stayed here on the
[1:32:25] Earth but the real worshipper showed up
[1:32:28] here in Revelations 5 and when it saw
[1:32:31] the lamb take the book and see that the
[1:32:35] book was taken and the seals can be open
[1:32:37] now and now we can be saved now oh
[1:32:42] mighty begin to praise and worship the
[1:32:46] Lord and that's what we come here to do
[1:32:49] today praise and worship him saying with
[1:32:52] the very low message Voice verse
[1:32:56] 12 we need to rewrite our Bibles
[1:33:00] Revelations chap 12 I can't hear some of
[1:33:02] y'all praise the
[1:33:04] Lord said well brother Israel uh loud is
[1:33:08] a relative
[1:33:10] term I am very loud if
[1:33:13] you yeah but like brother juel for
[1:33:18] said I've watched the prices
[1:33:21] right and it ain't just black people
[1:33:23] praising the Lord on Price is Right is
[1:33:26] that excuse like we like to use sometime
[1:33:29] you know blacks whites all of them
[1:33:31] jumping up running up and down because
[1:33:33] they want a new car or
[1:33:35] whatever and so saying with the loud
[1:33:39] voice Worthy is the Lamb that was
[1:33:42] slain to receive power and riches and
[1:33:45] wisdom and strength and honor and glory
[1:33:49] and
[1:33:51] blessing and so what's John doing in re
[1:33:53] rations chap 13 Revelations 5:13 and
[1:33:57] every creature which is in heaven and on
[1:34:00] the earth and under the Earth and such
[1:34:03] as are in the sea and all that are in
[1:34:07] them heard
[1:34:09] who heard I this is John the Apostle
[1:34:14] saying blessing and honor and glory and
[1:34:20] power be unto him that sited upon the
[1:34:23] throne
[1:34:24] anathan the lamb forever and ever and
[1:34:27] the 4B said amen and the 420 Elders fell
[1:34:31] down and worship him that liveth forever
[1:34:34] and ever so John wasn't a
[1:34:37] spectator but every creature in heaven
[1:34:40] heard
[1:34:42] him every creature on the earth heard
[1:34:45] him and everything under the Earth heard
[1:34:50] I John
[1:34:53] giving praises to the lamb so this is a
[1:34:58] tremendous event wouldn't you say so
[1:35:02] something tremendous is happening here
[1:35:03] so if repentance would be one of the
[1:35:06] greater
[1:35:08] things that a Believer must
[1:35:12] develop to be a believer you have to be
[1:35:15] able to
[1:35:16] repent it's it comes before water
[1:35:20] baptism right is repentance
[1:35:24] repent and be
[1:35:27] baptized and you shall receive the gift
[1:35:29] of the Holy Ghost if repentance is one
[1:35:31] of the greatest things one of the worst
[1:35:34] things is for you not to
[1:35:37] repent or to move forward in your
[1:35:41] journey with unconfessed
[1:35:45] sins brother randam deals with this
[1:35:49] repentance he says if you thoroughly
[1:35:52] repent and you're properly taught the
[1:35:56] moment you're baptized the Holy Ghost
[1:35:59] should come upon you and you should be
[1:36:00] filled with the Holy Ghost that's what
[1:36:02] he said so the onus is on the teaching
[1:36:06] and the hus is upon those who are coming
[1:36:08] that they thoroughly repent now it
[1:36:11] doesn't happen all that way many of us
[1:36:14] repent we come to the Lord It's A year
[1:36:16] later six months later two years later I
[1:36:19] knew one Pastor or Minister told me it
[1:36:21] took him 10 years before the Lord filled
[1:36:24] him with the Holy Ghost and um that's a
[1:36:28] long time right but when you thoroughly
[1:36:31] repent and now now you can move on with
[1:36:35] the things that the Lord has for you
[1:36:36] those promises that he has for
[1:36:39] you so in the message Easter seal
[1:36:42] brother random says this here in
[1:36:44] paragraph number
[1:36:47] 107 God gave Abraham a promise Abraham
[1:36:50] believed God and it was imputed unto him
[1:36:52] for righteousness but he sealed the
[1:36:54] Covenant by the Seal of circumcision and
[1:36:57] God gives you a promise potentially that
[1:37:00] you will receive it and you're going to
[1:37:03] be raised up this body is going to be
[1:37:05] glorified with him at the end of time
[1:37:08] but you see you have to get a clearance
[1:37:12] on that deed and the clearance is when
[1:37:15] everything against it has be stricken
[1:37:18] off and you got the abstract to it you
[1:37:21] got the seal it's yours everything is on
[1:37:25] it be Belongs to You amen and when we
[1:37:28] believe on Jesus Christ for our savior
[1:37:31] and repent and are baptized and come up
[1:37:35] to believe him God recognizes our
[1:37:39] repentance and our faith towards him and
[1:37:43] sends down the abstract and the abstract
[1:37:46] is the Assurance it's the guarantee that
[1:37:48] everything was ever held against you you
[1:37:51] thoroughly repent
[1:37:54] Hallelujah and the property is boughten
[1:37:58] and you hold the abstract for the
[1:38:01] Assurance let somebody try to put you
[1:38:03] off the land and say he belongs and you
[1:38:06] you with the abstract in your hand let
[1:38:08] him try to do it there ain't a law in
[1:38:10] the land can do it because you hold the
[1:38:14] abstract and there's no devil no church
[1:38:18] or any theology that can overstep the
[1:38:21] boundaries of God's proof and Abstract
[1:38:25] that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost has
[1:38:28] recognized Us in Jesus Christ we're just
[1:38:31] as sure to raise as he raised because
[1:38:35] potentially we have already raised in
[1:38:38] him
[1:38:40] amen the old things what does it do to
[1:38:43] our mortal bodies it turns our opinion
[1:38:46] changes our Notions it sets our
[1:38:49] affection on things which are above and
[1:38:52] smoking drinking gas gambling the things
[1:38:54] you used to do is dead it's beneath you
[1:38:58] how many can say praise the Lord so we
[1:39:01] see as I said this happens to the
[1:39:04] believer even to
[1:39:07] today the believer that comes to Christ
[1:39:10] we see this lamb coming forth I'm going
[1:39:13] to take this in the message to breach
[1:39:15] I'll be in here just for a
[1:39:17] moment and then I'll come back to these
[1:39:20] quotes in paragraph number 200 in the
[1:39:22] breach brother
[1:39:24] says
[1:39:28] this he's talking about this great event
[1:39:30] that took place with John he has this
[1:39:34] Vision he sees it taking place the
[1:39:36] Weeping the lion and then the lamb takes
[1:39:40] the book and everybody begins to praise
[1:39:42] and worship now here the Lord is leading
[1:39:47] brother brandom here and he says here in
[1:39:48] paragraph number 200 oh would not it be
[1:39:52] a glorious thing if our sinful thoughts
[1:39:56] tonight could be laid aside long enough
[1:40:00] to accept him he would Advance all the
[1:40:03] way from Glory tonight to make himself
[1:40:07] known to any of you so let me ask you
[1:40:10] where does Revelations come from when
[1:40:12] God reveals truth to you where does that
[1:40:15] come from we know the lamb is on the
[1:40:18] throne uh as a
[1:40:21] mediator for our sin sin God looks
[1:40:25] through him and the entire Earth is
[1:40:28] being held off from major judgment
[1:40:31] because of the Lamb there's still Mercy
[1:40:34] On The Mercy Seat can I get a witness
[1:40:37] there's still Blood on the throne
[1:40:40] Mercy is not over it's still there but
[1:40:44] when the Revelation comes to you who's
[1:40:46] giving you that Revelation well Jesus
[1:40:48] said if a man would would um um um open
[1:40:54] their heart he said he would come and
[1:40:55] suck with them and he would not leave
[1:40:58] you comfortless so he'll send the Holy
[1:41:01] Ghost to that believer he personally
[1:41:05] identifies himself with the the new
[1:41:10] disciple it's Jesus himself it's not an
[1:41:13] angel it's not one of his
[1:41:14] Representatives it's not somebody in his
[1:41:17] place but it's Christ himself making
[1:41:21] himself known to the individual ual I
[1:41:24] can't I can't think of how beautiful
[1:41:26] that is the words to express how
[1:41:29] beautiful that is when a man comes to
[1:41:32] Christ that's who he's coming to and
[1:41:35] when something touches his heart that's
[1:41:37] the Lord Jesus touching his heart he say
[1:41:41] Lord come into my heart that is him the
[1:41:44] Lord Of Glory coming into your heart and
[1:41:47] when he changes your mind and gives you
[1:41:49] truth and gives you a revelation that is
[1:41:51] him the Lord Jesus giv giving you truth
[1:41:54] giving you a revelation and when your
[1:41:56] sinful thoughts can go away from you and
[1:41:58] you repent of your sins he'll come from
[1:42:02] Glory down to the
[1:42:05] believer down to to sou
[1:42:08] Arizona he'll come to your neighborhood
[1:42:12] he'll come to your prison cell he'll
[1:42:14] come to your bedside in the hospital
[1:42:17] he'll come when you call him to come
[1:42:20] he'll leave from glory to come down and
[1:42:22] make himself
[1:42:24] known to the individual and who is it
[1:42:27] it's the Lamb of God
[1:42:31] Amen I love that don't
[1:42:33] you I read that one more time oh
[1:42:36] wouldn't it be a glorious thing if our
[1:42:38] sinful thoughts tonight could be laid
[1:42:40] aside long enough to accept him he would
[1:42:43] Advance all the way from Glory tonight
[1:42:46] to make himself known to any of
[1:42:50] you now
[1:42:53] that's what we need that's what this
[1:42:55] church
[1:42:56] needs that's what our ministers need
[1:43:00] that's what the pastors need that's what
[1:43:03] all believers need is this lamb to come
[1:43:07] to us
[1:43:09] individually now this
[1:43:12] repenting such a key part of our life in
[1:43:14] our
[1:43:15] walk not only do we repent to God how
[1:43:19] many you know we got to look sometimes
[1:43:23] brothers and sisters in the face you say
[1:43:26] I'm wrong I'm
[1:43:29] sorry I have some fired up amens on that
[1:43:32] first part saying Lord I'm sorry I was
[1:43:35] wrong we can all identifi that's easy
[1:43:38] Lord because it's Lord I'm sorry I'm
[1:43:42] wrong but look eyeball to eyeball with
[1:43:45] sister or
[1:43:46] brother and even deeper than that sinner
[1:43:50] folks people who don't know nothing
[1:43:52] about the word
[1:43:53] you got to go tell them you was
[1:43:55] wrong if they're not obligated to tell
[1:43:58] you you are
[1:44:00] obligated as a Believer because you
[1:44:03] don't want these sins over your life you
[1:44:06] don't want to live a life with all of
[1:44:08] these loose issues and problems and I
[1:44:11] and I and it's true there's some people
[1:44:13] that had a hard time saying I was wrong
[1:44:15] I messed up they say I was wrong
[1:44:18] but yeah you started it anyways remember
[1:44:22] that I was wrong but if you would have
[1:44:25] been nicer I wouldn't have reacted that
[1:44:27] way stop go back stop it you was
[1:44:32] wrong
[1:44:36] period oh that's hard right now I can
[1:44:38] feel it I can feel the rub yeah feel it
[1:44:41] who in here wasn't wrong that's right
[1:44:43] nobody can pick that book up nobody was
[1:44:47] worthy there was only one that was
[1:44:50] worthy to hold the book that can declare
[1:44:54] and bring Kinsman and Redeemer and that
[1:44:56] was the Lamb of God he's the only
[1:45:00] one that never did no
[1:45:05] wrong some of y'all need to make it
[1:45:08] right the way you looking at
[1:45:11] me that's all right I'm not gonna wait
[1:45:13] for you to say sorry I forgive you
[1:45:16] anyways you know I'm teasing all right
[1:45:19] God bless
[1:45:20] you this repenting is not only with God
[1:45:24] it's with
[1:45:25] individuals it's with other
[1:45:28] people it's a it's a way of
[1:45:32] life the reason why we can repent is
[1:45:36] because Revelations 5 a lamb came up out
[1:45:39] of the midst of the
[1:45:41] throne the reason why we can say I'm
[1:45:44] sorry because the lamb came up out of
[1:45:47] the
[1:45:48] throne because of Calvary we can make
[1:45:51] things right in our life amen
[1:45:55] amen now brother bam continues in this
[1:46:01] message on the wings of a snow white
[1:46:03] dove he says this in paragraph 299 now
[1:46:06] the Lord can show me a vision he could
[1:46:08] tell me what's the matter with e each
[1:46:10] one of them I can prove that to you see
[1:46:14] you know that but that don't heal them
[1:46:16] that doesn't heal them no it's got to be
[1:46:19] something dropped in them see and I hope
[1:46:22] like I could go up here and take each
[1:46:25] one of you and baptize you in the name
[1:46:27] of the Lord Jesus Christ that won't
[1:46:29] remit your sins no no no I don't believe
[1:46:34] in water baptism in the name
[1:46:36] of of Jesus Christ unto regeneration I
[1:46:39] believe the blood is regeneration see
[1:46:42] not the water but you see I could
[1:46:44] baptize and baptize but you only go down
[1:46:47] a dry Center come up a wet one see only
[1:46:51] you have thoroughly until you have
[1:46:54] thoroughly repented repent and then be
[1:46:57] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:47:00] that's why I differ with the Oneness
[1:47:01] movement not baptizing to Regeneration
[1:47:04] no I believe it's the blood that
[1:47:06] cleanses not the water see repentance
[1:47:09] then be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:47:13] Christ brother ROM continues Revelations
[1:47:15] chapter 4 number three
[1:47:18] 1961 the prophet says
[1:47:21] this by faith were walking Grace what
[1:47:25] did what God did for you that's right
[1:47:28] you believe God you believe on God and
[1:47:31] as soon as you're sorry you're already
[1:47:38] forgiven excuse me this is one of my
[1:47:41] favorite quotes I had this for years and
[1:47:44] years and then last year or so I was
[1:47:47] trying to find it and I was coming back
[1:47:49] through this message again I found this
[1:47:50] one here where brother bam it's really
[1:47:53] breaking this down I think this is
[1:47:54] really good paragraph
[1:47:56] 180 by faith you are walk in Grace what
[1:47:59] God did for you that's right you believe
[1:48:01] God you believe on God and as soon as
[1:48:03] you are sorry you're already forgiven I
[1:48:06] was speaking to a brother yesterday kind
[1:48:09] of got a little mixed up on it and I
[1:48:11] said look brother if you said something
[1:48:14] to hurt your wife's feeling immediately
[1:48:17] you'll feel sorry for her you're sorry
[1:48:21] you did it you're all already repented
[1:48:23] in your heart that's right but you've
[1:48:26] got to go tell her about it you got to
[1:48:29] go say honey I'm sorry I said that then
[1:48:33] you
[1:48:35] what so part of the repentance is
[1:48:38] feeling sorry in your heart and many
[1:48:41] people well you they know I feel bad
[1:48:43] about it they know I'm feel sorry in my
[1:48:45] heart that's only part of it you have to
[1:48:48] go and say those words go to her go to
[1:48:53] him you got to go and say honey I'm
[1:48:56] sorry I said that then you've thoroughly
[1:48:58] repented now that's the way it is with
[1:49:01] God a man that would go and say I hurt
[1:49:04] her feelings don't make any difference
[1:49:06] I'll tell her I'm sorry but really I'm
[1:49:08] not you're a hypocrite see that's right
[1:49:11] that will never be received by God well
[1:49:14] I said I was
[1:49:16] sorry but if it's not in your
[1:49:19] heart you've got to thoroughly be sorry
[1:49:22] for your sins then when you know that
[1:49:25] you're sorry for your sins and then
[1:49:28] repentance and be baptized in the name
[1:49:30] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:49:32] your sins you shall receive forgiveness
[1:49:36] receive the Holy Ghost see just simple
[1:49:39] God has made it so
[1:49:43] simple amen so Prophet go continues in
[1:49:47] the message of God be with us then we're
[1:49:48] are all the Miracles paragraph number
[1:49:51] 193
[1:49:53] now if there's any of you got duck
[1:49:57] nature you got a great big pool back
[1:50:00] here see if you can smell if you got a
[1:50:03] whiff that God remains God if you got a
[1:50:06] whiff from Heaven tonight the God keeps
[1:50:09] his word and he's a miracle working God
[1:50:12] you haven't received the Holy Ghost yet
[1:50:14] smell the water the first thing he said
[1:50:16] do certainly repent from the bottom of
[1:50:19] your heart and lay yourself as a
[1:50:22] sacrifice Christ on the Altar and you
[1:50:24] will be consumed of the world and Born
[1:50:27] Again of the spirit and be baptized in
[1:50:29] the name of Jesus Christ he'll fill you
[1:50:31] with the Holy Ghost go through the right
[1:50:34] process not come shake hands with the
[1:50:37] preacher or put your name on the book
[1:50:40] but die so dead that you don't know the
[1:50:43] world no more so this is part of the
[1:50:47] issue with um those that don't receive
[1:50:50] the Holy Ghost is the repentance part
[1:50:54] not thoroughly
[1:50:57] repenting halfway repenting maybe just
[1:50:59] coming through some of the emotions of
[1:51:01] it but the Lord is faithful and just to
[1:51:05] forgive us of our sins if we confess
[1:51:09] them is that right if we say we have no
[1:51:12] sins we're not telling the truth it's a
[1:51:16] lie the scriptures tell us that in 1
[1:51:19] John 1 and8 if we say we have no sin we
[1:51:22] deceive who
[1:51:25] ourselves and the truth is not in us if
[1:51:28] we confess our sins he is faithful and
[1:51:32] just to forgive us of our sins and to
[1:51:35] cleanse us from all
[1:51:36] unrighteousness if we say that we have
[1:51:39] not sinned we make him a liar and his
[1:51:43] word is not in
[1:51:45] us so this uh sins the sins that we have
[1:51:50] we all have them but we can get rid of
[1:51:53] those sins by
[1:51:55] confession it's through
[1:51:57] repentance that we do that now the
[1:52:01] trouble with the unconfessed
[1:52:04] sins is it becomes iniquity when we know
[1:52:08] that we should make it right but we
[1:52:10] don't and we can live years and and live
[1:52:16] seasons of our life with this
[1:52:19] unconfessed sin hanging over us but you
[1:52:22] know it's God's grace and mercy that he
[1:52:26] doesn't uh uh uh call us with that sin
[1:52:29] on us he he shows us grace and mercy and
[1:52:34] gives us the opportunity to repent God
[1:52:37] is not going to repent for you you have
[1:52:41] to repent for yourself God will lead you
[1:52:44] to repentance he'll make it available
[1:52:46] for you to repent the price is paid for
[1:52:49] your repentance and he will make you uh
[1:52:53] understand and aware that you need to
[1:52:55] repent but he's not going to repent on
[1:52:58] your behalf repentance comes from the
[1:53:02] individual I am sorry Lord I um
[1:53:07] transgress your laws and I want to be
[1:53:10] made back whole again I want to come
[1:53:12] back into your fellowship and the
[1:53:14] fellowship of your word and The
[1:53:16] Fellowship of the Holy Spirit one and
[1:53:18] number two when we come to Christ and we
[1:53:22] rep rep of our sins and we're baptized
[1:53:24] in water and Christian baptism that's
[1:53:28] the first part the next part is we're to
[1:53:31] receive the Holy Ghost but the Holy
[1:53:33] Ghost is not going to come upon us if we
[1:53:35] didn't thoroughly
[1:53:37] repent is that right Saints we read that
[1:53:40] for you it's very clear that we can um
[1:53:45] believe that God will uh uh fill those
[1:53:48] with the Holy Ghost that repent of their
[1:53:51] sins thoroughly repent and they're
[1:53:53] baptized and they receive the Holy Ghost
[1:53:56] now how many of you receive the Holy
[1:53:57] Ghost as soon as you were baptized a
[1:53:59] quick show of
[1:54:01] hands one hand couple hands there two
[1:54:05] yeah few hands it's
[1:54:07] beautiful my junior sister she had an
[1:54:10] experience of the Lord my youngest
[1:54:13] sister Kimberly um we had been going to
[1:54:16] church for years we bring her to church
[1:54:17] for the first time she really repented
[1:54:20] she came into the baptistry there she
[1:54:23] baptized her she came out of the water
[1:54:25] speaking in tongues the Holy Ghost just
[1:54:27] filled her so full I would have loved
[1:54:30] that to happen to me but then it take it
[1:54:31] took a minute for me it took more than a
[1:54:34] minute I should say it took a while and
[1:54:37] it takes a while for a lot of us is that
[1:54:39] right that's part of the experience it's
[1:54:42] not an indictment on our faith it's just
[1:54:45] we have to thoroughly repent sometimes
[1:54:47] we need more information in the word we
[1:54:49] need more you know you know Clarity of
[1:54:51] what's really going on and then you have
[1:54:53] that moment yeah your heart is right
[1:54:56] it's fully repented and then he fills
[1:54:58] you with the precious Holy Ghost that's
[1:55:02] for the church today we're not just
[1:55:05] coming to baptize people in water that's
[1:55:08] part of it but we want to see them
[1:55:10] filled with the Holy Ghost is that right
[1:55:14] Saints and he won't F an unclean vessel
[1:55:19] so sanctification by the blood
[1:55:22] as you be as you begin to thoroughly
[1:55:25] repent through the blood the blood is
[1:55:28] sanctifying you through the word of God
[1:55:32] the the word has blood on it it's
[1:55:35] judgment but forgiveness judgment but
[1:55:38] forgiveness judgment but forgi you're
[1:55:41] wrong but make it right you're wrong now
[1:55:43] get it right and that's what the word is
[1:55:46] and you get your heart right and then he
[1:55:49] fills you with the Holy Ghost and after
[1:55:50] you're filled with the Holy Ghost you
[1:55:52] don't stop your
[1:55:54] repenting it's a continual work right
[1:55:57] Saints Paul said I Die daily what I want
[1:56:01] to do the bad man wants to do wrong and
[1:56:05] the good man wants to do to to do good
[1:56:09] and I find this war in me great Apostle
[1:56:13] this war in me this sticky nature that
[1:56:16] when I would go do good evil is always
[1:56:19] present how many he knows what he's
[1:56:20] talking about being very transparent
[1:56:23] none of us are in here without a sticky
[1:56:25] nature none of us are in here where we
[1:56:28] didn't have to say Lord have mercy on me
[1:56:31] forgive me this morning not for what I
[1:56:34] did last week I'm talking about this
[1:56:35] morning forgive
[1:56:37] me for all of my
[1:56:40] sins make me that I can approach your
[1:56:43] throne of grace and mercy today amen can
[1:56:47] I take a few more
[1:56:50] moments yes so we all know this
[1:56:54] testimony of that little woman that um
[1:56:58] it's in the
[1:57:01] message
[1:57:05] 1953 that
[1:57:07] um she had an unconfessed sin in her
[1:57:11] life I want to play a portion of that
[1:57:13] what brother random said about it is
[1:57:15] that okay all right and that's in the
[1:57:18] message I think you got it back there
[1:57:19] sis it's about 7 minutes a portion of
[1:57:23] the tape just a little background she
[1:57:24] was a Sunday school teacher she was in
[1:57:27] or 30 or 32 years old the prophet of God
[1:57:31] said she
[1:57:33] um was so distraught in her mental that
[1:57:37] she was getting treatment every other
[1:57:39] week and taking medications to try to
[1:57:42] get over this trouble and problem and
[1:57:44] the pastor that invited brother Bram I
[1:57:47] think it was in New Albany I think he'll
[1:57:48] mention the church there invited him to
[1:57:50] come preach and when he went to go
[1:57:52] preach for them this little lady needed
[1:57:55] prayer she was a Sunday school teacher
[1:57:58] and so brother RNA prayed for her the
[1:58:01] pastor had already promised brother vam
[1:58:03] we're not going to have you praying for
[1:58:04] the people just come to preach to us
[1:58:06] when this lady come through he said I'm
[1:58:08] sorry brother brandom can you just pray
[1:58:10] for her so he prayed for this little
[1:58:11] lady and a few days later him and sister
[1:58:14] brandom see her walking down the street
[1:58:16] with another sister and she's just
[1:58:18] rolling her hands like this nervous as
[1:58:19] can be brother bam says I went up to her
[1:58:21] I asked her are things getting better
[1:58:24] she says no they're actually getting
[1:58:25] worse did you pray for
[1:58:28] me so he prayed for her again on the
[1:58:32] street
[1:58:33] there and then he said that this lady
[1:58:37] and sister brandham became friends and
[1:58:39] she told sister ma when that anointing
[1:58:42] is on brother brandham could you call me
[1:58:47] and have me come because I feel like if
[1:58:49] the anointing is on him he can find out
[1:58:51] what my problem problem is brother V
[1:58:54] Master did is there any unconfessed sin
[1:58:56] no everything is cleared up I'm a Sunday
[1:58:58] school teacher is there anything wrong
[1:58:59] no everything is clear and so he said
[1:59:02] one morning he was under the impact of a
[1:59:05] tremendous Vision he says in this tape
[1:59:08] go back and hear it
[1:59:09] yourself and after that that the angel
[1:59:13] had left but the anointing was still
[1:59:15] there sister brandham came to him and
[1:59:16] says honey is the Angel still near and
[1:59:19] he said yes so can I call that woman
[1:59:23] from New
[1:59:25] Albany she's got these kids and she
[1:59:27] really needs an answer so here brother
[1:59:29] Brams prayed for her twice gifted
[1:59:32] anointed didn't catch it couldn't see
[1:59:34] what was going on and here we are to
[1:59:37] this point where he finally gets her to
[1:59:40] come back to his home after the impact
[1:59:43] of a vision God's grace the anointing
[1:59:45] still on him and this is what unfolds
[1:59:48] this is in the message What's the title
[1:59:50] of that sis let me yeah do you now
[1:59:53] believe 1953 we'll play that paragraph

[2:00:03] that's now one had told her here it come
[2:00:05] again the vision broke and I seen it
[2:00:08] with a blonde headed man and she was
[2:00:11] riding fast in the car and a
[2:00:15] automobile was going and a train just
[2:00:18] barely missed him and she started
[2:00:21] screaming I could hear her but I I still
[2:00:24] in the vision and She fainted and fell
[2:00:26] in the floor and here was the vision she
[2:00:29] was gotten married just before the
[2:00:32] W and young girl and her husband went
[2:00:36] overseas and when he went overseas she
[2:00:39] started getting Lonesome and she started
[2:00:42] having company with a blond-headed

[2:00:48] her marriage bow and lived untrue to her
[2:00:51] husband
[2:00:52] on the road in the train almost stuck
[2:00:55] him and killed him and then when my wife

[2:04:40] ladies com and they went and met my wife
[2:04:43] said do you think they'll come back I
[2:04:45] said sure he'll be nice so it hadn't
[2:04:48] been a little while my wife said look
[2:04:50] coming up the steps here come with their
[2:04:52] arms around one another just a cry the
[2:04:55] tears running down their cheek open the
[2:04:57] door and I said what about it he said
[2:05:00] brother bam said my wife called me and
[2:05:03] got in the car and said she come
[2:05:05] confessing to me that a wrong that she
[2:05:07] had did and then said she come and
[2:05:09] accuse me of the same thing and I asked
[2:05:11] said where are you being and then and
[2:05:15] then said I is the truth brother Brandon
[2:05:18] said I don't know you I've heard of you
[2:05:20] my brother John and said I've never seen
[2:05:22] you but I want to shake your hand and
[2:05:24] say it's an absolutely truth and I'm
[2:05:28] guilty and no good to be called a father
[2:05:31] of my children or a deacon in that
[2:05:33] church and as soon as I can get brother
[2:05:35] Johnson I'll resign from my
[2:05:37] job I said don't do that just get right
[2:05:41] with God and continue with your job I
[2:05:44] said no need to doing that he said oh
[2:05:45] God would forgive me I said sure he
[2:05:47] forgive you have you confessed to your
[2:05:49] wife and asked her to forgive you you
[2:05:51] all forgive one another yes I said now
[2:05:53] sit down Now's the Time then when I went
[2:05:57] down and said Heavenly Father this demon
[2:06:00] has tormented this girl for all these
[2:06:02] years has no legal rights to hold her
[2:06:05] now the PA has done been found and made
[2:06:08] right now come out of her in the name of
[2:06:10] Jesus Christ and she's perfectly normal
[2:06:13] and well from that time on see see what
[2:06:16] is it it goes slow but we get the call
[2:06:22] see what it
[2:06:23] means
[2:06:26] Visions that's the reason some of you
[2:06:28] send me letters and say brother Roberts
[2:06:30] will pray for 500 while I'm praying for
[2:06:33] two God's brother Roberts is praying for
[2:06:36] people way God told him to do it I'm
[2:06:38] doing the way God told me to do so it's
[2:06:41] just slow but I I want to know what I'm
[2:06:43] doing and before I condemn a satanic
[2:06:48] spirit and so forth I want to know first
[2:06:52] whether that's in God's legal plan it is
[2:06:56] God as brother BOS says Jesus died for
[2:06:59] everyone that's right then if you're
[2:07:00] living in above that reproach and doing
[2:07:03] right then Satan has to turn loose of
[2:07:05] you but if there's anything back behind
[2:07:07] there maybe something that you ought to
[2:07:09] have done maybe you're living clean and
[2:07:10] pure but God told you something to do
[2:07:13] you need let you do it god holds that
[2:07:15] right on you until you go back and make
[2:07:17] that thing right again whether there
[2:07:19] something you should have done or should
[2:07:20] not have done
[2:07:22] you see what I
[2:07:25] mean amen how me thank God for his
[2:07:28] word now that's the word of the
[2:07:31] Lord um I can't go on and finish this
[2:07:34] message this morning wanted to get into
[2:07:37] the sublime part of the scripture but
[2:07:40] because of Revelations 5 it
[2:07:44] makes this happening all
[2:07:48] possible this lady was living with UNC
[2:07:51] confess
[2:07:52] sin but forgiveness was there for her
[2:07:57] but it was on her to confess it once she
[2:08:01] confessed it God forgave her and when
[2:08:05] God forgave her he healed her and not
[2:08:08] only healed her it brought out an
[2:08:11] unconfessed sin for this Deacon in a
[2:08:16] church and this Deacon was in a church
[2:08:18] as a deacon living with this unconfessed
[2:08:21] sin this Sunday school teacher is living
[2:08:24] in the same church with unconfessed sin
[2:08:26] and brother bam says no wonder why
[2:08:28] they're having so much problems in that
[2:08:30] church but look at what look what the
[2:08:33] confession will do he wants to resign
[2:08:36] his job as a deacon and brother ROM says
[2:08:39] don't do that just get right with
[2:08:43] God isn't that what we're isn't that
[2:08:45] what we're here isn't that what the
[2:08:48] believer is trying to do is trying to
[2:08:51] get right with God so that we can be
[2:08:55] approached or approach his throne of
[2:08:59] grace and mercy and Revelations chapter
[2:09:01] 5 makes this available to us I'll read
[2:09:07] one portion of the scripture on that and
[2:09:10] then I'll try to finish it tonight is
[2:09:12] that okay all right now in the message
[2:09:16] the most in the in the message the
[2:09:18] breach it's in paragraph let's see if I
[2:09:22] can find it here quickly paragraph
[2:09:34] 238 so we covered a lot of ground this
[2:09:37] morning I mean there's a lot of folks a
[2:09:39] lot of saints in here that's been
[2:09:40] baptized and they haven't received the
[2:09:42] Holy Ghost or they don't know whether
[2:09:44] they have or not I don't believe God
[2:09:46] wants us to live with a question mark
[2:09:48] over our faith like I think I received
[2:09:51] to that camp I think I might have no
[2:09:53] he'll give you the assurance that you
[2:09:56] have it so like the people in the Bible
[2:09:58] can say exactly what the Lord did for
[2:10:02] them I repented and yes I have received
[2:10:05] the Holy Ghost doesn't mean I'm sinless
[2:10:08] doesn't mean I won't ever make a mistake
[2:10:10] but this is what happened to me and that
[2:10:12] becomes your testimony we have so many
[2:10:14] question marks because you know we're
[2:10:16] raised in the truth of the word so there
[2:10:19] isn't that you know we was was in a
[2:10:21] false church and then we finally come to
[2:10:24] a new church and that was our starting
[2:10:25] point and then the newness of life and
[2:10:27] all those things to pinpoint many of us
[2:10:29] come up in our in our cradle knowing
[2:10:32] seeing a picture like that from the
[2:10:34] cradle up you've been hearing the truth
[2:10:36] all the time and it's hard to find those
[2:10:38] points and I'm not an expert on any of
[2:10:40] it I know God keeps his word though and
[2:10:43] if you repent of your sins and you get
[2:10:46] baptized in jesus' name the name of the
[2:10:48] Lord Jesus Christ he said You shall
[2:10:51] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and
[2:10:54] any true Ministry or any true church is
[2:10:57] going to point you to that you must be
[2:11:01] born again little ones big ones brown
[2:11:05] ones nice ones me you have to be born
[2:11:08] again every one of us and the Lord makes
[2:11:11] that known he leaves from glory to make
[2:11:14] that known to you aren't you glad about
[2:11:16] that let me read this quote here in
[2:11:19] paragraph number
[2:11:21] 238 prophet of God says this in the
[2:11:24] message to
[2:11:30] breach
[2:11:32] notice let
[2:11:36] see notice he's not an animal he took
[2:11:39] the book out of the right hand of him
[2:11:42] that sat upon the throne who was it the
[2:11:45] owner the original owner that had the
[2:11:49] book of redemption in his right can No
[2:11:52] Angel no Angelic being nothing else
[2:11:56] could take the place and this bloody
[2:11:58] lamb walked out and took the book out of
[2:12:02] his hand who what was it brother this is
[2:12:07] the most Sublime thing in the scripture
[2:12:11] amen an act that not an angel not
[2:12:15] nothing could do it and the lamb come
[2:12:18] and took it from the right hand of him
[2:12:20] that set upon the throne paragraph 234
[2:12:25] 243 just drop down a little oh who is
[2:12:29] waiting for me tonight he's asking who's
[2:12:32] waiting for me tonight who is that one
[2:12:36] church that's waiting there what else
[2:12:38] could wait there for you that kinsman
[2:12:42] redeemer oh my what a Sublime statement
[2:12:46] or act so Saints this
[2:12:51] this is I I if if our hearts aren't
[2:12:54] repented today we can't have a real
[2:12:57] church service we can't even be a real
[2:13:00] believer and that's the truth brother
[2:13:03] bam talks about a church that would
[2:13:06] thoroughly a church that's thoroughly
[2:13:09] repented and that would pray to God all
[2:13:12] the time he said they would have a
[2:13:18] Revival God couldn't keep it from
[2:13:20] happening I mean you couldn't keep it
[2:13:22] from happening let's take a few
[2:13:24] scriptures Romans 4 1-8 what shall we
[2:13:27] say then that Abraham our father as
[2:13:30] pertaining to the flesh ha found for
[2:13:32] Abraham If Abraham were justified by
[2:13:35] works he hath whereof to Glory but not
[2:13:38] before God for what sayith the scripture
[2:13:41] Abraham believed God and it was counted
[2:13:44] unto him for righteousness now him that
[2:13:47] worketh not now to him that worketh is a
[2:13:51] reward not reckoned of Grace but of debt
[2:13:54] but to him that worketh not but
[2:13:56] believeth on him that justifieth the
[2:13:58] ungodly his faith is counted for
[2:14:01] righteousness even as David also
[2:14:04] described the blessedness of the man
[2:14:07] unto whom God
[2:14:09] imputed God imputed righteousness
[2:14:12] without works saying blessed are they
[2:14:15] whose iniquities are forgiven and whose
[2:14:18] sins are covered bless blessed is the
[2:14:21] man to whom the Lord will not impute sin
[2:14:26] Hebrews 8:12 for if I will be merciful
[2:14:29] to their unrighteousness and their sins
[2:14:32] and their iniquities will I remember no
[2:14:35] more Hebrews 10 11-1 17 the scripture
[2:14:40] says verse 13 from henceforth expecting
[2:14:44] till his enemies be made his foot stol
[2:14:47] for by one offering he hath perfected
[2:14:49] forever them that are Sanctified whereof
[2:14:52] the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us
[2:14:56] for after that he said before this is
[2:14:59] the Covenant that I will make with them
[2:15:01] after those days sayeth the Lord I will
[2:15:03] put my laws into their hearts and in
[2:15:06] their minds will I write them and their
[2:15:08] sins and iniquities will I remember no
[2:15:12] more see this is what the blood brings
[2:15:15] us to we thank God for it don't
[2:15:18] you that
[2:15:21] that came to Jesus in Matthew chapter
[2:15:24] 9 and verse number
[2:15:28] one he entered into a ship he passed and
[2:15:31] came into his own City and behold there
[2:15:34] brought to him a man sick of the py
[2:15:36] laying on a bed and Jesus seeing their
[2:15:38] faith saith unto him that was sick of
[2:15:40] the py son be of good cheer thy sins be
[2:15:45] forgiven thee and behold certain of the
[2:15:47] scribes said within themselves this man
[2:15:50] blasphemed
[2:15:51] and Jesus knowing their thoughts said
[2:15:54] wherefore think ye evil in your hearts
[2:15:56] for wither is easier to say thy sins be
[2:16:00] forgiven thee or to say arise and walk
[2:16:04] but that you may know that the son of
[2:16:06] man have power on Earth to forgive sins
[2:16:09] then saith he to the sick of the py
[2:16:12] arise take up thy bed and go unto thy
[2:16:16] house so we know that forgiveness and
[2:16:19] sins Lays in him who took the book out
[2:16:24] of the right hand of him that sat upon
[2:16:26] the throne he came forth as the bleedy
[2:16:29] bloody lamb and he is the reason why we
[2:16:34] can find forgiveness today and not just
[2:16:38] today but for every day you need that
[2:16:41] forgiveness in your life we need it
[2:16:44] every day we thank God for it and his
[2:16:47] our sins and our iniquities he will
[2:16:50] remember no more it's Sublime Saints
[2:16:53] it's beautiful and we thank God for it
[2:16:56] so God bless you richly let us pray
[2:16:59] father we thank you for your word this
[2:17:01] morning we thank you Lord that we can
[2:17:04] Minister on the power of
[2:17:07] forgiveness and the power of the
[2:17:10] blood and Lord that we can not just come
[2:17:14] and ins spectate but Lord we can
[2:17:17] actually find
[2:17:19] Grace and Lord the sobering thoughts of
[2:17:24] being a
[2:17:25] sinner and then becoming a
[2:17:29] saint oh how tremendous that is a few
[2:17:34] moments maybe on the altar a confession
[2:17:38] that is made and you receive that and we
[2:17:41] leave from off of our knees The Sinner
[2:17:45] and now we've been made the
[2:17:47] righteousness of God it's it's hearing
[2:17:51] the word of faith and then responding to
[2:17:54] that word and we can find Grace it's so
[2:17:58] beautiful we everyone Lord have
[2:18:01] experienced that but Lord we see the
[2:18:03] danger of
[2:18:05] Christians and even deacons and teachers
[2:18:08] and preachers can fall into this
[2:18:11] trap of living a life of unconfessed
[2:18:15] sins and through the teaching of the
[2:18:17] message of the
[2:18:18] hour we can see Lord
[2:18:21] that we actually can sin against one
[2:18:25] another and we have to make that right
[2:18:27] with one another before we can be made
[2:18:30] right with you oh it's so Sublime though
[2:18:34] that if I'm still conscious today if I'm
[2:18:36] still breathing today there's still a
[2:18:39] chance for me to make all my wrongs
[2:18:42] right I can ask for forgiveness today
[2:18:46] and you are faithful and you're just to
[2:18:49] forgive any man
[2:18:51] any woman of any sin they've committed
[2:18:55] Lord there's nobody like you Lord you're
[2:18:59] worthy to be praised Lord we commit Our
[2:19:03] Lives to you father what would I do
[2:19:06] without you how can I preach without you
[2:19:10] how can we
[2:19:12] serve without you lord your grace and
[2:19:17] your mercy has made a way for us to come
[2:19:21] into your presence we see this
[2:19:24] tremendous happening in Revelations
[2:19:26] chapter 5 you opening the book of
[2:19:30] redemption and making a way for us to
[2:19:32] come back again Lord we're eternally
[2:19:35] grateful it'll never get old we'll never
[2:19:37] remove it out of our songs we'll never
[2:19:39] stop preaching about it Lord we're so
[2:19:41] glad about it we will always exalt you
[2:19:45] the lamb that took away the sins of many
[2:19:49] Lord if there be somebody here today
[2:19:52] that has been baptized but they have not
[2:19:55] received the Holy Ghost or they're not
[2:19:58] aware of the whether they have it or not
[2:20:01] they're kind of maybe sure and it needs
[2:20:05] they need a happening they need a tie
[2:20:07] poost Lord I pray that you'll reveal
[2:20:10] that to them today I know these uh
[2:20:14] little burdens and these little
[2:20:15] happenings are not for nothing Lord it
[2:20:19] was spoken for a purpose
[2:20:21] is it was spoken for somebody that's
[2:20:24] hearing it today and I pray Lord Jesus
[2:20:29] that you'll uh settle it down in their
[2:20:32] heart and in their faith and Lord and
[2:20:34] bring them to that place where they can
[2:20:36] receive the Holy Ghost not to just be
[2:20:38] baptized but to receive the Holy Ghost
[2:20:42] in their life repent and be baptized in
[2:20:47] the name of Jesus Christ and you shall
[2:20:51] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[2:20:54] This Promise is unto you and unto your
[2:20:58] children and unto them that are far off
[2:21:01] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[2:21:04] call and Lord as you're calling today
[2:21:08] may you call each one to repentance a
[2:21:11] thorough
[2:21:12] repentance and Lord that they would come
[2:21:15] in and receive the Holy Ghost that's
[2:21:18] what our church needs that's what we
[2:21:20] need Lord Lord that's what I need Lord
