[2:00] I saw unto the alt I saw under the altar
[2:03] The Souls of them that were slain for
[2:05] the word of God and for the testimony
[2:08] which they held and they cried with a
[2:11] loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy
[2:15] and true thust thou not judge and avenge
[2:18] our blood on them that dwell on the
[2:21] earth and white robes were given unto
[2:24] every one of them and it was said unto
[2:27] them that they should rest yet for a
[2:29] little Seas season until their fellow
[2:32] servants
[2:33] also and their Brethren that should be
[2:36] killed as they were should be
[2:40] finished let's sing only

[3:10] be
[3:12] only
[3:15] be all things are
[3:20] possible
[3:22] only
[3:25] be you may be seated brother Randa
[3:31] I just wish that some great Theologian
[3:33] explain to me how this world stands in
[3:39] arbit I wish you could scientifically
[3:41] throw me a ball in the air turning let
[3:44] it make the second revolution in the
[3:46] same place you couldn't do it and yet
[3:48] this is so perfectly timed till they can
[3:50] tell the eclipse of the Sun to the
[3:53] minute 20 years from now they a't got a
[3:55] a watch or a clock or any piece of
[3:57] Machinery that that's perfect and yet it
[4:00] stands there and then leaning backwards
[4:02] what if it straightened up a little
[4:06] bit you just make yourself silly see so
[4:10] you see don't try to get wisdom to
[4:14] understand just believe what he
[4:17] said The more simpler you can get then
[4:20] there you are you'll find it
[4:23] now I'm so thankful for that thankful
[4:27] that he is has made his simple
[4:30] now we find the sixth chapter and the
[4:32] ninth verse let me start now and when he
[4:36] had opened the fifth seal I saw under
[4:39] the altar The Souls of them that were
[4:41] slain for the word of God and for the
[4:43] testimony they
[4:45] H notice there is no mention of another
[4:50] Beast or a living living creature to
[4:56] this announcement of the fifth
[4:58] seal I remember there was on the fourth
[5:03] seal there was on the first seal second
[5:06] third and fourth but none
[5:10] here see if you notice let's just read
[5:13] back one of the seals let's go back to
[5:15] the four
[5:17] seal and that's the seventh verse and
[5:20] when he had opened the four seal I heard
[5:23] the voice of the fourth be Sav come
[5:27] SE when he open the third seat I heard
[5:30] the voice of the of the third Beast say
[5:33] come and see yeah of the second beast
[5:36] come and see and the first Beast they
[5:38] come and see but then when we get to the
[5:41] fifth seal there's no
[5:43] Beast I just noticed and when he had
[5:47] opened the fifth seal I saw under the
[5:50] altar right quick there's no there's no
[5:53] Beast there and a beast represents power
[5:56] we know that see there's no living
[5:59] creature now one of those creatures we
[6:02] find out in studying the the the
[6:04] Revelation in the churches that the one
[6:07] of them had uh was a
[6:11] line and the other one the other one was
[6:14] an
[6:15] ox and the other one was a
[6:18] man and the other one was an eagle we
[6:21] find out in the church ages that those
[6:24] four beasts meaning four powers was
[6:28] gathered around the acts of the Apostle
[6:32] just the way that the um the uh
[6:35] Tabernacle in the wilderness and you
[6:38] understand it because I won't take time
[6:39] going to it how we draw it out here and
[6:40] showed just exactly they were watching
[6:44] over this the lamb and the word to
[6:48] perform the word just as he did the the
[6:51] Ark of the Covenant in the Holy place in
[6:53] the wilderness and so forth now we even
[6:57] positionally show by the tri ible colors
[7:00] of Israel and by the uh how many heard
[7:04] the SE the seven Church ages I guess
[7:07] most half two-thirds of you notice that
[7:11] even the nature of the
[7:14] Beast was exactly a tribal
[7:18] emblem which way the four the 12 tribes
[7:21] set four on each side uh uh three tribes
[7:26] on each
[7:27] side and the four be set watch these
[7:31] tribes from all four ways and when we
[7:33] went got the gospels and show exactly
[7:35] when you enter into the ark there was a
[7:38] guarden the ark the
[7:40] Covenant and then we find out that the
[7:43] Covenant of the new
[7:45] church its representation on Earth was
[7:48] the Holy
[7:50] Spirit the blood had sent back to us the
[7:53] Holy
[7:55] Ghost and the four Feast represented as
[7:59] the the 12 tribes of Israel as it watch
[8:02] and finding their natures and taking
[8:03] that same nature and bringing it to each
[8:06] one of those four Gospels it exactly was
[8:08] exactly the say one talk to the lion the
[8:10] other the ox the other the four gospels
[8:13] there is the four gospels is the
[8:16] protection of the holy
[8:19] spirit
[8:22] amen I just always wonder it's stuck
[8:25] with me now this is about six years I
[8:27] guess since I heard heard a great man
[8:31] say that that was the The Acts of the
[8:33] Apostles is just the framework I've
[8:35] heard it said many times but to hear a
[8:37] man with his status as a preacher and as
[8:40] a teacher that's wrote some of the
[8:42] famous books that the people read
[8:43] everywhere and to say that the Acts of
[8:46] the Apostles wasn't actually suitable
[8:48] for teaching of the
[8:52] church when the Acts of the Apostles is
[8:54] the very Foundation
[8:57] of not the work the
[9:00] foundation because the Bible says that
[9:03] the the the the foundation of God is
[9:06] built upon the doctrine of the
[9:11] Apostles chist the the
[9:15] Cornerstone and when this fell stood
[9:17] there and made that remark I I just my
[9:21] heart just failed I thought no wonder
[9:24] well I see now in the seals it just
[9:27] wasn't revealed that's all you so there
[9:30] there there was stand there but
[9:31] something is saying
[9:34] that now notice they
[9:38] guard now when we got Matthew
[9:43] 28:19 and run that thing down through
[9:45] Matthew which represent the line and
[9:48] coming in there we found exactly why
[9:51] they baptized in the name of Jesus
[9:52] Christ and there he was standing there
[9:55] with that very scripture to guard the
[9:57] sacred Trust of the baptism of the name
[9:59] Jesus
[10:00] [Music]
[10:02] Christ well I'm getting off on the
[10:04] church ages now notice but here when we
[10:08] come to this fifth seal
[10:11] now there's there's there's no Rider
[10:14] Goes
[10:15] Forth and there's no Beast to announce
[10:20] it John just the lamb opened it and John
[10:23] saw it there was no one there to say now
[10:25] come look come see notice the old power
[10:29] of the living creature are there's and
[10:32] on the six seal there is no Beast to
[10:36] announce it on the seven seal there's no
[10:39] Beast to announce it no powers to
[10:41] announce it see no one doesn't on the
[10:46] look on the after the four
[10:51] seal there's no Announcement by any
[10:54] beast power from the fifth sixth or
[10:57] seventh seal
[10:59] not at all now notice I love this as in
[11:04] the times of the rider of the four
[11:07] horses the rider Singler of the four
[11:11] different horses there was a beast that
[11:15] announce the power every time the Riders
[11:18] straddle another horse and come forth to
[11:20] ride another kind of a Beast come out
[11:22] and announced
[11:25] it that's a great mystery
[11:30] that is the
[11:32] mystery
[11:33] why announcing the mystery why isn't
[11:36] there one here on the fifth seal to
[11:38] announce it here it is according to the
[11:41] Revelation that the Lord Jesus gave me
[11:44] today or this morning
[11:48] early that is that the mystery of the
[11:52] church ages are already finished at this
[11:55] time the mystery of the Antichrist is
[11:59] revealed at this time the Antichrist
[12:03] took his last
[12:04] ride and we found him on these Pale
[12:08] Horse mixed with these many colors and
[12:10] rides all the way into predition we get
[12:13] on the trumpets and so forth when to
[12:15] teach that I go to it now but we get
[12:17] Plum off the subject again and we we go
[12:20] he rides that's the reason there's no
[12:22] one there now we know written call some
[12:26] reason for something
[12:29] I remember at The First beginning I said
[12:31] they can't be nothing without a
[12:33] reason remember the little drop of
[12:36] ink now you got to find the reason for
[12:40] some reason they didn't have to have a
[12:42] beast or power to announce the seal
[12:45] being
[12:46] broke and Only God Can Ral why amen
[12:52] that's all because it's all all Lays in
[12:56] him but the reason that he Reve feels
[12:59] that I as I understand that it is
[13:02] because the mystery of the book of
[13:05] redemption as far as the Antichrist
[13:09] being revealed and at the same time the
[13:11] church is
[13:13] gone and these things don't even happen
[13:16] in the church age at
[13:17] [Music]
[13:19] all that's right there they're way in
[13:22] the church age the church absolutely is
[13:25] raptured at this time the church goes up
[13:28] in the fourth chapter of Revelations and
[13:31] does not return till it comes back with
[13:33] this King in the 19th Chapter but these
[13:38] seals here are revealing what has been
[13:41] what is and what will be see and now
[13:46] what was to be for the church age was
[13:50] revealed by uh the seals and now watch
[13:55] what takes it the the four stages of his
[14:00] writer has been revealed the four stages
[14:04] of the Antichrist writing has been
[14:09] revealed at this
[14:11] time therefore they don't have to have
[14:15] anymore and there was four living
[14:18] creatures of God to announce a rider as
[14:22] they
[14:23] wrote four beasts are four
[14:27] powers now now we know that Beast by
[14:32] interpretation of the terms of the Bible
[14:36] symbols means
[14:40] power now let's get that close the four
[14:44] are beast in the Bible represents a
[14:47] power among the
[14:50] people now if we find out like in Daniel
[14:54] when he saw a certain uh Nation rise up
[14:58] it it would be a maybe a bear holding a
[15:01] rib in his side symbol then he seen
[15:04] another Power raise up a goat it
[15:07] represented something and he seen
[15:09] another Power raise up and and it was a
[15:12] leopard with so many heads it represent
[15:15] a certain Kingdom then he saw another
[15:17] rise up a great line with teeth and and
[15:21] stomp the residue that represent a
[15:23] different Power all together one was a a
[15:27] kingdom of uh Nebuchadnezzar and another
[15:30] type of of a dream Daniel saw a vision
[15:33] Nebuchadnezzar Dreamed a Dream but
[15:36] Daniel interpret his dream and was
[15:38] correctly with the
[15:40] vision
[15:42] amen oh if you just know what happened
[15:45] what happened before we left
[15:47] here you understand while six straight
[15:51] dreams cut exactly with the
[15:53] vision amen a dream interpreted is a
[15:57] vision because a person not maybe being
[16:01] born but the subconscious to stay be
[16:04] awake when he sees it then God guts over
[16:06] this subconscious and speaks to him
[16:08] which he promised that in dreams in the
[16:10] last days he'd visit people and also in
[16:12] Visions see now a Visions when you're
[16:15] Wide Awake standing right like this and
[16:16] certain things are revealed you stand
[16:18] tell it just right about it see what
[16:20] happened and what's going to be and so
[16:21] forth but now A Dream is when you are
[16:23] asleeping your five senses are inactive
[16:26] and in your in your subconscious you're
[16:28] somewhere because when you come back you
[16:29] remember where you've been remembered
[16:31] all your
[16:32] life so it's your subconscious then an
[16:35] arsty is coners enough sh used to say
[16:38] you can't be something that you hate and
[16:40] that's just about right see and then if
[16:44] you're born to sear now you see to do
[16:47] that those both consciences has to be
[16:50] right together not one here with five
[16:53] senses active other not you're when
[16:55] you're sleeping the five senses are not
[16:57] active but you see when both of them
[17:00] you're born right together you don't go
[17:02] to sleep you just go from one to the
[17:03] other like like that you don't go to
[17:05] sleep there's not enough room to go to
[17:08] sleep and you can't make yourself that
[17:10] way so gifts and callings are
[17:13] predestinated of God they they are God's
[17:16] gifts and callings even without
[17:17] repentance the Bible says see they were
[17:20] ordained before the foundation of the
[17:22] world see now now we find out that the
[17:27] are beast of d Danel it meant that it
[17:30] was a power raising up amongst the
[17:32] people all right and and John's Visions
[17:36] here also showed that it was power as
[17:38] Nations raising up like the United
[17:41] States appears in Revelations 13 as a
[17:43] lamb and then U if you want to know a
[17:46] different you say well that's talk about
[17:48] National Power it also represents holy
[17:51] power too a beast did you know that
[17:55] notice Rebecca when uh when the the
[18:01] servant of uh Abraham elar when he came
[18:05] to get Bea Rebecca she he mounted her up
[18:09] on a camel the very camel she watered
[18:13] and she rode this camel to meet her
[18:17] unseen
[18:20] bridegroom the very thing she watered
[18:23] was a thing that tuck her to her future
[18:25] home and husband it's the same thing
[18:28] today
[18:29] see the very thing that the church is
[18:34] watering that is the seed the seed of
[18:37] the word it's the very word that becomes
[18:41] aivee and cares is to our unseen
[18:46] bridegroom see and look how perfectly uh
[18:49] Isaac had left the home and was out in
[18:52] the field away from his home when
[18:54] Rebecca saw him and the church meets
[18:58] Christ in the air and then he takes her
[19:01] back into the home father's home where
[19:03] the Mansions are prepared Isaac took
[19:05] Rebecca the same way and notice it was
[19:09] love at the first
[19:11] sight oh my she just run to meia that's
[19:15] way the church will meet Christ in the
[19:18] air and forever be with you now turn to
[19:21] the Bible these Beast are powers notice
[19:25] I want now I want you to
[19:27] notice the devil had his
[19:30] four uh changing colored Beast to go
[19:36] forth on he had his four Beast that was
[19:39] all three of them put into the color of
[19:42] one and made that one um a Pale Horse a
[19:47] white horse red horse black horse and we
[19:51] seen each one of those was a stage of
[19:55] his ministry
[19:59] a stage of the early church that had
[20:03] formed into a
[20:06] denomination at Nia the original
[20:09] Pentecostal Church Upon whom the Holy
[20:12] Ghost is poured out coming down took up
[20:16] an antichrist Spirit formed an
[20:20] organization gave birth to some
[20:23] Daughters of
[20:24] organization changed his power three
[20:27] times and and want and made a Pale Horse
[20:30] and then given a name called death and
[20:32] rode him into
[20:34] eternity just as plain as it can be no
[20:38] now notice he's given this this horse
[20:42] and he riding
[20:44] God God has also as every time I watch
[20:49] when the Antichrist appeared first what
[20:51] did he appear in White
[20:54] Horse innocence he could be just a
[20:56] doctor in the church wanted
[20:59] Fellowship your fellowship's with
[21:02] Christ but they wanted a fellowship they
[21:05] just couldn't stand it they want to get
[21:06] the well you know like little clicks
[21:09] will rise up in the church you you know
[21:10] you pastors they like to say birds of a
[21:14] feather but if we're born again Brethren
[21:17] that that's not the attitude to take no
[21:20] now we uh we we if we see something
[21:24] wrong in our Brethren let us just pray
[21:26] and keep it before God and love that man
[21:28] till we bring him right into the
[21:30] presence of God see that's way really
[21:32] the way to do it you know Jesus said
[21:34] there will be weeds in there because
[21:36] Jesus said it would be but don't pull
[21:37] him up you take the wheat with it just
[21:40] let him alone he'll do let him do this
[21:42] segregating when the time comes let it
[21:44] all grow together
[21:46] notice as the Beast went out uh the
[21:49] Antichrist went out on a beast his
[21:53] power oh I love this all this begin to
[21:57] feel religious right now see baby the
[22:00] stimulation notice and the Antichrist
[22:04] all them them Revelations and the
[22:07] presence of that ball of fire hanging
[22:10] there in a room oh
[22:12] brother although I've seen since a child
[22:15] every time it comes near me to alarms he
[22:18] almost put in unconscious
[22:21] condition you never get used to it you
[22:24] can't it's too
[22:26] sacred notice as the an Christ went for
[22:30] on his Beast of
[22:32] ministry there God sent forth a beast to
[22:36] combat
[22:39] it see I watch then every time the Beast
[22:43] rode on his horse the Antichrist rode on
[22:47] his horse on his Beast to announce his
[22:51] ministry God sent his Beast also his on
[22:55] that to announce his combat to it
[22:58] now the scripture says when the enemy
[23:00] comes in like a flood the spirit of God
[23:03] raises a standard against it and so when
[23:05] the enemy went out as an antichrist God
[23:09] sent a certain type of power out to need
[23:12] him and then when they he went out again
[23:15] as a red horse rider another color
[23:18] another Power another Ministry God sent
[23:20] another anry the combat at the holy
[23:23] church sent the third one again God sent
[23:27] his third be coming announc it he sent
[23:30] the fourth one God sent his fourth one
[23:33] and then the Antichrist end and the
[23:36] church ages ended too at that time watch
[23:39] now oh this is really good

[1:16:43] of you olders will remember this song it
[1:16:45] was popular back in the
[1:16:47] 50s but the words have been
[1:16:51] changed to fit the Christian experience
[1:16:56] amen and uh so you'll recognize it and
[1:17:00] uh hope I can get through it it's it's a
[1:17:02] beautiful
[1:17:05] song my
[1:17:08] life was like a
[1:17:11] ship an empty
[1:17:14] Crest with no
[1:17:18] assurance and my
[1:17:21] soul was bound for hell
[1:17:25] what love I'd
[1:17:26] known had no
[1:17:29] endurance and I had no Guiding
[1:17:34] Light i' never known a bright and clear
[1:17:40] day and
[1:17:42] this this
[1:17:45] emptiness yes this was
[1:17:49] my
[1:17:51] way and
[1:17:53] regrets I I've had a
[1:17:56] few my Joys were
[1:17:59] few and so
[1:18:02] evasive and the
[1:18:04] world with all its
[1:18:07] charms with open
[1:18:09] arms seem so
[1:18:13] persuasive and I had no peace of mind no
[1:18:20] happiness no True Deliverance
[1:18:23] [Music]
[1:18:26] and this this
[1:18:29] emptiness yes this was
[1:18:33] my way for what is this
[1:18:37] life what is it
[1:18:40] worth if all our
[1:18:43] Joys lay on this Earth a world that's
[1:18:48] filled with
[1:18:50] loneliness a world of hate and godly
[1:18:55] less to think all
[1:18:58] this this
[1:19:00] emptiness yes this was
[1:19:04] my way this is my favorite verse but
[1:19:08] then
[1:19:09] God he showed me his
[1:19:12] son his son who
[1:19:15] died on calvary's
[1:19:19] mountain and I
[1:19:21] saw the Crimson Tide flow from his side
[1:19:27] oh redeeming
[1:19:30] Fountain and I
[1:19:32] heard his voice cry out father it's done
[1:19:39] redemption's
[1:19:41] [Music]
[1:19:42] fished and God in
[1:19:47] tenderness said this is
[1:19:51] my
[1:19:53] way and and one day he'll
[1:19:56] come this risen
[1:19:59] Christ who gave
[1:20:02] himself a
[1:20:04] sacrifice and all the world will know
[1:20:08] his name and every tongue his praise
[1:20:13] shall
[1:20:14] bring and on that day I'm going to shout
[1:20:18] and
[1:20:19] sing I Did It Go God
[1:20:25] way for the record
[1:20:27] shows I took life's
[1:20:30] blows and I did it
[1:20:34] God's
[1:20:36] way now some of you are looking at me
[1:20:39] like what did he just think but God has
[1:20:42] a way and man has a way amen let's turn
[1:20:47] to Ezekiel the 36
[1:20:50] chapter Ezekiel 36 you may stand for the
[1:20:53] reading of God's word is Ezekiel
[1:21:01] 36 again I appreciate brother Israel for
[1:21:03] giving me the opportunity to share a few
[1:21:05] things this
[1:21:07] morning and I hope something I say
[1:21:09] touches your heart Ezekiel
[1:21:12] 36 and we'll start with verse
[1:21:16] 26 and
[1:21:20] 27 Ezekiel seen in the spirit here he
[1:21:23] says uh
[1:21:26] a new heart
[1:21:28] also will I give you and a new spirit
[1:21:31] will I put within
[1:21:32] you and I will take away the Stony
[1:21:36] heart out of you out of your flesh and
[1:21:39] will give you a heart of
[1:21:42] Flesh and I will put my spirit within
[1:21:45] you so notice he says I'm going to give
[1:21:46] you a new heart and a new spirit then on
[1:21:48] top of that I want to put my spirit
[1:21:49] within you
[1:21:51] hello and I want you to notice something
[1:21:53] particular
[1:21:55] seed cannot fall on a Stony
[1:21:59] heart that's why some people when you
[1:22:01] talk to them about the gospel of the
[1:22:03] message they got a Stony heart they
[1:22:04] can't receive it there has to be a heart
[1:22:08] transplant I will put my spirit within
[1:22:10] you and cause you to walk in my statutes
[1:22:12] and you shall keep my judgments and do
[1:22:14] them 2
[1:22:15] Corinthians 5:17 second Corinthians 5
[1:22:22] 17 very common scripture with the
[1:22:29] Saints 2 Corinthians
[1:22:34] 5:17 therefore everybody have it
[1:22:37] therefore If any man be in Christ he is
[1:22:39] a new creature or creation a
[1:22:42] regeneration you know you look at the
[1:22:44] Greek they say that's a in the Greek
[1:22:46] that's metamorphous from a caterpillar
[1:22:48] to a butterfly
[1:22:50] hello you know it's a marvelous thing
[1:22:52] that God has in his creation certain
[1:22:54] things depicting a new birth because
[1:22:57] that caterpillar is Earthbound but once
[1:22:59] it goes to that molten stage all of a
[1:23:01] sudden it can fly and the monarchs can
[1:23:04] fly from Canada all the way down to Mex
[1:23:06] Mexico you
[1:23:08] know regeneration old things are passed
[1:23:13] away behold all things have become new
[1:23:17] father just take these few words now in
[1:23:20] jesus' name and let them penetrate the
[1:23:23] heart of your people
[1:23:25] Lord help us to receive and Lord help me
[1:23:28] to just get out of the way and hide in
[1:23:30] the shadow of the Cross and Lord as I
[1:23:32] always ask Lord if you want to interrupt
[1:23:34] the service any time to touch someone
[1:23:37] Lord you are more than
[1:23:40] welcome to have
[1:23:43] preeminence you are more than welcome to
[1:23:46] touch that weary soul that needs a touch
[1:23:48] from
[1:23:50] you we've already felt your presence
[1:23:53] this morning I like that kind of
[1:23:56] atmosphere that that ought to be common
[1:23:58] in our
[1:23:59] churches I love that atmosphere
[1:24:03] Lord so Lord I just ask you right now to
[1:24:07] just take these words and use them for
[1:24:09] your glory in Jesus name and the Saints
[1:24:12] said amen you may be
[1:24:15] seated I want to take a thought this
[1:24:19] morning we're talking about a new heart
[1:24:22] a new spirit
[1:24:25] and
[1:24:27] uh I want to take a quote and I didn't
[1:24:30] bring it I don't have it but you'll all
[1:24:31] be familiar with it on questions and
[1:24:33] answers in the
[1:24:35] seals brother Brenham is talking about a
[1:24:37] man that he could take with the
[1:24:40] scriptures and he could twist
[1:24:42] him you
[1:24:44] know and and really you know he he could
[1:24:47] do something with this man because
[1:24:48] brother Braham had more knowledge than
[1:24:50] him and then all of a sudden he goes oh
[1:24:53] he didn't like that
[1:24:55] how many familiar with that quote he
[1:24:57] said he didn't like that he said I'm
[1:24:59] projecting myself in it and I'm not in
[1:25:02] the picture at all that's right he said
[1:25:06] he said now I could tell that man
[1:25:08] different but he said you you know when
[1:25:11] you've done something wrong because it's
[1:25:13] like
[1:25:14] tuning a fine
[1:25:17] instrument and that's what we want to
[1:25:18] talk about this morning throughout your
[1:25:20] Christian walk God is fine-tuning the
[1:25:23] inst strument hello remember the
[1:25:27] prophet's in the 50s he's going through
[1:25:28] the seals he's not an immature man he's
[1:25:31] a seas and preacher and Prophet but yet
[1:25:34] God's still fine-tuning it oh yes and we
[1:25:37] need to be sensitive sometimes in our
[1:25:39] life that God wants to fine-tune no
[1:25:41] matter what age you are in Christ he's
[1:25:43] going to fine-tune it because he wants
[1:25:45] usefulness productivity he wants
[1:25:48] something more than just a
[1:25:50] churchgoer you want something more than
[1:25:52] just War warm the pew
[1:25:54] how many love brother
[1:25:57] Joel hello but he does he wants
[1:26:01] productivity we're going to talk about
[1:26:02] that a little bit this morning so I'm
[1:26:03] gonna I'm G to deal with four
[1:26:06] issues this morning about fine-tuning
[1:26:09] the
[1:26:10] instrument okay the first
[1:26:13] one is something that I've asked a great
[1:26:17] portion of my life as a Christian I've
[1:26:19] asked Lord God please give me a heart
[1:26:22] that's tender
[1:26:25] give me a heart that's broken that's
[1:26:27] tender because I've noticed with the
[1:26:30] body of Christ and you see it out there
[1:26:32] in politics religion the educational
[1:26:34] system Hollywood you see it out there
[1:26:36] but in the church sometimes I've seen a
[1:26:39] hardness develop upon the people or the
[1:26:42] preacher that's good see if you do
[1:26:45] things mechanically I don't care if it's
[1:26:46] lead songs or preach if if you do things
[1:26:49] live out your and you do it mechanically
[1:26:51] after a while gets boring
[1:26:54] you'll get burnout because the joy of
[1:26:56] the Lord has creeped away from the body
[1:26:58] of Christ hello huh and you're doing
[1:27:01] things mechanically and then in the
[1:27:03] spirit and I just want to I just want to
[1:27:05] touch on something I'm gon to get off my
[1:27:06] notes for here for a second but you
[1:27:07] folks that are real spiritual and don't
[1:27:09] think you ought to have
[1:27:10] emotion hello or or it's not about
[1:27:14] feeling everybody listening to me let's
[1:27:17] go to the prophet on the platform and
[1:27:20] he's he's wanting to minister after he
[1:27:22] preaches but he's waiting on the Lord
[1:27:25] sometimes it takes a few minutes
[1:27:26] sometimes it takes 20 but BR brother
[1:27:29] brandom is waiting for a
[1:27:32] feeling hello because when that Pillar
[1:27:35] of Fire stands here and the angel stand
[1:27:37] I think it's on the the right side there
[1:27:39] is a
[1:27:40] feeling hello a feeling you cannot live
[1:27:45] a Christian walk without feelings or
[1:27:48] emotion the prophet said if you don't
[1:27:50] have emotion bury
[1:27:52] it hello
[1:27:57] hello either Buri it or resurrected or
[1:28:00] revive it do something because it ain't
[1:28:03] useful if you're just going through the
[1:28:06] mechanics
[1:28:09] hello so a tender
[1:28:12] heart a tender heart of Brokenness and
[1:28:16] this is why it's so important now let's
[1:28:18] turn to Mark I wasn't going to read this
[1:28:20] but I was in my motel looking at this
[1:28:22] last night and I don't know sometimes
[1:28:24] it's good to just read it so you see it
[1:28:27] but Hardness of Heart is a sin do you
[1:28:29] know that Hardness of Heart I used to
[1:28:34] work concrete years ago because before I
[1:28:36] realized this is not what I want to do
[1:28:38] all my
[1:28:39] life years ago so I changed to be a
[1:28:43] painter because but uh in in in Mark
[1:28:47] 6 just one scripture there Jesus is
[1:28:50] multiplying the Loaves and the fishes
[1:28:54] and it says in verse 52 I don't want to
[1:28:57] read the whole thing because you you
[1:28:58] understand the the the fish and the
[1:29:00] loaves of the multiplication and 7,000
[1:29:03] people is a lot of people and it always
[1:29:06] says the men you notice that Scholars
[1:29:08] thinks that there were women and
[1:29:10] children it's hard to get 7,000 men in
[1:29:12] the same place without women and
[1:29:13] children so it's a big
[1:29:16] crowd and he multiplies the fish and the
[1:29:18] Lo no notice what it says in verse
[1:29:22] 52 for they could considered not the
[1:29:25] Miracles of the low's for their heart
[1:29:26] was what hardened hardened hardened
[1:29:30] let's go to Mark 8 now a few months
[1:29:32] later could have been three or four
[1:29:33] months later he does the same thing
[1:29:35] again only there's 4,000 probably plus
[1:29:38] women and children now watch
[1:29:43] this same situation too they go across
[1:29:46] the
[1:29:47] lake and one of the disciples says
[1:29:50] Master we haven't taken any food with us
[1:29:52] we only have one loaf
[1:29:54] and so Jesus begins to question him how
[1:29:56] many how many baskets were taken up
[1:29:59] after I fed the seven how many basket
[1:30:01] and they told him and notice it what he
[1:30:03] says here in verse
[1:30:06] um verse 17 and when Jesus knew it he
[1:30:10] saith unto them Mark
[1:30:12] 8:17 why reason ye because you have no
[1:30:15] bread perceive ye not yet neither
[1:30:17] understand have you your heart yet
[1:30:20] hardened now here's what's important
[1:30:22] about what we're looking at right here
[1:30:24] here cuz it's twice in The Book of Mark
[1:30:26] twice when they saw those that
[1:30:28] manifestation of Miracles and
[1:30:30] everybody's belly
[1:30:32] fed
[1:30:35] hello do you realize as a son or
[1:30:38] daughter of God that you can miss a
[1:30:40] Divine moment because of the condition
[1:30:42] of your heart it's not
[1:30:45] fine-tuned hello and you can miss a
[1:30:49] Divine moment take a look at the
[1:30:51] prophet's life when he's on the platform
[1:30:54] and he goes out and there oh sister you
[1:30:56] you with the polka out a dress such and
[1:30:58] such and such about your life oh sister
[1:31:02] you should you should have responded you
[1:31:04] missed it and then he goes to somebody
[1:31:06] else that was a Divine moment I met
[1:31:09] someone here in t tucon years ago that
[1:31:12] had been in brother Brandon's meetings
[1:31:15] he was an older gentleman of course then
[1:31:17] but he said brother Joel I was in a
[1:31:18] meeting where God's Prophet called me
[1:31:20] out and I didn't respond and I missed it
[1:31:23] and he was still sick
[1:31:26] you can miss God by not
[1:31:28] responding hello you know when someone
[1:31:31] gets a breakthrough in the church we
[1:31:33] call it a breakthrough they get a little
[1:31:35] touch of heaven and they're screaming
[1:31:37] and shouting hello the rest of you
[1:31:40] should be enjoying that bow your head or
[1:31:42] lift your hand because when someone
[1:31:44] Rejoice we all Rejoice so we don't sit
[1:31:48] there and go what's the matter with her
[1:31:50] a fanatic dropped in I'm quoting the
[1:31:52] prophet on that um
[1:31:54] hello no you should all Rejoice because
[1:31:57] someone's getting a breakthrough see you
[1:32:00] don't know if that
[1:32:02] sister has been oppressed or depressed
[1:32:05] that week and she's at thoughts of
[1:32:07] suicide and she needs that and there's
[1:32:11] probably others that need it too but
[1:32:12] you're sitting there and you're
[1:32:13] mechanical and you're not in you're not
[1:32:15] in that Divine moment because the
[1:32:17] heart's not
[1:32:18] tuned we don't come to church just to
[1:32:21] stare at the ceiling or who's dressed
[1:32:23] and what we come we need a touch from
[1:32:26] heaven we need a touch in the Holy
[1:32:31] Ghost we need a touch from Heaven if
[1:32:35] there's one place we ought to feel God
[1:32:37] it's in this
[1:32:39] building
[1:32:43] hello this ought to be a place where
[1:32:45] people come in they they can feel God
[1:32:49] hello yes sir and what is a minister
[1:32:52] he's trying to or song leader they're
[1:32:54] trying to press through the
[1:32:56] veil because we come in with all that
[1:32:58] unbelief and doubt and a hardened heart
[1:33:01] or we have conditions and our hearts not
[1:33:03] tuned and we're trying to break through
[1:33:04] that Veil because we know if we break
[1:33:06] through that ve someone's gonna get a
[1:33:08] shout in the camp someone might get up
[1:33:10] and
[1:33:11] dance the problem said dance is a side
[1:33:13] of Victory hello did you did you know
[1:33:17] the prophet made a statement I'd like to
[1:33:19] see the church so drunk in the Holy
[1:33:20] Ghost they don't even know their own
[1:33:22] name
[1:33:24] hello huh I mean some of those old
[1:33:27] Saints used to get so drunk in the Holy
[1:33:29] Ghost they'd have to pick him up take
[1:33:30] him to the car and take him up they'd be
[1:33:31] drunk in the Holy Ghost for days sit
[1:33:33] speaking in tongues and you know
[1:33:36] hello
[1:33:39] amen there may be a few people brother
[1:33:41] Israel after the service you might have
[1:33:42] to give them smelling Sals or call the
[1:33:44] paramedics but you
[1:33:46] know
[1:33:50] hello this should be common amongst us
[1:33:53] huh we ain't a bunch of Baptists with a
[1:33:55] message of Presbyterians
[1:33:58] hello all right a tender heart now let's
[1:34:03] go to Mark 16 we always go to Mark 16
[1:34:05] and quote these signs shall follow them
[1:34:07] that believe but let's let's look at it
[1:34:09] from a different spec perspective this
[1:34:11] morning Mark 16 here we have these women
[1:34:14] they run to the Grave right and then
[1:34:17] they come back and say he's alive the
[1:34:18] tomb's empty he's alive and they didn't
[1:34:21] believe it right then two walk to the
[1:34:24] road EMAs that might have been quite a
[1:34:26] conversation because it's I think it's
[1:34:27] about six miles or more to Emmas and
[1:34:30] then they came back but on the road with
[1:34:32] Jesus and the Bible said he took on
[1:34:34] another
[1:34:35] form hello and and they they're walking
[1:34:38] with Jesus he's opening up Moses and the
[1:34:40] Psalms and the prophets and they're
[1:34:43] feeling this Burning inside they're
[1:34:45] feeling this anointing there's something
[1:34:48] different about this man where talking
[1:34:49] to us and then when they get there he
[1:34:52] disappears and they run
[1:34:54] back and they tell him we've seen the
[1:34:56] Lord he's risen he he talked to us they
[1:34:59] didn't believe
[1:35:00] it they didn't believe it watch what
[1:35:03] Jesus
[1:35:05] does verse 14 of Mark 16 afterward he
[1:35:08] appeared into the lean as they sat him
[1:35:10] meat and abided them he ided he scold
[1:35:14] them like like they were naughty
[1:35:16] children huh he abraded them because of
[1:35:19] their unbelief and their Hardness of
[1:35:22] Heart because they believed not them
[1:35:24] which had seen him after he was
[1:35:29] risen see that's not a fine tun
[1:35:32] heart because a fine-tuned heart if
[1:35:34] someone's telling you about an
[1:35:36] experience they had or something going
[1:35:37] on you'll go wow that's beautiful
[1:35:39] brother man I enjoyed that huh hello
[1:35:44] because you through your week you're
[1:35:45] fine-tuning that heart through the
[1:35:47] months and years you're fine- tuning
[1:35:49] that heart because you know I've often
[1:35:51] told people a a as you the closer you
[1:35:54] get to God and there's an intimacy there
[1:35:56] and you fine-tune that heart you can get
[1:35:58] in the presence of God in
[1:36:01] seconds did you hear
[1:36:03] me
[1:36:04] seconds but you have to learn the skill
[1:36:07] of
[1:36:09] condescending where the Prophet said you
[1:36:11] get little and God gets
[1:36:13] big hello and he said it's hard for a
[1:36:16] human being to do that we got all this
[1:36:19] self-importance you know just ask me
[1:36:27] hello I mean I met preachers dear God
[1:36:31] they're the most important thing on the
[1:36:32] planet just ask
[1:36:34] them I'm going to tell you something the
[1:36:36] prophet said God don't need you but you
[1:36:39] sure need him does that put in
[1:36:43] perspective because you see we're
[1:36:46] Irreplaceable I don't know if you know
[1:36:48] that you know but yet at the same time
[1:36:51] brother Israel if God trains you and
[1:36:53] equips you for years he doesn't want to
[1:36:55] lose that because you have a train in
[1:36:57] you that takes
[1:36:59] years so if you have a God has a plan
[1:37:02] for your life he might knock you upside
[1:37:04] the head put you in the hospital do a
[1:37:05] lot of things to get you
[1:37:08] humbled where he can use that vessel for
[1:37:10] his glory
[1:37:13] hello
[1:37:15] amen a tender heart this is why Hosea in
[1:37:19] the 10th chapter Hosea says he talks
[1:37:24] about breaking up the fow ground this is
[1:37:26] one of Charles finny's favorite M
[1:37:29] scriptures break up the fow ground
[1:37:31] because it's time to seek the Lord fow
[1:37:33] ground is ground that's been teed and B
[1:37:35] bore crops but it's Lin dormant for
[1:37:37] years it has pests bugs and
[1:37:41] weeds hello like the human heart gets
[1:37:45] amen oh I ain't got no
[1:37:48] weeds oh
[1:37:50] please hello I know Human Nature Jesus
[1:37:53] said he knew the hearts of
[1:37:55] men and we all need sometimes an altar
[1:37:59] service we all need a place where we can
[1:38:01] get alone with God and lay on our face
[1:38:04] and say God Empty Me forgive me cleanse
[1:38:09] me Wash Me In The
[1:38:11] Blood because I see too much of myself
[1:38:14] and not
[1:38:17] you break up the fow ground it's time to
[1:38:21] seek the Lord
[1:38:24] amen a tender heart a a tender broken
[1:38:27] heart God is well pleased
[1:38:30] hello let's
[1:38:32] continue you could take a service just
[1:38:34] on each one of these a pure heart
[1:38:36] another thing I've asked Lord over the
[1:38:38] years is Lord give me a pure
[1:38:42] heart I want a pure
[1:38:44] heart I want to be able to look at a
[1:38:47] congregation or or my wife or or or my
[1:38:50] family or whoever it might be that I got
[1:38:52] a clean heart a pure heart I ain't
[1:38:55] watching pornography over here at night
[1:38:57] and then trying to
[1:38:58] preach oh
[1:39:01] please
[1:39:03] hello you know I'm tell you something
[1:39:05] Hollywood has never been a friend of the
[1:39:08] church I don't know if you know that or
[1:39:11] not but it's
[1:39:12] true
[1:39:14] hello I mean someone that tells me they
[1:39:16] can watch R-rated movies X-rated movies
[1:39:19] watch all sorts of fleshly violent
[1:39:22] cussing stuff and then tell me I got the
[1:39:24] Holy Ghost no you
[1:39:26] don't because if you have the spirit of
[1:39:28] God in you there's no
[1:39:30] way with a pure heart you can watch
[1:39:32] that no way no way and look at this
[1:39:37] President
[1:39:38] Administration we have never seen such a
[1:39:41] flood of Filth and
[1:39:43] ungodliness and I'm going to tell you
[1:39:45] something as a Son of God with the
[1:39:47] spirit of God that's going to bother you
[1:39:51] if you've got God living inside of you
[1:39:53] yes you're going to be troubled of
[1:39:54] what's going on in this nation because
[1:39:56] you see it in the education Hollywood
[1:39:58] politics I mean Obama lit up the White
[1:40:01] House with a rainbow this man has these
[1:40:04] ungodly creatures that came out of the
[1:40:07] dark caves and he's pimping them in the
[1:40:10] White House
[1:40:11] lawn huh it's not
[1:40:14] normal Sodom and Gomorrah brought
[1:40:17] judgment on their heads because of
[1:40:21] that and you should as a son daughter of
[1:40:23] God be troubled what's going on in our
[1:40:26] nation and the things that are going on
[1:40:28] you should be troubled and it should put
[1:40:30] you on your knees once in a while my God
[1:40:33] give me a pure heart because the prophet
[1:40:36] made this statement on Feast of the
[1:40:38] trumpets in 64 he say those 200 million
[1:40:41] spirits that were released that drove
[1:40:43] the Jews back to their Homeland those
[1:40:46] Spirits have a influence on the church
[1:40:49] you ever read that huh that's why you
[1:40:53] see School CH shootings Church shootings
[1:40:56] you see all this violence across the
[1:40:58] land this
[1:41:00] anti-jew those are demon spirits that
[1:41:02] the demonic spirits you're seeing
[1:41:05] manifested hello I mean think about it
[1:41:08] just the news media loone which you know
[1:41:10] when when Jesus was taken up and Satan
[1:41:13] showed him all the kingdoms he saw the
[1:41:15] Republican Kingdom the Democrat Kingdom
[1:41:16] the Communist Kingdom the Socialist
[1:41:18] Kingdom he saw Hollywood he saw all
[1:41:21] these educational he saw everything and
[1:41:23] and Satan said if you remember it's all
[1:41:26] about bowing down and worship and
[1:41:28] control you ever notice that covid was
[1:41:31] about control and you can't
[1:41:35] worship
[1:41:36] huh hello it's always about control and
[1:41:41] worship huh watch it watch the
[1:41:45] history a pure heart the pure in
[1:41:49] heart they shall see and understand God
[1:41:53] well I just don't see what you're
[1:41:55] talking about in that message get a pure
[1:41:58] heart ask God to cleanse it deeper get
[1:42:01] some intimacy draw closer to Jesus hello
[1:42:05] get some intimacy with the Lord and all
[1:42:07] of a sudden the light bulbs will go off
[1:42:09] wow wow yeah I see it now Lord huh but
[1:42:13] God's not going to show you part of his
[1:42:14] kingdom if you got a filthy heart or a
[1:42:17] double
[1:42:18] heart huh your cry ought to be God give
[1:42:21] me a tender heart give me a pure heart
[1:42:24] God I got to have a pure
[1:42:27] heart because I've noticed this over the
[1:42:30] years and I'm I gave my heart to Jesus
[1:42:32] in 75 and came into this message in 77
[1:42:35] I've watched this over the years a
[1:42:37] sinner can walk through that door and
[1:42:39] sit in that Pew and discern what's in
[1:42:41] that preacher in the congregation don't
[1:42:42] even see it I watch that
[1:42:47] huh that's why we got to have a pure
[1:42:50] heart because sometimes people can read
[1:42:52] you like a
[1:42:53] book and you don't get it huh you know
[1:42:57] Sinners have discernment they're not
[1:43:00] stupid they do a pure
[1:43:03] heart this number three is to me not
[1:43:07] something I pray about it just comes
[1:43:09] natural all
[1:43:11] right I love a witnessing
[1:43:16] heart when I first gave my heart to
[1:43:19] Christ back in
[1:43:21] 19775 I was living my mom and a drunk
[1:43:23] boyfriend they they had their own thing
[1:43:25] going and it was during that time that
[1:43:27] God put a hunger in my heart I started

[1:43:32] John and I was a thief on the cross how
[1:43:35] many knows when you're a teenager
[1:43:37] sometime thank God if you're a teenager
[1:43:38] raising especially to love the
[1:43:41] Lord know amen there come on come
[1:43:45] on but you know when you're out there in
[1:43:47] the world and don't know Christ and
[1:43:49] haven't been raised in a message hello
[1:43:52] sometimes your but on

[1:44:02] sticks you know got too much CO's beer
[1:44:06] my my my weed got stuck you know it's
[1:44:09] stuck

[1:44:14] started you know uh getting away from
[1:44:17] the the the drug culture I I never did
[1:44:19] the heavy stuff but you know the weed
[1:44:21] and the hash that stupid stuff
[1:44:23] um I you know you know when you're
[1:44:25] smoking that marijuana you always think
[1:44:27] you got to hid in the safe place right
[1:44:30] you

[1:44:33] hiding but they can smell you smoking
[1:44:35] that marijuana across a block you
[1:44:39] know and so one of the last times I did
[1:44:41] that we had a little mouse in our shed
[1:44:43] where I hid my marijuana and he pooped
[1:44:46] and peed in the marijuana he just don't
[1:44:48] how many he knows unless you're really
[1:44:50] stoned you don't want to use that
[1:44:51] marijuana

[1:44:58] hello but God used a mouse
[1:45:02] hello he might use something in your
[1:45:04] life to get rid of junk hello be
[1:45:07] sensitive to
[1:45:13] it but you know when I gave my heart to
[1:45:15] Christ I had a supernatural dream after
[1:45:17] I was reading Matthew Mark Lu and in
[1:45:19] this dream the pillar of fire was
[1:45:21] chasing me now at the time I didn't
[1:45:24] realize that until I came with the
[1:45:25] message but the pillar of fire this ball
[1:45:27] it was chasing me and I was running in
[1:45:29] the dark and how many knows when you're
[1:45:31] running from the
[1:45:32] Lord the psalmist said if I run to the
[1:45:35] ends of the Earth you're there if I run
[1:45:37] to the deepest hell Lord you're there
[1:45:40] you can't run anywhere he's going to get
[1:45:42] you huh and so I remember giving my
[1:45:46] heart to Jesus and what did I do I
[1:45:49] turned around and went to all my friends
[1:45:50] that I used to smoke dope and drink with
[1:45:53] and I told him I got saved I had a
[1:45:56] supernatural experience and I gave my
[1:45:58] heart to Jesus now they may have looked
[1:46:00] at me like a deer in the headlights but
[1:46:02] I went to tell them huh why because it's
[1:46:05] a bread in a son or daughter of God you
[1:46:08] got to tell how it got lit you see we
[1:46:11] have a thing in the body of Christ where
[1:46:13] we have the speaker and The Spectators

[1:46:17] speaker and The Spectators now I'm going
[1:46:20] to tell you something if you're a
[1:46:22] spectator and you always absorb and
[1:46:24] never give out you got health issues
[1:46:27] spiritual health issues because your DNA
[1:46:31] is to give out what you
[1:46:33] absorb there's two lakes in the in
[1:46:36] Israel one's the Sea of Galilee and
[1:46:38] one's the Dead Sea water flows into the
[1:46:40] G Sea of Galilee and flows out that's a
[1:46:42] healthy Lake but in the Dead Sea water
[1:46:45] flows in but it never flows out that's
[1:46:48] the way some people are they can have
[1:46:51] water flowing in but never flows out and
[1:46:53] boy what they're critical about things
[1:46:55] that are going on man that preacher was
[1:46:56] too long he hello they can be critical
[1:47:01] but they never give

[1:48:04] it really is you got to share it when's
[1:48:08] the last time you know when I had a
[1:48:09] little storefront building up in in in
[1:48:12] in uh in Phoenix we got the married
[1:48:15] couples together and we went door to
[1:48:17] door knocking and invited people to
[1:48:19] church hello there's something we can do

[1:48:30] what I
[1:48:32] mean but you know you can do
[1:48:35] something you know they used to in this
[1:48:37] message PE preachers would put have
[1:48:40] radio broadcast and play brother's tapes
[1:48:41] they don't do that much
[1:48:43] anymore but there's something we can do
[1:48:46] sure because it's in our DNA amen it is
[1:48:49] we just love to share I mean think about
[1:48:51] this I've often said the church age book
[1:48:54] is one of the greatest documents in
[1:48:55] human
[1:48:56] history and this message is the greatest
[1:48:59] message on planet Earth that a people
[1:49:02] have ever had now that's not hype that's
[1:49:04] just truth that's not hype
[1:49:09] huh and so when I had my storefront
[1:49:11] building I'll tell you one testimony I
[1:49:13] have many but I'm watching that time but
[1:49:15] I have many testimonies there was a
[1:49:17] brother that I witnessed to and it it
[1:49:19] probably took three or four months
[1:49:20] brother George but he was a Hispanic
[1:49:23] brother real good spirit about him and I
[1:49:25] would give him a book here and a book
[1:49:27] there and finally something clicked the
[1:49:29] light bulb went on you all know what
[1:49:30] that's like the light bulb comes on and
[1:49:32] it's not a it's not a 25 watt it's

[1:49:42] hello I mean how many remember those
[1:49:45] well I I don't want to get ahead of so
[1:49:47] so his name was Brother Carlos and and

[1:49:53] he invited me I got an invitation to go
[1:49:55] to his United Pentecostal
[1:49:56] Church nice
[1:49:58] family and there was a woman Pastor how
[1:50:01] many knows when you're invited to a
[1:50:02] church and they got a woman Pastor you
[1:50:03] don't preach on women against women
[1:50:07] preachers huh the wisdom has totally
[1:50:09] gone out and the fine tuning is not
[1:50:12] there praise the Lord so I remember
[1:50:15] going there and and and preaching and
[1:50:17] the spirit of God just fell on that
[1:50:18] congregation they they were Pentecostal
[1:50:20] and they were dancing and shouting
[1:50:21] speaking Tong running around that
[1:50:23] building I don't know what I said but
[1:50:24] God was
[1:50:25] gracious well from that on brother Carl
[1:50:28] and his he had a wife and two kids that
[1:50:29] came over to the church start going now
[1:50:32] you know you may differ with me in this
[1:50:34] but if you just come to the message and
[1:50:36] start studying it and and and applying
[1:50:40] it it takes about a year to start seeing
[1:50:41] the what I call the big
[1:50:44] picture big picture yeah well he was in
[1:50:47] it probably four or six months he said
[1:50:49] brother Joel I want to go to LA I was
[1:50:53] raed raised on the streets of LA and he
[1:50:55] he he knew some of the gangs and he
[1:50:57] really didn't get too much involved in
[1:50:58] that but he said I I knew a lot of
[1:51:01] people there in LA and Pasadena he said
[1:51:04] I want to go over there and share the
[1:51:06] message I like to be around people like
[1:51:09] that so for two
[1:51:12] years we would go back and forth to La
[1:51:15] we'd take a Friday Saturday and Sunday
[1:51:18] we we'd preach Friday night Saturday
[1:51:19] night and Sunday morning we go back and
[1:51:21] forth I came down here brother Jerry
[1:51:23] amalon was so gracious he let me in his
[1:51:26] house and we get all the Spanish
[1:51:27] material we wanted and then we go to La
[1:51:30] have house meetings share the message
[1:51:34] hello and it was just a beautiful time
[1:51:36] and I had
[1:51:38] people you're going to
[1:51:41] La the prophet said that's under
[1:51:44] judgment that's why they need
[1:51:47] us hello you go where there's a need yes
[1:51:52] sir
[1:51:53] yes sir I wasn't intimidated by what the
[1:51:55] prophet said because I knew I'm a
[1:51:57] blessed man and not curse so ain't going
[1:51:59] to happen while I'm
[1:52:04] there so we would go we did that for two
[1:52:08] years and I I got an invitation to
[1:52:10] Assembly of God Church I like to preach
[1:52:12] in churches outside of the box I really
[1:52:14] do I got a lot of stories but we went to
[1:52:18] that little church and the song leader
[1:52:20] for some reason didn't like me it was a
[1:52:23] Hispanic church and I don't know you
[1:52:24] know the prophet said sometimes you
[1:52:26] carry a different spirit and people just
[1:52:29] hate you how many's ever had that happen
[1:52:32] oh yeah they hate
[1:52:34] you you
[1:52:36] know and he was leading songs and for
[1:52:39] some reason there was an attitude there
[1:52:40] and finally the the woman Pastor she
[1:52:42] said you need to get down let this
[1:52:44] brother up there and
[1:52:46] speak and that's what she he did you
[1:52:49] know what's
[1:52:51] interesting I've this over the years if
[1:52:53] you keep your spirit
[1:52:55] right I got up there and preached and I
[1:52:57] do not not know what I preached on but
[1:53:00] the Holy Ghost fell the man that didn't
[1:53:02] like me his daughter gave her heart to
[1:53:05] Jesus I love it I love it huh I'll be
[1:53:09] honest with you I love
[1:53:11] it can I tell One More Story along that
[1:53:14] line there was a black black Apostolic
[1:53:16] Church in Phoenix and I I was invited to
[1:53:19] the church by the assistant pastor
[1:53:22] and I got there and I was invited into
[1:53:24] the pastor's study they just come off
[1:53:26] their convention I think it was the last
[1:53:28] night and uh the pastor started asking
[1:53:31] me questions what do you
[1:53:35] believe I said well I believe in the
[1:53:37] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:53:39] Christ and the oness of the godhead and
[1:53:41] so forth he said where'd you get that
[1:53:45] very loving man I said well I I uh heard
[1:53:50] a Prophet by the name of William brandom
[1:53:51] and he had had some really beautiful
[1:53:53] things to share and he looks over his
[1:53:55] assistance and I can never forget this
[1:53:57] he go he's a
[1:53:59] bromite now you know I wasn't
[1:54:01] intimidated at all because I knew it was
[1:54:03] a
[1:54:04] test and what do you do with a test get
[1:54:07] up and walk out or sit there and go okay
[1:54:09] Lord you help me

[1:54:27] like the eagle something kind of
[1:54:28] inspirational all I know the Holy Ghost
[1:54:31] fell in that place brother Israel and
[1:54:32] they started dancing and shouting
[1:54:34] speaking tongues all over the
[1:54:35] building after the
[1:54:38] service the pastor invited me into a
[1:54:41] study now I sat there and he started
[1:54:44] confiding to me about the church his
[1:54:46] life and I sat there and thought wow
[1:54:50] wow when I was was here a about an hour
[1:54:54] or two ago he called me a
[1:54:56] bromite now there's
[1:54:59] respect it was because of the anointing
[1:55:02] you
[1:55:03] know sometimes men don't realize what
[1:55:06] they got in their
[1:55:07] midst but I respected him for respecting
[1:55:10] what took place you
[1:55:13] know so
[1:55:15] anyway I would
[1:55:17] uh go out to LA it was a beautiful time
[1:55:20] man the spirit of God would move in
[1:55:21] those little houses meaning we go from
[1:55:23] house to house to house there was a one
[1:55:25] brother he was his name was Brother
[1:55:26] Carlos he was married and had two
[1:55:28] teenage uh
[1:55:31] children and I don't believe in the
[1:55:33] spirit of exaggeration
[1:55:35] amen but I I I remember G him me and all
[1:55:39] the most of it was Spanish material I
[1:55:41] gave him a church age book he wasn't
[1:55:43] working because he had injured himself
[1:55:44] in a cooking job and I don't remember
[1:55:47] but he consumed the church age book
[1:55:50] between 24 hours and 48 hours cuz told
[1:55:52] you to do is read

[1:58:04] what do we say we want a visitation of
[1:58:07] the Holy Ghost and a habitation of God
[1:58:09] in our
[1:58:10] midst but this system of Revelation 17
[1:58:14] she was she had a habitation of devils
[1:58:17] and the hold of every what foul spirit
[1:58:19] and a cage of every unclean and hateful
[1:58:22] bird it was a
[1:58:24] cage what is a cage it's a place of
[1:58:29] containment yes so when you go to a zoo
[1:58:33] what do you see you see places of
[1:58:35] containment the rattlesnake and the
[1:58:37] tarantal in a little
[1:58:39] place as it and this creature gets
[1:58:42] bigger there in bigger cages but there's
[1:58:43] still a cage the birds the animals are
[1:58:47] in cages a lion he's a big cage huh and
[1:58:51] see this this is what we see in
[1:58:53] Revelation 17 this church and her
[1:58:56] daughters we see places of
[1:58:59] containment the Roman Catholic Church is
[1:59:01] a small
[1:59:03] cage and as you move further in
[1:59:06] Revelation the the Baptist might have a
[1:59:08] bigger cage in the Presbyterian
[1:59:11] hello but there's still a habitation of
[1:59:13] something that in the end time a prophet
[1:59:16] came along and he said when I preach the
[1:59:17] church ages I preached against the Deeds
[1:59:20] of the nicoles and all these things but
[1:59:22] when I went into the seals I saw the
[1:59:24] Spirit behind it remember
[1:59:28] that I saw the Spirit behind
[1:59:32] it politics and
[1:59:34] religion the church is
[1:59:36] political now you'll notice in
[1:59:40] Revelation go to Revelation 18:23 but
[1:59:43] you'll notice in those cages in those
[1:59:46] systems of Pol of political and religion

[1:59:53] I they have merchandise of Ivory and
[1:59:56] gold and silver and fine Linens hello
[2:00:00] and slaves and The Souls of
[2:00:04] men ever been in a system and thought
[2:00:06] you were just a
[2:00:08] pawn huh before you came to this
[2:00:12] message but notice this verse
[2:00:15] now go down on that
[2:00:17] verse and I want to read the last part
[2:00:20] of it for thy Merchant were great men of
[2:00:23] the earth and by thy sorceries were all
[2:00:27] nations deceived look at the word
[2:00:29] sorceries it means controlled by
[2:00:34] demons
[2:00:35] hello Paul said seducing spirits and
[2:00:39] doctrines of
[2:00:42] devils so when I present this message
[2:00:45] when someone in a cage no matter how big
[2:00:47] the cage is it's still a cage I have
[2:00:50] keys of Revelation
[2:00:52] and I've watched them
[2:00:55] work I've seen people give their heart
[2:00:57] to Christ when I talk to them in the
[2:00:58] spirit of God followed
[2:01:00] them I've I've shared this message with
[2:01:03] different ones and I I've seen the light
[2:01:05] bulbs go on and and and they walk out of

[2:04:09] okay how many still love brother
[2:04:14] Joel but I want to talk about a few
[2:04:18] minutes
[2:04:19] here on our reverence and respect
[2:04:21] respect toward the things the prophet
[2:04:23] has
[2:04:24] said I have noticed and I've been in
[2:04:26] this since 77 so that's well over 45
[2:04:29] years and I've noticed in the past few
[2:04:32] decades pulpits and
[2:04:34] people sometimes they show a great
[2:04:37] disrespect toward things brother brandom
[2:04:41] says and I want to tell you something
[2:04:44] and this is very important when brother
[2:04:46] brandham had the vision of the tent
[2:04:48] Vision or the white the dream of the
[2:04:50] white horse rider or or or he talks
[2:04:53] about the third pull or the seven
[2:04:55] thunders of the seven seal and all those
[2:04:58] controversial things
[2:05:01] hello are you with
[2:05:04] me people get an
[2:05:07] attitude that's good brother now now
[2:05:09] watch this watch this is very important
[2:05:11] do you remember when you first came in
[2:05:12] the message I do 77 huh do you know was
[2:05:16] it cost $4500 to get the complete
[2:05:19] library of the kets 40
[2:05:22] 500 that's a lot of money huh we never
[2:05:26] could afford that but we got all the key
[2:05:29] tapes you know the key
[2:05:31] messages in Billy Paul's dream back in
[2:05:34] 1960 brother B comes to him and and
[2:05:36] brother B says it's imperative that you
[2:05:38] hear these certain teachings so some are
[2:05:41] Evangelistic we love them but there's
[2:05:43] some key messages that are very
[2:05:45] important hello hello
[2:05:50] so so
[2:05:52] remember those old days when you had
[2:05:54] that old cassette and you turn it on the
[2:05:56] prophet would be
[2:05:58] speaking and you I mean you know you had
[2:06:01] a lot of wow moments when you first come
[2:06:02] in the
[2:06:03] message and and I remember what did he
[2:06:06] just say stop
[2:06:10] rewind stop and you'd hear it again
[2:06:12] because it's all
[2:06:14] new whether it's no eternal hell hello
[2:06:19] or some sometimes Jesus was talking and
[2:06:22] sometimes God was talking hello humanity
[2:06:26] and Divinity and and he' bring all these
[2:06:28] little
[2:06:29] nuggets and I call them the wow moments
[2:06:32] you know what what did he just say how
[2:06:36] many had some of those moments huh but
[2:06:40] you know as you go along you know you
[2:06:42] get used to the message you get more
[2:06:44] seasoned and mature
[2:06:47] hello and then you start sitting under
[2:06:50] preachers or hearing preachers
[2:06:52] and you got an
[2:06:55] attitude toward thus sayith the Lord
[2:06:58] toward a vision or a dream or something
[2:07:02] the prophet said you didn't get that
[2:07:05] attitude off those tapes you got them
[2:07:06] off some preacher that's
[2:07:10] [Music]
[2:07:12] right
[2:07:14] hello this is why I believe every son
[2:07:17] and daughter of God that loves this
[2:07:18] message once in a while needs to get
[2:07:21] alone with God lay on your face or take
[2:07:23] a walk and say Lord is there anything I
[2:07:25] believe or any attitude I have that's
[2:07:28] contrary to the
[2:07:30] scriptures because I'll give you a word
[2:07:32] this morning that you need to hear you
[2:07:35] if if you have a certain attitude
[2:07:38] towards something that Prophet
[2:07:40] said your attitude might have something
[2:07:42] to do with your
[2:07:46] destiny wooo
[2:07:51] I mean look at Abraham Abraham in the
[2:07:54] fourth chapter of Romans the Bible says
[2:07:57] honey you don't look to good you kind of
[2:07:59] have a dead body and she goes well
[2:08:00] sweetheart you got a dead body there
[2:08:03] too hello their body was as good
[2:08:07] as dead they knew it and yet God had
[2:08:12] promised a child what do you do with
[2:08:14] that the Bible says hope against hope
[2:08:18] Abraham believed the promise and it was
[2:08:21] in imputed unto him for
[2:08:26] righteousness that's right and when you
[2:08:29] see a prophet with a vision a dream uh
[2:08:32] thus sayith the Lord a teaching and you
[2:08:34] don't understand it that's okay if you
[2:08:37] came to me and say brother Joel what do
[2:08:38] you think about this or that I say I I
[2:08:40] don't know but I believe
[2:08:42] it because I as a son or daughter as I
[2:08:45] as a Son of God I want a deep reverence
[2:08:51] and respect toward that which is sacred
[2:08:55] and thus sayth the Lord I want a deep
[2:09:01] respect God didn't ask me if I
[2:09:06] understand it all but do I believe it
[2:09:07] then do I respect
[2:09:10] it because your destiny May ride on your
[2:09:17] attitude hello man there's some people
[2:09:20] that believe what I'm saying that's good
[2:09:21] brother amen It's Not So off- based is
[2:09:25] it huh I mean think about the Old and
[2:09:28] New Testament here's a book where all
[2:09:29] these men are dead and there's still
[2:09:30] promises and you don't understand some
[2:09:33] of them does it know the promise because
[2:09:35] they're dead
[2:09:37] no
[2:09:39] hello come on let's have a refresher
[2:09:41] court and respect and reverence
[2:09:45] amen
[2:09:48] amen is God good
[2:09:53] oh
[2:09:56] Lord if you'd come to the
[2:10:01] instruments fine tuning the heart fine
[2:10:03] tuning the heart a tender heart a heart
[2:10:06] that's pure a heart that knows how to
[2:10:09] open its mouth and share with others and
[2:10:13] you know I'll tell you something about
[2:10:14] let me you know there's so many things I
[2:10:16] could share but you know when you share
[2:10:18] something with someone else it's good
[2:10:21] sometimes times when you're
[2:10:25] rejected Jesus said if they do it to a
[2:10:27] green tree what are they going to do dry
[2:10:29] it's good to be
[2:10:30] rejected the prophet said you need to be
[2:10:33] around someone that differs with you
[2:10:34] because it help you
[2:10:37] dig I don't want to be around people
[2:10:39] that always agree with
[2:10:41] me hello
