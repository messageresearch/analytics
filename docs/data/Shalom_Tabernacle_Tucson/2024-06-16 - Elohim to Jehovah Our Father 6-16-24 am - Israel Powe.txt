Revelation 6 verse 9-1 and that'll be paragraph 3:15 to start through 386 let's all bow our heads and pray together Lord Jesus we're thankful for this morning Lord we're thankful for the blood that you shed for us Lord and we can come with boldness Lord for what you have done not any works of our own righteousness but thy grace through faith Lord that you have given us we thank you for that morning Lord I pray you'd bless everyone here Lord everyone that may be on the way Lord that you'd meet every need Lord that you bless the children Sunday School classes Lord and us as we lord hear the word of God pray father that you would just impart more of yourself to us that your presence be felt that everything that would be done here this morning be to your honor and glory Lord may it be anointed may it fall upon the congregation here Lord and in meser and wherever Lord the streaming would go we thank you for it in the name of Jesus Christ we ask it amen Revelation 6 verse 9 and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true thus thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled sing only believe only be [Music] only believe all things are possible only [Applause] believe only [Music] be only B all things things are possible only believe you may be seated brother Rena these two prophets are Moses Elijah according to their Works being repatterned again that that has always been their Ministry now notice just as they did that didn't change them remember NE these guys never die watch just that now don't confuse before we get away from this don't confuse Elijah fifth time ministry with his fourth time ministry I've been telling you the Gentile church is looking for Elijah right and here he is over with the Jew remember he can't come four that's that's en his number he has to be five the first time he come is Elijah himself next time he come he was elishah next time he come he was what John the Baptist the next time he comes is for the seventh angel and the fifth time he comes he's with Moses over yes sir don't confuse me five if you know your your numerals of the Bible five is a number of laboring Grace and that's what he's done now watch you look know word this was Jesus a labor of Grace j s u s l a b o r is that right labor for for love for you and if you get to him how you come by what f a i t h amen n l a b o r is that right labor is the number Grace all right to the Believers notice the first Elijah that was him the second Was Elijah the Third was John the Fourth was the seventh angels are the last Messenger to the church according to Malachi 4 and Revelations 10:7 now the fifth time he is a messenger to the Jews to the 144,000 to the Jews at the church is [Music] gone I just you a little funny see see look if some thinks I want you to get this now if some still thinks that Malachi 4 to restore the people is the same thing he's going to do down there to the Jews and think it's all the same let me straighten that out for you just a minute see it would be a little bit confusing because remember in Malachi 4 says return the faith of the fathers or the children back to the father see back to the father now let me show you the difference of the ministry if he comes to return the faith of the children back to the fathers he would deny Christ he go back to the law that right the fathers kept the law you get it notice when Elijah and when he come to fulfill his ministry in Malachi 4 see as Malachi 4 Elijah was by by himself but when he come to minister to the Jews of Revelations 11 he has Moses with him right so no confusion out of it get it when Elijah comes of Malachi 4 he's by himself Elijah will R not Elijah and Moses Elijah will arise but the same inspiration that said Elijah will come for the last part of the church age to restore the faith of the children back to the original faith of the fathers the apostolic faith which your suppor to go back and the Antichrist has got them all pulled out to restore back as all the rest of the scriptures is Blended together see he comes by himself see but when he comes to the church the Bible come to 144,000 the Bible plainly states that both he these two of them two and his first Ministry couldn't take the Jews and put them back to the law becom he because he comes preaching Christ to the 14 that Messiah that was cut off that's it so don't have it confused it's not confused the scripture don't lie Glory I said Thank You Lord I was watching it take place out there see that Elijah walk out there for that first day by himself and is by himself and when I see him come again way on over somewhere else there there two of them there that I see [Applause] now hallu mention a little confusing to somebody but he he told me to mention it so I did noce these men are kept Alive by God from their original Ministry for a future service they serve it so well see just think that Spirit of Elijah ministers five times hallu Moses two why keep alive for for further service they were neither one of them dead now don't you believe that they were both seen alive talking to Jesus on Mount Transfiguration but remember they must die now now Moses actually died but he rose because he's a perfect type of Christ see nobody ever know where he was buried the Angels come Telly he had Angel Paul Bears why no martal man could pack him where he was going he just went through an act that's allu Angel they took him where he was supposed to be no one knows even the Satan didn't even know dispute it with the Archangel he couldn't understand what happened to Moses I see him triming over there looking out over the land and looking back to the children and so forth I see him triming but he stepped up on the Rock and that was the last time I saw him that's a rock that's a rock let me stand on that rock to the end of my road yes sir my colored brother used to go up here and say a little song If I Could I surely would stand on that rock where Moses stood yes sir oh that's a rock I want to stand on too by faith I stand but remember Elijah he just got tired yeah well he had a lot of work ahead of [Music] him so he's pretty well wore out and God just send him a ride on right send a chariot is that right TCH him up never die because he kept him alive he had future work for him let him anoy a man to see come forth in his Spirit but they must taste death now Revelations 11th chap that's what I'm right here any let's hit it Revelations then watch and see if they're not both killed yes sir they both have taste death yes sir after their Ministries finish they taste that Revelations 11 and let's start at seven and where there have finished their testimony the Beast that ascended out of the Bottomless Pits makes war against them Oh my he can't stand them holy rollers are back again [Applause] see all right out of the bottomless pit makes war against them and shall overcome them and kill them that's right but Watch What Happens they're perfectly tied now and their dead bodies shall lie in the street in the street of that great City spiritually they called Sodom and Egypt where also our Lord was crucified Jerusalem see now they have to taste death don't they that's right after minister is finished why the seven angels Ministry the seventh Angel's Ministry Elijah's Ministry to the seven Angel not why don't why could not rather I'm trying to say the seventh Angel's Ministry than be by Moses if he's Immortal as same as it could be by Elijah why don't why God just send said Elijah you you don't work so hard everything all these different places I believe just send Moses down why look at Moses Ministry Elijah was a prophet to All Nations but Moses was a lawgiver to the Jews only amen Moses there say reason he come with Elijah them Jews saying wait we still keep keep the law here but here stands Moses himself here's Elijah standing with him think he comes to the Jews only see Moses only got to the Jews the Prophet Elijah was to All Nations but Moses become a prophet to the Jews and a lawgiver see that was his message the law but what was Elijah's message the Bob haired women denomination yes sir he really tore him to pieces painted up faces told go be fed to the dogs he just really tore into them and then when the spirit come up on Johnny ston got down of the Wilderness and done the same thing right so don't you think that we belong to this or that God's able to these stores righted Abraham walked up the road he said and you mean to tell me that you married your own brother-in-law it's not lawful for you to do it brother he told her sure notice these souls are to wait a little season for the 1404 to be martyred oh isn't that isn't that just puts a Bible together now my time's exactly up if I let out on early but I got just a few more little things to say you stand up I know it's hot and I'm sweating but listen I just got something to tell you it's just so good it's just burning right in my heart I hope you haven't forgotten see let me say this in the presence of him by his grace he also let me see my people not long ago and white rins you remember you remember the story not long ago the Gentile bride they're there now they're always in white robes to God I'd woke up I've been on a meeting it's been about a year ago a little more I woke up one morning and I raised up and I said sweetheart to my wife she didn't move the kids about have to get up and take him to school right up here the old place well I'm I raised up in a bed you lean you know how set up and just lean your head back against the headboard we got one the oldfashioned beds and um so I just lean back like that and I thought boy you already 53 if you're going to do anything for God you better get doing it CU you're going to be do too old AG while I thought you know that's right I boy you know I ain't very far away I got to go pretty soon I said that's that's a year older my daddy live I thought I got to move away pretty soon I thought here I ain't done nothing for God yet I I always wanted to do something for him I thought I got to hurry and do it if I'm going to do it and I don't know how I'm going to do it that's all oh man I hope I live to see him coming I don't want to be a spook a spirit I was always afraid of a spirit and I you know that kind of I always thought like if I meet brother Neville and he'd be a little white cloud moving around you I'd say hello brother Neville and he'd say hello brother Brandon but some other sense he couldn't talk but I just know that brother Neville I want to shake his hand like I always do because that's all I know is human being see I want to shake his hand but he ain't got no hand down there in the grave rotted away oh mind I hope I don't have to go through that I was I'm going to tell you the truth I I was afraid to die not afraid I'd be lost but I didn't want to be a spirit I want to remain a man I want to wait for the Rapture see I just want to stay like that I don't want to be no Spirit Lord I I was think of that and all at once there was something happened now you know and all of you're acquainted of the visions and if this was a vision I never had one like it and I've had them since as a little bitty boy and all at once something happened and I felt myself leaving uhoh and I I thought I've already di see I'm I'm going on see and I got to a place I thought I believe I look back it's just as real friends as I'm standing right here and I turned around to look back and there I was laying on the bed and I stretched down laying by the side of my wife I thought well it's probably a heart attack see I thought well see just Di instantly which should be a fine way of going so I thought that's a heart attack I didn't have to suffer I I thought well now that's strange there I lay right there and here I stand here so I turned it looked like a great big U like a great big uh feel like or something just great spreading field of blue grass and I said well I wonder what this is and all of a sudden as I look here come thousands times thousands of young women all in white robes hair hanging down to their waist barefooted and they were running right toward you I thought now what's this I turned around looked back there and there I was and looked up this way there they come I bit my finger I'm not asleep exactly but I can feel and I said well something here funny and these women all come running and I never seen such pretty women and they all around to me and when they run to me you know how I've been kind of they call me a woman hater but I'm not see but I just think a good woman is a one of the is a jewel but I think one that is no good is the pon says water in your blood so I certainly a got no use for for ill feigned women or smart at Le and so these women all come and started throwing their arm around now that's unusual know I wouldn't stand for that so and they were now I'm going to have to say this in a way that I'm a mixed craft but they were they were win they were women and they they hugg me each one and saw our precious breth and one would hug me and then the other one hug me I stand there looking I thought well what's this see I stand there and I thought what's happened I look back down there it wasn't night down there and here I was standing here I thought now that's all I don't understand that women holler oh our precious brother and hugging me now they was ever bit in feeling women now forgive me sisters as I said say this because but you listen to your doctor and if we ain't got clean Minds then we're not Christians I don't care I've always live clean God knows that a little boy the angel Lord told me to not defile my body smoke or drink and that's been Truth by the grace of God I've kept that when I was a sinner I just run around with women and so but any man that lets a woman hug up into his arms him being made up of cells of male and her of females there's a sensation I don't care who you are and I don't tell me you're not if you're a healthy person but not there because you don't have any more different cells you'll never sin there there was a change is no more than just a brotherly love to them women although in the grace that they look that I think a a woman a nice woman that holds herself right and Walks Like a Lady she's a she's an example of a jewel on earth like anything it's graceful I think a a woman that holds her place and tries to be a lady is a is a statue of Honor I do believe that and I think what it is it's just like the Christ and the Antichrist same thing I I like anything is smashed like a pretty horse and he just stands in his statue of a real pretty horse or anything like that a pretty Mountain pretty women pretty man anything that stands in the making of God I always admire it and these were perfect but no matter how much they would hug me up into their arms and they were women you understand but there could never be no sin the male glands and the female glands both was gone thank the Lord they were my sisters completely I looked and I began I looked at my hands I seen is all so young and I looked I was young too and uh and losing my hair as a Young Man uh putting carbolic acid on a barber didn't talk it all out when I was just a boy and it's been always a kind of a a thing to me that I I I get a cold so quick because my scalp's still soft you know and the roots of the hair is still there but it was burnt with carbonic acid and the hair can never grow see and I went my wife when I long years ago and got me a hair piece to wear a little piece of hair put on cover my head up but I was always shamed to wear it because it looked like it was something false I didn't want nothing false am and so I thought I'll just put me on a stocking cap then I did for a while you know what they did they want to call me Bishop and said I want to do I just said let her go so I just suffer out the bad cold and let but you just raason that wind is there anything that little air come right across like that boy I got it now went to a doctor and asked him what did he think he said well see your your pores are open you're sweating from preaching that air comes it it puts a cold germ up here in a mucus and runs down over your throat next one your horse that's it and um and so oh my you fellas has got hair you don't know how thankful you should be and that is right see and I I found out then I'm going to one of these days if if I don't get my teeth I'm going to have to have some of them and so or either do without them so if a fell if a fell I wouldn't think it'd be any more for a man if he wanted to to wear a hair piece and be for a woman wear one of these mouses or rats or what they put their like that to make it up see but uh but of course uh if you do it depends on what you're doing it for it depends on what you're doing it for and so but however standing there I felt up I had my hair again my I was young and these all these young I thought well isn't this strange here they are and there all right and I look coming and I I seen hope coming she you know she died at 22 she's still just as pretty as ever many of you remember dark eyes she German her black hair hanging down her back I thought now when she gets here she'll say she'll say Bill I know she will I know she'll say Bill when she gets here I was watching every one of these women come in hug me and say oh precious brother we're so glad to see you I thought everyone dressed this alike but they had their hair different you know red hair and black hair and blond hair and and uh there coming by but it's all young and when she got to me I thought I'm just go see what she said and she looked up at me and she said oh our

verse 14 and 15 and says for if we forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you isn't that so nice that you have a father that will forgive you amen we like to go into our scripture reading in Ephesians chapter 1 vers number 3-6 little message this morning to tie in from last Sunday the Lord the Lord will help us blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace you know his grace is so rich to us amen and this titled this morning's message that we'll uh Minister this morning if the Lord would help us Elohim to Jehovah Our Father Elohim to Jehovah Our Father brother bam uses that term Elohim it's not in your Bible as such but he takes that term Elohim and he says that he was the self-existing one this was before anything was created so Elohim to Jehova our father let us pray one more time lord Jesus we ask your blessing on this word this morning bless your people Lord just their spiritual appetite Lord let Let It Be oh God may you feed their souls in the spirit Lord through the word of God let us look past our first Earthly realm of this carnal Tabernacle and any caral thinking or thoughts move past that Lord and begin to minister to our souls Lord Jesus that's our prayer bless the Saints in Phoenix this morning in Mesa Brother Art and the Saints there the sacrifice that they have made Lord to gather in your name the visitors each one may they receive their portion we pray and we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated I greet the Saints and Mesa God bless them I don't they're kind of out of sight you don't see them but they see us and I thank the Lord for them and I pray God will bless them richly Amen in this uh little message here Elohim to Jehovah our father now brother VanDam he takes this message the adoption series how many remember that huh how many remember that we only got one service now we get this we'll get forward we get going then we'll close our good friend brother bons is back he leaves quietly he comes back quietly God bless you brother Bond do you have a good time how's mom's doing your wife okay good all right see your smile on your face so God bless him but from Elohim to Jehovah our father now brother Ram takes this adoption as I was thinking of Father's Day and I was thinking of Jesus having to go through these steps or stages of adoption and he was about his father's business and that's what we want to be today about our father's business and he takes the scripture in Ephesians chapter 1 and he places what that means in uh to be seated in Heavenly places now in adoption part one the prophet of God says this it's in paragraph number 100 and he says this here but in Genesis 2 pardon me we'll we'll get to that one here we'll take paragraph number 90 um 92 so he reads the scripture in Ephesians chapter 1 blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places oh let us stop just one more minute here in Heavenly places now just not out anywhere but in heavenly plac places we are assembled in Heavenly it means that the position of the believer now if I'm prayed up you're prayed up or the church has prayed up and we're ready for the message and we have assembled ourselves together as Saints called out baptized with the Holy Ghost filled with God's blessings called elected together in Heavenly places now we are heaven heavenlies in our souls our Spirits has been brought has brought us into a Heavenly atmosphere oh brother there you are a Heavenly atmosphere oh what could happen tonight what could happen tonight if we would be sitting here in Heavenly atmosphere and the Holy Spirit moving over our hearts that's been regenerated and becom a new creature in Christ Jesus all sins under the blood in perfect worship with our hands up to God and our hearts lifted setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus worshiping together in Heavenly places did you ever said in one oh I've said in it till I we weep for joy and say God never let me leave here just Heavenly places blessing us with what Divine Healing for knowledge Revelation Vision Powers tongues interpretation wisdom knowledge all the Heavenly blesses blessings and joy unspeakable and full of Glory every heart filled with the spirit walking together setting together in Heavenly places not one evil thought Among Us not one cigarette smoke not one short dress not one this that or the other not one evil thought nobody got anything against one another everybody's speaking in love and Harmony everybody with one Accord in one place then suddenly there came from Heaven a sound like a rushing Mighty Wind there you are he blessed us with all spiritual blessing how many's ever been in those places where you say Lord don't let me leave from here Lord fill my cup one more time lord anoint me one more time give me another freshing of the Holy Ghost give me another Revelation Lord those heavenly places you know when you're in those heavenly places you don't have time to criticize you don't have time to be upset you're in Heavenly places there's healing there there's love there there's forgiveness there in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus sitting there in Heavenly places amen so we've been talking about the powers of God and how we receive more power and more blessings and how these Powers they are actually unlimited to the believer they're unlimited now we've been in places where we're constantly looking looking on how long we going to be here or I'm ready to leave and our thoughts are going but a Heavenly place you don't want to leave that when the anointing comes down somebody tell me who wants to leave from that this is the goal of our service this is the goal of our praise and our worship this is a purpose of Our Lives I actually live for the Holy Ghost to come upon me I live for those moments I need them in my life I need him in my Ministry I need him as a father I need him to be a witness I need the Holy Ghost to come upon me and anoint my spirit with the right kind of thoughts the right kind of an attitude the right kind it's the blessing of the Lord its Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and so the prophet of God goes a little bit further in this message in paragraph 100 100 he goes further paragraph 96 blessed us together in all Heavenly blessings in Heavenly places Watch according as he has chosen Us in him did we choose him or he chose us he us when the night we accepted him chosen according he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world Amen he chose us when did he choose you that's got the Holy Ghost when did he choose you before the foundation of the world the foundation of the world so brother ad goes in paragraph 100 and it says this here in Genesis 2 he made a man he said I am y a h u ju u v u h JV hu Jehovah what did it mean I am the all existent one who has created something off of myself to be a son of mine or a temporary or amateur a little one of mine Glory why he gave men Jehovah means that he gave men to be an amateur God because he is Father um he's father God and he made a man an amateur God so he isn't self-existent anymore he exists with his family l l Elohim now he is Jehovah Jehovah means the one who exists with his family now God made man to be the predominant over the all the Earth he had dominion and his domain he was God over the Earth he could speak it would be so he could speak this it would be so there he is god Jehovah the one who existed in self-existence but now exist with his family and his little ones with him there you are so we know that he's not self-existent anymore he was by himself in Elohim but in him we he had thoughts he had attributes and these attributes were in him and now he had to express that out and in the expression he becomes Jehovah I had a wedding to do here on Friday up in Camp verie my wife and I went there Thursday and Friday we had a little bit running and traveling to do to marry the the young lady sister Grace and Phillip Dalton got married and I was talking with them before the marriage and as I've done many times and talking to this young man this young lady they're beautiful couple and I I told them this that you know as a young man your mother and father they know your friends brother cousins they all know you as Phillip same thing with you Grace they know you as an individual none none of us know you as husband and wife that attribute comes out through this Ceremony this ceremony pulls another attribute out that your parents don't even know you like that because it takes this marriage in order for you to be a husband a lot of men but many of them are not married so they can't be a husband and this is the same example with God and the same thing with when you have a child you can read books on rearing children or being a mother and you can read books on how to treat a child and so forth but you don't really know what it is to be a mother until you have your own even if you adopt one that's you know you H that's having your own and you take that son as yours or that child as yours it's the same feeling as as you having one so and those attributes are expressed after this great happening when he had you in his mind and he brings forth children now he goes from Elohim the self-existent one to Jehovah which is now a father this is this is somebody that exists with his family he's Jehovah so he goes from Elohim to Jehovah and that makes him our father let's take a scripture in first in St John chap 1 and verse number 12 quickly he verse 11 he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he what power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name so he gives you the power to become a son or daughter of God and that's the fatherhood that's our heavenly father expressing and birthing you into the kingdom and now you have the power from the father remember acts 1 and8 you shall receive power after what after that the Holy Ghost not after you get your degree not after you stay in so many months but after the Holy Ghost has come upon you you shall receive power how many of our churches need that how many of our Ministries need that they need the power of God and when the Holy Ghost comes upon you you shall receive this power and he gives you the power to be Sons and Daughters of God I love how brother brandham deals with this these attributes and the dimensions that we work and live in he opens it up to us doesn't he First Dimension second third and fourth in 2017 or 2016 I was going through the message I know brother Ben likes these things he was sharing a message tell me something on I didn't get to look at that rather being on these Dimensions but I started to look at my iPad I I went through back in 17 and I got up to 1957 on these dimensions and this are some powerful things that brother banam says that I want to read to you today about these dimensions and how healing works and how our thoughts we come in here and many times we think of you know the apostles pastors teachers and evangelists being placed into the body of Christ Ephesians 1 five-fold Ministry and we talk about the adoption finding our place right our placing to be a preacher our placing to be a farmer he says our placing as a housewife these are places that God places us but then let's go a little bit further into that let's go a little bit deeper than just your natural placing because he can place me as a minister or a pastor but yet I'm still immature in my ways and I don't have the maturity and I'm not growing properly I know my position but I'm yet not fruitful like I should be and this is the part it's not just now we found our place as Christians brother bonsa we find our place as Believers in the word now take that a little bit deeper that your inner man down in your soul can be placed properly where your thoughts are right your mind said is correct the way you approach and handle the message and handle the Bible is directly in order so it's not just becoming a Christian that's not saying that lightly it's great to become a Christian but we're not just sitting on a Pew we have work to do and God is working with us and in us and so let's just touch on a few of these things and it'll open up our our understanding a little bit brother bam in the message at Thy word he says this here now honestly my dear brother or sister if you would just let I I if you if you would just enter into that other dimension now enter that realm just don't think about what how sick you are if you'll just move on up in here to God where you can touch him something's going to happen in a few minutes if you just get up there see and believe now have faith believe with all your hearts God is here to bring it to pass there's somebody right in in there keeps pulling on something right in that way I can't place where it's at but my attention just keeps pulling up into that that spear right up in there it's somebody praying there's so much between me I cannot I can't locate who you are have faith so here brother Bam's obviously in a meeting the Evangelistic meeting he's operating his gifts that the Lord is using him and while operating we've seen it done many times that someone else is now pulling on the gift they're not pulling on it outwardly saying Hey Brother BR I'm over here no but they're praying and as they're praying they're pulling on that gift and it's in another dimension he can hear it he can see it but church folks are chewing gum some are reading their Bible some waiting for their prayer card they just can't hear what's going on but it's still going on all the time let's go a little bit further in the message God testifying of his gifts paragraph number 30 he says my work is in the realm of spirits that's where I live a big part of my life is in another dimension that the world knows nothing about and I speak that in the name of the Lord they don't understand understand there's no need of trying to explain it no way to explain it brother manam continues on in the message testimony of Jesus Christ paragraphs 78 he says this here that's in another dimension that many people know little love but God lives in that place and only thing you have to do is not think about your senses how you feel just believe what he said for the scriptures can't be cannot be broken whatever things you desire When you pray believe you receive it present tense it will be given to you future tense mark 11:24 so you believe presently it will come to you later on it's on the road God's word Can't Fail he's got to keep his word you believe him right now you accept it right now it's on the road coming so here brother bam is now opening us up to a great understanding of what these dimensions are we didn't know these things before but he opens us up to it in Daniel chapter 3: 24 and5 he says this here in your Bible it says then Nebuchadnezzar the King was astonished and Rose up in haste and spake and said unto his counselors did not we cast three men Bound in the midst of the fire the answer and said to the who's in the fire with you you see the enemy they they just see you they think they don't like you but there's more with you that can ever be against you God is on your side he said I'll never leave you or forsake you he's with you even right now you might not see him you might not fill him but he's still with you he just he'll show up every now and then and he shows up in the fire and he answered and says lo I see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire they have no hurt and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God so brother random in the message what think you of Christ he says this in paragraph number 36 he says it's all settled amen let's move on up what think you of Christ then he got right up to the edge where they was to jump off into the fiery furnace and there it was about The Darkest Hour they ever seen coming up to this fiery furnace and just about time they got ready to step in let's turn our cameras this morning and look on up yonder in heaven break out of this dimension and look up yonder when things look so dreary here there's always something going on in another world that's right yes sir I can see him setting as a prince setting there his great garments hanging all around him so brother Madam says take our cameras we're looking at the fire we're looking at the you know the Hebrew boys let's take our cameras let look in another dimension for a moment when things are so dark and dreary here something else is going on in another dimension amen so we want to tap into that don't we yes we do in the message expectations paragraph number 12 he says this talking about music I've got one of your records I believe you and your wife singing Heaven I believe it's in a little cut record or somebody in your church one of your people I play it all the time when I get real Lonesome and want to hear some real good old Step Up Pentecostal music yes let me read that again when I get real Lonesome want to hear some real good old step up you don't want to step down brother bam no we want to step up Pentecostal music music I go and put that on we have to give the Pentecostal people credit for one good thing many of them there's one good thing is those real good oldfashioned songs it just takes you out somewhere in the fourth fifth sixth seventh and eighth Dimension somewhere where it is out where God lives how many you know that's what music does that's what happened yesterday that's what happened here this morning when you hear that good oldfashioned music that moves your spirit from down here and it moves you up into another dimension it's the blessing of God it's the power of God and we long for that more and more and more amen I'll take a couple more on this he says I believe Lincoln said one time you can you can fool part of the people part of the time but not all the people all the time and that's right and if you got love in your heart for the people they'll know it you might act indifferent or anything but still they'll know it they can feel it it's in another dimension as we call it that injects to these people a love that they know it and they'll believe it and that's when you can help the person when you believe it amen brother bam continues in the message at Thy word and he says this here so you just be reverent now if the anointing would strike me of course it puts me in another dimension to the scientists it's the other dimension to you Christians it's in the spirit and therefore you're not yourself how many want to get in the spirit what kind of spirit the Holy Spirit get out of your own spirit and what happened yesterday and all the things that's going to happen tomorrow and get into the spirit of his word the spirit of the worship the spirit of the Holy Holy Ghost coming upon your soul we have to get into that brother random continues in the message fellowship and he says this here we're sitting here in Heavenly places now the holy spirit is here Christ is here and the body that we receive when we go out of here we go into another dimension into a blessed place with the Lord Jesus and at the return of Christ in his physical body come back to the Earth he spiritually turned back picked up a brand new body that's going to live forever amen oh my people could get the idea right now of angels walking up and down those aisles of Christ the son of God moving around in the building oh my what a difference you're in his presence and when your spirit becomes so hard to the outside world just like a magnet or crystal in the radio when the when that Gadget in there becomes so charged and magnetized to the word setting out until it strikes it and makes a positive the radio coming through the air the words we can't hear them with our ears we they're we can pick it up but that crystal in the radio picks it up the television the same it becomes positive and when our intellectual faith comes down into the heart becomes so charged with the Unseen World that every word of God becomes a positive truth you see what I mean when God says it it echoes against it just like it does on that crystal in the radio makes it perfect God said the Lord that heals thee that settles it amen that makes it real I'll be with thee even in you to the end of the world that makes it real you go on that's the way it is where I'm T talking Divine Healing how many remember brother R talking about those Spirits calling out to one another any the other dimension Spirit of arthritis was calling out to another spirit and the people in the church can't hear it but a prophet made a receiver can contact that is that right um now let me ask you this you know I can turn the radio on here and it would pick up all the radio local radio stations and even the ones nationally that are connected to this radio program or the radio receiver and I can turn that on here and you all can hear what's going on now when I turn it off does it mean it stops out there no it's still going on but I just turned my radio off and some people come to church with their radios off they go in prayer with the radio off the Holy Spirit don't turn off and on it's always on and if you can get your mind right and get your attitude right and get your spirit right you can tap into the Holy Spirit and it will show you that you are child of God and you got the power in your life to live above the things of the worlden church can start before church starts yes it don't start when the song leader start singing it starts when you start believing his word open up that radio open up those channels and let the Holy Spirit come upon you yeah yes now brother banam we was talking about this scientis musk remember we were talking about him and we were sharing in the message where brother Adam talked about how that uh we went from the horse and buggy over to the automobile to the airplane and then we left the airplane and moved up into the astronaut age how many know that and he was talking about how science and the spirit world the spiritual the spiritual believers they kind of go together how scientists have learned to you know build and create and make us more aware of what electricity is and what power is and lasers and all kind of atomic Powers but that's going on in the spirit all the time already has been and God sent a Great and Mighty messenger in this day that exposed us now you can live in a horse and buggy if you want to and you can walk from here to Phoenix if you want to but I'm not walking the Phoenix I'm gonna get me a car or get somebody that got a car to take me there and now am I walking yeah am I traveling yeah you traveling but God has given us more than just walking there's a faster there's a better way of travel and that's this message this is the astronaut this is the the age where all things are possible not just after the seals before the seals there was a power of God that was in this ministry so power of God in the churches that followed power of God in the ministry of Jesus and if I'm contacted with that same Ministry I have the power of God in my life and these Powers they are unlimited Powers now brother banam now I have to bring this in can I take 15 more minutes all right one service thank you brother George thank you even a young man said I can go a little bit longer 45 Sean gave me 45 minutes brother Joe all right so paragraph number 39 I'mma take it too parag 39 in the message this is in the message um enticing Spirits I like the way brother brand BR brother brand brings this out the first a few uh uh paragraphs there he says now this morning we're going to talk about demons in spiritual form in the soul they're in the soul the same as they're in the body and we're bound to admit that we see them in people's body such as cancers and different diseases that's in the human body just recently even cancer has been declared to be a fourth dimension disease that's it's in another dimension sure it's demonology every disease is a fourth dimension disease the beginning of it now but now cancer in the body or cancer in the soul what about cancer in the church what about cancer in a family what about cancer in your thinking cancerous thoughts these demons they they come they show them themselves on the medical table in the body but what about in the soul how do they manifest themselves brother bandam is opening this up to us and and and we got to I believe we need to receive that amen he says now many times many people with good thoughts and good people try many times to rest upon some little theology they have or something they have been taught since a child and still find that down in their being down in their soul that they still have something that's not right you many are are here this morning no doubt wherever you find Christians gathered together you find people who has those Spirits in them that they it's undesirable they don't want them they say oh if I could just if I can only quit lying if I can only quit lusting if I can only quit this or that now that is devils and now they come in the form of religion many times being Sunday school is time of teaching so let's look into this drop down to paragraph number 44 and he says this here someone come the other day and said brother brandom do you think it's wrong to do a certain thing I said why do you questioning about see if there's a question in your mind do what to it leave it alone don't do it at all just stay with that when you start to do anything if it's a question whether it's right or wrong stay away from it don't go into it at all then you know you're right now all things ought to be considered prayerfully first seek you first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things will be added I am positive sure this morning catch this church catch this if men and women could only get into the position of where their soul their thinking their attitude will be perfect in the sight of God that would be one of the most powerful churches that ever existed we've been talking about power right remember we talked about power we built the foundation on the 11th commandment which is is love everything has to be based on love and then that'll bring you into the Holy Ghost which is the token is that right the Holy Ghost and the token you're entitled to it when you believe every word you're entitled to the token and so that builds up this Foundation of love and surrender and God's Great powers that he gives and here now not just placing the apostles pastors teachers evangelists and gifts he's now saying let's bring you in position in your soul in your thinking come to church that's great but now get your thinking right get your mind right get your soul right and if that can be put in this place I'll show you a powerful Church a church that got it right their Love Is Right their Doctrine is Right their attitude is right yes here what he says here positive sure this morning if men and women could only get into the position where their soul their thinking their attitude will be perfect in the sight of God that would be one of the most powerful churches that ever existed let me take another quote in the message humble thyself here what the prophet of God says here paragraph number 75 in the message humble thyself he says this here don't you love the Lord and God can only operate as we let him operate and there's so many wonderful things that I'm saying and you know people want power and really they don't know what power is they really know what what goes with it the way up is down always if you want Power see how humble you can get just get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourself before God and then you got more power than the man that runs all over the building makes a big loud of noise see because you've been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to Christ see to humble yourself before him that's really power you show me a church that's humble real humble not arrogancy we got plenty of that a church just a sweet Humble Church I'll show you a church that has the favor and power of God in it that's right that's the thing it takes humility humbling ourselves before God letting God just work through us don't have to make a lot of noise amen so most of us got that part right so let's move on to the next part of that two slices to that bread don't make a lot of noise what's the other slice there's two slices to the bread no matter how thin you slice it don't make a lot of noise but everywhere Jesus went come on somebody there was a noise somebody saying praise the Lord thank you Lord amen praise the Lord someone said to me in the message so let's let's let's go forward in this message I'm going to close right in this message here this in this humble thyself but this isn't enticing Spirits here brother bam continues and he says this here watch a few minutes on the physical I I trust this helps you I want you to catch this watch a few moments on the physical now we have many times after years we got we call a lie detector you could put it on your wrist and set it across their head and you can get in there and try your best to make a lie sound like the truth and it'll register negative every time because the human was not made to lie lying is deceitful hard thing evil thing I'd rather have a drunker with me any day than a liar see a liar in your body wasn't made to LY no matter how sinful you are you're still a fallen Son of God the most sinful person in the city today God didn't intend you to be sinful he wanted you to be a son or daughter of his you're made up in his own makeup but sin has caused you to do that and no matter how much you try to impersonate and try to make a lie seem right they got a scientific instrument that proves that it's wrong you can tell it with all innocence you want to but it's still register negative paragraph 47 it continues on therefore if a man or a woman could ever get their thoughts and their testimony and their lives so lined up with God Amen until the channel of the holy spirit will be perfectly one with God what would take place if the man and woman could ever get lined up where with freedom from their heart Faith from their innermost Amen brother banam continues on it's a really powerful message go and hear the rest of it it's powerful and so brother banam takes that and shares with us that these Powers the power of God his power is unlimited the power of Grace is unlimited forgiveness unlimited Love Unlimited Mercy unlimited doing good that's for you unlimited pure thinking it's unlimited you can get do as much as you want to that pure thinking helping your neighbor that's unlimited y'all want something to do y'all need a Ministry yes helping your neighbor witnessing there's a good one unlimited reading the word of God unlimited how about praying unlimited now these Powers the powers of God are unlimited brother bam deals with this and he's talking about um Einstein so he takes another scientist again and the message Christ is revealed in his own word and he says this here I'm going to bypass all of this here see that all that you could have said amen too but some of y'all closing up on me all right you could have said amen your body want to go but your soul really want me to keep reading your spirit needs to hear it your spirit is saying preach brother come on give us that word give us them quotes amen who shall I listen to your carnal body or your spirit oh my praise the Lord praise the Lord amen yes brother brandom goes deeper in the message Christ is revealed in his own word and he's talking about Einstein when but before he gets into that look how he sets this up in paragraph number 66 now notice there is not any error in the scripture Jesus the word of God perceived the thought that's in the heart the word of God is stronger sharper Hebrews 4:12 the word of God is sharper more powerful than a two-edged sword even a discerner of the thoughts intents of the Mind see goes way down into the mind and pulls out and discerns what is discern make known reveal out and that's what the word of God does today we see the Catholic church is the word of God the Baptist the Methodist the we say the Catholic church is the word of God the Baptist the Methodist the Pentecostal the Tabernacle that's wrong the word is the revelation God revealed by the word and we can get any continuity among Medics among scientists different ones if Einstein had only had the spiritual application as he had the physical application as he studied the laws of light and so forth he could have told us something when I heard his message on that great Center somewhere in the skies that ever contacted with that Center uh you could create Earth do anything and the power would be Unlimited did see he had seen that so here's a natural scientist that tapped into these things and he said if you could ever get in contact with the center you could create Earth and do anything and he said the power would be unlimited this is Einstein this is Einstein without the Seven Seals this is Einstein without the message of the hour word this is Einstein without proof that going beyond the curtain of time we have bodies over there that do not corrupt think about that church and him and his great wisdom his great science his mind of course he believed in God he didn't have the Revelation that we have but he got into the depth of it and he realize that that power is unlimited if you can get to it and here and brother bam immediately goes into the Rapture you see these little pockets going through the air they call saucers I think sister uh Carina saw a light out here the other night she said it was there it disappeared and it came back and appeared again someone else said they saw something like that and then you know Believers even Believers be like nah she didn't see nothing should these are quotes Saints it's in the word there that it really happens they're there and one glad morning between 6 and 9 between six and nine one of them will come down and capture away his bride praise the Lord not stories to somebody else this is the word of the Lord to the believer amen he says these Pockets going through the air they call saucer so forth they well we better leave that alone hear all these people come up missing you say don't hear from them they're standing there they're not there that's the way the Rapture is going to be one of them will drop right down and this terrestrial body will take on a Celestial body and there'll be High hair or bones left it'll be transformed in the moment of time dropping right out of space and taking home that we see all this going on now the Pentagon wondering about these lights Mystic lights everything they're seeing in the sky you seen they had one here in the paper at Jeff Jeffersonville this week a Mystic light they don't know what it is but listen little children it's going to pick you up who is he talking to it's just a story to somebody but he's talking to some body listen children they're going to come and pick you up one morning yes yes but you don't want to hear about that you want to go home and get you know some ham right you don't want to hear about that but one more is going to pick you up amen that's the way the Rapture is going to be what happened listen children it's going to pick you up one of these days see see don't worry remember Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom prophet of God continues on so let's how many can say praise the Lord thank the Lord for the word we've had a scientist come in our day a spiritual astronaut that went beyond Reverend Billy grah went beyond the Reverend Oral Roberts went beyond all the great tent Ministries God blessed him AA Allen all the beautiful wonderful Ministries but we have somebody who went further than that that orbited that went beyond the curtain of time and came back and you heard it in Sunday school this morning that he saw his people there gathered there Glory I'm so glad we got a home to go to he saw this place we have a spiritual ason to come in this day and he told us these things that the power of God is unlimited let me say this as the prophet said in the quote there that if you can get your soul your thinking and your attitude lined up then he goes further and says if you can get your thoughts your testimony and your life lined up now we have found our position because of the bridegroom call can you say Amen there is a shout what was the shout it was the message going forth calling out a bride we have found our position there aren't you glad about it how many so glad you're a part of this great message how you so glad you heard the voice you recognize the voice Amen brother brother Ben as your song says that voice guides me directs me we recognize our voice but now Lord Place my soul my thinking and my attitude right with the perfect plan and will of God I want us to think about that internalize that just a little bit further a little bit deeper how do we come to the house of the Lord what position do we find ourselves and I think if our mind is stabilized properly then we won't be so easily offended uhhuh we can serve better once these things our soul our thinking and our attitude is right if our attitude is right then it it sets us in position for whatever God has for you that day it's like I'm going You're Gonna Be crucified today if your attitude is right you're like a lamb I'm going to raise you up today you're like a lamb it's because but your attitude has to be right I'm going to close this out in one scripture in 1 Peter chapter 2 and this is how I'm been internalizing these thoughts of Lord I need more power in my life and I know that the power of God is unlimited I have two or three powerful quotes here and brother vom talks about it as you turn there say Lord Jesus I don't know what more to say I pray God shall I just have a little prayer father this is in the message perseverance he says that maybe there would be strangers here that we might see you're still the same yesterday today and forever keeping your word maybe there will be someone with faith enough to break through that barrier Yonder the sound barrier that sin barrier that unbelieving barrier barrier Yonder break through that to where all things are possible granted Lord we're told that when a plane passes a sound barrier it's Unlimited in speed and power God if we could just break through that power of unbelief Miracles and things and Promises of God are unlimited for all things are possible to him that believe it you know you know even if your church is in a spiritual church even if your group is in a spiritual group that doesn't have to hinder you it's unlimited to you what did James say on Wednesday you have not because you ask not and brother Ram says you ask not because what you believe not and then James says you ask ask and you don't receive because you ask a miss you ask wrongly so that you can receive it upon your own lust but Lord if there is no other preacher or minister or believer that can believe for the signs wonders Miracles the dead being raised the death ears to open if there is nobody like that Lord I'll be willing to be that I want to be that even if my church doesn't agree with it I want to walk into those Realms of the unlimited power that you pay for at Calvary I'm not waiting for somebody else to agree with me I'm not waiting for a team of Brothers to agree with me God's word already agrees and I want to agree with that word amen is that your prayer this morning amen this is the spirit of our father the Father of Lights is found in Hebrews oh my the Father of Lights yes that's what he is but we're going to read in uh uh uh um what I call First Peter right First Peter chapter 2 let's turn there quickly all right bless this wonderful name hey Sean do I have a paper on the printer there inside my office yeah right he's the father of spirits thank you that's the one that was on my printer thank you for John appreciate it 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 11 verse 25 I have it here in my Bible but I have another version here I read from three or four different versions King James version is my version of the Bible okay I use other versions I read from them I don't normally quote you and tell you which versions those are because I don't want you thinking I'm promoting one version or the other that's the way I study but I preach with the King James virgin everybody can say amen amen all right I use three or four different ones you want to know what they are no right there's several versions you can pull from it's the English language it's unlimited all right okay God bless you I got to tease you Father's Day Happy Father's Day 1 Peter chapter 2 and verse number 17 says honor all men love the Brotherhood fear God honor the king look at Verse 18 servants be subject to your Masters one version says slaves talking about slaves servants be subject to your masters with all fear not only to the good and the gentle but also to the forward for this is thankworthy if a man for conscience towards God endure grief suffering wrongfully for what glory is it if when you be buffeted for your faults you shall take it patiently but if when you do well and suffer for it yet take it patiently this is acceptable with God for even here unto were ye called I was called to that because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we should follow in his steps who did no sin neither was G found in his mouth and mouth who when he was reviled revow not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously who himself bear our sins and his own body on the tree that we being dead to sin should live unto righteousness by whose Stripes you were healed for ye were as sheep going astray but now are you returning to the shepherd and Bishop of your souls look at this verse 17 and you could just follow along in your in the King James traditional and look at verse 17 in another translation it says this show proper respect to everyone love the family of Believers fear God honor the emperor slaves in reverent fear of God submit yourself to your Masters not only to those who are good and considerate considerate but also to those who are harsh say no I'm going to quit my boss needs to respect me says you know you got to treat you got to submit to that for if it is commendable if someone Bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because they are conscious of God but how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it but if you suffer for doing good and you endure it this is commendable before God to this you were called because Christ suffered for you leaving you an example that you should follow in his steps did you know that we were called to people criticizing our good works musicians come please did you know that you were called to that that we were called like we're going with all of our heart brother brother Nathan with all of our heart we're going to do good all right our intentions are good every intention I woke up this morning I'm gonna do this I'm gonna call so and so I'm gonna go over here I'm gonna go do that and you go do that and then someone turns and criticizes you for it and it's not fair right yes it's not it's not just they didn't even ask they don't even know my motive they don't know my intentions but you were called to that you were called for people to criticize your goodd doing and your good deeds whenever you go to do anything good somebody's going to criticize you for it and please tell me that feels good it doesn't feel good it actually catches you off guard it's like you're reaching out to shake hands with somebody and they won't shake your hand and they leave you hanging it's embarrassing and when you go to do good and your motive and your intentions are to do good and someone speaks against you then you should say I was called to that because I'm following his footsteps wouldn't they criticize us brother Tim for the things that we should be criticized for for we don't like it but it's like well you got me but when we're criticized for things that I was actually just trying to help somebody I I did that because I was really my motive was trying to help and then they criticize you gotta be careful because your righteous indignation you want to come and you want to speak against him you want to put them on blast for them coming at you when you were really called today that's part of the ministry that's part of the calling is to be criticized for your wello so let me leave you with this here this morning our soul are thinking our attitude our thoughts Our Testimony our life you know God looks on your heart God looks at everyone's heart this morning and let me say this to you if you're young person or old person whoever you may be if if you are doing the best you can and you're absolutely doing the most honest best that you can in service to him did you know God sees that God Honors that he respects what's in your heart you're doing the best you can you're doing the absolute best yes you can and God is there to help you to do better and when you do wrong after you put your best foot forward then all you got to do is just correct it yes bring it back yes come back and get a do over and he'll give you that and he looks at your heart and so at the end of the day that's really all we have is our motives and our intentions in our heart and in our lives if I'm not doing something and my heart I know I'm not doing something right well I'm not I'm just lying to myself forget about everybody else and everybody else might think he's good or she's great but you're lying to yourself because you know deep in your heart it's like they ask the question is it wrong for me to do this why are you asking that question your conscience is telling you but when you go down on your knees and you say Lord Father in Heaven you're my father he said if I needed some bread you wouldn't give me a stone you're my heavenly father you were Jehovah and before that you were Elohim now you're my father I have need of more of your power in my life and my motive and my in my objective and my intentions is honest before God I think that's a great prayer I think that's a beautiful prayer I think that's the attitude I think that's the right thinking that every one of us should come to the house of the Lord with honesty the Integrity of Lord you know my heart you see my intentions my motives and my objectives and I'm not lying to myself I need you more in my life I need that Lord and this is where I'm failing you I need more of it please grant that to me and I believe he will grant that to me because I want my soul and my thinking and my attitude to be right before God he sees it anyways he sees it anyways so God bless you let the great Elohim who called You Who Came Jehovah Our Father come from that other realm and dimension and anoint you down in your spirit to be a true son and true daughter of God God bless you let us pray father we thank you for your word this morning we thank you for making a way for us to come in your presence oh God I pray and ask you as we think of receiving more power more love more grace more of your blessings in our life may you grant it father we love you we commit all things into your hands Lord take the little broken up message this morning place it in our souls make us a church a powerful church that's humble before your presence and that's the power that I want resting in my life is humility before God may you grant that father we pray we ask in Jesus name amen let's sing a

let's bow our heads and just meditate on that just a moment you keep playing that Softly As you you think on those those thing those three things the thoughts your testimony your life but brother Brandon brings that your soul your thinking your attitude can all be one be saying the same thing then that's where the power of God lies because he SE sees your soul he sees your thoughts he sees your attitude and and really that's where you want to shine it's not so much on the outside physical what everyone can see but what does God see what does God see well he sees what you're thinking he sees what your attitude is he can look down and your soul and if there's something down in there that's cancerous that's a evil thought that's not correct you know he knows all about it you just have to be honest with him and don't and don't lie to yourself he knows all about it he knows you don't want those things in your life he knows you want to be a True Believer today he has that life for you it's the power of the Holy Ghost coming upon you to take those things away to move you further you know you you need the Holy Ghost you're born again by the Holy Ghost but then when the Holy Ghost comes into your life he begins to take things out of you that's not pleasing to God little aggressions little things in your past your history even the your makeup your little complexes that you have the Holy Spirit is there to deal with all of that and that's what I that's the church I believe God is coming is rapturing it's getting in line that's what's coming in position your soul your thoughts
