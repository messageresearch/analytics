[1:53] I
[1:55] Lord
[1:58] I oh
[2:01] [Music]
[2:19] and while something ENT in Among Us is
[2:24] working its way through and U now we're
[2:27] going to try tonight by the gra of God
[2:30] to take this fourth
[2:33] seal and um see what the holy spirit
[2:36] will have to say to us in it now I'm
[2:39] going to read the uh Revelations the 6th
[2:42] chapter and beginning with the seventh
[2:46] verse seventh and eth is always two
[2:49] verses the first is the announcement and
[2:52] the second verse is what he saw and when
[2:55] he had opened the fourth seal I heard
[2:59] the voice of of the Force fourth Beast
[3:01] say come and see and I look and behold a
[3:05] Pale Horse and his name that set on
[3:10] him that
[3:12] set was was death and Hell Followed him
[3:16] and power was given unto them over the
[3:21] four parts of the earth to kill with the
[3:23] sword and with hunger and with death and
[3:26] with beast of the
[3:28] earth now
[3:31] Lord help us now to understand this it's
[3:35] a mystery now just a little preview to
[3:38] back up as we did the church ages these
[3:42] Riders and these breaking of these seals
[3:45] now so we just get it in our mind talk a
[3:48] little until we feel that it's
[3:50] appropriate time to speak
[3:54] now we have noticed now that the
[3:57] breaking of the seals it's the seal book
[4:00] of
[4:01] redemption and then the book is rolled
[4:04] up like a scroll like the old way was it
[4:07] wasn't a book of this type because this
[4:09] is just recently come in these kind of
[4:12] books in the last oh I guess 150 years
[4:15] or something 200 and then they' roll it
[4:17] up then leave the end Loose as I told
[4:20] you how it was done in scriptures were
[4:22] to find it and and Jeremiah and so forth
[4:25] then the next was rolled around there
[4:26] the end left loose and like that each
[4:29] one was a seal and it was a seven sealed
[4:33] book and it was um no
[4:37] one when they was is the seven seal book
[4:41] of redemption pardon me and then no one
[4:45] in heaven or in Earth or beneath the
[4:47] Earth was worthy to open it or even to
[4:50] look upon it and John wept because he
[4:54] could find no man because if that book
[4:58] was not taken out of the hand of the
[5:01] original owner where he had been lost by
[5:05] Adam and Eve and went back after they
[5:08] forfeited their rights of the word the
[5:13] promises their
[5:14] inheritance they remember they control
[5:17] the Earth he was a he was an amateur God
[5:21] for he was a Son of God and a son of God
[5:26] is a uh an amateur
[5:30] God now that ain't contrary to the
[5:33] scripture I know that sounds strange but
[5:35] Jesus said if you call them who the word
[5:38] of God came to and what does the word of
[5:40] God come to Prophet prophets if you call
[5:43] them who the word of God come to uh Gods
[5:47] how can you condemn me when I say I'm
[5:50] the Son of God see and um now they were
[5:53] gods and man if you become born in the
[5:57] family of your family name you are a son
[6:00] and part of your father and then then
[6:03] When sin came in we found out the man
[6:06] crossed the chasm and B up bulls and
[6:09] goats covered but did not remit until
[6:12] the real bleach came that could take the
[6:15] stain of sin and break it completely to
[6:17] places and send it back upon its
[6:20] original uh perverter that was Satan
[6:23] when it got back to Satan he waits his
[6:25] time of Eternal annihilation
[6:31] uh that shows What We believe We believe
[6:34] that he will
[6:36] absolutely be done completely away and
[6:40] annihilated I believe that sin will be
[6:43] broke up and when it's confessed upon
[6:46] the bases of the blood of Jesus Christ
[6:48] it's like dropping a drop of black ink
[6:51] and a bunch of Clorox bleach it just
[6:53] breaks it into the chemicals and sends
[6:56] it Plum back to where it come from and
[6:59] that's the way the blood of Jesus Christ
[7:01] does then that sets a man across the
[7:03] chasm again as a Son of God understand
[7:07] then he's then he becomes uh uh while
[7:10] even he the creative power of God is in
[7:13] him and at least whenever God can
[7:15] commanded to be done it'll be done and
[7:18] we get back that when the the Moses
[7:21] under the blood of bulls and when he met
[7:24] that light the pillar of fire in that
[7:27] burning bush and he stood down there on
[7:30] a commission God had give him and he was
[7:32] a prophet and when the word of the Lord
[7:34] came to him he spoke and even things
[7:38] created by the
[7:40] word and I F to do that under that the
[7:43] blood of bulls what about the blood of
[7:46] Jesus not covered but remitted all
[7:50] together you stand in the presence of
[7:52] God as a redeemed son now see the church
[7:57] is far beyond it standing
[8:00] of living and I think too many times
[8:02] we're pring instead of really coming out
[8:05] and facing the
[8:07] issue I got something I want to say and
[8:11] I I will at the time and I notice that
[8:15] there's something wrong somewhere in the
[8:18] churches and I think it's the
[8:19] denominational systems that's Twisted
[8:21] the people's minds and so forth until
[8:23] they don't know how to do it that's
[8:25] right but we're promised that it would
[8:27] be revealed amen
[8:30] now the Seven Seals that this book is
[8:33] sealed with and those Seven Seals now
[8:37] and then after these Seven Seals are
[8:39] completed we find in Revelations 10
[8:42] there was seven mysterious Thunders that
[8:46] John was commissioned to write but then
[8:48] forbidden to write those amen and at the
[8:51] time of those Thunders we find Christ or
[8:55] the angel come down with a rainbow and
[8:58] put his feet on on the land and sea and
[9:01] swore that time had run out at that time
[9:06] and then we V find out that in the
[9:09] revealing of the
[9:11] seals that uh the lamb had left his
[9:14] moral work as an intercessor and had
[9:17] come forth now to claim his rights amen
[9:22] all that he had Redeemed by his death
[9:27] and then no one could open the book no
[9:29] one understood it it was a book of
[9:31] redemption and God the Father Spirit had
[9:35] it in his hand because Christ was at the
[9:38] throne as a mediator the only mediator
[9:42] therefore there could be no saint no
[9:44] Mary no Joseph no nothing else on that
[9:48] altar because it was blood and only the
[9:51] blood of Jesus could make the atonement
[9:54] so nothing else could be standing as a
[9:57] mediator that's right there was nothing
[9:59] else so all this idea of interceding
[10:03] with Jude for politics and interceding
[10:05] with St Cecilia for something else
[10:07] that's nonsense that's not I don't say
[10:10] that people are not honest and sincere I
[10:12] don't say you're not sincere and you do
[10:14] if you do but you're wrong you're you're
[10:18] sincerely wrong and anything they say
[10:20] well this uh uh this Angel this is
[10:23] appeared to to St bonifer and said this
[10:26] that and the other and they should say
[10:27] this I don't doubt that a bit in my mind
[10:30] what somebody seen the vision I'm I
[10:33] don't doubt what Joseph Smith saw the
[10:34] vision but it wasn't according to the
[10:36] rest of the word so therefore to me it's
[10:39] wrong it has to come with the rest word
[10:42] that's the way the church ages and seals
[10:44] and all the rest of it I When anybody
[10:47] thinks that he has those seven Thunders
[10:49] if it don't compare with the rest of the
[10:50] word there's something wrong it's got to
[10:53] come thus sayth the Lord for this is the
[10:57] book am this is a re ation of Jesus
[11:00] Christ in his
[11:01] entirety now I believe then that the
[11:05] lamb came forth they didn't know John
[11:08] was weeping he couldn't find nobody in
[11:11] Heaven and Earth CA all is other side of
[11:14] the chasm see sin there's no man and an
[11:17] angel of course he'd be worthy but after
[11:20] all it had to be a Kinsman it had to be
[11:23] human being and there was no such a
[11:25] thing because every man had been born by
[11:28] sex had taken one Bor without
[11:31] it so God himself took that in the
[11:34] Virgin bur and becoming manual his blood
[11:39] was for the one that was worthy and when
[11:41] he crossed this Chasm himself and paid
[11:44] the price and Bridge way for the rest of
[11:47] us then he sat down to be mediator amen
[11:51] and he's been sitting there and the book
[11:52] is actually been closed all that time
[11:55] it's there but it's still in symbol they
[11:58] seen it John even saw it the
[12:01] announcement when the first come forth
[12:02] he said a white a horse went forth he
[12:06] had a ride on had a bow in his hand
[12:08] that's symbol that isn't
[12:10] revealed no it's just a symbol as far as
[12:14] any man upon the Earth that's all he
[12:17] could
[12:18] say that's right he might stumble and
[12:21] stagger no doubt hit somewhere here or
[12:24] there and after a while but we find out
[12:27] then that in the book of the Revelation
[12:31] at the seventh Angel's
[12:34] message the Mysteries all the mysteries
[12:37] of it should already be revealed but
[12:40] that time that's Revelations uh 10 1-7
[12:44] that it should be revealed according to
[12:46] that time at that time when he did then
[12:49] the seven Thunders utter their strange
[12:51] voices and John was going to write but
[12:53] John knew what it was but he he didn't
[12:55] write it because he's forbidden to write
[12:57] it that's absolutely an all together
[13:00] mystery is not even in symble or nothing
[13:02] we just know he it thundered that's all
[13:05] and now in studying this now don't
[13:08] forget now suay uh Sunday morning we
[13:12] omitted the healing service because of
[13:15] having the answers to the uh to the
[13:17] people's question now I want you to have
[13:20] a question on these Seven Seals if it's
[13:23] bothering you something you don't
[13:25] understand let's have it on the Seven
[13:26] Seals then I can tell by Saturday night
[13:29] worries enough to to answer him or not
[13:31] you see and then just I just say Well
[13:34] about something else or should I do this
[13:36] or my I had a dream them them's all
[13:39] worthy things I remember they're worthy
[13:41] things but let's stay right with the
[13:43] Seven Seals that's what we're right on
[13:46] that's that's what the the meeting is
[13:48] designated to the Seven Seals let's stay
[13:50] right with that I got to go home got
[13:53] have a few meetings out in the west I'll
[13:55] be back again then in a little over a
[13:57] month or two or something like that and
[13:59] maybe the Lord will permit that we can
[14:02] have a something else on that maybe
[14:04] healing service or something that or
[14:05] whatever we're whatever is that we got
[14:07] seven trumpets here to come forth yet
[14:09] you see and that all comes in there to
[14:12] and the Seven vials see to be poured out
[14:15] so and it all blend right in here but
[14:17] it's all mysterious yet now last night
[14:21] we find that the first seal went forth
[14:25] and the Rider and the Lord so help me I
[14:28] never knew it before none of these
[14:30] things have I ever known before that's
[14:32] right and I just don't just go up there
[14:34] and take the Bible and sit down and sit
[14:36] there until when it goes to Breaking
[14:39] forth like that I pick up my pen and
[14:41] start R and just stay there maybe for
[14:44] hours till it gets uh it gets finished
[14:48] then I go back and I find out as I see
[14:50] where he said this I well looks like
[14:53] I've seen that somewhere I get my conard
[14:56] just go look back there something like
[14:57] that and here it is right here here and
[14:59] then here it is over here again here it
[15:01] is back here and down here and over here
[15:03] then I just tie it right in I know
[15:04] that's God as long as it's comparing
[15:07] scripture with scripture that's what it
[15:08] has to do it's like putting a building
[15:10] together the stones has to fit Stone by
[15:13] Stone now last night we had the opening
[15:17] of the um of the third seal first was a
[15:20] white horse and the next was a red horse
[15:23] and then a black horse and we find out
[15:26] that the Riders were the same Rider all
[15:29] the
[15:30] time and that was the Antichrist to
[15:33] start with he didn't have no no Crown
[15:36] but he receive one later on and then we
[15:39] find out that then he was given a sword
[15:41] to take peace from the earth and we find
[15:43] out that he did that then he come in
[15:46] with the dogmas of getting the church
[15:48] with money by weighing a penny of for
[15:50] this and two pennies for that but he
[15:53] forbidden to touch the O and the wine
[15:56] which was a little it was left and then
[15:59] we give left off last night with the
[16:02] illustration of what the oil and wine
[16:05] was and what the effects that it had and
[16:10] it might sound a little rude but uh it
[16:13] just exactly the truth amen now we left
[16:16] off on was just a few moments review of
[16:19] that now and then um we left off on the
[16:24] power of um the wine what the oril
[16:28] represented spirit I guess you all got
[16:30] it all down you'll find it on the tape
[16:32] if you didn't and um where to find the
[16:34] scriptures that the all always
[16:36] symbolizes the Holy Spirit like the
[16:38] foolish virgins of no or wise virgins
[16:41] with or which is the holy spirit then on
[16:43] back in and the the prophets and so
[16:46] forth and now of course I don't try to
[16:49] pull out every scripture in there and
[16:51] these things that you can't even speak
[16:52] about take too much time but I try to
[16:55] place out here with scriptures and so
[16:57] forth just enough to give the people so
[16:59] it'll let them know and see the picture
[17:02] of it but if you sit down with one of
[17:04] them seals why my you could take a
[17:07] month's sermons every night right on
[17:09] that seal and still not even touching
[17:11] see on one of them and that's how how
[17:13] much there is to it but just hit the
[17:15] high spots of it and then you can you
[17:17] can see what it's all about now as oral
[17:22] symbolize the Holy Spirit then we find
[17:25] out that oril and wine is connect Ed in
[17:30] worship always connected in worship and
[17:34] uh wine uh said which come to me that
[17:39] the wine symbolizes that it was the
[17:43] power of was a power of stimulation by
[17:49] Revelation and uh that's when something
[17:53] has been
[17:54] revealed it gives
[17:57] stimulation to the believer Hallelujah
[18:00] because it's presented by Revelation see
[18:03] it's something that God has said it's a
[18:06] mystery they can't understand it see and
[18:09] after a while God comes down and reveals
[18:13] it and then vindicates it remember if
[18:17] the truth is revealed the truth is also
[18:23] Vindicated
[18:24] God constantly no matter how smart the
[18:28] person might be how brilliant he might
[18:31] be in his mind if God don't back up what
[18:34] he's saying something
[18:37] wrong right because it's the word now
[18:40] when Moses went out there under the
[18:42] inspiration of God and said let flies
[18:45] come flies come said let frogs come
[18:49] frogs come see what if he said let flies
[18:52] come they didn't come see then he he
[18:54] didn't speak the word of the Lord see he
[18:56] only spoke he spoke his own word he
[18:59] might have thought they ought to be
[19:00] flies but they didn't any flies come
[19:03] because God hadn't told him so and when
[19:05] God tells you anything and says you go
[19:08] do this and I'll be right with it for
[19:10] this is my word and he shows it in the
[19:12] Bible then God stands right behind that
[19:15] and if it's not written in the Bible God
[19:17] stands behind it anyhow if it's God's
[19:19] word
[19:20] amen and then if it's outside of that
[19:23] it's revealed to prophets we realize
[19:25] that all the mysteries of God is made
[19:28] known to two prophets and them
[19:30] alone Amos
[19:33] 37 now now the power of uh Revelation
[19:39] brings stimulation to the believer for
[19:44] the power of wine natural wine is to
[19:48] stimulate see it's to to bring a person
[19:51] that's all slump down to
[19:55] stimulation well then uh now
[19:59] there's the
[20:01] power of the revelation of the word
[20:04] gives stimulation of Joy to the believer
[20:08] stimulation of satisfaction the
[20:11] stimulation that it's Vindicated it's
[20:14] proved it's called in the scripture as
[20:17] we want to refer to it as new wine we
[20:21] always refer to it like that as these
[20:23] are drunk on new wine see all right are
[20:28] Spirit spiritual wine I think the best
[20:30] interpretation be be on spiritual wine
[20:33] as the natural wine reveals itself in
[20:38] stimulated power so does the new wine as
[20:43] it reveals the word of God which is
[20:46] spirit amen there that's a see the word
[20:51] itself is Spirit you believe that just
[20:56] read it let's read St John 6 let's just
[20:59] then you then you want say well somebody
[21:01] said that let's let's see who said it
[21:03] and then we'll know where it's truth or
[21:05] Not St John the 6th
[21:09] chapter and um the 6th chapter and I
[21:13] believe it's a 60 63rd
[21:17] verse all right I think this
[21:22] it yes it is the spirit that Quicken the
[21:27] flesh profit nothing
[21:29] the words that I speak unto you they are
[21:32] spirit and they are
[21:36] life the word itself is spirit it's
[21:41] spirit in word
[21:44] form and then you see when it is
[21:48] quickened or brought to life the spirit
[21:51] of the word goes to work in
[21:55] Acts because that now look here a
[21:58] thought has to be a thought before it
[22:01] can be a word and then when a thought is
[22:04] presented it is a word now this is the
[22:09] God's uh thought that he has placed in
[22:13] the word and then when we receive it
[22:17] from him it becomes a
[22:20] word god revealed to Moses what to do
[22:25] Moses spoke it and it happened see
[22:29] that's it when it's really comes from
[22:49] [Music]
[22:57] God
[22:58] [Music]
[23:57] I
[23:59] [Music]

[1:35:02] and they said among themselves who shall
[1:35:04] roll us away the Stone from the door of
[1:35:07] the
[1:35:08] supper they they saw that the
[1:35:13] stone
[1:35:15] very and entering into the supper they
[1:35:17] saw a young man sitting on the right
[1:35:20] side clothed the long white garment and
[1:35:22] they were frightened
[1:35:36] isid him but go your way tell his
[1:35:39] disciples and Peter that he goeth before
[1:35:42] you into Galilee there shall ye see him
[1:35:46] as he said unto
[1:35:49] you and from
[1:35:52] the were amazed neither said they
[1:35:56] anything to any for they were afraid now
[1:36:00] when Jesus was risen early the first day
[1:36:02] of the week that's a Sunday he appeared
[1:36:05] first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he
[1:36:08] had cast Seven
[1:36:15] Devils and they when they had heard that
[1:36:18] he was alive and he had been seen of her
[1:36:21] belied not after that he appeared in
[1:36:25] another form of as they and
[1:36:30] the and they went and told it unto the
[1:36:33] residue neither believe they
[1:36:51] them and he said unto them go into all
[1:36:55] the world and preach the gospel to Every
[1:36:57] Creature
[1:37:01] heed he that believe not shall be and
[1:37:05] these signs shall follow them that
[1:37:07] believe in my name shall they cast out
[1:37:09] Devils they shall speak with new
[1:37:17] tongues them they shall lay hands on the
[1:37:21] SI and they shall Rec so then after the
[1:37:24] Lord had spoken unto them he was
[1:37:27] received up into heaven and sat on the
[1:37:29] right hand of God and they went forth
[1:37:32] and preached everywhere the Lord working
[1:37:35] with them and confirming the word with
[1:37:39] signs following amen amen that is the
[1:37:43] Easter message we'll take one more
[1:37:46] scripture found in Isaiah
[1:37:49] 53 I want to greet the Saints there in
[1:37:52] Mesa brother art and the Saints there
[1:37:56] that are gathered Isaiah
[1:38:04] 53 verses number one and
[1:38:07] two who have believed our report and to
[1:38:10] whom is the armor of the Lord revealed
[1:38:13] for he shall grow up before him as a
[1:38:15] tender plant and as a root out of dry
[1:38:18] ground he hath no form nor cess and when
[1:38:23] we shall see him there is no beauty that
[1:38:26] we should desire him let us pray Lord
[1:38:32] Jesus oh God as we hear the sirens in
[1:38:36] the background of some trauma taking
[1:38:40] place Lord we are so thankful to be in
[1:38:43] your presence this
[1:38:45] morning Lord we rather be here than the
[1:38:47] finest hospital or care home or rest
[1:38:51] home to be in your presence Lord there's
[1:38:55] fullness there's joy and as we've
[1:38:57] gathered in your name we ask you to
[1:38:59] speak to our hearts and may you speak to
[1:39:02] the young ones and the old ones alike
[1:39:05] our visitors our friends and Lord may we
[1:39:08] draw all draw closer to you is our
[1:39:11] prayer we ask father that you would move

[1:39:25] Truth in Jesus name we pray amen amen
[1:39:28] God bless you you can be seated to title
[1:39:31] of the message uh this morning the
[1:39:34] answer to pain Easter the answer to
[1:39:39] pain Easter the answer to pain now we
[1:39:43] live in a time where there's so many
[1:39:46] medications and
[1:39:48] medicines that will relieve
[1:39:51] pain but Easter will actually kill the
[1:39:54] pain it's not a pain reliever it's a
[1:39:57] pain killer it deals with the symptoms
[1:40:00] it deals with the sickness it deals with
[1:40:02] the attributes and the reasons why and
[1:40:06] in Isaiah 53 if we took time to read it
[1:40:09] all through verse number
[1:40:12] 12 there are uh 13 pains that I call
[1:40:17] them in Isaiah
[1:40:20] 53 that Calvary took care of his
[1:40:23] he had no form no caless no Beauty he
[1:40:26] was despised rejected Sorrows grief
[1:40:29] stricken smitten Afflicted wounded
[1:40:32] bruised chastised Stripes oppressed and
[1:40:36] cut off those are the the verbs or what
[1:40:42] would those be
[1:40:43] verbs adjectives thank you that for the
[1:40:47] teach a teacher maybe he can help me out
[1:40:50] he's a school teacher these are the
[1:40:52] descriptions
[1:40:54] of what took place in Isaiah
[1:40:56] 53 very horrible very hard very harsh
[1:41:01] happening but in the end it says that
[1:41:05] his he was numbered with the
[1:41:09] transgressors and he beared the sin of
[1:41:12] many and made intercession for the
[1:41:17] transgressors and that's us we are the
[1:41:20] transgressors right and he bore our sins
[1:41:24] at Calvary so that we can be free
[1:41:28] today and that's worthy of a lifetime of
[1:41:33] giving God thanks and
[1:41:36] praise I amen I I can't think of
[1:41:40] anything greater this is the greatest of
[1:41:43] holidays contrary to the little kitties
[1:41:46] you might think Christmas or some would
[1:41:48] say Thanksgiving or 4th of July or Cinco
[1:41:51] Deo or whatever whatever the holiday
[1:41:54] Canadian day but the greatest of all of
[1:41:56] the holidays if we had one would be
[1:42:00] Easter our founder was
[1:42:03] bruised he was rejected he was
[1:42:06] despised and then he was sent into his
[1:42:10] grave and his disciples didn't
[1:42:13] understand it they didn't have it all
[1:42:15] together it looked like he lost it
[1:42:18] looked like Satan won but that was only
[1:42:22] Friday
[1:42:23] that was only Friday keep living
[1:42:26] Saturday is coming and then Sunday is
[1:42:30] coming Resurrection morning is coming
[1:42:34] amen so sometimes we look at our tests
[1:42:36] and our trials and it's so hard it's so
[1:42:39] difficult it's so Troublesome but it's
[1:42:41] only
[1:42:42] Friday it's only
[1:42:45] Friday Sunday is
[1:42:48] coming yes the grave can't hold him
[1:42:54] can't hold him no no no no and so this
[1:42:57] is a special time of the year for the
[1:42:59] believer I'm just going to take my time
[1:43:01] this morning if the Lord will help me
[1:43:03] but there's a quotation in the true and
[1:43:06] false Vine and it just deals with this
[1:43:09] time of the year and brother random says
[1:43:11] this
[1:43:12] here paragraph number three and in this
[1:43:14] Cru great crucifixion time and
[1:43:17] Resurrection time how it seems to be
[1:43:21] that heaven just hangs near the Earth
[1:43:24] during this
[1:43:25] time I've always thought that Jesus
[1:43:29] Second Coming would be in the spring of
[1:43:31] the year just in all Resurrection he was
[1:43:35] born in the spring of the Year anybody
[1:43:37] would think he was born December 25th is
[1:43:40] mentally
[1:43:41] upset how could the Shepherds be on the
[1:43:44] hills of Judea in 4 foot of snow
[1:43:47] watching their herds at night or
[1:43:50] something like that no the real Orthodox
[1:43:54] Believers don't believe that he was born
[1:43:57] along April or May somewhere like that
[1:44:00] in the springtime like all other nature
[1:44:04] he was the very creator of nature he
[1:44:08] come with nature and so I believe he was
[1:44:12] born in the spring I don't know that he
[1:44:15] will come in the spring but I have a
[1:44:18] feeling that it will be some beautiful
[1:44:21] spring morning when when he
[1:44:24] appears whenever it is I want to be
[1:44:26] ready no matter what time it is if it's
[1:44:29] midnight or daylight or spring or fall
[1:44:32] winter whenever it is I want to be
[1:44:36] prepared to meet him amen so it's
[1:44:39] beautiful how brother random takes this
[1:44:42] time of the year and he says it just
[1:44:44] seems like heaven hangs near the Earth
[1:44:48] during this time why is that because the
[1:44:52] great cre Creator had given his life
[1:44:55] during this time of the year the great
[1:44:59] Creator the king of kings and Lord of
[1:45:01] lords Ransom his life to answer the sin
[1:45:05] question for all of humanity if this
[1:45:08] doesn't work nothing else will work if
[1:45:12] the Redemption that come through Christ
[1:45:16] never that message never reaches you
[1:45:19] then you'll always be
[1:45:21] incomplete your life will never make
[1:45:24] sense you'll never mature to what you
[1:45:27] should be you'll always you'll always be
[1:45:31] empty and left without that's why this
[1:45:33] book The Book of Life the Bible is the
[1:45:37] Mysteries and there's names that were
[1:45:39] written in the book that had to come
[1:45:42] forth you remember when brother Brandon
[1:45:44] brought the Seven Seals and as he was
[1:45:46] bringing it that angel the the the
[1:45:50] angels caught him up into the
[1:45:51] constellation and he saw seven angels
[1:45:54] appear before him 1 two 3 four five six
[1:45:58] seven and the seventh one meant more to
[1:46:02] him than all the other ones and then
[1:46:05] brother Rand makes a statement like this
[1:46:06] he says the thing I wondered about my
[1:46:09] whole
[1:46:11] life see the question of his life is now
[1:46:14] being answered when the answers in the
[1:46:17] Bible begin to be answered in his life
[1:46:20] same thing with you it only makes sense
[1:46:22] when when this starts to make sense to
[1:46:25] you this is the main piece missing in
[1:46:28] anybody's life they think it's this and
[1:46:31] go over there and make more money and go
[1:46:33] over here and go over there until you
[1:46:35] get this right here revealed in your
[1:46:37] life you'll still be missing you still
[1:46:40] come up short you're still
[1:46:42] empty-handed still not happy but once
[1:46:45] you get this book in your life and the
[1:46:49] author of the book begins to open up the
[1:46:52] understanding
[1:46:53] oh it doesn't matter if you're rich or
[1:46:56] poor it doesn't matter if they like you
[1:46:58] or they don't like you oh my I found the
[1:47:04] answer to my life and all my heart's
[1:47:08] desires her being
[1:47:10] fulfilled and met in the Lord Jesus
[1:47:13] Christ
[1:47:15] amen and so it seems like heaven hangs
[1:47:18] down a little lower during this time now
[1:47:22] now these pains that killed our lord
[1:47:26] Jesus we think of the wounds on his side
[1:47:31] The Thorn and his
[1:47:32] brow and we think of the pains how they
[1:47:36] beat
[1:47:37] him and they spit upon him they punched
[1:47:41] him in the
[1:47:42] face they beat him up like a little lamb
[1:47:45] a defenseless little lamb and we can see
[1:47:49] that this was a major pain major
[1:47:55] blow but brother bam goes deeper into
[1:47:57] the message and he shares with us that
[1:48:00] it wasn't those pains is what killed him
[1:48:05] he says that our lord Jesus died of a
[1:48:08] broken
[1:48:09] heart his heart was broken and there's
[1:48:12] nothing more there's nothing more
[1:48:15] painful than those kind of emotional
[1:48:19] pains like
[1:48:21] rejection or someone lie on you or to
[1:48:25] someone to do something in in that you
[1:48:28] know you know in that uh and that sense
[1:48:32] of of working in your spirit to cause
[1:48:34] you to be nervous or to cause you to
[1:48:37] stress the great killer today is stress
[1:48:41] the great issue today is mental
[1:48:44] unbalance mental health issues and and
[1:48:48] people can't keep it together up here
[1:48:50] they're losing their mind
[1:48:53] they need something to stay medicated or
[1:48:56] help them to cope they need another
[1:48:58] movie they need another drug they need
[1:49:01] something to keep them you know
[1:49:05] stabilized but we know that the answer
[1:49:07] to any kind of a pain or any kind of
[1:49:10] trauma or answer to any kind of
[1:49:13] imbalance is
[1:49:15] Easter the answer is the Lamb of God the
[1:49:19] Lamb Of Glory he deals with those pains
[1:49:22] of rejection and he deals with it in a
[1:49:26] very very deep way and brother Adam says
[1:49:28] this here in the message the mighty
[1:49:30] conqueror
[1:49:31] 1958 he says they smacked her so we'll
[1:49:35] go up a little bit let me take this in
[1:49:38] here 19 um 56
[1:49:43] sorry he
[1:49:45] says in paragraph
[1:49:50] 118 many times 19 many times that people
[1:49:54] judge people by the way they dress or by
[1:49:56] their State statue man is not judged by
[1:49:59] how big he is or how strong he is his
[1:50:02] muscles man is judged by character and
[1:50:05] character alone I've seen men that weigh
[1:50:08] 20000 lb that didn't have an ounce of
[1:50:10] man about them man is judged by
[1:50:14] character what he is in his heart and
[1:50:18] Christ was not judged by a physical
[1:50:21] strength but he was judged by character
[1:50:24] never a man ever Liv like him or never a
[1:50:27] man could ever die like him never a man
[1:50:30] could Ascend up on high like him because
[1:50:33] he was God I am no man he he made
[1:50:37] himself of no reputation did you ever
[1:50:39] think the man that made an artificial
[1:50:42] eye made a reputation the man that made
[1:50:46] false teeth made a reputation the man
[1:50:49] that made a wooden arm made a reputation
[1:50:51] for himself but but the man who made the
[1:50:54] original eye the man who made the
[1:50:57] original arm the man he made himself no
[1:51:02] reputation but become a servant a
[1:51:05] bondsman unto men who were Sinners that
[1:51:08] he might win them back How could a man
[1:51:11] in his right mind know the gospel truth
[1:51:14] of that and reject the man reject the
[1:51:17] offer God has give to save the man from
[1:51:20] a life of sin how can he do it
[1:51:23] I just can't understand it how that you
[1:51:25] could reject such a one when he's not
[1:51:28] here to make anything that you have to
[1:51:30] do for him but just offering you a way
[1:51:34] of escape from the things that you're
[1:51:37] going to and become that for you when he
[1:51:41] did when he was dying Yonder at Calvary
[1:51:44] everything had rejected him they had
[1:51:47] spit on him his face was full of mockery
[1:51:50] spit they had a rag around his eyes they
[1:51:53] hid him in the head and said if you're a
[1:51:56] prophet tell us who hit you a little
[1:51:58] woman run in the midst of them and says
[1:52:01] what has he done but heal your sick and
[1:52:04] raise your
[1:52:05] good they smacked her in the
[1:52:09] mouth and said would you listen to that
[1:52:12] woman instead of your priest away with
[1:52:14] such a person and his own Dear Mother
[1:52:17] walking in his bloody Footprints God let
[1:52:21] me walk that same way
[1:52:23] as he went Yonder to Calvary down in her
[1:52:25] heart was a wondering when she seen her
[1:52:28] darling child die Yonder a man 33 years
[1:52:31] old and look like he look like 50 the
[1:52:35] Bible said his strain and where he
[1:52:38] probably turning gray and the grim look
[1:52:41] on his face to where he was suffering
[1:52:44] not so much physically but as it was
[1:52:49] Agony the Bible said that his blood and
[1:52:51] water separated from each other and any
[1:52:54] doctor anything can tell you that knows
[1:52:57] the chemistry of blood that only show
[1:53:00] that that only sorrow will do that he
[1:53:04] never died from a Roman spear neither
[1:53:07] did he die from a nail drove in his hand
[1:53:10] or his feet but he died of a broken
[1:53:13] heart being rejected he came to his own
[1:53:17] his own received him not he said brother
[1:53:20] brandham I wish I could have stood there
[1:53:22] that dead Calvary brother you're
[1:53:24] standing in a better place today you're
[1:53:27] standing in the presence of the
[1:53:28] resurrected Lord Jesus who has proved
[1:53:31] himself
[1:53:33] triumphant so let me think of this you
[1:53:35] know brother Billy Paul gives a
[1:53:37] testimony about his dad how if he would
[1:53:40] cut up and act up he says that said
[1:53:42] Billy we're going to go to the Woodshed
[1:53:44] later he's talking about he was going to
[1:53:47] correct him and spank him he says then
[1:53:49] later on that when brother bham
[1:53:53] would instead of spanking him he would
[1:53:55] talk to him and he said he would much
[1:53:58] prefer to take a spanking than to have
[1:54:01] brother bam verbally deal with him you
[1:54:05] see because of spanking you can slap me
[1:54:07] hit me and I'm like I can shake it
[1:54:09] off but emotional something in the heart
[1:54:14] Agony
[1:54:16] rejection I've disappointed you you
[1:54:19] don't like me anymore or I don't love
[1:54:22] you anymore those emotional strains are
[1:54:27] far harder to deal with and this is part
[1:54:29] of the crisis of our day there's an
[1:54:33] emotional crisis going on there's a a
[1:54:36] deep problem an issue with people today
[1:54:40] just on their
[1:54:42] emotions and I just want to tell the
[1:54:44] Saints here today that he's still the
[1:54:47] Healer of your body and not just your
[1:54:50] body we're talking about your
[1:54:53] brain and the way you think the Bible
[1:54:56] says he'll keep you in perfect peace if
[1:55:00] you keep your mind stayed on him there's
[1:55:03] enough things out there going on that a
[1:55:05] man or woman would lose their mind amen
[1:55:09] but we got a sound mind today because
[1:55:12] the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:55:15] Keeps Us grounded gives us perspective
[1:55:20] we don't get upset like they get upset
[1:55:21] out there
[1:55:23] we have a right we have a home in glory
[1:55:26] and we know God has a purpose for our
[1:55:28] life so we can deal with the trauma deal
[1:55:32] with the issues as they
[1:55:35] come and so brother random says it again
[1:55:37] here in the message living dying buried
[1:55:40] Rising coming 1959 he says it's been
[1:55:44] some time ago I was speaking to someone
[1:55:46] about this it was a scientist that said
[1:55:49] there's only one way that could have
[1:55:51] happened it was not because of the Roman
[1:55:54] spear that he died and neither was it
[1:55:56] the loss of blood that he died because
[1:55:59] there was still blood in his body what
[1:56:01] he died of was not because of a Roman
[1:56:04] spear or the nails that was drove in his
[1:56:07] hands or the crown they placed on his
[1:56:10] head but because he died of
[1:56:13] grief he came to his own and his own
[1:56:16] received him not he died of a broken
[1:56:20] heart when he know that the very
[1:56:22] creatures of time that he would die to
[1:56:25] redeem had spit in his face and he was
[1:56:27] rejected of men David 800 years before
[1:56:31] it happened cried with the very voice
[1:56:34] that he cried at Calvary my God my God
[1:56:38] why H has Thou forsaken me so to be
[1:56:42] forsaken to be left to be abandoned to
[1:56:46] be rejected is far more painful to a
[1:56:51] human being
[1:56:53] and Jesus died of a broken heart Saints
[1:56:56] he died of this
[1:56:58] oppression now I counted it amount
[1:57:01] there's of these 13 pains in Isaiah 53
[1:57:05] there six of them are emotional seven of
[1:57:08] them were physical pains that he went
[1:57:11] through in Isaiah
[1:57:13] 53 and so we see that he died of a
[1:57:16] broken heart and we see that this age is
[1:57:19] a nervous age and it's a neurotic
[1:57:22] age brother brandom deals with it in
[1:57:25] Elijah the prophet
[1:57:27] 1956 amen can I take a little time all
[1:57:30] right we sang for an hour and a half we
[1:57:32] should be able to preach for at least
[1:57:36] that do we have service tonight there's
[1:57:39] no service
[1:57:42] tonight I got plenty of time brother
[1:57:45] John amen all right take your time you
[1:57:48] know the visitors always say that take
[1:57:51] your time
[1:57:53] I want to hear from the Home Folks
[1:57:56] brother Israel take your time God bless
[1:57:59] you all right thank you in Spanish and
[1:58:03] in English take your time all right here
[1:58:06] what the prophet of God says here in
[1:58:07] this message talking about nervousness
[1:58:10] and how serious it is in paragraph
[1:58:11] number 69 in this message Elijah the
[1:58:15] prophet he says now look son he's
[1:58:17] dealing with this this is in a prayer
[1:58:19] line he's talking to a young man that
[1:58:21] has nervous issues and problems in his
[1:58:24] life he says now look son nervousness is
[1:58:28] the hardest thing there is to
[1:58:30] fight worse than
[1:58:33] cancer because you can't mentally
[1:58:35] balance yourself right you see you can't
[1:58:38] get your mind running right but now you
[1:58:42] start from right now knowing that you're
[1:58:44] standing in the presence of God and say
[1:58:47] this hour right now I am healed and go
[1:58:52] out saying the same thing say it till
[1:58:56] you actually believe it see till you
[1:58:59] really believe it and then you'll get
[1:59:01] well do you believe that now go
[1:59:04] rejoicing and let me know what happens
[1:59:07] to you
[1:59:08] amen I like that here the prophet of God
[1:59:11] in the message 1952 Jesus Christ the
[1:59:13] same yesterday today and forever
[1:59:15] paragraph
[1:59:17] 39 I want you to say I want to say
[1:59:21] there's so many people passing through
[1:59:23] here that's suffering with mental
[1:59:26] oppression demon manifestation but
[1:59:30] oppression
[1:59:31] Satan I seen a vision break before me of
[1:59:34] a young lady she went back there and sat
[1:59:37] down a few minutes ago that thinks she's
[1:59:39] crossed the separating line don't let
[1:59:42] Satan tell you that as long as you love
[1:59:46] God God still loves you it has to be a
[1:59:50] Creator to create that creation in your
[1:59:52] heart to make you love God don't you
[1:59:55] believe that see go believing with all
[1:59:57] your heart that Christ loves you amen
[2:00:00] how many loves the lord well somebody
[2:00:03] put that in your heart to love him the
[2:00:06] Creator put that in your heart to love
[2:00:09] him and he loves you too so we see this
[2:00:13] mental oppression we see the nervousness
[2:00:17] we see that these are issues that people
[2:00:19] have to deal with and I I won't say it
[2:00:22] it's because you're not spiritual I
[2:00:25] won't say it's because you're not a
[2:00:27] Christian it's just what you have to
[2:00:29] deal with brother bradam had to deal
[2:00:31] with it and he dealt with it it it it
[2:00:35] was a nervousness that would come over
[2:00:36] him every seven
[2:00:39] years and it would make him get
[2:00:41] discouraged and the doctors would look
[2:00:43] at him and they examined him and he
[2:00:46] details this in the message on the wings
[2:00:48] of a snow white dove so the prophet had
[2:00:51] to deal with
[2:00:52] oppression he dealt with rejection it's
[2:00:56] not a spiritual the thermometer it's not
[2:00:58] saying you're not spiritual it's just
[2:01:00] that you have to deal with it and God
[2:01:04] already dealt with it and he dealt with
[2:01:07] it one Easter morning when he got up out
[2:01:10] of the
[2:01:11] grave and this is the answer to all of
[2:01:15] your problems pains and
[2:01:18] troubles don't let the devil Sidetrack
[2:01:20] you and think you're not not a good
[2:01:22] person or you need to be a better person
[2:01:24] no we're not talking about your person
[2:01:26] we're talking about the person that got
[2:01:28] up out of the
[2:01:29] Grave he was
[2:01:31] worthy he was a good person he was a
[2:01:35] nice guy we're not talking about you
[2:01:38] being a nice guy he's the nice guy and
[2:01:42] that's all we're talking about he's the
[2:01:44] one we're preach about and when he comes
[2:01:47] inside of you he begins to deal with all
[2:01:49] of this so brother bam takes us in the
[2:01:53] message letting off the pressure and he
[2:01:54] says this in paragraph
[2:01:56] 24 see it's just built up pressure it's
[2:01:59] the age that we're living in a neurotic
[2:02:04] age where people don't know what to
[2:02:07] do where they're going and the doctors
[2:02:10] don't have the answer for it because the
[2:02:14] psychiatrist is being doctored by the
[2:02:18] psychiatrist so they have not the answer
[2:02:22] that's right right but there's some
[2:02:24] answer surely
[2:02:26] somewhere we can deal on it for hours
[2:02:28] but I was thinking that God has the
[2:02:31] answer if they can just set in a place
[2:02:34] like this takes off the pressure SE with
[2:02:38] people who are entertained into eternity
[2:02:42] we're not going into we're already in it
[2:02:46] that's right praise the
[2:02:48] Lord he continues on in the same message
[2:02:51] paragraph 54 and then the nervous
[2:02:54] neurotic age that we're living in you
[2:02:56] know in all of this the doctors don't
[2:02:59] have the answer cuz they're plagued with
[2:03:01] it too they don't have the answer they
[2:03:04] don't know what to
[2:03:07] do you say oh doctor I'm just about to
[2:03:10] blow my head I don't know what to do
[2:03:12] well he'd say I am too well there is
[2:03:15] nothing you can do he could give you a
[2:03:18] tranquilizer when that wears off you're
[2:03:20] more nervous than you was in the first
[2:03:22] place like a drunk man taking an extra
[2:03:25] drink to get over his drunkenness you
[2:03:29] see you can't do it there's no answer
[2:03:30] they don't have it but God has the
[2:03:33] answer amen that's what we want to talk
[2:03:35] about to have the answer God has got the
[2:03:39] answer he is the answer Christ is the
[2:03:42] answer to every problem we got now we're
[2:03:46] going to talk about him now so God's got
[2:03:49] the answer Saints he is the
[2:03:53] answer so many times we listen to what
[2:03:57] the world tells us what we need to be
[2:03:59] doing now and what the answer is today
[2:04:03] but we already have the answer and that
[2:04:06] answer has been given to us through his
[2:04:10] word we thank God it's the most valuable
[2:04:13] thing you got when God gives you faith
[2:04:17] in his word the enemy comes to steal
[2:04:20] kill and dest destroy your confidence in
[2:04:24] God's word he wants you to leave it on
[2:04:27] the shelf and try something else wants
[2:04:30] you to try to get good yourself you
[2:04:32] can't get good yourself but he's got a
[2:04:35] way that you can get good it starts by
[2:04:38] an oldfashioned
[2:04:40] altar it starts by coming to him with
[2:04:44] nothing in my arms I bring only to your
[2:04:48] cross do I cling that's where it starts
[2:04:52] oldfashioned altar seems simple doesn't
[2:04:55] it seems like it's more to it than that
[2:04:57] that's what man will do they want to
[2:04:59] make it more than that but you come to
[2:05:02] him and he's got the answer to all of
[2:05:05] your problems I'm so glad about that
[2:05:09] because there's some problems in this
[2:05:11] life how many's ever had your heart
[2:05:14] broken how many's ever had your
[2:05:16] confidence taken
[2:05:18] away how many ever felt like you've been
[2:05:21] rejected
[2:05:22] Ed that's not a good feeling is it
[2:05:25] that's not something you could just roll
[2:05:27] your eyes at and just like shake it off
[2:05:30] it's something you have to really go
[2:05:32] through and God has the answer for that
[2:05:36] and we're so glad that he died not just
[2:05:39] of the physical pain but there was
[2:05:42] nobody that can die like he
[2:05:45] died he was the king of
[2:05:48] glory he who knew no sin became sin that
[2:05:54] we might be made the righteousness in
[2:05:57] him that's what the Bible says he became
[2:06:00] sin he who knew no sin that we might be
[2:06:03] become the righteousness of God in him
[2:06:07] he became sin amen he became
[2:06:11] ugly he became disfigured and
[2:06:14] disformed he was rejected on all
[2:06:19] levels his closest men that he called
[2:06:22] there was 12 of them and one of them
[2:06:25] ratted him
[2:06:26] out one of him one of his own men one of
[2:06:30] his own boys turned their back on him
[2:06:34] and then when he said he was going to
[2:06:36] rise up on the third day when he rose up
[2:06:40] nobody stood for him right the Two
[2:06:42] Sisters went and saw him in the grave
[2:06:44] they said he's risen and nobody believed
[2:06:47] him rejected on all levels reject Ed
[2:06:51] here on Earth rejected in his
[2:06:54] neighborhood couldn't even preach in his
[2:06:56] neighborhood who is he the farmer who is
[2:06:58] he the carpenter son where he was
[2:07:00] rejected on all
[2:07:02] levels the ministry the priesthood they
[2:07:05] rejected they all rejected
[2:07:07] him certainly did it was the poor and
[2:07:11] those that were the least of Sinners
[2:07:14] that actually would listen to him every
[2:07:16] now and then so he came to the poor and
[2:07:20] the broken amen he went into the hood
[2:07:23] amen cuz that's where they received him
[2:07:26] yes sir amen you all know what the hood
[2:07:29] is don't you amen neighborhood okay it's
[2:07:34] the hood it's a neighborhood without
[2:07:37] neighbors or not friendly ones
[2:07:40] anyways he goes into these areas where
[2:07:44] they're rejected are because he's
[2:07:46] rejected and he preaches a gospel
[2:07:48] message and they hear his voice
[2:07:52] and they are affected by his ministry
[2:07:55] and so he's the rejected one he's the
[2:07:59] one that was taken out of you know he he
[2:08:03] was unpopular he made himself of no
[2:08:05] reputation he stood in the back all the
[2:08:08] time and they rejected him they should
[2:08:11] have all embraced
[2:08:14] him and you know what he's still
[2:08:16] rejected today am you know the Lord
[2:08:19] Jesus can come down in the form of the
[2:08:22] Holy Spirit into a meeting like this and
[2:08:26] begin to touch hearts and people will
[2:08:29] begin to weep and cry and the educated
[2:08:32] and the m and the great leaders of the
[2:08:35] day will reject that they always do amen
[2:08:40] they reject the moving of the Holy
[2:08:42] Spirit they want the picture of the Lord
[2:08:45] Jesus but they don't want the
[2:08:47] manifestation of the Lord Jesus when he
[2:08:50] comes down and he breaks you down and
[2:08:53] you begin to cry Lord save
[2:08:57] me amen you cry out in a lot of churches
[2:09:00] you can do that in when you get so happy
[2:09:04] that the Lord set you free and you want
[2:09:07] to go dance and you want to go run ain't
[2:09:10] a lot of places you can do that in but
[2:09:13] you can do it in his presence because in
[2:09:16] his presence he welcomes that amen amen
[2:09:20] amen
[2:09:23] amen he still
[2:09:26] rejected a man of
[2:09:28] sorrow and acquainted with
[2:09:31] grief
[2:09:33] now this day we call
[2:09:37] Easter this year it fell on what is
[2:09:39] today's date the 31st of
[2:09:41] March it may or April or March or April
[2:09:46] and
[2:09:48] um brother bandam I like the way he
[2:09:50] brings this here I have one page or so
[2:09:53] of quotes that I want to read and then
[2:09:55] we'll be
[2:09:57] done he talks
[2:10:00] about this evening time message and how
[2:10:04] this
[2:10:05] Easter these two women and one scripture
[2:10:09] has three but the two women which is the
[2:10:12] witness they see Easter for the first
[2:10:15] time but actually job saw Easter
[2:10:18] thousands of years
[2:10:20] before and job he saw Easter not when
[2:10:24] everything was going well in his life he
[2:10:26] saw Easter when he lost
[2:10:29] everything and job himself was
[2:10:32] rejected he was rejected by his friends
[2:10:35] rejected by church folks rejected by
[2:10:38] people that he probably spent most of
[2:10:40] his time
[2:10:42] helping ain't nothing worse than being
[2:10:44] rejected by your own right you expect
[2:10:48] the stranger to reject you but one of
[2:10:51] your friends one of your family members
[2:10:54] your spouse when they reject you there's
[2:10:57] no pain like the rejected pain and Jesus
[2:11:01] knew what this was and job knew what it
[2:11:05] was and here he was rejected and he
[2:11:09] loses all his family he loses his cattle
[2:11:13] his donkeys his sheep he loses it all
[2:11:17] and then he loses his health not enough
[2:11:21] money to to cure what job had he didn't
[2:11:24] have an answer God didn't speak to him
[2:11:28] his mind battles are probably raging
[2:11:31] high on what did I do wrong where did I
[2:11:34] mess up at he's trying to reconcile
[2:11:37] what's going on all job did was live
[2:11:41] right
[2:11:42] job sacrificed continually for his
[2:11:46] family the Bible says he did that
[2:11:49] continually not because he saw trauma or
[2:11:52] problems in his family he did that per
[2:11:56] chance there was problems in the family
[2:12:00] right the Bible says he did this does
[2:12:02] this continually then finally a deal was
[2:12:05] made between Satan and God and they put
[2:12:08] a contract out on job job didn't even
[2:12:11] know it that God was betting for him and
[2:12:16] Satan was betting against him he didn't
[2:12:18] even know it he's just living his life
[2:12:21] all of a sudden things start to change
[2:12:23] and layer after layer after layer of
[2:12:27] problems come as I said this morning
[2:12:30] many times your problems are sandwiched
[2:12:33] between peoples and
[2:12:37] circumstances it's not all people and
[2:12:40] it's not all circumstances but it's a
[2:12:47] mixture it's some people that I I if you
[2:12:50] just if I just show told you a picture
[2:12:51] of some people that got on your nerves
[2:12:53] they'll still get on your nerves tonight
[2:12:56] this morning you know more feeling will
[2:12:58] come over you're
[2:13:00] like I love them
[2:13:04] but and job's tests were sandwiched in
[2:13:09] between these situations the first tests
[2:13:12] were people the civilians came and took
[2:13:14] his animals the next test was a fire
[2:13:17] from God from Heaven the next test was
[2:13:21] was the Chaldeans came another group of
[2:13:23] people and then the next test was the
[2:13:25] great wind and then the final hard test
[2:13:29] was his wife so you see these these
[2:13:32] human and Circumstance sandwiches that
[2:13:34] God makes and delivers to
[2:13:37] job
[2:13:39] packages of
[2:13:42] blessings packages of
[2:13:45] gold yes that's what it is a test is
[2:13:50] more pre ious than go say what the Bible
[2:13:53] says these trials are more precious than
[2:13:57] what and what we want is more gold don't
[2:14:00] we you said you wanted more money more
[2:14:04] gold and God sends you a test or a trial
[2:14:06] so let me let me bring this here so job
[2:14:10] sees Easter for the first time when he
[2:14:13] sees Easter he screams out I know my
[2:14:16] redeemer lives
[2:14:19] amen he didn't say that before but the
[2:14:23] test and the trial squeezed it out of
[2:14:27] him you know sometimes we don't say Amen
[2:14:31] until we going through something really
[2:14:33] really deep yes sir amen you don't want
[2:14:35] to say Amen now he knows how to get one
[2:14:39] out of
[2:14:40] you you don't think the prayer meeting
[2:14:42] is important you don't think praying to
[2:14:44] God is important there's a circumstance
[2:14:47] there's a test that you will go through
[2:14:50] that will put you on your
[2:14:52] knees how many know what I'm talking
[2:14:54] about there's tests and trials that will
[2:14:58] develop a prayer life in
[2:15:01] you they don't come just by you thinking
[2:15:04] about it no you're going through
[2:15:07] something you feel it it's painful it
[2:15:09] hurts and you're going through and all
[2:15:12] you can do is pray yes and call on the
[2:15:15] name of the
[2:15:16] Lord he allows that for a purpose and
[2:15:19] he's got a purpose
[2:15:21] that purpose that word purpose means the
[2:15:24] reason for which something is
[2:15:27] done the reason something is
[2:15:30] created it's the reason that it is it
[2:15:33] even exists that's what that word
[2:15:35] purpose means now brother bam takes in

[2:22:38] sealed in that book how many know he
[2:22:39] said that amen so you trying to write a
[2:22:43] book better than this one you needed to
[2:22:45] start before the foundation of the world
[2:22:48] that's when this one was written before
[2:22:51] the foundation of the world and in there
[2:22:54] there were names there were ages there
[2:22:56] were times that had to be manifested and
[2:22:59] fulfilled we see it in job we see it in
[2:23:02] the prophets we see it in our lord Jesus
[2:23:04] we see it even in the ministry of the
[2:23:07] Reverend William brandham he says this
