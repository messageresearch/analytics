[26:31] amen God's Prophet brother brandham you
[26:33] can be
[26:36] seated no before Becky is born and so I
[26:40] I thought well you know I I just eat a
[26:43] bowl of oatmeal cost a dime well I just
[26:46] they gave me my ticket and just signed
[26:47] it to see I paid for it give it back and
[26:49] I turned it in because I had an expense
[26:51] count and one day when we had a a
[26:55] patrolman's meeting my they said who's
[26:58] this nut that turn in something like
[27:00] that see the head guy you know 10 cents
[27:03] for a breakfast so that looks real cheap
[27:05] on the other Fells you know some of them
[27:06] turn in a dollar see $2 for a dinner and
[27:09] I turn into just exactly what it was
[27:12] well I said well there's no need of
[27:14] me turning in what would I do if I just
[27:18] eat 10 cents Mr fields which is
[27:20] assistant superintendent he said Billy
[27:23] turn it in a dollar anyhow at least
[27:25] that's what the rest of them do and said
[27:26] you got to keep that together
[27:28] well I said I I never eat but just a
[27:29] little old meal that's what I charge for
[27:31] I said oh don't never do that well then
[27:34] I thought what will I do with it then I
[27:36] charge 50 cents for breakfast and I take
[27:38] 40 cents left get some kids on the
[27:40] street some kids you know look like they
[27:42] need a
[27:43] sandwich I thought maybe I might
[27:47] have uh right that was a company itself
[27:49] talking to me like that that's a man out
[27:51] of the company so I thought maybe I I
[27:53] did something wrong so here not long ago
[27:56] uh with a patrolman now they P control
[27:58] of a helicopters you see so he came by
[28:00] and stopped he said to say brother Bram
[28:04] said this tree is growing us yeah I said
[28:06] kids playing with that out there I said
[28:08] can we top it I said yeah but don't cut
[28:09] it down see he said Well we'd like to
[28:12] cut it we pay for it I no no don't want
[28:15] you cut it well I know the laws are
[28:17] right away too you know cuz that it's on
[28:18] it seven years and I said no I said I
[28:21] don't want to cut but you can top it I
[28:22] said I I keep it top but I said you can
[28:25] you can top it if you want to I said I
[28:27] brother woods and I fix to top it we top
[28:29] all these others along here and I said
[28:31] but we'd like to keep that there on kind
[28:33] of kids Joel and you know little Fell's
[28:35] playing on that
[28:37] tree I went away on a trip when I come
[28:39] back she sawed down and moved
[28:41] out oo what a suit that would have been
[28:44] on the company you see for cutting that
[28:46] tree you see and so I thought now I said
[28:50] Lord I'm not going to even mention that
[28:52] see whether if there is anything that I
[28:55] that I on that sometimes turnning in
[28:57] only eating a dime have turning 50 cents
[28:59] see I said if there is something on that
[29:02] let that make it up see that I I I put
[29:06] that in you see that I and I quit
[29:08] dreaming about being a Public Service
[29:09] Company then see because it must have
[29:11] been something back in there we have to
[29:14] watch what we do we got to meet it
[29:17] someday kids come over here your mother
[29:21] was over the day
[29:23] Trudy I guess you didn't you didn't know
[29:26] this is kind of little surprising see
[29:28] and um you're fixed to graduate and
[29:31] we've had this trip out here together
[29:33] I'll go into a meeting now immediately
[29:35] after this meeting we're going home I
[29:37] thought it' be a good chance to talk to
[29:39] you all and then also thought it' be
[29:41] good to speak to the kids just a little
[29:43] bit before your
[29:44] graduation read a verse out of the Bible
[29:46] and just talk to you from my heart for
[29:47] about 10 minutes I'll step out of your
[29:49] way
[29:52] see um before I talk to the kids I just
[29:55] like to talk to the adults just a minute
[29:56] the two all of you it's
[29:59] um been a perhaps maybe a strous trip
[30:04] it's been um but the experience that
[30:08] I've learned from God I wouldn't take
[30:10] $10,000 for what I learned of the Lord
[30:13] since I've been here I truly believe I
[30:16] come in full obedience to the command of
[30:18] the
[30:20] almighty and uh I hope I can ever remain
[30:23] that way and there's a when I come
[30:28] one thing was by a vision that I
[30:30] standing above Tucson up here when uh a
[30:34] blast went
[30:35] off brother Fred was there when it went
[30:38] off and uh they took a picture you know
[30:41] in the sky and I didn't think much about
[30:43] it never noticed it so it began to
[30:46] impress me somehow the day and brother
[30:48] Norman Norman's Father Here told me said
[30:51] did you notice this and just as it look
[30:54] right there was that angel just as plain
[30:56] as they could be sitting right there
[30:57] that picture to see look see what it was
[30:59] It's Time same about day or two before
[31:02] day or two after I up there now look
[31:04] where it was that
[31:06] Northeast of flag safe or Prescott which
[31:09] is below flag safe well that's just
[31:11] where we
[31:12] at just exactly 26 miles high while
[31:16] Vapor can't go over over four four miles
[31:20] high or five moisture any kind of fog or
[31:23] anything you see planes flying 19,000
[31:27] has to get above all the clouds you see
[31:28] in 19,000 is about 4 MI high this is 26
[31:32] Mi high and 30 Mi across it and in the
[31:34] shape of the
[31:36] pyramid if you've looked at the picture
[31:38] and on the right hand side as I told you
[31:40] I noticed outstanding that angel there
[31:42] he is chest out Wings back coming right
[31:45] in just exactly the way it was I never
[31:47] know where s when it first there been so
[31:50] many things as and coming down the road
[31:52] the other day there was something
[31:54] happened that's spoke to me about
[31:57] the thing that I I must do and it's uh
[32:01] it's not my message one time Leo Mercer
[32:05] said said brother brand the time will
[32:08] come after this said about five or six
[32:10] years ago maybe seven said the Lord go
[32:13] to change your ministry brother Brandman
[32:14] said when he does said you'll probably
[32:16] just line up hospitals and speak them
[32:19] out of the the beds and things it didn't
[32:23] sound right although I believe brother
[32:24] Leo was trying to be sincere about it
[32:26] but it didn't down just right because
[32:28] see our lord Jesus never did that see
[32:31] and he went into the
[32:32] hospitals there was one in that hospital
[32:35] do you remember what is that in the
[32:36] Bible the pool of Bethesda great
[32:39] multitudes of of important people laid
[32:43] there lame blind withered
[32:45] waiting for the angel now that was in a
[32:49] spiritual
[32:50] hospital where people waited on Divine
[32:53] Healing and you hear the Divine healer
[32:55] himself came in and heal one walked
[32:58] out so you couldn't expect a martal man
[33:01] or a Ministry to come forth to be any
[33:02] greater than that was see I couldn't
[33:05] agree with it but as I started turn
[33:07] around the Holy Spirit come up me I
[33:10] asked Leo for a pen I got a piece of
[33:12] paper and I wrote it it's in his trailer
[33:13] today if you ever reports that it's that
[33:15] old luminum trailer where he had the
[33:17] loading outfit just as you go IND door
[33:19] the shelf on the right hand side right
[33:20] in front of the trailer laying under
[33:21] there I laid up there said someday you
[33:23] can pull this out God will never change
[33:26] the Ministry but he'll change the man
[33:28] with the
[33:30] ministry that's what's to be
[33:34] done see I I know what I've got to do
[33:37] but I I I can't I can't do it in the
[33:40] condition that I am now because I've got
[33:44] to something's got to happen within me
[33:46] that'll take God to do
[33:48] it we're a to go back home kids are
[33:52] homesick all them want to go back so I'm
[33:55] figuring on taking them back Lord will
[33:57] maybe after service
[33:58] Saturday and uh so uh go back from there
[34:04] I don't
[34:05] know but I know as soon as that
[34:07] something happens within me to make me
[34:11] feel towards
[34:12] people different from what I do now I
[34:15] had rejected the the people see and I I
[34:19] didn't want to have no more to do with
[34:21] them you know what I mean what I call
[34:23] Ricky and
[34:24] ricketta they had the things that they
[34:26] had did I preached with all the
[34:28] sincerity and God had confirmed it in
[34:30] every way and if they didn't want to
[34:31] believe it well let them alone then I
[34:34] was going to join up with
[34:36] bud it's coming fall start outfitting up
[34:40] there wait in the wilderness let my hair
[34:43] and beards grow out and if the Lord BN
[34:45] me go where he send me a word and I go
[34:47] down and do it and on the road coming
[34:49] down the other day he stop
[34:52] me and I seen where the what of was
[34:55] coming to um I'm on my road to something
[34:59] else now and I thought when I got home
[35:01] I'd make what we call a heart-to-heart
[35:03] talk maybe put it on tape and then uh so
[35:08] the public would see why the sudden
[35:11] change
[35:13] now you kids let's just uh let's have a
[35:17] little word of prayer Lord
[35:21] Jesus we are grateful for this time to
[35:26] know that we're assembled here the young
[35:28] and
[35:29] old and the
[35:32] middle-aged and we have
[35:34] assembled this side of
[35:37] Eternity once more to speak about you
[35:40] and about the things that pertains to
[35:44] everlasting
[35:46] life these young ones sitting in here
[35:50] tonight some of them are graduating some
[35:53] is already
[35:55] graduated but I realized Lord something
[35:59] had
[36:00] happened just a few hours before that
[36:02] great shock or great blast had taken
[36:05] place in the mountain up there north of
[36:09] Tucson when the angels of the Lord came
[36:12] down I remember what was said and
[36:16] especially about the young
[36:18] people I pray the Lord help us to
[36:22] understand and may I be able to say
[36:25] something to these young folks tonight
[36:26] that'll help them along the journey for
[36:29] Lord we all need that help at this time
[36:33] bless us together forgive our sins and
[36:35] if anything that we've done since we've
[36:37] been out here that's displeased you we
[36:39] pray you forgive us for it for we
[36:42] realize
[36:44] today that we have no no guarantee of
[36:49] Tomorrow we don't know what tomorrow
[36:51] brings we must be prepared today to meet
[36:55] tomorrow and father God there's only one
[36:58] way that we know to do this that's to
[37:00] prepare to see you for by and by we
[37:03] realize that we are all going to do it
[37:06] and we've got to meet it
[37:08] sometime either in peace as a friend or
[37:12] child or as an enemy far be it Lord that
[37:15] we be anything else but your own beloved
[37:18] children Grant these things we ask in
[37:20] Jesus name
[37:23] amen today while I was chopping weeds
[37:25] really early this morning I found a
[37:27] place in the Bible I thought would be a
[37:28] good thing to
[37:30] read at this time and it's uh may not be
[37:35] too dashing appropriate but I thought
[37:38] this for just a just a few minutes to
[37:40] talk I'm going to read this out of 18th
[37:43] chapter of St Luke all four gospel
[37:46] writers write of it the 18th chapter and
[37:48] the 18th
[37:50] verse and a certain ruler asked him
[37:53] saying good Master what shall I do to
[37:55] inherit eternal life life and Jesus said
[37:57] unto him why callest thou me
[38:00] good none is good save one that is God
[38:05] th knowest the Commandments do not
[38:07] commit adultery do not kill do not steal
[38:11] do not bear false witness honor thy
[38:14] father and
[38:16] mother he said all these have I done and
[38:19] kept them from my youth
[38:21] up now when Jesus heard these things he
[38:25] said unto him
[38:27] yet lackest thou one thing sell all thou
[38:31] has and
[38:32] distribute unto the poor thou shall have
[38:35] Treasures in
[38:37] Heaven come follow
[38:41] me I think the word come follow
[38:45] me that' be the best advice I could give
[38:48] if I was talking to 10,000 kids or if I
[38:51] was talking to just what I am it's a
[38:54] command and the greatest thing that I
[38:57] think was ever offered anybody and
[38:59] especially a young
[39:01] person follow
[39:03] me you're going to follow
[39:06] somebody uh you just can remember that
[39:08] you're going to follow
[39:10] somebody and the way you follow the
[39:13] person be sure that who this person's
[39:17] following see we Paul one time said be
[39:21] followers of me as I am of Christ in
[39:23] other words just as I follow Christ you
[39:24] follow me
[39:28] and now at this turning point this this
[39:31] stage of life where we all come and many
[39:35] times you've heard me holler Ricky Retta
[39:37] and things that it's the age it's the
[39:40] age that we're living in it really isn't
[39:43] those
[39:44] people those people are people like we
[39:46] are those kids out here these hot rods
[39:49] running up down the street and carrying
[39:51] all the way they are smoking cigarettes
[39:53] and drinking liquor girls dressed in
[39:55] morly and them girls and boys like we
[39:58] are see they're human they love they eat
[40:01] they drink they sleep they breathe they
[40:05] got to die they're people just like we
[40:09] are and yet they have been uh they've
[40:13] been possessed of an evil spirit they
[40:15] don't know
[40:16] it not because of of the people but
[40:19] because sometimes some leader that
[40:21] they've been following have leted him in
[40:23] the wrong
[40:24] road now you girls and boys no better
[40:26] than that you know you've been taught
[40:28] better than that's got better parents
[40:30] Sounder training than to do a thing like
[40:33] that you know
[40:34] better but they don't see because the
[40:37] churches that they go to uh are modern
[40:40] churches modernistic and they they just
[40:42] live for the day more poer and all my
[40:45] heart's the morals become virtue to them
[40:48] see so they what is it said one time in
[40:52] a play that I seen down here not long
[40:54] ago of Solomon Gomorrah that
[40:58] uh evil possessed woman said to to lot
[41:02] what you call imor I call
[41:06] virtue Jesus said as it was in the days
[41:08] of Noah so will it be at the coming of
[41:10] the son of man so we're back to that
[41:12] place
[41:13] again let's look at this fell for a few
[41:15] minutes that we read
[41:17] about no doubt that this kid was born in
[41:20] a good
[41:21] home like you kids
[41:24] are he's brought up with good parents
[41:27] because it proved it when Jesus uh
[41:30] presented to him the Commandments of God
[41:31] he said I've kept the since a youth it
[41:34] showed that he had he had been he' been
[41:37] brought
[41:38] ight he wasn't just a snatch out and you
[41:42] know he had been brought up to know what
[41:44] kids like you all are probably come up
[41:47] under a God-fearing Mother and Daddy to
[41:49] tr to to teach him right when he was a
[41:52] kid well that's good maybe it's a a
[41:55] little baby his mother uh had high
[41:58] Ambitions of him being a great man
[42:00] someday his father's worth money that
[42:02] could School him and and get him an
[42:05] education that he could he'd come out
[42:07] with a good education to be able to be
[42:09] something in the
[42:11] world and with the sincerity of this
[42:13] mother and
[42:15] dad uh educating this
[42:18] kid and perhaps come to his graduation
[42:22] time like you are see the time that he
[42:24] passed through school had his
[42:28] education no doubt perhaps was the pride
[42:31] and joy of of that mother and daddy's
[42:34] life no doubt in them days he had a fine
[42:38] horses like you have
[42:41] automobiles a good dad mother like you
[42:43] all got that ceas to eat you got good
[42:45] clothes and and a car and can just enjoy
[42:50] life just something like you have
[42:53] today and the father and mother with the
[42:56] praying constantly that that their son
[42:58] would not turn out just an ordinary man
[43:00] that he'd be an extraordinary man all
[43:03] parents want that did you hear Jesus
[43:06] refer to that commandment honor the
[43:07] father and mother and
[43:11] stop and that's the ambition of any
[43:14] parent to do the best for their children
[43:15] to can educate them give them things
[43:18] maybe they wasn't able to get that's
[43:21] what I feel about my children I think
[43:24] sometime in going to school
[43:26] now I think send Becky and Sarah and
[43:29] Joseph into these high schools and
[43:30] things where all this go on at I think
[43:34] I'll take them and get back into the
[43:35] mountain and and raise them up there if
[43:38] they let the Indians live but here's
[43:41] what it is what's the end the kids going
[43:44] to come
[43:45] out no matter where it is it's got It's
[43:48] going to come out if it's evil in there
[43:50] it will come out in the Indian Camp if
[43:53] it's good in there it'll come out in any
[43:55] Camp see see it's what's in the kid the
[43:57] makeup of the
[43:59] kid what's on the inside of you and what
[44:02] you are now is what you're probably be
[44:04] the rest of your life you're on the
[44:05] changing spot do you know
[44:08] one 86% of the conversions to Jesus
[44:12] Christ is done before 21 years
[44:15] old shows the statistic shows it 86%
[44:19] that come to Christ come before they're
[44:21] 21 you as you pass that age you become
[44:25] more molded or set in your ways well
[44:28] it's possible sure they come 70 80 years
[44:30] old but it's very rare that you make
[44:33] yourself when you're young you set your
[44:35] Ambitions to what you want to do and
[44:38] what you're trying to achieve in life
[44:40] you think of it and as you think of
[44:43] course your mind it's presented into
[44:45] your mind by an unknown something that
[44:48] it dominates your mind and then when it
[44:50] becomes in your mind then you speak it
[44:52] that you're going to do it then your
[44:53] Ambitions drive you to
[44:54] it so mother and father expecting this
[44:58] young man to his Ambitions to be great
[45:03] enough money to Carri it
[45:04] out and then no doubt prayed that this
[45:08] this young lad would would get that
[45:11] opportunity you see they they had done
[45:13] all they could
[45:14] do he maybe having fine horses and and
[45:18] maybe he's very popular among of women
[45:20] and if what would go for a man would be
[45:21] for a woman vice versa see because we're
[45:24] taught by human life Souls both men and
[45:29] women and then after all this
[45:32] opportunity the boy had see he become on
[45:34] easy street we call it on a place where
[45:37] he he didn't have to worry about too
[45:39] much his parents had money he had he has
[45:43] very he become a
[45:45] ruler the Bible refers to it here the as
[45:49] a Young Rich Young
[45:52] Ruler and we see at a young age Maybe in
[45:56] his teenage just out of school just out
[45:58] of graduation maybe a few weeks before
[46:00] or something he become a he's a
[46:04] ruler and uh he had all that Hearts
[46:07] could desire and the boy wasn't no
[46:10] modern Ricky he's a fine
[46:13] kid I believe when Luke wrote about it
[46:15] or Mark I believe it was Jesus looked at
[46:18] him inside because he loved
[46:21] him there's something about the kid
[46:23] there was a nice personality hook with
[46:26] his kid where did he come from out of a
[46:28] nice family who had taught him the
[46:30] Commandments of God and SE that he kept
[46:32] them and he did it from his youth up and
[46:35] the boy had an ambition he wanted
[46:37] eternal life he said a good Master what
[46:40] could I do to inherit eternal
[46:43] life see with all you got in the world
[46:46] yet the Soul on the inside of it tells
[46:48] you there's something that you need that
[46:50] you're having got just by wealth or it
[46:53] always had to be wealth it could be po
[46:54] or some pretty girl she's got her beauty
[46:57] that she can think of maybe she's very
[46:59] popper in school maybe the boy can get
[47:00] any girl he wants he feels it he's kind
[47:02] of secured that's not security it'll
[47:06] fade just like the flower in the field
[47:08] See it'll go won't be long just a few
[47:11] turns the sun that's gone then you got a
[47:13] soul that has to live
[47:16] eternally and this young kid must had a
[47:18] nice personality because he presented
[47:21] himself to the Lord Jesus name he bowed
[47:23] upon his knee he said good Master What
[47:25] could I do to have eternal life he said
[47:28] why do you call me good said when you
[47:30] know there's only one good and that's
[47:31] God see what the young man expressing
[47:34] this that he was God
[47:36] see he said you thou know it's the
[47:39] Commandments keep them said say said
[47:41] what Commandments Master he said the
[47:43] Commandments of honor the father and
[47:45] mother and so forth he said this I've
[47:47] done from the youth up see I've did this
[47:50] he said yet you're liking one thing go
[47:52] sell what you have and distribute to the
[47:54] poor and follow
[47:56] me what an opportunity that could have
[47:59] been Peter James or John in the ram see
[48:03] the kid have been trained and brought
[48:05] upright and been presented to Christ to
[48:10] use him and all the potential that he
[48:13] had in him to use probably
[48:15] educated Young Rich influenc where he
[48:20] could have presented the gospel and yet
[48:23] turned it
[48:24] down what a
[48:26] what a rational thing that was for that
[48:28] young boy see follow me I see he had to
[48:33] follow someone now he had to either
[48:34] follow the influence of the people he's
[48:37] associated
[48:38] with the influence of some young
[48:41] lady the some influence of a gang of
[48:44] boys that he has associated with his
[48:46] colleagues in
[48:47] school or follow Jesus
[48:51] Christ and all of his goodness yet he
[48:53] knew he didn't have eternal life
[48:57] kids that's what you got to think about
[48:58] see now look at the boy tonight what he
[49:01] could have been and what he
[49:04] is what he is tonight he's somewhere he
[49:07] was a man he he's somewhere he's waiting
[49:09] a judgment he's waiting to face the
[49:13] Judgment at that day turning down the
[49:16] same opportunities presented to you kids
[49:19] almost under the same
[49:21] circumstance fine kids good personality
[49:25] find fathers and mothers what you have
[49:28] don't even have to workless you want
[49:32] to
[49:34] see but there's something else that goes
[49:37] with that and something goes with that
[49:40] that word tonight Never
[49:43] Dies it's still a challenge to every
[49:45] young man every young woman follow me
[49:49] see words don't die whenever you speak
[49:52] anything you just remember whether it's
[49:54] in your car in the secret
[49:56] whether it's in the Pulpit whether it's
[49:58] down the street corner with your
[49:59] boyfriend or girlfriend wherever it is
[50:02] it never
[50:04] dies it's it's got to live
[50:08] forever I seen that girl that I other
[50:11] night in the
[50:12] vision young pretty girl a Hollywood
[50:17] actress and I've seen her dying reaching
[50:20] trying to get the help and she died in a
[50:23] heart attack Miss Monro
[50:27] and then that's been two years ago and I
[50:30] seen her
[50:31] D and two days later she did
[50:34] die and then the other night I heard
[50:37] that girl's
[50:38] voice how the kids have been telling me
[50:42] Daddy you go down that River no return
[50:44] all the time said they got a play like
[50:46] that on tonight they told me a certain
[50:48] night it would be on a week or two ahead
[50:50] of time and I thought well I want to see
[50:53] that cuz I've been down that River two
[50:55] or three times about five times I think
[50:57] but I I went to see it in this mman Ro
[51:00] acted that out well that was the girl I
[51:02] saw in the vision and there she was in
[51:06] picture and the actions the very act
[51:09] that she made on the River of No Return
[51:10] she talk that picture
[51:12] perhaps 15 years ago an old picture
[51:16] maybe 20 years ago and she's been dead
[51:19] two years and There She is again
[51:22] alive every action and every word
[51:28] see it's still so caught in Magnetic
[51:32] Tape until it's alive
[51:35] again not only that but everything that
[51:38] we say is alive every word that we speak
[51:40] cannot die coming through the room is
[51:43] words now forms of people television
[51:46] picks it up you speak right here and
[51:48] then hear you around the world that same
[51:49] second even before you can hear it in
[51:51] this room it goes around the world by
[51:54] electronic
[51:56] and God's Great screen picks that up and
[52:00] every move and every act that you make
[52:02] you've got to me it at the Judgment see
[52:06] so young fell it's a good thing to stop
[52:11] think about these things see because
[52:12] you're going to meet it
[52:14] again let's trace this young man the
[52:16] opportunity he had and put yourself in
[52:19] his
[52:20] place and a girl this same as this Becky
[52:23] and
[52:24] Maryland
[52:25] just like just the same as you stand in
[52:28] his place and you can hear that voice
[52:30] which is still
[52:32] alive it's still alive it's still moving
[52:34] science says in 20 years now they pick
[52:36] up his literal voice that he spoke 2,000
[52:39] years ago it's still alive like a pebble
[52:41] dropped in the ocean the wave never
[52:44] ceases it goes to the shore thousands of
[52:47] miles and turns back when a voice is
[52:50] once spoke into the air like that it
[52:52] never
[52:53] dies there ain't nothing you said to
[52:55] judge judement is right there there will
[52:56] be the voice of Jesus Christ bidding
[52:59] that young man follow
[53:01] me and him turning away on the screen
[53:05] sorrowful because he had great
[53:08] possession see we might not be always
[53:11] has to be money it can be other things
[53:13] see anything we hold dear than we do
[53:16] that call see it becomes lack of money
[53:19] to us it becomes something that corrupts
[53:22] us now let's follow him a little bit
[53:25] what happens when he turns away he
[53:27] didn't listen to that voice of Christ he
[53:29] went with his friends which you kids
[53:33] you're all fine kids and you're bound to
[53:35] have friends but watch what kind of
[53:37] friend you have if that friend's
[53:40] fallowing Christ go with that friend
[53:42] follow Christ to but if it don't don't
[53:44] do it let's look at him we find out he
[53:48] perhaps kept his friends he become a
[53:49] great ruler he was a ruler then later we
[53:52] find him so prosperous on until he he
[53:56] had to build extra barns to put his
[53:59] stuff in and then he said to himself
[54:01] after he got old and the cares of young
[54:04] life and things has passed all he done
[54:05] maybe was
[54:07] entertain when an old man an old woman
[54:10] like
[54:11] me my wife your mother's and dad there
[54:15] isn't hardly anything that they can
[54:17] think of they can't don't want to get
[54:18] out and and run up and down the streets
[54:20] you know it's young fellas would and
[54:22] young women dates and who's going to be
[54:24] your wife for your husband or see they
[54:27] don't have that in their mind they they
[54:28] got children they're interested that's
[54:30] going to be you all tomorrow if there is
[54:33] a
[54:35] tomorrow and uh see the fellow then with
[54:39] maybe maybe he never even got
[54:43] married and however he was a great ruler
[54:46] and he set up on and his is in Jerusalem
[54:48] yet the day they eat on the housetop
[54:50] this time of day when it get cool out
[54:53] the evening and we we find another
[54:55] character pictured with him a beggar and
[54:59] the man from being
[55:01] raised uh to honor the neighbor and do
[55:06] unto others as have others to do unto
[55:08] you see by rejecting that call of Christ
[55:11] finally look like a boy been raised in a
[55:13] home like that that would never got away
[55:14] from him but it
[55:16] did it did and there laid a man at the
[55:20] gate by the name of Lazarus begging him
[55:22] for food and vainly he would have eat
[55:25] the crumbs that he swept off not even to
[55:27] the beggar but to the
[55:30] dogs and was full of sores but the man
[55:33] had been so Polished in society then he
[55:36] had no more feelings he become numb
[55:38] because he' rejected that offer of
[55:42] Christ and maybe one evening this time
[55:44] making his toast with Fine Wines and
[55:47] lovely women's jeweled around him and
[55:49] things like that with all his Hearts
[55:50] could desire and toting a bler laying at
[55:53] the gate and before daylight Dawn the
[55:56] next morning he was in Hell screaming
[55:58] for that Lazarus to come put water on
[56:00] his
[56:01] tongue the Chang of the
[56:04] scene and you notice when he said Father
[56:08] Abraham now he still remembered that
[56:11] Abraham was the father of the Jews he
[56:13] said Father Abraham sand that beggar
[56:16] Lazarus down here's a little water on
[56:18] his fingers to put on my lips these
[56:20] Flames are tormenting and he said uh and
[56:24] Abraham said I can't do that in so many
[56:27] words and besides all this you see you
[56:31] had your opportunity in
[56:33] life when did he have it when Jesus said
[56:36] follow
[56:37] me but he turned it down he went the way
[56:41] that he can make money and that's all
[56:42] right nothing wrong with making money
[56:44] but follow Jesus while you're doing it
[56:46] see and he went the other way with the
[56:49] crowd and you find out he said and
[56:52] Abraham said and besides all this he's a
[56:54] go fixed between you and
[56:57] he that no man has ever crossed over and
[57:01] never
[57:02] will then that are there cannot come
[57:04] here and these here cannot go there it's
[57:06] been fixed no man has crossed or will
[57:09] cross then listen that he he wants to be
[57:12] an evangelist then the call that Jesus
[57:15] had given him to to follow him had and
[57:18] to be a soul in her as a Young Man
[57:21] returned to him
[57:23] again he remember remembered it that he
[57:26] had five
[57:27] brothers and back on Earth and he didn't
[57:30] want them in that place he said send
[57:33] Lazarus then back to tell my brothers
[57:36] not to come this way in other words
[57:39] except the call of follow
[57:43] me but he said they they won't do it he
[57:47] said yes if one would raise the dead
[57:49] like Lazarus and go back and tell him
[57:51] you see it shows that after we die
[57:54] you're still con ious he remembered
[57:56] Abraham said Son remember in your
[57:59] days see you still remember you don't
[58:02] lose your memory you remember and the
[58:05] memories that man could have and still
[58:07] in the same place remember the
[58:11] opportunity he had of hearing Jesus say
[58:13] follow me but he followed the wrong
[58:16] person the wrong crowd he got in the
[58:18] wrong crowd and went to the wrong place
[58:21] end up in the wrong eternity be
[58:25] annihilated at that day from God
[58:29] forever Jesus also said a great striking
[58:32] word though one rais from the dead and
[58:34] go back yet they would not be persuaded
[58:37] because they've got Moses in the law and
[58:39] if they won't hear that then they won't
[58:42] you're though one would be raised from
[58:45] the dead they will not be
[58:46] persuaded why why did the law speak
[58:50] something like that yes do to others as
[58:52] you have them do unto you and he had
[58:54] lived under the law law but he let the
[58:56] beggar die at the gate see he he lived
[58:59] under the Commandments of God and yet
[59:01] failed to see that great eternal life
[59:04] kids each one seem like
[59:07] mine you each one seem like this my sons
[59:10] and daughters in one way you
[59:12] are spiritually
[59:15] speaking that's right the Lord God has
[59:18] has put your souls into my care because
[59:21] you come listen to me you believe me see
[59:24] and in one sense words you are my sons
[59:26] and
[59:27] daughters that's
[59:30] right always
[59:32] remember keeping the Commandments of God
[59:34] is a great thing being raised in a good
[59:37] home is a Heritage from
[59:41] God and to be fine kids with
[59:44] personalities as you have good wonderful
[59:48] to have an
[59:49] education it's a wonderful even live in
[59:51] this free land we got a many things to
[59:54] be thankful far but there's one thing
[59:57] that you just don't
[59:59] inherit you've got to accept
[1:00:01] it that's eternal life and you only do
[1:00:05] that by following Jesus by a born again
[1:00:09] experience don't neglect that a little
[1:00:13] story one time I heard of a man who all
[1:00:17] he was poor and he he always wanted to
[1:00:21] it's a little fairy story like always
[1:00:23] stuck with me though
[1:00:25] and one day he picked a flower and the
[1:00:27] flower was magic and the flower answered
[1:00:31] to him and said you've been poor all
[1:00:33] your life he said now
[1:00:36] um ask what you will and it'll be given
[1:00:40] to you he said that yonder's mountain
[1:00:42] would open up and I could go there
[1:00:44] in and find the gold in the mountain
[1:00:50] well the he said you will have to take
[1:00:52] me with you wherever you go
[1:00:55] see you'll have to take me with
[1:00:58] you so wherever I
[1:01:01] am then you can ask what you will he
[1:01:04] walked to the mountain and the mountain
[1:01:06] opened up and he went into shells was
[1:01:08] full of gold and diamonds as a little
[1:01:11] fairy story goes he laid the flower down
[1:01:14] on a on a table or a rock and he run and
[1:01:17] grabbed the great big
[1:01:19] gy and he said I must go show this to my
[1:01:24] friend friends and now I'm a rich man I
[1:01:26] have everything now I'm going show this
[1:01:30] and so the flower spoke that said you
[1:01:33] have forgot the main thing so he runs
[1:01:37] back and picks up said well uh maybe
[1:01:39] I'll I'll get a piece of gold I get a
[1:01:41] piece of
[1:01:43] silver and so he said uh I'll I'll hurry
[1:01:47] out to tell the people how rich I am
[1:01:50] what all I've got and he got to the door
[1:01:54] and the flower said but you forgot the
[1:01:57] main thing so he runs back again he said
[1:02:00] in here we find all kinds of materials
[1:02:02] so he picked up a stone he said I'll go
[1:02:06] take this Stone and show the people what
[1:02:08] kind of a stone this Mountain's made out
[1:02:09] of so I can find my way back to it see
[1:02:12] and he started out the door and the
[1:02:13] flower said for the it's final time you
[1:02:17] have forgot the main thing oh he said oh
[1:02:20] shut up see he didn't want to hear it
[1:02:23] anymore forgot the the main thing and he
[1:02:25] ran out the door and when he did the
[1:02:28] door closed behind him with the flower
[1:02:30] on the
[1:02:31] inside the main thing was the
[1:02:34] flower see the main thing was the flower
[1:02:38] years ago as a kid as you all
[1:02:42] are here cattle range above here those
[1:02:46] genix I was reading a piece of the
[1:02:48] prospect a paper about a prospector then
[1:02:51] there was no roads to here then this
[1:02:52] little sand path they still do a lot of
[1:02:55] prospecting in here you know but this
[1:02:57] prospector had come in and he found a
[1:03:00] lot of money and he struck a lot of gold
[1:03:03] and on his Road in he stayed in a cabin
[1:03:05] he' found and he had a dog with him and
[1:03:09] uh the dog tied up on the outside and
[1:03:13] that night had been an outlaw following
[1:03:16] him to get this skull he picked it up no
[1:03:19] Spanish mind and he was um coming in
[1:03:23] with it and uh the dog started barking
[1:03:26] and the man didn't want to be bothered
[1:03:28] with that dog he said uh shut
[1:03:32] up he said tomorrow I'll take this into
[1:03:35] to the city and morals the story was
[1:03:38] this and I'll have it uh weighed up and
[1:03:43] I'll be a rich man and I'll buy great
[1:03:45] cars and I'll have all kinds of women
[1:03:48] and big parties and I'll be a rich man
[1:03:52] because I've already struck the the
[1:03:54] claim I've got the gold here much of it
[1:03:57] and said ah and while he was trying to
[1:04:00] go to sleep the dog kept barking because
[1:04:02] the dog
[1:04:04] seen the outlaw coming up spping up
[1:04:07] waiting for the prospector to go to
[1:04:09] sleep he raised up again and screamed at
[1:04:11] the dog again said shut up and the poor
[1:04:14] dog whined and tried to warn his master
[1:04:18] the danger waser
[1:04:20] lurking and when he the next time when
[1:04:23] the dog started barking the prospector
[1:04:26] had a shotgun he didn't want to be
[1:04:27] bothered so he just raised up and shot
[1:04:29] the
[1:04:31] dog and the prospector was killed that
[1:04:34] night by The Outlaw all of his fancy
[1:04:37] dreams done him no good why he still the
[1:04:41] voice that was warning him there's
[1:04:44] nobody can try to do anything your kids
[1:04:48] would never be able to do anything wrong
[1:04:50] after being raised the way you are
[1:04:52] unless you feel something tell you not
[1:04:54] to do
[1:04:55] it I don't never steal that voice that's
[1:05:00] warning and always remember except that
[1:05:02] voice that
[1:05:04] said follow
[1:05:06] me and you'll always come out right I
[1:05:10] believe you will I got confidence in you
[1:05:12] but just always remember at Jesus that
[1:05:15] voice is alive in the Earth tonight just
[1:05:18] the same as every voice every word we
[1:05:21] spoke is still alive when that voice
[1:05:23] goes on that ether wave of the air see
[1:05:27] you got a transmitter here that sends it
[1:05:29] out you are the transmitter that sends
[1:05:31] it out now it takes a station to pick it
[1:05:34] up and Jesus was a transmitter of God's
[1:05:37] word for he was the the trunity of God
[1:05:44] manifested in one man he was complete
[1:05:47] God and complete man in the Trinity of
[1:05:50] God the Trinity of the attributes of God
[1:05:54] God as being Father Son and Holy Spirit
[1:05:56] was represented in that one man Jesus
[1:05:58] Christ so there he was the
[1:06:00] word and he was the transmitter that
[1:06:03] said he that heareth my
[1:06:06] words and believeth on him that sent me
[1:06:08] has eternal life
[1:06:10] see verely I say unto you he that
[1:06:14] heareth my words and believeth on him
[1:06:15] that sent me hath eternal life now that
[1:06:19] words went out from a
[1:06:20] transmitter he said one day verely I
[1:06:23] send if you say to this mountain be
[1:06:25] moved and don't doubt in your heart but
[1:06:27] believe that what you have said will
[1:06:28] come to pass you can have what you said
[1:06:31] now if you can just be the station to
[1:06:34] pick that up by the some control inside
[1:06:39] of you by faith it'll move you right
[1:06:42] into the cycle of God to the new birth
[1:06:44] and be born again then you'll always be
[1:06:46] in contact to hear that voice that'll
[1:06:49] always warn you when dangers along when
[1:06:51] things are wrong going wrong it'll
[1:06:52] always be a warning to you
[1:06:54] and then instead of someday being like
[1:06:57] that rich young boy that we're speaking
[1:06:59] of be a man like Apostle Peter Paul or
[1:07:03] somebody that one souls for Jesus Christ
[1:07:06] you do that kids can we pray Lord
[1:07:12] Jesus youth men and women for tomorrow
[1:07:16] if there is a tomorrow we must train
[1:07:18] them Lord we feel that burden to train
[1:07:21] them like there will be a tomorrow if
[1:07:25] there is not then today is the
[1:07:28] day and then father we
[1:07:31] know that no one is accepted in your
[1:07:35] sight no flesh can Glory no education
[1:07:40] although as good as these things may be
[1:07:42] no good works no religious institution
[1:07:46] no
[1:07:47] psychology no nothing can confirm God
[1:07:52] but the Holy Spirit he's the instrument
[1:07:55] God himself in a form of eternal
[1:07:59] life that can come to us as an
[1:08:02] individual we are thankful for This
[1:08:05] truly is expressed when Peter made the
[1:08:08] confession and Jesus said to flesh and
[1:08:11] blood has not revealed this to you you
[1:08:13] never learned it in a seminary you never
[1:08:15] learned it in some school it's a
[1:08:17] personal thing something that each
[1:08:20] individual has to receive you set up on

[1:08:26] Gates of Hell will not be able to
[1:08:28] overcome it we're thankful for that Lord

[1:08:33] there are still post outposts listening
[1:08:36] posts receiving stations of faith that
[1:08:39] can accepted we pray that each one of
[1:08:41] these children will receive that Lord in
[1:08:44] their hearts and remember that not what
[1:08:47] they do to be good but they God does not
[1:08:50] judge us by what we do but by what we
