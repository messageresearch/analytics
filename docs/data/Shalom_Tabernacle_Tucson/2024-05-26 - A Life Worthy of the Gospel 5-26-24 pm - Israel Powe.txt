your word to our hearts Lord we are not worthy but you're worthy and we thank you for giving us the opportunity to hear from you one more time oh God we lay oursel at your feet this evening and ask for your kindness and mercy to be shed upon us once again Lord not as we deserve it Lord but as we need it in our lives may you grant it father bless each one Bless The Young Ones the old ones alike the saints that are on their streaming or that get the service however they receive it Lord may you bless the hearer we pray in Jesus name we ask it father amen amen God bless each of you so good to be in the house of the Lord with you this evening amen we have a scripture in Matthew chapter 23 we' like to turn to chapter 22 if you would stand for the reading of the word I appreciate you Saints maybe it sounded like you wasn't with me this morning but you wasn't as bad as it sounded you were right with me someone someone normally will send me a text about that's not here they'll text and say my they were were they helping you out but they you know you Saints are there pooling I know that praise the Lord um so Matthew chapter 22 verse 8 this is portion of what we uh got into this morning brother random takes Luke chapter 14 and he reads that completely and we read a portion of it this morning we're going to take Matthew chapter 22 two the kingdom verse two the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain King which made a marriage for his son he sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden behold I have prepared my dinner my oxen my fatales and killed and all things my fatling are killed and all things are ready come unto the marriage but they made light of it went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandise and the remnant took his servants and in treated them spitefully and slew them but when the king heard thereof he was wroth he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers burned up their City then said he to his servants the wedding is ready but they which were bidden were not worthy go ye therefore into the highways and as many as ye shall find bid to the marriage that's where we are today going into the highways let's pray Lord Jesus we ask your blessings upon this service committed into your hands now the reading of your word we thank you for the songs that have gone forth Lord we ask your blessings now your presence to come the angel of the Lord to accompany each belever believer to give them what they have need of spiritually we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated A Life That's worthy of the Gospel the title of the message tonight A Life That's worthy of the gospel God bless you Sister hope good to see you and each of you God bless each of your life that's worthy of the Gospel now what brother bam does is he uh is taking his text from Matthew chapter 22 but he reads Luke chapter 14 in reference to this and I just pray you'll just hang right with me tonight and uh stay with me on this just for a few moments but there's these two um recordings of this marriage invitation now the reason I believe he uses these two he's he's reading from Luke but his title really comes out of Matthew chapter 22 that we read here tonight the wedding is ready but they which were bidden were not worthy and if you take your Bibles and turn into Luke Chapter uh 14 just for a moment and actually it's in the message is your life worthy of the Gospel paragraph number 31 brother randomist says now turn in your Bibles to the book of St Luke and we'll start at the 14th chapter and he goes down there and it says there and so the servant came and showed his Lord all these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant notice it's not servants servant so brother Brandon brings out he takes the pl plurality of servants and he notes the scripture that it says servant singular and I think he does that for a purpose and that's where you can read in between the lines okay and so there's many of those places like that I can't tell you what it means but I know that he noted that and he continues on in paragraph number 32 and he says this here now did you notice there was three pools or three turns of it when they went out first and and called them or bidden to come they didn't do it so there went out a healing campaign went out to get the Blind and the Halt and still there were room so he went out and compelled the good bad and indifferent they should come in so The Good the Bad and indifferent were sent out under the third pool the third call brother Brandon brings it out takes this scripture and brings out the three pulls he goes a little bit further and this life is your life worthy of the gospel and says this in paragraph number 309 praise the Lord now him speaking directly to Israel the ones that was called To The Feast no I'm sorry you see let's see uh paragraph 51 sorry he says he bid three times three times he sent out and they did not listen to The Feast then he sent out again and he said go and compel those people to come the table has got to be set the table is ready there is still room so we know when we talking about the first second and third polls we know that's directly uh brother Brandon's Ministry how many knows that now I can't preach this in the Baptist Church and I've spoken for them a number of times and the Pentecostal denominational churches they wouldn't know what I was talking about for me to say first pool second pull third pool but those of us who follow the message know what that is and um and so let's touch that just a little bit and then we'll get into um this life that is worthy of the gospel now just a little background on the third pull it is first brought up in the message now for us who follow the message the third pull was first given in 1956 January the 1 in the message why people are so tossed about and then the last time that he SP he speaks about it is in 1965 I believe it's what is the attraction on the mountain so this is 8 years 7 months8 and a half years portion of time that brother Ram is referring to the third pool and here this scripture the New Testament um a parable that Matthew records and also Luke Rec records brother Brandon brings that in a type now and shows us that there were three calls or three pulls that Israel the nation of Israel was bidden to come to a spiritual feast and then he fast forwards it over into history not just Israel he includes Russia he includes England and he includes America right in this message is your life worthy of the Gospel beautiful message go back and read it what it does is it takes these new testament Parables and brings them the life to present day truth if you follow the message and believe the message if you believe brother bam message is true then these Parables how he opens or reveals them that's what a prophet does he's a revealer of the word and brings out the spiritual application of that Parable it's not just for Israel it meant for Israel yes then he brings out that it was to Russia and then he talked about England and then he says America and those three nations all rejected the spiritual feast or the call to come to this feast and in rejecting that they all end up in ruins the mo morality speaking moral wise this is the answer as to why the people have lost their minds morally speaking today not just you know not just a man is weak or a woman is weak and they live under the lust of the flesh but we're talking about lawmakers we're talking about college degrees educated people Leaders with a direct agenda trying to pour this down the people of this nation and make it force it upon us and this is a reality that we have to deal with and there's a reason for that and the reason for it is that they have rejected did the spiritual Feast that they was brought to this spiritual Feast is the feast that you and I have been called to that's why we're so fat spiritually speaking all fat and buttered up spiritually speaking because we've been eating on the fruits of canaan's land glory amen we can't walk around here all starved our rib cage showing spiritually like we ain't got nothing to eat we're solid we thank God for it our praise and worship service we don't have a piano we don't have an organ we still know how to praise the Lord don't we some people get mad they leave we still keep going on don't we why is it because we're better than someone else no it's the feast that we've been called to it makes us different we praise different we worship different we read our Bible on purpose we read it differently and we are grateful and we're thankful for it aren't you now look at it like that we have been called to a spiritual Feast now brother brandom talks about this third pool and we'll uh just bring it in just slowly and quickly at the same time all right let's look at the third pool as a spiritual Feast let's look at it as the promise land as the Old Testament Hebrews come out of Israel they come out of Egypt Israel came out of Egypt going to this promised land they had something to look forward to these were promises that were given Israel No Other Nation had it they didn't have those things to look forward to a pillar of fire something leading them at nighttime Mana coming down from heaven quailes just showing up out of nowhere who what other Nation had that going on the people that was following the prophet Moses had all these Supernatural things taking place in their life they wasn't worthy of it but God gave it to them anyway amen and that promised land is a promise so September of 1962 brother vam takes the message entitles it the present stage of my Ministry and this is what he says in par number 16 and remember this is 1962 he had already talked about what the third pool Vision was in 1956 okay so here's 62 and he says this here and so far as I know that every Vision that he's ever given me has been fulfilled except the one that I'm a change in my Ministry to where I'm to pray for people in a little place like a little room under a tent hallelujah or a big Auditorium or something it looked to me like a tent you remember don't let nobody tell you something else now he said it looked to me like a tent remember that two or three years ago most all of it was brought to pass I was to go down into Mexico and how it would rain that night and what would take place down there and he told me my Ministry of the first pool remember about catching the little bitty fish or missing it second one was a smallfish but then he told me on the third pool don't fail see and don't tell people so these Visions continue on and then a year later 1963 at the end of the year he had already preached the seals Angel of the Lord accompanied him with all the happenings in saino Canyon sunset Mountain and the commission to go back and bring forth the the greatest the greatest uh Ministry the greatest message of his ministry was bringing those Seven Seals here he is at the end of that year in the message Look Away to Jesus December and he says this here I have come to a place in my Ministry to where I've got to say something and I Jesus said it that what he heard that was what he spoke he Saidi called you my friends and a friend tells his friends all things so brother Ram is now continuing on in this message in paragraph 38 and he says this here and this is rather lengthly I just want you to get it though and he says so now I'm going to say something to you now that I haven't said all along and that is the thing that we've looked for to for so long for at least many years four or five years maybe longer the third pull has now been Vindicated and I'm sure you all know what it is now remember there'll never be an impersonation of that Hallelujah that's a amen point for everybody I'm like thank you Lord because the prophet somebody say well this is the third pool that's the third pool if it ain't the prophet if it ain't a quotation from the prophet then who's talking where' it come from who's speaking the prophet said there will never be an in an impersonation of that huh yes sir yes so nice because it can't be see it cannot be now it's in existence and I I am warned of this that soon right at this time now it's just happened so it could identify its presence among you see but it will not be used in a great way until this Council begins to tighten up and when it does when that does the Pentecostals and so forth can almost impersonate anything can be done but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifested in the fullness of his power see see you know let me say this Saints I have to be now when I listen to this Look Away to Jesus and I hear that I've got to be responsible and relay that to the people that I'm preaching to now in in listening to any preacher or any news broadcast or whoever you feed or whatever you feed upon on it's not just the things that they are telling you it's the things they are not telling you exactly right yes the things that are covered up and hidden on purpose like brother why didn't you read I was listening to this message and I'm going to get to where I'm going I was listening to this message here just from this group they sent out this text this link and they they put in part of the quote and thank God I had been listening to the message myself I had studied through it and I thought man that quote it didn't seem like it finished just right so I I logged on and got into the message myself and sure enough they got most of the quote but they cut it off on purpose and then bring in the full balance of the quotes now who's doing that who's in charge of doing a thing like that who's got a problem with reading all the quotes a true Minister a true Pastor a true brother Christian wants to hear everything he said about it am I right about it saying am everything he says about it it should be valid and for us to to go forward and so he continues here and he says now I must continue in evangelism just as I was commissioned first I must continue on therefore you've had the word you know what to look for how to stand I must continue on in evangelism and friends of mine keep still and just keep moving on for the power is approaching swiftly see that when something is going to be done now you might see some little odd things happen for for me nothing sinful I don't mean that but I mean something odd to what the regular Trend because where I reach to now in the ministry I'm dropping back here watching that spot and waiting for the time to use it but it's going to be used and everyone knows that for as certain as the first was identified so as the second been identified and if you think real closely you who are spiritual as the Bible says here's to him that has wisdom the third is properly identified we know where it is so the third pool is here it's so sacred that I mustn't say much about it as he told me in the beginning said said this say nothing of it you remember that years ago it speaks for itself I've tried to explain the others and I made a mistake this will be the thing that to my opinion I don't say the Lord tells me this this will be the thing that will start the rapturing faith for the going away I must lay quiet for just a little while now remember and you listening to this t you might see such a change in my ministry right now dropping back not going up dropping back we're right at the age now and it can't be can't go any further we have to wait just a minute until this happens over here to catch up then the time comes but it's thoroughly identified there is coming a Time upon in this nation to where this nation is going to exercise all the power that the Beast had before it which was Pagan Rome when it become Papa roome see that this nation will do that Revelations 13 plainly explains it the lamb will come up out of the Earth the other beasts come out of the water thickness multitudes of people this lamb come up where there was no people a lamb represents religion the Lamb of God remember it spoke like a lamb it was a lamb then after a while received power and spoke like a dragon and exercised the dragon power the dragon had power the dragon had before him and the dragon is Rome always so don't you see Roman denomination a mark Protestant denomination an image unto the beast making a power that will force all Protestants like a union you have to be in this Council of churches or you won't be able to have Fellowship amen well it's practically that way now how many can say Amen to that oh yeah it's czy you can't go to church and preach unless you have a fellowship card or some identification now on persones like ourselves we're going to be cut out all of that all together that's exactly because they won't be able to do it it's tightening and then when that time comes and the Press comes to a place where you're pressed out then watch what I'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third pull then see and it'll be absolutely to the total loss but it will be for the bride and the church now we are closer yes than seems to be I don't know when but it's real real close I may be building a platform for somebody else to step on I may be taken before that time I don't know and that time may be this coming week the holy spirit will come and bring Christ Jesus he may come this next week he may come yet tonight I don't know when he'll come he doesn't tell us that but I do believe that we are so close that I would never die with old age yet at 54 years old I'll never die with old age until he's here see unless I'm shot killed or some other someway killed just old age wouldn't kill me how many you know old age did not kill him all right let the word preach just old age wouldn't kill me until he comes and I'll believe that I I want to say this I've never said it before but according to the scripture according to what he said 33 years ago 33 years ago on the river down there in 1933 rather what he said everything has happened just exactly I may not do it but this message will introduce Jesus Christ to the world so I thought oh my I'm so happy right now I thought I thought when I thought we need to stop preaching the message and start preaching Jesus this message is what's going to introduce who Jesus Christ is see don't let nobody fool you Saints and don't get your eyes off the prize and don't let people change the rules to the game The Prophet brings the Mysteries and the pastors preachers teachers evangelist everybody else are supposed to repeat what he already brought us so I'm not ashamed of that and I Know It carves us out into a corner now because it's becoming more and more popular to disassociate yourself with these kind of statements but I'm not ashamed of it actually I thank God for them because God recorded it on purpose and this identifies who really believes every word amen every word the True Believer believes that and as it t get on and get more it's going to tighten even further it's going to squeeze us out even further but these are the things that prepare our hearts for the Rapture and the coming of the lord it's going to happen there will be a third pool manifestation he said so amen I know it will the message will he says I but this message will introduce Jesus Christ to the world as John the Baptist was sent to forun the first coming so is the message to forerun the second coming and John said Behold the Lamb of God that takes with the sin of the world see so it's paralleled in every way and I know it will the message will go on now in this message is your life worthy of the Gospel brother branon makes this statement in there and I never caught it I heard the message several times but brother Jim Dalton we were fellowshipping one day and he started quoting some things out of this message pastor Pastor Dalton up in flagy and he made the statement because brother man was talking about that life is not worthy of the Gospel a pastor that would not preach on these things that life is not worthy of the gospel and then brother Dalton says in he also says people that put up with it their life is not worthy of the Gospel I said whoa I never heard that but then I I went through the message uh sometime later and I've always highlighted it because it really stood out to me and the prophet of God is dealing with this and I'll just pick it up in paragraph 189 and he says this here are you blessed paragraph 189 he says this here is your life worthy of the Gospel beautiful message go back and hear it go read it listen to it digest it become one with it inhale it Hallelujah breathe it in that's what my had a uh uh he taught algebra Iranian guy or Arabic guy says you need to go ingustice and inhale it and internalize it breathe it make it become your breath I'm like I can't get the equation you need to eat it he tell me ingest it and make it become part of your life we talking about a math equation that's what he was talking about that's what I'm telling you to do with this message all right all right paragraph 189 the people of this day are a bunch of neurotics the people of this day are a bunch of neurotics they are afraid to take the promises of God churchmen Church organizations Church organizations are afraid to take the challenge of God's scripture for this day they realize they realize that their modern condition and their social gospel that they preach will not meet the challenge of this hour no more than Samson could meet it in his condition it took God and here is the program that promised it I'll get to it in just a moment paragraph 192 though they call themselves Christians they love to hold to the Creeds their Creeds all the Creeds institutes institutes and fulfills the thinking of the modern people of this day and a man that's going to be a success in this day has to go with the Modern Trend of thinking let me say that good and clear see a man if you're going to be a success you have to go with the modern thinking of this day they go around and say oh isn't he a darling isn't he wonderful he can just stay there so straight he never keeps us over 15 minutes and our pastor don't always ball us out about these things shame on that Pastor any man that can stand in the pull pit and look upon the sin of this day and not cry out there is something wrong with that man he's not worthy of the Gospel that he claims to be preaching that's right so by doing so they make themselves excuses now brother banam says that to be successful today you got to go with the Modern Trend of today so it's like pastors following other pastors churches following other churches and trends of what's the popular thing to do if you want to be successful quote unquote what they call successful but I thank God he's given us a message and he's given us a Divine call and he called us to to be a faithful servant to that calling and it might not be the most popular as we said before you know brother Brandon preached the message very clearly very open and it was very Unapologetic he wasn't rude or arrogant but you knew where he stood and nobody else is preaching it nobody else is taking that stand but he had to take that stand so you and I can have a clear clean message to preach on tonight and I thank God for it and that's what we're doing tonight amen oh my let's go a little bit further so he says shame on that Pastor he continues on and paragraph 194 said you see my denomination won't stand for that that's just as much a much as excuse I married a wife I brought a yok of box I don't care how many Doctor degrees you got and how much you looked up to by your nomination that sort of ministry it's not worthy of the Gospel that's wrote in this book right any church member here it is that asside in with such stuff as that and call themselves a Christian and go out here and live and the women bobbing their hair and wearing clothes that the Bible says for them not to men carrying on the way they're doing now a a form of godliness taking drinks and smoking cigars and marrying several times and becoming deacons of the church and even pastors and so forth and the people that put up with such as that that sort of life is not worthy of the Gospel it's pretty strong when you saying doesn't put it on the preacher it puts it on the people too that you allow it you put up with with it amen amen yes we want to take these things more serious than we do because we know we're at the end time we see the squeeze out there we see the laws changing before our eyes just the common attitude of of things that are decent and holy is just really squeezing us out the clean voices can't speak anymore and and and it's become harder to even just articulate these things even even amongst message people now becoming harder and the Bible said it would be that way but we want to be faithful don't we we wantan to we want our life to be worthy see God sent us something that nobody else has there there's no other message like this message nowhere they've tried to replicate they triy to impersonate they try to do whatever they can do there ain't nobody preaching a word like what we have on a recorded tape you could say he's dead you could say that old man is dead and that was years and years ago there is nobody preaching nothing that can compare to the message Glory from 1940s 50s 60s still there is no Ministry to compare to the Mysteries the signs the Wonders and the Miracles and then the devil would want me to be ashamed of that no this is my identification that's why I got a ministry that's why I'm in the lifeline is because of a message like this we're not ashamed of the Gospel no that's what's going to catch us up out of here that's our Rapture out of here the body change is in there the new name is in there the Capstone the ceiling is all in there rapturing Faith lays right in there come on Saints we're noten we're not ashamed of this gospel amen the modern churches do whatever they want to do yes sir we've been called to a spiritual Feast amen a third pool Feast yes that's why we act the way we act right now the call was to the compel to the hedges and highways that was the third pull first the first call was to come cuz all things are ready the second call was to get the poor the blind the Halt and there was a healing campaign the third was to the hedges and the highways just get anybody that will listen if it's a alley rat if it's a night rocker somebody you don't think is worthy bring it to them they might say Amen to it you did you said amen to it and that's the last call that's it that's it the the other groups it wasn't worthy they don't want it they don't care about it but I'm so glad that that bridegroom call came to the city of Sacramento one day found me on the South Side voiced itself to me and I accepted it with all of my heart and I thank God for it maybe there's one more out there in them Hedges and highways trailer park and those in the seven whatever neighborhood they in Rolling dice at the park wherever they doing go find them drop this message they ain't never seen or heard nothing like it drop this message on them and see what happens amen praise His name remember that Saints no one has what we have I saying that boastfully that's just a matter of fact no one has what we have we have the truth and we know the neonics are on the rise and we know this nation's going to turn and we know there'll be a great squeeze it's already happening now and the great Council of churches will turn on the people that believe these things but we know where to stand we know what to look for That's A Life That's worthy of the Gospel now let me close by saying this how do you get this life in you the only way that you can live a life that's worthy of the Gospel is to let the gospel itself come in you amen and that is this gospel that we're preaching and teaching to you we're talking about this bridegroom call that a serpent was sent out remember many are called but few are chosen and we have been called and chosen now in paragraph 264 the prophet of God says this here now the only way to live a life Worthy is to let Christ and his word which he is the word word reflect itself so perfect in you till God vindicates what he said in the word for Christ died that he might present himself before God a sacrifice and a return back in the form of the Holy Spirit to reflect him himself through his people to carry on his work reflecting himself through you to fulfill his promised word in these Future Days that's in the message is your life worthy of the Gospel okay let's take a scripture here quickly and we'll get that one more one more time here just before we close now just back to this this third pool oh my how did I do that back to this third pool now brother bandam asked this question and souls that are in prison now paragraph number 310 in and he says this if the first and second pool is without question is there a question in your mind about the first and second pool huh no questions right we know what it is did it come to pass just like he said I'm reading congregation says amen amen then why question the third well because Reverend so and so said it don't mean that Pastor Soo said this is what it means today somebody said we've turned the corner somebody said you know this is what we doing this is how we church now we don't even go to church we stay home and if we do go we can't say you know nothing about the prophet thank you son amen and if we do go we just got to talk about Jesus because if we start talking about brother bandam you're going to confuse people guess what they already confused everybody's confused you start talking about the message that's where the confusion leaves it's called a revelation a revelation removes the confusion and you need a revelation of what's going on today what's going on today Hallelujah a shout a voice a trump of God Jesus does all three it's the Rapture yes a shout a voice what's the shout the message Gathering the people together how you going to get in the Rapture if you miss the shout how you gonna get the voice if you miss the shout how you gonna get in the Rapture if you miss the great Archangel that was to come they try to make us be ashamed of that brother Ezekiel but no no we're not ashamed of it we're embracing it more reading more quotes brother brandom said I'm saying that more than never before brother you got stop saying no no no no you have your ministry I have mine I'm going to say brother Brandon said amen say the Apostle Paul said it Moses said it it's written in the Psalms David said it Jesus quoted the prophets all of the prophets quoted the other prophets and if you got a Ministry you hopefully you're quoting some kind of prophet amen amen all right let me move forward 2 Corinthians 11:13 and 15 the Bible says this gives us warning this is the Apostle Paul on Wednesday I brought to you 1 Timothy 4 about the doctrine of Devils but 2 Corinthians 11135 says for such are what is it we we'll get it up there for such are what so we have Apostles that are false amen yes Paul identifies them for such are false Apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transferred as the Ministers of righteousness who in shall be according to their Works amen now we know that the first pull second pool is without question and let's take this in souls in prison now brother banam says this if the first and second pool is without question is there a question in your mind about the first and second pool did it come to pass just like he said amen then why question the third see why would you question it the first two was identified by the scripture I Pro to you this morning that the third is identified by the scripture too look upon the world see where she's at look how they have rejected the truth how it's been properly identified The Prophecy part now where we at oh God be merciful that makes my heart bleed on the inside what about it where we at brother bam asked the question so now how do we get to live this life that's worthy of the Gospel so we see that there was three calls there was three pools that that becomes our our Feast that we Feast around he brings it to us that Russia England and America they rejected it but this is the final call the last call that the people today are going into this neurotic State the pastors that are not preaching the truth their life isn't worthy and the people that put up with it their life is not worthy of the Gospel but we are those who have heard the call we believe that call and we stand with it is that right Saints amen is your life worthy of the Gospel brother Ram says this two places and then we'll close amen now the only way paragraph 264 the only way to live a life Worthy is to let Christ and his word which he is the word reflect itself so perfect in you till God vindicates what he said in his word only way to live a life Worthy is to let Christ and his word which he is the word reflect itself so perfect in you till God vindicates what he said in the word for Christ died that he might might present himself before God a sacrifice and it returned back in the form of the Holy Spirit to reflect itself through his people to carry on his work reflecting himself through you to fulfill his promised word in these future days now is this word reflecting itself in you how are you becoming one with it are you enjoying what the benefits of it are you are you feasting on what he's given to us in this day he says it again in paragraph number 22 271 pray God to let the light of this day raise in you to be an obedient servant to God as we spoke this morning and then let the fruit of the spirit ever remain in your life and that is a life is worthy of the Gospel let me say this in closing the only way the only way that you can live a life that's worthy of the Gospel is let the gospel itself every bit of the Gospel come into you and reflect his promises back make them Vindicated let God live in you Amen to vindicate the promises of this day Hallelujah isn't that nice it's very very simple he said brother isra I don't understand it all we don't have to understand it all you just let the gospel of Christ live and reflect itself in you every promise you say Lord let the word reflect itself in me I'm it's just a teenager I'm a a little taller seven 10 years old I just be I'm a new Christian whatever it is I'm a minister I'm a whatever I am I'm a pastor I'm a Deacon or Elder Lord let the promises of this day reflect itself in me and then that is a life that's worthy of all these visions that were spoken that we have direct a access to Lord let that be my life worthy of the Gospel is that your prayer the musicians come musicians may come let this word manifest manifest itself in me amen thank you Lord amen bless his wonderful name amen oh my amen let's bow our heads word of prayer Lord Jesus thank you for your word tonight we thank you for this small reminder of the order of things how we're in this last day truth oh God I pray that you would make us convinced and then concerned about these things as I think about it Lord and as our hearts have Lord we've just tasted it it's so much to it and yet it seems like we don't catch it all but Lord we want to be faithful to the portion that you gave to us oh Lord please Grant it raise my respect for it higher than it's ever been before Lord on the other side those people raised up the prophet set him up because he was a leader on Earth and he asked the question will PA have to be judged say yes will he make it yes he says if Paul makes it I'll make it too because I preach what Paul preached and the millions they screamed out we're resting on that if you didn't go we wouldn't even be here they said oh Lord father they wasn't ashamed of the message over there why should they be ashamed of it over here Lord I'm determined more in my mind in my heart to be faithful Lord to go to the hedges and the highways and rather than argue with the Pharisee or sadducee or religious man over and over and over again to go to someone who's never heard it and present it to them Lord that's our desire may you grant that to our hearts we pray we ask in Jesus name as you continue to play that softly sis let me take one more quotation for you send the message convince and then concern brother brandom says this I gave it to you back there I refrained from reading it but I want to read it for you now came on my mind just three or four little paragraphs paragraph number 71 it says so but it looks like there's not enough concern I wonder why why isn't there a concern like there used to be it's I believe the reason that if there's not as much concern as there used to be they're not as convinced as they used to be you have to be convinced before you can be concerned not concerned you take the time now instead of evangelizing and trying to do something everybody wants a great big school or a great big something that they can teach and make ministers have better pullit manners and so forth you know what I believe I believe that the people is not convinced that Jesus is coming soon I don't believe that they're convinced that he's coming in this age and I believe that's the reason that they're not concerned because they're not fully convinced right they're not convinced that he's with them if they were they would come back to the word that's right now many people might misunderstand it but Lord help us to be convinced and then if we're convinced we'll be concerned God bless you richly amen let's sing that I will serve thee because I love the you you have G life to me I was
