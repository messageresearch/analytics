[0:39] [Music]
[0:59] Heat.
[1:11] Hallelujah.
[1:16] [Music]
[1:45] Heat. Heat.
[1:47] [Music]
[2:19] [Music]
[3:44] I will trust in you.
[3:51] Let the weak say I
[3:56] am strong
[3:58] in the strength
[4:01] of the Lord. I will trust in you.
[4:09] God bless you all. It's so good to see
[4:11] everyone this evening. Like to welcome
[4:13] you all out to the house of the Lord. If
[4:15] we could, let's all stand. Ask if um
[4:19] Brother Tim Robson, would you come and
[4:21] open the service up with a word of
[4:23] prayer?
[4:29] Jesus, Lord, Savior,
[4:33] thank you for keeping us safe throughout
[4:36] the day. Each and everyone, Lord, thank
[4:39] you for your blessings, Lord, for this
[4:41] building, for everything you've given
[4:42] us.
[4:44] Please help us be a light in the world,
[4:47] Lord, to spread the gospel wherever we
[4:49] go. Keep us in your will and bless the
[4:53] service be within each one, Lord, in
[4:56] Jesus name. Amen.
[5:00] Amen. I'd like to read a scripture
[5:02] before we before we praise him.
[5:06] In Luke 19:37-40,
[5:11] it says, "And when he was come nigh,
[5:14] even now at the descent of the Mount of
[5:16] Olives, the whole multitude of the
[5:18] disciples began to rejoice and praise
[5:20] God with a very loud voice. I like to
[5:23] imagine that they were just praising and
[5:25] worshiping him for all the mighty works
[5:27] that they had seen. I know I would have
[5:29] been pretty ecstatic and pretty man I
[5:33] can only imagine. But
[5:37] they
[5:39] so they began to rejoice and praise God
[5:41] with a loud voice for all the mighty
[5:43] works that they had seen, saying,
[5:44] "Blessed be the King that cometh in the
[5:46] name of the Lord. Peace in heaven and
[5:48] glory in the highest." And some of the
[5:50] Pharisees from among the multitude said
[5:52] unto them, Master, rebuke thy disciples.
[5:56] And when he answered, and said unto
[5:57] them, I tell you that if these should
[5:59] hold their peace, the stones would
[6:02] immediately cry out.
[6:04] So obviously tonight, that's not going
[6:07] to happen. We're going to praise him
[6:09] with a loud voice. We're going to make
[6:11] our love to him known. Amen.
[6:14] It's not by might
[6:17] nor by power,
[6:20] but by my spirit, says the Lord.
[6:26] It's not by might
[6:30] nor by power,
[6:33] but by my spirit, saith the Lord.
[6:39] For this mountain
[6:42] shall be removed.
[6:46] This mountain
[6:48] shall be removed.
[6:52] This mountain
[6:54] shall be removed.
[6:58] By my spirit
[7:00] say, you may be seated.
[7:04] It's not by might
[7:07] nor by power,
[7:10] but by my spirit, sayeth the Lord.
[7:17] It's not by might
[7:20] nor by power,
[7:23] but by my spirit, saith the Lord.
[7:28] [Music]
[7:30] This mountain
[7:32] shall be removed.
[7:36] This mountain
[7:38] shall be removed.
[7:42] This mountain
[7:45] shall be removed.
[7:48] By my spirit, saith saith the Lord.
[7:54] By my spirit saith the Lord.
[8:01] By my spirit saith the Lord.
[8:07] [Music]
[8:09] Amen. We're going to sing I shall not be
[8:12] moved. And last time we sang this, I did
[8:15] two verses then a chorus. Two verses and
[8:17] a chorus. And that kind of took a long
[8:18] time. So this time we're going to do
[8:21] three verses and a chorus. And hopefully
[8:24] we'll have a little bit more success
[8:27] with getting through that song
[8:29] so it's not so slow. So we'll start with
[8:32] the chorus, then we'll do one, two,
[8:34] three, and so on and so forth. Amen.
[8:37] I shall not be I shall not be moved.
[8:43] I shall not be I shall not be moved.
[8:48] Just like a tree that's planted by the
[8:52] water,
[8:55] I shall not be moved.
[9:02] Jesus is my savior. I shall not be
[9:06] moved.
[9:08] In his love and favor, I shall not be
[9:12] moved. Just like a tree that's planted
[9:16] by the water,
[9:20] I shall not be moved.
[9:26] And in my Christ abiding,
[9:30] I shall not be moved.
[9:33] In his love I'm hiding. I shall not be
[9:38] moved. Just like a tree that's planted
[9:42] by the water.
[9:46] I shall not be moved
[9:51] and I will trust him ever. I shall not
[9:56] be moved.
[9:58] He will fail me never. I shall not be
[10:03] moved. Just like a tree that's planted
[10:07] by the wall on earth.
[10:11] I shall not be moved.
[10:17] No, I shall not be I shall not be moved.
[10:24] I shall not be I shall not be moved.
[10:29] Just like a tree that's planted by the
[10:33] water,
[10:36] I shall not be moved.
[10:43] On his word I'm feeding.
[10:46] I shall not be moved.
[10:49] He's the one that's leading. I shall not
[10:53] be moved. Just like the tree that's
[10:57] planted by the water,
[11:02] I shall not be moved.
[11:08] And glory, hallelu,
[11:11] I shall not be moved.
[11:14] I'm good in Jehovah.
[11:18] I shall not be moved. Just like a tree
[11:22] that's planted by the water,
[11:27] I shall not be moved.
[11:33] And in his love of hiding, I shall not
[11:38] be moved.
[11:40] In him I put fighting. I shall not be
[11:45] moved. Just like a tree that's planted
[11:49] by the water.
[11:53] I shall not be moved.
[11:59] Oh, I shall not be I shall not be moved.
[12:06] I shall not be I shall not be moved.
[12:11] Just like a tree that's planted by the
[12:15] water,
[12:18] I shall not be moved.
[12:25] Though all hell assail me, I shall not
[12:29] be moved.
[12:31] Jesus will not fail. Amen. I shall not
[12:35] be moved. Just like a tree that planted
[12:40] by the water,
[12:44] I shall not be moved.
[12:50] And though the tempest rages, I shall
[12:54] not be moved.
[12:56] On the rock of ages, I shall not be
[13:01] moved. Just like a tree that's planted
[13:05] by the water.
[13:07] [Music]
[13:09] I shall not. Only one more verse with
[13:12] all your heart.
[13:15] And when my burdens heavy, I shall not
[13:20] be moved.
[13:22] When my burdens heavy, I shall not be
[13:26] moved. Just like a tree that's planted
[13:31] by the water.
[13:35] I shall not be moved.
[13:40] Oh, I shall not be I shall not be moved.
[13:48] I shall not be I shall not be moved.
[13:53] Just like a tree that's planted by a
[13:57] water,
[14:00] I shall not be moved.
[14:06] [Music]
[14:10] Amen. Amen.
[14:12] Let's go to the key of E.

[14:23] the king.

[15:39] Hallelu.

[15:46] Should there be any rivers we must
[15:51] cross, should there be any mountains, we
[15:56] must climb,
[16:00] God will supply
[16:03] all the strength that we need. Give us
[16:08] grace till we reach the other side.
[16:13] [Music]
[16:15] Soon and very soon we are going to see
[16:20] the king.
[16:23] Soon and very soon.
[16:29] It won't be long.

[16:43] Hallelu.
[16:45] Hallelu.
[16:47] Halleluah.

[16:54] [Music]
[16:56] And in the name of Jesus,
[16:59] in the name of Jesus,
[17:02] we have the victory.
[17:05] [Applause]
[17:07] Yes, we do. Oh, in the name of Jesus.
[17:12] In the name of Jesus,
[17:15] demons will have to flee.
[17:21] For when we come in the name of Jesus,
[17:29] tell me who can stand before
[17:35] in the precious
[17:39] name of Jesus.
[17:42] We have the victory.
[17:46] Let's sing that second verse.
[17:49] Tell me who can stand before us when we
[17:57] call on that great name.
[18:03] Jesus.
[18:04] Jesus.
[18:06] Precious
[18:08] Jesus.
[18:09] We have the victory
[18:13] [Music]
[18:16] in the name of Jesus.
[18:20] In the name of Jesus,
[18:23] we have the victory.
[18:28] [Music]
[18:30] Oh, in the name of Jesus.
[18:34] In the name of Jesus,
[18:37] demons will have to flee.
[18:44] When we come in the name of Jesus,
[18:50] tell me who can stand before.
[18:57] In the preious
[19:01] name of Jesus,
[19:04] we have the victory.
[19:07] [Music]
[19:14] I'd like to read a story behind a hymn
[19:16] if I could.
[19:19] In the garden was written in 1912 by C.
[19:22] Austin Miles, a former pharmacist who
[19:25] became a gospel songwriter. One day,
[19:27] while reading the account of Mary
[19:29] Magdalene visiting Jesus's tomb in John
[19:31] 20, Miles imagined the emotional moment
[19:35] when Mary encounters the risen Christ in
[19:37] the garden. Inspired by this intimate
[19:39] and powerful scene, he penned the lyrics
[19:41] and music for In the Garden in just a
[19:45] few hours. The hymn reflects the
[19:48] personal and tender relationship a
[19:49] believer can have with Jesus, like
[19:51] walking and talking with a close friend
[19:54] in a peaceful garden.
[19:58] Let's sing that.
[20:01] I come to the garden
[20:07] alone
[20:12] while the tomb
[20:15] is still fresh on the roses.
[20:23] And the voice
[20:25] I hear
[20:28] falling on.
[20:31] I hear
[20:34] the son
[20:36] of God
[20:39] discloses.
[20:41] [Music]
[20:45] He speaks
[20:47] and the sound of his voice
[20:55] is so sweet
[20:58] that the birds hush their singing.
[21:06] and the melo
[21:11] that he gave
[21:14] to me
[21:16] within
[21:19] my heart
[21:22] is real
[21:27] and
[21:29] he walks
[21:32] with me and He talks
[21:38] with me
[21:40] and he tells
[21:43] me that I am his own.
[21:47] [Music]
[21:51] And the joy
[21:54] we share
[21:56] as we tear
[21:59] [Music]
[22:00] there
[22:03] another
[22:05] has ever
[22:08] known.
[22:11] [Music]
[22:13] Let's all stand.
[22:24] Let's sing that song
[22:29] in the sweet by and by.
[22:36] Thank you.
[22:38] In the sweet.
[22:43] By and by,

[23:25] Amen.
[23:27] We shall meet
[23:30] on that very beautiful shore.
[23:36] Hallelujah.

[23:43] by and by.
[23:48] We shall meet
[23:50] on the beautiful
[23:54] shore. To our bountiful father above.
[23:58] To our bountiful
[24:01] father
[24:04] above.
[24:08] We will offer
[24:11] our dreams
[24:14] praise.
[24:18] for the glorious
[24:21] [Music]
[24:22] gift of his love.
[24:27] Hallelujah.
[24:29] And the blessing
[24:32] that horde
[24:35] our name.
[24:38] Oh, in the sweet

[25:17] shore.
[25:18] Amen. God bless you. What a wonderful
[25:22] day that will be when we will meet on
[25:25] that beautiful shore. Amen. God bless
[25:28] each of you. We welcome you to the house
[25:30] of the Lord. Tonight we have our good
[25:32] friend, Brother Bill Lingard, here with
[25:34] us. He slid on in here in the city of
[25:39] Tucant. He was speaking for brother Bob,
[25:41] I believe, last weekend. And uh he
[25:43] carved out a little bit of time to be
[25:45] with us tonight. He's on his way
[25:47] overseas, I believe, in the next few
[25:50] days, week or so. And so we're so happy
[25:53] to have him with us again. And we thank
[25:56] the Lord from him for him and his love
[25:59] for the word of God. He's a old sacri a
[26:02] Sacramento uh native. We come from the
[26:05] same city there and we're happy to have
[26:07] him. Ham's glad to have our brother with

[26:16] Amen. God bless you, brother Bill. Amen.

[29:37] gift of his
[29:42] we shall sing on that beautiful
[29:46] shore
[29:49] in that sweet
[29:53] by and by
[29:56] we shall be on that beautiful
[30:01] shore.
[30:04] Thank you musicians.
[30:06] God bless you tonight.
[30:09] I'm really happy to be here with my
[30:12] brother Israel
[30:14] and knowing how things go back in time.
[30:18] Thank you musicians.
[30:20] And brother Israel, what has he done for
[30:23] us?
[30:25] How has he changed us over time? How has
[30:27] he brought us to where we are tonight?
[30:30] Amen.
[30:32] Many dangers, many toils, many scenarios
[30:34] I have been through.
[30:37] But I thank the Lord Jesus
[30:39] for the grace of God, the power of his
[30:42] blood, the power of the Holy Ghost to
[30:45] take the voice of God, his prophet, and
[30:48] make it live in my life.
[30:51] I'm so thankful for that.
[30:54] Thank you, brother Israel, for the
[30:55] opportunity.
[30:57] I pray that this will bless you and help
[31:00] you to come closer to the Lord and one
[31:02] another.
[31:05] Yes. So, thank you. And uh I have uh two
[31:10] places for my main scriptures, but I'm
[31:12] going to read two scriptures out of
[31:14] James. You don't have to turn with him
[31:16] just so you're reminded of the
[31:19] terminology of the Bible. This isn't my
[31:22] terminology. This is his. And so the
[31:26] first one is uh they're both in James
[31:30] James chapter 2.
[31:32] If you fulfill the royal law,
[31:36] can you say royal law?
[31:38] If you fulfill the royal law according
[31:41] to the scripture, thou shalt love thy
[31:43] neighbor as thyself. We do well.
[31:47] Now, why would that be a royal law?
[31:49] Because no greater love has a man for
[31:53] his brother or his friend than to lay
[31:56] down his life. And the Lord Jesus Christ
[32:01] fulfilled the royal law.
[32:05] Okay? And then I'm going to read also
[32:07] right across the page in James the first
[32:11] chapter verse 25.
[32:14] Now, the royal law, and this just came
[32:18] to me within probably the last three
[32:20] months, the royal law made a way for the
[32:23] perfect law of liberty. The blood made a
[32:26] way for the power of the Holy Ghost.
[32:30] How many believe in the power of the
[32:32] Holy Ghost?
[32:34] Without the Holy Ghost, you don't have
[32:36] the power to live a Christian life.
[32:40] So right here it says, "But who so
[32:42] lookth into the perfect law of liberty
[32:47] and contin thereof, he being not a
[32:50] forgetful hearer, but a doer of the
[32:52] work, this man shall be blessed in his
[32:56] deed."
[32:59] And so what I'm coming to, and I'll just
[33:01] have you stand for just a very short
[33:04] while, two places for a subject tonight.
[33:08] My subject is love's viewpoint.
[33:12] Love's viewpoint. Your viewpoint is how
[33:16] you see things right or wrong.
[33:20] Would you agree? It's your perspective.
[33:23] And we want the right perspective to
[33:26] judge ourselves,
[33:28] the situation,
[33:30] and others.
[33:33] Right? We want that. We want the right
[33:35] perspective to judge ourselves,
[33:37] situations and others rightly
[33:41] because the right judgment
[33:45] is based on the right perspective.
[33:49] Okay? The right judgment is based on the
[33:52] right viewpoint.
[33:55] So we want love's viewpoint,
[33:58] the love of the Holy Spirit in our
[34:02] hearts.
[34:04] to give us his faith, his spiritual
[34:08] discernment
[34:09] by the word of the hour to judge
[34:13] righteously.
[34:15] That means to judge right.
[34:21] And so now we're coming to John chapter
[34:24] 7 and verse 24.
[34:27] And I remind you again, my subject is
[34:29] love's viewpoint. And I'm emphasizing to
[34:33] you and especially to me, I got three
[34:37] fingers pointing back at me. Am I
[34:40] justified? Am I sanctified? And am I
[34:43] filled with the Holy Ghost? Okay. And so
[34:47] our subject is love's viewpoint. And the
[34:50] emphasis is sound judgment is based on
[34:54] sound vision.
[34:58] Can I repeat it? Sound judgment is based
[35:01] on sound vision. The right judgment is
[35:05] based upon the right perspective.
[35:09] John 7 and verse 24.
[35:17] Judge not according to the appearance,
[35:20] but judge
[35:22] righteous
[35:24] judgment.
[35:26] How many would be your prayer? Lord, let
[35:30] me have love's viewpoint.
[35:34] Brother and sister, this is not just a
[35:36] sermon. This is a reality we must come
[35:40] to in this late hour because all the
[35:43] signs say he's coming.
[35:46] So, my hands up with you. Let us just
[35:49] pray. Heavenly Father, we want love's
[35:53] viewpoint. Help us tonight, Lord, to
[35:56] make it a reality in our life
[36:00] so that we can be so that we can our
[36:02] judgment will become sharper, right, and
[36:06] on time in Jesus name. Help my brother
[36:09] Israel, the deacons, the trustees, the
[36:12] musicians,
[36:14] and his people. May you become closer
[36:17] together in Jesus name. Amen. You may be
[36:20] seated.
[36:28] A fisherman don't have any hooks on his
[36:30] pulpit.
[36:35] Praise the Lord.
[36:39] Well, I thank the Lord Jesus.
[36:42] Jesus tells us to judge righteously,
[36:46] not by the sight of the natural man,
[36:49] because he looks at the outward
[36:50] appearance.
[36:52] And he also leans on the intellectual
[36:56] view of the word. He can't help it. See,
[37:00] he can't help it because he's not born
[37:02] again. All right? And so he looks on the
[37:06] outward appearance and it causes us to
[37:10] misjudge.
[37:14] But to judge righteously
[37:17] is to have the right viewpoint or
[37:20] perspective.
[37:21] Are we together? All right. I've been
[37:24] preaching with my brothers in Zambawi.
[37:27] See, and I learned from them.
[37:30] See, to judge righteously, you have to
[37:32] have the right viewpoint or perspective.
[37:36] And the only way you can have the right
[37:38] viewpoint or perspective is your heart
[37:41] has to be right.
[37:44] Your heart has to be right because you
[37:46] see through your heart.
[37:49] You see through the eyes of your heart,
[37:53] not the outward man. The heart controls
[37:56] you by the Holy Spirit through the blood
[38:00] according to the voice of the prophet.
[38:04] It controls you
[38:06] and and the Holy Spirit when he sees
[38:10] through your heart then he that's the
[38:13] love of God shed abroad in your heart by
[38:16] the Holy Ghost to give you love's
[38:19] perspective.
[38:24] Then in Matthew 7 1-5,
[38:29] that's the second major scripture I have
[38:31] or main scripture tonight.
[38:34] Jesus tells us how to judge righteously.
[38:39] And he tells us why it's so important to
[38:43] judge right.
[38:46] And the and and this is God Almighty.
[38:49] This is the Lord. I mean, who made all
[38:52] things and made all things for himself.
[38:54] He's not He doesn't use idol words.
[39:05] I just saw somebody I knew.
[39:08] Jesus tells us how to judge and why it's
[39:12] absolutely important to your eternal
[39:14] destination.
[39:16] Matthew 7 reads, "Judge not that ye be
[39:19] not judged." Now, here it sounds like
[39:21] don't judge.
[39:23] But when you look at the other
[39:24] scripture, Jesus is telling us, "Be
[39:27] careful how you judge."
[39:31] Okay? And he says this, "For with what
[39:34] judgment you judge, you shall be judged.
[39:39] And with what measure you meet, it'll be
[39:42] measured to you again.
[39:46] And then here's this parable.
[39:49] Why beholdest thou the moat that is in
[39:51] thy brother's eye, but considerth not
[39:54] the beam that is in thine own eye? In
[39:56] other words,
[39:59] why are you looking at the splinter
[40:01] that's in my eye
[40:04] and you're not first taking care of the
[40:06] log that is in your eye?
[40:10] See, the log in your eye is blinding you
[40:12] to your own condition.
[40:18] I'm preaching to myself.
[40:21] Okay? It blinds you to your own
[40:23] condition.
[40:25] So, how can you, excuse me, how can you
[40:26] help somebody else that has a splinter
[40:29] in their eye
[40:32] without first judging yourself by the
[40:35] royal law and according to the law of
[40:38] liberty
[40:41] so that your heart is clear and right
[40:44] with God so that you can project the
[40:46] right spirit
[40:49] to somebody else.
[40:52] Maybe I'll just read a quote right here.
[40:54] I I put it in here. I didn't know when
[40:56] I'd read it, but I'll read it.
[41:09] This is from the message 1954, seven
[41:12] church ages.
[41:16] Now, the modern church, which we call
[41:18] the denomination,
[41:22] we like to point at them.
[41:25] We call the denomination, we holiness
[41:27] people, you know, we call them the
[41:29] modern and they go out there and they
[41:31] start in their revival too. You say,
[41:35] you say they're not getting anywhere.
[41:38] But now wait just a minute.
[41:43] What have we got? Got nothing. No more
[41:46] than they got. That's exactly right. And
[41:48] as long as we fuss and stew and carry on
[41:52] among one another, we still walk as man.
[41:57] Until a man can get down at the altar
[42:02] altar
[42:04] and get right with God, till he can
[42:07] overlook little things.
[42:14] No, no, no. Grace is not wishy-washy.
[42:17] Grace has the power of the blood and the
[42:20] spirit to make a heart right.
[42:24] We ain't talking about wishy-washy
[42:26] religion.
[42:29] Get down at the altar, get right with
[42:31] God until he can overlook little things
[42:34] and move on like a Christian ought to
[42:36] be. Pot can't call KD black, right?
[42:39] Don't holler at them. Let's clean our
[42:42] own steps first.
[42:55] And so
[42:57] to judge right, you have to first pull
[42:59] the log out of your own eye before you
[43:02] can see clearly to remove that little
[43:04] splinter that's in my eye.
[43:10] And so we have to ask ourself the
[43:12] example he gave us.
[43:16] Do we want to be judged
[43:20] by the letter of the law
[43:24] that has no power
[43:28] to make things right? Has no power to
[43:31] change the heart?
[43:36] See, some of those situations you're in
[43:39] and you're praying for,
[43:42] you need the royal law and the and the
[43:45] perfect law of liberty, the Holy Ghost
[43:48] flowing through you to break that
[43:50] bondage.
[43:55] So I don't want to be judged
[43:59] by the law or the letter or the
[44:02] intellectual view of the message because
[44:04] it has no power to change me or you.
[44:12] I want to be judged by the grace of the
[44:13] Lord Jesus Christ.
[44:17] I want to be judged by the blood. That's
[44:19] the royal law.
[44:23] I want to be judged by the royal law
[44:25] because what does it do? By one
[44:27] offering, it made my heart perfect.
[44:32] Now, Satan doesn't agree with that. And
[44:34] Satan's going to try to tell you that.
[44:36] He was talking to me today about some
[44:39] things when I was a teenager, and I
[44:41] said, "I don't remember that."
[44:45] We got to get used to doing that. That's
[44:48] the word.
[44:52] No repenting for that. It's gone.
[44:56] God don't remember it.
[44:59] I make mistakes. Absolutely.
[45:01] Satan attacks you daily.
[45:06] And so
[45:08] by the royal law of the blood, he's
[45:10] judged our hearts perfect.
[45:14] He judged our hearts perfect.
[45:17] to release the Holy Spirit into us
[45:23] to manifest not just a perfect heart but
[45:27] the perfect life of the stature of a
[45:30] perfect man.
[45:35] Are we together?
[45:36] Yes, sir.
[45:39] You know, brother man preached the
[45:40] stature of man. Peter preached it. Paul
[45:42] preached it. Is it is it just a nice
[45:46] slogan like I'm Pentecostal or could we
[45:49] go on more? Is it just a slogan
[45:53] or is it a reality?
[46:04] So I in this age,
[46:07] the royal law of the blood of Jesus
[46:10] Christ laid down his life for his church
[46:14] so the Holy Spirit could manifest what
[46:17] he purchased,
[46:18] a bride in his image, a church in the
[46:21] stature of a perfect man.
[46:25] And then you try to show that God is
[46:28] showing you this by William, Mary, and
[46:31] Brandham. And I get a push back. You're
[46:33] making too much out of a man.
[46:37] They're bugs.
[46:40] They're Roman bugs.
[46:43] They either they they come on both
[46:45] sides. Okay. They make him something
[46:48] that he's not. And he preached on that
[46:51] in the bruised serpent as we used to
[46:53] know, right? You're making me Christ.
[46:55] I'm not. It's Antichrist.
[46:57] And then the other ones come on the
[46:59] other side, which is worse.
[47:01] He's just a man. And they start finding
[47:04] fault and they start doing what Dayan
[47:06] and Kora. They thought they were just
[47:07] messing with a man with Moses.
[47:14] But they weren't just messing with
[47:15] Moses. They were representing God's
[47:18] representative says, "I have come down
[47:21] to deliver them and I'm sending you God
[47:24] going in the form of a man. God's gift
[47:27] of deliverance to that generation.
[47:33] And so
[47:36] the truth is in the middle. Okay? So you
[47:40] don't have to wonder whether I'm over
[47:41] here or over there. I'm not over there.
[47:44] I'm in the middle.
[47:46] John the Baptist said, "There he is."
[47:51] But Malachi 4 said, "Here he is." And
[47:55] that's the difference. That's where the
[47:57] razor's edge is.
[48:02] Who manifested the stature of a perfect
[48:04] man?
[48:07] Hello?
[48:09] Who manifested it? Amos 3:7 says, "The
[48:13] Lord will do nothing
[48:15] until he first does it by his prophet."
[48:19] This is not the word only.
[48:22] This is the power and demonstration and
[48:24] the manifestation by this cloud that
[48:28] appeared outside of this city
[48:32] to vindicate
[48:34] the revelation
[48:36] that he wants you to have.
[48:42] I do get a little excited about it
[48:47] because every day out there alls I see
[48:50] is darkness. Alls I hear is darkness.
[48:53] All I hear is evil. Everywhere Satan's
[48:56] reminding you of evil. But when I hear
[48:58] the word, when I read the Bible, when I
[49:01] pray, God reminds me the work I started
[49:04] in you, I will finish it.
[49:10] So, I'm going to walk around with my
[49:12] head down. I ain't going to let the
[49:14] revival that started with me
[49:17] at the blood and the spirit, I ain't
[49:18] going to let it die.
[49:21] Well, aren't you groaning? Yeah, I'm
[49:22] groaning to keep it alive.
[49:31] All right.
[49:36] Who had the log in their eye and who had
[49:39] the splinter?
[49:42] Who had the law and who had the
[49:44] splinter? When the religious leaders
[49:47] under the law, they brought the woman
[49:49] taken in adultery.
[49:57] and a master.
[50:00] Moses said, the prophet said, the Messi
[50:04] said,
[50:08] right?
[50:09] Isn't that what we're dealing with?
[50:15] What do you say?
[50:17] You see, they were bringing her to him
[50:20] because they had the wrong perspective
[50:23] of his ministry.
[50:26] Why are you healing on the Sabbath? Why
[50:29] are you claiming you and God are one?
[50:33] God was showing them that the ministry
[50:36] was changing from the old ministry of
[50:38] law to the new ministry of grace.
[50:43] Because the old ministry of law had no
[50:45] power.
[50:49] So now
[50:51] they bring they bring her to him.
[50:56] and they say, "What? What do you say?"
[50:58] In other words, you know, they misjudged
[51:01] him because they had the wrong
[51:03] perspective. And now they were looking
[51:06] for another reason of indictment.
[51:11] And so the wisdom of God said, "Let him
[51:13] that has no sin cast the first stone."
[51:21] and he paused
[51:24] and they knew right there they weren't
[51:28] going any further.
[51:31] Right? Cuz guilty of the least is guilty
[51:34] of the whole.
[51:36] And so after they walked away,
[51:39] he said,"Woman, where's your accusers? I
[51:43] have none, Lord, neither do I."
[51:46] Who had the log and who had the
[51:49] splinter? They had the log. She had the
[51:52] splinter.
[51:54] They were blind to their own condition.
[51:57] They were blind to the ministry of the
[51:59] grace of almighty God that was right in
[52:01] their face.
[52:04] They were blind to it. And when they
[52:07] misjudged him because of the wrong
[52:09] perspective,
[52:11] they judged themselves.
[52:14] Come on now. unworthy of eternal life.
[52:19] Did not Paul say it in the book of Acts.
[52:25] You have judged yourself unworthy. Lo,
[52:28] return to the Gentiles.
[52:30] They had the log. They're selfrighteous.
[52:34] Moses said, the message said,
[52:38] blinded them to their own condition that
[52:42] they were a bunch of legalists that had
[52:45] no power.
[52:48] And she had a splinter.
[52:52] She knew she she had a she could see she
[52:54] was wrong. The splinter doesn't blind
[52:57] you. The splinter just You know what?
[53:00] She could She knew she was wrong.
[53:04] I knew I was wrong in the world,
[53:06] but I'd never met a man that had that
[53:09] power that could make a difference in my
[53:11] life.
[53:14] Could somebody say amen?
[53:18] That's the Jesus we're talking about
[53:20] tonight.
[53:22] That's the Christ that came down as a
[53:24] pillar of fire in this age
[53:28] and challenged the cold formal churches.
[53:31] And then the Pentecostals,
[53:34] the formal churches, they rejected the
[53:36] first pool. They didn't believe in them
[53:38] signs, wonders, and miracles, right? The
[53:40] Baptist minister.
[53:43] But the Pentecostals rejected the second
[53:46] pool. They blasphemed the sign of the
[53:49] Messiah because not not because he he
[53:52] wanted to rub his nose in him because he
[53:54] wanted to help them get right. He says
[53:57] speaking in tongues is not the evidence
[53:59] of the Holy Ghost. Sister, wash your
[54:01] face.
[54:02] Okay, brother, take your place. All
[54:05] these things. You see, but
[54:11] the leaders of Pentecost had a motive
[54:13] and objective.
[54:17] They had a position.
[54:19] They had money. They had popularity.
[54:22] And they weren't about to give it up.
[54:26] So they blasphemed the Lord Jesus.
[54:29] And now the third pool. So you see the
[54:31] Holy Ghost in the first pool, the Holy
[54:33] Ghost in the second pool, greater, a
[54:36] greater witness. It wasn't just a gift
[54:39] of knowledge, which it was, but God was
[54:41] showing, hey, this is the spirit of
[54:43] truth. And if I can tell you what you
[54:47] did, why you are, and what your future
[54:50] is, I can do the same thing with the
[54:53] word of God.
[54:54] And they blasphemed it. Now, here's the
[54:57] shocker. The third pool is the called
[54:59] out.
[55:01] The third pool is the called out.
[55:05] And how many of the called out made it
[55:08] from Egypt to Canaan? Two. So now the
[55:13] called out,
[55:18] what's their attitude?
[55:20] What's their Yes. Help us, Lord.
[55:29] I'm this, I'm that, I do this, I do
[55:32] that.
[55:34] It becomes a slogan.
[55:38] I don't want a slogan. I don't want a a
[55:41] a a large name. I'm a I'm a Pentecostal.
[55:44] I'm a Baptist. I I want a reality that I
[55:48] am a Christian. And you know it because
[55:50] you see the grace of God in my life and
[55:53] you can feel the love of God coming
[55:55] through. I understand where you are. I
[55:58] was there.
[56:09] And so you see what happened to the
[56:12] Israel, right?
[56:14] Because of the wrong perspective,
[56:17] self-righteous viewpoint, legalistic
[56:19] viewpoint, they misjudge the new
[56:23] ministry of grace.
[56:26] And it's repeating again
[56:28] with the seventh angel with his new
[56:31] ministry of the third pool which is the
[56:34] Holy Ghost coming down in perfection.
[56:41] Now I can't give you revelation. Brother
[56:44] Rel don't claim to give we don't claim
[56:45] to give revel. The only thing I can do
[56:47] is try to help you and point these out
[56:50] that you will go church the scripture
[56:52] and the message and pray about it. Say
[56:55] that brother's saying something. I see
[56:57] these dots. They're connecting. I don't
[56:59] quite get it yet. Get down on your knees
[57:02] and groan and pray and get serious with
[57:06] God. The hour is late and he is coming
[57:09] for a church that is in his image.
[57:18] And so now what have they done? The
[57:21] called out,
[57:23] whoever, you know, I got to take care of
[57:26] my doorstep. I'm part of the called out.
[57:31] But the called out are misjudging the
[57:34] new ministry of William, Mary, and
[57:36] Brandham.
[57:39] Why did God change his ministry from the
[57:41] old to new? The old ministry,
[57:44] it caught the attention of the bride,
[57:48] but it produced impersonators,
[57:52] right?
[57:54] Why didn't it produce impersonator?
[57:56] Instead of just believing he was sent to
[57:59] do the work for them, they wanted to do
[58:01] the same thing. Now, how simple can it
[58:04] be? Everything he said is just believe
[58:07] me.
[58:09] And I and I, you know, and he's
[58:11] explaining, well, you know, all the the
[58:13] Oral Roberts, they get more people
[58:16] prayed for and I'm getting criticized
[58:18] because I don't get as many through, but
[58:20] I have a different gift. And then I hear
[58:23] him say, "He's here." Okay. If I can
[58:26] pray for one and they're all and that
[58:28] one's healed, I can pray for 30,000 and
[58:32] 30,000 at one time can be healed if they
[58:35] would believe what he said. Amen.
[58:38] My my my
[58:40] Lord, open my eyes
[58:42] to what God has done for you and me.
[58:49] Sorry, I I'm just preaching from my
[58:51] heart. This all ain't in my notes.
[58:56] But can you see the parallel
[59:00] under the third pull? The Holy Ghost
[59:03] coming down in perfection in a prophet
[59:06] to rip off the seven seals and show us
[59:08] the perfect law of liberty manifested in
[59:12] the stature of a perfect man. It wasn't
[59:14] his flesh that was perfect. It was the
[59:17] Holy Ghost that was perfect.
[59:21] And what were that Holy Ghost trying to
[59:23] show us? That was the power ready for
[59:27] the changing of the bodies. How many
[59:29] times did he rehearse Abraham and Sarah?
[59:32] Abraham and Sarah. And he kept telling
[59:34] him, "I know you're choking. I know
[59:36] you're choking. I know that didn't go
[59:38] over."
[59:39] See,
[59:46] and so
[59:48] that's the next step, friends.
[59:53] The next step is the changing of the
[59:56] bodies.
[59:59] mortal to immortal, corruption to
[1:00:01] incorruption. And the word of God, the
[1:00:03] bi the messenger of the hour, he laid it
[1:00:06] out.
[1:00:09] But you got to be hungry
[1:00:11] to want to see it.
[1:00:14] He reveals himself to those who are
[1:00:18] looking for him.
[1:00:22] Yes. So Lord, help me. I don't want to
[1:00:27] have the wrong perspective of William
[1:00:29] Mary and Brandham's new ministry.
[1:00:33] Now you judge this statement.
[1:00:36] I believe I have enough sense and you
[1:00:38] can tell me if I'm wrong. Serely,
[1:00:41] I'm not I'm not trying to be arrogant or
[1:00:43] hottie,
[1:00:44] but I know I don't have the third pool.
[1:00:50] I didn't have a first pool.
[1:00:52] I didn't have a second pool.
[1:00:56] And the man that had the third pole had
[1:00:58] the fishing pole.
[1:01:00] And the And what he caught was the
[1:01:02] rainbow trout. And I'm happy to be
[1:01:05] caught.
[1:01:14] Brother Israel done lost time. I better
[1:01:16] get going here. I want to help you,
[1:01:18] brother and sister.
[1:01:21] I'm trying to conserve a little bit for
[1:01:22] Norway, but no. No. I going to conserve
[1:01:25] nothing. I'm just going to pray. Lord,
[1:01:28] strengthen me. And the brothers, they
[1:01:30] pray for me when I go. And the family,
[1:01:34] the hour is late.
[1:01:37] And so, I'm going to read to you now
[1:01:42] what he said
[1:01:46] about where we are in this hour.
[1:01:49] And so
[1:01:51] what what you want as a Christian is you
[1:01:55] want the Holy Spirit to give you the
[1:01:59] perspective you need when you hear this
[1:02:02] message and read the Bible.
[1:02:05] See, so you don't misjudge William
[1:02:08] Brandham's ministry.
[1:02:15] So this is from warning then judgment.
[1:02:19] He says, "Don't you love him? Think of
[1:02:21] what we are. Look how far up the road we
[1:02:24] are, friends. Just look back down the
[1:02:27] road from way down yonder in the days of
[1:02:29] Luther and Wesley and on down through
[1:02:31] the ages. Look, he keeps saying, look
[1:02:34] here where we're at. Right at the top of
[1:02:37] the pyramid.
[1:02:40] right here where God has proved it. That
[1:02:43] the Bible through the seven seals has
[1:02:46] perfectly been revealed,
[1:02:50] waiting only now for them seven
[1:02:52] mysteries right at last on the coming of
[1:02:55] the Lord and the rapture of the church
[1:02:57] that might happen before morning. Oh my.
[1:03:01] Now, I ain't going to preach on those
[1:03:03] seven mysteries,
[1:03:06] but we'll just stay with the seven
[1:03:08] seals. Okay? Now, I only said that to
[1:03:13] say this. You can't add to what he said,
[1:03:15] and you can't take away from what he
[1:03:17] said. Okay? Waiting only now, he said,
[1:03:21] for those seven mysteries on the coming
[1:03:23] of the Lord. That's good enough for me.
[1:03:27] Amen. That's good enough for me. Well,
[1:03:29] but other brothers, they put it together
[1:03:31] that way. That's their privilege.
[1:03:33] They're called out.
[1:03:36] But for me, I'm going to leave it just
[1:03:39] like he said. And I'm going to pray,
[1:03:42] "Lord, help me line it up. Give me the
[1:03:45] right perspective so I don't misjudge
[1:03:48] what he said."
[1:03:51] All right.
[1:04:01] And so where are we at church
[1:04:09] proven? Are we at the top of the
[1:04:11] pyramid?
[1:04:13] Were there seven mysteries in this
[1:04:15] pyramid?
[1:04:18] And is not this the capstone of love?
[1:04:21] So, how did we see this perspective or
[1:04:25] this viewpoint if it wasn't by the eagle
[1:04:28] eye in the cap
[1:04:31] breaking the seals to show the Holy
[1:04:34] Spirit standing in perfection right
[1:04:37] before you
[1:04:39] the perfect law of liberty by what? The
[1:04:43] blood of Jesus Christ. He paid for this.
[1:04:47] He died for this.
[1:04:51] Or do you maybe just want to stay back
[1:04:52] justified, sanctified, baptized the Holy
[1:04:54] Ghost, and then go to the grave? Is that
[1:04:56] what you want? I'm talking to myself.
[1:04:59] I I'm I'm just trying to You know what I
[1:05:01] mean? Just make it a little bit of a
[1:05:03] shock to you
[1:05:10] now this morning. See, so this is Mount
[1:05:13] Zion.
[1:05:15] We've gone to the top of Mount Zion,
[1:05:18] the pyramid mountain, the stature of a
[1:05:20] perfect man.
[1:05:23] And so this morning, I got up early
[1:05:26] and I said, I want to go back up Mount
[1:05:29] to top of Mount Lemon because I've been
[1:05:31] there once,
[1:05:33] you see, and it reminded me that along
[1:05:37] the way from the bottom to the top of
[1:05:39] the mountain, there's a lot of vista
[1:05:42] points.
[1:05:44] Vista point. What's a vista point? It's
[1:05:46] a viewpoint.
[1:05:48] And so at that particular vista point, I
[1:05:51] could see only that particular
[1:05:54] landscape.
[1:05:56] Is that true?
[1:05:58] But when I finally drove to the top,
[1:06:02] then you get a panoramic.
[1:06:05] Amen. You can see all the way around.
[1:06:09] And S is a complete circle of light that
[1:06:13] gives you a complete panoramic view of
[1:06:16] the Bible,
[1:06:18] not as a theology,
[1:06:20] but as the stature of a man made
[1:06:23] perfect.
[1:06:27] And so then when I got up to the top, I
[1:06:29] was reading all the signs all the way. I
[1:06:31] took my time. I was honestly I was
[1:06:34] reading the signs, studying and learning
[1:06:36] a lot.
[1:06:38] And then when I get to the top,
[1:06:41] I learned
[1:06:44] that there's actually four different
[1:06:49] ecological and geological zones from the
[1:06:52] bottom to the top.
[1:06:55] But you got to go on the top to find
[1:06:57] that.
[1:06:59] Ain't that amazing?
[1:07:01] And so in the natural right going up the
[1:07:04] road there a lot of a lot of scriptural
[1:07:06] perspectives a lot of scriptural
[1:07:08] perspectives but the reality that
[1:07:10] brother Brandham gave us
[1:07:12] is there's four is there's four you know
[1:07:16] uh uh viewpoints from the bottom to the
[1:07:19] top but in the natural the first was the
[1:07:22] sonoran desert it's beautiful those
[1:07:25] soros and swirl national park when you
[1:07:28] start is absolutely majestic
[1:07:32] And then the second level was what they
[1:07:35] call the oak woodland
[1:07:38] and it's at 5,000 ft.
[1:07:41] The third level
[1:07:45] was what they called the ponderosa
[1:07:48] forest.
[1:07:49] It was at 7,000 ft. One, two, three.
[1:07:56] Okay. And the fourth level, which was on
[1:07:59] the top, was at 8,000 feet.
[1:08:03] And they called it the mixed conifer. It
[1:08:06] had the the the quaking asp and the
[1:08:09] Douglas fur.
[1:08:12] I thought, my,
[1:08:14] that's just exactly
[1:08:16] justification, Luther's view.
[1:08:19] sanctification, Wesley's view of the
[1:08:21] scripture, baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:08:24] the Pentecostal view, and right at the
[1:08:27] top of the mountain on the eighth part,
[1:08:30] Elijah, the eagle eye in the capstone is
[1:08:34] giving us a panoramic view of God's
[1:08:38] letter of divine love.
[1:08:49] I I could have been shouting.
[1:08:52] I I could have been doing my own little
[1:08:54] jig,
[1:08:56] but I conserved my energy for tonight.
[1:09:01] Now, you hear brother Bam preaching all
[1:09:03] the time and he all he'll go to nature.
[1:09:05] He'll go to show what God showed him in
[1:09:06] nature and he'll bring it right out.
[1:09:09] And so,
[1:09:11] we can see it. You're privileged.
[1:09:15] You're living in the capstone age to see
[1:09:18] by God's eagle eye love's viewpoint.
[1:09:23] The complete revelation of God's great
[1:09:26] mystery of love that started in Jesus
[1:09:29] Christ the royal law to lay his life
[1:09:33] down to produce the blood. So at this
[1:09:36] day, the Holy Spirit could come down in
[1:09:39] perfection
[1:09:41] and show you the perfect law of liberty.
[1:09:44] A man totally set free.
[1:09:52] Praise the Lord.
[1:09:54] God has done great things.
[1:09:57] And then to hear people, well, he was
[1:10:00] just a man and he was this. To me,
[1:10:02] that's Dayan and Corora's anointing. Get
[1:10:06] away from it.
[1:10:11] Brother Brandham is our brother. Brother
[1:10:14] Brham is a part of the bride.
[1:10:17] What part is he? He's the eye in the
[1:10:20] body.
[1:10:22] And if the eye has light, the body has
[1:10:25] light. You take the eye out and I'll
[1:10:28] guarantee you the light will go out that
[1:10:30] you had in your life.
[1:10:33] All right.
[1:10:37] So,
[1:10:41] let me read another quote here and then
[1:10:43] I'll hurry. Try to hurry. So, Christ the
[1:10:46] mystery of God revealed. Where are we
[1:10:48] at? The top of the pyramid.
[1:10:53] Okay. And Christ the mystery of God
[1:10:55] revealed. So he says this is God's great
[1:10:57] mystery of love expressed
[1:11:01] that God and man became one.
[1:11:06] The whole thing is God and man one. God
[1:11:09] and man was one there and God and man is
[1:11:14] one here.
[1:11:18] So when you take the pictures out,
[1:11:21] here's the royal law. He laid his life
[1:11:24] down.
[1:11:26] Okay, so let's read the quote. So that
[1:11:28] the Holy Ghost could come down in this
[1:11:30] day
[1:11:32] and do what he's doing for you by the
[1:11:35] new ministry that broke open the seals
[1:11:38] to bring down the Holy Ghost in
[1:11:40] perfection.
[1:11:41] And you'll find that quote on uniting
[1:11:42] time inside. All right. So God and man
[1:11:47] was one there. God and man is one here.
[1:11:49] See what is it? being filled with the
[1:11:51] spirit him having the preeminences
[1:11:54] that was God's achievement that's God's
[1:11:56] purpose to do that he might be in Christ
[1:11:59] and Christ in us and all together one
[1:12:01] the Holy Spirit same thing it revealed
[1:12:03] it to Christ reveals it here the
[1:12:05] supernatural
[1:12:07] creative power
[1:12:10] did did the Holy Ghost have brother
[1:12:13] Brandham in supreme control
[1:12:16] h how how did he create the squirrels
[1:12:19] how did when he meant the bull and the
[1:12:21] bull was going to kill him and brother
[1:12:23] Brandham said on one of the tapes at
[1:12:24] first their fear struck him that's a
[1:12:27] natural reaction but then God unfolding
[1:12:31] his gift the gift of perfect love amen
[1:12:36] then all of a sudden amen by sovereign
[1:12:39] grace of God that super anointing of
[1:12:42] love came on him
[1:12:45] and look what it did I'm g I'm
[1:12:48] dramatizing okay I'm God's prophet.
[1:12:50] Don't you know? No. I'm sorry I
[1:12:54] disturbed you.
[1:12:56] God, make me like that.
[1:12:58] Make me like that.
[1:13:01] I'm sorry I disturbed you. Same thing
[1:13:04] with the hornets.
[1:13:06] I'm sorry I disturbed you.
[1:13:09] And that anointing
[1:13:11] said, you know, I'm sorry I disturbed
[1:13:13] you. would you just go back into your
[1:13:15] your your your nest there, your house,
[1:13:18] and I won't I won't bother you no more.
[1:13:21] And do you know that he put a white
[1:13:23] steak down by that tree? And Sister
[1:13:26] Hoover, who was the nanny of the family,
[1:13:28] he told her, "You see that white steak?
[1:13:31] I don't let my children play by that
[1:13:33] tree because I promised."
[1:13:39] How powerful is his voice?
[1:13:43] He's trying to get you to have perfect
[1:13:46] confidence in his voice.
[1:14:00] So now we see love's viewpoint.
[1:14:03] We see the blood of the royal law
[1:14:06] that rent the veil
[1:14:09] so that we could judge our hearts by the
[1:14:12] blood of Jesus Christ. Is that what you
[1:14:15] want?
[1:14:16] Do you want to be judged by the letter
[1:14:17] or do you want to be judged by the grace
[1:14:20] of his blood?
[1:14:24] Then judge others the same way.
[1:14:27] See? And why did he judge you by the
[1:14:30] royal law?
[1:14:32] Just to make your heart perfect? No. So
[1:14:35] the Holy Spirit, the power of the royal
[1:14:38] law, could come into you and come down
[1:14:41] in this day and show you the perfect law
[1:14:44] of liberty. Amen.
[1:14:46] You're hearing it on the tapes.
[1:14:49] We're everything that you need to make
[1:14:51] ready for the rapture.
[1:14:54] It's on the tapes.
[1:14:58] I came in the message in 73. I've been a
[1:15:01] tape boy since 73. I never pointed my
[1:15:04] family to anybody
[1:15:08] but to Elijah.
[1:15:18] So by God's grace, I have love's
[1:15:20] viewpoint. The blood of Jesus Christ has
[1:15:23] perfected my heart. The Holy Ghost has
[1:15:26] opened my eyes
[1:15:29] to see the right view of this end time
[1:15:34] ministry, which is God's gift for your
[1:15:38] perfection.
[1:15:45] Perfection means two words. One, you're
[1:15:49] sinless. It is in his sight. And two,
[1:15:51] you're mature.
[1:15:54] You're mature in the Holy Spirit. He was
[1:15:57] mature in the Holy Spirit. And you could
[1:16:01] tell he was mature because of the five
[1:16:04] vindications of the third pool. God
[1:16:06] wouldn't just give that to anybody.
[1:16:16] All right. And so now what's happening?
[1:16:19] The word test is on.
[1:16:23] The word test has been on
[1:16:26] to see what your viewpoint is. To see
[1:16:30] what your perspective is.
[1:16:34] to see if your heart has been washed in
[1:16:37] the blood and filled by the Holy Ghost
[1:16:40] so you can get the right revelation of
[1:16:42] this word to judge not only the ministry
[1:16:46] of William Brandham but yourself your
[1:16:49] situation and my brother here and my
[1:16:52] sister here to judge them properly and
[1:16:54] even the sinner and your enemies.
[1:16:59] Yes or no?
[1:17:02] Here,
[1:17:10] I'll read you this other quote because
[1:17:12] it it brings it home.
[1:17:14] This was from 1955.
[1:17:20] And when you separate from divine love,
[1:17:23] then you can't overlook your brother's
[1:17:26] mistakes no more.
[1:17:29] Hello
[1:17:32] I've known brother Israel for a long
[1:17:34] time.
[1:17:35] He knows my mistakes.
[1:17:41] Have you ever said something that been
[1:17:43] taken the wrong way? Have you ever done
[1:17:46] something that was right, but it was
[1:17:48] just the wrong time? I've done a lot of
[1:17:50] that,
[1:17:55] but I died daily
[1:17:58] to maintain what the right mental
[1:18:01] attitude.
[1:18:03] Okay, you're reading the quote and I'm
[1:18:05] preaching. Let me come back to the
[1:18:06] quote. All right. When you separate from
[1:18:08] dime love, you can't overlook your
[1:18:10] brother's mistakes no more. How many
[1:18:12] would raise their hand say, "Lord, help
[1:18:13] me.
[1:18:19] You got to ball them out for it.
[1:18:22] That's right. You can't overlook
[1:18:24] sister's mistakes no more because you
[1:18:26] got away from the divine part, that love
[1:18:28] part. But if you really love the Lord
[1:18:30] Jesus, if sister or brother does
[1:18:32] something to you, oh well, that's all
[1:18:34] right. They didn't mean to do it. That's
[1:18:36] the kind of love that Christ had.
[1:18:37] Father, forgive them. They don't know
[1:18:39] what they're doing. What if he held my
[1:18:42] sins against me?
[1:18:44] What an awful person I was. But he loved
[1:18:46] me so well that he forgave me for them.
[1:18:49] When I was undone, he forgave me. He
[1:18:51] loved me a pure love. And when Adam
[1:18:53] separated himself from the pure love of
[1:18:55] keeping God's word in his heart, when he
[1:18:58] did that, then he begin to these other
[1:19:00] faculties come in. Malice, envy, strife,
[1:19:06] hatred, so forth. What are those
[1:19:09] attributes of an evil spirit?
[1:19:13] What happened when the evil spirit came
[1:19:15] on King Saul?
[1:19:18] These are exactly the attributes.
[1:19:21] King Saul was saved.
[1:19:25] I'm judging myself, sis. I I I I don't
[1:19:29] want this. You know, you you've had
[1:19:31] people that have made you angry. You've
[1:19:34] had people that want to tempt you with a
[1:19:36] grudge, right?
[1:19:40] When are they going to ever change?
[1:19:41] You've been praying, right?
[1:19:47] There's your challenge. And so, if
[1:19:50] you'll look back at brother Brandham's
[1:19:51] ministry when he come, what'd he come
[1:19:53] do? He found them all fussing with one
[1:19:55] another and he came to help him. But,
[1:19:57] you know, and then the Pentecostals
[1:19:59] embraced him. But you know what? If he
[1:20:01] was, if the oneness was over here and
[1:20:02] the Trinity was over here, they were
[1:20:04] fighting
[1:20:06] and he tried to settle them down. Now,
[1:20:08] now, now, you know, become a little lamb
[1:20:13] and the devil will take you on.
[1:20:16] Love.
[1:20:19] All right,
[1:20:22] so let me give you this. Here's the big
[1:20:24] word test of the hour for me. Okay,
[1:20:28] that's a word test. It happens every day
[1:20:32] and it's real
[1:20:34] and it's painful and we're not just
[1:20:36] saying it's an easy thing. No, that's
[1:20:39] why you got to have your Calvary daily.
[1:20:43] That's why prayer is important in your
[1:20:46] life. If you want to get up shouting and
[1:20:49] jumping, which I love to do, get down
[1:20:52] first on your knees so it's not hollow
[1:20:55] in here.
[1:21:02] All right, here's the one.
[1:21:08] This is from warning then judgment. Back
[1:21:10] to it.
[1:21:12] Now when he speaks of his vision, he's
[1:21:15] talking about the prophet.
[1:21:18] Whether it's wrath or whether it's
[1:21:20] healing,
[1:21:22] it may linger,
[1:21:25] but it's got to come to pass if he
[1:21:28] speaks it in the name of the Lord.
[1:21:32] See, it might be a blessing he speaks
[1:21:33] for you. He might tell you a certain
[1:21:36] thing and you can't see it at all.
[1:21:38] Can't see it at all.
[1:21:44] Might be a blessing. He speaks for you.
[1:21:46] He might tell you a certain thing. You
[1:21:47] can't see it all. And you say, "How can
[1:21:49] it be?" Why? It's uh I I I He told me,
[1:21:52] "Thus sayith the Lord, this is going to
[1:21:54] happen and that was going to happen and
[1:21:56] it ain't happened.
[1:22:01] The man is wrong. Now you'll be judged
[1:22:05] for disbelieving it."
[1:22:08] That's sobering, isn't it? That ties
[1:22:10] with with scriptures, what Jesus said,
[1:22:12] isn't it?
[1:22:14] You see why we need love's viewpoint in
[1:22:17] this age? You see we why we need the
[1:22:20] blood applied to our heart, the Holy
[1:22:22] Ghost in us to reveal to us that
[1:22:24] whatever this prophet said, it will come
[1:22:28] to pass.
[1:22:32] No matter how much Sarah judged by the
[1:22:35] outward appearance and said, "Abraham,
[1:22:37] we're too old.
[1:22:39] Your body's dead. My body's dead. There
[1:22:43] can it be any union of oneness? There's
[1:22:46] no way at all. And brother Brandham said
[1:22:49] on tape,
[1:22:51] it never was about Sarah's faith. It was
[1:22:54] always about Abraham's faith.
[1:22:57] He stood for her.
[1:23:01] Sister Hattie Wright said the right
[1:23:06] thing.
[1:23:09] Sister Brham, who brother Brandham loved
[1:23:12] with all of his heart, and she loved him
[1:23:15] as much as any human being could love
[1:23:17] him. She said the wrong thing.
[1:23:21] Did God spare her?
[1:23:24] Not until
[1:23:28] Abraham, I mean, Brother Brandham stood
[1:23:30] in the gap.
[1:23:37] She said the right thing
[1:23:40] and the Holy Ghost poured out eternal
[1:23:42] life.
[1:23:44] She said the wrong thing and she was
[1:23:46] plagued.
[1:23:49] God help us
[1:23:52] to have love's viewpoint
[1:23:55] so we can see the right thing about his
[1:23:59] visions
[1:24:01] and say the right thing
[1:24:05] so that we can be judged right. We don't
[1:24:08] want to be wrong for misinterpreting his
[1:24:11] visions.
[1:24:15] Now, I pray I can have the grace to say
[1:24:17] this.
[1:24:20] I'm not going to go into depth, but the
[1:24:22] tent vision, you need to determine, has
[1:24:25] that been fulfilled? Yes or no? Just
[1:24:29] that part.
[1:24:31] Just come to that part.
[1:24:34] Okay. If yes, when and where?
[1:24:39] If no, why not? Now, why would I say
[1:24:43] that? Um um
[1:24:48] it's the love of God, friends.
[1:24:50] It's the late hour.
[1:24:53] Look into the word. Go back over the
[1:24:56] word.
[1:24:59] That vision he said was the greatest of
[1:25:02] them all.
[1:25:07] But what I believe about it, what he
[1:25:11] believes about it, that ain't how you're
[1:25:13] going to be judged.
[1:25:15] It's what you believe.
[1:25:18] You see,
[1:25:20] it's what you believe.
[1:25:22] It's an individual. That's why I'm not
[1:25:25] judged whether I go to Tucson
[1:25:27] Tabernacle, Shalom Tabernacle, or
[1:25:30] whatever the other fellowships around
[1:25:32] here. I'm not judged by that.
[1:25:37] Is that the truth?
[1:25:38] Your judge is an individual. He's not
[1:25:40] calling Tucson Tabernacle. He's not
[1:25:42] calling Shman Tabernacle. He's not even
[1:25:44] calling the Brandom Tabernacle. He's
[1:25:46] calling individuals out
[1:25:50] under the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:55] the Lord
[1:25:58] to be filled with the spirit so you have
[1:26:02] the revelation in this hour of what
[1:26:06] God's trying to do.
[1:26:15] Now, let me just say this. I didn't say
[1:26:17] anything against the Brandom Tabernacle.
[1:26:19] I didn't say anything against Shalom
[1:26:21] Tabernacle. I didn't say anything
[1:26:23] against Tucson Tabernacle. The pastor of
[1:26:26] Tucson Tabernacle. I love that brother.
[1:26:28] He's a precious brother.
[1:26:33] But what we have to learn is though we
[1:26:36] don't see always eye to eye. We have to
[1:26:39] remain hearttoart.
[1:26:45] Now, I know
[1:26:48] me and my wife, we were the only ones
[1:26:50] that ever saw eye to eye
[1:26:52] 49 years. I have to I'd have to repent
[1:26:56] of that one. Even Zapora and Moses
[1:26:59] didn't see eye to eye.
[1:27:03] But what is it? You love her. She loves
[1:27:08] you.
[1:27:10] It comes down to love, brothers and
[1:27:12] sisters.
[1:27:13] It comes down to love.
[1:27:16] And so the last example, when the
[1:27:18] musicians can come and maybe play softly
[1:27:22] until we get ready to take it up an
[1:27:24] octave. Is that is that the right word?
[1:27:26] Octave.
[1:27:29] The great emancipator.
[1:27:44] The Bible says
[1:27:47] be slow to to quick to hear and slow to
[1:27:51] speak. How many says amen?
[1:27:54] Quick to hear, slow to speak.
[1:27:57] In the business world, it was seek first
[1:28:01] to understand
[1:28:03] and then seek to be understood.
[1:28:08] Okay? Seek first to understand
[1:28:12] and then to be understood.
[1:28:16] And the reason the Bible said that
[1:28:19] [Music]
[1:28:21] was because the wrath of man doesn't
[1:28:23] work the righteousness of God.
[1:28:26] [Music]
[1:28:28] and by your words
[1:28:32] you'll be justified and by your words
[1:28:35] you'll be condemned.
[1:28:37] Think of Sister Hadtie. Think of Sister
[1:28:40] Brandom.
[1:28:42] By thy words you'll be justified. By thy
[1:28:45] words you'll be condemned because out of
[1:28:48] the heart
[1:28:51] the mouth speaketh.
[1:28:55] I want my heart
[1:28:58] judged by the blood,
[1:29:01] empowered by the Holy Spirit.
[1:29:06] Lord, help me to say the right thing at
[1:29:10] the right time in the right place.
[1:29:14] And when I don't,
[1:29:17] I am genuinely ashamed of myself.
[1:29:22] And I'll tell you
[1:29:24] because you know he sees everything.
[1:29:28] Young people even if you're struggling
[1:29:31] to live the Christian life because you
[1:29:34] only have the knowledge of the truth.
[1:29:37] Moses couldn't even fulfill his
[1:29:39] commission with the knowledge of the
[1:29:40] truth until he met the pillar of fire.
[1:29:46] And here is where I'll borrow a
[1:29:47] statement from my brother here. Tell
[1:29:50] God, "Lord, I'm struggling." Tell him.
[1:29:53] He knows.
[1:29:56] But God can work with that.
[1:29:59] He can work with that.
[1:30:03] Don't leave him. He won't leave you.
[1:30:07] [Music]
[1:30:10] But the knowledge of this message
[1:30:13] alone,
[1:30:14] [Music]
[1:30:17] you need the pillar of fire. You need
[1:30:20] your lick of fire. You need the spirit
[1:30:22] of truth, excuse me, to give you the
[1:30:25] power to give you love's perspective to
[1:30:28] come to those situations that you can
[1:30:30] judge right and wrong. And many times I
[1:30:32] haven't judged it right the first time.
[1:30:34] I had to go back and pray again.
[1:30:37] That's why it's knowledge, temperance,
[1:30:40] and patience. Knowledge. After all this
[1:30:44] time, sis, I finally got the answer on
[1:30:46] how to handle it.
[1:30:49] Temperance. Hold your peace. What? I got
[1:30:52] the answer. Hold your peace. How long?
[1:30:56] Patience.
[1:30:58] Till God's time.
[1:31:01] With what measure you meet, it'll be
[1:31:03] measured to you. Be slow to wrath, quick
[1:31:07] to hear.
[1:31:09] Nathan the prophet,
[1:31:11] he came to David with love's viewpoint.
[1:31:15] You know the story. David, there was a
[1:31:18] rich man. He had lots of lambs.
[1:31:23] There was a poor man. He had one little
[1:31:25] lamb and he cherished that lamb. That
[1:31:27] was wives.
[1:31:29] [Music]
[1:31:32] But a man came to visit David.
[1:31:36] Instead of taking one of the little one
[1:31:38] of the 500, one of the lambs, he took
[1:31:41] the poor man's lamb and he had them
[1:31:44] killed.
[1:31:46] And what happened to David?
[1:31:49] The man will pay with his life.
[1:31:55] [Music]
[1:31:59] Can you stand?
[1:32:01] The man will pay with his life.
[1:32:04] David,
[1:32:06] you're that man.
[1:32:09] But you won't die, David.
[1:32:13] God's grace.
[1:32:16] [Music]
[1:32:17] But he had to pay
[1:32:21] for sewing to the flesh.
[1:32:24] So will I.
[1:32:26] So will you.
[1:32:30] But aren't you thankful
[1:32:33] for the blood of Jesus Christ?
[1:32:36] Aren't you thankful for the Holy Ghost?
[1:32:39] Aren't you thankful
[1:32:42] that God sent the eagle eye that we
[1:32:46] could see the perfect law of liberty?
[1:32:48] And he started when they were all
[1:32:50] fussing, right?
[1:32:53] Don't you think the bride should stop
[1:32:55] her fussing?
[1:32:58] I think we should.
[1:33:01] [Music]
[1:33:14] You love the Lord
[1:33:16] wants my heart and soul.
[1:33:22] head

[1:34:23] [Music]

[1:35:05] glory, hallelujah.

[1:36:09] time with all your heart? Glory.

[1:37:14] happen anyways. That's what the prophet

[2:02:32] sisters. Just hold it there. Woman came
[2:02:35] through the prayer line. Brother Bannam
[2:02:37] told her, "Thus sayaith the Lord, you
[2:02:39] have the baby." Five years later, she
[2:02:42] had the baby. Let us pray. Dear heavenly
[2:02:46] father, how precious it is when the
[2:02:50] saints of God can dwell together in the
[2:02:52] unity. It's like that anointing oil,
[2:02:55] Father, that came down from head to toe.
[2:02:58] Oh God, we need more of you, Father.
[2:03:02] Lord Jesus, we thank you, God, for these
[2:03:04] saints of like precious faith, Lord.
[2:03:07] They believe this messenger that you
[2:03:09] sent them. They believe this message,
[2:03:11] Father. They want more of you. I want my
[2:03:15] hand up right there with them. Lord, I
[2:03:17] want more of you. And tonight, Lord,
[2:03:19] these prayers, these petitions that we
[2:03:22] put on the altar, Father, thank you for
[2:03:25] hearing our prayers. Lord God, there may
[2:03:28] be 600 Philistines come against Shamgar.
[2:03:32] And those Philistines may say, "You know
[2:03:34] what? You remember what happened last
[2:03:36] year, Shamgar? We took everything you
[2:03:38] got."
[2:03:40] Oh, God. Satan's a liar. Amen. There was
[2:03:44] a brass cap, Lord Jesus, on top of his
[2:03:47] stick. That means our sins are already
[2:03:50] judged. There's nothing against us.
[2:03:53] There's not 600 reasons to put fear on
[2:03:56] us, though how long they've been bound.
[2:03:58] Don't you worry. You hold to God's
[2:04:01] unchanging hand. Lord, help me to do
[2:04:04] that in my own life with these precious
[2:04:06] saints, with the pastor. Lord, help us,
[2:04:09] God, to hold on to thus sayeth the Lord
[2:04:12] and the blood of Jesus Christ and the
[2:04:15] promise
[2:04:17] I'm a present help
[2:04:19] in time of need in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:04:23] Amen.
[2:04:25] Amen. And Satan say amen. I want to see
[2:04:30] you.
[2:04:33] I want to see you.
