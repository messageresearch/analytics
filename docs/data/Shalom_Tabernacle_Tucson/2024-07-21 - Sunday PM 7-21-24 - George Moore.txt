it into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you let's turn to our Bibles to Galatians the 6th chapter we get right into the word of God tonight and so grateful to be here with you today Saints and just been a privilege to be in the house of the Lord and uh had several very nice um comments about the service this morning and I I certainly appreciate those things but I would also just Echo that we've had pretty much uh pretty much had a substitute in every single position in this church today and and I feel like well brother Chris that's right you're only your Standalone uh uh but uh pretty much uh new people everywhere and I to me I didn't they they did a fantastic job it just uh didn't feel any different to me than it ever did so I just appreciate the fine job of filling in and brother John have you ever LED songs before or is that something second time today and so we appreciate uh we appre appreciate people willing to jump in and just do what needs to be done and I that's uh that's sound booth back there we got a husband and wife Doo back there and man they've done a fantastic job today amen and so I'm so grateful for that and you know whatever your hands fine to do let's do it with all that's in us right now Galatians the 6th chapter Brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness consider in thyself lest thou also be tempted bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ for if a man thinketh himself think himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself but every let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another for every man shall bear his own burden let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also reap we talked about that this morning this is a law Saints good or bad he that sth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that sth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting and let us not be weary in wello for in due season we shall reap if we faint not and as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith and may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word God bless you may be seated and uh we just want to continue up uh or complete that thought this uh that we had this morning of your season is coming and so we'll continue down that Avenue tonight uh just for a little short message and then finish up so good to be here with you I I should be able to uh to preach better this evening than I did this morning because Sister Lisa made me a sister Lisa made me a pean pie and so uh I'm going brother Chuck on the strength of that pecan pie this afternoon and and uh so that was uh that was a blessing but we're looking forward God has appointed us a season is that right and God has actually appointed whatever season you're in right now uh whether it be a good season or a tough season or a wet season or a dry season or whatever time it is God has a pointed that that you might go through it right now so you might not enjoy the season that you're in right now maybe you're in a good season maybe you're not but if you're not uh you might not be enjoying that season but it has been a pointed to you and we know Romans 8:28 says all things work together for good to them that love God and to them who are called according to his purpose and you say well brother George you don't understand I'm so nervous right now I'm so anxious right now there's such a pressure in my life there's there's everything all these decisions to make and I've got so much going on you don't understand I know that uh I may not understand exactly where you're at but I know I've been close and I do know that even though it's not fun to go through it's still exactly according to his purpose can you say Amen to that tonight now we tend to to gravitate toward the more enjoyable things and we we like to talk about the blessings of God we like to talk about all the good things that the Lord does for us brother Levi and that Ecclesiastes that we read this morning if you read the good stuff in there it says that a man we like to talk about when something's born or or something's planted or something's healed or something's built up or or it said that there was a time to laugh there was a time to dance there was a time to gather together there was a time to embrace there was a time to get and a time to keep and a time to sew and a time to speak and a time to love and a time of peace and those are God's blessings upon us Saints and I've felt those blessings throughout my life since I gave my heart to the Lord but just as important as those things are the other things may be more important because the Bible said that to try of your faith worketh patience and that and that those things are more precious to you than gold so so greater maybe even than those things are the other side of that Ecclesiastes 3 that said there's a time to die there's a time we're going to have to deal with death Saints death is a part of life and loss is a part of living and and we find there's a time to die and there's a time to pluck up that what's planted There's A Time to Kill a time to break down a time to weep a time to mourn a time to Cast Away a time to refrain from embracing a time to lose Saints A Time To Lose A Time To to uh to Rend and a time to keep silent and a time to hate and a time of War I'll tell you I I was talking to a young brother the other day and he felt like he had a calling of God on his heart and and he felt like that the Lord wanted him to preach the gospel and he was asking me for advice and and I just told told him I said well young man you know you just got to seek the Lord on that and I told him what brother brandom said about about you you know remain neutral and you pray and just what we talked about this morning and he said all right brother George I'll try to do that and he said I I just don't know he said I've been doing some Bible studies and and he said the first couple of three Bible studies I did he said and I got done with those Bible studies I said there ain't no way God's called me to anything he said it just felt like it was a failure it felt like it didn't go anywhere it felt like I felt flat on my face and uh he said but after that he said about a week later he said the Lord would start dealing with me again I said Son probably the best thing that could happen to you would be for you to fall flat on your face because if you come into something and you start if he you know if God call you to something you started preaching the gospel and it just went great all the time and it went great from the very beginning and everything went wonderful for you you'd probably think you were good you'd probably think that that that that the Lord would blessing you and you had such a gift and and you'd probably think that that sort of thing but God lets you fail sometimes and he lets you lose sometimes and he let those things happen so that you realize that you are completely incapable outside of the Lord Jesus Christ come on somebody tonight y'all didn't lay down on me this morning don't lay down tonight now we we just got a little longer to go so we find that it's all into the hands of the Lord amen and we find then saints that sometimes God lets us go through things that that are not uh they're not good it's not they're not fun but it's all according to his purpose and so when I read those two things from Ecclesiastes one which one of them sounds like a better evening but but which one of them is ordered of the Lord they both are amen one sounds like a lot more fun than the other but they're both ordered of God brother Chris they both have a purpose and they both have a reason now if you'll turn withen in your Bibles to First Peter the first chapter we'll find that uh that the Bible says 1 Peter the 1 chapter the third verse says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy has begotten unto us begotten us again unto a lively Hope by the resurrection oh God yeah begotten unto us again unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you so so he has he's begotten you to that he's he's he's placed you into that there is an inheritance waiting for you there that isn't corruptible that that that that doesn't fade away way that's Eternal that's all oh God when I think about it Saints and he says who are kept by the power of God through faith under salvation ready to be revealed in the last time Saints we ain't keeping us he's keeping us we're not the ones hanging on he is hanging on Amen and he says the trial that the trial of your faith let me back up number six wherein ye greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold Temptations now you may not be there tonight maybe you are but every one of us knows what manifold Temptations feels like M multifaceted coming from every angle Temptations and tests and trials coming from all different angles to us and he says rejoice in the season of those manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than that of of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen ye love in whom now uh now though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving at the end of your faith even a Salvation of your souls so the Bible tells us to Rejoice going through these Temptations because is working a work in us that will reward us when he appears now to everything there is a season and everything there is a time appointed and some seasons are wonderful and others are really hard and sometimes you're on top of the world and other times you don't know how you're going to make it through the rest of the day come on somebody every sometimes you don't know but sometimes everything's going good but all of them good or bad are temporary so when things are going great praise God but don't get too comfortable because it's only for a season but when everything's going wrong don't get too discouraged because that's only for a season also can is that right tonight Saints so you're going to make it one way or another you're going to make it because there's a place reserved for you amen this too shall pass amen amen your marriage might have ups and downs but it's only for a season if everything's going great that's wonderful it might not go great for long before there's going to be a downtrend and and if everything's going wrong that's only for a season so we got to understand that up or down everything is constant in Jesus Christ your health might be up and down I've been sick and I've been healed I've been well and I've been sick Saints it's all up and down but it's always in the hands of Jesus Christ whether I feel good or whether I feel bad I'm still a child of God today your family might have ups and downs there's times where everybody gets along better than others but it's all in the hands of Jesus Christ today your job might have ups and downs but it's only for a season and it's always in the hands of Jesus Christ now it's hard when you're in the middle of the battle to see the end it's hard when you're in in the middle sometimes the saying is you can't see the forest for the trees sometimes you just got to back away a little bit and look at what God is doing but don't be discouraged because it's only for a season now the Bible said he made all things beautiful in his time is that right Saints and your season is coming it's not just a a promise of Deliverance and overcoming Victory although there is a a victory ictory coming for you there's always another Victory coming there's always something else for you to overcome it is a promise of that but it's also a sobering reminder that if we're we're in a season of Plenty there's probably a drought coming sometime soon also so we don't want to get too high and we don't want to get too low we want to just good or bad leave it in the hands of the Lord now wers of unity paragraph 40 he says this he says I've had the privilege of standing in Rome where the that great Caesar who tried to unite the world under the Roman Empire and today you have to dig 20 feet down to find the ruins of that City and I stood in Egypt where the great pharaohs that tried to unite the world under Egypt and dig down 20 and 30 feet to find the ruins of that City for here we have no continuing City says the Bible but we seek one to come we seek an inheritance in corrupted he says but not long ago when at one uh at one when I one time went out to a place that I was a little boy I seen a great tree where I used to go and sit under that tree and I said when I'm an old man I'll come back and sit under this certain tree and I'll look up into its branches and I'll admire its beauty as uh I am today a boy of 12 and there's nothing left of that tree but a snake snag why there is nothing here that can continue he says it must cease and every Mortal thing speaks of an immortal one coming for everything that we see is a perverted Act of something that's real and he says I marry a couple and I see a lovely young girl in her blushing teen and a young man with his shoulders back standing as they are one and their hearts beating together and I think isn't that too pretty a picture to ever be marred by death but it's just a few years till their hair turns gray and the shoulders stoop and back to the dust they go is that right saints Saints it seemed like I just got married and here I am a grandpa now don't get me wrong being a grandpa is better than being a dad if I have known the grandkids was as good as they are have had them first but it don't seem like no 's passed brother Chuck seemed like I just got married and here we are way on up down the road is that right you know where' the time go what happens Saints and and I'm I'm just I feel like I'm just getting started but I I need more time to serve him Amen brother brother John you might be as good-looking as you ever was but where did the years go where did the time go h h h when you look back and young people that just got married you that's just getting married you're going to look you're going to look back and and and you know before you know what kids are going to be here then the kids are going to be graduating and and then they're going to have kids and and you're going to say where does the time go here we have no continuing City but there is coming a time well there won't be no more gray hairs there's coming a Time where there won't be no more sickness all this sorrow be over with so there's coming a time where we won't have to break our fellowship brother Brown said what is it it's a picture when they're standing there that there's a land beyond the river where every symptom of death is taken away there Immortal shall stand in his likeness the sun and the stars to outshine that great morning star hasn't lost any of its beauty since the Lord blow it from his hands and hung it in its orbit and look what a few years does to us but what did he say in the scripture he said those that have turned many to righteous shall outshine the Stars so we look for a city whose Builder and maker is God is that right today Saints so we understand that there's a time and a purpose appointed to everything we understand as we covered this morning that there's five musts that we must have to do the will of the Lord that it must be the right time it must be the right season it must be according to the word it must come to a Vindicated Prophet amen and we know that we have to wait upon the Lord because there is always a space of time between the sewing and the reaping there's always a space of time between the planting and the Harvest there's always something in the middle there Saints there's always a space of time between the promise and the delivery amen there's always that space of time there and and so we understand that we have to get used to waiting upon the Lord and we also know that our season is coming it's on the road right now but then the question becomes and what I want to get into tonight as our as our message tonight the question is what do we do while we're waiting because we're going to have to learn to wait God will make promises and God will deliver on those promises but there will be a waiting period many times amen sometimes things happen miraculously and some things happen immediately but other times we have a period of waiting if you claim your healing sometimes you'll have a period of waiting if you claim your family sometimes you'll have a period of waiting if you're seeking something from the Lord whether it be Deliverance of something something or whether it be the holy ghost or whatever you're seeking from the Lord sometimes there'll be a period of waiting on the promise and it's in this place between the sewing and the reaping that the devil can really work on us when God makes a promise and we receive that promise and then we're waiting on that promise to manifest in that space of time Satan can attack our minds when we're in the middle there is our most tremendous mental battle we know he promised it and we know he can deliver on it but now what now that's many times where the devil starts acting on our reasoning it's our reasoning that we get while we're waiting on the Lord if you'll remember while Abraham was waiting on the promised son that's when Sarah come up with the Bond woman idea now is that right Saints while he was waiting so the promise had been given and he's waiting on the promise to manifest the seed had been planted and he's waiting to harvest that seed and while he was waiting to harvest that seed while he was waiting on the promise to manifest that's when Sarah came with the Bond woman idea and we see what kind of trouble the Bond woman caused it was while Moses was waiting on the promise he was in Egypt he knew he was the deliver he knew he was getting close to time and it was while he was waiting on the promise that he that he got to reasoning that he got to trying to do something himself that he slew the Egyptian and he fell it's while we're waiting on the Lord that we try to take things into our own hands many times we commit things to the Lord but while we're waiting we try to get involved again if you got a if you got somebody in your family and you're claiming them and you and you say Lord just do with them what you need to do Lord whatever you got to do bring them bring them back into the into the house of the Lord Lord we're committing them to you we're we're giving them to you we're applying the token to them whatever you got to do Lord but then we start every time something happens and the Lord's trying to work that for us then we want to get back involved again if you commit it to the Lord leave it there stop digging the seed up every time something happens if you've give it to the Lord and you put it in his hands leave it there and let him deal with it it's in the middle between the har between the planting and the Harvest that the that the devil deals with our minds amen and I'll tell you Satan will use anything or any tactic to torment our minds anything he can do believer's position in Christ paragraph 11 brother Bram said many times people go out and see an evangelist like for an instance our brother Billy Graham now let me stop and say this one of the tactics that the devil tries to do when we're waiting is to make us start looking around at what God is doing for others so the the promise has been given to you you're waiting on it to manifest and while you're waiting the devil will try to get you to look over at this one look over at that one look over at this brother look at that sister look at what's going on here look at what's going on there and you start comparing your life to what everybody else is going through and you find he says many times people go out and see an evangelist like for example for instance our brother Billy Graham what good would it do for me to try to be like Billy Graham I couldn't do it if I had to I've got a Ministry that I got to take care of and the next man's got his ministry and each one has got a Ministry even to the housewife has a Ministry of ministering the word of God and he says now if I tried to impersonate Mr Graham I'd find myself in trouble right quick because he's smart shrew educated a real preacher well I'm not well maybe if Mr Graham tried to find himself impersonating me he'd be be in trouble too and Saints if we start looking around at everybody else and we start trying to impersonate what everybody else is doing I'm seeing a concerning trend of it in message preachers today where you got a couple or three bigname preachers and they got some doctrines that they believe and you find that a lot of the of the the other preachers are trying to emulate are they trying to preach the same Doctrine or they trying to preach the same way or they trying to preach the same style ain't everybody supposed to be preaching the same way Saints ain't everybody got the same style don't everybody got the same sermon topics God don't want that he want he uses everybody differently I mean and one Minister should be different than another Minister and so we find many times people start watching other ministers and they start impersonating and emulating and I can tell sometimes by watching them who they've been listening to you say I know where that come from I know where they got that mannerism I know where they got that drink that they're drinking there but Saints we're all different that's carnal impersonation but you know they did it to brother brandham also brother brand that's why the third pull was was was kept secret he said I I can't say much about it because they it was carnal impersonation they they impersonated the first two two and he said don't say much about it the angel told him not to say much about it he said it won't be a public show and I can't say much about it it's carnal impersonation we shouldn't all have the same style we shouldn't all have the same way of of playing an instrument or singing or or whatever God uses all kinds of different styles he uses all kinds of different people and if we're all trying to do it the same what if there's somebody that your style reaches everybody don't like my preaching everybody don't like another brother's preaching it's different styles for different people and God uses different ones to reach different people we shouldn't all be preaching the same things we don't all even have to agree on the same Doctrine I don't have to have my Doctrine approved except by the message you know if somebody preaches something I don't understand one of three things is going to happen I'm going to go check it with the word if I don't understand it brother will I'm gonna check and see what the word says now there's three possible outcomes the first one which is highly unlikely brother Chuck but the first one is that I could be wrong and if I'm wrong then I've been corrected by the word and we say Amen because we don't want to be wrong we want to be corrected so if we see something wrong we want God to show us something right so if I hear something that I don't agree with and I go check it with the word and I find out that that's right then praise God I've been corrected that's God's program the second outcome which is more probable is that I found out I was right you'd think sister Brandy give me an amen over that but even if I found out I was right then I have just went to study and solidified what I already believed to begin with amen and we need to do that we need to remind oursel why we believe what we believe from time to time amen or the third option which is probably the most common is that we're both seeing the same thing but we're looking at it from a different angle and in that case then my mind is open to another possibility of the same scripture or doctrine but in all cases it's a net positive is that right even if somebody says something you don't agree with it still works to good see sometimes we need to be ch challenged we need to challenge ourself that maybe there's something we don't understand maybe there's more out there than what we know maybe there's another Revelation that we haven't received yet and maybe there's a different point of view that we can look at things through a little different lens or a little different eye but we can't all be the same even up to the housewife brother brand said she's got a Ministry and and and can't everybody do it the same way you sisters can't look at another sister and say well her family seems like they got it all together I'm going to do it the way she does it you're not called to do it the way she does it what the way she does it might not work in your family maybe you got a different Dynamic maybe you got a different way of doing things maybe your kids wouldn't receive it that way because everybody's different you got to go the way God leads you to go you got to do it the way God shows you do it everybody can't raise their kids the same what work for one might not work for the other I'll tell you you can't even raise your kids the same I got three girls and every one of them's different what we had to do to get one of them keep one of them between the rails didn't work on the other is that right Saints you got to you got to manage to the individual now believer's position in Christ he says so there you are we can't do that we got to go uh I think it's paragraph 12 he says there you are we can't do that we got to go we got to do what God has revealed to us to do can you say Amen to that tonight we got to do what God has revealed to us to do brother Graham is doing that God has revealed to him a worldwide Revival and he's making a good show of it and I appreciate him and I'm trying my best by the Revelation that God has given me to minister to the sick people to to what he told me to do now if we can find our position and know that it's God's word that was promised uh go God's word had promised it that's the reason Joshua and Caleb had no fear that they could take the promised land because all the rest of the nine came back or 10 and said we can't do it while those cities are walled High we look like grasshoppers upside the people they're so big and they're armed and say we just can't do it see there we're looking at the sense of reasoning you can't look at the sense of reasoning you've got to look at the promise of God now God had already sent his Angel and the angel was in the camp moving on and the revelation of God had brought the word of God manifest and now now they was ready to push in to the promised land therefore Joshua and Caleb had all all the promises was to them for God had promised he was going to give them the land and they then they waited all this time and then after a while the Holy Ghost came down to Moses a pillar of fire formed over them and they they and followed it and here it was right up there at the promised land now ready to push over so he could believe it because God's promises is unfailing they are the truth he said so we find that it was this sense of reasoning the same sense of reasoning that that caused Sarah to look for the Bond woman the same sense of reason that called Moses to try to slew the Egyptian and take it into his own that same sense of reasoning again caused the children of Israel to doubt whether they were able to take the promised land or not and we find that we cannot compare ourself to others it's a recipe for misery if you're compare pring yourself and your life and the life of your family and everything you're going through to what everybody else is doing the devil will show you everything great that everybody else has everybody's got more money than you everybody's got a nicer car everybody's got a better job come on somebody everybody's got more vacation time than you got everybody their their family gets along better than your family does their family photos look better than yours do they got better hair they got better teeth come on somebody tonight their kids are doing better they got their hair is nicer they got a better they got a better looking husband brother John they don't ever get upset they're more spiritual than we are they got more faith than we got but he the devil will never show you the rest he'll just show you the great things that everybody else has got but he won't show you the pain they're dealing with he won't show you the troubles that they're dealing with oh they might have more money than you and they might have more heartaches than you too and they might have a better car than you got but their health might be failing them you they might they might seem like they got a better job than you got but you don't know the stress that they're dealing with for having that job you never know what people's going through Saints you never know and the devil won't show you that he'll only show you the things that everybody's got that looks better than what you got now believer's position in Christ paragraph six brother BR says the main thing is this he says if we can find where God's word belongs in our life he said God sets time limits and then it works all uh all all to that time let me skip down just a little bit he says and people try to do it within themselves they try to make God's word fit their program but you that's you got it vice versa we've got to fit in God's program amen so the devil will try to use other people's blessings against you if you're in a season of trial or you're in a hard time and your brother or sister is in a season of blessing then you might get a case of the why me Lords if you look around and you're healthy and you're struggling in your body and then somebody else is healed the devil will say see there they must be a better Christian than you they must be doing something right and that you're doing something wrong because they got healed and you're not healed yet or if you see somebody and and their family is doing better than your family then the devil will look at you and say see there you're you're not you're not the kind of believer you need to be or your family be doing like their family's doing now is that right or wrong Saints but Saints it's not any of those things they're just in a different season than you're in amen you might fast forward a year to be right the opposite but the Bible says that when one member rejoices we all Rejoice with it he can even drive us so far that we can become jealous of His blessings in other people's lives now that's right Saints it happened to brother brandham do do y all remember the story and Eagle stir and as there's many places in the scripture or in the in the message but brother brandom was standing and he he was talking about Tommy Osborne and he was talking about or Roberts and he was talking about touring that great facility that or Roberts had and he said he had 500 IBM machines is that what he said Saints and and he said here they are and uh let me let me see if I can pick this up here he says I I stepped outside he talked about walking through that building and getting a tour seeing all those great IBM machines all those letters coming in worldwide Ministries going on there and he said I stepped outside paragraph 199 he said I stepped outside and I said to brother fiser that I missionar with him in Africa he was taking me through and I went to the mirror and seen those great beautiful hands reaching down like the hands of God and sinners reaching for him he said my heart just jumped for Joy I thought oh God how I thank you for or Roberts how I thank you for one little old Pentecostal boy born in a Dugout Over Yonder and he says could have come up uh to a mount like that and I said how I than you God and I stood outside and I got to myself and I walked around to get in my car and then something said to me it was Satan he said it was Satan and he said but what about you he said all Robert's Ministry come off of yours so did Tommy Osborne and here you are where's your IBM machines he says a little old end of a trailer that brother Leo lets me have an office in a phone sitting in there a little second-handed typewriter he says he said Satan he said what about that and I said oh I I would sure hate for them to come and see that and he said Satan says you see he don't he can't trust you and I said I guess that's right see all them Brethren with all I guess he can just trust he can't he just can't trust me that's all and I was standing there looking and I got real broke up and I thought oh God as hard as I've tried and everything else and I said look what you've done just then I Heard a Voice said but I am your portion I said oh God a tener a cottage why should I care they're building a place for me over there rubies and diamonds and silver and gold his coffers are full he has riches Untold I'm a child an eagle of the king a child of the king with Jesus my Savior I'm a child of the king I love that saints Saints if you look around at what everybody else has got and you look around at how much you think everybody else is blessed don't forget that he is your portion amen don't forget that he is your portion Saints whether you got it good here or you struggling here he still your portion we're not living for this world anyway we're living for something over there we're living for an inheritance Incorruptible Saints it don't matter if you struggle every day of this life as long as you make that life he's your portion and if somebody else has got more than you amen he's still your portion and if somebody else appears to be blessed more than you amen he's still your portion thank Lord it don't matter what everybody else has got what matters is you got him and he's got you and at the end of the road it's all going to be the same nobody's taking nothing from this world with them that's right is that right Saints you know I was talking to a brother here a couple weeks ago a minister brother and you know how I preached that where where brother Brandon went beyond the curtain time and he said are all these bandoms y'all know that story and and and he said no these are your converts to Christ and say that means tonight you and I are converts of William brandom because he saw us Beyond a curtain of time he saw us with an inheritance Incorruptible do you believe that Saints and I said I don't care who you are and I don't care who witnessed you the message if you receive this message a convert of William brandham amen and I believe that with all my heart Saints I'm resting on it tonight and I had a minister brother tell me said well brother George but but but what about us what about us what if we what about the souls that we win for the Lord what about the people that we that are saved under our ministry does does brother brandham get all the credit for that he said what about the stars in our crown and I said I'm not I told him like I said don't talk to me about no robe and Crown just let me look at him for a thousand years I don't care who gets credit I'm not worried about no stars I'm not worried about no Crown he's my poron that's Crown enough for me today Saints he's what I'm looking for I do believe you can have a star in your crown and they still be a ver to William brand amen but I'm not worried about who gets credits if a soul is Born Into the kingdom of God you think I care who put him there it's all Jesus anyway talk to me by no stars now look at what the scripture said about this I also dealt with a situation where and this has been quite a while ago but where a sister she wasn't feeling she wasn't feeling like she was as spiritual as everybody else because other people would go to the Altar and they would cry out and and and there tears flowing and she said I I just don't I don't cry like that or I I don't but I I I don't I don't get in the spirit like other people do s you can't compare your worship to to other people some people worship differently amen but as long as we're worshiping the same God I said sister do you love him does he live in your hearts don't worry about what everybody else is doing you worship God the way you worship God we can't compare oursel to others Romans the 12th chapter ninth verse says let love be without dissimilation that means hypocrisy amen let love be pure and let love be real abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kindly affectionate one to another with Brotherly Love in honor preferring one another not slothful in business fervent in spirit serving the lord Rejoice rejoicing in Hope patient in Tribulation continuing instant in prayer Distributing to the necessity of the Saints given to hospitality is this what the Bible says we should be Saints says bless them which persecute you bless and curse not rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep be of the same mind one toward another mind not high things but condescend to Men of low estate be not wise in your own conceits recompense to no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men if it be possible as much as lith in you live peaceably with all men dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give Place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine and I will will repay sayith the Lord therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink for in so doing Thou shalt reap coals of fire on his head be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good see now let me ask you this do we do these things only when we're being blessed also do we do these things when everything's going good for us but we don't do these things when things are rough or do we do these things all the time do we do we bless those that are suffering even when we're suffering do we try to help those that need help even when we need help ourself yes yes it's not a it doesn't say if everything's going good then you do these things it doesn't say if everything's blessing you then you bless others but in all things Saints we got to be just as happy when it's no as it is when it's yes now there is going to come a time that somebody who is seemingly doing better than you is going to ask for your help and you're going to think you want me to help you you need to be helping me and you'll think about those things there's going to come a time that you're working yourself to death and somebody that seemingly doesn't work as hard as you do is going to ask you to help them sisters there's going to come a time where maybe a sister that's not as fervent as you are about keeping the house clean is going to ask you to help them clean their house there's going to come a time when somebody that's been sick half the time you've been sick is going to be healed and they're going to come to you with the testimony and that's when it gets hard but the Bible says to Rejoice I'm still sick God healed you and I'm rejoicing with you I'm not jealous that God healed you and didn't heal me come on somebody tonight and it's also not just your brothers and sisters the Bible said that if your enemy is hungry now you might not have enough food for yourself sometime but if your enemy is hungry feed them now Galatians 6:9 said let us be weary not be weary in wello for in due season we shall reap if if we faint not so we don't worry about doing good to people is that right Saints we don't worry about helping people just help them just do good to them you say Well they're trying to take advantage of me that's not your business you just help them if you can you say well well I don't know what to I don't know maybe they don't deserve it it doesn't matter just do good to them is that what the Bible said Saints you're not responsible for what others do you're responsible for what you you do and we're to live for each other we say well I've been hurt brother George I I'm looking to get even that's why the Bible said vengeance is mine sayith the Lord let the Lord to handle all the getting even you just serve the Lord and love him and try to help everybody you can and let the Vengeance end look I've been hurt too we all been hurt amen but we let those things go so that we can have love in our hearts and we leave the rest of it up to God can we close and the musicians come just remember when you think everybody else has got been blessed and you're not getting blessed we don't know everything we don't know what everybody else is going through brother John come on up here just because someone looks like they're being blessed doesn't mean they aren't struggling in some other area of their life just because somebody's got it all all together it looks like doesn't mean that things aren't aren't going crazy in their mind in their heart in their life people don't tell you everything you never know what people deal with you don't know what people deal with before they made it to the CH uh church tonight you don't know what people's home life is like you don't know what people deal with with their children or with their parents or or with their job you don't know what they deal with at school you don't know what people deal with sometimes you don't even know you might have been married a hundred years and you don't know exactly what what your spouse is dealing with you don't know the trials everybody's facing we don't know the battles everybody's fighting but we do know that everybody is fighting the battle everybody just whatever's on your heart everybody's fighting everybody's got to struggle because we all battling the same devil today so in closing I just came to tell you tonight that we're all on the same team we're all on the same team in our families we're all on the same team we're not against our families we're not against each other in in our marriages husbands and wives they're on the same team we might not always see eye to eye but we got the same goal we got the same things

on the same team we're all in this together no no matter what season we're in we're all on the same team one might be being blessed the other might be in a dry spell one might be having it uh having a good time of it the other might be struggling but we're all in it together and when one member suffers the Bible say we all suffer with them and when one member rejoices and when one member is honored we all Rejoice with them we bear each other's burdens we help each other make it through can we bow our heads tonight with our heads bow tonight you say brother George I'm struggling too people don't know what I'm going through but but Jesus does people don't understand my battles but Jesus does people don't know the things that I fight in my mind nobody knows the things that I'm battling in my heart Nobody Knows the trials that I'm going through but Jesus does but whether we know him or not whether anybody else knows them or not we can pray for each other we can lift each other up we can be there for one another we can help one another whether you're in a good spell a dry spell whether you're in a good time or a bad time we're all in this together Saints and when our brothers and sisters

put them aside and recognize that everybody's going through something and I don't want to compare myself to other people's trials and I don't want to compare myself to other people's tests Lord but I
