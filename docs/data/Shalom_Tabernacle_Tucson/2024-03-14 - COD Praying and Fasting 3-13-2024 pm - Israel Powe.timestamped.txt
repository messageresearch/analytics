[30:32] with you um apologize a little bit for
[30:36] not being here at the appointed time on
[30:39] Sunday but we got across that border or
[30:41] tried to get across the border and it
[30:43] was just a long line and then the time
[30:45] and so forth but we're here tonight
[30:47] we're glad glad to be here with you and
[30:49] we trust the Lord will bless you we like
[30:52] to go right into the scriptures tonight
[30:54] and it's on as we've been in the cond
[30:57] cond order and Doctrine and we've been
[31:00] on conduct for quite some time and we're
[31:04] going to maybe finish that up tonight on
[31:07] a little subject of conduct that I
[31:10] include in this and that is fasting and
[31:14] praying and I'd like to find our
[31:16] scripture tonight in Matthew chapter
[31:19] 6 our lord Jesus and I spoken here at
[31:23] the church on it
[31:25] before and I just want to bring it to
[31:27] you again
[31:28] uh tonight as I believe that it's as
[31:30] part of our
[31:34] um the things that we
[31:36] do um in our conduct we know that our
[31:41] life is not our own and that um we have
[31:46] given our life over to him and so we
[31:49] took that first service on Behavior we
[31:52] talked about the cost of
[31:54] discipleship and then our post of Duty
[31:57] and then
[31:58] forsake not the assembly um and then we
[32:02] spoke on giving your best last week we
[32:05] spoke on how how we dress men and women
[32:08] how we should dress and then tonight
[32:10] we're going to talk on uh fasting and
[32:13] prayer in Matthew chapter 6 let's take
[32:17] that for our
[32:26] scripture we'll have you seated after we
[32:29] read Matthew chapter 6 and verse number
[32:34] 16
[32:35] moreover when you fast be not as the
[32:38] Hypocrites of a sad countenance for they
[32:42] disfigure their faces that they may
[32:44] appear unto men to fast verily I say
[32:47] unto you they have their reward but thou
[32:52] when thou fast anoint thy head wash thy
[32:56] face that thou appear appear not unto
[32:58] men to fast but unto thy father which is
[33:01] in secret and thy father which seeth in
[33:04] secret shall reward thee
[33:08] openly notice Jesus said when you fast
[33:12] not if you
[33:13] fast it's when you fast we'll take one
[33:16] more scripture in 2 Chronicles chapter
[33:22] 7 I don't see my amen group here tonight
[33:26] brother George usually helps me out John
[33:29] sometimes Brother Scott helps me let me
[33:32] see who don't help me see I think you
[33:35] all help me right you going to help me
[33:38] tonight all right 2 Chronicles chap
[33:42] 7 verse number
[33:45] 14 If my
[33:48] people which are called by my name shall
[33:52] humble themselves and pray and seek my
[33:56] face and turn from their Wicked Ways
[33:59] then will I hear from heaven and will
[34:01] forgive their sins and will heal their
[34:05] land amen may God bless you bless the
[34:08] reading of this word you may be seated I
[34:10] want to thank brother Joe for taking the
[34:12] service for Sunday morning and brother
[34:15] George on Sunday night and taking those
[34:19] services and brother the different ones
[34:21] that were here to help keep the work of
[34:25] the Lord moving forward I appreciate
[34:27] that
[34:28] each and every one of you amen we thank
[34:32] the Lord for them and so this uh subject
[34:36] on fasy I'm not going to take every
[34:38] scripture on it and bring it like a
[34:40] teaching I'm just going to bring out
[34:42] some of maybe the highlights of what
[34:44] brother bandam has taught us and showed
[34:46] us when I first came into the message we
[34:49] would hear the main thing about fasting
[34:52] that I would hear amongst the fast the
[34:54] the message groups they would say well
[34:57] brother brandom says uh you only fast
[35:01] when God puts you on the fast and when
[35:03] you're fasting you won't hunger and he
[35:06] did say that but that's not all he said
[35:09] and we're going to bring that balance
[35:10] for you here uh tonight the Lord willing
[35:13] and just show that fasting is
[35:17] something that you add with your prayer
[35:22] life it's a
[35:24] resource
[35:26] to to call on God and and the power of
[35:30] the spirit comes when we deny the things
[35:33] of our Earthly uh pleasures and one of
[35:36] those Pleasures that we have gotten into
[35:39] is eating actually
[35:42] overeating and we showed you in the
[35:44] scriptures about our dress and the way
[35:45] we dress and I showed you even the way
[35:48] we live our lives from the Old Testament
[35:51] author which was God who gave it to
[35:53] Moses he's very concerned about the
[35:56] details and we might think well that's
[36:00] too much control or too much in my life
[36:02] but God's the one who instituted all of
[36:04] the laws and it's
[36:06] actually sinful to overeat that's
[36:11] right and I wonder if we any any of us
[36:15] ever been guilty of that getting that
[36:18] second
[36:19] plate because the mac and cheese was so
[36:22] good I had to get some
[36:24] more and but there's a there's a dis
[36:27] discipline that we need to be conscious
[36:29] and aware of of course we have to eat
[36:32] but then get into this thing of over
[36:35] eating and Jesus said Beware he gave us
[36:39] a warning he said remember in the days
[36:40] of Noah and the days of lot they were OV
[36:44] eating they were eating drinking giving
[36:47] that's all they talked about and tell me
[36:49] why every new construction Corner how
[36:52] many different hamburger stands do we
[36:54] need how many variations of a hamburger
[36:57] can you make I mean in coffee shops in
[37:00] different flavors and then and the
[37:02] different types of foods and then we eat
[37:04] and then we eat meals between between
[37:06] another meal and another you just get
[37:08] caught up in it and it's the age that we
[37:10] live in and Jesus told us to beware so I
[37:13] want to read this quote for you that
[37:16] this is the one that we all know about
[37:20] it
[37:22] seems brother Brandon makes this
[37:25] statement and says
[37:28] this
[37:32] here in the inner Veil sorry sis but
[37:36] yeah you're going to have to help me out
[37:37] tonight I didn't give her any quotes but
[37:40] Christianity is not something God's not
[37:43] one you have to beg and cry and plead
[37:46] and fast and starve and everything like
[37:49] that to get to certainly not I'm not
[37:52] degrading the fast but here not long ago
[37:55] a man wrote a book on fasting my women
[37:58] come into the meeting and men who went
[38:00] on those fasts went on those fasts that
[38:03] were insane they went just because the
[38:05] book said to fast 40 days some of them
[38:09] with false plates and their teeth would
[38:11] drop out their eyes would sink back
[38:14] mothers to be women to be mothers their
[38:16] little ones as you understand they would
[38:19] completely go mentally out and be taken
[38:21] in institutions many many of them come
[38:24] in that condition I believe in fasting
[38:27] certain L but when you fast you don't
[38:30] hunger Jesus after he had got through
[38:33] fasting the Bible said he was hungry God
[38:37] puts a fast on you you don't put it on
[38:40] yourself he certainly captured the women
[38:43] the man did that wrote the book when he
[38:45] said put a picture of a woman there she
[38:48] looked 20 years younger said after the
[38:51] fast you saw you ought to seen her then
[38:54] just about a year later what she looked
[38:56] like after that
[38:58] certainly you don't do that you don't do
[39:01] things by works it's by
[39:05] Grace brother random continues in the
[39:09] message and so we've heard that haven't
[39:11] just heard that in the message that God
[39:13] puts a fast on you brother random
[39:15] separates a long fast and then he calls
[39:20] what he calls the command to fast and we
[39:23] read where Jesus says when you fast now
[39:28] Jesus also highlights this power of
[39:32] fasting and the importance of it in
[39:34] Matthew chapter 17 we like to turn there
[39:37] quickly with me and read Matthew 17 is
[39:42] also recorded in Mark chapter
[39:46] 9 but in Matthew chapter
[39:48] 17 they're trying to cast out this demon
[39:51] from this
[39:53] child and
[39:56] um
[39:58] verse 17 Jesus Matthew 17:17 says oh
[40:03] faithless and perverse generation how
[40:06] long shall I be with you how long shall
[40:08] I suffer you bring him hither to me
[40:12] Jesus rebuked the devil and he departed
[40:15] out of him and the child was cured from
[40:18] that very hour then the then came the
[40:21] disciples to Jesus apart and said why
[40:24] could not we cast him out and Jesus said
[40:27] unto them because of your
[40:29] unbelief for verily I say unto you if
[40:32] you have faith as the grain of a mustard
[40:34] seed you shall say unto this mountain
[40:37] remove hence To Yonder place and it
[40:39] shall remove and nothing shall be
[40:42] impossible unto you how be it this kind
[40:48] goeth not out but by prayer and
[40:53] fasting so Jesus is going to highlight
[40:57] the importance of the prayer and the
[41:00] fasting as it pertained to this man
[41:03] getting his Deliverance or God answering
[41:06] the prayer for this stubborn Spirit was
[41:11] stubbornness it wasn't just prayer alone
[41:13] it wasn't just good wishes alone but
[41:16] there needed another level to go with
[41:19] the prayers and I and I would just like
[41:22] to encourage you Believers that is a
[41:25] part of our weaponry is fasting with
[41:29] your prayers of course we know to pray
[41:32] we're supposed to pray there's a power
[41:34] in praying but when you couple your
[41:36] prayer with putting aside your food for
[41:40] a season however that may be then God
[41:44] somehow Honors that because when you're
[41:47] fasting you're denying yourself and when
[41:49] you're fasting in your body it's a feast
[41:53] with the Lord so you're separating the
[41:57] carnal man eating whatever the flavors
[42:00] and things you normally would eat three
[42:02] times a day sometimes six times a day
[42:04] and then sometimes we just we just ate
[42:07] but we're just going to the refrigerator
[42:09] looking going into the cupboard looking
[42:12] for something you're not hungry it's
[42:14] just we got into this thing and I'm
[42:16] talking about me okay and
[42:19] so why is that what is this about so in
[42:23] Mark chapter 9 let's take this in verse
[42:26] number 29
[42:34] 9 this is that same case and look at how
[42:38] Mark it's written in Mark vers 29 and he
[42:41] said unto them this kind can come forth
[42:45] by nothing but prayer and
[42:49] fasting he makes it exclusive that
[42:54] this power this demon to get the
[42:57] Deliverance it is nothing but by prayer
[43:01] and fasting let me ask you a question
[43:03] don't answer it but how many of you or
[43:07] have have
[43:09] Incorporated fasting into your prayer
[43:12] life especially when you're seeking a
[43:15] greater and closer walk with the Lord
[43:18] Brother bam talked about his sister
[43:20] Dolores that was fasting for the Holy
[43:24] Ghost he talked about in his meeting he
[43:27] had to be fasting for the demons to go
[43:32] out even though he was commissioned by
[43:33] an Angel and there is a there is a
[43:36] lifestyle that goes with this
[43:40] deliverance and so brother Brandon makes
[43:43] this statement here um in conference
[43:47] with God he says this here and I have
[43:48] many many quotes I'm going to keep right
[43:50] on my time here if I finish it I do if I
[43:53] don't I don't okay but we'll get to the
[43:56] main point here all right and conference
[44:00] with God
[44:02] 1959 when we have World conferences they
[44:05] usually have their selected play and
[44:08] what do they do at this conference they
[44:10] drink drinks cocktails they smoke cigars
[44:14] and cigarettes they lie to one another
[44:17] and deceive one another at peace talks
[44:20] of the world but when God calls a
[44:23] conference it's
[44:26] fasting cleaning up prayer receiving
[44:30] orders going forward that's God's
[44:33] conference not feasting but fasting not
[44:38] indulging in filth but separating
[44:41] cleansing yourself from all
[44:42] unrighteousness when you go before God
[44:45] cleaning Yourself by faith through the
[44:48] applying the HS up to the blood and
[44:51] cleansing your heart and walking before
[44:53] God uh be before God for a conference
[44:56] that that's the kind of a conference
[44:58] when you meet with God then God gives
[45:01] you orders then you go forward he goes
[45:05] with
[45:07] you he talks about in questions and
[45:10] answers that he's talking about his
[45:12] sister and Lois sister Lois how they
[45:15] were fasting for the Holy Ghost now look
[45:17] at this here and be Not
[45:19] Afraid um so brother Bam's on the
[45:22] mission field he's his ministry is
[45:24] flourishing and going forward and and he
[45:27] he says this here he says someone said
[45:29] to me I believe it was last evening he
[45:32] said brother brandom where does this
[45:33] come from how are you able to go meeting
[45:37] after meeting staying under the
[45:40] anointing even one sign made Jesus weak
[45:44] when the woman touched His Garment said
[45:46] I see you stand for hour under that I
[45:49] said I'd like to tell you here's where
[45:52] it lays he don't want me to say this but
[45:55] my brother said in here Jean go that boy
[45:59] don't touch bread or water for days
[46:02] fasting and praying hit there here sits
[46:06] Pat Tyler this other brother sitting
[46:08] here by him them men lay on their face
[46:11] without food and water when I'm in a
[46:14] meeting praying for me that's where it
[46:18] comes from if there wasn't something
[46:21] like that I'd go
[46:24] down that's the men behind the the
[46:27] curtain the men who prays for strength
[46:30] for a message that they lay down
[46:34] everything maybe they haven't got the
[46:36] gifts to do those things but they're
[46:38] putting every effort they can to support
[46:42] it you see where support is you see
[46:45] support isn't just financial support
[46:47] isn't just you being here this is how
[46:50] they supported him behind the curtain
[46:54] supported and the only way they can do
[46:57] it they know is prayer before God and
[47:00] fasting there's where power lays let
[47:05] someone pray for
[47:06] you
[47:10] now how many need some
[47:14] support this church needs support the
[47:17] ministry needs support our youth needs
[47:21] support the families here need support
[47:24] we have people that have been baptized
[47:27] and we want to see them filled with the
[47:28] Holy Ghost we want to see the ministry
[47:31] flourish we're not just making members
[47:35] to join a group but we want to see
[47:36] people move on to the next step with God
[47:40] and fasting is a part of the Christian
[47:44] Arsenal amen go pick it up go do it
[47:48] what's fasting you say brother this is
[47:50] it 40 days is it one day
[47:53] well the the real definition of fasting
[47:56] is when you're not
[47:58] eating so so um the term breakfast is
[48:04] breaking your fast you can have your
[48:06] breakfast at 12 or 1 or 3 that first
[48:09] meal we call it breakfast or breaking of
[48:14] your fast we hope you're not eating at
[48:16] night when you're
[48:18] sleep you wake up you have been fasting
[48:21] your body has it needs that rest of
[48:25] feasting and fasting in you need that
[48:28] balance you can't fast all the time you
[48:30] can't feed all the time you need that
[48:32] balance and the balance your body needs
[48:34] that rest and it's just a beautiful time
[48:37] there's many scriptures that talk about
[48:39] Rising
[48:40] early get up early we have asked the
[48:43] church to pray and it seems like a you
[48:46] know you know that's ear that early
[48:48] morning hour yes it's the sacrifice the
[48:51] our Saturday prayer morning prayer
[48:52] meeting is is a little sacrifice but
[48:55] typically if people come and get down to
[48:58] pray that early they haven't been eating
[49:00] and it's just a wonderful opportunity to
[49:03] to call on God it's always a wonderful
[49:06] time to pray and call on him when you're
[49:09] in that fasted condition it seems to to
[49:12] help even more it's scriptural it's
[49:15] throughout your Bible so brother random
[49:17] talks
[49:19] about the support behind the scenes from
[49:24] the people who didn't have the ministry
[49:26] that he had the Forefront but behind the
[49:29] scenes they didn't just fast with no
[49:31] food no food no
[49:34] water and that's a
[49:36] sacrifice that's
[49:38] deliberate particularly in this age
[49:42] where everything is centered around
[49:44] eating so much and we Christians we
[49:48] don't party we don't go out all we can
[49:50] do I think I heard brother green talk
[49:52] about how Christians that's all we got
[49:55] is church and fellowship we always going
[49:57] to get something to
[49:59] eat that's why we're a little bit on the
[50:01] chunky side some of
[50:04] us don't look around
[50:07] now
[50:09] right ain't nobody saying
[50:12] nothing but you know you'll see the
[50:15] Christians that's what we I mean there's
[50:17] no sin in eating no there's no sin in
[50:19] eating but you can overeat and you can
[50:21] get out of balance in that but look at
[50:23] this and you must be born again brother
[50:25] vom says this here and he says this in
[50:29] the me uh paragraph 21 he says I want to
[50:32] thank this little church for its pastors
[50:34] for the trustees and the deacons all the
[50:37] members and I'm grateful for the holy
[50:39] spirit that watches over them may they
[50:42] may that great Holy Spirit continually
[50:45] lead them and guide them in the path he
[50:48] would have them go in Reading in the
[50:51] Testaments the old and the new and also
[50:54] in the n n a AG that how that when
[50:58] sickness struck amongst the Saints the
[51:02] whole church went together with one
[51:04] heart they called on God and their
[51:06] petition was granted each one of them as
[51:10] members of the body of Christ fasting
[51:13] and praying and God heard and answered
[51:16] prayer father may this little church be
[51:19] so Bound in the bounds of love to each
[51:22] other and the Holy Spirit until it
[51:24] become like one of those
[51:27] that there will be no friction Among Us
[51:31] in this coming year may there be just
[51:34] such Godly love and everybody walking in
[51:38] the way of Christ until many weary
[51:41] pilgrims along the road will come and be
[51:44] saved may it be said that when you enter
[51:46] the doors of the little building that
[51:49] the presence of God meets you with a
[51:52] sweet welcome yes sir take sickness away
[51:56] from in the midst of us Lord what a
[51:59] powerful prayer just beautiful don't you
[52:01] want that in your church don't you want
[52:04] that in your home actually don't you
[52:06] want that in your own heart and life no
[52:10] friction get rid of the static and the
[52:12] friction and then no friction among us
[52:15] and so um the church would get together
[52:20] and fast and pray now this is difficult
[52:25] to get people to do
[52:28] because soon as you mention something
[52:30] like that it's like why
[52:34] what you know because the carnal
[52:37] man you know
[52:41] always you're you're it's just
[52:46] um it's just the way it
[52:49] is you can't hardly get people to get to
[52:52] come together for the prayer
[52:55] meeting it's
[52:57] difficult to get people to pray
[53:00] together difficult and I'm going to read
[53:02] for you here why I say that because the
[53:05] prophet said it all
[53:09] right you see if I can get it for you
[53:11] here
[53:15] quickly
[53:19] mhm
[53:22] yes somebody said don't let them find
[53:25] it
[53:27] no nobody here would say that but the
[53:29] enemy would say
[53:31] that but the believer says Lord let him
[53:34] find
[53:38] it yes it's right
[53:51] here in the message presuming paragraph
[53:55] 45
[53:58] now if the Pentecostal Church would
[54:00] really live to its standard if it would
[54:02] live what it claims to have then the
[54:04] world would thirst after it but when
[54:08] they see the Pentecostal Church let down
[54:10] with just as many things almost as the
[54:13] world's got then they presume that
[54:16] they're just as good as you are that's
[54:18] right that's right they got a right to
[54:21] see but we got to get away from that we
[54:24] can't presume it we got to line up with
[54:27] the word you see now it's almost a
[54:31] impossible thing to get people praying
[54:35] and fasting praying fasting calling on
[54:38] the Lord seems like the church has got
[54:41] so
[54:42] drowsy lazy in these last days so
[54:46] pitiful I hate to come and just keep
[54:48] stirring and preaching and saying these
[54:50] things but brother sister that's the
[54:52] truth I just can't hold it it's the
[54:55] gospel it must must be preached it's got
[54:57] to be preached as a witness it's true so
[55:01] I think we just presuming to much so
[55:05] it's almost
[55:06] impossible to get people praying and
[55:11] fasting now if we knew the sign of the
[55:14] time and we do it would throw us into
[55:18] this fasting and praying we would add
[55:22] that to our daily walk and our daily
[55:25] life even if it's just half of a day or
[55:28] one meal or two meals and you add that
[55:31] to prayer um and brother brandom did
[55:34] that you say well brother Israel the
[55:36] Lord didn't lead me to do that I don't
[55:39] feel you know I feel like you know if
[55:43] I'm ever hungry then I know it's not God
[55:47] calling me to fast and as a result many
[55:49] people don't fast that that are in the
[55:51] message that's it's sad but it's true
[55:55] you know in our church Pentecostals that
[55:57] don't know these truths that we know
[55:59] many of them are big Believers in
[56:02] fasting and praying yes sir they call on
[56:04] it in their churches and it's strange
[56:07] how God answers
[56:08] them strange not in the message but God
[56:11] will answer a sincere heart and you
[56:15] apply this what Jesus said when you
[56:19] fast and if my people which are called
[56:21] by my name if you fast and all of the
[56:23] details on fasting how you you're giving
[56:26] up and setting thing the things of the
[56:28] world aside your diet and what you're
[56:31] eating and how you're eating you set
[56:33] that aside and we're going to pray for
[56:36] our meetings or we have a prayer line
[56:39] coming up we're going to pray for that
[56:40] and we're going to take for a week for a
[56:43] month you try bringing that to a church
[56:48] in the message a month of fasting every
[56:51] Friday heard did Brother manam tell us
[56:54] to do that you get the mumblers and the
[56:58] grumblers it's true it's
[57:01] true and because the Flesh and the
[57:04] carnal man don't want to do it but it's
[57:06] scriptural it's biblical and then we'll
[57:09] read we'll read the quotes here on it
[57:11] well brother bandam how he how he
[57:13] separates a long fast from the regular
[57:16] command to
[57:18] fast and here's what he says here
[57:25] in
[57:28] the
[57:29] message the resurrection of
[57:33] Lazarus paragraph number four if you
[57:37] keep your stomach empty the blood is at
[57:39] your brain you must be ready and if
[57:42] you're all full when that's the power of
[57:46] fasting when you're when you're full the
[57:49] blood goes into your stomach to digest
[57:52] your food you see and then when you're
[57:54] empty it's in your brain so you can be
[57:58] just cuz them two Spirits are so close
[58:01] it could deceive the very elect if
[58:03] possible and many times you hear it cry
[58:06] I've heard people shout now as I told
[58:09] you I hope God God that has let me find
[58:12] favor with you that you believe me I've
[58:14] heard people shout when it wasn't God
[58:17] I've heard people cry when it wasn't God
[58:20] see and there's sympathy sometimes the
[58:23] devil wants to be petted it's it takes a
[58:26] real sheep riser to know the difference
[58:28] between the bleet of a goat and a lamb
[58:31] they're so close together you see and so
[58:35] therefore on this platform you must be
[58:37] very careful can be just one thing in
[58:40] all that Satan want it could be one
[58:42] thing and and is all that Satan wants
[58:45] wants to throw out before the public so
[58:47] therefore I have to be fasting prayerful
[58:51] every minute on the guard watching for
[58:55] something in the message who is
[58:57] God paragraph 10 he says the night grows
[59:01] on of course I tire and tire more it is
[59:06] a truth that I believe as a physical man
[59:10] tears down the spiritual man has a
[59:14] chance that's what fasting in things are
[59:18] for he can have a chance to work upon
[59:22] these five senses of ours to bring us to
[59:25] believe even have faith in him I like
[59:29] the attitude I like the attitude of this
[59:32] Centurion tonight we just read of it so
[59:35] here brother bam is saying that when the
[59:37] physical man tears down it gives the
[59:39] spirit a
[59:41] chance and here our brother manam he
[59:43] took his ministry so serious that on the
[59:46] field he would be fasting when he go to
[59:49] pray for these in the prayer line he's
[59:52] fasting on his uh Ministry there serving
[59:56] the people and he had an angel that
[59:59] accompanied him that witnessed to him
[1:00:03] kept him all the way through his teenage
[1:00:05] years from going in the things of the
[1:00:07] world and yet look at the respect he had
[1:00:10] for his ministry and the people that he
[1:00:11] was serving on watch on guard and doing
[1:00:16] that part of that is this element that
[1:00:19] we call fasting and praying how about
[1:00:21] you and I today amen is it something
[1:00:25] that God bless bless you Brother David
[1:00:26] good to see you is it something that we
[1:00:29] can add a young Christian can add this
[1:00:32] to his prayer life I believe you should
[1:00:36] and I don't want the devil to rob you of
[1:00:38] this blessing that is absolutely
[1:00:41] scriptural and that God would use for
[1:00:45] your benefit that your spiritual man can
[1:00:48] grow so brother manam says in the
[1:00:51] message The Works that I do bear witness
[1:00:53] of me in Phoenix he says now we're going
[1:00:55] to read some of the word and then just
[1:00:58] comment two or two on it and then we're
[1:01:02] going to start the prayer line because I
[1:01:05] have this has been a fast day fasting
[1:01:07] and praying that God would Grant His
[1:01:09] blessings upon you people
[1:01:13] tonight so he says this in many places
[1:01:15] that Friday was a fast day for him this
[1:01:19] is brother brandham that he carved out
[1:01:22] one day out of the week that he was
[1:01:23] fasting there's no scripture that tells
[1:01:25] us us this there's no Old Testament or
[1:01:29] New Testament scripture that says you
[1:01:31] have to fast one day out of the week or
[1:01:33] Friday or Tuesday but this is what he
[1:01:37] did to add to his appreciation to the
[1:01:40] Lord and saving him and him being a
[1:01:43] minister of the Gospel a servant of the
[1:01:46] lord your life is not your own you're
[1:01:49] put here for a purpose and here is you
[1:01:52] know everybody else can eat and do
[1:01:55] whatever but but I'm going to take
[1:01:57] Friday and make that a day that I give
[1:02:00] to the Lord by pushing away my
[1:02:06] food what an
[1:02:09] example he says this in the
[1:02:11] message three Witnesses in Erie
[1:02:14] Pennsylvania paragraph 41 and I remember
[1:02:18] that one night coming in while I went up
[1:02:20] the hill at copio and we was coming down
[1:02:24] it was a fast day I fast much because
[1:02:28] meetings going on till I get real weak
[1:02:32] and then I have to eat a little but
[1:02:34] because this kind goeth out only by fast
[1:02:37] and prayer and I don't know what time
[1:02:40] that kind is going to be on the
[1:02:44] platform in the message at Thy word this
[1:02:48] is another Friday paragraph 19 one night
[1:02:51] they just piled up crutches and things
[1:02:53] to hold them around me for them to hold
[1:02:56] like this they wanted to take a picture
[1:02:57] of it some old canes and clubs
[1:03:00] everything that they've been walking
[1:03:01] with then I remembered I've been fasting
[1:03:04] it was just like tonight Fridays is a
[1:03:08] fast day has been for me for a long time
[1:03:13] brother Adam continues on so he's
[1:03:15] talking about this day Friday is a fast
[1:03:18] day for
[1:03:23] him mhm
[1:03:37] let me take this one
[1:03:39] here this is the message
[1:03:41] perseverance paragraph number nine I'm
[1:03:44] showing the example the prophet left for
[1:03:46] us paragraph number nine says today I
[1:03:48] was sitting in the room we had usually
[1:03:51] Fridays a fast day for me I don't eat
[1:03:55] sometimes Tuesdays and
[1:03:57] Fridays till sometime in the afternoon
[1:04:00] that's not a regular fast that's just a
[1:04:04] couple of days a week to fast so a long
[1:04:08] fast comes in more days when the Lord
[1:04:11] puts it upon you but that's just in
[1:04:14] respects and honor of God's Great
[1:04:18] Memorial to us the fasting a command
[1:04:22] amen and so after 3:00 usually I'll have
[1:04:25] a little something light somebody so
[1:04:28] here brother bam is showing us the
[1:04:30] difference between the long fast and the
[1:04:33] regular command to fast are you seeing
[1:04:37] that how many can say Amen to that he
[1:04:40] said the long fast the Lord puts that on
[1:04:42] you and when he puts that on you you
[1:04:44] don't hunger that would be however
[1:04:45] however many days but a short fast the
[1:04:48] command of fast could be half a day it
[1:04:51] could be a Friday it could be a Tuesday
[1:04:53] it could be a Sunday it could be
[1:04:55] whatever day say that the Lord would put
[1:04:57] that upon your heart but I you know I
[1:05:00] believe that it should be one day or
[1:05:02] someday or
[1:05:04] something that you can uh uh um
[1:05:08] do
[1:05:10] all
[1:05:13] right
[1:05:15] now we can support one another by
[1:05:18] fasting and praying for one another look
[1:05:22] at what the prophet tells
[1:05:24] us in Israel in the church paragraph
[1:05:28] 183 says God shake this little church
[1:05:32] this little old church like never before
[1:05:34] May the Holy Ghost get a hold of every
[1:05:36] person here cause them to fast and pray
[1:05:40] and lay on their face day and night
[1:05:42] screaming out Lord until the
[1:05:44] oldfashioned Revival breaks out here
[1:05:47] Lord and sweeps all out through here and
[1:05:50] sin in an oldfashioned time that'll
[1:05:53] bring men and women back to God Grant it
[1:05:56] father for we ask it in Jesus name amen
[1:06:00] amen shall We
[1:06:03] Stand I I think the last time I spoke on
[1:06:06] this or read some of these quotes uh
[1:06:08] someone here in the church here told me
[1:06:12] that that really affected them and they
[1:06:13] started fasting they take a day out of
[1:06:15] the week and they've been fasting and I
[1:06:18] appreciate that and I'm
[1:06:21] sure I'm
[1:06:24] sure I'm sure anyone that would have
[1:06:27] someone fasting and praying for them
[1:06:29] would appreciate
[1:06:30] that um I believe that we should be
[1:06:34] fasting and praying for our little
[1:06:38] church the Ministries here our music and
[1:06:42] the
[1:06:43] musicians the Ministries here the gifts
[1:06:47] and the talents here the call of God the
[1:06:50] visitors that come in our gates that
[1:06:52] they can find Salvation here the new
[1:06:55] comers that they will receive the Holy
[1:06:57] Ghost and may those that come up for
[1:07:00] prayer receive what we're asking for I
[1:07:02] believe that is accompanied with a
[1:07:05] Ministry like brother Adam's Ministry
[1:07:07] was a Ministry of fasting and praying he
[1:07:10] said I fast
[1:07:12] much that accompanied his ministry that
[1:07:15] was part of the sacrifice and I believe
[1:07:18] that we could we can have that
[1:07:22] too um in God's provided way the the
[1:07:25] prophet of God says this
[1:07:29] here paragraph number eight if you've
[1:07:31] been converted during this time of the
[1:07:33] Revival you don't have any church that
[1:07:36] you've taken up with yet I'd ask you to
[1:07:39] come join this little church it's a
[1:07:40] wonderful little place here to come
[1:07:43] serve the Lord if I lived here in this
[1:07:45] neighborhood I'd be a member of this
[1:07:47] church I'm a member of it anyhow I'm an
[1:07:51] associate pastor so I have to come back
[1:07:53] once in a while to see about my church
[1:07:56] and I look around you know so I'll be
[1:07:58] back to see you the Lord willing pretty
[1:08:01] soon and all of you people that's around
[1:08:03] in these other cities that belongs to
[1:08:05] these churches go to church every day
[1:08:09] every day that you can every day that
[1:08:13] they have service go attend your church
[1:08:17] be real loyal just stand by your church
[1:08:20] stand by your pastor help him out with
[1:08:23] everything you got give him spiritual
[1:08:26] support fast and pray for him and have
[1:08:30] faith in him and God will lead the
[1:08:32] church on to that glorious day that
[1:08:34] we're looking forward to come no matter
[1:08:37] you say well some our church don't
[1:08:40] believe well now just as long as you
[1:08:42] believe the main fundamentals and are
[1:08:44] born again of the spirit of God well you
[1:08:47] might believe Christ is coming on the
[1:08:49] White Horse and some believe he's coming
[1:08:50] on a white cloud and brother Adam
[1:08:52] continues on and so he's saying to fast
[1:08:56] for your pastor pray for the spiritual
[1:09:00] support and God will Le the church on to
[1:09:05] that glorious day now this
[1:09:08] quote is is for every everybody that
[1:09:12] would read it he said brother Israel
[1:09:15] you're reading that because you're the
[1:09:16] pastor whether I'm the pastor or not
[1:09:17] it's still a quote somebody's got to
[1:09:20] read it and somebody's got to hear it
[1:09:24] and then somebody should believe it and
[1:09:26] Obey it is that right because there is a
[1:09:32] power that comes with fasting and
[1:09:37] praying there is
[1:09:44] um now there's different ways you can
[1:09:47] fast and brother bam talks about that he
[1:09:51] in one of his fast he was just eating
[1:09:54] milk and
[1:09:56] crackers and he says that in the message
[1:10:00] why in bluming him
[1:10:02] Illinois and so you know we you know
[1:10:06] many people can Define what your fast is
[1:10:08] or you know no water or no juice or no
[1:10:11] you know hard Foods or whatever but here
[1:10:14] he he was talking about um in the
[1:10:17] message
[1:10:19] why paragraph number 16 well now when
[1:10:24] you come to the plat form that's you
[1:10:26] that's doing that like the woman touched
[1:10:29] His Garment it's your own faith that
[1:10:31] does that I have nothing to do it has
[1:10:34] nothing to do with me to me I can do
[1:10:37] I've asked God for something over and
[1:10:39] over for myself for the past five years
[1:10:42] he won't even say a word to me about it
[1:10:45] my own mother was laying here dying and
[1:10:47] saying son what shall be my end my sweet
[1:10:51] old mother I couldn't tell her until God
[1:10:53] tells me see he has to speak I don't do
[1:10:56] the speaking it's him it's not me that
[1:10:59] causes the vision here on the platform
[1:11:01] ask my brethren with me this week I have
[1:11:04] eat nothing but crackers and milk milk
[1:11:07] that's true fasting waiting seeing which
[1:11:11] way the spirit will lead the boys at the
[1:11:14] door said there's a big smage board down
[1:11:16] here brother random how I'd love to go
[1:11:18] to the
[1:11:21] smage to the smage
[1:11:24] Borg
[1:11:26] how we know what a smish borg is they
[1:11:29] don't call him that no more or maybe not
[1:11:31] at least not here but that's I used to
[1:11:33] love to go to The Smokers board but here
[1:11:36] he was fasting and what was his fast he
[1:11:38] was just eating crackers and milk and
[1:11:41] one place he talked about he wasn't
[1:11:45] eating Pleasant
[1:11:47] foods and the sign that's Overlook he
[1:11:50] was seeking the Lord about something so
[1:11:53] he wasn't eating Pleasant Foods is the
[1:11:56] way he titled it and so I I believe that
[1:11:59] if we have these areas in our life that
[1:12:02] we're trying to move forward with the
[1:12:04] Lord that and and particularly as we are
[1:12:08] talking about the orders or the conduct
[1:12:11] of the church that is that is part of
[1:12:14] the conduct of the church is that you
[1:12:17] are praying for that church and you're
[1:12:19] actually fasting for for the church
[1:12:23] you're fellowshipping in if there
[1:12:25] there's an issues things you don't like
[1:12:27] um don't pout about it pray about it if
[1:12:31] there's things that you have concerns
[1:12:32] you like to see more of then bring that
[1:12:35] to the Lord in prayer good and then fast
[1:12:38] and pray and take do your part if
[1:12:41] there's something that you're trying to
[1:12:42] get from the Lord you want to feel that
[1:12:45] precious touch from him you have those
[1:12:48] special moments where the Lord comes
[1:12:49] down and and just assures you that
[1:12:52] you're doing the right thing we call
[1:12:54] those little visitations those are
[1:12:57] available to the believer and uh you can
[1:13:00] move away from the things of the world
[1:13:02] and and and and the things of your
[1:13:04] eating H eating you know uh patterns and
[1:13:07] so forth and take a little time and pray
[1:13:11] you're not just fasting but you're
[1:13:13] fasting and praying it's it's a
[1:13:18] blessing it will be a blessing
[1:13:23] amen he
[1:13:27] he talks about the men that lay behind
[1:13:29] the curtain for
[1:13:31] support and that
[1:13:34] we cleanse our lives through now I like
[1:13:39] this one where he talks about how we
[1:13:44] can um if we've done
[1:13:49] wrong that we
[1:13:52] can go before the Lord
[1:13:56] and fast for the Lord to clean those
[1:13:59] things out of our
[1:14:03] life and
[1:14:08] that's in the message the way of the
[1:14:10] true
[1:14:13] Prophet I do believe in the
[1:14:16] Purgatory but I believe it's right now
[1:14:19] you purge your own soul Purgatory means
[1:14:23] to purge when you see you've done when
[1:14:28] you when you see you've doing something
[1:14:31] wrong get out there clean it out of You
[1:14:34] by confession and crying and fasting and
[1:14:39] praying someone even laughed at me when
[1:14:41] the Lord came here not long ago give me
[1:14:44] a vision that I always wanted to see
[1:14:46] about binding that serpent I always
[1:14:49] wondered how if I should step out like
[1:14:52] that when that's what I've wanted all my
[1:14:55] life then I began to fast and pray and
[1:14:58] said what did you do that for I said and
[1:15:01] there he said that I was not sincere
[1:15:04] enough actually to come down I actually
[1:15:08] to come down want to purge myself not
[1:15:11] wait till you die and let some priest
[1:15:13] try to purge you purge your souls but
[1:15:16] see they took it out of the
[1:15:18] authoritative word and put it over in
[1:15:20] the hands of some man-made Dogma to
[1:15:22] bring money into the church because they
[1:15:24] look at worldly things worldly Church
[1:15:26] Great powers in the world political
[1:15:28] Powers but God looks to his
[1:15:31] word amen so when you've done wrong you
[1:15:34] can clean that out by confession crying
[1:15:40] fasting and
[1:15:42] praying now just what would happen if
[1:15:46] the few people how many people were in
[1:15:48] here tonight one two 3 4 5 6 7 41
[1:15:53] 41 someone it
[1:15:56] so you know um that's Joe's one of his
[1:16:00] gifts you know I always count flocks of
[1:16:02] birds if there's 10 or eight or 12 I
[1:16:04] don't know why if there's a flock of
[1:16:06] birds going by I always count them and I
[1:16:08] just want to know how many birds in that
[1:16:11] flock and so brother Joe counts flocks
[1:16:13] of
[1:16:14] Believers so if this 41 people including
[1:16:17] the little Bitties we count them too
[1:16:19] right including the little Bitties the
[1:16:22] old ones if we will all get down on our
[1:16:24] knees and pray do you believe the Lord
[1:16:27] will hear that
[1:16:28] prayer and there's sincerity there and
[1:16:32] then what if that 41 people or few
[1:16:35] people they are would fast and
[1:16:38] pray would that make a
[1:16:41] difference in just our worship service
[1:16:44] alone see your worship service isn't
[1:16:47] your skills or ability to sing it's not
[1:16:51] just the ability to play an instrument
[1:16:53] or to pick out a few songs to sing
[1:16:55] that's part of it that's a good part of
[1:16:57] it but the real worship service is when
[1:16:59] he comes
[1:17:01] down is that
[1:17:03] right and that's what we want in every
[1:17:06] service is the anointing to come down
[1:17:09] the Holy Spirit to come down in the
[1:17:13] meeting get in our hearts get in our
[1:17:15] ways our life and all that we are doing
[1:17:19] and
[1:17:20] um fasting is part of
[1:17:23] that it would be just beautiful if you
[1:17:26] if we would incorporate that in our in
[1:17:28] our daily walk and taking these
[1:17:31] scriptures and believing God that he's
[1:17:34] going to answer the request that we have
[1:17:37] and for the growth that we need we have
[1:17:40] our needs we have physical needs we have
[1:17:43] financial needs we have um spiritual
[1:17:47] needs
[1:17:50] right and a church that would pray and
[1:17:53] fast together what kind of church would
[1:17:54] that be
[1:17:55] be oh my say well brother is we need
[1:17:59] more we need another instrument over
[1:18:01] here we need more we need more oh we
[1:18:03] just need the ones the people that we
[1:18:05] have to get into this Spirit of fasting
[1:18:08] and praying now let's take
[1:18:12] um just one example in the scripture is
[1:18:16] this man corus which happens to be a
[1:18:20] gentile he's found in Acts chapter 10 I
[1:18:22] believe let's turn there quickly
[1:18:36] our fine Italian brother
[1:18:40] Cornelius verse number one there's a
[1:18:42] certain man cesaria called Cornelius a
[1:18:45] centurion of the band called The Italian
[1:18:47] Man a devout man one that feared God
[1:18:51] with all his house which gave much arms
[1:18:54] to to the people and prayed to God
[1:18:58] always he saw in a vision evidently
[1:19:01] about the ninth hour of the day an angel
[1:19:03] of God coming into him and saying unto
[1:19:06] him
[1:19:07] Cornelius and when he looked on him he
[1:19:09] was afraid and said what is it Lord and
[1:19:12] he said unto him thy prayers and thy
[1:19:15] arms have come up for a memorial before
[1:19:19] God I want you to take note of that look
[1:19:22] at the just this th this this principle
[1:19:27] of prayer and being
[1:19:29] sincere and there's a lot of people and
[1:19:31] I know some of them personally I was
[1:19:34] raised up with and they're out I meet
[1:19:35] people all the time they're very sincere
[1:19:39] they have the Bible and they pray and
[1:19:42] God actually answered their prayers
[1:19:45] somehow we in the message think that
[1:19:47] prayers being answering those
[1:19:49] Supernatural things are only to us and
[1:19:51] many of us don't even have that going on
[1:19:53] in our churches
[1:19:56] and I've seen some of these Holiness
[1:19:58] churches and Pentecostal
[1:20:00] churches um I mean some of them look
[1:20:03] cleaner and nicer than some of us in the
[1:20:05] message and we have the quote unquote
[1:20:08] message in the Revelation and here's a
[1:20:11] man he's not in the Covenant with Israel
[1:20:15] he was not there on the day of Pentecost
[1:20:17] as far as we know he does not have the
[1:20:20] the word of of what the Old Testament
[1:20:24] scripture says about the Lamb of God
[1:20:26] taking and breaking those things open
[1:20:29] all he was was devout with this one
[1:20:32] little portion of his life he
[1:20:35] gave and he prayed to God
[1:20:39] always and the angel came to him in a
[1:20:44] dream and told him your prayers and your
[1:20:48] arms have come up as a memorial not that
[1:20:51] I just heard you but there are Memorial
[1:20:56] now that's the isn't that the God we
[1:20:59] serve is he Fair like
[1:21:01] that is
[1:21:04] he if if if a man or a woman would
[1:21:07] dedicate their time in prayer and
[1:21:10] sincerity and honesty to God no matter
[1:21:13] what church they're going to isn't he
[1:21:16] the god like that that will hear their
[1:21:19] prayer
[1:21:20] huh and we put all these hoops for
[1:21:23] people to jump through they don't come
[1:21:24] to my church they're not in me they
[1:21:26] don't believe this they don't know
[1:21:28] nothing about this they just you know
[1:21:30] everybody's like that and that's just
[1:21:31] not the right attitude God doesn't work
[1:21:33] that way he's not a respector of
[1:21:36] persons and notice even when the message
[1:21:39] comes to him and the Lord tells him to
[1:21:42] go send for this man Peter even Peter
[1:21:45] had a problem with going to see this
[1:21:48] man and Peter was a spokesman on the day
[1:21:51] of
[1:21:52] Pentecost says Lord
[1:21:55] I've never eaten anything common or
[1:21:57] unclean and Lord I to show him a vision
[1:21:59] don't call things common or unclean that
[1:22:02] I have
[1:22:03] cleansed so the story goes on a little
[1:22:06] bit take it a little bit further in
[1:22:09] verse 7 and when the angel which spake
[1:22:12] unto cornelus was departed he called two
[1:22:15] of his household servants devout
[1:22:17] soldiers of them that waited on him
[1:22:19] continually he declared all these things
[1:22:22] unto them he sent them to japa
[1:22:25] on the tomorrow they went on their
[1:22:27] journey and Drew nigh unto the city
[1:22:31] Peter went up on the house stopped to
[1:22:32] pray about the sixth hour and he came
[1:22:35] very hungry and would have eaten but
[1:22:38] while they made ready he fell into a
[1:22:40] trans so we see that the Lord came to
[1:22:44] Peter and gives
[1:22:47] him this trance or this
[1:22:50] vision and
[1:22:52] so what I want to take is ver
[1:22:55] verse number 29 27 as he talked with
[1:23:00] them you know so they get these they get
[1:23:02] Peter to come over to corus and corus
[1:23:07] verse 25 and as Peter was coming in
[1:23:09] corus met him and fell down at his feet
[1:23:12] and worshiped him but Peter took him up
[1:23:15] saying stand up I myself also am a man
[1:23:18] and as he talked with him he went in and
[1:23:20] found many that were come together and
[1:23:22] he said unto them you know how that it
[1:23:25] is unlawful thing an unlawful thing for
[1:23:27] a man that is a Jew to keep company or
[1:23:30] come unto one of another Nation but God
[1:23:33] had showed me that I should not call any
[1:23:35] man common or
[1:23:39] unclean therefore I came I unto you
[1:23:42] without gain saying as soon as I was
[1:23:45] sent for I asked therefore for what
[1:23:48] intent ye have sent for me and corneus
[1:23:53] said four days ago
[1:23:55] I was
[1:23:56] what
[1:23:58] fasting until this
[1:24:01] hour and at the ninth hour I prayed in
[1:24:04] my house and behold a man stood Before
[1:24:07] Me In Bright
[1:24:10] clothing I mean how many of us would
[1:24:12] want a visitation like
[1:24:15] that you're not going to be on a video
[1:24:18] your video game and get that visitation
[1:24:21] I don't
[1:24:22] believe you're not going to be gossiping
[1:24:25] you're not going to be indulgent in the
[1:24:27] things of the
[1:24:28] world I I I believe there's it's it's
[1:24:32] you know this this visitation came to
[1:24:35] this man he needed it but look at his
[1:24:39] life look at the
[1:24:40] background and we're talking about
[1:24:42] support and we're talking about our
[1:24:45] closet and prayer and we're talking
[1:24:47] about this great command and many of us
[1:24:50] have made it up in our mind that I'm not
[1:24:52] going to fast unless the Lord puts fast
[1:24:54] on me and therefore many of us don't
[1:24:56] fast at
[1:25:00] all and when we don't when we don't get
[1:25:03] something to eat on that regular
[1:25:04] schedule you I'm
[1:25:07] starving I got to get something to eat
[1:25:09] I'm just
[1:25:11] starving what are they doing that's
[1:25:13] really
[1:25:14] starving in them
[1:25:16] countries and I just want to make that
[1:25:19] um you know bring that to that's part of
[1:25:22] our conduct I believe that a church
[1:25:24] church that is that is praying and
[1:25:28] fasting and doing that in the background
[1:25:32] you might not be up here with the mic in
[1:25:33] your hand you might be a sister or
[1:25:36] brother who doesn't handle the word like
[1:25:39] that or you don't have a what you call a
[1:25:41] position and maybe you don't play any of
[1:25:44] the instruments or maybe we haven't
[1:25:46] called on you for maybe you're just in
[1:25:49] the background but your support can
[1:25:52] start right here and fasting and
[1:25:55] praying you can't get sleep at night and
[1:25:58] you have oppression and depression and
[1:26:00] problems little issues that just won't
[1:26:03] seem to let go you've come to church you
[1:26:06] come to the youth meeting you come to
[1:26:08] the whatever the Bible study you're here
[1:26:10] tonight and you've done all these things
[1:26:13] this is another step you can
[1:26:16] take set aside a
[1:26:19] meal pray call on God with these
[1:26:22] scriptures in mind knowing that God will
[1:26:25] hear and answer your
[1:26:27] request how many believe that
[1:26:29] tonight absolutely he he gave it to us
[1:26:34] this is he he made it very clear Um this
[1:26:39] can go out but nothing but fasting in
[1:26:43] prayer Jesus said that to his disciples
[1:26:45] why they couldn't cast this devil out of
[1:26:47] this boy out of this man he wouldn't
[1:26:50] leave it was stubborn it's something
[1:26:53] that and then you know so this is this
[1:26:56] is part of it this is part of it you you
[1:26:58] know any day of the week anytime you can
[1:27:01] you can do that and it is a sacrifice
[1:27:04] you might you might be hungry you might
[1:27:06] not but that's that's your commitment to
[1:27:10] him on the command part when you fast
[1:27:14] not if you fast when you
[1:27:18] fast wash your face anoint your head
[1:27:20] with oil don't appear like you're
[1:27:22] fasting don't go out here and let
[1:27:24] everybody know I'm fasting you go do
[1:27:26] that you be you do it in secret and when
[1:27:28] you fast and the father that seeth in
[1:27:31] secret will do what openly he'll reward
[1:27:35] you
[1:27:38] openly it's a spiritual
[1:27:40] principle it's part of it and why why
[1:27:44] why shouldn't we use it I believe we
[1:27:45] should and I believe we can add that
[1:27:49] resource of our prayer to fasting amen
[1:27:53] God bless you
[1:27:54] God bless you richly we'll take a few
[1:27:57] prayer requests here tonight that we
