[5:12] score days and put 30 to it and see what
[5:14] you got three and one a half years
[5:16] that's Zach on the dot that's the time
[5:19] that's lotted time for the Messiah
[5:22] message to be preached to Israel like it
[5:24] was back there when he returns back and
[5:27] makes himself known in the symbol that
[5:30] when he come when Joseph was taken down
[5:33] into the country and was rejected by his
[5:36] Brethren because he was a spiritual man
[5:38] he could see visions and interpret
[5:40] dreams and when he did he was taken down
[5:43] into the country and was sold for almost
[5:48] 30 pieces of silver he portrayed Christ
[5:50] exactly because it Christ Spirit me
[5:53] notice what happened there and notice
[5:56] that when he did this he was put in the
[5:59] prison
[6:00] and one man was saved and the other lost
[6:02] exactly Jesus when he was in prison on
[6:04] the
[6:05] cross one Thief was saved and was lost
[6:09] exactly throwed into the grave supposed
[6:12] to be dead and was tuck up and ascended
[6:13] to the right hand of pharaoh that nobody
[6:16] could see Pharaoh without seeing Joseph
[6:18] first Jesus sets at the right hand of
[6:20] God and no man can come to the father
[6:22] except for the
[6:24] son I notice every time Joseph left when
[6:27] Joseph rose up from that right hand of
[6:29] that Throne watch
[6:31] Glory there set Joseph at the right hand
[6:34] of pharaoh and when Joseph raised up to
[6:38] leave that Throne the trumpet sounded
[6:42] bow to e everybody Joseph is coming when
[6:45] that lamb leaves the throne y on his
[6:48] days of M Toral work when he leaves the
[6:51] throne up there and takes that book of
[6:52] redemption and walks forth every KN
[6:56] [Applause]
[6:58] bow
[7:00] there he is notice and when Joseph
[7:05] rejected by his Brethren he was given a
[7:08] gentile
[7:11] wife poner giving or Pharaoh giv him a a
[7:15] gentile wife and he bore Gentile
[7:18] children half Gentile and Jew they give
[7:21] a great symbol of when Jacob was
[7:23] blessing him Ephraim on one side
[7:25] Manasses on the other he crossed his
[7:27] hand and give the younger child the
[7:29] blessing and the two kids was added unto
[7:32] the 12 tribes which is only 10 at that
[7:35] time and he blessed them in Jacob
[7:36] himself and Joseph his Prophet son
[7:39] standing there said father you have done
[7:41] wrong said you put your right hand
[7:43] blessing on the young child where ought
[7:45] to went on the old and he said I know my
[7:47] hands is crossed but God has crossed
[7:49] them why Israel having the rights to be
[7:53] a bride rejected and sold her
[7:55] birthrights and the went from the old
[7:58] son Israel to the new Gentile and the
[8:02] blessings went from there through the
[8:05] [Applause]
[8:10] cross but notice after that see through
[8:14] that when all he had took his bride but
[8:17] when them boys came down to buy
[8:21] food oh it's such a beautiful I'm off of
[8:23] the seal but I just got to say it CU
[8:26] you'll get the picture better I believe
[8:29] notice how when he come down to buy food
[8:33] you know Joseph recognized him right
[8:35] away and Joseph was the son of
[8:37] prosperity no matter where he went it
[8:39] all Place prospered you wait till he
[8:41] comes to the Earth again wait till our
[8:43] Joseph come the desert shall Blossom as
[8:47] a rose and the sun ofous rises with
[8:50] healing in his
[8:52] wings all that Cactus around Arizona
[8:55] will unfold into a beautiful tree to be
[8:58] beautiful
[8:59] notice Harry comes forth and he plays a
[9:03] little trick on him there and he stands
[9:05] and he says is my father still living
[9:07] see you won't know if that boy's father
[9:09] was living he said yes he know that was
[9:11] his brother but did you notice when he
[9:14] got ready to reveal himself to his
[9:16] brother and he found little Benjamin
[9:19] which had been born since he had been
[9:21] gone and that represents these Jews
[9:24] there 144,000 scn right there now than
[9:28] he been gone amen and when he returned
[9:31] he said he looked at Benjamin his heart
[9:33] was about to break and remember they
[9:37] they didn't know he could speak Hebrew
[9:39] he was taking an interpreter he act like
[9:41] he's an
[9:42] Egyptian and then when it was made known
[9:45] he wanted to make himself known he kept
[9:47] looking at little Benjamin and remember
[9:49] he dismissed his wife she was in the
[9:55] palace when he made himself known to his
[9:58] brethren and the Gentile bride the wife
[10:01] after Jesus being rejected by his own
[10:04] people he has taken a gentile bride and
[10:06] will take her from here to the Palace to
[10:09] his father's house in glory for the
[10:11] wedding supper and will slip back down
[10:13] to make himself known to his Brethren
[10:17] [Applause]
[10:21] 14 there he stands and remember look at
[10:24] the symbol perfectly and when he come
[10:27] back the where this why he looked down
[10:30] to them and he said uh he said uh begin
[10:34] to look and they begin to talk they said
[10:36] uh now Reuben you know that we're in for
[10:40] it now see because you know what we done
[10:44] we got this boy in this fix now we ar to
[10:47] sold our brother that was your brother
[10:49] standing there that Mighty Prince and
[10:51] they didn't know it that's the reason
[10:53] Israel can't understand him today and
[10:55] there isn't the hour yet to know it and
[10:57] then he they thought he he couldn't
[10:59] understand Hebrew but he's listening
[11:00] right at
[11:02] him they said now we're in for and
[11:06] Joseph when he looked at him he couldn't
[11:08] stand it no longer I remember his wife
[11:10] and children was in the palace at the
[11:13] time the Saints gone out out of the
[11:17] prison and he said I'm Joseph your
[11:21] brother and he run over and grabbed the
[11:23] Lan fell on his neck and began to
[11:26] cry and he made himself know
[11:29] and then he said now we know we got
[11:32] coming for we sold him we was the one
[11:35] who sold him off we was the one who
[11:37] tried to kill him now we know he'll kill
[11:39] us he said no don't be angry with
[11:41] yourself you only done it to preserve
[11:43] life that's why God sent me down here
[11:46] and when he makes himself known the
[11:48] Bible said as we come to it when he
[11:50] makes himself known to that 144,000
[11:53] there the little Benjamin of the day and
[11:55] the REM of those Jews left there when he
[11:58] makes himself knowing the they'll say
[11:59] where did you get those scars that's
[12:01] right what are they doing in your hand
[12:03] he say oh I got them in the house of my
[12:06] friend oh then they'll realize that they
[12:09] have killed the Messiah but what will he
[12:11] say the same as Joseph did it you did it
[12:14] to serve life don't save life don't be
[12:16] angry with yourself because if the
[12:19] Gentiles would not have been brought in
[12:21] if the Jews hadn't done that blindfolded
[12:23] trick so he saved the life of the church
[12:26] for the things that they've done so
[12:28] there you that's the reason today they
[12:29] can't understand this it isn't the hour
[12:32] no more we can understand these things
[12:33] until the time comes for it to be
[12:35] understood Lord oh my seven thunders of
[12:39] Revelations may show the bride how to
[12:42] prepare for the great translation Faith
[12:45] now let's hurry up because we haven't
[12:48] got about 15 20 minutes yet now what
[12:51] does this white horse mean let me read
[12:53] the I've been so far off excuse me for
[12:55] getting off my subject but U uh I'll
[12:59] read the verse again the two verses and
[13:01] I saw when the lamb had opened one of
[13:02] the seals and I heard as it was a noise
[13:05] of thunder and one of the four be saying
[13:08] come see and I saw and behold a white
[13:11] horse now we're going to the second
[13:13] verse a white horse and he that sat on
[13:16] him had a
[13:18] bowl and a crown was given him he didn't
[13:21] have it
[13:22] then unto him and he went forth
[13:25] conquering and to conquer that's all of
[13:28] that that's the seal now let's find the
[13:31] symbols we found what the thunder means
[13:33] that's perfectly we know that see the
[13:35] Thunder was a voice of God when the seal
[13:38] open now what does a white horse mean I
[13:41] here's where the Revelation com I'm just
[13:44] as positive of this as I'm standing here
[13:46] knowing this is the
[13:49] word I've read every book on it I could
[13:53] find and with uh I the last time and I
[13:57] was trying I had to go through it just
[13:59] teaching it about 30 years ago I took
[14:02] the book somebody had told me that the
[14:05] Adventist had more light on the second
[14:08] coming of Christ than any people that
[14:09] they know so I found some of their good
[14:11] books to read I got Smith's book on
[14:13] Daniel Revelations and he said this
[14:16] white horse that went forth was white
[14:18] and it symbolized a conqueror and in
[14:22] this conquering many of you Adventist
[14:23] bre here knows the book many of you
[14:25] others also about reading it and um Nows
[14:28] I read two or three uh read I can't call
[14:31] there two more books read and both men
[14:33] agreed that that was right and was a
[14:35] fine teacher supposed to be some the
[14:36] best with the best line so I thought
[14:38] well if I don't know I'll just say what
[14:40] they said try to teach it that way they
[14:42] give a very good uh uh exclamation of it
[14:45] what it really meant and they said now
[14:47] here's a white horse and a white horse
[14:50] is a power a charger and said the man
[14:54] that sat on that was the the White Horse
[14:56] was the Holy Spirit that went forth in
[14:59] the early age and conquered that age for
[15:02] the kingdom of God he had a bow in his
[15:04] hand which meant like cupid he shot the
[15:06] arrows of love into the hearts of the
[15:08] people the love of God and he conquered
[15:11] now that sounds very good but it isn't
[15:13] the
[15:16] truth it wasn't white does mean
[15:19] righteous we we realize that the white
[15:21] means righteous the teachers taught it
[15:24] that it was the Holy Spirit conquering
[15:25] in the first age but my Revelation by
[15:30] the holy spirit is not that way my
[15:33] Revelation by the holy spirit is Christ
[15:36] and the Holy Spirit is the self-signed
[15:41] person owning a different form so here
[15:44] stands Christ the lamb we know he was
[15:47] the lamb he standing here at the books
[15:49] in his hand and there goes the white
[15:50] horse
[15:53] rider hey so it wasn't the Holy Spirit
[15:58] uh that's one of the Mysteries of the
[15:59] last days how that Christ can be the
[16:03] three persons in
[16:05] one it's not three different people
[16:07] Father Son and Holy Ghost being three
[16:10] Gods as the trinitarians try to tell us
[16:12] it is it's three it's three
[16:15] manifestations of the same person or you
[16:18] might call it three offices if you're
[16:20] talking to ministers you wouldn't use
[16:22] Office CU I ra happen to think I'm on
[16:24] tape so I'll tell you of course Christ
[16:27] couldn't say I'll pray my office and
[16:28] he'll send you another office we know
[16:30] that but if you want to make it it's
[16:32] three attributes of the same
[16:35] God not three God three attributes of
[16:37] the same
[16:39] God and so how could Christ be out there
[16:43] the White Horse conquering and standing
[16:44] here with a book in his hand it isn't
[16:47] the it isn't Christ
[16:50] notice now the holy spirit in the
[16:54] Revelation and Christ is the holy spirit
[16:57] is Christ and another farm right notice
[17:02] it is the Lamb that opened the
[17:05] books and the lamb is
[17:08] Christ and Christ is not seen
[17:12] anymore from that but he is seen in the
[17:16] Book of Revelations the 19th Chapter
[17:19] coming on a white heart
[17:22] am if you'd like to read it let's turn
[17:24] to Revelations 19 uh 116 let's read it
[17:27] right quick now while we're father we we
[17:29] got enough time I hope s it'll make it
[17:31] just a little better to US 19
[17:35] 1911 begin at the 11th verse and read
[17:38] down including the 16th and I saw heaven
[17:42] open Behold a white
[17:45] heart not on the earth in
[17:49] heaven and he that set on him was called
[17:52] faithful true and righteous does he
[17:55] judge and make war his eyes were flames
[17:58] of fire
[17:59] and on his head was many crowns look at
[18:01] the diadem and he had a name written
[18:05] that no man know but himself I wish I
[18:08] could stop on that just a
[18:12] minute oh my I got a good notion but
[18:16] maybe nobody knows did you ever know
[18:19] that the name of Jehovah is not
[18:22] correct anyone know Dr veale you know
[18:25] that's true the translators could never
[18:27] Translate spelled
[18:29] JV JB hu I mean it isn't Jehovah they
[18:34] couldn't touch
[18:36] it they don't know what it is called it
[18:38] Jehovah but it wasn't his name look
[18:41] every time a victory is won or something
[18:45] goes on a name is changed look at the
[18:49] days of Abraham he was first Abraham and
[18:53] never could have that baby until his
[18:56] name was changed to Abraham
[18:59] and Sarah s a r r a could not have
[19:02] nothing but a dead womb until her name
[19:04] was changed to
[19:07] S Jacob means supplanter deceiver and
[19:11] that's what he did he put sheep skin on
[19:13] himself and deceived his Prophet father
[19:16] to take the birth rights he put popper
[19:18] sticks in the water speckled them Scar
[19:21] the cattle when it was pregnated with
[19:22] the with her young to make speckled
[19:24] cattle and sheep nothing but a deceiver
[19:27] but one night he caught a hold of
[19:29] something
[19:31] real and he know what it was real and he
[19:34] stayed with it and held on until he
[19:37] overcome and his name was changed and
[19:39] called Israel meaning a prince with
[19:42] power before
[19:44] God is that right every Overcomer Simon
[19:48] was a fisherman but when his faith
[19:51] caught in know that with Jesus when he
[19:52] told him he was the Messiah and told him
[19:55] who his name was and what his father's
[19:57] name was he was was overcome and changed
[19:59] from Simon to
[20:01] Peter Saul Good name Saul was a king one
[20:05] time in Israel but he sa didn't fit an
[20:08] apostle might be all right for a king
[20:10] but not an apostle so Jesus changed his
[20:14] name from what from Saul to Paul look at
[20:18] the Suns of thunder and on down and
[20:21] Jesus his name on Earth was Redeemer
[20:25] Jesus when he was on Earth he was a
[20:27] redeemer that's true but when he
[20:30] conquered death and hell and overcome
[20:32] him and ascended on high he received a
[20:34] new
[20:36] name that's the reason you H way they
[20:38] doing they don't get nothing it'll be
[20:40] revealed in the
[20:43] Thunders notice the
[20:46] Mysteries he's coming rioting hallelujah
[20:50] it's got to be something to change this
[20:51] church you know that she's got to be
[20:54] something Hallelujah notice no man know
[20:57] but
[21:00] himself I
[21:02] noticed no man know but himself and he
[21:06] was clothed with a vure dipped in Blood
[21:09] and his name is called the word of God
[21:12] the
[21:14] Lord
[21:19] oh notice and the armies which were in
[21:23] heaven followed him upon white horses
[21:25] clothed in fine linen white and clean
[21:27] and out of his mouth goes a sharp sword
[21:31] that with it he should Smite the Nations
[21:34] and he shall rule them with a rod of
[21:37] iron and he tread The Wine Press of the
[21:40] fierceness of the wrath of almighty God
[21:43] and he had on his vesture and on his
[21:46] thigh a name written king of kings and
[21:49] Lord of lords there comes the
[21:52] Messiah there he is not this fellow on
[21:55] this horse back here watch a different
[21:57] here he stand with the book in his hand
[21:58] here the Redemptive work is just he had
[22:01] took his place yet so it was not the
[22:04] Christ that went forth the Holy Spirit I
[22:06] disagree with that great man no sir I
[22:08] don't do it I wouldn't want to do that
[22:10] but this is what my revelation of it is
[22:13] if you got something different well
[22:14] that's all right but it ain't all right
[22:16] with me I believe it this
[22:20] way and notice Christ is not seen
[22:25] anymore see from the time there but he
[22:30] is on a white horse so if this guy is
[22:33] riding a white horse he's only an
[22:35] impersonator of
[22:39] Christ get
[22:42] that
[22:43] notice the rider on the White Horse
[22:46] don't have any name he might use two or
[22:49] three
[22:51] titles but he hasn't got any name but
[22:55] Christ has a
[22:56] name what is it the word of God that's
[23:00] what in the beginning was the word and
[23:02] the Word was with God and the Word was
[23:04] God and the word made
[23:06] flesh the rider has no name but Christ
[23:10] is called the word of God that's what he
[23:14] is he's called that now he's got a name
[23:16] that no man knows but he's called the
[23:18] word of God this guy is called Nothing
[23:21] see but he's on a white Hearts the
[23:24] writer has no eror as far he's bold did
[23:27] you notice
[23:30] yeah had a b but said about having any
[23:33] arrows so he must be a
[23:42] [Applause]
[23:43] bluffer
[23:46] right maybe he's got a lot of Thunder no
[23:50] lightning but you find out Christ had
[23:53] both lightning and thunder where out of
[23:56] his mouth goes a sharp two- AED sword
[24:00] and he smites the nations with this guy
[24:02] can't Smite
[24:03] nothing Hallelujah but he's playing a
[24:06] part of a hypocrite he's going forth
[24:09] riding on a white horse going out to
[24:11] conquer Christ has a sharp sword and
[24:14] watch it comes from his
[24:18] mouth The Living
[24:20] Word that's word of God revealed to his
[24:23] servants like he said to Moses go stand
[24:26] there and hold that stick out call for
[24:29] flies and there was flies sure whatever
[24:33] he said he done it and it come to pass
[24:36] his Living
[24:37] Word God and His word is a selfs person
[24:42] God is a word who is this mysterious
[24:45] riter of the first church age
[24:49] Dan who is he let's think of it who is
[24:52] this mysterious riter that starts forth
[24:54] in the first church age and rides clont
[24:57] out into eternity goes to the end the
[25:00] second seal comes forth and goes right
[25:02] on out into the end the third seal comes
[25:04] forth and goes right on out into the end
[25:06] fourth fifth sixth seventh every one of
[25:09] them winds right up out here in the end
[25:11] now at the end time these books has been
[25:14] rolled up all this time with these
[25:16] mysteries in them it's broken amen then
[25:18] out comes the mystery to see what it is
[25:21] but actually they started forth at the
[25:23] first church age because the CH First
[25:25] Church age received the message like
[25:27] this
[25:28] a white horse rider went out they really
[25:32] he's Mighty and he's conquering power

[25:40] power you want me to tell you who he is
[25:42] he's the
[25:43] Antichrist exactly what he is now
[25:47] because you see if an antichrist Jesus
[25:51] said that the two would be so close
[25:54] together until it would deceive the very
[25:56] elected the bride if it was possible

[53:20] uplifted hand and brother
[53:24] Joe
[53:26] God bless you Church our precious
[53:28] brother Doug up here wanted us to
[53:29] mention him for a procedure that he's
[53:31] having this week and we certainly hold
[53:33] up his mom in prayer Jackie's joined us
[53:36] a couple of times and we want to
[53:37] remember her I asked brother Israel if I
[53:40] could say something real quick if you
[53:41] don't mind I don't suppose anybody is
[53:44] going to speak up and say that they do
[53:46] but I just love and appreciate each one
[53:49] of you this morning I wanted to say God
[53:50] bless you our you know Merry Christmas
[53:53] God bless you brother Brown say God
[53:54] bless you best thing that we could say
[53:56] to one another so very thankful for the
[53:58] church and this assembly and the stand
[54:00] for the message and and the hour that we
[54:03] live it's a very late hour brother Ben
[54:05] was reminding us us that after our 500
[54:08] a.m. prayer meeting yesterday and just
[54:09] kind of struck me
[54:11] and and he said how we were built for
[54:14] today and this is a golden age and I had
[54:16] remembered brother brandom he talks
[54:17] about the golden age to the Jews and how
[54:19] Solomon and when they took that message
[54:22] and just applied it to their heart and
[54:24] lived it it was a golden age to them and
[54:27] and I didn't remember how brother
[54:28] brandham talked about this being a
[54:30] golden age because of course not
[54:32] everybody has accepted it but we have
[54:34] and we're very thankful and so I just
[54:36] like to read this quote from the
[54:37] invisible Union before we pray if I
[54:40] could brother Brown says I'm thankful to
[54:42] God to be living in this time of the
[54:44] closing scenes of this world's history
[54:47] if I don't know if I would have had a
[54:50] say so before the foundation of the
[54:51] world and God would have laid out the
[54:53] whole program to me said to me I want
[54:56] you to preach and now what age do you
[54:58] desire to go to the Earth to preach I
[55:01] would have chose this age for I think
[55:03] this is the Golden Age and so we're just
[55:07] so privileged to be here and to live in
[55:09] this golden age and of course brother
[55:12] Israel's been encouraging us not to get
[55:15] distracted but strive for that stature
[55:17] of a perfect man and the Born Again
[55:18] experience we had a birth a natural
[55:21] birth a couple of them this you know
[55:23] last month or so and and we're talking
[55:25] about the spiritual application we had
[55:27] two bir births uh you know in process
[55:29] somewh longer some are shorter um we had
[55:32] a long one on Friday I I guess and uh
[55:36] with with baby olant William James is
[55:38] that right so some of them come quick
[55:42] some of them come slow but you know two
[55:44] were were birthed and and baptized and
[55:46] so thankful for that so I just want to
[55:48] encourage everybody let's not get
[55:50] distracted press onward press upward and
[55:54] and strive for the that press for the
[55:56] mark of the high calling in Christ and I
[55:58] was just real thrilled last week if you
[56:00] weren't here you missed there some
[56:02] excitement I guess I'll call it and our
[56:05] precious brother Ezekiel he got in the
[56:07] spirit and came up here and gave gave
[56:09] brother Israel
[56:11] five and that was awesome and I I kind
[56:13] of wanted to do that and I
[56:16] didn't and so then I wanted to run up
[56:18] there and give him a hug for doing it
[56:19] and I didn't and I just cried kind of
[56:21] like I'm doing now my my nephew calls it
[56:23] the uh the Weeping Spirit or something
[56:26] but just so thankful and thrilled to be
[56:29] with you this morning just want to
[56:30] encourage each one so so God bless you
[56:33] this morning let's hold up one another
[56:35] and we all have little differences maybe
[56:38] Joe does things a little differently
[56:40] than you would like him too or we should
[56:42] but let's give one another the benefit
[56:43] of the doubt and the encouragement we
[56:45] all need and let's get get behind the
[56:48] word today and just love our Lord and
[56:50] worship him today so God bless you dear
[56:54] Lord we're so thankful will be in church

[1:18:33] children
[1:18:35] forever that we may do all the words of
[1:18:39] this
[1:18:40] law isn't that powerful one more time
[1:18:43] the secret things belong unto the Lord
[1:18:46] Our God but those things which are
[1:18:49] revealed belong unto us and to our
[1:18:52] children forever that we may do all the
[1:18:56] words of this law that's good amen we'll
[1:18:59] take one more scripture in Matthew
[1:19:01] chapter
[1:19:11] 2
[1:19:20] verse number seven
[1:19:24] then Herod when he had privately called
[1:19:26] the wise men inquired of them diligently
[1:19:30] what time the star appeared and he sent
[1:19:33] them to Bethlehem and said go and search
[1:19:37] diligently for the young child and when
[1:19:40] we have when ye have found him bring
[1:19:44] word again that I may come and worship
[1:19:46] him also when they had heard the king
[1:19:49] they departed and lo the star which they
[1:19:51] saw in the east
[1:19:53] went before them till it came and stood
[1:19:55] over where the young child was and when
[1:19:58] they saw the star they rejoiced with
[1:20:01] exceeding great joy amen and when they
[1:20:03] were come into the house they saw the
[1:20:05] young child with Mary his mother and
[1:20:08] fell down and worship him and when they
[1:20:10] had opened their Treasures they
[1:20:13] presented unto him gifts gold and
[1:20:17] frankincense and
[1:20:20] myrr and let us pray Lord Jesus Jesus we
[1:20:23] ask your blessing on your word we pray
[1:20:25] in Jesus name amen God bless you you may
[1:20:28] be
[1:20:29] seated last Sunday night I it's kind of
[1:20:33] a an unusual kind of a a different topic
[1:20:37] or subject I call
[1:20:39] it um laying in the presence of the son
[1:20:43] of
[1:20:45] man and that would be my subject and
[1:20:49] then maybe for a title this morning
[1:20:53] unwrap the
[1:20:54] deity unwrap the deity this God's great
[1:20:59] gift that has to be
[1:21:01] unwrapped and like any gift Christmas
[1:21:05] time you can move too
[1:21:07] quickly or you can unwrap it too
[1:21:11] slowly but there's a timing and there's
[1:21:13] a delicacy as you unwrap the gift
[1:21:17] depending on what kind of gift there is
[1:21:19] inside and as we uh move forward in the
[1:21:22] word we thank the Lord for the great
[1:21:24] Revelation that has come to us in this
[1:21:27] our day and um we've shared with you
[1:21:32] where the Apostle Paul had warned about
[1:21:36] the maturity of the word and how that
[1:21:39] you should be teachers and yet you're
[1:21:42] still behaving as
[1:21:44] children and if we look across and I
[1:21:46] gave this example to the church last
[1:21:48] Sunday that if brother random was to
[1:21:51] look into our assembly or let's say he
[1:21:54] sat in the back of one of our assemblies
[1:21:57] and were to examine me preach are you
[1:22:01] song Lead are you Worship the Lord or
[1:22:03] doing whatever we're doing in the name
[1:22:06] of this great message would he be
[1:22:10] pleased would there be a uh thumbs up
[1:22:14] would there be a uh hey you need to work
[1:22:17] on that would there be that
[1:22:20] critical or would we be right on target
[1:22:23] and I'm just talking about a man William
[1:22:25] brandham how much more our lord Jesus
[1:22:28] and so just putting those things in line
[1:22:30] and perspective here this morning this
[1:22:34] great deity that has come I'll read for
[1:22:37] you a quote here where brother vam he
[1:22:40] talks about
[1:22:42] this um God's Gift always find their
[1:22:45] places in
[1:22:48] 1963 paragraph number
[1:22:51] 52 he says this here God's gifts always
[1:22:55] find their places now gold in the Bible
[1:22:58] how fitting it fits to Christ because
[1:23:00] gold speaks of deity gold is deity we'll
[1:23:05] get to it in just a moment frankincense
[1:23:08] speaks of service and myrr is death God
[1:23:12] deity in service to die and that's what
[1:23:16] he was the very thing that they brought
[1:23:21] identified what they thought he was and
[1:23:24] I say that to us today the things that
[1:23:27] we bring to him identifies what our
[1:23:31] thoughts is about
[1:23:34] him I want you to think about that the
[1:23:37] way you worship the way you prepare the
[1:23:39] way you come the way you throw it on the
[1:23:41] altar or set it on the altar or uh
[1:23:45] respectfully lay it on the altar that's
[1:23:48] how you think that's a that's a enter
[1:23:52] enter view of how you think about what
[1:23:56] we're doing here
[1:23:58] today and I say that to us today the
[1:24:00] things that we bring to him identifies
[1:24:03] our thoughts what our thoughts is about
[1:24:06] him you understand what I mean see if
[1:24:09] you're if you believe it with all your
[1:24:10] heart every word of that you'll identify
[1:24:14] it by giving all that you have to it see
[1:24:19] but if you believe it's a good place to
[1:24:21] associate with better people around
[1:24:23] church and things like that that's just
[1:24:25] about what you give just a few social
[1:24:29] hours with some congregation or
[1:24:31] something but if you if you really
[1:24:33] believe it with all your heart then you
[1:24:36] give everything that's in you to it see
[1:24:39] and it identifies you amen that you
[1:24:43] truly believe the message Hallelujah
[1:24:46] that you believe it to be the
[1:24:48] truth so what you give identifies you
[1:24:52] yeah amen it shows you where you stand
[1:24:56] and where whether you really believe the
[1:24:59] message and you give your whole heart to
[1:25:01] it we don't have to convince you that
[1:25:04] this is right we don't have to pump you
[1:25:07] into praise we don't have to keep it
[1:25:11] interesting for you it's already
[1:25:13] interesting that's why I came cuz
[1:25:16] something caught my interest that's why
[1:25:19] I'm praising the Lord I'm not praising
[1:25:21] the Lord looking over here looking over
[1:25:23] here I'm I'm looking up praising the
[1:25:26] Lord this has this has nothing to do
[1:25:30] this has nothing to do with what other
[1:25:33] church members are doing this has
[1:25:35] nothing to do with what everybody else
[1:25:38] is doing this is about My Worship to
[1:25:41] [Applause]
[1:25:42] him amen Lord open my eyes to who I'm
[1:25:48] praising and worshiping open my eyes why
[1:25:52] I even came here this morning open up my
[1:25:55] eyes
[1:25:56] Lord of the value of coming in your
[1:25:59] presence amen amen amen amen praise the
[1:26:03] Lord Brother brandom I'll read this
[1:26:06] again this morning he talks about the
[1:26:08] different attitudes that people have
[1:26:11] depending on where where where the way
[1:26:14] they are taught he says that in the how
[1:26:17] the angel came to me
[1:26:19] 1953 paragraph number three it's been
[1:26:22] one of the most amazing things that I've
[1:26:23] noticed along the lines of my Ministry
[1:26:26] for our lord Jesus is the peculiarity of
[1:26:29] the people and the study of human life
[1:26:33] is one of the greatest things that a
[1:26:35] person can study to watch the N watch
[1:26:39] nature of people and the different parts
[1:26:41] of the Nations and the worlds to where
[1:26:44] you go you'll notice that there are
[1:26:46] different there's a different attitude
[1:26:49] that people take towards Christ towards
[1:26:52] his service towards his um servants
[1:26:56] towards worship and one of the things
[1:26:59] has been that one type of meeting will
[1:27:02] just be wonderful in one part of the
[1:27:04] country okay where it won't work in
[1:27:06] other part of the country now I believe
[1:27:09] mostly to blame for that or not to blame
[1:27:12] but mostly is the way the people are
[1:27:17] taught and the church will never live
[1:27:19] higher than its Pastor teaching
[1:27:23] it's not just live higher than his
[1:27:24] Pastor live higher than his Pastor
[1:27:27] teaches amen so what teaching are you
[1:27:29] listening to you seldom find that if you
[1:27:32] got a good sound saying gospel teacher
[1:27:34] you usually find that type of a church
[1:27:37] it's where you're Pastor leads you the
[1:27:39] pastor that you feed on
[1:27:41] so um brother Brandon makes that
[1:27:45] clear that these the different attitudes
[1:27:48] that people take it's because of the way
[1:27:53] uh the way that they are taught the way
[1:27:56] that they learn and let's say we've all
[1:27:59] been under the tape teaching we claim
[1:28:02] that don't we and the tape teaching is
[1:28:04] mature teaching it's solid teaching it's
[1:28:08] not babies it's not skin milk it's not
[1:28:11] patting people on the shoulder it's not
[1:28:13] cutting corners for people God is not
[1:28:16] going to grade on the curve he's got a
[1:28:18] standard and everybody has to come
[1:28:20] through to be a son or daughter of God
[1:28:23] and that's this message that we have
[1:28:25] received amen and so if we're really
[1:28:28] listening to that teaching our life
[1:28:30] should bear witness of that true amen
[1:28:33] the way we give should bear witness to
[1:28:35] that the way we worship God the way we
[1:28:40] give the way we even think about other
[1:28:43] people the way we approach this Bible
[1:28:47] that's correct it should be reflected
[1:28:49] upon the way the prophet approached his
[1:28:52] Bible amen I believe that with all my
[1:28:54] heart and I believe that these great
[1:28:58] truths and Mysteries they're
[1:29:01] surrounded with types they are and
[1:29:05] shadows and their symbolism that's
[1:29:08] correct it's like well Lord why don't
[1:29:09] you just tell us what you're saying I
[1:29:11] was reading in Zechariah Chapter 1 and
[1:29:14] two where it talks about a red horse
[1:29:16] rider just in my daily time reading this
[1:29:19] week and the prophet Z said what what
[1:29:23] meanthis red horse rider and then the
[1:29:27] angel brings him the interpretation of
[1:29:30] what the red horse rider was glory and I
[1:29:33] thought well if you're going to give me
[1:29:35] the interpretation why we even talking
[1:29:38] about a horse anyways why is all this
[1:29:41] mystery
[1:29:42] surrounding you see and I believe that
[1:29:45] you know with symbolism and mystery and
[1:29:50] things that are hidden and things that
[1:29:52] have to be uncovered and revealed it
[1:29:54] takes energy for that and it takes
[1:29:57] people who really are
[1:30:00] interested and so you can't just walk by
[1:30:03] and catch a glancing conversation that
[1:30:06] the Lord is having and say okay I got
[1:30:07] the cliff notes I'm out of here no no
[1:30:11] you've got to what what did you say Lord
[1:30:14] what was that what does that
[1:30:15] mean how does that impact my life I mean
[1:30:20] you have to develop a prayer life for
[1:30:23] God to speak to you and for you to
[1:30:26] understand what he's saying one thing
[1:30:28] he'll speak to you it's another thing
[1:30:30] for him to unpack what he is actually
[1:30:33] telling you he gives a vision with
[1:30:37] symbols and then the symbols have to be
[1:30:39] broke down that's correct but we're so
[1:30:41] impatient we don't even wait for that to
[1:30:43] happen that's correct and it really
[1:30:45] reveals who we are and what we are it
[1:30:48] brings the interest up and those that
[1:30:50] are interested will stay
[1:30:52] and those that don't don't understand
[1:30:54] they'll still stay they'll wait they'll
[1:30:57] wait eat my flesh drink my blood what
[1:31:00] are we talking about here Lord these are
[1:31:03] Mind Games you're playing tricks why
[1:31:05] don't you just tell us and they come to
[1:31:07] Jesus says why do you speak to us in
[1:31:10] Parables he says so that in seeing they
[1:31:13] won't
[1:31:15] see and hearing they won't hear but to
[1:31:20] you yes sir I have given
[1:31:24] you a
[1:31:26] patience a a shut up and sit down be
[1:31:30] quiet until I get done talking you got
[1:31:33] to wait on me you ain't going to you're
[1:31:35] not going to run this Revelation at your
[1:31:39] pace I need to know right now Lord no
[1:31:42] you're going to sit down and you're
[1:31:44] going to wait on the Lord and you're
[1:31:47] going to wrestle it out with the angel
[1:31:49] and when God gets through with you
[1:31:53] it will be a perfect work it won't be an
[1:31:55] overnight thing you'll be a a a building
[1:31:59] that was made with real material am
[1:32:04] solid stuff good stuff stuff that can
[1:32:08] take a punch stuff that can get a hit
[1:32:11] and keep coming that's what the whole
[1:32:14] Bible is made up of
[1:32:16] Believers yes sir who have been punched
[1:32:19] hit and they struggled and they've gone
[1:32:22] through what they've gone through and
[1:32:24] they kept
[1:32:26] coming hit that little woman that San
[1:32:29] woman called her daughter and her people
[1:32:32] her race he called her race
[1:32:35] dogs
[1:32:37] race
[1:32:39] race is it a Hot Topic oh you don't woke
[1:32:43] up now you asleep race let's talk about
[1:32:45] the best race there is oh that'll wake
[1:32:48] up any crowd and Jesus hits her on her
[1:32:53] race this wasn't given to your
[1:32:56] race they're
[1:32:59] dogs and right there a half of
[1:33:02] Christianity runs off he called me a dog
[1:33:05] I'm out of her he call me but she stayed
[1:33:07] right with it didn't she what she had
[1:33:10] the Believers
[1:33:12] have and that's a
[1:33:14] tenacity and that's the ear to hear oh
[1:33:17] my this ear to hear is how God speaks to
[1:33:21] his children and he unveils
[1:33:24] himself little by little Page by Page
[1:33:29] like this here quote by quote you like
[1:33:32] read like you like move on I can't move
[1:33:36] on I'm wrestling with this right here
[1:33:38] move on I can't move on God is dealing
[1:33:40] with me right here and that's the way
[1:33:43] Revelations work you don't have to say
[1:33:45] Amen if you don't see it but when you do
[1:33:48] see it you will say amen hallelujah
[1:33:51] sometimes you got to wait and let the
[1:33:53] Lord reveal it to you then it becomes
[1:33:57] real to you then you can bring that to
[1:34:00] your prayer life and that is called
[1:34:03] Faith that's right and that's how you
[1:34:05] please the lord it's with your faith for
[1:34:10] it's impossible to please him without it
[1:34:13] and so this this uh great revelation of
[1:34:17] what came down in our day this great uh
[1:34:21] light
[1:34:22] amen you know it's interesting how
[1:34:24] Herod he didn't know nothing about what
[1:34:27] the star was and what the King was or
[1:34:29] anything but he maned to some people who
[1:34:31] did and so instead of him developing a
[1:34:35] prayer
[1:34:36] life studying the scriptures for
[1:34:39] himself he try to hire somebody to get
[1:34:42] him a
[1:34:45] revelation okay y'all go find him for me
[1:34:48] and when you find them come get
[1:34:53] like you go to Sunday school I can't
[1:34:55] make it I'm
[1:34:56] tired but you go to Sunday school and
[1:34:58] tell me what they
[1:35:00] said give me all the highlights from the
[1:35:03] sermon and when you get it all together
[1:35:05] then come bring it over to me while I'm
[1:35:07] in my pajamas and my Christmas sweaters
[1:35:11] and no no no this is what har is is you
[1:35:14] you go find them you go find him he
[1:35:16] didn't develop a prayer life he didn't
[1:35:18] ask God to show him nothing he he tells
[1:35:20] these guys go get him go get him and
[1:35:23] then come back and tell me where this
[1:35:26] Christ is so I can worship him too to a
[1:35:28] believer that don't even sound right
[1:35:30] that's right amen that's right amen I
[1:35:33] mean it's like I'm going to get this
[1:35:34] Revelation and come back and tell you
[1:35:36] for what you wouldn't value it if I gave
[1:35:39] it to
[1:35:40] you you would you you would treat it as
[1:35:43] something cheap because you didn't pray
[1:35:45] for it yourself you never studied it
[1:35:48] yourself and it's sad that many
[1:35:51] Believers are sitting in our churches
[1:35:54] and they've developed an attitude
[1:35:56] towards a
[1:35:58] revelation because of something they
[1:35:59] heard that somebody else said but
[1:36:01] they've never studied it for
[1:36:04] themselves Jesus said in St John chapter
[1:36:07] 5 verse 39 search the
[1:36:11] scriptures for in them you have eternal
[1:36:15] life search them correct you take the
[1:36:19] scriptures you search it for
[1:36:22] yourself and then when I ask you who I
[1:36:25] am you'll have an answer from your heart
[1:36:29] it will be sincere it will be genuine it
[1:36:32] won't be what somebody else is telling
[1:36:34] you to say Amen so this great Open Door
[1:36:39] uh Ministry that brother bradam uh has
[1:36:43] brought in this last day in questions
[1:36:46] and answers he says this here Church of
[1:36:49] the Living God I'm sorry and this is in
[1:36:51] the message uh uh the world is again
[1:36:54] falling apart 1963 paragraph 146 the
[1:36:57] Church of the Living God the bride moves
[1:36:59] right on just the same she'll go in the
[1:37:02] Rapture by the word that's right the
[1:37:05] word and the word will come together if
[1:37:08] we're a part of Christ part of it we
[1:37:11] have to be his word CU he is the word
[1:37:14] right yes sir they have refused the
[1:37:17] anointed Word of Promise of this age and
[1:37:20] he's all always the word if God sent us
[1:37:24] an anointed promised word again for this
[1:37:27] age in
[1:37:28] 1946 he would be the same he was when he
[1:37:32] come in the beginning the anointed word
[1:37:35] for the age now he saying this is 1963
[1:37:39] actually Hebrews 138 throws it right
[1:37:42] back in your lap and says he is the same
[1:37:45] yesterday today and forever that's
[1:37:47] exactly right and he would stay with the
[1:37:49] father's promised word for this age if
[1:37:53] Jesus comes he would be just exactly
[1:37:55] what the word said it would be in this
[1:37:58] age 148 paragraph 148 says that's what
[1:38:02] Elijah was in his age that's what Moses
[1:38:07] was in his age that's what Noah was in
[1:38:10] his age that's what everywhere every
[1:38:14] Prophet ever come the word when it come
[1:38:16] in its fullness the entire word made
[1:38:19] flesh Among Us
[1:38:21] it did just exactly what it said it
[1:38:23] would do in that age if it would come
[1:38:27] today he would be just exactly Jesus
[1:38:32] Christ Living out his promise of what he
[1:38:35] promised to do just as the word amen can
[1:38:39] I get a
[1:38:40] witness questions and answers
[1:38:44] 1964 questions and answers number two
[1:38:46] 1964 brother bam says this here
[1:38:49] paragraph 49 so being a well-trained
[1:38:53] theologian had nothing to do with it
[1:38:55] being Meek and gentle had nothing to do
[1:38:58] with it what made him different he was
[1:39:00] the word made flesh not the word for the
[1:39:03] day of Moses Moses was that day word not
[1:39:07] the word for the days of Noah Noah was
[1:39:10] the word for that day not the word for
[1:39:14] the Days of Elijah Elijah was the word
[1:39:16] for that day but he was the present
[1:39:19] tense word
[1:39:21] and they were living in the back the
[1:39:24] same thing
[1:39:27] repeats that's the evidence of the Holy
[1:39:30] Ghost when God reveals to you and you
[1:39:33] see it thus sayeth the Lord and accept
[1:39:36] it not what you are what you was or
[1:39:39] nothing about it it's what God has done
[1:39:42] for you now there's the evidence yes sir
[1:39:47] amen so brother bam is bringing this
[1:39:49] word made flesh Moses Elijah Noah all
[1:39:55] those days going by Jeremiah word made
[1:39:58] flesh and here it is again today the
[1:40:02] word made flesh a Vindicated Prophet
[1:40:05] that God has used in this hour for the
[1:40:08] office of bringing the entire fullness
[1:40:12] of the word to his people to God's
[1:40:15] people amen let's take a little bit
[1:40:17] further in the message the trial 196
[1:40:22] 4 and we'll get into why this confuses
[1:40:25] people
[1:40:26] sometime and you have a group of people
[1:40:29] that they'll make um they'll make
[1:40:32] brother
[1:40:33] Bram is something in the scriptures that
[1:40:36] God never made him they'll make him
[1:40:38] Christ or God and they'll want to
[1:40:40] baptize in his name or Worship in his
[1:40:42] name or remove the Lord
[1:40:45] Jesus um and salvation and they they go
[1:40:49] over for over overboard on on that side
[1:40:51] over there because of the word being
[1:40:54] made flesh in our day and then you have
[1:40:55] another group of people who will
[1:40:57] minimize who he was and try to make him
[1:41:01] just like a regular you know like a
[1:41:02] Billy Graham or Oral Roberts or a nice
[1:41:05] fine preacher or Minister that had a
[1:41:07] gift this is more than just a man who
[1:41:10] had a gift this was the word for an age
[1:41:14] this was a turning
[1:41:16] Corner this was a very PIV pivotal
[1:41:19] pivotal time
[1:41:21] in your church uh Bible History and as
[1:41:25] brother Joe read the quote we're living
[1:41:27] in that golden age where we're seeing
[1:41:30] things that other people wanted to see
[1:41:33] they wanted to see the end time like how
[1:41:35] we have it here and brother brandom
[1:41:37] tells us in the trial
[1:41:41] 1977 he
[1:41:44] says 1964 paragraph 76 Jesus said as it
[1:41:49] was in the days of Sodom when the son of
[1:41:51] man is being
[1:41:53] revealed in the days of the son uh in
[1:41:56] the days of Sodom when the son that was
[1:41:59] God revealed in human flesh which was
[1:42:02] one time called
[1:42:03] MDC the father MDC at that time had no
[1:42:07] father no mother no beginning of days no
[1:42:10] ending ending of life ever who he was he
[1:42:14] Remains the Same Jesus had father and
[1:42:17] mother but this man had neither father
[1:42:20] nor mother mother and he appeared to
[1:42:22] Abraham in the form of a son of man
[1:42:27] Elohim Jehovah the church now has served
[1:42:32] the term through the church age in the
[1:42:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost but Jesus said
[1:42:37] here to make Malachi 4 and the rest of
[1:42:40] the scriptures real to you see that in
[1:42:44] the last days just before the coming the
[1:42:48] world is will be setting will be like
[1:42:51] Sodom and the son of man will reveal
[1:42:53] himself as the son of man like he did in
[1:42:56] the days of Sodom blind
[1:43:00] prosecutor can't you see that his words
[1:43:04] are true they are not nail scars and
[1:43:07] prints and
[1:43:09] Thorns it's the Son of God impersonated
[1:43:14] in his church as son of man it has to
[1:43:19] fulfill malach 5 4 and the rest of the
[1:43:23] scriptures I call to the Court's
[1:43:26] attention look at that real good son of
[1:43:30] man like God the Father God the son God
[1:43:34] the Holy Ghost it's the same God three
[1:43:37] different attributes of the same God now
[1:43:39] this is son a man revealed then as a
[1:43:44] prophet son of David the king now the
[1:43:47] Son of God to the church ages and God
[1:43:49] isn't man God God is the spirit and the
[1:43:51] spirit's son is the Holy Ghost which is
[1:43:55] revealing the church age but promis here
[1:43:59] in the last days that the son of man
[1:44:02] would be revealed amen now this office
[1:44:06] of the son of man is the office of a
[1:44:08] prophet it's not the office of a pastor
[1:44:12] or an evangelist although a son a man a
[1:44:15] prophet can do those works it's not the
[1:44:17] office of just a teacher or brother so
[1:44:20] or Reverend so and so that has a local
[1:44:23] Ministry for a time period maybe in you
[1:44:26] know whatever country he's from his
[1:44:28] little church or whatever he's doing
[1:44:30] that's a local Ministry local pastors we
[1:44:33] have many of those thank God for them
[1:44:35] but the office of the son of man is the
[1:44:37] office of a Prophet this is a prophetic
[1:44:41] anointing a major prophet that is sent
[1:44:45] to
[1:44:46] reveal and to impersonate the son of God
[1:44:51] in this office of the son of man now
[1:44:54] this office of the son of man we see
[1:44:57] Ezekiel had that office Jeremiah had
[1:45:00] that office and here we are again this
[1:45:04] uh office you know the Reverend William
[1:45:06] brandham was a son of man he was not the
[1:45:11] son of man Capital the son of man is the
[1:45:15] Lord Jesus Christ but here is a son of
[1:45:18] man revealing
[1:45:21] the son of man in the last days that's
[1:45:24] amen amen and so when we realize that
[1:45:27] that's what's taking place that's what's
[1:45:29] on the tapes that's what the message is
[1:45:32] then we know this is not a junior word
[1:45:35] this is not a word underneath the bible
[1:45:38] or let's try to fight it against the
[1:45:40] word this is the same thing that wrote
[1:45:42] your Bible that's what it is your Bible
[1:45:46] was written by men who were moved of God
[1:45:51] words of the prophets pinned and then
[1:45:54] recorded and put together and called The
[1:45:57] Bible and God's Great message of this
[1:46:00] day is a continuation of what the Bible
[1:46:03] said would be here in the last day amen
[1:46:07] so we don't argue them one against the
[1:46:10] other on we don't the Bible said this
[1:46:12] but the prophet said this that's that's
[1:46:14] a different spirit that does that that's
[1:46:18] somebody who hasn't got a revelation
[1:46:21] where they worshiping the Lord at amen
[1:46:24] you know Jesus said this but Peter said
[1:46:27] this you know one baptized this I'll
[1:46:30] take what Jesus said over what Peter
[1:46:33] said you know you need to go and pray
[1:46:35] and ask God to reveal to you you don't
[1:46:38] read your Bible that way that's right
[1:46:40] this part is Anointed but this part is
[1:46:42] not that anointed and we'll read this
[1:46:44] part and it's a little Junior anointing
[1:46:46] and this has more deity and this has
[1:46:48] less you don't read your Bible that way
[1:46:50] way it's all God it's the word of the
[1:46:53] Lord and God uses men throughout the
[1:46:56] entire scriptures and when the
[1:46:59] Revelation comes to you you'll see that
[1:47:00] this message is all
[1:47:05] God hallelujah more popular to say that
[1:47:08] maybe years ago is becoming less popular
[1:47:11] today but we're going to take a stand on
[1:47:14] God's word amen praise the Lord so here
[1:47:18] brother brandom is talking about the
[1:47:20] blind prosecutor it's not nail scars and
[1:47:25] prince it's not the Jesus at Calvary
[1:47:29] that he's speaking of here but we're
[1:47:32] talking about the Jesus that came back
[1:47:35] and revealed his word to the people at
[1:47:39] the closing of the Gentile
[1:47:42] dispensation he promised he would come
[1:47:44] back church amen and he did come back
[1:47:49] and he brought us a beautiful word is it
[1:47:51] isn't it nice you know I've been in the
[1:47:54] message for 30 plus years or more 40
[1:47:57] years almost something like that and you
[1:48:00] know the tapes still burn in my heart
[1:48:03] yes amen they still make me weak yes
[1:48:06] they still bring tears to my eyes still
[1:48:09] moves me I thank God there's there's no
[1:48:13] CNN program there's no news organization
[1:48:16] there's no movie what there is no book
[1:48:19] that move moves me like the Bible and
[1:48:22] the word of God moves us because we
[1:48:25] we're one with that amen amen God bless
[1:48:28] you so much amen this is not the nail
[1:48:31] scars he says blind prosecutor who's he
[1:48:34] talking to Blind prosecutor can't you
[1:48:37] see it's his words are true it's not
[1:48:40] nail scars and prints and Thorns it's
[1:48:44] the Son of God impersonated in his
[1:48:49] church that's a strong statement but who
[1:48:52] said it it that's a strong statement but
[1:48:55] who's supposed to repeat it who's
[1:48:59] responsible to unpack that Revelation to
[1:49:02] realize that's for us and for our
[1:49:06] children you got to repeat these things
[1:49:09] to your children God gave them to you
[1:49:13] and they're very very precious and some
[1:49:16] people step over it they kick over it
[1:49:19] they'll throw it to the side in the weed
[1:49:20] pile we don't need that we don't
[1:49:22] understand it I you trying to make
[1:49:24] yourself he's trying to make himself you
[1:49:26] know they said all of those things but
[1:49:28] still these are the statements that were
[1:49:31] made in our day and it
[1:49:34] separates but there are beautiful
[1:49:36] Revelations when you can catch it there
[1:49:39] is a beautiful gift laying inside when
[1:49:43] God Reveals His word to you can I go a
[1:49:46] step further spiritual food and due
[1:49:48] season brother banam says this here but
[1:49:50] now God has promised us paragraph
[1:49:54] 160 promised us these things in the last
[1:49:57] days in Malachi 4 said that Jesus Christ
[1:50:01] would come down and impersonate
[1:50:04] himself Amen in human flesh like he did
[1:50:09] at Sodom amen that's right and that the
[1:50:12] world would be in the Sodom
[1:50:15] condition and as it was then the son of
[1:50:17] man will be revealed that day see
[1:50:20] this son of man that come down in the
[1:50:23] form of a man which was Elohim by
[1:50:26] Abraham before the promise son came look
[1:50:29] what it was Abraham said it was God and
[1:50:32] the Bible said there was three men came
[1:50:34] to him dust on their clothes travel sat
[1:50:37] down eat like men and Jesus said just at
[1:50:40] the time the world gets in a Sodom
[1:50:42] condition then the son of man will
[1:50:44] reveal himself again not Son of God Son
[1:50:47] of Man see would reveal
[1:50:50] himself
[1:50:52] s now so what's the prophet telling us
[1:50:55] there says that God he said that in
[1:50:59] Malachi 4 that Jesus Christ would come
[1:51:02] down and impersonate himself in human
[1:51:06] flesh like he did at Sodom that's right
[1:51:08] and said that the world will be in a
[1:51:11] Sodom condition so we see that this is
[1:51:15] not the office of a missionary or a
[1:51:18] pastor right this is the office of a
[1:51:22] Vindicated Prophet to come down and
[1:51:27] impersonate himself in human flesh now
[1:51:30] we all are Tabernacle tabernacling deity
[1:51:34] we all have a portion of the Holy Ghost
[1:51:36] in us as Sons and Daughters of God that
[1:51:40] brings us into the new birth and if God
[1:51:42] has a son it will be a Son of God he'll
[1:51:45] be a daughter of God absolutely we're
[1:51:48] bone of his bone life of his life Jee
[1:51:50] and so forth but to in order for the
[1:51:53] fullness to come down and manifest he
[1:51:56] chooses a vessel yes that didn't choose
[1:52:00] himself chooses a vessel that actually
[1:52:03] tried to drink tried to smoke but the
[1:52:06] angel said don't drink or smoke there'll
[1:52:09] be a work for for you to do when you get
[1:52:11] older gave him that commission as a
[1:52:14] little boy didn't read the scripture to
[1:52:17] him too young didn't interpret what his
[1:52:20] life would mean Too Young just simply
[1:52:23] told him don't drink don't smoke I got a
[1:52:25] work for you to do when you get older
[1:52:27] but he got older didn't he and the
[1:52:29] pressures of Life hit him just like it
[1:52:31] hits any teenager or any young man or
[1:52:34] young woman and he got pressured
[1:52:36] remember that and his uncle in the
[1:52:38] family pressured him and called him a
[1:52:42] and you know he didn't want to
[1:52:44] take a drink it wasn't his intention to
[1:52:46] take a drink but the pressures of Life
[1:52:49] pushed him to try to take a drink and he
[1:52:52] went to go take a drink and that
[1:52:55] presence came down and protected that
[1:52:59] vessel now true he'll he can always be
[1:53:03] saved if he took a drink just like some
[1:53:06] of us took drink more than one drink
[1:53:08] some of us took several drinks amen but
[1:53:11] God's blood redeemed us and saved us but
[1:53:14] here is a vessel that he did not allow
[1:53:17] him to take a tree did not allow him to
[1:53:20] put the cigarette and smoke it why why
[1:53:23] was that this is not just a pastor it's
[1:53:27] not just any ordinary Ministry this is
[1:53:30] Once in a generation this is once in
[1:53:33] historical terms of the Gentiles we have
[1:53:37] never seen a light like this come down
[1:53:41] never happened before and it won't ever
[1:53:44] happen
[1:53:46] again amen am I yelling too loud loud no
[1:53:51] no no this is uh this is Prime real
[1:53:55] estate in in history speaking yes amen
[1:53:59] if you can preach brother Brandon where
[1:54:00] would you want to preach he had all the
[1:54:02] ages he could have picked out but he
[1:54:05] wanted to preach in the same age that
[1:54:07] I'm living in amen and we can't even
[1:54:10] shout and praise the Lord you know them
[1:54:13] old saints that they said you going to
[1:54:15] dance what age would you want to dance
[1:54:17] in I want to dance in that age and we're
[1:54:20] in this age we won't even dance well
[1:54:23] God's going to give us our dance back
[1:54:24] ain't
[1:54:26] he look at your neighbor and
[1:54:29] says the Lord's going to give me my
[1:54:32] dance back Are you ashamed to
[1:54:35] dance I'm talking about dancing for the
[1:54:39] Lord Lord give me my dance back give me
[1:54:44] the
[1:54:45] victory that's all I want is the victory
[1:54:48] if I get the victory Victory with the
[1:54:51] victory comes a
[1:54:53] [Music]
[1:54:57] dance yes sir dancing started in the
[1:55:00] church dancing started in heaven the
[1:55:03] world don't know nothing about they got
[1:55:04] all these dances they call this move and
[1:55:06] that the dirty chicken and the Funky
[1:55:08] whatever they call it they ain't got no
[1:55:10] kind of dancing like what we
[1:55:12] got don't nobody know how to dance like
[1:55:15] a son and daughter of
[1:55:17] God Can Dance before the Lord because
[1:55:22] he's been so good to them and he's
[1:55:25] revealed to them and give them the joy
[1:55:27] of the Lord
[1:55:29] amen HJ yes
[1:55:32] sir
[1:55:34] amen huah so he kept he protected this
[1:55:37] vessel didn't he and this is ABCs for
[1:55:40] many of you but this is new material for
[1:55:43] some of you but he kept this vessel uh
[1:55:46] pure and clean for the purpose of
[1:55:49] manifesting in this great
[1:55:51] anointing that will be re represented to
[1:55:55] the
[1:55:56] Gentiles impersonating the Son of God
[1:55:59] again now there's a danger line in
[1:56:03] there we'll get into that just for a
[1:56:05] moment look what happened at lot this is
[1:56:08] in the invisible Union of the bride of
[1:56:09] Christ look what happened to Lot and
[1:56:12] them down in Sodom look at Billy Graham
[1:56:14] Oral Roberts them down them down there
[1:56:17] amongst those denominations look at the
[1:56:19] elected Abraham
[1:56:22] Church pulled
[1:56:24] out look at what kind of sign that Jesus
[1:56:27] himself the
[1:56:30] incarnated
[1:56:32] God standing there in human flesh you
[1:56:35] say that was an angel the Bible said it
[1:56:38] was God Lord God Elohim standing there
[1:56:43] in human flesh showing that he would so
[1:56:46] anoint his church in the last days it be
[1:56:50] God working in human flesh again as it
[1:56:54] was in the days of Sodom so shall it be
[1:56:56] at the coming of the son of man all
[1:57:00] right can I go a little bit further
[1:57:01] Saints we got service
[1:57:04] tonight no service tonight oh I got
[1:57:07] plenty of time is that what you're
[1:57:10] saying God bless all right I love
[1:57:15] preaching God's word to the people who
[1:57:19] believe
[1:57:20] it look at this message here I just take
[1:57:23] a few more moments and then I won't hold
[1:57:25] you long all right the prophet of God
[1:57:28] says here in one in a million yeah
[1:57:33] paragraph number 10 and he is supposed
[1:57:37] to according to the
[1:57:40] scriptures Return To Us in this last
[1:57:43] days and this type of ministry that will
[1:57:47] be after the baptism of the spirit and
[1:57:50] speaking in tongues Divine Healing and
[1:57:52] so forth these things the capping of the
[1:57:56] Pentecostal message is what we're
[1:57:58] speaking of
[1:57:59] today this ministry of Christ himself
[1:58:04] impersonated among his people with the
[1:58:07] very same things that he did when he was
[1:58:09] here on Earth in his body the bride
[1:58:12] which is part of him doing the same
[1:58:15] things as husband and wife or King and
[1:58:18] Queen just before the marriage ceremony
[1:58:21] amen all
[1:58:25] right let's take one more on this then I
[1:58:28] got a couple things I want to say
[1:58:30] here in the anointed ones at the end
[1:58:33] times brother brandom says this
[1:58:34] paragraph
[1:58:38] 259 put another scripture here Luke
[1:58:41] 17:30 Malachi 4 as Janice and jambers
[1:58:44] withstood Moses the anointed word of the
[1:58:47] hour so will these men not
[1:58:49] man men anointed ones resist the truth
[1:58:55] correct in the very day that the son of
[1:58:57] man is revealed Revelations 10 1-7 read
[1:59:02] it when you get home the seventh Angel's
[1:59:04] message opening up the seals what is it
[1:59:09] not the angel is the son of man that's
[1:59:12] right but the messenger yes is revealing
[1:59:15] the son of man yes can you get it
[1:59:18] separated now that's where it seems to
[1:59:20] be hard for you you see not the son of
[1:59:23] man himself but the seventh angel the
[1:59:26] seventh messenger is revealing to the
[1:59:30] public the son of man because it left
[1:59:34] the Shu he can't organize it it's the
[1:59:37] grain itself again we had a hard time
[1:59:39] getting this one last time last Sunday
[1:59:42] help her out sis brother we'll get it we
[1:59:46] finally got it but I don't know why we
[1:59:47] got stuck on this one I think my numbers
[1:59:50] here are different than their numbers
[1:59:52] there but the devil don't want me to
[1:59:54] read it but how many will wait for us to
[1:59:56] get it right so I can read it and then
[1:59:59] you can read it then after I read it and
[2:00:01] you read it who going to say Amen we got
[2:00:03] time amen who going to say
[2:00:05] amen
[2:00:08] amen
[2:00:10] pardon give it the words all right in
[2:00:12] the very
[2:00:15] day the son of man is
[2:00:18] revealed
[2:00:20] in the very day the son of man is
[2:00:24] revealed Revelations 10
[2:00:27] 1-7 read it when you get home the
[2:00:30] seventh Angel's message opening up the
[2:00:33] seals what is it not the angel is the
[2:00:36] son of man but the messenger is
[2:00:40] revealing the son of man can you get it
[2:00:43] separated now that's where it seems to
[2:00:45] be so hard for you you see not the son
[2:00:49] son of man himself but the seventh angel
[2:00:52] the seventh messenger is revealing to
[2:00:57] the public the son of man because it's
[2:01:01] left to shook he can't organize it it's
[2:01:05] the grain itself
[2:01:08] again so who is revealing to the
[2:01:13] public a son of man is revealing the son
[2:01:17] of manre the seventh angel
[2:01:20] Ministry which your pastor your preacher
[2:01:23] your priest the brothers who started
[2:01:25] Works missionary efforts this brother
[2:01:27] who started a church preached for 40
[2:01:29] years that brother who established the
[2:01:31] work who sent the message over here
[2:01:33] those are great Brothers they're pastors
[2:01:36] they are not Angel messenger they're not
[2:01:39] the seventh angel messenger so this
[2:01:42] separates just an ordinary Pastor or
[2:01:45] Ministry this is the seventh angel
[2:01:48] Ministry
[2:01:49] which happens to be the ministry of a
[2:01:52] son of man revealing the son of man can
[2:01:56] I get a
[2:01:57] witness and it's revealing it to the
[2:02:00] public
[2:02:02] now the danger with this is there is
[2:02:07] there can be a danger line here is that
[2:02:11] when we run with these quotes like this
[2:02:14] and many brothers have then they can
[2:02:18] make it sound like we're making this
[2:02:23] ministry here this ministry here we'll
[2:02:27] make the prophet Jesus Christ and we'll
[2:02:31] replace the prophet we'll replace Jesus
[2:02:34] Christ with the
[2:02:36] prophet and we've seen that done it
[2:02:38] actually happened on the tapes and
[2:02:40] brother bandam corrected and that's what
[2:02:42] we want to deal with here just for a
[2:02:44] moment these are these are True
[2:02:47] Believers so first of all you have to be
[2:02:49] in the camp of
[2:02:51] Believers to even go so far to think
[2:02:56] that this was
[2:02:59] this true so people just glancing by and
[2:03:03] walking by criticizing they'll never get
[2:03:06] to the stage to think that a Vindicated
[2:03:09] Prophet was the anointed
[2:03:12] Christ and so the this um this happening
[2:03:17] takes place in the message it was going
[2:03:19] on for a number of years I'm going to
[2:03:21] finish up my message I have several
[2:03:23] quotes I'll finish up my message here
[2:03:26] because I had I've had this and I and
[2:03:29] I'll say this very carefully because I
[2:03:30] know some of the brothers are you know
[2:03:33] that that might hear or whatever they
[2:03:35] might say or think but I've noticed that
[2:03:40] with Revelation brothers who get
[2:03:42] revelation of these deeper things a lot
[2:03:46] of times there's Pride that goes with it
[2:03:48] sure and there's arrogancy that comes
[2:03:51] with it and then they start cutting
[2:03:54] people off and they start making and I
[2:03:57] say they we start you know making
[2:04:00] something a word test to test whether
[2:04:03] you are bride or not and you got two or
[2:04:07] three quotes or 10 quotes or seven
[2:04:08] quotes whatever it is and you'll meet
[2:04:11] somebody out here in the parking lot in
[2:04:12] the special meetings the brother up
[2:04:14] there preaching whoever preach whatever
[2:04:16] he preached you wasn't listening because
[2:04:19] he wasn't using your catchphrases
[2:04:21] anyways but you going to straighten
[2:04:23] everybody out in the parking lot though
[2:04:24] ain't you cuz you got these quotes right
[2:04:28] am I talking by myself they might know
[2:04:29] what I'm talking about and they they
[2:04:31] reach you they catch you out there and
[2:04:33] they take these few little quotes here
[2:04:36] and they give you the word
[2:04:39] test and if you don't pass it right now
[2:04:42] brother Kirk I'm going to tell all my
[2:04:45] friends that he ain't seeing it she
[2:04:48] ain't seeing it bunch of dead birds they
[2:04:52] don't have the Revelation right cuz they
[2:04:54] didn't pass my word
[2:04:59] test
[2:05:00] well well I've seen that and I've had
[2:05:03] that attitude
[2:05:05] myself I remember when
[2:05:08] um when there was a an effort to
[2:05:12] franchise the
[2:05:14] message I wasn't supposed to go here but
[2:05:16] I'm here now and I remember I got so
[2:05:20] upset at somebody that would not fall in
[2:05:23] line with what was going on in in um in
[2:05:27] Jeffersonville I'll just say it like
[2:05:29] that and I was upset with that someone
[2:05:32] would try to come against and so forth
[2:05:35] so I develop a a very bad attitude for a
[2:05:38] group of people brother George that I
[2:05:41] never even
[2:05:43] met exactly what the news will do to you
[2:05:47] the news will have you mad at people
[2:05:50] that you've never met and probably never
[2:05:52] will meet and you over here on the
[2:05:54] Southside stressing out over something
[2:05:57] you heard about in the news with people
[2:06:00] you'll probably never even meet in your
[2:06:04] life that's true and so I know it's
[2:06:08] going to get quiet here so let's get
[2:06:11] quiet so I develop this
[2:06:14] attitude the hypocrisy the Hypocrites
[2:06:18] the
[2:06:19] Believers these people that can't get
[2:06:21] this Revelation all a while I should be
[2:06:25] praying and reading my Bible and feeding
[2:06:28] on the
[2:06:29] message the message didn't come for me
[2:06:33] to become some kind of uh word test
[2:06:35] Giver or some kind of like teacher over
[2:06:38] to go around seeing who got it and who
[2:06:40] don't got it I don't have time for it
[2:06:44] you don't have time for it the coming of
[2:06:47] the Lord is at at
[2:06:49] hand pick up your Bible pick up the
[2:06:53] message and bring it to the Altar and
[2:06:56] stay there until you're
[2:07:00] changed and ready for the
[2:07:03] Rapture that's what this message is
[2:07:06] for so but but I've seen this accompany
[2:07:13] some
[2:07:14] pride I've seen this accompany some
[2:07:18] arrog can see and even you'll see it in
[2:07:21] the scriptures where Paul was sick he
[2:07:24] was buffeted with this sickness and he
[2:07:26] sought the Lord three times he says Lord
[2:07:29] take this away of he says because of the
[2:07:33] abundance of
[2:07:34] what You' seen too much you know too
[2:07:38] much I've sent a messenger to keep you
[2:07:42] on your knees God help us God help us
[2:07:45] what have we seen today help us Lord I
[2:07:48] sent the message Meer of Satan to Buffet
[2:07:50] you because of the abundance of
[2:07:52] Revelations all right so brother bam
[2:07:55] here is dealing in this this is
[2:07:58] 196 um 1 Revelations chapter 5 and I'll
[2:08:03] have to close here God bless you
[2:08:04] Brothers you Saints he says
[2:08:08] and that brings me to leads me to say
[2:08:11] something that I would rather run than
[2:08:14] say it leads me to say something that it
[2:08:16] grinds my heart to the bot to say it but
[2:08:20] what I say I am forced to say realizing
[2:08:23] that this is being taped and the world
[2:08:26] will hear it but I have I have left the
[2:08:30] ministry for a cause that I'm sorry that
[2:08:33] I have to leave it for and perhaps many
[2:08:36] of you have heard it I I closing my
[2:08:39] office and so forth and leaving the
[2:08:41] field I don't know where our Lord will
[2:08:43] lead me to and that I have no control of
[2:08:46] of whatever he will have for me to do
[2:08:50] but I'm thinking at the end of the road
[2:08:51] where I must come down a long life's
[2:08:54] journey I have made so many mistakes
[2:08:56] that I'm very sorry from my heart of
[2:08:59] because of I guess being human and
[2:09:02] weakness and so forth causes a person to
[2:09:05] do things or say things and even act
[2:09:09] that they would not want to act
[2:09:11] otherwise but being the weakness of
[2:09:14] human being we have those times yes if
[2:09:18] there's anything that has been in my
[2:09:20] heart to do was to hear those words of
[2:09:22] our Lord Jesus at the end of the journey
[2:09:25] to say it was well done my good and
[2:09:27] faithful servant and many times I've
[2:09:29] said it I I like to have been standing
[2:09:32] there when he said come up unto me but I
[2:09:35] did desire to hear it say Well done that
[2:09:38] I did not hear the voice in the original
[2:09:40] say come unto me back in the times of
[2:09:43] the writing of the Bible but I do desire
[2:09:45] to hear it say well done ver paragraph
[2:09:50] 25 drop down a little bit he says
[2:09:52] because of that it forces me to say I'm
[2:09:55] leaving the ministry because that there
[2:09:58] is something arose up among the people
[2:10:03] that caus me to do it that is they have
[2:10:07] been taken they that I have been taken
[2:10:11] from the bracket of a minister or a
[2:10:14] brother and being called Jesus Christ
[2:10:18] and So-Cal and that would brand me an
[2:10:21] antichrist and I'll meet God as a
[2:10:23] quitter before I would meet him as an
[2:10:26] antichrist to take away from him yes I
[2:10:29] heard of it a few years ago and I
[2:10:31] thought it was a joke I met a couple
[2:10:34] breth which I don't see neither one of
[2:10:36] them in the meeting this morning two or
[2:10:37] three of them one time in a fishing trip
[2:10:41] and they approached me by the subject of
[2:10:44] saying brother brandom aren't you the
[2:10:47] anointed Messi Messiah the Christ and I
[2:10:50] put my arms around the neck of both
[2:10:52] Brethren or all of them and I said
[2:10:54] Brethren as much as I tried to be a true
[2:10:57] servant of Christ I would not have
[2:11:01] you I would not that you would say such
[2:11:04] things as that and if it would ever be
[2:11:07] said of me then I would leave the field
[2:11:09] with a clear conscience and you who do
[2:11:12] that will be
[2:11:14] responsible for every soul that I would
[2:11:17] have saved during that time see for
[2:11:20] taking me from the field and I thought
[2:11:23] that ended it and he says he heard of it
[2:11:26] a few more times and Skip on to
[2:11:28] paragraph number
[2:11:30] 31 and brother bam here gives us the
[2:11:33] reason why they do
[2:11:35] this I never really caught this but it's
[2:11:38] part of the ministry yes it is in
[2:11:41] paragraph 31 he says I went to the Lord
[2:11:43] here not long ago when I heard it about
[2:11:46] a year ago and then I went went to the
[2:11:48] Lord and He referred me to the scripture
[2:11:51] that when John came forth preaching that
[2:11:54] they hadn't had a prophet on Earth for
[2:11:57] so many years until it would they was
[2:12:01] All Amazed in their hearts thinking
[2:12:03] maybe John was the Messiah so then I
[2:12:06] John they went and asked him and he said
[2:12:09] that he was not you read that in Luke
[2:12:12] the 3r chapter the 15th verse so but
[2:12:15] that kind of quiet it down so I let it
[2:12:18] go like that but then when it come to
[2:12:21] this then I know that something must be
[2:12:25] done I say this that the visions and the
[2:12:28] angel of the Lord that appeared at the
[2:12:29] river if this is to be my last message
[2:12:32] or the last thing to the church to the
[2:12:33] world those things are truth as far as
[2:12:37] the angel of the Lord so here brother
[2:12:39] brandham is bringing a correction to the
[2:12:42] some brethren who are made him from a
[2:12:47] minister to be in the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:12:50] and so he goes to the Lord and the Lord
[2:12:52] refers him to the scripture and shows
[2:12:55] him that in the scripture because it had
[2:12:58] been so long like never for us that a
[2:13:04] prophet had come to the
[2:13:07] Gentiles on such a magnitude you talk
[2:13:11] about a Vindication brother George it's
[2:13:14] like overly Vindicated it's like so
[2:13:18] Vindicated you can't you don't know
[2:13:20] where to start and to stop on the
[2:13:22] Vindication of what happened in this day
[2:13:25] and it been so long we hadn't seen one
[2:13:28] so this is where this comes fromen the
[2:13:31] people are so excited they're good
[2:13:35] people they are actually
[2:13:38] believers they just need to be
[2:13:41] adjusted they need to be corrected they
[2:13:44] need to be put back into their right
[2:13:46] place but these were
[2:13:48] followers of John's Ministry followers
[2:13:52] of brother bram's
[2:13:53] Ministry but it went so
[2:13:57] far that he had to do something about it
[2:14:00] and I think a
[2:14:02] pastor would have to do the same thing I
[2:14:05] think of a pastor is preaching something
[2:14:08] and the people start to put him in the
[2:14:10] place that he is not that Pastor should
[2:14:13] have the character and the wherewithal
[2:14:16] to tell the people people to
[2:14:19] stop that is not how this is going I am
[2:14:22] not what you say even though it seems
[2:14:24] like a com it seems like a you know a
[2:14:26] compliment it seems like but we've seen
[2:14:28] it over the years have you has been
[2:14:31] around the message you seen these camps
[2:14:33] group and they got their main speaker
[2:14:35] their main man and they got him up there
[2:14:37] I wonder if he tried to stop
[2:14:41] them amen well brother Bron put him to
[2:14:44] the stop Glory I'm leaving the
[2:14:49] filled because this isn't right let's go
[2:14:52] a little bit further a few more moments
[2:14:53] all right
[2:14:57] it let's drop down to paragraph number
[2:15:00] 36 I thought I'd rather die here in the
[2:15:03] woods like I fell on my gun or
[2:15:05] something I seen then I thought about my
[2:15:08] little Joseph and so forth that he'd be
[2:15:11] raised and I was in no condition to hunt
[2:15:14] so I just left the woods and come home
[2:15:17] I've been tore up about 8 or 10 days and
[2:15:19] such a fix I thought I was losing my
[2:15:20] mind I just ask everybody to stay away
[2:15:23] from me and I and let me alone cuz I'm
[2:15:26] in such a fix and nervous and upset and
[2:15:29] all tore to pieces and I wondered if it
[2:15:32] would have been some enemy of mine it
[2:15:35] would have been all right right but I
[2:15:37] would have just laughed it laughed at it
[2:15:40] and went on but when it come to be
[2:15:42] precious Brothers precious sisters then
[2:15:45] that's what hurt me and and I said
[2:15:49] Lord the I said Lord the great things
[2:15:52] too great for me I'll just have to walk
[2:15:55] out and leave it in your hands I don't
[2:15:57] know nothing else to do and a few nights
[2:15:58] ago to make it sure I had a visitation
[2:16:01] from the Lord and I seen a precious one
[2:16:04] a babying a serpent which was a yellow
[2:16:08] and black telling me right along and the
[2:16:11] thing struck me on the leg but the blood
[2:16:13] was so rich it didn't take effect on me
[2:16:17] I looked down there and there's where it
[2:16:20] had bit before and I turned quickly with
[2:16:23] the gun and shot the thing and it hit it
[2:16:26] right in the middle of the thing and the
[2:16:28] brother said I turn with my gun to shoot
[2:16:30] his head off and he says don't do that
[2:16:32] just picked up the stick laying there by
[2:16:34] you when I turned my back to pick up the
[2:16:36] stick it wiggled in some some water just
[2:16:39] a small puddle of water I said Well it
[2:16:42] can't hurt very much longer now because
[2:16:45] I believe that the brother realizes the
[2:16:47] bre that that would that would happen I
[2:16:50] said it's mortally wounded so it'll die
[2:16:55] and I ask many of you members of my
[2:16:57] church here in this Tabernacle with
[2:16:58] brother
[2:17:00] Neville uh that's come approaching me
[2:17:02] with the same question brothers and
[2:17:04] sisters haven't I tried to be a true
[2:17:06] servant of Christ before you haven't I
[2:17:08] tried to be your brother now wherever it
[2:17:11] is it's a spirit on precious people many
[2:17:15] people has asked me that but it's a
[2:17:19] spirit but I hope that today that it
[2:17:22] receives a deadly wound and will die out
[2:17:25] quickly so I can return back to the
[2:17:28] ministry and remember if you ever
[2:17:30] believe me if you ever believe me to be
[2:17:32] a servant of Christ
[2:17:34] remember that is an
[2:17:37] error that is a error it's falsely thus
[2:17:40] sayeth the Lord It's Wrong have nothing
[2:17:43] to do with it I am your brother can I
[2:17:47] get a witness he said it's an
[2:17:50] error have nothing to do with it it is
[2:17:55] wrong so that was in June the 11th 1961
[2:17:59] and so a few days
[2:18:01] later uh June the 18th seven days later
[2:18:05] a week later he's preaching Revelations
[2:18:07] chapter 5 number two and he's dealing
[2:18:11] with
[2:18:12] this um you know it's interesting how he
[2:18:16] brings this out I want you to Terry with
[2:18:18] me just for a
[2:18:19] moment he brings out Matthew chapter 18
[2:18:23] when a a brother is taken in a fault or
[2:18:26] when there's two people that disagree
[2:18:28] how you bring a witness and then you
[2:18:30] tell it to that witness if they won't
[2:18:32] hear you bring it to the church so he's
[2:18:36] actually dealing with that and he
[2:18:39] actually uh says that's what he did in
[2:18:43] that service that we just read for you
[2:18:46] and so he's you know it's a beautiful
[2:18:48] understanding or teaching or how you
[2:18:50] know the Matthew 18 and some people will
[2:18:52] you'll take it many different ways when
[2:18:54] the brothers you know have ought with
[2:18:57] one another you bring them together they
[2:18:59] won't listen bring a witness he won't
[2:19:01] listen then tell it to the church if he
[2:19:03] won't listen then he's a heathen and a
[2:19:05] Publican that's Matthew chapter 18:1 17
[2:19:09] but here brother Bram is referring to
[2:19:12] what he said on the tape that he did
[2:19:15] what that scripture said to do and
[2:19:17] referring to those Brothers this take
[2:19:19] it's a little bit of a quote but I'll
[2:19:21] read it for you and I trust it'll be
[2:19:24] blessing to you all right everybody okay
[2:19:27] praise the Lord this is the prophet now
[2:19:29] he's dealing with this spirit that is a
[2:19:32] spirit it got upon Believers not
[2:19:36] unbelievers not halfway these are True
[2:19:38] Believers the closest of the closest the
[2:19:41] ones who really saw who he was and
[2:19:43] brother bam is dealing with it a week
[2:19:45] later he says now Pastor I'm I'm going
[2:19:47] away this paragraph 32 being your
[2:19:51] assistant with you here in the work of
[2:19:52] the Lord as Paul would say I charge you
[2:19:55] before God and the elect Angels into
[2:19:57] this church here there's a perfect
[2:20:00] example on what to do if somebody gets
[2:20:02] out of order in the church see now if
[2:20:06] there comes something up in the church
[2:20:08] that's not right then let the individual
[2:20:11] who knows that that's not right go to
[2:20:13] the
[2:20:14] person and if the person will not be
[2:20:17] Recon then the next thing to do is to
[2:20:19] take a witness and go or maybe one or
[2:20:22] two witnesses and go to this person to
[2:20:25] get them reconciled or get the things
[2:20:28] straightened out now listen close now
[2:20:31] this is being taped also and then if if
[2:20:33] that don't work don't never let a little
[2:20:37] ISM a little something another a little
[2:20:42] bad feeling ever rise up among you give
[2:20:47] get it out of the way right now so
[2:20:50] that's it's time it's the little fox
[2:20:53] that spoils The Grapes you know so keep
[2:20:56] it out of the way any little funny um
[2:21:00] feeling go and tell the person to it's
[2:21:03] say I'm wrong I don't feel right toward
[2:21:05] you or something help me to pray over it
[2:21:09] that I'll get better because we don't
[2:21:10] want nothing but just purely the
[2:21:13] unadulterated holy spirit of God Among
[2:21:15] Us that's all we want then will the
[2:21:19] giftss and things will work right and
[2:21:21] everything will be coming right why have
[2:21:24] half a church when you can have a whole
[2:21:25] one why accept a substitute when the
[2:21:28] whole skies are full of the genuine see
[2:21:31] we don't want that so if a little funny
[2:21:34] feeling ever comes up among with you
[2:21:38] members one to another you go to that
[2:21:42] person now do does that happen to church
[2:21:45] people little funny feelings sure but
[2:21:49] not in here right not in this church we
[2:21:53] don't have funny feelings in this church
[2:21:54] do
[2:21:57] we yes we
[2:21:59] do that's why it's written in the Bible
[2:22:02] like before you got here before you had
[2:22:04] the funny feeling it already was dealing
[2:22:07] with your funny feeling so when you got
[2:22:09] your funny feeling you know to go to the
[2:22:11] word you're not supposed to build up a
[2:22:14] team of people Amen to talk about how
[2:22:17] offended they were how they offended you
[2:22:20] and build up a group of people to you
[2:22:23] know to build up a team of how they they
[2:22:26] did you wrong you're not supposed to do
[2:22:27] that Jesus said not to do that you go to
[2:22:30] the person the Bible says
[2:22:32] alone amen amen amen he said brother
[2:22:36] Israel we're supposed to be Jingle Bells
[2:22:38] and Merry
[2:22:41] Christmas
[2:22:44] well this is your Jingle Bells this is
[2:22:47] your gift all right Merry Christmas to
[2:22:49] you if there's a funny
[2:22:52] feeling take the word of the Lord forget
[2:22:57] about the Christmas tree get that funny
[2:22:59] feeling out of you right and here
[2:23:03] brother bradam is dealing with it in his
[2:23:05] own Ministry but this is the real one
[2:23:08] this is with people that were making him
[2:23:10] something that wasn't scriptural and so
[2:23:13] there is a warning in this great
[2:23:15] revelation of this son of man yes there
[2:23:18] is am yes there is there is a way we
[2:23:21] have to walk and carry ourselves because
[2:23:24] Spirits are not
[2:23:27] Prejudice they'll get on
[2:23:31] anybody
[2:23:33] amen amen is that right we're not beyond
[2:23:36] that funny feelings a bad Spirit we're
[2:23:39] not Beyond any of that so brother Adam
[2:23:41] is dealing with it here and he says now
[2:23:45] Satan will constantly punch punch at you
[2:23:48] MH
[2:23:50] amen paragraph
[2:23:56] 36 now remember now if you have error or
[2:23:59] fault against your brother if your
[2:24:01] brother has has something against you
[2:24:04] but if a brother has something against
[2:24:05] you see go to him and be reconciled tell
[2:24:08] him that you've had a strange feeling
[2:24:10] about him going to make it friends and
[2:24:12] pray and go down at the altar and get
[2:24:15] the thing out of the midst of you now
[2:24:17] Satan will constantly punch at you until
[2:24:20] you're finished here on Earth just
[2:24:22] remember that you'll never have a time
[2:24:25] but what there's a punching going on all
[2:24:28] the time cuz you're in a battle did you
[2:24:31] ask to come to Christ going to a picnic
[2:24:34] that's right well you're sure going to
[2:24:36] be
[2:24:37] surprised because it's a constant battle
[2:24:40] I've been on the field for 31 years I
[2:24:43] fought every inch of the way that's
[2:24:45] right Israel had to fight every inch of
[2:24:48] the way Palestine was given to them but
[2:24:51] they had to fight every inch of the way
[2:24:52] to get it now remember this now then if
[2:24:56] there's something comes up in the church
[2:24:59] then let the pastor and if you if you
[2:25:01] have to come get the pastor to take him
[2:25:04] to the person then if they won't hear
[2:25:06] that then come up before the church and
[2:25:09] tell it before the church give them so
[2:25:11] much time to be reconciled maybe from
[2:25:14] one Sunday to the next and if they will
[2:25:16] not not hear the church then the Bible
[2:25:18] said let them be as a heathen and a
[2:25:23] Publican let's see as long as they are
[2:25:25] protected by the church Satan cannot get
[2:25:28] to them but when the church looses them
[2:25:31] from under the protection of the church
[2:25:34] and the blood of Christ then Satan will
[2:25:36] go to work on them that'll bring them
[2:25:39] right into reconciliation again see you
[2:25:42] understand that don't you Pastor yes sir
[2:25:45] so that's the thing to always remember
[2:25:47] to do is to be reconciled come to God
[2:25:51] and go God's way what does that prove to
[2:25:54] us two or three of our Brethren that
[2:25:57] knows that I've labored under this other
[2:25:59] one for two or three years that's right
[2:26:03] but when it come to the place I thought
[2:26:06] as them man I could finally love those
[2:26:08] men enough they can they can't get away
[2:26:12] from it and I took Witnesses but that
[2:26:15] didn't work I had to bring it to the
[2:26:17] church and then from the pulpit last
[2:26:20] Sunday I said don't I don't want to hear
[2:26:23] it one more time I'm free from it I turn
[2:26:27] it over to God see and commit it back to
[2:26:30] him and it immediately it shows that
[2:26:32] those people were called now if they had
[2:26:35] been when they come to the scripture
[2:26:38] correction and the man can't stand the
[2:26:40] scripture correction he gets all angry
[2:26:42] and blows up it shows he's not right
[2:26:44] with God right but a genuine saint of
[2:26:48] God will be reconciled to God by the
[2:26:51] word that's right and the word is the
[2:26:54] correcting way those Brethren ought to
[2:26:56] be very thankful to God that see the
[2:27:00] Bible said false Christ would rise in
[2:27:02] the last days and would deceive the very
[2:27:04] elected if it was possible but it's not
[2:27:07] possible no sir the elected was for
[2:27:09] ordained so they will not be deceived
[2:27:12] you see so soon as them brothers they
[2:27:14] come up there at the house the next day
[2:27:17] see even till they got and had begin to
[2:27:20] give me their scripture and the Holy
[2:27:23] Spirit by the scripture just condemned
[2:27:26] everything they were saying you see so
[2:27:29] there it was they seen the elected group
[2:27:32] of people walk out in the presence of
[2:27:33] God it makes me thankful for people like
[2:27:35] that yes sir that's real men when you
[2:27:39] can see a man that's wrong and proven
[2:27:41] wrong then that shows he wants to be a
[2:27:44] Christian he walks up and says I'm wrong
[2:27:46] wrong that's a real Christian your
[2:27:51] brother Adam says they actually came up
[2:27:53] to his house with the scripture and was
[2:27:56] trying to show him and he just condemned
[2:27:58] the whole thing with the scripture
[2:28:00] they're trying to convince brother
[2:28:02] brandham and he condemned the whole
[2:28:03] thing with the scripture he said brother
[2:28:05] Israel why would you preach on a message
[2:28:07] like this and Christmas and visitors
[2:28:09] come because they won't come during the
[2:28:12] year this is when you can hear
[2:28:15] it this this is the this is the time to
[2:28:18] preach on these things when we got you
[2:28:22] here I was going to close 30 minutes ago
[2:28:24] but it's too many visitors here I got to
[2:28:26] keep I got to keep
[2:28:28] moving you guys want to see the you know
[2:28:31] the Christmas tree you want to see hear
[2:28:33] about Jingle Bells or something but we
[2:28:36] don't have no Jingle Bells we have joy
[2:28:39] Bells though huah the joy of the Lord is
[2:28:43] our
[2:28:44] strength we talk about that and if these
[2:28:46] things get right then man what a
[2:28:48] wonderful
[2:28:50] Christmas what a beautiful Christmas we
[2:28:52] can have if these things are right but
[2:28:55] here the prophet is showing us that even
[2:28:57] true
[2:28:59] believers had this happened to them and
[2:29:03] this great gift that God has wrapped and
[2:29:06] sent to us in this day is not the man is
[2:29:11] the gift although we see the man is
[2:29:14] gifted life but what was he magnifying
[2:29:17] he was
[2:29:18] magnifying the
[2:29:20] Lord
[2:29:22] Jesus
[2:29:23] Christ he was magnifying it in our lives
[2:29:27] and bringing it to a full manifestation
[2:29:32] that we too amen as
[2:29:35] Believers if we lay in the presence of
[2:29:38] this son that we too will
[2:29:43] ripen and we will get all the immature
[2:29:46] green things out of us and we'll become
[2:29:50] into His Image we want to give God our
[2:29:54] best that's correct amen that's correct
[2:29:58] and I don't know how to worship him
[2:30:00] until he reveals to me how to worship
[2:30:03] Him amen like I've said many
[2:30:07] times if you really want to give me a
[2:30:10] gift the best gift that I get is when I
