the form of a minister or your mother Christ appears to you in people then treat everybody right be kindly be neighborly be loving Christ is the person Christ in you the hope of glory and as you go along and people appears to you a kind person speak to you listen to them you don't know it might be Jesus speaking to you see he appears I'll be with you even in you and as you do unto these do to me oh when you get to look at it at looking at it that way the old tradition Falls away see it doesn't become a form of words and a declaration of so many words put together it becomes a living reality

opportunity Lord to come into the presence of your word today we ask you to bless us now bless every heart we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you God bless each of you w we welcome you to the house of the Lord tonight we like to go right into the word how many's glad to be here can somebody say praise the Lord praise the praise the Lord Saints amen so good to be here with you welcome each of you in the scriptures second Timothy chapter number four verses 1-5 we have taken the Wednesday night we started back oo back in February and then we took conduct order in Doctrine and we took uh conduct and then we went through the order and now we want to start into the doctrine we probably just do two or three services on that so the Lord willing we'll be able to finish it all in the month of May but let's read the scriptures and then I can have you seated amen a CH charge thee therefore this is 2 Timothy 4: 1 through 5 I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth we're seeing that take place now and shall be turned unto fables but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full full proof of thy Ministry amen we'll take one more scripture in the Old Testament Deuteronomy chapter 32 when you have that you can say amen and verse number one give ear oh ye heavens and I will speak and hear oh Earth the words of my mouth my Doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall d as the de as the small rain upon the tender herb and as the showers upon the grass because I will publish the name of the Lord ascribe ye greatness unto our God Amen the importance of sound Doctrine that's what we'll title this uh tonight may God add a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow heads Lord Jesus we ask your blessings on the word tonight bless our time together here Lord may you speak to our hearts fill us Lord with wisdom and insight Lord according to your riches and Glory pour out a divine revelation Upon Us Lord so not just words but something that you would bring to each heart is our prayer build us up in the Most Holy Faith is our prayer Lord if there be anyone weak or feeble in their faith may you strengthen them tonight in the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you you may be seated the importance of sound Doctrine you know this word Doctrine means something received that is instructions learning teaching Insight that's the the the's def definition of that word Doctrine from the Hebrew word leak it is all throughout the scripture many many scriptures talking about the doctrine and then maybe I'll take a few you know some folks and I encourage you to do it you have a little something on your mind or heart that little suggestion box in the back there you can write uh sometimes somebody will put a tape in there a good tape to listen to or a thought that they have our suggestion and we got we get those from time to time and we had a few and maybe I'll read one or two of those the Lord will help us amen and this sound Doctrine we'll find it throughout the scripture so what we did Saints is we took um conduct order and Doctrine and then the conduct we talked about our Behavior at the post of Duty forsake not the assembling of your yourselves giving your best how we dress uh fasting and prayer that was under the conduct and then we took a few services on the order I believe we started that with law having a shadow 19544 we played a portion of that tape then mzc received tithes the Holy Spirit government sovereignty of the local church each local church and then the sovereignty of the local church again and then we finished that with the remainder of that tape law having a shadow and um I've been getting good reports and good feedback from the Saints from some of the words that we have been bringing and this these little messages they haven't been too too long I don't think and uh we' just been blessed going through them very simple it's what we already know and I took um kind of tying in from Sunday morning the three um things that the church must be committed to a sacred responsibility was prayer the word and Christ how many remember that brother bam tells us that that was a Sac sacred trust that a church is committed to and we tied that in with The Godly mother and that we are really a true true mother is a true church that birth you you hear Brother Adam talking about your birth into this birth into this birth into that when you're talking about a birth you have to think of a mother because that's the only thing that gives birth and he talks about um those three things of sacred Trust of prayer and the word and to Christ and I went into this little booklet the 11th commandment and it's not a direct set of quotes but it was a book I call voice of God because I was trying to find that quotation that I mentioned to you all about offended and being offend offending offending and being offended but that's not really what he's what that what it says in this books it talks about hurting and being hurt that's the wording that he used and it's of the message um well a good portion of this how many you saw this before the 11th commandment it's really not a message it's broken up partly part of it is a message um you can find it if you go through it God projecting his love uh 1957 and but this is just added in this little booklet and they were sold at the brandom campaigns that were distributed do you feel cancer uh this 11th commandment and there's a a series of other ones William brandham a prophet visit South Africa 20th century Prophet um the eagle stir her nest and those different booklets they're not really in the search menu so you you won't find a quote where brother vanam is talking about that but if you take do you fear with cancer you'll know that that's directly from his message and they were they were uh sold and given out in the random campaign are you all hot we need to cool this down a little bit is okay all right maybe just a little more air I guess and so um but I like this and and I'm going to read this because it really kind of ties in with the message here tonight on Doctrine brother Brandon brings this in this booklet it's titled the 11th commandment bringing that love is the 11th commandment and you hear him make the statement many times no uh no um no book but the Bible no Doctrine but love no what would he say no law say help me out no law but love but no Creed but Christ no book but the Bible thank you message listeners no law but love no book but the Bible we should be able to show what we believe from this quotebook right here because that's what this message is founded upon and so um and it is all founded upon the love all of our Doctrine everything we do conduct orders communion whatever it is being in church our Behavior doing all those things paying your tithings worshiping the Lord through giving all of those things have to be founded what we believe preach and stand for has to be founded upon love the 11th commandment if it is not founded upon love all of our giving and everything else is in vain and so the prophet of God takes this and I'll just read out of this like I say the 11th commandment it's not a quote so they won't find it here but I'll read it out of this 11th command it we'll call it message resource or message material that was in the brandham campaign says love is not based on legalistic laws that we have to keep love is based on faith in one another faith in God trust in God confidence in God and I will tell you this my friends when the love of God comes into your heart you won't go around hurting and being being hurt when you believe God really believe him and get married to him you die out to the things of the world then God projects his love and his love makes you what you are love that you don't go around hurting and being hurt and so this love once again brother R takes it in the message love and God projecting is love and he says this here in paragraph number 20 sorry sis I didn't give this to you but this is what the prophet says in the message love I think love is the greatest Force there is in the world there's nothing more powerful than love if I had the choice tonight and was a sinner and was standing here before God and he have said now boy I'm going to give you all nine spiritual gifts I'm going to let you prophesy give you the Spirit of Prophecy I'm going to give you a m make going to make you a mighty preacher give you the word of wisdom and understanding I'm going to give you the gift of speak in tongues to interpret I'm going to give you a gift of healing that you'll have great faith for the sick and I'm going to do all these things for you I'll give you all that or I won't let you have any of those things but let you have Real Love in Your Heart I'd say God Give Me Love that's right you know what's so nice about this quote because brother brandham had all that those gifts and tremendous signs wonders and miracles and he said he would take love over all of that real love in your heart he says this here in God projecting his love 1957 I think if one thing is needed in the great Universal Church of God tonight is love we do not need other things as much as we think we do and all these other things our emotions our gifts they are wonderful to God we give praise but if those gifts are not governed by love then they are not effective love should govern the home love is the greatest force that was ever put into the power of man a home that's not disciplined by loved is not much of a home if a husband and wife doesn't solemnly love each other they cannot trust each other that's why I think that instead of resting our faith upon some emotion which is all right or some gift which is all right like shouting speaking with tongues or with other things that we take saying that we have the Holy Spirit when we do those things are all right but if we would come back to the principle love first then those things I think our church would progress a lot faster if we would get God first and God is love how many's heard these kind of quotes before how many you know this is the foundation of what brother random brought to us so couldn't we say that if we're really in the message then we really have the love that he's talking about the doctrine we can argue that's being able to read the doct we can stand with because we're saying what the prophet said but how many know we can say what the Bible said or even what God him said himself or quote the prophet verbatim and still not have love in our heart that's something different than just reading now we believe in reading the quotes don't misunderstand me we believe in staying with the word but we could stay with the word in our minds and still not have love in our heart and this is really what's lacking this is the big issue right here this is the trouble with our churches our homes our Ministries looking in the mirror this is your biggest problem right here is divine love if you have that Divine love in you you're not walking around looking at who don't like you or looking for a reason to argue with someone you have that Divine love in your your heart your focus is so much greater it's so much deeper got too many things to achieve than spend time arguing with people because the love part remember when you got saved remember when the love of God Came Upon you everybody was nice everybody was lovely everybody was a Believer but now we know who the three kinds of Believers are now and we identify them don't we I think and I believe like brother brandom says these are not just statements he made I think this is what we have to go back to get the love right and then find out what you believe doctrinally I I'll tell you this you know on these doctrines we call them doctrines they say Do you believe this particular Doctrine you believe the the seven Thunders or do you believe a deity or you believe the return Ministry or do you believe the two souls or do you believe the bride is going to bring the Revival do you believe it's we're waiting till brother random comes back what do we believe these are all these doctrines that men have uh presented to us and caused us to try to maybe pick a side and then those of us that don't pick a side someone will pick one for us and tell us what side we're on but it's so nice to know that they didn't know what side brother bam was on it's like where what side you on anyway he was on the Lord's Side how about that side they want to put him in this little you know and they'll try to get you into that don't fall for that trap stay with the word and so they call them doctrines and they call them little issues but I like to bring it like this brother will I'll say you know if you know they they they've they've got us labeled with something some of y'all and they got me labeled with something um whatever they'll continue to label but when they come and talk to me I don't have a problem with any quotes that brother Brandon brought and that's where I stand I don't have a problem with any part of the Bible that's where I stand that ought to be good enough for you now if we want to pick a side then that's on you to do that but come talking to me brother isra what you believe about this bring the quotations and let's talk around that let's talk about what brother so so said or that group over there because I know you went to Brother soo's church I know you preach for so and so so you must believe I don't want to talk about that bring the quotations bring the ministry bring the Bible and let's lay it out there and let's take a quote for quote and find out who believe and who don't believe it's just that simple okay all right so God has a Doctrine for us to believe and and Deuteronomy says my Doctrine give here my Doctrine shall drop as the rain and I read that scripture second Timothy chapter 4 because brother brandom takes it and says that the time will come when they will not endure pure sound Doctrine and we see that time it was prophesied to come and we see what's taking place today they'll turn their ears from the truth but I want to read something here or brother brandom is bringing the restoration message to us and he's in the restoration of the Bride tree and he's talking about this third stage which was a cankerworm we know that the word was restored we know that the gifts were restored we know that the order of the church was restored we know that all these things were restored but also the doctrine was restored and this is what we believe this is where we stand this is how we stand in in um and how we handle the word you know in water baptism or the holy ghost or the gifts of the Spirit or all of the Visions not just the pretty cute ones we can explain I'm talking about all of the Visions how do you stand with those Visions brother vam takes it here in paragraph 234 and the restoration of the brid tree and he says this here but the third stage of him was the canker worm that's got a bad name to start with the cankerworm what does the cankerworm do it goes into the bark that's the lifeline there yes sir it goes into the bark and it destroys the covering of the tree the covering what is religion covering that's what the word religion means of covering so this little cankerworm after he got amongst the congregation got them all dignified then he took all the fellowship away from them in the form of the Locust now he comes around and takes their very religion and makes dogmas out of it right sets up an orthodox an unorthodox words forms himself a religion gets a bunch of men together and put a Creed down there he takes the very religion and strips off of God's tree very bark that bears the sap that comes up in it takes it away cankerworm do you see the that insect conation says amen the cankerworm that was Rome in the early church brother gr continues on same message paragraph 246 God sent the Holy Spirit life of God to be in you not in the Statue you are the guy that God wants to live in not a statue but in you people call Holy statues there ain't no no holy statues you are God's holy statue the Bible said so that's right a body H has thou prepared me now this little fellow started destroying destroying what the cankerworm got into the bark Watch what it did begin to destroy begin to destroy the bark what did it do it made a natural church for a spiritual church yes sir it took away the true and give it a false now remember the fruit the pmer worm eat the leaf the Locust eat now the bark the covering the religion the doctrine the doctrine the cankerworm got paragraph 381 same message continuing on so brother Ram is showing what this covering is what religion is he's talking about the doctrine is what the cankerworm got into 381 he says he get into the bark and bore into the Ridge and take the doctrine away from them see the very thing that supports the life then as soon as he gets hes soon as he gets hes barded in that he had the next order come alone the old sucker the caterpillar took the denomination and sucked it up so here the prophet of God is showing us that it's actually our Doctrine which is is the Bark that protects the lifeline of the tree it protects the lifeline of the church is our Doctrine it's very important see well um you know long as we believe God and long as we go to church long as we do these other things but many people don't really study the message they don't internalize what they believe they don't get a grasp for it and we're not we're not we're not striving to be theologians but we can all have a better understanding of what we believe it starts by listening to it reading it and praying and let God reveal that word to you and this Doctrine is the lifeline it's all through the Old Testament and New Testament Isaiah 28 tells us that who can he teach knowledge who can he um wean from the breast who can he teach those things he said that all the tables were full with vomit and there had to be a doctrine that would come and bring Clarity to all these things amen I believe it's in Isaiah 28: 8-13 I want to show you and share with you that there is an importance to knowing what we believe knowing where we stand uh I think sometimes we not might not be able to articulate it all but we should be able to know when somebody's speaking something false we should know the word enough not to maybe to argue but to say you know what that's not right I can't explain it but let me call brother or so and so whoever that can help you out a little bit in what we believe because um outside of the message it's just church as usual out there and if our Doctrine is not distinguish if there's no difference signs wonders Miracles healings loves choirs being able to sing everybody has that What Makes Us different is our Doctrine what we believe I don't know anyone that believes marriage and divorce like we do or takes a stand on the godhead like we do or takes a stand on a holy life and clean living like we do and these things are part of the doctrine and Jesus in Isaiah 28 says for all the tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there is no place clean Whom Shall he teach knowledge Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little there a little for with stammering lips and another tongue will I speak to this people so Jesus in Matthew chapter 22 we're going to give you time to pray tonight we want to take I cut off just a little bit early but so we'd have time to pray get into the spirit of prayer and ask God to give us love the love of God surrounding these great this great Pillar of Fire huh the great mystery of the last day that God would give us love to accompany this Bible here the love to accompany this message how many know you need more love you need that this this 11 commandment really shook me I was looking for that and I called my father-in-law brother Ferguson and he showed me he said it was in the 11th commandment but it wasn't the way I thought it was when I as I read through it is and then it brings out hurting and being hurt but I went through that message is actually in that tape I told you God projecting his love 1957 oh it just struck me again how brother brandom really highlights the love of God the reason why these Miracles could take place in his life and really he can enter into the love for these people people that's why he could help them because you really really love them what if I really really love this neighborhood or the community that I'm called to serve if I really really love them they will know it it will move me to do something because love has to be expressed and you can't just say you love somebody your love will come out it will show through expression and if you really love The Sinner in that Community you'll create a way to reach them you'll create your love will move you it'll create it's not a blueprint somebody telling you what to do your love will push you to find out a way to write out a track to write a song to drop a note to ride through the neighborhood to park in the park find somebody to talk to your love will drive you to that how many you know what I'm talking about sure you um you're in love with a girl or a boy and you don't have no money you find some kind of way to talk to them anyways like I did with my wife we didn't have email so we got on the phone long distance and we got we paid bills that we didn't have money for my dad was like how much time you gonna spend on this phone talking to this girl all that's when you have to pay for minutes brother Tim yes giv them little calling Char and me like I got 30 more minutes left on here and broke flat broke but my love pushed me to keep calling spending money I didn't have love will move you love will push you and if you really love the sinner I can sit you down and you can articulate what you want to see happen in those Sinners lives amen absolutely and our doctrine that we believe and teach and we preach so fervently and we preach it so hard we hear brother brandom preach it he was motivated by love he left his home he preached he's tired uh set at the platform I was reading one place in Phoenix he called for a healing of a child he says everybody challenge the devil and he spent two and a half hours praying for one girl to be here healed labored in there until the Holy Spirit finally answered the prayer and it broke he said it did it again in Vermont a boy 14 years old blind from birth and he challenged everyone and they brought that boy and he prayed for I think he said two hours could you imagine he held up the whole prayer line the whole Ser some of us can't even church for two hours let alone him praying for one case for two hours a man that's doing that ain't doing it for no money a man that's doing that is because he was called to do it he's pushed he's pressured to do it amen amen and so that 11th commandment really touched me really brings this love out and so this Matthew chapter 22 we'll take this just for a moment here Jesus now I have several quotes and I'm just going to pull over here but it's several quotes here but I want to take the scriptures here in Matthew chapter 22 and verse number 24 they're trying to trap Jesus they're trying to catch him and these are the Pharisees and the Sadducees that had two different extreme doctrines one believed in the Supernatural with angels the other ones did not and so they're both were trying to catch catch him in his words they couldn't catch him they never heard anybody that Tau like him forget about the miracle signs and wonders those were there too but his teaching set him apart because he taught like one that had Authority and not like the scribes and Pharisees as the Bible says so his teaching separated him where is this man get this from where is he getting this from what school did you go through where where is he where's the thinking coming from see that that Doctrine and that teaching has to be a revelation here Jesus himself in Matthew chapter 22 and verse 24 says this saying Master Moses said if a man die having no children his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother now there were with us seven Brethren and the first when he married a wife deceased having no issue left his wife unto his brother likewise the second also and the third unto the seventh and last of all the woman died also therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven for they all had her Jesus answered and said unto them you do he not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels of God in heaven but as touching the resurrection of the Dead have you not read that which was spoken unto you by God saying I am the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob God is not the god of the dead but of the living and when the multitude heard this they were astonished at what astonished at his Doctrine but when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence they were gathered together then one of them which was the Lord asked him a question tempting him saying Master which is the greatest commandment in the law Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all and the all hang all the law and the prophets isn't that beautiful so the Lord is breaking some things to them they never heard before and if I had time and I brought it here before to you all um but it's the angel of the Lord that taught brother Bram the things that he taught he said so the angel of the Lord taught him so asking this question about what happens to this these Family Matters this woman who was married to this man and following the law of Moses in Direction Resurrection whose wife shall she be they didn't have the understanding of it just like we didn't have the understanding of what happens to a man when he dies until brother brandom went beyond the curtain of time I can't preach a funeral the same way after hearing that nobody in the denomination ever opened up what it was beyond the curtain of time brother brandom himself didn't quite know he thought brother Neville that would be like Spirits hanging around and they were Fellowship but they couldn't shake hands but when he went beyond the curtain of time his teaching had to change his Doctrine had to change it was more real and he came back with a fervent command keep pressing if you only knew and we saw that even on the other side he's still a leader we find out that if he didn't go we wouldn't be there we'll see that we are resting upon that you heard that crowd say that how many you know that's not just a story that really happened that's a that's a real place some of you met brother brandom and handled him that man went beyond the curtain of time and came back and told us what was going on over there so we're not guessing we're not questioning I got one brother in the sacramental church he said that when when we he thinks that when we uh get over on the other side that we'll all kind of look look the same and as after he described what he looked like that's what he was describing what everybody else would look like on the other side I said that's quite convenient but God made us all look the way we look for a reason right and and when brother banon went on the other side there was was in all one color they were there were different types of people there beautiful people love he described their teeth their hair the sparkle in their eye he described he said there was no human words to describe that so now how can I preach or teach any Doctrine contrary to that it changes all of that amen so you'll see this question that they asked the Pharisees and the Sadducees asked Jesus about the resurrection there's still a lot of points we don't quite fully understand don't fully quite understand how it all lines up where was Paul at he's in the third heaven what the third one brother Bron went to the first heaven and so we see that there's so much more to look forward to but we have enough in our doctrine that we know what to preach and we know how to stand is that right now the scripture is quite clear to tell us that in vain they worship they teach for Doctrine the Commandments of men in one of the translations it says it like this they worship me in vain their teachings are merely human rules and that's what some of some people that they call Doctrine is just somebody's idea it's not found founded upon the word it's not founded upon the angel of the Lord the message of the hour it's founded upon somebody's idea about something and Ephesians chapter 4 tells us that that we that we should um that God gave all of these great gifts Apostles pastors teachers for the Perfection of the Saints verse 20 verse 13 says till we all come into the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ verse 14 that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the Slate of man cunning craftiness whereby they lie in weight to deceive so we see that there is a stability that comes when we have this Doctrine 1 Timothy chap 1 veres 1-4 says this unto Timothy my own son in the faith grace mercy and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ Our Lord as I besought Thee to abide still at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other Doctrine neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies which minister questions rather than Godly edifying which is in faith so do can you say praise the Lord so he's admonishing them to teach no other Doctrine here's one that's quite strong I think it's in first John let's see if I can find it here quickly second John actually let's take Romans chapter 16 verse 17 and 18 first then second John 1 9-11 look at what the Bible says now beseech you Brethren mark them which cause divisions and offenses contr to the doctrine which ye have learned and do what to them follow them on Facebook do what to them see what they got to say hear them follow after them because they in the city the Bible says to avoid them first it says to mark them and then avoid them who's the them those that are causing divisions that are cont to the doctrine which we have learned so how do you know what you have learned if you're not into the teachings of what God gave in this generation God didn't call you to sit up and listen to everybody it's quite dangerous in fact he warns you to avoid that foolishness that's out there you type in the name brandom or William brandom online you're not going to get the truth you're going to get a lot of garbage you think you can sit there and take it it's not it's not convenient for you to sit and listen to that when you can hear the truth amen it's spicy yeah it's a it's newsworthy it's what people are doing today we like to hear something itching ears and all of that but it's it's not it's not it's not to your benefit in fact the scriptures warn us to mark them that caus that and to avoid them that has to apply to somebody Saints huh that has to apply somewhere in our life what is that that's the doctrine why why because that is your lifeline that's where that's the bark that covers the tree amen so for 2 john9 through1 we'll take this one here in verse number nine second John second John the epistle verse number nine can we read it together whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ hath not God he that abideth in the doctrine of Christ he hath both the father and the son if there come any unto you and bring not this Doctrine receive him not into to your house neither bid him God's speed for he that bth him God's speed is just being a nice person that's not what it says is partaker of his evil Deeds listening to a Brother's tape I still call him a brother years ago and I was listening to that tape and he started going on some stuff and it just started to grieve me just a little bit I said well I'll just listen to the rest of it and something told me turn it off and get it out of your house and that's exactly what I did because you know what what I'm gonna lose what I'm GNA lose oh I missed that brother's me huh I'm gonna miss a lot of things I don't want to miss what he's talking about I don't want to miss the Rapture I don't want to miss what the Lord is trying to be bring to me I might miss a few special I might miss somebody special meetings I might not hear everybody's series on what they're preaching on but I don't want to miss what God sent me this message amen God told me very clearly The Voice told me very clearly get out of that and I turn turn that tape off gave it back to whoever gave it got it out of the home and five six years later it was manifested that that brother went further and further into the Folly and the foolishness and still till today and many people follow it they log on and go line to it and they listen to it but I'm not going to listen to it no sir why because he warned me so we take this very very seriously don't we let's take one more scripture in Revelation Chapter 2 ver 14 and 15 now this is through the church ages this is the ages coming for the future Church and here the voice of the Lord is bringing these two characters back into view to the New Testament Saints and these two these this this this Prophet has already lived his life and gone on verse number 14 I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of balum who taught BAC to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the who the nitin which thing I hate so God hates this Doctrine he hates the doctrine of the nickan let me see if I can find this one more scripture all right how many you love the Lord okay let me kind find it all right scriptures talk about the doctrine of devils where is that at Saints help me hm okay we'll wait I'll find it right here myself let's see who said it no one oh they're not going to help me all right all right I try to save time so I don't read everything I have so say it sis yes First Timothy for you know what I didn't write it down I did yes right here 1 and two 1 Timothy 41 one two now thank you sis sister Heather amen now the spirit speaketh expressedly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith we see that happening don't we giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with the hot iron so so there are doctrines of devils that have been released to seduce people is that what the Bible says very clear very very clear this is the hour that we're living in this is the last days and the last time this is why our Doctrine has to be founded upon the word of the Lord and that Doctrine comes through the ministry of Malachi 4 if he didn't bring it then it ain't worth preaching or talking about so and so said this so and so said that what did the prophet say really that's what we we're interested in and that Foundation has to be founded upon Divine love amen we don't say that arrogantly we can say that rudely we do get upset at some of these things people say stuff we want to defend the faith but really the the it has to be motivated by love divine love that's what we desire that's what God has for us now one of the sermons that we brought during this conduct order in Doctrine we talked on how we dress and someone brought up to the little note there I won't read it but they were talking about the dress code and how they're that these feminine colors that men are wearing today patterns and um and that's you know that's something in my mind too I I don't think just because it's in the men's section that I should buy it and put it on because they have lost their mind am I am I right Saints so there takes some discernment because I'm here to portray something and our and our attitude and the way we dress and all of that there is Hollywood that wants to influence us in the latest styles of dress and dress wear for men and women there's an influence you walk into JC Pennies wherever you go to shop wherever you go go online and they're making them men look more feminist all the time soft sorry I mean it really looks sad we're not not bashing against anybody we're just talking about what the truth is they don't know they don't know what position they're taking then they all these and the person put in there about these floral patterns and these bright feminist colors I remember um we're g to REM have a memorial for my brother Jay but his son Little James I remember he came out of school one day he was living with us and he just came to me and he says Uncle Israel it's okay for for me to like pink it's okay I'm like who T told you that well we're learning that that's what they're pumping that in our kids it's okay for them to like pink so I mean pink is a color yes it's a beautiful color they it's in nature it's for God but I mean what was that I mean stop and so they're trying to push this on the kids okay the boys and the girls no no no don't say boys and girls let's blend them all together let's make them all you know they're all the same this job is you know job for men job for women no you're discriminating when you said it's job for human anybody can do the same job well we know that ain't true can't all do the same job no but this age has told us that even I get some little Flex back right now now I can feel it I want to get into that don't talk about that but 20 30 years ago wouldn't have a problem talking about it because the age out there is trying to water us down and feminize our young boys like little girls and it goes right into correct you can't even correct them no more you can't say no to nobody you can't tell them you were wrong or you lost no you can be whatever you want to be no you're not going to be Michael Jordan you can't jump you can't run you need to go read the books you can't you're not gonna be you can't be everything you want to be that's a lie it's not even true the world is gonna eat you up thinking that and so you know this whoever wrote that you didn't want me to say all that but let's see but they were talking about these feminine affecting do you see it affecting the church today absolutely is it something that we should be aware of and teach against to our children absolutely absolutely just wear blue young man or some shade of of it and I'm not trying to be funny but they they they've messed it up and the F folks that want to get mad or Flex against it don't get mad at me that's what they're doing out there we're preaching against it God help us amen and so we want to just stay with the word God bless you and so I think as a men just like our sisters should be conscious of how they dress our brothers should be conscious that designer for the woman Satan is still a designer for our men and they want to come up here and then and then just look or come into the church looking any kind of way the worldly haircuts and the the flame and the flamboyant bright colors like we're just in some kind of show or something think we have to be very careful of that aware of that I had a nice tie and shirt that would that went together or tie and little square that went together it was red but it had a shine to it so it kind of looked kind of red and a brother here in this church this was years ago but he's sitting here tonight one of our elders he said is that TI pink brother Israel I was like no it's not pink no of course not look at it well if I got to tell you it ain't pink whatever I got plenty other ties to wear I have to wear that one I still got it because it's a sharp tie but but the brother brought that up and I was like uh yeah maybe maybe not so God bless you God richly bless bless you let the Holy Spirit lead you in those things if your love is for God he will lead you and direct you if you're interested in it Lord show me is this right then he'll lead you into that way so God bless you richly amen let's take our prayer request here tonight brother Trevor has been off of work for about a week he's been sick Sister Abigail is homesick as
