evening amen it's always good to come in his into his presence amen amen let's go right to the word there's a few places I want to read for you and then we have a portion of a tape we'd like to play for you I ask you to stand and take your Bibles and turn in scripture we took a scripture here this morning think it's in Revelation is what we want the place we want to take it let's see here find it for you chapter 3 see God bless you see actually it's Revelations 21 sorry and I verse one and I saw a new Heaven and a new hear for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband verse number nine and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vows full of the seven last plagues and talk with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife amen and we know that the bride she's made herself ready and um we'd like to just go to the Lord in prayer as we lord if we ask your blessings on this portion of the scripture we ask that you'll bless BL us we pray bless each one each heart as we prepare to come to the table of the Lord and hear uh a portion of the word and the scriptures and the vision that we'll get into tonight open our heart open our understanding we pray father our great desire is to be just like you please help us we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated thank you baby some little baby said amen so so um in this uh scriptures that we read here the bride the Lamb's wife John saw her and this morning we uh stopped kind of on this vision of the Bride that brother brandham saw I'm going to read two places two or three places from that vision and then we will um play the vision for you okay we've done that before it's not very long and then we have the message communion that we want to play for you it's not the one that was preached here in tucon but there was one this one was preached in Jeffersonville all right so we'll lay that out that way and the team in the back the ministry in the back oh my God bless you so many changes we throw curves at them and they're doing a great job and so buy them a gift card or something if you can sandwich or ice cream or something and we certainly appreciate them amen so in this message um the Masterpiece now in 1964 brother brandom is receives this Vision he was in Jeffersonville if I remember outside of a mall and he goes into this uh trance and he begins to see um um the Lord begin to show him this I took the history of it one time before and I don't have all those details with you before but here in this message in paragraph 184 he says here he says standing out there I guess sister da and them after I shook hands with Bill standing there and all went around the corner a whole bunch of people a minister pressed his way in caller turned around he said why is it that you're always balling the people out he said then people believe you to be a servant of God and be gentle and sweet to them and everything and said every time I hear you get up you're balling women out about having short hair about wearing shorts and wearing makeup and all this other stuff and balling the people out and tell them how cold and formal and indifferent they are so why do you do that said them people love you how can you you being a loving Son of God do a thing like that I thought Lord let me answer this smart man see you just let me answer him somewhere that'll hang him on his own rope I said well I said sir did you ever read the great producer of music called the great composer called be toin he said oh sure I read a bet toen I said he probably tore up waste baskets fulls of scrap paper but give the world masterpieces he never opened his mouth and said another word I said when he was sitting in his study under the inspiration he would write something down he'd go into his study and pray it wasn't right he scrap it up and throw it in the waste basket but when he got through in all inspiration the world had a masterpiece and then brother random goes into to this vision of uh uh this masterpiece and then I'll just highlight one part I normally don't highlight uh message that we're going to listen to I like you to do that on your own and so but um for this Vision I'll do that in paragraph 190 so here he is a scene a vision or a preview as we read for you this morning what a preview is it's a look into the future it's a a glance to a description of something that will happen to the Future brother brandham says this here now I'm an American but this made me sick I'm not eloquent enough to in a mixed audience to say what was taking place and you'll have to read between the lines but when them women were coming the leader of them was a witch she had a great long nose and a great big mouth and all of them was dressed with some kind of lower clothes down here but the top just had a strap that just a little about half inch strap that moved up and went around them like this and each woman had something on an order many of you years ago used to remember when we used to cut that paper you know newspaper make an old fly bush how many remembers it you know I think they use it in [Music] carnivals and hanging down like that French paper lace paper paper they had something holding below them like this holding below them all this part was exposed and each one had hair cut up real short and Frizzy looking things all over it like that real short cut hair and full of makeup absolutely nothing but look like street prostitutes and they were walking with this paper in the vulgarity now the paper was what was holding in front of them but when they pass the review stand in the back of them and to see the way they were going on and their foremost and their back part and how they were acting I said is that the church and there she went and they were singing These here twist and roll songs you know orever what you call going down singing that and going by I said is that the church and I was standing there and then my heart I was crying and this witch to my notion there nothing else in the world she's that World Council of churches leading them right straight down the road where she was going they went off to the left and disappeared in chaos still beating this music and making real funny sounds and shaking their bodies one side and then the other side and then like that carrying on like that walking and so I wanted to read read that part because this is what the uh so-called Church of the last days this is what they were doing he talked about their hair being cut he talked about them being full of makeup and he talked about the rock and roll music uh in the church and so let that be a warning to all of us if you are a church these Tendencies would want to influence you if you are a sister these are the tendencies that would want to influence you makeup cutting your hair and then this ungodly Unholy music now this is a vision that the prophet saw and uh it's a warning to us and so I'm going to let him tell the vision I got one more part I want to read for you here and that was in paragraph number 95 then I have to watch her she'll get out of step with that word if I don't watch she was passing by she gets by maybe it'll be my time when I'm over see when I'm finished or whatever it is what they was getting back trying their best and was getting back just get in line cuz they was looking out somewhere else watching about that church that just went out into chaos but the the front ones never the back ones just two or three of them was kind of stepped out of out a little bit to the right hand side and looked like was trying to get back in line as they went by they was just pass me oh as far as here to the wall past me and standing there then I just seen it all move out and leave so here brother bam is talking about that first one no never he says it was the ones in the back in this Vision the last day ones that he had to watch and so I encourage the church to maybe hear that message um um of course these messages have it contained but the um the message marriage and divorce so one of the sisters asked for a book um after the service and I I was looking for a book so I called Arie Peterson he's so faithful and he said uh and I've done this many times can you give me a copy of this whatever message and he'll grab it off of their shelf and give it to me and he said if we ever get rid of our library would you want I said oh yes give it all to me so I still like a book you know and the sister asked for that book cuz you you know there's no popups or you know ads advertisements when you're reading the book you might get that on your phone but not when you're reading the book so I have two or three extra ones for those of you that want that message marriage and divorce in the book format but I like to play this I have the Saints back there play this portion of the this is the vision it's just a few moments here in the message Masterpiece paragraph I guess I gave you the paragraph number pardon yes to what I yes 184 what did I say to stop 2011 yes that's fine thank you stand out there in the hall I guess sister D then went had to Shu hands of Bill and stand there all went around the corner a whole bunch of people Minister priced his way in caller turned around he said why is it that you're always balling the people out he said that people believe you to be a servant of God to be gentle and sweet to them and everything said every time I hear you get up you're balling women out about having short hair and about wearing shorts and wearing makeup and all this other stuff and balling the people out and tell them how cold and formal and IND different they are so why do you do that so that people love you how can you be a loving son of God and do a thing like that I thought Lord let me answer this smart man just let me answer him somewhere hang him on his own roomle and I said well I said sir did you ever read of the great u a uh producer of music called a great composer called Beethoven he said oh sure I read a beIN I said he probably tore up waste basket fulls of scrap paper but he gave the world on masterpieces you never opened his mouth and said another word I said when he was sitting in his study under the inspiration he'd write something down he' go into the study and pray it wasn't right he scrap it up and throw it in the voicey basket but when he got through an all inspiration the world had a masterpiece oh how the word Cuts but it produces masterpieces takes all the husk and stalk away yes it brings forth Masterpiece I got s minutes to tell you something that happened the day before yesterday to get out on time July the 3 I was over here sitting in the this Center over here shopping center right out from the sure I've been in pig alley in Rome in France and I've been in New York City Los Angeles but the filthiest bunch of women I ever seen in my life is Jeffersonville Indiana I never seen so much gone and filth in my life as I see among some people I sat there to my heart ache and the Lord had gave me a vision now I'm going to tell the vision I don't know what I can interpret it but I I'm going to tell the vision for my first time I fell into a trance and when I did there was somebody with me I didn't see the person it was just the voice and I I looked and as I I looked this way he said the bride will come in view for a preview and I looked coming to me and I seen the most the most prettiest bunch of clean dressed women I ever seen in my life but each one of them looked like was dressed different they all had long hair and they were long their sleeves and skirts and so forth young women it look kind of I'd say about maybe 20 now I have the Bible open here before me I can only say what I seen if you say what are you looking at I'm looking at a clock why you looking for I'm looking for people looking at people why are you looking at I'm looking at the Bible that's what I'm telling the truth that's what I see and I can only say what I seen I don't I don't know what it all about it I just have to tell you but when this bride she was looking right at uh the one was talking to me and I standing together her eyes she was a cleanest sweetest looking people I ever seen in my life look like it could have been a dozen or more just I don't know how many was a breast but there just a group of and she passed by sweetly with an air and her eyes up watching as she passed by oh she was beautiful I looked at her as she passed by he said now we shall review said that's the bride now we will review the churches and they come I notice Sam coming up and when they come up each one look like got worse I never seen such a filthy bunch in my life and when he said next I heard a noise and said next said Here Comes the American group now I am an American but this this made me sick I am not uh eloquent enough to in a mixed audience to say what was taking place uh uh uh and you'll have to read between the lines but when the women were coming the leader of them was a witch she had a great long nose and a great big mouth and all of them was dressed with some kind of low clothes down here but the top just had a strap that just a little about a/ inch strap that moved up and went around them like this and each woman had something on the order many of you years ago used to remember when we used to cut that paper you know newspaper and make an old fly bush how many remembers you know well I think you use in carnivals you know hanging down like a fringe paper lace paper they had something holding below them like this holding below them all this part was exposed and each one had hair cut up real short and Fry looking things all over it like that real shortcut hair and full of makeup absolutely nothing but look like street prostitutes and they were walking with this paper and the vulgarity now the paper was what was holding in front of them but when they passed the review stand in the back of them and to see the way they were going on in their foremost in their back part and how they were acting I said is that the church church and there she went and they were singing this year twisting Roll songs you know what you call going down saying going by I said is that the church and I was standing there and in my heart I was crying and this witch to my notion it's nothing else in the world but she's the she's that World Council of church is leading him right straight down the road where she was going they went off to the land and disappeared in chaos still beating this music and making real funny sounds and shaking their bodies one side and then the other side and then like that like that walking and I just started to bow my head and he said wait the bride must come again and I look and here they come again and they pass by sweet looking little ladies that's all looking right at me say pass by I noed each one was dressed different and one in the back had kind of long hair hanging down and had it rolled around like this might have been German or something like that and I watch him and then as he started leaving two or three of them in the back car get out of step and I was going to holler at him and they trying to get back and step again and I seen him just the vision just fade out and change from me now here is the interpretation thereof the reason I remember I had just got through writing I hadn't finished I hadn't wrote these notes yet but in preaching this morning I caught what it was right in my sermon did you notice the church only came in view now that's the truth friends the heavenly father who writes the word knows that I tell the truth I don't I just say the truth and not knowing it till just a few minutes ago looked like or just recently see did you notice the Bride come in view twice the first seed the second seed both of them exactly the same one and the reason they were dri dressed in different parts she'll come from All Nations it'll make up the bride each one had long hair and no makeup and real pretty girls and they were watching me that represented the bride coming out of all Nations see each one represented a nation as they March perfectly in line with the word see then I have to watch her she'll get out of Step of that word if I don't watch when she's passing by if she gets by maybe it'll be my time when I'm over see when I'm finished or whatever it is what they was getting back trying their best getting back this getting line is looking out somewhere else watching about that church and just went out of into chaos but two the front ones never the back ones just two or three of them was kind of stepped out a little bit to the right hand side and looked like was trying to get back in line as went by as this passed me all Forest here at the wall passed me I was standing there and then I just see all move out and leave but you notice the church only came into to view once each Nation the church but the Bride come in twice see see what it was now not knowing it but look at it with my message this morning not knowing that see the seed fell in the ground at NAA that was the original seed and she's come through the process of denominations which only comes in existence once but the bride returns back again in the last days I will restore see the Masterpiece is brought up that's reason she was in view reviewed the second time she was reviewed the first time and she was reviewed the second time and she's perfectly the second time like she was the first time oh God have mercy hurry hurry hurry life get in the green right quick MH all others never appeared no more they went out never to come back again but the bride came back because she was Alpha and Omega God the great sculpture has made him a masterpiece for it is a piece of his first masterpiece like he made in the Garden of Eden took a piece from and made another piece and that was marred and fell now he's been all this time building up again and he brought forth this masterpiece and was smitten and ordered that part that was smitten was in order to bring back again that Masterpiece again so the Masterpiece in the Son of God the Masterpiece in the bride and it's a piece of him which must be the fulfilling of the word the word has been fulfilled and we're ready for the coming of the Lord oh Church of the Living God by your hearts and your yourselves before God these things are true I know that it sounds like it it's such a greater thing as that would be would be so spread out over the Nations it never was he doesn't change his way just be thankful Church be thankful that you are where you are today if you're in Christ because you see now and when that remember all that life will be gathered right into the grain for the resurrection but the stalk must be burned the rest of it the husk and all must be destroyed and it will be don't trust in you them denominations you stay in the word the lifee God and His Masterpiece now what is in a millennium amen praise the Lord thank God for his word brother man said just be thankful you know when I hear brother ran I've heard that Vision so many times I played it for the church and number of times every time I hear it it just really electrifies me to get in my prayer closet and say Lord please help me please help me to be in the image of what you saw the bride what you showed the prophet the cleanest sweetest looking bunch of people that he ever saw that's what we want to be brothers and sisters isn't that what we want to be amen the cleanest bunch of people amen so God bless you richly I think we have a little bit of time it's only 6 maybe we'll take a little time and so um what we'll do is um we won't hold you back but there is a message on communion that um well maybe we'll just read the scripture on communion and go to the table of the Lord all right so let's um let's do that let's take our scriptures and uh of course there's I can play the tape I can play several tapes I can play but let's take what we just heard and let that settle in our hearts and receive that tonight amen I just feel to do that God bless you richly Amen in 1 Corinthians 11 if You' stand with me actually there's verse 23 let's go up a little bit further we normally start at verse 23 we'll take verse 17 now in this that I declare unto you you I praise you not that you come together not for the better but for the worse for first of all when you come together in the church I hear that there be divisions among you and I partly believe it for there must be also heres among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you when you come together therefore into one place this is not to eat the Lord's Supper for in eating everyone one took it before other his own supper one is hungry the other one is drunken what have you not houses to eat and drink in or despise ye the Church of God and shame them that have not what shall I say to you shall I Praise You In This I praise you not for I've received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you drink this for often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he comes wherefore whosoever should eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another If any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come so we'll have silent prayer please pray for me I pray for you I'll pray for you and let's pray for one another just in silent prayer before we take these elements heavenly father in my hands I hold the bread that was made for this service Lord oh God as we partake of it may each one receive receive the blessings that comes with being obedient to your word Lord the world maybe doesn't understand Lord but your word is true they ate the Passover and they
