about 20 minutes in all we'll end just before paragraph uh question rather 243 let's sing only believe only believe only be all things are possible only [Music] the only be only be all things are possible only be you may be seated brother Brena uh first seal fulfill second Thessalonians uh the revelation of the man of sin yes that's right that does that easy that does that a man of sin he say man keeps in in stages riding on to he gets on a pale horse is called Death Christ comes on down to justification sanctification to the White Horse and that's get life you see what happened to the Born Again believers who are in the various denominations but not in the bride of Christ what happens to them well I think we explained that a while ago see they go into the tribulation they are Mar in the tribulation come up in the last after the Millennium for their judgment see because the Bible said that the rest of the living the rest of the Dead live not until the thousand years was expired then there was a resurrection and then come forth the both just and unjust and was judged by Christ and the bride he came came to the Earth with 10,000s times 10, thousands of his Saints is that right his bride judgment was set the books was open books was open and another book was open which is The Book of Life he separated from there the goats from the Sheep is that right that had nothing to do with the bride she was standing right there in judgment with her Queen the queen and king together he came with the Saints 10 thousands times thousands ministered to him why then judgment was set and then the Sheep was separated from the goats remember the night me bring that little meditation so he'd understand the cowboy meditation see there you no they are that's um they the the the church the people that's in denominations that are are genuine Christians who receives the message and they will never see it it'll never be preached to them and those in the mixed crowds who it is preached to it'll go right over the top their heads unless your name was on the L's book of life but they will be good people and they'll be raised up again and given trial and be judged by the very group that preached to them don't you know the Saints will judge the Earth they'll be preached to see they'll be preached to by the very same people witnessed to them of the message to come out of it I hope that explains it got some many here that brother brandham is the seventh angel with the spirit of Elijah the same man as the Elijah sent to the 144,000 Jews during the three and a half years after the Rapture some of us are mixed up in this no he isn't the same see it's two different man the Elijah that come in the form of Elijah was not Elijah and the spirit of Elijah who came up on a man called John the Baptist was not Elijah and the man of the seventh angel messenger at the end of the lady of sin age will not be the literal Elijah he'll be a gentile to his people Elijah will the spirit of Elijah then coming in the into the people there he will be a Jew see for they're sent to their own people that's my Revelation reason uh of Tommy osor when we talk that over that time Tommy and I I never know I was just praying for the sick and I come up there and there's a lady come down from the fortman Gospel Tabernacle a missionary in the Foreign Fields her breast was that big with just eat up with cancer she was right there in the little house where we used to live up here in lane and I prayed for the dear sister and she was healed and returned to the field and when she come from Africa and she had left a little book there on missions I I thought well missionaries are fine and I've I've uh never thought much about missionaries and so I thought well there just an office of God out there so that's this my place right here on ath and Penn Street so I was just carrying all the best I could but one day sitting in the study I picked up that book and had a picture of a of the Negro race an elderly old father and he had this little white r my hair and underneath was written like this white man white man where was your father see I'm now old and dull at mine and I don't understand too well if I would have known Jesus when I was a young man I would have took him to my people well I read it and something just kept saying read it again read it again I kept reading you've had them read over and over the something in there like up there that day at Greens Mill when to come out of the cave I couldn't understand that uh how people could speak with tongues and Shout with the genuine Holy Ghost and still be Antichrist speak with Tong with genuine Holy Ghost tongue speaking and still be a devil right I prove that to you yes indeed then notice when they stood there so tongues is no evidence of the Holy Ghost it's one of the the gifts of the Holy Ghost see and the devil can impersonate everything he's got Divine Healing and everything else he said many will come to me that said Lord haven't I cast out Devils haven't I that's preaching the gospel haven't I done Mighty works in your name and all these things there I'll say depart for me you workers of iniquity I didn't even know you the Bible said that the rain falls on the just and the unjust the same and the same cuckle bir standing in the wheat field there can be as happy and Shout with the same water that fell upon him as it was sent to the rain but by their fruit you know land amen that little old cuckle bird can stand up there just a happy and shout as he can be just as full of the same rain that the weed is there you are so they shout speak with tongues and personate everything you want to and that they be called workers of iniquity as I told you a while ago listen to what I say listen close look back down and examine yourself with the word and see where you're at you women's got short hair let her grow amen you're wearing shorts take them off act like a lady you man still smoking cigarettes around the pool hall stop it I don't care how much you profess if you're still holding that organization saying this is it and this is it you better stop look back down and examine with the word we're didn't come out of we are to lived above the short hair and all this age now we're back into something now that God's revealing the Hidden Mysteries have been put on the book before the foundation of the world Hallelujah and those who have obeyed in these small things will catch it in these other things if they haven't it'll grow the top of their head as far as East is from the west it'll just like Gideon separating his man there's thousands and thousands God said that's too many separate him again he give them another test separate him again separate him again on down to they had a little handful said that's a group I want to do the job that's exactly what happened Pentecostal women going back and forth sitting there hearing and knowing the the word that's wrong you think they'll cope with it no sir every year when I pass by there's more was Bob was said once that got to the order someone said what brother B people regard you as a prophet now I don't say I was a prophet nobody years need to say that but I say this that if if you did do that if you guarded so why don't you teach people how to receive the Holy Ghost and how to get this and how to get great spiritual gifts and help the church how can I teach them algebra when they won't even listen to their ABC right you do these little things get down your the B and brush it off and start right all what was I talking about anyhow I didn't a get off that subject excuse me see all right some of the some of us are mixed up is the Elijah the same as a y that's right no this Elijah that will come to the Gentiles will be a gentile Anointed with that spirit because God used that same Spirit to bring his people P out of chaos every time and it served his purpose well so he comes it right back down again see because now if he uses a high polish educated that's a kind it would catch he brings a man that hardly knows his ABCs and can't pronounce his words right and everything like that some old wilderness something out under somewhere and brings it in and shs right down that simpleminded people and to get it like that it common call like Paul said I didn't come to you with a Polish of an education but I come to you in the power the resurrection it taken God three and A2 years down in Arabia there to knock it out of him his education took took him 40 years to get out of Moses see so there you are that's I don't say God don't I'm not supporting literacy now but I'm I'm trying to tell you it don't take the education don't the wisdom of this world is contrary education has been the biggest hindrance that the gospel's ever had if we didn't have education we' have all these big seminaries and things that we got now be people simple minded who would listen to the word but they so polished and messed up and tightened up out there with all them organizations so that they're going to stay with it that's all they take on that Spirit did you ever take a good woman marry into a low down man that low down man either becomes a a good man like the woman is or the woman becomes low down as he is that's right that's what he said come out from among them when I'm getting ready to take that Rapture you got to have some kind of Faith that'll take you out of here when was the Covenant of Daniel 9:27 confirmed for a week one half of it was confirmed the Covenant when Jesus Christ was on Earth preaching to the Jews he never went to the Gentiles at all and he told his disciples don't go to the Gentiles that was to Jews alone see and he preached for three and a half years that's half of the 70 week now as Daniel said he would do now remember he was firmly a Vindicated to the Jews but their eyes were blinded to bring in this space of the Gentile can't you see the whole program and he proved himself a prophet done just exactly what the prophet would do showed him the sign of a prophet which your own word said if a man says he's spiritual a prophet watch what he says and if it comes to pass just keep on coming to pass what he say continually like you're looking the Bible said KN it'll be open seek find uh ask be given now if you notice it's knocka just constantly knock there right there like the unjust uh judge with an answer woman he just kept knocking on her door I'm on your hand not seek say Lord I'd like to have this amen that's not it stay right there till you get it amen you know it's going to come so he promises to just stay right there you to hold on to it now now in the last part this the 70th week the last part of it will be during the time of the tribulation period at the Rapture of the church then here's a three and A2 years here that it will be confirmed to them again by prophets see Moses and Elijah Revelations 11 now let's see what this is if you are one of his chosen ones will you go up in the yes yes sir that's easy brother Brandon did you mean to say 7,000 who had not bowed their knee to balum or 700 7,000 I meant to say forgive me for that see just a it's just a a matter of speech I was just like said a while ago J know me S here I said and and they bear a record seeing the Lamb see see the lamb was on Earth see bear a record seeing the spirit of God coming upon the lamb now in there it says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased you see now that's wrote in the actual form of the Greek but verb for adverb but you notice here and actually you this uh let's take the word see the Bible says in the translation of St James here this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell but actually if we say like we said to this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell in it turn it around see see this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell now we said today this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell in same word just turns it around now yes I meant forgive me please and and Brethren you on the tape out there and Friends listening I didn't mean to say that like that I I I'm a minister to the gospel I many times I preached that I know that 7,000 I just happen to say 700 I didn't mean just 700 I meant you I just didn't read it out of the Scripture it just come to my mind while I was talking and I just said 700 instead of 7,000 I make that mistakes all the time I'm I'm a sure a dummy so you forgive me see I don't mean to do that uh is the bride of Christ and the body of Christ the same yes sir see now here I see I don't want to get start because to get us preach a sermon on see but I won't do that but I want to show you when God gave adam his bride from his side he said she is Flesh of My Flesh and bone of my bone is that right when God gave Christ his bride the spirit gave the flesh the bride he was plucked pierced in the side under his heart and water blood and Spirit came forth and that become flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone we are the Flesh and Bones the bride will be the Flesh and Bones of Christ ex Zach they are the that is his bride would the bride of Christ have would the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture sure that's what's going on right now the bride of Christ certainly it is the message of the hour amen the bride of Christ sure she's consist of Apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors is that right that's the bride of Christ sure she's got a Ministry great ministry the ministry of the hour it'll be so humble I remember how many were sure the first one I last Sunday see remember what I preached on humility oh don't forget that I'm going to stop a minute to warn that again remember when God predicts anything great to happen the people are looking so far away by their wisdom till they miss what happens when God says anything is great the world laughs at it that bunch of ignorantes that's right but when the great world the great High Church said boy that's glorious God says a bunch of ignoran so see you have to watch I don't mean it maybe of that way exactly that way but that's the way it is look here was a great holy Orthodox Church we know the word we got schools we got seminaries we got our man so polished while for hundreds of years we've been loyal to Jehovah we are the church we the Sanhedrin we got the Council of churches here both Pharisees and Sadducees and all the denominations GS up together like we're getting we're all in one the the Council of church we are the big shots here we know that scripture watch some lead your guy down on the river with a beard hanging over his face and a piece of sheep's again telling us certainly they would listen to it am but the Bible said in Malachi the fourth CH the third chapter I'll send my messenger before my face to prepare the way for me amen 712 years before that the great prophet of Isaiah stood there and said there will be a voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way for the Lord and make his P straight that's right and said Dave all many of them said every high place will be brought down oh they said they'll be when this man comes he'll porn his finger and he'll move mountains oh and all the Low Places the ditches will be brought up then all it's all the rough places will be smoothed out brother we'll plant corn ever Feld around here oh we're going to do great things when this man comes see they expecting God to take the crank and turn on bring the Carter down say come on down you great Forerunner of my Messiah and then as soon as he's gone they pull it back up his ministry is over they crank it down again and put it right down the other side of the Seminary and say all right my beloved Son walk down and tell him oh my look when he come by what did happen here come a man that know another school didn't even have a fellowship card didn't have no credentials nobody ever know he ever went to school day his life he couldn't even tell it by talking he didn't even talk in terms of a of Ecclesiastes he talked about serpent axes and Wilderness and and uh things like that see trees he talk not in the

many sermons in there in Psalms 27 and we'll just get a portion of this Psalm today and then we'll go into Joshua chapter 1 and Deuteronomy chapter 20 amen I'll read the first verse and then the class read the second verse and we'll read the last verse Al together the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid though a host should encamp against me me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this will I be confident of for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion Amen in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock here oh Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in Anger for thou has been my help leave me not neither forsake me oh god of my salvation father teach me thy way oh Lord and Lead Me in a plain path because of my enemies Witnesses is against me let's read verse 13 and 14 all together I had fainted unless I had believe to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord amen we'll take a scripture to save a little bit of time in Joshua chapter 1 in verse number eight and the Bible says this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou sh make thy way prosperous and then thou shal have good success have not I commanded thee be strong and of good courage Be not Afraid amen neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee withersoever thou go is what a promise what a beautiful promise title of the message this morning is the soldier the Holy Spirit the soldier the Holy Spirit may God add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated for a moment I took that title out of the message that brother brandom preached the greatest battle ever fought and he makes this statement in that message paragraph 104 in the greatest battle ever fought he said what was the matter you had to open the Channel first you've got to get the soldier the Holy Spirit placed at the Battlefront that takes God's word amen so we've been going through the scriptures here at the little church here on uh writing it down taking the words of the Lord and how the Lord commanded that that word be written and recorded it it's the same word almost as a memory or recording things must be written down to be kept for future use that's the reason why we write things down and the Lord Lord commanded us to write these laws of his word down throughout the scriptures and he tells the Believers to do that and I called them the other day I called them the discipline that it requires to not add or not take away from those words so first what the Lord does is he brings his word into your view into your life it's in the written form it's written down for a purpose many people tried to stop it and um this is why the Bible is such a tremendous book it's very I mean it causes great Wars and battles there's Nations that don't want nothing to do with it there's demons and Devils that don't want you to have it it's a very very controversial book uh to those that can open it and read it but the Lord had commanded that that word be written down for the purpose and then he seals that word with these two major disciplines and that is not to add or to take away and I was I I found brother George that in my own testimony in my own life that if I can walk in those disciplines I I'm okay I'm good I mean not just not just the scriptures but the Visions the tapes the what something means it's that temptation to add something to it to make it more flavorable or make it more presentable leave it alone it's a discipline that every believer must have God said don't add to it don't take away from it and if you do there are consequences couldn't we even say like this brother Kurt that every denomination and every group violated that principle that's why they're there even in the message doctrines have started and begun and started because somebody violated those two small principles don't add don't take it away I've been guilty if you'll be honest yes you have been guilty we're all guilty with adding or misremembering or forgetting and then you know maybe maybe we don't add nothing but we won't we won't say it all we won't you know you know you know you know we won't bring it all but this is his word and so we've been bringing that out and it's been a real real blessing uh to me to remind myself that I don't have to make the Bible say anything because I am not the author of nothing but confusion I've authored some craziness but the word of the Lord is getting me on track and all I got to do is find myself in in his word just how he brought it if I can believe it others can believe it too sometimes we want to believe for other people we say that's going to be too strong or too hard don't give her that tape don't give him that tape that's going to be too much for them but you believed it that's right and the True Believer believes the word and so God works out all those details I said this brother brother mcra told me this I was talking to him the other day and I was talking I think I shared it here maybe I didn't but I was talking how I had to bury two of my brothers this year my brother Edgar and then all of most of you know my brother Jay or Jordan We buried them it was you know hard and very hurtful to have to uh lay them to rest they're my brothers and I know that I love them and I wanted to see them go deeper in the things of the word and brother McGraw said something to me that was so profound and simple and he said you know brother Israel the Lord loves your family more than you do yeah that's true I want you to think about that you think you love them but he loves them more so why don't you just put your family in God's hands cuz he'll take better care of them then you worrying about them amen and that so helped me and it just it just blessed me and you know thinking of this um you know these uh disciplines of don't adding and don't taking away and how you know I'm coming back to those roots of you know I just I'm just committed to what God has sent in this day and I thank God for it now as I go further into that we'll see that in the word of the Lord there was a commandment for that same word to be spoken in the ears of the entire congregation so when the word has come now it was commanded to come it was protected with don't add or take away from it now why do we do that now hear o Israel these Commandments these laws and these precepts and in Exodus 24 and: 7 and the Bible says and he took the the book of the Covenant and read it in the audience of the people and they said all that the Lord had said will we do and be obedient Deuteronomy 17:19 says and it shall be with him and he shall read therein all the days of his life that he may learn to fear the lord his God to keep all the words of this law and these statutes to do them and this is talking about King Josiah or he's talking about a King when he sits upon his throne and how he's supposed to write these things down and continue further into that word Deuteronomy 31:1 says this I'm quoting your Bible now you might get happy you might say Amen it's not my word it's not your it's God's word amen hallelujah in Deuteronomy 3111 says when all Israel is come to appear before the Lord thy God and the place which he shall choose Thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing gather the people together men and women and children and thy stranger that is within thy Gates that they may hear that they may learn and fear the lord your God and observe to do all the words of this law and that their children which have not known anything may do What like what part are they supposed to hear not the seven seal that's for the older ones right you can't you can't let them hear marriage and divorce right you know there's parts of the law you can't let the little Bitties you can't let the little ones hear that it's true it's mature content I guarantee you our little ones are hearing more mature content than perhaps we realize this was a commandment of the Lord let me finish the scripture there it says and their children which have not known anything may hear and learn to fear the lord your God as long as you live in the land whether you go to Jordan to possess it Joshua 8:34 says this and afterwards he read all the words of the law the blessings and the cursings according to all that is written in the book of the law there was not a word of all that Moses commandment which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel with the women and the little ones and the strangers that were conversant among them 2 Kings 8:23 verse 2 and the King went up into the house of the Lord and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him and the priest and the prophets and all the people both small and great and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the Covenant which was found in the house of the Lord that was a great revival time for Israel when Josiah got uh he got I believe that's the king's name got that book and they read it in the ears of the people and turned turned the kingdom upside down and not only did he read it he made sure all Israel heard it and read it and the women and the children and the visitors it's for everybody to hear everybody to have it heard read to them Nehemiah 8:1 says and all the people gathered themselves together as one man in the street that was before the Watergate and they spake unto Ezra The Scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses which the Lord had commanded to Israel and Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women and all that could hear with understanding upon the first day of the seventh month and he read therein before the street that was before the water great from the morning until midday before the men and the women and those that could understand and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law the word is being preached that's not the time to go get a bathroom break that's not the time to go and get something to drink that's the time to be attentive to keep your feet stop the shuffling and the hustling and the bustling and the riddling and the rattling the scratching and this and and that the word is being read your your word his word is being read for your ears to hear it and I guarantee you if there's anything the devil don't want you to get that's a portion of God's word to drop down in your spirit if he can Sidetrack you and get you upset and looking at who wore what and how this didn't happen and whatever he has got you conquered the word of the Lord is pure every word of God is pure and you know with the Commandment of writing it all and keeping it all and then don't add or take away he adds another tremendous profound statement concerning the word and that is this the word of the Lord will not ever return unto him void it will always accomplish what it was sent for it's got a purpose it's got a plan you can read it in the funeral read it in the marriage ceremony read it on your way to work read it in church read it out loud it will never return unto God void or empty it has weight it has power and there's a reason why we read from no service is complete you didn't have church yet if you didn't hear the word of the Lord if you didn't write anything down that the Lord said and you couldn't capture or remember remember anything then you really didn't um accomplish what you came here for you came here to get a word from not the pastor not the church not the you came here to get a word from so you can leave here and say God told me God told me I'm Healed today God told me I was a Believer God told me I'm going to heaven that's how personal you want it to beujah when he speaks when he speaks it becomes your word if you catch it this in Nehemiah chapter 8 says so verse 8 so they read in the book of The Law of God distinctly that word distinctly means making it clear it's uh making it clearly and gave the sense and caused them to understand the reading praise Lord Verse 18 nemiah 8:18 also Day by Day from the first day until the last day he read in the book of The Law of God and they kept the feast seven days and on the eth day with a solemn assembly according unto the manner can I continue I just asked that out of formality it really is not an a answer that I need need from that I'm going to continue but it just kind of includes you when I ask right can I go a little further now don't that feel good and I said okay I guess I will all right and Nehemiah chapter 9 verse3 this might shock some of you but it's in your Bible in verse three it says and they stood up in the place in their place and read in the book of The Law of the Lord their God one fourth part of the day and another fourth part they confessed in worship what's two fours two 1/4 1/4 that's half of the day now they're reading the word the other fourth they've confessed In Worship the Lord their God so half of the day they're reading the word or quarter of the day their reading of the way word another quarter of the day they conf fessing and worshiping so what do you think the other half of their day is going to be it will set the course if you're reading one quarter of the day if you're worshiping the other quarter of the day the rest of your day is done or should be the course of your day should be nothing but Praises blessings and thank you Lord right but many of us can't even give church a quarter of the daybody say Amen all right no the service is too long huh Jeremiah 3:6 it says therefore go thou and read in the road which thou Hast written from my mouth the words of the Lord in the ears of the people in the Lord's house upon the fasting day Acts chapter 13 verse 27 Acts chapter 15:21 I'll take skip skip 13 1521 for Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him being read in the synagogues every Sabbath day 2 Corinthians 3:14 the scripture says but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same Veil un taken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Veil is done away in Christ but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart look at this epistle in Colossians chapter 4 and 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 look at what Paul says about this epistle verse 16 closing the chapter closing the book he says when this epistle is read among you cause that it be read also in the Church of the Leo Deans and that you likewise read the epistle from leod DEA 1 Thessalonians chap 5: 27 says I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy Brethren so this is Paul telling the church to read this epistle not part of it not some of it not the part you like all of it so that the church can hear all the words of the law now this is a a beautiful understanding to be able to take all of the word have it be read in our hearing and for the purpose that we would learn to fear the lord and not to fear our circumstances not to fear what man can do unto you God has given us a tremendous Heritage when he has revealed his word to us there's nothing greater it there's no greater document than the word of the Lord and when that is dropped down into your life into your spirit into your heart you'll become a new person a new man and you can have whatever that word says you can have irrespective of who believes believes it and who does not believe it he said in his word it will not return void he also says that faith it comes by hearing and hearing comes by the word of the Lord so this is how and why we gather it's the highlight of the service it's the most important part it's a part that you should be taking notes of it's the part this is the part where your spiritual man is being fed through the word of the Lord now this is profound it's it's tremendous now the the the the Lord tells us in his Commandments it's it's included in there in Deuteronomy chapter 20 and that is the Commandment to not fear do not fear them he actually gives this commandment and uh he's instructing Israel in these things and I want you to take a scripture there if we can take which one did I call Deuteronomy chapter 20 and let's see if we can read a little bit of that okay I think I printed it out here maybe I didn't I'll pick it up right here Deuteronomy chapter 20 verses number 1- 4 and then we'll touch on verse number eight when thou goest out to battle against thine enemies and see horses and chariots and people more than thou be not afraid of them for the Lord thy God is with thee which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt and it shall be when ye are come nigh unto the battle that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people and shall say unto them here o Israel ye approach this day unto the battle against your enemies let not your hearts faint fear not do not tremble neither be terrifi because of them for the Lord your God is he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies to save you and the officer shall speak further unto the people and they shall say what man is there that is fearful and fainthearted let him go return into his house in other words stay home go home go back if you're fearful and you're afraid because fear is contagious and unbelief is contagious too and it's a very strong voice and it's so strong and so powerful this is what is against your faith the reason why we don't walk in our healing is because of unbelief sin remember Israel was healed and they walked in their healing until sin enter into the camp and we don't like to look at it that the reason why we're sick is because of sin but sin is unbelief and when the word of God already declared that we are already healed what does it do me any good speaking something contrary to the word that's already been declared over your healing the Lord is with you don't fear them you've already won the victory has already been won he fought the Battle and he won he won after three days and night he won that day on Calvary he won when he got up from the grave with all power in his hands and he gave that power to his church amen these are promises these are blessings that you the believer should walk in you know we see that in Judges chapter 7 as well that Gideon tell tells those men that are fearful and afraid to go back because fear is contagious it has torment it has no value in it it's not keeping it real it's keeping it false you say well I'm just keeping it real I can see those giants they're bigger than they're you're not keeping it real that's contrary to the word you're breeding fear what I need is Faith because faith faith will sign my pardon faith will give my inner man the power to move forward and to go on faith is the victory that overcomes Le oysa overcomes the world and the Temptations and the lies of the devil it's your faith not you're crying not that you deserve it not it's your turn that you know it wasn't fair it's none of that is overcoming the overcoming power is your faith amen can I get a witness here this morning your faith overcomes the world it's by faith that whatever you're going through you will overcome by that now this fear has torment as the scripture says and it's contrary to the plan of almighty God but it's designed to be there because that's the rules to the game or to the battle EXA the Battleground is in your mind that was established and the prophet of God tells us that the that the human being is made up of those five senses in science tells us this see taste feel smell in here that's your body he said draw three rings and then he he brings it down to your spirit conscience memory reason affections and imaginations and then the third part that makes up the man is the soul where you either have faith or doubt and he said is there in the soul that's where the Battleground is and I was trying to process this whole idea of you know Faith coming by hearing the word of the Lord what word is is there greater than the word that's been recorded on tape think of that the message the voice of God the word of the Lord and I can even side with some of the brothers that would say you know well brother isra we have the best it's on the tapes why don't we just listen to the tapes because that was the word of the Lord made manifest and I I go with that and I agree with that absolutely and then when I'm listening to the tapes he tells us how to raise our family how to baptize how to do church so what am I supposed to do with that we just listen to it for the sake of listening to it or we to listen to it and then do it sir and this is that's the whole challenge right there not hating on nobody doesn't bother me one bit or the other whoever wants to believe half of it part of it twist it what that's not my business I I I'm coming to the understanding more and more it really doesn't matter what somebody else believe or don't believe I'm trying to get this man to believe every word and that is a challenge to get my inner man to believe every word and there so many demonic forces that are against me that have been brewed up in me from a little boy coming all the way up and I'm battling me more than anybody else so I need to spend my time on my knees before my word and my savior that he would give me the faith for a body change and for a Rapture amen amen who cares what the doctrine is who care who's off the work who cares what the next church is doing huh and so he brings it in this message the greatest battle ever fought he brings out the body the spirit and the soul and look at what he says here in this message just for a few moments now and paragraph 73 inside of the body is a soul and that soul is controlled by imaginations conscience memory reasons and affections that's the thing that controls the soul but the spirit it only has one sense oh let's get it the spirit has one sense and that sense is either dominates it is Faith or doubt that's exactly there's only one Avenue to it that's free moral agency you can accept doubt or you can accept Faith either one you want to work on therefore Satan begin at the principal part to cause the spirit of man to doubt God's word god began at the principal part to lay his word in that spirit that you are that's what does it so let's focus our mind just for a moment maybe I won't preach maybe I'll just talk for a few minutes okay and I hope something will be said that will help you but this let's go back and look at the Commandment to Joshua the Commandment was keep these words don't let it depart out of your mouth but then he tells them something that I I that I want to just focus in on he tells them to meditate now meditating is different than you speaking the word or hearing it spoke to meditate it goes into where you slow that word down you speed it up you break it up in little quarters you break it up into little 16 or whatever it is you break it you bring it back in you break it you bring it back you're meditating and He commands Joshua to meditate on these words I I guarantee you I guarantee you if you just take any Scripture and John 3:16 and you just don't read it like that or read it out of memory and you begin to meditate on you it will speak to you in a way that is never spoke to you before it's a it's a part of not just reading the word but it's reading it and then meditate when you're meditating you're absorbing it right amen Amen on a comprehensive level with your imaginations now your conscience your memory and your affections it's being downloaded a better way a different way huh very good amen so you take notes in the service so you can take those goes back and then meditate on them how many can see that a little bit the scripture actually tells us to do this me see if I can take a scripture here in 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verses number 1-8 I really love this scripture Paul is really sharing how the resurrection happened and he's talking about how 500 saw him and then a group above that saw saw him and then his disciples saw him and then after that James saw him and then last of all I saw him it's a beautiful documentation how Paul lays that out but he says this moreover Brethren I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you which you also have received and wherein you stand by which ye also are saved if you keep in memory what I've preached unto you unless you have believed in vain for I've delivered unto you first of all that which also I received and so this uh word memory in uh it's it doesn't really use a Greek word there it um it's a Greek phrase that the Greek diaglog talks about and the other translations bring it in it means to hold firmly if you retain and the King James version says keep in memory and so I was talking to the Saints to the young people about if I was to encourage a young man coming up I've been 30 plus years following the Lord and I if I can encourage a young man or a group of young people and that would be to begin to develop those skills of memorizing the scripture and what it's doing it's writing it in your heart you're hiding the word you're documenting it in your heart now a lot of people can memorize scripture it's just a memory but you're going to memorize something you will memorize something why not it be the scriptures use the ram in your head to download the word he said well Brothers memorizing scripture don't save nobody okay go memorize the rap music like some of us did and tell me how that work out for you or memorize the garbage that's out there huh your memory you're going to mem remember something and so recording this and memorizing this and so I I shared this I think with brother Joe and this little book and I shared it with the youth there and I'll share it here today I ran into this gentleman that was into this scripture memoris ation his name is Thomas Meyer he's a professional he he remembers books and books of the he can quote the entire Book of Revelation by memory and so 20 years ago I was doing a job in Tombstone and I I was taking a break I was by myself and I went to have lunch and I'm in there my paint clothes and here comes this guy white guy okay just to help you with your context so he comes in there yeah yeah come on you're glad you got that information it's all he comes in into the restaurant it's an empty restaurant brother George and this guy ask me can I sit at your table and have lunch with you I'm like okay here we go weirdo weirdo it's a empty restaurant we in Tombstone what do you want to sit at my table for so he sits down and he introduces himself his name is Thomas Meer and he told me he memorizes the scripture so I said what does Malachi 4 say and he quoted it from the beginning the entire chapter and I was shocked and so I took his number and we exchanged this was 20 plus years ago I enjoyed it and a few years ago I looked him up and he's still doing his thing he's married it's his ministry I think he's been in these great places and great halls and so Sharon and I went to um Cincinnati and we saw the arc enclosure there the ark experience how many he's been there beautiful it's tremendous it's just it'll blow your mind so at the bookstore there there's a book by Thomas Meyer and I grabbed and said Sharon I met this guy I I knew him so I bought that book it's a Bible actually in principles and I gave it to the young man that was baptized the other day hope he reads it but in that book he gives these three pillars for memorizing the scripture and I liked it and actually it's scriptural if you'll dig deeper into the word and those three pillars are that you read the scriptures out loud number two is that you hear the scriptures being read coming through your hearing and you actually write them down these things begin to help to develop the scriptures and he says and I I like it he says find a place that you need the word to speak to you on where you're dealing in your life and then start memorizing those scriptures because you can use that in your memory now memorizing the scriptures doesn't save you but believing a scripture that has been memorized will save you and it will help you and I was trying to place brother Joe for years at a time this whole internet in the how to handle it you know should I smash my my my my smartphone should I just get rid of it altogether how can I incorporate it in my life life and I was just really dealing with that brother Howard and what this internet and how how it's just taken over it's like electricity it's like electricity we use it we all use it we consume it we're all part of it and as I was meditating on that I thought you know the Lord knew that the internet would be here in this age he didn't allow it to come when brother Brandon was here I believe that's on purpose but he allowed it to come in this and I was like oh yes the reason why for a Believer now the internet exists is so that I can consume the word in a better way and that is the only reason as it pertains to a Believer because if it's not uh in agreement with my faith and my body change and for the Rapture it's just nonsense and the age is full of these channels of darkness and evil and distractions trying to take away my faith and here we are in an age the darkest of all the ages and God has given us these devices that we can comprehend we can consume we can slow it down we can record it we can put it in Brick print we can put it on any device we can consume his word and if you're using using it for any other purpose then you tell me what it's about internalize that think about it just for a moment think about it just for a moment if the internet that you're using is for any other purpose outside of a Rapture in the body change then tell me its use and value what's the value for it For Your Entertainment for your fun huh huh what's the value of it so that's my little piece you can take it or well just take it that so with that in mind I went further into the scriptures and how the scriptures are telling us to to avoid profane babblings and things that war against your soul let let me ask you this if it's wrong for me to say it do you think it's wrong for me to hear it to or to see it because this is this is our spirit man this is who we are conscience memory reasons affections and imaginations is who we are and the enemy wants to use all of those channels yes he does and if you're a good soldier and a steward of the word you'll recognize that and you'll see that the main thing in this whole the whole purpose of being here is that my faith would be ready we don't have faith enough for tooth a let alone a Rapture of Divine Healing think of it so what should be encouraged it should be our faith let's take a scripture here in 1 Timothy Chap 4: 11-16 and look at that in light of the greatest battle ever fought these things command and teach verse 12 let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of Believers in word in conversation that word conversation means conduct in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in Purity till I come give what attendance to what the magazines reading the headlines you're going to read something what reading is he talking about what am I supposed to give attendance to reading of what what is Paul telling Timothy to give yourself in the tendance to reading to reading what I knew it was going to tighten up I didn't know it was going to get that tight attendance to reading to exhortation to Doctrine neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by Prophecy with the laying on of hand of the prosperity what did it say there meditate upon these things give thyself holy to them that thy profiting may appear to all take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them for in doing this thou shallal both save thyself and them that hear thee Ephesians 4:22 and3 says that you put off concerning the former conversation of the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust how many's been born again and you know what the scripture is talking about the old man the things you used to do the old man tell me why the movies and the system out there is always trying to attract the old you and the word of the Lord is trying to speak into the new man that's right the new you the one that's built up by faith tell me tell me there it's it's by Design to catch your attention catch your eye keep you busy busy busy with everything but the word of the Lord mhm it says put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind the Lord and that you put on the new man which is after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness and wherefore put away lying speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another be angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labor working with his hands the things which is good that he may give to him that needeth let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed unto the day of your Redemption so if no corrupt communication is to proceed out of your mouth long as I don't say it but I can listen to some corruptness or I can look at some corruptness and I just might giggle at some corruptness cu the movie was funny it was entertain me entertaining if if no corrupt communication is supposed to come out of my mouth does do you think I have a green light to let corrupt communication come into my hearing huh come on Saints come on Believers we're talking about the Rapture we're talking about a body change talking about give no place to the devil I wrestle with this I grapple with this and I find that I can use the internet if it's magnifying the Lord outside of that just get a big TV and put it in your home cuz you were better off with five or 10 channels then the internet in 5G or whatever G it is yeah I know I'm preaching to an internet group brother KK you know 20 years ago we be on fire them Devils with the TVs in their home uhhuh we'd be on fire preaching against those Believers that are not so spiritual because they have a TV but I don't have a TV or television in who can boast about that now where the TV boolers at now caras full of the internet and when we touch it I know Satan don't like it but Faith cometh by hearing and you need to hear the word on the Lord on any corrupt communication don't let it come out of your mouth don't let it come in your eyes don't let it come in your ears and you can control that yeah Hallelujah get more space of your internet so you can download more of the word [Applause] Lord Jesus hallelujah oh my I started brother George I got to finish it here what the word says here 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 21-23 maybe I'll have to close with this or maybe I'll keep going somebody said I got time take a Time have we reached a quarter part of the day yet a quarter part of the day they was reading the word reading reading reading and then after they got done with that they confessed and they worship for a quarter of the day what's the rest of your day goingon to be like after you started it like that you tell me 1 Thessalonians 5:21 to 23 the Bible says prove all things hold fast to that which is good abstain from what huh abstain from Evil no no no he didn't say Asain from Evil estain from all [Applause] appearance of evil is that the Bible and the Very God of Peace do what to you sanctify you holy and I pray pray God your whole spirit and soul and see taste feel smell here your body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ this is a new this is new word for me this is this is me I'm working out in the gy of Faith right now I'm pulling up the quotes on faith and trying to purify my mind and my spirit and that's the gymnasium I've been in I've been working on it I'm not where I need to be but I am not going back to what I used to be because I maybe didn't say it and maybe I didn't start the foolishness but I sat there and I listened to it and I laughed at it and I somehow enjoyed it and I left it that that's what the worldly people do but I sat there with my body and consumed it with my eyes with my ears and I enjoyed it and I imagined with it and I and I and my my lust and all of that thing was all worked up in that and then I'm trying to make a Rapture when the Bible says to Holy commit yourself unto these things holy your whole body your spirit and your body your spirit and your soul that he'll preserve you blameless until the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ amen look at your neighbor and say neighbor all means all obstain somebody want to give a high five go ahead and give him a high five and say obstain from all appearance in your soul in your body and in your spirit obstain from it just Lord help me and then put the internet on with this scripture right next to it and consume all you want okay I don't got a problem with the internet I love it I like my automobile too I like electricity too I like all those benefits and blessings as they help me serve the Lord and if it's not then check what it's all about then you tell me why you getting mad at me why you getting mad at the subject it's not you getting mad it's the spirit the FR that wants to be your friend the evil spirit that wants to be your friend to get you to continue in the filth and the nonsense that the internet has to offer and it ain't doing nobody any good it'd be better off if we had nothing but live live under a tree somewhere and preach the gospel be better off but if you going to use it use it to his Advantage yes now I love the internet now oh y'all thought I was against it I'm for it now I'm for the internet 100% download it King James version Old Testament New Testament all the seals download all of it how many you understand what I'm saying you said brother we know you got to work yeah you got to work so you can get some money so you can pay your bills so you can serve the Lord right and that's those are the things that you need but you don't need to see the newest whatever movie that's coming out you don't need to see that huh that's right all right all right let's take one more scripture Hebrews 4:12 I'm going to close here for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing as center of the soul and the spirit and the joints and Marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts in the intents of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do you notice something how it says that the word of God is quick and powerful and then it goes into he is a discerner for the word is a person yes it is that is the Lord Jesus Christ in word form amen how many believe that just shall live by faith not by the internet live by faith not by your job live by faith the just shall live by faith we are alive today if we're the Justified and we're alive because of our faith our Revelation in this word amen we holy believe we shun profane things in Babel we um you know you your faith can company with anyone just so long as your faith is the one doing all the Talking if somebody else is doing the talking and it's not your faith then get out of that conversation get out of it because really what we're here for brother Kurt is that our faith that the faith that God gave to us to be sons and daughters in God that that would grow in us so much so that our body would change now I I realize that some of these things are very high and very you know it's a lot it's a lot to chew on but but somebody's GNA chew on them and I know that everybody can't see you maybe not see the importance of these things but you know what there was Elijah was taken up in a whirlwind he was the only one maybe others after said hey I want it to but he was the only one but God used him the love you Rebecca she was the one who got the ride with the camels and maybe after her some other sisters come man where's my camel train well you got to do what Rebecca did we know everybody came walk on water that Camel yes everybody can't walk on water but Peter did and everybody can't have all the blessings and the promises but if it's in the word of the Lord and this is how this is this has been revolutionary for me if it's in the word of the lord it's mine Hallelujah and you know what and you know what I don't have to ask anybody if it's okay if I can have it or or not because he told me everything in here is mine if I can believe it all things are possible to them that believe all all things are possible to them that believe that's me that's you that believe amen amen I believe if you take that word down in your heart and your spirit it will bless you and it will help you amen reexamine that content it's on inter it's Grievous it's Grievous I'm not talking about even the bad bad bad stuff there's some real bad stuff out there but then there's some stuff that's like questionable and it's not even Christian and it's like you can't even watch a movie without somebody swearing and then I got used to hearing them swearing think of that right think of that brother brother man brother sister think of that and then I'm listening to the movie and they're and and and they're cursing and then they're swearing and then I uh that's not me that's not me but it is kind of funny you know what be better off I don't see no movies yes sir now if if I get the other side to that and say the liberalism of you know just do whatever you want to do and then go forward then I wouldn't listen to me preach I guarantee you I'm I wouldn't sit under anything like that no no no no no no no no these are the convictions that that that that you know as I was grapp I've grappled with this for years should I get rid of my phone and just get a you know dialup or whatever kind of phone there is and the Lord just you know I can use my phone and have my phone as long is it pertains to my body change because really that's the greatest thing that I don't want to miss is the rapture of the church and being ready and I don't want to be caught off guard with this foolishness and nonsense and me the content that I'm not really promoting it but I'm kind of laughing at it and I'm enjoying it along with you I'll give you a chance I'll let you digest that you can't can't say Amen you can't run the house to it but think about it think about that think about it amen God bless each of you richly how many love me I love you too amen so go tell your friends
