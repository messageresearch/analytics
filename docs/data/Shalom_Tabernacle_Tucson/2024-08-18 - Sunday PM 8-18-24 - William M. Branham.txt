first one here in Tucson a few years back the night of worship I forget it's the online choir forget the name of what it's called what its name is but and then there's a banquet on Friday night and we had planned we got our tickets way back and then you know as you know this season has just been a really you know a lot of folks have died and the different travel things that have come about and so um this last trip we were last weekend in Montreal had such a wonderful time it's it's been nine years since I was last there and uh in in the country in Canada so the Lord worked it out we were able to to go and that Sunday morning last Sunday morning I was there with brother Malcolm there you all met him during our special meetings we had a wonderful service there and then Sunday night two hours North with brother Ferguson's one of the groups there um in shawinigan we had a wonderful service there um we had some trips planned a salmon fishing trip planned but there's a huge storm I think it was Debbie they called it came from the US and it hit and it turned everything upside down and we were way up North anyways and so um um we had we did some work in one of the cabins up there and uh Levi and myself and Grandpa brother Ferguson he's 70 see I'm 54 he's 74 years old and he is strong as ever and just um yeah I just pray the Lord I'll have that strength strength I think it's because

chartered boat or whatever that was cancelled so we he took us up to his a cabin that he has way way up North no cell phone service nothing we were the only ones on the lake and um it was exactly what I needed so thank the Lord for that we caught a lot of little bitty brook trout but they were so good and tasty and we had just a wonderful time you know the Lord brought us back here safely and um so

amen I'm not sure if brother brandom seats us but we'll stand for remain standing for the reading of the word I we want to read some of God's Eternal Word and speak to us a few moments from the scriptures and then have prayer for the sck oh how I love to talk about him W you I just love to talk about him now I want to reads out of the Bible 2 Kings the 2 chapter the 12th verse a portion of it and Elijah saw it and cried my father my father the Chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof and now for way of a a text or a subject I want to speak on a second-handed robe so may the Lord add His blessings as we talk to you this morning and you be in prayer for us during this time of the reign of Israel in the land Israel was a nation and it was a mighty nation and it was kind of a peaceful time among the military part of it but in the uh spiritual part of it it was uh kind of an a time of of impersonation and if we look back into the Old Testament we can always uh find uh examples of what's going on today always in the Bible the things that are now are just the antitypes of what was at the beginning now the Book of Genesis produces everything that's in the world today there's nothing in the world but what didn't begin in Genesis for it is the beginning in there started every ISM and Genesis started every uh thing that started and the true church started in Genesis and the false Believers started in Genesis and the indifference started in Genesis Genesis was the beginning and now during the reign of Elijah or the pilgrimage of Elijah here on Earth which was uh God's Prophet for the hour and God has never left himself on the earth without a witness God has always somewhere someplace had a person that he could put his hands on and would stand for a witness so if he did that down since Genesis the beginning surely not somewhere God has a man that he can lay his hand on now for he he's more than one man now he has many man that he can lay his hand on because we're coming down to the the Gathering time the Harvest Time Genesis was the pling of the seed and these 6,000 years has been the maturing of the Harvest and now the seed has become a seed itself it's went back to the Blossom and from the blossom to the to the fruit and it's the Gathering time now Harvest Time all all the great things have started the true church has started in Genesis has come down to the fruit time the Fruit of the Spirit and the Antichrist that started in Genesis has come down to its fruit and we're just in the closing time of this world entire dispensation the of the Marty be and and we it's the greatest time that anyone or at any age ever Liv is this time it's a shaking time it's a Troublesome time for Sinners but it's a marvelous time for Christians because we know that we are are packing up are gathering the last little efforts together to go home and meet the Lord now people today as you look around and see the Great trouble and distress facing the nation or a few nights ago I was talking to someone was one of these here to Lookout agents that watches and they said brother Bram we were just instructed by the government never to advise people anymore to lay down by the wait from the window on the floor at the bomb hit or never to go into a basement because this new bomb that they could radio guide from Moscow a four Street low and hit right on the street shoot it up it's got T things in it to explos it takes it so many thousands so many thousands got it to the stars and rayar and drop it exactly on Fourth Street in Louisville from Moscow Russia and when it would hit there don't have to ra use a plane or nothing just scre off your and it'll land right there and it will blow a hole in the ground of the area uh the depth of 175 ft for 15 square miles either way go 15 square miles there ain't nothing to do but get ready to take a flight up stairs is the only thing to do well that time come y think they shoot 50 of them or 100 of them at one time if wanted to it'll all be over within the space of I believe it's a 60 or 80 minutes or seconds rather from there to here through the interation of the whole thing would take place there wouldn't be nothing left between Louisville and Henryville and between Louisville and and bar toown are down in there but one hole in the ground a bunch of dust Lan that's all would be left besides the eies that would go out and burn for miles and miles and miles beyond that and while one's are dropping there and another one's dropping over somewhere else to meet with it I'm so glad that we have a shelter the name of the Lord is a mighty tower the rightous run into it and our safe no matter how many bombs or how many anything else if we're safe there so the world and the cner not having this shelter of this safety place it's a shaking time I believe if I wasn't a Christian I'd go crazy the thinking of what might happen at any time and with a house full of little kitties and everything I wouldn't know what to do but I'm so glad that I can stand in my house and introduce to them a shelter that no bomb could ever touch or nothing else the protecting wings of the Lord Jesus not by power not by might but by my spirit sayith the Lord that is our protection and what a great glorious time it is to know that all sin and struggles and trials of life will soon be over it'll all finish one of these days and we'll go home to be with the Lord now what's left is a time to preach the gospel and to bring into this great tower as much as many as we can and then as we see the pattern of our lesson today of Elijah doing his Reign he or his pilgrimage on Earth while he was a great mighty man God was using him in Mighty ways with Mighty power and we find out that during this time there was a group of impersonators who tried to impersonate Elijah who tried to do the same things Elijah done and so we find the same thing today impersonations of Christianity people who try to act like Christians who try to make themselves Christians you can't do that God has to do that he's the only one who can do it so they farmed a school and called it the school of the prophets and they all went up to the school of the prophets and the educated them and I can imagine all those preachers up there wearing the same kind of coat that Elijah wore I can imagine trying to impersonate him on his voice the way he spoke and and way he presented himself everyone trying to do the same thing because Elijah was a great man used of God and we find the same thing today I listening to the radio broadcast not long ago they got Billy Grims all over this country since Billy was in loable everybody trying to imp make the same thing almost comb their hair the same way and and wear the same thing and same kind of uh voice and so forth but you can't do that you just got to be who you are and what God made you to be that's right and so we find how that perhaps in them days the same thing took place now God seeing foreseeing that Elijah's days was numbered that he had so long he could stand here on Earth as everyone has so he was going to have a successor to Elijah and when he did God called this man he wasn't in no Seminary when he called him he was plowing in a Feld with a yoke of ox doing uh the service of taking care of his mother and father and God called him to be the successor of Elijah or Elijah perhaps many up to the school thought they were surely going to be his successor they was going to wear his robe as soon as he was finished with it but God does the calling God does the choosing God does the electing God does the setting in order God has set in the church some Apostles some prophets some teachers some evangelists and pastors God does that himself we cannot make one uh hair black or white neither can we add one thing to our statute by taking thought God in his infant Grace and by his election and his for knowledge sets these things in order and every Wheel Works just right I like that I would be a discouraged man this morning if I didn't believe in the election and calling of God if I thought that this world was left to the outcome of it by the power of man and by the wisdom of man and by the big fours and the UN and who never even mentioned God's name I be a discouraged person but I'm not looking to that for the outcome I look down in the pages of this old book here where God wrote it out in everything will come just exactly the way he said it that's all so the only thing for me to do is not line up with them but line up with Calvary line up with God line up with his word saying his word no matter how much it looks like it's going to be that way it's going to be way God intends it to be it can't be nothing else or being infant know the end from the beginning and he makes everything come to his praise that's right all things will have to work together everything will have to shape right up this place my if that wouldn't make the courage in a Christian amen nothing can go wrong after all it's not our battle it's his amen it's not our wisdom it is the only one thing we had to do is put our faith and trust there and set still and see the glory of God Amen yeah moves around to its place never wheel moving it may be scattered from side to side but it'll move right into its right place when God speaks the wordu he knew the end from the beginning he knew he to choose he knew Elisha would take Elijah's place before the world was ever form amen everything has to work just exactly right and we're worried about our loved ones and so forth will they ever come in their names if they were written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world they'll work right in there that's the only thing you can do we give Witnesses Shine the Light God does the one that brings them to them now notice in Elijah then after uh he threw his robe on him and tried it on him other words Elijah the prophet who had the mantle of God on his shoulders he came down and laid it across Elisha the farmer to see if it would pit him and it take me about 10 years to get older to fit that man you know God usually puts us in the shop and trims us up now he didn't alter his robe to fit Elijah he ordered Elisha to fit the Rob and that's what he does today he ERS us to fit the Rob not the RO to fit us sometimes we want to make the road fit us but we can't do that you got to let be altered yourself for the RO it's God's robe and he made it perfect and we've got he's got to bring us into that real to make the Rob finished so we can't be perfect ourselves we know we can't there's no way for us to be and yet he said for us to be so but what he did he made a preparation for us the Lord Jesus Christ and his righteousness that's where the Perfection comes of ignoring our own Holiness of which we have none and our own thoughts which ought not to be but we rest solemnly upon the finished work of the Lord Jesus God sent him to the Earth and it was in him that we rest amen notice all these years as far as we know he just had that one baptism of the Rob going over him but through the years God had molded the man's character into a place that where every called that he would fit into the RO and be the servant of the Lord and then when Elijah passed through and thr it on him and he started up towards gilg and many of the other places they went on to the school of prophets on the road Journey on and finally Elijah was trying to get Elisha to turn back did you notice it trying to get him to turn back to I otherwise maybe the road's a little too steep for you son maybe it's a little too narrow for you to walk you know where Elijah walk was straightness and wherever God's true servant preaches the gospel it's a straight unadulterated gospel for it's preach well one day he went up there to the school of the prophets to visit him and they asked him to leave it said it's too straight around here for us what we need today is some more straight gospel preaching that'll separate the wheat from the chat or the right from the wrong make what's right's right what's wrong is wrong all these fellows with their experience all that they were they sent out to get something to eat and one of them got a wild Vine and gathered some wild gourds and cooked up some death in their ecclesiastical pot and the first thing you know they cried out there's death in the pot but Elijah was a double potion know what to do so he put a handful of meal in the pot said now go right ahead and eat it in other words that today in a type I would think that we've got a lot of Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran Pentecostal and everything else all mixed together and one fighting against the other and we don't need to OU the whole thing and do away with it we need another handful of meal keep the same church the meal was from the house of the school there which was the meal offering that the people brought in and the first fruits of the heart which was ground with a certain bird that made every grain of meal the same and then when this meal being the same was the type of Christ meal is life and when the type of Christ the meal being ground up the same meaning Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and the meal in the meal offering and when they put this meal into there putting Christ into death brought life amen that's what makes the difference in our dead form in our differences in our ecclesiastical arguments and everything if we would just bring Christ into it it would change death and separation into life if we were just do it thank you there's 19 million Baptists in America there's 13 million methodists in America there's 11 million Luthers in America and 10 million Presbyterians in America and God only knows how many Catholics which outd do any of the denomination but in all of it what do we need a handful of meal we need to bring life to the church and Christ is the life amen he came to bring us life so they had their disputes and their schools and their the theologies and so forth and then Elijah told Elisha you better turn back because the way may be a little hard but a man of God who's once tasted or been sowed across his shoulder the robe of God's righteousness and power is not too easy to turn back when I heard the pastor say this morning that are many are becoming discouraged what we need Brothers take courage what we need is to be in courage amen that's right trials may come we never L promised to be immune from him but he'll give Grace to go through them if the Mountain's too high to go over too deep to go under too wide to go right he'll give Grace to go through it right just don't worry but keep your eyes on Christ for he's the only one that can take us through now we see him as a journey on to the school and he said you stay here now be here and settle down and be a good teacher of Theology and so forth and you probably someday may become the dean of the college here but I've got to go on down a little farther could you imagine a man of God being satisfied to be a dean of a college one the power of God LA right around where he was standing no sir he said as the Lord liveth in your soul live I'll not leave I like that they no matter how much discouraged it comes from your mother your papa or from your pastor amen onto the Jordan they went they crossed over and Elijah said now what will you that I do for you he said a double potion of your spirit to come upon you know what he had a work to do he said a double potion not just a good a warm EXP experience not just a good handshake or a good fellowship with the rest of the church but why I want is a double potion of what's the best now I tell you when God sets a man for a world P he's got to have something better than the world's God he's got to have something better than the church's God he's got to go for a double potion if there ever was a time that a double potion is needed it's the day in the reals out the people something better something higher I can't I think Beans and Cornbread is very good but sometimes I have to reach up a little higher and we do that we've got to we got to keep climing Israel was backsliding if it kept staying on the same ground she's got to be moving on or moving back that's the way the church is so as they went along wasn't but a few minutes until he said you've asked a great thing but nevertheless if you see me when I go you can have what you ask for now that has to be tangl of motive tangl of Heart tangl of ey keeping your eye on the promise Hallelujah if you're sick this morning if you are afflicted there's one great promise not by Elijah but by God himself if thou can't believe when you pray believe that you get what you ask for and you shall receive it no matter what the doctor says how much this goes or that goes keeps Sangle on the promise Elijah give him a condition if you see me when I go it'll come on you there's the promise if thou can't believe all things are possible to them that believe [Music] sometimes I look at myself and think I've been such a jellyfish in my life I have waited and missed many thousands of souls into the kingdom because I waited and said God depended too much on a spiritual gift and said Lord if you'll just show me if you'll give me a vision what to do and God give the vision then I'll turn around and let somebody talk me into something else and all I have never come to the spot yet until I like I have at this time that I feel it's a Fai that we must step out there because it's a promise and the things that he has done and the healings that he has performed and the Miracles in much has come down and had his picture taken by the side of it and so forth which is never been KNN since the world began and then stand around like a jelly it even makes me discouraged with myself it's time to keep your eye on the promise that's what by God's grace I aim to do it I realize that every devil or Hell will shoot at it but by God's grace I a to keep my eye on the promise Elijah said if you Elijah said if you see me when I go you will have what you ask for amen that's right you got to keep your eye on it watch the promise what to school if you turn back to Bo how am I doing now I behind the prophet he a fail madebe but he didn't care what the school thought what all the teachers thought he didn't care what the neighbors thought or the houses or who looked at him he kept his faith in the promises what we need today is faith in the promise of God I don't pay no attention to what this one says or that one says as a brother said a minister had two girls that were mute and that the criticism all divine healing that the children cannot be healed don't pay no attention to the critics keep your faith on the promise God said so a prayer of fa shall save the sick and God shall raise them up if he can make one you to he he can make another death here we know byble proof that he does that amen he our face on the promise our eyes single our ears single our heart single and one thing on Jesus Jesus Christ and he's able to perform that which he has promised oh when we think of that it changes the whole thing when we get that God made the promise God was the one that said it now hear was God's representative set it and now God himself has set it then what can we do nothing but keep our mind on that that if you see me when I go away you can have the promise Elisha kept his eyes on Elijah no matter what how for each side what taking place on each side what taking a place before back he never even looked at he kept his eyes on the promise there you are your eyes on the promise I think of the lady that we visited the other night sister sty and the doctor telling her how bad she was and I never told her a totally loved one and how impossible it be for her to ever get well now brother or son-in-law asked me about it I said if she can keep her eyes on the promise no matter what takes place keep your eyes on the promise a few weeks ago sister wood sharing brotherwood two bosom friends of ours here at the church I was in Michigan with my friends Leo and Jean we left the Chicago meeting went to some of their people to for two days to go deer hunting with bulls and arrows and on my road in fact my wife had got a hold of me and she said pray for Miss Woods's mother a caner as eating off her face and said I have never seen sister wood th alarm she's weeping sister wood has always been a hero of Faith since God healed her boy a crippled leg and to heal her with TV and so forth but she had given down there is the room that night we prayed coming in Mrs wood said brother vam we'll go over and we went to her mother which was and she' had a cancer on the side of the nose and the doctor had tampered with it scattered it to just a little ring the side of her nose up just about eigh of an inch from her eye just a bone laying there done eating just as fast as it could eat away go into the room and I knelt down I said I want to speak to her alone and I go into the room to pray with the woman and while in the room I thought oh God if you just show me a vision of what's going to happen to the woman Mr Miss Wood sitting on the outside waiting to see what the Visions would say but while I was there I got condemned I was condemned by waiting for a vision seemed like something referred back wasn't the calling what you need a vision when the promis has already been said so I knelt down and prayed and my PR something just anchored on the inside the faith of the promise come back out and Mrs wood when I told her about she said did you see anything brother R I said I never exactly seen anything but I felt something that told me that his promise was true and he was going to do it and I believe that he's going to do it and less than 24 hours the end of that cancer begin to break away and a scab form over cancers don't scab as you know let it say so there was now in the woman is healed in home what a wonderful Christ by keeping eyes on the promise God said so but when we are prayed for sometimes we go off and say well it wasn't done just immediately so maybe we better go back again oh no keep your eye on the promise God said so that settles it amen that's all of it if God said so God's able to keep his promise or he never make it Abraham called those things which were not as though they were and for 25 years only impossible because he counted God was able to perform what he had promised and we are the children of Abraham by faith certainly Elijah kept his eyes on Elisha on Elijah and as he went home and after a while the chair come and parted him one to one side and the other and Panda he picked up Elijah upon he stepped on the CH and went up and put his Ro uh off his shoulders and stood back to Elijah because Elijah had grown into it you know s of sit him right and could you imagine oh I want you to give me your undivided attention as I feel my trth tickling I want to ask you something could you imagine how Elisha felt when he picked up this rob plac it upon his own shoulders oh what a feeling I don't mean this to be personal but about 10 years ago from the bullpit year I preached on a sermon David the lawyer with a swing in his hand and Glides before him in them days there were no healing campaigns on the field nowhere as we knew of and oh how critical people were on Divine Healing but there was something at meeting with a being and the pastors told me that I was losing my mind that it couldn't be so but from this same box here I spoke on David said do you mean to tell me that this the armies of the Living God will let that uncircumcised Philistine deide this Army a little old stoop shouldered curly haired boy with a sheep skinn coat on and a sling shot in his hand well the whole Army of Israel standing back up and he alone walks out with a man with a with a spear some 19 ft long and a thing on the end of it we s Shon maybe 20 lb of Steel Shen a 19t spear with fingers 14 in long and David probably weigh 90 lbs and stood bounced up and down like a little Bandy rooster and saying you mean to tell [Applause] me that you let that uncircumcised for this if he stays in his place let him stay but he's defying the armies of the Living God oh what a hero and all of you Afra that go f that let me have Oh my he said the god of Heaven let me kill a lamb with a slingshot he let me kill a bear with a slingshot and how much more will he deliver that uncircumcised philistin into my hand certainly and when the first victory was won and Goliath was down the whole armies of Israel follow DAV and CH head and beat Israel beat the Philistines come into their own land they back them into their corners and slaughtered them and Tuck their cities and everything and had the victory brother and sister the same thing has been done and the rims of the N Supernatural when they said Divine heing can not work the days of Miracles is passed if the days of Miracles is pass the days of God is passed amen the church that don't believe in Supernatural will finally die and God and leave the church am has to and God gave the promise and God's promises is eternal amen here some time ago when some girls was uh fing with radium and would dip it and paint their radium hands on the watches I have some on this one and a girl made a mistake and tucked the breast and stuck it in her mouth it killed her and years and years later they took a microscope and put it on the skull of that girl and they could still hear that radium going on it's endless it keeps working on and on there's no stopping to it and old rather if radium has that kind of an effect inless how much more will the endless Eternal Supernatural all power all inant allmighty God we has to have the same effect as he started he has to have all to for he's not the allmighty all of God he's still waiting for somebody with a burning face that will step out and challenge the enemy on the basis of his word and say that it's so amen and now what happen as soon as the great heating campaign started then thousands of soldiers of God's man who laid back in little churches like or Rob Tommy Hicks and many of the other outstanding men on the field pull her sword and away they went this sword that cuts both coming and going up and down and in and out a deser of the thought even to the m they told their bibles are sword walk that way they seen that it could be done and we beat the Enemy by the grace of God the whole world had a healing Revival amen be done little pastors who had little 2x4 churches and so forth caught fire and seen the vision jerk The Sword and went forth and defied the enemy how do you know there's great man Congressman up King George of England and many great men who laid sick and Afflicted are healed by the power of almighty God so can't say nothing about it nowly he was and when Elijah after his whole heart's desire was to get that promise you want a promise that was his motive that was his all that was his life that was his intent everything all everything h on getting that amen un persuaded to believe that we're not sincere about this thing that we're talking about if your whole moies this morning rest upon giv God for my healing I'm determined to be healed by the power of God Amen I'm determined to live a chrisan life I'm determined to walk in peace with God I'm determined to do it I don't care what mother says what church says what pastor says what anybody else say what the world say undetermined that's the in my heart am you're going to get somewhere then when Elisha saw that he was determined El Elijah saw that Elijah was determined he gave him the promise now the promise was if thou can see me when I go if you can see me when I leave now it's up to Elijah he wanted to hear the promise so he got the promise now he said if if you can see me when I go now if you're sick this morning and you want to be healed I can prove to you Christ gave you the promise the promise is yours if thou can't if thou can don't be deal now Elijah wrapped in the robe of Elijah the prophet what a conquer March how he walk praying the hell as a p he heard the promise he F the power he was walking on the water right down the Jordan praise be to God friend every believer this morning that's WR in the righteousness of Christ is walking towards the J roll amen that's right let at Comic bombs come let [Applause] whatever walking the conquer amen fear not I overcome the world yes sir remember what I have overcome the world Christ did that Elijah was walking with a second-handed r bone even like a conquer God correctly coming to the Jordan brother let me say this in respects to you don't you put on somebody else's robe that's all moth eaten with doubt thr all these defeats and superstitions and ups and downs as but holes in it leaking all through you put on the Rob of the [Applause] conquer don't trust in your church who once taught salvation by the baptism of the Holy Spirit who must taught Divine Healing and now tonight all eat up with the MS of doubt and everything else RO with him that never lost the battle or you're on your road to Jordan [Applause] amen now he had on a second-handed ro that's true and many of the people this morning has second-handed Roes on but when he come to the Jan he realized that the RO alone wouldn't do the work amen right and the church the Methodist the Baptist the Pentecostal the Presbyterian oh we have school to M we have all the to the Bible down past we've got all the Rob and Rob all right the promises we've got it all oh we are baptized go down we're very Apostolic we add on the apostolic Fai we believe in Divine meing we believe in God we believe in the powers of God we' baptized in the Bible what the Bible says we received the Holy Ghost we spoken tongues we do all that but brother if that's the only thing you need you'll find your lack too when you come to Jord oh you may be tough you may be smart you may have a DD Dr Divinity you may have a PhD Dr philosophy you may have Dr you may have all kinds of degrees you may have the RO of the Methodist Church on here you may have a ro of Pentecostal Church on you you may have a ro of assemblies on you the oness of the trinitarians or whatever it might be there only a secondhand Ro to begin try some manmade D has been thought up so forth like that and even if you have been a Christian and the church has been a Christian and wrot correctly but when Elijah any conspicuous to a whole Bank line full of prophets and critics see what he would do and here he comes walking with Elijah's R he sced he's educated he's submitted he believes something wrong with him he's coming down under the J the world's watching oh God how we need that today with many school and educated Scholars with many men who can tear that Bible apart and set it together in mathematics many man who can do great things in the ways of teaching who knows Bible History to the very moment who tell you the hour the CH was L hour they can tell you all these things and there got the water baptism they got the spiritual baptism as they call it for RO they got everything just in order so El likeah but when he come down in this Garden to face the critical world what did he cry where is the god of Elijah it wasn't the r of Elijah it was the power of the god of Elijah that it and the thing the world needs this morning is the power of the god of Elijah you might have spoke with tongues and shouted in R the FL but what we need is the power of the god of Pentecost to produce the Li and things that was lived in that day a second-handed Rob was all right but he needed a fresh call in his heart from God he needed a fresh anoing from God He Wore a second-handed role when he come to the river but he needed a brand new firstand call from God and a firstand in power of God to perform the miracle my brother don't you be afraid to ask God anything you must demand God or ask God for anything that he has promised for in if I am introducing a God that's omnipotent and all powerful and if I be a servant of God I must do the works of God and if I do the works of God I must demand of God to bring these things to pass because he's demanding of me to produce the impossible amen I have to ask him I have to call stand they God you const so do you every person you shall receive power act8 amen after the Holy Spirit has come upon you after the Holy Spirit has come upon you after you're roed as a Christian after your faith is set in Christ then you shall receive power yes brother sister everyone of morning may I say this before praying for the sake may I say this by God's help you pray for me as I stood 10 years ago at this platform preaching on David and Goliath now it is a go that's hindered me God has slay him before me but the thing that's hindered me is a lack of faith the lack of something that I know was around and this morning before this little Tabernacle again I'm screaming where is the god who gave this where is the god who make me come forward God give me a cour give me a strength give me deter mind what comes what whatever it looks like move on the promise is true brother sister one of these days do you sinner friends here this morning and do you people who are trying to impersonate Christianity you may belong to church that's very fine I have nothing to say against that nothing against your fine scholarly education against your theology I have nothing against that but oh where is the god it wasn't Elijah after all it wasn't Elijah who opened up that River it wasn't his robe elishah took it from his shoulder he folded it just the same way that Elijah did but when he be to try to wave it there was no power there then he cried knowing that God was son where is that God where is he then something must have struck the prophet for he W that room and stuck the Wes and she opened her and before CLE clergy of that day before the CRS of that day he walked across the Jordan just like elij it did before him we don't need the teaching we have that but we need the god God El we need the power of the god of elij back in our church the power to make us whole there and call God's word rightly go and we're everyone here this morning as human beings on our road to Jordan and when he came to Jordan you're go to ride there one of these mornings what when he came to Jordan he was walking at a conquer but when he came to yard that was a difference he had a second-handed Rob on him another man had wore it but it was a good Rob and he knew what the man was that wore the Rob brother sister one of these mornings I got to come down to jar I thinking this afternoon we're going down to brother and sister rice don't forget that this is our golden wedding anniversary and believe the church here going to to have dinner with me I was think you the other day 50 years and I see them both well AED spping down I thought yes I'm 47 years old they just married three years before I was G 47 I'm marging towards J I've got to come down I've got to get there I'm going to arrive there it may been an accident on the road I may drop in the air in a plane I may be shot through with a devil's dark somewhere and die I don't I know how I'm going but there's one thing I know what I'm going and I'm walking towards J but when I get there I want to know one thing that I got a second-handed robe on too I ain't trusting in mine cuz it's no good or as soon as Elijah picked up Elisha's Rob he tore his into the pieces and threw it down that's the what it was when I found Christ I tore my own stuff up my own ideas my own nonsense my little petty thing I thought when I was a little badst preacher I just thought I was somebody but I tore it up I put on his robe and when I come to Jordan I want to find myself wrapped in his Rob amen you'll follow that and we'll arrive there one day so let us pray just a moment heavenly father as we're on our Jordan March this morning is conquerors some day we got to present something to the Jorden that's to death oh what a horrible thing it'll be a separation from God we can't cross over [Applause] no but Elijah when he got there he had on Elisha's Rob Elijah's Ro and when he took off the RO of the Elijah the man who had been well pleasing in your sight and you had accepted him and brought him up into heaven with you and Elisha was wearing his robe so he presented to the Jordan death the robe of Elijah and it was accepted and the Jordan opened and he walked across de God someday we got to come down we can't present our good works we have none we can't present anything in the world I don't even desire anything to try to present but I trust holy in the merits of Jesus you accepted him and raised him from the dead and he was brought into the presence of God and there will abide forever God I want to present that to you that I believe on him and I love him and by his grace he has closed us with his robe and I pray father that you'll help us now in the days of battle and where the man of God must do the work of God I pray that you'll let us take the robe of Christ the power of the Holy Spirit and call for The God Who Lived in him granted in Christ's name we ask it and while we have our head bowed I just wondering here this morning if there's a person who's trying to walk down to Jordan without the job on if there a person who has not the robe of Jesus Christ on you and though it was War One Time by the Son of God I wonder if you don't have that on this morning if you'd raise your hands to God and say dear God this hour I now want to accept it God bless you lady but someone else would raise your God bless you son someone else will just rais up your hand God bless you little boy God bless you young man someone else to raise your hand God bless you back there sir you say by God's help this morning I want to forsake my self-righteousness my own ideas and my thoughts of pleasures and Big Time and sin that I've lived in and I want Christ that put his robe on me this morning I'll use his robe I know it's a perfect one God bless you son someone else say I just raise you raise your hand I now want to accept the holy spirit in mind I want to be rolled in his righteous just when I get there that day I won't present myself and say well you know I bought somebody from coal I done this that's nice that's very nice but that something had to die for you to live and only through the act of that can you be saved will you raise your hand say Christ I now forsake my own ways I accept your ways I want you have mercy on me when I come to the end of the Lord God bless you Ladi God bless you all right now we're going to have pray now righteous Heavenly Father some 78 10 hands is went up I do not know their status th knowth all about them I do not know but they're in need today and they realize that they're in need and they're willing to come and accept help in a time of trouble to see that the Great hour it's at hand now the atomic bomb the great things is waiting for us and I pray heavenly father that you will bless these people and today lay your hand upon them and take away all their iniquity and doubt and may they throw away their old motheaten robe of self-righteousness or the cankerworms and the Crickets and the malls of superstitions and church entity has eat holes to it and they get hold any longer may they just throw it away and reach over and get the robe of the Lord Jesus say I trust in him I wrap myself not in my righteousness or on my own thoughts but from this hour
