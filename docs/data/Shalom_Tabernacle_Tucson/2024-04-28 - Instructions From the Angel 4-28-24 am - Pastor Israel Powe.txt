========================================

[Music] good morning everyone let's all stand we'll start our Sunday school we're going to be reading from the fourth seal Revelation 6 verse 7even and 8 but let's pray first Heavenly Father Lord we're standing father before you this morning Lord thankful in our hearts father that we could be here Lord to hear your word father and to grow in the grace and the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ father we just pray that you take the words that we'll hear Lord and apply them deep within our Soul and Spirit father Lord that we would be more like you bless the young children Lord in their Sunday school club and father everything that would be said and done in this building this morning in this day father we pray your divine blessing upon it all we thank you for it in the name of Jesus Christ amen Revelation 6 verse 7 and 8 and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see and I looked and behold a Pale Horse and his name that sat on him was death and Hell Followed With Him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword with hunger and with death and with the Beast of the earth let's sing only believe only believe only be all things are possible only believe only believe only be all things are possible only be we're starting on paragraph 240 to 306 you may be seated see the loving longsuffering of God before he passed judgment upon on her he gave her a place to repent and it's in the name of the Lord I say this he's give the Protestant Church the same thing and she won't do it [Music] messages shuck everywhere and she won't do it she go to have her own dogmas and Creeds I don't care how much you explain it as I said there in Chicago they four more ministers and are people sitting here and there they had me pinned off about the doctorine of serpent seeding all this other thing I said somebody get your Bible and come here and stand by me then nobody said nothing Tommy Hicks said I never heard that like that before brother BR I want 300 of those tapes I would send them all my Ministry there's about 50 or 75 said I'm coming down there to be re-baptized did they come not a one of them why you give them space to repent you'll cast your children to death spiritual death we pick that up tomorrow night the Lord willing or Saturday night on those plags as passes over you watch what takes place there like could give Egypt he give Egypt place to repent what was that last flag was death that's the last plag that's hit the Pentecostal church is spiritual death she's dead that's in the name of the Lord she Place rep she rejected now she's dead she'll never rise again and then people out there trying to bring in episcopalians and Priests and so forth and call them holy fathers so and so why they ought to be ashamed of themselves how blind can man get so Jesus say when that sleeping virgin come to BU or she did not get [Music] it everybody you people say I got the Holy Ghost I spoke in h but they don't want to come around a church like this oh you know I don't believe I want to go around place like that and then say you got the Holy Ghost but you want your dignified ways you want to stay in bab and still enjoy the blessings of Heaven you have to make your choice you can't stay out there in the world and serve God at the same time Jesus said you couldn't serve God in mm Hallelujah so if you won't expect if you really get save you enjoy meetings where the holy spirit is vindicating itself and showing that the word of [Music] is someone said the people make too much noise it makes me nervous you'll be nervous if you get to heaven just think all of them are there then what about it oh my how the Lord wants to get the a long suffering like it was in the days of Noah he tried hard he suffered long for 120 years to get him to repent they wouldn't do it in the days of E Egypt he sent plagues and everything else they wouldn't do it he sent John they wouldn't return He sent Jesus to Die to Save the whole group that would hear the word and now in the last days he promised again that he would send a message to call her out and restore the original Faith back to it back to the word and they won't receive it they're so dogmatic in their dogmas and Creeds tell they don't oh they think it had a if a angel walk down but God don't do that he takes something ignorant and stupid something that don't know harder your ABCs or anything and then he takes that type of a person because he can take something it's nothing and then work through it as long as something thinks or something then they can do nothing with it always did that you had become nothing to become somebody with God oh my notice yeah he gave her space to repent but she didn't do it he's done it again she won't do it her rejection a away makes her or her rejection makes the perfect way for Satan to come into her and be incarnate that's right incarnate himself right in her because she rejected the word and that's exactly the same thing that the Protestant church becomes a harlot is because she rejects the Vindicated truth of the word of God and that gives a devil face to come right in and incarnate himself and he'll make an image unto the beast when they consolida together right under now amen if I had an education I could bring it out I haven't got no education I Mis expecting the Holy Spirit to reveal it to he will to those who that's right he'll do it notice look H what she did here she rejected God's message for her to repent she started off an antichrist and that's what she was she come a false prophet an incarnate devil and what she did with her false teaching then in all of that God gave her space to repent try to get her see how longsuffering what a wonderful love there's no love like that look at those even spit in his face and things he forgave him that's God don't reject God's message look she was asked you repent go back to where she fell from and where did she fall from the word where did E fall from where did the denomination fall from word there you are no other way to right back to the word right back to the word and they get into a system that runs them back waiting the word runs them from the word instead of to the word notice look she was given the space to repent go back repent me need to go back turn back bout face repent go back and she was given a space to go back to where that now remember she was the original Pentecostal church that the Holy Ghost is poured up on on the day of Pentecost amen how many Bible students knows that see where she went from she fell from the word and accepted Dogma she instead of the Holy Ghost she want a holy name Dr LL pH Q that made him a PO sure but that's what she wanted somebody to do her praying somebody she just pay her money out and that's all she had to do now said that same thing as long as they got a Pew to set in play heavy on the collection plate that's good enough they're a member of that church you don't tell nothing else about it they don't that's her daughter now where did she fall from from the original word of the apostolic Apostles and Prophets that's where she fell from that's where the Protestant fell from repent go back turn back or it's too late it ain't already too late one of these days that lamb will lead his place and then it's all over so as her daughter's been ask now before being judged with her to return back now the last message they get is when this Prophet that I've been speaking of which I've been reading readen many books about it and I know that real good sensible spiritual thinking man knows that that's coming but the trouble of it is it keeps saying we need it it's going to be and when it comes they'll be so humble they probably miss it just like did the other time people are right about it everything say oh yes it needs to be and then let it be showed right before them and they just go right on so always done that watch now the original they they has to repent to go back there so her daughters is being asked to be forc they will be judged and thr into the same bed and kill with her they've been asked to turn back to the original word go back to the apostolic Doctrine but they're so tied down with their Creeds and things they want do it they only make fun of it then what do they do they finally form up in the image unto the Beast another power no and act to the Lamb's bride like she did in Revelations 13:14 that's what they do just persecute just the same thing the churches make just as fun of the true bride of Christ as Rome ever did just today act to the the real Lamb's bride just as like like she did in Revelations 13:14 now notice we see by God's Word of Promise he will uh he will uh killer children the denominations her daughters with spiritual death now that's Revelations 2:22 don't forget to kill is to putt to death and death is eternal separation from the presence of God think of that friends think of that won't you trust in any man-made Creeds anything is contrary to what you keep away from it now watch watch in the Bible here it said his name is hell and I mean his name is death and Hell follow that tree now hell always follows death in the natural when the natural man dies hell follows him that's the grave Hades see that in the natural but in the spiritual it's a lake of fire see all right Eternal separation where they're burn up and Malachi for that don't even lead in stubble or Branch or nothing else it's a way the world has a purifying itself again for the Millennium see have you noticed the Rider is a he and he had in his hand man false prophet but his bride is called the church she Jezebel Ahab Jezebel watch this as perfect as anything daughters is she also but never receive one man headship Protestants to that but still Harlot and principle of the doctrine that's right denomination systems that's that's what it says notice what is this all coming to now we just got about 12 14 minutes here I guess look what this is all coming to what is it it's going right back the way it did and started in heaven is coming to the End Time battle the first thing in heaven was a battle Lucifer's kicked out come to the Earth then he polluted Eden then he's been polluting ever since and now from the battle in heaven it's coming to the battle on Earth and it is to be finished at on Earth at the end time in a battle called Army geddon anyone knows that the battle started in heaven holy so they kicked them out Michael and his angels overthrow them run out when they did drop right down to Eden here start the battle down here God had his children all fortified up by his word and Eve stuck her neck out I believe you're right maybe and there it went and it's been ever since yeah then God come down and now he's got to he come down to redeem those who have come down as I said God's like a big contractor he lays out all his material on the earth and then he builds his buildings now remember before there was a grain of of seed on the earth before there was a sun that ever struck the Earth your your body was laying on the earth because you are the dust of the earth you are God's the contractor now the way he was going to do it was reach down and get like he did Adam a little bunch of calcium poish and Cosmic lightting say there's my other son then he bring up some War there's another one but what did Eve do she corrupted that way and she brought it so a sexual a then death Struck it now what's God doing he's got so many of those seeds down through there that's predestinated so much of predestinated and then at the end time he won't say Eve come bear another child you call and I'll [Music] answer that's the that last one's brought in that settles it now the battle started at Heaven it'll be finished on Earth in the form of army geddon now let's watch and see it unfold and maybe we can unfold it the Lord help us right not to do this now watch it unfold the mysterious Rider watch what he does now opposed refus to repent and to go back to the original blood word the word became blood and flesh he refused to go back to it is Antichrist the true word Bride is a he's opposed to the true worded bride takes his own bride he opposes this true bride to and he takes his own bride and brings her to him in a form of religion called Creeds and dogmas see and now seeing the holy bride he is against her but he forms his own bride called Antichrist by Antichrist teaching which is contrary to Christ see how sh is and now instead of having a unity of love controlling worship under blood he's got a denomination instead of having the word he took Creeds dogmas and so forth like in a Protestant says the Apostles Creed amen I want you to find a word of it in the Bible aost no Apostles Creed in the Bible if I said here not Longo or somewhere if the apostles had a Creed it's acts 238 all I know he ever had that's what they called everybody to do when he found what it looked like they were Christian he said have you received the Holy Ghost and that you believe said we know how word be said then how was your badti amen now being baptized in the Jesus name in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ brother that that's all right but that's not all of it yet no sir you can be baptized 50 times like that and don't do a bit of good until that heart's Changed by the Holy Spirit it all has to go together notice it's it's Christ the Antichrist refuses the true bride doctr and therefore he takes his own bride now and builds her up under a Creed of his own takes his own bride and makes her a denomination she gives birth to other denominations as quoted in this Holy Scripture gives birth to daughters and um she don't she becomes just like her mother natural worldly denomination opposing the spiritual bride the word they don't say they don't belong to church you talk to the denominational person sure I belong to church are you a Christian I belong to church that don't have one thing to do with it you don't belong to you you might belong to what's called a church okay belong to a church that's not a church that's not churches and lodges amen where people get together and people like birds of a feather but you're only one church that's and that's the mythical Body of Christ amen and you don't jarn that you're borned in it I've always said I've been to Brandon family 53 years and never did jar it I bned in it now notice it's just tight beautiful I I got the scripture WR down here but we ain't got time to get to it as Esau and Jacob now Esau was a religious man he didn't claim to be an unbeliever he believed in the same God Jacob did Same God his daddy did but he was just a Shiner excuse me expression just he was just no good he he was as far as being morally he was really a better moral acting man and Jacob was but you see he didn't think oh what's that Birthright got to do with it and he sold his Birthright to Jacob see but Jacob he didn't have big things like Esau did he didn't have the inheritance he did but there's one thing Jacob wanted was that birth right he didn't care how he had to get it he's going to get it and God had respect to him and then that's the same thing today with the natural man carnal mind worldly minded well I belong to the state church I belong to this church I belong to that that don't have one thing to do with it not a thing watch gathers them now on his mixed colored horse he's Gathering Together on his mixed colored horse because he's got political power you don't believe he has how did this President get in this now how did that ever slip up come over here for freedom of religion and you bunch of Democrats that would sell your birthrights out to politics I ain't got Democrat parties are they're both rotten I'm talking about Christianity but you sell your birth rights on a Democrat ticket and put something like that in same amen hallelujah don't you realize that this nation exactly is in a of Israel what did Israel do she come over to a Strange Land and Tuck the occupants out and killed them off and went in and possessed the land that's what we did the Indians that's the only true American there is is our Indian friends and then what did they do Israel had a few great man first thing you know they had David and they had Solomon they had great man and finally they got a renegade up there Ahab that married a jezebel an unb believer well that's the same thing we did we had a Washington and a Lincoln but look what we got now and the very thing of it is he's married and SS down and died in the wool to Jezebel he might be a pretty good s of a fell but she's going to run the business you see it right now the whole family's coming in what did the Holy Spirit tell me about 35 years ago and all you oldtimers know it seven things that happened before it and this is the last next to the last thing coming up everything else hit just exactly on the doct to the wars and everything else and now she's right in the hands of woman a rule the nation Jezebel see but remember in the days of Jezebel someone really told them their colors him on mix col hary he's Gathering his thing together mixed with Creeds denominations man-made doctrines is that right sure a mixed color the mixed color of the Dead Pale Horse of the world now that's right mixed colors of the Dead worldly form of the Pale Horse oh my no Holy Blood of the word at all [Music] in [Music] h [Music] h [Music] I [Music] [Applause] [Music]

doth wait and in his word do I hope let Israel hope in the Lord for with the Lord there is Mercy and with him is plenteous Redemption and he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities amen thank God for his word amen we' like to take a portion of scripture found in Revelations chapter 5 again we've been taking that for the last few services and I trust it's been a blessing to you it's been good to me to bring these um wonderful truths from the word of God Amen this great and tremendous event that took place as we said last Sunday we read a quote for you brother brandom said that it was the most Sublime act in the scripture and we kind of went through that a little bit more and thought of what is the greatest thing that a Christian can do an individual can do in his life is to be able to repent because the day of repentance and that hour to repent that door will close when those that will that have spurned that they will seek for that repentance and they won't be able to find it we know that that time is coming that there's a place where a man can go too far wait too long and his day of visitation he completely misses it but we're so glad that there's still Blood on the throne this morning that any wrong that you have done that I have done we can make it right today and God can receive us back into his fold of forgiveness and his loving arms and we can continue on with our Christian Journey amen and that's what we want to do in Revelations chapter 5 and verse number five and one of the elders saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David had prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I behold and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four Beast the four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps golden vows full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and H has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth let us pray Lord we ask your blessings on your word we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated title of the message this morning is instructions from the angel the instructions from the angel we'll see this great scene in Revelations chapter 5 as we just back up just a little bit and see what this great scene was here the Elder John one of the 12 disciples of our Lord he sees this great event take place there's a book and there's no one worthy to take this book and to loose the seals thereof and the Bible says that he wept much he began to weep because no one was found worthy to take the book and then uh a voice from one of the Angels says weep not John Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed and he'll take the book and he'll open it when John went to look and see what this La lion was the script says that there stood a lamb in the midst of the throne as though it had been slain so we see that this lamb and this event takes place after Calvary we see that Calvary had taken place this lamb was slain our Lord Jesus Christ we just went through Easter and now he's the only one that was worthy to take the book now we have this emblem of suffering and shame we call it the cross it's a sign of Christianity um the Catholics use it Christians use it but really the prophet Moses and Abraham didn't establish that as one of the emblems we should have in our assemblies none of the Apostles told us to put it in our churches it was a political indictment of for criminals but we use that because it is where our Lord PID the the ultimate price the Romans were in charge and he was indicted under their Rule and under their law because the Jews failed to see their day and when they didn't see their day and their coming prophecy to take place they indicted him and they nailed him to the Cross now it would have been very simple just to cut his head off or you know Pierce him in the heart and get the death over it that's not what this was for this is not for a quick sudden death This is for a painful death This is for not only a painful death it's for uh public death so that the public can come and watch you die slowly you would um uh begin to lose oxygen and they stripped you of all of your clothes and men and women and this is was a this was a public humiliation it wasn't just death sentence let's be clear of that this is was your enemies your friends your family whoever can come and watch you die slowly this is the death that our Lord he wasn't the only one that died on the cross but he's the only one that died on the cross and was buried but got back up again in fact he's the only founder of any religion that did that and that that's that's why we love him so that's why here in Revelations chapter 5 we see he's a bloody lamb meaning that that blood came from his wounds at Calvary so now John's weeping now turns into worship the elders the beasts and all those around the throne begin to sing a new song Thou Art Worthy and oh my I I think I could sing a little bit of that here this morning you had your opportunity to sing that this morning in the worship service sometimes we come to the worship service and we're still looking around trying to find out if the song leader gonna get it together or if the musicians can get on time or they didn't sing my favorite song you missed the whole purpose the whole purpose of the worship service was for the worshippers to worship the lamb that was slain you don't come to church to be seen we've made it that you don't come to church to be entertained we've made it that but we came here to meet with the king of kings and Lord of lords don't matter who's not here don't matter who else is here but I'm here to Worship the Lord Jesus Christ this is our Focus this is our purpose this is why I got up this morning this is why I got dressed to come to the house of the Lord and to worship he alone that was worthy of all of our praise some great men that come in our day great prophets Mighty Men Moses job Daniel all of the Hebrews and the prophets of oath wonderful men men I love to see on the other side but there's only one that was worthy of our worship only one that's worthy for us to bow down on our knees and give praise to and that was the lamb the Lord Jesus Christ and so we don't come just to hear a sermon we actually come to worship brother random tells us so we see this great event take place here and we played a portion for you last Sunday night out of the breach message that um where this great opening this great happening is taking place and brother randam uses the term oh what a jubilee and it's in paragraph 296 in the message to breach I'll read for you just for a moment how many remember that Sunday night he says listen what a jubilee going on when they seen that lamb come and take that book of redemption the soul screamed out we'll get it all everything the elders fell down they poured out the prayers of the Saints what there was represented a Kinsman for us they fell upon their faces they sang a song and said Thou Art Worthy for you were slain watch look at these angels and he reads the scripture there paragraph 297 what a jubilee going on in heaven when the lamb leads leaves that intercessory box to come here to possess his claims you know that got next to John he must have saw his name wrote there when them seals broke he must have got real happy listen to what he said so I want to I want our minds to go back to what a jubilee is and why we use that term Jubilee read it for you in the scripture in Exodus and Deuteronomy that the Jubilee was the time where the slaves could go free after being in bondage for seven years these are Hebrews to Hebrew relationships these are the Hebrews that were released out of Egypt they they had a they had a past so their mind battles and their memories and their scars are real these are people who were slaves for Generations uh Joshua is one of these very beautiful characters of a leader we see him in the Book of Joshua how he led and God was with him and all those that were with him the people stayed with the word with Joshua and I would think that Joshua be an easy leader to follow because Joshua had a testim where he was in slavery he came through the Exodus and he saw all of the foolishness with his cousins and brothers going back on the word rising up against and he got through all of that at kades barnea when folks lost their mind forgot why we even left Egypt and they want to go back to Egypt are you kidding me you must have never been there before this is Joshua's perspective and now here he is he was in Egypt come through the Exodus and he crosses over what a tremendous life what a TR tremendous man this was and so this these people the Hebrews God establishes these laws with them and he introduces to them this Jubilee the laws of the Jubilee we've been through it many times here and I'll keep going through it it's the word of God it's the reality of hearing the truth of the Gospel trumpet that slave when he hears that truth he recognizes that he can go free if he decides he wants to stay they would bore him in his ear we went went through it and he would have to be a slave um for the rest of his days no matter how many more jubilees would come this was a lifechanging event this was a life altering time in this life this wasn't just like a regular week day trumpet sounding this was if I hear this sound I can go free now I want you to to just take your mind back a little bit the other nations around probably could hear the Jews blowing these trumpets and doing all the stuff that they do and to the other nations out there it don't mean nothing but to those who are taught and who are the Commonwealth of Israel it meant a whole lot if your father was in bondage it meant Dad gets to come home if your parents were gone it meant that you get to see your parents again if you lost your property lost your you're gonna say Amen in a minute lost everything that you owned in the Jubilee you now can receive it back again and this is what the gospel does to a man or a woman that hears the truth of the gospel and I want to connect this gospel hearing of the word to us hearing these seals break open now I read this the quote for you in paragraph 200 in the breach where brother random says if we can get our minds and our sins far away enough to where the lamb would leave from glory to meet you as you repent of your sins he'll do that even this morning and even though you might not be able to articulate that this is Revelations chapter 5 taking place in your life you can articulate that Jesus set you free but what does it look like how does it sound well it's right here in Revelations chapter 5 we read it for you the lamb proceeds from the midst of the throne and he begins to release these seals now the prophet of God goes further and he says this here and we read it for you or we played it for you Sunday night read it for you this morning paragraph 299 talk about a jubilee talk about a time when that lamb walked forth see the book is even sealed in heaven the Mysteries are say is my name there I don't know I hope it is but if it is it was put on the book before the foundation of the world but the first thing that represented that Redemption come the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world he took the book Glory opened the book and tore off the seals and sent it down to the Earth to its seventh angel to reveal it to his people in parenthesis it says congregation greatly rejoices youall remember that they was fired up what they was they praising the Lord sound like maybe we can use some of that in our church too that's what they did on the tape and they begin to praise and there you are what happened the screams the shouts the Hallelujah the anointed the power the glory the manifestation the Bible the prophet the tape said the congregation continues to greatly Rejoice so we see that this uh book being opening and real time 1963 the prophet of God is now going to uh present the revelation of the Seven Seals as God give it to him now what's so nice about that we read it in the scripture or we heard it on the tape I read it for you just now that that lamb took the book and he gives it to who he gives it to the seventh angel is that right let's take our scriptures one more time in Revelations chapter 10 verses 1-7 quickly he said brother Israel I don't think that's I don't think that's fulfilled and and the prophet brother Brandon well you better find somebody to fulfill it because there's going to be a seventh angel and Revelations 10 vers 7 says this but in the days of The Voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of God should be finished as he declared it to his servants the prophets so we see that this coming Angel this angel that comes to reveal the Mysteries he's revealing these Mysteries that he received from the lamb because the lamb is the one that opened the book amen and we know that this was a book of redemption and that book of redemption showed that we can now go free this was the Gospel trumpet sound this was the Jubilee in the Old Testament they can hear that they can now go free in the New Testament you'll see that many of the Apostles didn't know exactly who they were in the Commonwealth of God the Peter didn't really know the apostle Saul before his name was changed he didn't know and many of us we don't even know exactly what the Lord has for us until the word of the Lord comes our way and the lord always sends an angel to reveal the truth of the word it's throughout the Bible we'll take two examples here in just a moment if the Lord will help us but he uses an angel and an angel is a messenger and the messenger has a message and this message of redemption is to you and I that can hear the gospel truth and realize that you can go free that Calvary was for you that what Jesus did at the cross was specifically for you and as the word of God begins to open up in your life you'll realize it's not just about Moses or the Hebrews or the Bible characters it's about God's relationship with you as it opens up you'll see as you get closer to the Lord this is why we should keep our Bibles handy with us at all times you know we have it on our phones where's my phone at it's back there somewhere but the phone doesn't represent your Bible this right here represents the word of God that's all it represents your phone represents all kind of other things it got Maps it got notes it's got things on there somebody can see send you something you don't like and so there's quite a difference and so handle it the way you want to but this is the only thing it represents only one thing it's not a subcategory or a source among other sources like your phone like your tablet and I use them all the time I'm not hating on the phone or the tablet but when you pick up your phone and you're looking down at it we don't know what you reading but when you have this open we know exactly what you're reading can I get a witness that's why prefer it in the in the in the in our reading I prefer it to have it handy with you because as your relationship grows with the Bible your relationship grows with the Lord you can't say l Lord have mercy upon me I want to know more about you but I don't have time to read the Bible sorry doesn't work that way the way you get closer to the Lord is by reading your Bible he is the word and his word is written for us so that we can read it so as we develop a relationship with it it's just nice to have handy have it you know clear in your view on your seat in your truck or car on your table dining room you just flip through the pages get a scripture here or there it'll always do you good do I got a witness here and sometimes we get overwhelmed I haven't read my whole Bible I haven't read 10 chapters I haven't had read I haven't read three chapters today I haven't read through my scriptures well why don't you start by reading one verse it's better than no verses and you can commit to reading just one verse and as you do that it's your relationship with the Lord is through this word so this great book this great opening of redemption opens up the mystery for our very lives here John I love this now I just have to keep myself from getting happy this morning I just might dance with the could the can the pastor dance in his own church maybe y'all won't stop me will you John as he's seeing this thing unfold you know everybody worships and then down at the end there in verse 13 and then it says then everybody heard I John and John begin to worship why is he worshiping brother Brandon brings it out he says he must have saw his name there Hallelujah so him seeing his name and the Jubilee are connected so it's not just somebody's word out there it's your word that you're reading and your name is in there it is it is what John saw and this is what we call Revelation when the Lord opens up his word to you he's opened up his word word as it pertains to you think of that it's nice to read about the Old Testament Saints it's nice to read about the New Testament Saints but we're talking about the you Testament we're talking about you in the scripture and the word of God coming alive in you it don't mean it it don't mean much until you can see your name in it and so this revelation of the word is specific it's specific to your very life not just like I said the old and the New Testament but it's the Testaments as they pertain to your life you hear the gospel it reveals to you what your rights are it tells you where you are and it tells you what freedoms you have that's what the gospel trumpet does it gives you information you think you know what your name is like Jacob but do when he wrestle with the angel the angel told him what his name was and his name wasn't Jacob no more your name is Israel I'm changing your name how you gonna change my name because I know you better than you know you and the word of God will find you because the word knows you better than you know you does that make sense you're lost until you find him and when you find him you realize that you're saved and he starts you to understand who you really are and so this this these instructions that come from the angel this is what the seventh Angel's Ministry was he gets these seals now and he releases them to the seventh angel It's composed in this little book here Pastor figuro brother Bobby's daddy gave me this book nice copy and as a gift in um I have several copies some of them are Torah but it's so nice just to go through it and read it this is what the seventh angel received from the lamb and in that it would reveal to John that his name was in there this is why John got happy this is why he said that John must have looked a past the curtain and saw John in the breach paragraph number 304 he says this here are we still together here look at this here so John's in a vision and he's writing these things that he sees he says he was so happy till he said everything in heaven he must have really cried out didn't he everything in heaven everything in Earth everything beneath the Earth every creature everything else heard me saying amen blessings Glory wisdom power might riches belongs to him amen why when the Revelation come that lamb the Redeemer our Kinsman had come back from the Throne of his mediatorial and had walked out there to take his possession talk about a Happy Time paragraph 303 when them seals broke John must have looked in and seen past the curtain of time and said there is John remember the 24 Elders who are they the 24 Elders are the 20 the 12 sons of Israel the Patriarchs and the TW Apostles which John is one of them so here's the 24 elders and John and this vision is seeing this thing break and he can count and see these Elders oh who's that it looks more to me like any of the other ones who is that that's you John oh everything can hear me praise glory and honor and wisdom and power everything in heaven on the earth and under the Earth heard I John so you see why we shout we shout because of what we see we shout because of a revelation we have we don't shout because the crowd is shouting it's okay if the crowd shouts but the reason why you are shouting in the crowd is because what God has showed you it's a revelation of who you are he shows you his will he shows you his word he tells you your freedoms and somehow or another that amen comes out of your soul amen thank you Lord Praise His Name worship the individual begins to worship as an individual but we're here as a group and we're worshiping based on what we can see in the scripture not just seeing the scripture for the sake of saying amen but it's seeing ourself in the scripture that it pertains to me that I'm the the bride of Christ that I can be set free from all of my sins that all my iniquities will be charged a away from me or taken away from me through the blood of the Lamb amen can I take 15 more minutes now this angel coming to John this angel coming to the church changes everything this is a pivotal point so when the the seals break or begin to break on John that's when the Weeping stopped that's when the crying stopped is when it broke on him what the lamb was doing what was taking place the most Sublime act in the scripture we see it it's like when that man or woman can see what Calvary has done not for the entire world not just for the bad people but what Calvary has done for you when it is when you see what Calvary means it'll break you down it'll make a grown man cry and weep at the sins that he's committed against this lovely one the Lord Jesus it'll make you repent of your sins it'll cause you great sorrow to know that you were the one who put him on the cross he was charged guilty of the crimes that you and I did he was indicted for it and when you see yourself in that transaction it's not just you know it's not enough to feel guilty or feel sorry because everyone else is crying but when you feel guilty for the sins that you've committed against him move everybody else out of it well my parents did this and my U round was this or my background was this and all of this happened to me move all of that out of the way what about the crimes that you committed against him and when you see your crimes it'll cause you to weep but then he takes he takes your weeping and he tells you it's okay I paid a price for you will you accept it and you say well what do I have to give oh you have nothing to give you there's no money you can pay for it there's no works or deeds do I have to crawl on my knees do I have to pay all of my money do I have to pay penants no none of that he took care of all of that at Calvary he paid it all Jesus Paid It All am man He Paid a Debt that he did not owe and I owed a debt that I could not pay and he paid that debt for you and I how many know what I'm talking about oh my no complaining when you think about what he's done for you no pride no bad attitudes when you think about what he's done for you so this great event this great event of redemption now coming to the hand of men and women you and I now this angel will see him show himself in different places in the scripture and when he does he changes the course of that that individual's life I'm going to take a little Bible character that we don't talk about too much and that's this little girl little lady Hagar she was um a servant to Sarah Abraham and Sarah and Hagar was an Egyptian and she has um the task of being a servant to them and Sarah could not have children so she has it in her mind it's her idea it's not Abraham's it's not a aar's idea but she has it in her mind I'll give my maid to my husband and I'll have my children through her she slightly she slightly doubted the promise Abraham doubted it too if Abraham had strong faith he would have said no we don't need to do that we don't need to help God but we're going to we're going to help God out out because I can't have children and I'm getting old and there was a promise that I'd have a son but we'll help God out how we going to help him we'll give Abraham Hagar he has Hagar and she conceives a child and as she sees that she conceives a child she now begins to despise Sarah and Sarah didn't like it but Sarah you're the one who started it and Sarah got so mad she treated her very harshly that this woman takes off and leaves she quits the job I quit and she leaves and she's out in the wilderness somewhere and the Bible says in Genesis chapter 16 that the angel found her and when the angel found her he called her by her name and he asked her the question where are you coming from and where are you going let me ask you this do you think the angel knew where she was coming from you anytime the Lord or the angel asks you a question it's not because he don't know the answer already he already knows the answer but he's asking her where are you coming from where are you going and she says well my mistress treated me so hard and I had to leave and the angel says return back to her submit yourself under her hands and we know just looking at the time it was at least 13 or maybe 15 years that she had to go back and serve under this harsh condition but the Lord instructs her through this Angel to go back so she goes back to to Sarah and he tells her return and submit to under her hands I will multiply thy seed exceedingly your son you'll call him ishmail and that means god hear it and I'm going to bless you because because the Lord has heard your cry now she cried out because of the harsh treatment but God had a purpose and a plan for her life and it was under these harsh extreme conditions you think of you know how Sarah treated this little Egyptian and you fast forward a few years how the Egyptians treated Sarah's children it all comes back around don't it for sure and she names him ishmail she submits herself at least 15 years or so at least after Isaac is weaned Sarah sees the two boys playing ishmail mocking Isaac and now kicks her out and leaves her Abraham gives her a bottle of water a little bit to eat it all Runs Out she's in the wilderness they're about to die she says I don't want to see my son die so she steps away from him and the little baby is crying and God hears that baby's cry now this little ishmail we say what you want about him we criticize them now today with all of the um the historical fighting and so forth going on but he's the Seed of Abraham and God kept him alive huh it was God that kept ishmail alive the angel of the Lord heard this baby crying this young boy crying and came down and showed her a wh and she her life was changed she saw the well she caused this boy to get married and from him preceded 12 princes and we see this great this name when the angel catches her again the second time remember the Lord had already told her she's going to have a son told her that she's going to bless her seed told her that yeah you're just a servant you're an Egyptian but I'm going to bless your seed after you now this brings a perspective to her life now where fors she was just a slave but now she's actually gonna have a very important son and now this this helps her to go back and submit herself under such harsh conditions because the a Angel has spoken to her and given her these instructions we need that today if the angel of the Lord would come and give us instructions it'll probably tell us something that would blow our mind we probably couldn't take it wouldn't believe it you you know you know you you have your capabilities like this right here but God maybe has your capabilities way out here over here and when God begins to share things with you you you always limit yourself be be the the the believer always limits itself but the scriptures and the promises of God are unlimited and to whosoever will God will take that word and multiply it in your life you see it's when the angel reveals the seals to you that you can really begin to put things together and realize who you are even today to preach this message today the angel had to reveal that and so now we can't preach a message like any other group or any other church or any kind of people we have to go by the instructions that the angel has given to us and it's a definite difference from before we heard the word to when we now hearing the word amen it's a pivot of all it's a it's a tremendous difference you know just gradually know all things no there's a revelation that God gives you there's a test there's a trial there's years of you floundering your time away years of you not capitalizing on an oldfashioned altar years of you not capitalizing of reading your Bible and praying but then when the angel comes to you it quickens those things to you and then you'll start to take these things more personal you'll start to internalize the scripture and it means more to you now than it ever meant to you before sure we need the angel of the Lord how many you know all believers have a true Angel call it a word body a theophany you get to hear from that don't you and that thing reveals things to you and I wonder if he wants to reveal something to you today I wonder what the Ang wants to reveal to you today has anything to do with what's going on out there in the world today I wonder if it has anything to do with what the economy is doing or who lied on who or who divorced who or what uh what other things going on out there I wonder if what he wants to reveal to you is laying right here in his word as he sounds that voice off to you you begin to realize who who you are in God's Great economy she went this distance away off this is several years later now and she's now coming to the time that she has to leave from um Sarah and Abraham and now the angel comes to her and says hegar what alth Thee the the the a better word for alien he says Hagar what troubles you what's your trouble Hagar and this Angel is directly involved in this lady's Life In This Girl's Life and she's an Egyptian yes she's not of the Seed of Abraham yes but she had an angel come to her she had a conversation with the angel and the angel instructed her on how she should do or what's going to take place in her life and if it's the angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord ain't going to lie to you this is is more valuable than your mom or dad talking to you this is more valuable than any other venue of news or information that we like to get caught up into interesting news or interesting information the angel coming to you is where your DNA is being revealed to you begin to tell you really what your name you think your name is Junior or senior oh that ain't your name let the angel wrestle with you and he'll show you what your name is when the angel gets through with you he'll set you on a course with h a message now now you can go clearly you have instructions now amen God heareth the lad Genesis 21:18 and he reissues the promise to Hagar and her son ishmail I like that so much we see this taking place with this great angel that comes to this gentleman Gideon we'll take this one last Bible character and then we'll let you go amen Gideon in the Bible Judges chapter 6 remember Gideon he is there they're in this situation where the Lord leaves Israel for seven years and they're in bondage for seven years under M under the midianites and the midianites and treated them very harshly he would ruin them and come through and take with they come in the scripture says like without numbers men on camels would come through and sweep through their Harvest and take over the strength of their land the increase of the earth they destroyed it took their sheep their oxes their asses and all that they worked so hard for and here is a young man by the name of Gideon and he's standing by The Wine Press hiding wheat he's hiding wheat near The Wine Press I thought the wine press is for grapes I thought the wine press is for wine why do you have wheat in the wine press well he has his wheat in the wine press because he's hiding it from the enemy I'm not gonna fight with him I'm just gonna hide from him I'm not going to confront it I'm just going to learn to work around it that's what many of us do with the troubles that alth us and the troubles that keep us down we learn how to work around them or or just live with the situation or situ or the problem but Gideon is here hiding this wheat and look at the angel of the Lord comes to him in verse um first it says that they repented Israel Cried unto the Lord and they prayed uh Judges chapter 6: 7 they cried out to the Lord because of the Affliction in verses 8 through1 the Lord sends a prophet now this Prophet comes to Israel and tell them why they've done wrong um the prophet comes and gives them a message and the message instructs them on where they had gone off and what they have done that was wrong and after this prophet sends his message then the angel of the Lord came and sat under an oak tree Judges chapter 6 verse 11 he's sitting down he looks just like a man everybody thinks he's a man no doubt he's just a regular guy sitting under the oak tree and he's watching Gideon when Gideon walks by him he said the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of Valor like we like who are you talking to you talking to me you the Lord is with thee thou might I wonder who else ever told him something like that I wonder if that's the first time he heard that let me say this to you Christians and to you Believers there are some firsttime Revelations that God wants to give you something you've never seen before that was always in your Bible always in the message and you just have to stay with the word and God will reveal to you you who you are this is the angel now calling him a mighty man of Valor in other words calling him a mighty warrior the Lord is with thee mighty warrior I'm hiding wheat from my enemy we've been in bondage for seven years and how is the Lord with me and look at Gideon's attitude and this is the attitude of a true scriptural man brother brandom says he says if the Lord Lord is with us then where are all the Miracles and why have we been forsaken like this so Gideon now asks this Angel these questions and the angel tells him to go in this thy might go in this strength and the Lord's going to deliver the midianites into your hands these questions that Gideon ask reveals what kind of man he is now I read a quote for you all last Sunday I want to read it again uh a couple Sundays ago I'll read it again for you again here in the message he carth for you 1960 paragraph 31 says there's only one way that you'll ever be able to receive this wonderful comforter is When You Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ confess your sins repent have Christian baptism ad minister to you and a promise that God will fill you with the Holy Spirit that's his promise he cannot go go back on that it's his promise I've always said if a person was thoroughly taught and was repented and from their heart had believed on God with all that was within them and when they are baptized immediately the holy spirit will come upon them because he promised to do so he promised it and I like that you know this is Gideon Gideon is saying like where is this quote in manifestation um you know you get people get baptized that's a great Point that's a great tremendous happening but what happens after you get baptized you're supposed to receive what why we don't talk about it enough why is that like you know I got baptized you know you got baptized so you can receive the Holy Ghost that's the next step that's the next stage that's what God has for you has for us any true church should be asking if God is with us where's the Sinners coming to the Lord where's the gifts of the Spirit where's the Holy Ghost falling down on our assembly where if God is with us we're all the Miracles but yet we make excuses and sometimes we shy away from this portion of the promise you repent and then you're baptized then God will fill you with the hope holy ghost that is the promise it's it's not it's not meant to make people get upset or fight over it's a promise that he made this promise is unto you and to your children and all those that are far off even as many as what the Lord Our God shall call and the day and and the day comes when our assemblies Don't Preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost then you're not preaching the message can't be you're not preaching the Holy Ghost to fill the believer just like it did in the Bible just like it did on the tapes and you're not preaching the message and a true man of God will ask that question if God is with us then where are the Miracles you know what's interesting about the Miracles brother bam was talking about when he he used to when he first went on the field he said he would tell his staff to get the hardest case get any case and before I leave from here they will be healed he said in Phoenix there's a crippled up girl he stayed on that platform for an hour and 45 minutes praying for her until the Lord healed her then it was in Burlington Vermont I believe it was that he he CLA made another claim like that and there was a boy came up that was born blind 15 years 15 years old brother says he started praying for him and it was an hour or two hours of prayer before that Spirit broke and he said what happened he says that all the others that needed prayer he missed those because he was just dealing with this one case and that night 3 o'clock in the morning the angel of the Lord came to him and revealed to him that if he relies only on the Miracles then the people will only begin to look for miracles and so he had to step back from just relying on the Miracles and what we've done we don't even pray for a miracle now but God the god that we serve is a miracle working God and if you're a young person here and you live in and and and you you go to this church or any church and you're a young person raised up in the message if your if your expectation is that you don't see any miracle Les then I did a wrong job as a pastor to you and whoever else you're listening to because those tapes you listening to full of Miracles amen I got a witness there am I talking about Divine Healing Divine Healing is part of it too but a miracle is different than just Divine Healing a miracle is uh the the the miraculous part of the gospel and if God is with us then we're the Miracles and this is what this this young man this scriptural taught man the angel comes to him now and begins to tell him that God is with him this is going to change his life he's a mighty man he don't even know it his name will be changed to jeruel he don't know it he's going to go into the city now and burn and cut down an altar and all of his Brethren are serving this God and he knew he was going to cause a harm to his family but that's what it'll do once you find out who you are when the angel comes to you and reveals to you who you are it'll change the course of your life he tells them to go in this might he asked those scriptural questions look at his scripture his questions in um Judges chapter 6 verse th 13 let's take a portion of that and then we'll let you go Judges chapter 6 Joshua Judges right Judges chapter 6 what the scripture say here and verse number 13 Gideon said unto him oh my Lord if the Lord be with us why then is all this befallen us and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of saying did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt but now the Lord has forsaken us and delivered us into the hand of the midianites so here this young man he was obviously not a part of them that came out of Egypt but he heard the testimony he heard those tapes on what took place in Egypt he heard the message of the fathers he knew who Moses was he knew who Joshua was he knew what the fathers talked about and he asked the question where be the Miracles that they talking about my dad and them was talking about you know if you if you ask those kind of questions those are scriptural questions those are questions that come from a Hungry Heart that wants to see God move in their midst move in their assembly I wish someone would ask that question here today I wish we wasn't satisfied with just coming to church and then you look at the clock and say well it's time for us to go it's time for us to leave and we'll be back back next Sunday same time same thing we have it all mapped out on what God's going to do but I wonder if we would ask a question what about the God that we heard about on the tapes huh we heard about what he did in Egypt and if God is with us and you calling me a mighty man of Valor where is this God brother bham calls him a scriptural man he goes into the script and he says where be the God so my my question is as a as a pastor where's the repentance where's the Holy Ghost where's the gifts of the Spirit hallah are they still in the Bible are they still on the tapes then they should be in your church and if they're not in your church that should be in your life like the one brother said you know I came to church and nobody ever preached on this or nobody ever talked about that like did you make every service this year maybe they preached on it when you wasn't there so we we the the answer the problem and the answer they're related you have a question and the answer they're all related and sometimes you're you're looking at the problem them is the problem when really the problem you need to it circles back and it'll catch you you think you're indicting but you're really inditing yourself so the church is supposed to be this church is supposed to be that aren't you the church you can't complain about traffic when you in it you're part of it exactly right so you you know the church and and this and and that you gotta it starts with looking at yourself in in in in the mirror and so what did Gideon do when the angel comes to him he get overwhelmed he didn't run and lose his mind he starts to ask this Angel questions and that's how you should pick your Bible up and pick this message up looking for the answer from the word and then he tests this angel now if this is really you can you wait here for a moment I want to bring you a little kid I want to bring make a little meal for you so the Bible says he goes and cuts up a a little goat he makes the little meal and he brings the broth and he brings the offering on the Rock brother Ram says it's probably two or three hours later so he leaves to go do this and now the angel is instructing him and we know the great battle that Gideon won that Gideon fought he was hiding wheat now he's leading an army to take over the midianites let me say this to you Satan don't don't know who you are he has no business telling you who you are cuz he don't know and and let's let's go a little deeper with that you don't know who you are either it's only when the word reveals to you who you are after you wrestle with the angel he'll tell you who you are and give you your instructions no I can't do this or no that's not for a resent no no no you're a mighty man of Valor Gideon now go in this strength go in this might and go take care of the midianites I wonder how many young men here today how many young sisters how many fathers and mothers who's been in the word for all these years it's still that God has more to reveal of himself to them I'm talking about 2024 I'm talking about right now I'm talking about what you used to do and what is always done has always been I'm talking about that's what Gideon had he was hiding Wheat by The Wine Press but the angel met him it says Thou Mighty Man of Valor oh why nobody ever call me that the word called you that ain't wait for nobody else to call you that the word called the word declares who you are starts all over doesn't it God makes it new to you he makes it fresh to you that Take 5 10 more minutes yes sir he makes it new he reveals it to you Satan don't know who you are you don't even know who you are it is on your knees that God reveals to you who you are and what you're supposed to be doing you think you know you have things planned out for your own life God has it planned out for you God has your life your DNA he has the instructions for your life and that's all contained that information is contained in that angel word body that was with you from the very beginning amen you got to come in contact with that it's when that angel reveals that word to you that you can now declare that you're free you know the overwhelming issue for our age in Genesis chapter 3: 17 the overwhelming indictment for our age is that they they wouldn't repent the Lord told them to repent he prays all the other ages but but in this age he tells them to buy gold dried in the fire buy white rment go purchase that tell them to anoint thy eyes with I have he that has ears to hear Let Him hear but it all starts with repent and this age in particular the people don't want to repent they don't want to say I'm sorry they'll never wrong they'll never make right properly they won't thoroughly repent they won't repent about any they didn't do anything wrong you can't say nothing to them you can't correct them about nothing you can't disagree even disagree with them and they lose they lose all credibility they can't they you know they disagree with me they they they disagree me I don't know if I can go on are you kidding me I don't know if I can make it they they don't like me get in line what everybody supposed to like you what you gonna live this life and nobody spread a rumor about you good luck everybody's supposed to like us no no no no no no don't work that way but that indictment for this age was to repent and then go buy gold tried in the fire it it's a price it takes time to thumb through your Bible to thumb through the word of God and find out who you are to wrestle with the angel how long did did Jacob wrestle with that angel huh somebody help me Sunday school how long did he W wrestle with him all night long I mean the Angel's trying to get him in the headlock and Jacob trying to get him in the headlock he trying to twist him up and trying to man maneuver he's trying to maneuver UFC at its finest this angel trying to wrestle with this man and this is the Earthly man wrestling with a Heavenly Angel and Jacob said I won't let you go until you reveal my blessing to me many of us come and we want God just to dump Revelation to dump the Holy Ghost upon dump whatever upon us and no no cry no no scrapping no fighting no wrestling at the altar doesn't come that way the Bible didn't come that way the message didn't come that way and the Holy Ghost doesn't come that way comes to a thoroughly repented heart that's how it comes amen amen and so the angel of the Lord reveals to us the angel of the Lord the messenger of the church has revealed these seals to us so we read them and we go through them little by little bit by bit we see this great Redemption taking place and this is the instructions that the angel gives gives to to the believer I Am SE myself in the scripture brother Bobby in a way like I never seen before huh and I trust each one of you are seeing yourself that way it's not just you know punching a time card we with this something very specific to our to our life and our livelihood so let's take a few places here as I close where brother random is talking about this Angel of the Lord that came to him and so we know the seventh angel taught the prophet these things that he knows and he I'm just going to I read some of these for you before I'll read these for you and then we'll then we'll go because this is what makes the difference is the Angel of the Lord revealing these things to you he instructs you the angel does and the message Be not Afraid paragraph 56 I regard you as my friends and my brothers and sisters I expect to spend eternity with you in glory if you disagree with me on my teaching that's perfectly all right but I believe if you'll search your Bible right good you'll find out it's on the mark because first the angel of the Lord come to me and taught it to me then he showed it me in the Bible where to find it I've got find the first man that came came can that can down it and that's been for years it's the truth yes sir some great theologians as I've talked to when it's finally come to a showdown we know it's right but our church would put us out if we accepted that all right if you think more of your church than you do of Christ that's up to you see but for me I stand on the word in the breach between all the denominations saying we are brothers so here's a theologian that went to school to learn and here's a seventh grade education but with an angel you see you see the difference a theologian arguing with an angel there's no there's no comparison and so the angel of the Lord taught the prophet amen paragraph number three in the message the Messiah I was speaking on that and turn them to pray for the sick the angel of the Lord came right down before them all went right over and stood in the corner there 300 or more people stood and looked at it for 15 minutes screaming crying and praising God all of them looked the first time had ever come like that before our church just come right in move right over there and stood there I said can you see it every Everybody begin screaming and falling there it was the big amber light of the pillar of fire just as perfectly round standing there then it began to shade itself and shade every one of those churches it's just exactly the way I taught them in the pillar of fire God knows us the truth here before his Bible we're living in the end time surely so brother bam is talking about the message on the church ages he draws out the each age shows that moon and the the darkness in each age how had more light in Paul's age and arenus and Luther and Martha all those age it got darker he drawed it out on his black board it's in the church age book he draw it out and then right at the end the pillar of fire comes into the room now into his Tabernacle and draws the same thing that he drew out somebody's copying somebody the angel of the Lord wrote out exactly the way the prophet drew it out so the prophet's teaching was exactly right the angel of the Lord Vindicated that and some people have a problem with talking about it in their churches that's up to them their problem right not mine the godhead explained paragraph 179 he says this here um paragraph 181 but the only what the only way that I can have faith in God is to know that the Bible is right and believe it's right stay right with it though I don't understand it I move it anyhow now but when these contradictions come up then I go before God to find out and the same angel that meets me in the meetings at night is the same one who taught me this see now see if this is how this is now so this is he's talking to the trinitarian ministers there in Chicago they set the trap for him on water baptism he baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and they believe that trinitarian baptism Father Son and Holy Ghost he asked them to take their Bible and show them where any man was baptized that way he's there explaining how God gave him these Revelations but it was the angel of the Lord that deals with him when these contradictions come up I thank God for them because they come from the lamb and from the lamb to the seventh angel to release it to his church and we have not followed cunningly devised faith Ables of men you take the messenger out of this equation you can try to interpret your Bible if you want to but first you need to get an angel to interpret it for you and many people they want to take the truth of the word and then move the prophet out of their assembly or out of their Ministry you can't do it Revelations 10:7 says that the mysteries of God would be finished as he declared to his servants the prophet so these Mysteries are revealed through the seventh angel Ministry praise the Lord 1965 paragraph number 74 he says this here I'm not degrading my Presbyterian Brethren there some of you Baptist Brethren on the way you have security I'm not saying this to be different but you didn't have it just right see that's right but I had it wrong too but when an angel stands from heaven and tells you and here is the here it is right in the scripture that's right see that's right see he always speaks exact with the scripture all right so why do we always point to people that way that's on purpose I do that deliberately you know where this word comes from I always point the people back to this message to this messenger because Timothy told us the time would come that would not endure sound Doctrine 2 Timothy 3 verse1 15 it says all scripture verse 16 all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine you got there for reproof for what you see it on the screen correction for what instructions in righteousness why that the man of God may be what somebody help me preach the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works so the word of God should directly affect your life it is personal it's not the book out there and you over here but you come one with the book as you read it you take on flesh of the word second Timothy 4 last scripture he says Paul telling Timothy verse number two preach the word be instant in season and out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they who is they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itchy ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth we've seen that taking place over the years we just seen that taking place the last five to seven years here we see they turn their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables but watch thou in all things endure afflictions through the work of the Evangelist make full proof of thy Ministry amen I fought a good fight I finished my course I've kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day not to me only but but unto all them also that what love his appearing so the Commandment is to preach the word stay with the truth endure stay with sound Doctrine for the time will come that they will not endure sound they won't endure it they won't take it it's all kind of foolishness on the TV different churches those assemblance of the word and even Believers won't even question and ask where the Miracles are where's the where's the god of Elijah where's the power of God is the Holy Ghost still pouring out it's the Holy Ghost for our children and our children's children it is the same yes it is the same Holy Ghost it's the same work and God does not change his work is still the same you come on those those grounds God will fill you with the Holy Ghost if it's just one of you if it's just one person God's going to keep his word he'll bankrupt heaven to make that word come alive and let me say this here you'll only know who you are as the word of the Lord is revealed to you as you develop that relationship with his word it begins to reveal to you who you are and what your place is so God bless you we pray that the Lord will let his Angel wrestle with you a little bit give to you the things that you need in your life God bless you let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your word today we thank you Lord that it's sound Doctrine it's solid for for us Lord It's food for our soul I pray Lord Jesus that we will accept it and not Harden our hearts Lord that you would pardon our
