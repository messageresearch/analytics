[35:28] feasted on that on my way home from TU
[35:30] from Phoenix this morning and uh uh
[35:34] thank you that'll be all uh your
[35:37] musicians and so we just to give you a
[35:40] quick report of what happened in Warz
[35:42] because we were there last Sunday
[35:45] morning and we got tied up and I
[35:47] couldn't make it for the Sunday night
[35:48] service and so we had this trip in Hot
[35:52] Springs kind of pre-planned and I don't
[35:55] like to be gone on the Sunday morning
[35:57] but when I got stuck at the border like
[35:59] that in the time um it made it to where
[36:02] I was uh going to Sundays like that but
[36:06] um I'm glad to be back home glad to be
[36:09] back in the house of the Lord with my
[36:12] friends the Saints of the most high God
[36:14] I know when you don't say amen I know
[36:16] why so when you're visiting you don't
[36:19] always know but um we appreciate each of
[36:23] you and we appreciate the opportunity uh
[36:26] to come and minister the word always but
[36:29] it's something about visiting uh the
[36:32] church you get on that Evangelistic type
[36:34] of service it revives you you see fresh
[36:38] faces and new faces and it does
[36:40] something for you and it actually helps
[36:43] me to come back and be um more motivated
[36:47] I think it seems so this trip in Warz
[36:50] was just such a blessing to me um the
[36:53] with brother Robert figuro we went down
[36:55] there and this brother pastor Tito um a
[37:00] young man he's a school teacher there
[37:02] and he's really doing a a great work
[37:04] trying to keep the Saints together there
[37:06] and they we had three baptisms there was
[37:10] a couple that and this church is only he
[37:13] said 30 to 35 people including children
[37:17] but there was maybe
[37:19] 250 or 300 that came from all over and
[37:23] he put that together and he fed the
[37:25] people and his people
[37:28] gave up their rooms and beds and they
[37:30] slept on the floor to host everyone and
[37:33] it's just a a real sacrifice but the
[37:36] fruits of it we saw three baptisms and
[37:39] one of them was the pastor's uh younger
[37:42] sister it shocked him he he knew of one
[37:45] baptism and then another man was invited
[37:47] to come to church and he got baptized
[37:50] and that was a shocking he said is there
[37:52] anyone else and his little sister got up
[37:54] and it just it broke his heart to see
[37:56] that and it broke my heart too it was so
[38:00] I was so good to see her she's 18 or 19
[38:02] years old just a young lady and so so
[38:06] nice to see that there was a a couple
[38:10] that had been uh living together like
[38:13] husband and wife but they weren't
[38:14] married for 22 or 24 years or something
[38:18] like that and then they came in contact
[38:20] with the message and they wanted to get
[38:22] their life straightened out and so at
[38:25] the end of one of the services they
[38:30] um she decided to have her wedding so
[38:33] there was a king Setta on the Friday
[38:36] night or Saturday night and then the
[38:39] wedding and uh so we got the full
[38:41] experience I got lost we got lost in
[38:44] wared and wared think of that and he the
[38:48] Pastor said you know the people they
[38:50] don't like to come and see him there
[38:52] because they're afraid of the
[38:54] bullets and so he's kind of teasing
[38:56] which it's a very vient City but the
[38:59] word of the Lord is going forward and I
[39:01] was so encouraged to see that and um I
[39:03] thank the Lord for that and we had a

[41:37] spirit of
[41:38] God they are the sons of God for we have
[41:43] not received the spirit of bondage again
[41:46] to fear but you have received the spirit
[41:49] of adoption whereby we cry ABA
[41:54] father the spirit itself beareth Witness
[41:59] with our spirit that we are children of
[42:02] God and if children then H HS of God and
[42:07] Joint HS with Christ if so be that we
[42:10] suffer with him that we may be also
[42:13] glorified together amen let's take one
[42:17] more scripture in Revelations chapter
[42:21] 5 verse number
[42:26] one and I saw in the right hand of him
[42:29] that sat on the throne a book written
[42:33] within okay and on the backside sealed
[42:36] with Seven Seals and I saw a strong
[42:39] angel proclaiming with a loud voice who
[42:42] is worthy to open the book and to loose
[42:45] the seals thereof and no man in Heaven
[42:48] Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was
[42:51] able to open the book neither to look
[42:53] thereon and I wept much because no man
[42:57] was found worthy to open and to read the
[43:00] book neither to look thereon Amen Let
[43:05] take a little uh title this evening the
[43:07] open book of redemption it's the title
[43:10] The open book of redemption this morning
[43:13] it'll be similar as I I spoke to them on
[43:16] some of these very things and i' like to
[43:19] go a little bit further and we trust the
[43:21] Lord will bless you let us pray Father
[43:23] in heaven we ask your blessings upon
[43:25] your word tonight bless every heart We
[43:29] Gather in Your Name Lord we are looking
[43:32] And depending on you Lord to speak to
[43:34] our hearts without you we can do nothing
[43:37] we have nothing to offer except your
[43:40] word that you've given to us and as we
[43:43] heard this morning we can only see what
[43:45] you show us if you show it to us Lord
[43:49] Lord we want to be faithful to react and
[43:52] respond to what you show us and Lord we
[43:55] want to be respectful and diligent
[43:58] open our eyes and our hearts to hear
[44:00] your word tonight speak we pray and we
[44:03] ask in Jesus name amen God bless you you
[44:07] may be seated the open book of
[44:10] redemption now this book of
[44:14] redemption that John saw and brother bam
[44:17] tells us that the book of redemption he
[44:20] also calls it the book of life and in
[44:22] the Book of Life there is seemingly two
[44:26] parts The Book of Life and then the
[44:28] Lamb's Book of Life and they look like
[44:31] two books and it looks like one book
[44:34] it's really one book and here's what
[44:37] brother random says about this book of
[44:39] redemption I'll just get right into it
[44:42] in paragraph number 31 of the first seal
[44:46] he says John turning he saw a lamb
[44:49] coming out it must have been bloody cut
[44:52] and wounded it had been
[44:55] slain said it it a lamb that had been
[44:58] slain and of course it was still bloody
[45:01] if you had cut if you had cut a lamb and
[45:04] killed it the way the lamb was anyhow it
[45:07] was hacked to pieces on a cross Spears
[45:10] in the side Nails in the hands and feet
[45:13] and Thorns over the brow he was in an
[45:17] awful condition and this lamb come forth
[45:20] and went over to him that sat upon the
[45:22] throne that held the complete title deed
[45:26] of redemption yes yes and the lamb goes
[45:29] and takes the book out of the hand of
[45:32] him that sat upon the throne took and
[45:36] opened the seals and opened the book you
[45:41] see the book actually was planned and
[45:44] written before the foundation of the
[45:47] world this book The Bible was really
[45:51] written before the foundation of the
[45:55] world and Christ being the lamb was
[45:58] slain before the foundation of the world
[46:01] and the members of his bride their names
[46:04] were put in the Lamb's Book of Life
[46:07] before the foundation of the world but
[46:09] it's been sealed up and now it's being
[46:12] revealed whose names were in there all
[46:16] about it what a great thing and John
[46:19] when he saw it he said everything in
[46:22] heaven everything underneath the Earth
[46:24] everything heard him saying amen and
[46:27] blessings and honor he just really was
[46:29] having a great time for the lamb was
[46:34] worthy isn't that nice to know that this
[46:37] book The Bible was written before it
[46:41] came here on the earth It Was Written in
[46:44] heaven and your names were written in
[46:46] that book in heaven before you got here
[46:49] or the book got here yes sir heavens and
[46:52] earth will pass away but my word will
[46:55] never pass away it's the only thing
[46:57] stable it's The Only Thing Worth
[46:59] preaching about it's The Only Thing
[47:01] Worth founding a church upon or Ministry
[47:05] or marriage or a relationship is upon
[47:07] the word of God Amen praise His name
[47:11] paragraph 308 in the message um The
[47:14] Invisible Union that was the first deal
[47:17] this is the invisible Union of the bride
[47:19] of Christ he says there is your name on
[47:21] The Book of Life The Book of Life is the
[47:24] word of God because the word is God and
[47:28] God is the only thing that is life so
[47:31] your name was represented in the Bible
[47:34] before the Bible become on word yes sir
[47:39] mm we might dance tonight all right come
[47:42] on this might be one of those services
[47:45] that somebody might dance and if you
[47:47] dance I ain't going to stop you all
[47:49] right okay don't stop them now if they
[47:52] take off let them
[47:54] go your name was represented in the book
[47:57] this is The Only Thing Worth dancing
[47:59] about by the
[48:00] way your name was represented in the
[48:03] Bible before the Bible become on word
[48:06] and and if you're here to do that won't
[48:08] it vindicate that word won't the church
[48:12] vindicate itself won't Malachi 4 and all
[48:16] these other things perfectly perfectly
[48:19] vindicate itself and show that that's
[48:22] what it
[48:23] is works as Faith Express brother
[48:26] brandom says this talking about this
[48:28] book of life and the Lamb's Book of Life
[48:31] the Baptists believe there's two
[48:32] separate
[48:33] books paragraph 120 and works is Faith
[48:37] Express the Baptist believe it's two
[48:40] separate books and in one way it is two
[48:43] separate books and in another way it
[48:45] isn't two separate books I'm two
[48:48] separate people I'm a Body and Soul and
[48:51] Spirit three separate people but I only
[48:54] one only one makes me as a being there's
[48:58] only real there's only real one book of
[49:03] life like there was a germ of wheat that
[49:07] come through the stock and um brother
[49:10] mam continues on and that's the one
[49:13] place sounds like you can have your name
[49:14] taken off the Lamb's Book of Life the
[49:16] other place you can't do it so there's
[49:18] where it is it's all in the great
[49:20] Revelation there which was made known
[49:24] during the time of the Seven Seals so
[49:27] your Bible this book the Bible is the
[49:30] book of redemption it's the book of life
[49:33] and your name was written in there all
[49:36] of creation was lost when this book had
[49:41] was lost by Adam now brother bam shows
[49:45] us that Adam had Dominion this is his in
[49:49] the beginning Adam when he sinned he
[49:52] lost the Dominion and he lost the
[49:54] authority that was given to him
[49:57] and brother random says this here this
[49:59] is what happens when he lost the book so
[50:02] it looks like it goes into two or three
[50:05] different hands before it gets back into
[50:07] its right rightful place and look at how
[50:09] brother brandom says this in the breach
[50:12] between uh the seven Church ages and the
[50:15] Seven Seals this is the breach paragraph
[50:18] 99 now when Adam sinned by heeding with
[50:23] by heeding his wife's reasoning instead
[50:27] of holding to God's word that's what
[50:29] made Adam sin his wife reasoned with
[50:33] Satan and then produced the product to
[50:36] Adam and Adam turned loose the word and
[50:39] sold out he lost all his inheritance
[50:43] when he lost his fellowship and right to
[50:46] life remember the day you eat thereof
[50:48] the day you die when he lost his life he
[50:52] also lost his inheritance in life
[50:56] because he had completely Supreme
[50:59] control of the earth he was a god of the
[51:03] earth God is the god of the universe
[51:07] everywhere but his son had the Earth
[51:09] under his own control he could speak he
[51:13] could name he could say he could stop
[51:16] nature he can do anything he wanted to
[51:19] see but when he did that he lost his
[51:23] inheritance I want you to notice how
[51:25] beautiful this Revelation is to us who
[51:28] follow this message I don't know how
[51:29] many churches know these things but they
[51:32] were revealed to us under the opening of
[51:34] The Seven Seals what the book of
[51:37] redemption was what did Adam
[51:40] lose and now it is being redeemed back
[51:44] so brother mam says you can speak
[51:46] paragraph 101 now Adam could say let
[51:48] this mountain here be moved over there
[51:51] and it would do it Adam could say let
[51:53] this tree here be plucked up and planted
[51:56] over here it would do it see for he had
[52:00] complete Supreme control as a minor God
[52:03] under God our father because he was a
[52:06] Son of God now couldn't we stop here
[52:09] just a minute and get a real sermon yes
[52:13] we could actually oh then if the blood
[52:17] has cleansed it back what about
[52:20] now see look what the Son of God the
[52:23] second Adam did see said the works that
[52:26] I do shall you also see and Adam lost
[52:28] his inheritance the earth now it passed
[52:31] from his hands to the one he sold out to
[52:35] Satan he sold his faith in God to
[52:38] Satan's reasoning therefore his eternal
[52:41] life his right to the Tree of Life his
[52:44] right to the Earth belonged to him he
[52:47] forfeited every bit to the hands of
[52:50] Satan he passed it from his hand to
[52:53] Satan therefore now it has been
[52:57] returned and has been polluted and the
[52:59] seed of Adam has destroyed the
[53:01] inheritance that Adam should have had
[53:04] that's the Earth that's right see the
[53:07] seed of Adam so what happens to the book
[53:10] of redemption it leaves from Adam's hand
[53:13] that control and it was the
[53:16] authority of the spoken word he had the
[53:20] authority to move things by the word
[53:23] because the spoken word is the Original
[53:25] Seed he would move that tree he would
[53:28] plant and he would do and he controlled
[53:30] the the the migration of the fishes and
[53:33] the birds he controlled everything all
[53:35] of Nature and everything that was named
[53:38] was named by Adam very bright mind yes
[53:42] very intelligent being to be able to
[53:45] name all of the species in their
[53:48] categories and give them names and know
[53:51] it without a Facebook without a Google
[53:54] iPad or whatever right right yes just
[53:56] the this we talking about an original
[53:58] man now we're talking about where we
[54:00] came from and now you got to have
[54:04] something that you're aiming at or
[54:06] you're going to miss whatever you're
[54:08] shooting if you don't know what you're
[54:09] aiming at as Believers our aim is
[54:13] complete and total
[54:15] Redemption back to what God originally
[54:19] had in his mind for a man amen amen so
[54:23] here's Adam he loses all of of this and
[54:27] he compromises through the fall through
[54:31] the the fruit of the woman through Satan
[54:35] he loses everything and he's stripped
[54:38] and so not only is the book of
[54:40] redemption the book of life it's the
[54:43] book of your life and your life won't
[54:46] make any sense until this book is opened
[54:48] up to you and you'll run circles and
[54:51] you'll try to do this you try to make
[54:53] this happen life has no meaning until
[54:56] this begins to open up to you you can't
[55:00] understand suffering you can't
[55:02] understand what is joy and peace if this
[55:04] isn't open up to you it's the book of
[55:07] life and it's the book of your life if
[55:11] you're a Believer and God wants this
[55:13] book open up to us so we know that the
[55:16] Bible is the book of life and it had to
[55:19] be open now so we see that Adam loses
[55:25] the book
[55:27] it falls into the dirty hands of Satan
[55:30] and this is why um suffering exists the
[55:33] way it does today now brother random
[55:38] goes further in The Sixth Seal and says
[55:44] this in paragraph
[55:47] 126 compare scriptures of this great
[55:50] event that we will see that this great
[55:53] secret or mystery that was under the six
[55:55] seal of the book of redemption now
[55:57] remember these are hidden mysteries and
[56:00] the six seals all together is one great
[56:04] big book just six Scrolls rolled
[56:06] together and it unwinds the whole book
[56:09] of redemption that's how the whole earth
[56:12] was redeemed that's the reason John wept
[56:15] because no one could get that book all
[56:19] of creation everything was gone she
[56:21] would just simply turn back to atoms
[56:24] molecules and so forth Cosmic and not
[56:27] even uh be creation person nothing else
[56:31] cuz Adam lost the rights of that book he
[56:34] forfeited it when he listened to his
[56:36] wife and she listened to Satan's
[56:38] reasoning instead of the word of God see
[56:41] it was
[56:42] forfeited then it couldn't go back into
[56:45] the dirty hands of Satan who tempted her
[56:48] out of the way so therefore went back to
[56:51] its original owner like any abstract
[56:54] deed would do see goes right back to its
[56:58] original owner and that was God the
[57:01] Creator who made it and he holds it and
[57:05] there's a price and that's Redemption
[57:08] there is some price for Redemption there
[57:10] was nobody could do it so he said he
[57:13] made laws his own laws of a kinsman
[57:15] redeemer then they could find nobody
[57:19] every man was born of sex born after
[57:21] sexual desire he was in the original sin
[57:25] Satan and Eve so he could not do it
[57:28] there's nothing in him no holy Pope
[57:31] priest doctor of divinity whoever he
[57:34] might be he would nobody worthy and he
[57:37] couldn't be an angel because it had to
[57:38] be a Kinsman it had to be a
[57:43] man then God himself become a Kinsman by
[57:47] taking on human flesh through the Virgin
[57:49] birth and he shed his blood that wasn't
[57:53] the blood of a Jew it wasn't the blood
[57:55] of a g
[57:57] was the blood of God see the Bible said
[58:00] we're saved through the blood of God
[58:02] Amen that's right so we see how this
[58:04] book moved now it was in Adam's hand and
[58:07] then Adam sinned and he loses the book
[58:10] he loses all the rights of an original
[58:13] man then Satan gets his dirty hands on
[58:17] it and in portion he still has control
[58:20] of all the governments that rule the
[58:22] Earth he still does but the title deed
[58:26] of redemption goes back into the hands
[58:28] of God now and now God has to pay a
[58:32] price to get that book back into the
[58:35] hands of man again praise the Lord
[58:38] because it belongs to man right and
[58:42] whatever God gives you if you lose it
[58:45] you need to claim that promise give it
[58:48] back to me it belongs to me we're not
[58:51] asking for something that don't belong
[58:53] to us when we claim healing that belongs
[58:57] to us we claim salvation the Holy Ghost
[59:00] our family Peace of Mind joy in the
[59:04] spirit that belongs to us we're not
[59:07] asking for something that don't belong
[59:08] to us we're asking for a promise that
[59:10] God is already given to us praise the
[59:14] Lord
[59:16] amen so it goes further after Redemption
[59:21] now the blood was shed for the book to
[59:24] come back to the Earth now Jesus robes
[59:28] himself God robes himself in flesh in
[59:31] the body of the Lord Jesus Christ pays
[59:33] the price for
[59:35] Redemption a virgin birth he was a man
[59:38] he was not an angel he was a man a
[59:40] kinsman redeemer he pays the price now
[59:43] the book is Back available to man now
[59:47] now this is a beautiful thing all right
[59:49] can I go a little bit
[59:51] further this is a beautiful thing
[59:53] because now we can see the book
[59:58] developing a place of
[1:00:01] rest it's going to find a resting
[1:00:04] place the book was predestinated in
[1:00:07] heaven and when it tried to come on the
[1:00:10] earth many times they try to burn it
[1:00:12] they try to stop it they try to kill it
[1:00:14] but it came
[1:00:16] anyways and every time that book hit a
[1:00:19] community it was a GameChanger for the
[1:00:23] community in the Reformation the
[1:00:26] Reformation didn't preach the Holy Ghost
[1:00:28] it didn't bring us back to an adoption
[1:00:31] but what the Reformation did it put the
[1:00:34] Bible back into the hands of the
[1:00:37] ordinary man cuz that's where it
[1:00:39] belonged and when we can get it back
[1:00:42] into the man's hands God can do the rest
[1:00:46] God can begin to work through those men
[1:00:49] through those communities through those
[1:00:51] families and that's what he did in the
[1:00:53] Reformation amen so as a Son of God or
[1:00:58] son of Adam our desire should be to come
[1:01:02] into maturity this full maturity or the
[1:01:05] stature of a perfect man now look at the
[1:01:08] book now brother randam says in the
[1:01:11] third seal he says this about the book
[1:01:13] paragraph
[1:01:16] 40 he said he he's worthy to take the
[1:01:19] book of redemption now it doesn't belong
[1:01:21] back to the judge anymore it belongs to
[1:01:24] the Redeemer and he has done done the
[1:01:27] work of redemption now he's going to
[1:01:30] show the church what he done amen see
[1:01:34] then he just takes but the book is
[1:01:37] closed no one know it at all they know
[1:01:40] it was a book of Redemption on there but
[1:01:43] it's to be it was to be revealed in the
[1:01:45] last days according to Revelations 10
[1:01:48] yes the seventh angel is going to be
[1:01:51] given the message of that because it
[1:01:55] said that in the time of the sounding of
[1:01:57] the seventh a age the seventh angel when
[1:02:00] he sounds all the mysteries of God
[1:02:03] should be finished up by his sounding
[1:02:07] then after it's revealed the angel come
[1:02:10] down from heaven which was Christ now
[1:02:13] remember this Angel is on earth a
[1:02:17] messenger okay so
[1:02:22] now we can see now that the book of
[1:02:24] redemption we can see now that the book
[1:02:27] of redemption is now in the hands of the
[1:02:30] seventh Angels Ministry that belongs to
[1:02:34] him am I love that what brother George
[1:02:36] said this morning but that that that
[1:02:39] that that that Revelation is committed
[1:02:41] to only one for each age and for this
[1:02:45] last age it's a complete
[1:02:49] full picture of what a redeemed man
[1:02:52] looks like now they asked brother
[1:02:55] brandham this question just to show you
[1:02:58] that even them back in those those ages
[1:03:01] of the Tabernacle and we kind of think
[1:03:03] that they was they didn't have the
[1:03:05] Revelation that we have but look at this
[1:03:07] question
[1:03:09] here look at this question here that
[1:03:12] they asked the
[1:03:13] prophet
[1:03:18] okay don't tell me I didn't bring
[1:03:21] it
[1:03:24] shees
[1:03:26] all
[1:03:27] right it was a question that they asked
[1:03:30] brother
[1:03:31] brandham talking about this
[1:03:35] restoration and he's it was a question
[1:03:39] they asked I have it it's in there I
[1:03:40] won't take time but they asked brother
[1:03:42] bandam the question it seems quite
[1:03:45] possible with this ministry of the third
[1:03:48] pole that a redeemed son can be made
[1:03:53] back fully redeemed again you see
[1:03:56] somebody's interested in that not
[1:03:58] everybody not everybody but it's a you
[1:04:01] have that quote brother George somebody
[1:04:04] got almost got it it seems quite
[1:04:06] possible and it says and stand before
[1:04:09] the son of man so they ask brother ROM
[1:04:12] this question it seems quite possible
[1:04:14] with this ministry of the third pool the
[1:04:17] spoken word that you could speak the
[1:04:22] word and make a son a redeemed son son
[1:04:26] again back like Adam praise the Lord
[1:04:30] thank you my
[1:04:34] brother that's how you know you got
[1:04:36] friends is when they hand you the
[1:04:39] word if they ain't handing you the word
[1:04:42] then leave them alone paragraph 248 this
[1:04:45] is in the questions and answers thank
[1:04:48] you brother George thank you so much
[1:04:50] this third pool and is speaking the word
[1:04:54] it seems in entirely possible for you to
[1:04:58] speak the word and one would be
[1:05:00] completely and fully
[1:05:03] restored placed entirely ready for the
[1:05:07] Rapture in the Resurrection the son of
[1:05:10] man this is so or is it not question
[1:05:17] mark and you would do this if properly
[1:05:20] pressed upon so they're asking brother
[1:05:23] brandom you got the third pool you you
[1:05:25] been talking talking about it you've
[1:05:27] been preaching it to us it seems
[1:05:29] possible that you can take that third
[1:05:31] pool and speak a man back to be restored
[1:05:36] again you ain't going to ask Billy
[1:05:38] Graham that you ain't going to ask the
[1:05:41] Reverend Oral Roberts that there's no
[1:05:44] other Ministry you would ask that there
[1:05:47] had to be something evident that it
[1:05:50] would even ask enter my mind to ask this
[1:05:53] brother could you speak the word
[1:05:56] and restore me praise the Lord M so now
[1:06:02] we see let's get into the answer just a
[1:06:04] little
[1:06:08] bit did just tell me what it is my face
[1:06:13] all right face IA okay thank you all
[1:06:16] right my face didn't work all right so
[1:06:20] let me let me read this quote we have a
[1:06:23] little fun God bless you don't all right
[1:06:25] so
[1:06:27] Place entirely ready for the Rapture and
[1:06:29] the resurrection the son of man this is
[1:06:31] so or is it not and you would do this if
[1:06:34] properly pressed upon would you not
[1:06:37] Escape all these things it's got a ditto
[1:06:40] there Escape all these things and stand
[1:06:42] before the son of man Luke 21:36 now my
[1:06:46] dear friend we're going to say what the
[1:06:49] tape say
[1:06:50] now now I think here that you you you
[1:06:54] got a good statement
[1:06:58] yes sir yes sir amen now that would be
[1:07:01] so you said brother brandom in other
[1:07:04] words here I don't think it's I I
[1:07:07] believe I'm not polishing up what you
[1:07:08] said but I believe I can make it a
[1:07:10] little clearer to people see you're
[1:07:12] believing because of the spoken words
[1:07:15] and things like that that he said about
[1:07:18] and all of you hear witness the
[1:07:21] squirrels and all these other things
[1:07:23] that's been done but did did you notice
[1:07:26] that was sovereignly given I never asked
[1:07:29] him Lord let me do this speak these
[1:07:31] things and like that do these things
[1:07:33] there I never asked him he by his own
[1:07:36] Divine will came to me and said you go
[1:07:39] do this see I wasn't asking one thing
[1:07:41] about it Moses never asked to go down
[1:07:44] into Egypt but God but was God that sent
[1:07:47] him down to Egypt see now I believe that
[1:07:50] the Holy Spirit would come to me and say
[1:07:52] in a vision go tell a certain certain
[1:07:55] person that they are not they're trying
[1:07:57] to overcome a certain thing they cannot
[1:07:59] do it they're smoking they're drinking
[1:08:02] they're lying stealing or committing
[1:08:03] adultery whatever it might be they got a
[1:08:06] lustful spirit and you just go where
[1:08:09] they are and say thou Spirit come out of
[1:08:11] there I set this captive free would it
[1:08:13] take place
[1:08:15] absolutely yes indeed that absolutely
[1:08:19] would I take place but now upon
[1:08:22] presuming and brother mam goes on so
[1:08:25] isn't that uh beautiful questions come
[1:08:28] from
[1:08:29] somewhere questions come from somewhere
[1:08:32] somebody was thinking about that and if
[1:08:35] they didn't think about it maybe you
[1:08:36] would have thought about
[1:08:38] it see because that is our heart's
[1:08:40] desire to get back to our original
[1:08:45] position
[1:08:47] again let me just share a quick
[1:08:49] testimony on Israel in the land of
[1:08:51] Israel when we were there um our guide
[1:08:54] told us this that when Israel the the
[1:08:57] people of the Jews started to come back
[1:08:59] into the Homeland after the war
[1:09:02] that the climate changed and they
[1:09:06] started receiving more
[1:09:09] rain and the land became more fertile
[1:09:12] why because these people had found their
[1:09:15] place amen and when you find your place
[1:09:18] that's when the blessings begin to Flow
[1:09:21] It's
[1:09:22] Supernatural it's all about putting God
[1:09:24] first you put him first he'll take care
[1:09:28] of the desires of your heart he already
[1:09:31] knows what you want and desire but if
[1:09:33] you delight yourself in me I will give
[1:09:37] you the desires of your heart that's
[1:09:40] when you find your place and you get
[1:09:42] yourself in track with the word of God
[1:09:45] and this book of life and then things
[1:09:47] will fall in order now just to save a
[1:09:52] little bit of time so we see this book
[1:09:54] now is in the ministry of the seventh
[1:09:58] Angels Ministry I'll take a little bit
[1:10:00] in the first seal paragraph number
[1:10:03] 205 the revelations 10 said his message
[1:10:05] was to
[1:10:07] reveal not reform reveal the secrets
[1:10:11] reveals Secrets it's the word in the man
[1:10:15] Hebrews 4 said that the word of God is
[1:10:18] sharper than a twoed sword piercing even
[1:10:21] to a suer of the bone and a revealer of
[1:10:23] the secrets of the heart see
[1:10:25] this man is not a reformer he's talking
[1:10:28] about the seventh angel now this man is
[1:10:30] not a reformer he's a
[1:10:32] revealer a revealer of what the
[1:10:35] mysteries of God where the churches has
[1:10:39] got it all tied up in everything he's to
[1:10:40] come forth with the word of God and
[1:10:44] reveal the thing out because he's to
[1:10:48] restore the faith of the children back
[1:10:51] to the Father the original Bible faith
[1:10:56] is to be restored by the seventh
[1:11:00] angel praise the Lord so this book of
[1:11:03] redemption The Book of Life the Lamb's
[1:11:06] Book of Life is now being opened and
[1:11:08] revealed by the seventh angel
[1:11:11] Revelations 10:7 amen
[1:11:14] now how are you related to that
[1:11:19] angel aren't you so
[1:11:22] glad that the message found you
[1:11:29] most of us here wasn't in the brandom
[1:11:31] Tabernacle to hear the precious words
[1:11:34] proceed or to even Shake our dear
[1:11:36] brother the Reverend bram's hand most of
[1:11:40] us were not a part of the first second
[1:11:42] or even the tape making Ministry but the
[1:11:45] tape fell in our
[1:11:47] hands and the
[1:11:49] tape fell in our hands on purpose yes
[1:11:53] sir amen that was not an
[1:11:57] accident it was like it was guided it
[1:11:59] followed you it found you on your job in
[1:12:04] the hood wherever you were that tape
[1:12:07] found you because you're identified with
[1:12:11] that word it's the only thing that makes
[1:12:14] sense when it contacts you the questions
[1:12:17] of Life begin to be answered the
[1:12:20] questions of your
[1:12:22] life not just the Book of Life or random
[1:12:25] Life the book of my
[1:12:27] life being open and revealed Lord
[1:12:31] so what does this mean this means that
[1:12:36] God
[1:12:38] wanted another Adam on the Earth again a
[1:12:41] redeemed son to come to
[1:12:44] maturity you know what's interesting is
[1:12:46] that many today and this might scratch a
[1:12:49] little bit many today many Ministries
[1:12:51] today they don't have no problem with
[1:12:54] this quote I'm going to read you right
[1:12:55] now that you become the
[1:12:59] word as you receive the
[1:13:01] word that the
[1:13:05] bride is the word made
[1:13:09] flesh because that speaks of what we
[1:13:12] should be maturing to yes right but how
[1:13:16] can we say that right and but we don't
[1:13:19] have a real example of what an Adam
[1:13:22] looks
[1:13:23] like what does a redeem man look
[1:13:26] like in real time what what kind what
[1:13:29] what was his stature what does that
[1:13:31] Ministry look like in flesh that's what
[1:13:33] it is right here
[1:13:36] good I'm not ashamed to say that the
[1:13:39] word made
[1:13:41] flesh in our
[1:13:43] day coming back to a Son of God that had
[1:13:50] the authority that Adam had that can
[1:13:53] speak to Creation that can create from
[1:13:56] out of nowhere that had the power given
[1:14:00] to him by almighty God to represent that
[1:14:04] the blood at Calvary still
[1:14:07] works now we have it at Calvary we had
[1:14:10] it Through the Ages but here we have a
[1:14:12] man with the
[1:14:15] authority don't be afraid of that
[1:14:17] because you got to come into that too
[1:14:19] all right amen we should be coming to
[1:14:22] maturity all of us
[1:14:25] now I I can't I can't determine how fast
[1:14:30] you're going to
[1:14:32] mature that's not my
[1:14:34] job and and you can't and you can't
[1:14:37] determine how fast I'm a
[1:14:39] mature and and it's like brother random
[1:14:41] says if I can't do it if I can't have
[1:14:44] faith for something I'm not going to
[1:14:46] stand in the way of a man that
[1:14:48] does so we we we shouldn't apologize for
[1:14:52] the things that the Lord shows us right
[1:14:55] if the Lord is bringing us to maturity
[1:14:58] just grow up amen into that maturity
[1:15:02] right and we're not waiting for
[1:15:03] everybody else for us all to mature
[1:15:05] together you got to pick up your book
[1:15:07] your Bible and let that open up to you
[1:15:11] and that becomes a revelation to you the
[1:15:13] book begins to open up to you so let's
[1:15:16] take a few quotes and I got 15 minutes
[1:15:18] all right here what he says in this
[1:15:22] message the word is again falling part
[1:15:26] paragraph
[1:15:28] 146 Church of the Living God that bride
[1:15:31] moves right on just the same and she'll
[1:15:34] go in the Rapture by the word that's
[1:15:37] right the word and the word will come
[1:15:40] together if we're part of Christ part of
[1:15:43] it we have to be his word because he is
[1:15:46] the word right yes sir they have refused
[1:15:50] the anointed Word of Promise of this age
[1:15:53] and he is always the word if God sent us
[1:15:56] an anointed promised word again for this
[1:15:58] age in 1946 he would be the same he was
[1:16:03] when when he come into the beginning the
[1:16:05] anointed word for the age see Hebrews
[1:16:09] 13:8 throws it right back in your lap
[1:16:12] and says he's the same yesterday today
[1:16:14] and forever that's exactly right and he
[1:16:17] would stay with the father's promised
[1:16:19] word for this age if Jesus comes he
[1:16:22] would be just exactly what the word said
[1:16:24] it would be in this age that's what
[1:16:26] Elijah was in his age that's what Moses
[1:16:29] was in his age that's what Noah was in
[1:16:32] his age that's what everywhere every
[1:16:35] Prophet ever come and the word when it
[1:16:37] comes in its fullness the entire word
[1:16:40] made flesh Among Us it did just exactly
[1:16:44] what it said it would do in that age if
[1:16:47] it come today he would be just exactly
[1:16:51] Jesus Christ Living out his promise of
[1:16:54] what he promised to do just as the
[1:16:58] word can I read one more sir questions
[1:17:01] and answers
[1:17:03] 1964 so paragraph 49 so being
[1:17:06] well-trained Theologian had nothing to
[1:17:08] do with it being Meek and gentle had
[1:17:11] nothing to do with it what made him
[1:17:13] different he was the word made flesh not
[1:17:15] the word for the day of Moses Moses was
[1:17:19] that day word not the word for the days
[1:17:22] of Noah Noah was the word for that day
[1:17:25] not the word for the day of Elijah
[1:17:28] Elijah was the word for that day but he
[1:17:30] was the present tense word and they were
[1:17:34] living in the back amen the same thing
[1:17:39] repeats amen that's the evidence of the
[1:17:42] Holy
[1:17:44] Ghost when God reveals it to you and you
[1:17:47] see it thus said the Lord and accepted
[1:17:51] not what you are not what you was or
[1:17:54] nothing about it's what God has done for
[1:17:57] you now there's the
[1:18:01] evidence so we thank the
[1:18:06] Lord that we know what a redeemed son
[1:18:09] looks
[1:18:10] like and with this pattern in view we
[1:18:13] have an
[1:18:14] example James 5 says take for your
[1:18:19] example the
[1:18:21] prophets we have an example of what a
[1:18:24] redeemed son looks like is that right
[1:18:26] Saints that's what we're coming to and
[1:18:30] this comes through as the book The open
[1:18:33] book of redemption the book of
[1:18:35] redemption the Bible begins to open up
[1:18:38] to us and reveal to us our
[1:18:41] names we thank God for it and this is
[1:18:45] the beauty of the message so we have so
[1:18:48] many more quotes here the incarnated
[1:18:51] word but this
[1:18:53] Authority that man has has
[1:18:55] lost Jesus speaks of it in Matthew
[1:18:58] chapter 8 Ma and Mark chapter 13 and we
[1:19:03] like to read those just before we close
[1:19:05] Matthew chapter 8 vers number
[1:19:15] six when you have that you can say amen
[1:19:23] amen and the Bible says and saying Lord
[1:19:27] my servant Li at home sick of the py
[1:19:30] grievously tormented Jesus said unto him
[1:19:33] I will come and heal him the Centurion
[1:19:36] answered and said Lord I'm not worthy
[1:19:38] that thou should come under my roof but
[1:19:41] speak the word only and my servant shall
[1:19:43] be healed for I am a man under Authority
[1:19:48] now this was a gentile now and he
[1:19:52] understand this rule or the law or the
[1:19:54] precepts of what Authority was what it
[1:19:58] means to have authority and we as
[1:20:01] Believers don't have power but we have
[1:20:04] the authority that's given to us from
[1:20:07] the book of redemption amen and this man
[1:20:11] he says I'm under Authority having
[1:20:13] soldiers under me and I say to this man
[1:20:16] go he goeth into another comeon he
[1:20:19] cometh and to my servant do this and he
[1:20:21] doeth it when Jesus heard it he what
[1:20:25] he
[1:20:26] marveled and said to them that followed
[1:20:30] what' he say verily I say unto you I
[1:20:33] have not found so great faith no not in
[1:20:37] Israel this man caught Jesus's attention
[1:20:41] this Gentile because he understood what
[1:20:44] Authority
[1:20:45] was and if there ever was an age that
[1:20:48] where the Prophet taught us the
[1:20:50] authority of the word how the power of
[1:20:55] God lays in his word our attitude
[1:20:58] towards God is our attitude towards his
[1:21:02] word and when that word is revealed back
[1:21:04] to you you now have the authority of the
[1:21:08] author of the word if you can receive it
[1:21:12] now we can act immature we can act like
[1:21:14] babies or we can grow up and take the
[1:21:17] authority of the word and do what Jesus
[1:21:21] told us to do by believing every word
[1:21:25] standing on it and believing it until it
[1:21:27] comes to pass this is what we're coming
[1:21:30] into this is what uh the prophet came
[1:21:34] into and he's our example is that right
[1:21:36] a man of under Authority I verely I say
[1:21:40] unto you I have not found so great faith
[1:21:42] no not in Israel Mark
[1:21:45] 13:33 let's read that
[1:21:53] scripture
[1:21:57] don't you love the
[1:22:01] Lord they don't know who they got
[1:22:03] working at the job where you're working
[1:22:06] son or daughter of
[1:22:08] God they think they can control You by
[1:22:11] their systems of government and the the
[1:22:15] bosses and the human
[1:22:18] resources they can keep you down from a
[1:22:21] promotion hide your good deeds they
[1:22:24] don't have control over you you're a son
[1:22:26] or daughter of
[1:22:29] God yes we have that
[1:22:33] Authority take heed and watch and pray
[1:22:36] for you know not when the time is for
[1:22:38] the son of man is as the man taken a far
[1:22:41] Journey who left his house and gave
[1:22:44] authority to his
[1:22:46] servants and to every man his work and
[1:22:50] commanded the porter to watch watch ye
[1:22:53] therefore for you know not when the
[1:22:55] Master of the House cometh at evening at
[1:22:58] midnight at the crowing or in the
[1:23:01] morning let's coming suddenly he find
[1:23:04] you sleeping and I what I say unto you I
[1:23:08] say unto all
[1:23:11] watch now God has given us this
[1:23:14] Authority and with the authority of this
[1:23:17] book The Bible being open now the
[1:23:20] message we believe is a message that's
[1:23:23] absolutely founded on the Bible the word
[1:23:26] of God it's not abstract from the Bible
[1:23:29] no you ever start preaching a message
[1:23:31] and you don't have the Bible in there
[1:23:33] you're not preaching brother Brand's
[1:23:35] message uh and which one is more
[1:23:38] important it's it's
[1:23:41] ridiculous it's all God like do I want
[1:23:44] the Old Testament or new testament do I
[1:23:45] want Peter or Paul it's all
[1:23:48] God why choose from one when I can have
[1:23:51] both God gave us both it's the devil
[1:23:54] that wants to
[1:23:56] separate so you stay with the word and
[1:23:58] look at what the word has redeemed to us
[1:24:01] just briefly five little things and
[1:24:04] there's many but there's five smooth
[1:24:06] things that I'm that I'm going to bring
[1:24:08] out here just that has been revealed to
[1:24:10] us or given to us look at the third pool
[1:24:14] Vindicated a fully restored Adam on
[1:24:18] Earth
[1:24:19] again that's what the third pool
[1:24:21] Ministry did and we've seen that in the
[1:24:23] life of the Reverend William
[1:24:26] brandham Paul went to heaven to the
[1:24:29] third heaven he called it paradise and
[1:24:32] when he went there in 2 Corinthians
[1:24:34] chapter 2: 12 12 he said I met a man in
[1:24:37] Christ and I saw things that I could not
[1:24:41] speak of remember that scripture he saw
[1:24:44] he went to this other realm and he said
[1:24:46] it was 14 years ago he didn't talk about
[1:24:48] it much but he said 14 years ago I went
[1:24:51] and I knew a man and I went beyond the
[1:24:53] Third heaven and I saw things and I
[1:24:55] couldn't speak but in this day a prophet
[1:24:59] went beyond the curtain of
[1:25:03] time oh
[1:25:05] God and gave us
[1:25:08] details as to what happens to a man when
[1:25:11] he crosses over so we don't have
[1:25:14] funerals like they have funerals because
[1:25:18] we know what happens to our loved ones
[1:25:21] he went beyond the curtain of time and
[1:25:24] he saw his family his converts were
[1:25:29] there amen and he was the leader over
[1:25:32] there now do you believe that testimony
[1:25:35] yes I do has his head on the back he was
[1:25:38] laying in his bed so oh would help me so
[1:25:40] much would you like to look beyond the
[1:25:42] curtain of Time how many of us would
[1:25:44] have like to look beyond the curtain of
[1:25:45] time what's behind there and take a look
[1:25:48] God gave him the privilege to go beyond
[1:25:50] the curtain of time and then bring him
[1:25:53] back
[1:25:55] and tell you and I
[1:25:57] details praise the Lord
[1:26:00] amen that's because the book has been
[1:26:04] open look at the fellowship that's
[1:26:07] restored to God in this last age that
[1:26:11] was the promise that this Fellowship
[1:26:13] between God and man would be restored in
[1:26:17] the last age that's a promise so we look
[1:26:19] forward to that we know it's supposed to
[1:26:21] be here the Overcomers in this age they
[1:26:25] inherit all of the previous age
[1:26:28] Overcomer
[1:26:30] promises brother branam through the open
[1:26:33] word revealed that to us and then and
[1:26:37] this is really nice we saw the sign of
[1:26:40] the son of
[1:26:42] man on the
[1:26:47] recordings we saw it on the
[1:26:49] recordings it's on your
[1:26:52] tapes it happened
[1:26:54] it really happened it's real he stood
[1:26:57] before those people and God used him in
[1:27:01] such a mighty way and in that day we saw
[1:27:04] what happened with ad or Abraham when
[1:27:07] that angel came to him in the tent we
[1:27:09] saw it in the scripture with Jesus we
[1:27:12] all just writing all just written all
[1:27:14] just written but now we seeing how it
[1:27:18] happened how it function what it looks
[1:27:21] like it's
[1:27:22] tangible so we have an example of a
[1:27:26] redeemed Son of God that fit in the line
[1:27:30] of what Adam lost it was redeemed back
[1:27:33] in this age and samples of it was
[1:27:36] ministered through the life of the
[1:27:38] Reverend William brandham and that's
[1:27:39] what we're following and I'm coming to
[1:27:41] that maturity too and I trust you are
[1:27:44] too amen this is why we quote his
[1:27:47] message this is why we stand for it we
[1:27:50] don't ask permission for it we're not
[1:27:51] waiting for everybody to catch up with
[1:27:53] us we just running with it thank God for
[1:27:57] it thank God for you don't be ashamed of
[1:28:00] this word don't be ashamed of it God
