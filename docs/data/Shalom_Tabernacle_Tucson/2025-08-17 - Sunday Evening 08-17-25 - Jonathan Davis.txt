We don't want to, um, submit again the the needs that were brought this morning, but take them to the cross and leave them there. But well, we can thank God in advance for what he's going to do. So, we've got a lot um, traveling. Let's keep them in prayers. brother Israel uh and and uh and his family as they're traveling and keep them in prayer just that the hand of God would be on them.

So, we just do that together. We'll continue to sing that as our precious brother comes. I sure enjoyed that tonight. had a nice crew of visitors and we just pray that they got their fill up this morning like I did and we got some new visitors. I don't think we can call Hope a visitor but we appreciate you coming bringing Sister Ronnie tonight. So, welcome and just uh we were missing you sister Ellie and Sister Anne. So, it's nice to see you as well tonight Barry Debbie and each one just happy to be in church and looking forward to a nice time tonight as well. Sister Chris was gone this morning as well. So nice to see you, too. God bless you. Let's bless his name as long as uh it takes to bring Brother Jonathan out here. He can take his time or come right out and we'll have another good service tonight. And just miss Brother Israel. Hold him up as he returns. I'm sure he's been a blessing and and Lord will watch o over him. I think it's two hours ahead of us. And so whatever they're doing tonight and in the next day or so be in prayer for him and his journey, his strength and encouragement coming home and all those missing tonight, we pray for them. Let's just continue to sing that chorus. I bless your name. I bless your name. I give you honor, give you praise. You are the life, the truth, the life. [Music] I bless your name. I bless your name. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I give you all [Music] you praise. You are the [Music] wind. &gt;&gt; I bless your name. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. I bless your name. &gt;&gt; Sing &gt;&gt; I sing praises to his name. &gt;&gt; Is that me? A little buzzing. There's a little buzzing going on. &gt;&gt; Maybe we can just worship him for a few moments. [Music] &gt;&gt; You know, just uh trying to find the leading of the Lord. I don't ever want to take these things lightly. ever. &gt;&gt; I want God to actually use me. &gt;&gt; I don't want to have my own mind, my own ideas. It said, "Let this mind being in you that was in Christ Jesus." &gt;&gt; He He thought of not robbery to be equal with God. But if you go down another two verses, it said he humbled himself even onto death. He knew who he was. He knew what he was sent to do. But he was able to humble himself and that's all he requires of us to do as well. If &gt;&gt; we can just lay everything aside and we can humble oursel. We know if it wasn't for him from the dust we came, the dust will return. But because he came and he gave us what we have, we go from the dust to the stars. The prophet said &gt;&gt; there is no end. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's an eternal thing that is living inside of you. Would you like to worship him for giving that to you? Maybe we'll just worship him. I pray I sing praises to him for giving me this precious gift. &gt;&gt; I sing praises to your name, Jesus. [Music] Hallelujah. Praises to your name. Oh, [Music] for your name is great and greatly to be praised. I sing praises to your name. Oh hallelujah. Praises to your name. Oh Lord, for your name is great and greatly true. One more time. One more time with all your heart. Jesus, I sing praises to your name. Oh, hallelujah. Oh Lord, praises to your name. Oh, [Music] for your name is great and greatly [Music] greatly to be praised. God [Music] &gt;&gt; to be praised. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wonderful God. Wonderful God. Wonderful. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah.

[Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Oh heavenly father, how we praise you. &gt;&gt; How we lift you up, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord, you are worthy of every effort. You are worthy of every praise. You are worthy of everything, Father. Lord, we give you this few moments again that you may be lifted up before the people, Lord, that you may come and commune with your chosen Father, the ones that you loved and gave up your life for, Father. Lord, we just long to be with you. Just long to fellowship with you, Father. We ask that you'd be pleased with these few moments that you would speak to us once again. Help me to get out of the way. Guard my tongue, guard my mind, and guard my heart. May we all come together, Lord, for your glory and for your honor. We ask these things Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn into our scriptures. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's uh good to be in the house of the Lord. Don't know if you've noticed, but I really love to praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's uh &gt;&gt; he's everything. &gt;&gt; He's everything and he's worth everything. And you know, we feel so, at least I can speak for myself, so inadequate. And um and I and I hope that never leaves. &gt;&gt; I know. &gt;&gt; Amen. Does it need to go up? Oh, thanks for Levi. I know I'm missing my little plastic things that go in the sides. Sometimes you need stuff like that to keep you humble as well. You know, I'm I'm just a human just like everybody else. And praise God that he uh cho chooses imperfect imperfect beings, &gt;&gt; imperfect vessels so his glory could be seen. All right, let's uh let's go to Exodus chapter 12. We'll start at the the third verse. And it says, "Speak unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, in the 10th day of this month, they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house. And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next onto his house take it according to the number of the souls, every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb. Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year. Ye shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats, and you shall keep it up until the 14th day of the same month. And the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening. And they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side post and on the upper doorpost and of the houses wherein they shall eat it. And they shall eat the flesh in the night roast with fire and unleaven bread, and with bitter herbs they shall eat it. Eat not of it raw nor soden at all with water, but roast with fire, his head and his legs, and his pertinence thereof. And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning. And that which remainth of it until the morning, you shall burn it with fire. May the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word. You may be seated. I want to take a little portion out of that reading. As you know, this is the Passover. This is the uh the time of the Passover. And I'm I don't know if you noticed or not. I'm not much of a deep teacher. Uh it's just not my thing. I really enjoy hearing the deep teachings of God and and the depths that these some of these brothers can go in. But, you know, I am what I am, and I think um that's the best place to be and stay. &gt;&gt; So, I'm not going to go into everything uh about this, but I want to bring out a little a little portion of this scripture because I believe it's important for believers uh to know these things. So the Bible says here, and I thought this was really interesting. It says, "And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next onto his house take it according to the number of the souls, every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb." You see, cuz they were required to eat the whole lamb. And if there wasn't enough in your house to eat the whole lamb, and there wasn't enough in your neighbor's house to eat the whole lamb, well, you guys can come together and get it done, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You know, and I like how the the Bible I like how God he always includes the neighbor. &gt;&gt; You you realize that the two you remember the two greatest commandments, &gt;&gt; one was to love God. The next was to love your neighbor. &gt;&gt; And you know, I always love that parable. Your neighbor is not who you think it is all the time. &gt;&gt; Not necessarily the one sitting next to you, but it's the the least likely. It's the least likely. But I'm not preaching about that today. I'm I am wanting to talk about sharing my lamb with my neighbor. I want to share my lamb with my neighbor. &gt;&gt; Now the Bible says in Luke 15, "What man uh what man of you 15:4 having a hund sheep if he lose one of them does not leave the 90 and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find it?" Now we realize that that is a desire to go after the lost. That's what he's talking about. &gt;&gt; God has a desire to go after the lost. &gt;&gt; You know, if we're not careful, we get to we get comfortable a and we get unconcerned. Brother Brandham preaches a message. You're convinced and then you're concerned &gt;&gt; because now you believe. &gt;&gt; You know that these things are true. And how could we watch somebody that as he would illustrate it oftent times somebody on a boat going straight for a great fall a great cataract and and not say anything about it. You know, we we've we've encountered Christ and now we have him. Now we have that eternal life and there's there are those out there that are still suffering and that are lost and and they don't have they don't uh they don't maybe have a lamb, &gt;&gt; right? They don't have a lamb. &gt;&gt; You have the lamb. &gt;&gt; The lamb is in your house. &gt;&gt; You the lamb. You have the lamb. &gt;&gt; Your neighbor don't have the lamb. &gt;&gt; We should have a desire just like the great shepherd. You know, everybody else that's in the fold. They're good. Now, let's go out and let's get that that one that is in danger. the one that's in danger of the wolves. The one that's in danger of falling off the cliff. Let's have a desire in our heart to go after that one. &gt;&gt; We have the lamb. We're good. &gt;&gt; We need more people to come eat this lamb. &gt;&gt; We need more people to come sit around here and and get under the blood of the door. &gt;&gt; Come into the house and get ready. Amen. &gt;&gt; For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved. &gt;&gt; Now that is God's heart. &gt;&gt; That's what God wants. &gt;&gt; And and sometimes it's just too easy. It's too easy to read that and &gt;&gt; think, "Oh, that's a Baptist &gt;&gt; thing. That's the Bible. &gt;&gt; That that's my thing." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that your attitude towards that scripture &gt;&gt; would determine your eternal destination. So I I want to have the best attitude towards all the scripture, but particularly this one. &gt;&gt; I I want to I want to do the right thing. I want to &gt;&gt; I want to be what I say I am. &gt;&gt; I was talking to a a friend of mine and and you know it just came to me. This is how the simple things come and he's going through all this stuff and he's trying to figure it out and all these things. And I said, "You know what you need to do? You just need to be what you say you believe you are. &gt;&gt; Just &gt;&gt; you you say you believe all this stuff. Well, then then believe it. &gt;&gt; Let it become more than just something you're saying, &gt;&gt; but let it let it start manifesting out of your life. &gt;&gt; You know, the these children of Israel, they couldn't just say, "I'm going to go get a lamb. &gt;&gt; I'm going to make it ready. &gt;&gt; I'm going to share it with my neighbor. And I'm going to put the blood on the door." And then not do it. &gt;&gt; If they did that, they would perish. But we have to do what we say we're going to do. &gt;&gt; We have to believe and be what we say we believe. &gt;&gt; And we will. But part of it is being concerned about others. Part of it is not just, you know, uh uh building our own little deal &gt;&gt; and saying, you know, inside these walls we're safe. So, we're not ever going to go outside of these walls. Now, don't don't get me wrong. I'm not saying get out of Christ. You need to stay in Christ. &gt;&gt; Don't But I'm saying don't make a denomination of yourself. Don't don't build these walls where where nobody can come in and you don't go out and now you're just alone &gt;&gt; because that's what you'll be. You'll be alone. &gt;&gt; Christ ain't going to stay inside your box. &gt;&gt; We can't put God in a box. &gt;&gt; See, God, he so desired uh he so had a heart for the lost &gt;&gt; that he didn't only give his only begotten son. He be he became the son. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Huh? Brother Ben, Jehovah of the old, Jesus of the new. &gt;&gt; He He He poured himself into the sun and he lived this life so that you and I could receive what he had. &gt;&gt; That that is his desire. See, God God he he saved all of us in a in a condition that we weren't worthy. We were all lost and &gt;&gt; and he came and he &gt;&gt; just for an illustration, he came out of the box of eternity because he didn't want to be there alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as Christians, we don't want to just have this to oursel and and and have it alone. But &gt;&gt; and I know I know I'm talking to Christians. That's our desire. But we're just preaching is just a reminder. &gt;&gt; Just trying to stir up the thing that's already inside of you &gt;&gt; so that we can go out and we can be the living word &gt;&gt; for our day. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; You know, we want to we want to reach and grab these great big things. You know, Brother Brandham says we could we could uh speak worlds into existence and go live on it, &gt;&gt; but we can't even change the atmosphere in our homes. We we expect that we're going to build this uh we're going to speak a world into existence and we can't even speak peace and love to one another. &gt;&gt; So we sometimes we need to drop back, &gt;&gt; live where we're at, &gt;&gt; get those things right. &gt;&gt; And like brother Po's been preaching, you know, you're not going to have that authority &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; there if you can't do the little things here. &gt;&gt; And that's my desire. One of the most basic things is to stretch out a hand &gt;&gt; to somebody that needs help. &gt;&gt; You know, we don't want to be like the the story goes, the good Samaritan. We want to be like the good Samaritan, but we don't want to be like the the priests and, &gt;&gt; you know, the Levites where that guy, he he, you know, he he's putting me in danger of getting dirty. He's putting me in danger. Uh and plus he's not going to make it anyways. &gt;&gt; Huh? Because And they they were the ones they were the ones that knew supposedly God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They were the ones that God he he took them out here at the Passover and he set their nation a as his nation, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he would be the God of those people. and and he gave them the his laws and he told them the truth and he told and you know he never did he he always gave the neighbor a chance. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he did. &gt;&gt; He gave other people a chance to come and join. &gt;&gt; They just had to do what they that the Israelites were doing. &gt;&gt; You know, and we can't cut off chance from people. We can't cut off hope. We're supposed to be the hope. &gt;&gt; Christ in you, the hope of glory. And it's just by the basic simple things living a life. He desired he desired to save the lost. Now I I referenced that scripture. Let this mind be in you. &gt;&gt; His mind, his eternal thought, &gt;&gt; it was to save the lost. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and if that mind is in you, &gt;&gt; it's to save the lost, &gt;&gt; it it's to put an outstretched hand to somebody that is in darkness, somebody that is lost in sin, you know, if if nobody if nobody told So my uncle Jeff, he's the one that witnessed to me. I heard I heard uh the message all my life, but he's the one that told me that God is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him. &gt;&gt; And he told me about the chicken peeping its way out of the egg &gt;&gt; to be born. &gt;&gt; He told me those two things and that's when life inside of me begin to stir and begin to start breaking forth. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, if nobody told him, &gt;&gt; his testimony is that he landed out in some village in Alaska and there was some crazy guy there on the airport strip that was asking him if he knew God. &gt;&gt; And he thought he knew God. He was a Catholic. &gt;&gt; But then when the guy started telling him about the message, &gt;&gt; you know, at first he was thinking there was nothing to it. But then he he decided to dig a little deeper. He he decided to look at it a little bit closer. Long story short, I don't know how many years later, but eventually he told me that God is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him. &gt;&gt; My uncle Jeff was always one to have an outstretched hand. He was always one to have a a a a place for, you know, little hoodlams. I wasn't the only one. He had some other running around too. And that wasn't maybe the best idea to put us together. But but the heart desire &gt;&gt; was to come into my house and partake of this lamb. Ha, have some of this lamb. &gt;&gt; That song goes, taste and see. &gt;&gt; The Lord is good. So our desire as as Christians, as message believers, however you want how to frame it, but you know, you're just you're a Christian. &gt;&gt; You know, we begin to make oursel uh a message believer and we start to be better than other Christians. &gt;&gt; That ain't right. &gt;&gt; You know that ain't right. &gt;&gt; God, whoever whoever is yours It don't matter what they look like, what church they go to, what even religion they are. &gt;&gt; Now, of course, they can't stay in that. &gt;&gt; They have to come out of their house and come into your house and start partaking of the actual lamb of God. &gt;&gt; They have to do that. They have to make their own choice. But our our desire, our job is to have that open door, &gt;&gt; have that table prepared. &gt;&gt; That's our job. We can't make anybody do anything. &gt;&gt; We can't, you know, for a while we can make our kids I can still make my kids do stuff &gt;&gt; for the most part, but after a while and then I can only speak from from my own experience. After a while, my mom stopped being a she wasn't able to make me do anything anymore. &gt;&gt; I had to make that choice. And oftent times if I would have made the choice to just listen a lot better for me would have saved me a lot of trouble you know but she can never make me and it's the same thing and and same thing with my wife. I can't make her or you shouldn't. Brother Brandham said that's not right. &gt;&gt; And I don't got the quote ready but he said that's not the way. &gt;&gt; But you tell her the truth. You tell them the truth and they make the choice. Now, if they're Christians, they're Christians. He said, "A wife that doesn't obey her husband's not a Christian." So, he also said that. That's just what he said. That's not we're talking about. We're talking about sharing our lamb. For a uh 1 Corinthians 1:21, for after that in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God. It pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believed. &gt;&gt; You see, it's written all over God's We know the Bible is God's word, right? &gt;&gt; And a word is a thought expressed. So God's thoughts, we're reading them right here. This is his thoughts &gt;&gt; that that God for after that in wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God. So by knowledge by scientific research by by whatever theology by the world's wisdom they could not know God &gt;&gt; they could not know it. You see, the only way is the way that you got it. This scripture is really powerful. It pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believed. Now, brother Brandham said, God keeps his word. He says Jesus said you're the salt of the earth. &gt;&gt; But the salt can only be a savior as it contacts. So you've got to make a contact. And your life is the best thing to make a contact with anybody. I'd rather you live me a sermon than preach me one any time. And the rest of the world the same thing, you know. God covered it all. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; You might think, "Oh, I'm not a preacher. I I I don't preach. I don't do this. I don't do that." But you got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And really, your lives your lives will be do more. It'll do do more for somebody than if if that those somebody's came here and and sat and listened to me talk for 45 minutes to an hour or whatever it is your life. Brother Brandham actually rather fellowship with you than listen to me preach. He said, "I rather you live me a sermon. Rather you live the life, &gt;&gt; live the things that you hear over the pulpit, &gt;&gt; live the things that you hear on the tapes &gt;&gt; that and God would be pleased by your life preaching the gospel and people receiving that life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh St. John 4:1. And I'm just kind of going through these things. You know, brother brother Poe kind of sprung the second service on me. I didn't know. He he told me earlier this week, but before when I was coming, I thought, well, come on Sunday. Then he was all like, can you go to Mesa and can you preach two services on Sunday? And so, God bless him. So, we'll just uh try to give you what's on my heart, and &gt;&gt; I pray that uh Lord blesses you with it. &gt;&gt; John 4, when therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples. The scripture says that Jesus that they knew that Jesus baptized more than John the Baptist. And then it says, "But it wasn't Jesus." You like that? &gt;&gt; I like that kind of stuff. Jesus didn't baptize himself, but his disciples were doing the baptizing. But the Bible says it was Jesus. &gt;&gt; You know, you think you're doing the living. &gt;&gt; You think you're living, you're walking the walk and talking the talk. You you you think you're living the sermon. &gt;&gt; It's Jesus. &gt;&gt; It's Jesus that's doing that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It don't take a whole lot of words and a whole lot of convincing. It takes somebody looking at that at you and saying there's something about that that I want. &gt;&gt; No matter no matter what's going on in life, no matter no matter what's going on in their home or their house, yeah, they have good days and bad days, happy days and sad days, but they always remain a Christian. They always set their sight on Jesus and they always give him glory no matter what. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that will do more for them &gt;&gt; than them coming in here and listening to me or anybody else. &gt;&gt; See, God, he gave us all a part. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says the wages of sin are death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, we all have sinned and we all How's it go? come short of the glory of God. &gt;&gt; We all have. &gt;&gt; But the gift of God, &gt;&gt; see, we all have sinned. &gt;&gt; We all deserve death. &gt;&gt; We all owe that wage. &gt;&gt; But the gift of God, but the gift of God through Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You know what? which is you. Did you know that the gift of God comes through you? Now, it came and it lived in the man Jesus Christ, but he died and rose again and separated himself and now he's living in you &gt;&gt; now. The gift of God, it comes through you. &gt;&gt; Now, don't get a big head. &gt;&gt; It's the seed. the seed of Christ. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 2:12, "Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God." Freely given to us of God. That's that gift that we're talking about. given. &gt;&gt; Let me read that again. Now we have received not the spirit of the world. Yeah, we used to we used to live in the world. We used to have that spirit. But the Bible says, "I will give them a new heart, a heart of flesh." Instead of the stony heart, &gt;&gt; he said, "Then I'll give them a new spirit." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll give them a new spirit. &gt;&gt; And then I will give them my spirit. &gt;&gt; We do not have the spirit of the world. &gt;&gt; But now we have the spirit which is of God that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. And that encompasses all the things that come from God that was given to us. &gt;&gt; And there's many things and we'll get to maybe some of those here in a minute. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to read in the church age book just a little portion here, uh, page 300. I may skim it a little bit, but just to get the gist, start on that second paragraph. He never told them to go into all the world and establish Bible colleges. Nor did he tell them to pass out literature. Now, those things are fine, but what Jesus told them to do was to preach the gospel. Stick with the word. &gt;&gt; I like how that those are in big letters there. Stick with the word. &gt;&gt; And then signs would follow. Correct. &gt;&gt; The very first induction we have in the way of the kingdom of God was to be preached was when he sent out the 12 in Matthew 10 1-8. He commissioned and instructed them on this wise. And when he had called unto him his 12 disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease. Now, the names of the twel apostles are these, and we'll just skip over that. These 12 uh these 12 Jesus sent forth and commanded them, saying, "Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans. Enter ye not, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils. Freely ye have received, freely give. This ministry that he gave them was actually the sharing of his own ministry with them. &gt;&gt; For it says in Matthew 9:35 through38, "And Jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in the synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people. But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd. Then saith he unto his disciples, "The harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few. Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth laborers into the harvest." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll just read that next line. Now many people have the idea that just the apostles had this ministry given them by our Lord Jesus and so when they died the ministry was over. That is not so. &gt;&gt; That is not so. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that we are a continuation &gt;&gt; of the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; And what did they do in the book of Acts? They spread the gospel and and not only that, how did they spread it? They just lived it. It was the acts of the Holy Spirit and the apostles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's the same thing today. You know, you can go on and on in the book of Acts and you can see example after example &gt;&gt; of them bringing people to Christ, bringing them to the gospel which is Jesus Christ and him crucified and resurrected and living in you. Christ in you, the hope of glory. So what what should I be like if I have his life in me? What should I be like if I have his mind in me? Should I be worried about the lost sheep maybe? Should I be concerned about more than just my my problems in my box? Or could I maybe do like Jesus and leave a comfortable place in life to take on a ministry to try to find somebody that is lost? Have you ever just really thought about God leaving glory? How comfortable that must have been. He didn't have a problem. He didn't have any of us yet. Brother Brandham said he was there with his own thoughts. So, I guess we were still there. But he wanted to manifest and he wanted to bring forth himself as a redeemer, &gt;&gt; as a as a bridegroom, as all these as a healer, as all these as a savior. &gt;&gt; And we have a part in playing that out. &gt;&gt; Yes, we do. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was in his mind. So let that mind be in you. He was brother Brandham that day at Calvary. He was just one man, the perfect man. He gave his life and he made an example for you. Now m what must we do? Now the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself. His life was spent for others. That's perfectly eternal life. When you say you go to church and you do good things, that's fine. But when you live your life to yourself, you haven't eternal life. Eternal life is living for others. &gt;&gt; It proved it when he come in the lamb of God. He lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself. He lived for others. And you receive eternal life by receiving that day. And you don't live for yourself no more. You live for others. &gt;&gt; That's pretty good. &gt;&gt; Matthew 10:8, it says he healed the sick, cleansed the lepers, raised the dead, cast out devils. Freely you have received, freely give. Now freely uh you know we we freely receive this eternal life. Is there anything that you did? Is there anything that you could do to get this? Is there anything you can do to heal yourself? But God, he freely gave it to you. &gt;&gt; Now you can be healed. &gt;&gt; Now, not only can you be healed, but you can lay your hands on other people &gt;&gt; and they can be healed. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; You you you have eternal life and now you can impart eternal life to others. Now, don't h ask me how all that works because I don't know. I don't know how all of it works, but I know that he said he said it. &gt;&gt; And maybe it's a cup of water that your neighbor gives you. Maybe that's it. I don't know. May maybe it's your life that somebody sees and and then they become a Christian. Huh? What is it? I don't know. But you have the power. You have the power to impart eternal life. &gt;&gt; It's living inside of you. &gt;&gt; Now, don't just box it up inside, but begin to express that. &gt;&gt; You say, "How do I express it?" By praying and reading your Bible every day, &gt;&gt; putting your shoes on one foot at a time, unless you got a different method, and going and living a life for Jesus. You don't have to go on the street corners and preach. Brother Brandham said he'd rather you just live. &gt;&gt; Just walk down the street. &gt;&gt; Just stop at the store, get a drink, you know, just help just help somebody else that that needs your help. &gt;&gt; Allow people to help you. I always I always accept &gt;&gt; a drink from somebody &gt;&gt; like watermen. &gt;&gt; I got to respectfully decline the other types of drinks. I don't do that no more. But I always will accept if somebody wants to give me a bottle of water or something like that because I don't know, maybe that's it. Brother Brandham said, "Don't you know that you will judge the angels even?" &gt;&gt; And at the white throne judgment, he tells that story about uh I can't remember the name right now. Uh something green, I think. Anyways, he tells that story about the guy. He he said he said he was seeing his life on that big screen, the white throne judgment, and they asked him, "Have you ever lied?" And he thought he was a pretty good guy. And he didn't lie. And turns out he lied. &gt;&gt; Have you ever done this? You ever done that? And long story short, he did it all. &gt;&gt; He was a sinner. &gt;&gt; And he was just about to be cast out. Depart from me. He was waiting to hear those words, depart from me and go into eternal damnation. And he heard something instead. He said he he said, "Father, he stood for me. &gt;&gt; I'm standing for him." &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to be one that that can stand up &gt;&gt; and say, you know, they might have not did everything right. &gt;&gt; They might have not knew you the way that I know you, but they did what they knew. They did what they could and they try to help me rather than go against me. I believe in the church age book that's what he says that they were helpers of the bride those that are granted eternal life at the white throne judgment helpers of the bride you know not everybody can be bride but God so loved the world &gt;&gt; God actually loved the world &gt;&gt; it was not his will that any should perish &gt;&gt; he he wants to give people opportunity &gt;&gt; he gave Cain an opportunity &gt;&gt; man what kind of harm heart does God have? &gt;&gt; He he brother Brandham said Jesus was the very heart of God &gt;&gt; and now Jesus is living in you. &gt;&gt; So what is our what is our desire? What is our heart? What is our action? What is our motive? What is our objective? &gt;&gt; Come into the house and partake of this lamb and live. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll have the musicians come forward. I'm I'm about done. But I got some a couple more quotes. &gt;&gt; I I love the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; I I love the the prophet of God. &gt;&gt; Just the things that he was able to bring out &gt;&gt; by the grace of God and I was able to receive. &gt;&gt; I know who I am. I know what my purpose is. &gt;&gt; I have some wonderful promises. I don't have to worry about my children. Even though I will, but God bless you for it. You You should. You know, somebody tells you don't worry about your children. All right. Well, okay. Well, I'll try. But I believe God, he he left glory for his children. &gt;&gt; He did everything that he needed to do to get his children in. So as a as a father, as a mother, as a grandparent, that's what we do. &gt;&gt; Now, now we don't worry in the sense that because of their situation, God can't do something. &gt;&gt; But we don't want to see things happen in this life that that are harmful or hurt our children. We don't want that. &gt;&gt; We don't want that for our friends or our family or a sinner on the street. We shouldn't &gt;&gt; we shouldn't want that for our enemy. &gt;&gt; You know, he said you should love your enemy. That's a hard one. Anybody had an enemy before? &gt;&gt; Somebody that despitefully used you and wanted bad things for you &gt;&gt; and you're just like, I love you. Let me do nice things for you while you do terrible things to me. &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus did. He said, "Father, forgive them. &gt;&gt; They don't know what they're doing. as they did terrible things to him. I want to live the way he wants me to live. Believe for safety. Then apply. See, believe for here is what you want to believe for. Now this is brother Brandham telling us what we want to believe for. [Music] See you want to believe you want your own your own safety. You believe for your own for your safety and then apply the token for the whole family. See you say how can I do that? Claim it. If it worked on you, then you and the word becomes one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He says, see, see, it works for both of you. And you and the word are one. Then apply it to your children. Apply it to your loved ones. &gt;&gt; Like Rahab did. She applied the token to her father. She applied it to her mother. She applied it to her brothers and sisters. And they got them all in. You apply it. Say, "Lord, I'm going after my son. I'm going after my daughter. I claim her. Satan, you turn her loose. I I'm coming after her. I apply my token. The Holy Spirit, oh, Holy Spirit, that lives within me. Catch my daughter there. I'm going to her now. And your and your anointing upon me." &gt;&gt; He'll do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Church of the living God, the prophet of God said, "You do that. You do what he's saying there. You do what you say you believe. You act out the faith that's inside of you and you claim it. And you do what he says." And he said that God will do it. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; So be it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham says, "Amen is a finality. It's the final word. It's the stamp of God's approval." [Music] Then apply the token in prayer, with consideration, with believing. Apply it with such love and so forth till you know it's going to take. It's going to take place. That's all. Apply it in confidence, believing it's going to help. When you talk to that child, when you talk to your husband, talk to your wife, talk to the loved one, believe that it's going to help. Just stand there and say, "Lord, I've claimed them. They're mine. I'm getting them for you, Lord." What a wonderful message. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; These promises, they're ours. &gt;&gt; And it don't matter what the devil says about it. &gt;&gt; God's word is true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every man's word's a lie, including yours if it doesn't match God's word. Whatever your thoughts are telling you, it's a lie if it doesn't match God's word. &gt;&gt; But God's word is true. No matter what. no matter what. He's not counting on your flesh. He's not counting on your ability. He's not counting on your money, your your talent, your skill, your job. He's counting on you to yield yourself to him and live a life and then God will do the rest. We just got to hold on. We just got to hold to God's unchanging hand. Trust him. He's able. Do you believe that? I just want to live the way he wants me to live. I want to give till there's no more to give. That's my desire. Freely was I given. Lord, freely may I give. You love him tonight. God bless you. Let's sing the song to him. I want to live the way he wants me to live. I want to give until there's just no more to give. I want to love love till there's just no more love. I could never ever out love the Lord. There's been times when giving and loving brought pain. And I promised I would never let it happen again. But I found out that loving was worth all the risk and that even in losing you win, I'm going to live. I'm going to live the way he wants me to live. Oh, I'm going to give until there's just no more to give. I'm going to love till there's just no more love. I could never ever out love the Lord. It's already done. [Music] I just feel like claiming it. The prophet said, "Claim it." I I do have family members that need to know Christ. I do have friends that need to know Christ. I I have people that I want to come and partake of this lamb. I want them to come in and get under this blood &gt;&gt; and receive salvation for their soul. I I have people that I care about. I have people that I love. And the prophet said, "Claim it." Oh, I just feel like doing what the prophet said and claiming it tonight. [Music] Hallelujah. Oh, it's already done. Hallelujah. [Music] It's already done. Oh, the battle it's over. The victory is won. It's already done. I'm already healed. I'm already healed. Yes, I'm already healed. I'm already here. Battle is over. Victory is won. Oh, it's already done. Here is my family is sealed. My family is sealed. Oh, hallelujah. My family is here. Oh, thank you, Jesus. The battle is over. Victory is won. My family is sealed. Let's claim this. Let's claim it like the prophet says, "My family is a hallelujah. Yes, my family is [Music] all the battle. It's over. Victory is won. It's already done. Whatever it is, whatever it is, oh, it's already done. Hallelujah. It's already done. It's already done. The battle is over. Victory is won. How about one more time? My family is sealed. Let that faith grab a hold for my family. Let that faith inside of you. Speak out. Send the Holy Ghost after your family members tonight. You're like the little mama that Brother was talking about. Oh, it's yours, church. It is yours. This promise is for you. Oh, one more time. One more time. My family is a done thing. It's a done deal. Oh, thank you, Jesus. The battle is over. Victory is one. It's already done. Yes, it's already done. Hallelujah. It's already done. The battle is over. Victory is won. &gt;&gt; It's all ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You love him. &gt;&gt; Maybe we'll just worship him, huh? &gt;&gt; Just worship him. &gt;&gt; Thinking of a song. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. That's it. Thank you, Lord, for saving my soul. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for making me whole. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for giving to me &gt;&gt; thy great salvation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Rich, free. &gt;&gt; Let's just thank him. Let's just thank him tonight for a few moments if if you don't mind. He He is worthy of all of it. Your your family sealed, you're healed. Whatever problem you have, it's already taken care of. When When he revealed himself to me, he told me that he died for me and that my past, my present, and future, all that was finished. The debt was paid. I am as free as free can be. And now I he he's given me his life and I'm able to impart it to others. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord, for saving my soul and for calling me into this wonderful message of the hour, which is Christ Jesus. Thank you Lord for saving my soul. Thank you Lord for making me whole. Thank you Lord for giving to me thy great salvation so rich and free. Thank you Lord for saving my soul.

That's so easy. &gt;&gt; Brother Joe, if you would come this evening and dismiss us in a word of prayer. [Music] &gt;&gt; You hear those chains falling? Amen. Maybe just a grain of sand tonight, but by faith the mountains are moving. So been been so good to be with each one of you. God bless you. Let's all stand as we just thank the master for starting to break change and move mountains. And Lord, we're so grateful to be in your presence, Lord. So good to be with people of like precious faith, Lord. Standing on this very word, the message of the hour, Lord, recognizing our day and the message. We're thankful, Lord, not because we're smart, something we did, something we're going to do as our brother has spoken, Lord, but just your grace and mercy, Lord. For we may have exhausted your mercy some days, some point, but never your grace as the prophet has taught us. We're so thankful to to know and to be a part of your bride, Lord. And as we depart this place, would we pray that you go with us, Lord? Bless our precious brother who's taken time and made a sacrifice, Lord. Great journey to go home tomorrow. Bless him, Lord. The devil will certainly attack him and attack us, our pastor. And we just hold on Lord to the word knowing and believing Lord for our family. We're applying the token for our loved ones and each need financial, spiritual, physical. Lord, all things we just commit to you Lord. Believing the chains are breaking by your grace, by your power, Lord God. Thank you for our precious brother Jonathan, brother Scott this day that you've given us to worship you.
