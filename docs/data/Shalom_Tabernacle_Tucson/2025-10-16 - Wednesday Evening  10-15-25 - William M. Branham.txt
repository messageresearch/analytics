Lord, we just want to thank you for your goodness, your faithfulness to us, Lord. Lord, just before the service reading in the book of Judges in the first chapter where tribe after tribe after tribe that failed to drive the enemies out of their promised land. And Lord, just thinking how that we have that same test that we go through when we have these enemies that we need to drive out of our lives, demons of pride, of lust, of whatever it may be, Lord. and you just you have them there and you've given us the you you've told us what to put on the whole armor of God. And Lord, we just want to come and just yield ourselves to you this evening. Lord, we just ask that you would just give us strength, Lord, to continue fighting this good fight. We thank you that you promised that you would never leave us, you'd never forsake us. And so Lord, as we continue to drive the enemies that are trying to possess our land out this evening, Lord, we just ask you just to come and minister to us this evening. Give us the strength that we need, Lord, to continue the battle. And we thank you, Lord, that you're in complete control of it. And Lord, we just ask that you would just take complete control of this service tonight. Lord, you know what each of us have need of. And we just ask, Lord, that you would just speak to that need this evening. Whether it's faith, Lord, whether it's it's deliverance from something, Lord, whether it's encouragement, Lord, you're our counselor. You're our healer. You're our savior. You're whatever we have need of this evening. And we just want to yield ourselves to you. We come with expectations tonight, Lord, knowing that you're here. And we just want to ask you to just take complete control of the service. And we commit it in your hands. We ask you in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Reach over and tell your neighbor, "Welcome to church." [Music] So I believe the book Song of Solomon is the only book that uh I don't know if brother Brandham reads a scripture out of here but there's a chapter Song of Solomon chapter 2 verse 8 goes the voice of my beloved behold he quickly comes sleeping over the mountain skipping upon the hills and it goes down and it says, "My beloved spake and said unto me, rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away." So that's where that song is from. Let's sing. It's manifesting time. Oh, the voice of my beloved. Behold, he quickly comes, sweeping over the mountains, over the hills he runs. Oh, I long to hear his voice. I love you today. Arise love my car and run away. Oh, the roots are on my one is coming with you. Captain who's coming to you.

Tonight, we're going to listen to a portion of the the the questions and answers. I think there's eight or so of those. And um before we do, let's read in the Psalms, Psalms 27. And we'll read that together as a class. This isn't a particular sermon Brother Brandham is preaching. So we'll take we'll take the Psalms 27. I'll read the first verse and all of you all will read the second verse and we'll just alternate those and we'll read the last verse al together. Amen. When you have that, you can say amen. The word of the Lord. Like to welcome each of you to the house of the Lord tonight. Amen. The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life. Of whom shall I be afraid? &gt;&gt; When the wicked, even my enemies and my flesh, they stumble. &gt;&gt; Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. Though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. Have I desired of the Lord? That what I seek after. I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life. To revoke the beauty of the Lord to inquire in his temple. For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion. In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall set me up upon a rock. my enemies about sacrifices &gt;&gt; here. Oh Lord, when I cry with my voice, have mercy also upon me and answer me. &gt;&gt; My heart unto thee, my face, Lord, what I seek. Hide not thy face far from me. Put not thy servant away in anger. Thou has been my help. Leave me not, neither forsake me, oh God of my salvation. &gt;&gt; My fathers mess up. &gt;&gt; Teach me thy way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain path because of my enemies. of my enemies. &gt;&gt; I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. Wait on the Lord. Be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart. Wait, I say on the Lord. Amen. That's what we come to do tonight is to wait on the Lord as the Holy Spirit will feed us with his mana from on high. These questions and answers, I think they're are a blessing to us. I didn't get to go through all of these, but I know they'll be a blessing to us. Amen. So, let's sing Only Believe as we uh go to this tape. Only believe, [Music] only [Music] all things are possible. Only we live. Only we only believe that all things are possible only. Let's make a confession and lift our hands and say, "Lord, Lord, I believe." Lord, I believe that all things are possible. Lord I [Music] Lord I believe I believe and all things are possible. Lord, I will. I bless you. You may be seated, Brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, I want to receive the Holy Ghost. I want to know what to do. I am uh burdened for my family to be saved. And a sister signed her name. If you want to receive the Holy Ghost, let me tell you something, my dear sister, if you're here. And um and uh uh brother Neville, was that a member of the church at the bottom? I don't know. I don't I don't remember them either. But if if you're here, sister B O U G If you're here, let me tell you, the Bible said, "Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness sake." &gt;&gt; You're so blessed to even want it. See, now remember, not that you you you've got it, but blessed are they that hunger and thirst for it, &gt;&gt; for they shall be &gt;&gt; filled. Stay right with it. &gt;&gt; What must I do for my family? Use the same faith that you're using for yourself, for your family. Commit them to the Lord and believe with all your heart that you're going to be saved. Let don't let this come on your natural thinking here. Let drop way down on the inside that subconscious. Then they're yours. God's given to you when you got it down here. Whatever you have in your heart here and ask for it. When you pray, believe that you receive what you asked for. How you can't doubt it no more. You can't believe it and doubt at the same time. &gt;&gt; How many knows that? &gt;&gt; You can't believe and doubt at the same time. You've got to believe that what you ask for, you receive it. Then he said it would be given to you. So you just believe for your family and they'll get it. Brother Brandon, what about our son? Since since um are not on the not preaching on the trumpets, remember the promise you gave me over the phone concerning him and the seven trumpets. I don't remember it. I don't remember what it was, but whatever it is, you let Billy Paul know what it is. Whatever I promised that I'll do. I don't remember. You know, sometimes I get maybe of a night time answer 30, 40 calls in one time, you see. So I don't remember night after night. Sometimes when I'm around, so I don't get whatever it is. What about my Catholic sister and brother? Thank you. Well, this person's from way out of town, way from Texas. I um well sister if you uh if you're from Texas and you get this tape or if there is a tape I guess there won't be no tape on it but if there is uh are they making a tape you making it uh all right if the tape then I tell you what if you on this tape when you find this remember what about or something about the seven trumpets I don't remember about that unless I promised to seam or something doing the seven trumpets if I did I'll sing because I didn't preach the seven trumpets trumpets. I preach the feast of the trumpets. You understood about that. And what about my Catholic sister and brother? Thank you. I'll tell you, Mrs. C O R N I L S N. If the lady here, see Billy Paul this morning and um and if you're not, well, I'll I I don't understand what it is. You see, it's just a question. I I can't make it out. See what it is because I promise something about her boy and the trumpets and about a Catholic sister and I I don't it's not my mind. I have to remember. Just see Billy um uh this must that's just a prayer request gives a person's name and said headaches and scientists so that just is pray for them I guess. All right. Please explain marriage and divorce. I've already got this. This is seven questions, eight questions on one piece of paper. Uh, please explains marriage and divorce. Um, Moses and um and Elijah on earth now. Are Moses and Elijah on earth now? Are they in America? No. See, no. They're not here. They won't be until the church is taken away. Then Moses and Elijah. How many understands that are? Amen. &gt;&gt; And um let's see. They don't have any names signed to this. So, all right. If ever who asks these questions, I believe there's seven of them. I gave Mark seven. All right. Explain the difference between the name of Jesus and the name of Jesus. Wait a minute. Explain the difference between the name Jesus and the name of Jesus. Well, they both be the same if they're applied the same way. You see, applied to the same person. the name Jesus and the name of Jesus. The name of Jesus and the name name Jesus is who he is. The name of Jesus is speaking of the person. So it be the say I think that doesn't that sound sensible? See the name Jesus is the person itself and the name of Jesus is you referring to that person. See say see my name is William. That's me. All right. Now you say I'm speak the name of William then you're referring to me. That's my name. thing now. Has the name of the Lord changed in the different dispensations? Yes. Yes. It was once called, he was called uh the I am. He's called Jehovah. And he's changed many times. The last time it was changed is when God became flesh and took a human name. Jehovah, I am. And all those are titles to a name. See, you just baptize the name of Jehovah, it have to be the name of Jesus Christ. He baptized in the name of Jehovah Rapi, Jehovah Manasses, and Jehovah Gyarai. All those, it had to be Jesus Christ. The I am is Jesus Christ. Remember stand there that day and he said, "You say you eat man in the wilderness. Our fathers eat man that are dead." He said, "And they said, well, we know now you're crazy because you're just a man not over 50 years old and say you seen Abraham." He said, "Before Abraham was, I am." See, he was the I am. And all the titles and names that ever belong to God was made one human name, the Lord Jesus Christ. All right. Now, if time ceases when the seals were open, then if time ceased, pardon me, when the seals were open, then the millennium is also then the millennium is also finished, is it not? No. No. Time didn't cease when the seals were open. Misunderstood it. What happened? the mysteries was revealed, not time ceased. See, just watch real close now and we'll play your tape if you got it from a tape. See, time never ceased until the uh this must be a post millennius or something and ask the question because see, we got a thousand years after the church has gone home and comes back upon the earth. Then time ceases in the new heavens and new earth. Now, the millennium is not the new heavens and new earth. There will still be sin after the millennium. &gt;&gt; The millennium is a type of Noah going in the ark and carried over and brought Ham and them on the other side and sin even come out of the ark. &gt;&gt; See, but Enoch, the translated one, was a type of the bride that went up, not the one that was carried over. So sin will still be on the other side of millennium, but not doing the millennium. See, during millennium is peace. See, but sin will be dealt with the other side of millennium. And then time fades out. And now the opening of the seven seals that was given by the Holy Spirit. The seven seals only was to make known what had been left off in the dispensations behind us. Now as some great theologian tried to corner me on that. He said, "Brother Brandom, you God someday will give you the secret of those seven seals. those seven seals will be something that we've never learned yet that it'll be something that's not even in the Bible. No, no, it won't be that because if you do that would make it a if I told you that I'd be a false prophet because you see this word there everything that's it's the whole revelation of Jesus Christ is all completed in this word. See, and if the seven seals pertain to the seven churches, it had to be already passed because we're in the Lady of Sea church age. And the seven seals was only revealing what they had left off back there and opened up what they had left, what Luther left, what Wesley left, and all the reformers and Pentecostals and down to the present time. Now the next thing left is the translation of the church and return of Moses, Elijah, the millennial marine upon the earth with the bride and groom for a thousand years and then the judgment bar and then a total annihilation of sin. It'll never be no more at that time. Now not the cease of seals never ended time or seasons until after the millennium. No, it'll still be time until after the millennium. Does the millennium have to do with the 1,000 years? Could it not be a generation? No. A generation allotted in the Bible is 40 years. But the Bible said, "And they lived and reigned with Christ 1,000 years." It will be 1,000 years upon the earth. Because 1,000 years upon the earth is only counted at time for parable like to God is one day. 1,000 years upon the earth is only one day with God as God counting time. How many understands that now? So it's that Sabbath day when the church will no more labor against sin and Satan is bound for a little season a thousand years because his subjects is all in hell and his the church that's on earth is redeemed and right in the presence of Christ. &gt;&gt; So he has nothing he can work on. So it's not a chain as I said a log chain. It's a chain of circumstance. He has nothing he can do. He's helpless and hopeless just waiting for the resurrection of the subjects. Then they're separated as the sheep from the goats. Uh did not the queen of Sheba come to Solomon to test him test him to find out for herself if the if the name of the Lord was truly Solomon or not? Believe I get that this way. Did not the queen of Sheba come to Solomon to test him to find out for herself if the name of the Lord was truly Solomon or not? I don't maybe I don't understand this one. Just excuse me just a minute. Let me read it again. Did not the Queen of Sheba come to Solomon to test him to find out for herself if the name of the Lord was truly Solomon or not. No, she never tested to find out if if God's name was Solomon. Solomon was a king. She come and she said she she said truly God is with his king and with his people. See, she come and was tested. She tested Solomon about his gift because she had things in her heart that Solomon revealed to her that showed that he was God's king up on earth. You remember down in I believe down in in uh in where she come from down in the land of of Sheba where she came from the people to come through you know and and tell about great things that's going on if they had a god up there that was anointed their king and the how the king was uh anointed of God. I don't believe she thought that Solomon's name or God's name was Solomon because if she did that would make her a pagan again. So she she could have did that in her heart. She could have thought that God was Solomon and Solomon was God because she was a heathen to begin with. But when Solomon revealed to her the secret in her heart by a gift of discernment which is called then wisdom. He discerned that she knew that God was with Solomon because then they had she found out if she come with that in her mind if if the person here the questioner is asking did she know then that truly Solomon the name of the Lord was truly Solomon. See Solomon was not the Lord. She had found that out by the people because they worshiped Jehovah. And there was the great ark uh and the great um uh testament the ark at the lord's commandments is in and they told her about on mount si and the different places where they'd been and then she could see that god that god of that testament was in this man because he had he had discernment which only belonged to god. See so she knew that that god was in Solomon. But now it might read that way if the questioner asked that. But did she know that the name of the Lord was truly Solomon? Maybe they didn't write it just the way they're thinking. You see, so I think maybe they see say this that the Lord was in Solomon. Yes. Sure did. Because if that's the question, sure. She knowed God because she made that remark and she wouldn't worship no other god. I believe she she said she'd always she seen what she had no breath left in her. She had no questions left in her. Solomon just revealed the whole thing and she knowed God was with him. We uh we were married 21 years ago by the justice of the peace. Was was it wrong? Yes, it was wrong for you to do that. Marriage belongs in the house of God. But being that you are married, here's when you're really married. You're married when you vow one to the other. When you promise one another that you're that you'll take one another, the justice of peace could give you license. That's legal terms of living together as husband and wife without being common law husband and wife. But when you promise this girl and this you promise that man that you'll live true to him and you take him to be your husband, you're married. Dan, you remember I explained that last week. I believe it was. See, when you promise her, see, even in the o in the old Bible, if a man was betrod to a maid, and you know the laws on that, it was just the same as an adultery. Certainly was. And he promised that was it. The question is asked today, was a anmental ament the same as a divorce? See, when you ask me those questions, friends, you don't know what that does to me. I've got many friends sitting here married two or three times. Did you realize I'm talking to my own son? Billy Paul. But did I spare Billy Paul? No. Indeed he Billy Paul got married to some little girl and come up and said, "Daddy, I'm going to get married." I was washing my car. I said, "But your head against the wall." Just kept on uh washing my car like that. He said, "I'm going to get married." I said, "Oh, go on." Just kept on like that. He goes around tell his mother. And his mother laughed at him. You know what he done? run off with some little kid still in common school and got married. We analled the wedding, the father, the girl, and myself. We annolled the wedding, but he was married just the same. He's my boy. Son, you're listening at me now. That's exactly. He come to me with the girl that he lives with now, my daughter-in-law, my little grandson. He said, "Daddy, will you marry me?" I said, "By no means. That's my own son. You think that don't cut me to the core?" when I packed him in my arms and done everything I could do and I've been both father and mother to him. You think that don't kill me to say that? But it's the truth. &gt;&gt; Certainly my boy sitting here listening at my daughter-in-law and my little grandson sitting right here now. But I tell him it's wrong because I've got to I'm duty bound to that word. &gt;&gt; And I say you got married by a magistrate. You should have been married by the church by the minister. That's a decent thing to do for a Christian. But being that you have already made that promise and vow and been married 21 years ago, I think it's all right. You say, "Well, I question might be, should I come and be married again?" If you wish to don't have nothing in your mind that bothers your faith because if anything's there, you can't go no further. And right there, you stop right there when that question mark comes. That's where you end right there. But I, for me, it would be all right. The man that baptized me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ finally run me out of church because I wouldn't agree with him on women preachers. That didn't make me be rebaptized again. See, surely not. &gt;&gt; That's all right. But just remember, these things are cutting to me. I got bosom friends sitting here, men and women that would take their leather, pull eye out, and give it to me. God asked them for it. Yes, sir. And they're married twice, sometimes three times. sitting right here now and my own boy, my own grandson, my grand and my daughter-in-law. I love look at Billy how I stood by him and how he stood by me. But to say truth or truth, it's truth truth. I I could go out here today and call up some of these assemblies of God or some of these people and tell them I I'm was all wrong. I ain't going to stay at that word. I'm going to stay with you. I'd probably be a very popular person pretty soon with the gift of God to throw all my influence to one of those organizations. I'd probably have a big name among them. I ain't care about my name among them. &gt;&gt; I love them. That's the truth. But I got to be truthful. I I I'd be a hypocrite if I did that. &gt;&gt; Now, I'd be a hypocrite if I stood here because my own son sitting here that was promised to a girl. I said if he never even had the ceremony set over him. No matter if he ever lived with the woman or slept with the girl or whatever it was when he made that vow, he's married. &gt;&gt; Billy Paul or no Billy Paul. That's exactly the truth. He's married. when he made that promise. If it's me, it's the same. &gt;&gt; We've got to be honest. &gt;&gt; If I can't be honest with my boy, I can't be honest with you. If I ain't honest with you, I won't be honest with God. &gt;&gt; And I want you to believe what I tell you to be my honest to goodness opinion. Don't make anything else out of it. Just say it the way I said it. See, I'm going to tell you the truth. I don't talk to y'all like that too often because you're my children. I call you. I've begotten you to Christ through the gospel. And while we're here together, just our own group sitting here, I'll shave you down a little bit. But I want to tell you, when you come to me and ask anything, I'm going to tell you the best that I know how. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If it's in the word, I don't care if it condemns me. I've got many knots should be shaved off of me. Exactly. But when you ask me anything, I'm going to tell you, if I tell you anything, I'm going to tell you the truth. I've always tried to live that way. That's why I want to live and die that way to be honest with anybody. A little girl come to me not long ago. The woman's not here now. Tom Simpson, many of you know him. Tom is a nice fellow. None of his people are here. I think all the people went back unless Fred's still here. I Fred Soffman, I don't know whether he's here yet or not, but I I think they are. But Tom Simpson, he come down from Canada with with Fred and they, you know, brother Fred, our trustee, and brother Tom, many of you know him here. And Tom's a fine man. He's a dandy guy. So is Mrs. Simpson. She'd only listen to what I tell her. She's going to walk again, too. And she's sitting in that wheelchair crippled up. She's going to walk if she'll just do what was said to. And you just watch and see if that isn't true. See now, but she's got to do what she was told to do if she expects to do it. And one of her little girls, sweet little girls, I one of these little bitty things, I take them up on my lap and play with them. They're too big now. They're almost women, 10, 12 years old. And so one of them come to me said, "Brother Bram, I had a dream." And she told me the dream. And she said, "What does that mean?" I said, "Don't know, honey. I'll pray and if the Lord gives it to me, I'll tell you. She said, "All right." Few days, she come back said, "Got that dream?" I said, "No, honey, I haven't. He hasn't revealed it to me." About a week or two later, she come back and said, "Brother Bram, what about that dream?" I said, "I don't know." Well, looked like she was kind of disappointed. I You remember when you ask me anything to tell you and I don't get it from the Lord, I'm disappointed, too. But I ain't going to be a hypocrite or a liar. I'm gonna tell you the truth. If he tells me, I'll tell you. If you don't, I won't. That's all I can do. And I want you to believe me that way. Amen. &gt;&gt; And now I thought I know what the dream meant in my mind. But how did I know? I have to see the thing over again. And not one of you can lay your finger at any time or any place what I ever told you interpretation of a dream in the name of the Lord. But what was exactly that way? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Never have I told you anything in the name of the Lord. But what come to pass too? Just that way. Because I'm It's him and that it ain't my responsibility then. It's him. It's his responsibility. I said, 'Look, Trudy, what if we're going to Arizona and what if if I come told you that when you got out there, thus sayeth the Lord, your little brother's go little Johnny, you want to tease about having his belly open all the time? I say, what if he gets run over on the street? And I say, you know what's going to happen? He's going to get run over on the street and you're coming up to me and and you're going to say, uh, Brother Brandham, uh, go take him to brother Brandham, brother. And then you're going to hunt around. You find me standing on the steps talking to a man with a white suit on. And then um I'm just going to lay my hands up on little Johnny. He's going to come to life again. Run along. Now I said, ' Then you go out west and the first thing you know, one day you hear your mother screaming or daddy screaming and look and little Johnny's been run over. What would you do? See, you believe me? Now I want you to have confidence in me. I ain't going to tell you nothing just presumingly. I'm going to tell you the truth or don't tell you nothing. And I said then you come to me and say, "Oh, little Johnny come to your mother. Oh, little Johnny's run over. He's dead. He's dead. The doctor come pull his eyes back. Check his heart's respiration. He's dead. Take him to the mark. What would you do? You say, "Wait just a minute. Wait just a minute. Take him in my arms. &gt;&gt; Let's start walking." &gt;&gt; Amen. Where you going, Trudy? I don't know. What you got? You got your little dead brother in your arms. You keep walking down the street. People say, "Is that girl crazy?" No, sir. She's got thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; What's going to happen? First thing you know, you say to your father and mother, "Wait, we'll find Brother Brandham. You'll be standing on the steps talking to a man with a white suit on. There he is. Stand right there. Watch what happens. No doubt in your mind. Walk up and say, "Brother Brandom, you know what you told me?" "Yes, Trudy. Johnny, wake up. Jump off and go on down the street." &gt;&gt; But what if I just presumingly tell you some things that I think is right and tell you in that matter, thus sayith the Lord, and it isn't right, and it don't happen. It never comes to pass. Then you'd be scared to death if a little boy wouldn't know where to bring him or not. &gt;&gt; God sent me here to help you. And I want to be a help to you. And no matter if it cuts, hurts, or whatever it is, I got to say it anyhow. But now on the case of marriage and divorce, I've asked you like a brother, hold your peace until you hear from me here. Just go right on as you have live. I'm taking up too much of the time there. We were married 21 years ago. Yeah. Justice of the peace. Sister dear, brother dear. One time salesman's tell me he walked into a church as Christian up in Connecticut or somewhere up there. Great big church, just went in to pray. is it wasn't he was a Pentecostal but he went in there to pray and said when he got in there to knelt down the church to pray he says ride along he's tired kind of homesick salesman he's selling stuff and said he from to factories and he went in there to to make some buys or something then he come by the church and thought go pray the doors open said he went in didn't hear nobody so he knelt down started praying after he's praying there said about an hour that directly he heard some door slam or something he thought custodian or something the church said at Holly notice here from he heard somebody talking. He slipped up there to look look around see what it was custodian. It was a man and woman standing before the altar holding one another's hands said I take you dear to be my lawful wedded wife. See she said I take you dear to be my lawful wedded husband. Well he said this is a strange thing said this Pentecostal. He said this man and woman get married without a preacher. And so he just sat down and waited and after they made their vows and live true to one another only death would separate. They put their arms around one another, kissed each other, turn around, walked out smiling. He said, "Just a moment." He said, "Um, I'm kind of curious. I'm a stranger." Said, "You all get married?" Said, "Yes." Without a preacher? He said, "No." I said, "We've been married 40 years." He said, "We got married right here at this altar 40 years ago, and every year we come back and renew our vows." &gt;&gt; That's a good idea. See, but as far as marriage, when you promise her, she takes your word, you take her word, and God takes both your word. See, but just don't promise that when they cut it in is long is long hair when they cut it in front. Huh? Wait a minute. Let me get this. Yeah. Is long hair when they [Music] &gt;&gt; Well, I maybe they mean this. Uh, is it long hair any longer when they cut it in front? Not any longer. They've cut it all. See? But like the man that had the trousers, cut them off three times, is still too short. What say? What? Say, "Oh, that's what they're talking about." As I teased my little girl, she said the booms I call them, you know, bangs or whatever it is, you know, across the front. You're Well, I imagine those kids that's cutting their hair in front, you maybe your mother could tell you about that. See if she wants you to do that way. I think you look kind of kind of a little bit like a woman looking through the rear view mirror. She passed about 25 years old and want to cut them off in front like that. Look like some little kid. Look on out here where you're going, sis, not where you been. See? And now, but cutting the hair, I I I'll tell you this. I can't I I ain't got no no scripture to say you can cut so much of it and can't do the other. I I ain't got no scripture for that. I I couldn't tell you that. Sister or brother, whatever who it is. I say one thing. I wished now I know my kids has done that too. Rebecca and Sarah, I've seen when they cut their hair off here in front and plat it back here in the back and make these things across front like this. I I don't I'm not holding them. See, Noster, to me, I wish they didn't even put a scissors on their hair at all. But when they got all long hanging down like this and just cut the front of it out of their eyes, little kids made I I wouldn't know where that be. I wouldn't think so. See, but when you get if you can I for you sisters, I just let it the way the Lord made it. See, and uh of course I know women wants to look pretty. That's nature. And that's what they should be. See, they should be that way. And so that's fine. But just don't don't otherwise like this don't look like the world. See, don't pattern at the world. Things wrong. You want to cut off like that. But don't cut your hair now. If you got the braids hanging down or or whatever it is in your hair, you leave it long. Don't cut it like it's go look like the world. If you're listen them little girls, my uncle used to have a little girl up there in New York. She had the prettiest hair. It's kind of dark brown. And she her plants. My mother used to be able to her plats hit down here in the back of her knees. And this little girl had plats like that, too. Her name was Jacqueline. And she had comb part of it down like this and cut it off like this. And I been about 15, 18, 20 years ago. I used to wonder why did she just comb the whole thing back? It looked prettier. And having this like off here like these modern beetles they have nowadays, you know. And oh, I don't believe I'll do it. Anything look like them Beatles that looks like out of the world. Let just leave that alone. Yeah. My husband and I don't uh see a light on the Bible uh the truth like this truth that you preach. He doesn't understand. Should I go with him to churches when I don't believe their teaching? I'm very troubled about this. Yes. If you are a wife to this husband and he don't condemn you, you don't you mustn't condemn him. See, because the husband is sanctified by the wife. See, and I believe if he goes to some denominational church or something like that, he won't you go down there with him. See, if you don't be, you see, there's nothing there can harm you because you're not going to listen to what they're saying anyhow because you done said you you don't believe they're preaching. See, so it ain't going to harm you, but you're just showing respect to your husband. You're yielding yourself to him. And maybe in doing so, you you'll if they teach and do the things down there, you're taught much higher things than that, you'll be salty. He'll see and come to the Lord. I believe I would go ahead. My goodness. Look at what time it is. Um, does uh Zechariah 4 and Revelations 11:3-12 speak of the same being? See Zechariah 4 12-14 and Revelations 11:4. Uh they signed their name to it, brother and sister of the church. Let's see. Zechariah 4. Oh yeah, that's the two olive trees. Yeah, the two olive trees and Revelations 11. Yeah, that's it. Same thing. That's them both. That That's is Moses and Elijah. The two olive trees. Uh pray for our That's a prayer request. Uh, I'm sorry. This I can't read it before. It's about uh family relationships. Yeah, that's more there. I can't read that to the public. They're on private interview anyhow. So, brother Brandon, is it wrong to [Applause] Sunday? work. &gt;&gt; Is it wrong to work on Sunday? I just explained that if the ox is in the ditch, take him out, but don't push him in the ditch just to get him out on Sunday. Brother Brandham, will you preach Eric next Sunday? That's just a question. No, sister, brother, whatever who it is. Uh, these are some this was laying out here must laid them or somebody put them in the package. Uh, brother, this is to you, brother Captain. when you sing or never grow old. &gt;&gt; I must have got in there. I got some of the rest of mixed up. Brother Brandon, um, someone wants to know why you were not, uh, I mean, mentioned in the Bible. I believe you are. Haba 214. Get that, brother. Habca 21:4. Let them read this and study it. Third chapter think name and types of four chapters uh believe I believe is you uh while he's hunting it's Albeca uh 2 1:4 uh uh brother or sister every ask the questions no name that's fine I like to ask those things I know what's on your heart see and then I tell you no see you wouldn't have necessarily have your name in the Bible. See, but you see, as long as you're in the Bible there, as long as you're in Christ, you are in the Bible, you're in him. You see, in the Bible, see, as long as you are in Christ, then you are in the fullness of the Bible. See, you are in your full position when you're in Christ. All understand that. Um, do you have it, brother Neville? What? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh, Habbeca, I haven't read it. This is just put in here, I guess, this morning. uh to Habca 2 1-4. Let's see it. Habca 2. Haba 2 and um 1:4. I will stand up on the watch and set me up on the tower and will watch and see what he will say unto me and what I shall answer I I am when I am reproved. And the Lord answered me and said, "Write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak and not lie. Though it tar, wait for it, because I will surely come, and I will not tarry. Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him, but the just shall live by his faith. Well, now uh I'd imagine this dear person that asked this. You see, it's somebody that loves me or they wouldn't write that. See now I could not say my the Bible doesn't call my my name William Brandham or call your name whoever it is but we are in him anyhow and these now you see familiar places that refer to in the Bible it says certain things see now if you'll watch history repeats itself in the Bible see now let's just give you a scripture for one now I see many of you writing it down now in the third chapter of St. Matthew it said and when God called his son out of Egypt that it might be fulfilled which is spoken out of Egypt I call my son. Now if you got a a Scoffield or any other reference Bible if you follow that reference there that margin reading it'll bring you back to where he called Jacob Israel out of Egypt. See but Jacob was his son that he called out of Egypt. Also Jesus was his son that he called out of Egypt. So see the word of God is never ending. See we identify ourselves in the Bible with different How many remembers my message on identifying yourself with Christian characters? Phoenix, Arizona, where preaching. Yeah, many of us got on the tape. See, identify with Christian character. See, you can identify yourself anywhere you want to in that scripture if you are a Christian. And if you're not a Christian, you can identify yourself in the Bible. See, so I think maybe that would help. I want to get as many of these as can. Brother Bram, some say mercy is over and no one can be saved. Now, is this true? I'm glad I got this one. We watch and pray. We watch the prayer lines and it seems some are still uh finding mercy. Now, that's the first question. You got two. Is mercy over? Don't never think that. Just keep right on doing everything you can until you're taken away. See, we notice in a prayer line somes finds mercy. Sure, mercy's the doors are open. See, I think where you got this uh this thought might lay between See, I don't have time to give each one of these scriptures a right place. You see, each one of these things their right place. The in the prayer line, you find mercy. Certainly, if I know Jesus is coming this afternoon, I'd be doing just the thing I'm doing right now. Okay? Just continuing right on. Mercy is always open. See, and now where I think you get it is about the finishing of the seven church ages and the seven seals being loosed. See, the seven seals, it's manifested. What takes place, how, what has took place. The seventh church age, we're the end of the seventh church age. When I say the end, that doesn't mean it's this very hour, this very minute. You remember the Bible said back in the times of of the Lord Jesus, Paul said, "For the time is at hand." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you realize how long that was in God's time? That was yesterday. My time has been 2,000 years. See, the time is at hand. See, what God calls at hand is not what we call at hand. See, so just keep on believing, keep on praying, keep on uh God's still got mercy open. Just keep blowing into it as fast as you can. God will do the stop and when it's time to stop. See, we thank God for his word tonight and few prayer requests that we want to go to the Lord in prayer for brother Bobby and works, sister Jennifer and the family, Mr. uh Barbara King is there in Minnesota with her brother, brother Bobby, and we want to keep the entire family in prayer. Brother Arch's grandmother Ernestine Parker has a special need. Um I think it was a a health concern there. the Lord would touch her. And then also his cousin's funeral is this Saturday.
