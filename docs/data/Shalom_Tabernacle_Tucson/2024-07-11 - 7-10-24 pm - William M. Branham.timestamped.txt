[12:58] I nice to be with Believers tonight God
[13:00] bless you you can be
[13:04] seated dur message brother per gave us
[13:07] just then from the word of God how true
[13:10] it is that we limit God and time God and
[13:13] he's Eternal we can't do that so tonight
[13:17] we're facing something else now is a a
[13:22] communion three years I waited for a
[13:24] church to come in
[13:26] toan but it's here
[13:29] we're we're here so we thank the Lord he
[13:32] just let us wait till we can appreciate
[13:33] it
[13:34] now there's one thing that I want to say
[13:38] just before we start the communion is
[13:41] this that I believe that we have seen
[13:44] enough in our day that we live in that
[13:47] we ought to really give every all of our
[13:52] being to God we we should really serve
[13:55] God I believe that he has blessed us
[13:58] with the
[14:00] direct answer to scripture as brother
[14:03] Perry gave it a few moments ago that we
[14:06] we are we're at that time we're not
[14:09] blind we we we see that we're here we
[14:12] we've arrived and we also can look
[14:15] around and see that the way that the
[14:18] human mind is leading the people that we
[14:22] we can't stay too much longer we've been
[14:23] a complete insane institution the whole
[14:26] world would be see so we at the end time
[14:30] now as brother Perry ended up there
[14:33] seeing these things are true see that
[14:36] they are true they're not myth they're
[14:38] not just something that we imagine
[14:41] there's something that's been directly
[14:43] given to us by the word of God and
[14:46] manifested publicly before us that we
[14:49] know we are here we we don't know how
[14:52] long now because again we come back to a
[14:55] watch you see what time it is but we are
[14:59] we know we we've here we at the time
[15:00] whether God's time I'd imagine someone
[15:03] give a little analysis one time that
[15:05] said that if God put up with him U
[15:09] according if he was a lot time one 1,000
[15:13] years is just one day so if a man lived
[15:17] 70 years old it just be a few minutes of
[15:19] God's
[15:20] time or it said if it' be 40 years that
[15:23] wouldn't even meantime hard get B di see
[15:26] just that's how quick it is the whole
[15:28] thing if it be lotted time which he
[15:30] doesn't have any time so he's just he
[15:33] Eternal I believe it was Sarah back I
[15:36] know Joseph the other night said to me
[15:37] brother Perry said daddy where when did
[15:41] God come on the scene where did he come
[15:43] from see he had to have a beginning
[15:46] didn't he didn't he have to start I said
[15:48] no anything that has a beginning has an
[15:50] end right but it's that which had not a
[15:53] beginning has no end of course he's 10
[15:55] years old that was kind of a real
[15:57] mouthful for him see that how could he
[15:59] receive that knowing that something
[16:01] never did begin not only to him it is to
[16:05] me see it's a great big dose for me how
[16:10] did it ever begin now we're fixing to
[16:13] observe something here that's really
[16:16] sacred I was called on a few days ago to
[16:20] some very fine Christian gentleman that
[16:24] uh that's never had this and he
[16:27] understood that we taken communion
[16:30] literally they take it what they call
[16:32] spiritual communion and U Which is far
[16:37] as communion I'd say all right because
[16:39] communicate is to talk to see and the
[16:42] brother gave me this scripture said
[16:44] brother BR don't you think now reason
[16:46] I'm saying this is
[16:48] sorry that reason I'm saying this so
[16:51] that you would understand what you're
[16:52] doing you don't if you walking in ain't
[16:55] blindly you don't know what you're doing
[16:57] you can't have even confidence
[16:59] if you don't know what you're doing but
[17:01] you must understand what you are doing
[17:05] and why you're doing it he said now if
[17:08] we take the word of God isn't that God
[17:12] that we're taking I said exactly right
[17:14] sir it's true but we read here that they
[17:18] actually Paul taught taking the literal
[17:22] Lord supper this do in remembrance of me
[17:25] said Jesus as often as you take it in
[17:27] remembrance of me you show forth the
[17:28] Lord's death till he come see now we are
[17:31] to take it we understand that St Paul
[17:34] who
