[3:59] to the church
[4:01] formal by the name ending with h m the
[4:11] form a b e a b r a h a m h look

[4:29] where he's ministering
[4:31] to church natural Church natural was
[4:35] lock and solom amen and when this fellow
[4:39] went down there and preached and blinded
[4:43] him by the gospel but there was one who
[4:46] stayed with Abraham amen and Abraham

[5:21] Abraham that wasn't in in Sodom to begin
[5:25] with amen amen and watch what he did he
[5:28] never done no preaching like they
[5:31] did he taught them but then they done a
[5:34] sign before
[5:36] him he done the Messiah
[5:39] sign he had his back turned to the
[5:42] tent and he said
[5:45] Abraham I remember his actual name a few
[5:48] days before that was
[5:50] Abram but it says
[5:52] Abraham where is your wife s a r a a few
[5:56] days before that was called s a r r a
[6:00] amen Abraham said she's in the tent
[6:04] behind
[6:05] you amen amen and he said Abraham I
[6:10] there's your personal
[6:11] pronoun I am going to visit you
[6:14] according to the promise that have made
[6:16] you amen you see who it was a man with
[6:19] dust on his cloes eating the meat of a
[6:22] calf and drinking the milk from the toow
[6:24] and eating
[6:26] cornbread God Elohim Amen manifested in
[6:32] flesh Hallelujah promised in the last
[6:35] days am to manifest himself in flesh
[6:40] again Hallelujah notice Abraham where is
[6:45] your wife Sarah she's in the tent behind
[6:47] you said I'm going to visit you and the
[6:49] lady of course being 100 years old she
[6:51] kind of laughed up her
[6:54] sleeve back in the tent now behind the
[6:56] curtains in the tent she said me and old
[7:00] woman well it ceased to be with them the
[7:02] husband and wife for years you know cuz
[7:04] he was 100 years old and and she was 90
[7:07] said that will never
[7:09] happen and he said why did she
[7:13] laugh with his back turned to the
[7:16] tent why did she laugh saying how can
[7:19] these things
[7:20] be see amen he showed him a sign
[7:25] amen now he promises that this will
[7:28] repeat at the end
[7:30] times
[7:32] again the two men went down there and
[7:34] preached the word and told them to get
[7:35] out of there the place is going to burn
[7:37] up and so forth and it did and lock
[7:40] staggered out the church
[7:43] natural down in
[7:45] sin in the mar but yet struggling along
[7:49] in their
[7:50] organizational programs but the
[7:54] bride that one man never went to them he
[7:58] went only and and call the bride
[8:01] [Music]
[8:03] type now we're in the last
[8:05] days now notice you said there are God
[8:08] manifested In the Flesh Jesus said
[8:11] himself how do you condemn me said isn't
[8:14] it written in your Bible your laws that
[8:18] they the prophets who the word of God
[8:21] came to Jesus said the word came to the
[8:24] prophets because he was scriptural in
[8:26] all things he said now the word of God
[8:28] says that the word came to the prophets
[8:31] and you call them
[8:34] gods for the word of God came to him so
[8:37] then how you going to condemn me when I
[8:38] say I'm the Son of
[8:39] God WR all there you are see how where
[8:45] we at we're at the end time now listen
[8:49] real close
[8:51] now now we find out that there would be
[8:56] wars and rumors of wars and now we see
[9:00] that the fig trees put forth its
[9:03] buds and the other trees put forth their
[9:06] buds methodists Baptists Presbyterians
[9:09] and all put forth their buds a great
[9:12] revival going on now I believe that
[9:16] God's Gathering the bride for that last
[9:19] hour there you
[9:22] left oh my I notice let us now consider
[9:28] what John saw then of these things what
[9:31] he saw a red horse and his rider Goes
[9:35] Forth power given to him to slay with a
[9:39] great
[9:41] sword now here's my revelation of it
[9:46] this is Satan again amen it's the devil
[9:51] again in another Farm amen now we know
[9:55] that that um seals pertain to it said
[9:59] the other night and trumpets pertain to
[10:01] to to to Civil Wars you see amongst the
[10:04] people among nations but you find out
[10:08] here that this man has a sword so it
[10:10] pertains to church political
[10:13] war you might not think that but just
[10:16] watch it a minute just few minutes amen
[10:20] notice the change of color of these
[10:23] horses same
[10:25] Rider amen change of color of hor
[10:29] and a horse is a beast and the Beast in
[10:32] the Bible and her symbol represents a
[10:35] power the same system riding on another
[10:39] color
[10:42] power from the innocent white to a
[10:45] bloody
[10:47] red watch him now he's
[10:50] coming when he first started he was just
[10:56] well he's just a little Doctrine in the
[10:58] in the called the nicoladis
[11:00] of course it wouldn't slay anything
[11:04] that's Revelations 2:6 if you want to
[11:05] put it down he wouldn't slay anything
[11:07] it's just a Doctrine it's a spirit
[11:09] amongst the people now he would slay
[11:11] nothing oh he was so innocent R white
[11:14] well you know we could have a great
[11:15] worldwide church we could call it the
[11:19] universal church they still do all right
[11:22] see now we could have or it's perfectly
[11:26] innocent and um or it's so innocent it's
[11:29] just a group of man we'll all get
[11:32] together for Fellowship see it's very
[11:34] innocent it's white the white horse was
[11:36] see now so the um uh dignitaries and the
[11:41] better dressed and the educated you know
[11:43] kind of like birds of a feather you know
[11:45] we we kind of get things together uh
[11:48] poor Bunch why they want to stumble
[11:50] along well all right but we we'll get a
[11:52] better class coming to our church if we
[11:55] can just get ourselves pulled off out
[11:56] here we'll we'll be a we'll be a bunch
[11:59] of Masons or so forth you know we we
[12:01] just have the things fixed up or
[12:03] oddfellas as they are and so then not
[12:06] the odd fell LOD now but you know what I
[12:07] mean so it's odd to the real
[12:11] believer now but otherwise words we want
[12:13] a little group a little Syndicate we can
[12:16] call her own it's just a Doctrine very
[12:18] innocent Brethren why we have nothing
[12:20] against you people certainly not you're
[12:22] all right but you know we feel that um
[12:25] if we have business and we we'd be
[12:28] better off just had ourselves together
[12:30] see amen it finally went right on down
[12:33] to hen yes sir get together but when
[12:36] this awful deceiving Spirit oh man
[12:41] incarnated in
[12:44] incarnate spirit this Doctrine Spirit
[12:48] became
[12:50] incarnated to take the place of Christ
[12:54] into a
[12:55] man it must be worshiped then turned to
[12:58] be a worship like Christ in other words
[13:02] up over the Vatican I've been right
[13:06] there it's wrote vicarious ofili
[13:09] adilia and it's wrote in Roman numerals
[13:13] now you just draw a line at the bottom
[13:15] of those nor Roman
[13:17] numerals and it means instead of Son of
[13:21] God in other words he's a viker you know
[13:24] what a viker is just take the place of
[13:27] something he is the biker instead of the
[13:31] Son of God Amen and the Bible said let
[13:36] him that has a gift of wisdom count the
[13:39] numbers of the Beast am for it's a
[13:44] number of a man and his number is
[13:48] 666 now you take viar filad dilia and
[13:52] draw a line Roman numbers of B for five
[13:55] I for one and add it up and see if you
[13:58] haven't got six
[14:00] 66 the Bible said he would be sitting in
[14:03] the temple of God worship like God when
[14:05] that little
[14:07] Doctrine
[14:08] become a incarnate it become a
[14:13] biker instead of the Son of God see oh
[14:17] my that awful deceiving Spirit if you
[14:20] want to read that read in 2
[14:21] Thessalonians 2:3 you can see where it's
[14:24] at and of course you remember Satan is
[14:29] the head of all political power of every
[14:34] nation how many knows
[14:37] that you want to put it down Matthew
[14:40] 4:8 Satan took Jesus up to a high
[14:44] mountain and he showed him all the
[14:46] kingdoms of the world that ever was or
[14:48] ever would be Amen in a moment of time
[14:51] amen talk about a
[14:53] person he said I'll give them to you
[14:57] amen if you'll worship me
[14:59] and Jesus knew that he was going to fall
[15:02] air to him that's what they say well you
[15:05] bunch of poor Holy Rollers well we get
[15:08] the world Amen the meat shall inherit
[15:11] the earth what Jesus said see see notice
[15:16] Jesus knowed fall air to him so he said
[15:19] get thee hyan it's written right back
[15:22] with the scripture again see thou shall
[15:23] Worship the Lord and him only see now
[15:27] now when
[15:30] when he as his head demon incarnate in
[15:34] this super religious man as the Bible
[15:38] predicts then he unites his church and
[15:43] state both of his own powers unite
[15:49] together see when the Antichrist Spirit
[15:52] went forth it was a spirit then it
[15:54] become what it become then I watch this
[15:58] seal
[16:00] when the spirit went forth it was
[16:02] Antichrist against the teaching of
[16:04] Christ all right the next thing did what
[16:07] Christ set out for his church to do it
[16:08] was against saying that all don't it
[16:09] don't mean that it don't mean it that
[16:12] was for somebody else that that's back
[16:13] in the 100 years ago back under that
[16:16] that ain't for us see that's see anti
[16:19] against then it become now the riter
[16:21] went out he he didn't have no Crown but
[16:24] he was given one that white horse he had
[16:27] a boat no arir see so then when he went
[16:30] forth then after while he was given a
[16:32] crown because you can't put a crown on a
[16:34] spirit's head but when this Spirit
[16:36] become incarnate the second work of his
[16:39] of his dispensation of his
[16:42] myy the second work he become a crowned
[16:46] false prophet to the working of the
[16:50] Antichrist spirit amen now we SE now now
[16:56] now he becomes that when he takes that
[16:59] then he uh is already Satan controls the
[17:05] political powers of the world now he
[17:08] gets into a place that he's going to
[17:10] make a universal church
[17:12] power taking religious power and do you
[17:17] not understand my brothers that in when
[17:20] this nation appears in the 13th chapter
[17:24] of
[17:25] Revelations this little animal raised up
[17:28] like a lamb and it's got two
[17:32] horns civil and ecclesiastical
[17:35] power but he done the same thing the
[17:37] Beast did before
[17:41] him it's
[17:43] strange America is number 13 and a woman
[17:48] and strange that appears even the 13th
[17:50] chapter of revelation we start out with
[17:52] 13 stripes in the Flag 13 stars
[17:55] everything's 13 13 13 13 all the way
[17:57] down everything's woman woman woman all
[17:59] way down and it finally end up on
[18:02] predicted a woman will control her
[18:05] remember that's 30 years ago I said it
[18:07] and and and the the seven things that I
[18:10] predicted five of them done come to pass
[18:12] and they got the man right there now to
[18:13] bring her
[18:14] in and you voted into your
[18:19] politics all right so much to say you
[18:22] can't hardly get to where you want to
[18:24] get to notice now I won't keep you a
[18:27] little bit longer if I have to car
[18:28] tomorrow night look notice when Satan
[18:32] now everybody that realizes that Satan
[18:36] controls all political powers of the
[18:39] world he said so Matthew the 4th chapter
[18:43] you get it in the eth verse all the
[18:45] kingdoms belong to him amen that's the
[18:48] reason they fight War kill I remember
[18:51] isn't that strange they was given this
[18:53] sword to kill one
[18:56] another amen
[18:59] notice now now when he did that he did
[19:03] not have the ecclesiastical power
[19:06] yet but he started in with a demon of a
[19:10] false teaching and that teaching become
[19:13] a doctrine that Doctrine become
[19:16] incarnate in a false prophet and then he
[19:21] went just to the right place he never
[19:23] went to Israel now he went to Rome now
[19:27] see of Rome the Council was held and
[19:30] they elected a head Bishop amen and then
[19:35] by doing this they United church and
[19:38] state
[19:40] together then he Dred his
[19:43] bowl he got off his White Horse he got
[19:47] on his red horse or he can kill anybody
[19:51] that don't agree with
[19:53] him there's your
[19:55] [Music]
[19:56] seal same
[19:58] B watch him right on into eternity H
[20:01] with it see unites both his powers
[20:05] together the same thing they're trying
[20:08] to do right now that's right same thing
[20:11] today and a strange thing maybe don't
[20:14] understand it but today from a Baptist
[20:17] group in Louisville you heard it on the
[20:18] radio a speaker raised up and you how
[20:21] many heard it see are here you are they
[20:24] want and ask in the church now that we
[20:27] don't really have to um all just kind of
[20:29] Jar the Catholic church but we have to
[20:31] kind of fellowship with them get it and
[20:33] the same time that going on in Lille
[20:35] over here God's unfolding the seals to
[20:38] his people to show don't do
[20:41] [Applause]
[20:41] [Music]
[20:45] it see them both working
[20:48] together remember the crow and Dove sat
[20:51] on the same Roost
[20:55] B yes remember
[20:58] now we find out he unites his power then
[21:02] when he become both state and
[21:05] church ecclesiastical then what are you
[21:08] going to do he forms his own
[21:13] religion and now he can do whatever he
[21:15] wants to then he has the right to put
[21:18] the death whosoever will not agree with
[21:21] him that's exactly what he did too amen
[21:25] and he did that just exactly and what he
[21:29] he did it to the true Saints of the
[21:32] Living God who kept the word and
[21:34] wouldn't agree with him on his dogmas he
[21:36] put him to death amen now brother
[21:39] leel and you teachers here of the NAIA
[21:43] age in the early church I don't know
[21:46] where you read this or not if you want
[21:48] to read it you get in Smucker's glorious
[21:52] reformation and you find it that when St
[21:55] Augustine of Hippo
[21:59] become a priest under the Roman Church
[22:03] had the opportunity to one time the Holy
[22:06] Spirit tried to come on him and he
[22:09] rejected it how many knows that as a
[22:13] teacher so he rejected the Holy Spirit
[22:16] that's exactly what a type of the
[22:18] Protestant church today amen that's
[22:21] rejected the Holy Ghost he went back
[22:24] down to hippo and he was the very one
[22:26] that signed that that paper that had the
[22:29] Revelation from God that it was all
[22:32] right and pleasing God to put every
[22:35] person to death that didn't believe with
[22:37] the Roman Catholic
[22:56] Church

[1:05:57] you sing and
[1:05:59] so um but we're here this morning to

[1:06:08] something for us amen do you believe
[1:06:10] that amen God bless you we like to go
[1:06:13] right into our Bibles and I will ask you
[1:06:17] to stand and turn in the
[1:06:19] scripture uh a very simple topic that we
[1:06:23] had
[1:06:24] started last week's Sunday in Proverbs
[1:06:27] chapter
[1:06:42] 18 we can turn there
[1:06:53] quickly
[1:06:55] talking about our words and the words
[1:06:57] that we
[1:07:12] use in
[1:07:14] verse number
[1:07:19] 21 death and life are in the power of
[1:07:23] the tongue
[1:07:25] and they that love it shall eat the
[1:07:27] fruit
[1:07:28] thereof so the scripture is
[1:07:32] speaking
[1:07:34] of the power that is in our
[1:07:37] tongue and how that he gives a whole
[1:07:40] gamut of a lifespan death and life
[1:07:43] that's saying a lot there uh talking
[1:07:46] about the power that is in our tongue
[1:07:48] we'll take one more
[1:07:50] scripture found in
[1:07:55] James chapter 3 verse number
[1:08:16] 8 man don't you just love the
[1:08:19] Lord
[1:08:22] nice
[1:08:24] ask God to help
[1:08:32] us James chapter 3 speaking again about
[1:08:36] our tongue
[1:08:39] verse number eight is what we'll take
[1:08:42] but the tongue can no man tame it is an
[1:08:46] unruly evil full of deadly
[1:08:50] poison therewith bless we God even the
[1:08:53] father and therewith curse We Men which
[1:08:56] are made after the similitude of God out
[1:08:59] of the same mouth proceeded blessings
[1:09:02] and cursings my brethren these things
[1:09:05] ought not so to be that the fountain
[1:09:09] send forth the same place Sweet Water
[1:09:12] and bitter can the Fig Tree my brethren
[1:09:14] bear Olive berries either a Vine figs so
[1:09:19] can no Fountain both yield salt water
[1:09:22] and fresh who is a wise man and endued
[1:09:25] with knowledge among you let him show
[1:09:29] out of good out of a good conversation
[1:09:31] his works with meekness of wisdom but if
[1:09:35] you have bitter enviance and strife in
[1:09:37] your hearts Glory not and lie not
[1:09:40] against the truth so this um this tongue
[1:09:47] the the small member of your body the
[1:09:50] tongue the tongue that that can set the
[1:09:55] course of life or death by our simple
[1:09:59] words and so let us pray father we ask
[1:10:02] your blessings upon us may you speak to
[1:10:05] our hearts we pray in Jesus name amen
[1:10:09] amen God bless you you may you may be
[1:10:13] seated all right praise the Lord just
[1:10:16] have to bear with me just for a
[1:10:20] moment as we think
[1:10:22] of where our words are and how the songs
[1:10:26] that we sing are just words our prayers
[1:10:30] are just words Galatians chapter 6 tells
[1:10:34] us that we'll reap what we sow and the
[1:10:37] Bible clearly tells us that death in
[1:10:39] life lay in the power of the tongue this
[1:10:43] isn't even talking about the difference
[1:10:45] between right or wrong um it has nothing
[1:10:50] to do even with being a Christian it
[1:10:53] it's it's a law that whatever seed is
[1:10:56] planted it will produce after its kind
[1:11:00] Satan knows this and he knew this in the
[1:11:02] garden and he needed a host in order to
[1:11:06] speak and to do and to manifest his seed
[1:11:10] and so I want us to look at this uh
[1:11:12] little message this morning about our
[1:11:14] words being seeds and that what we say
[1:11:18] will
[1:11:19] manifest uh whether it's positive or
[1:11:22] negative and this is a principle it's
[1:11:26] not just you know one denomination or
[1:11:29] the next it's a principle that you reap
[1:11:34] what you sow and these principles Satan
[1:11:38] knows it business people know it
[1:11:41] positive thinkers know it book writers
[1:11:44] know it everybody knows this and um we
[1:11:49] can use that and it's it is being used
[1:11:52] by us even even as we sit here this
[1:11:56] morning I asked you on Sunday night and
[1:11:59] I encouraged the church after we spoke
[1:12:01] on that Sunday morning to go plant a
[1:12:04] garden and I told you to start planting
[1:12:06] a garden with the words that you speak
[1:12:09] there's those seeds you blant a big
[1:12:11] Garden or a little one but start
[1:12:13] planting something and so don't think
[1:12:17] that it's just uh just your words don't
[1:12:19] mean anything they absolutely mean
[1:12:21] something and um we can really do damage
[1:12:26] to people with our words and we can
[1:12:28] actually build people up with our words
[1:12:32] and this simple thought this simple
[1:12:36] principle I brought it out in this
[1:12:38] sinner prayer I call it the sinner's
[1:12:40] prayer as brother bandam is leading some
[1:12:43] people to Christ in his message in the
[1:12:45] in the life story and I want to read it
[1:12:47] for you again it's in
[1:12:49] 1952 paragraph 165 he says now will all
[1:12:53] your heads bow Let The Sinner say this
[1:12:56] so he's having the congregation the
[1:12:58] people that's coming to Christ to repeat
[1:13:01] these words and I want you to think
[1:13:02] about these words you oldtimers you
[1:13:05] saints that have been traveling a long
[1:13:06] time or short while or whatever stage of
[1:13:09] the journey you are these words resonate
[1:13:13] to the believer for It Is What Makes Us
[1:13:16] Believers it's our
[1:13:18] confession almighty God the people
[1:13:21] repeat this prayer after brother banam
[1:13:24] now I now come to thee as a sinner
[1:13:27] accepting Jesus Christ thy son as my
[1:13:29] savior I believe in you God and I
[1:13:32] believe that you sent Jesus to take my
[1:13:35] place at Calvary in that that I could
[1:13:38] not do for myself being a sinner I
[1:13:41] accept what you did for me I believe
[1:13:43] that in his death you was pleased to
[1:13:46] receive Me by his
[1:13:49] obedience therefore Lord nothing in my
[1:13:52] arms I bring none of my righteousness
[1:13:56] nothing that I can do only I believe
[1:13:59] your word and I accept it into my heart
[1:14:04] now receive me oh lord for I am sincere
[1:14:08] and from this day hence I will be your
[1:14:12] servant and in the hour of my death may
[1:14:15] Jesus Christ come down through the
[1:14:17] valley of the shadow of death and lift
[1:14:20] up the way and light up the way and bear
[1:14:24] my weary soul to a Haven of Rest until
[1:14:29] that time I will search after thee and
[1:14:33] seek for the Holy Spirit until thou has
[1:14:36] has give it to me and I'll make my life
[1:14:39] the best of my knowledge a pattern or a
[1:14:43] salt to the unbeliever that they might
[1:14:46] see my work by my faith and come to you
[1:14:50] receive me oh God In The Name of Jesus
[1:14:52] Christ
[1:14:53] now while your heads are bowed simple
[1:14:55] prayer just a few words if you were
[1:14:58] timing that probably a minute or two
[1:15:01] just words just simple words but at the
[1:15:04] beginning of those words we're dealing
[1:15:06] with the sinner at the end of those
[1:15:09] words we're dealing with the saint
[1:15:11] that's right somebody who's saved yes
[1:15:14] sir I mean that's a world of difference
[1:15:17] life and death lay in the power of the
[1:15:22] tongue and the words that we speak are
[1:15:26] very very important to God a negative
[1:15:29] attitude a negative atmosphere negative
[1:15:33] words should not be the host of a
[1:15:36] Believer a Believer speaks
[1:15:41] life a Believer speaks the word of God
[1:15:46] for that is what builds us up and that
[1:15:49] is also called a confession amen
[1:15:53] confession isn't just in the Catholic
[1:15:56] church where you did wrong and you have
[1:15:57] to make a confession okay fess up fess
[1:15:59] up no a confession means to say the same
[1:16:03] thing that's what it means to confess it
[1:16:05] means to say the same thing say what the
[1:16:10] word says amen now the prophet of God
[1:16:15] takes an
[1:16:17] example with the prophet
[1:16:21] Moses and
[1:16:24] um in the message why Christ speak he he
[1:16:28] he preached this uh twice and he deals
[1:16:32] with this Moses crying to to the Lord
[1:16:37] after God had
[1:16:39] already had already given him the
[1:16:41] Declaration to go forward he had already
[1:16:45] called him he had already Vindicated him
[1:16:49] and it looked like every time he got
[1:16:51] into problems or troubles he started
[1:16:53] calling on God to help him and brother
[1:16:56] random says it looked like God got
[1:16:58] frustrated with him now so he preached
[1:16:59] this message twice I think there's a
[1:17:01] five-year Gap in between he preached it
[1:17:04] in Cornersville Indiana why Christ speak
[1:17:07] and he had a secondary subject of that
[1:17:10] on God's on your attitude towards God's
[1:17:12] servants and then few years later 62 63
[1:17:15] he preaches a 2-hour message in the
[1:17:17] Tabernacle why Christ speak same text a
[1:17:22] little bit different Direction they're
[1:17:23] all the word of the Lord but in this
[1:17:26] message why Christ speak one of the
[1:17:29] first and tremendous points that brother
[1:17:32] random makes is that there is no retreat
[1:17:36] in God Amen that's what he there's no
[1:17:39] turning back now we change our minds and
[1:17:44] things happen that we you know re we
[1:17:47] revisit our commitment but not God when
[1:17:50] God declares when God Proclaim claims
[1:17:53] when God thus sayeth the Lord that is
[1:17:57] his word it's very deliberate it said on
[1:18:01] purpose it's said with an authority it's
[1:18:04] said so that it can be heard and when
[1:18:07] it's heard it's meant to be spoke again
[1:18:11] for the hearer this is why it's recorded
[1:18:14] amen this is why God's word is recorded
[1:18:17] it's recorded so that it can be read
[1:18:20] it's read so that it can be SP spoken
[1:18:23] again and every time you speak the word
[1:18:26] of the Lord it brings that word back to
[1:18:28] life again it makes the book come open
[1:18:32] again your Bible is a closed book on
[1:18:35] your shelf but open it up one time even
[1:18:38] if it's a Bible app open up the app and
[1:18:41] begin to read what the words of say it
[1:18:45] out
[1:18:45] loud Faith cometh by what hearing what
[1:18:51] the news
[1:18:53] the 5:00 news negative attitude Faith
[1:18:57] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:19:01] word of the Lord even if it's you
[1:19:03] hearing
[1:19:05] yourself Faith cometh by hearing and the
[1:19:09] believer walks by
[1:19:11] what what ain't looking at the weather
[1:19:15] believer walks by faith lives by faith
[1:19:19] declares God's word by faith
[1:19:23] and that's how we live that's another
[1:19:26] realm in a negative Society that's
[1:19:29] another atmosphere in a negative friends
[1:19:32] or Atmos or family but we declare the
[1:19:36] word of the Lord and I ask the
[1:19:38] church to plant a
[1:19:41] garden plant a garden of with the seeds
[1:19:46] of God's word go through them and find a
[1:19:50] few of them and begin to plant a garden
[1:19:52] plant a Tre tree or two a shade tree
[1:19:56] then over on the other side plant a
[1:19:57] fruit tree then over there plant some
[1:20:00] other kind of little Edibles plant some
[1:20:03] beautiful flowers some that smell good
[1:20:07] some that make you appreciate God in his
[1:20:09] name plant a garden doesn't matter what
[1:20:12] color what kind as long as there's seeds
[1:20:15] from God's word go plant a garden and I
[1:20:18] wonder how many Saints did
[1:20:20] that I wonder how many Saints did that
[1:20:23] all right God bless you so this death
[1:20:28] and life lays in the power of the tongue
[1:20:33] and brother random says this here in all
[1:20:35] walks of life you'll find that you
[1:20:38] usually reap just as you sow so let's do
[1:20:41] good talk good be kind and people talk
[1:20:47] about us will say good things and kind
[1:20:51] things and good things will come our way
[1:20:55] if we'll give them out how many want
[1:20:58] good things to come your way but we want
[1:21:00] it first come our way first we don't
[1:21:03] want to start it when they say bad
[1:21:06] things about us or shade for things
[1:21:09] about us or cross things about us what
[1:21:12] are we to do huh say good things about
[1:21:16] them how easy is that it's
[1:21:21] not it's hard
[1:21:23] hard come on
[1:21:25] somebody uh but we'll say good things
[1:21:29] and
[1:21:30] then and then good things will come our
[1:21:32] way if we give them out Paul's speaking
[1:21:35] here of the Valley of the shadow of
[1:21:37] death this is in the message law
[1:21:42] 1955 could never make the worshipper
[1:21:45] perfect then he goes on to show what
[1:21:47] Perfection is now it's a strange thing
[1:21:49] that is so much thought of people they
[1:21:51] say well I'm
[1:21:54] weak my faith is not very much I'm not a
[1:21:58] very good Christian that's just what the
[1:22:01] devil wants you to say that's it you're
[1:22:03] just talking his language you say well I
[1:22:06] was just being humble no that's what the
[1:22:08] devil wants you to
[1:22:09] say if you're a Christian Proclaim that
[1:22:14] if you made a mistake Proclaim that God
[1:22:17] is your savior and he forgives you if
[1:22:21] you would repent of your sin
[1:22:23] he's faithful and he's just to forgive
[1:22:26] you of your sins if you done wrong
[1:22:29] you'll pay for your wrong but you
[1:22:31] confess those wrongs and he's faithful
[1:22:33] and just to lift you back up to that
[1:22:36] place that you're supposed to be you're
[1:22:38] not supposed to go around talking about
[1:22:39] how bad you are or how bad you feel or
[1:22:44] how you're just a horrible Christian
[1:22:46] that's what the devil wants you to say
[1:22:48] you start talking like that it's an
[1:22:50] atmosphere and the devil's come around
[1:22:53] and they'll tell you no say it like this
[1:22:55] and they'll encourage you of more
[1:22:57] negative things to say but a Believer
[1:23:00] declares the word of the lord it's just
[1:23:03] what the devil wants you to say you're
[1:23:04] just talking his language right then see
[1:23:07] you mustn't never say that don't never
[1:23:10] let your testimony be negative let it be
[1:23:15] positive all the time look at your
[1:23:17] neighbor and say let it be positive all
[1:23:18] the
[1:23:19] time all the time
[1:23:24] right all right did you wake them up did
[1:23:28] you wake your neighbor up when you did
[1:23:30] that okay we'll do it one more time all
[1:23:33] right touch your neighbor I I didn't
[1:23:36] like being in that kind of church touch
[1:23:38] your neighbor all through this Earth tap
[1:23:40] your neighbor and tell them this I was
[1:23:42] Raising that kind of
[1:23:44] church and here I'm now repeating that
[1:23:48] but touch with your neighbor and just
[1:23:49] look at
[1:23:50] him all right God bless
[1:23:55] you oh God bless you all right
[1:23:59] so there is no retreating
[1:24:03] God and there are mistakes that we make
[1:24:07] when Once the word has been
[1:24:10] declared the spirit the word of God has
[1:24:13] one
[1:24:14] message and God wants us to Clare that
[1:24:17] message so let's go back and look at the
[1:24:21] author the authority that was given to a
[1:24:23] man before we read a couple quotes on
[1:24:26] that we share with you the uh scriptures
[1:24:31] some of the scriptures in Matthew
[1:24:33] chapter 8 verse
[1:24:36] 6 and 10 it says this is the man that's
[1:24:40] calling on God to come and heal his
[1:24:45] daughter he heal his
[1:24:46] servant and it says and saying Lord my
[1:24:49] servant layeth at home sick of py griev
[1:24:52] previously tormented and Jesus saith
[1:24:54] unto him I will come and heal him the
[1:24:58] Centurion asked and said Lord I'm not
[1:25:01] worthy that thou should come under my
[1:25:03] roof but speak the word only and my
[1:25:07] servant shall be healed for I am a man
[1:25:10] under
[1:25:12] Authority having soldiers under me and I
[1:25:16] say to this man go he goeth and to
[1:25:18] another come and he cometh and to my
[1:25:21] servant do this and he doeth it doeth it
[1:25:25] when Jesus heard it he
[1:25:29] Marvel now he's not making this up this
[1:25:32] struck him this did something to him
[1:25:35] like that woman that touched His Garment
[1:25:37] remember that this is this is a gentile
[1:25:40] now a man who doesn't know all the
[1:25:43] principles maybe of of the laws of Moses
[1:25:47] maybe he couldn't memorize what the the
[1:25:50] what the Old Testament uh uh uh uh uh
[1:25:53] laws and the and all of the precepts of
[1:25:56] Moses but he he simply knew the order of
[1:26:01] authority that if Authority has been
[1:26:03] given unto you then that Authority you
[1:26:07] know we're both men we both eat the same
[1:26:09] we breathe the same but one has the
[1:26:11] authority and one does not and the man
[1:26:14] that has the authority he's the boss
[1:26:17] he's the CEO he's the chief uh whatever
[1:26:20] he is and he has others under him and
[1:26:23] it's very simple principle it's very
[1:26:25] simple it's nothing to do with being a
[1:26:27] Christian not how holy you are how saved
[1:26:30] you are who you work for who is your
[1:26:32] boss and what did the boss tell you to
[1:26:35] do simple right simple principle and he
[1:26:39] says
[1:26:41] Lord you know Jesus said he'll come to
[1:26:43] your house how many Believers would need
[1:26:47] that so needy amen Lord take your time
[1:26:51] and come to my house and the Lord said
[1:26:54] I'll
[1:26:54] come I'll come to your house and the
[1:26:57] service says no wait wait wait you ain't
[1:26:59] got to come to my house what kind of
[1:27:02] believer is
[1:27:03] that it's a believer that Jesus marveled
[1:27:07] at it he stood back and he says wow what
[1:27:12] kind of faith is
[1:27:16] this
[1:27:18] and
[1:27:20] yeah verely I said to you I have not
[1:27:24] found so great faith no not in Israel so
[1:27:30] we see that this man
[1:27:33] understood what this Authority
[1:27:36] was Mark chap
[1:27:39] 13:33 says take heed watch and pray for
[1:27:43] you know not when the time is for the
[1:27:46] son of man is a man taking a far Journey
[1:27:49] who left his house and who gave gave
[1:27:53] authority he gave this authority to his
[1:27:56] servants that's Mark 13:33 if you want
[1:27:59] to write it down or just take a note of
[1:28:02] it and to every man his work and
[1:28:04] commanded the porter to watch watch ye
[1:28:07] therefore for you know not when the
[1:28:10] Master of the House cometh at evening or
[1:28:13] midnight crowing or in the morning
[1:28:16] L coming suddenly he find you sleeping
[1:28:20] and what I say unto you I say unto all
[1:28:22] all watch so this is a parable again our
[1:28:26] Lord is giving this Parable to take heed
[1:28:29] for the son of man is a man taking a far
[1:28:32] Journey who Le leaves his house and gave
[1:28:37] authority to his servants so the Lord
[1:28:40] gives this authority to his servants all
[1:28:45] right we see this Authority given also
[1:28:49] in second Timothy chapter 2 this is the
[1:28:52] Apostle Paul commissioning Timothy and
[1:28:56] also in Titus he gives them instructions
[1:28:59] and look at how he says this in verse
[1:29:01] one thou therefore my son be strong in
[1:29:04] the grace that is in Christ Jesus and
[1:29:07] the things that thou has heard of me
[1:29:09] among many witnesses the same commit
[1:29:13] thou to Faithful Men so I'm doing it you
[1:29:17] see me doing it now now I'm giving it to
[1:29:21] you now go committed to Faithful Men so
[1:29:25] what is that he's given them the
[1:29:26] authority to do what Paul was doing
[1:29:30] because God was God had commissioned
[1:29:32] Paul we know that he's God's messenger
[1:29:35] we know that Timothy what do you think
[1:29:37] Titus yes what did Paul say Paul told us
[1:29:40] to go and find Faithful
[1:29:42] Men and what you see me do among many
[1:29:45] witnesses the same commit thou to
[1:29:47] Faithful Men Who Shall be able to do
[1:29:50] what
[1:29:55] we make it easy for you if you didn't
[1:29:57] bring your Bible we got it up there on
[1:30:00] the screen the things that thou has
[1:30:02] heard of me among many witnesses the
[1:30:04] same commit thou to Faithful Men Who
[1:30:06] should be able to do what teach others
[1:30:10] so I'm committing it to you you're
[1:30:12] committing it to them and they're going
[1:30:13] to commit it to others the same
[1:30:15] Authority that's
[1:30:17] right Faithful Men Who Shall be able to
[1:30:19] teach others thou therefore endure
[1:30:23] hardness as a good soldier of Jesus
[1:30:26] Christ how many love the
[1:30:28] word
[1:30:30] amen
[1:30:32] also in Titus Chapter
[1:30:35] 2 verses 1-1 15 I'll just take verses
[1:30:40] one and verse number 15 this is Paul
[1:30:43] again he says speak thou the things
[1:30:45] which become sound Doctrine he's telling
[1:30:48] this to Titus and then the last verse it
[1:30:51] says the these things speak and exort
[1:30:56] and rebuke with all authority let no man
[1:30:59] despise thee so the promises of God the
[1:31:04] precepts of the Lord the word of God was
[1:31:09] made to be
[1:31:11] declared Amen brother random says on the
[1:31:14] message I pulled it I didn't pull it out
[1:31:17] um does God change his mind about his
[1:31:19] word I think it is or trying to do God
[1:31:21] of service he says this is why I've said
[1:31:24] and I'll say it again you say what is
[1:31:27] said on those
[1:31:29] tapes right now the emphasis is to play
[1:31:32] what's on the tape well you got to play
[1:31:33] it so you can know what it says but then
[1:31:36] after you play it the commission was to
[1:31:40] say speak
[1:31:42] it say what the tapes
[1:31:47] say Press
[1:31:50] Play Say it and then obey it how about
[1:31:54] that can we add that in there they say
[1:31:57] press play and Obey well let's press
[1:32:00] play and then say what the tapes say so
[1:32:02] we all know what we
[1:32:04] obeying say what the tape well my pastor
[1:32:07] said what I think that's not what he
[1:32:08] said say what I think what Pastor said
[1:32:11] what we feel like you know what's
[1:32:12] changed no say what the tape say that
[1:32:16] was the that was the commission the
[1:32:18] prophet gave us amen so we know it was
[1:32:21] recorded it was recorded so that we
[1:32:23] could hear it we hear it so that we can
[1:32:26] speak it now this
[1:32:29] speaking and having the authority to
[1:32:33] speak God gives us that authority to
[1:32:36] speak and with that Authority we don't
[1:32:40] take it
[1:32:41] lightly
[1:32:43] amen we take that Authority as marching
[1:32:48] orders from the
[1:32:50] Lord and with the Authority once the
[1:32:52] Revelation strikes to you who gave you
[1:32:55] the permission to say Amen to every word
[1:33:00] you know how some Christians are they
[1:33:02] ask they ask for permission they ask
[1:33:05] their pastor and they do it in a subtle
[1:33:07] way they'll be visited a certain church
[1:33:09] and a a declaration to be made and then
[1:33:12] they look to see did the pastor say Amen
[1:33:14] if the Pastor said amen then I can say
[1:33:16] Amen well we ain't looking for that no
[1:33:18] more if it's in the word brother sister
[1:33:22] is Free as a Believer you can say Amen
[1:33:26] to what you
[1:33:27] read is that right there's a freedom
[1:33:30] that comes with that the Lord Set Me
[1:33:32] Free with that know how's brother so and
[1:33:35] so going to see this quote well it don't
[1:33:37] matter how you see it not looking for a
[1:33:40] group
[1:33:41] amen yes sir start a Facebook page to
[1:33:45] see if we can all say Amen together
[1:33:48] let's all thumbs like it together come
[1:33:51] on on Saints no you read it it blesses
[1:33:55] your soul say Amen to it eat it while
[1:33:59] it's
[1:34:00] hot eat that biscuit while it's hot
[1:34:05] sure or the bread eat it while it's hot
[1:34:10] Matthew 7:29 says for he taught them as
[1:34:13] one having Authority and not as the
[1:34:16] scribes Luke 10:1 18:20 and he said unto
[1:34:19] them I be Satan lightning fall from
[1:34:22] Heaven behold I give unto you power to
[1:34:26] tread upon serpents and
[1:34:30] scorpions and over all the power of the
[1:34:34] enemy and nothing shall by any means
[1:34:37] hurt you amen not withstanding in this
[1:34:41] Rejoice not that the spirits are subject
[1:34:42] unto you but rather Rejoice because your
[1:34:45] names are written so there's the
[1:34:46] scripture the scripture Jesus gives the
[1:34:49] church the authority over all the powers
[1:34:53] of Satan can we say Amen how many
[1:34:56] believe that let me see your hand that's
[1:34:59] what the cheap Captain said that's right
[1:35:02] he told us that we have the authority so
[1:35:04] if there's a mixup in that it's because
[1:35:07] we're believing something or we allow
[1:35:08] something to creep in now let's take the
[1:35:11] original man and this is in the message
[1:35:15] uh uh um fundamental Foundation of faith
[1:35:19] brother random deals with this and he
[1:35:20] spends little time talking about the
[1:35:23] original man and um paragraph number
[1:35:28] eight I think I'm actually getting to
[1:35:30] the notes that I gave you s God bless
[1:35:33] you paragraph number eight no matter
[1:35:36] what a state of a man's in he's yet a
[1:35:40] Son of God no matter how sinful he is
[1:35:44] how far away he is he's a fallen son but
[1:35:48] yet he's a son yeah God God is his
[1:35:52] Creator God is his maker God has bought
[1:35:56] him with a price he may never reconcile
[1:35:59] himself to that he may never accept it
[1:36:02] it may never do him any good but yet he
[1:36:04] is a son and she is a daughter of God
[1:36:09] and what did God put him here for now we
[1:36:12] could spend much time on these thoughts
[1:36:13] but we won't we just give it in a basic
[1:36:16] thought here for tonight then we'll go
[1:36:17] praying for the sick God when he made
[1:36:21] made man in the beginning he made him
[1:36:23] Superior to anything on earth right he
[1:36:27] gave him the
[1:36:28] jurisdiction over everything on the
[1:36:31] earth to control everything he
[1:36:35] controlled the animal life he control
[1:36:37] the fowl life the fishes of the sea he
[1:36:40] controls the winds he controls the plant
[1:36:44] life he controlled everything now a real
[1:36:47] man needs to hear this I'm not talking
[1:36:51] about a false man I'm talking about a
[1:36:53] believer that started here with the
[1:36:56] sinner's prayer and committed his life
[1:36:59] to God then you know what he redeemed us
[1:37:02] and he's bringing us back to you need to
[1:37:04] start what what did the original man
[1:37:06] have stop looking at all these other
[1:37:09] caral men and caral application I'm
[1:37:12] talking about God's man the original man
[1:37:17] had the power over everything the fishes
[1:37:21] the foul the winds and the
[1:37:28] waves what kind of man needs to hear
[1:37:31] this a real man needs to hear this a
[1:37:34] daughter of God needs to hear this a son
[1:37:36] needs to hear this and it quickens up
[1:37:39] and say what that's what I come from
[1:37:42] That's The Authority that was given to
[1:37:45] me God don't let me live below my
[1:37:48] privileges he made him Superior amen he
[1:37:52] controlled everything man was made as a
[1:37:55] secondary God on Earth he was given the
[1:37:58] power to control all things all elements
[1:38:03] of the earth that was Adam Adam was
[1:38:06] given these great
[1:38:08] Powers but then the then the power that
[1:38:12] he was given to make himself is where he
[1:38:16] fell Adam could speak to the winds it
[1:38:18] would stop he could speak to the trees
[1:38:21] they would obey him he could speak to
[1:38:22] the wildlife it would obey him he could
[1:38:25] speak to the waters every what it was
[1:38:28] everything obeyed Adam oh my now that is
[1:38:33] the beginning of
[1:38:36] man that's what God give him power over
[1:38:40] everything on the earth now though the
[1:38:43] fall through though now though the fall
[1:38:47] he lost the that power yeah then he
[1:38:50] becomes unconscious ience of the fact
[1:38:53] after losing his relationship and
[1:38:55] friendship fellowship with the father
[1:38:59] then he lost that and all of his great
[1:39:01] channels become clogged up and he
[1:39:05] couldn't get
[1:39:06] through now what Adam was in God Christ
[1:39:10] has redeemed us back to that now Our
[1:39:12] Redeemer to redeem anything is to
[1:39:15] bring is to bring it back to its
[1:39:19] original again yeah Adam never had to be
[1:39:23] sick he never had to die he never had to
[1:39:27] worry he never had a heartache he never
[1:39:30] had a fear he just climbed up in the
[1:39:33] arms of the father just like a child
[1:39:35] everything was his and whatever he asked
[1:39:38] why he just got it everything obeyed him
[1:39:42] because he was God's child and the child
[1:39:46] is heir of all things now when man fell
[1:39:49] he lost this and now what he lost in the
[1:39:53] fall Christ come as a redeemer did you
[1:39:58] ever stop to think what Christ redeemed
[1:40:00] us for he gave us everlasting light life
[1:40:04] he brought us back to the Eternal
[1:40:05] fellowship and relationship to God to be
[1:40:08] his sons and daughters again to restore
[1:40:10] back all that Adam lost in the fall how
[1:40:13] many Saints can say Amen to that now the
[1:40:16] thing of it is since he's restored man
[1:40:19] back to this place
[1:40:21] man in the fall has lost his conscience
[1:40:26] of what father put him here on Earth to
[1:40:29] do in other words all of the plumbing as
[1:40:33] it was in our brain and the outlets the
[1:40:37] faith has been clogged up come on preach
[1:40:41] brother Brandon clogged up with business
[1:40:45] Affairs home life domestic things
[1:40:51] who he preaching
[1:40:52] anybody is he talking the truth business
[1:40:56] life home life domestic affairs what's
[1:41:00] it doing clogging you up man some of
[1:41:03] y'all thinking about Monday right now
[1:41:06] taking notes on
[1:41:07] Tuesday business Affairs all clogged up
[1:41:10] what we going to do when we get home I
[1:41:12] got to take care all clogged up and you
[1:41:15] come to the house of the Lord to get
[1:41:17] some Faith because Faith cometh by
[1:41:20] hearing and hearing the word of the Lord
[1:41:22] but you worried about what kind of
[1:41:23] sandwich you going to eat at
[1:41:26] 12:00 you worried about what's for
[1:41:28] dinner what bills got paid and didn't
[1:41:30] get paid who likes you and who don't
[1:41:32] like you all clogged up brother or
[1:41:35] sister you are a son or daughter of God
[1:41:39] and God gave adam the authority over
[1:41:43] everything all
[1:41:46] circumstances were under his
[1:41:49] domain now this author God gave it to us
[1:41:54] amen clogged up with business Affair
[1:41:56] home life domestic things it's all
[1:41:59] become so clogged clogged up with that
[1:42:03] until God cannot operate through those
[1:42:06] channels that he made a man for now when
[1:42:10] God made the human body every little
[1:42:13] part had its place to play the teeth the
[1:42:17] tongue the eyes the nose
[1:42:21] God does everything in there to make it
[1:42:23] perfect in operation to make the man to
[1:42:26] live and if God so patterned a man the
[1:42:29] body of a man how much more has he
[1:42:33] patterned and set in order the body of
[1:42:36] Christ the
[1:42:39] church drop down to paragraph 17 same
[1:42:41] message so then we
[1:42:43] [Music]
[1:42:45] believe this is the confidence we have
[1:42:47] in God that we get what we ask for for
[1:42:51] he's God and cannot take back his word
[1:42:53] he's got to stay with his word so then
[1:42:57] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:43:00] you ask what you will and it'll be given
[1:43:03] unto you isn't that simple Faith created
[1:43:06] we was made for that purpose then
[1:43:09] through the fall why we was taken away
[1:43:11] from that then in Redemption we was
[1:43:14] brought back to it
[1:43:16] again and the only thing that hindered
[1:43:20] the human race today from being Superior
[1:43:24] and controlling like they did in the
[1:43:26] beginning is because of that power that
[1:43:29] that the power lines of the outlet of
[1:43:32] God made in the human being has been
[1:43:35] clogged
[1:43:37] up you need a spiritual
[1:43:40] plumber unclog your pipes
[1:43:46] amen sometimes I say this
[1:43:49] reverently some sometimes Theology and
[1:43:52] church
[1:43:54] doctrines what they
[1:43:56] do make you want to fight somebody argue
[1:44:01] think you better it's just clogging you
[1:44:03] up man you all clogged up you need to
[1:44:07] you need a nasal congestion decongestion
[1:44:10] a spiritual unclogging you need your
[1:44:14] plumbing you need you need to be
[1:44:16] unclogged look what he says about
[1:44:18] theology many times SA sometimes
[1:44:21] Theology and church doctrines have
[1:44:23] clogged up your faith line clogged up
[1:44:26] your Lin so you have been taught that
[1:44:28] those things can't be and that puts a
[1:44:31] block in the
[1:44:34] way God help
[1:44:36] us
[1:44:41] amen
[1:44:42] yes glory to God Amen so God wants us to
[1:44:47] know what the original man was wants us
[1:44:51] to know why we're not in the place that
[1:44:53] we should be because things have clogged
[1:44:56] up our faith line these are not you know
[1:45:00] a a question of your salvation of course
[1:45:02] you are saved by grace are you
[1:45:06] saved um the grace of the Son of God he
[1:45:10] he puts that faith in your heart you
[1:45:12] accept him you make that confession and
[1:45:15] then you are sa you are
[1:45:18] saved but now this
[1:45:21] this
[1:45:23] um prophecy that comes forth to
[1:45:27] Moses about why are you crying unto me
[1:45:33] speak and that the prophet brings it out
[1:45:36] in that message why Christ speak and he
[1:45:40] says God got kind of tired of it I
[1:45:44] believe said while you crying to me
[1:45:47] speak to the people and go forward my if
[1:45:49] any time ever look like they ought to
[1:45:52] retreat was then but God has no retreat
[1:45:56] there's no place to retreat in
[1:45:59] God go forward the doctor says it's
[1:46:03] cancer go forward if he says it's t TV
[1:46:07] go forward if the devil says you can't
[1:46:09] give this up go forward if your home
[1:46:12] says that you're going to be a fanatic
[1:46:14] go forward the church turns you out go
[1:46:18] forward there's no retreating back go
[1:46:23] forward speak and go
[1:46:27] forward speak what his word and go
[1:46:32] forward thus sayith the Lord and move on
[1:46:36] cry to the people but the people then
[1:46:38] rebelled and said it had been better
[1:46:41] that we died in Egypt it been better
[1:46:43] that we had our Graves marked then for
[1:46:46] the hyenas and the vultures to pick up
[1:46:48] our bones in the wilderness why did you
[1:46:51] bring us out here and after he had seen
[1:46:53] God had approved Moses to be a servant
[1:46:56] God when he when God comes into a person
[1:46:59] or to persons into a congregation into a
[1:47:03] man or a woman he vindicates his
[1:47:06] presence God proves that he's there for
[1:47:09] when God comes Supernatural signs begin
[1:47:12] to appear this person becomes a changed
[1:47:16] person they're not no more like they
[1:47:19] used to be sin has vanished from their
[1:47:22] life fear and doubt has vanished
[1:47:26] frustration they are solid stable live
[1:47:30] or die it's Christ they don't care what
[1:47:34] comes or what goes nothing shakes them
[1:47:38] they move forward how many Believers are
[1:47:42] like that today I'm moving forward I'm
[1:47:45] going forward paragraph
[1:47:49] 79
[1:47:51] same message he's talking about
[1:47:52] Stonewall Jackson he says the other
[1:47:55] generals asked him and said Mr Jackson a
[1:47:58] little bitty fellow blackheaded and
[1:48:01] blueeyed only about 5'2 in tall very
[1:48:04] modest moup speaking little fellow said
[1:48:07] Mr Jackson how can you stand in such
[1:48:10] opposition bashful like he kicked his
[1:48:12] boot on the ground and he said I never
[1:48:14] take a drink of water unless I thank God
[1:48:18] for it first
[1:48:20] that's where it is there is no retreat
[1:48:25] in God speak and go forward that's right
[1:48:30] that's God's commission to his church we
[1:48:33] have no time to
[1:48:36] slack they say the Revival is over it
[1:48:38] isn't over go forward it's time that
[1:48:42] Pentecost is played out it isn't it's
[1:48:44] time for Pentecost to rise in the name
[1:48:47] of Jesus Christ and go forward there
[1:48:50] there's no
[1:48:51] retreat there's no staying on the same
[1:48:54] ground let's move with the spirit or the
[1:48:57] spirit move on to somebody else and
[1:49:00] leave you standing you follow it do all
[1:49:03] that's in your heart for God is with you
[1:49:07] now so these declarations are made
[1:49:12] typically on a Sunday morning if you're
[1:49:14] in a good church or in God's Church
[1:49:17] let's say You're going to hear these
[1:49:19] Declarations of faith
[1:49:20] you're going to hear the word of the
[1:49:23] Lord but then there's
[1:49:26] murmurings I'm going call them the the
[1:49:29] Monday morning
[1:49:32] murmur you got to watch out for that
[1:49:34] Monday morning
[1:49:35] murmuring and let's take a few
[1:49:37] scriptures here just for a moment
[1:49:39] believe in Deuteronomy
[1:49:43] chapter
[1:49:49] 12
[1:50:00] Deuteronomy chapter 1 excuse
[1:50:05] me so they saw the great work works of
[1:50:09] Moses God had delivered them that's why
[1:50:12] they're out of Egypt now they're going
[1:50:14] on their road to the promised land and
[1:50:17] these people have become professional
[1:50:21] murmurers they they I'm serious they
[1:50:23] learn how to
[1:50:25] complain and it's just like it's almost
[1:50:28] like it's like you ask a guy what do you
[1:50:31] see he says well I'm just going to keep
[1:50:32] it real um uh I don't like what's going
[1:50:36] on I'm just keeping it real if it's
[1:50:38] contrary to God's word you're not
[1:50:39] keeping it
[1:50:41] real God said that we was going to take
[1:50:43] the land God said that we're more than
[1:50:46] able and we see this conflict at
[1:50:50] uh uh at at kades Baria when the spies
[1:50:55] all the spies went over and the 12 the
[1:50:57] 10 spies the 12 two came back with a
[1:51:00] positive report and the 10 came back
[1:51:03] with an evil report they simply
[1:51:07] persuaded the entire congregation out of
[1:51:11] a Divine promise of God through their
[1:51:14] words that they spoke they just begin to
[1:51:16] speak they begin to speak and as they
[1:51:19] spoke it was convin Ing and it became so
[1:51:21] convincing that okay these guys are
[1:51:23] valid because they were just there I
[1:51:26] didn't go I couldn't go I wasn't called
[1:51:28] to go but these guys went and Pastor
[1:51:31] Reverend Elder so and so said that we
[1:51:34] can't take it and then you know how
[1:51:36] people start quoting one another yes sir
[1:51:39] and then that that one that one that
[1:51:42] that single voice jumps on another to
[1:51:44] another until the congregation has one
[1:51:47] voice and it's a negative voice and you
[1:51:50] think everybody has their individual
[1:51:52] voice they don't everybody's quoting
[1:51:55] somebody it's either positive or
[1:51:57] negative and the whole congregation got
[1:52:01] in one mind in one Accord of the wrong
[1:52:04] thing they were quoting they didn't go
[1:52:07] over there they were quoting what they
[1:52:09] heard but they wasn't quoting what they
[1:52:12] heard from the
[1:52:15] Lord very dangerous spot Deuteronomy 26
[1:52:21] notwithstanding you would not go up but
[1:52:23] rebelled against the Commandment of the
[1:52:25] Lord your God and you murmured in your
[1:52:31] tents you didn't do it in the
[1:52:33] Tabernacle you went back home murmuring
[1:52:37] in the tents I got to straighten up this
[1:52:39] tent I don't know what a tent had in it
[1:52:41] how many rooms a tent has but you know
[1:52:43] family life intense you doing this and
[1:52:45] then but the Lord heard them murmuring
[1:52:48] and where were they murmuring at in
[1:52:50] their tents and those words you got to
[1:52:52] pay for them you'll reap what you
[1:52:55] speak what you are speaking it's going
[1:52:58] to come back upon you you think you're
[1:53:01] pronouncing something you think you're
[1:53:03] holding up something that's true if it
[1:53:05] ain't with God's word it ain't worth
[1:53:09] repeating is that right Saints
[1:53:13] M and you murmured in your tents and
[1:53:16] said because the Lord hated us he had
[1:53:18] brought us forth of the out of the land
[1:53:21] of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of
[1:53:23] the amorites to destroy us whei shall we
[1:53:26] go up our Brethren have discouraged our
[1:53:29] heart saying the people is greater and
[1:53:32] taller than we the cities are great and
[1:53:35] walled up to heaven and moreover we have
[1:53:38] seen the sons of Anakin there then I
[1:53:41] said unto you dread not neither be
[1:53:44] afraid of them the Lord your God which
[1:53:47] goeth before you he shall fight for you
[1:53:50] according to all that he did for you in
[1:53:52] Egypt before your eyes and in the
[1:53:55] wilderness where thou has seen how the
[1:53:57] Lord thy God bear thee as a man doth
[1:54:00] bear his own son and all the way that
[1:54:02] you went until you came into this place
[1:54:06] in this thing you did not believe the
[1:54:08] Lord your God who went in the way before
[1:54:11] you to search you out in place a place
[1:54:16] to pit your tents in the fire by night
[1:54:19] to show you by what way you should go in
[1:54:21] a cloud of day and the Lord did
[1:54:25] what heard the voice of your
[1:54:29] words and was wroth and
[1:54:33] swear so he went before you and you
[1:54:37] think this is a conversation between you
[1:54:40] and brother so and so and other
[1:54:43] disgruntle whoever about this you know

[1:54:56] true and the doctors's report is a true
[1:54:59] report it's what the doctors their x-ray
[1:55:02] is not lying that's what it said but
[1:55:05] who's going to believe God's report now
[1:55:08] God has a report over all other
[1:55:11] reports and we as believer we Proclaim
[1:55:16] God's report we Proclaim that all for
[1:55:19] all other
[1:55:21] reports can I get a
[1:55:25] witness it's not easy to do no it's a

[1:55:53] was praising the Lord and then Monday
[1:55:55] comes along and you got to go in and
[1:55:58] work next to the
[1:56:00] devil's you got to go in Satan's eating
[1:56:03] now and you got to proclaim the name of
[1:56:07] the Lord in a negative atmosphere and we
[1:56:11] all get angry we all get in bad mood we
[1:56:14] all feel funny that's called being a
[1:56:15] human being but speaking it out should
[1:56:18] never come out of our
[1:56:20] mouth don't let the devil get into your
[1:56:22] mouth
[1:56:23] now tame your
[1:56:27] tongue the word of the Lord Bridle it if
[1:56:32] a man can do that he'll be a perfect man
[1:56:34] Psalms 106 24 yeah they despised a
[1:56:37] pleasant land they believe not his word
[1:56:40] but murmured in their tents and
[1:56:42] hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord
[1:56:46] let's see how this happens the murmuring
[1:56:54] so look at this
[1:56:58] here what I call it murmuring
[1:57:02] Mondays look at a murmuring Monday
[1:57:05] paragraph 51 and the message what does
[1:57:07] thou
[1:57:08] hear paragraph 51 and it's very strange
[1:57:11] Pastor here knows and other ministers
[1:57:15] watch after your Mount carels you're
[1:57:18] going to have a juniper
[1:57:20] tree whenever a man has a
[1:57:24] blessing and the power of God Pours Down
[1:57:27] and does something for you look out
[1:57:31] Satan is on the
[1:57:33] track just remember the next day that
[1:57:36] Monday after a good day on Sunday is
[1:57:41] going to be a hard thing because he's
[1:57:44] going to do everything he can to knock
[1:57:47] that confidence out of you that the Holy
[1:57:50] Spirit instilled in you the day before
[1:57:54] look out for the
[1:57:56] Mondays sometimes it's in the parking
[1:57:59] lot we don't even leave the church
[1:58:02] grounds that
[1:58:04] negative that gloom and
[1:58:08] doom that will never make it I'll never
[1:58:11] amount it didn't mean it's not for me
[1:58:13] all of that negativity you need to kick
[1:58:15] that out you need to let that go am get
[1:58:20] behind me Satan get behind me
[1:58:23] Satan in the name of the Lord yes in the
[1:58:28] message why Christ
[1:58:30] speak brother bam deals with it in
[1:58:32] paragraph 46 he saids Now isn't that
[1:58:34] just like
[1:58:36] today we see the message come forth we
[1:58:39] see the church rise to a place on the
[1:58:42] wings of the Holy Spirit until the power
[1:58:44] of God Thrills every person in there the
[1:58:47] glory of God Falls around and signs and
[1:58:50] wonders take place less than a
[1:58:54] week less than a
[1:58:56] week Satan is
[1:58:59] permitted he gets the
[1:59:01] permission to come into that
[1:59:05] congregation cuz he ain't talking about
[1:59:07] our church he's talking about all the
[1:59:08] other
[1:59:09] churches why does he do it God permits
[1:59:13] it and then the church begins to murmur
[1:59:16] fall back amen maybe it wasn't so
[1:59:19] there is where we fail that's the
[1:59:22] failing of the church regardless of what
[1:59:25] takes place it's God move
[1:59:29] forward we'll say there is a brother so
[1:59:32] and so I shouted a victory with him but
[1:59:34] he's back no matter what he's done that
[1:59:37] has nothing to do with you well so and

[2:02:57] power of the
[2:02:58] tongue and life the fruit
[2:03:02] thereof you will eat from

[2:03:09] step keep walking keep walking thank
[2:03:12] you the new Christians they come with a
[2:03:15] nice positive outlook the the old saints
[2:03:18] were we going to that how long we going
[2:03:19] to preach you know all that kind of
[2:03:21] stuff but the ni do that's why we need
[2:03:24] to get some more in here give me some
[2:03:26] more more new Christians just fill that
[2:03:29] we got some free seats right up here
[2:03:32] just tell them to come on cuz we need
[2:03:34] that positive outlook you remember the
[2:03:36] new Christian you know how we call it
[2:03:38] spiritually ignorant but they just
[2:03:40] believe everything was going to be all
[2:03:42] right they believe all their prayers
[2:03:44] will be answered let me ask you what
[2:03:48] what what's a better position position
[2:03:49] to be in that's right whether they're
[2:03:51] answered or not who has the better
[2:03:53] attitude who do you want a 2hour ride
[2:03:56] with in a car who do you want to hang
[2:03:58] out with I want a man who's got a
[2:04:01] positive
[2:04:02] testimony a woman that speaks the
[2:04:04] blessing of God who
[2:04:08] proclaims these blessings with faith
[2:04:11] knowing it makes a
[2:04:13] different amen bless his wonderful name
[2:04:17] I'll take one more step here
[2:04:19] in that same message why Christ speak
[2:04:24] the prophet of God says in paragraph 39
[2:04:26] we read before I read it again he says
[2:04:27] speak
[2:04:29] what his word and go forward thus sayith
[2:04:34] the Lord and move on cry to the people
[2:04:38] the prophet of God says in paragraph
[2:04:41] number
[2:04:42] 73 look at David when he sit with Nathan
[2:04:45] the prophet David a man after God's Own
[2:04:47] Heart he was anointed God anointed him
[2:04:49] King David was not only a king but he
[2:04:53] was a prophet I like this quote I just
[2:04:55] want to drop this in so Nathan was the
[2:04:59] great prophet of the nation David was
[2:05:02] more or less a poet and a prophet
[2:05:05] songwriter
[2:05:07] musician and prophecy really in its
[2:05:11] original is more like a
[2:05:14] song when they
[2:05:16] prophesy I wonder
[2:05:19] if we can view Our Song service like
[2:05:22] that oh
[2:05:25] my does it matter if you're in the right
[2:05:27] key or not or does it matter more what
[2:05:30] words are you saying many people come to
[2:05:32] church they don't even sing they listen
[2:05:35] to other people sing right they don't
[2:05:37] Proclaim it out of their mouth God gave
[2:05:39] you a mouth to sing open your mouth and
[2:05:42] praise the Lord those words of the song
[2:05:46] is prophecy and David great king great
[2:05:50] warrior great but he was a
[2:05:52] musician and he was a
[2:05:54] songwriter and that was a prophecy a
[2:05:59] declaration Onward Christian Soldiers
[2:06:03] marching as War you sing those songs
[2:06:06] that give you courage that give you
[2:06:09] Faith the joy of the Lord is your
[2:06:12] strength it rises up your joy you begin
[2:06:15] to Proclaim that through the song
[2:06:19] why Christ speak paragraph 87 men and
[2:06:23] women today will join some social
[2:06:25] standings in the church join some
[2:06:27] intellectual group because they love to
[2:06:29] get into the intellectual sections when
[2:06:32] they know that the spirit of God has
[2:06:34] life and moves Christ is the same
[2:06:36] yesterday today and forever and the way
[2:06:39] he was then that's the way he is now and
[2:06:44] will be forever and the messenger of God
[2:06:46] is here the Holy Ghost to reject it is
[2:06:50] death to receive it is life approved how
[2:06:55] does people accept it now the Holy
[2:06:58] Spirit has one
[2:07:01] message speak the word and go forward
[2:07:06] that's right don't cry to me there's the
[2:07:09] word speak it and move forward thus
[2:07:14] sayeth the Lord that's the message of
[2:07:17] the Holy Ghost so what's the message of
[2:07:19] the Holy Ghost speak the word and do
[2:07:23] what go backward go forward go
[2:07:26] forward Holy Spirit has one message look
[2:07:30] at your neighbor and say one
[2:07:33] message and that one message repeat that
[2:07:36] one message Mage is speak the word and
[2:07:41] go
[2:07:42] forward don't go back sis don't go
[2:07:45] backwards my brother you go forward word
[2:07:49] the holy spirit's message is speak the
[2:07:54] word and go forward if it if you can't
[2:07:57] speak the word and go forward it better
[2:07:59] don't say
[2:08:01] nothing it's better just to keep it on
[2:08:04] quiet just button it up a got nothing to
[2:08:06] say what you what you think about I got
[2:08:08] nothing to say cuz what I'm going to say
[2:08:10] ain't GNA be right Lord help my mind
[2:08:13] help my thoughts let me get into
[2:08:15] atmosphere let me get a word of the Lord
[2:08:17] and when you get that word of the Lord
[2:08:19] you speak it you don't just think it all
[2:08:23] thinking is part of it but we don't just
[2:08:24] think it we speak the word and then move
[2:08:30] forward within a 7day span a week later
[2:08:35] this is lost many times because Satan is
[2:08:38] permitted to come to a congregation he
[2:08:40] has permission sir it's like Satan you
[2:08:43] don't have no business no have business

[2:11:47] Lord that will I seek after that I may
[2:11:50] dwell in the house of the Lord all the
[2:11:52] days of my life to behold the beauty of
[2:11:54] the Lord and to inquire in his Temple
[2:11:58] verse five for in the time of trouble he
[2:12:02] shall hide me in his Pavilion in the
[2:12:06] secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide
[2:12:08] me he shall set me up upon a rock and
[2:12:12] now shall my head be lifted up above my
[2:12:15] enemies round about me I'll offer
[2:12:20] sacrifices in his Tabernacles of Joy I
[2:12:23] will sing praises unto the Lord look at
[2:12:26] Psalms 23 let's quote that one together
[2:12:30] Psalms 23 how many know
[2:12:33] it let's declare it out loud the Lord is
[2:12:35] my shepherd I shall not want he maketh
[2:12:39] me to lie down in Green Pastures he
[2:12:42] leadth me beside the Still Waters he
[2:12:46] restoreth my soul he leadth me in Paths
[2:12:50] of righteousness for his name's sake yay
[2:12:54] though I walk through the valley of the
[2:12:56] shadow of death I will fear no evil for
[2:13:00] thou art with me thy rod and thy staff
[2:13:04] they comfort me thou preparest a table
[2:13:07] before me in the presence of my enemies
[2:13:10] thou anointest my head with oil my cup
[2:13:14] runneth over surely goodness and mercy
[2:13:18] shall follow me all the days of my life
[2:13:22] and I will dwell in the house of the
[2:13:25] Lord
[2:13:27] forever you know the song
[2:13:30] writer the the the the inspiration
[2:13:33] behind this was a man that knew God
[2:13:37] something squeezed him to write this it
[2:13:40] was alive when he wrote it it was living
[2:13:43] words when he wrote it it was sealed up
[2:13:48] it's
[2:13:49] prophetic it's a declaration it was
[2:13:52] uttered but it's sealed up until you
[2:13:55] read it it comes back alive again for
[2:13:59] you now David's PSAL becomes your song
[2:14:03] and when the songs that you sing out of
[2:14:05] the song book becomes your song then the
[2:14:09] anointing comes upon your life and you
[2:14:13] got a tree that's being planted in your
[2:14:16] life from your lips that you spoke out
[2:14:19] as you declared it and believed it in
