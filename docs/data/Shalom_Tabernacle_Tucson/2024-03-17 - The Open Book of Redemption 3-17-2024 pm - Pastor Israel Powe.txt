amen God bless you Saints we're so good to be in the house of the Lord with you are you happy to be here yes we're glad to have you here and uh we certainly appreciate the meeting this morning with brother brother George I enjoyed that very very nice appreciate the word of the Lord I feasted on that on my way home from TU from Phoenix this morning and uh uh thank you that'll be all uh your musicians and so we just to give you a quick report of what happened in Warz because we were there last Sunday morning and we got tied up and I couldn't make it for the Sunday night service and so we had this trip in Hot Springs kind of pre-planned and I don't like to be gone on the Sunday morning but when I got stuck at the border like that in the time um it made it to where I was uh going to Sundays like that but um I'm glad to be back home glad to be back in the house of the Lord with my friends the Saints of the most high God I know when you don't say amen I know why so when you're visiting you don't always know but um we appreciate each of you and we appreciate the opportunity uh to come and minister the word always but it's something about visiting uh the church you get on that Evangelistic type of service it revives you you see fresh faces and new faces and it does something for you and it actually helps me to come back and be um more motivated I think it seems so this trip in Warz was just such a blessing to me um the with brother Robert figuro we went down there and this brother pastor Tito um a young man he's a school teacher there and he's really doing a a great work trying to keep the Saints together there and they we had three baptisms there was a couple that and this church is only he said 30 to 35 people including children but there was maybe 250 or 300 that came from all over and he put that together and he fed the people and his people gave up their rooms and beds and they slept on the floor to host everyone and it's just a a real sacrifice but the fruits of it we saw three baptisms and one of them was the pastor's uh younger sister it shocked him he he knew of one baptism and then another man was invited to come to church and he got baptized and that was a shocking he said is there anyone else and his little sister got up and it just it broke his heart to see that and it broke my heart too it was so I was so good to see her she's 18 or 19 years old just a young lady and so so nice to see that there was a a couple that had been uh living together like husband and wife but they weren't married for 22 or 24 years or something like that and then they came in contact with the message and they wanted to get their life straightened out and so at the end of one of the services they um she decided to have her wedding so there was a king Setta on the Friday night or Saturday night and then the wedding and uh so we got the full experience I got lost we got lost in wared and wared think of that and he the Pastor said you know the people they don't like to come and see him there because they're afraid of the bullets and so he's kind of teasing which it's a very vient City but the word of the Lord is going forward and I was so encouraged to see that and um I thank the Lord for that and we had a wonderful time then in Hot Springs we had a great uh time of Fellowship two Services there and got back into Phoenix this morning and uh just had a a great time seeing those Saints there brother Kirby we'd say there the founder of that church believe that's where I met brother George and Brandy first time there's a brother Kirby's Church real solid man just love him very have to guess what he was thinking he would tell you like it or love it but he was steady and he was solid and we appreciate that at least you know and so we went there to be of help he's Larry they've always asked me brother since you've been pastoring you don't come see us no more forget about the young people the little people you just move on I said no we we appreciate so it worked out that we were able to go so I'm happy to be here tonight and uh I'm not tired you know some people ask you aren't you tired aren't you tired don't put no tiredness on me it will come when it comes I'll tell you if I'm tired all right God bless you amen praise the Lord Brother Johnny Alvarado Jr is here with us and his family so good to have him with us so we appreciate that I missed him this morning amen yes a hand of praise his daddy was a good friend of ours and and the Lord called him home here a couple years ago and so we know that we'll see him again it's always good to see our friends from Phoenix there so we like to go right into the word of the Lord tonight I have a a very short message I'll try to keep it as short as possible in the scriptures we want to turn we'll ask you to stand to Romans chapter 8 verse number 14 I'll greet the Saints in Phoenix as well and Mesa there we had a wonderful time uh with them I think so and maybe if they agree with that they can say Amen or wave their hand or something yeah all right so we wouldn't know so but anyways we had a wonderful time a lot of visitors there this morning and so we'll pray for them in the scripture Romans chapter 8 verse number 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father the spirit itself beareth Witness with our spirit that we are children of God and if children then H HS of God and Joint HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together amen let's take one more scripture in Revelations chapter 5 verse number one and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within okay and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon Amen Let take a little uh title this evening the open book of redemption it's the title The open book of redemption this morning it'll be similar as I I spoke to them on some of these very things and i' like to go a little bit further and we trust the Lord will bless you let us pray Father in heaven we ask your blessings upon your word tonight bless every heart We Gather in Your Name Lord we are looking And depending on you Lord to speak to our hearts without you we can do nothing we have nothing to offer except your word that you've given to us and as we heard this morning we can only see what you show us if you show it to us Lord Lord we want to be faithful to react and respond to what you show us and Lord we want to be respectful and diligent open our eyes and our hearts to hear your word tonight speak we pray and we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated the open book of redemption now this book of redemption that John saw and brother bam tells us that the book of redemption he also calls it the book of life and in the Book of Life there is seemingly two parts The Book of Life and then the Lamb's Book of Life and they look like two books and it looks like one book it's really one book and here's what brother random says about this book of redemption I'll just get right into it in paragraph number 31 of the first seal he says John turning he saw a lamb coming out it must have been bloody cut and wounded it had been slain said it it a lamb that had been slain and of course it was still bloody if you had cut if you had cut a lamb and killed it the way the lamb was anyhow it was hacked to pieces on a cross Spears in the side Nails in the hands and feet and Thorns over the brow he was in an awful condition and this lamb come forth and went over to him that sat upon the throne that held the complete title deed of redemption yes yes and the lamb goes and takes the book out of the hand of him that sat upon the throne took and opened the seals and opened the book you see the book actually was planned and written before the foundation of the world this book The Bible was really written before the foundation of the world and Christ being the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and the members of his bride their names were put in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world but it's been sealed up and now it's being revealed whose names were in there all about it what a great thing and John when he saw it he said everything in heaven everything underneath the Earth everything heard him saying amen and blessings and honor he just really was having a great time for the lamb was worthy isn't that nice to know that this book The Bible was written before it came here on the earth It Was Written in heaven and your names were written in that book in heaven before you got here or the book got here yes sir heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away it's the only thing stable it's The Only Thing Worth preaching about it's The Only Thing Worth founding a church upon or Ministry or marriage or a relationship is upon the word of God Amen praise His name paragraph 308 in the message um The Invisible Union that was the first deal this is the invisible Union of the bride of Christ he says there is your name on The Book of Life The Book of Life is the word of God because the word is God and God is the only thing that is life so your name was represented in the Bible before the Bible become on word yes sir mm we might dance tonight all right come on this might be one of those services that somebody might dance and if you dance I ain't going to stop you all right okay don't stop them now if they take off let them go your name was represented in the book this is The Only Thing Worth dancing about by the way your name was represented in the Bible before the Bible become on word and and if you're here to do that won't it vindicate that word won't the church vindicate itself won't Malachi 4 and all these other things perfectly perfectly vindicate itself and show that that's what it is works as Faith Express brother brandom says this talking about this book of life and the Lamb's Book of Life the Baptists believe there's two separate books paragraph 120 and works is Faith Express the Baptist believe it's two separate books and in one way it is two separate books and in another way it isn't two separate books I'm two separate people I'm a Body and Soul and Spirit three separate people but I only one only one makes me as a being there's only real there's only real one book of life like there was a germ of wheat that come through the stock and um brother mam continues on and that's the one place sounds like you can have your name taken off the Lamb's Book of Life the other place you can't do it so there's where it is it's all in the great Revelation there which was made known during the time of the Seven Seals so your Bible this book the Bible is the book of redemption it's the book of life and your name was written in there all of creation was lost when this book had was lost by Adam now brother bam shows us that Adam had Dominion this is his in the beginning Adam when he sinned he lost the Dominion and he lost the authority that was given to him and brother random says this here this is what happens when he lost the book so it looks like it goes into two or three different hands before it gets back into its right rightful place and look at how brother brandom says this in the breach between uh the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals this is the breach paragraph 99 now when Adam sinned by heeding with by heeding his wife's reasoning instead of holding to God's word that's what made Adam sin his wife reasoned with Satan and then produced the product to Adam and Adam turned loose the word and sold out he lost all his inheritance when he lost his fellowship and right to life remember the day you eat thereof the day you die when he lost his life he also lost his inheritance in life because he had completely Supreme control of the earth he was a god of the earth God is the god of the universe everywhere but his son had the Earth under his own control he could speak he could name he could say he could stop nature he can do anything he wanted to see but when he did that he lost his inheritance I want you to notice how beautiful this Revelation is to us who follow this message I don't know how many churches know these things but they were revealed to us under the opening of The Seven Seals what the book of redemption was what did Adam lose and now it is being redeemed back so brother mam says you can speak paragraph 101 now Adam could say let this mountain here be moved over there and it would do it Adam could say let this tree here be plucked up and planted over here it would do it see for he had complete Supreme control as a minor God under God our father because he was a Son of God now couldn't we stop here just a minute and get a real sermon yes we could actually oh then if the blood has cleansed it back what about now see look what the Son of God the second Adam did see said the works that I do shall you also see and Adam lost his inheritance the earth now it passed from his hands to the one he sold out to Satan he sold his faith in God to Satan's reasoning therefore his eternal life his right to the Tree of Life his right to the Earth belonged to him he forfeited every bit to the hands of Satan he passed it from his hand to Satan therefore now it has been returned and has been polluted and the seed of Adam has destroyed the inheritance that Adam should have had that's the Earth that's right see the seed of Adam so what happens to the book of redemption it leaves from Adam's hand that control and it was the authority of the spoken word he had the authority to move things by the word because the spoken word is the Original Seed he would move that tree he would plant and he would do and he controlled the the the migration of the fishes and the birds he controlled everything all of Nature and everything that was named was named by Adam very bright mind yes very intelligent being to be able to name all of the species in their categories and give them names and know it without a Facebook without a Google iPad or whatever right right yes just the this we talking about an original man now we're talking about where we came from and now you got to have something that you're aiming at or you're going to miss whatever you're shooting if you don't know what you're aiming at as Believers our aim is complete and total Redemption back to what God originally had in his mind for a man amen amen so here's Adam he loses all of of this and he compromises through the fall through the the fruit of the woman through Satan he loses everything and he's stripped and so not only is the book of redemption the book of life it's the book of your life and your life won't make any sense until this book is opened up to you and you'll run circles and you'll try to do this you try to make this happen life has no meaning until this begins to open up to you you can't understand suffering you can't understand what is joy and peace if this isn't open up to you it's the book of life and it's the book of your life if you're a Believer and God wants this book open up to us so we know that the Bible is the book of life and it had to be open now so we see that Adam loses the book it falls into the dirty hands of Satan and this is why um suffering exists the way it does today now brother random goes further in The Sixth Seal and says this in paragraph 126 compare scriptures of this great event that we will see that this great secret or mystery that was under the six seal of the book of redemption now remember these are hidden mysteries and the six seals all together is one great big book just six Scrolls rolled together and it unwinds the whole book of redemption that's how the whole earth was redeemed that's the reason John wept because no one could get that book all of creation everything was gone she would just simply turn back to atoms molecules and so forth Cosmic and not even uh be creation person nothing else cuz Adam lost the rights of that book he forfeited it when he listened to his wife and she listened to Satan's reasoning instead of the word of God see it was forfeited then it couldn't go back into the dirty hands of Satan who tempted her out of the way so therefore went back to its original owner like any abstract deed would do see goes right back to its original owner and that was God the Creator who made it and he holds it and there's a price and that's Redemption there is some price for Redemption there was nobody could do it so he said he made laws his own laws of a kinsman redeemer then they could find nobody every man was born of sex born after sexual desire he was in the original sin Satan and Eve so he could not do it there's nothing in him no holy Pope priest doctor of divinity whoever he might be he would nobody worthy and he couldn't be an angel because it had to be a Kinsman it had to be a man then God himself become a Kinsman by taking on human flesh through the Virgin birth and he shed his blood that wasn't the blood of a Jew it wasn't the blood of a g was the blood of God see the Bible said we're saved through the blood of God Amen that's right so we see how this book moved now it was in Adam's hand and then Adam sinned and he loses the book he loses all the rights of an original man then Satan gets his dirty hands on it and in portion he still has control of all the governments that rule the Earth he still does but the title deed of redemption goes back into the hands of God now and now God has to pay a price to get that book back into the hands of man again praise the Lord because it belongs to man right and whatever God gives you if you lose it you need to claim that promise give it back to me it belongs to me we're not asking for something that don't belong to us when we claim healing that belongs to us we claim salvation the Holy Ghost our family Peace of Mind joy in the spirit that belongs to us we're not asking for something that don't belong to us we're asking for a promise that God is already given to us praise the Lord amen so it goes further after Redemption now the blood was shed for the book to come back to the Earth now Jesus robes himself God robes himself in flesh in the body of the Lord Jesus Christ pays the price for Redemption a virgin birth he was a man he was not an angel he was a man a kinsman redeemer he pays the price now the book is Back available to man now now this is a beautiful thing all right can I go a little bit further this is a beautiful thing because now we can see the book developing a place of rest it's going to find a resting place the book was predestinated in heaven and when it tried to come on the earth many times they try to burn it they try to stop it they try to kill it but it came anyways and every time that book hit a community it was a GameChanger for the community in the Reformation the Reformation didn't preach the Holy Ghost it didn't bring us back to an adoption but what the Reformation did it put the Bible back into the hands of the ordinary man cuz that's where it belonged and when we can get it back into the man's hands God can do the rest God can begin to work through those men through those communities through those families and that's what he did in the Reformation amen so as a Son of God or son of Adam our desire should be to come into maturity this full maturity or the stature of a perfect man now look at the book now brother randam says in the third seal he says this about the book paragraph 40 he said he he's worthy to take the book of redemption now it doesn't belong back to the judge anymore it belongs to the Redeemer and he has done done the work of redemption now he's going to show the church what he done amen see then he just takes but the book is closed no one know it at all they know it was a book of Redemption on there but it's to be it was to be revealed in the last days according to Revelations 10 yes the seventh angel is going to be given the message of that because it said that in the time of the sounding of the seventh a age the seventh angel when he sounds all the mysteries of God should be finished up by his sounding then after it's revealed the angel come down from heaven which was Christ now remember this Angel is on earth a messenger okay so now we can see now that the book of redemption we can see now that the book of redemption is now in the hands of the seventh Angels Ministry that belongs to him am I love that what brother George said this morning but that that that that that that Revelation is committed to only one for each age and for this last age it's a complete full picture of what a redeemed man looks like now they asked brother brandham this question just to show you that even them back in those those ages of the Tabernacle and we kind of think that they was they didn't have the Revelation that we have but look at this question here look at this question here that they asked the prophet okay don't tell me I didn't bring it shees all right it was a question that they asked brother brandham talking about this restoration and he's it was a question they asked I have it it's in there I won't take time but they asked brother bandam the question it seems quite possible with this ministry of the third pole that a redeemed son can be made back fully redeemed again you see somebody's interested in that not everybody not everybody but it's a you have that quote brother George somebody got almost got it it seems quite possible and it says and stand before the son of man so they ask brother ROM this question it seems quite possible with this ministry of the third pool the spoken word that you could speak the word and make a son a redeemed son son again back like Adam praise the Lord thank you my brother that's how you know you got friends is when they hand you the word if they ain't handing you the word then leave them alone paragraph 248 this is in the questions and answers thank you brother George thank you so much this third pool and is speaking the word it seems in entirely possible for you to speak the word and one would be completely and fully restored placed entirely ready for the Rapture in the Resurrection the son of man this is so or is it not question mark and you would do this if properly pressed upon so they're asking brother brandom you got the third pool you you been talking talking about it you've been preaching it to us it seems possible that you can take that third pool and speak a man back to be restored again you ain't going to ask Billy Graham that you ain't going to ask the Reverend Oral Roberts that there's no other Ministry you would ask that there had to be something evident that it would even ask enter my mind to ask this brother could you speak the word and restore me praise the Lord M so now we see let's get into the answer just a little bit did just tell me what it is my face all right face IA okay thank you all right my face didn't work all right so let me let me read this quote we have a little fun God bless you don't all right so Place entirely ready for the Rapture and the resurrection the son of man this is so or is it not and you would do this if properly pressed upon would you not Escape all these things it's got a ditto there Escape all these things and stand before the son of man Luke 21:36 now my dear friend we're going to say what the tape say now now I think here that you you you got a good statement yes sir yes sir amen now that would be so you said brother brandom in other words here I don't think it's I I believe I'm not polishing up what you said but I believe I can make it a little clearer to people see you're believing because of the spoken words and things like that that he said about and all of you hear witness the squirrels and all these other things that's been done but did did you notice that was sovereignly given I never asked him Lord let me do this speak these things and like that do these things there I never asked him he by his own Divine will came to me and said you go do this see I wasn't asking one thing about it Moses never asked to go down into Egypt but God but was God that sent him down to Egypt see now I believe that the Holy Spirit would come to me and say in a vision go tell a certain certain person that they are not they're trying to overcome a certain thing they cannot do it they're smoking they're drinking they're lying stealing or committing adultery whatever it might be they got a lustful spirit and you just go where they are and say thou Spirit come out of there I set this captive free would it take place absolutely yes indeed that absolutely would I take place but now upon presuming and brother mam goes on so isn't that uh beautiful questions come from somewhere questions come from somewhere somebody was thinking about that and if they didn't think about it maybe you would have thought about it see because that is our heart's desire to get back to our original position again let me just share a quick testimony on Israel in the land of Israel when we were there um our guide told us this that when Israel the the people of the Jews started to come back into the Homeland after the war that the climate changed and they started receiving more rain and the land became more fertile why because these people had found their place amen and when you find your place that's when the blessings begin to Flow It's Supernatural it's all about putting God first you put him first he'll take care of the desires of your heart he already knows what you want and desire but if you delight yourself in me I will give you the desires of your heart that's when you find your place and you get yourself in track with the word of God and this book of life and then things will fall in order now just to save a little bit of time so we see this book now is in the ministry of the seventh Angels Ministry I'll take a little bit in the first seal paragraph number 205 the revelations 10 said his message was to reveal not reform reveal the secrets reveals Secrets it's the word in the man Hebrews 4 said that the word of God is sharper than a twoed sword piercing even to a suer of the bone and a revealer of the secrets of the heart see this man is not a reformer he's talking about the seventh angel now this man is not a reformer he's a revealer a revealer of what the mysteries of God where the churches has got it all tied up in everything he's to come forth with the word of God and reveal the thing out because he's to restore the faith of the children back to the Father the original Bible faith is to be restored by the seventh angel praise the Lord so this book of redemption The Book of Life the Lamb's Book of Life is now being opened and revealed by the seventh angel Revelations 10:7 amen now how are you related to that angel aren't you so glad that the message found you most of us here wasn't in the brandom Tabernacle to hear the precious words proceed or to even Shake our dear brother the Reverend bram's hand most of us were not a part of the first second or even the tape making Ministry but the tape fell in our hands and the tape fell in our hands on purpose yes sir amen that was not an accident it was like it was guided it followed you it found you on your job in the hood wherever you were that tape found you because you're identified with that word it's the only thing that makes sense when it contacts you the questions of Life begin to be answered the questions of your life not just the Book of Life or random Life the book of my life being open and revealed Lord so what does this mean this means that God wanted another Adam on the Earth again a redeemed son to come to maturity you know what's interesting is that many today and this might scratch a little bit many today many Ministries today they don't have no problem with this quote I'm going to read you right now that you become the word as you receive the word that the bride is the word made flesh because that speaks of what we should be maturing to yes right but how can we say that right and but we don't have a real example of what an Adam looks like what does a redeem man look like in real time what what kind what what was his stature what does that Ministry look like in flesh that's what it is right here good I'm not ashamed to say that the word made flesh in our day coming back to a Son of God that had the authority that Adam had that can speak to Creation that can create from out of nowhere that had the power given to him by almighty God to represent that the blood at Calvary still works now we have it at Calvary we had it Through the Ages but here we have a man with the authority don't be afraid of that because you got to come into that too all right amen we should be coming to maturity all of us now I I can't I can't determine how fast you're going to mature that's not my job and and you can't and you can't determine how fast I'm a mature and and it's like brother random says if I can't do it if I can't have faith for something I'm not going to stand in the way of a man that does so we we we shouldn't apologize for the things that the Lord shows us right if the Lord is bringing us to maturity just grow up amen into that maturity right and we're not waiting for everybody else for us all to mature together you got to pick up your book your Bible and let that open up to you and that becomes a revelation to you the book begins to open up to you so let's take a few quotes and I got 15 minutes all right here what he says in this message the word is again falling part paragraph 146 Church of the Living God that bride moves right on just the same and she'll go in the Rapture by the word that's right the word and the word will come together if we're part of Christ part of it we have to be his word because he is the word right yes sir they have refused the anointed Word of Promise of this age and he is always the word if God sent us an anointed promised word again for this age in 1946 he would be the same he was when when he come into the beginning the anointed word for the age see Hebrews 13:8 throws it right back in your lap and says he's the same yesterday today and forever that's exactly right and he would stay with the father's promised word for this age if Jesus comes he would be just exactly what the word said it would be in this age that's what Elijah was in his age that's what Moses was in his age that's what Noah was in his age that's what everywhere every Prophet ever come and the word when it comes in its fullness the entire word made flesh Among Us it did just exactly what it said it would do in that age if it come today he would be just exactly Jesus Christ Living out his promise of what he promised to do just as the word can I read one more sir questions and answers 1964 so paragraph 49 so being well-trained Theologian had nothing to do with it being Meek and gentle had nothing to do with it what made him different he was the word made flesh not the word for the day of Moses Moses was that day word not the word for the days of Noah Noah was the word for that day not the word for the day of Elijah Elijah was the word for that day but he was the present tense word and they were living in the back amen the same thing repeats amen that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost when God reveals it to you and you see it thus said the Lord and accepted not what you are not what you was or nothing about it's what God has done for you now there's the evidence so we thank the Lord that we know what a redeemed son looks like and with this pattern in view we have an example James 5 says take for your example the prophets we have an example of what a redeemed son looks like is that right Saints that's what we're coming to and this comes through as the book The open book of redemption the book of redemption the Bible begins to open up to us and reveal to us our names we thank God for it and this is the beauty of the message so we have so many more quotes here the incarnated word but this Authority that man has has lost Jesus speaks of it in Matthew chapter 8 Ma and Mark chapter 13 and we like to read those just before we close Matthew chapter 8 vers number six when you have that you can say amen amen and the Bible says and saying Lord my servant Li at home sick of the py grievously tormented Jesus said unto him I will come and heal him the Centurion answered and said Lord I'm not worthy that thou should come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed for I am a man under Authority now this was a gentile now and he understand this rule or the law or the precepts of what Authority was what it means to have authority and we as Believers don't have power but we have the authority that's given to us from the book of redemption amen and this man he says I'm under Authority having soldiers under me and I say to this man go he goeth into another comeon he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it when Jesus heard it he what he marveled and said to them that followed what' he say verily I say unto you I have not found so great faith no not in Israel this man caught Jesus's attention this Gentile because he understood what Authority was and if there ever was an age that where the Prophet taught us the authority of the word how the power of God lays in his word our attitude towards God is our attitude towards his word and when that word is revealed back to you you now have the authority of the author of the word if you can receive it now we can act immature we can act like babies or we can grow up and take the authority of the word and do what Jesus told us to do by believing every word standing on it and believing it until it comes to pass this is what we're coming into this is what uh the prophet came into and he's our example is that right a man of under Authority I verely I say unto you I have not found so great faith no not in Israel Mark 13:33 let's read that scripture don't you love the Lord they don't know who they got working at the job where you're working son or daughter of God they think they can control You by their systems of government and the the bosses and the human resources they can keep you down from a promotion hide your good deeds they don't have control over you you're a son or daughter of God yes we have that Authority take heed and watch and pray for you know not when the time is for the son of man is as the man taken a far Journey who left his house and gave authority to his servants and to every man his work and commanded the porter to watch watch ye therefore for you know not when the Master of the House cometh at evening at midnight at the crowing or in the morning let's coming suddenly he find you sleeping and I what I say unto you I say unto all watch now God has given us this Authority and with the authority of this book The Bible being open now the message we believe is a message that's absolutely founded on the Bible the word of God it's not abstract from the Bible no you ever start preaching a message and you don't have the Bible in there you're not preaching brother Brand's message uh and which one is more important it's it's ridiculous it's all God like do I want the Old Testament or new testament do I want Peter or Paul it's all God why choose from one when I can have both God gave us both it's the devil that wants to separate so you stay with the word and look at what the word has redeemed to us just briefly five little things and there's many but there's five smooth things that I'm that I'm going to bring out here just that has been revealed to us or given to us look at the third pool Vindicated a fully restored Adam on Earth again that's what the third pool Ministry did and we've seen that in the life of the Reverend William brandham Paul went to heaven to the third heaven he called it paradise and when he went there in 2 Corinthians chapter 2: 12 12 he said I met a man in Christ and I saw things that I could not speak of remember that scripture he saw he went to this other realm and he said it was 14 years ago he didn't talk about it much but he said 14 years ago I went and I knew a man and I went beyond the Third heaven and I saw things and I couldn't speak but in this day a prophet went beyond the curtain of time oh God and gave us details as to what happens to a man when he crosses over so we don't have funerals like they have funerals because we know what happens to our loved ones he went beyond the curtain of time and he saw his family his converts were there amen and he was the leader over there now do you believe that testimony yes I do has his head on the back he was laying in his bed so oh would help me so much would you like to look beyond the curtain of Time how many of us would have like to look beyond the curtain of time what's behind there and take a look God gave him the privilege to go beyond the curtain of time and then bring him back and tell you and I details praise the Lord amen that's because the book has been open look at the fellowship that's restored to God in this last age that was the promise that this Fellowship between God and man would be restored in the last age that's a promise so we look forward to that we know it's supposed to be here the Overcomers in this age they inherit all of the previous age Overcomer promises brother branam through the open word revealed that to us and then and this is really nice we saw the sign of the son of man on the recordings we saw it on the recordings it's on your tapes it happened it really happened it's real he stood before those people and God used him in such a mighty way and in that day we saw what happened with ad or Abraham when that angel came to him in the tent we saw it in the scripture with Jesus we all just writing all just written all just written but now we seeing how it happened how it function what it looks like it's tangible so we have an example of a redeemed Son of God that fit in the line of what Adam lost it was redeemed back in this age and samples of it was ministered through the life of the Reverend William brandham and that's what we're following and I'm coming to that maturity too and I trust you are too amen this is why we quote his message this is why we stand for it we don't ask permission for it we're not waiting for everybody to catch up with us we just running with it thank God for it thank God for you don't be ashamed of this word don't be ashamed of it God gave it to us it is The Book of Life it made my life make sense it'll make your life make sense to to God God bless you let us pray Lord we thank you for your word tonight thank you for the reminders Lord that you give to us it just means so much father we thank you Lord that the examples have been recorded and it's not a secondhand Revelation I heard your Prophet say these things I heard it with my own ears I can never be the same again you've opened it up to me and Lord I'm I'm crying out for my spirit and soul to be manifested I'm groaning in the spirit all creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God we know that Son of God that Authority that position it starts at Calvary as you redeem us and Lord and then we mature and we grow I pray that you'll continue that maturity with us tonight we ask
