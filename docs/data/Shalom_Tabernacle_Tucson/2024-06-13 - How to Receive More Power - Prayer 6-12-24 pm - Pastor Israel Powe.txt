good to see Nathan and uh my dear sister Melissa back and each of you Brother Andy has some family here they they're new to the city and to the country here we thank the Lord for them I look forward to meeting them so God bless them we welcome you to the house of the Lord here tonight yeah we can give the Lord a hand of praise for them amen amen I have a portion in the scripture I'd like to turn to in Acts chapter 1 and Sunday morning we spoke on how to receive more power and I want to continue just a little bit into that message here tonight how to receive more power and I'm going to focus in on the prayer because this is a prayer meeting and I'm just trusting the Lord to be a blessing to you Acts chapter 1 verse number eight but you ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses un to me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria and into the uttermost parts of the Earth take one more scripture found in James chapter 4 yes in verse number three take verse number two sorry you lust and have not you kill and desire to have and cannot obtain you fight and War yet you have not because you ask not you ask and receive not because you ask aiss that ye may consume it upon your lust ye adulterers adulteresses know ye that the Friendship of the world is enmity with God whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God Amen thank God for the reading of his word um God bless you you may be seated amen praise the Lord so in this message we took on Sunday morning that scripture in Acts and then I believe we got into uh the message that brother bandam entitles the countdown and he started to bring out in science how in science they have achieved great things and that those scientific achievement actually are related to our spiritual walk and their spiritual achievement as well because the man is made up of Body Spirit and soul that's what makes up a man and no matter how much anointed you are with the Holy Ghost that anointing has to fall upon your body and this is how the word of the Lord comes it starts out by reading it's carnal it seems outwardly but that's for the purpose that it reaches down into your soul and that's where the anointing takes place that's where Revelation happens and so um they're definitely related and I like the way brother brandham brings it in the message there to countdown and he says this in paragraph number 35 he says let's take for one let's take for One Transportation first the transportation was by horse next it was by automobile then science built us an airplane but you see it is first was a horsepower the car was made 20 horsepower the airplane goes up to hundreds of horsepower see what it is just as we come on with the horse then an automobile was made then the next thing was an airplane we just keep achieving on higher and higher going greater and greater this is the achievement of science this is a forerunner of the spiritual things that's happened of God by his Spirit has been in his promised word so brother vom is now taking the achievement of a man which we're all men and women here today and those great tremendous achievements that they have achieved the 20th century the 21st century and there's just been an advancement in their um findings it just keeps accelerating it's like it it's moving faster than it ever has been and he types that to spiritual things so so if the scientists have increased year after year even month after month even every time you get a new phone there's updates they update that version that you have and it's a constant moving upward What About Us in the spirit where where should we be and I gave the example and I mentioned him just a little bit this gentleman Elon Musk we all know of him he's a little out there got his own opinion Beats by his own drum beat people say he couldn't do this and they criticizing for this and that do you think he's worried about what other scientists are telling him he can't do no no they can hate they can just you know discredit him and say what his motives are and so forth he's still doing his thing and he'll probably continue doing his thing as long as he's here on Earth that's his that's his mind that's his achievement that's what he is that's what he does and so what about us the True Believer now in the prayer and because this is a prayer meeting and I I I don't want to hold you too long I think that as we take James chapter 4 just a little bit we'll see that um you don't have because you don't ask and then brother random ask adds he says you have not because you ask not you ask not because you believe not brother vam adds that in there he says it many many times you ask not because you believe not but look at this prayer in James chapter 4 and I think many times we might misapply prayer because we know that no matter where you are or what you're doing or you're standing prostrate hands raised on your knees whatever it's always appropriate to pray you're never out of order when you're in prayer you can pray while you're having a conversation with someone you can pray like you could be praying right now you can go down on your knees and pray you can pray prostrate you can pray with your hands up pray standing pray kneeling it's always appropriate can I get a witness there is no you pray too much now you could preach too much talk too much laugh too much sing too much eat too much we could do a lot of things too much but prayer is one of those things you can't do too much of and so what I think because we know we can't pray as far as time goes we can pray at any time I think we might misunderstand that we can pray wrong though there is a wrong way to pray and because we know that it's always appropriate it's can happen at any time we might not understand that there is a prayer that is incorrect and James deals with it in James chapter 4 if we'll go back to it just for a moment can't find James tonight for some reason and it says here you have not because you ask not you ask and receive not because you ask a Miss now that word a Miss is used in many places throughout the Bible the Greek word there and it's it's used for a sickness it's it's used for uh it's wrong you ask wrong and many of the people that come to Jesus to be healed they use this word they were aiss they were sick so our prayers can be you know the one interpretation is it it's sick it's not a healthy prayer and why is that that you may consume it upon your lust so you're you're praying for something so it can advance you versus advancing God's perfect will in your life so we shouldn't be you know I'm praying for this position on my job so that I can make more money or I can live in a bigger house or but that I you know you know that's that can be that can be misguided that can be misguided he says that you pray and you're not getting what you ask for because your prayer is prayed with the wrong motive and I think that our prayer we really should internalize what we doing when we pray prayer prayer is an act adjective prayer is not something that or it's a verb it's not something that you just you know you're just thinking about the next day's task or the conversations of the Day prayer is getting in the channel of the spirit so the Holy Spirit can get a hold of you and pray things that you normally wouldn't pray for prayer isn't about you getting more money so you can have this that and the other sometimes we want the power of God in our life for the wrong reason I'm going to show you that in the scripture here in just in a moment and so you know what's your motive and what you're praying for Lord I need this or I want this and you're not getting it your prayers are not being heard because you pray aiss now the other reason why we're not getting what we asked for because we don't ask you said brother Israel there's nobody from my job ever comes to church but how many people did you ask when was the last time shame on us now for a minute I'm G give you a shame moment when was the last time we invited someone to church from our neighborhood from our job from our class or whatever and you know if you don't ask that's probably a good reason why you wouldn't get it you say well brother Israel we got to keep it professional on our job you know we got to keep it professional I don't want to you know you know religion and and how much money people make and who you vote for those are kind of personal questions right George how much money you make n how much money you got in the bank like wa over this bro I love you but man you getting you know who' you vote for who would I vote for why you know this and getting out of personal and we made that personal because the world out there has made it personal about people's soul and if they come into church or not or where they go to church or is everything go right with you and the Lord we have something to offer them and you know a good portion of the reason why according to the scripture here we don't have have is because we don't ask you don't have it because you didn't ask for it now Elisha asked for a hard thing but the lord gave it to him didn't he and when Elisha asked for that how many people after that would have loved now to think of asking for something like that and you know uh this is how this this the you know th those those those um those desires come from somewhere you know he ask him what can I do for you today a double portion of your spirit that's what I want so the Lord granted that to him and so we know in the scripture here in Acts chapter 1 verse eight that it's the holy ghost that comes upon us is where we receive the power and this power is the power to live a clean Christian Life we need this power in our life and this is not a one-time event that the Holy Ghost comes upon you and you receive power this can this is unlimited now it's up to you do you want more power have you asked for more power do you feel that you need more power this is a cry this is a prayer that is in my heart this is not a prayer where I'm asking other people is it okay to pray for this is a prayer that I'm asking for for myself personally I would love for everyone else to ask for that prayer I would love for everyone in the church to get the same burden same vision but if they don't I'm going to ask for myself Lord give me another portion of the power of God in my life so that the power of God increases in my life the way I I pray I want it more powerful the way I preach more powerful the way I believe the way I see the word more powerful and you have not because you ask not now this scripture in Acts chapter 8 deals with this uh gentleman Simon go there quickly he is very interesting character here how what God is done through this example in Acts chapter chapter 8 if you want to turn there uh well I'm going to ask you not to turn there just this one time this is one of the rare times I'm going tell you not to turn there in your Bible but if they can just pick up on the screen acts 8 and verse number is it 19 yes acts 8:19 thank you brother somebody following me look at this who says this saying give me also this power that whomsoever I lay hands he may receive the Holy Ghost powerful prayer when you say powerful request this is a man or a woman asking for the power of God so when I lay hands on somebody they received the Holy Ghost how could that be wrong how could that be wrong see what's wrong is his motive and his objective the prayer is right but his motive is wrong and this man had already been baptized he was a sorcerer he repented he got baptized he followed Phillip and he saw the moving of the Holy Ghost working upon the people and this is what his prayer was but now let's go a little bit further in the scripture there and look at how Peter handled him and he says verse he says give me all this also this power that whomsoever I lay hands he may receive the Holy Ghost but Peter said unto him thy money perish with thee because thou has thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money thou Hast neither part nor lot in this matter for your heart is not right in the sight of God repent therefore of this wickedness and pray God if perhaps thou the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee for I perceive that thou are in a gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity then answered Simon and said pray ye that the Lord for me that none of these things which you spoken pray for me pray for me he he repented but you know he's asking for the power power of God to come on him so that whoever he lays hands on they too would receive the Holy Ghost but it's the wrong motive it's the wrong objective I wonder if this can be applied to Ministries today who study deeper subjects with the wrong motive in mind they want to be interesting they want to be they want to stand above the crowd they want to be better than the next fellow they want more they want they want their Church to grow not be so the kingdom of God can grow they want it to grow so we can say I have 300 people here now our church is bigger than it was last year the motive is not right is it good for a church to grow yes is it good for the Holy Ghost to follow somebody yes but if my motive is wrong it would be better that no power would come upon me and my heart will stay right before God Before He blesses me any further because you can get in trouble with these things you get lifted up you start thinking it's you doing the healing it's you that's doing it's you that's the anointing it's you your bigger it's happened to Greater men than you and I greater men than you and I so do we want the power of God in our life yes but not without the humility not without the love of God not without submitting oursel to every word of God amen amen so so Lord increase this power in my life but let it come with your grace and your mercy yes let my face remain in the dust of nothing and knowing where I come from Lord Keep Me in the humility that's required to be a true servant of the most high God because many times when God blesses a man or a woman most of the time it gets them off track it gets them they get Sidetrack they get a little better position they get a little bit more money they get more blessed and you see their attitude change I've seen it I've seen it someone working in their little Ministry or whatever it is and then they can play the piano kind of good and then they start learning to play better or the organ or song leading or preaching whatever it is and they start learning to get PR and then that little Spirit of pride gets in there have you seen that yes if you look in the mirror you might see it yes just as soon as the anointing comes as a blessing comes and you get raised up and you know it's oh yeah this is good this is a gift now and you start to recognize that you got to fall down on your knes if you ever needed a prayer meeting it's when God blesses you get back to the Altar and humble yourself when God shows you something humble yourself every time he blesses you fall down on your knees tell them thank you tell them I'm not worthy of it but give me more Lord absolutely that's the right attitude any other attitude you're out of here like I said greater men than you and I we've seen them fall I'm not even going in the Bible I'm not even go I'm not even going to go secular I'm going to look right in the Realms of our message you can look around in whatever country including this one as some of the big name Ministries who have grown preaching the message and after 10 years 15 years something comes out of their camp and you're like what did that come from it's off it's off the word we've seen it we act like we a't seen we've seen it I've seen it with my eyes and you wonder how how could it be you started so humble you had nothing then your church grew then you have to buy a bigger church then a buy a bigger and then you and then people streaming and more people streaming and you start a second church and the third church and then before you know it they know more about it than the prophets I've seen it too many times amen so it would be foolish for us not to think that that is a tremendous Trav yes siren we want more power but for what what I want more power for I want more power so I can make the Rapture and the Rapture ain't coming with no Spirit of Pride thinking we're greater and better amen so let's take one more example it's in Acts chapter number 19 these Sons seven sons of ska verse number 11 and God wrought special Miracles by the hands of Paul so that from his body were brought so let's go back to Acts chapter 8 for a minute I don't want to miss this Acts chapter 8 so here Simon repents verse 24 then Simon answered and said pray ye to the Lord for me that none of these things which have spoke which ye have spoken come upon me and they when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord returned to Jerusalem and preached the gospel in many villages of Samaria so we see that the word of the Lord continues on and this man got the correction that he needed Acts chapter 19 quickly and God wrough special Miracles by the hand of Paul so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs and aprons and diseases departed from them and evil spirits went out of them then certain of the babon Jews exorcists took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus saying we adure you by Jesus whom Paul preached and there were seven sons of ska of one ska a Jew a chief of the priests which did so and the evil spirit answered and said Jesus I know Paul I know but who are you and the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of the house naked and wounded one translation says the man gave them a beating that one man put his hands on them all seven of them when he got done left him wounded beating and naked what were they trying to do so the power of God is above any other power all the other powers are underneath that power it's the power of the Holy Ghost it's got the power over demons Devils the Dark World and the dark things of the world and God gives you power over that but here these men now approach this demon this evil possessed man and wants to cast him out I wonder if they would have just left him alone the demon maybe would have just left him alone but they approach him wanting to cast this devil out of him by way of Paul and Jesus and this demon knew Jesus I wonder how he knew Jesus this demon knew Paul I wonder how it knew Paul yes knew them says I know Jesus and I know Paul but who are you and this demon attacked them and beat them showing that they didn't have the power over this demon like they thought they would have had I mean it looked great to to cast him out but they didn't have the power to do it and this was known verse 17 this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus and fear fell on all and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified and many that believed came and confessed and showed their deeds many of them also which used curious Arts brought their books together and burned them before all men and they counted the price of them and founded 50,000 pieces of silver silver so mightily grew the word of God and Prevail so how does the word grow the RO word grows in its effect as it manifests as others receive it that same word we want that word to grow in us too now we I'll take a few places here in the message message and of course Romans 8:26 tells us that we don't know what to pray for but the spirit gives us what to pray for with groanings that cannot be uttered in the message first Peter 3 or or in the scripture 1 Peter 3 1-8 it says of course is talking about wives being subject to their own husbands those that don't obey the word they may without the word be won by their conversations he talking about how the wives they should you know their their their their their conversation they're being watched should be coupled with fear how they should Adorn themselves but look at verse S it says likewise your husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel as being HS together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered and so we this is where we want to really approach our prayers with the with the correct attitude that my motive for what I'm asking for is a scriptural motive there's a scriptural reason for it but then my heart 's motive behind that scripture manifestation what really is that what really am I asking for Lord if you bless me to sing with the power of the anointing well if he did that would that change would that change you would that cause you to now start to look at yourself in a way that's that's aiss it's sickly it's not healthy it's not the road to uh you know to um to a complete H adoption our body change remember we have a body change first and then there's a Rapture our next move is a body change so as we pray we get into the spirit of prayer we have not because we ask not and we ask and don't receive because we ask aiss the reason why we're asking I think that needs to be on the examination table I think that needs to be really at the Forefront of what I'm asking for and why why is it my prayers being answer what's going on here husbands treat your wives so that your prayers be not hinder these little points in the word are all part of this prayer and our prayer life how it connects to the power of God in our life and so you know that's the value of a little little prayer meeting or a time in prayer the prophet of God says this in the message Jesus on the authority of the word 1954 he says for instance many times there are people come in the line and I pray for them I never know what's going to happen I just pray for them and there is a power in prayer prayer will even change the word of God that was a striker wasn't it but it's the truth the word of the Lord and he goes and he tells that story about Isaiah and Hezekiah and the message expectations he says this here paragraph number six right at the beginning of the message he says now a minister any Minister has just as much right to pray for the sick or Ley just as much as anyone else because he said confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you might or may be healed for the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much I do believe that there's power in prayer I've seen some very direct answers to prayer but never healed anybody in my life but I've seen God do a lot of it so I believe that it's the individual's faith in a work that's already been completed Amen brother bam continues in the message the token and he says this here talking about the Holy Ghost which is the token he says that the token paragraph 338 the token is a sign that the purchase has been made and been accepted now you can't get the token from the railroad Fair until you pay the price and the only way you're going to you're going to pay the price is pay it that's right what believe it accept it full obedience to the whole word of God will entitle you to the Token full obedience not the part of it as far as your denomination goes but all of it full obedience to the word which is Christ brings you into Christ amen that's in the message the token he continues on in paragraph 349 maybe it's a different number back there but it's in the message to the Token 1960 um 1963 I believe it is at any rate he says when we pray then we must present the token Lord I have obeyed you fully I have repented of my sins I feel that you have forgiven me I've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ the holy spirit is upon me now I have need of certain thing a certain thing for your glory Lord I ask for it it's mine now then there is something anchors back here pH it's yours that does it then it's all over it's all over it's settled I asked for this I ask for it I must have it see see I want it For Your Glory Glory see well that's it then he just gives it to you then you know it's yours that's the way it is our children so forth we apply the blood believe it that's all right amen so we know that full obedience to the whole word of God entitles us to the Token complete full obedience to the word the whole word of God entitles us to the token and then when we have the token we present the token in our prayers like we're going to do tonight and then we we have something that we we're actually we have a goal we have we pick a spot we have a Target it's not random it's like you know like I gave the example here before like when the first deer I shot uh the brother that took me out there is out here and I was so excited i' been to the SHO shooting range I cided the gun in and I knew how to shoot I had a good little idea and then we go up early we ready looking for something we finally see a deer and I was ready to shoot and then the brother he said uh okay where you gonna shoot it at I was like oh okay yeah I gotta pick a spot don't I yes so it's you know you you got all the preparation there you have the gun set you see the animal now pick a spot that you're going for it's specific it's not random it's like well maybe I'll hit it or maybe I won't no no it's a you pick your spot you call that name out of that child or co-worker or spouse you call their name out don't be afraid to ask God to do the miraculous and to do what is impossible to be done and you you present that and and why are you asking for it what is your motive behind it Lord I Want It For Your Glory I want your name to be glorified I want to be able to give a testimony of your power and your glory that you're the same yesterday today and forever amen you find that spot you pick that spot and you squee off that shot and if you missed then you do it again you try it again if you missed then come back next year and try it again you keep going until you hit the target and that's the way our prayers are they're very specific it's not random it's not you know we we're just going to go to sleep we're g you know you know we go down our knees the soft music will play I'll kind of look over this way I look are they done praying is everybody done then I'm done no that ain't prayer no are you praying who you praying to what are you praying about what are you zeroed in on what is the motive and the objective to it and then we know that in prayer is where God will give us more power in the message what was the Holy Ghost given for the prophet of God says this here paragraph 94 that's the purpose of the Holy Ghost that's what God sent the Holy Ghost for the Holy Ghost come to give you power I got so much so more scriptures here just a minute the Holy Ghost come to give you power you can find this I'm just too much away tonight give you power power in prayer you take a person that's lived a good life but they're always defeated or tell you're a good person oh sure I love the Lord but brother bandom always defeated they never get a prayer answer you feel that little woman with the Holy Ghost one time watch what takes place when she goes before God she's not defeated she comes boldly to the throne of God believing she has a right because she's a daughter of God by a birth take that little man so cowardly that the bosss kick him all over the place say wait a minute here now something changed see he's got the Holy Ghost it gives you power your life is full of power it gives you power in your speech amen he gives you the power yes he says it again yes he'll give you power the power in prayer that's what he'll do and that's what the Holy Ghost was given for and you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you it's another horse power another level of power that we all need this is the power that's going to Rapture us this is the power before the Rapture that's going to change change our bodies it will Quicken our mortal bodies so why is there this huge gap between the holy ghost coming Upon Our natural bodies and then we think the Rapture just going to happen like that and we resist the power of God all the time or don't even ask for it not expecting it don't pray for it in the Holy Ghost there is power and we need that power you know that Holy Ghost Power attracts the attention of three kinds of Believers it does but it's for the True Believer and this is what I am Desiring this is what we need in our church uh uh this is what we need in our Ministries this is what we need every time we meet every service we need the power of God In Our Song service the power of God in our preachings the after the sermon the power of God the fall on the Altar and then those hearts the power of God coming upon people and they begin to change their ways and change their life we don't need to pray for more power we need to live such a Godly life he says we don't need more power we need to surrender and control that life so that the power of God that's in you can can come to a greater manifestation that's our desire and I believe that's real prayer that's a true prayer you say brother Israel I got all I need that's on you that's on you but I believe for me for me I'm praying God to give me a double portion another portion like the the the anointing that I hear on the tapes that prayer line that discernment I don't have the gift of discernment but I want the power that's causing that discernment to work I want that in my prayer closet I want that in my Ministry I want that in my life so that he would be glorified and let me say it like this if getting more power is going to cause me to be a stuffed shirt or to backslide then I don't want no more power I don't and and I don't want the power until I can handle it I don't want more power or more anointing till I can handle it so I want my life crucified with Christ I want a humble my ways I really want to look deep into the heart of what I really want what I really desire for this church for my family for my own little life really what do I really really want I want it for a name do I want my children saved just so they don't embarrass me or do I want them saved so I can be with him in the eternities you want your family members saved so you can brag and say my old families in or do you want your family saved for the glory of God you want to see the church full so we can say we got the biggest church we got more people than last year or do we really internalize seeing another Soul come to the kingdom of God Simon wanted to lay hands so somebody would receive the Holy Ghost and he was in the bitter G he was in the evil dark place and he needed to repent and just writing it down it was a pretty you know decent re I want to lay hands so people receive the Holy Ghost your motive isn't right you need to repent that's what that's what that's what Peter told him I want us to internalize that so how what's our approach when we come to prayer now what's our approach first thing we should do brother brandom says we should start our prayer with worship you get into the spirit of worship father I love you I thank you you're my father it's our approach of course he's a friend like no other of course you'll be your brother your sister but Jesus said they said teach us how to pray not just to pray but how to pray he says when you pray say our father the approach is right just don't run up and call you know somebody you know that he's a he's a pastor or Reverend or brother or sister you just don't call him by their first name you don't know him like that come with respect just in the natural you come before God there's a respect there's a reverence and Our Father which are in heaven holy is your name thy will be done not my will thy kingdom come the the power and all the glory is thine this is the right approach you know coming and Wheeling God around so you can get a bigger contract so you can have a bigger truck than the next fellow on your street and you can have a better this and that that's the American way and and we get influenced by that huh am I right Saints is it wrong to have a big truck no go get it it's fine long it's it's a Ford I mean I mean you can get whatever that's not the point whether it's a truck or car or moped whatever it is a scooter but if your motive isn't right then you ain't right you're just not right we want the power of God want the anointed to come in our church we want the we want the people see pour out of the Holy Ghost for what bragging rights no no no no no no no Lord help us get our approach right and then in prayer there is power God bless you so much we'll take some time and go to the Lord in prayer tonight we had a few requests here brother Valdez David David Valdez he had a request here for protection for his family healing for sick that's Angels uh uh stepfather there angel had his surgery and pray that the Lord will bring bring his through his recovery he's praying for his family
