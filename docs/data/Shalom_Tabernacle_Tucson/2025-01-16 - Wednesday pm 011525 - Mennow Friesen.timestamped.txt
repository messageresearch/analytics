[22:09] God beside thee there is none though
[22:12] many have claimed to
[22:14] be but you never fail and your word
[22:17] stands sure heavens and earth will pass
[22:20] away from this
[22:23] condition but your word will never pass

[22:30] and we believe tonight is a part of that
[22:32] fulfilling we're standing here in your
[22:35] grace standing here the what we believe
[22:37] is the brink of a new
[22:40] dispensation a new kingdom coming where
[22:42] there'll be no more sin or sickness
[22:44] trials and tests but as long as we're
[22:47] here we sing that song through many

[23:00] home thank you Lord for your mercy bless
[23:03] us tonight around your word Lord just
[23:05] one word from you changes the whole
[23:08] condition Lord so as we surrender to you
[23:11] now through the singing and the song
[23:13] leader and the musics and everyone's
[23:16] done their little part to see that you
[23:18] would would get the atmosphere right
[23:20] where you'd come and bless your children
[23:22] I commit them to you not only here but
[23:24] the sister churches in the Tucson area
[23:27] the round area Lord maybe they gathered

[23:32] well bless your word now we pray humbly
[23:35] in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God
[23:39] bless you you can be
[23:40] seated and um I want to greet you
[23:43] tonight it's good to be
[23:45] here always good Tucson always holds a
[23:48] real uh well I uh I was kind of
[23:52] reminiscing to myself today I you know
[23:55] I've come we've come here the first time
[23:57] and back in ' 69
[23:59] and uh a few uh Winters have gone by
[24:03] since' 69 and uh many a precious person
[24:07] I was trying to look through some of
[24:09] them you know and all of the names the
[24:12] uh well they leave me by now but people
[24:14] that we've met over the years and
[24:16] sometimes thinking there must be more on
[24:17] the other side than there's living of
[24:20] the elect lady they most all the whole
[24:21] generation passed away and uh and some
[24:24] of us are bumping that generation real
[24:27] close
[24:29] we might I don't know how many of us
[24:30] will still pass away before the Rapture
[24:33] takes place but um good thing is we know
[24:36] that death has no part in this to them
[24:39] that are in Christ There Is No Death and
[24:42] just a change of dispensation I like the
[24:44] way brother Ram said is just a change of
[24:47] address and um I've been having the same
[24:50] address for what
[24:51] 40 44 years 45 years um it'll kind of be
[24:56] nice to have a new plaque hanging out
[24:58] out there different
[24:59] address the kingdoms of this world will
[25:02] soon before for and fall we shall see
[25:03] the King when he comes than of the
[25:06] precious people here I was uh you know
[25:09] of course brother Israel here the uh the
[25:11] work here the labor that God puts in
[25:13] heart it's it's interesting to know I've
[25:16] always looked at sometimes we count it
[25:19] kind of complicated sometimes but he
[25:21] said the steps of the Lord the steps of
[25:24] the righteous are ordered of the Lord
[25:27] pretty good order isn't it I know we can
[25:30] put it in order sometimes and we don't
[25:31] get what we order but God always gets
[25:34] what he orders and sometimes we wonder
[25:37] why God put us over here for our reason
[25:40] we were reminiscing a bunch of us are
[25:42] sitting around the table Kim you didn't
[25:44] get to be there but um we we did talk
[25:47] about you a little bit but it was good
[25:50] yeah and uh he's my
[25:53] uh close friend although we live miles
[25:56] and miles apart but we've brother dly as
[25:58] well good to see you Brothers here and
[26:00] sister good to see you and uh but we
[26:03] were talking reminiscing about some of
[26:05] the things and and uh you know sitting
[26:08] about there's about 12 of us around the
[26:10] table I thought must have been like the
[26:11] Lord Jesus uh sitting with his disciples
[26:14] sometimes and we begin to talk about the
[26:16] things brother Ron Peterson myself and
[26:18] some of the other brothers were talking
[26:19] about the things and how that the steps
[26:21] have been ordered in a different way and
[26:23] we marveled how did we get where we were
[26:25] at and it's amazing how sometimes you
[26:29] think through through many dangers toils
[26:31] and snares there's way more to it than
[26:32] just singing the song when you realize
[26:35] what happens that God infinitely by
[26:38] divine nature that he knows them that
[26:39] are his and he can't lose one and I want
[26:42] to just maybe just I don't remember what
[26:45] I preached last time maybe I'll take the
[26:46] same notes and if I I don't have too
[26:49] many notes really they are pretty much
[26:50] all the same just change scriptures and
[26:53] but do you know there is only one note
[26:55] really isn't
[26:56] it you know you start you you can start
[26:58] in Genesis and end up in Revelations you
[27:00] start in Revelations end up in Genesis
[27:02] it's the same self same Living God the
[27:05] same entity the same God that started
[27:07] the work has been working and he's
[27:11] enjoyed his work I know that because he
[27:13] laid it out and it was his
[27:15] pleasure you know it was his good
[27:17] pleasure to save you it was his good
[27:20] pleasure to go and let you and me and I
[27:24] you and I go through the the the tests
[27:26] and the trials that makes up
[27:28] the shape that we need to have there's
[27:31] not not one of the trials we ever go
[27:33] through is there to destroy us it's
[27:35] there to mold and shape in the place to
[27:37] where we are just tuned just right when
[27:40] you look at the tuner uh this year uh is
[27:43] a pretty good tuner and uh and I I like
[27:46] the way the prophet said when you look
[27:48] into this Bible you should be able to
[27:50] see
[27:52] yourself as in the mirror of God and he
[27:56] said the evidence of having the Holy
[27:57] Ghost is to believe every word in its
[28:00] season when it's Vindicated made
[28:03] flesh oh I like that the word made flesh
[28:06] that's what God has always dwelt in in
[28:08] flesh vessels unworthy as we were why
[28:12] I'm going to read a little from from the
[28:14] scripture but but that's what I believe
[28:17] this message has done and uh I hear the
[28:19] prophet say uh when he gets to the third
[28:22] pull of his ministry is so profound how
[28:25] God has separated the people for his own
[28:27] name and and he gets to the place and
[28:28] said and the rest of the world knows
[28:30] nothing of what God is being revealed to
[28:32] us knows nothing to keep around they
[28:34] know nothing about the church ages they
[28:36] know nothing about The Messengers to the
[28:37] AG they know nothing about the spirit of
[28:39] God moving from glory to glory to glory
[28:42] to glory they say oh it's the same thing

[30:38] to rest so in the Lord say Lord I have
[30:41] waited for this glorious
[30:44] moment the changing of address I want to
[30:47] read Ephesians if I could Wednesday
[30:49] night we'll do it
[30:52] quick but I know that one word spoken in
[30:56] due season is better than a thousand
[30:58] spoken out of season so let's read the
[31:00] word if you would why don't you stand
[31:01] with me I'm going to read Ephesians the
[31:03] 2 chapter and I'm going to drop in just
[31:06] a little bit because I uh round the eth
[31:08] verse and uh
[31:11] draw just a few words from there I love
[31:13] that part how he begins there and uh
[31:17] says for by grace are ye saved through
[31:21] faith and that not of yourselves it is
[31:24] the gift of God not of Works lest any of
[31:28] of any man should boast for we are his
[31:31] workmanship created in Christ Jesus I
[31:34] like the way he puts it it's not about
[31:37] Christ Jesus or perhaps around him but
[31:40] in Christ Jesus unto good works which
[31:44] God hath before ordained that we should
[31:46] walk in them wherefore remember that ye
[31:50] being in time past Gentiles In the
[31:53] Flesh who are called
[31:56] uncircumcision by that which is called
[31:58] the circumcision in the flesh made by
[32:01] hands that at that time ye were without
[32:06] Christ I want you to just just listen to
[32:08] this very closely being aliens from the
[32:12] Commonwealth of Israel and strangers
[32:16] from the covenants of Promise could you
[32:18] imagine this evening if you here you
[32:20] didn't have one promise to you not one
[32:24] Covenant belonged to you to me I
[32:28] couldn't base one thing upon anything
[32:30] that it is promised I couldn't say that
[32:32] there was nothing promised to we were
[32:34] Gentiles we had no hope look what he
[32:37] says that in that time ye were without
[32:40] Christ being aliens from the
[32:42] Commonwealth of Israel strangers from
[32:44] the covenants of Promise having no hope
[32:47] without God in the
[32:50] world do that make you want to cry out
[32:52] said oh God how
[32:56] merciful but now now in Christ Jesus ye
[32:59] have become ye who sometimes were far
[33:01] off are made nigh by the blood of Christ
[33:05] for he is our peace who hath made both
[33:08] one ha broken down the middle wall of
[33:10] petition between us having abolished I
[33:14] like that word in his flesh the enmity
[33:17] even the law of Commandments contained
[33:20] in
[33:21] ordinances for to make in himself of
[33:25] Twain one new man Soul making
[33:28] peace and that he might reconcile both
[33:31] unto God in one body by the cross having
[33:34] slain the enmity thereby and came and
[33:37] preached peace to you which were a far
[33:40] off and to them that are nigh for
[33:42] through him we both have excess by one
[33:45] Spirit unto the father now therefore we
[33:48] are no more strangers or foreigners but
[33:51] fellow citizens with the Saints and of
[33:53] the household of God I like that and I
[33:57] built upon on the foundation of the
[33:58] Apostles and
[34:00] Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the
[34:02] Chief Cornerstone in whom all the
[34:04] building fitly framed together the
[34:06] growth unto a holy Temple in the Lord in
[34:09] whom ye also are builded together for an
[34:13] habitation of God through the spirit God
[34:16] bless his word as you're
[34:18] seated I I just wanted to read that as a
[34:21] good foundation and and maybe just uh uh
[34:24] pick up one little quote if I could that
[34:26] uh brother Bram so beautifully declares
[34:29] and I know you've all uh
[34:31] undoubtedly have uh read it many times
[34:34] and uh but it's in one of the invis
[34:36] invisible Union and uh brother brah
[34:40] makes some wonderful comments concerning
[34:43] the reality of what the Holy Spirit has
[34:45] been doing all through life he his grace
[34:49] and let me just read it and you'll
[34:50] understand he said oh the spiritual
[34:52] union of Christ and his church now when
[34:54] the flesh has become word and the word
[34:56] is becoming flesh
[34:58] manifested Vindicated just what the
[35:00] Bible said would happen in the last days
[35:03] it's happening day by day he said why
[35:07] it's accumulating so fast out there in
[35:08] the desert and things taking place that
[35:10] I couldn't even keep up with it we're
[35:12] near the coming of Jesus
[35:15] Christ now not the appearing the coming
[35:18] changing of the bodies we've been living
[35:20] under the shadow under the presence of
[35:22] the appearing all these the pillar fire
[35:24] still leading the CH the the elect lady
[35:28] brother B says when it leaves we
[35:30] leave
[35:32] Amen to be United with the church where
[35:35] the word becomes the word call of the
[35:38] Holy Spirit searching the hearts you're
[35:41] standing completely you never sin in the
[35:43] first
[35:45] place I just let it let it soak into
[35:47] your heart now you don't have to do
[35:48] anything if you if you just say
[35:51] something you feel like saying Oh Me Oh
[35:53] My yeah that's
[35:54] me that's what I like to do now I'm
[35:57] reading to myself
[36:00] here I'm standing
[36:02] complete I've never sinned in the first
[36:05] place say oh you're not bragging no
[36:07] you've never said God don't even know
[36:09] now here's a little comment somebody
[36:11] should get get pretty excited about but
[36:13] from period to period it says God
[36:14] doesn't even know
[36:17] nothing that's how some people interpret
[36:19] the message sometimes now that's I'm
[36:21] reading it here God don't even know
[36:25] nothing wait a minute
[36:29] he doesn't know nothing about our
[36:31] sin it's in the sea of God's
[36:33] forgetfulness you never did it you were
[36:37] accused of it by the accuser but really
[36:40] from the beginning you were
[36:41] predestinated to be a son and a daughter
[36:43] of God you're standing there washed and
[36:46] your old book of
[36:48] divorcement is put out of the way and
[36:50] it's dead absolutely out of existence
[36:53] even in the mind of God
[36:57] now who's going to who's going to point
[36:59] a
[37:00] finger if he says they did this they did
[37:03] that this I don't even I don't even know
[37:05] what you're talking
[37:06] about remember that little song they
[37:08] used to sing and uh I forget the words
[37:11] but it said you know the devil stood
[37:13] before him accuse the accuser and come
[37:15] before the Lord and he said and the man
[37:17] had made the man woman had made it right
[37:19] with the Lord and confessed her sin and
[37:21] and the the Lord said back said what
[37:22] sins are you talking
[37:25] about I don't see any M You're The
[37:28] Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the
[37:30] blood of Jesus Christ now if we are
[37:32] Christians today tonight if we are Sons
[37:34] and Daughters of God we know we've
[37:36] repented we've been baptized we believe
[37:37] this message and the Absolut is to
[37:39] Absolut is to believe every Vindicated
[37:41] word in this day when God vindicates his
[37:43] word makes it live again not Reformation
[37:46] but restoration being restored back to
[37:49] the original Faith
[37:54] amen you're the precious virtuous
[37:56] sinless son Son of God standing with the
[37:58] pure unadulterated word bride or bride
[38:01] word that he Washed by the Water of his
[38:04] own blood that become flesh and
[38:06] manifested that he might take you which
[38:08] were predestined in the bosom of the
[38:12] father what did Jesus say I come from
[38:14] God and I go back I come from the Boos
[38:15] of God I go back to God where do we go
[38:18] back to where we came out
[38:21] of predestinated in the bosom of the
[38:24] father before the
[38:25] beginning the same as he was he was the
[38:29] great attribute of God Called Love
[38:31] whatever you are you are a servant of
[38:34] God whatever God wants you to do where
[38:36] you where your place is God placed you
[38:38] in the church someplace Apostles and
[38:41] Prophets teachers and pastors I like
[38:43] what brother Braham said and I believe
[38:45] this is the truth you say why am I going
[38:47] to church
[38:49] here I like the way brother Braham said
[38:51] find yourself the most spiritual church
[38:54] and go there support it with all your
[38:56] heart your finances your prayers
[38:59] whatever you can do then don't criticize
[39:01] the other one that's a good one to
[39:04] be don't you know it doesn't make us any
[39:07] bigger if we criticize somebody now
[39:10] criticize sin and
[39:12] unbelief as the doctrine comes along the
[39:14] message I'm not saying you oh well
[39:16] they're all nice people no they're not
[39:17] all nice
[39:19] people Satan's not a very nice person
[39:22] sir he is a deceiver and his whole
[39:25] program is deception
[39:28] he has never forced or raped anybody he
[39:31] just makes them
[39:33] willing he is that's what happened to
[39:36] Eve happened to Eve he tricked her
[39:39] deceived her look at the prophet when he
[39:41] comes to this last day I indict this
[39:43] generation for what for the second
[39:45] crucifixion of the of Jesus Christ not
[39:47] the blood the blood
[39:50] word They Crucified the effect of this
[39:52] word to the people so that if they could
[39:54] have been saved they didn't even want
[39:56] that oh
[40:00] no whatever you are you're a servant of
[40:03] God whatever God wants you to do where
[40:05] your places God places in the church
[40:08] some Apostles prophets teachers he
[40:10] placed that by virtue of his own
[40:12] predestination and you were that to
[40:15] begin with I like how brother bam said
[40:17] so many times we think oh I can't be
[40:19] this oh if I could be like that he said
[40:21] if you're a humble housewife a
[40:25] farmer maybe don't have one spirit
[40:27] spirital gift you come to church all
[40:28] your life I've I've I've been I was
[40:30] raised in this church among men andite
[40:32] people hardwork and farming
[40:36] people sometimes you don't have to know
[40:38] when a certain person came into the the
[40:39] church you could
[40:43] smelling he just came out of the hog
[40:45] Barn before he check his final hog see
[40:47] how they were doing before he came to
[40:48] church it was my
[40:52] uncle nobody if he came in after on a
[40:55] Wednesday night you always knew when he
[40:56] came in
[40:58] he couldn't smell it cuz he was just
[40:59] part of the
[41:01] Hogs you know I like what brother said
[41:04] sometimes you know we we smell alike you
[41:06] know and we and that's why we talk alike
[41:08] and we eat the same food and we act like
[41:10] we're just we're just Humble Home people
[41:14] just love the things that God loves you
[41:16] know pastures with you shepherd with a
[41:19] sheep you know he's not sitting up there
[41:21] in some rocking chair all you know like
[41:23] in oh there goes my sheep there goes my
[41:25] sheep no he goth before them
[41:28] he walks with
[41:30] us he talks with
[41:32] us a little while the world will see me
[41:35] no more but you'll see me for I will be
[41:37] with you even in
[41:39] you oh I know we sing about him being
[41:42] with us and so on that's wonderful but
[41:43] it's greater for him to be in you do you
[41:46] know brother Bram says when he quotes
[41:47] that scripture greater is he that's in
[41:49] you than he that's in the world he said
[41:50] did you know that the one that's in you
[41:52] as a real believer has already overcome
[41:55] all sin over overcame all sickness
[41:59] overcame all doubt all fear he that's in
[42:02] you is greater he said he that's in you
[42:04] is already overcome that in
[42:07] you all we have to do is recognize that
[42:10] he's the
[42:11] Overcomer whatever you are that by The
[42:15] Virtue by predestination you are that to
[42:17] begin with oh I like this your first
[42:19] wedding is an old it was you never done
[42:22] it remember brother Braham said I'm
[42:24] taking going to predict the message
[42:26] sound like I'm preaching on Mar and
[42:27] divorce he said but the first husband
[42:28] must be dead before you could be
[42:30] remarried or married again he takes it
[42:33] to the church your old husband
[42:35] denomination has to be
[42:37] dead before before you can marry The
[42:40] Virtuous word Son of God and he said in
[42:44] the first place because there's only one
[42:46] thing could do it that would be God come
[42:49] down himself and took your place in the
[42:51] form of the Son of God Jesus Christ and
[42:53] washed you by the water of the washing
[42:56] of the word by the word Water by the
[42:58] word the word not the denomination the
[43:00] word washed you but if you want stand in
[43:04] the water of the word now here's the
[43:07] warning anybody that won't stand in the
[43:09] water of the washing of the word how can
[43:11] he wash you how can how can we be washed
[43:14] you're still as spotted as Eve was dear
[43:17] dying lamb thy Precious Blood shall
[43:19] never lose its power till all the ransom
[43:21] Church of God be saved to sin no more
[43:23] what is sin sin is unbelief unbelief is
[43:25] what the word unbelief in God which is
[43:27] the word that's it sometimes say well I
[43:31] don't understand it just say I believe
[43:32] it
[43:33] anyhow in fact I doubt very much that
[43:37] too many of us understand very much at
[43:42] all how would we even explain the
[43:45] Eternal thing of
[43:46] God you know when I sometimes I get a
[43:49] little bit I try to be funny it's not
[43:51] always funny but wife and I were driving
[43:54] and we were going to Ohio in Spring and
[43:56] we've been driving for for 3
[43:59] days and uh I was kind of wanting to
[44:02] talk and and uh she was a little sleepy
[44:04] but I I started talking and so she she
[44:06] listened and I said isn't it funny I
[44:08] said just think for three days I've been
[44:10] driving
[44:12] east and I'm still not getting there
[44:15] wherever I am there I
[44:17] am it's still not west east north or
[44:20] south and I said we keep driving and
[44:22] driving and never going over said how
[44:24] come we're always up never down
[44:28] how come north the they don't change I
[44:31] said by now we should be leaning over
[44:33] this way because we're going downhill
[44:36] here I said well I don't know how the
[44:38] Chinese Drive even while we're driving
[44:40] here in the daytime they're hanging
[44:42] upside
[44:43] down that's about how we would look at
[44:45] that's about how I look I'm not include
[44:47] you all but that's how I look at at the
[44:49] word of God how do you explain the
[44:52] Eternal gravity of God how do you
[44:54] explain the way of the spirit
[44:57] how he Woos so one one person sitting
[44:59] right next to you and one person gets it
[45:00] another said I don't know what he's
[45:02] talking
[45:04] about we don't control that nobody
[45:08] controls that that's sovereignty of God
[45:10] and God ever reveals himself to you
[45:12] there's nothing can never change it you
[45:14] no no one can take it from you no one
[45:15] can preach you out of it or into it you
[45:18] know what I can't preach you into it no
[45:19] Pastor can do that he can only preach
[45:21] the word and say God there they are if
[45:24] it quickens to them it says amen within
[45:26] the soul said that's good that's a place
[45:28] to
[45:29] start but what but but you we we don't
[45:32] understand take the simple thing of the
[45:34] globe round oh I know science would
[45:36] explain it so
[45:39] beautifully but how is it created so
[45:42] perfect that you that you're never out
[45:45] of
[45:47] place you just keep on going flying you
[45:49] fly around the world come back again and
[45:51] you're up all the
[45:54] time just keeps moving oh yeah right
[45:57] so does the word of God how do we
[46:00] explain
[46:01] Revelation how do we explain Faith it's
[46:04] impossible if you could explain it it's
[46:06] not
[46:07] Faith but when you can explain said God
[46:09] said so I believe it that settles it if
[46:13] God says anything calls it the pure
[46:15] unadulterated oh Hallelujah leaving soon
[46:18] for the skies it goes un like that now
[46:21] that's a great mystery isn't
[46:23] it how these bodies are going to say
[46:26] well I know he can heal but change the
[46:29] complete chemistry of a
[46:32] body make it so that it can walk through
[46:36] the
[46:37] walls it can eat Jesus said have you got
[46:41] any fish here any food he ate the food
[46:43] what happened to the food when he went
[46:44] through the wall disappeared it was
[46:47] substance
[46:49] here explain that
[46:51] one that's the reason we don't explain
[46:53] it said Lord I believe
[46:58] Lord I believe all things are
[47:01] possible and brother Braham said if you
[47:03] will confess with the god in you who has
[47:06] done the overcoming with you confess
[47:08] that and say Lord I believe you've
[47:10] already overcome this sickness you've
[47:12] already come this temptation Amen in me
[47:15] now work it out through
[47:17] me you'll look with a different
[47:19] eye you'll see with a different
[47:22] heart when you look through God's word
[47:25] and see things as they are you know the
[47:28] whole picture changes you can look past
[47:31] the beautiful things of the world that
[47:32] are so
[47:34] enticing that's what I love about what
[47:36] the Holy Spirit does the one thing you
[47:39] be assured if God ever puts the Holy
[47:41] Ghost on you the desire of sin is
[47:44] gone that's something that leaves I
[47:46] didn't say the temptation of
[47:48] sin I said the
[47:50] desire for that's what he takes away
[47:53] that's the reason why say well oh but
[47:55] you know what you would have go over
[47:56] here their Church they allow this and
[47:58] they allow that the desire of unbelief
[48:00] is gone amen no church holds the right
[48:04] to any part of God's word for themselves
[48:07] for it is to the one that will believe
[48:09] it amen no Pastor has the right to hold
[48:13] people by his own but lead them to the
[48:16] word and there anchor them and if he
[48:19] anchors them in the word you know
[48:21] they're going to hold their ankle or
[48:22] hold let me just close here with this
[48:24] pure unadulterated said leaving for the
[48:27] sky soon standing ready think your
[48:29] garments Washed by the Water of the
[48:30] bleeding word the word became blood the
[48:33] word bled for you and you are washed in
[48:36] bleeding word and the word bleeding the
[48:39] life of God in the word and the Word was
[48:41] bled for you and you might that you
[48:43] might be washed from the filth of these
[48:47] prostitutes and be cleaned and
[48:49] Sanctified by the washing of the Water
[48:51] by the word and makes you make your mind
[48:53] and your heart stay on God and on his
[48:56] word oh I like that now how you know
[48:59] it's true God when God comes down and
[49:03] vindicates it and proves
[49:06] it church we are building every step
[49:10] that we're taking on a Vindicated word
[49:12] of this hour I hear Brother Braham stay
[49:15] so many times stand there and said I
[49:17] challenge the world over to come and
[49:20] stand with me upon the scripture here
[49:22] and see if God won't confirm his
[49:24] word in fact you did many times but you
[49:27] know what he left it off later you know
[49:29] why he didn't do it cuz that judgment
[49:31] wasn't to be
[49:33] then but they're coming to it let's we
[49:36] close here we're all the same said well
[49:39] you say well I don't believe that I
[49:41] don't believe it's that way they didn't
[49:43] believe that Jesus way either but God
[49:45] proved it they didn't believe it Noah's
[49:47] way they didn't believe it in Moses way
[49:51] they was willing to take balam's word
[49:53] for it right we're all the same so
[49:57] let's just associate
[49:59] together no let me tell you this
[50:02] separate yourself the Bible says from
[50:05] unbelief amen from unbelief no we're not
[50:08] all the
[50:10] same do you know that the prophet said
[50:12] very plainly said it's not given for
[50:15] everybody Jesus himself proved it
[50:17] constantly in his word how he proved it
[50:19] when he walked on the on the Earth but
[50:21] when he had finally got to the place
[50:23] where he knew his ministry is changing
[50:26] he began to say such strange things that
[50:28] just literally stumbled the people so
[50:31] much so that they they called him a
[50:33] cannibal said except you eat the Flesh
[50:35] of the Son of God and drink his blood
[50:37] you have no part of him now what would
[50:39] those people of the theologians of that
[50:42] day and the ones that were wise and and
[50:45] understood and studied all the ways of
[50:47] they claimed the
[50:49] spirit now to become eating human
[50:53] sacrifice why it was the furthest thing
[50:55] away from reality
[50:57] but I like what brother B said Jesus
[50:59] never explained
[51:00] it he said he does that to shake off
[51:04] sometimes say oh we want our church to
[51:05] grow shall we everybody wants to see
[51:07] Sinners
[51:09] saved everybody wants to see great move
[51:12] of God everywhere but remember you one
[51:15] thing you will you know search the
[51:17] scripture if watch the last part of
[51:18] brother Bam's Ministry he said you're
[51:20] going to see a falling away winding down
[51:22] oh I know around the world now because
[51:24] of the internet we know everywhere and
[51:26] there's God done Mighty work in the last
[51:28] 50
[51:29] years with a message that's already pure
[51:32] and they've this pure word has went
[51:34] around the world and pick up the elect
[51:36] lady there's nothing been added in the
[51:37] last 60 years to this messag amen it's
[51:41] catching that elect lady and every
[51:42] country Nation Kindred people and tongue
[51:45] and when they see it they come over here
[51:47] and preach the same message if they put
[51:49] their own Thoughts with it you'll find
[51:50] out real quickly and they do just like
[51:53] we have I'm say we I'm talking about we
[51:56] here
[51:57] on nor in North America how many people
[51:59] have taken this message and totally
[52:00] confused it and wound it right back down
[52:03] to where it's lost its Grace lost its
[52:05] power lost its
[52:07] reality become a man-made outa
[52:09] Hallelujah you notice you're not only
[52:12] that but you're going to the wedding in
[52:14] the sky and you are wearing the wedding
[52:17] band of predestination oh my so you see
[52:21] actually that's not very nice sometimes
[52:23] you don't like to make too hard
[52:27] but without being in the book before the
[52:29] foundation of the world it'll never be
[52:32] saved say well who are they no one
[52:36] knows except when the word strikes you
[52:39] for the scripture says and you hath he
[52:42] quickened Ephesians Made Alive we could
[52:44] read a little further
[52:46] there you hath the quickened there's a
[52:48] many isn't
[52:49] quickened look at the seed Jesus
[52:52] speaking about the
[52:53] seeds the word falling on different
[52:55] grounds but there's only one kind of a
[52:59] condition that brought forth of its kind
[53:01] right it was soil prepared for the seed
[53:06] but the Rocks the Briars the
[53:09] thistles each one declared itself but
[53:12] listen how ends it up he said but you
[53:15] are wearing the wedding band of
[53:17] predestination unmerited Grace a wedding
[53:20] band of Grace unmerited of your own God
[53:23] did it himself he knew you would he knew
[53:26] you before the foundation of the world
[53:28] so he slipped the wedding band on you
[53:31] there put your name on the book what a
[53:34] Thanksgiving Hallelujah says praise be
[53:36] to
[53:37] God isn't he
[53:40] wonderful that's what I believe with
[53:42] that's that's what my encouragement is
[53:43] to the assembly
[53:45] here we're not
[53:47] confused we're not preaching something
[53:49] that we don't say oh while you're beaten
[53:51] there Paul said no he said I'm not just
[53:55] beating I'm not just standing here with
[53:56] and you know act like some kind of a
[53:58] acrobat and try to be somebody great and
[53:59] so on impress people right amen if
[54:04] there's any impression to be done Let It
[54:05] Be by the blood-washed word that'll
[54:08] impress you so much you'll say oh as for
[54:10] me in my house we'll walk in this light
[54:13] this glorious light shine all around us
[54:15] by day and by night Jesus the light of
[54:18] the world this Mees in itself I love the
[54:20] way the prophet said it you know how he
[54:23] how he took the the the message and he
[54:26] said this message is that which will
[54:28] bring to pass the tremendous victory in
[54:29] the love divine this message in itself
[54:32] predestinated I love that part
[54:34] predestinated in the bosom of the father
[54:36] before the beginning the same as Jesus
[54:40] was that makes us the Overcomer said you
[54:43] know the scripture Revelations to each
[54:44] age he had one final word to each
[54:47] age he never said much good about the
[54:50] last one in fact he found nothing that
[54:53] he could say except one thing
[54:57] to him that
[54:58] overcometh this is the age of all
[55:01] deception a nation and a world you can
[55:04] see right now it's not men deceiving men
[55:07] it's God allowing it's the nature of the
[55:10] seed now you see when you were quickened
[55:13] that made didn't make you a
[55:15] seed that showed the seed laid there to
[55:17] be
[55:18] quickened the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[55:20] doesn't make a seed it quickens the seed
