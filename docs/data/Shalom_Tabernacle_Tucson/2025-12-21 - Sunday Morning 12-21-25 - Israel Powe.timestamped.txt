[1:42] [music]
[2:22] Good morning everyone. Can we all stand
[2:24] for a word of prayer?
[2:28] Heavenly Father, Lord, we're coming
[2:30] before you this morning.
[2:32] Unto thee, Lord, that we lift up our
[2:35] voice. Unto thee do we raise our hands.
[2:38] For you're worthy, oh God, to receive
[2:40] glory, honor, and power. Lord, we pray
[2:43] that you would just take over the
[2:46] services today, Lord, in this house of
[2:48] worship. That you'd have your way in
[2:50] every life, Lord, in particular, right
[2:54] now with the [music] Sunday school and
[2:56] the children's Sunday school. Father, we
[2:59] pray, Lord, that your presence, Lord,
[3:01] would grow stronger and stronger, Lord.
[3:04] Every time we meet, Lord, and that we'd
[3:07] leave here for the better, not for the
[3:09] worse. Father, thank you for what we're
[3:12] about to hear, Lord. It's blessed us,
[3:15] and [music] we give you all the honor
[3:17] and glory for it. In the name of Jesus
[3:20] Christ, [music] we ask. Amen.
[3:23] We're going to be continuing with the uh
[3:26] what is the Holy Ghost given for? We'll
[3:29] start at paragraph 56 and go to uh
[3:33] through number 86.
[3:36] We sing only believe.
[3:39] Only
[3:41] believe.
[3:44] Only [singing]
[3:46] believe.
[3:50] All things are possible.
[3:55] Only
[3:57] believe.
[4:00] Only believe.
[4:03] [music]
[4:05] Only
[4:06] believe.
[4:10] All things are possible.
[4:15] Only
[4:16] believe.
[4:19] You may be seated, brother Brennham.
[4:24] Spirit
[4:25] &gt;&gt; will be just as pious and just as
[4:27] sanctimonious as it can be until it
[4:30] comes to the Holy Ghost and they'll cut
[4:32] it off right there.
[4:33] &gt;&gt; That's that spirit. Can't you see it
[4:36] moving up?
[4:37] &gt;&gt; The Antichrist and Jesus said they'd be
[4:40] so close together in the last days, it
[4:43] would deceive the very elected if
[4:45] possible. But remember, it's just the
[4:48] elected that will see it.
[4:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[4:52] &gt;&gt; GOD CALLS BY ELECTION.
[4:56] &gt;&gt; Aren't you happy that you're one of
[4:58] them?
[4:59] &gt;&gt; Aren't you people here tonight knowing
[5:01] something in your heart tugging? I want
[5:03] that Holy Spirit. I want you, Lord, in
[5:05] my heart. That's because God put your
[5:08] name on the lamb's book of life before
[5:10] the foundation of the world.
[5:13] &gt;&gt; He said that.
[5:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:16] No man can come to me, said Jesus,
[5:18] except my father has brought him first.
[5:21] And all that comes to me, I'll give him
[5:24] eternal life. What is eternal life? The
[5:26] Holy Spirit. Eternal life. Take that
[5:29] word and run it in the Greek. And it
[5:30] said Zoey. Zoey is the Holy Spirit. All
[5:34] that the Father's given me will come to
[5:37] me. All that comes to me, I'll give him
[5:39] the Holy Ghost. And I'll raise him up at
[5:42] THE LAST DAY. I WILL DO IT. HE said
[5:48] &gt;&gt; not no if and ends about it. I will all
[5:51] that comes and I give eternal life.
[5:53] He'll have to raise because he got
[5:54] eternal life.
[5:56] &gt;&gt; He has to come. Can't die no more than
[5:59] God can die. Oh my dear friends
[6:05] from around this country and in this
[6:07] little city. If I could only with my
[6:11] human voice place into your heart the
[6:14] importance of receiving the baptism of
[6:17] the Holy Ghost, it would be the most
[6:19] wonderful revelation that you ever had
[6:21] in your life.
[6:23] &gt;&gt; To see what you must do it.
[6:27] &gt;&gt; Let me make that clear about you're not
[6:29] converted.
[6:30] Peter had been saved. He believed on the
[6:33] Lord. Followed him. Jesus told him who
[6:36] he was. had him to follow him. He gave
[6:40] him power against unclean spirits and
[6:42] sanctified him. But after all of that
[6:45] and become the chief spokesman of the
[6:48] group
[6:50] as the Catholics would want to call it,
[6:52] the bishop of the church or the pope or
[6:55] whatever it was, the headman of the
[6:57] church.
[6:59] Yet Jesus said the night of his
[7:01] betrayal,
[7:02] "Lovest thou me, Peter?"
[7:07] And he said, 'Lord, you know I love you.
[7:08] He said, "Feed my sheep."
[7:11] He said that three times. And Peter
[7:14] said, 'You know, I love you to I'll go
[7:15] with you to the uh the end and I'll go
[7:18] with you to the death and so forth. He
[7:20] said, before the has crowed three
[7:23] times, you before the crows, you'll
[7:26] have denied me three times. He said,
[7:28] "BUT PETER, I'VE prayed for you."
[7:33] Listen,
[7:35] that's not all of it. I have prayed for
[7:39] you and after you are converted.
[7:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[7:46] &gt;&gt; THEN STRENGTHEN your brethren.
[7:50] &gt;&gt; After you are converted,
[7:54] &gt;&gt; he had shouted. He had probably danced
[7:57] in the spirit. He had done all kinds of
[7:59] things, but he hadn't received the Holy
[8:01] Ghost yet.
[8:03] After you are converted, then strengthen
[8:07] your brethren.
[8:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:09] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[8:11] &gt;&gt; Carry out his plan. Now, let me finish
[8:15] reading John 14:12.
[8:19] Now, in the 14th chapter and 12th verse,
[8:22] Jesus said, "Verily, verily, I say unto
[8:23] you, he that believeth and you cannot
[8:26] believe
[8:28] on me, you can believe unto him." How
[8:32] many understands that? Say amen.
[8:35] &gt;&gt; You remember in Acts 19, I hate to stop
[8:37] this here. But I just have to say it as
[8:40] it comes to me.
[8:43] In Acts the 19th chapter,
[8:46] when this Baptist preacher, which was a
[8:48] a lawyer and was converted and he was
[8:52] preaching and getting people saved and
[8:54] they had great joy just rejoicing and
[8:57] shouting, having a meeting. Acts 18.
[9:01] Aquilla Priscilla. We referred to it
[9:03] last evening. And they had went to see
[9:06] him and they noted he was a great man
[9:07] and he was a student AND HE WAS PROVING
[9:10] BY THE BIBLE that Jesus was the son of
[9:13] God
[9:15] only knowing the baptism of John. He
[9:18] didn't know the baptism of the Holy
[9:19] Ghost yet.
[9:22] So he said Aquilla and Priscilla that
[9:24] husband and wife little tent makers
[9:26] which Paul was a tent maker too and
[9:28] they'd received the Holy Ghost under
[9:30] Paul's teaching they said we've got a
[9:32] little brother who's coming up here let
[9:34] him talk to us a little bit about it and
[9:37] when Paul came up and heard him preached
[9:39] he was a great man he said have you
[9:42] received the Holy Ghost since you have
[9:45] believed
[9:47] they said we know not there where there
[9:49] be any Holy Ghost. He said then to what
[9:52] or the real Greek word there is to how
[9:55] was you baptized?
[9:57] They said we have been baptized already
[10:00] by John the Baptist. Now watch what Paul
[10:03] said. Paul said that John verely
[10:07] baptized unto
[10:10] repentance
[10:12] &gt;&gt; not for remission of sins
[10:14] but unto repentance. saying that's what
[10:18] you believe when you accept Christ as
[10:20] your personal savior. You are believing
[10:23] unto the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[10:26] &gt;&gt; That is not the baptism of the Holy
[10:28] Ghost. My dear Baptist brethren, that is
[10:32] wrong. A brother said to me the other
[10:34] day, he said, "Brother Brandom," or some
[10:36] time ago, months ago, he said, "Brother
[10:38] Brandham, Abraham believed God and it
[10:41] was imputed unto him for righteousness."
[10:43] I said, "Truly?" Said, "What more can a
[10:45] man do than believe?" God says that's
[10:47] all a man can do. That's all he can do
[10:49] today is believe God. But God gave him a
[10:54] seal of circumcision that we went
[10:55] through last night as a sign that he had
[10:59] accepted his faith in him.
[11:02] &gt;&gt; And today until God you believe unto him
[11:06] when you accepted him as your personal
[11:07] savior. But when God gives you the seal
[11:10] of the Holy Ghost, he sealed you to your
[11:14] eternal destination. Amen.
[11:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[11:17] &gt;&gt; NOW YOU BAPTIST, TAKE THAT AND I'LL GO
[11:20] WITH you on eternal security.
[11:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Because grieve not the Holy
[11:24] Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed
[11:27] until the day of your redemption.
[11:31] &gt;&gt; You are not sealed BY BELIEVING UNTO,
[11:34] BUT SEALED BY THE HOLY GHOST. AMEN.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4:30, grieve not the Holy
[11:41] Spirit of God, whereby you're sealed
[11:43] until the day of your redemption.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; That seals you when you found favor with
[11:50] God and he seals you by the Holy Spirit
[11:55] that s for the Bible said no man can
[12:00] call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy
[12:03] Ghost. Amen.
[12:05] &gt;&gt; You say, "I believe it because the
[12:07] pastor said so." He's right. But that
[12:11] doesn't count for you. I believe it
[12:13] because the word says so. That's right.
[12:16] But that isn't for you. That doesn't
[12:18] count you. The only way that you can say
[12:21] that Jesus is the Christ is when the
[12:23] Holy Ghost comes into you and bears
[12:25] record and witnesses itself out. He is
[12:28] the son of God. THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU
[12:30] KNOW THE RESURRECTION. is when the Holy
[12:33] Ghost bears record.
[12:36] &gt;&gt; When he the Holy Ghost has come, he will
[12:39] testify of me.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; Show you things to come.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; Bring these things that I said to your
[12:46] memories. You'll never find it in the
[12:48] school. See, he will bring these things
[12:51] to your memories.
[12:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; Now, we want to read just a little
[12:56] further in this scripture. Now, St. John
[12:59] 14:12.
[13:01] Verily, verily, I say to you, he that
[13:03] believeth on me, the works
[13:07] that I do shall he do also, and greater,
[13:13] which is the right translation there, is
[13:15] more, if you want to look it up, greater
[13:17] works than these shall he do, because I
[13:20] go to the father. If he went to the
[13:24] father, the holy spirit would come. Is
[13:26] that right? Another scripture said, "If
[13:29] I go not away, the comforter will not
[13:32] come. But if I go away, I'll come again
[13:36] and be with you, even in you."
[13:38] &gt;&gt; See, it's God with you over you first
[13:43] with you in Christ in you in the Holy
[13:45] Ghost.
[13:47] &gt;&gt; God in you. Now the works that I do
[13:52] shall you do also. Not another work, but
[13:56] God wants to bring the Holy Ghost in you
[13:59] to continue
[14:02] the same work that he was doing in
[14:04] Christ.
[14:06] &gt;&gt; The work wasn't so needy in the days of
[14:08] Luther. That was God's church. It wasn't
[14:11] a little bit more needier in the days of
[14:13] Westing because the world, the Bible
[14:16] said, would get weaker and wiser and
[14:19] more wicked all the time. We the world's
[14:22] getting more wicked all. We know that.
[14:25] &gt;&gt; Why man do things today that 100 years
[14:28] ago you wouldn't have thought there'd
[14:30] been any human being that cruel?
[14:33] &gt;&gt; More wicked all the time, and the wicked
[14:36] shall do wicked all the time, said the
[14:38] scripture. more and more. So, the Holy
[14:41] Spirit has been moving. There's just a
[14:44] little breath of it with Luther, a
[14:46] little blow of it with Wesley and a
[14:49] deeper blow of it with Pentecost. NOW,
[14:54] THE BREATH and the spirit has become the
[14:57] same. She's uniting together, bringing
[15:00] forth that same powerful blow of the
[15:03] Holy Ghost like he did back there is
[15:06] manifesting the same works that he did
[15:09] back there is being manifested right
[15:11] today.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; The same thing.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; Watch what Jesus said. Verily, verily, I
[15:17] say unto you, the son can do nothing
[15:22] except he sees the father do it first.
[15:26] What the father does, he shows the son.
[15:29] The father dwelleth in me, he doeth the
[15:31] works. See, now notice, here's another
[15:35] thing I'd like to say right here. As
[15:38] Jesus said, as the father has sent me,
[15:44] as now watch, as the father has sent me,
[15:49] so send I you
[15:54] as the father. How did the father send
[15:56] him? The father that sent him come down
[15:59] from heaven and dwelt in him. He went
[16:02] forth. He said, "I always do that which
[16:05] pleases my father." See, he went about
[16:10] doing the things that the father was
[16:12] showing him to do. I do nothing except
[16:14] my father shows me first. The God that
[16:17] sent him was on the inside of me. And as
[16:21] the father sent me, the same way the
[16:24] father sent me, so I send you.
[16:28] &gt;&gt; WHY IS IT GOD IN YOU?
[16:32] &gt;&gt; Carrying on what? The same works.
[16:35] The same Jesus said the he that
[16:37] believeth, he that has me on the inside
[16:40] of him, the Holy Spirit. He that
[16:42] believeth that's already witnessed my
[16:44] resurrection, know that I am in him. He
[16:46] that's in me, if ye abide in me, my
[16:50] words abide in you. They say, "I abide
[16:53] in Jesus, but I sure don't believe in
[16:54] divine healing." That shows he's not
[16:56] there.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; I believe in Jesus, don't believe in the
[16:59] Holy Ghost this day. Not like they had
[17:00] it back there. That shows he isn't
[17:02] there.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit will bear wick record of
[17:05] every word spoke.
[17:07] &gt;&gt; He's not a liar. He's not afraid of
[17:09] nobody and no organization. He don't
[17:11] have to take down for nobody.
[17:14] Hallelujah.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; He speaks IT AND HE STAYS WITH IT.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; If the high and polluted and educated or
[17:21] uh as we call it bureaucrats, if they
[17:24] don't want to RECEIVE IT, GOD'S able of
[17:27] these stones to rise children of
[17:28] Abraham, he'll take gangsters and
[17:31] bootleggers and EVERYTHING ELSE AND RISE
[17:33] IT UP.
[17:35] &gt;&gt; God can do it. And he is doing it. God's
[17:39] able of these stones to rise children of
[17:41] Abraham.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to do it.
[17:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:46] &gt;&gt; Cuz he's God.
[17:48] &gt;&gt; If you abide in me in my words and you
[17:50] ask what you will because you're asking
[17:53] his word and his word is life. Speak it.
[17:57] If God said it in your sh the Holy Ghost
[17:59] bearish record, that word's right. Then
[18:01] there you are, brother. Speak it. There
[18:03] it is. Say to this mountain, BE MOVED.
[18:05] DON'T DOUBT IN YOUR HEART, BUT BELIEVE
[18:07] IN WHAT YOU HEAR.
[18:11] &gt;&gt; Not you that speaketh, but the father
[18:12] that dwelleth in you, he doeth the
[18:14] talking. It's not you talking to that
[18:16] mountain. It's the father that's IN YOU.
[18:18] &gt;&gt; SPEAKING TO THAT MOUNTAIN, IT HAS TO
[18:20] MOVE.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; All heavens and earth will pass away. He
[18:24] said, "But my spirit shall not. My word
[18:26] shall not pass away."
[18:28] &gt;&gt; Certainly, it cannot pass away. father.
[18:32] Now the works that I do, God is in his
[18:36] church to continue his works. That's why
[18:38] he sent the Holy Ghost. Now he know that
[18:43] he he knowed it wouldn't be it couldn't
[18:44] be done that way. So was it by
[18:46] otherwise? So he had to send the father
[18:49] sent the son for all that's in front son
[18:51] in you and the same works that he did
[18:54] the same very works now that Jesus did
[18:57] you'll do also the church. Wouldn't you
[18:59] like to do the works of God?
[19:01] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "If you won't do the works
[19:03] of God, believe on me."
[19:05] &gt;&gt; How you believe on him, you can't do it
[19:07] till you got the Holy Ghost.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; Cuz no man can say he is the son of God.
[19:11] You're saying what somebody else said.
[19:13] &gt;&gt; The Bible said that he's the son of God.
[19:15] I believe the Bible.
[19:17] All right. The Bible says the son of
[19:19] God. I believe the Bible. The pastor
[19:21] says he's the son of God. I believe the
[19:23] pastor. Mama says he's a son of God. I
[19:26] believe mama. My friend says he's a son
[19:29] of God. I believe my friend. BUT THE
[19:31] ONLY WAY THAT I CAN SAY HE'S A son of
[19:33] God IS WHEN THE HOLY GHOST COMES IN AND
[19:36] BEARS RECORD OF ITSELF.
[19:39] &gt;&gt; Then I know he's a son of God.
[19:42] &gt;&gt; No man can call Jesus Christ only by the
[19:45] Holy Ghost.
[19:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:49] &gt;&gt; No man speaking by the spirit of God
[19:50] called Jesus a curse.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:53] &gt;&gt; Or say it was something that day and
[19:55] something else today. That makes him
[19:57] weak and faulty. No, sir. He's the same
[20:00] yesterday, today, and forever. Any true
[20:03] spirit will bear record of that.
[20:06] All right. Now, he said, "These works
[20:09] that I do shall you also." John 14:12.
[20:12] Now, the same works. Oh, they say the
[20:14] church does a greater work today. In
[20:16] what manner? He said, "The works that I
[20:19] do that he said, well, we got
[20:22] missionaries all over the world. That's
[20:24] a greater work." But he said the works
[20:26] that I do
[20:29] &gt;&gt; now do them
[20:31] do them first.
[20:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:33] &gt;&gt; Then talk about missionaries.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; Today speaking here some time ago about
[20:39] a Muhammad. And he said Muhammad's dead.
[20:42] That's right. He's in the grave, but
[20:43] someday he'll rise. He said if he rises
[20:46] from the grave, the whole world will
[20:47] know it in 24 hours. He said you people
[20:50] say Jesus has been raised 2,000 years.
[20:52] Not onethird of the people know it yet.
[20:55] That's because that you spoke from an
[20:57] intellectual view of it. You spoke from
[21:00] a standpoint of school or education. If
[21:03] this whole great church of God,
[21:05] counting, Catholic, Protestant all
[21:06] together had received the Holy Ghost,
[21:08] THIS WORLD BE LAYING SOLID IN
[21:10] CHRISTIANITY.
[21:12] There wouldn't be such a thing as
[21:13] communism. There wouldn't be such a
[21:15] thing as strife or enmity or meanness or
[21:18] hatred. Jesus would be sitting on his
[21:20] throne. We'd be walking through the
[21:22] paradises of God with eternal life,
[21:24] living forever, already resurrected in a
[21:27] new body, walking around never to be
[21:28] old, never to be gray, never to be sick,
[21:30] never to be hungry, walking in the joys
[21:33] of the Lord, talking with the animals,
[21:35] and oh, what a day.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; But we've done everything else besides
[21:39] what he he said, "Go ye into world and
[21:41] preach the gospel."
[21:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What does the gospel not
[21:44] word only but through power and
[21:46] demonstrations of the Holy Ghost making
[21:48] the word of God manifest as the gospel.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; You can't do it. Now Jesus know that he
[21:56] had to live in his church. Therefore he
[21:58] know we'd have intellectual schools. And
[22:01] you'll never get this in an intellectual
[22:03] school. They'll be against it.
[22:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; Because all they know is some smart
[22:08] man's learning. Some creed or
[22:11] denomination. they want to to live by.
[22:14] So they'll they'll set you up in that
[22:15] and make you a member of that body and
[22:18] brother quote some things to you out of
[22:20] a creed that would seem like it was just
[22:22] perfect. The great holy church the
[22:25] mother it stood a many beat it stood a
[22:27] many a pound. So has the devil he's been
[22:30] kicked out of everywhere there is nearly
[22:32] and he's still going on just the same.
[22:34] Yes sir. Oh they'll try to quote these.
[22:37] So Jesus knowed that there'd be a great
[22:40] intellectual move just like there was in
[22:42] his days in washing of pots and pans and
[22:45] wearing of clothes and turned around
[22:47] collars and everything that they did all
[22:49] these different things that they would
[22:51] do. He know they'd do that. So he said,
[22:53] "Now just wait a minute. I'm going to
[22:58] not leave you comfortless.
[23:00] I'm coming again to be with you."
[23:03] Therefore, he said, "The works that I
[23:05] do, you'll do also." The purpose of
[23:07] sending the Holy Ghost was for God to
[23:10] continue through a bunch of people to
[23:13] continually manifest God to the world.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Not by a creed, not by
[23:18] denomination, but by the power of his
[23:21] resurrection.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:23] &gt;&gt; By making his word real, by taking his
[23:26] promise and standing on the side of THE
[23:28] MINORITY AND BELIEVING GOD AND WATCH THE
[23:31] BLACK SKIES MOVE BACK AND THE power of
[23:33] God move in and take over. Amen. That's
[23:37] what he wants.
[23:38] &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost was sent for.
[23:40] That's what purpose he sent it for. We
[23:42] know what it is now. And that's why he
[23:44] sent it. Therefore, no other blood would
[23:46] sanctify people. I couldn't sanctify you
[23:49] and you couldn't sanctify me because
[23:51] we're both born after sex. But Jesus was
[23:54] born without sex. That's right. So, his
[23:57] blood was a sanctifier. And God came
[23:59] down, made a body, lived in it, shed
[24:02] that blood for the sanctifying of THIS
[24:04] WHICH ABSOLUTELY EXPELLED THE GUILT of
[24:07] sin and shame. Then through faith,
[24:10] believing in that, God comes right down
[24:12] into that human body by the sanctifying
[24:13] of that blood.
[24:15] Puts in Abraham's seed by faith to
[24:17] believe that that blood would come. That
[24:20] pure blood that would be a miracle like
[24:22] his blood walked over there after is as
[24:24] good as dead. believed God for 25 years.
[24:27] Him 75 years old and believed till he
[24:30] was 100. And Sarah 65 and believed till
[24:32] she was 90.
[24:35] And he was one as good as the dead. And
[24:37] God said, "So the people won't be sure
[24:39] to miss it. Take him up here on the hill
[24:41] and offer him up for a sacrifice.

[36:10] &gt;&gt; Good morning. Merry Christmas. Happy
[36:13] Sunday. Sure good to be with God's
[36:14] people, our visitors. Welcome to our
[36:17] worship this morning. Brother Brown
[36:18] called it a worship, not a celebration.
[36:20] And then he said, "Doesn't matter when
[36:21] you do it, just worship the Lord." So,
[36:23] we're happy to worship in spirit and
[36:25] [music] in truth this morning. Our
[36:27] precious brother Ezekiel, the part of
[36:28] the Hernandez family is sick this
[36:30] morning. He asked to remember their
[36:32] family today. So, let's do that for
[36:34] brother Ezekiel. We'll miss him [music]
[36:36] and his crew. Also, our precious sister
[36:39] Sophia Valencia, she's supposed to have
[36:42] surgery on [music] her heart vow. So,
[36:43] we've been holding her up in prayer very
[36:46] serious, but we have a prayer answering
[36:48] God today. We serve [music] mighty in
[36:50] miracles and wonders. We pray for a
[36:52] miracle for our sister. If the Lord
[36:54] wants to do that by miracle or by doctor
[36:56] or however, so [music]
[36:57] remember her and maybe there would be
[36:59] one with the uplifted hand. You'd want
[37:01] to say, "Lord, remember me, my family,
[37:02] my loved one, my spiritual, physical,
[37:05] these mindful saints." Dear God, we're
[37:07] so happy to be in church today to
[37:09] worship you. Lord, we worship in spirit
[37:11] and in truth because you've given us the
[37:13] full word, Lord. the revelation of these
[37:16] last church ages, the Leodysian that we
[37:19] live in, Lord, and the voice you said to
[37:21] this generation. [music] And may we be
[37:23] happy and blessed to hear this morning
[37:26] from heaven. We know that you are here.
[37:29] You promise to be here, Lord, where two
[37:30] or three are gathered in your name. We
[37:32] gather in the mighty name of the Lord
[37:34] Jesus Christ. [music]
[37:35] Lord, the speaker, Lord, will be you
[37:37] speaking through our precious brother
[37:39] and the word. and just pray that all
[37:41] things the specials, the gifts, Lord, we
[37:45] have for one another, but just in
[37:47] remembrance of the gift, the mighty,
[37:49] [music] powerful, wonderful, Lord, in a
[37:51] humble way that you brought a child to
[37:54] the world, Lord God. And we're thankful
[37:55] for this precious gift, knowing Lord
[37:58] that you're not a little baby anymore,
[38:00] but you're a mighty God and a prayer
[38:02] [music] answer. And God, we hold up our
[38:03] needs before you and just for your
[38:05] perfect will to be done for brother
[38:06] Ezekiel. [music]
[38:07] Lord, his
[38:09] little boy is sick this morning with a
[38:12] fever and part of his crew and he just
[38:14] pray that wanted the church [music] to
[38:16] remember the entire family. and for our
[38:18] precious sister Sophia Valencia. We miss
[38:21] her, Lord, in these health battles,
[38:23] Lord. But you're mighty above all health
[38:25] needs that we have,
[38:28] physical and spiritual, Lord, the
[38:30] financial pressures as we enter this
[38:32] season of giftgiving, Lord, but may
[38:34] nothing come between us, Father, as we
[38:36] commit all things to your mighty hands.
[38:38] We are uh [music] grateful givers. We're
[38:41] thankful, Lord, to bring a tithe and
[38:43] offering, Lord, to the house of the Lord
[38:44] this morning. We do this all in [music]
[38:46] the mighty name of our Lord and Savior,
[38:48] the Lord Jesus Christ. And all God's
[38:50] people say, "Amen." [music]
[38:56] Amen. We have a lot planned for this
[38:59] morning. There's a lot of specials.
[39:01] [music] A lot of scriptures are going to
[39:03] be read. And so, we're just going to uh
[39:06] u sing of course together, [music] Joy
[39:08] to the World. We turn the service over
[39:10] to Brother Levi, and he's going to take
[39:12] the next segment [music] after we sing
[39:14] this. Joy to [singing] the world, the
[39:17] Lord is come. Let earth receive a king.
[39:23] [singing]
[39:25] [music]
[39:26] Let every heart prepare him move. And
[39:32] heaven [music] and nature sing. And
[39:35] heaven and nature [singing] sing. And
[39:38] heaven and heaven [music] and nature
[39:42] sing.
[39:43] Joy to the [singing] world, the Savior
[39:47] reigns. Let men [music] their songs
[39:51] [singing]
[39:52] employ.
[39:54] While fields [music]
[39:56] and floods, rocks, hills, and blades
[40:00] [singing] repeat the sounding joy.
[40:02] [music]
[40:03] Repeat the sounding joy. Repeat, repeat
[40:08] [music]
[40:09] the sounding [singing]
[40:10] joy.
[40:12] No more let sins and sorrows grow, nor
[40:18] thorns infest the [music] ground.
[40:23] He comes to [singing] make his [music]
[40:27] blessings flow far as the curse is
[40:31] found. [music and singing]
[40:32] Far as the curse is found. Far as far as
[40:38] the curse is found.
[40:41] He rules [music] the world with truth
[40:45] and grace and makes the nations
[40:49] [singing]
[40:50] prove
[40:52] the glory [singing]
[40:54] [music] of his righteousness
[40:58] and wonders of his love and wonders of
[41:02] his love and wonders [music and singing]
[41:06] wonders of his
[41:12] Amen. You can be seated if you'd like.
[41:16] And you come up and sing. And for that
[41:19] uh let's read uh John uh 1 verse4
[41:33] And the word was made flesh and dwelt
[41:35] among us. And we beheld his glory, the
[41:38] glory as of the only begotten of the
[41:40] father, full of grace and truth.
[42:15] was a tiny [singing] simple stable
[42:19] all beaten and worn.
[42:24] Hardly a place [music]
[42:26] for a king to be born. He didn't choose
[42:31] [singing]
[42:32] some place [music] special to reveal his
[42:36] majesty.
[42:38] So I [singing] know if I'll give him
[42:41] control, he'll be born in me.
[42:45] Let [music and singing] your word be
[42:49] born
[42:50] in the manger [singing]
[42:52] of [music] my heart.
[42:55] Let it live in me. Let it start.
[43:01] Live inside [singing and music]
[43:02] this house of clay
[43:05] and mold it every day.
[43:09] Let your word be born [singing]
[43:13] in [music] the manger
[43:15] of my heart.
[43:21] [music]
[43:28] [music]
[43:31] While outwardly I'm nothing, not
[43:34] [singing] much to behold.
[43:38] unlikely the [music] place for his word
[43:43] to unfold. [singing]
[43:45] But if I'll just heal this vessel
[43:48] [music]
[43:49] and let him have his way
[43:53] from glory [singing and music]
[43:54] unto glory.
[43:56] He'll change me day by day. [music]
[44:00] Let [singing] your word be born
[44:06] in the manger [music and singing] of my
[44:08] heart.
[44:10] Let it live in me. [music] Let it
[44:13] [singing] start.
[44:16] Live inside this house of clay
[44:21] and mold it every day.
[44:24] Let your word be [singing and music]
[44:26] born
[44:28] in the manger
[44:30] of my heart.

[44:39] in the [singing and music] manger of my
[44:41] heart.

[44:46] [singing and music] start
[44:49] live inside this house of clay
[44:54] and mold [singing and music] it every
[44:56] day.
[44:58] Let your word be born
[44:59] [singing and music]
[45:01] in the manger
[45:03] of [singing] my heart.
[45:07] Let your [music] word be born [singing]
[45:10] in the manger
[45:12] of my heart.
[45:29] Amen. [applause]
[45:33] Up next, we'll have brother Trevor. And
[45:35] as he prepares to come, let's read Luke
[45:39] 1:es 30-31.
[45:52] And the angel said unto her, "Fear not,
[45:54] Mary, for thou hast found favor with
[45:56] God. And behold, thou shalt conceive in
[45:59] thy womb, and bring forth a son, and
[46:01] shalt call his name Jesus.
[46:17] Mary, did [singing] you know
[46:20] that your baby boy would one day walk on
[46:26] water?
[46:28] Mary, did you know [singing]
[46:32] that your baby boy
[46:36] would save our sons and daughters?
[46:40] [singing]
[46:41] Did you know
[46:43] that your baby boy has come to [singing]
[46:48] make you new?
[46:52] This child that you deliver
[46:58] will soon deliver you.
[47:05] Mary, did you know
[47:08] that your baby boy
[47:12] will give [singing] sight to the blind
[47:16] man? Mary, [music] did you know
[47:20] that your baby boy [singing]
[47:24] would calm a storm with his hand? Did
[47:29] you know
[47:31] that your baby boy has [music] walked
[47:36] where angels trod
[47:39] and when you kiss [singing] your little
[47:43] baby,
[47:45] you've kissed the face of God.
[47:54] The blind will see.
[47:57] The deaf will hear, the dead will live
[48:02] again,
[48:04] and the lame will leave. And the dumb
[48:08] will speak the praises of the lamb.
[48:17] Mary, [singing] did you know
[48:20] that your baby boy, the Lord of all
[48:25] [music]
[48:26] creation?
[48:28] Mary, did you know [singing]
[48:30] [music] that your baby boy will one day
[48:35] rule the nations? [music and singing]
[48:39] Did you know
[48:41] that your baby boy [singing]
[48:44] was [music] heaven's perfect lamb?
[48:50] And the sleeping child you're holding
[48:53] [singing]
[48:55] is the great
[48:59] I
[49:01] am. [singing]
[49:09] Mary, did you know
[49:20] [applause]
[49:26] Up next we'll have Sister Melissa. And
[49:29] as Sister Melissa comes, let's read Luke
[49:32] 2 7 to8.
[49:35] And she brought forth her firstborn son,
[49:37] and wrapped him in swaddling clothes,
[49:39] and laid him in a manger, because there
[49:42] was no room for them in the inn. And
[49:44] there were in the same country shepherds
[49:46] abiding in the field, keeping watch over
[49:49] their flock by night.
[50:20] All is
[50:25] bright
[50:27] everywhere. [singing]
[50:30] But in your [music] heart tonight,
[50:33] they're singing
[50:37] of joy and [singing] peace,
[50:40] but you feel too far gone, too far
[50:44] [singing] out of reach. [music]
[50:51] [singing]
[50:52] [music]
[50:55] Heaven [singing]
[50:56] hears the song. Your broken [music]
[51:00] heart has cried.
[51:03] Hope is here. Just lift [music]

[51:22] From
[51:28] heaven's
[51:31] to
[51:35] [music]
[51:36] [singing]
[51:37] the prince of peace won't go
[51:41] from manger [singing and music] low
[51:44] to
[51:46] hill.
[51:48] When your pain runs [music and singing]
[51:50] deep, his love runs deeper still.
[51:55] He has always [music and singing] loved
[51:57] you, child, and he always will.
[52:03] [music] Somewhere
[52:05] in your silent [singing] night,

[53:52] [music]
[53:56] [applause]
[54:03] Amen. Up next, we'll have the choir.
[54:07] And as they come, we will read
[54:10] Revelations
[54:12] 5:12. If you would come on up and make
[54:14] ready.
[54:21] And I beheld, and I heard the voice of
[54:23] many angels round about the throne, and

[1:02:49] praising God and saying, "Glory to God
[1:02:52] in the highest, and on earth peace,
[1:02:54] goodwill toward men." And it came to
[1:02:57] pass, as the angels were gone away from
[1:02:59] them into heaven, the shepherds said one
[1:03:01] to another, "Let us now go even unto

[1:11:27] The people that walked in darkness have
[1:11:29] seen a great light. They that dwell in
[1:11:31] the land of the shadow of death. Upon

[1:14:35] We have three more left. Up next, we'll
[1:14:39] have the Morris family. As they come, we
[1:14:42] will read Isaiah 53:es 3:5.
[1:14:50] He is despised and rejected of men, a
[1:14:53] man of sorrows, and acquainted with
[1:14:54] grief. And we hid as it were our faces
[1:14:56] from him. He was despised, and we
[1:14:59] esteemed him not. Surely he hath borne
[1:15:01] our grief and carried our sorrows. Yet
[1:15:04] we did esteem him stricken, smitten of
[1:15:06] God, and afflicted. But he was wounded
[1:15:09] for our transgressions. He was bruised
[1:15:10] for our iniquities. The chastisement of
[1:15:13] our peace was upon him. And with his
[1:15:15] stripes we are healed.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; as little children.
[1:15:47] As little children, we would [music]
[1:15:49] dream of Christmas.
[1:15:56] [music]
[1:15:57] When we would dream of Christmas morning
[1:16:01] and all the gifts and toys we knew we'd
[1:16:07] [music and singing] find, but we never
[1:16:10] realized a baby born one blessed night
[1:16:14] [singing]
[1:16:16] gave us the greatest [music] gift
[1:16:20] of our [singing] lives.
[1:16:24] We are the reason that he gave his
[1:16:28] [singing] life.
[1:16:31] We are the reason that he [singing]
[1:16:35] suffered and died
[1:16:37] to a world that was lost. [music] He
[1:16:40] gave all he could give
[1:16:44] to show us the reason [singing]
[1:16:47] to live.
[1:16:51] As the years went by, we learned
[1:16:53] [singing] more about gifts,
[1:16:56] giving of ourselves [music]
[1:16:59] and what that [singing] means. On a dark
[1:17:03] and cloudy [music]
[1:17:05] day, a man [singing] hung crying in the
[1:17:08] rain.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Because of love.
[1:17:14] Because of [singing] love,
[1:17:17] [music]
[1:17:18] we are the reason that he gave his life.
[1:17:25] We are [singing] the reason that he
[1:17:28] suffered and died
[1:17:31] to a [singing and music] world that was
[1:17:33] lost. He gave all he could give
[1:17:38] to show [music and singing] us the
[1:17:40] reason to live.
[1:17:44] I [singing] finally found a reason for
[1:17:48] [music] living. [singing]
[1:17:50] It's in giving every part of my heart to
[1:17:55] him.
[1:17:57] In all that [singing] I do, every word
[1:18:01] that I say, I'll be giving my all
[1:18:05] [singing]
[1:18:06] just for him.
[1:18:10] [music] For him.
[1:18:14] We are the [singing] reason that he gave
[1:18:18] his life.
[1:18:20] We are the reason that he suffered and
[1:18:25] died. [singing]
[1:18:26] To a world that was lost, he gave all
[1:18:30] [singing] he could give
[1:18:33] [music] to show us the reason to live.
[1:18:40] He is my reason [singing]
[1:18:42] to live. [music]
[1:18:48] [applause]
[1:19:00] Amen. Up next, we'll have brother John
[1:19:02] Yarro. And as he prepares, we will read
[1:19:06] Isaiah 96.
[1:19:25] For unto us a child is born, unto us a
[1:19:27] son is given, and the government shall
[1:19:29] be upon his shoulder, and his name shall
[1:19:32] be called Wonderful Counselor, the
[1:19:34] Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the
[1:19:36] Prince of Peace.
[1:20:02] Let
[1:20:04] there
[1:20:06] be peace
[1:20:08] on earth
[1:20:10] and let It begin
[1:20:14] with me.
[1:20:19] Let
[1:20:21] there [singing]
[1:20:22] be peace [music]
[1:20:24] on earth.

[1:21:18] now.
[1:21:22] With
[1:21:24] every
[1:21:25] step I take,
[1:21:29] let this be [music and singing] my solo
[1:21:32] vow.
[1:21:36] To take each [music and singing] moment
[1:21:40] and live each moment
[1:21:43] in peace [singing]
[1:21:45] eternally.

[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Let

[1:21:54] be [singing] peace on earth
[1:21:58] and let it begin [singing]
[1:22:02] with me.
[1:22:23] All right. And we'll have Sister Joy.
[1:22:25] And for her we'll read Luke 1 46.
[1:22:36] And Mary said, "My soul doth magnify the
[1:22:40] Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God
[1:22:43] my Savior, for he hath regarded the low
[1:22:46] estate of his handmaiden. For behold,

[1:28:02] Um, I know we don't celebrate Christmas

[1:29:15] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[1:29:18] the body of Christ.
[1:29:22] So, I believe that our pastor here is
[1:29:25] doing that. Um, I'd like brother Chris

[1:34:14] daily.
[1:34:15] Lift our hands. Say, "Praise God.
[1:34:17] [singing]
[1:34:19] Praise God.
[1:34:22] Praise God."
[1:34:25] [music] Oh, praise God.

[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Truly, he's worthy to be praised. Let's
[1:35:05] bow our head to him [music]
[1:35:09] that we've given our praises to. Dear
[1:35:12] Lord Jesus, there's no [music] one like
[1:35:14] you, Lord. We give you the praise today
[1:35:18] because you alone are worthy.
[1:35:21] Father, you alone
[1:35:23] have [music] done what no man could do.
[1:35:27] They buried you. They took your life.
[1:35:30] You laid your life down. But you rose up
[1:35:34] again on the third day like you said.
[1:35:36] [music and singing]
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; And you rose with all power in your
[1:35:39] hand. And you place that power in the
[1:35:42] church of the living God. And it's
[1:35:45] because of that power, Lord, that we can
[1:35:47] sing your praises today. It's because of
[1:35:50] that power it brought us here, Lord, to
[1:35:53] worship you in spirit and [music] in
[1:35:54] truth. Lord, may you lay aside every
[1:35:57] weight. May we lay aside every weight,
[1:36:00] Lord, as we [music] serve you today.
[1:36:02] Father, forgive us of our sins and
[1:36:05] shortcomings. There are many. We have
[1:36:08] failed you so many so many times. But
[1:36:11] forgive us just now at this moment,
[1:36:14] Lord. And may you feed us with your word
[1:36:17] of truth. May you give us strength,
[1:36:20] Lord, [music] for the journey that lays
[1:36:22] ahead us, Lord. Rebuke the enemy that's
[1:36:25] trying to destroy us and discourage us.
[1:36:29] And may we be stronger than we've ever
[1:36:31] been before. Lord, we leave from here
[1:36:33] with the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:36] upon us as our prayer. We thank you. We
[1:36:40] ask these blessings in Jesus' name.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] Amen. God bless you. You
[1:36:45] may be seated just for a moment just to
[1:36:48] greet our visitors [music] and any of
[1:36:50] our friends. Um,
[1:36:54] how many visitors are here this morning?
[1:36:56] Let me see your hand. There's a few
[1:36:58] there. And okay, so that that believe
[1:37:02] that's brother Joe and Priscilla Coffee.
[1:37:05] Is that right? Correct. God bless you.
[1:37:07] Welcome uh to to the service here this
[1:37:12] morning. Brother Bobby Figueroa is here
[1:37:15] home sweet home with his family all the
[1:37:17] way from Irma.
[1:37:21] So, we're so so happy to have the Figaro
[1:37:22] uh back with us and fellowshipping.
[1:37:25] Amen. Give the Lord a hand of praise.
[1:37:27] [applause]
[1:37:29] And we let you like to welcome each of
[1:37:31] you to the house of the Lord. I
[1:37:32] certainly enjoyed that um program. We
[1:37:36] won't call it a Christmas program, will
[1:37:38] we? It was quite a I mean, it's already
[1:37:41] 11:20
[1:37:43] and so it's been going a little long,
[1:37:45] wouldn't you say?
[1:37:47] Huh?
[1:37:48] I want to see where I'm at this morning.
[1:37:50] I want to see where I'm at. So, God
[1:37:52] bless you. Just starting. All right. So,
[1:37:55] we were going to have evening service
[1:37:57] tonight, but I think I'll cancel that
[1:37:59] evening service. Okay. Anybody feel
[1:38:02] better now? [laughter]
[1:38:05] Going a little longer. God bless you.
[1:38:07] So, I was thinking about it and then we
[1:38:10] don't have a Wednesday night service.
[1:38:12] The thing is when we cancel the evening
[1:38:14] service, what you going to do at home
[1:38:16] and twiddle your thumbs, just sit back,
[1:38:19] but we'll cancel that service because
[1:38:22] the service is going a bit late this
[1:38:23] morning and that'll give me the
[1:38:25] opportunity to say a few things that's
[1:38:28] on my heart. So, I just welcome you to
[1:38:30] the house of the Lord. And um this will
[1:38:33] be our final service before Christmas.
[1:38:36] And so, we wanted to appreciate that
[1:38:40] program, that singing. That was so nice.
[1:38:43] I really enjoy that.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[1:38:52] I enjoyed the choir singing. That was
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. I can hear that one again. and I
[1:38:58] really could. So, we're just a blessing
[1:39:00] and thank you for all of the gifts and
[1:39:03] the fine goodies that you have given to
[1:39:06] us again every year. It's a nice little
[1:39:08] basket that you guys give us and we
[1:39:11] certainly appreciate it. Um, it's all
[1:39:14] mine and then I share with whoever I
[1:39:17] want to share with,
[1:39:19] but we certainly appreciate it. Thank
[1:39:21] you so much. And um so as we would like
[1:39:25] to go forward into the word of the Lord
[1:39:27] this morning, I'm going to ask you to
[1:39:29] stand and take your Bible and turn in
[1:39:31] the scripture in Matthew chapter 2.
[1:39:38] Remember, no ser service is canceled
[1:39:40] tonight. Wednesday night service is
[1:39:42] cancelled.
[1:39:44] And then um next week, Sunday morning,
[1:39:48] we have service
[1:39:50] Sunday morning, Sunday night, and then
[1:39:53] we'll have a watch night service next
[1:39:55] week, Wednesday. That's the order of
[1:39:58] services
[1:40:00] in Matthew chapter 2:es
[1:40:06] 1-1. Now when Jesus was born in
[1:40:08] Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod
[1:40:11] the king, behold, there came wise men
[1:40:13] from the east to Jerusalem, saying,
[1:40:16] "Where is he that is born king of the
[1:40:19] Jews? For we have seen his star in the
[1:40:22] east, and are come to worship him." When
[1:40:26] Herod the king had heard these things,
[1:40:28] he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with
[1:40:31] him. And when he had gathered all the
[1:40:34] chief priests and scribes of the people
[1:40:36] together, he demanded of them where
[1:40:39] Christ should be born.
[1:40:42] And they said unto him, "In Bethlehem of
[1:40:44] Judea, for thus it is written by the
[1:40:48] prophet, and thou Bethlehem in the land
[1:40:51] of Judah, art not the least among
[1:40:55] princes of Judah, for out of thee shall
[1:40:57] come a governor that shall rule my
[1:41:00] people Israel." Then Herod, when he had
[1:41:04] frivvily called the wi wise men,
[1:41:06] inquired of them diligently what time
[1:41:09] the star appeared. And he sent them to
[1:41:12] Bethlehem and said, "Go and search
[1:41:14] diligently for the young child. And when
[1:41:16] you have found him, bring word again
[1:41:19] that I may come and worship him also."
[1:41:22] When they had heard the king, they
[1:41:25] departed. And I like this here. And lo,
[1:41:29] the star which they saw in the east went
[1:41:32] before them
[1:41:34] till it came and stood over where the
[1:41:37] young child was. And when they saw the
[1:41:40] star, they rejoiced with exceeding great
[1:41:45] joy.
[1:41:48] Now another scripture we like to take is
[1:41:51] in Ephesians chapter number
[1:41:54] four.
[1:41:56] Verse
[1:42:02] number seven.
[1:42:13] But unto every one of us is given grace
[1:42:15] according to the measure of the gift of
[1:42:18] Christ. Wherefore he saith, when he
[1:42:20] ascended up on high, he left captivity
[1:42:23] captive, and he gave gifts unto men.
[1:42:28] Amen. Ephesians chapter, just the next
[1:42:31] chapter over, chapter number five in
[1:42:34] verse number
[1:42:37] 21. Submitting yourselves one to another
[1:42:40] in the fear of God. Wives, submit
[1:42:42] yourselves to your own husband as unto
[1:42:44] the Lord. The husband is the head of the
[1:42:47] wife, even as Christ is the head of the
[1:42:49] church, and he is the savior of the
[1:42:51] body. Therefore, as the church is
[1:42:54] subject unto Christ, so let the wives be
[1:42:56] to their own husbands in everything.
[1:42:59] Husbands, love your wives even as Christ
[1:43:02] also loved the church and he gave
[1:43:04] himself for it.
[1:43:09] That he might sanctify,
[1:43:11] cleanse it with the washing of the water
[1:43:14] by the word, that he might present it to
[1:43:16] himself a glorious church, not having
[1:43:20] spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but
[1:43:23] that it should be holy and without
[1:43:26] blemish. So ought men to love their
[1:43:28] wives as their own bodies. He that
[1:43:32] loveth his wife loveth himself.
[1:43:36] I'm going to title this message this
[1:43:38] morning. The greatest gift of all. The
[1:43:41] greatest gift of all. We'll pray one
[1:43:44] more time. Lord Jesus, we ask you to
[1:43:47] bless the word that we're going to bring
[1:43:49] this morning. Bless the saints in Mesa.
[1:43:52] Father, we thank you for this little
[1:43:55] group of people that have decided to
[1:43:58] follow you, Lord. I pray that you would
[1:44:01] uh speak to our hearts and give us
[1:44:03] exactly what we have need of today. It's
[1:44:05] in the mighty name of Jesus Christ we
[1:44:08] pray. Amen. God bless you. You may be
[1:44:10] seated. The greatest gift
[1:44:12] [clears throat] of all. This is the
[1:44:14] Christmas season that we call it. And if
[1:44:19] you just take the scriptures in Matthew
[1:44:21] chapter 2 and in [clears throat] St.
[1:44:24] Luke, these are the two Christmas
[1:44:27] stories that we um can have the, you
[1:44:31] know, the timeline of our Lord's first
[1:44:35] return, our first coming. And it's a
[1:44:39] two-year difference. Remember the magi,
[1:44:42] the wise men that came,
[1:44:45] they did not come to a manger. We just
[1:44:48] read it for you. They came into a house.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; So the magi did not, that scene you have
[1:44:55] of the nativity scene with the wise man
[1:44:57] standing over a little baby in the
[1:45:00] manger. That's not the scene. The
[1:45:03] shepherds saw Jesus in the manger.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; The wise men's met Jesus in a house.
[1:45:10] two-year difference. And so this is some
[1:45:14] of the myths that are dispelled. Also,
[1:45:17] December 25th
[1:45:19] is not the birth of our Lord Jesus. Even
[1:45:21] the many of the scholars know this. It
[1:45:23] was a convenient time to use for um you
[1:45:29] with the Roman gods and so forth. It
[1:45:32] just uh the early Christians
[1:45:36] will adopt it as a time to maybe
[1:45:40] commemorate his his birth or to
[1:45:44] recognize his it recognize his birth.
[1:45:46] The day really isn't uh in December,
[1:45:50] December the 25th. And actually the
[1:45:53] scripture don't give us the exact day,
[1:45:55] but we know and we believe it was not
[1:45:58] during December. It was not in the
[1:46:00] winter time.
[1:46:01] We also know that the wise men as we
[1:46:06] said come to a little child about two
[1:46:09] years old. This is why Herod sends this
[1:46:12] decree to go and kill all the children
[1:46:16] under two years old. So when did he
[1:46:18] really the really the first appearing
[1:46:21] was with the shepherds and the shepherds
[1:46:25] were out in the field doing whatever
[1:46:27] shepherds do and the angel of the Lord
[1:46:30] and the light shone on them in such a
[1:46:34] tremendous way. Now these shepherds
[1:46:37] these no-name people
[1:46:40] looks like it's just a random group of
[1:46:43] people. They're out in the field at
[1:46:45] night. Certainly, it wasn't wintertime
[1:46:49] with their herds. And the angels of the
[1:46:52] Lord came down and dealt with them and
[1:46:55] gave them a message. And when it gives
[1:46:57] them this message, they now leave from
[1:46:59] where they were and they travel to
[1:47:02] Bethlehem and they find where the little
[1:47:06] baby is with Joseph and Mary.
[1:47:11] They begin to praise the Lord. The
[1:47:15] scripture says the Lord made known to
[1:47:17] them that this was taking place. Brother
[1:47:21] Brandham preaches a message why it had
[1:47:23] to be shepherds. It's like nothing God
[1:47:27] does is random. Everything he does is on
[1:47:30] purpose.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; It's not a second thought. It's not just
[1:47:34] filling in the blanks. He does
[1:47:36] everything. It's by design. Even the way
[1:47:39] he made the human body, even the solar
[1:47:42] system, everything about a blade of
[1:47:45] grass, anything in God's creation has a
[1:47:48] design to it. And when God sent his
[1:47:51] word, this is by design as well.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; It was orchestrated very controversial.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; It is very highly people lost their life
[1:48:01] over this book. Many try to stop it from
[1:48:04] coming, but it came anyway. Many don't
[1:48:06] believe it today, but it's still here.
[1:48:09] And it is the greatest piece of word
[1:48:13] that you could ever read or ever have in
[1:48:15] your home, in your phone, in your head,
[1:48:19] or in your heart
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; is the word of the living God.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. It
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; it is by design.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; It was brought to us the way it was and
[1:48:31] the way it did. And this whole story
[1:48:34] with the shepherds now they begin to
[1:48:37] praise God. They went to send their
[1:48:39] message. They brought it forth. They
[1:48:41] left the field and went to Bethlehem.
[1:48:43] Says the Lord made it known to them. And
[1:48:46] then he they go to spread abroad what
[1:48:48] the Lord made known to them. And the
[1:48:50] Bible says that all of the people that
[1:48:54] heard wondered. Then they begin to
[1:48:57] glorify and praise God on their return.
[1:49:01] Then we see this little baby now going
[1:49:04] to be circumcised after the eighth day.
[1:49:08] Simeon in the temple. It was revealed
[1:49:10] unto him by the Holy Ghost to go and
[1:49:14] find this child. Anna who was also
[1:49:17] nearby
[1:49:18] 84 years old and still has the leading
[1:49:22] of the Holy Ghost in her life.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:26] You know, the Holy Ghost will deal with
[1:49:29] you at whatever age you are.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; You're never too old for the Holy Spirit
[1:49:35] to move
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; upon you.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; How many of you older saints can say
[1:49:41] praise the Lord to that? [applause]
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; How many some of you older saints can
[1:49:46] lead a praise break in here? [cheering]
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; You don't you don't need the young
[1:49:50] folks. You Some of you old saints. So,
[1:49:52] here's Anna, 84 years old, a widow.
[1:49:57] If you search the scripture and look at
[1:49:59] the widows, it's tremendous how God uses
[1:50:02] them, but we're not going to get into
[1:50:03] that this morning. But the Holy Spirit
[1:50:06] deals with Anna, 84 years old, and
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; and leads her and gives the prophecy
[1:50:14] over this child. So, this is two years
[1:50:18] before the magi even come. The wise men
[1:50:21] come two years later. This is already
[1:50:24] taking place. And then when the magi
[1:50:26] come, this is what starts the great
[1:50:29] eruption in Jerusalem. Herod comes after
[1:50:33] the child is trying to find him. Cause
[1:50:36] great trauma in Bethlehem by putting to
[1:50:40] death the all the children two years old
[1:50:43] and younger. It was a prophecy that that
[1:50:46] would be that way. It was terrible. It
[1:50:49] was horrible. But it was all in the
[1:50:52] scripture. We see this um man Joseph.
[1:50:58] Why was Joseph chosen to be the husband
[1:51:02] of Mary? He was a widowerower. Brother
[1:51:03] Vandom says or the scripture tells us.
[1:51:06] And brother Vandom says he was about 45
[1:51:08] years old. Mary a teenager. There was a
[1:51:12] a spouse to get married. And the angel
[1:51:16] of the Lord appears to Joseph in a
[1:51:18] dream. Just a simple guy, humble guy.
[1:51:22] You know, you never hear of Joseph after
[1:51:24] the birth of Christ. There's no
[1:51:26] scriptures where Joseph said anything.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; The Bible doesn't credit him for
[1:51:30] speaking anything, but he did what was
[1:51:33] supposed to be done.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; He was in the lineage of David.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he was a righteous man
[1:51:40] and God came to him and told him what to
[1:51:43] do and he did just exactly what the Lord
[1:51:45] told him to do. We don't see Joseph at
[1:51:48] Jesus's crucifixion. We don't see Joseph
[1:51:52] mentioned in his ministry at all. But I
[1:51:55] believe God knew who he was.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; H
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:52:00] Yes. And he knows who you are, too.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; So this is Joseph. He chose Joseph.
[1:52:06] Angels and shepherds. And then Jesus
[1:52:10] being presented and then the wise men
[1:52:13] and then the flight going into Egypt.
[1:52:16] And this is the greatest gift that God
[1:52:21] could ever give humanity was to give his
[1:52:25] own son for the ransom of many.
[1:52:30] Interesting.
[1:52:32] Most believers,
[1:52:34] the real true believers don't focus on
[1:52:37] his first birth like others do. Most
[1:52:41] believers, we we we we really preach his
[1:52:44] death, his resurrection, and his soon
[1:52:48] coming.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; This is the next event that happens is
[1:52:52] the coming of the Lord.
[1:52:55] And the greatest singular event that if
[1:52:59] you ask a believer, you ask a Christian,
[1:53:01] he's going to refer you to the great
[1:53:03] judgment day
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; that is to come.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; The heaven and our going into our
[1:53:11] heavenly home that is to come. The
[1:53:15] coming of the Lord that is in our
[1:53:17] future. But Christmas and remembering
[1:53:21] his birth is the past. It already
[1:53:24] happened. But it's nice to go back and
[1:53:26] look and see the events that took place.
[1:53:29] How how he came the first time and what
[1:53:32] was the purpose of his coming, the
[1:53:34] greatest gift that could ever be given.
[1:53:37] The pro the prophecies surrounding his
[1:53:41] life were tremendous. And we're going to
[1:53:43] go in the message here just for a moment
[1:53:45] and see what the prophet says about
[1:53:47] these three stars that came together.
[1:53:50] And the message early spiritual
[1:53:53] experiences. If you remember, brother
[1:53:55] Brandham was dealing before he became a
[1:53:58] Christian, he had these magi or the
[1:54:02] stargazers would approach him. And one
[1:54:06] specifically approached him and who had
[1:54:08] a son that was a minister and and began
[1:54:11] to talk to him about how she knew his
[1:54:14] date of birth.
[1:54:16] and he denied and and she went forward
[1:54:19] to tell him exactly the date of his
[1:54:22] birth and the time that he was born.
[1:54:25] This is a perfect stranger. And this is
[1:54:28] the woman who read the solar system, who
[1:54:31] read the stars. And this was her
[1:54:34] explanation to the prophet. Notice it's
[1:54:37] not a minister. It wasn't the a
[1:54:40] theological explanation. And this is a a
[1:54:43] woman who was trained in the discipline
[1:54:46] of following the stars and following the
[1:54:48] lights. And you'll see how these wise
[1:54:52] men were led by this pillar of fire. The
[1:54:56] the pillar of fire led them to
[1:54:59] Jerusalem. The pillar of fire led them
[1:55:02] to where the Christ child was. Let me
[1:55:05] say this. If if the pillar of fire ain't
[1:55:08] leading you, you will remain to be lost
[1:55:14] and without direction in your life.
[1:55:17] You'll never find clarity.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; YOU'LL NEVER FIND your purpose until A
[1:55:24] PILLAR OF FIRE REVEALS HIMSELF and
[1:55:27] begins to lead you.
[1:55:30] NOTHING GREATER THAN FOR A SON or a
[1:55:33] daughter of God to be led by the spirit
[1:55:37] of God.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your school master can tell you
[1:55:42] this. The government can tell you this.
[1:55:45] The preacher can tell you one thing, BUT
[1:55:47] WHEN YOU'RE LED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT,
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; it's another level of him dealing with
[1:55:52] you.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; He leads by his spirit. Hear what the
[1:55:56] prophet says here.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:00] And she said, "You was born on April the
[1:56:02] 6th at 5:00 in the morning, 1909." I
[1:56:05] said, "That's right." I said, "Tell this
[1:56:06] sailor when he was born." She said, "I
[1:56:09] couldn't do it." Well, I said, "Why
[1:56:10] can't you tell him if you could tell
[1:56:13] me?" She said, "Because you were born
[1:56:16] under a sign.
[1:56:18] I don't know when that was to appear."
[1:56:21] She said, "Has ministers never talked to
[1:56:24] you?" I said, "I have nothing to do with
[1:56:26] preachers." I said, 'I don't have
[1:56:28] nothing at all to do with them at all.
[1:56:31] I'd always run from it, you know,
[1:56:33] thinking that, speaking to me, and I
[1:56:35] know that that was the same thing my
[1:56:37] mama told me them things was of the
[1:56:39] devil. I stayed away from them. See? And
[1:56:42] I said, "No, sir. I have nothing to do
[1:56:44] with it." She said, "Well, nobody ever
[1:56:46] told you that." She said, "Isn't it
[1:56:48] strange that preachers wouldn't know
[1:56:50] that?"
[1:56:52] I said, "I don't fool around where
[1:56:54] they're at."
[1:56:56] And I said, 'I thank you very much.' She
[1:56:58] said, 'Well, look, you were born under a
[1:57:00] sign. I want to tell you this as a gift.
[1:57:04] And she said, 'If you'd only could
[1:57:06] recognize it.' I said, "Yes, ma'am." I
[1:57:09] said, "Maybe I will be a Daniel Boone. I
[1:57:12] like to hunt. I was born in Kentucky."
[1:57:14] She says, "Like that?" She says, "No."
[1:57:17] She said, she called me. She says, "No,
[1:57:19] that ain't what I'm talking about."
[1:57:21] Well, maybe I'd be a businessman. I got
[1:57:23] a grammar school education. She said,
[1:57:25] "That's not what I'm talking about. I
[1:57:27] don't know what you'd be, but I know
[1:57:30] that according to astronomy that on that
[1:57:33] time," she tried to tell me about this
[1:57:35] of the cycles and in commemoration of
[1:57:38] the son of God, when three stars came
[1:57:40] together, she said there was three wise
[1:57:44] men. The Magi was following three
[1:57:46] different stars. They didn't know when
[1:57:49] they were coming.
[1:57:51] When they gathered together and met each
[1:57:53] other at Bethlehem gate, following three
[1:57:57] different stars, they formed the one
[1:58:00] morning star that hung over Christ. And
[1:58:03] she said one was from the lineage of
[1:58:05] Ham, Sham, and Jeff, the three sons of
[1:58:09] Noah. It said those three stars went
[1:58:12] together and made the one star that hung
[1:58:14] over Christ. It said then when they
[1:58:17] separated they never went to their
[1:58:19] orbits. They never been since it says
[1:58:22] now all the stargazers in the country
[1:58:25] never seen such as that and they never
[1:58:28] noticed it. It was just supernaturally
[1:58:30] given.
[1:58:32] And on talking like that with all of her
[1:58:34] stuff, well, I couldn't understand what
[1:58:36] she was talking about. She said, "In
[1:58:39] commemoration of that greatest gift that
[1:58:42] God ever give the earth, he sends back a
[1:58:46] something lesser in commemoration of
[1:58:50] that time." Well, I said, "Lady, I'm not
[1:58:53] a Christian. I have nothing to do with
[1:58:54] preachers. I have nothing to do with I
[1:58:57] don't know nothing about the star." So
[1:58:59] here, brother Vanam is sharing with us
[1:59:02] that this stargazer is identifying his
[1:59:06] date of birth and showing that when
[1:59:10] those planets align and crossed that in
[1:59:14] commemoration, God sends another great
[1:59:17] gift in commemoration of the greatest
[1:59:20] gift.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Now he says it again in how the angel
[1:59:23] came to me paragraph 186. Now these
[1:59:26] three wise men came when they when they
[1:59:29] three stars they come from different
[1:59:32] directions. They met at Bethlehem and
[1:59:34] they said they found out and consulted
[1:59:37] one from the lineage of Ham, Sham and
[1:59:40] Jeff, the three sons of Noah. She said
[1:59:42] then they come and worship the Lord
[1:59:44] Jesus Christ. When they departed, they
[1:59:47] brought gifts and put to him and said
[1:59:51] Jesus Christ said in his ministry that
[1:59:54] when this gospel has been preached to
[1:59:56] all the world, Ham, Sham, and Jeff's
[1:59:58] people, then he would come again. Now,
[2:00:01] those planets, heavenly planets, as they
[2:00:04] moved around, they separated. They never
[2:00:07] been on the earth since, but said every
[2:00:10] so many hundred years they cross their
[2:00:14] cycles like this. There happens to be an
[2:00:16] astrometer here. You might know what
[2:00:18] she's talking about. I don't. So when
[2:00:21] she was SAID THEY CROSSED LIKE THAT AND
[2:00:24] said in commemoration of the greatest
[2:00:27] gift that was ever given to mankind when
[2:00:30] God gave his son when these planets
[2:00:32] crossed themselves again why he said he
[2:00:35] sends another gift to the earth and said
[2:00:39] you were born on the crossing of that
[2:00:41] time and that's the reason I knew it.
[2:00:45] Amen. So this greatest gift that we see
[2:00:49] happening in Matthew chapter 2, chapter
[2:00:53] 1, Luke chapter 1 and chapter 2, in
[2:00:56] commemoration of those, we see what's
[2:00:59] happening here in 1909.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; In the ministry of of the Reverend
[2:01:07] William Brham, Amen.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; had a tremendous gift. this explanation
[2:01:12] is being given to him that it was a
[2:01:16] commemoration.
[2:01:17] Now this [clears throat]
[2:01:20] um these wise men or the stargazers that
[2:01:24] were led to the Christ child, they were
[2:01:27] led by looking at their the the lights
[2:01:30] and the the heavenly bodies how they
[2:01:32] lined up and these three stars came
[2:01:36] together and made one. That's a detail
[2:01:39] we don't know in the scripture. The
[2:01:41] prophet gives us that detail. And those
[2:01:44] three stars represents the three peoples
[2:01:48] of the world. The three sons of Noah,
[2:01:52] Sham, Ham, and Jeff. It's a
[2:01:55] representative from all of those nations
[2:01:58] that saw this star.
[2:02:01] This came together in Bethlehem and
[2:02:04] begin to worship him. When that star
[2:02:07] came to Bethlehem, the the the the
[2:02:11] scribes and the priests Herod wanted to
[2:02:14] find out what is this all about. So they
[2:02:16] went and searched the scripture. They're
[2:02:19] a couple of years late, but they
[2:02:21] searched the scripture and THEY FOUND
[2:02:23] OUT THAT IT WAS A PROPHECY THAT IN
[2:02:25] little Bethlehem there would be a
[2:02:27] governor arise. What were they doing all
[2:02:30] this time? Sleeping. What were they
[2:02:32] doing? BUT THEY FOUND OUT THE PROPHETS
[2:02:35] ALREADY PROPHESIED THAT THIS WOULD TAKE
[2:02:37] PLACE. AND WHILE THE CHURCH IS NOW FIRST
[2:02:40] GETTING ITS first awakening, they were
[2:02:44] two years late BECAUSE HE HAD ALREADY
[2:02:47] BEEN BORN
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; AND THE SHEPHERDS ALREADY RECOGNIZED him
[2:02:51] and THE MESSAGE HAD ALREADY STARTED
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; AND LIVES WERE BEING TOUCHED,
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; changed and the ministry already
[2:03:00] started. Thank the Lord.
[2:03:03] Because the shepherds had GOT THIS
[2:03:05] REVELATION. NOW, HOW DO YOU GET THIS
[2:03:06] REVELATION? Do you have to be smart? Do
[2:03:10] you have to be the most popular? Do you
[2:03:12] have to be the most willing? No. It's
[2:03:14] God by his grace. God by his sovereign
[2:03:18] grace bestows that upon you. And that,
[2:03:23] my friend, is what a gift is. A gift is
[2:03:26] something freely given.
[2:03:29] something that's not earned or owed.
[2:03:33] Like salvation is a gift.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Grace is a gift.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is a gift. Eternal life,
[2:03:43] that's a gift.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Those are not things you work for. Those
[2:03:47] are not things that you deserve. You can
[2:03:49] never be good enough to get them. YOU
[2:03:52] EITHER HAVE THEM OR YOU DON'T. AND IF
[2:03:55] YOU DO HAVE [screaming] THEM, IT'S GOD'S
[2:03:57] GRACE THAT GAVE IT TO YOU.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT TRADING. YOU KNOW, OUR
[2:04:01] CHRISTMAS gift giving has become
[2:04:03] trading. You give me a gift, I give you
[2:04:05] one. THAT'S TRADING. THAT'S not gift
[2:04:07] giving.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Gift giving is you just give me a gift,
[2:04:10] I don't give you nothing.
[2:04:13] Or did I say that right? I give you a
[2:04:15] gift and you don't give me nothing. That
[2:04:18] feel better?
[2:04:20] WE MADE CHRISTMAS A TRADEOFF.
[2:04:24] You giving me a gift this year? Oh, man.
[2:04:25] You give me a gift. Ah, I got to get you
[2:04:27] one, too.
[2:04:30] It comes with stress.
[2:04:33] It's like the end of the year with
[2:04:34] taxes. It's to the point where I don't
[2:04:37] want any money back from the government
[2:04:39] and I don't want to pay anything. Leave
[2:04:41] me alone. I'll leave y'all alone. You
[2:04:43] keep whatever and I'll keep whatever.
[2:04:46] AND GIFTGIVING IS COMING SO STRESSFUL.
[2:04:52] Why does it HAVE TO BE SO STRESSFUL?
[2:04:53] IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A FREE GIFT.
[2:04:56] But if I give you a gift and you didn't
[2:04:58] give me one, tell me why you feel
[2:05:00] guilty.
[2:05:02] Because you're trading.
[2:05:05] Oh, brother gave me a gift. I forgot
[2:05:07] about him. He's going to feel sideways
[2:05:08] if I don't give him a gift.
[2:05:12] Pressure.
[2:05:14] But gifts that are freely given, like
[2:05:17] when you woke up this morning
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; and was able to breathe.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; WHAT DID YOU PAY FOR THAT BREATH? WHAT
[2:05:26] DID YOU GIVE TO DESERVE IT?
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; WHO GAVE IT TO YOU
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S nothing you can do
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; to earn it?
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; It's a gift. And the word of the Lord is
[2:05:42] full of these great fine gifts.
[2:05:46] The Holy Ghost is a gift.
[2:05:48] Salvation is a gift is freely given.
[2:05:52] And so these gifts now become a part of
[2:05:58] who we are. Now let's take in this
[2:06:00] message here
[2:06:02] Ephesians 5:21.
[2:06:05] And I want to deal with this in
[2:06:09] the message impersonation of
[2:06:10] Christianity. Paragraph 61, prophet of
[2:06:12] God says this. Now notice then the
[2:06:16] worshipper comes before God with this
[2:06:18] appropriate blood appropriated. It is
[2:06:20] the blood of the redeemer that redeems
[2:06:22] us. You put yourself in the pawn shop by
[2:06:25] sin. Adam put you in the pawn shop, but
[2:06:28] Christ came and he's your redeemer.
[2:06:31] [snorts]
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; You belong to Christ. God gave you to
[2:06:34] Christ. as a love gift for his
[2:06:37] sacrifice.
[2:06:39] And you are brought to Christ by the
[2:06:41] Holy Spirit who wooed you through the
[2:06:44] blood of the Lord Jesus and presented
[2:06:46] him as a gift. And God loves his gifts
[2:06:50] and he will not stand to see them
[2:06:52] destroyed.
[2:06:54] So you become a gift, a love gift to
[2:06:58] Christ.
[2:07:00] Paragraph 62. minister asked another one
[2:07:03] the other day which now pardon this has
[2:07:06] just a little bit of my own doctrine in
[2:07:08] it but in the tabernacle we do that now
[2:07:10] one fellow asked another the other day
[2:07:12] he says do you believe don't you believe
[2:07:15] if a man was once a child of God born of
[2:07:18] the spirit of God washed in the blood of
[2:07:20] the redeemed thoroughly by God by the
[2:07:23] renewing of his heart by the washing of
[2:07:25] the water by the blood through the word
[2:07:29] and becomes a child of God. Don't you
[2:07:32] think that person could sin and get away
[2:07:35] from God to where he would be lost?
[2:07:38] [snorts]
[2:07:39] And the minister who talking being a
[2:07:42] very good Bible student said, "I'll
[2:07:44] answer your question if you answer
[2:07:46] mine."
[2:07:48] Do you think that a man could be so good
[2:07:51] that he wouldn't lie, steal, or do
[2:07:54] anything bad, but he would be SO GOOD
[2:07:56] THAT GOD WOULD receive him into heaven
[2:07:59] without the blood of Christ?
[2:08:02] No, of course not.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; YOU COULD NOT GO TO HEAVEN WITHOUT THE
[2:08:07] BLOOD of the Lord Jesus. NO MATTER HOW
[2:08:10] GOOD you are, it's only a self-made
[2:08:13] righteousness.
[2:08:15] And we're don't go to heaven on a
[2:08:17] self-made righteousness. No matter how
[2:08:19] good you are, it's totally impossible
[2:08:23] for you to get to heaven on your own
[2:08:25] goodness.
[2:08:27] It's the mercy OF GOD THAT BROUGHT YOU
[2:08:31] AT CALVARY.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOD'S [screaming] LOVE GIFT TO
[2:08:34] CHRIST. And if God gave A GIFT TO
[2:08:37] CHRIST, Christ keeps his gift. All that
[2:08:41] comes to me, the Father giveth me, will
[2:08:44] come to me, and none of them are lost.
[2:08:46] I'll raise him up at the last day. I
[2:08:49] would really love for that to settle in
[2:08:52] our hearts and our minds. There is
[2:08:54] nothing that you can do to deserve to go
[2:08:59] to heaven there. IT'S TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE
[2:09:03] FOR YOU TO BECOME GOOD ENOUGH TO MAKE IT
[2:09:06] over there. IT HAS TO BE A PURE 100%
[2:09:12] LOVE GIFT FROM THE ALMIGHTY GOD THAT
[2:09:16] GIVES YOU THE gift of eternal life, the
[2:09:19] gift of salvation.
[2:09:21] He makes it clear. He makes it plain to
[2:09:23] you. And now we try to turn it into
[2:09:26] works. So many times we try to get good
[2:09:29] enough. WE TRY TO GET BETTER. WE TRY TO
[2:09:32] do and work our way into some penance or
[2:09:37] some you know payback like Lord you did
[2:09:41] this for me so YOU SCRATCH MY BACK I'LL
[2:09:43] SCRATCH YOUR BACK NO it doesn't work
[2:09:45] that way the prophet says is if it was
[2:09:48] just AS MUCH AS GOD JUST MOVING YOUR TIE
[2:09:51] TO STRAIGHTEN your tie just a little bit
[2:09:53] just in that action OF STRAIGHTENING THE
[2:09:56] TIE FOR YOU THAT STILL WOULDN'T merit
[2:09:58] anything there there's some works uh
[2:10:01] involved D in it. You can't YOU CAN'T
[2:10:03] STRAIGHTEN HIS TIE OR HIM STRAIGHTEN
[2:10:05] YOUR TIE TO MAKE YOU GOOD ENOUGH. IT IS
[2:10:07] his goodness and his goodness alone,
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; not our works.
[2:10:14] But it's in totally impossible. And that
[2:10:16] really is the gift, isn't it? That's the
[2:10:19] gift that we're talking about. But the
[2:10:22] myth is
[2:10:24] what it's become is this commercialized
[2:10:26] day of trading gifts
[2:10:30] and um the stress of giving the gifts
[2:10:34] and becoming um uh less worshipful
[2:10:39] and more ungrateful because of the gifts
[2:10:42] that we receive or don't receive. But
[2:10:45] Christmas is about giving. And it's
[2:10:48] about worship and it's about giving
[2:10:51] those gifts to the giver himself. And he
[2:10:55] now in turn gives you makes you one of
[2:10:59] his own and then he makes you a gift to
[2:11:03] Christ. You become a love gift from God
[2:11:07] to Christ. That's what Ephesians 5 is
[2:11:11] talking about. He presents you. He
[2:11:14] cleanses you. He makes you faultless and
[2:11:17] then he presents you as a spotless
[2:11:21] bride. He does all that and then he
[2:11:25] presents you as a gift. Let's read it
[2:11:28] one more time. Ephesians chapter number
[2:11:30] five quickly.
[2:11:42] Verse 26. that he might sanctify and
[2:11:44] cleanse it with the washing of the water
[2:11:46] by the word. So he takes his church,
[2:11:50] washes it by the washing and the water
[2:11:52] of the word that he might do what to it?
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; Present it to who?
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; Himself a glorious church. Let me say
[2:12:02] this and I've said this many times. The
[2:12:05] best person that can shop for me is me.
[2:12:10] I know exactly what I want.
[2:12:14] It's nice to get gifts from other
[2:12:15] people. It's beautiful. It's nice. But
[2:12:17] when I really have my my own option, my
[2:12:20] own desires, I I I see what I like and
[2:12:24] that's what I want. Right? And then
[2:12:26] Jesus, God takes this church,
[2:12:31] glorious church, and he presents it to
[2:12:34] himself,
[2:12:36] not having a spot or a wrinkle or any
[2:12:38] such thing. but that it should be holy
[2:12:41] and without blemish. So the gifts that
[2:12:45] God gives, they're high caliber gifts.
[2:12:49] They're quality gifts.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; They're gifts that maybe others can't
[2:12:54] see, but he sees the beauty in them.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; And when God calls a man or a woman, he
[2:13:00] chooses that individual from those
[2:13:03] lineages, Ham, Sham, and Jeff. And those
[2:13:06] are his choices. and he cleanses them
[2:13:10] AND HE WASHES THEM BY THE WORD and he
[2:13:14] CLEANS UP THEIR LIVES FOR THE PURPOSE of
[2:13:17] presenting it to himself.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering]
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; A gift really speaks of the giver.
[2:13:27] Speaks of the giver. You look at the
[2:13:28] gifts that are given. You look at the
[2:13:31] value of a gift. It speaks of the giver.
[2:13:33] Many times
[2:13:36] he speaks of the person that's
[2:13:38] receiving. There's some relatability
[2:13:41] between the giver and the receiver and
[2:13:44] the gift kind of bridges that together
[2:13:47] says a lot of what we think. You know
[2:13:50] Jesus says if you come to the altar and
[2:13:54] you realize your brother you have a
[2:13:56] ought with him says to leave your gift
[2:13:59] at the altar and then go make things
[2:14:02] right with your brother. The gift also
[2:14:05] in the scripture the priests Hebrews 8:4
[2:14:09] said the priests offer gifts. And so
[2:14:12] whether you realize it or not that your
[2:14:14] praise and your worship today was an
[2:14:17] offering. It was a gift that each of us
[2:14:21] give to him. It's not about the praise
[2:14:24] and worship leader. It's not about who's
[2:14:27] leading the song service.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; But you have come to offer a gift at the
[2:14:33] altar to him who loved you.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; AND THOSE GIFTS, THE QUALITY OF THEM
[2:14:40] SPEAK OF WHAT YOU think about him.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; The wise men gave three gifts. Those
[2:14:45] three gifts were the gold, the
[2:14:47] frankincense, and the myrr. Speaking of
[2:14:51] their thought, their revelation of what
[2:14:53] this king would be
[2:14:56] was deeper than just, you know, th those
[2:15:00] those gifts had depth to them. They were
[2:15:03] meaningful. They had a meaning behind
[2:15:06] them. He's just a little boy. He's two
[2:15:09] years old. What are you giving this boy
[2:15:11] gold for? What are you giving him
[2:15:13] frankincense for? What are you giving
[2:15:16] him this myrr for? It was speaking of
[2:15:20] their revelation of who he was.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; And when you bring gifts to him, it's a
[2:15:26] revelation that speaks of your
[2:15:27] revelation that you have of him.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; So you move beyond what others are doing
[2:15:34] or saying
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; and what others are giving. You move via
[2:15:38] revelation LIKE THESE WISE MEN, like the
[2:15:42] shepherds, like Anne AND SIMEON, LIKE
[2:15:46] ALL OF THOSE THAT COME TO HIM. THERE'S A
[2:15:49] REVELATION THAT MOVES YOU. And this
[2:15:52] revelation, this purifier that leads and
[2:15:55] guides, opens up to you on how to give.
[2:15:59] Lord, show me how to worship. I remember
[2:16:03] the DISCIPLES ASKED JESUS, TEACH ME how
[2:16:05] to pray. And some people just run off
[2:16:07] praying and they don't know how. You
[2:16:09] don't know how to pray, ask the Lord to
[2:16:11] teach you. If you don't know how to
[2:16:13] worship, you can ask the Lord. Lord,
[2:16:15] teach me how to worship you. If you
[2:16:17] don't know how to PRAISE HIM WITH ALL OF
[2:16:19] YOUR HEART, YOU SHOULD ASK HIM, LORD,
[2:16:21] teach me how to praise you, how to
[2:16:24] worship you, and stop following the
[2:16:27] crowd. Amen. It's a gift.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; We bring those gifts to the altar. Now,
[2:16:33] not all gifts should be received.
[2:16:36] Everybody that gives a gift, uh, you
[2:16:39] can't receive gifts from everybody,
[2:16:41] right? The scriptures are clear in that.
[2:16:43] I think it's in there's a um a few Old
[2:16:46] Testament scriptures are talking about
[2:16:48] not receiving gifts because of it clouds
[2:16:52] the judgment.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; And there's not everybody that wants to
[2:16:56] give you something. You shouldn't
[2:16:58] receive everything FROM EVERYBODY. IF
[2:17:00] GOD IS trying to give you something, you
[2:17:02] receive that. But sometimes people want
[2:17:04] to give you stuff BECAUSE THEY HAVE
[2:17:07] SOMETHING up their sleeve. They have
[2:17:09] another thing working. They want to bind
[2:17:12] you to them and befriend you so you can
[2:17:16] lack in your judgment. And I'll say
[2:17:19] this, no matter what the gift is, I
[2:17:22] think the gift of wisdom is greater than
[2:17:25] any monetary or physical gift that
[2:17:27] anybody can give you. Lord, give me
[2:17:29] wisdom to know what to receive and what
[2:17:34] not to receive. Amen. So
[2:17:38] Christ is
[2:17:42] a gift to the world. His church becomes
[2:17:46] a gift to him. The prophet says this
[2:17:48] here. He says
[2:17:51] you paragraph 65, you could not go to
[2:17:54] HEAVEN WITHOUT THE BLOOD OF the Lord
[2:17:55] Jesus. No matter how good you are. It's
[2:17:58] only self-made righteousness.
[2:18:01] And we don't go to heaven on self-made
[2:18:03] righteousness. No matter how good you
[2:18:05] are, it's totally impossible for you to
[2:18:08] get to heaven on your goodness. It's the
[2:18:12] mercy of God that brought you at
[2:18:13] Calvary. And you ARE GOD'S LOVE gift to
[2:18:17] Christ. And if God gave A GIFT TO
[2:18:20] CHRIST, Christ keeps his gifts. All that
[2:18:24] comes to me, all that the father has
[2:18:26] given me will come to me and none of
[2:18:29] them are lost. I'll raise them up at the
[2:18:31] last day. Now, you might be emotionally
[2:18:33] worked up. You might have oil through
[2:18:35] your hands or speak with tongues, dance
[2:18:37] in the spirit, or join the church or
[2:18:39] some fantastics of the day, and you can
[2:18:42] be lost. Certainly, that's right. BUT IF
[2:18:44] YOU'RE GOD'S LOVE GIFT to Christ, you
[2:18:47] are safe. Now, your life will prove what
[2:18:50] you are. by their fruits you shall know
[2:18:52] it. If you're trying to make yourself
[2:18:55] act sweet and humble and so forth, then
[2:18:59] you are still on the outside of the
[2:19:00] kingdom. It's your own works then. And
[2:19:04] that's where the church, the people,
[2:19:07] so-called church have so miserably
[2:19:10] failed is because it's in their own
[2:19:14] personal work that they feel that they
[2:19:17] merit the goodness and the grace of God
[2:19:20] by what they do and how they live. But
[2:19:23] that has not one thing to do with it. It
[2:19:27] is a gift of God. Can I get a witness
[2:19:30] here today?
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; It's not our merits. It's not our good
[2:19:33] deeds. is not how much we give. It's not
[2:19:36] all of our sacrifice. That comes with an
[2:19:39] appreciation. That just comes with our
[2:19:41] service. But we don't do those things to
[2:19:44] find favor. We don't do those things to
[2:19:46] make it into heaven. He has to give us
[2:19:49] those gifts. And the prophet of God is
[2:19:52] telling us that's where the church, the
[2:19:54] people socalled have miserably failed.
[2:19:59] They failed in making it based on works.
[2:20:04] Remember, if God wants you to know
[2:20:06] something, he knows exactly where you
[2:20:08] are.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; He knows where to find you. Gabriel
[2:20:12] found Zacharias in the temple. Gabriel
[2:20:17] found Mary where she was living. The
[2:20:19] angels of the LORD FOUND THE SHEPHERDS
[2:20:22] OUT ON the field. THE HOLY SPIRIT
[2:20:24] REVEALED HIMSELF TO SIMEON. IT WASN'T
[2:20:27] JUST GOING OUT FINDING ANYTHING. They
[2:20:29] were who they were. And because OF GOD'S
[2:20:32] GREAT LOVE gift to them, it came to
[2:20:35] them.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; And let me TELL YOU SOMETHING, YOU
[2:20:38] didn't find God.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; GOD WASN'T LOST.
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; YOU WAS LOST.
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; AND HE FOUND YOU. [screaming]
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; AND HE FOUND YOU WITH HIS LOVE, HIS
[2:20:50] GRACE, AND HIS MERCY.
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; How we can labor on that? that is by his
[2:21:00] grace that's been given to us. You know
[2:21:03] this pillar of fire that has come down
[2:21:06] in this day. Great commemoration gift
[2:21:10] showing God's great message of the hour
[2:21:14] would come down in this generation and
[2:21:17] bring to us the truth of God. How many
[2:21:20] of us was trying to find the pillar of
[2:21:23] fire or did the pillar of fire find us?
[2:21:27] caught our attention, didn't it? Wanted
[2:21:30] us to see what's this great sight.
[2:21:32] What's going on? Moses in the
[2:21:35] wilderness. The bun the the the the the
[2:21:39] tree burned but was not consumed this
[2:21:42] fire. And when Moses saw it, he says,
[2:21:44] "Let's turn aside to see what this great
[2:21:47] sight is." The Lord found Moses where he
[2:21:51] was. The Lord finds you where you are
[2:21:54] and he calls you and he makes you who
[2:21:57] you are. And that's by his grace. Amen.
[2:22:00] It's totally impossible to get to heaven
[2:22:03] without this grace coming to you. Then
[2:22:07] make this point here that you become the
[2:22:09] gift of God. God keeps his gift. You
[2:22:13] become a love gift. He's cleaning your
[2:22:17] life up to present you back to himself.
[2:22:22] He purchased you out of the pawn shop.
[2:22:24] He restored you, refinished you, cleaned
[2:22:26] you up, gave you a good paint job, added
[2:22:30] some screws and some putty, cleaned it
[2:22:32] up, fixed it, and made you perfectly
[2:22:35] what he wanted you to be. And then he
[2:22:38] presented you back to himself to Christ.
[2:22:41] Now you become the love gift. Now,
[2:22:47] this second coming is really the
[2:22:51] Christmas that we don't want to miss.
[2:22:54] That's really the coming of the Lord
[2:22:56] that we all shall see him.
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; I was not in Bethlehem to be a part of
[2:23:03] that Christmas there. But the coming of
[2:23:06] the Lord is the greatest event that
[2:23:09] we're all looking forward to. Remember
[2:23:11] saints, he is coming soon and he's
[2:23:16] coming back again like the scripture
[2:23:18] said he would. This is the prophecy.
[2:23:20] This is the promise that's laying ahead
[2:23:23] of us. The Christian church is waiting
[2:23:26] for the coming of the Lord. He's coming
[2:23:29] again. He's coming in great power. He's
[2:23:32] coming to receive his own. Amen. Take a
[2:23:37] few scriptures for you on that.
[2:23:42] In St. John 14 1-3 says, "Let not your
[2:23:45] heart be troubled. You believe in God,
[2:23:47] believe also in me. In my father's house
[2:23:49] are many mansions. If it were not so, I
[2:23:52] would have told you. I go to prepare a
[2:23:56] place for you. And if I go and prepare a
[2:23:59] place for you, I will come again and
[2:24:03] receive you unto myself, that where I
[2:24:06] am, there ye may be also." But what a
[2:24:09] tremendous promise. Are you looking
[2:24:11] forward to that promise? The coming
[2:24:15] going to this place that he has prepared
[2:24:17] for you. Matthew 24:30. And then there
[2:24:21] shall appear the sign of the son of man
[2:24:22] in heaven. And then shall all the tribes
[2:24:25] of the earth mourn. They shall see the
[2:24:27] son of man coming in the clouds of
[2:24:29] heaven with power and great glory. And
[2:24:32] he shall send his angels with a great
[2:24:35] sound of a trumpet. and they shall
[2:24:37] gather together his elect from the four
[2:24:39] winds from one end of heaven to the
[2:24:42] other. Amen.
[2:24:45] Verse 36, but of that day and hour
[2:24:48] knoweth no man, know not the angels of
[2:24:51] heaven, but my father only.
[2:24:54] Verse 44,
[2:24:56] therefore be ye also what?
[2:25:00] Be ye also ready.
[2:25:03] FOR IN SUCH AN HOUR AS you think not,
[2:25:06] the son of man cometh. How many believe
[2:25:09] that
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; he's coming soon? That's the great
[2:25:13] Christmas. That's really not the
[2:25:15] Christmas. That's the coming.
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; That's really the coming of the Lord
[2:25:19] that we want to be ready for. He's
[2:25:22] coming in the clouds. Amen.
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; Acts 1:9. And when he had spoke these
[2:25:29] things, while they beheld, he was taken
[2:25:31] up, and a cloud received him out of
[2:25:33] their sight. And while they looked
[2:25:35] steadfastly towards heaven, as he went
[2:25:37] up, behold, two men stood by them in
[2:25:39] white a pearl, which also said, "Ye men
[2:25:42] of Galilea, why stand ye gazing up into
[2:25:45] heaven. This same Jesus, which is taken
[2:25:49] up from you into heaven, shall come in
[2:25:52] like manner, as you have seen him go
[2:25:55] into the heavens. Now, these are
[2:25:58] documents. These are prophecies. These
[2:26:00] are the scriptures that are in your
[2:26:03] Bible speaking of his soon coming. Why
[2:26:07] stand ye gazing? The same Jesus shall
[2:26:11] return again. 1 Thessalonians 4:16,
[2:26:15] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[2:26:17] heaven with a shout, with the voice of
[2:26:19] the archangel, WITH THE TRUMP OF GOD. WE
[2:26:22] KNOW THAT SHOUT is the message calling
[2:26:25] the bride together.
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; Shout the voice THE TRUMP OF GOD AND THE
[2:26:30] DEAD IN CHRIST. WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO
[2:26:31] DO?
[2:26:33] They shall rise first. Then we which are
[2:26:37] alive and remain. What's going to
[2:26:38] happen?
[2:26:41] Where's everybody at this morning?
[2:26:44] What's going to happen? WE SHALL BE
[2:26:46] CAUGHT UP TOGETHER
[2:26:48] WITH THEM IN THE CLOUDS TO DO WHAT? TO
[2:26:52] meet the Lord in the air. We're meeting
[2:26:54] everywhere else. We're going to meet
[2:26:55] over here, meet over, but we're going to
[2:26:57] meet the Lord in the air.
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; THERE WILL BE A SHOUT, A VOICE IN THE
[2:27:02] TRUMPET.
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; We which are alive and remain.
[2:27:07] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; Then we which are alive and remain shall
[2:27:11] be caught up together with them in the
[2:27:13] clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and
[2:27:15] so shall we ever be with the Lord. How
[2:27:20] many's in interested in that? 2
[2:27:22] Thessalonians 1 verse 7. And to you who
[2:27:26] are troubled, rest with us. When the
[2:27:29] Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven
[2:27:31] with his mighty angels,
[2:27:34] and a flaming fire, taking vengeance on
[2:27:37] them that know not God, and that obey
[2:27:41] not THE GOSPEL OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST,
[2:27:44] who shall be punished with everlasting
[2:27:47] destruction from the presence of the
[2:27:49] Lord, and from the glory of his power,
[2:27:53] when he shall come to be glorified
[2:27:56] in his saints, AND TO BE ADMIRED IN ALL
[2:28:00] THEM that believe because our testimony
[2:28:04] among you was believed in that day. How
[2:28:06] many love the word?
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; How many love the word? He's coming in
[2:28:11] the flaming fire. He's coming to take
[2:28:14] vengeance
[2:28:15] and all these politicians and all these
[2:28:18] foolish and fake believers and all the
[2:28:21] deception and the deceivers of the land.
[2:28:24] The Bible says he's coming again to take
[2:28:27] vengeance on all of that. All those that
[2:28:30] lied in his name, that spoke contrary,
[2:28:33] those that were uh absolutely against
[2:28:35] the cause of Christ, he's coming and
[2:28:38] he'll be glorified in his saints. This
[2:28:41] is the Christmas I'm looking for. This
[2:28:43] is not Santa Claus.
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; This is not jingle bells. This is joy
[2:28:49] bells.
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; This is the COMING OF THE LORD. THIS IS
[2:28:54] THE GREAT coming that is up the road for
[2:28:57] us. Christmas the the historical JESUS
[2:29:01] IS THE PAST. BUT WHAT IS THE FUTURE? The
[2:29:04] future is there is the coming of the
[2:29:06] Lord
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; AND EVERY EYE SHALL SEE HIM.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; SOME EYES DIDN'T SEE HIM BACK THERE. BUT
[2:29:14] EVERY EYE [screaming] SHALL SEE HIM
[2:29:16] COMING WITH GREAT VENGEANCE, COMING WITH
[2:29:18] FIRE, [screaming]
[2:29:19] COMING IN THE CLOUDS. THE SON OF MAN
[2:29:23] COMING in his glory, COMING IN HIS
[2:29:25] STRENGTH. THAT IS THE GREAT
[2:29:27] ANNOUNCEMENT.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE MERRY CHRISTMAS.
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE COMING OF THE LORD. THAT IS
[2:29:34] THE GIFT.
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; THAT IS WHAT MY HEART IS LOOKING TO THE
[2:29:39] COMING OF THE LORD.
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; THE greatest event to be. Revelations
[2:29:45] 1:7, "Behold, HE COMETH WITH CLOUDS, AND
[2:29:48] EVERY eye shall see him, and they also
[2:29:51] which pierced him, and all the kingdoms
[2:29:54] of the earth shall well because of him."
[2:29:57] And what did the writer say? Even so,
[2:30:00] amen.
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; Even so, amen.
[2:30:06] Praise this wonderful name. Can I read
[2:30:09] one more for you?
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; Revelations 19:11.
[2:30:13] And I saw heaven open, and behold, a
[2:30:16] white horse, and he that sat upon him
[2:30:18] was called faithful and true, and in
[2:30:22] righteousness he thus judge, AND MAKE
[2:30:25] WAR. HIS EYES WERE A FLAME OF FIRE. On
[2:30:29] his head were many crowns. He had a name
[2:30:32] written that no man knew but himself.
[2:30:35] AND HE WAS CLOTHED with a vesture. This
[2:30:38] is a mighty man here. DIPPED IN
[2:30:41] [screaming] BLOOD AND HIS NAME IS CALLED
[2:30:44] THE WORD OF GOD. And the armies WHICH
[2:30:47] WERE IN HEAVEN FOLLOWED HIM.
[2:30:51] &gt;&gt; Now brothers and sisters,
[2:30:54] this is the great feature to happen in
[2:30:58] THE FUTURE. THIS IS COMING.
[2:31:02] EVERY YEAR they have this new movie
[2:31:04] coming out, some Marvel movie or some
[2:31:06] sci-fi whatever or the great movie, the
[2:31:09] great WHAT THEY CALL BLOCKBUSTER.
[2:31:12] THIS IS THE BLOCKBUSTER.
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE GREATEST EVENT COMING UP.
[2:31:18] THIS IS THE VISION. THIS IS THE SCENE I
[2:31:21] WANT TO BE FOUND IN.
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; HERE HE IS. VEESTER DIPPED IN BLOOD,
[2:31:26] EYES OF [screaming] FIRE COMING IN THE
[2:31:29] CLOUDS. ALL THE HOST OF HEAVEN ARE
[2:31:32] FOLLOWING HIM. [screaming]
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS IT? THE COMING OF THE LORD.
[2:31:38] [applause and cheering]
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; But we're upset that we didn't get
[2:31:45] something from Santa Claus
[2:31:48] and we're caught up in the latest
[2:31:51] entertainment. Some people follow the
[2:31:55] chosen movie series more than they read
[2:31:58] their Bible.
[2:32:00] Yes, I'mma talk about it. You said,
[2:32:03] "Brother Israel, you're against the
[2:32:04] chosen." I'm not against the chosen, but
[2:32:07] if it's the chosen, should lead you to
[2:32:09] read your Bible
[2:32:11] &gt;&gt; and all those events.
[2:32:13] Some people go to the chosen before they
[2:32:15] come to church.
[2:32:18] You are the chosen. You was chosen to be
[2:32:21] at church on Wednesday night.
[2:32:25] NOT A MOVIE SCENE YOU CAN SIT DOWN WITH
[2:32:27] THE POPCORN AND WATCH.
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; NOT A MOVIE OF SERIES. IT'S TALKING
[2:32:31] ABOUT YOUR LIFE IS THE CHOSEN.
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; FORSAKE NOT THE ASSEMBLING OF YOURSELVES
[2:32:36] TOGETHER FOR SELF. THE WORD [screaming]
[2:32:39] says
[2:32:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:32:44] &gt;&gt; How many you know what the chosen is?
[2:32:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How many want if I
[2:32:48] played it here tonight, would you come
[2:32:50] back?
[2:32:55] Yes.
[2:32:57] The entertainment of it. Oh, the way
[2:32:58] it's put together, the script, the
[2:33:00] writers.
[2:33:01] Who are the writers? That's a good
[2:33:04] question. Go investigate that.
[2:33:08] Anyways,
[2:33:10] if it leads you to the Lord, go get it.
[2:33:12] Go with it. But if it ain't I if it
[2:33:15] ain't aligning with this if if this is
[2:33:18] boring and that's more exciting to you,
[2:33:20] there's a problem there.
[2:33:22] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:33:24] &gt;&gt; Because there's a carnal nature that we
[2:33:26] all have. And that carnal nature wants
[2:33:29] to be entertained.
[2:33:31] &gt;&gt; It wants the revelation without praying
[2:33:33] for it. It wants the answer without
[2:33:35] digging for it. HE WANTS ALL THE CREAM,
[2:33:38] ALL OF THE DESSERTS, without the
[2:33:40] vegetables,
[2:33:42] without all the nutrients that are dense
[2:33:45] material of the word that will save your
[2:33:49] soul.
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; It's easy to sit back and watch somebody
[2:33:54] lay out even a preacher preaching for
[2:33:57] you. The preacher is doing all the
[2:33:58] preaching. Oh, that's a beautiful quote.
[2:34:00] Oh, that's a wonderful sermon. Oh, we
[2:34:01] had a good time. What about your Bible,
[2:34:03] sis? What about your Bible, MY BROTHER?
[2:34:06] YOU HAVE to dig down and get these
[2:34:09] truths for yourself.
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; And when YOU THINKING ABOUT THIS COMING
[2:34:14] FEATURE, the newest feature COMING UP IS
[2:34:18] THE COMING OF THE LORD THAT'S IN THE
[2:34:20] FUTURE. I JUST READ SEVERAL SCRIPTURES
[2:34:22] TO YOU. HERE HE IS. EYES OF FIRE. THIS
[2:34:24] IS NOT A GAME. THIS IS NOT A COMEDY
[2:34:27] SHOW. EYES [screaming] OF FIRE. THE HOST
[2:34:31] OF HEAVEN WITH HIM. HE'S COMING TO BRING
[2:34:35] VENGEANCE on all those that were
[2:34:38] contrary to him. Amen.
[2:34:41] &gt;&gt; I'm going prepare my heart for that.
[2:34:43] Amen.
[2:34:45] Oh my.
[2:34:48] Verse.
[2:34:50] Can I read two more scriptures?
[2:34:51] Revelation 19:11. I didn't finish it. I
[2:34:54] saw heaven open. Behold, a white horse.
[2:34:56] He that sat upon him was called faithful
[2:34:58] and true. and righteousness he thus
[2:35:01] judge and make war.
[2:35:04] His eyes were as a flame of fire. On his
[2:35:08] head were many crowns, and he had a name
[2:35:11] written that no man knew but he himself.
[2:35:13] He was clothed with the vesture dipped
[2:35:15] in blood. HIS NAME IS CALLED the Word OF
[2:35:19] GOD. AND THE ARMIES WHICH WERE IN HEAVEN
[2:35:22] FOLLOWED HIM UPON WHITE HORSES clothed
[2:35:26] in fine linen, white and clean, AND OUT
[2:35:30] OF HIS MOUTH GOETH WHAT?
[2:35:32] A sharp SWORD THAT WITH IT HE SHOULD DO
[2:35:36] WHAT?
[2:35:38] &gt;&gt; Smite the nations. You don't hear THE
[2:35:40] TELEVISION PREACHERS PREACHING ON THESE
[2:35:42] SCRIPTURES. You don't hear the big
[2:35:45] crowds teaching on these words because
[2:35:48] it's not convenient for them. IT MAKES
[2:35:51] THEM FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.
[2:35:53] BUT TO THE BELIEVER, HE SAYS, "EVEN SO,
[2:35:56] [screaming] COME.
[2:35:58] &gt;&gt; COME, LORD JESUS.
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; EVEN SO, [screaming]
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; LET him that is filthy remain filthy.
[2:36:07] LET HIM THAT IS RIGHTEOUS BE RIGHTEOUS."
[2:36:09] [screaming]
[2:36:11] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE coming of the Lord.
[2:36:13] Out of his mouth goeth the sharp sword.
[2:36:16] &gt;&gt; With it he shall smite the nations. He
[2:36:18] shall rule them with the rod of iron. He
[2:36:21] treaded the wine press of the fierceness
[2:36:22] of the wrath of Almighty God. And he
[2:36:25] hath on his vesture and on his thigh a
[2:36:27] name written. What was it?
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; OH COME LET US ADORE HIM.
[2:36:35] &gt;&gt; EMMANUEL, [screaming]
[2:36:38] &gt;&gt; COME LET US ADORE HIM.
[2:36:41] MERRY CHRISTMAS,
[2:36:43] KING OF KINGS, [screaming]
[2:36:45] LORD OF LORDS.
[2:36:48] &gt;&gt; OR HIS NAME WRITTEN, [screaming] KING OF
[2:36:51] KINGS
[2:36:53] &gt;&gt; and Lord of Lords.
[2:36:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:37:01] &gt;&gt; King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[2:37:06] &gt;&gt; One more scripture in the Old Testament.
[2:37:08] Can I read it for you?
[2:37:12] Huh?
[2:37:17] Old Testament. All right.
[2:37:20] Zechariah 14.
[2:37:24] Oh, I have many more.
[2:37:27] [snorts] Somebody said, "Praise the
[2:37:28] Lord."
[2:37:30] Daniel 7:13 14. I'll close with this.
[2:37:33] All right.
[2:37:35] &gt;&gt; Keep going. Thank you.
[2:37:37] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:37:39] That's what I want for Christmas.
[2:37:41] &gt;&gt; That right there. Thank you. Keep going.
[2:37:45] Yes.
[2:37:47] I saw in the night visions, and behold,
[2:37:49] one like the son of man come with the
[2:37:52] clouds of heaven came to the ancient of
[2:37:56] days, and they brought him near before
[2:37:58] him. Oh my. [snorts] I wish I can preach
[2:38:02] this for y'all, but I don't know.
[2:38:05] Verse 14. And there was given him
[2:38:07] dominion and glory and [clears throat]
[2:38:10] the kingdom that all people and nations
[2:38:13] and language should serve him.
[2:38:15] &gt;&gt; His dominion is everlasting and dominion
[2:38:18] which shall not pass away. His kingdom
[2:38:20] that which that that which shall not be
[2:38:24] destroyed.
[2:38:27] Zechariah 14
[2:38:29] 3 and9. Then shall the Lord go forth and
[2:38:32] fight against those nations as when he
[2:38:35] fought in the day of battle, and his
[2:38:37] feet shall stand in the day that day
[2:38:39] upon the Mount of Olives, which is
[2:38:41] before Jerusalem on the east. And he
[2:38:43] shall flee to the valley of the
[2:38:45] mountains, and the LORD MY GOD SHALL
[2:38:47] COME AND ALL THE saints with thee. And
[2:38:50] it SHALL COME TO PASS IN THAT DAY THAT
[2:38:53] THE LIGHT SHALL NOT BE CLEAR
[2:38:56] NOR DARK, BUT IT SHALL BE ONE DAY WHICH
[2:38:59] shall be known to the Lord. And it shall
[2:39:03] be in the day that the living waters
[2:39:05] shall go out from Jerusalem, and the
[2:39:07] Lord shall be king over all the earth.
[2:39:09] And that day shall there be one Lord,
[2:39:12] and his name one. There shall be light
[2:39:19] &gt;&gt; in the evening time.
[2:39:21] &gt;&gt; The path to glory
[2:39:24] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL SURELY WE GOT A PICTURE OF THAT
[2:39:26] LIGHT. YOU know
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; in COMMEMORATION
[2:39:30] IN COMMEMORATION [screaming]
[2:39:34] OF THE GREATEST GIFT.
[2:39:40] [laughter]
[2:39:42] THAT LIGHT RIGHT THERE
[2:39:45] &gt;&gt; in commemoration of the greatest gift.
[2:39:48] So many hundred years THE STARS CROSS
[2:39:51] THEIR PATH AND THAT GIFT STRIKES THE
[2:39:54] EARTH AGAIN.
[2:39:56] &gt;&gt; AND THAT GIFT IS EMMANUEL
[2:40:01] &gt;&gt; BEING MADE [screaming] MANIFESTED
[2:40:04] &gt;&gt; TO HIS SAINTS. A GREAT LIGHT THAT SHINES
[2:40:08] IN [screaming] DARKNESS.
[2:40:11] GLORY.
[2:40:13] &gt;&gt; That day the son of man shall be
[2:40:15] revealed.
[2:40:17] Amen. You talk about Christmas. You talk
[2:40:20] about praising the Lord. We got
[2:40:22] something to praise him about.
[2:40:25] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:40:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:40:28] The great gift, the light has returned.
[2:40:31] What time is it, saints? Yes.
[2:40:34] All right.
[2:40:36] Let me close this message here.
[2:40:40] Just one service. Amen.
[2:40:43] &gt;&gt; Take my time. Take my time. You know,
[2:40:46] you look around when you say that. Look
[2:40:47] around. See what others look around.
[2:40:50] You'll see
[2:40:52] who sees. We'll see who's on board or
[2:40:54] not. Yeah. Just take a quick look. I see
[2:40:57] everybody's face. I see the I see the
[2:40:59] little eye roll. I see the little
[2:41:01] casual. I see I get your little signs.
[2:41:04] All right.
[2:41:06] And I will close just now. Now hear what
[2:41:08] the prophet says here. He says, "Now
[2:41:10] don't let this slip in the impersonation
[2:41:12] of Christianity." I'm going to close
[2:41:14] right here. Now notice paragraph 72,
[2:41:18] impersonation of Christianity. Now
[2:41:20] notice now in the bringing up of the
[2:41:22] church. Now of the church only consists
[2:41:26] if the body of Christ is only to be
[2:41:29] controlled by intellectuals,
[2:41:33] theology, mental conception, then we are
[2:41:36] wholly depending upon the intellectual
[2:41:39] knowledge of man.
[2:41:42] If I make that clear, if the church only
[2:41:45] rest upon the intellectual
[2:41:49] or how that a man could set the church
[2:41:51] and build big places and plush,
[2:41:54] excuse me, plush seats and the thousand
[2:41:57] pipe organ and how he could preach his
[2:41:59] message in such a way that would get the
[2:42:02] people into the church and join the
[2:42:04] church. And the more members on the
[2:42:07] book, the more the greater it is in
[2:42:09] heaven.
[2:42:11] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[2:42:12] &gt;&gt; You know, God doesn't count his group.
[2:42:17] He weighs it.
[2:42:19] &gt;&gt; It's not the numbers. It's the weight.
[2:42:23] &gt;&gt; It's the depth of the believer.
[2:42:26] &gt;&gt; It took one Abraham.
[2:42:30] One Abraham was worth
[2:42:33] a hundred Lots.
[2:42:35] Lot was a penny. Abraham was a dollar.
[2:42:39] And one Abraham with faith of ONE MAN
[2:42:43] CAN STOP THE DESTRUCTION OF THE CITY
[2:42:46] with his prayer interceding for a penny
[2:42:50] or two. SO THE MOST VALUABLE IS
[2:42:53] INTERCEDING FOR A LESS VALUABLE. BUT
[2:42:56] THAT'S WHAT GOD DOES.
[2:42:58] &gt;&gt; HE TAKES SOMETHING THAT IS NOTHING AND
[2:43:01] HE MAKES SOMETHING OUT OF IT.
[2:43:04] &gt;&gt; AND THAT IS REALLY [screaming] THE
[2:43:05] VALUE. GOD WEIGHS HIS CHURCH. HE WEIGHS
[2:43:09] THEM IN THIS WORD. HE WEIGHS THEM FOR
[2:43:12] THE QUALITY. HE WEIGHS THEM WITH THE
[2:43:15] REVELATION. HE WEIGHS THEM THROUGH TESTS
[2:43:18] AND TRIALS AND TRIBULATION.
[2:43:22] &gt;&gt; AND THEY'LL STAND THE TEST.
[2:43:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:43:26] ALL OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR'S CAMP, ALL OF THE
[2:43:30] FAKE BELIEVERS WERE BOWING DOWN, BUT
[2:43:33] THREE, THREE HEBREW BOYS STOOD IN
[2:43:36] [screaming] THE FIRE AS A BELIEVER. NO
[2:43:40] FELLOWSHIP, NO CHURCH MEMBERSHIP, BUT
[2:43:43] THEY STOOD. [screaming]
[2:43:45] &gt;&gt; WHY? THEY WERE TRUE BELIEVERS.
[2:43:49] GOD WEIGHS [screaming] HIS CROWD.
[2:43:53] &gt;&gt; They were real believers.
[2:43:55] Amen.
[2:43:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:58] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:44:00] paragraph 73. I close here. All right.
[2:44:05] More members on the book. The more
[2:44:07] greater is it is in heaven. Now, I want
[2:44:10] you to get this and never let it slip.
[2:44:16] If we only need the intellectual
[2:44:18] conception of man, we don't need the
[2:44:21] Holy Spirit.
[2:44:26] If the church is to be run and governed
[2:44:31] upon the intellect, the educational
[2:44:34] program, and upon the intellects of
[2:44:37] mankind, we don't need the Holy Spirit.
[2:44:41] If it's to be run by the Holy Spirit, we
[2:44:44] don't need the intellectual.
[2:44:47] &gt;&gt; It's either one or the other. Amen.
[2:44:51] &gt;&gt; Now, science has given us the intellect.
[2:44:56] Science has given us the iPhone and the
[2:44:58] internet.
[2:45:00] Science has given us the knowledge. But
[2:45:03] the Holy Spirit
[2:45:06] has given us his word by revelation.
[2:45:10] &gt;&gt; And this Holy Spirit is sent to run the
[2:45:15] church.
[2:45:16] &gt;&gt; It's either one or the other. And what
[2:45:18] what what what it has come down to a
[2:45:21] close musicians prepare to come. What is
[2:45:24] that? What it has come down to that the
[2:45:26] most intellectuals
[2:45:28] now want to argue with the church of the
[2:45:31] living God over spiritual things. And
[2:45:34] spiritual things are not made to be
[2:45:37] argued over.
[2:45:38] &gt;&gt; They're made to be said amen to.
[2:45:41] &gt;&gt; SPIRITUAL THINGS ARE WHAT YOU RECOGNIZE
[2:45:44] BY THE SPIRIT.
[2:45:46] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT AN ARGUMENT. IS NOT SOMETHING
[2:45:47] YOU WRITE OUT IN A PAPER. IT'S NOT
[2:45:49] SOMETHING YOU CAN POST ONLINE AND
[2:45:51] EVERYBODY AGREE WITH. YOU STAND UP ON
[2:45:54] THE REVELATION
[2:45:57] &gt;&gt; that God has given to you.
[2:46:00] &gt;&gt; And that's this entire Bible is
[2:46:02] supernatural. Your life is supernatural.
[2:46:05] This word is supernatural. It was never
[2:46:08] designed to be explained
[2:46:11] with the intellectual argument. There's
[2:46:14] intellectual people. There's smart
[2:46:15] people. Paul was smart. The Hebrew boys,
[2:46:18] they were smart men. God himself,
[2:46:21] nobody's smarter than God.
[2:46:23] &gt;&gt; But look at how he leads his church.
[2:46:26] It's either the intellectuals given by
[2:46:28] science, but what did God give us? He
[2:46:30] gave us the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[2:46:36] &gt;&gt; The gift of the Holy Ghost.
[2:46:39] What will that do for you? You young
[2:46:42] people,
[2:46:43] you're waiting to get married or looking
[2:46:46] to get married. Science has an app for
[2:46:49] that.
[2:46:53] Yes, it does. There's an app for you to
[2:46:56] find Mr. Wright or Mrs. Wright.
[2:47:01] You go on that app. You get your
[2:47:03] birthday. Oh, he says Sagittarius. Oh,
[2:47:05] he's a Gemini. Oh, really? What's his
[2:47:09] first name? What's his middle name? Oh,
[2:47:12] and you put all these uh h markers in
[2:47:14] there and you try to choose a husband or
[2:47:17] a wife based on this app. But then the
[2:47:20] Holy Ghost gives you a way to find a
[2:47:22] mate, too.
[2:47:23] &gt;&gt; And that starts on the rugged the old
[2:47:26] rugged way
[2:47:28] &gt;&gt; of falling down on your knees
[2:47:30] &gt;&gt; and waiting until the Lord gives you a
[2:47:33] revelation. How many know what I'm
[2:47:34] talking about?
[2:47:36] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS TO PROVIDE. IT'S MORE
[2:47:38] supernatural than anything. You talk
[2:47:40] about marrying from one culture to
[2:47:43] another culture. I've seen people marry
[2:47:45] from the same church, knowing each OTHER
[2:47:47] THEIR WHOLE LIVES, AND STILL THAT
[2:47:50] marriage fail. You've seen it, too. It's
[2:47:52] deeper than an intellectual matchmaking.
[2:47:55] It's diff It's MORE DEEPER THAN THIS ONE
[2:47:58] GETTING TOGETHER WITH THAT ONE BECAUSE
[2:47:59] THEY'RE FROM the same church or same
[2:48:01] city or THE SAME CULTURE. IT IS A
[2:48:04] SUPERNATURAL WORK
[2:48:06] &gt;&gt; THAT THE HOLY GHOST
[2:48:09] &gt;&gt; HAS GOT TO do that work for you.
[2:48:12] &gt;&gt; And apart from that,
[2:48:15] you'll be spinning your wills.
[2:48:20] &gt;&gt; But the intellectual,
[2:48:23] that's how Satan runs his church. But
[2:48:25] the church of the living God, the
[2:48:27] believers are ran by the Holy Spirit,
[2:48:32] which is a gift. That was a gift that
[2:48:36] the Lord Jesus gave to all of us. Aren't
[2:48:38] you glad about that?
[2:48:40] &gt;&gt; It's free. What can I do to get the
[2:48:42] gift?
[2:48:42] &gt;&gt; He gave it to you. It's freely given.
[2:48:44] &gt;&gt; It's a free gift. You receive it. You
[2:48:47] take that gift and watch it do wonders
[2:48:50] in your life. Then you become a gift to
[2:48:53] others. God bless you so much.
[2:48:55] Let us pray.
[2:48:58] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for your word this
[2:49:00] morning. We thank you for these precious
[2:49:03] fine folks, Lord, that have gathered
[2:49:05] here in your name. Lord, as we shared
[2:49:09] our heart to to the people here, what
[2:49:11] you put upon our heart, these words,
[2:49:14] Lord, of the great greatest gift ever
[2:49:18] given.
[2:49:20] It's your word, Lord. It's the Holy
[2:49:23] Spirit, oh God.
[2:49:25] You've given it to us in this hour.
[2:49:29] And I pray, oh Lord, that
[2:49:32] we recognize it's not by works. It's
[2:49:35] nothing that we can do,
[2:49:38] nothing that we can perform,
[2:49:40] nothing that we can pay or owe or repay.
[2:49:45] It is the sovereign gift of God,
[2:49:48] sovereignly given by the almighty God.
[2:49:53] Thank you, Father, for the Holy Spirit
[2:49:57] in our lives. Lord, we give you the
[2:50:00] praise.
[2:50:01] We give you the glory, give you the
[2:50:03] honor. And Lord, as we read of your soon
[2:50:06] coming,
[2:50:08] the son of man coming in glory
[2:50:12] with eyes of fire.
[2:50:15] Lord, a dream that brother Billy Paul
[2:50:18] had of his own daddy
[2:50:22] coming with eyes of fire, coming with
[2:50:25] judgment.
[2:50:27] And Lord, we know there's multiple
[2:50:30] meanings
[2:50:32] to these great prophecies, but looking
[2:50:35] at the clouds,
[2:50:37] looking at the host of heaven,
[2:50:40] looking at vengeance being taken,
[2:50:44] he that sat on the white horse
[2:50:48] name was called the word of God. Lord,
[2:50:51] that's the hour we're coming to. I pray
[2:50:54] you prepare our hearts for it. Dear
[2:50:56] father in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:51:01] Amen.
[2:51:03] Amen. Let us not be drunken with the day
[2:51:08] the day of the seventh age of Leodysia.
[2:51:12] Buying, selling, giving, taking. Let's
[2:51:17] not be consumed with that day, but let's
[2:51:19] consume ourselves with the day that is
[2:51:20] to come. The coming of the Lord. Amen.
[2:51:23] Somebody, why don't you look at your
[2:51:25] neighbor and say, "God bless you." The
[2:51:27] coming of the Lord. The coming of the
[2:51:30] Lord. That's what's coming. That's
[2:51:33] what's happening. That's what we're
[2:51:34] looking forward to is the coming of the
[2:51:36] Lord. Amen.
