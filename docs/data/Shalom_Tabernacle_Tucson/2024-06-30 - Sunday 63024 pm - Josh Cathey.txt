brother Israel said it's always good to come into the house of the Lord had a little message on my heart that I had I spoken at Mesa a few weeks ago I think maybe a month ago and um the last few days it just been on my heart again so I thought I would try and share that with you all um before I get too far I don't want to get in trouble I'm going tell everybody the title of my sermon because my wife every time I get home she's like you it was okay but you didn't tell nobody the title nobody knows what tell somebody the title next time so it's waiting on the victory just so I don't get berated and screamed at when I get home so while we're standing we'll turn to Hebrews chapter 10 thank you musicians Hebrews chapter 10 vers 31-38 Hebrews 10: 31-38 verse 31 says it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God but call to remembrance the former days in which after you were illuminated you endured a great fight of afflictions partly whilst you were made a gazing stock both by reproaches and afflictions and partly whilst you became Companions of them that were so used for ye had compassion on me and my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance listen to verse 35 and 36 cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of God ye might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tar now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we just ask that you would bless this service tonight Lord that you would walk amongst us Lord that you would watch over me you would watch over each one here Lord that you would anoint ears to hear that you would anoint my mouth this vessel just to move out of the way just to just so you can work here tonight Lord father we trust you and we thank you for the service this morning we just ask that you would be here amongst us in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may be seated so throughout the scripture you know we see great victories for the believer Old Testament New Testament you can see Victory after Victory but Victory as a Believer it is God's will but he he is Sovereign in his timing we know that our Victory is what he wants for us but his timing it's not the same as our timing it doesn't always happen when we want it doesn't happen in the best circumstances the best time it's not ever going to be the perfect time but he will come that's the promise you know there's times that we don't have to wait on Victory but sometimes we do there's times we do have to wait on Victory and that's all throughout the scripture you know a parent can tell a lot about a child's maturity by how they react when you tell them no or maybe when you tell them no not right now at this exact time you can tell how far along your child is in a lot of things when you just simply tell them no you can't have and it's not being mean to them but it's just seeing where they're at and that's what God does with us sometimes just to see where we're at he it it's the easiest thing in the world for him it's snap of a finger it could happen but he wants to see where you're at he wants to know what happens when he says no and you have to struggle a little bit when it has to get a little tight sometimes he wants to see where you are and I think this day that we live in and all the advancements and all the easy routes and all the you know everything's at the the touch of a finger every there's fast food there's everything is so convenient and it's made this an age of convenience and we can see it sometimes you know everything's convenient outside of the church and then sometimes we want convenience inside of the church but if you look through the scriptures convenience is not that's not something that Believers had in the scripture and I don't think God's going to change I don't think all of a sudden this day it's going to be convenient for everybody it's not all going to be smooth it's not going to be just an easy road to walk to be a believer because it never has been and it never will be but it's led to this also being an age of impatience nobody knows how to wait on anything anymore I mean in the fast food line if some if a car sits there too long ahead of you five minutes you're honking a horn things like that we and that as we said it spills into the church sometimes we had that same mindset coming into a service or maybe going down on our knees praying for something those carnal Tendencies can influence the spiritual Tendencies and they can start crossing over too much and when they do that we want everything at the tip of our fingers and luckily the Lord has done that we have the message all on our phones we have the scripture all on our phones but ju with the good comes bad too and it's got us comfortable it's got us a little little complacent with things like that we don't want to wait too long so there's a second scripture I'd like to go to it's judges 6 veres 7 through 27 judges 6 verses 7- 27 now a little background on this scripture Israel at this point they had been delivered into the hand of Midian for seven years and from the first day to the last day when they got out of the hand of Midian they W it out they they didn't enjoy it in there but they had to way upon the Lord they had to sit for a minute and they had to wait they cried and they cried but they had to wait verse 7 it says and it came to pass when the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord because of the midianites that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel which said unto them thus sayith the Lord God of Israel I brought you up from Egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and and out of the hand of all that oppressed you and drave them out from before you and gave you their land and I said unto you I am the Lord your God fear not the gods of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but ye have not obeyed my voice and there came an angel of the Lord and sat under an oak which was in ofra that pertained unto joash the abite and his son Gideon threshed Wheat by the wine press to hide it from the midianites now it's just like our enemy today he's going to try and take what is rightfully yours the ground that is rightfully yours Gideon here was threshing wheat at the wine press they did that at the threshing floor and that threshing floor by God's given Rights was Israel's but at this point it was in the hand of Midian they had taken it from him just as the enemy will and it goes on it says and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of Valor and Gideon said unto him oh my Lord if the Lord be with us why then is all this befallen us you know sometimes it's hard to see the purpose it's hard to see why the road behind you has been so rough it's hard to see why you've had to it was hard for Gideon to see why he had to be a part of this why he had to be captured by the midianites and then we ask the Lord why that may be one of the you know we probably don't say it outwardly but when we're down on our knees sometimes that might be the most asked question to the Lord is why why do I have to go through this why am I going through this because in the midst of the battle it's hard to see the end of the line it's not the easiest thing to see he says and where be all his miracles which are fathers told us of saying did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt but now the Lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the midianites so this this is a day that Gideon and is Israel alike had been waiting on for seven years now for the Lord to move on the scene for them and the very first thing that Gideon wants to do when the Lord shows up on the scene is questioned not an amen not a Hallelujah not a praise the Lord but he asks questions he said well why is it had not not he's not rejoicing but he's questioning God he's asking questions right here and the Lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the midianites have not I sent thee now who sent Gideon Israel didn't send him nobody else sent him but the Lord sent Gideon that's what was important here is that the Lord had sent him says and he said unto him oh my Lord wherewith shall I save Israel behold my family is poor in Manasseh look at his selft talk look at Gideon what he's saying my family's poor in manessa and I'm the least in my father's house what was Gideon looking at at this point Gideon was looking at maybe who he and Israel had been up to this point maybe who he was in that moment but the Lord was looking at who Gideon could be the Lord was looking a little bit farther down the line he can see farther than what we can he was seeing what Gideon could do could be a savior for Israel and today the same thing the enemy he will keep you looking behind yourself he'll keep you looking at every mistake you've made at the one you made earlier today at the one you made last week he'll keep you honed in on that and not what God's purpose is in your life he'll he'll just repeat it'll be like a slideshow he'll repeat it over and over in your mind so you'll never think that you're good enough to do anything that God has for you to do in this life he wants you to doubt your position as a believer in this day he wants you to doubt any calling that you may have in your life in this day you know if you're a singer he wants you to doubt whether you're worthy to get up here and sing whether you're good enough to get up here and sing if you're a preacher he does the same thing if you're just a person that says Amen on the Pew he's goingon to do the same thing should I really be saying amen after what I did a few weeks ago he's gonna do that over and over but we have to push forward we have to push through that we can't buy into that nonsense because that's all it is is nonsense because God says different it's not what the enemy says in this day we go on verse 16 it says and the the Lord said unto him surely I will be with thee and thou shalt Smite the midianites as one man and he said unto him if now I have found Grace in thy sight then show me a sign that thou talkest with me let's skip down to verse 20 here now verse 20 this is Gideon presenting his sacrifice says and the angel of God said unto him take the Flesh and the unle cakes and lay them Upon This Rock and pour out the broth and he did so and I thought that was interesting that Gideon's sacrifice is laid on the same rock that he had cried over the same rock that that he had been worried over it was on that wine press he had to lay that sacrifice over this this place of bondage in his life but the sacrifice cleansed that area the sacrifice was accepted by the Lord as is ours says then the angel of the Lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes and There Rose up fire out of the Rock and consumed the Flesh and the unleavened cakes then the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight now notice here just after Gideon had seen this happen now th this is a cry that they've been crying for seven years out to God and it is answered he has moved on the scene but his first emotion after this after he sees this happened is fear that's his very first emotion that happens because what did the enemy do he wanted to make him think he did something wrong he wanted to make him think that he had messed up right here you know when you have a victory in your life the enemy will always try and scare you back into submission into that submission that he had you in if you're healed of something in your body he's going to make whatever that is Fester up again because he wants it to make you doubt your healing or anything like that mental healing he wants to make you doubt that in your life and so he's going to put scarecrows up and try and get you back into that bondage try and get you to confess that same bondage you were already in goes on it says and when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the Lord Gideon said alas oh Lord God for because I have seen an angel of the Lord face to face and the Lord said unto him peace be unto thee fear not Thou shalt not die then Gideon built an altar there unto the Lord and called it Jehovah shalom unto this day it is yet an ofra of the absit and it came to pass listen to this know this is hard to believe and it came to pass the same night so you mean to tell me that Gideon didn't have any time to go get a Manny and a petty in between these tough times in his life he didn't have any time to sit down and do something relaxing no it was working it was time to move forward again there he he had been in a challenge and up to that challenge here's one smack dab right on the back side of it there was no rest because the enemy he's not going to take a day off God doesn't want you to take a day off he doesn't want you to take a Sunday night off a Sunday morning off a Wednesday evening off that's not what we do especially in this age when he's so cunning and he's so deceitful we can't afford to take time off in this day we cannot afford it it doesn't matter if there's there's a Red Sea standing in our way as we see in the scripture the prophet says here in the message God keeps his word it's in 57 he says now that's what it is coming to now my brother it's coming to a place that those who reject Christ he's becoming Darkness to them to those who accept it it's becoming light to them we are living in that day just before Crossing and did you notice how easy it was for the Creator God to send down a strong East Wind and just divide the Red Sea and take his children across said oh the Red Sea got scared and just walled itself up because God's path LED through the middle of it that's the way God does things it wouldn't have matter if God's path that he wanted them to go on it wouldn't have mattered where it was through the middle of a jungle through the middle of a sea through the middle of the entire ocean there would have been a way made no matter what says ' these people who was keeping his word walking in the light moving on following God's commands everything just opened up for them and if you want things to open up Take God at his word and start moving forward we might say today but how do I Take God at his word and move forward this reminds me some of the message this morning it's in s be of a good cheer it's in 54 says now if you get that man up there to say forward that man up there to say forward this man down here say forward you'll go forward if you can get God to say I'm the Lord that Health Thee the first Conscience Says I'm the Lord that Health thee and the subconscious says I am the Lord that Health thee you're going forward but when God says I'm the Lord that Health thee and the subconscious said or the conscious said I believe it's so and the subconscious said are you quite sure then you're not going in anywhere you're just run around in circles we have to agree within ourselves we have to know it's a truth from top to bottom inside out we got to believe it that it is the truth in this day he said you've got to get both all working together here here and there all in harmony then you can move forward there's nothing can stand in your way you're moving forward then as we go to verse 26 in the scripture says and built an altar unto the Lord thy God this was Gideon moving forward and what the Lord's commissioning him to do says and build an altar unto the Lord thy God upon the top of this rock in the ordered place and take the second bulock and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the Grove which Thou shalt cut down then Gideon took men of his servants and did as the Lord had said unto him and so it was because he feared his father's household and the men of the city that he could not do it by day that he did it by night so what a victory Gideon had just had with the Lord but he was still a little fearful to take the next steps but if the Lord spoken we can't be scared to walk through anything if he speaks to you personally if this word is Vindicated in you if you see it manifest if you know it's working in your life you cannot be scared to walk through you I'll rephrase that you shouldn't be scared to walk through anything to step in a fiery furnace where the Flames are so high step into it because he'll be there just as he was before he's the same yesterday today and forever he will still be there he'll still show up again he's still a miracle working God he can still move in your life he still heals cancer he still he heals diabetes he still does all these things we can't forget that today let's not forget it he hasn't forgotten us because you're on God's path now you you may not be able to see very far ahead on God's path but if you keep that light with you and you pray with that light with you it will illuminate that path it won't be guesswork you'll know where you're going you'll know where the Lord wants you to go but you have to keep that light with you that light in this day and it will illuminate that path in the message Victory Day in 63 the prophet says now remember when God has counted you worthy when you have a test said now don't fail this to get this when you have a trial or a test it shows the grace of God has found he says you found favor with God you found favor with God and God believes that you'll send the test you know if God believes that you'll stand the test who are you to doubt whether you'll stand the test if God thinks that about you that highly about you who are you to doubt that who are we sometimes let's not doubt his word let's not doubt the commission maybe he's put in your life the calling he's put in your that's put in your life you have to know you have to know that you know that the Lord is going before you you'll fall on your face flat on it if you do it through your power you'll fall on your face it'll be a failure but if he's in it if he goes before you if you learn the weight on him sometimes and you let him walk that path before you you let the light go forth you won't fall on your face you'll see every pothole in front of you and you walk around it you'll see every trap in the road and you'll avoid it or even if you do fall into it that light will be there for you he'll be there to help you through it we can turn to judges 6 ver 36-40 going on with gide in a bit more he just needed a little bit more here he had to know this judges 6: 36-4 it says and Gideon said unto God if thou wil save Israel by mine hand as thou has said behold I will put a fleece of wool in the floor and if the D be on the fleece only and it be dry upon all the Earth beside then shall I know then shall after all this then shall I know then shall I know that thou wil save Israel by mine hand as thou has said and it was so for he rose up early on the tomorrow and thrust the fleece together and ringed the Dew out of the fleece a bowl full of water and Gideon said on the God he knew he was stepping on some Dangerous Ground here he knew he was starting to to press it a little bit said and Gideon said unto God let not thine anger be hot against me and I will speak but this once let me prove I pray thee but this one once ain't that funny but this once we already we just asked and it just happened but this once but this once with the fleece let it now be dry only upon the fleece and upon all the ground let there be due and God how merciful of God and how he is to us that merciful that graceful we ask over and over we stumble and stumble sometimes and the mercy he shows us when you think when you meditate on that a little bit and maybe when you're down on your your knees praying and you really let that Mercy you internalize it and you let that Mercy sink in you can't hardly imagine it you can't realize what that's like as as a carnal human being sometimes says and God did so that night for it was dry upon the fleece only and there was due on all the ground so from this moment on though if you follow that scripture throughout Gideon wasn't asking any more questions he was in action it was time to move forward it was time to take back what was his but the Lord had to get get his character to where he could use him he had to get him to where he could do something with him he had to mature him some and that's just the same as he does with us today you know a sheep a sheep isn't born to sheep it's born a lamb and then it has the maturing process it's got a lot of characteristics about it it's got a lot of things that change before it becomes a sheep and the mo it's very interesting one of the main things that shows that a lamb has become a sheep is that they finally recognize and listen to The Shepherd's voice that's one of the last things where they can say that that's a full grown matured sheep that's a sheep that knows what to do I can let that sheep out and let it go fulfill its purpose somewhere and it's not just hearing the voice but it's recognizing and listening to what the voice of the shepherd says it's not one without the other you have to recognize who the shepherd is first and that sheep has to know that Shepherd and it has to listen to that voice in the scripture here even if Gideon hadn't got an answer though even if he hadn't got an answer at this point when he did get that answer it would have only made it that greater it would have only made the miracle of Israel being delivered out of the midianites hands that greater when it did happen you know Gideon which I can respect him for Gideon didn't want some manufactured miracle that he had done himself he didn't want to go work the guys up and get them together no he wanted to make sure that this was God moving in this day he wanted to make sure that God was going to go before him he wanted it all to be the Lord and I believe that the Lord had respect on his desire and his motive I believe that's why the Lord didn't get mad angry at Gideon when he asked over and over because he knew what his desire and what Gideon's motive was it wasn't to be flashy it wasn't to walk out and say Lord do another miracle here do another miracle here I want these people to think I'm something that wasn't Gideon he wanted to be sure that God was going before him and sometimes we can be guilty of kind of manufacturing our own fleece you know we can we can say oh Lord I I don't know if I should buy this thousand dog Lord I don't know if I should get this new truck this new car Lord I don't know if I should do this so Lord if you would when I walk into church today I want the Pew that I sit on to be more comfortable than it's ever been and so we'll walk into church we'll get back here to our Pew and we'll go to sit down and there could be a hundred needles sticking out of that and you sit down you say oh yeah that's comfy that's how we do it sometimes you manufacture that fleece it wasn't comfortable the Lord might answered you right there but no matter what your mind's made up on what you want your fleece to do but we have to be open to God's change open to God's way we have to wait on him in this day but I like that get in didn't want to take it into his own hands in the message the restoration of the brid tree in 62 he says the prophet says you don't have to knck down to the devil he said we've got a law That's the Law of the Holy Spirit the only thing you know have to do is know how to let go and let God and I know that's that's became like the live laugh love thing like that everybody puts in their house let go and let God that's became almost people just overuse it but in reality it's very true and if we take that to heart in our prayer closets when we're down on our knees when we can really let go and let God and realize what that means he said you keep fighting at it see and it won't never work when you let go and let God that's all see and a couple paragraphs down in the same message there it might be 108 yeah 108 and the same way it is with us it isn't what we fight and Pull and hurry and oh if I don't get this if I don't get that that's not it it's to know that the law of life is in you and you just let go and let God then he takes you to your healing you don't take yourself there he takes you to your healing he takes you to the baptism of the spirit or anything that he's promised any claim that he's given is yours and by letting go and letting God I believe that's what happened at that prayer meeting in the morning time letting go and letting God letting God move on the scene making God your number one choice not a medicine not a doctor but saying I I believe I'm gonna make the Lord My All In All today and every day I'm GNA take him at his word and I'm going to March forward no matter what the reports say and I'm going to get hands laid on me or I'm going to go by myself and I'm going to pray for it and I believe that the Lord will move on the scene for me but with Gideon God had spoken already it didn't matter at this point if Gideon had one man beside him if he had an army of a million men it didn't matter if he was by himself victory was his and he knew it the prophet said in a different place nothing will stop a man once he gets his answer from the Lord but what about before that answer comes how are we handling it are we listening for an answer are we making up our own answer are we manufacturing our own answer do we really want God's answer or are we so decided within ourselves of a way that we're going to go that it doesn't matter if he he could our answer could come on the front of a bus and it could hit us and we'd still ignore it are we that made up sometimes or is there room for him to move in our lives do we leave enough room for him today for him to do something for him to speak to us you know as a Believer I don't think there's any time in our lives where we're not waiting on the Lord for something if you think about that thought at all times it doesn't maybe the only thing you're maybe your life is great and the only thing you're waiting on is a body change you're still waiting on something you're still waiting on the Lord to move at all times we're waiting on him and we should be he wants us to he doesn't want us to take this whole life in our hands and try and let that's what we were doing before we met him he wants to lead the way he wants to be the light in another message remembering the Lord he says and then if we just sit still and let him answer us back said many things and one of the horrible things that I do I try to do all the talking and not sit still long enough for him to answer me back you know one of the most obnoxious things that another person can do is come to you for advice or just wanting you to help them with something and then they talk the whole time and never give you any room to help them they come to you with question after question and they're they're talking the whole time and they never I almost said shut up well I guess I did just say it but they never stop talking long enough for you to get a word in and that's how we are with the Lord sometime it's coming to the Lord this this this this and this and he never gets a word in God's Not A yes man that's not how he's going to work in your life he's going to be honest with you he's going to tell you the truth and he's going to tell you what's wrong as he goes on he said we do that so many times in prayer I think if we would get off of our hearts what's in it and express oursel to the Lord Jesus and then just kneel and just be still a while and just see what he would say back to us see now that sounds simple but how many's doing that how many's really having a quiet time right there at the end you you pour your heart out to him and then wait on an answer not you pour your heart out then hop up and you go do the next thing whatever you were actually thinking about during the prayer because that's where we get sometimes too you sit there and you act like you're praying to God God knows your heart he knows all of our hearts and I'm only saying I'm saying thank things I've done too you sit there and you pray but really you're thinking about that next meal really you're thinking about these other things in life but no we have to get consecrated we have to get quiet before and then we got to stay quiet long enough for him to speak back to us for him to tell us something the prophet says here and sometimes I've did that and my whole opinion was changed he did that and his whole opinion was changed let's turn to another scripture real quick if we can it is 2 Samuel 5: 17- 24 2 Samuel 5: 17- 24 now here's David and how he's had to or having to once again wait on Victory now in this scripture David he had just had some great victories in his life he' finally been made King over Israel and had also taken back Jerusalem some things he had waited for waited on for a very long time we start here with verse 17 but when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David King over Israel all the Philistines came up to seek David when the enemy sees a blessing in your life when he sees the Lord starting to move in your life he's coming so don't doubt that don't think it's going to be a road of ease he's coming after he sees that you know like in in war if there's a side that's approaching a stronghold some something that will win them the entire War the enemy is going to fire everything they can at them right there because they know if they get there it's over it's done with they've won it it's victory for them he goes on and he says and David heard of it and went down to the hold the Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of reim and David inquired of the Lord saying shall I go up to the Philistines wilt thou deliver them into mine hand and the lord said unto David go up for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand now that's one of those victories you don't have to wait on that's one of those you send up a prayer and it's answered immediately it's one of those there's no waiting on that and David came to B pism and David smoted them there and said the Lord hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me as the breach of waters therefore he called the name of that place B pism and there they left their images and David and his men burned them and the Philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in the valley of reim look at that the enemy came up and spread themselves in the same exact Valley that they had just been in before isn't that how healing happens you have the problem the thing you need healed of you get healed and then the enemy comes back to that same exact spot he tries to hit you there again just to make you think that he might win this time time let's go on here he says and when David inquired of the Lord he said Thou shalt not go up but fetch a compass behind them and come upon them over against the mulberry trees now David knew he had just beat them in this exact Valley why would the Lord say no this time the first time was so simple it was so easy there was no waiting on the Lord why would the Lord say no this time why would he have to wait this time what did the Lord know that David didn't know well probably a lot but I imagine David wondered that to himself you know I've won this headon why do I have to lay and wait especially why do I have to do such a bizarre thing when I know I can take them head on why do I have to go around behind them and maybe laying some leaves and wait by some mberry trees that doesn't make any sense to me it reminds me sometimes you get stuck in traffic and you're sitting in that traffic maybe for five minutes and you're mad that you're stuck in traffic you're upset with it but then you get a little bit up the road and there's a crash that could have been you the Lord orchestrates those things I don't believe anything things by chance I believe he always watches his children he always watches over us but David was very used to Victory but Victory isn't always where the Lord teaches people it's the time leading up to the victory you know the true test it's not ever what we're actually going through but it's how we handle what we're going through you know the Lord let he he might let Satan afflict you in some way but he wants to see what you're going to do with it he wants to see how you're going to handle it but to us in our carnal Minds the test is the the hurting in our body or the pain in our minds the things that we're going through outwardly but the Lord wants to see what you're going to do with it he wants to see how you're going to react to it he wants some sons and daughters with some Backbone in this day that's not going to cower down that's not going to be handed a box of rattlesnakes and accept it no kick that box of rattlesnakes you don't got to take that thing that's no part yours don't sign for that don't sign for any of it and we would see Jesus in 59 the prophet says now sometimes when we meet the requirement we think about well it's why didn't he answer God does sometime that way Upon Our action to see what our reaction will be see sometimes look at the shunamite woman for instance see he wanted to see what her reaction would be and he does that many times just to see how we'll react but if if we're certain that we have met God's requirements just stay right with it and we have to be honest with ourselves if we've met his requirements or not we can't we can't go into it halfway not having met the requirements and expect something you got to be honest with yourself first meet those requirements and then move forward in the promise of God for this day just move forward in it says but if we're certain that we have met God's requirements just stay right with it he's got to act said you hear it he's got to act if we if he made the promise he's God and has kept that promise he's God he just can't take it back and say well I was mistaken God makes no mistakes when he said he could heal you when he said he could save you when he said he could redeem you none of that was mistakes that was all the perfect all right and another spot in an absolute in 63 says how David that great patriarch how we'd like to speak about him said we haven't time but and many times as we heard someone speaking a few moments ago about David and his sin but when all of it was forgiven when he was going to battle and we call it in the world the chips were down and the opposition was great and David laid under the tree and sweated it out I believe sometimes that's God's plan sometime for us we have to sweat it out you got to lay under that mulberry tree not knowing what's going to happen but believing what's going to happen by but what the word tells us and you have to lay there and you have to sweat it out sometimes he goes on he said until he heard the sound going through the mulberry bushes then it was different David Rose and went on because that he had an absolute that he knew that was God going on before him you know as David laid sweating it out there's a spot where the Prophet says that he could feel the enemy all around him that he might have been laying in some leaves or some bushes and that he could feel the enemy walking all around him now how unnerving would that be isn't that what we feel when we walk out here you can feel and you can see the enemy all around you you flip on if you got a TV and you flip it on he's there he's all around you if you look on your phone he's there he's all around you the enemy is constant he's everywhere we have to stay so Vigilant and then that's when all the Whata ifs start David's laying there he's had his promise given to him he's laying in these leaves these enemies are walking all around him it's a lot of pressure and he's laying there and these what if start you know what if the Lord doesn't come what if he doesn't show up or maybe today what if I claim my healing then still have symptoms what if I claim my healing in front of somebody and the next time they see me I'm still sick what if I try and confess my healing at work in front of my co-workers and then I come in next week and I'm still sick we worry about those things but that's God's business you don't worry about that you're not going to heal you so don't don't worry about it you confess that healing and step forward boldly yeah boldly not not not half-witted boldly with God's promise and see what happens see if it don't turn into a testimony next week see if that person don't come up and look at you and say they are healed maybe what they're talking about is the truth but as long as we're scared like that that testimony is never going to come forth it's never going to happen if you're too scared to take God at his word and wait on something a little bit May maybe another one what if I wait on the Lord and the situation only gets worse maybe not healing of the body but any situation that we deal with in everyday life what if you wait on the Lord for it you know you've been praying and it only gets worse maybe that's what David thought maybe thought because David he had won battles up to this point it probably crossed his mind well if I just jump up right now and surprise attack him I'll win this but that wasn't God's route it wasn't his route David might have thought that he might have been wor worried that they were going to look down see one of his men and then they were ambushed but that wasn't God's route that wasn't God's path David probably prayed and prayed while laying there wanting more guidance wanting to know more about the situation but it probably went silent because the Lord wanted to see David make the sacrifice of waiting on him he wanted to see if David would try and take it into his own hands or if he would wait on him I don't I don't know if David the scripture doesn't mention I don't know if David was a patient man but I this looks like a patience test to David to me to see if he would try and move out and from my own experience when you pray for patience or when the Lord is putting you through a test that's going to mold patience into you it's uncomfortable there there is no other way for it to be but uncomfortable I had a guy I worked with in Tennessee and he was his name was Terry km and he was talking to me one time about the scripture and he said my wife gets mad at me every time I pray for patience said I I come home and she's so mad at me because he would he would pray for patience and then the things that would have to mold the patience in his life would be happening to him and then he would be angry about it he'd be mad all the time at home and his wife would be like Terry you got to quit praying for patience this ain't good for our marriage just be unpatient don't pray for patience no more we don't need it that much but I I thought that was funny but as we're about to read we see David stayed faithful to the word of the Lord and faithfulness to the word and patience they go hand in hand you know you can look at how in this quote I found this other day and it I thought it was amazing in the exposition of the church ages you can look at how the Saints of the Dark Ages some of the toughest times to be a believer some stuff that we probably couldn't even imagine happening to them people just out landish things in the tharan age and he commended them for their faithful faithfulness and then their patience he says here I know your faith now he does not say here as he did to the church in pergamus y you hold my faith he is not talking about his faith now but he is commending them for their faithfulness and as he does he also mentions their patience how faithfulness and patience go together in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness for it says in James 1:3 the trying of your faith worketh patience there is absolutely no other way in which to gain patience listen to that there is absolutely no other way in which to gain patience it has to come by the trial of your faith says Romans 5:3 tribulation worketh patience how highly God regards this outworking of our patience is seen in James 1:4 but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire lacking nothing God's will for us is perfection and that Perfection is patience waiting on God and waiting for God this is the process of character development now character that's that's what you're doing when nobody's looking that's what you're looking when you ain't got nobody body around to impress when the pastor ain't looking directly at you when your friend ain't looking right at you character development happens when you're all alone not all of it but a whole lot of it happens when it's just you and the Lord in a place and he's going to watch you he might put you he might allow something to come on you right there and he's going to see if that character has developed or not in you he's going to keep working it and working it and trying to mold it in you until he sees something come forth says how highly God has commended these Saints of the Dark Ages patient as Lambs led to the slaughter lovingly Faithfully i' have Lov to meet some of them people they served they Faithfully they served God that is all they wanted out of life just service to their lord how great was to be their reward you know how they worked for the Lord even when the trials came in the scripture when it's talking about this age it says the last to be more than the first talking about their service toward the lord talking about what they did for the Lord what they tried to do so in the Dark Age it only got darker as it went on and as it got darker all they did was work that much more for the Lord what else did they have to do what else were they going to do as it got harder as the squeeze got tighter all they did was work more for the Lord all they did was be more faithful be more patient in the Lord because they knew that there was a reward greater than anything they could get here greater than any popularity anything they could get here so we continue on in the scripture with David says and let it be when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees that then Thou shalt bester thyself for then shall the Lord go out before thee to Smite the host of the Philistines when I was reading this scripture I just imagined that that sound going going through those mberry trees was a Russian Mighty Wind I imagine it probably sounded a whole lot like that when David was laying there and he looked over at those mulberry trees and he heard that Mighty Wind come through there and he said it's time to go now the promise of the Lord has been fulfilled we've waited we've done what God told us to do and now it's time to move the same wind as the day of Pentecost it's the same type of Promise given to David as the ones waiting in the upper room the same that type of promise it did he didn't give no time frame on when this would happen for David he didn't give any time frame to those 120 in the upper room but he said wait until wait until this happens and when it happens you'll know it and when it happens the promise will be fulfilled will you turn to one more place in the scripture very familiar spot Matthew 14 verses 22-33 Matthew 14 verses 22-33 now this scripture keep in mind this is after a great miracle and a great Victory the disciples had just been a part of Jesus had just fed 5,000 plus women and children and they had seen that happen what what a miracle something that had probably never been done the likes of that had probably never been done before for nothing close to that and they had just seen the Lord move in this Mighty way verse 22 says and straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitudes away so we see here what we can see by this verse we can see that by Jesus's order he put them in that boat he put them in this boat and he knew where that boat was headed he knew the storm that it was headed towards verse 23 says and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with the waves for the wind was contrary you know in Mark 6 when it's telling it in mark it says that from the mountain Jesus saw them toiling and now saw them toiling I I don't I don't know if it means Jesus saw them physically toiling I don't beli so but Jesus knew what they were going through he didn't have to be there to know what they were going through you know we find earlier in the Book of Matthew in chapter 8 where the Tempest arose in the sea they had been through this before they had seen this happen chapter eight in Matthew we're here in chapter 14 in Matthew that Tempest in the sea came up but Jesus was on the boat them so they had it as the disciples were seeing it right now for them Jesus is far off he's Out Of Reach he's out of touch what are we going to do because before we could go and we could shake him we could wake him up we could get him to move for us we could physically wake him up but here in this scripture they know Jesus is on land they know Jesus isn't there presently and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea now the Fourth Watch that's the last watch of the night that's 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. that's right before morning comes that's right before the sun Rises and so it goes forward it says in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and it makes me wonder if they had question how this same Jesus that had just fed 5,000 that they saw do this great miracle how did this same Jesus put me in a boat and send me into a storm I just saw him work this great miracle and you're telling me that man put me into this boat and push me towards a storm did he know this was going to happen and that Third Watch it must have been pretty tough that Third Watch the one right before the fourth that must have been pretty tough to go through you had to have some Faith to stick it out that long you had to be a real disciple of Christ to stick it out that long to wait on the Lord to believe that he's going to move on the scene and sometimes the Lord he waits in our lives until the Fourth Watch before he moves he'll wait he wants to see what you're going to do in the first the second he wants to watch you toil all night long and see what you're going to do he wants to see that reaction the prophet says in separation from unbelief sometimes it's just when the darkest time comes along in your life God gives you a little trial to see if you really do believe it when he really makes the thing known to you another spot the resurrection of Lazarus he says may be your darkest hour don't worry Jesus will be along it may be your darkest hour sister may be your sister may be yours brother but don't worry Jesus will come along he's always there just in the darkest of hours we pick up verse 26 right there says and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear they had a hard time recognizing their Victory come forth they had a hard time recognizing the Lord moving in their lives right then says but straight away Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer here it is I Be not Afraid and Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship and he walked on the water to go to Jesus but when he saw the wind bous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying Lord save me so they he had waited on the Lord through every watch it was a miracle in itself that the that boat had held together till the watch he had waited through every watch on the Lord and just think the Lord lets him come out and lets him take a few steps on that water but just the same as today Peter started looking around he started looking at what was still wrong and all that did to his faith was drive it down all that did to his doubt was drive it up he started looking around we don't have to look at anything but what this scripture says we don't have to look at anything but what this word says about about us about our lives about the healing in our body about the healing in our mind about a calling about a purpose we don't have to look to anyone else's opinion but God's opinion says and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou of little faith wherefore D thou doubt and when they were coming to the ship the wind ceased then they that were in the ship came and worshiped him saying oh the truth Thou Art the son of God and as musicians come i' just like to read another quote and this one I I was listening and I ran across it about a month ago I I never noticed it before but it it's really blessed me it's really helped with a lot of thing you know helped with patience helped with understanding why we have to go through what we go through why do we have to do it and this this quote really fills that out it's the it's exposition of the seven Church ages the sman church age it says in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering and according to Paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection why did he want this James 1 veres 2-4 my brethren count it all joy when you fall into into diverse Temptations knowing this at the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work don't interrupt patience working in your life it's going to get hard it's going to get tight but let it have its perfect work in your life that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing why does he stand by it says the reason is in Romans 8: 17-8 and if children then Hees heirs of God and Joint HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to rain your patience has to be tested to rain you have to wait on the Lord a little bit to rain if you want Power you got to wait on the Lord sometimes if you want him to move in your life the requirement is you wait on him sometimes he goes on he says you have to suffer to rain the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift think about that character is a victory not a gift that character and molding that character into you it's not just going to be dropped down one day it's going to be a life full of Trials a life full of test a life full of you being pushed to the absolute Max and not breaking and waiting on the Lord to move says a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and is sat down in his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation said think it not strange concerning the fiery trials that are to try you that is what Peter said is it strange that God wants us to develop to develop a Christlike character that comes through suffering no sir and we all have trials we are all tried and chastened as Sons not one but goes through that listen to what it says about the church this is something that we can all maybe rally around maybe all when we feel like we're being attacked as a church we feel like maybe it's hard to find a building something like that listen to what he says right here the church that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of God the church that is not suffering is not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of God Amen that quote it just makes it a little bit easier to walk this walk it makes it a little bit easier to push forward a little bit easier to keep moving forward when the times get tough let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we just love you you tonight father we just ask that you would you would mold patience into us that you would develop our character to be closer to yours Lord no matter what we have to go through no matter what that will take Lord we trust in you that you'll be there to lead us that

refilling of your Holy Ghost Lord that you would help them move forward that you would give them bravery that you would give them courage when the enem is moving against them and that they can stand
