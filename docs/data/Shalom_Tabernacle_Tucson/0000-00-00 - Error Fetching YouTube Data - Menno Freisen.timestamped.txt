[31:06] seen it all transformed.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; Kind of nice kind of like a good
[31:11] conversion, [clears throat]
[31:15] &gt;&gt; you know, to know where to start
[31:17] sometimes, but just stay around the
[31:19] shepherd, the master builder. He knows
[31:21] how to build and after a while it's
[31:23] starting to take on a structure
[31:25] &gt;&gt; and then it begins to be comfortable.
[31:27] Then it begins to be a place to indwell
[31:29] and now that we thank now that's what
[31:31] buildings are for us. We're not looking
[31:33] at the building. We thank the Lord for
[31:35] those but volcanic ash
[31:39] &gt;&gt; as the prophet said anything you look at
[31:42] it's volcanic ash waiting to turn back
[31:44] to its original state again where
[31:46] there'll be no sin there'll be no
[31:48] tomorrow. let me know yesterday and we
[31:50] labor for that. That's what we press for
[31:52] and I'm I'm glad here to join by faith
[31:54] with you as is always our hope that um
[31:59] it we don't plan to change the whole
[32:01] church just maybe add a little bit here
[32:03] or maybe take away a little bit there
[32:06] rightly dividing the word of truth
[32:09] &gt;&gt; and after all that's a whole effort that
[32:11] we might rightly divide this blessed
[32:14] message which we believe is the last
[32:16] sounding message of redemption to the
[32:18] gentile dispensation
[32:20] &gt;&gt; and to the world, both Jews and
[32:23] Gentiles, gets a opportunity now to
[32:26] close up the finality of what God called
[32:29] the book of redemption.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; I'm glad my name was written there.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; I feel like John, I said, I'm so glad
[32:36] when you saw it that his name was
[32:38] written there. That means that you never
[32:41] had a beginning, [clears throat] no end
[32:43] to it. You're here for temporary. Excuse
[32:46] me. It'll clear off after a while.
[32:50] And good to see you, John. Good to see
[32:51] you. Chissy, it's good to see you. And
[32:53] you brought mom along today. Well,
[32:57] her and Irene had three-hour coffee
[32:59] break this morning or something like
[33:00] that.
[33:02] And they were budding in who's to take
[33:04] the lead.
[33:07] You ought to see them when they get
[33:08] together. They they've got so many
[33:11] grandchildren to talk about. It's
[33:12] amazing.
[33:14] And after all, they are our greatest
[33:15] joy. You know, when you see the
[33:16] grandchild, I was talking telling
[33:18] brother Israel here that I I saw him
[33:20] here the other night and with his wife
[33:22] playing the piano and the children
[33:24] sitting playing and I said, you know,
[33:26] there's a rich man sitting there.
[33:30] If we go in with your family, you're a
[33:33] rich person.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; You know, everyone has one objective as
[33:38] a parent. When we when when the Lord
[33:41] delivers us from unbelief and sin, then
[33:44] all your life you aim from that time on
[33:46] to see that you in influence those
[33:49] around you and above all your own
[33:52] family, which is the hardest thing for
[33:54] one human to lead another human to the
[33:56] Lord because there's always so much
[33:58] humanity there. Can you imagine? We
[34:00] always say, "Oh, if I would just be
[34:02] where Jesus was, everything would be
[34:03] fine." many mighty works she could not
[34:06] do
[34:08] because of unbelief. Could you believe
[34:10] that? That God could not do things with
[34:12] the people, but if they believed or not,
[34:14] he could do nothing for them. And the
[34:17] only the only sin that brother Brown
[34:20] says that God cannot help is unbelief.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; If you do not believe him, there's
[34:26] nothing he can do for you. With all the
[34:28] power reserved, he said, "Well, I don't
[34:31] believe that. I don't then it would do
[34:32] you no good." And a pardon is not a
[34:35] pardon. It's received as a pardon.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; And this message is the same way. It's a
[34:39] pardon of God. It is not another
[34:41] message. It's this living Bible. It's
[34:43] this Bible living.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; We don't believe the message is separate
[34:47] from the Bible. It is the revelation of
[34:50] the word of God. It is not added to it
[34:53] or taking away. It is a confirmation of
[34:56] what he prophesied, what he said and
[34:58] would do in the last day. And we can say
[35:00] this honestly from the heart and from
[35:03] the word of God and by vindication that
[35:05] all that God promised the angel to do,
[35:08] he did.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; I don't believe it was I believe it was
[35:11] finished when he took him off the earth.
[35:13] Uh he simply said there's a now the work
[35:15] wasn't finished. The pillar of fire
[35:16] still here
[35:19] because there's a bride still here yet.
[35:20] He said when it goes, she goes and I do
[35:24] believe we're so close. Of course, we've
[35:26] been that for the last 60 years.
[35:28] I believe that when brother Ram was
[35:30] still here when I heard him preach in
[35:32] marriage and divorce series I I we I
[35:35] thought I wouldn't get home
[35:37] [clears throat] seemed like the rapture
[35:38] was so near and how many of you were
[35:41] here around in 1977 were you around
[35:43] walking in the light boy everybody had
[35:45] one foot in the air you know hardly
[35:48] settled down to said it's going to
[35:50] happen it's going to happen
[35:51] [clears throat] it didn't happen like we
[35:53] thought
[35:54] &gt;&gt; but I didn't see any place in the
[35:56] message where to change it.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; He just had to change our thinking to
[36:01] his word. And it takes line upon line
[36:04] here a little, there a little. You
[36:06] notice how you read and how you listen
[36:08] sometimes all of a sudden you say, "Oh,
[36:09] I didn't see that before." Why? It's in
[36:12] the same place where I've read over so
[36:13] many times
[36:14] &gt;&gt; and a message. But in that day and their
[36:18] eyes came open and I thank the Lord. And
[36:20] one of the greatest things of all things
[36:22] is to have your your eyes open to the
[36:25] reality of the age that we live in. I
[36:28] was just making you don't mind if I just
[36:31] uh
[36:32] well I just calm myself down a little
[36:34] bit. I was I was looking at some
[36:35] pictures where in the place we're
[36:37] staying and [clears throat] there was um
[36:40] a picture of brother Carl Williams and
[36:42] his son Earl and I don't know the other
[36:44] brother had he had another son, didn't
[36:45] he?
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Anybody know?
[36:47] &gt;&gt; David. All right. I said it must be the
[36:49] other son. I don't know if I ever met
[36:50] him, but [clears throat]
[36:52] uh and it been in 1970,
[36:58] we were in Phoenix and brother Perry
[37:00] Green had invited the believers to come
[37:01] and sing and he was going to take the
[37:04] meetings there in the Ramada in and it
[37:08] was in 19
[37:10] 64
[37:12] when brother Bam had the special
[37:13] meetings there in the Ramada that my my
[37:16] mother and dad went. My mother had heart
[37:17] trouble and she she said if in she said
[37:20] within her heart if I could get in the
[37:22] prayer line I believe the Lord would
[37:24] heal me. Her mother died at 54 years old
[37:27] and so she was always troubled that
[37:29] maybe she would be an early death and uh
[37:33] when she when she got there she got on
[37:36] the prayer line [clears throat] and
[37:38] walked through the prayer line. When she
[37:39] came up to brother Brandham he simply
[37:41] says heart trouble kills people but it
[37:43] doesn't have to kill you.
[37:46] She lived to be 90 years old. And when
[37:49] she did, the doctor said, uh, we about
[37:52] three, four days, she just laid there,
[37:53] wouldn't open her eyes and take any
[37:55] food, nothing. I said, doctor, what's
[37:56] the matter? I said, her heart's too
[37:58] strong.
[37:59] It won't quit.
[38:02] Well, I did. I wasn't happy, but I said,
[38:04] I'm glad.
[38:07] No one likes to see your loved ones go.
[38:08] You like to hang on to them as long as
[38:10] possible. But when we were there in the
[38:12] in the uh [clears throat] Ramada and
[38:15] brother Carl Williams was there and uh
[38:18] he invited us to his home afterwards and
[38:21] um of course we felt greatly honored
[38:23] because of his we'd heard brother Bam
[38:26] talk about him and he'd give us his
[38:28] testimony and I I I was thinking of when
[38:30] I looked at the the picture you know him
[38:33] being a well digger and u he said uh and
[38:37] if you ever anybody ever see his hands
[38:39] how they were all crippled some of you
[38:41] old people and u he said when brother
[38:44] Brown preached the MI in meetings he
[38:47] told the congregation [clears throat] I
[38:49] guarantee absolutely that there won't be
[38:52] one sick person one crippled one if
[38:55] you'll believe right now before you walk
[38:58] out of this building you'll receive what
[38:59] you have before you get through that
[39:01] building you God will God will you will
[39:03] receive it if you can believe it
[39:06] &gt;&gt; and brother Carl said he went out to the
[39:09] door looked at us hands like this,
[39:11] looking at his hands. When he went out
[39:12] of the door and he looked at his hands,
[39:13] stopped a little bit, they didn't
[39:15] change. He started walking. He said, "I
[39:18] started crying and I walked towards my
[39:21] car gradually, slowly crying because my
[39:24] hands were not changing." He said,
[39:25] "Lord, I guess I I guess I didn't have
[39:27] faith enough." He said, "When I got to
[39:30] the door of my car, I stood there for a
[39:31] minute looking at my hands and I felt
[39:34] somebody put his hand on my shoulder."
[39:37] He said, "It was Brother Brandon." He
[39:39] said, 'Brother Carl, what's the matter?
[39:42] He said, 'Look at these.'
[39:44] He said, ' Carl,
[39:46] God knows best.
[39:50] He said, he knows what you would do. He
[39:52] said, do you remember Paul when he cried
[39:55] the Lord for his eyes?
[39:57] And Paul and the Lord said to Paul, "My
[40:00] grace is sufficient. In fact, I'm made
[40:02] perfect in the weakness."
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:05] He said, "Don't ask me again, for my
[40:08] grace is sufficient." He said, "And
[40:11] brother Bram said,"Brother Carl, God
[40:13] knows best. You probably would have went
[40:15] back to well drilling,
[40:17] but he said, "He's got you there
[40:21] to keep the doors open under the full
[40:22] gospel businessman for my ministry." He
[40:25] said, "That's the reason why God didn't
[40:27] touch you. He touched you." Said, "Don't
[40:29] ask him again." He said, "I never asked
[40:32] him again."
[40:34] He was that way when we when last we saw
[40:36] him. It just reminded me of the never
[40:39] failing reality of God. God is a great
[40:41] God. But [clears throat] he doesn't
[40:43] always he does not always do what we
[40:46] think he should be doing.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; There are many things that we might ask
[40:50] and might not get. But but I I tell you
[40:53] what, [clears throat]
[40:54] if you weigh it out,
[40:58] the Bible does say that all things do
[41:00] work together.
[41:03] doesn't say that they're they're always
[41:05] right.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; But [clears throat] I like the scripture
[41:08] who said, "But I know you're poverty."
[41:11] &gt;&gt; God is not not mocked. I like a little
[41:15] scripture. I mean, I want to take a
[41:16] little quote and I just picked this up
[41:18] in the same house and I I'd read it many
[41:19] times, but I appreciate some of the
[41:21] things that the prophet said that gives
[41:23] us so much strength along the way. And
[41:24] if I encouraged you along the way,
[41:26] that'd be good for me cuz uh I'm 83
[41:29] years old and I'd like to be encouraged
[41:30] every day myself
[41:32] &gt;&gt; that I might still live when the rapture
[41:34] takes place. I'd kind of like to bypass
[41:36] death.
[41:38] To be honest,
[41:41] &gt;&gt; I I think there's every one of you, no
[41:43] matter how old you are, you say, "Oh, if
[41:45] I could just wait to see my body take on
[41:48] different all look and said, honey."
[41:50] Like Abram and Sarah said, "Your skin's
[41:53] getting all why your hair is turning."
[41:59] And I like this part here. He said, "You
[42:01] know, cloudy skies and storms of life
[42:02] are no sign of God's disapproval."
[42:07] Usually we think when things go wrong,
[42:08] something wrong. Doesn't have to be.
[42:11] Neither are bright skies and still
[42:13] waters signs of his love and approval.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; His approval of any of us is only in the
[42:22] beloved.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; His love is elective which he had for us
[42:27] before the foundation of the world. Does
[42:30] he love us? Ah yes. But how shall we
[42:33] know? We shall know because he said so.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; And I like to settle that in your heart.
[42:40] Take God at his word because he said so.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; I know you do.
[42:46] We shall know because he said so and
[42:48] manifested that he did love us. For he
[42:52] brought us to himself and gave us his
[42:54] spirit placing us as sons.
[42:59] [snorts]
[42:59] &gt;&gt; There's a richest people here tonight.
[43:01] The sons and the daughters of God. Amen.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; And how shall we prove my love to him?
[43:06] By believing that what he said and by
[43:09] conducting myself with joy in the midst
[43:12] of trials that he in his wisdom allows
[43:15] to come to pass.
[43:17] And I know thy poverty,
[43:20] but thou art rich.
[43:22] There it is again. See him walking up
[43:25] and down in the midst of the church like
[43:27] a father. He is looking upon his family
[43:30] and he is head of the household. He is
[43:33] the provider. He is the protector. Yet
[43:35] he looks on his own poverty, their own
[43:39] poverty. Oh, how the untutored believer
[43:41] stumbles at this.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; How can God bear to look at upon his own
[43:47] in a time of need and just stop it all
[43:50] and just not stop it all and just give
[43:52] in and lavish everything material upon
[43:54] them? Here's where you have to believe
[43:57] again in his love.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; We could go on. I don't want to read
[44:02] spend all time on that's not my thought.
[44:04] But I I was encouraged when I read that
[44:05] today. I thought, "Oh, thank you, Lord.
[44:08] [clears throat] How marvelous, how
[44:10] wonderful." I want to read a scripture
[44:12] if I could first Corinthians and uh
[44:19] the first chapter.
[44:22] And I know that that all scripture is
[44:26] given for reproof, rebuke, exhortation,
[44:31] and there's nothing written but what is
[44:33] for the edification of the body. I did
[44:35] appreciate that, brother, brother
[44:38] Israel, when you're preaching on the
[44:39] gifts in the body. They are given there
[44:42] for the edification,
[44:44] for the uplifting and building up. and
[44:47] everything we do in in the in the
[44:49] Christian walk.
[44:51] That ought to always be our motive,
[44:53] Lord, to build up one another in the
[44:55] most holy faith. If you would stand with
[44:58] me, I'd like to read 1 Corinthians 1 and
[45:00] 18-31 just for
[45:03] [cough] if I [clears throat] miss it,
[45:05] this won't miss it.
[45:08] Pardon me.
[45:13] [clears throat]
[45:15] For the preaching of the cross is to
[45:18] them that perish foolishness. But unto
[45:21] us which are saved, it is the power of
[45:24] God.
[45:26] For it is written, I will destroy the
[45:29] wisdom of the wise, and will bring to
[45:31] nothing the understanding of the
[45:34] prudent. Where is the wise? Where is the
[45:36] scribe? Where is the disputer of the
[45:39] word of the world? Disputers of this
[45:42] world. Hath not God made foolish the
[45:44] wisdom of this world? For after that in
[45:48] wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew
[45:51] not God. It pleased God by the
[45:54] foolishness of preaching to save them
[45:56] that believe.
[45:58] Do you ever stop to really think why are
[46:01] we the the smartest of all and we need
[46:03] constant encouragement
[46:05] constant preaching
[46:08] conscient for and an animal he's happy
[46:11] with the way he's born never tries to
[46:13] alter never likes to improve he's just
[46:15] happy the way he is every feather is the
[46:17] same as the other feather was last year
[46:18] and the same thing and the same and they
[46:19] and they're happy
[46:21] &gt;&gt; but we
[46:23] need somebody constant just press on
[46:25] keep moving on Right? And we're in the
[46:28] mind of God.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; And we are we are one who can choose.
[46:34] The animal cannot choose. But it shows
[46:37] that we're fallen people.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; We're longing to get back to the place.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; No matter how much you're saved here
[46:44] today, yet your body cries out, "I too
[46:46] want to be delivered."
[46:48] Your soul already rejoices, but your
[46:49] body we we must we want to get back to
[46:52] the place where God made us in the
[46:56] beginning before the fall. It'll never
[46:58] go away. That's the reason why we're
[47:00] always improving.
[47:01] You know what? You get 10 years. This
[47:03] Billy said, "You know what?
[47:05] &gt;&gt; We got to change something."
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Isn't that the way with your house?
[47:11] [clears throat]
[47:12] Never. Oh, if we if we renovate again,
[47:15] I'll change that.
[47:20] Let me read a little further.
[47:25] But after the wisdom of God, the world
[47:27] by wisdom knew not God. It pleased God
[47:30] by the foolishness of preaching to save
[47:32] them that believe. For the Jews require
[47:35] a sign, and the Greeks seek after
[47:36] wisdom. But we preach Christ crucified.
[47:40] Unto the Jews a stumbling block, and
[47:42] unto the Greeks foolishness. But unto
[47:45] them which are called, both Jews and
[47:48] Greeks, Christ the power of God and the
[47:50] wisdom of God, because the foolishness
[47:53] of God is wiser than men, and the
[47:55] weakness of God is stronger than men.
[47:58] For you see your calling, brethren, how
[48:01] that not many wise men after the flesh.
[48:03] Not many mighty,
[48:06] not many noble are called.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; But God has chosen the foolish things of
[48:10] this world to confound the wise. And God
[48:13] has chosen the weak things of the world
[48:16] to confound the things which are mighty.
[48:21] And base things of the world, and things
[48:23] which are despised, hath God chosen.
[48:25] Yay. And things which are not, to bring
[48:28] to not things that are,
[48:32] the invisible
[48:34] correcting the visible. Now no flesh
[48:37] flesh should [clears throat] glory in
[48:40] his presence, but of him are
[48:43] of him are ye in Christ Jesus. Who of
[48:46] God is made unto us wisdom and
[48:48] righteousness and sanctification and
[48:50] redemption that according as it is
[48:53] written, he that glorithth, let him
[48:55] glory in the Lord. May God bless his
[48:58] reading of his word. Your you may be
[49:00] seated.
[49:03] I'd like to add one scripture to that if
[49:06] I could and just uh trail along in this
[49:09] thought a little bit.
[49:12] There's [clears throat] something every
[49:13] once in a while, Brother Brand will say
[49:15] things and you'll you go into the
[49:17] scripture and they strike you as I as I
[49:20] often say that every time I get a little
[49:23] bit maybe melancholing, I think, well, I
[49:25] I'm not doing so good. I I like to turn
[49:27] to Romans 8.
[49:30] There's therefore now no condemnation of
[49:31] them which are in Christ Jesus. What I
[49:33] feel like you know you feel like brother
[49:35] B said if I get if I want to really get
[49:37] settled he said I get over there and uh
[49:39] thank you. [clears throat] Uh it's
[49:42] partly heritage
[49:47] 83 years of singing and talking too loud
[49:51] and and uh
[49:54] preachers have bad throat. I I heard
[49:56] brother Ram said the other day he kind
[49:57] of laughed. He said uh somebody
[49:59] [clears throat] somebody said uh about
[50:01] his hor his throat was real bad and he
[50:03] said uh uh somebody said something that
[50:05] I I think it was because of preaching he
[50:07] said and he kind of chuckled and said
[50:08] made me feel good
[50:10] that you should suffer a little bit.
[50:13] We do suffer because it's not easy just
[50:16] uh especially if you like to sing. You
[50:18] should sing on note if you're going to
[50:19] sing at all but but it doesn't always
[50:21] work.
[50:23] And [clears throat]
[50:25] but John said this here just changing
[50:27] our thoughts a little here. He that
[50:29] heareth my word I love to quote this
[50:31] same John 5:24. He that heareth my word
[50:34] and believeth on him that hath sent me
[50:37] hath everlasting eternal life. Zoe and
[50:40] shall not come into condemnation but is
[50:42] passed from death into life
[50:46] &gt;&gt; or he that believeth. I like what
[50:48] brother Ram said now when he's praying
[50:49] for the sick now said if you He's
[50:51] getting ready to pray for the sick and
[50:52] he said now you people here if you'll
[50:54] you realize that that the scripture he
[50:56] went to the dialogue and he read where
[50:58] it says and if you believe with all your
[51:00] heart what you prayed for that it is
[51:02] coming to pass.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Not it will come to pass but that it is
[51:07] coming to pass. Amen.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; He said, "You must believe it that way
[51:11] that the moment you ask, it is coming to
[51:13] pass.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; You might not see a stone move. You
[51:16] might not see anything happen, but it's
[51:18] already working because he knows before
[51:20] you want to ask if it's according to his
[51:22] word." And and in there little the
[51:25] message of questions and answers, uh,
[51:27] pardon me, discernment of the body.
[51:30] There's something that really uh blessed
[51:31] my heart and I I always strive to look
[51:34] at that said our eternal destination
[51:38] is not altogether determined by what we
[51:40] see and what we hear.
[51:44] Our eternal destination is not
[51:46] altogether determined by what we see and
[51:48] what we hear but it's determined on what
[51:52] discernment
[51:53] we have of what we see and what we hear.
[51:58] I' just let that sink in a little bit
[52:00] because faith comes by hearing the word
[52:03] and and that's where we rest at when we
[52:06] hear it. But unless the revelator
[52:08] reveals it to you
[52:10] &gt;&gt; for the entire body of Jesus Christ is
[52:12] built upon the revelation of Jesus
[52:14] Christ to you personally. You know
[52:16] that's the new birth
[52:17] &gt;&gt; is the revelation of Jesus Christ to you
[52:19] personally. That you are in the book of
[52:21] life, lamb's book of life before the
[52:23] foundation of the world. That you've
[52:25] always been a part of God. Amen.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; That's the reason we don't believe in
[52:31] eternal sunship.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; It's a temporary body we have here. But
[52:35] this body has a beginning has an end.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; But the one that it replaces when it not
[52:39] replaces but what changes it that he
[52:43] didn't say bodies replace it. Said when
[52:44] you come no matter what you went into
[52:46] the ground what nothing but nothing
[52:48] spoonful of ashes. Said when you come
[52:49] back it'll be a body immortal
[52:52] &gt;&gt; just like your soul is now. And in but
[52:56] in this it just it just blessed me when
[52:58] I read that that our eternal destination
[53:02] is not all together determined by what
[53:04] we see or what we hear but is determined
[53:07] on what discernment we have
[53:11] of what we see and what we hear.
[53:15] We [clears throat] are understanding
[53:16] that many times the things that we that
[53:20] we so desire to cannot be explained.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; And uh sometimes I I have a little sense
[53:26] of humor. We were going to Ohio, Irene
[53:29] and I. And I love driving, but I'm
[53:32] getting older. The roads are getting
[53:33] longer. I know that. But uh I don't like
[53:36] flying cuz uh with my my rather
[53:39] oversized body, the seats are just a
[53:41] little bit too narrow usually. Now, if
[53:43] they had them like that, it'd be nice.
[53:44] But but they're making the plane smaller
[53:47] rather than bigger. I can see that. But
[53:50] we were driving one day and I said, "How
[53:52] do you know I I like to my wife likes to
[53:56] she she was sleeping a little bit, but I
[53:58] so I talked to her because I was sleepy,
[53:59] too." And I said, "You know, let's talk
[54:01] a little bit." So So I said, "You know,
[54:04] we're strange people." I said, "Just
[54:05] think now. We've been driving three
[54:07] solid days.
[54:09] and we go to sleep at night and driving
[54:11] street going going east going east. I
[54:15] said, "How come we don't get to the edge
[54:16] where a car starts leaning this way and
[54:18] or I go over the edge or how come we're
[54:20] always up?"
[54:23] Yeah, you know, you I'm I'm joking. But
[54:27] how would I explain that now?
[54:31] How's it How's it that the people
[54:32] beneath us now way down there, you know,
[54:34] we say, "How can the Chinese are
[54:36] sleeping today now and uh they're all
[54:38] hanging upside down?
[54:43] Can you explain things?
[54:47] I can't explain it. How's this coming?
[54:50] No matter where you go, you're always
[54:51] up.
[54:54] I saw something the other day. He said,
[54:55] "Well, going left or right?" He said,
[54:57] "Go left." He said, "Because the women
[54:58] are always right."
[55:01] I saw that in your Walmart store.
[55:04] But I find out doesn't matter. You're
[55:06] still going the same way. But but try to
[55:08] explain, you know, the dynamics, you
[55:10] know, we we can sometimes explain the
[55:12] mechanics.
[55:14] But you know what? How do you explain
[55:15] the mechanics of the Holy Ghost coming
[55:18] into your life and saving a ranked
[55:20] sinner? Why were you a sinner to begin
[55:21] with? Because he ordained it that way.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; That he might be a savior, that he might
[55:25] be a deliverer, that he might be a a
[55:27] leader, a guide, a shepherd, as we just
[55:29] read, or I am the the the God of the
[55:32] household. And he allows things all of
[55:35] this so [clears throat] it can be
[55:37] expressed.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; But how could you how could you can
[55:40] explain the solar system?
[55:43] &gt;&gt; How do you explain it? You can do
[55:46] anything you want, but you can't make
[55:47] one thing make sense except God created
[55:50] it.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; How do you explain anything? How do you
[55:56] explain emotions and feelings and and uh
[55:58] somebody sits down and plays a song and
[56:00] says, "Oh, that's beautiful." Uh well,
[56:04] yeah. Next one. Oh, isn't that
[56:06] wonderful? It depends on what notes it
[56:09] strikes in your heart.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; A song sometimes make you cry, the next
[56:13] time it makes you laugh, next time you
[56:14] want to dance, next time you want to run
[56:16] or just, oh, look at that. Look at the
[56:19] emotions. How do you explain that?
[56:22] &gt;&gt; How do we explain God?
[56:25] I know we men especially in this age
[56:27] know everybody wants to know exactly we
[56:30] after all we have Google so we can we
[56:32] can find how it's made and where it's
[56:34] made and how you know where we got all
[56:36] the answers
[56:38] &gt;&gt; but faith doesn't need all the answers
[56:41] &gt;&gt; it just needs to believe
[56:44] &gt;&gt; just take God at his word you know and
[56:46] the the solar system itself it's
[56:48] impossible well the further they're
[56:51] going now with scopes and and they're
[56:53] going on and on and on. They said
[56:54] they're waking up. Said it's
[56:55] unbelievable. Said there's new galaxies
[56:57] arriving everywhere.
[57:02] Who do how do we explain it? That's what
[57:05] brother Brandham talked about. He said
[57:06] the mechanics and the dynamics.
[57:09] We we we we don't know sometimes the
[57:12] mechanics, but we know it when the
[57:13] dynamics hits us. I don't know how a man
[57:17] can find peace with God, but I know what
[57:18] it struck me.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; I began to rejoice. I began to realize
[57:22] my sins were gone. There was something
[57:24] happened to me. I said, "Oh." I said, "I
[57:26] know this. I I might not be, you know,
[57:28] what I want to be or what I ought to be,
[57:29] but this thing I do know I'm not what I
[57:31] used to be." Something began to change.
[57:33] And I begin to realize it took away the
[57:35] desire of sin to disbelieve the word of
[57:37] God. Took away the things of the Lord.
[57:39] Begin to make you look at something say,
[57:41] "Oh, Kabot. Oh, look at it." What once
[57:44] it was attracted, you find out that that
[57:46] what sin that what the Holy Ghost does
[57:48] when he comes in, he takes and changes
[57:50] it. that you say, "Oh, you shouldn't go
[57:52] there." No, should do. I know where to
[57:54] go. And when I get out of place, I also
[57:56] know that.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; You ever been in a place where you say,
[57:59] "What am I doing here?"
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Might have be might be the mall. Might
[58:03] be somewhere else. All of a sudden, I I
[58:06] I we we were we don't shop that much,
[58:08] but a little bit. And uh I was walking
[58:11] into the store one time looking for my
[58:13] wife. And I knew it was a lady's
[58:16] clothing store.
[58:18] But I walked in and I was in about
[58:19] quarters away. That's how I start
[58:20] feeling. So I got all nervous like I
[58:23] uptight and I and the music I said,
[58:26] "Man, there must be something horrible
[58:27] in that music. I don't know its lyrics.
[58:29] I don't know what it's playing." Said,
[58:30] "But that this makes me so nervous." I
[58:32] looked a little while. I said, "Well,
[58:34] she'll have to come out uh eventually,
[58:38] so I'll just stay out." But it's
[58:40] spirits.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; You don't understand the the mechanics
[58:44] of it,
[58:45] &gt;&gt; but you know the dynamics of it. And
[58:47] it's the same with the walking with this
[58:49] message. Look, I I can't explain a lot
[58:51] of things that the prophet said
[58:52] sometimes and and even in the scripture.
[58:54] Could everybody say here that if you
[58:55] read your Bible, you see Jesus Christ in
[58:57] every verse that you read?
[59:01] &gt;&gt; No. No, I can't. But I do know this that
[59:05] the prophet said all the Old Testament
[59:07] was a shadow and it was Jesus, the
[59:09] figure of Jesus that was cast into the
[59:11] shadow. And finally when it come up he
[59:14] said the shadow merged into the image
[59:16] itself and the old and the new it met in
[59:19] the middle
[59:20] &gt;&gt; and then the new be to reflect what all
[59:23] those prophets had said and done was
[59:25] reflected there stood the image of the
[59:27] ones that they' prophesied. Look at
[59:29] beyond the curtain of time. Brother Bam
[59:30] goes over there and he said when all
[59:32] those prophets they cried and they begin
[59:34] to identify the image they saw in their
[59:37] day
[59:39] &gt;&gt; and begin to cry out and said oh there's
[59:41] a wheel in the middle of the wheel
[59:42] remember you know the prophet talked
[59:43] about and how he goes into lets us know
[59:45] that that he appeared in different forms
[59:48] different mechanics
[59:50] &gt;&gt; but the dynamics was the same that's the
[59:52] reason why you never have to change the
[59:54] word of God if there's anything in the
[59:56] you come to the Bible and here comes a
[59:58] prophet in this day
[1:00:01] And he's even saying things at times.
[1:00:03] Now hear me right.
[1:00:06] Why those seven thunders or seven seals
[1:00:08] are not even written in the book.
[1:00:11] Well, I'm saying amen. Amen. That's they
[1:00:13] must be there somewhere. He gets to
[1:00:16] about the third seal and says I was
[1:00:17] wrong.
[1:00:19] said they were written there because it
[1:00:20] says at the last chapter there said if
[1:00:22] you add or take away one verse or add
[1:00:24] one to place said they were there all
[1:00:27] the time but our eyes were withheld
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; with the mechanics were there but the
[1:00:31] dynamics had not reached us yet to
[1:00:34] quicken that work and make it alive but
[1:00:36] look at when the prophet come along and
[1:00:37] took the scriptures and went to the old
[1:00:38] testament took Abraham Jeremiah all the
[1:00:41] prophets and brought him their portion
[1:00:42] and brought them into Jesus Christ and
[1:00:44] so on there stood that's the one they
[1:00:46] were all looking for Amen.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; The same yesterday, today, and forever,
[1:00:52] the unchanging. I know this is this is
[1:00:54] simple but
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; even in the fallen creatures
[1:00:59] [clears throat]
[1:01:00] he said this
[1:01:03] even the fallen creatures
[1:01:07] if it's all wrapped up in time
[1:01:10] he said this the botney life solar life
[1:01:12] the lowest the highest the creature of a
[1:01:15] man even to the earth
[1:01:19] fully obeys its creator tour.
[1:01:23] And it's interesting, you know, here we
[1:01:25] are with all of that. The whole
[1:01:28] creation,
[1:01:30] you say, "Oh, the devil's been giving me
[1:01:32] so much trouble. The devil's doing this.
[1:01:33] The devil's doing that." He's only doing
[1:01:35] what God allows him to do. Do you know
[1:01:37] he's got a limit?
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Said, "Touch not my anointed. Do my
[1:01:42] prophets no harm." Oh, you killed the
[1:01:44] prophet's own. That doesn't mean it
[1:01:46] touch not my anointed. Don't ever touch
[1:01:49] that anointing of that redeemed soul.
[1:01:52] The oil in the wine, don't touch it.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; It doesn't belong. That's not yours.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Satan's got a limit. Do you know how
[1:02:01] many times uh somebody was telling me
[1:02:03] the other day and I thought, no, in
[1:02:04] fact, I heard this heard brother Bam the
[1:02:06] message really struck me. You've heard
[1:02:08] brother Bam talk about the woman that
[1:02:10] was a saint way back in 1950. He said
[1:02:12] this in 1950. He said, "Now that was
[1:02:14] before I had the discernment ministry,
[1:02:16] and I and I I I took the people by the
[1:02:20] hand, and if it if it would get all red
[1:02:22] and run stripes run over to you, I knew
[1:02:23] whether it was a terminal cancer or a
[1:02:25] disease." And you you have all heard him
[1:02:27] talk about that. Well, anyhow, this
[1:02:29] little story struck me again when he
[1:02:31] tells about the the man that said his
[1:02:33] wife was insane and she was in the
[1:02:34] institute and they brought her to this
[1:02:35] house and she was in the basement. You
[1:02:37] I'll just say enough so that you'll know
[1:02:39] what what what it was about. And the man
[1:02:43] come and asked brother Bram to come pray
[1:02:44] for him because he believed. And there
[1:02:47] was some doctors involved and some
[1:02:49] friends and so on. But they brought her
[1:02:50] there to this this room and and uh
[1:02:53] Brother Bram said, "I walked down and
[1:02:55] the husband said, "Oh, don't go down
[1:02:56] there. She she she's dangerous." Well,
[1:02:59] he he says, "Well," he said, "I'm a son
[1:03:02] of God." He said, "I'm I'm a servant of
[1:03:05] God." He said, "I went down not not
[1:03:08] arrogantly, but he trusted God." He
[1:03:11] said, "And I thought I'd reached out and
[1:03:12] take her hand and find out what what was
[1:03:15] wrong with her when I reached her hand."
[1:03:17] He said, "As soon as I grabbed her, she
[1:03:18] jerked me." And he said, "I put up my
[1:03:21] knee and caught her and hit her in the
[1:03:22] chest and bounced off." And he said, "I
[1:03:24] got free." And he said, "And I ran up
[1:03:26] there real quickly up the stairs real
[1:03:27] quickly." Said, and said, "See, I told
[1:03:30] you he's dangerous."
[1:03:34] And then the voice, she cries out said,
[1:03:35] "William Brandon,
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; I have nothing to do with you. You have
[1:03:41] nothing to do with me."
[1:03:43] And the husband says, "She doesn't know
[1:03:45] her own name. She doesn't know my name.
[1:03:47] How does she know your name?" He said,
[1:03:48] "That's not
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; the woman. That's not your wife.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; That's Satan."
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now
[1:03:55] I challenge him."
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Said, "Satan, come out of him in the
[1:03:59] name of Jesus Christ."
[1:04:01] said, "She laid still, didn't move."
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "I waited a few moments. I
[1:04:05] said, "Take her back to the
[1:04:06] institution."
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; He already saw the vision.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Take her back to the institution.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "In three days, she'll be at
[1:04:18] home."
[1:04:20] They took her and bound carried her cut
[1:04:23] up the way she was, took her back to the
[1:04:25] institution and uh
[1:04:29] with with the next morning when they
[1:04:31] came to the to her cell to where she was
[1:04:34] at to get her dressed for for for
[1:04:38] breakfast, she was already dressed
[1:04:41] sitting there in her right mind
[1:04:43] beginning to hum gospel songs.
[1:04:48] Oh my.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; He said and a few months later he said I
[1:04:54] no he said about I think it was half a
[1:04:55] year later I was in a certain city in a
[1:04:56] meeting he said and in walked this the
[1:04:58] families and they were there and said
[1:04:59] this one woman woman started waving at
[1:05:01] me started waving at me. I thought my
[1:05:03] goodness. Okay. Yeah. You know he said
[1:05:05] and she was just laugh smiling and just
[1:05:06] waving. So finally her husband
[1:05:09] kind of quietened her down and then
[1:05:10] brother said I stopped and said yes
[1:05:12] ma'am do you do you want to say
[1:05:14] something? He said you don't recognize
[1:05:15] me? said, "No." He said, "You're the one
[1:05:18] that you prayed for. I'm the one that
[1:05:20] you prayed for." And she was sitting
[1:05:21] there. She said, he said, "Dressed well,
[1:05:24] five children, all dressed neatly,
[1:05:27] combed hair, and her husband sitting
[1:05:29] there, one beautiful family,
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; just one touch of the invisible God,
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; proving that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:05:42] yesterday." That's the whole ministry of
[1:05:44] the message was to turn our hearts back
[1:05:46] to the living reality of Jesus Christ
[1:05:49] that he never changes. He's the same
[1:05:51] tonight in every which way. He He cannot
[1:05:54] change. If he could change,
[1:05:57] [clears throat] he wouldn't be God.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; It's impossible
[1:06:06] because
[1:06:08] his thoughts in the beginning were
[1:06:09] perfect. That's right.
[1:06:12] But there's only one way and we realize
[1:06:15] even science is figuring this out now
[1:06:18] today. There's so many places that you
[1:06:20] get and you realize it's getting so
[1:06:22] tight
[1:06:25] in your in your identification line of
[1:06:27] identifications. How how we realize that
[1:06:31] anything that Satan has has been copied.
[1:06:35] You ever think of that Satan hasn't got
[1:06:36] an original idea?
[1:06:39] He's got to take God's word and twist
[1:06:41] it.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; He doesn't have to twist it much.
[1:06:45] Just one word
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; as all he ever just caught. What Eve did
[1:06:49] is just just just heard him too long.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; She should have walked away. Said, "Get
[1:06:54] it behind me, Satan."
[1:06:56] I tell you as a Christian that's good
[1:06:58] behoo that's good message for all of us
[1:07:00] when Satan comes to you with something
[1:07:02] said and you know what there's no
[1:07:04] household but where the washing of the
[1:07:07] water of the word isn't necessary all
[1:07:09] the time
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; your pastor will appreciate you if you
[1:07:13] stay washed in the water of the word
[1:07:14] keep washing washing washing walk with
[1:07:17] God he'll appreciate you'll appreciate
[1:07:19] one another and and you know you don't
[1:07:21] all have to go to this church to be in
[1:07:22] Christ I I'm I'm glad I'm I'm Brother,
[1:07:25] I'm so glad you got it. This church is
[1:07:26] in Tucson.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Not just one.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; You know, there's room. Room. Yes,
[1:07:34] there's room.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; You don't have to see all like I see it.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Or [clears throat] like your pastor or
[1:07:40] and all you want to do is look through
[1:07:42] the eyes of Jesus Christ.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Just watch. And and one of the things
[1:07:46] that's that's so beautiful in life is
[1:07:47] that you know things don't always
[1:07:50] develop right away
[1:07:52] but prove all things and then you hold
[1:07:53] on to that which is good.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you say oh that there's that
[1:07:57] person. Oh, you ought to watch that.
[1:07:58] Maybe you but see whether that spirit is
[1:08:00] right or not. Then you watch it then
[1:08:03] watch your own spirit. That's a good
[1:08:05] one.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; That's a good one to do. Always watch
[1:08:08] your own spirit no matter what happens.
[1:08:10] And you can't and I I know this is quite
[1:08:12] a mouthful. Brother Bam says that it's
[1:08:14] quite a mouthful. He said, "If you can't
[1:08:17] bitterly disagree,
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; that's right."
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; I mean, bitterly disagree. Not even just
[1:08:22] slightly. Well, he looked at me wrong.
[1:08:24] No, didn't even say anything. Well,
[1:08:26] yeah.
[1:08:28] No,
[1:08:30] bitterly disagree.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; I don't think I've ever got to that
[1:08:34] place with my wife that I bitterly
[1:08:35] disagreed. I got a few things but
[1:08:40] but she had way more to disagree with.
[1:08:42] But what is a union?
[1:08:46] That we are made different for a purpose
[1:08:48] and a reason. And that's the reason why
[1:08:50] God has you here undoubtedly. See, he
[1:08:54] knows what what food you need and what
[1:08:57] what have and when he lays it on your
[1:08:59] pastor's heart, your pastor's heart,
[1:09:01] sometimes he's got to say things that
[1:09:03] sting. You don't feel good.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; But it's not made to destroy. It's made
[1:09:09] to correct.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; And I believe any man of God has that
[1:09:13] objective. Not to destroy, but to
[1:09:16] correct one another along the way. Make
[1:09:19] the thing settle it so that that it can
[1:09:22] continue to grow. Like you know, brother
[1:09:26] B talks about walking down there many
[1:09:28] times. This light little illustrations.
[1:09:29] as he goes. He says he looked at this
[1:09:31] one one uh uh log and uh how it was all
[1:09:36] it is all twisted because something laid
[1:09:39] over top of it and it makes it grow
[1:09:42] wrong. Sometimes you have to just remove
[1:09:44] the growth.
[1:09:46] It'll grow back again.
[1:09:49] Above all things was the scriptures say
[1:09:51] as we read here tonight
[1:09:54] these things that God has done. You
[1:09:56] know, we we're living in what we call
[1:09:58] sometimes I we at home is like, you
[1:10:01] know, the spirit of television and
[1:10:03] entertainment is is is a is a tremendous
[1:10:06] power and an influence, especially on
[1:10:10] the young people, but I I want you to
[1:10:13] just just hear me out. I don't mean it
[1:10:14] in any bad way, but I don't believe
[1:10:16] there's one single thing that can
[1:10:18] overcome is too great for God. He is no
[1:10:22] less to handle the latest device that
[1:10:25] Satan has put out there.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; He is no less God. He's able to conquer
[1:10:29] all things.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Just trust him for it. You have
[1:10:33] different ways to raise your children
[1:10:34] than we did when we were there. Why? I
[1:10:36] mean, uh, you know what? Even when we
[1:10:38] grew up as kids on the farm, why we
[1:10:41] didn't have a quarter, we didn't know
[1:10:42] what temptation was hardly. We heard we
[1:10:45] never heard conversations today that
[1:10:47] it's been spoken and we didn't know
[1:10:49] words that they use today.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; They weren't even our vocabulary.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; And yet we had to fight to overcome.
[1:10:59] And it's the same thing here. You know,
[1:11:01] you've got some of the most powerful
[1:11:03] reality out you. If there is a question,
[1:11:05] it's in the it's in the answer book.
[1:11:08] It's in the Bible. If it isn't there,
[1:11:09] you don't find it. He'll say the find
[1:11:10] the prophet and say it'll go back there
[1:11:12] and show you in the scripture where it's
[1:11:13] written. sometimes and that and that's
[1:11:15] what's important and I really do believe
[1:11:16] that. I leave you with these thoughts as
[1:11:18] well. What I do really believe as a
[1:11:19] pastor or as a shepherd or as a brother
[1:11:21] that's preaching this gospel.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; If you watch and watch the way the word
[1:11:26] of God kept unfolding progressively,
[1:11:30] there's many times brother Bram stops
[1:11:32] and he said, "See, I used to think,
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; oh, I used to think that, oh, I I wish I
[1:11:38] could meet brother Neville and and and
[1:11:40] but there he is floating in a cloud.
[1:11:43] He said, "I used to think." Well, that
[1:11:46] when when he saw that it wasn't right,
[1:11:48] he didn't go back said, "Oh, there goes
[1:11:50] brother Neville floating in a cloud." He
[1:11:52] changed it. He said, "No, I'm when I
[1:11:54] meet brother Neville, I I'm going to
[1:11:56] shake his hand." He said, "Those people
[1:11:57] over there, they were they were human.
[1:11:59] They were like me." He said, "They hug
[1:12:01] me. I hugged them." The saints, look at
[1:12:04] the the that he went beyond the curtain
[1:12:06] of time said they were real. They were
[1:12:08] not myth. So, there's many things
[1:12:10] Brother Bam changed along the way.
[1:12:11] Sometimes you read a 1950 court or 1960
[1:12:14] court, you find out he corrected in '
[1:12:16] 62, 63.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Well, one place he said the seals were
[1:12:19] closed.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Later on he said they're open.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; One person told me said, "What?" I said,
[1:12:24] "What?" said they're closed. I said,
[1:12:26] "What are you going to do with the other
[1:12:27] part that they're open?" Well, I say
[1:12:28] they're closed, but they're opened.
[1:12:30] Hello.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; I'm talking revelation.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; It's not revelation. It It doesn't take
[1:12:37] science to do it either. Just trust the
[1:12:39] Lord. If God says it's changed, in fact,
[1:12:42] when brother Brandham preached the seven
[1:12:43] seals, I I always marvel at I I get all
[1:12:46] excited myself because I I know what
[1:12:47] happens. This Bible, if you ever read it
[1:12:49] through revelated eyes, [clears throat]
[1:12:54] it it it's it's different than what you
[1:12:56] might think it is. Sometimes
[1:12:58] when the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:13:00] strikes you, you'll know that it's not
[1:13:03] you interpreting the word.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; It's God interpreting the word,
[1:13:07] revealing it to you. Amen.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Making it live,
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; making it real. Because after all,
[1:13:13] that's what this and when you change it,
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; just leave it the way it is. Sometimes
[1:13:19] sometimes God says things and you know,
[1:13:21] look at when he preached marriage and
[1:13:22] divorce. You know what he says is one of
[1:13:24] the one of the mysteries
[1:13:28] there was more trouble after he preached
[1:13:29] marriage and divorce than there was
[1:13:30] before almost around less people.
[1:13:34] Somebody's reading it wrong.
[1:13:37] I'm not saying I'm reading it right. But
[1:13:38] I tell you this, it was corrected.
[1:13:42] Everything that was corrected, he
[1:13:44] corrected it and did it right. I'm not
[1:13:47] here to I'm not here to stir up the pot.
[1:13:51] But I tell you this much. When he says
[1:13:53] it's been corrected, from that on you
[1:13:56] say what he said.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Just say what he said. God takes care of
[1:14:01] his own word.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; There's a many things like that. is the
[1:14:04] evidence of the Holy Ghost.
[1:14:07] My for years
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, perfect love. Nothing but perfect
[1:14:11] love will enter there.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; I still believe that's true.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; I don't believe there'll be one blemish,
[1:14:19] but nothing but perfect love. And that
[1:14:20] is not capable. We are not capable of
[1:14:22] doing that,
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; but he is.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; And what we call love sometimes
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; is a filio just not agile.
[1:14:34] love is able to bear one another. But
[1:14:37] when that prophet said things and
[1:14:39] corrected them along the way and just
[1:14:41] like what he said about the seventh seal
[1:14:42] said I I didn't I used to think it
[1:14:44] wasn't even written in there said come
[1:14:45] to find out it was written all the time
[1:14:48] but our eyes were withheld from it
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; on an appointed time then when eyes come
[1:14:53] open
[1:14:55] then it shall be light about the evening
[1:14:58] time.
[1:14:59] You ever take that little course,
[1:15:02] it shall be light about the evening
[1:15:04] time? The path to glory you will surely
[1:15:07] find.
[1:15:09] Start so simple in the waterway is the
[1:15:11] light today.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Buried in the precious name of Jesus
[1:15:15] Christ. Young and old, repent of all
[1:15:17] your sins.
[1:15:19] The Holy Ghost will surely enter in.
[1:15:22] Here's my part I like. It is a fact.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; I like that little part. It is a fact.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:30] that God and Christ are one. It is a
[1:15:32] fact that the mysteries of the seven
[1:15:35] thunders has been revealed. It is a fact
[1:15:37] that the invisible union is going on
[1:15:39] right now. It is a fact. Go back all the
[1:15:42] way back to Genesis. It is a fact that
[1:15:44] God is here doing the work
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; while it's progressing daily on. He's
[1:15:49] just the Holy Spirit's moving just the
[1:15:50] same. And many times it's hard to keep
[1:15:52] up with it.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; But just walk with it.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, it becomes greater and greater
[1:15:58] and greater because it is the reality of
[1:16:00] Jesus Christ to you personally and it'll
[1:16:02] never contradict the message. You'll
[1:16:04] find out. Then if you open it to say,
[1:16:05] "Well, he said it here, but he corrected
[1:16:07] it here. Then we'll keep going on with
[1:16:09] that. We keep doing that. We keep moving
[1:16:10] on with that." It keeps building, keeps
[1:16:13] building, keeps building.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Until you look back and say, "Say, we've
[1:16:18] gained a little ground.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; We're moving higher.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Set your wings to the winds of faith.
[1:16:26] Give me a key on that if you would. I'm
[1:16:28] going to set that. Who Who plays the
[1:16:30] piano here?
[1:16:33] Oh yeah. I'm sorry about that. I'm
[1:16:35] getting all
[1:16:37] I like that part. There are two roads
[1:16:40] you can take.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; One by faith, one by sight.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; And the law
[1:16:49] of good and evil
[1:16:52] contrast will always be here. I tell
[1:16:55] you, it's so simple. Sometimes you think
[1:16:57] if God ever removed it, we wouldn't
[1:16:58] appreciate a single thing.
[1:17:01] [clears throat] But because the law of
[1:17:03] God, it takes the negative to appreciate
[1:17:06] the positive.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "If there wasn't an
[1:17:09] evil, wicked man or woman out there, you
[1:17:12] wouldn't know a righteous one.
[1:17:16] If there wasn't a sinner, you wouldn't
[1:17:19] know what an overcomer was."
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat]
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; If this one said, "I said, I just can't.
[1:17:24] Oh, I just can't overcome. Here comes
[1:17:25] one and said, "Oh [music] my,
[1:17:28] all I do is just set my wings."
[1:17:32] Cuz it's not you that does the
[1:17:33] overcoming.
[1:17:35] It's Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[1:17:38] Greater is he that's in you than he
[1:17:40] that's in [music] the world.
[1:17:43] Sing that together. [music]
[1:17:46] There are two roads. [singing]
[1:17:49] You can take
[1:17:52] one by
[1:17:57] one by way.
[1:18:00] Just take the word of God [music]
[1:18:05] or what you see.
[1:18:08] [music]
[1:18:09] What you believe
[1:18:13] is [singing] what will be.
[1:18:17] All set your way [music]
[1:18:21] to the wind.
[1:18:26] You [music] can lie [singing]
[1:18:29] in a higher place.
[1:18:34] Do [singing and music] not struggle.
[1:18:38] It's my grave.
[1:18:41] [music]
[1:18:42] Set your glory
[1:18:45] to the [singing] wind of pain.
[1:18:49] Oh, watch your knees. What is it
[1:18:52] tonight? Watch your cry.
[1:18:57] [music]
[1:18:58] Watch your mountain.
[1:19:01] Is it your cry?
[1:19:05] Just be the word of God.
[1:19:09] And by and by [music and singing]
[1:19:13] oh it will
[1:19:17] far [music and singing] you will fly.
[1:19:21] So set your way [music]
[1:19:25] to the waves of f [singing]
[1:19:30] you can fly [music]
[1:19:33] to a higher.
[1:19:37] Oh, do not struggle. [music]
[1:19:41] For it's [singing] by grace,
[1:19:45] [music]
[1:19:46] send your
[1:19:49] to
[1:19:52] [music]
[1:19:54] watch the eagle
[1:19:58] in the sky. It's not a chicken, it's an
[1:20:00] eagle. He does not [music] struggle. I
[1:20:04] like that. He does not cry [music]
[1:20:09] for the power
[1:20:12] [music]
[1:20:13] that makes him [singing]
[1:20:18] all.
[1:20:22] [music]
[1:20:25] So send your way
[1:20:29] to the [music] window.
[1:20:34] You can fly [singing]
[1:20:37] to a [music] higher place.
[1:20:42] Do not struggle
[1:20:45] for is my gra [music]
[1:20:53] to the
[1:20:58] you are faithful
[1:21:01] oh Lord
[1:21:04] [music] you are faithful
[1:21:07] oh Lord
[1:21:11] Every day
[1:21:14] and every [music] hour
[1:21:19] you are faithful,
[1:21:22] oh
[1:21:24] Lord. [music] Why don't we stand to our
[1:21:25] feet? You are faithful,
[1:21:30] oh
[1:21:31] Lord.
[1:21:34] Yes, you are [singing] faithful.
[1:21:37] [music]
[1:21:38] Oh,
[1:21:43] every day
[1:21:47] and [music] every hour
[1:21:51] you are faith.
[1:21:54] [music]
[1:21:55] Oh
[1:21:57] Lord, let's bow our hearts and close our
[1:22:00] eyes. Is there one here would [music]
[1:22:02] say tonight, Lord, I know you're
[1:22:05] faithful. Keep me faithful.
[1:22:08] Reward me with the reward of saying to
[1:22:11] him that overcomemeth,
[1:22:13] I would grant to sit with [music] my as
[1:22:15] I sit with my father.
[1:22:18] If you're sick tonight, he was wounded.
[1:22:23] If you're in a trial or a test, [music]
[1:22:25] greater is he that goes before you.
[1:22:28] Never hurry. Never be weary. Cast your
[1:22:31] [music] cares upon him for he cares.
[1:22:35] You don't have to change anything. It's
[1:22:36] already done. He was wounded, bruised
[1:22:39] for our iniquity.
[1:22:41] Pray with me as [music] we commit these
[1:22:43] requests in your heart's desire to the
[1:22:45] Lord. Father,
[1:22:48] we commit them to you, Lord Jesus. I
[1:22:50] believe there [music] are Christians
[1:22:51] here tonight that believes every word
[1:22:54] that stands for this truth. Their whole
[1:22:56] life [music] is dedicated to you. Yet
[1:22:58] the battle sometimes gets greater and
[1:23:01] sometimes to [music] a place to where we
[1:23:02] feel like, Lord, how shall I rise above
[1:23:05] that
[1:23:06] by obeying and [music] walking in the
[1:23:09] light and faithfully staying true to
[1:23:11] your word.
[1:23:13] Bless the saints, Lord, the shepherd,
[1:23:15] the pastor here, the deacons, the
[1:23:16] trustees, [music] the musicians. May
[1:23:19] this be a lighthouse when you come, Lord
[1:23:21] Jesus. May there be saints who are
[1:23:23] reaching out when the [music] rapture
[1:23:25] takes place, Lord.
[1:23:27] I pray God that you'd add more too. If
[1:23:30] there's anybody out there, Lord, Lord,
[1:23:32] may we find them, Lord. We don't know
[1:23:33] where they're at, but preach the good
[1:23:35] news. Go tell it on the mountain
[1:23:38] everywhere that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:23:42] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:23:45] Take away our doubt, Lord.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Forgive us of our trespasses, Lord. And
[1:23:49] as we press toward the mark, laying
[1:23:51] aside every evil thought, we press
[1:23:54] toward the mark of the prize of high
[1:23:55] calling. We commit ourselves to you
[1:23:57] tonight and take an encouragement as we
[1:24:00] go to our homes. We thank you for this
[1:24:02] evening here tonight and in fellowship
[1:24:04] with your elect lady
[1:24:06] unto the elect lady. Right. Wasn't to
[1:24:10] the church age altogether was to the
[1:24:12] elect lady in [music] the age. Now to
[1:24:15] you the king immortal, the only wise
[1:24:16] God. We commit all things to [music] you
[1:24:19] Lord. The only true God, the living God.
[1:24:22] We pray and ask in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:24:26] Amen.
[1:24:27] Amen.
[1:24:29] This world is not my home. [music]
[1:24:32] I'm just a passage.
[1:24:36] My treasure is all
[1:24:39] somewhere.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; [music and singing]
[1:24:50] [music]
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; home in this [singing] world anymore.
[1:24:56] Oh Lord, you know I [music and singing]
[1:25:00] have no friend like you.
[1:25:04] Heaven is not my home.
[1:25:07] Lord, what [singing] will I do?
[1:25:11] Ain't no me. [music] I have this open
[1:25:16] door and I can't feel at home [singing]
[1:25:20] in this world anymore. [music]
[1:25:25] Amen.
[1:25:26] Let me enjoy the word of the Lord
[1:25:28] tonight.
[1:25:29] Amen. [music]
[1:25:32] And we thank the Lord for brother Minnow
[1:25:34] just like a meat sandwich.
[1:25:38] Certainly appreciate that. And um we
[1:25:41] have a few prayer requests um
[1:25:46] tonight as we'll go to prayer just for a
[1:25:49] few moments.
[1:25:51] Um
[1:25:54] in a week or so I'll be going to
[1:25:56] Bogotaa, Colombia and Perea on a
[1:26:00] missionary trip and I covet your
[1:26:01] prayers. if you could keep me in your
[1:26:04] prayers. Myself and brother Mark
[1:26:06] Castillo, our good friend there from
[1:26:08] Bayer, New Mexico. Also, Sister Heather,
[1:26:12] she pulled a muscle a muscle in her left
[1:26:15] knee today and she was in [music] pain
[1:26:18] and um she's asking for prayer there.
[1:26:23] Also, Brother Art Salceto sent a text
[1:26:27] from his cousin James [music] Gutteras.
[1:26:30] He's asking for four things.
[1:26:34] Deliverance from a drug addiction,
[1:26:36] [music]
[1:26:37] deliverance from alcohol,
[1:26:41] and will to stay in the service of the
[1:26:44] Lord. That's number three. And number
[1:26:46] [music] four, he's on dialysis and is
[1:26:48] looking to have his kidneys healed.
[1:26:52] So, he's specifically asking for those
[1:26:54] four things. Also, [music]
[1:26:56] Brother Arts got a number of his family
[1:26:59] that are still um they've been going to
[1:27:02] the Bible study. So, they have another
[1:27:03] one coming up [music] in on Tuesday or
[1:27:05] so and it's been growing and little just
[1:27:08] his family members. So, pray for that
[1:27:10] family that the Lord will continue to
[1:27:12] bless them. It's a mystery how the word
[1:27:16] of God just gets a hold of a life like
[1:27:18] that and keep them in prayer. [music]
[1:27:21] Was there someone else here that had a
[1:27:22] request tonight? Yes, brother.
[1:27:27] Yes, brother Sean's going to North
[1:27:29] Carolina there with Dylan. He's asking
[1:27:31] for traveling mercies. Was there someone
[1:27:33] else that had a request, brother? Yes,
[1:27:37] Jonathan.
[1:27:41] Yes.
[1:27:45] Yes. What's that family name?
[1:27:52] Sabrina and her family. was in an
[1:27:54] accident.
[1:28:00] Okay.
[1:28:06] Yeah, pretty tragic accident. I think
[1:28:08] they lost one of the children and then
[1:28:11] some of them were in and out of the
[1:28:14] hospital, I believe. So, we want to keep
[1:28:15] that family in prayer um from the Tucson
[1:28:20] Tabernacle there. Some of those folks
[1:28:23] are really sad and so we'll keep them in
[1:28:25] prayer. Was there someone else that had
[1:28:27] a request they wanted to make known?
[1:28:29] Amen.
[1:28:31] Let's sing a little bit of that. Every
[1:28:33] day, every hour, you are faithful, oh
[1:28:36] God.
[1:28:39] Every day,

[1:29:39] oh God.
[1:29:42] every [music and singing] day,
[1:29:45] every hour,

[1:29:48] you are faithful,
[1:29:52] oh God.
[1:29:55] Amen. Always pray for one another. Um,
[1:29:59] and so we'll take a few moments and
[1:30:01] [music] you can pray right at your seat.
[1:30:03] You can go down on your knees and pray
[1:30:05] and ask God to hear these requests and
[1:30:09] to pray for one another. God bless you.

[1:46:59] [music]
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank God for his
[1:47:32] goodness to us.
[1:47:34] I'm just thinking of the scripture that
[1:47:36] one of the scriptures that brother Menow
[1:47:38] referred to in 1 Corinthians 1 verse 18.
[1:47:41] For the preaching of the cross is to
[1:47:43] them that perish foolishness,
[1:47:46] but unto us which are saved. It is the
[1:47:50] power of God.
[1:47:52] For it is written, I will destroy the
[1:47:54] wisdom of the wise and bring to nothing
[1:47:57] the understanding of the prudent. Amen.
[1:48:00] So, we thank God he calls us in our
[1:48:04] simplicity, in our little peculiar ways.
[1:48:06] Amen. It's just so simple. a man can go
[1:48:10] down on his knees and pray and all of
[1:48:14] heaven will hear him or he'll hear her
[1:48:17] and answer a prayer just miraculously.
[1:48:20] So, we'll stand to our feet. Uh
[1:48:22] remember, there's a youth Bible study.
[1:48:24] Brother Kim is going to uh teach that
[1:48:27] for us this Friday. It'll be here at 6.
[1:48:31] It's in the um the announcements there
[1:48:35] um for the older I think it's 14 and up,
[1:48:38] something like that.
[1:48:39] And um I think it'll be very good.
[1:48:42] Brother Kim is a real blessing to us and
[1:48:45] we kind of tease a lot and but he really
[1:48:49] is a blessing and I thank God for him. I
[1:48:51] look forward to um some of the things he
[1:48:54] would have to say. He's taught and he
[1:48:56] was an educator and dealt with the kids
[1:48:58] there in in a large school there up in
[1:49:01] Cloverdale and has done so much
[1:49:04] experience with different things. And I
[1:49:05] know and believe it'll be a blessing for
[1:49:08] you. And if you can uh get uh take the
[1:49:14] time and get uh someone that you think
[1:49:17] would help yourself is actually adults
[1:49:21] and and for the youth. I think it'll be
[1:49:23] a blessing. Amen.
[1:49:25] Let us sing that song. Any more
[1:49:28] announcements
[1:49:30] that I'm not thinking of? No. Let's sing
[1:49:32] that song. When we all get to heaven,
[1:49:34] what a day of rejoicing that will be.
