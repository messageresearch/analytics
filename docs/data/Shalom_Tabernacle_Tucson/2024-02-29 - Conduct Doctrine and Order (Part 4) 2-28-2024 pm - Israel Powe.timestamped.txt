[26:07] each of you here we always expecting the
[26:09] Lord to do something very nice for us
[26:12] amen praise the Lord amen while you're
[26:15] standing we' like to take a scripture or
[26:18] just speak for a few moments we've been
[26:20] talking on conduct
[26:23] order and Doctrine some of those things
[26:27] and the scripture we like to take
[26:30] is found in Luke chap
[26:50] 14 there another Parable similar to it
[26:53] in Matthew chapter 10 but we'll take
[26:55] this one in Luke
[27:04] 14 verse number
[27:09] 25 and there went a great multitude with
[27:12] him and he turned and said unto them if
[27:15] any man come to me and hate not his
[27:18] father and mother and wife and children
[27:21] and Brethren and sisters yeah and his
[27:26] own life also
[27:28] he cannot be my disciple and whosoever
[27:31] does not bear his cross and come after
[27:35] me cannot be my disciple amen we'll take
[27:40] one more scripture in Matthew chapter
[27:47] 10 these are the words of Our
[27:50] Lord Parables that we call
[27:56] them
[27:58] and verse number 24 Matthew
[28:04] 10:24 the disciple is not above his
[28:09] master nor the servant above his Lord it
[28:14] is enough for the disciple that he be as
[28:17] his master and the servant as his Lord
[28:21] if they have called The Master of the
[28:23] House be elub how much more shall they
[28:26] call them
[28:28] of his
[28:29] household fear them not therefore for
[28:31] there is nothing covered that shall not
[28:33] be revealed and hid that shall not be
[28:37] known what I tell you in darkness that
[28:40] speak ye in light and what you hear in
[28:43] the ear that preach ye upon the
[28:46] housetops and fear not them which kill
[28:49] the body but are not able to kill the
[28:51] soul but rather fear him which is able
[28:55] to destroy the both soul and and Body in
[28:58] Hell the scriptures goes on to
[29:02] say in verse 34 think not that I am come
[29:07] to send peace on the earth I came not to
[29:10] send peace but a sword for I am come to
[29:14] set a man at variance against his father
[29:18] and the daughter against her mother and
[29:21] the daughter-in-law against her
[29:23] mother-in-law and a man's foes shall be
[29:26] they of his own
[29:28] household he that loveth father or
[29:31] mother more than me is not worthy of me
[29:35] and he that loveth son or daughter more
[29:39] than me is not worthy of me and he that
[29:43] taketh not his cross and followeth after
[29:46] me is not worthy of me he that findeth
[29:51] his life shall lose it and he that
[29:54] loseth his life for my sake
[29:57] shall find it isn't that nice let us
[30:01] pray Lord Jesus we ask your blessings on
[30:05] the word in Jesus name amen God bless
[30:08] you you may be seated as you're being
[30:11] seated there's a scripture found in
[30:13] Colossians chapter 3 veres
[30:18] 1-5 and it says this this is the word of
[30:21] God if ye the been risen with Christ
[30:25] seek those things which are above above
[30:28] where Christ sth on the right hand of
[30:30] God set your affections on things above
[30:35] not on the things of the Earth for ye
[30:38] are dead and your life is hid with
[30:41] Christ in God when Christ who is our
[30:45] life shall appear then shall ye also
[30:47] appear with him in glory mortify or put
[30:51] to death Therefore your members which
[30:54] are upon the Earth fornication
[30:56] uncleanliness
[30:57] inordinate affection evil concupisent
[31:01] and covetousness which is
[31:04] idolatry so we put those things to death
[31:07] you know these two
[31:09] Parables and there's one more we'll get
[31:11] to in Luke chapter 9 are the very strong
[31:16] Parables where the Lord is
[31:18] directly telling you to hate your father
[31:23] and your mother and we know he's not
[31:26] telling us us to hate our parents
[31:28] because that wouldn't be consistent with
[31:30] the laws of Moses because Moses put it
[31:33] in there honor thy father and thy mother
[31:36] and so that you would live long upon the
[31:38] Earth and so what is he doing here he's
[31:42] showing you that the requirement in
[31:45] order to be a disciple and a disciple
[31:48] simply means a follower there a I forget
[31:52] what the Greek word is but that's what
[31:54] it means it means a follower or a pupil
[31:58] and a pupil is a student that's still in
[32:01] class you're still learning so a
[32:03] disciple that word disciple is someone
[32:06] that's following that's still learning
[32:08] you're you're one of Christ's disciples
[32:11] and Jesus puts the worthiness to be
[32:14] called a disciple and he uses these
[32:17] things that are of the greatest care to
[32:19] us I can't think of anything more
[32:22] valuable than the Human
[32:24] family actually I've learned that you
[32:27] know that's probably the most valuable
[32:30] thing that you have particularly when
[32:32] you can't speak for yourself or you're
[32:34] hurt or you're in trouble or you're in
[32:37] danger who typically shows up your
[32:40] family your family will be there for you
[32:44] and church family too CU it's kind of
[32:46] intertwined there and so but Jesus here
[32:49] is now putting he he he he said I don't
[32:52] want you to think that I came to bring
[32:54] peace upon the earth I come come to set
[32:57] a man at variance with his family
[33:01] members and he's showing us The
[33:03] Importance of Being a disciple the cost
[33:08] the price that it takes to really be a
[33:11] disciple and then as we shared with you
[33:14] on Sunday and we've been sharing on on
[33:18] this little part conduct we're still on
[33:20] the conduct part that our life is not
[33:22] our own that actually our time is not
[33:24] our own and in this parable Jesus said
[33:27] that the master I mean you can't think
[33:30] of yourself being greater the disciple
[33:33] is not above his master neither the
[33:36] servant above his Lord so who is the
[33:40] master who's the one that called us
[33:43] we'll never be above him he's the one
[33:45] who called us and he's the reason why we
[33:48] are actually here on the earth amen now
[33:51] this age will get you twisted in your
[33:53] mind and you think you're here for other
[33:55] purposes and we think things are
[33:58] valuable here and we'll in the world
[34:01] will fight for things that they think
[34:03] are valuable but they're not really
[34:05] valuable God's word shows us what's
[34:08] valuable and these things that we're
[34:10] talking about Christ who is our life we
[34:14] mortify the Deeds of our of our body so
[34:17] that we could we could um be true
[34:20] servants to him now there's another
[34:22] scripture found in Luke Chapter N I like
[34:25] to turn there
[34:30] quickly of course we went
[34:32] through the importance of coming
[34:35] together how we meet together what the
[34:37] Christian church
[34:40] does
[34:42] and these
[34:45] are this is what makes us who we are is
[34:49] is our discipleship when we come to him
[34:54] we make it up in our mind there's a
[34:56] tremendous decision that has to be make
[34:58] made when we were called to serve him
[35:02] it's not the Hollywood version it's not
[35:05] the Casual version that's right I mean
[35:08] this is life or death to be called to be
[35:12] a disciple you may have to give your
[35:15] life that reality escapes many many
[35:18] people we we don't think of it that way
[35:20] but we may have to give our life for
[35:22] what we believe and that's how important
[35:25] it is Kingdom of Light against the
[35:28] kingdom of darkness in in Luke chapter 9
[35:32] vers verse 57 it says and it came to
[35:34] pass that as they went in the way a
[35:37] certain man said unto
[35:40] himl I will follow thee whether soever
[35:44] thou goest now this certain man was a
[35:46] scribe Matthew chapter 8 will tell you
[35:49] he was a scribe meaning he was um he
[35:52] knew the law he was a well educated man
[35:56] and he's here telling the Lord I'll
[35:57] follow you wherever you go Look What the
[36:00] Lord says and Jesus said unto him foxes
[36:03] have holes birds of the air have Nest
[36:06] but the son of man hath not where to lay
[36:09] his head and he said to another follow
[36:13] me but he said Lord suffer me first to
[36:16] go and bury my
[36:20] father I need to go put my dad to rest
[36:23] and Jesus said unto him let the dead
[36:26] bury they're dead but go thou and preach
[36:29] the kingdom of God and another also said
[36:33] Lord I will follow thee but let me first
[36:36] go bid them farewell which are at home
[36:40] at my house I just want to go say Bye
[36:42] Lord I'm going to tell all my friends
[36:45] goodbye in my home and Jesus said unto
[36:47] him no man having put his hand to the
[36:50] plow and looking back is fit for the
[36:54] kingdom of God it seems seems kind of
[36:57] harsh I mean this guy just wants to go
[37:00] back and bury his daddy and Jesus tells
[37:04] him you go you let the dead go bury
[37:07] their
[37:08] dead and then this other one wants to go
[37:11] bid the people farewell B them F real
[37:13] now now these These are these are The
[37:16] Parables that Jesus are is bringing to
[37:18] us this is not someone else this is our
[37:20] the loving Lord Jesus and he's putting
[37:24] this variance between the things that we
[37:26] hold so dear and the relationships we
[37:29] hold so well and we seem like they're so
[37:32] important to us and they are but if it
[37:35] came to it if it really came to it and
[37:38] you had to choose a real disciple must
[37:42] be aware that you might have to make
[37:44] that choice to take Jesus over everyone
[37:47] else wife daughter son friend whatever
[37:54] it is husband whatever it it is if I
[37:57] have to if it gets to that and that
[38:00] reality needs to be made plain to us
[38:02] that's where the value of it is it's not
[38:05] just word it it when you see it played
[38:09] out in people's lives and I have I've
[38:12] seen it played out you have two a man or
[38:15] a woman they'll come to the Lord and
[38:17] their family turns against them come to
[38:21] the Lord and even their health they'll
[38:23] be attacked in their health and there's
[38:26] health wealthy people out here living
[38:28] like the devil and there's good clean
[38:31] solid nice loving people honest will
[38:35] serve the Lord and looks like he their
[38:38] health is always at a battle right why
[38:42] does it happen that way because we're
[38:44] we're called to be disciples and
[38:46] disciples we're not just learning of him
[38:49] we're not just learning but we pick up
[38:50] our cross and we follow him that means
[38:54] we follow his example
[38:57] it isn't just a disciple isn't just
[38:59] knowing what Jesus said it's doing what
[39:02] he did on it's following amen so
[39:07] disciple we're not talking about talking
[39:08] about being a disciple or knowing what
[39:10] Jesus taught or knowing what the Bible
[39:13] says about these issues are you doing
[39:16] them then when you're doing them then we
[39:19] can call ourselves disciples and Jesus
[39:23] puts this right to our face right in our
[39:26] faith that we might have to turn against
[39:29] those that we love so dear now in Luke
[39:32] chap 14 look at the examples that our
[39:35] Lord gives in that Parable he says for
[39:39] what
[39:40] man is building a
[39:43] tower and he doesn't count up the
[39:47] cost before building the tower then he
[39:50] goes and he takes the example of a king
[39:53] what king is going to go to war you're
[39:56] going to go fight another kingdom and
[39:59] you don't study out how many men you
[40:01] need for this battle what kind of Battle
[40:04] Ground are we going to be fighting in
[40:06] what kind and Jesus gives these example
[40:09] examples and then uh brings in this you
[40:14] know that that if you can't um hate
[40:20] father mother hate wife children and
[40:24] Brethren and sisters
[40:27] if you can't hate your own life you
[40:29] can't even serve me
[40:32] properly so it's like your life his life
[40:36] and his mission has to be more valuable
[40:41] than your own
[40:43] life and that's a real disciple that's
[40:46] somebody that's going to follow through
[40:48] follow the orders it's like in the army
[40:53] or in the in the military you know you
[40:55] have orderers to go into an area where
[40:58] it's very violent it's hot and people
[41:01] are dying and you know they're dying but
[41:04] you're called to go and fight in that
[41:06] front a real Soldier he'll go because
[41:10] when because in boot camp they clearly
[41:13] tell you not all of y'all coming back
[41:16] home they tell them that they let them
[41:18] know you're not everybody's not coming
[41:21] back home it' be great we're in a time
[41:23] of War many of you will not come back
[41:25] home and they got to settle that in your
[41:29] mind so when you get on the battlefield
[41:31] you're not trying to think whether I
[41:33] might have to give no that's already
[41:35] answered I'm ready to give my life and
[41:38] then you go forward and you fight the
[41:40] fight and this fight that we're we're
[41:42] fighting is a good fight it's a fight
[41:45] worth fighting for and who who are we
[41:49] fighting for we're fighting for the Lord
[41:52] Jesus
[41:53] Christ now this uh disciple is a learner
[41:58] it's a pupil it's a student that's in
[42:02] school and really when I looked at these
[42:06] um these three parables in Luke chapter
[42:09] 14 Matthew chapter 10 and then Luke
[42:12] Chapter
[42:13] n um the what I'm what I'm getting out
[42:17] of that is that you know the Lord was
[42:21] you know in those Parables the Lord was
[42:23] requir requiring of their
[42:27] time and their time is what you would
[42:31] need in order to I mean to build a tower
[42:36] or to to go into war and um uh you know
[42:42] he said to to follow me the foxes have
[42:44] holes the birds have nest and and and
[42:49] but the son of man doesn't have a place
[42:51] to lay his head I I'm asking you to
[42:54] follow me and and then when when we get
[42:58] ready to follow him okay but Lord let me
[43:01] go back and bury my
[43:02] dad let the dead bury the
[43:06] dead uh go preach the word that's what
[43:10] he told him he says you go Let the dead
[43:13] bury the Go Let the dead bury the dead
[43:16] bury their dead and you go preach the
[43:18] gospel it's more valuable more important
[43:22] that the gospel of the kingdom is
[43:24] preached than you to go take care of
[43:27] your family matters now can we take care
[43:30] of Family Matters yes but what's more
[43:34] important and if it comes down to it
[43:36] which one do we have to choose
[43:39] from the the importance is that the
[43:41] gospel is preached yes that's right
[43:44] because guess what there's going to be
[43:45] another funeral
[43:47] anyways and and by the ways the person
[43:51] who died they already lived their life
[43:53] not being cold or heartless but they've
[43:56] lived their life what's what's really
[43:58] more important I mean go to the funeral
[44:01] but go preach the gospel at the funeral
[44:03] that's more that's more valuable go
[44:06] preach the gospel this is the purpose
[44:09] that the church the doors will open
[44:11] today yes I'm sad I missed a valuable
[44:16] opportunity on Sunday morning we had
[44:17] several visitors here I didn't even give
[44:19] a call to for somebody to be saved I
[44:23] thought about that mine was nervous and
[44:25] I'm thought and Levi gave me an
[44:27] announcement I failed to read that and
[44:29] then you just you fail to to catch you
[44:32] know those little opportunities but it's
[44:34] like my goodness the church is here to
[44:39] you know we're here to see Souls saved
[44:42] we we're here to give the opportunity
[44:43] for somebody to receive the Holy Ghost
[44:45] and be saved and delivered that's why
[44:48] the doors are open um and so uh we don't
[44:52] want we don't want to miss those
[44:53] opportunities do we that's right when
[44:56] they come Lord help us you know newcomer
[44:59] comes into the assembly and they leave
[45:02] and nobody reaches out to them that's
[45:06] that's kind of a tragedy and you know
[45:09] and we're looking at them we're watching
[45:11] at them and and and for a newcomer to
[45:13] come they they'll they'll can feel
[45:16] people looking at them and they might
[45:19] take it that we're being cold but we're
[45:21] we're we're very it's a curious lovable
[45:24] look is what we're looking at the
[45:26] visitors I mean I don't know a Christian
[45:28] people that don't like to see visitors
[45:30] in their church we love it but the
[45:33] visitors don't know we love it if we
[45:35] don't tell them that we just looking at
[45:38] them and then don't say nothing I'm
[45:40] talking as a visitor I remember my
[45:42] visitor thoughts coming into a group
[45:45] where you you know you're the newcomer
[45:47] and everybody's looking I see them
[45:49] looking at me they acting like they a't
[45:50] looking at me but they all looking at me
[45:53] and you leave here and it you know but
[45:56] you know we should really reach out and
[45:58] take the next step they came to your
[46:02] church it be like them coming in your
[46:05] home and you sit around looking at them
[46:08] and you don't invite and make them feel
[46:11] welcome find out who they are invite
[46:14] them to come back again so we want to we
[46:17] don't want to miss those opportunities
[46:18] amen and so I feel like I miss the
[46:21] opportunity but but the word was
[46:23] preached I thank the Lord for that it's
[46:25] always nice to be able to preach the
[46:26] word to newcomers but this this time
[46:31] that that we have to give it
[46:37] is slowly but surely uh being taken away
[46:42] from us these opportunities we have them
[46:45] and then they're leaving us every day
[46:48] all the time and so what we want to do
[46:52] is want to make the best of our time and
[46:54] I'll read a few quotes on that on giving
[46:57] God our
[47:00] best brother random makes the statement
[47:03] here in the message the unwelcome Christ
[47:07] he says this here paragraph
[47:09] 272 he is worthy of the best what do you
[47:14] what do you do for him give him the
[47:18] leftover oh yes you run around all day
[47:22] and give him three minutes at night
[47:26] before you go to
[47:27] bed Jesus deserves your best friend he
[47:31] deserves everything you got but what do
[47:35] you do about it you give him just
[47:37] anything he takes it he takes it anyhow
[47:41] he takes it but she said I want the best
[47:44] it cost her everything she had to get
[47:47] the best and that's what you ought to do
[47:50] give your best to give him your best
[47:53] give him the best of your life give him
[47:56] the best of your songs give him all of
[47:59] your talents give him everything you got
[48:02] give him your feet give him your hands
[48:05] give him your eyes give him your mouth
[48:08] give him your ears give him your soul
[48:11] give him your heart give him your praise
[48:15] give him everything you got
[48:18] Hallelujah he deserving of the best amen
[48:25] think that in the message washing
[48:27] Jesus's feet paragraph 31 brother banam
[48:31] says this and some of you people that
[48:33] don't go to church shame on you go to
[48:36] church about once a year and that's on
[48:39] Easter to show your uh pretty hat that's
[48:44] right but you know what God deserves the
[48:48] first place Jesus ought to have the
[48:50] first place in every life but we give
[48:53] him about the fourth place he deserves
[48:56] the first place well you say I pray once
[48:59] a day that's all right he receives it if
[49:02] you want to give him fourth place that's
[49:04] all right he'll take it you only went to
[49:08] church once this year maybe and wore the
[49:10] new hat and everything but he never
[49:12] condemned you for it that's what makes
[49:15] him God to me if you want to give him
[49:18] fourth place or fifth place he'll take
[49:20] it he'll take anything you give him but
[49:23] he ought to have the first place
[49:26] he ought to have the best we can give he
[49:29] ought to have our first our best our all
[49:34] he's deserving of
[49:36] it amen God manifesting his gifts
[49:40] brother bandam says
[49:43] this now the next thing she did do could
[49:47] you realize what the woman had before
[49:49] her she had three months of desert road
[49:52] to travel on the back of a camel 3
[49:55] months over Over The Burning Sands of
[49:56] the desert she had a PR price to pay and
[50:00] another thing being a woman and all that
[50:04] travel and also in the desert at the
[50:07] time the sons of ishmail was there and
[50:10] they were robbers the woman had made up
[50:13] her mind that she wasn't going
[50:14] empty-handed and she loaded camels down
[50:17] with wealth she brought for she brought
[50:20] in frankincense gold silver mirror
[50:24] perfumes the Great that there was in her
[50:27] kingdom for she thought this in her
[50:29] heart if it was of God she wanted to
[50:32] give God the best she had and if this
[50:35] Christian church today would only think
[50:37] that in their
[50:38] heart the god of Heaven deserves your
[50:42] best of everything you have the best of
[50:45] your time all of your devotion and
[50:48] everything you are you owe it to God we
[50:51] give God just maybe a few minutes on
[50:54] Sunday set and go to sleep while the
[50:57] Sunday school teacher is teaching go
[50:59] home and think we've done our religion
[51:01] for the week what a
[51:02] disgrace I know I got a name of being
[51:05] hard I'm not hard but what it is I've
[51:07] got to stand in judgment with each one
[51:10] of
[51:11] you Amen brother bandam continues in the
[51:14] message Hebrews chapter
[51:16] 2 um number two this is paragraph
[51:20] 114 and he says this here God must have
[51:25] have first place in your
[51:27] heart first place in your life first
[51:32] place in everything that you do or what
[51:35] you are God must be first he doesn't
[51:39] want the second place he doesn't deserve
[51:42] the second place he deserves the best
[51:46] and the first and all that we got he
[51:50] deserves it Blessed Be His holy name
[51:54] amen God deserves that
[51:56] want you to think of that we think of
[51:58] our time who deserves the best of our
[52:02] time that's right he does he deserves
[52:06] the best of our time the best of what we
[52:09] have to offer and to give he deserves
[52:12] our youth the strength that we have the
[52:16] time we spend studying we should turn
[52:20] that back over to him for his kingdom
[52:22] sake the time that we use for any other
[52:25] thing it should be somehow directed
[52:27] towards his purpose for we're here for
[52:31] his purpose and he deserves the best
[52:33] that we have brother Ram talks about how
[52:35] we come to church and when we dress we
[52:38] should dress with our best that he gives
[52:42] us and you know this age has has totally
[52:47] switched that around and it's more you
[52:49] know this the you know the culture or
[52:52] the the way that people dress in public
[52:55] today is just really a shame and then
[52:58] you see that creeping right over into
[53:00] the church world but he really still
[53:02] deserves our best you know and dressing
[53:04] our best isn't the most convenient it
[53:08] doesn't mean being the most comfortable
[53:10] you want to get comfortable you do that
[53:12] on your couch at home but when you're
[53:14] dressing your best that's um that's
[53:17] showing the attitude that you have for
[53:20] what you're doing it's reflected on the
[53:23] way you carry yourself outside it shows
[53:28] on what your importance of things that's
[53:30] going on inside of you and there's
[53:32] things we can dress appropriately for
[53:34] there's things you're going fishing you
[53:35] dress appropriately for that you going
[53:38] skydiving those that would do that you
[53:40] dress appropriately for that mountain
[53:42] climbing and you come to church there
[53:45] should be an appropriate dress for that
[53:48] and um and the world is not the dictator
[53:52] of that it shouldn't be and what the
[53:55] other uh people are doing out there in
[53:58] the world shouldn't be our example
[54:00] either our example should be the word of
[54:04] God now is the word concerned about the
[54:06] way we dress
[54:08] absolutely there's several scriptures
[54:10] that talks about the women's dress and
[54:13] how they should dress and how they
[54:15] should not dress I'm not going to get in
[54:17] that into that tonight but I'll read one
[54:21] quotation here or so and
[54:26] um because you know the the you know
[54:29] I've been studying on it a little bit
[54:32] and you know just the American public
[54:35] they would dress to go to the movies
[54:37] they're dress to catch a flight in
[54:40] public they would be dressed decently
[54:42] and properly and now people are dressed
[54:46] in the airport taking a flight like I
[54:49] mean it's ridiculous yes and it's it's
[54:52] wild it's Untamed it shows an
[54:56] attitude of a nation that forgot God
[54:59] that's what it looks
[55:00] like and you say well brother Israel it
[55:02] doesn't matter how we dress that's true
[55:04] it doesn't matter in one sense how we
[55:06] dress but you know without without
[55:10] talking to anyone we we judge one
[55:13] another by you know whatever whoever's
[55:15] wearing whatever they're wearing we
[55:17] judge them I judge people the way
[55:19] they're dressed you do too you know
[55:22] guy's dressed up in business casual he's
[55:24] approach you he's going to be different
[55:26] than the guy with his hat on backwards
[55:28] his pants sagging down and uh look like
[55:33] you know and even his gate the way he's
[55:35] walking you're going to judge that and
[55:37] it's and he's representing something the
[55:40] homies in the hood they walk and dress a
[55:43] certain way like all the homies in the
[55:46] hood and that's I'm not trying to be
[55:48] funny it's the truth that's right and
[55:50] people that that's going to church or
[55:52] came from church they ought to look like
[55:54] they came from church not a movie not
[55:58] some social event not a family affair
[56:01] and and and this is not my message
[56:03] tonight but I'm pulling that way but I
[56:06] wanted to read this quote so I can sit
[56:07] down to be honest with you but but I've
[56:11] been studying it and been looking at it
[56:13] and and
[56:16] what something brother brandom said here
[56:19] I want to read this for
[56:22] you all
[56:23] right I'm sure I brought
[56:28] it
[56:30] but you know this age shouldn't be our
[56:34] example that's
[56:37] right
[56:40] um the word of the Lord for this day is
[56:42] our example we can go into the word and
[56:45] show you uh the scriptures are doesn't
[56:48] say very much about a man's dress
[56:51] scripturally but in the Old Testament
[56:54] the priest he had a
[56:57] um very specific garment that they wore
[57:01] when they approached the Lord they had a
[57:02] miter hat they had the outer garment
[57:05] they had the epod and they had the linen
[57:08] the type of material that they wore and
[57:11] these were these were instructed by from
[57:14] God to Moses and and told the men that
[57:19] when they come up to the altar that the
[57:21] clothes that they wore that they
[57:24] wouldn't step up to the altar so that
[57:26] their nakedness would be shown so
[57:29] there's a purpose for the clothing
[57:31] that's to cover you so your nakedness
[57:34] wouldn't be shown and and but the Bible
[57:37] specifically Paul and
[57:40] Peter both go in on the women in the way
[57:44] that they should Adorn themselves and
[57:47] brother B's Ministry we see that was
[57:50] quite heavy as a part of his ministry
[57:53] they talked about him him when he would
[57:55] come he's going to preach against the
[57:58] women's dress because right at the turn
[58:02] of his ministry right around that time
[58:04] the Pentecostal church and the Holiness
[58:06] churches were going through this
[58:08] Challenge on how women should dress is
[58:12] it okay for them now I mean I looked at
[58:15] you go to Lucky Wishbone don't don't go
[58:17] there because it's not good for you to
[58:19] eat that but they have pictures on their
[58:21] wall they're selling chicken here in the
[58:24] city
[58:25] and they all look like
[58:27] Christians they look they're dressed
[58:30] decently but you go look at the
[58:31] customers today they don't look like
[58:33] that what happened and so our churches
[58:37] are supposed to flow with the times out
[58:40] there or should we be consistent with
[58:42] the word that God gave
[58:44] us the word didn't change ain't nothing
[58:47] change but the Styles and the and the
[58:49] powers that are out there and and um and
[58:54] so we just want to be mindful of that
[58:56] God is concerned with the way that we're
[58:58] dressed I want to read this quote for
[59:00] you I'll find it for you cuz it's on my
[59:02] mind and brother Brandon says this
[59:06] here in the
[59:10] message you love the Lord yes
[59:16] amen takes a little more effort to dress
[59:22] up you say I remember my sister one time
[59:25] she had a a birthday party for her son
[59:28] this was years
[59:29] ago and
[59:31] um I came just dress any kind of way I
[59:34] had some sweats or whatever I had on
[59:37] she's like Israel why are you coming to
[59:39] my son's party like that I said I didn't
[59:41] know I had to dress up he says she says
[59:44] you didn't have to dress
[59:47] down I was like okay you got me on that
[59:50] one so so I mean you're you're
[59:52] representing something you're you're in
[59:54] public and and we're representing
[59:57] something what are we rep we're
[59:58] representing Christ that's who we're
[1:00:01] representing let me read this this is in
[1:00:04] the message God being
[1:00:13] misunderstood paragraph 6 62 here some
[1:00:17] time ago a man met me out here aside and
[1:00:20] I had a Pianist here that had a little
[1:00:22] short little skirt and wasn't just
[1:00:25] exactly I guess just right and the lady
[1:00:29] had short hair and she was just a babe
[1:00:32] in this way and she was playing the
[1:00:35] piano and a man met me out there and
[1:00:37] just tearing me to Pieces he says and
[1:00:40] you're a Pentecostal preacher and let
[1:00:42] that woman sit up there that short hair
[1:00:45] and just going on like everything well I
[1:00:48] said I think the woman has a good spirit
[1:00:50] in her I certainly do not agree with
[1:00:54] that you know the skirt part up here the
[1:00:57] two pieces one of them is down here and
[1:01:01] one kind of up here it's a shirt like
[1:01:04] they wear and so it's real thin and
[1:01:07] shows the underneath garment that they
[1:01:09] have around there I don't think that
[1:01:12] should be done I don't like that I
[1:01:14] really don't I can't they they might be
[1:01:18] just as Spirit-filled as anybody else I
[1:01:21] don't know God knows that but I wouldn't
[1:01:25] condemn that woman to say that she was
[1:01:27] going to Hell by the sight the same
[1:01:31] person had in this church a lady who had
[1:01:33] long hair and wore long dresses and had
[1:01:36] a temper enough to fight a buz saw and
[1:01:39] just as mean as she could be now long
[1:01:42] hair long skirts don't take you to
[1:01:44] heaven no sir it's the spirit that's in
[1:01:47] you takes you to heaven but if you as a
[1:01:51] Christian then you should remember that
[1:01:53] many times times pastors pastors don't
[1:01:57] mention those things and the people just
[1:02:00] automatically go on think it's all right
[1:02:03] but a pastor should really tear into
[1:02:06] that and and then the sisters of the
[1:02:09] church those sisters who are in
[1:02:12] character standing wearing their clothes
[1:02:15] neatly they should be examples of
[1:02:18] sweetness and and motherly and sisterly
[1:02:22] like and I think that any woman that's
[1:02:25] motherly and godly and sisterly ought to
[1:02:29] go to such a person and with sweetness
[1:02:32] of the spirit just sit down and talk to
[1:02:35] that lady and if she is of God the holy
[1:02:38] spirit will understand those things and
[1:02:41] she'll correct
[1:02:43] herself but when you real quickly
[1:02:46] condemn her and drive her away you might
[1:02:49] harm that Young born baby see so I
[1:02:52] wouldn't condemn the person
[1:02:55] I like that quote it uh it shows some
[1:02:59] responsibility on the pastor on the
[1:03:01] sisters Elder sisters that are in good
[1:03:04] standings there's a responsibility there
[1:03:07] and there's a responsibility on on those
[1:03:09] of us that we all should you know know
[1:03:13] what the word says about these things
[1:03:16] and you know and brother mam says it
[1:03:17] very well there you know a pastor should
[1:03:19] really tear into that he says pastors
[1:03:22] they don't mention those things and the
[1:03:23] people just automatically go on and they
[1:03:26] think it's all right and so if I don't
[1:03:29] say anything if the ministry doesn't say
[1:03:31] anything then someone can say well no
[1:03:34] one told me that that was wrong well it
[1:03:37] is wrong those things are wrong and I
[1:03:41] think that once we uh let the Holy
[1:03:44] Spirit develop Us in who we are
[1:03:48] serving then what you're wearing will be
[1:03:51] just a small task of of what the Lord is
[1:03:55] trying to do for you in your life as a
[1:03:58] Believer you know we ultimately are here
[1:04:01] to serve him and he's the one that
[1:04:04] called us and we want to be pleasing to
[1:04:07] him by any means
[1:04:09] necessary and you know and a lot of
[1:04:11] times you know I know with us and I say
[1:04:14] us I'm talking about Americans you know
[1:04:17] we don't want anybody controlling us
[1:04:19] telling us what to do especially if you
[1:04:23] tell me I'm going to do the
[1:04:25] opposite it's how the nature of some of
[1:04:27] us are like that that's one of my you
[1:04:30] know I got that part in me some of y'all
[1:04:32] got it
[1:04:33] too but you know at the end of the day
[1:04:36] you got to go back to see what the word
[1:04:37] says and what does the word say and so
[1:04:40] you you want to approach that
[1:04:44] um you know as as the Lord leading you
[1:04:48] and guiding you on these these little
[1:04:52] matters how we dress how how we come to
[1:04:54] the house of the Lord what image are we
[1:04:57] portraying for the outcomer outsider
[1:05:00] what are we what are we um are we
[1:05:03] following as a disciple closely and then
[1:05:07] really is is our life really more
[1:05:11] important than his life and I think that
[1:05:14] once we once the Lord deals with that
[1:05:17] deals with us on those matters and then
[1:05:21] it'll be easier for us to serve him
[1:05:24] as a lamb gives up his rights and these
[1:05:27] things his time and the efforts and the
[1:05:30] things that you that we we have to do
[1:05:33] and you're required you're asked to go a
[1:05:35] mile but but you you know you probably
[1:05:38] should be ready to go too and then
[1:05:41] there's others that need our service and
[1:05:44] our help and we should be willing to be
[1:05:46] a part and be available to that I
[1:05:48] believe that with all of my heart and
[1:05:51] God gives us that I'll read this last
[1:05:53] one here it's a question that we all
[1:05:55] know but I'll read it again it's
[1:05:57] in uh questions and answers and he
[1:06:01] says brother brandom do you teach that
[1:06:04] the bride must not attend any church
[1:06:06] unless you are there preaching or else
[1:06:09] the Tabernacle other words the
[1:06:12] Tabernacle also do you teach that we
[1:06:14] need not keep the Sunday or holy days as
[1:06:18] working fishing or or so forth I say
[1:06:22] that was Sunday look like Sunday to me
[1:06:25] all right at the bottom it look like
[1:06:27] yeah Sundays that what it look
[1:06:30] like no you're mistaken see let me go
[1:06:34] over and just answer it as it come by do
[1:06:37] you teach that the bride must not attend
[1:06:39] any other Church unless you're preaching
[1:06:42] preaching or else otherwise the
[1:06:44] Tabernacle no I don't teach that I don't
[1:06:47] believe that I do not believe it we got
[1:06:50] Minister sitting here that's scattered
[1:06:52] all around through the country country
[1:06:54] and I believe they are part of that
[1:06:57] bride I believe that a man or woman can
[1:07:00] go to church anywhere they want to go
[1:07:02] that teaches the word and I believe if
[1:07:04] they don't teach the whole word and you
[1:07:06] can't go to church any other place where
[1:07:09] they teach the whole word go where they
[1:07:12] teach half the word until you can get to
[1:07:16] where they teach the whole word go to
[1:07:20] church whatever you do do that
[1:07:24] also do you teach that we must not keep
[1:07:27] Sunday or any holy day working or like
[1:07:30] working or fishing on Sunday I believe
[1:07:33] it's a sin to fish and hunt and work on
[1:07:37] Sunday when you can go to church I
[1:07:41] believe your transgressing the laws of
[1:07:43] God is there a commandment to such yes
[1:07:45] sir now in the Old Testament we had a
[1:07:48] type of the Sabbath day and Jesus did
[1:07:51] not come to you to keep Sabbath days the
[1:07:54] old Sabbath day was Saturday which was
[1:07:56] the end of the week Sunday is the Eighth
[1:07:59] Day or the first day of the week which
[1:08:01] Jesus rose on I do not believe it's
[1:08:04] right now if you're way away in the
[1:08:06] wilderness somewhere and you're out
[1:08:08] there on a hunting trip there's no
[1:08:10] church around anything like that there's
[1:08:13] nothing you can do and if you was
[1:08:15] ficient I believe that would be all
[1:08:17] right but if you're around in the city
[1:08:19] around where church is going on you
[1:08:21] should attend church by all means
[1:08:24] somewhere that's right and I believe as
[1:08:27] far as working I believe if the ox is in
[1:08:29] the ditch or something has to be done on
[1:08:32] Sunday you go ahead and do it if it's
[1:08:34] something you couldn't help it had to
[1:08:38] work that way but if you just do it and
[1:08:40] wait till Sunday to do it or just do it
[1:08:43] like that you're wrong see we must not
[1:08:46] do that we must respect that holy
[1:08:49] day
[1:08:52] amen
[1:08:54] so we thank God for his word
[1:08:56] tonight we want to we'll close right
