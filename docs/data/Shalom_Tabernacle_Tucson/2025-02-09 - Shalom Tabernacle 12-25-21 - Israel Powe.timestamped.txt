[0:00] do it'll caner you right keep love I
[0:03] don't care how much people hate you you
[0:05] love them
[0:06] anyhow if you can't do that you need you
[0:09] ain't sealed you got a loose place yet
[0:12] so come on back and get that sealed up
[0:14] right good with the blood of Christ
[0:16] it'll cleanse you from all roots of
[0:18] bitterness yes now see but we're trying
[0:22] again the Pentecostal blessing fell
[0:25] about 19006 somewhere in there there's a
[0:28] minister sitting with us and not a
[0:29] missionary in Tibet one of the I don't
[0:32] sit because it's his presence I hope he
[0:34] didn't go home I think he's still here
[0:35] you go to speak for us a little before I
[0:37] come down and that man remembers the
[0:39] first of Pentecost there wasn't any
[0:42] organization everybody had things in
[0:46] common oh how easy it is to take the
[0:50] wrong step right there and how good it
[0:52] looks to the
[0:54] intellectual look little did Israel know
[0:57] when they stand out there on the bank a
[1:00] shouting now you say this kind of
[1:02] religion is something new watch it's
[1:03] oldest there is am sure even before the
[1:07] world was ever made they were shouting
[1:09] praising God God said so ask job where
[1:12] was he when the the morning Stars sang
[1:14] together and the sons of God shouted for
[1:16] joob that's before the world's ever
[1:18] created but now look at Israel had seen
[1:22] Miracles that's the early Pentecost
[1:24] Israel the Pentecost of that day now
[1:28] they've been brought up out of Egypt God
[1:30] had blessed them give them all kinds of
[1:32] great signs and wonders and deliver them
[1:35] and when they stood up that bank and had
[1:38] a Pentecostal meeting they did now
[1:41] listen Moses sang in the spirit amen
[1:45] amen and Mariam took a tambourine and
[1:47] run down the bank beat this tambourine
[1:49] dancing in the spirit and the daughters
[1:51] of Israel followed her dancing in the
[1:54] spirit if that ain't a Pentecostal
[1:56] meaning i' ever seen one
[2:00] little did they believe that the the
[2:02] promised land was 40 years ahead of them
[2:06] is only about 40
[2:08] miles but it take them 40 years to get
[2:11] 40 miles is because they chose the wrong
[2:15] thing they chose to have a law instead
[2:19] of letting the Holy Spirit lead them the
[2:21] pillar of fire take them on through and
[2:23] lead them they wanted to have something
[2:25] to do themselves they wanted to have
[2:27] certain priests and certain dignitaries
[2:30] a little theology they could fuss about
[2:32] instead of just going on and letting the
[2:33] Holy Ghost lead them they were in the
[2:36] spirit God had provided
[2:38] everything but they had to have
[2:40] something to do into it just like high
[2:41] breeding again let the cow alone let the
[2:45] horse alone let the food
[2:48] alone they science claim and Readers
[2:51] Digest the article of it if they keep on
[2:54] high breeding food and people eats it
[2:55] like chickens they got that poor chicken
[2:57] till they ain't got no wings or legs
[3:00] and if it lays it lays itself death it
[3:02] can only live a year in the tissue So
[3:04] Soft you can't hardly eat it and people
[3:07] eating it is perverting
[3:09] people that's right you know homosexual
[3:13] is on the increase about 40% in the
[3:15] United States over the year
[3:17] ago and did you know that science claims
[3:19] that women are getting wider in the
[3:21] shoulders and Nar in the hips and men
[3:23] are getting Nar on the shoulders and
[3:24] wider in the hips you're eating a
[3:27] perverted seed you're eating perverted
[3:29] HED stuff your body was made to thrive
[3:32] on the natural thing and what's it doing
[3:35] is changing even the natural course of
[3:38] men and women till Hollywood even our
[3:41] government and everything is full of
[3:44] pervs what's he doing they're bringing
[3:46] on themselves by their own tree of
[3:48] knowledge killing themselves go back to
[3:52] the beginning let nature alone let God
[3:55] Alone keep the church and the Holy Ghost
[3:58] and get away from all these Bish
[4:03] go back to where we started at go back
[4:07] Jesus are come I you say I'm a Methodist
[4:10] he'd say it wasn't so from the beginning
[4:12] I'm Presbyterian it wasn't so from the
[4:14] beginning what was that the beginning a
[4:17] Pentecostal experience of the baptism of
[4:19] the Holy Ghost that's where it begin but
[4:23] see we had to perverted oh it makes
[4:25] prettier sure that little church
[4:27] standing out there dancing and shouting
[4:29] and down on the street and people
[4:30] throwing rocks at them making fun out
[4:32] them and everything like that that ain't
[4:33] very pretty now we got the great
[4:36] doxology and the Apostles Creed and oh
[4:39] Dr PhD lld D so and so forth our pastor

[4:50] didn't mean to say that like that see I
[4:52] didn't mean that ain't becoming to
[4:53] servant of God but look all them I just
[4:56] come up on my mind see but stand and say
[4:58] all them different things like that

[54:59] God bless you take the scripture in
[55:02] Genesis chapter
[55:17] 15 in verse number
[55:21] one and the after these things the word
[55:24] of the Lord came to Abram in the vision
[55:26] saying fear not Abram I am thy shield
[55:30] and thy exceeding great
[55:32] reward and Abraham said Lord God what
[55:36] will thou give me seeing I go childless
[55:38] and the steward of my house is this
[55:40] elzer of
[55:44] Damascus and Abraham said behold to
[55:49] me thou has given no seed and lo one
[55:53] born in my house is my Heir behold the
[55:56] word of the Lord came unto him saying
[55:58] this shall not be thine Heir but he that
[56:01] shall come forth out of thy own bowels
[56:05] shall be thine Heir and he brought him
[56:08] forth abroad and said look now towards
[56:12] heaven and tell the Stars if thou be
[56:15] able to number them and he said unto him
[56:17] so shall thy seed be verse six and he
[56:21] believed in the Lord and he counted it
[56:23] to him for righteousness
[56:27] any believers here
[56:29] today and he said unto him I am the
[56:32] Lord I am the Lord that brought thee out
[56:35] of herb the childes to give thee this
[56:38] land to inherit it and he said Lord God
[56:41] whereby shall I know that I shall
[56:43] inherit it he said unto him take me a
[56:46] hepher of three years old a sheot of
[56:48] three years old and a ram of three years
[56:50] old and a turtle dove and a young pigeon
[56:53] and he took unto him all these and
[56:55] divided them in the midst and laid each
[56:58] piece one against another but the birds
[57:01] divided he not and when the fowls came
[57:04] down upon the
[57:06] carcass Abram drove them away and when
[57:09] the son was going down a deep sleep fell
[57:12] upon Abraham and low a horror of great
[57:16] Darkness fell upon him so he puts
[57:19] Abraham to sleep and he's going to show
[57:20] him something verse 13 He said unto
[57:24] Abraham no of assurity
[57:26] that thy seed shall be a stranger in a
[57:29] land that is not theirs and Shall Serve
[57:33] them and they shall afflict them 400
[57:36] years and also that Nation whom they
[57:41] Shall Serve will I judge and afterward
[57:44] shall they come out with great substance
[57:47] and thou shalt go to thy fathers in
[57:49] peace Thou shalt be buried in a good old
[57:53] age and in the fourth generation they
[57:56] shall come hither again for the iniquity
[58:00] of the amorites is not yet full amen so
[58:05] may God add a blessing to the reading of
[58:07] his word we'll take one more scripture I
[58:10] think I have a note here for one more
[58:12] scripture that we need to
[58:15] read thank you for your patience praise
[58:18] the
[58:20] Lord and that is in I believe it's in
[58:23] Leviticus
[58:27] chapter
[58:40] 18 when you have that you can say amen
[58:50] amen in verse one the Lord spake unto
[58:54] Moses saying Speak unto the children of
[58:56] Israel and say unto them I am the Lord
[59:00] your God after the doings of the land of
[59:03] Egypt wherein you dwelt shall you not
[59:07] do and after the doings of the land of
[59:10] Canaan whether I bring you shall you not
[59:15] do neither shall you walk in their
[59:21] ordinances so let us go to the Lord one
[59:24] more time in prayer we're going to speak
[59:27] as we've been on Joshua and Caleb and
[59:29] standing like him we're going to talk a
[59:30] little bit about the iniquity of the
[59:32] amorites just for a moment Lord Jesus we

[1:00:51] the Mesa I like to always remember the
[1:00:54] Carpenter sister Carpenters one of uh
[1:00:57] the oldtime Saints and we are so happy
[1:01:00] that we get the fellowship with those
[1:01:02] Believers there and um we trust the Lord
[1:01:05] will bless each of you this coming
[1:01:07] Saturday or a Saturday coming up
[1:01:10] February the 22nd there in Cedar Hills
[1:01:15] Church in Los cruus New Mexico the
[1:01:17] pastor there brother Pettis Caleb pet
[1:01:21] has invited me to come for a youth
[1:01:22] service there that's on a Saturday we'll
[1:01:25] get that on the bulletin there in the
[1:01:28] back everybody's welcome to be a part of
[1:01:30] that we wanted to uh invite you to be a
[1:01:33] part of that and so God bless each of
[1:01:36] you on
[1:01:39] this particular subject as we've been in
[1:01:43] this thought or the inspiration of
[1:01:48] standing like Caleb and standing with
[1:01:52] Joshua so you got to stand like
[1:01:54] something and then you got got to stand
[1:01:56] with something and if you got this
[1:01:59] balance of how you're standing you'll be
[1:02:03] able to stand in the evil day and as you
[1:02:06] study these two gentlemen how they with
[1:02:09] stod all of the Temptations and the Lord
[1:02:13] kept them alive through all of the
[1:02:16] slavery that they went through the
[1:02:18] trauma that comes with that coming
[1:02:20] through the Wilderness and all the
[1:02:22] miracles signs and wonders of Revival
[1:02:25] the rejection of Moses and at kades
[1:02:27] Baria they still had Grace enough to
[1:02:30] cross over that's right and the Lord
[1:02:33] punished them seemingly by not allowing
[1:02:38] them to go over even though their faith
[1:02:40] was right but the others Faith was not
[1:02:43] right they were ready to go but all the
[1:02:46] Believers were not ready to go and so
[1:02:49] the Lord kept all of Israel out because
[1:02:53] the majority of them did not believe
[1:02:55] believe and did not have faith to cross
[1:02:58] over Jordan into the promised
[1:03:02] land the prophet of God picks this
[1:03:04] Vision up or picks this inspiration up
[1:03:07] and tells us to stand like Joshua and
[1:03:10] Caleb tells us who Joshua is and tells
[1:03:13] us who Caleb is if you know this say
[1:03:16] amen amen yes and so we have something
[1:03:19] that we can go back and look to you know
[1:03:22] God is a god of patterns and patterns
[1:03:24] are made to follow they're not made to
[1:03:27] argue against they're not made to make
[1:03:29] your own it's not made to to make one
[1:03:31] like it a pattern is made to follow God
[1:03:36] told Moses he says make the Tabernacle
[1:03:39] after what after the pattern where's the
[1:03:42] pattern at it's in heaven so the designs
[1:03:47] the instructions of what you're
[1:03:48] following had to come from
[1:03:51] somewhere amen amen and if you're
[1:03:54] following it then you are under the
[1:03:58] inspiration of whoever created or made
[1:04:01] the pattern this right here is a
[1:04:04] pattern and if you follow it you're in
[1:04:07] line with the author who wrote the
[1:04:10] pattern don't try to make your own path
[1:04:12] don't try to do it your own way God has
[1:04:14] already prepared a way for you it's
[1:04:17] written right here amen and as simple as
[1:04:21] that may
[1:04:23] seem as juvenile as that that may seem
[1:04:26] as redone it that may as that may seem
[1:04:29] it's amazing how the human being
[1:04:32] spiritual people people who follow the
[1:04:35] word people who call themselves
[1:04:37] Christians seem to get this Twisted they
[1:04:41] get confused on following the
[1:04:44] instructions and the orders even after
[1:04:47] God has thoroughly Vindicated himself in
[1:04:52] one area he showed the signs wonders and
[1:04:55] miracles to the children of Israel he
[1:04:57] was clearly with them there was a
[1:05:00] picture of the pillar of Fire by day
[1:05:03] there was a pillar of Fire by Night a
[1:05:05] pillar of cloud by day they visibly saw
[1:05:08] it they experienced God on the a
[1:05:12] magnificent level they ate from the
[1:05:14] table of the Lord he rained Mana from
[1:05:17] Heaven he destroyed the armies of their
[1:05:21] their um enemies he opened up the Red
[1:05:23] Sea where does that happen he did all
[1:05:26] these great signs and wonders but still
[1:05:28] that wasn't enough all right that wasn't
[1:05:31] enough to give them Grace to cross over
[1:05:34] and inherit the promised land what an
[1:05:37] example what a warning what a time so
[1:05:42] this
[1:05:43] instruction
[1:05:45] of of Abraham's seed and what they would
[1:05:50] go through the Lord tells them that for
[1:05:55] 400 100
[1:05:56] years they will dwell in this land and
[1:05:59] they will be afflicted by another Nation
[1:06:02] doesn't call the nation by
[1:06:04] name and then it tells them he begins to
[1:06:07] tell them that but I'm going to deliver
[1:06:09] them with a with a strong hand a mighty
[1:06:11] hand doesn't reveal the process doesn't
[1:06:14] reveal Moses's name doesn't get every
[1:06:16] names just tells them this is what I'm
[1:06:18] going to do and here's your timeline
[1:06:21] remember and the five must one of them
[1:06:24] is the time
[1:06:26] and the season and the other two or
[1:06:29] three are wrapped in it's got to be a
[1:06:31] prophet and the prophet's got to be
[1:06:33] Vindicated these are the must in doing
[1:06:36] God a service in doing God's will that's
[1:06:38] not just doing God a service as a
[1:06:40] preacher or a minister that's for mamas
[1:06:42] that's for young people that's for
[1:06:44] everybody that wants to do anything
[1:06:47] towards God you got to run these
[1:06:49] disciplines in your life these five must
[1:06:52] be there did the prophet say it was the
[1:06:55] prophet Propet a Vindicated Prophet is
[1:06:57] it the time is it the season is it the
[1:06:59] person that he said it would be done by
[1:07:01] so here the Lord has given them a time
[1:07:04] frame right that's one piece of this
[1:07:06] puzzle you're going to be afflicted for
[1:07:09] 400 years count them out count out those
[1:07:13] years we're only here 200 years how many
[1:07:15] more years have we
[1:07:18] got we got 200 more years we're halfway
[1:07:21] through it it's Grievious it's hard
[1:07:26] why are we here because great great
[1:07:28] great great great great grandpa saw in a
[1:07:31] vision that we would be here and the
[1:07:35] Lord showed him we' be here 400
[1:07:38] years now that time was extended the
[1:07:41] prophet of God says it went 40 extra
[1:07:44] years the scriptures tells us it was 30
[1:07:46] extra years that they were in that uh
[1:07:50] under that gruesome time now there's two
[1:07:53] reasons why brother random deals with it
[1:07:57] in the message of Third Exodus why he
[1:08:00] delayed their Deliverance why it went
[1:08:02] longer than the 400 years one of the
[1:08:06] reasons was because Israel wasn't
[1:08:10] ready they rejected they complained
[1:08:13] against Moses we see a slight snapshot
[1:08:16] of it when he kills the Egyptian
[1:08:19] remember that and then they said who
[1:08:22] made you you going to kill me like you
[1:08:23] did the Egyptian who made you a ruler
[1:08:25] over that's just a little it looked like
[1:08:27] a nothing but it comes back in
[1:08:31] existence in the
[1:08:33] wilderness and then it grows in
[1:08:36] numbers and then it grows in influence
[1:08:39] it was just a little conversation I was
[1:08:41] trying to help you uh and I actually we
[1:08:45] on the same team and then you flip that
[1:08:47] thing and it's a little little Edge who
[1:08:50] made your ruler over us and it look like
[1:08:53] it's gone I'm gone I leave I'm you know
[1:08:55] you got you call me a murderer and I'm
[1:08:57] out on the backside of the desert and
[1:08:59] that little thing is still there we
[1:09:01] don't see it until many years later you
[1:09:05] know the only way to deal with sin is
[1:09:08] through the
[1:09:09] blood and blood comes through a
[1:09:12] Redemption a process that comes only
[1:09:15] through
[1:09:16] repentance you got to be sorry for your
[1:09:20] sins you got to ask God to forgive you
[1:09:23] of your sins and then that sin is dealt
[1:09:25] with you don't cover it over you don't
[1:09:28] leave it go you don't wait until next
[1:09:30] you know just don't ignore if it's there
[1:09:33] you need to deal with
[1:09:35] it
[1:09:37] amen so this is one of the
[1:09:40] reasons was they wasn't ready they
[1:09:43] resisted against Moses they envied him
[1:09:45] Psalms 106 they rose up not just
[1:09:49] jealousy just like an Envy envious grew
[1:09:52] envious over him and the other reason
[1:09:55] was was this
[1:09:57] iniquity of the
[1:10:01] amorites now the amorites wasn't the
[1:10:04] nation that held them captive the
[1:10:07] amorites wasn't the ones that enslaved
[1:10:10] them but they were a part really it's
[1:10:13] the only name that God mentions to
[1:10:16] Abraham your seed will be afflicted in
[1:10:19] The Strange Land for 400 years and then
[1:10:22] so on and so on but the iniquity because
[1:10:25] the cup of the iniquity of the amorites
[1:10:27] is not yet full is that right is that
[1:10:30] what it says yes in the scripture there
[1:10:32] we just read it and so the Amorite and
[1:10:37] we see in Leviticus that the Lord makes
[1:10:40] it clear that they're not to partake of
[1:10:43] the sins of the land what happens to the
[1:10:46] land is when Sinners live on the land
[1:10:49] they actually cause the land to
[1:10:52] sin they make the land and sinful and so
[1:10:57] this is a key part the amorites are
[1:11:00] doing whatever amorites do that's
[1:11:03] ungodly but they're not in the big
[1:11:06] picture when you're just studying Israel
[1:11:08] we not we don't even know who they are
[1:11:10] we're in Israel we're slaves we're being
[1:11:12] Afflicted we have a promise we're
[1:11:14] waiting for that promise to be fulfilled
[1:11:16] but on the backside wherever the
[1:11:18] amorites are Canaanites and all the evil
[1:11:20] Nations they are doing things too and
[1:11:23] that sin needs to get
[1:11:28] ripe it's not stinky enough
[1:11:31] yet it's bad but ain't bad
[1:11:35] enough when it gets bad enough I'm going
[1:11:37] to make a move this is what God says I
[1:11:40] will make the move when the cup is full
[1:11:43] you think it's bad it is bad but when it
[1:11:47] gets so bad when the cup is full God
[1:11:49] Will Make a Move that's another timing
[1:11:52] element that has to be dealt with amen
[1:11:55] and so we look at this as the Sunday
[1:12:00] School lesson this morning brother
[1:12:02] branam makes this statement here see if
[1:12:04] I can pick it up was in the sueran
[1:12:06] church age in the Sunday school as I was
[1:12:11] putting these together I listened to the
[1:12:13] Sunday school as well in the back there
[1:12:15] it's amazing how many times it coincides
[1:12:18] with the message I'm going to pull it
[1:12:20] out this time subur Church age paragraph
[1:12:22] number 36 now we find out that this
[1:12:25] church Israel as they passed on God had
[1:12:27] fed them and taken care of them and done
[1:12:29] everything for them and finally they
[1:12:31] looked over to the Philistines and the
[1:12:34] amorites and different ones we want a
[1:12:38] king they got something we ain't
[1:12:42] got that's the same thing that people
[1:12:45] does
[1:12:46] today one of these our sisters will look
[1:12:50] over at the television and see Gloria
[1:12:52] Swanson whoever they and some of women
[1:12:55] with certain kind of dress on they just
[1:12:58] can't stand it till they get one brother
[1:13:02] Ram goes on so you know the great the
[1:13:05] three Temptations of a minister and
[1:13:08] Believers is money women and
[1:13:11] popularity the Bible tells us that money
[1:13:14] is the
[1:13:15] root
[1:13:16] of some the Love of Money Right the root
[1:13:21] is the root of what all part of evil no
[1:13:24] they say all all evil the love of money
[1:13:26] is the root of what all all
[1:13:30] evil and then popularity goes right into
[1:13:33] pride and then women as I hard to think
[1:13:37] about that a bit more um it's bad for a
[1:13:41] badly dressed woman to come in our
[1:13:44] presence in our midst it's worse if it's
[1:13:46] a so so-called sister dressed inapo
[1:13:50] inappropriately so on and all the
[1:13:52] brothers you know be careful brother
[1:13:54] there's Temptation and that's a bad
[1:13:56] thing brother to lust after a sister but
[1:13:58] let me ask you this what's worse for
[1:14:01] brothers to lust after one sister or for
[1:14:03] one sister that's bad dressed to
[1:14:06] influence all the other sisters that's
[1:14:09] good yes sir I want you to think about
[1:14:12] that you know that one sister because
[1:14:15] you know we know that sisters today are
[1:14:19] looking good for their
[1:14:23] husbands right
[1:14:26] right don't walk into no trap this
[1:14:28] morning I'm just we're just talking now
[1:14:30] all
[1:14:33] right because every time she's getting
[1:14:35] dressed she's asking her husband how
[1:14:37] does this look how does this look how
[1:14:38] does this look
[1:14:40] right no they don't they don't ask
[1:14:43] that they want husband out of the room I
[1:14:46] need to stay in this mirror longer so
[1:14:48] she can get herself looking pretty for
[1:14:50] who and what if if it's for your husband
[1:14:53] then maybe you should ask your your
[1:14:55] husband how this looks might get quiet
[1:14:59] just a little bit
[1:15:02] today so this money women in popularity
[1:15:05] I'd say to you sisters watching another
[1:15:08] sister could be that Temptation for you
[1:15:11] or soall sister brother random picks it
[1:15:13] up and he says sisters looking at this
[1:15:16] what her name was Gloria whatever and
[1:15:19] then you know that influence begins to
[1:15:22] move
[1:15:23] there and you know when and I and I was
[1:15:27] thinking about this and I'm I'll get
[1:15:29] into the message here in just a minute
[1:15:30] this is the message that I'm bringing
[1:15:32] actually is that you know you you know I
[1:15:36] know it always tightens up when we start
[1:15:38] talking about women's dress all right
[1:15:40] and the worldliness of the world and
[1:15:42] when brother bandam starts talking about
[1:15:44] women cutting their hair and so forth it
[1:15:46] doesn't make me feel any kind of way
[1:15:48] because that's not my cross that's not
[1:15:50] my issue I know it tightens up to you
[1:15:53] sisters like okay how long he going to
[1:15:55] be on this what's he going to talk about
[1:15:57] you know who's doing what and so forth
[1:16:00] and so on but you know for me you know
[1:16:03] where it kind of tightens up for me as a
[1:16:05] minister just being transparent with you
[1:16:07] when brother bam talks about the
[1:16:10] weakness of a pull pit that probably
[1:16:12] don't make none of y'all feel no kind of
[1:16:13] way right who is he talking about when
[1:16:16] he's talking about the weakness of a
[1:16:17] pull
[1:16:19] pit thank you so that makes me feel a
[1:16:22] certain kind of way so then and I'm
[1:16:26] responsible for for for keeping the pull
[1:16:29] pit from becoming weak that's right and
[1:16:34] that happens when we fail to preach the
[1:16:36] whole Council of God from ABCs all the
[1:16:41] way to the Mysteries the whole counsil
[1:16:43] of God don't say brother Israel we know
[1:16:46] that already if we know it we wouldn't
[1:16:48] have these
[1:16:50] problems yes sir
[1:16:53] amen and so
[1:16:55] the prophet gives us a pattern the word
[1:16:57] of the Lord gives us a pattern and this
[1:16:59] iniquity of the amorites we'll see that
[1:17:03] this caused a great stumbling block for
[1:17:06] Israel I'm going to go into the message
[1:17:08] here for a moment in as I was with Moses
[1:17:13] so I'll be with thee remember last week
[1:17:17] we got into Moses a bit and shared how
[1:17:21] brother brandom says um God
[1:17:25] didn't hold you responsible for your
[1:17:29] mistakes paragraph 33 it might be a
[1:17:32] different paragraph I think it's
[1:17:34] different in my book here but he says
[1:17:36] God in as I was with Moses God don't
[1:17:38] hold you responsible for your mistakes
[1:17:41] he holds you responsible for your
[1:17:43] willful sin he that sins willfully after
[1:17:46] he's received the knowledge of the truth
[1:17:49] but a man that's going to do something
[1:17:50] is going to blunder he's going to fall
[1:17:53] he's going to make mistakes
[1:17:55] but if he's really divinely called God
[1:17:57] is in his heart he'll Rise Again used to
[1:18:01] be coming to the church years ago maybe
[1:18:04] they here this morning a man and wife
[1:18:05] they used to sing forgive me Lord and
[1:18:07] try me one more time I'll be yours if
[1:18:10] you'll be mine if I fall if I fail let
[1:18:14] me rise and try again forgive me Lord
[1:18:17] and try me one more time I like that for
[1:18:21] any good soldier is apt to get wounded
[1:18:23] or hurt amen but if he's still a soldier
[1:18:26] and got a purpose something to fight for
[1:18:29] he'll rise and try again any good
[1:18:32] soldier of the Cross will do the same
[1:18:35] thing and that's what I want to
[1:18:37] encourage you this morning if you have
[1:18:41] fallen rise and try again if you made a
[1:18:46] mistake if you said something you should
[1:18:48] not have said if your attitude you
[1:18:51] behaved in the way you should not why
[1:18:53] don't you rise and try again again Lord
[1:18:56] forgive me and give me another chance I
[1:19:00] don't want to be wrong I want to be
[1:19:02] right now I need your help in order to
[1:19:05] be right we all make mistakes we make
[1:19:09] them every day we make mistakes even
[1:19:12] even when we don't want to make we don't
[1:19:14] even know we're making mistakes
[1:19:16] sometimes we make a mistake we don't
[1:19:18] even know it until somebody brings it to
[1:19:20] our attention and say Lord forgive me
[1:19:25] and try me one more time and brother Ram
[1:19:28] goes on he says no matter what Moses
[1:19:30] done it was Moses's office that God
[1:19:33] respected he was a prophet he was above
[1:19:36] all the prophet he was really more than
[1:19:38] any Prophet they'd
[1:19:39] had his own sister laughed at him for
[1:19:42] marry an Ethiopian girl he called them
[1:19:44] together he said don't you fear God if
[1:19:47] there be one among you a spiritual
[1:19:49] profit I'll speak to him in visions and
[1:19:51] make myself known to him in dreams but
[1:19:55] not so with Moses I'll speak lip to ear
[1:19:58] with him don't you fear
[1:20:00] God see and he he goes on and he he
[1:20:04] brings out that it was Moses made
[1:20:07] mistakes but even in all those mistakes
[1:20:10] God was with him yes amen and so when
[1:20:13] he's commissioning Joshua he's telling
[1:20:16] him as I was with Moses and all his
[1:20:20] mistakes I will be with thee and I won't
[1:20:24] leave you H and I won't forsake you you
[1:20:27] just stay with what my servant Moses
[1:20:31] said you know Moses better than anybody
[1:20:34] Joshua you was his right-hand man you
[1:20:37] knew the mistakes that the camp didn't
[1:20:39] know about but I was with Moses and I'll
[1:20:44] be with you only keep the word on your
[1:20:49] lips keep the word before the people
[1:20:53] don't turn to the left or to the right
[1:20:54] stay with that word and I'll stay with
[1:20:57] you that must have made that man feel
[1:21:00] good that had to make this gentleman
[1:21:03] feel
[1:21:05] secure in his position as a Believer he
[1:21:08] don't have to be an Amorite he don't
[1:21:09] have to be a Canaanite he don't have to
[1:21:11] be another kind of soldier he was Joshua
[1:21:14] and God called him to be exactly what he
[1:21:18] wanted him to
[1:21:20] be you know this trouble of trying to
[1:21:23] make yourself something that somebody
[1:21:26] else has or you're unhappy because you
[1:21:30] feel like you should be doing better by
[1:21:34] now or you should have had a more
[1:21:37] accomplished up to this point or you you
[1:21:41] could have you you would you wish you
[1:21:43] would have and you're constantly upset
[1:21:46] and this is where missionary work really
[1:21:48] help you out when you go visit other
[1:21:51] people and what they're happy about what
[1:21:53] they what they go through and so forth
[1:21:56] it really helps you it helps balances
[1:21:59] you that you know what none of us really
[1:22:03] have a space for
[1:22:05] complaint because God has been so good
[1:22:07] to us even if we have a desire to serve
[1:22:11] him even if there's any conviction in
[1:22:14] your heart at all to do what's right the
[1:22:17] grace of God is with
[1:22:19] you and this assurance that Joshua had
[1:22:24] that the Lord was with him brother
[1:22:25] random goes forward and he tells us that
[1:22:29] you know he could actually be
[1:22:32] fearless and in one place he said he can
[1:22:34] be Reckless because he knew that the
[1:22:38] Lord was with him first of all he knew
[1:22:42] that the Lord was with Moses no question
[1:22:45] about that God was with Moses Moses is
[1:22:49] going on and as I was with Moses I will
[1:22:52] be with thee
[1:22:54] let that settle in your heart this
[1:22:56] morning that God is with you the god of
[1:23:00] the Bible the god of the Prophet the god
[1:23:02] of the pillar of fire is with you today
[1:23:06] that's why you're here today that's why
[1:23:09] you heard the message today that's why
[1:23:12] you care that's why you cry that's why
[1:23:17] you ask God to give you the grace to
[1:23:20] cross
[1:23:22] over it's because he is with you
[1:23:26] Hallelujah yes he's with you and the
[1:23:30] prophet of God moves forward paragraph
[1:23:33] 42 and he says
[1:23:36] this I think a minister today that same
[1:23:38] message as I was with Moses I think of a
[1:23:41] minister today that's called of God to
[1:23:43] step into the tracks where Jesus stood
[1:23:46] what a command what a commission but
[1:23:50] each that's called of God is commission
[1:23:53] to stay stand in that same place I'll be
[1:23:57] with you even in you to the end of the
[1:24:01] way each minister is called to stand
[1:24:04] where that with the works that I do
[1:24:08] shall you do also each
[1:24:10] minister is ordained of God is commanded
[1:24:15] to stand in the tracks of Jesus Christ
[1:24:18] and perform the duties that Jesus
[1:24:20] performed that's quite a
[1:24:23] command so we see that this calling this
[1:24:27] command that each minister is called to
[1:24:32] he was with
[1:24:34] Moses he was with
[1:24:36] Joshua now we should have the
[1:24:40] fearlessness in our
[1:24:42] calling that the Lord Is With Us think
[1:24:46] about that for a minute the Lord is with
[1:24:50] you this morning even what you're going
[1:24:53] through even if it's bad even if you
[1:24:55] don't understand even if you can't hear
[1:24:58] his voice like job couldn't get a prayer
[1:25:01] through but the Lord was with him Daniel
[1:25:05] Prayed 21 days no answer from nobody
[1:25:09] nowhere but the Lord was still with him
[1:25:14] amen Lord help
[1:25:17] me Lord help us to get a hold of that
[1:25:22] and know that he is is with us even in
[1:25:26] US
[1:25:28] amen
[1:25:30] yes now Joshua and in all this
[1:25:34] knowing that that command was great but
[1:25:37] having the Assurance he could be
[1:25:40] Fearless he could be as we would call it
[1:25:44] Reckless as long as he was pointed in
[1:25:46] the right way he might break up against
[1:25:49] a hill that would knock him backward but
[1:25:51] he carried the right way was carried the
[1:25:55] right way so can the Church of the
[1:25:57] Living God be Reckless say it with me
[1:26:02] Reckless and
[1:26:05] fearless in faith if we're pointed in
[1:26:08] the right way for he said as I was with
[1:26:11] Moses I'll be with you I'll not fail you
[1:26:14] nor forsake you he never forsaken Moses
[1:26:17] he never fail Moses he will never fail
[1:26:21] Joshua he will never he will not fail l
[1:26:24] he'll be with us so never fail Moses
[1:26:28] never fail Joshua never will fail
[1:26:33] us he never failed me
[1:26:36] yet he never failed me
[1:26:39] yet Jesus Christ never fail me yeah it's
[1:26:43] been 30 years 40 years serving the lord
[1:26:47] he ain't fail me all my life for the
[1:26:50] rest of my life I don't believe he'll
[1:26:52] fail me how many Believers been serving
[1:26:55] the lord for over 20
[1:26:57] years 30 years 40 years how many got the
[1:27:01] testimony can raise your hand over 50
[1:27:03] years he never failed me yet oh praise
[1:27:07] His Wonderful Name Jesus Christ will
[1:27:11] never fail me he didn't fail Moses he
[1:27:15] didn't fail Joshua he won't fail us so I
[1:27:18] love this this example I love this
[1:27:22] inspiration that as Joshua
[1:27:25] was a type of the end time leader a type
[1:27:28] of the Holy Spirit a type of a Ministry
[1:27:30] a type of a True Believer it's a type of
[1:27:34] the holy spirit so what was one of
[1:27:37] Joshua's great commissions his
[1:27:40] commissioned to divide the land to the
[1:27:44] people and he's also commissioned to
[1:27:47] place them where they belong that was
[1:27:50] the commission but before dividing the
[1:27:53] land he had to give them the grace the
[1:27:56] faith the
[1:27:57] leadership for them to cross over
[1:28:00] Jordan now that's what Moses did not do
[1:28:05] that's what Moses could not do this was
[1:28:08] Joshua's job to get the people to cross
[1:28:12] over you know the holy spirit is trying
[1:28:14] to move you
[1:28:16] somewhere yes yes not just coming to
[1:28:20] church not just arguing with people
[1:28:24] we're not better than the other groups
[1:28:26] it has nothing to do with who's better
[1:28:28] than what the holy spirit is trying to
[1:28:31] place me from here to here over into a
[1:28:38] mighty promise that he has already
[1:28:41] promised to give you me and the believer
[1:28:45] the Holy Spirit does that yes he does
[1:28:47] that's what the church service is all

[1:31:58] that call just settling down to sheep
[1:32:01] raising ain't enough for you going to
[1:32:05] some sort of a business is not enough
[1:32:08] for you just to join the church and put
[1:32:10] your name on the book is not enough for
[1:32:13] you because there's something called all

[1:33:24] more than that I believe there's more
[1:33:27] for me I want to see what Jesus did
[1:33:31] manifested in my life the same signs
[1:33:35] that Jesus did the works that I do shall
[1:33:38] who shall you do also even Greater
[1:33:44] Works is that the desire of the believer
[1:33:47] not everybody don't want that some
[1:33:49] people are okay with just church normal
[1:33:52] church as you usual but I want to see an
[1:33:57] outpouring of the Holy
[1:33:59] Ghost I want the Holy Ghost to sweep
[1:34:02] every ow every Pew every heart and just
[1:34:07] sweep sweep through the building and
[1:34:11] Rapture every heart every
[1:34:15] life with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:20] Glory has it happened before yes it's
[1:34:22] happened before I heard it on the tapes
[1:34:26] I see it in the Bible Holy Ghost fell so
[1:34:29] strong one time the
[1:34:31] earthquakes Oh Glory do you want that
[1:34:34] yes amen but what if it messes up your
[1:34:38] hair what if we get out after
[1:34:42] 12:30 that's what I want bro my brother
[1:34:45] that's what I
[1:34:47] desire is an
[1:34:50] outpouring of the Bible Holy Ghost
[1:34:54] to fall on me
[1:34:56] Lord
[1:34:58] amen I want my cup
[1:35:02] overflowing
[1:35:04] amen how many's had some good
[1:35:06] experiences with the
[1:35:07] Lord how many wants that times

[1:35:13] we're not upset what he gave I'm glad
[1:35:15] what he gave us but I want
[1:35:17] more I believe there's more I want a
[1:35:19] double portion I want the anointing that
[1:35:22] Elijah had I want the anointing that's
[1:35:25] on those tapes the anointing that wrote
[1:35:28] this Bible the anointing that we read
[1:35:31] about I want it on me and so the works
[1:35:35] that I do shall he do also now this
[1:35:39] recklessness and this fearlessness let
[1:35:41] me move off this message just for a
[1:35:44] moment even with all the Great Signs the
[1:35:47] Wonders and miracles it wasn't enough to
[1:35:50] keep that group together because they
[1:35:53] saw the signs wonders and miracles
[1:35:55] wasn't enough to give them the strength
[1:35:57] and Faith to have what Joshua and Caleb
[1:36:01] had but interesting Joshua and Caleb
[1:36:05] weren't not the only
[1:36:07] survivors there was other believers
[1:36:10] remember those that were cut off were
[1:36:12] the ones that murmured and complained so
[1:36:14] there no doubt had to be other believers
[1:36:17] that survive that was not put under that
[1:36:20] curse to die in the wilderness because
[1:36:22] they didn't murmur complain and then the
[1:36:24] younger ones the young pups coming up
[1:36:27] they wasn't held
[1:36:28] accountable one of these crossovers is
[1:36:31] this a man by the name of
[1:36:34] Ain remember the sin of Ain the great
[1:36:38] campaign that Joshua crosses over uh
[1:36:41] Jordan in his first campaign he puts the
[1:36:43] word first not the clergy not the people
[1:36:47] not he puts the word first brother bam
[1:36:49] makes that distinction and he crosses
[1:36:51] over during the time when the waters our
[1:36:53] at is fullest he says maybe the
[1:36:56] scientists and the educated people from
[1:36:59] Egypt says no we're from Egypt we're
[1:37:01] scientists we're great men let's wait
[1:37:03] until after spring when the waters come
[1:37:06] down but he says no within three days
[1:37:07] we're crossing over you always have that
[1:37:10] group like well how we going to do that
[1:37:12] we never did that before nobody told who
[1:37:13] told you look who you
[1:37:16] following and he he ran it to a man that
[1:37:21] had his sword drawn he says are you
[1:37:24] Hallelujah are you for us or against us
[1:37:27] right he said I'm sent for I'm the
[1:37:29] captain of the Lord's host I'm with you
[1:37:32] Joshua oh my I'm good then the rest of
[1:37:35] the land is mine I'm good if he's with
[1:37:38] me and Joshua had this assurance that
[1:37:42] God was with him and so he can move
[1:37:44] forward in his inspiration in his vision
[1:37:47] the cross
[1:37:48] over aen was one of them let's take a
[1:37:52] scripture here just for a moment
[1:37:57] in what scripture do I want
[1:38:03] Saints it's in
[1:38:06] Joshua what chapter do I
[1:38:11] want Joshua chapter 7 thanks for
[1:38:18] trying but the children of com Israel
[1:38:21] committed a trespass
[1:38:26] in the accursed thing for aen the son of
[1:38:28] Cari the son of zabid the son of Zur a
[1:38:32] tribe of Judah a notable tribe now this
[1:38:36] tribe of Judah is a tribe that our Lord
[1:38:38] comes through I believe is it Caleb a
[1:38:41] part of the tribe of Judah one of the
[1:38:43] brothers there Joshua or Caleb was a
[1:38:45] part of this same tribe it's a beautiful
[1:38:48] tribe historical the bloodline is clean
[1:38:51] is pure
[1:38:53] uh Rahab eventually marries someone
[1:38:56] through that and and and you know David
[1:38:59] comes through that and our lord Jesus
[1:39:01] comes through that same tribe and so his
[1:39:05] pedigree is pretty good but he is now
[1:39:09] accused of taking the accursed thing or
[1:39:14] things but the Lord when he's condemning
[1:39:18] the sin he's saying to them in the
[1:39:21] plural he says Israel has
[1:39:24] sinned they transgress they have taken
[1:39:29] they have stolen they disassembled that
[1:39:32] word disassembled means they lied they
[1:39:34] deceived they sto and the Lord is
[1:39:37] holding all of Israel guilty of what Ain
[1:39:43] took what did he took he took a
[1:39:45] Babylonian garment which by definition
[1:39:48] would be different than the Hebrew
[1:39:51] garment or Israelite garment
[1:39:54] he took a worldly garment it was the
[1:39:57] accursed
[1:39:58] thing therefore the Lord could not stand
[1:40:03] with them this condition was placed on
[1:40:07] them in verse number 12 let's read it
[1:40:10] there and Joshua rose up early in the
[1:40:11] morning the priest took the Joshua uh 7
[1:40:15] verse2 let's take
[1:40:17] it they've transgressed therefore the
[1:40:20] children of Israel could not stand
[1:40:22] before their enem enemies but turn their
[1:40:24] backs before their enemies because they
[1:40:27] were
[1:40:28] accursed neither will I be with you
[1:40:32] anymore except you destroy the accursed
[1:40:36] from among
[1:40:37] you now there's the
[1:40:41] deal I'm with as I was with Moses I'll
[1:40:44] be with you if you don't have the
[1:40:47] accursed thing among
[1:40:50] you if you keep the accursed thing among
[1:40:53] you you all are
[1:40:55] cursed and when he's inditing them he's
[1:40:58] inditing all of Israel remember they all
[1:41:01] went to battle the Lord saw it all he
[1:41:03] saw what they was doing they getting
[1:41:04] ready we don't need to take everybody
[1:41:06] this is an easy win we only bring a
[1:41:09] second stringers we'll bring the third
[1:41:11] string okay and we won even bring the
[1:41:14] whole
[1:41:15] team save our resources we got this Lord
[1:41:19] Is With Us Joshua's in charge let's go
[1:41:21] take Ai and the Lord let him go do that
[1:41:23] let the process play itself out let the
[1:41:27] sin and all of that happen let that rude
[1:41:30] awakening that people are
[1:41:33] dying what happened Joshua goes to the
[1:41:36] Lord L Lord what's going on the Lord
[1:41:38] says Israel
[1:41:41] sinned they have committed the the sin
[1:41:44] they they've stolen they've
[1:41:46] disassembled they have taken they have
[1:41:49] transgressed therefore they are cursed
[1:41:52] so now Joshua has a tall task of finding
[1:41:55] out where this sin is the Lord could
[1:41:57] have told him exactly the Lord could
[1:42:00] have just laid it out to them go to this
[1:42:02] tent It's s room whatever these are the
[1:42:04] guilty ones go get them the Lord didn't
[1:42:07] do that everybody was involved the whole
[1:42:11] congregation and so is everybody
[1:42:14] involved even today you know these
[1:42:17] little sins we're responsible to one
[1:42:19] another huh huh you say stay out of my
[1:42:22] business uh you are my business I am
[1:42:26] your business you watching me I'm
[1:42:27] watching you
[1:42:28] too and we are the responsibility we
[1:42:31] have the responsibility of each other
[1:42:33] right or wrong the Bible says let the
[1:42:35] Elder sisters do
[1:42:38] what ignore because you want to get on
[1:42:41] their nerves ignore what you see no the
[1:42:43] Bible says you need to go teach
[1:42:49] them did we move into the new church yet
[1:42:51] was
[1:42:54] huh there's a responsibility there and I
[1:42:58] know you see the same things I see some
[1:43:00] of you see more than I can see and there
[1:43:04] is um the accursed thing so this
[1:43:08] accursed thing of the amorites was the
[1:43:12] worldliness was what the other nations
[1:43:15] were already doing it had reached a
[1:43:17] certain Peak and so the Lord had already
[1:43:19] told them don't act like the people that
[1:43:21] you're leaving from and then in the land
[1:43:23] that you're going
[1:43:25] to Y don't take on their gods their
[1:43:29] habits their garments their style of
[1:43:32] dress the way they sing the way they
[1:43:34] worship I don't need to go to no
[1:43:36] denominational praise and worship
[1:43:38] meeting to teach me how to praise the
[1:43:40] Lord I am a believer of the word of the
[1:43:44] most high God I already know how to I
[1:43:47] know how to
[1:43:50] worship following the example of the
[1:43:52] word
[1:43:53] Church following the example of the new
[1:43:57] age conference center
[1:44:01] worship
[1:44:03] amen coffee shop
[1:44:06] worship young people
[1:44:09] centered social
[1:44:13] worship but thank the lord we have a
[1:44:17] message and we can get along and do all
[1:44:20] those things that the world is doing as
[1:44:22] long as we are not listening to the
[1:44:24] message you can't listen to that word
[1:44:27] and you can't be in that word as a
[1:44:29] minister mama or daddy Sunday school
[1:44:31] teacher leader of any kind believer of
[1:44:34] any kind without that word exposing the
[1:44:39] sin of the day the amorites and what
[1:44:41] they're doing amen it's going to bring
[1:44:45] it
[1:44:46] out even if it's a good idea even we
[1:44:48] thought well yeah that sound like a good
[1:44:50] idea let's you know let's let's change
[1:44:51] the way we do this let's you
[1:44:54] know let's get a glass pull pit okay and
[1:44:58] I'm not against a glass pull pit it's
[1:45:00] okay but but why am I getting one well
[1:45:04] they got
[1:45:05] one that's why I'm getting
[1:45:08] one if that's your reason you need to
[1:45:11] stop what you're doing because you're
[1:45:12] looking at something outside of the word
[1:45:14] you want a glass poopy go get one get a
[1:45:16] big one get a little one whatever it's
[1:45:18] not about the material that you're using
[1:45:21] but why are you doing it exactly exactly
[1:45:24] we live amongst the amalekites the
[1:45:26] Canaanites and all the amorites but we
[1:45:29] have a pattern Glory because we got a
[1:45:33] prophet that gave us
[1:45:37] instructions on what and how to follow
[1:45:41] as we're coming through this land Jesus
[1:45:43] praise the Lord somebody amen amen amen
[1:45:47] so let's deal with these amalekites just
[1:45:48] for a moment the prophet of God talks
[1:45:50] about them I have four or five places
[1:45:53] just for a moment
[1:45:55] Lord and he makes
[1:45:58] this he makes this parallel
[1:46:01] with the Joshua in that message as I was
[1:46:05] with Joshua as I was with Moses I'll be
[1:46:07] with thee he makes the this terminology
[1:46:10] a spiritual Joshua he talks about how a
[1:46:13] spiritual Joshua today is and look at
[1:46:15] what he says here SP talking about
[1:46:19] these
[1:46:20] um amalekites in the Third Exodus he
[1:46:24] makes this statement paragraph
[1:46:26] 97 we find out all this has took place
[1:46:30] because waited revivals the methodists
[1:46:33] the Lutheran the Baptist cites and all
[1:46:35] different ones they had a great revivals
[1:46:37] the nazarine pilgrim Holiness
[1:46:38] Pentecostals all had great revivals but
[1:46:40] the great Exodus hasn't come why God
[1:46:46] told Abraham he keep him in the land
[1:46:48] right then but the iniquity of the
[1:46:51] amorites was isn't Yet
[1:46:54] full and God has waited patiently them
[1:46:58] people trying to figure out they can see
[1:47:01] the scriptures run right into something
[1:47:03] run right into something they said this
[1:47:06] is the day this is the time but you fail
[1:47:09] to understand that the iniquity of the
[1:47:13] amorites is not yet
[1:47:16] fulfilled 400 years they would Journey
[1:47:18] down there in
[1:47:20] Egypt be brought out but they stayed 440
[1:47:24] years because of the rejection of the
[1:47:27] Prophet they had to suffer another about
[1:47:29] 40 years down there in the wilderness
[1:47:31] before God brought them out Moses was
[1:47:34] out in the wilderness 40 years before he
[1:47:36] ever returned back to deliver them you
[1:47:38] see 40 years went over time laps because
[1:47:43] they rejected the message so he gives
[1:47:45] two reasons right in the same quote the
[1:47:48] amorites cup wasn't full yet and they
[1:47:51] rejected the message kind of worked
[1:47:53] together there didn't it yes now 40
[1:47:56] years in God's times would be about 1
[1:47:59] half minute our time paragraph number
[1:48:03] 101 he says this same
[1:48:07] message I can get it here
[1:48:09] quickly Third
[1:48:16] Exodus we see it that the people
[1:48:19] themselves can see back down the stream
[1:48:22] of time that the thing is cursed they
[1:48:25] take a wedge of a fine Babylonian
[1:48:28] garment again that's the thing that
[1:48:30] curses among the people when men tries
[1:48:34] to inject his own ideas about
[1:48:39] things it's amorites that's doing that
[1:48:42] that's an Amorite
[1:48:44] anointing injecting his own ideas about
[1:48:48] things brother bam is dealing with it
[1:48:51] and it curs is talking about aen we got
[1:48:53] to stay with that word that's the
[1:48:55] Commandments of God not to touch nothing
[1:48:58] that City that cursed City don't touch
[1:49:01] it leave it alone and aen thought that
[1:49:04] he could take this gold wedge and live a
[1:49:06] pretty decently like the rest of the
[1:49:09] world find Babylonian garment all the
[1:49:12] aans in the camp see but the thing is
[1:49:16] cursed and it continually is cursed it
[1:49:19] was cursed since the very Nia Council
[1:49:22] and and I of Rome been cursed ever since
[1:49:24] but God has let the iniquity fill up
[1:49:27] until the time of the amorites is about
[1:49:33] fulfilled let's go a little bit further
[1:49:35] paragraph 112 all
[1:49:38] right the iniquity wasn't full yet of
[1:49:42] the
[1:49:43] amorites so they had to linger and wait
[1:49:45] before The Exodus but when the amorites
[1:49:48] got their iniquity filled then there
[1:49:50] come a spiritual Exodus or a natural
[1:49:54] Exodus to lead the people to a natural
[1:49:56] land where a natural Amorite had once
[1:49:59] dwelt called that their land and the
[1:50:02] iniquity of the Amorite
[1:50:05] denomination has called themselves the
[1:50:07] church so long till their iniquity is
[1:50:11] about
[1:50:12] fulfilled so we're not talking about
[1:50:14] Sinners and worldly people out there
[1:50:16] we're talking about an Amorite church
[1:50:19] right talking about message churches I
[1:50:22] grapple with this in my mind a few years
[1:50:24] ago and the only term I can come up with
[1:50:26] is worldly message
[1:50:29] churches yeah because they sure don't
[1:50:32] look like you
[1:50:35] know there's been a change the last 40
[1:50:39] years our sisters have changed the
[1:50:42] brothers have changed the churches have
[1:50:44] changed and they continue to change it's
[1:50:45] getting more rapid
[1:50:48] now 114 there's coming in Exodus where
[1:50:51] God will show who is who who where the
[1:50:53] church itself the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:50:55] will be Exodus it out into the land
[1:50:59] that's promised in my father's house are
[1:51:02] many mansions in this place you don't
[1:51:05] have to go there and fight like the they
[1:51:08] did it's already
[1:51:10] prepared if this Earthly Tabernacle
[1:51:12] dwelling be dissolved we have one
[1:51:13] already waiting that where I am there ye
[1:51:17] will be also the great Exodus is at hand
[1:51:22] how many believe that the great Exodus
[1:51:25] is at
[1:51:27] hand drop down just a little bit at
[1:51:29] paragraph 119 there was a pharaoh who
[1:51:32] raised up who did not know
[1:51:35] Joseph and that was the
[1:51:38] beginning of the
[1:51:40] beginning that was the beginning of the
[1:51:44] Exodus and when that thing begin to form
[1:51:47] under a political power begin to form
[1:51:49] God begin to get ready the iniquity of
[1:51:52] the ammonites amorites was F fulfilled
[1:51:56] the time that he promised Abraham was
[1:51:58] fulfilled and the time of
[1:52:02] Deliverance was at hand when you see the
[1:52:05] sin going so
[1:52:08] rampid in the world yes but even in the
[1:52:12] church how do you know the spiritual
[1:52:14] condition of the church what do you look
[1:52:15] at it's Youth Department you look at the
[1:52:18] size of the building do you look at his
[1:52:21] financials do you look at how many
[1:52:22] people are going there do you look at
[1:52:24] the worship service how do you determine
[1:52:27] the spiritual condition of a church huh
[1:52:31] somebody help me preach
[1:52:32] who look at the
[1:52:38] woman that's what the prophet
[1:52:43] said Brothers you have a lovely Church
[1:52:46] oh do I what you looking
[1:52:51] at I ha to get tight like that but if it
[1:52:54] ain't tight it ain't right somebody
[1:53:02] said oky doie the prophet of God moves
[1:53:06] forward shows us that Deliverance is at
[1:53:09] hand can I take a few more Amorite
[1:53:11] quotes to you let me get this to you and
[1:53:14] then I will share what is on my heart
[1:53:17] sometimes when I preach like this and
[1:53:19] I'm getting I'm bearing down to some one
[1:53:20] of the brothers many times the brother
[1:53:23] are comeing brother Israel is everything
[1:53:25] okay
[1:53:28] yes maybe I'm preaching what God put on
[1:53:31] my
[1:53:31] heart maybe it wasn't a fire that I'm
[1:53:34] trying to put out I thought maybe God
[1:53:35] put this on my heart is everything okay
[1:53:38] why are you asking that I should be
[1:53:40] asking you is everything
[1:53:45] okay praise the
[1:53:49] Lord Lord help us
[1:53:53] God doesn't call a man to judge without
[1:53:54] first warning him paragraph
[1:53:57] 1963 the prophet of God says this here
[1:54:02] let's take this
[1:54:05] here save a little time we'll scoot over
[1:54:08] here to paragraph 110 Amos the anointed
[1:54:10] prophet of God he saw the darkness and
[1:54:13] the Judgment he seen Syria come down
[1:54:16] with their chariots and sweep through
[1:54:17] there slaughtered them people out he saw
[1:54:21] it coming and the judge of God upon them
[1:54:23] now 50 years before it happened but you
[1:54:27] see being a prophet he was lifted up
[1:54:29] into the spirit he saw it a far off see
[1:54:32] he saw the cup full before it was filled
[1:54:36] like Abraham God told Abraham your seed
[1:54:40] shall come into this country sojourn
[1:54:42] here for 400 years then I'll bring them
[1:54:45] out with a mighty hand because the
[1:54:46] iniquity of the amorites is not yet
[1:54:50] full see God knew that cup was going to
[1:54:55] fill up he was speaking with his prophet
[1:54:58] he told him now you see that cup of the
[1:55:00] amorites down there see but their
[1:55:03] iniquity is not filled up yet Abraham
[1:55:07] don't say nothing about it now hold off
[1:55:10] but it will come amen and when their
[1:55:13] cups filled up and them 400 years I'll
[1:55:17] drive them out like Locust before you
[1:55:20] and I'll establish your seed here in
[1:55:22] this land amen that's the prophet of the
[1:55:24] Lord now when he speaks of his vision
[1:55:27] whether it's wrath whether it's healing
[1:55:29] it may linger but it's got to come to
[1:55:32] pass if he speaks in the name of the
[1:55:35] Lord see it might be a blessing that he
[1:55:38] speaks for you he might tell you a
[1:55:40] certain thing and you can't see it at
[1:55:43] all you say how can it be he told me
[1:55:46] thus sayeth the Lord this is going to
[1:55:49] happen and that what's was going to
[1:55:51] happen and it ain't happened the man is
[1:55:54] wrong now you'll be judged for
[1:55:57] disbelieving it but it's going to happen
[1:56:01] anyhow see it's got to
[1:56:03] happen though it linger the Bible says
[1:56:06] yet will it speak in its season it'll
[1:56:10] come to pass the prophet's only looking
[1:56:14] off and seeing something he's talking
[1:56:16] about what he's looking at he ain't
[1:56:18] thinking about here and what you look
[1:56:21] like now looking what is going to be and
[1:56:25] when he speaks that if it's in the word
[1:56:27] of the lord it's already been spoke and
[1:56:30] there's nothing in the world can stop it
[1:56:33] you see that's right only God
[1:56:38] himself now the prophet goes on Souls
[1:56:41] that are in prison now also in the
[1:56:43] message the God of this evil age and he
[1:56:45] types the uh amorites with uh the
[1:56:49] spiritual Amor amorites he's talking on
[1:56:51] the spiritual
[1:56:53] side the iniquity going on in our
[1:56:57] assemblies and our
[1:56:58] churches the sin going on in the camp
[1:57:02] the hidden sin the secret sin that's
[1:57:04] causing many to not be healed or the
[1:57:07] church to move forward it's moving
[1:57:10] forward seemingly if the numbers are
[1:57:12] great people were shouting we were happy
[1:57:14] but spiritually speaking is it really
[1:57:16] moving forward these signs that I do
[1:57:20] shall you do also that's right am name
[1:57:22] that cast out devil is anybody receiving
[1:57:24] the Holy
[1:57:25] Ghost is the holy spirit having the
[1:57:27] prence in the servant do you have a love
[1:57:30] for the word like never before that's
[1:57:33] what I would be looking at that's what
[1:57:35] I'd be looking at
[1:57:37] yes
[1:57:40] amen the prophet makes this statement as
[1:57:42] I wrap this message up here the God of
[1:57:45] this evil age he says that's the God of
[1:57:49] this age smart wise scient ific it needs
[1:57:54] no
[1:57:55] faith it don't have to prove anything
[1:57:58] it's already proven by their
[1:58:03] knowledge you think about that a church
[1:58:07] a group of people that need no faith
[1:58:12] because we can go to the doctor anytime
[1:58:14] or I've already studied it out I know it
[1:58:16] can't be how can that be it's all
[1:58:20] intellectual but God said it in his word
[1:58:23] all the Visions God set them on purpose
[1:58:26] they're in his word that's correct amen
[1:58:28] that's correct no vision I we shouldn't
[1:58:31] be I mean the latter years of Visions
[1:58:33] kept coming they they're highlighted
[1:58:35] even more now the time goes on
[1:58:39] sure and we love them don't we yes yeah
[1:58:42] if we don't love them we should love
[1:58:44] them Lord help us amen I have one small
[1:58:48] portion I need to get to and that is
[1:58:52] this last day Vision that the prophet
[1:58:55] had of the
[1:58:56] Bride he has this Vision in July of
[1:59:00] 64 and he details what God sees the
[1:59:05] bride as he sees a clean group clean
[1:59:08] group of people lovely group lovely lady
[1:59:11] clean clean looking bunch they're all
[1:59:13] women now type of the church and then
[1:59:17] there is a gap there he sees the church
[1:59:19] come back again it look horrible
[1:59:22] terrible it was a it was a picture of
[1:59:25] the last day
[1:59:26] church it was twisting the rock and roll
[1:59:29] music it was dressed
[1:59:33] immorally and um it was led by a witch
[1:59:39] that's what he said now these are
[1:59:41] spiritual things you receive them or not
[1:59:44] um I believe they they're they're
[1:59:46] absolutely what we see taking place even
[1:59:49] today absolutely what's going on today
[1:59:52] and if you're not careful you find
[1:59:53] yourself you know wearing the Babylonian
[1:59:56] garments and styles of the world because
[2:00:00] it's
[2:00:01] popular you know we know the scripture
[2:00:04] tells us about a women cutting their
[2:00:07] hair and if you're guilty of that God's
[2:00:10] going to hold that against you and
[2:00:13] that's not you know brother Israel
[2:00:15] didn't see me any a't brother Israel
[2:00:16] didn't write no word I don't have no
[2:00:18] word the Bible said it it's not even
[2:00:23] proper to even pray like you can't even
[2:00:26] pray uncovered and what is uncovered
[2:00:29] uncovered is
[2:00:32] cut it could be sweeping the floor if
[2:00:34] you cut it it's
[2:00:37] short it's not a measuring stick with
[2:00:40] long hair this is long hair this is long
[2:00:42] hair if it's cut it's short okay the
[2:00:46] Commandment is keep the scissors off of
[2:00:48] it but the style of the day is you know
[2:00:51] Style it style it I mean just style it
[2:00:53] you know I got to take care of my ends I
[2:00:55] got to style it and fluff it and do
[2:00:57] whatever you know and that where do we
[2:00:59] get that from go back and look at the
[2:01:01] message people that you have pictures of
[2:01:04] them you see how they look years

[2:05:29] something before it is brought or
[2:05:33] becomes generally generally known and

[2:05:53] of what the bride looks like on both
[2:05:57] sides you tell me if it matters or not
[2:06:00] it does he says this in the message
[2:06:04] paragraph 187 he said I got seven
[2:06:06] minutes to tell you
[2:06:08] something I
[2:06:10] have that happened the day before
[2:06:13] yesterday um it was July the 3rd I was
[2:06:16] over here setting in the center and he
[2:06:19] says I've been in pigal in Rome in
[2:06:21] France I've been in New York City Los
[2:06:24] Angeles but the filthiest bunch of women
[2:06:26] I've ever seen in my life is
[2:06:28] Jeffersonville Indiana I never seen so
[2:06:31] much gum and filth in my life as I see
[2:06:34] amongst them people I sat there till my
[2:06:36] heart ACH and the lord gave me a
[2:06:41] vision he says that he fell into a
[2:06:43] trance and this is what he says here to
[2:06:46] save a little bit of time I'd like you
[2:06:48] to pick this up and get it
[2:06:53] or do I have time to read yes sir
[2:06:55] paragraph 189 he says this here but when
[2:06:59] this bride she was looking the one was
[2:07:01] talking to me I was standing there her
[2:07:04] eyes she was the cleanest sweetest
[2:07:06] looking people I have ever seen in my
[2:07:09] life look like it could have been a
[2:07:12] dozen or more I don't know how many was
[2:07:14] a breast but there's just in a group of
[2:07:17] them and she passed by sweetly with a
[2:07:20] air in her her eyes up watching as she
[2:07:23] passed by oh she was beautiful I looked
[2:07:26] at her and she passed by he said now we
[2:07:30] shall Ru said that's the
[2:07:34] bride and he skips down to paragraph 994
[2:07:37] now here's the interpretation thereof
[2:07:40] now
[2:07:41] remember I just got through writing I I
[2:07:44] I hadn't finished I hadn't wrote these
[2:07:46] notes yet but in preaching this morning
[2:07:48] I caught what it was right in my sermon
[2:07:51] did you notice that the church only came
[2:07:53] in
[2:08:00] view now that's the truth friends the
[2:08:02] heavenly father who writes the word
[2:08:03] knows that I tell the truth see I know I
[2:08:06] just say the truth and not knowing it
[2:08:09] till just a few minutes ago look like or
[2:08:11] just recently see did you notice the
[2:08:13] Bride come in view twice the first seed
[2:08:17] and the second seed both of them exactly
[2:08:19] the same one and the reason they were
[2:08:22] dressed in different parts she'll come
[2:08:24] from All
[2:08:26] Nations it'll make up the bride each one
[2:08:29] had long hair had no
[2:08:33] makeup and real pretty girls and they
[2:08:36] were watching
[2:08:37] me that represented the bride coming out
[2:08:41] of all Nations see she each one
[2:08:46] represented a nation as they March
[2:08:50] perfectly in line with the
[2:08:53] word
[2:08:55] Glory then I have to watch her she'll
[2:08:57] get out of step with that word if I
[2:08:59] don't watch when she is passing by if
[2:09:02] she gets Maybe by maybe it'll be my time
[2:09:05] when I'm oversee when I'm finish or
[2:09:08] whatever it is what they was getting
[2:09:10] back trying their best and was getting
[2:09:12] back just get in line cuz they was
[2:09:15] looking out somewhere else watching
[2:09:18] about that church that just went out
[2:09:20] into chaos
[2:09:22] the front ones never the back ones just
[2:09:24] two or three of them was kind of stepped
[2:09:26] out of
[2:09:28] line bit to the right hand side looked
[2:09:31] like was trying to get back in line as
[2:09:32] they went by they was just past me oh
[2:09:36] far as here to the wall past me and I'm
[2:09:38] standing there then I just seen it all
[2:09:40] move out and leave but you notice the
[2:09:43] church only came into view once each
[2:09:45] Nation the church but the bride came in
[2:09:49] twice see what what it was not knowing
[2:09:52] it but look at it with my message this
[2:09:54] morning not knowing that see the seed
[2:09:57] fell in the ground at n that was the
[2:09:59] original seed she's come through the
[2:10:02] process of these denominations which
[2:10:04] only comes in existence once but the
[2:10:07] bride returns back again in the last
[2:10:11] days I will restore see the master
[2:10:15] pieces brought up that's the reason she
[2:10:17] was in view reviewed the second time she
[2:10:20] was reviewed the first time then she was
[2:10:22] reviewed the second time and she was
[2:10:25] perfectly the second time like she was
[2:10:28] the first time oh God have mercy hurry
[2:10:31] hurry life get in the grain right quick
[2:10:34] uhhuh all others never prayer no more
[2:10:37] they went out never come back again but
[2:10:39] the bride came back cuz she
[2:10:44] was now do a search in your Bible on
[2:10:47] what the Alpha and Omega
[2:10:49] is that's the
[2:10:53] word she was Alpha and
[2:10:57] Omega that's why this word is so
[2:11:00] important to us this is Joshua's
[2:11:02] commission to keep that word in front of
[2:11:04] the people that's where the Perfection
[2:11:06] comes that's the Bride of the Lord Jesus
[2:11:11] Christ and the sin of the
[2:11:13] day and the amorites and the Babylonian
[2:11:17] garments in the worldly flare of today
[2:11:20] brother and sister
[2:11:23] please as the Lord
[2:11:26] Jesus will give you the
[2:11:29] grace to don't
[2:11:32] resent these
[2:11:34] statements and take it and take the Leo
[2:11:38] Dean
[2:11:39] view or that worldly
[2:11:42] atmosphere that is so prevalent
[2:11:46] today the Bride is a clean looking bunch
[2:11:48] of lady she a clean looking bunch
[2:11:52] she doesn't show her form and her shape
[2:11:55] she covers that and if she is married
[2:11:58] and has a husband and he's okay with
[2:12:01] that then something is wrong with him
[2:12:05] yes but many times they I don't know
[2:12:08] maybe some of the sisters are doing this
[2:12:09] at their oral C you should ask your
[2:12:11] husband if this is okay and if that's
[2:12:13] okay then go get it go do it but it's
[2:12:15] still contrary to the word whether
[2:12:17] husband's for it or not the word of the
[2:12:20] Lord is pure it's clean and he's coming
[2:12:23] back for a lovely church and I thank God
[2:12:25] for this
[2:12:27] message because it keeps us clean it
[2:12:30] pushes us to say things that we must say

[2:13:12] reminder this great iniquity that Ain
[2:13:15] was guilty of even under Joshua's
[2:13:19] Ministry he slipped up he got caught up
[2:13:23] and how a true Joshua handled the sin
[2:13:27] properly he got it out of there and
[2:13:30] that's what I want to do Lord I want to

[2:21:59] about brother Wesco and his
[2:22:01] ministry and how like it's probably
[2:22:04] 15 uh 16 years ago it seemed to be the
[2:22:08] growing sentiment they preach Christ
[2:22:10] preach the Bible and then you look at
[2:22:14] some of the people that have turned
[2:22:15] against the message and look what
[2:22:17] they're
[2:22:18] doing it was a strong criticism from
[2:22:21] those that were just playing the
[2:22:23] tapes and this one brother told me he
[2:22:26] said you know the reason why the people
[2:22:29] that are doing that they just play the
[2:22:31] tapes is because they didn't have a good
[2:22:34] five-fold Ministry over them but look at
[2:22:37] the five some of the fivefold ministry
[2:22:39] look what they've done and on both sides
[2:22:42] you see this
[2:22:44] craziness and this disassociation with
[2:22:47] the prophet his message ashamed of it
[2:22:50] whatever but I tell you right now I
[2:22:53] would not be alive today in the word of
[2:22:56] the Lord if it wasn't for this message
[2:22:59] that's why I preach it that's why I
[2:23:00] embrace it that's why it's become a part
[2:23:03] of me and I this is I'm not being a
[2:23:05] hypocrite I'm not trying to throw it off
[2:23:07] on nobody this is this is me this is I
[2:23:12] found my home in the word of the Lord
[2:23:15] and so we thank the Lord thank the Lord
