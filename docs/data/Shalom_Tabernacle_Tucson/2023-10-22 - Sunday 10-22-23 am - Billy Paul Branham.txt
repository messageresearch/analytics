after that ye believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise which which is the earnest of [Music] our are possible only believe only Bel only be for all things are possible only Bel amen you may be seated brother Brandon I stopped there today at down Tucson where I live and I was talking to someone up on top of the mountain looking down I said why do you think that 300 years ago the old papy go come down through there on his Travis with his squa and children sitting on the back rode out there somewhere and live peacefully there was no adultery no whiskey uh no gambling no nothing among them they live clean and the coyote come down the the wash each night through Tucson here howling and the mosqu cactus bloomed around on the banks and Jehovah looked up on it and must have smiled but but the white man come that way and what has he done he's du up the cactus he has polluted the country with deer cans and whiskey bottles he's ruined the morals of the nation the only way he could whip the Indian was kill out his food the Buffalo amen when I was was reading at Tombstone the other day in the the museum and saw the pictures of jonal and many of you might think that jonal was a renegade to me he was a genuine American he was only fighting for that which was right that God had give him a land and a nation and a place to live I don't blame him amen and one of those white soldiers come in there and by for taking over the land and killing them out like a bunch of flies and there was the original picture of jono's uh medical headquarters or his uh hospital it was two or three blankets over a piece of mos them wounded real genuine Americans Indians fighting for their god-given rights and there Jona with a baby of his own on the hips standing there looking upon his own Warriors bleeding dying with no penicillin or nothing no way to help them Jan god-given Americans then call him a renegade I call him a gentleman Coes would have never surrendered he was an old man but the American Army them all dressed in there and they went out there and would kill the Buffalo they run excursions out and sharp invented the Buffalo rifle and they went out there and say oh had a good day today shooting off the side of a of a box car or passenger car so I kill 40 today 40 buffaloes which would have kept the whole tribe of indion two years or more what did they do with them let them lay on the desert they all carrying bloated the lands and stunk the lands the coyotes eat when the Indian killed the Buffalo there was a religious ceremony he took his hoofs saved them to make pans his meat they eat even to the meat on the entral they've taken all of his meat and hung it up and drive it get out of here get back out here and do us and our children the way we did those Indians but remember we sold and now we're going to re amen that's the law of God you know there's a plainy time and then a harvest time I think that uh it's too bad sir now what happened the polluted seed of Adam has polluted and absolutely destroyed the land do you know the Bible says that and because that he has did this the polluted seed of Adam God will destroy them you want to read that I see I got it roll down here turn to Revelations 11th chapter and we'll find out get over in Revelations 11th chapter and we'll see what God said about them who's destroying the Earth the 11th chapter and let's take the 18th verse I believe it is 1118 here we are and the nations were angry and thy wrath is come now watch God's Wrath and the time of the Dead that they should be judged and that thou should us give reward unto thy servants the prophets and to the Saints and to them that fear thy name both small and great and should destroy destroy them which destroy the Earth what they going to do reap what they sow amen sure when you see sin running into the streets how many on this Sunday night how many adulteries will be committed in this city tonight how many women will break their marriage vow and this little hole in the ground here called Jeffersonville how many of bar cases you think are recorded in Chicago in 30 days in between 25 and 30,000 per month besides the ones that's not turned in how much whiskey is Drank In the City of Chicago why do you think happens in Los Angeles in one night how many times has the lord's name been taken in vain in the city of Jeffersonville today is it better now or was it better when George Rogers CLK and to see all that that put on and stuff that they do in our Hollywood wood and all that glamour bunch of drunks and oh my I just think someday someday yeah but remember the Bible has told us in Matthew the 5th chapter that the meek shall inherit the earth that's right the meek and humble will inherit the earth Hallelujah Jesus said blessed are the meek the simple ones and just don't try to be some great big something they shall inherit the earth Jesus said so yes now they polluted it and God will destroy them but the meat will inherit the earth after it's been purified now oh my now the forfeited title deed is now in the hands of the original owner oh mighty God Amen the Mighty God Amen the title deed to the Earth and to eternal life when Adam fared it then Satan's dirty hands cannot take it so it went back to its original owner God himself we're going to find just a minute there he sits on the throne with it in his hand Hallelujah the tile oh that makes me feel religious the title deed to eternal life abstract titled e the eternal life when Adam forfeited for wisdom and instead of faith it went back to the hands of the owner ohmighty God what a great thing all right waiting what's it doing in the hands of God waiting for Redemption claims he made a way of redemption he made a way back and someday the Redeemer is to take it back you see where we're getting to now well once this fell sitting up on the throne all right waiting for Redemption claims it's Redemption what is this book of redemption this title deed Abstract title deed you say abstract what does an abstract mean means it's searched all the way back to its beginning like that little like that little drop of ink this morning when he struck that bleach it went all the way back and when sin has been confessed and fallen into the blood of Jesus Christ oh my it gives an abstract right straight back to the Creator again you become a Son of God Abstract title deed is held in the hands of the almighty oh my its Redemption means all legal possession to all that was lost by Adam and Eve what ought that to do to born again Christian it's legal possession to that abstract deed titled deed of eternal life means that you possess everything that Adam and Eve [Applause] lost what it hallelu Hallelujah the possession of that deed Adam could not meet the requirements of redemption after you found he lost it he had sinned and he separated himself from God was on this side of the CM so he could not uh redeem it he just couldn't do it because he was he needed Redemption himself so he could not do it but the law required a kinsman redeemer the law of God required a kinsman redeemer you want to mark that down kinsman redeemer find it in Leviticus 25 we won't have time to thoroughly search this because you know each each text would make a a night but God's law received a substitute now what if God had not offered to take a subtitute but love constrained him to do it that man was out of way back and there's no way for him to get back he was gone but the grace of God met this kinsman redeemer in the person of Jesus Christ law required it Grace made requirements oh how sweet sound hallelujah hallelujah God's law required an innocent substitute in who was innocent every man had been born sexual after sex everyone and the only one that wasn't had forfeited the rights to eternal life and to be king on the Earth hallu oh think of that scripture for thou has has redeemed us back to God that we may Reign and be Kings and Priests upon the earth oh my what the kinsman [Music] redeemer oh what a story we would have here notice law required a kinsman redeemer to redeem a lost substance Grace met this requirement in the person of Jesus Christ a Kinsman must be born of the human race amen now how could we be when every man that's born has to and anybody couldn't see it was a sex act there he's totally blind CU every man that was born was borned of a woman and God required a kinsman redeemer and he must be a human oh my what he going to do now law required a kinsman redeemer I couldn't take an angel you had to have a man because we're not kin to the angel we're kin to one another the angel never fail he's a different kind of being got a different body he never Sinn or nothing he's a different but the law required a kinsman redeemer and every man on Earth was born of a sex I know what you see that's where it come from that's where sin started amen so you see where it's at now there comes your seat of the serpent in now notice require are a kinsman redeemer and the Redeemer kinsman redeemer must be borned of the human race here that leaves us on a limb but let me sound the trumpet to you the Virgin birth produced the the product the Virgin birth produced our kinsman redeemer none other but the almighty God become [Applause] Emmanuel Emmanuel the kinsman redeemer was met you see how God makes a requirement and there's nothing we can do but then Grace steps in and overshadows that law and produces the product Oh when you get over home when I get my little cabin down there brother nille sings about when you all hear something down there one morning sing amazing in Grace How Sweet the Sound the saved the r like me you say praise God old brother Brandon made it there he is yes hallelujah oh it's Grace that taught my heart to it was Grace my fears relieved how precious did that Grace appear they are our first believe wait till we get down to it just in a moment oh my now we look the The Book of Ruth gives a beautiful picture of this how boy has and neom had lost his State you you know you hear me preach on having you raise your hands up if you heard me preach it so you understand see ohaz had to become a redeemer and he was the only one that could he had to be a Kinsman a near Kinsman in redeeming Nom he got Ruth that was Jesus Boaz typing Christ and when he redeem Israel he got the Gentile bride with SE so very beautiful well we have it on tape I'm sure here somewhere you like to have it now notice now he must be kinman so you see an angel couldn't do it a man couldn't do it it must be a man but he can't be born of a woman a sex act so the Virgin birth the Holy Spirit overshadowed Mary therefore Jesus was not a Jew Jesus was not a gentile Jesus was God exactly his blood didn't come from any sex act amen he was the Holy created blood of God and we're not saved by Jewish blood neither are we saved by Gentile blood we're saved by the blood of God that's according to the Bible it says so we're saved by so you see Jesus was God he was not no third person fourth person second person he was the person he was God see he was God Emmanuel God come down from his glory revealed himself I love that story of boo cver that great beautiful hm down from his glory ever living story my God and savior came and Jesus was his name born in a manger to his own a stranger a man of sorrow tears and Agony oh what condensation W he house Redemption when in the dead of night not one faint hope in sight God precious tender laid aside his Splendor stooping to woo and save my soul oh how I love him how I adore him my breath my sunshine my all and all the great Redeemer became my savior the great creator became my savior and all God's fullness dwelleth in him that's the one met the requirement Grace produced the person of Jesus Christ and we find this book now God stretched his tent come from God to become a man he changed his stream from the almighty to be a man to take on the form of man so he could die to redeem man wait till we see him when there's nobody Worthy [Music] h [Music] oh [Music] a [Music] h [Music] oh [Music] and mercy shall follow me all the days all the

the um when love projects and I it was just teaching me about different life situations just saying instead of sometimes arguing things over and if you project love God can come on the scene and take care of the situation for you so I thought of this song 10,000 angels and uh I hope it's a blessing to [Music] you they bound the hands of Jesus in the garden where he prayed they led him through the street in shame they spat upon their savior so pure and free from sin they said crucify him he to bless he could have called 10,000 angels to destroy the world and set him free he could have called 10,000 angels but he Di [Music] alone for you and me upon his precious [Music] head they placed a crown of thorns they left and said behold the king they struck him and they cursed him and mocked His holy name all alone he suffered [Music] everything he could have called 10,000 a angels to destroy the world and set him free he could have called 10,000 Ang Angels but he died [Music] alone for you and me [Music] when they nailed him to the Cross his mother stood nearby he said woman Behold thy son he cried I thirst for water but they gave gave him none to drink then the sinful work of man was done he could have called 10,000 angels to destroy the whole world and set him free [Music] he could have called 10,000 Angel but he died alone for you and me to the howling mob he yielded he did not for Mercy cry the cross of Shame he took alone when he cried it is finished he gave himself to die salvation wonderous plan was done he could have called 10,000 angels to destroy the world and set him free he could have called 10,000 angels but he died alone for you and me he died [Music] alone for you and [Applause] amen we were told that brother clever had a song this morning and so Joy was practicing that one I'd practiced one with her before and I thought well brother clever's singing then I'll I'll save it to tonight but the last verse of the song that that he uh just sang for us said when he cried it is finished salvation's wondrous work was done and was the song that joy and I had been practicing was it is finished and I just thought you know what I want to sing that this morning just feel impressed that sir as a finished work at Calvary whatever we have need of and so just trust that this is a blessing to you worship with me this morning as we sing there's a line that's been drawn Through the Ages and on that line stands in Old Rugged Cross and on that cross a battle is Raging amen for the gain of man's Soul or is loss on one side March the forces of evil all the demons all the Devils of hell and on the other the angels of glory and they mean on Go Go's [Laughter] he the Earth shakes with the force of the conflict and and the sun refuses to shine for there hangs God's son in the balance and then through the darkness he cries it is finished the battle is over it is finished there will be no more war it is finished the end of the conflict it is finished and Jes Jesus is Lord yet in my heart a battle was raging not all prisoners of War had come home you see they were battlefields of my own making I didn't know that the war had been one but then I heard that the king of the ages oh he had fought all those battles for me oh and victory victory was mine for the claim me and now praise His name I am free it is finished the Battle Is Over yes it is finished there will be no more war it is finished the end of the conflict it is finished and Jesus is Lord it is finished and Jesus is Lord can we just stand and give him a praise offering this morning

Africa so he had texted me and asked me if I could take the service this morning introduce the tape earlier the the Sunday school and now uh the regular service um brother Israel asked that we would commemorate brother Billy Paul yes by playing a testimony yes that he gave so anybody who was ever around brother Billy Paul knows what a precious brother he was am he's going to be dearly missed and

is taking me [Music] hunting okay Tam [Music] Becky Sarah and Joseph we all grew up in that Fishbowl and you know after they'd leave daddy would you know he he he just had a way he could do it in the right way and I'd get in trouble and he wouldn't just say Billy I'm going to whoop you good he just had his way of saying things and if you listen real close to the message he got real things to say to you too amen yes sir okay you asked me to come I come I'm going to unload the whole load on you this morning so you hear that message and you say woo he's really pounding on me say thank you Lord just go back and check it with the word you'll see it's right so he' come there and those kids would go there and get me in trouble all the time dream and when he did he said Billy uh when brother Cree leaves uh you and I got to go uh get some wood well he thought bless brother Billy ain't him and brother Brandon really close he's going to take him out and bring some wood in uh-uh that's not what he was saying the wood was on the backside you know what I mean so we just like you Joel I know you all been how many you's been to Still Waters just look at that isn't that stand up look how many kids come to still one amen thank you how many was in July camp in Still Waters oh this last July the first first one I me was the 18year old on them okay out of that camp come the cop boy from Colorado he came he played the same games that you played he ate the same food that you ate two boys one went home with a blessing the other one refused I got a letter last week and says pray for my boy he says all I want to do is blaspheme cuz I have no hope of being saved don't never let Satan tell you that the couet boy in Colorado just as soon as he went home he got on his mopat to go run an errand for his parents and he got killed but he was filled with the Holy Ghost he K the other boy went home and said I want to blaspheme because I can't live it and I don't believe it they both went to the same camp slep in the same DM you slep in one eternal life and the other one refused what was your meeting this weekend kids yeah choices yes sir you love me yes voices amen what you decide this weekend determine your Eternal salvation amen choose you this day whom you will serve we go home we we just like you Daddy would take us out did did you enjoy the trivia the other day Yes W I'm glad you did I'm glad you enjoyed it thank you I just felt I wanted to do that for you cuz Daddy he'd love to take us and give us question and answer and we'd take out we he'd take us for a ride out in the country he'd ask us questions you know and as we did you know the things begin to happen and and I was the oldest so I was the smartest no that's not right but anyway anyway if if you answer them right you got to get of ice cream if you didn't answer right you didn't get nothing and if you got all of them right you got a double dip it didn't bother daddy one bit if you didn't know the answer and if Mom and Dad ask you a question it doesn't matter whether you can answer or not but if they tell you the answer brother Ben ask you the second time you was in trouble so be sure and listen real careful to what the tape say only what the tape say and Mom and Dad will tell you the truth because they are predestinated to do that you love brother Paul yeah you love your pastor yes sir kids your mama is your pastor at home amen she's your pastor she'll tell you the truth so stay true to that word don't compromise on it one bit we just eat breakfast there one morning I'm sorry it was lunch we sat at the table and I had Brother Joseph Becky and Sarah well you know we're just kids so daddy say Okay Sarah you pray and so Sarah looked over that food and was having leftovers he he I'm he had a lot of wisdom he knew I didn't like you know leftovers so he asked Sarah to pray she looked over the table she says no daddy said what he says pray Sarah she said I prayed over this yesterday so see we was just like you okay Joe come in one day and this lady live next door and her name was you can laugh at some and she laughed and this lady come in her name was Mrs May Lois knows her real well but I like she delivered our children one of our children and so she lived next door to Daddy but she wasn't a Christian here she come boy she was upset she come chopping in the house like that and she says and she says I want to see Reverend Brown mom said well he's in the study I'll go get him so she went back here and she said Miss May wants to see you and he said okay so I come out he said I'm Miss May said what can I do for her and she says I just had Joseph over at my house he was about well he wasn't as big as Luke there just a little smaller than said he was over at my house and said he told me that you called me a witch he said Miss mom go get Joe so she goes over and she gets Joe and she brought out and Daddy I thought oh boy I'm going to watch this he's going to get a thump and you know and so she brought him in there and he said he says Joe Miss May said that you called me a witch he said you did Jad said Joseph you know I didn't do that you sure did he said where she he said Sunday at the church he said I didn't call him miss me a witch he said yes you did he said what do you mean he said you said any woman that puts on her clothes like that is nothing but a witch he said miss me I said that so see we was just like you Becky oh man her and George Oh Daddy wouldn't let the phones be tied up so they had a little signal between them at 7:00 where they sat their watches at they would go and Becky take your phone and you could just follow this card and see where she's at and she'd go in there and she go and she go in the closet and you just start pulling that card and you'd find Becky sitting in the closet oh hello George the phone wouldn't even ring they had to pick it up at a certain time they could talk to each other kids are smarter than what you think Mom and Dad you see we was just like you but you know what I wouldn't take nothing for that you got Christian parents you should be so thankful amen that's your heritage yes when I was just a young boy I started traveling with my dad now I'm going to get into the testimony and I'm going try my best to be done here in three hours but as I begin the travel my dad would tell me just like you hear the tapes and you hear your mother and dad tell you different things but until you have until you have a personal experience with Jesus Christ it's just words yes you've got to be borned again when I was 12 years old how old are you Luke eight I was a little bit older than Luke probably not as big but I was but anyway my dad I'd hear him talk about the angel and I love to tell this part of my testimony and I know every one of you heard it but I'm just going to tell it to you again I'd hear my date talk about the angel and brother bam not only preached your a message but he lived your a message he was a poor man he wasn't rich man no he wasn't a rich man at all and he'd stay in the cheapest of Hotel he'd eat less food and have us to so it wouldn't be hard on you for the expenses of the meetings he not only preached your message but he lived your message we stay in this little hotel in velia Illinois and I was about 12 years old and he woke me up one morning and I I wasn't giving out prayer cards in I was just a little bit long bigger than Luke there but I was selling three little books one was called I was not disobedient to heavenly vision Divine Healing in the brandom campaigns Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I had a little nail apron I'd have it around me had nickels dimes and quarters and there I thought I was something and I'd go down and I'd give you you sell you books before the meeting start and the tent meetings when I come home that night my dad was sleeping in a bed right here I was next to my dad and my uncle Donnie was in the bed next to me was all in the same bed never even had a bathroom in the hotel room we had to go down the hall to use a bathroom and over on a corner in the about back by the window there was a table and I don't know if you know what I'm talking about it it had Lis what you call them things you pour the picture you know picture water and things that's where we wash Daddy he said he had a pillow across my face and he said Paul I said yes sir he said you know the angel that Daddy talks about I said yes he said he's here he said he's in the room right now and he said he visited me tonight and told me about the meetings what to do he said I ask him if I could wake you and my uncle up Donnie and he said you can wake up Billy that don't make me no more than you or anybody else but it was just what the grace of God to me he said you can wake up Billy he said I want him to see you he said when Daddy takes the pillow from your eyes he said you look over where that war spacing is and there stands the angel that I told you about well I thought it'd be something you know that you see pictures of you know flying it was a man dressed in a white Rob had hair down to his shoulders 200 lb or so he had his arms folded like that and all he do would just move his head back and forth and keep his eye on Daddy it scared me to death you say it wouldn't scare me you just haven't seen you there was a reverence I can't tell you about but he says he sent from the presence of God and I grabbed my daddy I was scared to death he said Paul he won't harm you he said I asked him if he could see you he never spoke a word to me or today Daddy but I'll never forget his eyes just looking back and forth at Daddy back and forth and I held on to my daddy and he clutched me up and he went from that being like a man in that room out that window before he went he just went into like a Mist like a vapor and he disappeared out the window and when he left a rainbow at 3:00 in the morning come and stood in that room from that day to this day I can tell you when he's there I might have been in Africa India anywhere I'd be Daddy call the prayer line and I'd be working the prayer line down there getting the people lined up and I could tell you exactly when he was near before brother Brandon would even say you know what I'm waiting on you've heard him say on the table I'm waiting for him I could tell that he wasn't there and just as soon as he'd come I I knew it I could feel it Daddy said he's here now am I've been a blessed man not only am I a child of God but I'm a son of a prophet and I'm a brother of a prophet how much greater could a man ask so young people when you feel that when you feel that little nudge that's him yield to it sir what he says you do you never question one thing on that tape lady come to me one time and she says brother Billy no I'm sorry she wrote me a letter she says I heard you give a testimony about bu devil I said yeah she says the devil come to me and said he' scar me to death said he' talk to me you don't believe that the devil can talk and he lies all the time yeah you know when he lies when he opens his mouth but he said he would scare me to death that nervousness and said finally one day I just bucked up against him she says devil she says you frightened me all of my life and she says I want to ask you a question said did you ever hear of the Prophet William Brandon and said that devil didn't say a thing she said answer me the devil wouldn't say a thing she said in the name of Jesus Christ answer me he said that thing spoke and said he's cast me into hell many times and she said I want to tell you something I'm a Believer in every word he said and you leave me and never bother me again she said boo devil and said he's never come back again so just when he comes at you right poo Devil he's not your conqueror you're his conquer through Jesus Christ just don't be scared to know who you are I seen my daddy like I said he was a poor man and I'm going to get into my testimony now I'm going to be done here shortly but he got into when he went out to started meetings right here he come through Canada in the early 40s brother cook just talked about his father-in-law the different ones he never even had a suit that's right honey he borrowed a suit from his brother to go out and he had a hole here in his pocket on the side of my mom my mom went down and I don't know what you call them but it's an iron iron on thing that you do and he ho so he could hide that pocket and he'd hold his hand like this and he'd go up and shake hands with the preachers they all had dressed nice and he said I I'll shake you with my left hand he said cuz it's closer to my heart he had his right hand hand hide in that patch but I'm a witness to you this morning I seen seen him walking into the auditoriums thousands of people tens of thousands of people remember I'm not a like I am now not old man I was a kid and I've seen people like you on stretchers wheelchairs CS everything just to get a glimpse of it he was a Jesus man they saw Jesus in Brother Brad and they knew if they could just touch that ragged coat they' be healed so who are we who are we the greatest of all give his all that we might have what we have today eternal life don't never let it become common to you I love you but like I said I may never get to see you again but it's true I've seen people I've seen people just when he walked in just walk in the auditorium and I'd have him by the arm leading him in I seen people just stand up out of the wheelchairs push the wheelchairs back I see them come off the Cs I've seen mothers pass their babies down through hundreds and thousands of people just to get him to touch that baby am not even knowing if they'd get that baby back but they knew that God was in that man am so do you know that God was in that man I saw the Redeemer live Liv in a redeemed one I don't worship him but I glorify the God that was in I may not understand it but I believe it and I don't compromise I'm not want to be no smile like but I don't compromise on nothing to do that my job was to pass out prayer cards to get him in and out of the meeting what a privilege you say oh I wished I had no you don't want that job no it was was a wonderful job I don't mean that I see him in the prayer line he'd always bring the people from this side and I'd bring the people up and set them in a chair and he'd say watch me watch me and I see him he' go like this you seen him on the film and I knew then he was getting numb he didn't know what he was where he was at and I'd have the prayer line well I'd stop the prayer line cuz I knew it was time to go get him and I'll tell you some testimonies that I saw but I'm talking about my job now okay my job was to get him in and out to get you up there to be prayed for just to stand before him and I've seen him I se him start doing this be getting a little weak and I'd stop the prayer line and he knew when he didn't see no one in that chair he might not even see me but when no one was in that chair then he knew it was time to to quit because sometimes didn't know worri is at and I'd leave and come over and I touch him on his side put my arms around him what privileg that anointing was so strong it didn't make any difference if I had a headache a toothache in that presence everything left amen and I touch him on his side like his brother Paul and if he was talking to you maybe calling people out in the audience and I touch him like that if he didn't answer me back I'd pick him up and take him off the platform but he sometimes he'd touch me back the people didn't know but he'd be saying Paul leave me alone I know what I'm doing yeah then he'd make an ALT to call whatever you say well that's no it's not because one time time I take him out too early I thought it was time to take him I thought I was doing my job right and I take him too quick and he'd say Paul if you just left me a little longer I could have prayed for some more oh as a kid 14 years old so I took him too quick then maybe the next night I take him too early next night I take let him stay too long then he said Paul you let me stay too long he said don't give my prayer CS tomorrow night because I don't have strength to pray for the people don't feel sorry for me but it's a hard life yeah it was a wonderful life I said Daddy why why did the Lord let me see that angel he said because you were called to work work with me son I heard a tape the other day not to brother Billy go I don't even deserve stand before you I'm not trying to be humble I'm just pouring my heart out to you he said he said if it hadn't been for Billy he said I would have been an insan institution long

being that was ever photographed don't let it become common to you brother brandom said a man looked at that picture and laughed and he said it was nothing less than to blaspheme the Holy Ghost that's

poker table I don't like even I'm just I'm being honest with you around this big poker table when he was around this poker table the dealer was sitting there and he said Son out the door he said you can't play here he said this is a private game well the guy that owned the place I'm sorry to say this he said oh yeah he can play he said he said he he said he plays up here all the time he said he said that's rever Brandon's son that dealer looked at me and he says are you rever Brandon's boy I said no sir I said R Brandon wouldn't have a boy like me said no sir I walked out of that pool room and I'd already left home my dad before I left home he said Son don't do that he said don't go down that road I said Daddy I want to see what it's like that's what the devil talks to you I had no experience he said Son don't leave home I said Daddy I respect you too much to stay home I left and went to live with my grandmother I got in that pool room I could not identify him that kind of a life he said Son before you leave will you do me a favor and I said okay I'm going be brother Brandon you be Billy he said give me your hands no not like that I said what do you mean Daddy he said give me your hands raise your hands out Billy raise them out I said yes he said turn around on the wall he said see right there he said that's a cross he said you're standing right here today he said this road leads to Heaven this road leads to hell he said all Daddy can do is tell you don't go that road he said but you got to make the choice what's our theme choices make your choice I said Daddy I choose to go that road he said no matter where it leads you son he said I can't compromise on this word I can't make you live it but Daddy will always be your friend and I'll always be your buddy but you can't work with me no more it's all over you can't live that kind of life and be like that he said but just remember this when your so-called friends down here are so good to you he said remember Daddy's here praying for you and somewhere along the way he's going to turn you around and bring you here because I claim you under the [Applause] token I made that choice I went that way don't listen to his lies don't listen you got to have an experience with Jesus Christ I walked out I started Liv with my grandma I done all those things that the devil told me I never had tried I tried it there everyone wrong but at that time I thought I was something I went to church one Sunday and I sat in the back row Joseph s on a very back row cuz I was ashamed guess what preached Return of the prodical son everything he said I was guilty of that fingers you know what I'm talking about yes everything that he said was poting to me the Lord began to speak to me go to the altar I refused

him so I got up and left I didn't make no scene I just got up and left church and walked out about a week later Daddy called me kind of like I was kiding Tim about hunting I like to fish just as much

Warriors of the faith you're here today you're here today by the grace of God Amen but because of their faith yes and they're placing the token over their families amen don't go that route It's A Hard Road but if you do choose that route can I read a quote brother Paul the 12th chapter of First Corinthians says by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body and become members of that body and then it's not what I've done what I am who I was or nothing about it it's what God has done for me in Christ Jesus amen we are perfected with our sacrifice thank you Lord he makes no mistakes he would not bring you in if you wasn't Worthy none of you see what I see when he talked to me I listen continue he wouldn't bring you in if you wasn't worthy he knows your heart that's exactly right he knows who you are what you are he knows your every motive he knows who you are and what you are but there's traps set along the way for you along that road the devil this is Brother BR mhm the devil will cause you to stumble and fall yes he does and you say I didn't mean to do that God you know I didn't listen you're still perfect amen because there's a perfect blood offered for you every day and a bleeding sacrifice hanging there before the Throne of almighty God you know it because it's God's foration for this gospel is delivered it's called the good news and this morning a't that strange yes and this

like well brother Chuck calls me up to pray at the end I guess I'll say it but the uh the day brother really passed my dad called me up at 6 o00 in the morning tells me a little testimony and I'll share that with you here uh now but my dad had just started preaching and had some really good services and was feeling really good about himself you know and you know had some really really really just special services there and um even I think probably at the tuon Tabernacle as well and so he got a little you know full of Pride he said and and then he preached some more sermons after that and he just said it was just you know you could hear a pin drop sometimes there's no amens and this that and it like I said this is at the beginning of his ministry so kind of Hur his confidence and he was feeling pretty pretty down and he uh brother Gustavo was a pastor there in no Galis and he had asked him to come back you know even after those services that maybe didn't go weren't as exciting or and uh my dad kept putting it off kept putting it off and brother Gustavo would ask him you know can you come now can you come now and he put him off for about three or four weeks dad said and finally dad just said okay you know I'll come so we go this you know that that one weekend we end up going to Nogales son there to preach and um Dad says you know they're all gathered up front greeting each other and whatnot and said this uh van pulls up parks at the house right next door and uh sure enough it's brother Billy Paul and uh brother Jerry Amal along and some brothers from Canada come out and they're they're visiting so now dad sees that and he's like oh man he's like and he even you know he even asked brother Gustavo he's like you sure brother you don't want to have them you know one of them speak or you know and uh you know but brother gust is like no no no you're going to preach you're going to preach so they go back you know and service starts and dad said he remembers being back waiting in the office here and he say you know obviously they had seen the visitors walk in so everybody wanted to sing everybody had a testimony you know so one after the other was singing a special or whatnot and he said by the time he got to preach dad said he was prayed up in that back office you know he was and he he just he said he remembered like as he before he walked out he's like Lord I don't ever want to go and stand behind that sacred desk without you with me oh God I want you speak speaking through me he's like this is nothing of me am you know this is all you Lord and dad said you know what I was there too I would have been 10 or 12 but he preached that morning and power of God came down and people were blessed and it was a wonderful service I'm almost done here after service we go to this Steakhouse we'd always go there in noala Sonora and uh we eat brother Billy Paul tells that same testimony about the little girl's eyes forming there you know the blue eyes brother brandom stopping what color eyes you want sweetie and you know they he so they remembered that and dad said he you know was kind of towards the end of the meal there and Dad gets up to go use restroom as he comes back he notice everybody's left he leaves a tip on the table and he's walking out he said as he's walking out he just noticed he's right behind brother Billy what a coincidence right but he's he's happens to be right behind him and they're they get to the door brother really stops sees my dad and he he looks over at my dad he shakes his hand he's like brother he's like I know the presence of God and I was here this morning he's like there was a young man in front of me he's like I didn't understand much you know it's all in Spanish he's like but I you said something and he just he just fell to the ground just praying and praise the Lord my dad said he's like Bobby you don't understand that's somebody who was on all these meetings like that that I mean he he knew the presence of God you know even even said that there and he's like that was something that you know as it happens and then he's thinking on it he's like Lord who am I that you would send the prophet's son to say something like that and you he Lord knew it was going through my dad's mind and all those things and you know he's like just what a what a blessing you know what a what a God we served just a thing like that my dad you know he was he was just you know blessed by it so he's like what a he's brother Billy Paul played a special part in his ministry you know there little loose of confidence there but I just thought I'd share that with youall let's bow our heads father God we're so grateful Lord we just even from the beginning of this service Lord 10,000 angels you could have
