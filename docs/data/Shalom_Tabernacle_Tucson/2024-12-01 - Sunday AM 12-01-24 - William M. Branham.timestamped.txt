[2:24] be you may be seated brother brenon
[2:31] now now
[3:20] 30 miles off the coast of Asia Minor in
[3:24] the a
[3:25] ageny just oppos of the Church of
[3:28] philadelph the church of Ephesus where
[3:31] the first message was given where John
[3:33] was pastor at that time in other words
[3:35] look right back to the east he's looking
[3:37] right straight at his church amen from
[3:39] where he was at and the first message
[3:40] was to his church that represented a
[3:42] church age all right the vision was
[3:46] given to St John the
[3:48] Divine who was the pastor of the church
[3:50] at Ephesus at that time what condition
[3:53] then was this is where was it what
[3:56] condition all right it's not in history
[3:59] as a Rocky Island full of serpents
[4:01] scorpins lizards and so forth it's 30 Mi
[4:05] around it and full of rocks it was used
[4:08] in the days of
[4:10] John as a
[4:13] Alcatraz a place where the Roman uh
[4:16] emperor empire Exile criminals real bad
[4:21] criminals that they couldn't keep them
[4:23] in jail and so forth they put him out
[4:25] there on that island to die let them
[4:28] stay there until they were dead
[4:32] question the reason why John was there a
[4:35] Godly Man a righteous man a man of good
[4:39] reputation good character never in
[4:41] trouble why was this man there the Bible
[4:44] said for the word of God and the
[4:46] testimony of Jesus
[4:48] Christ now we got the
[4:51] setting the aisle of patmas in the a
[4:55] agenc 30 Mi off the coast approximately
[4:59] 30 m Around It Rocky full of lizards and
[5:01] scarpins and so forth and used for a
[5:04] prison house like Alcatraz is to get a
[5:07] prisoner they can't keep in prison here
[5:09] they so such a horrible criminal they
[5:11] put him out on Alcatraz and now they
[5:14] took this Saed John the Divine the last
[5:17] of the disciples and the only one who
[5:21] died a natural death John before going
[5:24] to the island was accused of being a
[5:27] witch
[5:31] and was boiled in a bat of grease for 24
[5:35] hours without scotching
[5:38] amen
[5:39] hallelujah glory to God you can't borrow
[5:42] the holy ghost out of a person
[5:47] Hallelujah B him for 24 hours in a bad
[5:50] of Grease without any harm and said the
[5:54] reason the the Romans give that he was a
[5:57] witch and bewitched the Greece
[6:00] [Applause]
[6:01] what the carnal mind can think of now
[6:04] you see when they call us mind readers
[6:05] and fortune tellers and BLB you see
[6:07] where the old Spirit come from but you
[6:10] see where the real Spirit come
[6:11] from it's the church
[6:14] age 24 hours bored him in hot bubbling
[6:18] grease and never even touched him
[6:21] hallelujah oh how God gting in him with
[6:24] his holy spirit his work wasn't finished
[6:27] they put him on the aisle for two years
[6:29] years and while God had him out there
[6:31] alone to himself he wrote the Book of
[6:34] Revelations as the angel of the Lord
[6:36] revealed it to him and then as soon as
[6:38] that was over he come back to Homeland
[6:40] and passed to the church in Ephesus and
[6:43] died and was buried in
[6:45] Ephesus John the Divine oh what a
[6:48] setting
[6:50] now all
[6:51] right the church stand under John or
[6:55] under great persecution John writes the
[6:58] ninth verse I John who also am your
[7:02] brother in tribula and companion in
[7:04] tribulations and in the kingdom and in
[7:08] the patience of Jesus Christ was in the
[7:10] aisle that is called patmas for the word
[7:13] of God and for the testimony of Jesus
[7:16] Christ in other words he took the word
[7:19] of God and was proving it that was a
[7:22] word of God and Christ came back through
[7:24] him and testified that he was right am
[7:27] amen there you are God's word being made
[7:31] manifest in him proving that he was
[7:34] God's servant then they couldn't deny
[7:36] that so they had to tell him that he was
[7:37] a witch he Bewitched the grease and
[7:39] wouldn't hurt him and he Bewitched the
[7:41] people and they wasn't healed and he was
[7:43] a fortune teller that couldn't uh some
[7:45] kind of a bad person ill spir a foul
[7:48] spirit and that's the reason they uh put
[7:50] him out there thought he was dangerous
[7:52] to be amongst the society but he was
[7:55] only carrying out the will of God and
[7:58] God had a under all that condition he
[8:01] could not use him and all the
[8:03] persecutions and things because the
[8:04] Saints is coming Oh Brother John what
[8:06] will we do about this and what would he
[8:08] do John was a prophet we know that and
[8:10] so they were asking these questions so
[8:12] God just had the Roman Empire to pick
[8:14] him up and set him out there on the is
[8:15] and said now come on John I want to show
[8:17] you something that's going to happen the
[8:19] last of the Apostles there was no more
[8:21] to write it but John so they set him out
[8:23] on the aisle of patmas from 95 until
[8:27] 1896 and he wrote it and he said I am
[8:30] your brother and companion in
[8:33] tribulations now I didn't speak of the
[8:35] Great Tribulation that was not the Great
[8:37] Tribulation and does not come to the
[8:39] church the Great Tribulation comes to
[8:41] the Jews not to the church so it wasn't
[8:44] the tribulation the Great Tribulation
[8:47] now the 10th
[8:48] verse I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[8:53] day and heard behind me the voice of a
[8:56] trumpet I was in the spirit on the
[9:00] Lord's
[9:01] day now you can't do any good until
[9:05] first you get in the
[9:06] spirit God can't use you
[9:09] Hallelujah your your all your efforts
[9:12] are are in vain until first you do it in
[9:14] the
[9:15] spirit if I will sing I will sing in the
[9:18] spirit if I'll pray said Paul I'll pray
[9:21] in the spirit amen and then if there is
[9:24] anything that comes to me it's any good
[9:26] it has to be revealed to me by the
[9:28] spirit and confirmed by the word made
[9:31] manifest by the results it Bears now
[9:34] like other words if I say Jesus Christ
[9:37] promised in his word that if I would
[9:40] repent be baptized in the name of Jesus
[9:42] Christ I shall receive the gift of the
[9:44] Holy Ghost the first thing we do is
[9:45] repent it's revealed to me that that's
[9:47] truth and be baptized in the name of
[9:49] Jesus Christ then the result is I
[9:52] receive the Holy Ghost if I'm sick and
[9:54] he promised me if I would believe and I
[9:57] have the Elders of the church anoint me
[9:59] to pray over me the prayer of Fai shall
[10:00] save the SI Lord I believe I follow your
[10:03] instructions an elder prays over me an
[10:05] me all that settles it just go on it's
[10:08] all over say you don't feel any
[10:10] difference though Jesus wasn't born when
[10:13] God slay him before the foundation of
[10:15] world when he was he was the Lamb of God
[10:17] slain before the foundation of the world
[10:19] but in God's own mind he was already
[10:22] done I wasn't here than neither neither
[10:24] was you but in God's book if our names
[10:27] is ever on there it was put on before
[10:29] the foundation of the
[10:31] world When God says anything a has to
[10:33] take place so when you meet God's
[10:35] qualifications just remember God will
[10:37] manifest itself and take care of the
[10:38] rest of it you just go ahead as a
[10:40] finished work oh isn't that wonderful oh
[10:43] my than just tell God God said you do
[10:45] this and I'll do this well if I go do
[10:47] this he's got to do that now the devil
[10:49] say see he delays that don't make any
[10:51] difference Daniel Prayed one time and it
[10:53] was 21 days before the angel ever got to
[10:55] him but he wasn't discouraged he know
[10:56] he'd come anyhow so he just waited till
[10:58] he got there
[10:59] that's joh hallelujah oh that's when
[11:02] you're getting Faith now we have to get
[11:03] off of that we'd have a healing service
[11:05] right quick
[11:06] wouldn't yeah a faith but we want a soul
[11:09] healing service to heal the inside
[11:11] because that is what's going to last you
[11:15] get eternal life eternal life does not
[11:17] vanish or grow old it stays Remains the
[11:20] Same now he got in the spirit before
[11:23] anything took place the first thing he
[11:26] did he was in the aisle called pacas all
[11:28] these things that he did and he said I
[11:30] Heard a Voice and all these other things
[11:32] but before anything took place he was in
[11:35] the spirit and if you notice that in
[11:36] your Bible big Capital Spirit holy
[11:40] spirit amen he got in the
[11:44] spirit oh I just think that's wonderful
[11:48] I was in the spirit on the large day on
[11:51] what day the large day now there's a big
[11:55] discussion let's just quieten at this
[11:56] for a
[11:57] minute now as we said this morning some
[12:01] said at the revelation of St Matthew 17
[12:04] was uh Peter the Catholic Church said he
[12:06] built his church up on Peter he was the
[12:09] first pope how could have been a pope
[12:11] been married see and it said Peter went
[12:14] with Rome is buried over there and to
[12:16] tell me one place history already where
[12:18] Peter ever went to
[12:19] Rome Paul did but not Peter all right so
[12:22] we find out at all these isms and things
[12:24] that just crept up see but and people
[12:28] today are everywhere you go they some
[12:31] great church has got a certain nail that
[12:32] was in his hand you know how many nails
[12:34] they got authentic nails today that was
[12:37] 19 they got bones they got they got
[12:41] pieces of robes and touch and handling
[12:43] we don't we don't have those things we
[12:45] don't need
[12:47] that Christ is alive he's in us not some
[12:51] nail or piece of cross or piece of bone
[12:54] or something he's the Living God living
[12:56] in us now manifesting himself oh yeah
[12:59] Hallelujah we only have one article of a
[13:02] memorial that's the Lord's Supper
[13:04] commemoration of his death but as far
[13:07] Christ himself he is with us and in us
[13:10] and that's the thing that we want to
[13:11] wave the glory of the Holy Spirit to the
[13:13] world wave it until the light goes out
[13:17] all right now the um so you see we tuck
[13:22] that other side of the road you know
[13:25] I've always tried to be this and our the
[13:27] Lord has always revealed it to me
[13:28] there's one extreme and another extreme
[13:31] but right in the middle of the road lays
[13:32] a truth did you notice Isaiah where he
[13:36] said that there shall be a highway
[13:37] Isaiah 35 and you remember how our
[13:40] precious Nazarene Brethren used to sing
[13:42] that song you know uh the Highway of
[13:45] Holiness Highway of Holiness now if you
[13:48] read their Bible right it doesn't say
[13:50] the Highway of
[13:51] Holiness it said there shall be a
[13:53] highway and a w amen and it shall be
[13:57] called not the Highway of Holiness but
[13:58] the way of
[14:01] Holiness and there a conjunction that
[14:04] finishes your sentence see it shall be a
[14:07] highway and a way and it shall be called
[14:11] a way of Holiness not a Highway of
[14:14] Holiness see a Road's built a way a good
[14:17] road is built highest Parts in the
[14:19] center because it lets all the trash
[14:21] wash off to both
[14:23] sides that's it when a man really comes
[14:25] to Christ he's got his eyes centered on
[14:27] Christ if he's a little bit emotional
[14:29] he'll be a fanatic if he's a little bit
[14:31] cold he'll get on this other side and be
[14:33] just a cucumber over on that side see is
[14:37] intellectual but the main thing is right
[14:39] in the middle of the road with enough
[14:41] spirit in you to keep you warm and
[14:42] moving amen and knowing enough to keep
[14:45] yourself under obedience to the spirit
[14:47] and move just as the spirit moves not
[14:49] till or not after just as the spirit
[14:51] moves the Catholic Church said the
[14:53] Revelation was Peter the Protestant
[14:56] Church said it was Christ but the Bible
[14:59] teaches it was the
[15:00] Revelation that he gave God gave him our
[15:04] Christ th Christ the son of the Living
[15:06] God blessed Simon son of Jonas flesh and
[15:09] blood is not revealed this to you no man
[15:11] Seminary or Monastery anything taught it
[15:14] to you but my Father which is in heaven
[15:16] has revealed this to you you're a Peter
[15:19] Upon This Rock I'll build my church and
[15:21] the gates of hell can't Prevail against
[15:23] it now we come to another place here
[15:26] where you get two different ideas I may
[15:28] be wrong if I am God forgive me but I'm
[15:31] going to disagree with the 7 Day
[15:33] Adventist that says that it was the
[15:34] seventh day he was in the Lord's Day the
[15:38] 7day advent's Brethren and many of them
[15:39] claim that it was the Sabbath day that
[15:41] he called the Lord's Day the Christian
[15:44] Church calls it the Lord's Day the
[15:47] Sunday the first day and we noticed a
[15:50] lot of times that at the Christian
[15:51] church yet today the Protestant people
[15:53] refer to it as the Lord's day Sunday
[15:56] that is not scriptural Sunday was the
[15:58] first day of the a week in the Bible not
[16:00] the large day and neither was it the
[16:03] seventh day Sabbath it would be
[16:05] impossible for it to be either one of
[16:06] those days because it taken John two
[16:09] years to write the
[16:13] Revelation which they was there be many
[16:15] of those uh seventh days and first days
[16:18] Passover the Bible the Revelation is
[16:20] wrote from 80 95 to 96 two years it was
[16:24] the large day the large day is exactly
[16:27] what it said and that's what it was John
[16:29] was carried in the spirit over into the
[16:31] Lord's day this is the day of man but
[16:35] the day of the Lord shall come Amen on
[16:37] down through the scriptures we'll find
[16:38] that he was in the large day caught up
[16:40] in the spirit and taken over to the
[16:42] large's
[16:44] day right amen see he was in the large
[16:48] day the Bible speaks of the large day
[16:50] we'll get to it in a little bit the many
[16:52] scriptures the first thing the Sabbath
[16:55] day as we talk about it the Sabbath day
[16:57] is not keeping a certain day we have no
[17:01] commandment to keep Saturday for a
[17:02] Sabbath we have no commandment to keep
[17:04] the first day for a Sabbath in the New
[17:06] Testament the Bible said in Hebrews the
[17:08] 4th chapter if Jesus would have given
[17:10] them rest would have not had would spoke
[17:11] of another day right but there remains a
[17:15] rest or Sabbath keeping to the people of
[17:17] God for we who believe to have entered
[17:19] into his rest we cease from our works
[17:22] like God did from his
[17:25] watch praise the Lord I just gets a
[17:28] feeling so good good I get ahead of
[17:30] myself notice in the Sabbath day God
[17:34] made the Earth in six days and the
[17:36] seventh day he entered into arrest and
[17:38] never returned no more to build any more
[17:42] worlds then he gave it to the people as
[17:44] a memorial because you couldn't keep it
[17:46] now because when you keep the Sabbath
[17:48] year the other side of the world is
[17:49] Sunday then again see so it showed it
[17:51] for a people of space and time for
[17:53] Israel but then there remains a Sabbath
[17:56] keeping for the people of God for we
[17:59] which believe to enter into his
[18:02] rest allthough the works I'm quoting
[18:04] Hebrews the 4th chapter although the
[18:07] works was finished from the foundation
[18:08] world for he spoke in a certain place on
[18:10] this wise the seventh day and again he
[18:13] limited a certain day saying in David
[18:15] you put it down Hebrews 4 um again he
[18:18] limited a certain day saying in David to
[18:20] a day after so long a time that is heard
[18:22] when you or said when you hear his voice
[18:24] Harden not your heart for if Jesus would
[18:28] have given them rest day would he not
[18:30] after to spoke of another day but there
[18:33] remaineth a rest or Sabbath keeping the
[18:36] word rest Sabbath is a strange word to
[18:38] us which means rest it's a Hebrew word
[18:40] which means a rest day a Sabbath day
[18:42] don't work rest for Jesus would have
[18:45] given them rest would he not have spoken
[18:46] of another day but there remaineth a
[18:48] rest or Sabbath keeping to the people of
[18:50] God for we which have entered into his
[18:53] rest we cease from our works like God
[18:55] did from his we never turn back to it on
[18:57] the next day of the week and heart again
[18:59] we've entered into AR rest Jesus
[19:01] speaking on the Beatitudes she said
[19:03] you've heard them say of the old time
[19:04] Thou shalt not kill I say un you who's
[19:07] ever angry with his brother without a CA
[19:08] is killed already you've heard say them
[19:11] of Old Times Thou shalt not commit
[19:12] adultery that's the Commandment but I
[19:14] said to you whoever looks upon a woman
[19:16] to lust after her has committed adultery
[19:18] already with her in his heart is that
[19:20] right so all these things were memorials
[19:23] just signs wonders waiting for the real
[19:27] time to come now when Jesus finish that
[19:29] Matthew 11 the beatitude he said come
[19:32] unto me all ye that are laboring tired
[19:37] and are heavy laden and I will give you
[19:40] rest unto your
[19:41] souls take my yoke upon me and learn of
[19:44] me for I'm meek and lowly is that right
[19:47] come unto me all yet labor and heavy
[19:49] laden and I'll give you rest to your
[19:52] soul if you've labored one day 10 days 5
[19:56] years 35 years 50 years 90 years
[19:59] and you're tired and weary come unto me
[20:01] I'll give you rest I'll take all that
[20:04] load of sin off of you and enter into
[20:06] you and give you perfect rest and
[20:08] satisfaction amen now what is that rest
[20:12] let's just settle this just a little bit
[20:13] see what some of them said why you go
[20:14] John Church no you put your name on the
[20:17] book no certain kind of water baptisms
[20:20] no let's just settle it and see what it
[20:22] is would you like to do that right here
[20:24] while we're waiting we see where John
[20:25] went over into what kind of a day did he
[20:27] go to when Jesus died upon Earth and his
[20:30] work was finished he entered
[20:32] somewhere now let's go back to Isaiah
[20:35] the 28th chapter and the 8th verse I
[20:37] believe it is now Isaiah 288 and let's
[20:42] read Isaiah 28 the prophet speaking 712
[20:47] years before it happened now how many
[20:49] would like to know what the true Sabbath
[20:50] is the true rest is here it
[20:54] is now here's where the Prophet spoke it
[20:56] and I'll show you where it come to pass
[20:58] watch Isaiah 288 for all the prophet
[21:02] prophesying of these days for all tables

[21:08] taking communion that smokes and drinks
[21:09] and lies and steals so that there is no
[21:12] clean Place who shall he teach knowledge
[21:15] who Could you teach knowledge today how
[21:17] many heard Billy gaham today it was a
[21:19] wonderful sermon he preached on how that
[21:21] a people could believe a lie just keep
[21:22] on in that line and even justify
[21:25] themselves and think that they were
[21:26] doing what was right the American public
[21:28] uh taking he said it and saying a wise
[21:31] man's filter and a smoking man's
[21:33] cigarette taking a one of the a devil's
[21:36] lies and instead of making him a fool
[21:38] whatever he is to smoke such a thing and
[21:40] try to make him a wise man he's a fool
[21:42] to even smoke it when the when it's full
[21:44] of death and cancer and everything else
[21:46] and still he Puffs it down his
[21:48] lungs he's a fool not a not a a wise
[21:51] man's filter there is no such a thing a
[21:54] wise man don't use the
[21:55] stuff there's no life unless it's a
[21:58] ndles 92 or something like that there's
[22:00] no life outside of
[22:01] Christ that's the real true life what
[22:04] makes men and women drink that stuff
[22:06] because you're trying to satisfy that
[22:08] thirst in there that God putting their
[22:10] thirst after him and they're trying to
[22:11] satisfy it with the things of the world
[22:14] that's the reason we have those things
[22:15] that's the reason people act like that
[22:17] because they're trying to quench that
[22:18] thirst that's in them for God and the
[22:20] devil's giving them death instead of
[22:22] Life all tables are full of vomit the
[22:24] clergymen everything else speak of it's

[22:28] there's no such a thing Whom Shall he
[22:30] teach knowledge and to whom shall he
[22:32] make understand
[22:34] Doctrine then that are wean from the
[22:37] milk and drawn from the breast now we're

[23:29] and begin to speak with other tongues
[23:31] and the Holy Ghost tuck their lives over
[23:33] and cease from their worldly things then
[23:37] they entered into a rest with Christ
[23:40] Paul said in Hebrews the fourth chapter
[23:42] we which have entered into his rest has
[23:45] ceased from our worldly doings as God
[23:48] did on the day of his creation he

[1:00:57] whatevers let's make yourself at home
[1:00:59] and comfortable as we hear this precious
[1:01:02] word this morning God bless
[1:01:06] you
[1:01:09] now now
[1:01:11] tonight I want to call your attention to
[1:01:15] a portion of God's word found in the
[1:01:19] fourth chapter of St Luke the 4th
[1:01:24] chapter and the 16th verse it will begin
[1:01:27] Jesus speaking this day is this word
[1:01:31] fulfilled in your ears
[1:01:35] now we want to draw from that a
[1:01:40] conclusion of how
[1:01:43] Dynamic is the word of God now we all
[1:01:48] can figure out the
[1:01:50] mechanics but it takes a Dynamics to
[1:01:54] make it work
[1:01:56] we can figure out what the mechanics of
[1:01:59] a
[1:02:00] machine automobile but then it takes the
[1:02:05] Dynamics to make the wheels go to
[1:02:08] operating and moving now Jesus had
[1:02:13] returned to to Nazareth where he was
[1:02:16] brought up on down in the scriptures
[1:02:19] here we find that they said we heard you
[1:02:22] did such and such over capernium
[1:02:26] now let us see you do it here in your
[1:02:28] own country Jesus said uh a prophet is
[1:02:32] not without honor except in his own
[1:02:34] country and of course that's where
[1:02:36] you're brought up at and where people
[1:02:39] know you and there he had a a a bad name
[1:02:42] to begin with by him being born without
[1:02:47] an Earthly father they called him an
[1:02:49] illegitimate child that Mary was
[1:02:52] actually pregnant before uh she married
[1:02:56] officially Joseph but that isn't so we
[1:02:59] know it isn't so and on this scripture
[1:03:04] what caused me to fall My Eyes Upon This
[1:03:08] was something that happened just
[1:03:12] recently in Phoenix
[1:03:14] Arizona it was the last day of the
[1:03:17] service that I was to speak at the
[1:03:19] International Convention of the Full
[1:03:21] Gospel businessman and in this
[1:03:24] convention there was a visitor with us
[1:03:27] which was um Catholic bishop which is uh
[1:03:34] is uh of the childing rights of the
[1:03:38] apostolic Catholic Church the most
[1:03:41] reverent John S Stanley
[1:03:45] OSD um he is the Archbishop of
[1:03:49] Metropolitan United States in the
[1:03:52] Catholic church this had to be his card
[1:03:55] and his and his address and he was a
[1:04:02] visitor uh with the Christian
[1:04:04] businessman and I had seen there the day
[1:04:07] before and when I was speaking on
[1:04:10] Saturday night I believe it was or
[1:04:12] Saturday morning at the
[1:04:14] breakfast and I as I was speaking he uh
[1:04:19] kept watching me I thought that man
[1:04:22] certainly is disagreeing with everything
[1:04:25] I saying and um you know you could you
[1:04:28] could just see me keep his head up and
[1:04:30] down but I didn't know what was just
[1:04:32] exactly working on him so on Sunday
[1:04:35] afternoon when I got up to
[1:04:38] speak I was going to take my text on
[1:04:42] birth pains where Jesus said that as a
[1:04:46] woman intervail with a
[1:04:49] child she's travailing in
[1:04:51] birth and uh so I was going to speak
[1:04:55] from there as birth pains the subject
[1:04:58] saying that the world is in birth pains
[1:05:02] now the old has to be done away with so
[1:05:06] the new can be born just like a a seed
[1:05:09] has to rot away in order to give New
[1:05:11] Life how the pains birth pain struck um
[1:05:17] the world in World War
[1:05:19] I she had a terrific pain because he had
[1:05:24] poison gas and so forth that almost
[1:05:26] could destroy the world and in World War
[1:05:30] II she struck another harder pain they
[1:05:33] had Blockbusters and also an atomic bomb
[1:05:38] she cannot stand another labor pain with
[1:05:41] these missiles and things today one more
[1:05:43] war will throw her out into space for
[1:05:46] she will now be delivered and there will
[1:05:49] be a new Earth the Bible said there will
[1:05:52] be under every prophet's message Israel
[1:05:56] got a birth pain because that these
[1:05:59] prophets that come on the scene after
[1:06:01] the theologians and clergymen would have
[1:06:03] the church all in Organization for him
[1:06:05] and when that prophets come on the scene
[1:06:07] with thus sayeth the Lord they Shu them
[1:06:10] churches and she had a birth pain
[1:06:12] finally she had birth Plains flown up
[1:06:15] until she delivered a son of the Gospel
[1:06:18] which was the word itself made flesh so
[1:06:22] the church really is in birth pains
[1:06:24] tonight uh again for the Deliverance of
[1:06:28] the son son of God to come again all of
[1:06:31] our theologians all of our systems all
[1:06:33] of our denominations have rotted right
[1:06:35] out from under us so we are in birth
[1:06:38] pain and a message from God always
[1:06:41] stores the church in heavier pain but
[1:06:43] after a while she's going to be
[1:06:45] delivered of a
[1:06:46] bride that will bring forth Jesus Christ
[1:06:49] to his bride and then thinking this man
[1:06:52] had disagree with me so much when I
[1:06:55] raised up to speak this message I turned
[1:06:59] in my Bible to find the page and my wife
[1:07:02] had just given me a new Bible for
[1:07:04] Christmas my old Bible is about 15 years
[1:07:06] old and the thing was just about tore to
[1:07:09] Pieces the pages every time it open up
[1:07:11] and fly out of it and but I know just
[1:07:14] where to find every scripture so I
[1:07:17] studied Post in that Bible and I just
[1:07:20] picked up the new one because doesn't
[1:07:22] looks a ragged to go to church with and
[1:07:24] when I started to to turn over in St
[1:07:26] John where the scripture was found I
[1:07:29] started to read the 16th chapter and the
[1:07:33] verse that I was looking for wasn't
[1:07:36] there so I thought strange I turned back
[1:07:40] again still it wasn't there and brother
[1:07:43] Jack Moore from streetport Louisiana a
[1:07:46] bosom friend of mine he was sitting
[1:07:48] there I said brother jack isn't that
[1:07:50] found in St John 16 he said yes and this
[1:07:54] Catholic priest
[1:07:56] got up out of his seat from about a 100
[1:07:58] clergymen sitting on the platform walked
[1:08:01] over close to me with all of his robes
[1:08:03] and gowns and crosses and so forth and
[1:08:06] got right up close to me and he said my
[1:08:08] son Be
[1:08:10] steady God is fixing to move I thought a
[1:08:15] Catholic bishop telling me that he said
[1:08:17] read it out of my book and I read the
[1:08:20] scripture out of his book and took my
[1:08:23] text and went on preach my sermon
[1:08:27] afterwards when I got through he got up
[1:08:29] after I was gone and said this one thing
[1:08:31] has to happen after that the church has
[1:08:34] to get out of the mess that sit in or we
[1:08:36] have to get out of the mess the churches
[1:08:38] in so one of the other and um I was on
[1:08:42] my road home back down to Tucson that
[1:08:44] evening the kids was crying for a
[1:08:46] sandwich and I stopped to get a sandwich
[1:08:49] at little standing my wife said bill I
[1:08:52] never was so nervous in all my life
[1:08:55] to see you stand up there fuming to that
[1:08:58] Bible said didn't it make you nervous I
[1:08:59] said no I said I know it was in there
[1:09:02] somewhere they just didn't have the
[1:09:03] pages a misprint and she said to think
[1:09:05] that I got you that Bible and look like
[1:09:07] every eye in there was right up on me
[1:09:10] and I said well you couldn't help that
[1:09:11] there was a misprint in the Bible I said
[1:09:13] they just never put the page in well I
[1:09:16] got down and looked at it again just
[1:09:17] perfect if it could be but the 16th
[1:09:20] chapter ends portion the portion of it
[1:09:22] just about 3 Ines from the bottom over
[1:09:25] at the 17th chapter on the other side
[1:09:28] does the same thing and being a new
[1:09:29] Bible those two pages had perfectly
[1:09:31] stuck together now I was reading from
[1:09:33] the 17th chapter instead of the 16th
[1:09:36] well I said that's all fine for some
[1:09:39] cause and justce plain as you could hear
[1:09:43] any voice a voice come to me and said he
[1:09:47] entered into Nazareth the where he was
[1:09:51] brought up at and went into the
[1:09:54] synagogue as it was was his
[1:09:56] custom and the priest gave him the
[1:10:00] scriptures to read and he read Isaiah
[1:10:06] 61 and when he had read the scriptures
[1:10:09] he sat down handed the priests back the
[1:10:12] Bible the book and sat down and all the
[1:10:17] eyes of the congregation was up on him
[1:10:20] and precious words proceeded from his
[1:10:22] mouth and he said this day this this
[1:10:25] scripture is
[1:10:27] fulfilled this day this scripture is
[1:10:30] fulfilled
[1:10:33] how accurate is the scripture if you'll
[1:10:37] notice this in Isaiah 61
[1:10:41] 1-2 is where our Lord was reading
[1:10:45] from Isaiah 61 1-2 but in the middle of
[1:10:49] the second verse of Isaiah 61 he stopped
[1:10:53] where it said the spirit of the Lord is
[1:10:55] upon me to preach the acceptable year
[1:10:59] then he stopped why the other part to
[1:11:03] bring judgment didn't apply to his first
[1:11:05] coming but his second coming see it
[1:11:09] didn't apply there how the scriptures
[1:11:11] never make a mistake they're always
[1:11:15] perfect Jesus stopped just where the
[1:11:18] scripture stopped because that was
[1:11:21] exactly what was to be Vindicated in his
[1:11:24] day
[1:11:25] now in that first coming the second
[1:11:28] coming he will bring judgment upon the
[1:11:30] Earth but not then he was to preach the
[1:11:33] acceptable year notice the
[1:11:36] Messiah standing in the platform to
[1:11:39] identify himself with the Word of
[1:11:42] Promise for that
[1:11:45] age how
[1:11:47] strange the Messi standing up before the
[1:11:53] church and look at these precious words
[1:11:56] when he says here to preach the
[1:11:58] acceptable year the acceptable year as
[1:12:02] we all know his Bible readers was the
[1:12:04] Year of Jubilee that when all slaves and
[1:12:08] prisoners as they were uh been taken
[1:12:12] prison and it had to give a son to pay a
[1:12:16] debt or a daughter to pay a
[1:12:19] debt and they were in bondage no matter
[1:12:22] how long they'd been in bondage or how
[1:12:24] long they SP to stay there when the year
[1:12:27] come of the Jubilee when the trumpet
[1:12:30] sounded every man could go free if you
[1:12:34] wanted to go
[1:12:35] free were free you was no more
[1:12:38] slave but if you desired to remain a
[1:12:41] slave then you had to be taken down to
[1:12:44] the temple stood by the temple post and
[1:12:48] they took a awe and Bor a hole in your
[1:12:51] ear and then you had to serve that slave
[1:12:56] master the rest of your days what a
[1:12:59] perfect example it is of the Gospel of
[1:13:02] Jesus Christ when it's preached the
[1:13:05] acceptable time and the time of Jubilee
[1:13:09] anybody no matter who you are what color
[1:13:13] you are what denomination you belong to
[1:13:16] how far you stooped in sin or what's
[1:13:19] wrong with you you can go free when you
[1:13:21] hear the Dr gospel trumpet sound out
[1:13:26] you are free but if you turn your back
[1:13:30] upon the
[1:13:32] message and refuse to hear it notice you
[1:13:36] were bored in the ear with an awe that
[1:13:41] means to say that you have crossed the
[1:13:44] line between grace and judgment and you
[1:13:48] will never hear the gospel again you'll
[1:13:52] never get any further you must be a
[1:13:54] Slave to the system you're in the rest
[1:13:57] of your days if you refuse to hear the
[1:14:00] acceptable
[1:14:02] year now the other part of it as I said
[1:14:06] didn't need to be answered because this
[1:14:09] coming Messiah time now is when he will
[1:14:12] bring judgment now how could those
[1:14:16] people ever fail to see who he
[1:14:22] was how did they ever Miss
[1:14:26] how could it be when it was so plainly
[1:14:29] made known and
[1:14:31] showed how could they have ever miss
[1:14:34] seeing when he what a word think of it
[1:14:38] this day is this scripture fulfilled
[1:14:42] before your
[1:14:44] eyes who said it God himself who is The
[1:14:49] Interpreter of his own word this day is
[1:14:53] this scripture fulfilled the Messiah
[1:14:56] himself standing in the presence of the
[1:14:59] congregation and reading a word out of
[1:15:03] the Bible pertaining to himself and then
[1:15:06] saying today this scripture is fulfilled
[1:15:09] and they still fail to see
[1:15:12] it what a tragedy that that would be but
[1:15:17] it's happened it's happened many times
[1:15:19] how could it happen of course like it
[1:15:22] did in other times by believing man
[1:15:25] interpretation of the
[1:15:27] word that's what caused it those
[1:15:31] Believers in them days so-called
[1:15:33] Believers was taking the interpretation
[1:15:37] of what the priest had said about the
[1:15:40] scripture therefore Jesus not belonging
[1:15:42] to any of their ranks or their societies
[1:15:46] he was uh
[1:15:48] excommunicated from their company and
[1:15:52] therefore they could not identify him
[1:15:55] with them because he was different from
[1:15:58] them the person of Jesus Christ was so
[1:16:01] unique that no one should have Miss
[1:16:04] seing that was a Son of God because he
[1:16:06] was a perfect identification of the
[1:16:09] scripture that was wrote of
[1:16:11] him it's the way any Christian is known
[1:16:14] when his life identifies the very things
[1:16:17] that a Christian supposed to
[1:16:20] do how he could stand there and say this
[1:16:23] day this scripture is fulfilled right
[1:16:26] before your
[1:16:27] eyes how outstanding how so plainly and
[1:16:32] yet those people
[1:16:33] misunderstood why is because they took
[1:16:36] the interpretation of some order of
[1:16:40] priest that they were listening to and
[1:16:43] history always repeats itself and
[1:16:46] scripture has a compound meaning to it
[1:16:49] and a compound
[1:16:51] Revelation for instance like it says in
[1:16:53] the Bible that out of Egypt I've called
[1:16:57] my son referring to Jesus run the
[1:16:59] marging on that you find out it also
[1:17:01] referred to
[1:17:02] Jacob same scripture Jesus was his
[1:17:05] greater
[1:17:07] son Jacob was his son he called out of
[1:17:10] Egypt which the Scofield reference and
[1:17:12] all other references give to it because
[1:17:14] that's a scripture it was referring to
[1:17:16] so it had a a double answer it had an
[1:17:20] answer to Jacob called out and to Jesus
[1:17:23] called out and so is it today is because
[1:17:28] that we're in such a turmoil as we are
[1:17:31] and people fail to see the truth of God
[1:17:35] is because there's too many man-made
[1:17:38] interpretations of God's
[1:17:41] word God don't need nobody to interpret
[1:17:44] his word he is his own
[1:17:48] interpreter God said in the beginning
[1:17:50] let there be light and there was light
[1:17:53] that doesn't need an interpret ration he
[1:17:56] said a virgin shall conceive and she did
[1:17:59] that doesn't need any interpretation
[1:18:02] when God's interpretation of his word is
[1:18:05] when he vindicates and proves it to be
[1:18:07] so that's his interpretation by making
[1:18:10] it come to pass that's where God's
[1:18:13] interpretation is it's when he makes his
[1:18:16] word come to pass he's interpreted it to
[1:18:19] you like if it never been light you said
[1:18:22] let there be light if there was that
[1:18:23] don't need anybody to interpret but we
[1:18:26] get man-made systems mixed into it and
[1:18:29] when you do you you get it out of line
[1:18:33] it's always been that way but I still
[1:18:36] think of how striking it must have been
[1:18:38] think of it the Messiah why did they
[1:18:41] fail to see him because they're very
[1:18:44] leaders that ought to have know him that
[1:18:47] ought to been first in the scripture
[1:18:50] that ought to be understanding of the
[1:18:52] scriptures they belittle this
[1:18:55] name and said he's the illegitimate
[1:18:58] child to to begin
[1:19:00] with we wouldn't believe that years
[1:19:04] later we don't believe that we would die
[1:19:07] for the purpose to say that he was a
[1:19:09] virgin born
[1:19:10] son and it'll come to pass someday that
[1:19:14] the very things that we see Jehovah
[1:19:16] doing
[1:19:17] today men the ages to come if there is
[1:19:20] will die for the thing that we're
[1:19:22] talking about today you'll have to do it
[1:19:24] for the mark of the beast comes on and
[1:19:26] you're not allowed to preach the gospel
[1:19:28] this
[1:19:29] way when the Great Union of churches
[1:19:32] comes together which is in order right
[1:19:34] now for the World
[1:19:35] Church you'll have to seal your
[1:19:38] testimony with your own life to
[1:19:40] this you must believe it now if those
[1:19:44] priests could rise up and condemn him
[1:19:45] would not condemn him but you say if I
[1:19:48] have been there I would have done so and
[1:19:51] so well that wasn't your age but this is
[1:19:55] your
[1:19:56] age this is the time you say well if he
[1:19:59] was sh the Bible say he's the same
[1:20:02] yesterday today and forever the same so
[1:20:05] he is
[1:20:07] here but he sh as the world has
[1:20:09] civilized become greater and educated
[1:20:12] more he's sharing a spirit form which
[1:20:15] they cannot kill or put to death he died
[1:20:17] once he cannot die again he had to be
[1:20:20] made flesh in order for God to be put to
[1:20:22] Death In the Flesh for sin but this time
[1:20:25] he can never die it's the Holy Spirit
[1:20:27] now how to think that they had them
[1:20:31] things against him another thing that he
[1:20:33] would not join any of their
[1:20:36] ranks then you see that still made him a
[1:20:39] bad person he wouldn't join their their
[1:20:42] organizations wouldn't join their
[1:20:44] priesthood and he wouldn't have nothing
[1:20:46] to do with it and then besides all that
[1:20:49] he tried to tear down what they buil
[1:20:53] up he went in into the temple we call
[1:20:56] him a meat man he was but many times we
[1:20:59] misunderstand what meekness
[1:21:02] is he was a man of compassion but yet we
[1:21:05] fail sometime to understand what
[1:21:06] compassions is not human sympathy isn't
[1:21:10] compassion but compassion is doing the
[1:21:12] will of
[1:21:14] God he passed through the pool of
[1:21:16] Bethesda the gate there laid people
[1:21:19] multitudes of them multitudes is no
[1:21:22] certain number but they laid multitudes
[1:21:24] Le blind Hal
[1:21:26] wither and he had compassion on the
[1:21:29] people always and he went to one person
[1:21:32] that was not lame blind Hal or withered
[1:21:36] maybe had a prostrate trouble maybe he
[1:21:38] had some little infirmity that was
[1:21:40] had it 38 years it wasn't going
[1:21:42] to bother him wasn't going to kill him
[1:21:45] he was laying on a pallet and he said
[1:21:47] will thou be made whole and a man said I
[1:21:51] have nobody to put me in the water but
[1:21:52] while I'm coming or someone steps down a
[1:21:54] I mean see he could walk he could see he
[1:21:56] could get around but he was just feeble
[1:21:59] and Jesus said to him rise up take up
[1:22:02] your bed and go to your house and
[1:22:06] Jesus's question on that but you
[1:22:09] remember the scripture said this no
[1:22:11] wonder if he'd come to Jeffersonville
[1:22:13] tonight and make an act like that they'd
[1:22:15] still talk about him but remember he
[1:22:18] came to do one thing was the will of God
[1:22:22] now that's found in St John 5 19
[1:22:25] you'll get the answer he said verely
[1:22:27] verely I say unto you the son can do
[1:22:29] nothing in himself but what he sees the
[1:22:31] father doing that doth the son now they
[1:22:35] ought to have known that that was a very
[1:22:37] Vindication of the prophecy of Moses for
[1:22:40] the Lord your God shall raise up a
[1:22:42] prophet liken unto me you notice when he
[1:22:44] seen the man he said Jesus knew that he
[1:22:46] had been in this condition for many
[1:22:48] years see being a prophet he saw that
[1:22:51] man in that condition and went down
[1:22:53] there and wave waved his way around to
[1:22:56] those people mincing through the crowd
[1:22:58] until he found that certain Man passed
[1:23:00] by the lame Halk blind and withered yet
[1:23:02] a manful of compassion but compassion is
[1:23:06] doing the will of God now we find him as
[1:23:10] he would not join up with them he would
[1:23:12] not have nothing to do in their ranks
[1:23:14] then he was an outcast he would not have
[1:23:17] any besides that he went into the temple
[1:23:19] one day a man went in there and found
[1:23:22] the house of God just out contaminated
[1:23:25] as it is today they were buying selling
[1:23:28] changing money and he turned over the
[1:23:30] money tables tuck ropes and plaided them
[1:23:33] and beat the money changers out of the
[1:23:34] temple and looked upon them with anger
[1:23:37] and said it's
[1:23:39] written Hallelujah my father's house is
[1:23:42] a House of Prayer you made it a to
[1:23:45] Fe and you with your Traditions has made
[1:23:48] the Commandments of God of non effect
[1:23:51] all could have bunch like had ever
[1:23:52] believe in in ner they had been so hogw
[1:23:56] watered in the muck of societies and
[1:23:58] filth of the day until they were so
[1:24:00] ecclesiastical frow up until they
[1:24:03] couldn't feel the vibrations of the
[1:24:05] power of almighty God no wonder a little
[1:24:08] woman could touch His Garment and get
[1:24:10] heal by and a drunen soldier could spit
[1:24:12] in his pace and feel no
[1:24:14] virtue depends on how you approach it
[1:24:17] depends on what you're looking for when
[1:24:20] you're going to church it depends on
[1:24:21] what you're looking for
[1:24:24] now we see him standing there no doubt
[1:24:27] but what the people had already warned
[1:24:29] warned the priest had warned the people
[1:24:31] now he's coming over here next Sabbath
[1:24:34] and when he does don't you listen to him
[1:24:37] now you might go and sit here but don't
[1:24:39] pay no attention what he says because he
[1:24:41] don't belong to our
[1:24:42] group he's an outcast he has no
[1:24:45] Fellowship card he don't even have an or
[1:24:48] uh organization paper with him he
[1:24:50] doesn't have nothing like that what is
[1:24:52] he some renegation boy that was born
[1:24:55] down here illegitimate Birth by an a
[1:24:57] carer's home that a mother conceived him
[1:25:00] before they were married they're trying
[1:25:02] to hide the thing up with some
[1:25:03] Supernatural thing we don't know that
[1:25:05] when the Messiah cometh he'll come down
[1:25:07] the corners of heaven and go to our high
[1:25:10] priest and say Here I Am
[1:25:12] CES but we find out that he didn't do it
[1:25:16] that way because it wasn't written in
[1:25:18] the word that way it was a manmade
[1:25:20] tradition that caused him to believe
[1:25:23] that the word word said that he would
[1:25:25] come just the way he
[1:25:27] come there he stood reading the word and
[1:25:31] saying to them this day this scripture
[1:25:35] is fulfilled in your eyes and still they
[1:25:38] fail to see him or
[1:25:41] recognizing like he did in all other
[1:25:43] ages Noah could have said the same thing
[1:25:46] the day that he entered into the ark and
[1:25:48] the door closed Moses could have raised
[1:25:51] that wind in the top of the Ark looked
[1:25:52] out upon the congregation remember God
[1:25:55] closed the door and he could said this
[1:25:58] day this scripture is full of pill in
[1:26:00] your eyes but it was too late for than
[1:26:03] that he had preached 120 years to try to
[1:26:06] get him into that boat that he had built
[1:26:08] telling him that the scriptures said
[1:26:10] thus sayith the lord it's going to
[1:26:13] rain but they waited too long but Noah
[1:26:17] could have easily said that today this
[1:26:19] day the scripture is fulfilled Moses the
[1:26:22] same day that the pillar of fire come
[1:26:26] down on Mount Si and give witness to his
[1:26:30] testimony Moses could have said this day
[1:26:33] this scripture is
[1:26:34] fulfilled Moses you know was a called
[1:26:36] man of God a prophet and while he was
[1:26:39] being called being a prophet he had to
[1:26:42] have a supernatural experience in order
[1:26:45] to be a prophet he had to meet God face
[1:26:48] to face and talk with him and another
[1:26:50] thing what he said had to come to pass
[1:26:52] or no one would have believed him so no
[1:26:55] man has a right to call himself thus
[1:26:57] until he's talked face to face with God
[1:27:01] on a backside of a desert somewhere
[1:27:03] where he met God himself all the
[1:27:06] atheists in the world could not explain
[1:27:08] it away from him he was there he know it
[1:27:10] happened every Christian should have
[1:27:12] that experience before they say anything
[1:27:15] about being a Christian your own
[1:27:17] experience I talked to my nephew a while
[1:27:20] ago a little catholic boy and said Uncle
[1:27:22] Bill I run from Pillar To Post
[1:27:25] going everywhere trying to find
[1:27:27] something night tonight before this
[1:27:29] meeting started he's been crying and at
[1:27:32] night time he's been dreaming dreams of
[1:27:34] coming in running up to the altar we
[1:27:36] preaching and making a confession that
[1:27:38] he's been wrong I said Melvin no matter
[1:27:41] where you try to go how many churches
[1:27:43] you jar how many Hail marries you say or
[1:27:45] how many blessings you get from man you
[1:27:48] got to be born again of the spirit of
[1:27:51] God it's the only thing that'll satisfy
[1:27:53] the human heart that's I know they got a
[1:27:57] substitute today of being born again to
[1:27:58] shake hands with the preacher and put
[1:28:00] your name on the book but friends that
[1:28:02] is a
[1:28:04] Dogma it's not a Bible truth if it would
[1:28:08] the Acts of the Apostles in the second
[1:28:10] chapter have to read like this when the
[1:28:12] day of Pentecost is fully come the
[1:28:14] pastor walk out and shook hands with the
[1:28:16] people but said when the day of
[1:28:18] Pentecost and fully cometh the
[1:28:19] inauguration of the church there came a
[1:28:21] sound from heaven like a Russian Mighty
[1:28:23] Wind and it build all the house where
[1:28:25] they were
[1:28:26] setting that's how the Holy Spirit Come
[1:28:28] the first time that's how it's come ever
[1:28:30] come since that time he's God and
[1:28:34] changes not now it stumbles people they
[1:28:37] say that was for another day well he's
[1:28:40] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:28:43] every time the church ever received the
[1:28:44] Holy Ghost it's always come like it did
[1:28:46] the first time under the same
[1:28:48] prescription acts 238 never has changed
[1:28:51] never will change like a doctor's
[1:28:53] prescription for a disease you write out
[1:28:55] a prescription for a disease the doctor
[1:28:57] does and take it to some quack drug us
[1:28:59] and he puts too much of the antidote in
[1:29:02] it it's so weak it won't do you any good
[1:29:04] he puts too much of the Poise then it'll
[1:29:06] kill you it's got to be wrote just
[1:29:08] according to the doctor and the doctor's
[1:29:10] prescription on how to receive the Holy
[1:29:12] Ghost is given to us by Dr Simon Peter
[1:29:15] on the day of Pentecost I'll give you a
[1:29:18] prescription repent every one of you and
[1:29:20] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:29:22] for the remission of sins and you shall
[1:29:23] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[1:29:25] the prescription is the them is fall and
[1:29:28] even as a man is the Lord Our God shall
[1:29:30] call the Eternal
[1:29:33] prescription Moses had had this
[1:29:35] experience he went down into the country
[1:29:39] and he began to tell the people I met a
[1:29:41] pillar of fire he was in a burning bush
[1:29:44] and he told me to tell you I am that I
[1:29:47] am go down I'll be with you take up the
[1:29:51] stick in your hand and hold it up over
[1:29:52] Egypt whatever you you ask it'll be done
[1:29:55] well probably s priest said nonsense but
[1:29:58] when they seen the real facts of this
[1:30:00] take come to pass they couldn't hold it
[1:30:02] any longer they know he was s of God
[1:30:05] then if Moses said he saw that and
[1:30:08] testified to it to be the truth then God
[1:30:11] obligated if that is the truth to
[1:30:13] identify and vindicate that man's word
[1:30:16] the
[1:30:18] truth that's
[1:30:20] true if Jesus Christ stood there and
[1:30:23] read that day this day is this word
[1:30:25] fulfilled before you God's obligated to
[1:30:28] make that word come to
[1:30:31] pass we stand here tonight and say that
[1:30:34] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:30:36] and forever God's obligated to prove
[1:30:39] that to be
[1:30:40] so because it's his word
[1:30:44] yes now what does it do it takes faith
[1:30:46] in believing him FES faith in believing
[1:30:49] his word that it is the truth notice
[1:30:53] what come to pass
[1:30:54] when Moses brought the children out and
[1:30:56] all those that followed him those who
[1:30:59] did not follow stayed in Egypt but those
[1:31:02] who followed Moses when they come out of
[1:31:04] the Red Sea and got out into the
[1:31:07] Wilderness God came down upon Mount Si
[1:31:12] that pillar fire set the whole Mountain
[1:31:14] on fire and a voice spoke out of there
[1:31:17] God gave the 10 commandments Moses could
[1:31:19] have walked up there before the people
[1:31:21] and say this day the scripture that I
[1:31:23] have have told you as his Prophet comes
[1:31:26] to pass this day I've told you that God
[1:31:30] let me and not Bing a burning bush and a
[1:31:32] pillar of fire and he said this I'll
[1:31:35] this will be a sign you will bring them
[1:31:38] people right back to this place here
[1:31:40] again and there's God in the same pillar
[1:31:43] I told you was in hanging right down her
[1:31:44] on the
[1:31:45] mountain this day this prophecy is
[1:31:49] fulfilled here he is to vindicate that
[1:31:52] the things I've said is the truth God
[1:31:54] give us more man like that that's honest
[1:31:57] and sincere and tell the truth that God
[1:32:00] Almighty could vindicate that his word
[1:32:02] is still truth he remains the same
[1:32:05] yesterday ever why wouldn't he do it he
[1:32:08] promised to do it Joshua he might have
[1:32:11] said the same the day that he' come back
[1:32:15] to kades Baria where they had journeyed
[1:32:18] so far in the wilderness they were
[1:32:20] doubting the land being the kind of land
[1:32:22] that God said it would be but God told
[1:32:24] them it was a good land it was flowing
[1:32:26] with milk and honey and Joshua and Caleb
[1:32:29] was the only two that would believe it
[1:32:31] out the other 10 that left when they
[1:32:34] come back they had the evidence they had
[1:32:37] a bunch of graps that two strong man
[1:32:40] could only
[1:32:41] carry Joshua and Caleb could have stood
[1:32:43] right there and said this day this
[1:32:45] scripture is fulfilled here's the
[1:32:48] evidence that it is a good land sure one
[1:32:53] there's the evidence that it's a good
[1:32:55] land where did you ever get such things
[1:32:57] as that in Egypt there was no such
[1:32:59] places but this day this scripture is
[1:33:03] fulfilled he could have said the them
[1:33:05] see when he prophesied and said the
[1:33:08] walls of Jericho would fall down as they
[1:33:10] marched around seven times seven days
[1:33:13] seven times a day and when they marched
[1:33:15] around that last time the walls fell
[1:33:18] down Joshua could a step and said this
[1:33:23] this day the chief captain of the host
[1:33:26] of the Lord that told me weeks ago that
[1:33:29] it would happen like this this day this
[1:33:31] scripture is fulfilled there laid the
[1:33:33] walls flat on the ground come on let's
[1:33:35] go take it it belongs to us this day
[1:33:38] this scripture is fulfilled how
[1:33:41] wonderful man of God has stood for the
[1:33:43] things that's right Israel at the river
[1:33:47] when they possessed the land went over
[1:33:50] how are they going to do it it's the
[1:33:52] month of April the flood are coming down
[1:33:54] because the snow was melting up in Judea
[1:33:56] oh what a poor uh General it seemed like
[1:33:59] a God was to bring these people there in
[1:34:02] the month of April when the Jordan was
[1:34:03] higher back than it ever was sometimes I
[1:34:06] might get stop here if I had time to
[1:34:08] give you just a little tip sometimes you
[1:34:10] may be studying out with cancer you
[1:34:11] might be study with the disease you
[1:34:13] think why me being a Christian would be
[1:34:16] in this way why would I be sitting like
[1:34:18] this if I'm a Christian sometimes God
[1:34:21] lets the things get so dark that you
[1:34:22] can't see up around or anywhere else and
[1:34:24] then he comes and makes a way through it
[1:34:26] for she might say this day this
[1:34:29] scripture is being
[1:34:31] fulfilled that he promised to do he let
[1:34:34] the Hebrew children walk right into the
[1:34:35] fiery furnace they said our God is able
[1:34:38] to deliver us in this fiery furnace but
[1:34:40] nevertheless we not bow down to your
[1:34:41] image when they walked out there at the
[1:34:43] smell of the Furnace upon them no smell
[1:34:45] of the Furnace rather upon them they
[1:34:46] could have said this day is this
[1:34:48] scripture fulfilled Daniel come from the
[1:34:51] Lions then he could have said the same
[1:34:53] thing
[1:34:54] John the Baptist after 400 years of
[1:34:58] ecclesiastical teaching no wonder that
[1:35:00] church is in a mess at that time when he
[1:35:02] appeared in the wilderness the Jordan he
[1:35:05] could stood right there on the bank as
[1:35:06] he did and say this day this scripture
[1:35:10] Isaiah Authority is
[1:35:12] fulfilled how I could stop here and tell
[1:35:14] you what that old priest told me said
[1:35:16] Son you never finish that message I said
[1:35:18] keep still he said you mean them
[1:35:19] Pentecostals don't see that I said no he
[1:35:21] said I see it in a Catholic preach
[1:35:23] [Music]
[1:35:25] he said why didn't you go I said keep
[1:35:27] still he said glory to God I see it and
[1:35:30] about that time the Holy Ghost fell on
[1:35:32] his sister sitting out there in a
[1:35:33] meeting and she raised up speaking in
[1:35:35] unknowing tongues and gave the
[1:35:37] interpretation of the very thing that
[1:35:39] the priest and I were talking about on
[1:35:40] the platform the whole church the whole
[1:35:43] place went into a roar turn on over old
[1:35:46] Robert's convention last week or week
[1:35:48] before last was to talk of the
[1:35:50] convention how did that priest setting
[1:35:52] on the Holy Spirit reveal out there
[1:35:54] through a woman his sister I believe it
[1:35:56] was what was taking place up there on
[1:35:58] the platform and revealed that thing
[1:36:01] that we were
[1:36:05] hiding the hour that we're living this
[1:36:08] day this scripture is fulfilled this day
[1:36:12] the evening lights have come and we fail
[1:36:15] to see it notice John said this day I am
[1:36:19] the voice of one crying in the
[1:36:21] wilderness I said the prophet Isaiah
[1:36:24] prepare the way for the Lord they didn't
[1:36:27] understand said oh you're Jesus you're
[1:36:28] you're the Christ rather he said I am
[1:36:31] not the Christ he said I'm not worthy to
[1:36:33] loose his shoes but he said he's
[1:36:35] standing among you
[1:36:37] somewhere for he was sure that he would
[1:36:41] be there he' be in his day because God
[1:36:43] told him he was to introduce the Messiah
[1:36:45] one day a young man's come walking down
[1:36:47] through there and he seen a a like a
[1:36:49] light over the top of him a sign and he
[1:36:51] cried out Behold the Lamb of God
[1:36:54] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:36:56] before you sure at the day of Pentecost
[1:37:00] how Peter stood up and quoted their
[1:37:03] scripture of Joel 238 when they was all
[1:37:05] laughing at those people they couldn't
[1:37:07] talk in their own language they were
[1:37:08] jabbering off something else the Bible
[1:37:10] said clothing tongues clothing is a
[1:37:12] party tongue not saying nothing just a
[1:37:14] jabber running around like a bunch of
[1:37:16] drunk people they all said well these
[1:37:17] people are drunk look at them look how
[1:37:20] they're acting how them women and men
[1:37:21] they're disorderly said that religious
[1:37:23] group of that day Peter stood up in the
[1:37:26] midst of them said man and Brethren you
[1:37:29] that dwell in Jerusalem and you that
[1:37:31] dwell in Judea let it be known unto you
[1:37:34] that these are not drunk as you supp
[1:37:35] supp sing it's the third hour of the day
[1:37:37] but this is that which is spoke of by
[1:37:40] the prophet Joel it'll come to pass in
[1:37:42] the last day I'll pour out my spirit
[1:37:45] upon All Flesh this day this scripture
[1:37:48] was fulfilled certainly Luther was right
[1:37:51] on time Wesley was right on time
[1:37:55] Pentecost was right on time nothing out
[1:37:58] of the order now I asked you to consider
[1:38:03] the age and time we now live in with the
[1:38:07] promised word for
[1:38:09] today if back in other ages man could
[1:38:12] say this day this
[1:38:15] scripture this day this scripture then
[1:38:18] what about the scripture for this day
[1:38:21] what's promised for this day amen where
[1:38:25] are we
[1:38:26] standing what hour are we living when
[1:38:30] the clock is beating the scientific
[1:38:32] clock 3 minutes before
[1:38:34] midnight world has got the Jitters the
[1:38:37] church is in a bed of
[1:38:38] corruption nobody knows where they're
[1:38:40] standing what time of day is it what
[1:38:44] about the scripture for this
[1:38:46] day the conditions of the church the
[1:38:49] conditions of the church today in the
[1:38:51] world politics our world system is just
[1:38:54] as rotten as it can be I'm not a
[1:38:57] politician I'm a Christian but I got no
[1:39:00] business talk about politics but I just
[1:39:01] want to say they're rotten on both sides
[1:39:04] I voted once that was for Christ I got
[1:39:06] to
[1:39:08] win the devil voted against me Christ
[1:39:11] voted for me depends on which way I cast
[1:39:13] my vote I'm glad I cast it on him let
[1:39:16] the world say what they want to I still
[1:39:18] believe that he's the same yesterday
[1:39:21] today and forever
[1:39:23] he'll prove it certainly will certainly
[1:39:27] the increase in crime juvenile
[1:39:29] delinquency look at our nation want the
[1:39:32] flower of the earth our great democracy

[1:39:39] decoration independ signed and we had a
[1:39:41] democracy our great forefathers and the
[1:39:43] things that they done we had a great
[1:39:45] nation but she is now rotting and
[1:39:48] crumbling and shaking and giving away

[1:39:52] send over to buy friendship with their
[1:39:55] enemies they're throwing it back in our
[1:39:57] face One World War Two World War and
[1:40:00] still moving on to a third certainly

[1:40:07] said it would be Nation be against
[1:40:09] Nation Kingdom against Kingdom all these
[1:40:12] things would take place let's consider
[1:40:14] this now all right notice another the
[1:40:18] increase in scientific research now one
[1:40:21] time Mr my grandfather went to see my
[1:40:23] grandmother in an ox cart now it's a jet
[1:40:28] plane or even orbit into the Earth in
[1:40:32] the outer
[1:40:34] space it's great how who said this
[1:40:37] Daniel 12:4 said knowledge shall
[1:40:39] increase in the last days we see the
[1:40:42] hour We're living notice our the the
[1:40:46] conditions of the world the condition of
[1:40:48] Science and notice again today in our
[1:40:50] educational

[1:40:54] the newspaper clippings teaching sex in
[1:40:58] our church in our schools of young
[1:41:01] students to have sexual affairs with one
[1:41:04] another to see if they can mate in the
[1:41:07] world yes sir how about in our
[1:41:09] priesthood tonight I got a piece out of
[1:41:12] the paper over in Los Angeles California

[1:41:17] Presbyterians ministers brought B to
[1:41:20] homosexuals and imp pacce homosexual

[1:42:27] setting
[1:42:28] councils and took the place with the
[1:42:31] world and today they got better
[1:42:33] buildings they ever had some place one
[1:42:36] of them is building a $50 million
[1:42:39] Auditorium $50 million Pentecostals that
[1:42:42] used to be down the corner 25 years ago
[1:42:44] beating a
[1:42:46] tambourine said we because the scripture
[1:42:48] said in Revelations 3 that you are rich
[1:42:52] that I'm rich I said as a queen I have
[1:42:54] nether nothing and knowest thou not that

[1:43:44] music to be beat up it takes the spirit
[1:43:46] of God to come down and long forgot it
[1:43:50] the that CL the gift to the Holy Ghost
[1:43:52] initial evidence of speaking in tongues
[1:43:54] and I heard devils and witches speak in
[1:43:57] tongues the Holy Ghost is a word of God
[1:43:59] in you that identifies Itself by
[1:44:01] accepting that word outside of that it
[1:44:04] can't be the Holy Ghost if it says it's
[1:44:06] the Holy Spirit and denies one word of
[1:44:07] that Bible it cannot be the Holy
[1:44:10] Spirit that's the evidence whether you
[1:44:12] believe or not notice another great sign

[1:55:34] back after their message this day that
[1:55:36] prophecy has been fulfilled in our this
[1:55:40] day this scripture has been fulfilled
[1:55:44] Watch Seven Seals has been open the wh
[1:55:47] winds to the West Coast now don't miss
[1:55:50] it like they did back Yonder
[1:55:53] now our attention a little closer to our
[1:55:56] day what does the scripture say about
[1:56:00] today and about the time we live in
[1:56:03] Jesus speaking won't have time to take
[1:56:06] them all but I want to take this one
[1:56:08] before we close Jesus said in St Luke
[1:56:12] the 17th chapter the 30th verse Jesus
[1:56:15] Christ the word himself do you believe
[1:56:18] that Jesus Christ the word himself made
[1:56:21] flesh spoke and said what the word would
[1:56:24] be in the end time what would be the
[1:56:27] sign of the end of the world he told him
[1:56:30] Nation to Rise Against Nation but he
[1:56:32] said as it was in the days of
[1:56:34] Sodom so shall it be in the day when the
[1:56:39] son of man is being revealed now when
[1:56:41] Jesus came to the Earth he came in the
[1:56:43] name of Three Sons son of man which is a
[1:56:47] prophet Son of God and Son of David now
[1:56:51] he Le your own Earth he never did say he
[1:56:53] was the son of God he said I'm the son
[1:56:55] of man Jehovah himself called Ezekiel
[1:56:58] and the prophets son of man because he
[1:57:00] had to come to fulfill scripture as a
[1:57:04] prophet Moses said the larger God shall
[1:57:07] raise up a prophet liken unto me that's
[1:57:10] the reason he could not be the Son of
[1:57:12] God there because he was the son of man
[1:57:14] he the word came to the prophets and he
[1:57:17] was the word in his fullness amen son of
[1:57:20] man the the m Prophet not the major
[1:57:23] prophet but the god Prophet the fullness
[1:57:26] of the godhead bodily was in him
[1:57:28] therefore he was the son of man now for
[1:57:31] 2,000 years he's been known to us as Son
[1:57:33] of God spirit and in the Millennium
[1:57:36] he'll be son of David up on the throne
[1:57:39] we all know that who believe the
[1:57:40] scriptures now Jesus said just at the
[1:57:43] end of this church age that we're living
[1:57:47] in that the son of man would be revealed
[1:57:50] again in the same manner it was was as
[1:57:52] it was at
[1:57:54] Sodom watch how historically he gave it
[1:57:58] he said as it was in the days
[1:58:00] first of Noah how they were eating
[1:58:02] drinking marry and giving a marriage
[1:58:04] then he brought next the last to the son
[1:58:06] of man at Sodom because there he was
[1:58:09] dealing with Jews here at Sodom he's
[1:58:11] dealing with Gentiles there he drowned
[1:58:14] of all the water in judgment here at the
[1:58:16] Gentiles he burn them all at the day of
[1:58:18] Sodom that's right the Gentile World
[1:58:21] burnt there and so will it be when the
[1:58:23] Son of Man reveals there's not no more
[1:58:25] water but it be fire this time Jesus
[1:58:28] read from the same Genesis 23 that we
[1:58:30] read from when he read about Sodom now
[1:58:35] we admit the conditions that spoke of of
[1:58:37] the world condition of Sodom sodomites
[1:58:40] Sodom condition we everyone will say
[1:58:42] Amen to that we believe that all right
[1:58:46] in the spiritual condition of Lady oia
[1:58:48] the church natural we'll say Amen to
[1:58:50] that and and accept their signs we know
[1:58:54] that every sign is there the church is
[1:58:55] in lady OA we know that we know the
[1:58:58] world is in a Sodom condition is that
[1:59:00] right we'll accept that but what about
[1:59:03] the sign of Abraham the one waiting for
[1:59:07] the promised
[1:59:09] son that was another remember they had a
[1:59:12] Sodom back there they had their
[1:59:13] messenger and Abraham had a messenger to
[1:59:16] him Abraham was waiting day by day for a
[1:59:20] almost an impossible thing to happen
[1:59:23] Sarah 90 and him 100 according to the
[1:59:27] promise of God he was still waiting in
[1:59:28] the midst of all criticism he was
[1:59:30] waiting for that son so is a True
[1:59:34] Believer still waiting for that promised
[1:59:36] son to return notice just before the sun
[1:59:40] arrived there was a sign given him is
[1:59:43] not the sign of the coming son to be
[1:59:46] revealed to the Royal Seed of Abraham
[1:59:49] that's waiting for the royal son as s as
[1:59:52] it was to Father Abraham for the natural
[1:59:56] son that
[1:59:58] right Jesus said so here in St Luke
[2:00:02] 17:30 before this time come that the son
[2:00:06] of man would be revealed like he did in
[2:00:08] the days of Sodom before the destruction
[2:00:11] of Sodom now we're looking for a sign
[2:00:13] now let's take the conditions of time as
[2:00:15] it was in Sodom notice that all went out
[2:00:19] in sodomite the world I think one of the
[2:00:22] movie directors put on a picture not
[2:00:24] long ago and I got to see it that was
[2:00:26] Sodom if you ever see it there's nothing
[2:00:28] else on with that take a look at it it's
[2:00:29] a certainly a good picture of the United
[2:00:31] States today Hollywood just exactly same
[2:00:34] kind of dressing everything else that
[2:00:36] they did is right then big drunken spre
[2:00:38] and everything else a religious Cult of
[2:00:41] people so-called religious notice and
[2:00:44] Sodom had a wit and it was a fellow by
[2:00:47] the name of L which was just a nephew to
[2:00:51] to Abra Abraham now Abraham did not go
[2:00:55] down in Sodom he and his group he had a
[2:00:57] big group with him enough to fight off
[2:00:59] about a dozen Kings in their army so he
[2:01:02] had a big group with him and he was
[2:01:04] sitting out there under an oak tree one
[2:01:06] day when everything was going wrong for
[2:01:08] him nobody had anything to do with him
[2:01:11] but he was still holding on to that
[2:01:15] promise watch him closely before we
[2:01:19] closed while he was sitting there down
[2:01:21] down come three men walking to him two
[2:01:25] of them went down into Sodom and
[2:01:27] preached the gospel to them to come out
[2:01:29] to L is that right but L stayed with
[2:01:34] Abraham notice the one that stayed with
[2:01:36] Abraham was God
[2:01:40] himself the other two were Angel
[2:01:44] Messengers now down in Sodom had done no
[2:01:47] Miracles only smiting and blind and
[2:01:48] preaching the gospel always smites and
[2:01:50] blind I look at just said of that day
[2:01:53] there is a church natural always in
[2:01:56] trees as I said last night God is
[2:01:58] represented there was sodomites the
[2:02:01] latites and the Abraham
[2:02:04] ites it's in the same position
[2:02:08] tonight the world setting just like that
[2:02:12] let me ask you something look at this
[2:02:14] setting up Abraham called this man to
[2:02:18] talk to him
[2:02:20] Elohim the Hebrew word Elohim means the
[2:02:24] alls sufficient
[2:02:26] one the one that's the Eternal
[2:02:29] one
[2:02:31] Elohim God himself in the beginning
[2:02:34] Genesis one said in the beginning God
[2:02:36] take the Hebrew word there in Greek word
[2:02:38] rather in the beginning Elohim created
[2:02:41] heavens and earth here he is Genesis
[2:02:43] about 22 here he says again or about uh
[2:02:46] 20 he said and he called this man's name
[2:02:50] Elohim
[2:02:52] why did he do it God represented in a
[2:02:56] human flesh that sat down with Abraham
[2:02:59] and eat a c sandwich drinking some milk
[2:03:02] and eat some
[2:03:03] bread God himself and disappeared right
[2:03:07] before
[2:03:08] Abraham but he gave him a
[2:03:11] sign notice and that sign was that he
[2:03:15] had his back turned to the tent and
[2:03:17] remember Abraham his name was Abram a
[2:03:20] few days before that and Sarah was Sarah
[2:03:24] before that s a r r a then s a r a h and
[2:03:27] a r a m to a r a h m Abraham means
[2:03:32] father of Nations now watch real close
[2:03:35] here and we'll see the
[2:03:38] setting of The Hour That We're now
[2:03:41] living as Jesus told us to look for this
[2:03:43] setting we've seen all the rest of it
[2:03:45] right now let's see to the Royal Sea
[2:03:47] what setting they're supposed to see now
[2:03:50] this man said Abraham
[2:03:52] where is your wife
[2:03:55] Sarah and Abraham said she's in the tent
[2:03:59] behind you now he had never seen her how
[2:04:02] do you know that his name was
[2:04:05] Abraham how do you know her name was
[2:04:09] s amen Abraham where is your wife Sarah
[2:04:14] said she's in the tent behind you he
[2:04:15] said I I personal pronouns I am going to
[2:04:19] visit you according to the promise
[2:04:22] your wife's going to have that baby
[2:04:24] youve trusted me not I'm going to make
[2:04:26] it come to pass and Sarah in the tent
[2:04:29] behind e dropping or E dropping or what
[2:04:32] you call it listen to the tent she said
[2:04:34] laughed up her sleep and she said now
[2:04:36] I'm me on old woman like I am have
[2:04:39] pleasure of my Lord in him old too out
[2:04:41] there 100 years old W this hasn't
[2:04:43] happened for many many years and the man
[2:04:46] m a n sitting there eating in human
[2:04:49] flesh drinking and eating like an
[2:04:52] ordinary man with dust on his cloes and
[2:04:54] had dust on his feet and Abraham watched
[2:04:57] it
[2:04:58] off God
[2:05:03] himself looked around and he said why
[2:05:07] did Sarah laugh back in the tent saying
[2:05:10] this he knew could discern the thoughts
[2:05:14] of Sarah in the tent behind him is that
[2:05:18] right now when the Royal Seed of Abraham
[2:05:21] come on the earth what sign did he show
[2:05:25] son of
[2:05:27] man Simon came up to him one day Andrew
[2:05:29] brought him he said your name is Simon
[2:05:32] you're the son of Jonas he said be a
[2:05:35] believer out of me Philip went over and
[2:05:37] got theel come back said come see a man
[2:05:39] who we have we've found Jesus of
[2:05:41] Nazareth son of Joseph he said now wait
[2:05:43] a minute could anything good come out of
[2:05:45] that fanaticism he said come see so when
[2:05:48] Philip come up in the presence of Jesus
[2:05:50] with Nathaniel Jesus Jesus looked over
[2:05:52] at him and said behold an Israelite in
[2:05:53] whom there's no gu he said Rabbi when
[2:05:57] did you know me he said before Philip
[2:05:58] called you when you were under the tree
[2:06:00] I saw you said Rabbi th the Son of God
[2:06:05] you're the king of Israel and the little
[2:06:07] woman at the well in her immoral
[2:06:09] condition come up a little panoramic
[2:06:11] something like this to draw some water
[2:06:13] Jesus had send his disciples away to get
[2:06:15] fiddles when she come up to draw water
[2:06:17] he said bring me a drink woman she said
[2:06:19] it's not customary for you to say that
[2:06:21] we have segregation here now you Jews
[2:06:24] have nothing to do with us Samaritans we
[2:06:25] have nothing to do with you he said but
[2:06:27] woman if you knew who you were talking
[2:06:29] to you'd ask me for a drink I'd give you
[2:06:32] wat as you don't come here to draw he
[2:06:34] found where condition was what it was he
[2:06:36] said go get your husband and come here
[2:06:37] she said I don't have any husband he
[2:06:40] said you said the truth you've had five
[2:06:42] and the one you're living with now is
[2:06:44] not your she said sir I perceive that th
[2:06:47] the
[2:06:48] prophet we know when the Messiah cometh
[2:06:51] he'll show us these things Jesus said I
[2:06:54] am
[2:06:56] he on that she run into the City and
[2:06:59] said come see a man who's told me the
[2:07:01] things I've done isn't this the very
[2:07:03] Messiah watch he did that before the
[2:07:06] Jews and the Samaritans but never the
[2:07:09] Gentiles the Gentiles we people were
[2:07:11] heathens in them
[2:07:13] days the other nations packing a club on
[2:07:16] her back worshiping Idols we wasn't
[2:07:18] looking for no Messiah he only appears
[2:07:20] to those who's looking for him and we're
[2:07:23] supposed to be looking for him but those
[2:07:26] who claim to be looking for him the
[2:07:27] church itself when they seen that done
[2:07:30] they said he's a devil he's a fortune
[2:07:32] teller a be and Jesus said that sin
[2:07:35] would be forgiven them because he hadn't
[2:07:37] died yet but said someday the Holy Ghost
[2:07:39] will come and do the same thing and
[2:07:41] speak one word against it will never be
[2:07:42] forgiven that's this day where every
[2:07:45] word has to hang together speak a word
[2:07:47] against them never be forgiven in this
[2:07:49] world or the world to come that was the
[2:07:51] Royal Seed of Abraham and here that
[2:07:54] Royal seat of Abraham which come because
[2:07:56] of that identification of that man
[2:07:58] sitting there with Abraham come to prove
[2:08:00] it was the same God promis that in this
[2:08:05] day as it was in the days of Sodom so
[2:08:07] shall it be in the coming of the son of
[2:08:09] man when he is revealing himself as son
[2:08:13] of
[2:08:15] man
[2:08:18] amen this is the day for the script to
[2:08:21] be fulfilled look at the setting we are
[2:08:24] today look at the church for the Son of
[2:08:26] God look at the Dismal day look at all
[2:08:28] the prophecies now a strange
[2:08:31] thing our business are doe them if the
[2:08:34] setting has to be like it's stopping
[2:08:36] there were three of them come along
[2:08:37] three outstanding men Sent From Heaven
[2:08:40] we'll admit that three of them one stay
[2:08:43] with Abraham they all started there but
[2:08:46] one stayed with Abraham the rest of them
[2:08:48] went out in Sodom is that right and Abra
[2:08:51] Abraham had a changed name from Abram to
[2:08:54] Abraham true not one time has the
[2:08:58] history Church of the world ever had an
[2:09:00] Advan to go to it with a name ending in
[2:09:03] h m to this day Billy g r a h a m is
[2:09:09] that right g r a h a m six letters a b r
[2:09:13] a h a m is seven letters but g r a h a m
[2:09:17] is six letters which is the world man
[2:09:20] see
[2:09:21] look what's went out there today is that
[2:09:24] Messengers from Heaven is there a man on
[2:09:27] Earth that's got repentance so preached
[2:09:29] so plainly as Billy Graham has there
[2:09:31] been a man that has had an effect upon
[2:09:33] the people like Billy Graham never has
[2:09:36] there
[2:09:37] been internationally a man of Billy
[2:09:40] Sunday and so forth here in the United
[2:09:41] States but Billy Grims know
[2:09:43] worldwide see where he's calling out of
[2:09:48] Sodom and he's got his companying party
[2:09:50] there with the Pentecostal church and or
[2:09:53] Roberts but what about the elect
[2:09:56] group what kind of sign are they
[2:09:58] supposed to see what are they supposed
[2:10:00] to
[2:10:01] have
[2:10:03] Hallelujah it shall be light in the
[2:10:07] evening
[2:10:08] time this

[2:10:20] fulfilled
[2:10:23] we know that to be the
[2:10:25] truth he's here tonight as he was there
[2:10:29] got to preach it I said a while ago if
[2:10:33] you preach anything and it's a gospel
[2:10:35] truth then God's obligated to
[2:10:38] V is that
[2:10:41] true now if that be so let the god that
[2:10:44] wrote the word let the god that made the
[2:10:47] prophecy Let The God Who is God of the
[2:10:49] word come forth
[2:10:51] [Music]
[2:10:55] and prove that he's still
[2:10:58] God as Elijah went up on the mountain
