[35:36] My lips shall praise thee.
[35:40] Thus will I [singing] bless thee.
[35:45] I will lift up my hands [music]
[35:49] to thy name.
[35:52] Amen. I'd like to have the deacons come
[35:54] and take up the offering they needs.
[36:11] Good morning. We'll try that once more.
[36:14] Good morning.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; Morning.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; So good to be with the people of God
[36:17] this morning. We didn't have any prayer
[36:18] requests. We know we want to remember
[36:20] brother Scott's, a little relative,
[36:22] little Grady in the hospital, and just
[36:24] welcome everybody to church this
[36:26] morning. Let's bow our heads, our hearts
[36:28] this morning. Dear God, we're so
[36:29] thankful to be in church on a Saturday
[36:30] morning, the day we take off, Lord. But
[36:33] today, we're [music] taking off to
[36:34] worship you and no other thing that we
[36:36] could be doing. So, we thank you for it.
[36:37] Thank you for the sacrifice of each one,
[36:40] Lord, from Canada, from [music] South
[36:41] Africa, different places, Lord, and from
[36:44] the home here. and just thankful that
[36:48] people come together, Lord, to worship
[36:49] and love on you and love on one another.
[36:51] Just invite you as a guest of honor,
[36:53] Lord. Bless our ears to hear from you
[36:55] this morning, from Trevor, from you. And
[36:58] we pray [music] for a little Grady,
[36:59] Lord, for each request, Lord. We know
[37:02] just as a man, we'd want to do
[37:04] everything that we possibly could to
[37:06] help our children along the way. And we
[37:07] know that's your desire for us. So, we
[37:10] hold up our needs, our requests,
[37:12] financial, spiritual. Lord, the most
[37:14] important thing for that token, Lord,
[37:16] for eternal life. And we just apply that
[37:18] again. Help us, Lord, as we try to make
[37:21] things comfortable and best we can for
[37:23] the saints here. And may your perfect
[37:25] will be done in each heart and each life
[37:27] as we collect the tithes, the offerings,
[37:29] Lord. We do as [music] cheerful givers
[37:31] unto thee, knowing that you don't need
[37:34] it, but we're cheerful givers. And we
[37:36] bring a tithe and an offering, Lord,
[37:38] just to bless you once again. We love
[37:39] you. And in the precious name of our
[37:41] Lord and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[37:43] all God's people say, "Amen."
[37:51] Amazing love.

[52:00] Well, maybe
[52:02] I would think everybody's probably heard
[52:04] me sing this song, but I like to sing
[52:06] it. Um, it's kind of my theme [music]
[52:09] song for me because the song says,
[52:12] "Lord, I need you." That's just where
[52:14] we're [music] at, right? And so, but
[52:16] since there was only 11 people here that
[52:18] have heard me, plus those that never
[52:21] raised their hands in church,
[52:22] &gt;&gt; [music]
[52:22] &gt;&gt; um
[52:24] I thought, well, I can sing it again and
[52:26] maybe just that'll just relax me a
[52:28] little bit. [music] And and I thought,
[52:30] well, I probably shouldn't sing. My
[52:31] voice is a little I had [music] a three
[52:33] three services in Kansas last weekend
[52:35] and man, we sang and wasn't a lot left
[52:39] and there's been a lot of tea [music]
[52:41] over the last week. So, we're getting
[52:43] there. But, um, I'd just like to sing
[52:46] this song and and just and [music] just
[52:48] express a prayer to the Lord.
[52:51] [clears throat]
[52:55] Lord, I come.
[52:59] I confess.
[53:03] Bowing [singing and music]
[53:04] here,
[53:06] I find my rest
[53:10] [music] without [singing] you.
[53:13] I fall apart.
[53:17] You're the [singing] one
[53:21] who guides my [music] heart. [singing]
[53:25] Lord, I need you. [music]
[53:28] Oh, I need
[53:32] you. Oh, every [singing]
[53:35] hour. How I need [music]
[53:39] you. You're my one [singing] defense,
[53:44] my rightousness,
[53:46] [music]
[53:48] oh [singing] God, how I need.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Where sin runs [singing] deep,
[53:58] your grace is more. Hallelujah.
[54:02] Where [music] grace [singing] is found
[54:05] is where you are.
[54:09] And where you are,
[54:13] Lord, I am free.
[54:17] Holiness
[54:20] is [singing] Christ in me.
[54:24] Lord, I need you. Oh, I need
[54:31] you.
[54:32] Oh, every hour. How I need
[54:38] you. You're my one
[54:41] defense,
[54:43] my rightousness.
[54:47] Oh God, how I Oh, let's stand and
[54:50] [music] sing it together.
[54:53] Lord, I need you. Oh, [music]
[54:57] I [singing] need
[54:59] you.
[55:01] Oh, every hour. How [music and singing]
[55:05] I need
[55:07] you. You're my one
[55:10] defense, [singing]
[55:12] my rightousness. [music]
[55:16] Oh God, how [singing] I hear
[55:19] you.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; You're my one
[55:25] defense,
[55:27] my rightousness. [singing]
[55:30] Oh God, how I
[55:39] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Blessed be the name of the
[55:42] Lord.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[55:48] [clears throat]
[55:49] Believe that's our prayer.
[55:51] Lord, we need [music] you.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; But where sin runs deep, his grace is
[55:58] more.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Where grace [music] is found is where he
[56:03] is.
[56:06] He gives us not just grace isn't just
[56:10] pardon.
[56:12] Grace is also himself. He gives us that
[56:15] which we have need of. Uh first John I
[56:18] think it's 1:9 is that he is faithful
[56:21] and just to forgive us all of our sins
[56:23] [music] and to cleanse us from all
[56:25] unrighteousness. So it's not just
[56:27] forgiveness,
[56:29] but there also a power to [music]
[56:31] cleanse. And he is that power to
[56:33] cleanse. Amen. Praise the Lord. While
[56:35] you're standing, uh, if you would turn
[56:37] to 1 Corinthians chapter [music] 6, I
[56:39] don't know if we can switch to the
[56:41] slides.
[56:42] Is it connected?
[56:48] Kind of the first time we've done it
[56:49] this way. Oh, there we go. It's a black
[56:51] screen.
[56:53] That means it's working.
[56:56] Okay. 1 Corinthians chapter 6 and verse
[56:59] [clears throat] 12.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Just would like to remind you that this
[57:05] is the Apostle Paul that we will be
[57:09] discussing this morning.
[57:12] And it is the Apostle Paul that is
[57:14] writing this. And he says, "All things
[57:15] are lawful for me, but all things are
[57:18] not expedient. All things are lawful for
[57:21] me, but I will not be brought under the
[57:24] power of any." If you also go down to
[57:26] verse 19,
[57:29] verse 19 says, "What know ye not that
[57:32] your body is the temple of the Holy
[57:35] Ghost, which is in you, which ye have of
[57:38] God, and ye are not your own?"
[57:41] &gt;&gt; I'd like to just make [clears throat]
[57:43] one statement here. If your body is the
[57:46] temple of the Holy Ghost,
[57:49] &gt;&gt; then your body is not the Holy Ghost.
[57:55] That'll some It's morning.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; It's early coffee kick in. Let's Okay.
[58:02] Praise the Lord. Okay. So, we'll dive
[58:05] into that a little deeper. If you want
[58:06] to know my meaning on that, we will get
[58:08] there. Um 1 Corinthians 15, if you would
[58:11] a few uh chapters farther, [snorts]
[58:19] [clears throat]
[58:21] I protest 15:31. I protest by your
[58:24] rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus
[58:26] our Lord. I die daily.
[58:31] So we have Paul telling us that he
[58:34] doesn't want to be brought under the
[58:36] power even if it's a good maybe it's a
[58:38] good thing maybe it's a bad thing he
[58:40] doesn't want to be brought under the
[58:41] power of anything.
[58:43] The [clears throat] apostle Paul
[58:46] if the apostle Paul is saying I don't
[58:48] want to be brought under the power of
[58:49] anything that means he is subject to be
[58:52] able to be brought under the power of
[58:54] something
[58:55] &gt;&gt; all right first church age messenger
[58:58] okay um then if your body is the temple
[59:00] of the Holy Ghost then your body is not
[59:03] the Holy Ghost that means your body I
[59:06] don't know you it might have struggles
[59:11] &gt;&gt; amen okay and so and And then if Paul is
[59:14] saying, "I die daily,
[59:19] that must mean that the apostle Paul is
[59:21] also struggling within himself over
[59:24] these various things that may cause him
[59:26] that that he's saying, I I don't want to
[59:28] be brought under the power of this, so
[59:30] I'm going to die daily to that thing."
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Which means there's a war going on
[59:34] within even the Apostle Paul.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Okay, let's pray. Heavenly Father, as we
[59:40] look to your scriptures, we look to the
[59:42] things your prophet has said for us in
[59:44] our age, I pray, Lord God, that you
[59:46] would anoint us to hear, Lord God, that
[59:48] we would hear the grace of Jesus Christ
[59:50] coming down, Lord God, that that we
[59:52] would see our part in the word, Lord
[59:54] God, and what you have done with us uh
[59:56] for us, oh God. And Lord, we look to
[59:59] you, Lord. We need you. We need your
[1:00:00] grace. We need your love. And this is a
[1:00:02] late hour, Lord God. and you've given us
[1:00:04] every resource you've given us of
[1:00:06] yourself that you have made yourself
[1:00:09] known, unveiled yourself to us that we
[1:00:11] might know you in your fullness and who
[1:00:14] you really are, Lord God. And that that
[1:00:16] picture, God, would captivate our
[1:00:18] hearts, oh God, and draw us into you.
[1:00:21] Bless uh your people now and bless your
[1:00:23] word. We ask in the name of the Lord
[1:00:25] Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be seated.
[1:00:28] [cough and clears throat]
[1:00:29] So um because we have started here in 1
[1:00:32] Corinthians uh we are going to be
[1:00:34] talking about Romans chapter 7 and so
[1:00:38] I no one really is it that early like
[1:00:42] you all I just so so for the 11 of you
[1:00:45] and those who don't raise your hand in
[1:00:46] church um just you know I'm gonna need
[1:00:49] you to relax a little bit this morning
[1:00:51] and you know because here's what I need
[1:00:53] you to what I'm gonna do is just do
[1:00:54] everything I can to absolutely get you
[1:00:57] so relaxed that you don't see it when it
[1:00:59] comes and hits you. And so, okay. So, I
[1:01:03] just need we're going to you're going to
[1:01:05] work with me a little bit here. So,
[1:01:06] okay. So, don't don't make us do Father
[1:01:09] Abraham to wake you up now. This, okay,
[1:01:12] cuz it's just not that youth meeting.
[1:01:13] So, anyway, I thought that was kind of a
[1:01:16] little switcheroo. We started in first
[1:01:17] Corinthians and then the brother is
[1:01:18] going to talk about Romans 7. Maybe
[1:01:20] they'd go, "Wait, what?" And no one
[1:01:22] seemed to give me that reaction and I
[1:01:24] I'm premeditated to get that reaction.
[1:01:26] And so now I'm I need help. So, okay.
[1:01:31] So, all right, we're together now. So, I
[1:01:32] want to talk about Romans chapter 7. And
[1:01:34] I, you know, I was talking to a friend
[1:01:36] of mine the other day and I was just,
[1:01:38] you know, I was just like, "Oh, you know
[1:01:39] what? Like, you know, it's Romans 7."
[1:01:41] You know, I just this and this and this.
[1:01:42] He's like, he's like, "I hate you so
[1:01:44] much, brother." And I was like, "That's
[1:01:46] nice. Praise the Lord." You know, he's
[1:01:48] like, "Cuz you're you're just, you know,
[1:01:49] you what's Romans 7?" You know, like
[1:01:52] you're just talking about Romans 7 like
[1:01:54] it's the most natural thing ever. and I
[1:01:56] don't know what you're talking about,
[1:01:58] you know, and well, I was like, but I
[1:02:00] preached this at your church like two
[1:02:02] weeks ago. Like, but
[1:02:06] I don't know what happened. But anyway,
[1:02:08] but but more than just that, more than
[1:02:10] just like, don't you remember what I
[1:02:11] preached two weeks ago? How I'm so
[1:02:12] offended. But but no, it's like to me
[1:02:15] Romans 7 is like like from the time I
[1:02:17] was 16 to the time I was like 24. And it
[1:02:20] probably didn't end it definitely didn't
[1:02:22] end there. But I feel like that like
[1:02:23] through those years like I lived Romans
[1:02:26] 7 like this that Ro what Paul talks
[1:02:29] about in Romans chapter 7 was such I
[1:02:31] mean it was just like you know it's you
[1:02:34] know the phrase I heard not too long ago
[1:02:36] the book read me
[1:02:38] you know I didn't have to read the book
[1:02:40] the book read me and I was like okay you
[1:02:42] know and I just feel like this oh I
[1:02:43] should start my timer oh I got free
[1:02:45] extra five minutes anyway and so so so
[1:02:48] like so I just lived in that you know
[1:02:50] and and so now
[1:02:52] Okay. Are you going to ever tell us you
[1:02:54] know what Romans 7 was so personal to
[1:02:56] you? We get it. Fine. What exactly was
[1:02:58] Romans 7? And maybe you've turned in
[1:03:00] your Bible there and maybe you haven't.
[1:03:04] Nobody's going to turn pages in the
[1:03:06] Bible. This is man, this is going to be
[1:03:10] work today here. So, okay. There's
[1:03:12] there's nuance. There's a lot of
[1:03:13] suggestive stuff that I just expect that
[1:03:16] you'll be like, "Oh, yeah. I get it.
[1:03:17] Thank you, sister. God bless you.
[1:03:19] Appreciate you. Alaska is representing
[1:03:21] today. Okay. So, Romans 7, we have we
[1:03:24] have so the title then Romans 7, that
[1:03:26] which I do, I allow not. Now, this is
[1:03:28] this is the passage where, you know, my
[1:03:30] wife um she would when we we first got
[1:03:32] married, she's like, "Oh, yeah. That's
[1:03:34] that that's that Shakespeareian, you
[1:03:36] know, Paul is, you know, it's just it's
[1:03:38] like is it it's this it's like I do I
[1:03:40] don't I don't do I do I do I I just get
[1:03:42] so lost." And so, that's what we want to
[1:03:44] do is we want to look at at that at that
[1:03:46] passage. So,
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; are we together today? Yes.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Okay. Praise the Lord. So, Romans
[1:03:51] chapter 7, let's turn and let's look at
[1:03:53] verse 14.
[1:03:55] And Paul says, "For we know that the law
[1:03:57] is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold
[1:03:59] under sin. For that which I do, I allow
[1:04:02] not. For what I would, that do I not,
[1:04:05] but what I hate, that do I. If then I do
[1:04:07] that which I would not, I consent to the
[1:04:09] law that it is good." Take a breath.
[1:04:11] Now, then it is no more I that do it,
[1:04:12] but sin that doeth in me. For I know
[1:04:14] that in me that is in my flesh, dwelleth
[1:04:16] no good thing. For to will is present
[1:04:18] with me to how to form I find which I
[1:04:20] find everybody together are we good like
[1:04:22] you all are following perfectly right
[1:04:24] you have 100% understanding of exactly
[1:04:26] what Paul is saying here okay praise the
[1:04:29] Lord I like how some people said it and
[1:04:32] then shook their head no at the same
[1:04:33] time. So for the good that I would I do
[1:04:37] not but the evil which I would not that
[1:04:39] I do. Don't worry we'll slow it down and
[1:04:41] break it down here in a moment. But now
[1:04:43] if I do that I would not. It is no more
[1:04:45] I that do it, but that sin that dwelleth
[1:04:46] in me. I find then a law that when I
[1:04:48] would do good, evil is present with me.
[1:04:50] For I delight in the law of God after
[1:04:52] the inward man. But I see another law in
[1:04:54] my members, waring against the law of my
[1:04:56] mind, bringing me into captivity to the
[1:04:59] law of sin which is in my members. I
[1:05:01] love this next verse because this next
[1:05:03] verse, Paul gives us language to speak
[1:05:07] exactly how we're feeling. And I really
[1:05:09] appreciate him for that. Oh wretched man
[1:05:10] that I am, who shall deliver me from the
[1:05:13] body of this death? Like how many times
[1:05:15] have you failed and done something you
[1:05:17] knew better and then just thought
[1:05:20] and then Paul comes along and and so he
[1:05:22] gives you language you're like yeah Lord
[1:05:26] I'm a wretched man
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; I need I who is going to like I failed
[1:05:31] again who is going to deliver me Lord
[1:05:33] because obviously I'm not doing such a
[1:05:36] good job myself
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; I thank God through Jesus Christ our
[1:05:42] Lord so then with mine
[1:05:45] uh I myself serve the law of God, but
[1:05:46] with the flesh the law of the spirit. So
[1:05:49] let's come back here to verse 15 and
[1:05:50] let's let's just let's just talk through
[1:05:52] this a little bit. And and so for that
[1:05:54] which I do, I allow not. So I'm going to
[1:05:58] go over here and I'm going to do this
[1:05:59] thing, but I know I shouldn't. I don't
[1:06:03] want to do this thing. And then then the
[1:06:05] question comes like, well, if you don't
[1:06:06] want to do that thing, why are you doing
[1:06:08] that thing?
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Man, that's a good question.
[1:06:14] I don't want I know I know better. I
[1:06:15] don't want to. But man, here I am doing
[1:06:19] the thing and and for what I would the
[1:06:23] things that I I know,
[1:06:25] you know, we can go back to brother
[1:06:26] George last night reading your Bible and
[1:06:28] praying, you know, and I know I I I want
[1:06:32] to do that every day. Lord, you know my
[1:06:34] heart. I want to read my Bible and pray
[1:06:37] every day. And so Lord, I got up early
[1:06:40] and and I opened my Bible, but I got a
[1:06:45] text message and it just really quick
[1:06:47] thought, I'm going to just deal with
[1:06:48] that thing really. It won't it just take
[1:06:50] two seconds. I'm just going to deal with
[1:06:52] that and then my whole attention can be
[1:06:54] back on the word.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; And the next thing you know,
[1:06:58] you're late for work
[1:07:01] and the thing that you knew you should
[1:07:02] do, you didn't do it.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; And so you're like, I'm doing the thing.
[1:07:06] I I know I don't want to do this and I'm
[1:07:08] doing this and I I don't want to do I I
[1:07:11] you know I know I know I should do this
[1:07:12] but I'm not doing that. [snorts]
[1:07:17] You see I now you understand why I was
[1:07:19] so very familiar with most of my life
[1:07:21] with Romans chapter 7. It's like Paul
[1:07:23] like what are you doing here? Like
[1:07:26] why does this have to be true? Can't we
[1:07:29] Is there a way out? What can I do Lord?
[1:07:32] But that which I hate, like, oh my
[1:07:34] goodness, not only do I not want to do
[1:07:36] this thing, I hate this thing.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Hate it.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah, let's we should, you know, let's
[1:07:43] do this.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Anybody ever been there?
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Is Yeah. Yeah. This guy, he's been
[1:07:51] there.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; So
[1:07:54] anyway, praise the Lord. Is it
[1:07:57] uncomfortable at all? Are we good? Like,
[1:07:59] okay. So just you we'll just let the
[1:08:01] word continue to read us. That's fine.
[1:08:03] So
[1:08:06] so this
[1:08:08] just remind us who is speaking.
[1:08:12] The apostle Paul,
[1:08:14] right?
[1:08:16] So the apostle Paul is saying I I hate
[1:08:18] this thing. Hey, let's go. Let's let's
[1:08:21] do this.
[1:08:23] Like this is not [laughter]
[1:08:27] like but Paul the apostle the first
[1:08:29] church age messenger. I remind you in in
[1:08:31] Revelations chapter 1 we see a vision of
[1:08:34] Christ and in his hand the the seed of
[1:08:37] power and authority there are seven
[1:08:39] stars in that right hand. And one of
[1:08:41] them is the Apostle Paul who is telling
[1:08:43] us the things I hate those are the
[1:08:46] things I'm doing.
[1:08:49] So maybe next time you find yourself
[1:08:51] doing something you hate, you can
[1:08:53] remember that.
[1:08:56] It's normal.
[1:09:00] And you [laughter]
[1:09:02] I'm one of those different preachers, I
[1:09:04] guess. Maybe sometimes like, no,
[1:09:07] maybe you weren't expecting a preacher
[1:09:09] to tell you that when you're doing the
[1:09:10] thing that you hate, that's actually
[1:09:11] normal. I didn't say it was good. I
[1:09:14] didn't say it was righteous. I didn't
[1:09:16] say it was holy. But I did say it was
[1:09:18] normal and I and I and Paul is telling
[1:09:20] us it happens to him too. So So just so
[1:09:23] that you know, you're not a special kind
[1:09:26] of sinful
[1:09:27] if you find yourself in Romans chapter 7
[1:09:30] living life doing doing things you hate,
[1:09:33] not doing things you know you should do
[1:09:35] and that you do actually want to do and
[1:09:37] finding yourself just caught between
[1:09:40] pulled in all these directions screaming
[1:09:42] out, "God, I am so wretched. How can I
[1:09:45] get deliverance? God, then I would just
[1:09:47] like you to know you're normal.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; No, you know what? You're not you're not
[1:09:52] even normal. You're like, you're living
[1:09:55] life on the level of the first church
[1:09:57] age messenger. Man,
[1:10:00] that's some kind of spiritual there. You
[1:10:03] never thought you could. It's like,
[1:10:04] yeah, but could I have done that for my
[1:10:06] revelation
[1:10:08] and not for my failures?
[1:10:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:10:16] So, but [clears throat] I thought as I'm
[1:10:19] as I was putting this service, this
[1:10:20] sermon together and I thought, you know,
[1:10:22] I I was I was searching for some things
[1:10:24] on my phone and and I just happened to
[1:10:26] come across um a text message that I had
[1:10:29] received from a sister uh quite quite
[1:10:31] some time ago who was struggling and and
[1:10:35] she she needed some advice
[1:10:38] and uh so I just happened to be
[1:10:40] searching and I just ca I just, you
[1:10:42] know, randomly
[1:10:44] came across This probably was the spirit
[1:10:46] of the Lord driving me to this thing,
[1:10:47] but it seemed random at the time. And I
[1:10:50] came across this text message and I
[1:10:51] thought, Lord, this is just this is so
[1:10:53] nice. This is really perfect because,
[1:10:55] you know, we look at this and that which
[1:10:57] I do I don't allow and I hate and I do
[1:10:58] and I don't and and and it's just it can
[1:11:01] it can it can get away from us sometimes
[1:11:03] because it doesn't really, you know, it
[1:11:05] just seems so, you know, Paul, break it
[1:11:07] down a little bit. just make so so this
[1:11:09] sister uh asking me for this advice,
[1:11:13] she rewrote Romans 7 without knowing it
[1:11:17] in 2025 language. And so I thought this
[1:11:20] would be really good to share and for us
[1:11:22] to work through and think about a letter
[1:11:24] from a young sister. Hello, brother
[1:11:26] Trevor. I'm so and so. I'm sorry for
[1:11:27] disturbing you. This is something I
[1:11:29] would like to talk to you about. You
[1:11:30] see, I have been a Christian my whole
[1:11:33] life.
[1:11:37] Three people on that side of the church,
[1:11:39] man. Everybody else is recent converts.
[1:11:43] Okay. How many have been a Christian
[1:11:45] your whole life
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; there? Okay. All right. All right.
[1:11:48] Praise the Lord. Get just don't get
[1:11:50] comfortable because we're going to like
[1:11:52] there's about four more times where I'm
[1:11:54] going to ask you to identify here. Okay.
[1:11:57] I was born in the message.
[1:12:01] Okay. Three people, five on that side.
[1:12:02] Now, okay. That's see when I pause
[1:12:06] you all because it's obvious that you
[1:12:08] all haven't heard me preach before.
[1:12:10] Okay. When I pause and look up that's
[1:12:11] that's calls pause for effect and that
[1:12:14] that is now your that is an indication
[1:12:16] to you that you should respond to that
[1:12:18] moment. Okay. So now I was born in the
[1:12:22] message.
[1:12:23] Okay. Okay. That's f fantastic.
[1:12:26] And all my life I tried to live a
[1:12:29] Christian life.
[1:12:31] Okay. See, that's nice. See, I got
[1:12:34] baptized at 13 years old in the name of
[1:12:37] the Lord Jesus Christ, and I always
[1:12:39] tried to live how I ought to.
[1:12:42] Okay? Even if it was 12, 14, somewhere
[1:12:44] in there, we'll take it. Okay? So,
[1:12:47] so, so it doesn't even matter who this
[1:12:51] sister is because this is many of you
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; so far. This is actually all of us.
[1:12:58] Maybe in just some ways
[1:13:00] this is where we're at. However, I
[1:13:04] started to go downhill since a few
[1:13:06] weeks. No, don't raise your hand. Um,
[1:13:08] there was a Praise the Lord. There was a
[1:13:11] time I felt far from God because of sin.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you can raise your hand on that
[1:13:16] one.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Have you ever felt that way? God, I
[1:13:20] just,
[1:13:21] you know, this is me, Lord, you know,
[1:13:24] and I feel far away from you. And as a
[1:13:27] matter of fact, I'm pretty much good
[1:13:28] with that because, you know, I should
[1:13:31] feel far away from you because of what
[1:13:33] I've just done. Has anybody ever felt
[1:13:35] that way? We'll talk about that here in
[1:13:36] a minute. We'll let her say it. Not me.
[1:13:38] Um, so I would be ashamed and I would
[1:13:42] feel too bad to pray and go to church.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Anybody ever felt that way before?
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:13:51] I sinned and did something I knew I
[1:13:54] could not do. but still did it.
[1:13:59] Romans 7.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; I can't do that. Let's go.
[1:14:06] Right.
[1:14:08] And after doing it, I would feel bad and
[1:14:11] ask for forgiveness.
[1:14:13] But then
[1:14:15] when I'm in the situation again,
[1:14:19] I would fall again
[1:14:22] and sin again.
[1:14:27] Romans 7.
[1:14:32] What advice would we give?
[1:14:36] What do we tell someone who's caught in
[1:14:38] this cycle, who's raised in the message,
[1:14:41] knows everything that's right, was
[1:14:43] baptized, had this heart that just God,
[1:14:46] I just wanted to serve you, and then and
[1:14:48] then over the process of time found
[1:14:50] themselves,
[1:14:52] I don't want to do this thing. I know
[1:14:54] it's not right, but it's but here we
[1:14:58] are.
[1:15:01] What do we tell them?
[1:15:04] Stinks to be you.
[1:15:09] So, I pause here so that you know um
[1:15:11] this is a rhetorical question. If my
[1:15:12] pastor was here, he'd try to answer.
[1:15:14] But, you know, the idea is the idea a
[1:15:16] rhetorical question is that which you're
[1:15:18] not it's a question you're not really
[1:15:19] supposed to answer. Uh just it's a it's
[1:15:21] an English lesson and a sermon. Anyway,
[1:15:23] um and so and so, you know, but but it
[1:15:26] is to say that like I want you thinking
[1:15:28] like what answer would I give? What if
[1:15:30] one of my friends came to me and began
[1:15:32] to say, "I need help and this is what
[1:15:34] I'm struggling with. What is our
[1:15:35] answer?"
[1:15:37] And so often, you know what we would
[1:15:39] say? Well, you know, you need more of
[1:15:41] the Lord.
[1:15:44] That's that's I need to read my Bible
[1:15:46] and pray every exactly. I want to do
[1:15:48] that every morning. I just don't because
[1:15:51] Romans 7.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. That's you. I'm
[1:15:59] going to preach to you all. That's nice.
[1:16:01] So,
[1:16:03] all right.
[1:16:06] I know you need to get away for a while
[1:16:09] and really strengthen. you need to get
[1:16:11] away from the situation that you're in
[1:16:12] because it's causing some problems and
[1:16:15] uh and you need to really, you know,
[1:16:17] spend some time strengthening and
[1:16:19] getting close with the Lord. What you
[1:16:21] need is you need to go to a church camp.
[1:16:27] That's what you need.
[1:16:29] And is that, you know, I mean, would
[1:16:31] that be nice? Would that be helpful?
[1:16:32] Like, hey, let's take a week. go, you
[1:16:35] know, go to meetings, get in the
[1:16:37] presence of God, get away from the
[1:16:39] situation you're in.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Not bad.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Hey, let's try that. Okay. So, I was
[1:16:46] hoping I might change at the camp
[1:16:50] and stop doing what I was doing and
[1:16:52] become a better Christian
[1:16:55] and that God would forgive me. So, I
[1:16:57] prayed and cried and I felt blessed.
[1:17:04] And
[1:17:08] anybody ever had this happen to you at
[1:17:10] camp,
[1:17:12] right? [laughter]
[1:17:13] God bless you, brother Trevor.
[1:17:16] I have never said that from the pulpit
[1:17:18] before. Ever. It's just so fun. Anyway,
[1:17:24] and I thought to myself, I am not
[1:17:28] falling again. I would not permit it to
[1:17:31] happen again. I felt so good again. But
[1:17:35] then getting back home,
[1:17:38] I fell in the same situation
[1:17:42] again
[1:17:44] and I sinned
[1:17:46] again. You don't have to raise your
[1:17:48] hands. Most of you were nodding
[1:17:52] that you've been there.
[1:17:55] I just get angry at myself and cry and I
[1:17:59] think I should not pray because God has
[1:18:01] to be upset and I'm scared he would
[1:18:04] punish me.
[1:18:08] [snorts]
[1:18:09] Right. Okay.
[1:18:11] I just don't know what to do now because
[1:18:14] I feel so bad that I was blessed at the
[1:18:16] camp and that God forgave me and now
[1:18:18] it's like I threw all away by falling
[1:18:21] and sinning again. Now it's like I try
[1:18:23] to hide from God. The flesh desires are
[1:18:26] just strong and I do and I do what I
[1:18:29] don't want to do.
[1:18:33] Romans here she is just just Romans 7.
[1:18:37] I'm doing that thing I don't want to do.
[1:18:42] Because when I'm in the situation,
[1:18:46] it feels like I'm not myself and I don't
[1:18:50] feel bad in the moment.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; This is us. This is every single person
[1:19:01] in this building.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; This has happened to us time and time
[1:19:08] again.
[1:19:13] But when I come back to myself, I start
[1:19:16] to cry, get angry at myself. Please,
[1:19:19] could you help me because I'm scared. I
[1:19:22] get punished by God and he won't give me
[1:19:24] his blessings because of my attitude. I
[1:19:27] really don't know what I should do now.
[1:19:31] Now, maybe you've been here. Maybe you
[1:19:34] are here.
[1:19:39] Maybe you are so Romans 7ing right now
[1:19:43] that you just I mean you are just so
[1:19:46] tired of the up and down and the altar
[1:19:50] and the sin and the that which way is up
[1:19:55] which way is down the devil chirping in
[1:19:57] your ear. You know the devil loves to
[1:19:59] use this scripture u when you're when
[1:20:02] you're in Romans 7. He loves to use this
[1:20:03] one. See, if you love the world or if
[1:20:06] you love the Lord, then the love of the
[1:20:08] world isn't isn't even in you.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; So, uh, and you're doing this thing,
[1:20:17] so you obviously love it. So, that means
[1:20:20] the love of the Lord is not even in you.
[1:20:21] And if it's not in you now, it's I,
[1:20:23] yeah, you're probably never going to get
[1:20:24] it.
[1:20:27] Or maybe just that's the one the devil
[1:20:28] used on me.
[1:20:31] Right.
[1:20:33] Right?
[1:20:34] And so here you find yourself and now
[1:20:36] you're screaming out to God, God, I am
[1:20:38] so wretched. I am such a wretched man.
[1:20:41] Who is going to deliver me from the body
[1:20:43] of this death, Lord? Because because
[1:20:45] frankly, frankly, they, you know, like
[1:20:48] some people pay to have, you know, you
[1:20:50] know, in the stained glass or whatever,
[1:20:51] they they pay for the stained glass and
[1:20:53] they have, you know, their name etched
[1:20:54] in it. And it's just like, well,
[1:20:55] frankly, Lord, I'm planning on paying
[1:20:57] for a cushion to be installed at my
[1:20:59] altar,
[1:21:02] cuz I'm there so often and I'm so tired
[1:21:05] of it, God.
[1:21:09] See, it gets a little quiet. And the
[1:21:11] reason it gets quiet in these kind of
[1:21:12] moments is nobody's shouting is because
[1:21:14] everybody's going like, "Oh my goodness,
[1:21:19] this is me. I've been there. The apostle
[1:21:23] Paul has been there.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; So, [clears throat]
[1:21:29] so this is this is the wonderful thing
[1:21:31] about being a youth leader and about
[1:21:33] going and preaching youth camps and
[1:21:36] is you get texts like this that and now
[1:21:38] you're the guy you got to
[1:21:42] you know you were about to sister get
[1:21:44] away to a good camp that'll help you
[1:21:46] strengthen you a little bit. But inside
[1:21:48] of her message tells you you can't use
[1:21:50] that answer.
[1:21:56] So you got to so so we got to understand
[1:21:58] then like what is going on and what is
[1:22:01] the like where do we start? How do we we
[1:22:04] all right like what is it actually that
[1:22:06] we're trying to do? What is it that we
[1:22:08] want to have? And really what we're
[1:22:09] coming to the answer is is that we want
[1:22:11] to be righteous.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; We don't want to to do the things that
[1:22:16] we hate. Why? Because we want to be
[1:22:18] righteous. We want to be good before
[1:22:19] God. We want to do the things we want to
[1:22:22] do. We want to do right things. We don't
[1:22:25] want to do not right things. That's a
[1:22:28] double negative, but it worked better.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Okay. Praise the Lord. Another English.
[1:22:32] That's fine. Okay. So, so, so, so, but,
[1:22:35] but what's going on is what we're
[1:22:37] actually wanting is we're wanting, Lord,
[1:22:39] I want to be delivered from this. I
[1:22:40] want, I want to find myself in
[1:22:42] righteousness. I want to find my body in
[1:22:45] harmony with with the desires of the
[1:22:48] inside. you because because we recognize
[1:22:51] my body is the temple. It is not the
[1:22:53] Holy Ghost. And that's where we find
[1:22:55] oursel now, right? Is your body is you
[1:22:58] find a duality here where it's like I
[1:23:00] hate this thing. What do you hate this
[1:23:02] thing with? Well, with the spirit of God
[1:23:04] and the desires on the inside of me. I
[1:23:06] hate this thing, but this flesh,
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; it's not the Holy Ghost,
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; but the Holy Ghost is inside it,
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; but it's pulled. It's drawn. It needs to
[1:23:20] die daily,
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; right? Right. Somebody's got to do that.
[1:23:24] That's hard. Takes a lot of work. So,
[1:23:26] the idea then is righteousness. And so,
[1:23:29] well, so that's that's interesting. So,
[1:23:31] okay, how do we get from Romans 7 into
[1:23:33] righteousness? maybe that's actually our
[1:23:35] question that we're dealing with. And so
[1:23:37] I I I sent her a text message and and I
[1:23:41] I replied and I said, "Is I want you to
[1:23:44] read this quote every day for the next
[1:23:47] two weeks. And I want you to read Romans
[1:23:49] 5 through8."
[1:23:51] And so and and I I didn't send her this
[1:23:54] quote to tell her to read it every day
[1:23:56] for two weeks because, you know, it's
[1:23:58] some kind of mantra she should say and
[1:24:00] repeat to herself and that will somehow
[1:24:02] deliver you and drive demons away. And
[1:24:04] none of that. No. No, it wasn't that. It
[1:24:08] was because I wanted the word of God to
[1:24:10] saturate her heart.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; This is the quote I sent. 560414 blind
[1:24:18] Barnameus. Now, God will never judge you
[1:24:21] for being a sinner.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Well, that's nice.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; But he should. No, but he's never going
[1:24:30] to. I don't care what you think about
[1:24:32] it. I don't care how badly you think you
[1:24:35] should be judged.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; God will never [screaming]
[1:24:38] judge you for being a sinner. He can't
[1:24:41] judge you because sin was paid for at
[1:24:44] Calvary. And you're not a sinner. You
[1:24:47] are a rejector. See, he judges you for
[1:24:50] rejecting salvation when it's been
[1:24:52] offered to you. But G when he saw him,
[1:24:55] he said, "Behold the lamb of God that
[1:25:00] takes away the sin of the world." You
[1:25:03] have to ask yourself a question. Was
[1:25:05] John right or not?
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Because if John was right, then the lamb
[1:25:12] of God took away the sins of the world.
[1:25:16] Amen.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Either the lamb of God did or the lamb
[1:25:20] of God didn't. Which one is it for you?
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; And all sin question
[1:25:31] was settled
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; at Calvary.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; I wanted her to read this every day for
[1:25:40] two weeks. All sin question was settled
[1:25:45] at Calvary.
[1:25:49] Your sin question is part of all. So
[1:25:52] we'll just say it that way. Your sin
[1:25:55] question was settled at Calvary. When
[1:25:57] you get home and you look in the mirror
[1:25:59] tonight, maybe you should look at
[1:26:00] yourself in the mirror and tell
[1:26:02] yourself, "All of my sin question was
[1:26:05] settled at Calvary. My sin question was
[1:26:09] settled at Calvary. G the the lamb of
[1:26:11] God took away the sins of the world.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; The lamb of God took away my sin. Should
[1:26:18] I want to accept it? You see, it comes
[1:26:21] down to, do you have faith to accept in
[1:26:24] these moments that God took away your
[1:26:26] sin? No matter how good you are at it,
[1:26:29] no matter how bad you are at it, he took
[1:26:32] it away anyway from before the
[1:26:34] foundation of the world.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Did he know you?
[1:26:41] At what point in your life did he know
[1:26:43] you from before the foundation of the
[1:26:45] world?
[1:26:48] [laughter]
[1:26:49] You see, you see God.
[1:26:52] Oh, this one's fresh. God, you know, we
[1:26:55] like like think about this though.
[1:26:56] Before the foundation of the world, what
[1:26:58] like what did he see about you? What did
[1:27:00] he know about you? You know, this is
[1:27:02] part of the problem of our Instagram and
[1:27:04] you know, snappy chat. Yeah, I know. I
[1:27:09] know. But it it makes me sound old when
[1:27:12] I'm not actually that old and so and
[1:27:14] then the youth grown at that. Anyway,
[1:27:16] but my sons hate it. But anyhow, you
[1:27:19] know, it's because we have these, you
[1:27:20] know, and then we have these filters and
[1:27:22] we do all of these things, right? And we
[1:27:23] present an image before everybody else
[1:27:25] that we want everyone to see. And of
[1:27:27] course, it's the same way with God,
[1:27:29] right? Like before the foundation of the
[1:27:31] world, he saw what I wanted him to see.
[1:27:38] It's like we like Yeah. It sounded dumb
[1:27:40] when I said it, right? Yeah. Yeah. It's
[1:27:42] No. Like, of course not. No. No. He saw
[1:27:45] you on your best day and Yes. That's
[1:27:47] what we It's like God, you saw me on my
[1:27:49] best day and that's why you left me. No.
[1:27:53] He saw you on your worst day and still
[1:27:55] decided to die on the cross for you.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; And here's the thing. Your worst day m
[1:28:02] may may not have happened yet, but he
[1:28:05] still died for you anyway. He still took
[1:28:07] away the sins of the world.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; And the sin question was settled at
[1:28:12] Calvary. So God knew all of this from
[1:28:14] before the foundation of the world. This
[1:28:17] isn't new to him.
[1:28:19] He's not he's just like, "Oh man,
[1:28:22] you know,
[1:28:24] Daniel, [sighs]
[1:28:26] like we're at we're at six times. If you
[1:28:28] get to seven, I'm going to have to
[1:28:30] rethink my dying for you on Calvary
[1:28:33] because that's just extreme.
[1:28:39] But yeah, brother Trevor, you're talking
[1:28:41] about seven times. I was like, and then
[1:28:43] Peter came and said, "How many times
[1:28:45] should I forgive my brother?" 70* 7. And
[1:28:48] oh, wow. It's like 490. It's like, well,
[1:28:51] okay. So the statute of limitations on
[1:28:54] God forgiving you of sins must be around
[1:28:56] 490 as well then.
[1:28:59] But woe be unto you if you get to 491.
[1:29:07] Behold the lamb of God that takes away
[1:29:10] the sins of the world of all those who
[1:29:12] do it less than 490 times
[1:29:17] is not what the scripture says but is
[1:29:20] exactly what we think in our minds isn't
[1:29:23] it isn't after after we fall after we
[1:29:25] fail and we find ourselves just flat in
[1:29:28] the dirt we're sitting there going it's
[1:29:30] over for me
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; I can't it'sm no like God couldn't do it
[1:29:35] for me cuz cuz I'm I'm a special kind of
[1:29:38] bad.
[1:29:40] I've gone over the limitations.
[1:29:48] How does he think these thoughts that
[1:29:49] I've had? Cuz I've had them.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; We all have had them. This is all of us.
[1:29:57] And we all find ourselves right here
[1:29:59] just hanging out with the Apostle Paul.
[1:30:03] And if the Apostle Paul would be sitting
[1:30:05] here, he'd just be like, I know, right?
[1:30:08] I mean, that's what I was that's what I
[1:30:10] was writing about. Drives me nuts.
[1:30:19] She responded, "This helped me a lot. I
[1:30:22] was worried because I felt like I would
[1:30:24] throw the grace of God away by sinning
[1:30:27] again and again.
[1:30:29] And I really need God's help and the
[1:30:31] strength to resist the desires of the
[1:30:32] flesh. Oh, I I will stop here for just a
[1:30:35] moment because what another thing that I
[1:30:37] I started to tell her is like, you know,
[1:30:39] you you you used to feel like, you know,
[1:30:43] it was so easy to serve the Lord when
[1:30:45] you were younger. You know, it was just
[1:30:47] like, man, I love the Lord. I love
[1:30:49] serving the Lord, you know, and then
[1:30:51] you, you know, and then the teenage
[1:30:53] years came and just smacked you upside
[1:30:55] the head. And then, you know, because
[1:30:57] everything used to be black and white
[1:30:59] and now like there's black and there's
[1:31:00] white, but there's a whole lot of gray
[1:31:02] in between now.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; And that's good and we want it that way.
[1:31:06] But that's another sermon because if
[1:31:08] everything was just black and white, you
[1:31:09] could be a legalist and and think you
[1:31:11] have a relationship with God.
[1:31:15] Okay. Anyway, I don't know if that
[1:31:16] landed or not, but that sounds lame to
[1:31:18] me and I don't want that. And that's not
[1:31:21] what this message is proclaiming is that
[1:31:23] God has, you know, things that he wants
[1:31:25] you to do and things that he doesn't
[1:31:26] want you to do and you can just can you
[1:31:27] just do that? No, that's Baptist. That's
[1:31:30] that's just Baptist theology. And if you
[1:31:31] don't do it, you're going to hell.
[1:31:34] [sighs] Or if you do too much of this,
[1:31:35] you're going to hell.
[1:31:37] It's like that's Christianity, right?
[1:31:39] No.
[1:31:40] No. Not [laughter] when not when he's
[1:31:43] coming and saying I want a bride.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; When he comes and says I want a bride
[1:31:48] and by the way when he comes in the book
[1:31:49] of revelation to say I want a bride what
[1:31:51] that does and that gets revealed to us
[1:31:54] what that does is it makes manifest the
[1:31:56] idea that before the foundation of the
[1:31:58] world that's always what God wanted
[1:32:00] anyway.
[1:32:02] So he was never, you know, he was never
[1:32:04] some, you know, mean looking old guy
[1:32:08] sitting on a throne
[1:32:11] waiting to punish you for your sins.
[1:32:15] No, he was always the one that wants you
[1:32:18] to be his bride.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; That's who he always was. That's what
[1:32:22] his heart always was. That's what this
[1:32:24] message is telling us. Amen. And so, so
[1:32:27] I began to tell her, anyway, that's on
[1:32:29] grace. But anyway, I began to, you know,
[1:32:31] I I was telling her it's like, and so
[1:32:32] you got into this gray zone because as
[1:32:35] you got older, you know, your brain
[1:32:36] starts developing and all these, you
[1:32:38] know, hormones and chemicals and all
[1:32:40] these things start happening in your
[1:32:42] brain and now it's a lot harder to make
[1:32:43] decisions because the world has become a
[1:32:45] whole lot bigger and and your and your
[1:32:48] and your desires and your you know, your
[1:32:50] passions got a whole lot [clears throat]
[1:32:52] bigger and praise God for that. You
[1:32:55] know, I mean, how many of you want to
[1:32:57] live with no passion?
[1:33:01] Oh, so God gave it to you for a for a
[1:33:03] wonderful purpose and the devil's just
[1:33:05] trying to hijack it then.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Okay, so praise the Lord. So that's kind
[1:33:08] of what I began to explain to her. She
[1:33:11] said, "Growing and becoming more mature,
[1:33:13] I started seeing and realizing that
[1:33:15] things are different as they used to be
[1:33:17] or it gets more complicated. Now I'm 19
[1:33:19] years old and I wish I could just be the
[1:33:21] same Christian girl I was about three
[1:33:23] years ago." Anybody ever feel that way?
[1:33:28] I'd just like to tell you you are.
[1:33:31] Maybe you don't feel like it, but you
[1:33:33] are. I just want to be the same girl
[1:33:36] again that was so close to the Lord and
[1:33:38] so innocent. I'm mad at myself and
[1:33:40] sometimes I look in the mirror and speak
[1:33:43] bad at myself.
[1:33:47] Does anybody want No, don't raise your
[1:33:49] hand.
[1:33:52] I'd just like to ask you, those of you
[1:33:54] who do this kind of thing, and that's
[1:33:56] probably 90%.
[1:33:58] What scripture is that?
[1:34:04] What scripture is that?
[1:34:07] You know, thou shalt speak bad at
[1:34:09] thyself in the mirror after thine has
[1:34:12] transgressed
[1:34:17] the commandments.
[1:34:24] Does does Jesus need your help saving
[1:34:27] you?
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Does he need your help taking away your
[1:34:30] sin?
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Do we maybe we call the sister to the
[1:34:34] piano and we can we can begin to sing
[1:34:36] that old song, you know, Jesus
[1:34:39] paid it some
[1:34:44] to him I owe.
[1:34:49] Sin has left a crimson stain.
[1:34:52] I'll tell myself how bad I am. That'll
[1:34:56] help.
[1:34:59] You're welcome. Because now you're going
[1:35:01] to remember that song the next time you
[1:35:02] look in the mirror to speak bad at
[1:35:04] yourself. You're going to be like, "I'm
[1:35:05] an idiot." [laughter]
[1:35:09] [clears throat] Thank you, brother
[1:35:10] Trevor. Thank you, Lord, for Brother
[1:35:11] Trevor. This one, not that one. We thank
[1:35:14] the Lord for him, too, but for different
[1:35:15] reason. [laughter]
[1:35:19] this. That's fun. Anyway,
[1:35:22] I just think the Lord has to be so upset
[1:35:24] at me and I feel a little lost.
[1:35:27] I feel I'm not worthy of reading my
[1:35:29] Bible or praying. It's just hard to get
[1:35:31] back to God after sinning and I really
[1:35:32] don't want to fall again. I am also
[1:35:34] scared that God will punish me. I pray
[1:35:36] I'll pray and I would appreciate you if
[1:35:38] you could also pray for me. God bless.
[1:35:42] So, this is this is the response. This
[1:35:44] is this this initial question and my
[1:35:46] response to her and her response after
[1:35:48] that. And we begin to see some things
[1:35:50] from this letter. And remember, all I'm
[1:35:52] trying to do is present just in modern
[1:35:54] language someone who basically rewrote
[1:35:57] Romans 7 from her own perspective.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Right. Right. Okay. And so, so, but
[1:36:04] here's some things that we find that I
[1:36:07] found in her letter, and I thought this
[1:36:09] is what we should deal with. One of the
[1:36:10] things she's trying to say here is, "My
[1:36:13] sin is probably greater than Jesus can
[1:36:15] forgive because I've known better than
[1:36:17] to do this for years."
[1:36:21] Anybody ever believed that lie? Yeah,
[1:36:23] but my sin
[1:36:26] I mean, you all like,
[1:36:29] you know, I I mean, I hate to be
[1:36:30] arrogant, but you all aren't as good at
[1:36:32] sinning as I am.
[1:36:35] And I know better.
[1:36:37] And I don't know about you, like your
[1:36:39] revelation isn't mine, you know, but I'm
[1:36:40] just saying I know better
[1:36:44] like like you're some special kind of
[1:36:46] sinner and that Jesus has to deal with
[1:36:48] you differently than he's going to deal
[1:36:50] with everybody else because of some
[1:36:55] special quality that you possess. So,
[1:36:58] not only are you failing, but you're
[1:37:00] also adding arrogance to your failures.
[1:37:02] See, that's
[1:37:05] Isn't that nice? Okay. Or lie number
[1:37:08] two. Even after my first sin, I repented
[1:37:09] and told God I wouldn't do it again.
[1:37:11] Then I fell again. I obviously don't
[1:37:14] have God in me.
[1:37:17] Does that what does that what it sound
[1:37:19] is? Does that what Paul's version of
[1:37:21] Romans 7 sound like?
[1:37:24] I don't have God. Like I realize when
[1:37:26] I'm doing things I hate, I just don't
[1:37:27] have God in me. And I've got to repent,
[1:37:29] get the baptism of the Holy Spirit all
[1:37:30] over again. And I got to go back to the
[1:37:32] Damascus road. I got to see the light
[1:37:33] again. I got to get healed from
[1:37:35] blindness again. I got to go back out
[1:37:36] into the desert, get three more years of
[1:37:38] revelation, and then
[1:37:41] maybe I'll do this better.
[1:37:47] [laughter]
[1:37:48] So, so what's our answer to these
[1:37:50] things? How do we brother Trevor, okay,
[1:37:52] you know, you're kind of, you know, pay
[1:37:55] you have identified the problem, brother
[1:37:57] Trevor.
[1:37:59] Thank you. Okay. God bless you. You're
[1:38:01] dismissed. We No. No. Maybe there's more
[1:38:03] here. Maybe we should. Is there What's
[1:38:06] the Where do we start then, Brother
[1:38:08] Trevor? How can we break out of this
[1:38:10] cycle? How can we How can we be better?
[1:38:12] How can we find how can we find
[1:38:14] ourselves standing in righteousness and
[1:38:16] dwelling in righteousness? Okay, that's
[1:38:18] a great question. So, what our answer
[1:38:20] for these lies usually is, and we've
[1:38:23] already discussed it with Paul a little
[1:38:24] bit, is to law better.
[1:38:28] you know, isn't this, you know, and and
[1:38:31] here, let's let's just take just two
[1:38:33] minutes and talk about, you know, like
[1:38:35] what addiction looks like in 2025
[1:38:38] because this is really what we're
[1:38:39] talking about is is addiction, right?
[1:38:41] Like like the things that I I I all
[1:38:44] things are lawful, but I don't want to
[1:38:46] be brought under the power of any, which
[1:38:49] means it's an addiction that is pulling
[1:38:52] me into a and I'm now that's why I'm
[1:38:54] doing something. I hate this thing, but
[1:38:56] I'm doing it. Why? because there's an
[1:38:58] addictive nature because again the flesh
[1:39:03] is not the Holy Ghost,
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; right? And so and so your flesh is not
[1:39:09] the Holy Ghost,
[1:39:11] right? So so so there are things that
[1:39:14] will pull on it and try to addict you to
[1:39:17] it. And so back in, you know, the days
[1:39:19] of Y, you know, there was, you could
[1:39:22] tell if anybody was addicted to
[1:39:23] something because there was there was
[1:39:25] tobacco, there was drugs, there was
[1:39:26] alcohol, there was there was there was
[1:39:28] something outside of them
[1:39:31] that they were addicted to and you could
[1:39:33] just tell. But now science has learned
[1:39:37] what what has learned the science of of
[1:39:40] addiction and how it works and they've
[1:39:42] now taken all of these principles and
[1:39:44] they learned it through gambling and
[1:39:46] then they put it into pornography and
[1:39:48] then they put it into your social media
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; and all of these things and and they've
[1:39:52] learned how to addict you how your brain
[1:39:55] works to to give you that you've you've
[1:39:58] probably heard you know when I was 20
[1:40:00] years old the word dopamine I'd have
[1:40:02] been like what oh is this some new drug
[1:40:03] and it's like know it's a drug humans
[1:40:05] have had for all of their lives, right?
[1:40:07] But you all are probably very familiar
[1:40:09] with that word. How many? Anybody?
[1:40:10] Dopamine. You've heard it. You know,
[1:40:12] you've heard dopamine. Not you, him.
[1:40:17] How old are you?
[1:40:20] You're 13. You You've already know. You
[1:40:22] know what dopamine is. You understand.
[1:40:24] It's dopamine. It's this thing that goes
[1:40:26] off in your brain that says, "That was
[1:40:27] cool. I want to do that again."
[1:40:32] Do you know God gave us dopamine?
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; We think of it as something bad because
[1:40:38] the devil has tried to hijack it through
[1:40:40] modern science to to to addict you and
[1:40:42] pull you into things.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Right. Right. And so here we find
[1:40:46] ourselves with with with the m with the
[1:40:49] machine of all of this industry and all
[1:40:51] of these, you know, and and the devil
[1:40:53] and all of these things. And so we find
[1:40:55] ourselves though we're we're we we don't
[1:40:57] in our heart have any any bad purpose or
[1:41:00] any bad idea, but yet we we just thought
[1:41:02] I I'm going to go look at pictures of my
[1:41:03] friends. And then suddenly, like, you
[1:41:05] know, three hours later and now I put my
[1:41:08] phone down and I and I
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; How many times do you pick up your phone
[1:41:18] at the stoplight?
[1:41:25] Oh,
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; maybe I should have started with that
[1:41:27] one. Got everybody on the same page.
[1:41:30] You laugh because it's true. Right.
[1:41:33] Right. So, you're finding yourself.
[1:41:34] There's an there's an there's an
[1:41:36] attachment. There's a I can't stop
[1:41:38] myself. I think about No, not going to
[1:41:40] do it.
[1:41:44] [laughter]
[1:41:46] God protect my screen from myself.
[1:41:48] Right. So, so you find yourself
[1:41:50] sometimes you're like you're like pulled
[1:41:52] down these avenues and you you don't
[1:41:53] even, you know, it's like I don't I know
[1:41:55] I know better. I hate this thing. I
[1:41:57] don't want to do this thing, but I'm I'm
[1:41:58] pulled by this thing and I never
[1:42:00] intended to ever get here and I'm pulled
[1:42:01] by this thing. And then I think God, you
[1:42:03] know, forgive me. And you come to the
[1:42:04] altar on your your paid for cushion and
[1:42:06] you're like, God, forgive me. I'm so
[1:42:08] sorry. And you get back up and you're
[1:42:10] like
[1:42:12] [sighs]
[1:42:15] this time.
[1:42:17] Hang on.
[1:42:25] I've got it now.
[1:42:27] I will not do that thing. I'm not doing
[1:42:31] that thing right now. I'm not doing that
[1:42:34] thing.
[1:42:42] So, our answer is so often I got to law
[1:42:45] better. I got to really like, okay,
[1:42:47] what? Here's what I got to do. I got to
[1:42:49] really understand how bad this is. And
[1:42:51] when I understand how bad this is, I'll
[1:42:53] just be more depressed after I do it
[1:42:55] again.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Did it help?
[1:43:02] You've done. We've all done these
[1:43:04] things. We've all lived this way. We've
[1:43:06] all struggled with this. We've all
[1:43:07] looked in the mirror and told, "You're
[1:43:09] so stupid.
[1:43:12] tape the law to our wind, you know, to
[1:43:14] the thing
[1:43:22] and it never helped,
[1:43:26] right?
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:43:31] So, okay, I'll stop here. I'll I'll add
[1:43:33] this little personal I I don't know what
[1:43:34] point in time I usually add this, but
[1:43:38] you know, [clears throat]
[1:43:40] God can deliver us.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; I mean, isn't Paul just saying, "Who
[1:43:45] shall deliver me from the body of this
[1:43:47] death?" Right? And there are times I was
[1:43:48] actually just speaking in Kansas, there
[1:43:50] was a brother and I was like, "Wow, this
[1:43:51] is so cool to see like so much in like
[1:43:53] wrapped up in one person." And uh I mean
[1:43:55] that in the best way. But you know, he
[1:43:57] when he when the Lord when he first came
[1:43:59] to the Lord, God took away smoking. God
[1:44:01] took away just man just bam just took it
[1:44:03] away right
[1:44:06] but then the things God didn't take
[1:44:11] he struggled with
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; until like he had been away from the
[1:44:16] Lord not smoking not drinking but away
[1:44:18] from the Lord until the last two years
[1:44:21] and the Lord has been bringing him and
[1:44:23] drawing him through this process and
[1:44:24] he's getting better at these other
[1:44:26] things but he was delivered
[1:44:27] supernaturally from some things but not
[1:44:29] from other
[1:44:32] Why does God do that? Well, there's many
[1:44:34] reasons sometimes. One is just it's like
[1:44:35] because he wants to say, "Blessed is the
[1:44:37] overcomer." And as the prophet tells us,
[1:44:39] he doesn't stick you in one end of the
[1:44:40] pipe and pull you out the other and say,
[1:44:41] "Blessed is the overcomer cuz you did
[1:44:43] nothing." And you want it to be that way
[1:44:45] because you want to grow in character
[1:44:47] because your character is the thing that
[1:44:48] you're going to take with you. And
[1:44:50] wouldn't it be nice to actually have
[1:44:51] some when you get to the promised land?
[1:44:58] It's like, "Oh, wonderful. You're here
[1:45:00] in the millennium with zero character.
[1:45:02] We're so happy you're here.
[1:45:09] So, so, [clears throat] so these trials
[1:45:13] are actually doing something. These
[1:45:15] pulls that are taking you down avenues
[1:45:18] you know you shouldn't go down are
[1:45:20] actually now investing in you a struggle
[1:45:23] that is teaching you
[1:45:28] a lot about who you are a lot about who
[1:45:31] he is. I tell you what, who who who
[1:45:35] better to to praise God for his grace to
[1:45:40] you than someone who feels they need it
[1:45:44] so deeply.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; I mean, you know, I was raised in a
[1:45:50] pretty good home.
[1:45:52] You know, we were pretty good at being
[1:45:54] good.
[1:45:56] Come on, somebody.
[1:46:00] Right.
[1:46:04] But there's others
[1:46:06] that are not so good at being good.
[1:46:08] Don't worry, I'm going to bring that
[1:46:10] part back around. So, don't think it's
[1:46:11] pride because we'll talk about that. But
[1:46:13] but but there's others who are just
[1:46:15] like, but their connection with the
[1:46:17] grace of God, their love for God, their
[1:46:20] their heart for him because they
[1:46:23] recognize the strength of his grace. Oh
[1:46:26] my. And there they are in the millennium
[1:46:28] now going, "I shouldn't be here. You're
[1:46:31] amazing. You are the greatest God ever.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; How do I know? Cuz I'm here."
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; What does that say? That means he is the
[1:46:41] like the fact that I am here is a
[1:46:44] testimony to who he is.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Because he's the most amazing, loving,
[1:46:51] gracegiving
[1:46:52] God there ever could have been thought
[1:46:55] of. And it's known because I am here,
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; you know. And so God can deliver you
[1:47:03] from some things, but some things he's
[1:47:05] gonna you're going to deal with these
[1:47:07] things. You're going to struggle with
[1:47:08] these things to know about his grace, to
[1:47:11] know about who you are, to know to to to
[1:47:14] wrestle with your own self.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; And sometimes you could be praying for
[1:47:20] deliverance and God won't give it to
[1:47:22] you.
[1:47:25] And you'll look in the book of James and
[1:47:28] you'll see that
[1:47:30] you know you you have not because you
[1:47:33] ask not
[1:47:35] because you ask a miss and God won't
[1:47:38] give it to you if you ask a miss to
[1:47:40] consume it upon your lusts.
[1:47:43] That's the book of James. And then
[1:47:46] you're like well Lord I am praying for
[1:47:48] deliverance.
[1:47:50] How is this? H like like maybe you could
[1:47:53] say, "Well, okay, we're just going to
[1:47:54] leave that down now." Now, maybe you
[1:47:56] could say like, "Lord, I am actually
[1:47:57] trying to be delivered from lust.
[1:48:00] So, I'm going to pray to be delivered
[1:48:02] from lust, but I'm asking a miss to
[1:48:04] consume it upon my lusts."
[1:48:08] Now, that's a headscratcher.
[1:48:11] But sometimes we don't recognize what's
[1:48:13] going on in our own hearts.
[1:48:15] And so, I was going through something.
[1:48:17] And I thought, God, I I I I that
[1:48:18] scripture came to mind. And I thought,
[1:48:20] this is exactly the conversation I had.
[1:48:21] God, I I want to be delivered from this
[1:48:23] thing for you.
[1:48:27] And and Lord, if I if you deliver me for
[1:48:30] this, like, think of how I could help
[1:48:32] others.
[1:48:34] My ministry is just starting, Lord, and
[1:48:36] if you deliver me and I can tell others
[1:48:38] how they could be delivered as well. If
[1:48:40] I go through that experience, I can tell
[1:48:42] them about how how that works, Lord. And
[1:48:45] you know what that would have looked
[1:48:46] like? That would have been like, I mean,
[1:48:49] I prayed.
[1:48:51] God delivered me.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; What's your problem? You need to be
[1:48:55] delivered. Oh,
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; just want you to know God can do it. He
[1:48:59] did it through me.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; You just be like me
[1:49:08] and what what you And so God God said,
[1:49:11] "You know what? In my grace, I'm gonna
[1:49:13] let you stew in that problem
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; because I'm not going to deliver you
[1:49:17] from that problem only to addict you to
[1:49:20] your own pride
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; only to give you a worse problem.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Right? So sometimes God knows our hearts
[1:49:32] and and wants to reveal himself to us.
[1:49:34] And this is why we should be reading our
[1:49:36] Bible and praying. Not so that we can
[1:49:37] check the Christian box, but so that we
[1:49:39] can be in a in a place where we're
[1:49:41] meditating upon who he is, that he can
[1:49:43] that he can do and and work in our own
[1:49:46] lives.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay. So, the answer isn't always
[1:49:51] law better. So, then what is the answer?
[1:49:54] Let's let's back up and let's go to
[1:49:55] Romans 7.
[1:49:57] Wait, we're already there. Verse one.
[1:50:00] Know ye not, brethren, for I speak to
[1:50:03] them to that know the law, how that the
[1:50:04] law hath dominion over a man as long as
[1:50:06] he liveth. For the woman which hath an
[1:50:08] husband is bound by the law to her
[1:50:09] husband so long as he liveth. But if the
[1:50:11] husband be dead, she's loose from the
[1:50:13] law of her husband. So then, if while
[1:50:15] her husband liveth, she'll be married to
[1:50:17] another man, she shall be called an
[1:50:18] adulteress. But if her husband be dead,
[1:50:20] she is free from the law, so that she is
[1:50:21] no adulteress, though she be married to
[1:50:24] another man. Wait, why did we all of a
[1:50:26] sudden get into marriage and divorce?
[1:50:27] Like, like, wait a second, Paul. like
[1:50:30] okay Romans 1 like people didn't know
[1:50:33] God so God gave them up to their own
[1:50:35] vile affections and then Paul you start
[1:50:37] taking us through grace and then you
[1:50:39] know we get some beautiful scriptures
[1:50:41] you know in in Romans you know shall we
[1:50:45] continue in sin that grace may abound
[1:50:46] God forbid we get the scripture that's
[1:50:49] um what Romans 6:23 um it is the gift of
[1:50:52] God you know salvation is the gift of
[1:50:55] God that scripture you haven't memorized
[1:50:57] from Sunday school it's been just a long
[1:50:59] time for me and then and then um you
[1:51:01] know so lovely scriptures like that and
[1:51:03] then we get to Romans 7:1 and Paul's
[1:51:05] like hold up I'm going to stop talking
[1:51:07] about grace for a moment um I need to
[1:51:09] inject three verses here on marriage and
[1:51:11] divorce so that in 2025 message
[1:51:14] believers can take marriage and divorce
[1:51:15] and they can take some scriptures from
[1:51:17] Matthew what Jesus says and they can
[1:51:18] take Romans 7 1-3 and they can put them
[1:51:20] all in their marriage and divorce files
[1:51:21] so they can understand marriage and
[1:51:22] divorce and now back to our regularly
[1:51:24] scheduled programming
[1:51:28] [clears throat]
[1:51:29] Or
[1:51:30] is he still talking about grace?
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; He's still talking about grace.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; If her husband be dead, she's free from
[1:51:39] what? The law. She's free from the law,
[1:51:42] so that she's no adulteress, though she
[1:51:44] be married to another man. Wherefore, my
[1:51:46] brethren, ye also are become dead to the
[1:51:48] law by the body of Christ, that ye
[1:51:50] should be married to another, even to
[1:51:52] him who raised from the dead, that we
[1:51:54] should bring forth fruit unto God. For
[1:51:56] when we were in the flesh, the motions
[1:51:58] of sin which were by the law did work in
[1:52:01] our members to bring forth fruit unto
[1:52:04] death.
[1:52:05] So even when you were married to the law
[1:52:07] and you were trying to do the things of
[1:52:09] the law, the only fruit it could bring
[1:52:11] of that union of being you and and the
[1:52:14] law being married together was the fruit
[1:52:16] of death. But now, because Christ came
[1:52:20] and and and put to the death to to put
[1:52:23] to death the law on the cross,
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; you are no longer married to the law.
[1:52:30] You can now be married to another, which
[1:52:32] is the grace of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; And when you're married to Jesus Christ
[1:52:40] in his grace, that we should bring forth
[1:52:43] fruit unto God, living fruit, good
[1:52:46] fruit. Right? So verse six, now we are
[1:52:50] delivered from the law that being dead
[1:52:52] wherein we were held that we should
[1:52:53] serve a newness of spirit and not the
[1:52:55] oldness of letter. Romans 7, Paul is
[1:52:58] transitioning us from the law into
[1:53:01] living in the spirit. because in Romans
[1:53:03] 8, you're going to start seeing him
[1:53:05] talking about
[1:53:07] living a spiritfilled life,
[1:53:10] right? And so you can probably read that
[1:53:12] later.
[1:53:14] So, so what we're seeing here is because
[1:53:16] our answer was was law better.
[1:53:20] Not that that's the right answer, but
[1:53:22] that's the answer we always do. We fail,
[1:53:25] we get up, we try to law better within
[1:53:28] ourselves because we think that's what
[1:53:30] God wants. He wants me to be better
[1:53:35] like some Baptist theology.
[1:53:39] God wants me to be good.
[1:53:41] God wants you to be bride. He wants you
[1:53:44] to be relational. And if you're going to
[1:53:47] be relational, you're not some robot
[1:53:49] that just does the right things, but
[1:53:50] you're someone who has had experiences
[1:53:53] in their life that that you can now
[1:53:55] relate with someone else. And so God God
[1:53:58] is transitioning us into that
[1:54:00] spiritfilled life. But our answer of law
[1:54:02] better is no longer the answer because
[1:54:05] the law was put to death by Jesus
[1:54:08] Christ. You're no longer married to the
[1:54:10] law, but you're married to him in his
[1:54:12] resurrection, in his grace.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; And so now,
[1:54:20] oh, but wait, I'm still pulled. I still
[1:54:23] come down these things and I shouldn't
[1:54:25] do these things. Ah, yes. I need to lo I
[1:54:29] Hey, old husband,
[1:54:33] you and I need to have a little
[1:54:36] discussion here before I go
[1:54:40] come back to this new husband.
[1:54:44] Do you see what we're doing? You see
[1:54:46] what Paul is presenting to us? That law
[1:54:49] was put to death. You don't go back to
[1:54:50] that. You don't need to go back to that.
[1:54:53] That that that is gone. That is that is
[1:54:55] divorced. is dead. It brought no fruit.
[1:54:58] But now here you have a new husband,
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; the grace of Jesus Christ.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; But then, brother Trevor, so when I fail
[1:55:05] and I I go down this and I feel I'm an
[1:55:07] idiot and I come back and you know how
[1:55:09] long should I stay at the altar, then if
[1:55:12] I'm no longer married to the law? And of
[1:55:14] course, as we all know, the law dictates
[1:55:16] depending on the infraction what you've
[1:55:17] done. You know, I mean, you know, for
[1:55:19] looking at pornography, you know, that's
[1:55:20] an hour and a half at the altar.
[1:55:24] Lying to your parents 20 minutes at the
[1:55:26] altar should be good. You should feel
[1:55:28] cleansed by then,
[1:55:30] you know.
[1:55:36] Okay, then brother Trevor, if I'm
[1:55:38] divorced from that, if that if that old
[1:55:40] union is gone, what does this new union
[1:55:43] say? What is my part? What what then do
[1:55:47] I do? Shouldn't I do something?
[1:55:51] Well, you should be married to your
[1:55:53] husband. Grace,
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; the grace of Jesus Christ, brothers,
[1:55:58] forever. Like, okay, but I mean, I'm not
[1:56:00] saying you don't feel sorry. I'm not
[1:56:02] saying you don't feel stupid. If you can
[1:56:03] figure out how to fall up flat on your
[1:56:05] face and not feel stupid, come tell me.
[1:56:07] I want to know.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; I don't like it.
[1:56:13] But how long does it take to repent and
[1:56:15] receive the grace of Jesus Christ?
[1:56:18] Thank you,
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Here I am again. I did it again.
[1:56:25] Thank you.
[1:56:26] I'm married to grace.
[1:56:29] Now, of course, I don't continue in sin
[1:56:30] that I can prove how great grace is. But
[1:56:33] but God, I have I have fallen and your
[1:56:36] grace is just as strong as it was
[1:56:38] yesterday when I was a good little boy
[1:56:40] or a good little girl. But now, your
[1:56:42] grace your grace abounds already. It
[1:56:46] didn't take me 30 seconds. It didn't
[1:56:48] take me 30 minutes. It didn't take two
[1:56:50] hours to receive the grace. It was
[1:56:53] already free. It was already given to
[1:56:55] me. And the moment I come up off of
[1:56:58] falling flat on my face, I am already
[1:57:00] forgiven
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; because God never desired for me to be
[1:57:04] punished for that thing because he took
[1:57:06] the punishment already.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:12] So, so, but this is rewriting this is
[1:57:16] rewriting our minds because we've been
[1:57:17] we've been we've been we've been married
[1:57:19] to the law for so long that we continue
[1:57:22] to react to our old husband when we have
[1:57:24] a new.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; So, now you're living in grace. But what
[1:57:30] do I do? What like how does that how
[1:57:32] does that solve this problem? Well, I
[1:57:34] can tell you what what's not solving the
[1:57:37] problem.
[1:57:38] What's not solving the problem is going
[1:57:40] back to the law
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; because you're the grace of God is
[1:57:47] received by faith. So, you're going to
[1:57:49] need faith,
[1:57:51] right? So, let's go to Romans 4. Let's
[1:57:53] back up just a little bit more and we'll
[1:57:55] try to bring this to a close because my
[1:57:57] timer says four minutes and that
[1:57:59] whatever had I don't know what that had,
[1:58:01] but it's blinking at me now.
[1:58:04] I And I've knocked this thing over a
[1:58:06] million times. So, well, that's just a
[1:58:08] clock.
[1:58:10] Okay. Romans 4. I'll take off my coat
[1:58:13] just because I'm hot, not because I'm
[1:58:14] just getting ready to start preaching.
[1:58:17] [laughter]
[1:58:19] Okay. What shall we say then that
[1:58:21] Abraham our father as pertaining to the
[1:58:23] flesh is found? For if Abraham were
[1:58:26] justified by works, he hath whereof to
[1:58:27] glory, but not before God. So if you can
[1:58:30] figure out how to do it married to the
[1:58:31] law,
[1:58:34] you can glory before men, but not before
[1:58:36] God.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; For what sayaith the scripture? Abraham
[1:58:41] believed God, and it was counted unto
[1:58:44] him
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; for righteous. Isn't that what we're
[1:58:47] trying to do? I don't want to go down
[1:58:48] these paths and be stupid and do the
[1:58:50] things I want righteous.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Abraham believed God and it was counted
[1:58:55] for
[1:58:57] Was
[1:58:59] he always righteous?
[1:59:04] But because he believed God, God saw him
[1:59:06] as righteous.
[1:59:09] Let's move forward to verse 18.
[1:59:13] Who against hope believed in hope that
[1:59:16] he might become the father of many
[1:59:18] nations, according to that which was
[1:59:20] spoken, so shall thy seed be. And being
[1:59:22] not weak in the flesh in faith, he
[1:59:24] considered not his own body now dead.
[1:59:26] when he was about a 100 years old,
[1:59:28] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's
[1:59:30] womb, he staggered not at the promise of
[1:59:32] God through unbelief, but was strong in
[1:59:34] faith, giving glory to God, and being
[1:59:36] fully persuaded that what he had
[1:59:37] promised, he was also able to perform,
[1:59:39] and therefore it was imputed to him for
[1:59:41] righteousness.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; So here Abraham is,
[1:59:47] he's a he's a hundred years old,
[1:59:50] okay? He's 98. Melzdc comes says hey the
[1:59:55] promised son is coming
[1:59:59] and Abraham's like now like Sarah laughs
[2:00:03] in the tent
[2:00:05] why because Abraham's like Lord have you
[2:00:09] seen these wrinkles
[2:00:13] my Lord I mean I appreciate it I
[2:00:18] appreciate your promise for me I
[2:00:19] appreciate you saying that in my life
[2:00:21] and the life of my wife, we can bring
[2:00:24] forth the promised fruit that you have
[2:00:27] all always promised us for so long. I
[2:00:30] appreciate that you say that, but Lord,
[2:00:33] my
[2:00:35] have you seen my flesh?
[2:00:39] Have you seen how weak this flesh is,
[2:00:41] Lord? How is this weak flesh going to
[2:00:44] produce your son? You begin to see the
[2:00:47] metaphor we're drawing here, right? How
[2:00:49] many of you feel like you have ab like
[2:00:51] Abraham, you think you've got weak
[2:00:52] flesh? Have you seen mine?
[2:00:56] But Abraham didn't consider his the
[2:00:59] weakness of his body, nor the deadness
[2:01:01] of Sarah's womb, but he was strong in
[2:01:04] faith. And so what God counted it to him
[2:01:06] for righteousness.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; It was his faith in what God could do
[2:01:11] that made him righteous. Brother Trevor,
[2:01:13] I fell flat on my face yesterday. Do you
[2:01:16] believe the grace of God for that? It is
[2:01:19] counted to you for righteousness.
[2:01:25] Do you want to be righteous?
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Be married to grace. Be married to Jesus
[2:01:31] Christ.
[2:01:33] Actually believe what we're taught about
[2:01:36] these things. Because here's the idea.
[2:01:38] And I I there's a there's probably a
[2:01:40] hundred other sermons I could do after
[2:01:42] this. We could talk about self-control.
[2:01:44] We could talk about putting up borders.
[2:01:46] We could talk about accountability. We
[2:01:47] could talk about all kinds of things
[2:01:48] that are things that are there to help
[2:01:50] you
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; to to to to grow, to strive to mature. I
[2:01:54] mean, just maturing, you know, just
[2:01:56] straight up maturity that you will get
[2:01:59] by nature will help you so much. God
[2:02:02] bless you. May you mature that will you
[2:02:06] will just you'll have more grace for
[2:02:08] yourself.
[2:02:10] But there's all kinds of things that we
[2:02:12] could probably do because we want to do
[2:02:14] them. But if they aren't starting
[2:02:16] because we believe in the grace of God
[2:02:18] and we have faith, faith is our
[2:02:20] platform. And if we do not if we do not
[2:02:22] have a platform of faith to believe the
[2:02:23] grace of God, you are going to be up and
[2:02:26] down and up and down and get so mad at
[2:02:28] yourself and think,
[2:02:32] why am I trying? Maybe the devil's
[2:02:34] right. I can't do it. I my body I my
[2:02:38] body can't do it. And it and and what if
[2:02:41] Abraham would have done that? What does
[2:02:42] the how does the Bible read? If Abraham
[2:02:45] says, "You know what? Hey, Melchisedc, I
[2:02:48] appreciate that, man. I really do, but
[2:02:53] Sarah and I have been trying for 24
[2:02:54] years to make this promise come." And
[2:02:59] I just I'm just at the point where I I
[2:03:01] just don't think it's going to happen,
[2:03:03] you know? I mean, what's what's going to
[2:03:05] be different about my body,
[2:03:10] Lord?
[2:03:12] What can I do to make my body more
[2:03:14] fruitful to bring forth a promised son?
[2:03:19] MCDz would be like,
[2:03:23] "That's why I'm here."
[2:03:30] And isn't that exactly just what Jesus
[2:03:31] is trying to say to you today? You who
[2:03:34] were caught in Romans 7, you who are up
[2:03:36] and down and up and down and struggling
[2:03:38] and striving
[2:03:40] is he's saying,
[2:03:42] "But I'm here now. But I'm here." Can
[2:03:45] you believe that I'm here and I'm here
[2:03:47] for you?
[2:03:49] Not only do I give you my grace, but I
[2:03:53] am grace
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; here with you. I am that strength. Your
[2:03:57] body, your body hasn't figured it out
[2:04:00] yet who I am, but it will. If you can
[2:04:05] believe that I am here with you. All I'm
[2:04:08] asking is that you accept that I am here
[2:04:10] with you. Now, now, now if you you know
[2:04:14] this might scare some legalists,
[2:04:17] but this is the grace of God. This is
[2:04:20] this is this is what go God God the the
[2:04:23] God who is saying I want you to be my
[2:04:25] bride.
[2:04:28] That kind of love gives us this kind of
[2:04:31] grace that I don't care. I don't care
[2:04:34] what you've done, how many times you've
[2:04:36] done it, how many times you've repented,
[2:04:38] how many times you've looked in the
[2:04:39] mirror and told yourself how bad you
[2:04:40] are. Melzdc comes along and Melzdc has
[2:04:44] come in our day
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; and said, "I am here."
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; And there is enough power in this word,
[2:04:53] in this message, if we should so choose
[2:04:56] to believe it, that will deliver us from
[2:04:58] all of these things. Because you say,
[2:04:59] "Brother Trevor, you you don't you don't
[2:05:01] you Yeah, I fail every day. Me and Paul
[2:05:04] die daily. Me and Paul trying not to be
[2:05:07] brought under the power of any."
[2:05:09] Right. Right. That's just a human
[2:05:12] experience.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; But because Melzdc is here, you don't
[2:05:16] have to consider your body as being
[2:05:18] dead. You don't have to consider
[2:05:19] yourself as being worthless. You don't
[2:05:21] have to consider yourself as someone who
[2:05:22] could never do it, who could never be a
[2:05:24] Christian, who simply isn't good enough,
[2:05:26] who has tried a million times and
[2:05:28] failed. And how is tomorrow going to be
[2:05:30] different? It depends on is Melchzdc
[2:05:32] here?
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; And he is
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; and he's here for you. So you don't have
[2:05:40] to consider the weakness of your own
[2:05:42] flesh, such as it is to produce Jesus
[2:05:46] Christ within that flesh. And that's
[2:05:49] exactly what God wants to do is to
[2:05:51] produce Jesus Christ in your body.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; Daniel, he wants to be Daniel's version
[2:05:57] of Jesus Christ. What would Jesus Christ
[2:06:00] look like if he was in that that body?
[2:06:03] Exactly what he's doing.
[2:06:08] We're not going to make Daniel, you
[2:06:09] know,
[2:06:12] change his hairstyle to be the same
[2:06:14] hairstyle Jesus had. Stop wearing Nikes.
[2:06:19] Put on sandals. Like, start acting like
[2:06:21] Jesus, man. No, no, no. I tell you what,
[2:06:23] Daniel, you just let the word of God
[2:06:25] come into your heart. Let it permeate
[2:06:27] you and saturate you and let it let you
[2:06:30] like not not not that it's works
[2:06:32] anymore, but now you're starting to
[2:06:33] recognize this is truth from all ages.
[2:06:35] And this is the best way to live. This
[2:06:37] is the most fulfilling. There's more joy
[2:06:39] in this. There's more love in this.
[2:06:41] There's more hope in this. There's more
[2:06:42] peace in this. And you just let that
[2:06:44] word come in and begin to change your
[2:06:46] life. And suddenly people are like,
[2:06:49] I thought that was Jesus for a moment.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Then I realized it was just Daniel.
[2:07:01] Pretty sure it's just Daniel.
[2:07:05] But it's not just Daniel, is it?
[2:07:09] Even if just Daniel fell yesterday
[2:07:13] because of the grace of God today,
[2:07:16] it's not just Daniel.
[2:07:20] The word of God living in Daniel. I
[2:07:23] don't I'm not We're not looking We're
[2:07:26] not looking at the deadness of his
[2:07:28] flesh, at the weakness of his flesh.
[2:07:32] We're looking at Jesus Christ.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; We're married to a new husband. because
[2:07:38] that husband
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; put the law to death for us. So just
[2:07:43] finish maybe with a quote here from a
[2:07:46] guide. Musicians, why don't you come?
[2:07:49] Peter was led to say on Acts 238 how to
[2:07:52] receive the Holy Ghost. He said, "Repent
[2:07:53] every one of you. Then he baptized you
[2:07:55] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[2:07:56] remission of your sins and then the
[2:07:58] guide will take you from there on."
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the thing to do. First
[2:08:03] repent of your sins. Amen. You got to be
[2:08:05] converted. None of this was talking
[2:08:07] about becoming converted. This was
[2:08:09] assuming you already had a converted
[2:08:10] heart. I mean, if you're just, you know,
[2:08:12] man, I'm going down these roads I
[2:08:14] absolutely want to go down. Okay, you
[2:08:16] need a conversion.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; I'm doing these things I don't want to.
[2:08:19] Something in me has changed. Well,
[2:08:20] that's different then, right? You've
[2:08:22] disbelieved these things. Repent. Be
[2:08:23] baptized.
[2:08:25] And then the guide will take you from
[2:08:27] there on. See, that's your duty. It's
[2:08:29] your duty to repent. Your duty to be
[2:08:32] baptized. It's the guide's duty to take
[2:08:34] you from there on.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; think he said that three times. Lead you
[2:08:39] from virtue to knowledge, temperance to
[2:08:41] patience, godliness, brotherly love. The
[2:08:42] Holy Ghost seals you. See, then you're a
[2:08:44] full stature of God. A real man of God,
[2:08:46] a real woman of God, anchored away in
[2:08:48] Christ. I love that. Anchored away in
[2:08:52] Christ.
[2:08:54] [clears throat]
[2:08:55] So, this is the grace of God. I'm going
[2:08:58] to need the song leader to come. If you
[2:09:00] don't mind, brother, why don't you come
[2:09:01] and uh you can sing back me up here,
[2:09:04] bro, because this is done.
[2:09:08] But we find ourselves right here in
[2:09:10] Romans chapter 7. But there's no reason
[2:09:14] to feel despair. There's no reason to
[2:09:18] feel like you can't do it.
[2:09:22] And there's every reason to just
[2:09:24] believe. The grace of Jesus Christ
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; is poured out so freely upon you. And
[2:09:30] the Holy Spirit will take you from there
[2:09:34] on. Shall we pray? Heavenly Father,
[2:09:38] you see who we are, where we are. Lord,
[2:09:40] you know our failures. You know our
[2:09:42] faults.
[2:09:44] You know how frail our own flesh, which
[2:09:48] is not the Holy Ghost, but just the
[2:09:49] temple of the Holy Ghost. Lord, you you
[2:09:52] see how it gets in the way so often. But
[2:09:55] God,
[2:09:57] you have come
[2:09:59] and you've said the time of the promise
[2:10:01] is nigh and you gave us of your grace.
[2:10:06] You gave us your love.
[2:10:08] Oh Lord, how good it is. How good it is.
[2:10:12] Father, I pray Lord God that your Holy
[2:10:14] Spirit would come and witness to the
[2:10:15] heart of every young person, every
[2:10:17] elderly person that came
[2:10:20] that you would that you would speak
[2:10:22] personally to them and witness the truth
[2:10:25] of your grace
[2:10:28] to each one.
[2:10:30] May you be glorified
[2:10:32] in receiving
[2:10:35] that which you purchased on the cross,
[2:10:36] Lord God.
[2:10:38] May you be praised for that which you
[2:10:41] did on the cross, Lord God.
[2:10:44] Oh Lord,
[2:10:46] may we just accept
[2:10:48] that wave [snorts] of grace and love
[2:10:52] for us. We ask this in the name of the
[2:10:55] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[2:11:04] I'm glad you see
[2:11:08] through eyes of love.
[2:11:13] A hopeless case
[2:11:17] in an empty [singing] place.
[2:11:21] If not for grace, where would I be? Oh,
[2:11:26] where would [singing] I be?
[2:11:30] You only know.
[2:11:34] I'm glad you see
[2:11:39] through eyes [singing] of love.
[2:11:43] A hopeless case
[2:11:47] an empty [music and singing]
[2:11:49] place
[2:11:51] if not for grace.

[2:12:04] I [music] once [singing] was lost.
[2:12:08] But now I'm found

[2:12:14] case.
[2:12:17] An empty place
[2:12:21] if not for grace. Amazing grace, oh
[2:12:26] amazing grace, [music and singing]
[2:12:30] how sweet the sound.

[2:12:34] I once was lost, [singing]
[2:12:38] but now I'm

[2:12:55] oh precious Lord, [singing and music]
[2:12:59] please take my hand
[2:13:04] and lead me up
[2:13:08] and help me stand [music]
[2:13:16] and

[2:13:25] that. If you're here this morning and
[2:13:27] those words resonated with you and you
[2:13:30] would like to have prayer, special
[2:13:33] prayer, I would uh not leave here um
[2:13:38] without letting our brother pray for
[2:13:40] you. And um I'm going to give you that
[2:13:43] opportunity to come forward and pray.
[2:13:45] Brother Trevor is available for that and
[2:13:49] the altar is open and we want you to
[2:13:52] really take advantage of those words in
[2:13:55] Romans 7. It's a powerful word. I thank
[2:13:58] God for it. We are living under the
[2:14:01] grace of almighty God. He loved us
[2:14:05] better when we couldn't law better. It
[2:14:08] was his love and his grace that came
[2:14:11] upon us. It's by his grace that we're
[2:14:14] saved today. Amen. So, we'll sing that.
[2:14:17] And if you have need for prayer, why
[2:14:19] don't you just come right up to the
[2:14:21] front? Our brother will pray for you. Oh
[2:14:24] precious Lord,
