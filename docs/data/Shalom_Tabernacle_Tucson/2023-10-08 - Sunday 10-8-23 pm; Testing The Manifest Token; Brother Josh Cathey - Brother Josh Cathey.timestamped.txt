[41:53] because that your faith groweth
[41:55] exceedingly and and the charity of every
[41:57] one of you all toward each other
[41:59] aboundeth
[42:00] verse four says so that we ourselves
[42:03] glory in you in the Churches of God for
[42:06] your patience and faith and all your
[42:09] persecutions and tribulations that ye
[42:12] endure and it says which is a manifest
[42:16] token of the righteous Judgment of God
[42:18] and so a judgment we know a judgment in
[42:20] a court trial at least a judgment is
[42:23] after all the questioning the testing
[42:25] and all that has been done it's the end
[42:27] it's it's what where you get your
[42:29] judgment at and he said which is a
[42:31] manifest token of the righteous Judgment
[42:33] of God that you may be counted worthy of
[42:36] the kingdom of God for which ye also
[42:38] suffer amen let's bow our heads Heavenly
[42:42] Father Lord Jesus we just thank you for
[42:44] this opportunity to come into the house
[42:46] of the Lord Lord Jesus your Prophet told
[42:49] us that it was a Christian's privilege
[42:51] and honor to come into the house of the
[42:53] Lord and father as this as this service
[42:55] goes forward I ask that you would move
[42:57] me out of the way that you would calm
[42:59] any nerves I have that you would just
[43:02] anoint me father and that you would help
[43:03] me along the way and Lord the prayer
[43:05] requests that went up earlier Lord we
[43:07] ask you watch over each and every one of
[43:09] those that you bless each one father and
[43:11] that you come down and just give them a
[43:12] Special Touch from you Lord we just
[43:15] thank you and we love you in Jesus
[43:16] Christ's name amen may be
[43:19] seated so another translation when I was
[43:22] looking up manifest token is what really
[43:24] caught me about this scripture says
[43:26] which is a manifest token and another
[43:29] translation of manifest token was
[43:31] evidence that their persecutions and
[43:33] their tribulations that they were
[43:35] enduring it was a type of an Evidence of
[43:37] the righteous Judgment of God upon their
[43:39] lives and so when I was reading Isaiah
[43:42] 648 I was wondering out of everything
[43:45] why would a out of everything we could
[43:47] have used as an example why would a
[43:49] Potter and a clay be what we used why
[43:51] would that be the things to look to as
[43:53] an example and the more I studied it I
[43:56] realized that it was it was really more
[43:58] about the entire process of what happens
[44:01] with a Potter in his clay it's not we
[44:03] know he shapes it but there's an entire
[44:05] process from being a piece of clay
[44:07] that's useless that that can't do
[44:09] anything and then turning that into
[44:12] something with purpose a vase that can
[44:13] hold flowers or a bowl that you can eat
[44:15] out of you know it has purpose after
[44:18] that and I saw a quote the other day
[44:20] it's not it's not brother brandham
[44:22] saying this but I just thought it was
[44:24] very appropriate for the the process it
[44:26] it said most people don't want to be a
[44:28] part of the process they just want to be
[44:30] a part of the outcome it said but the
[44:32] process is where you figure out who's
[44:35] worth being part of the
[44:38] outcome and so in in Pottery the Potter
[44:42] he can form his clay in many ways it
[44:44] doesn't have to be the same like I said
[44:46] a bowl a vase he's got many different
[44:48] ways of doing it and they use different
[44:51] tools and they use different things to
[44:53] do it and they usually follow a Master
[44:55] model maybe they'll sketch out over here
[44:57] this is what I want my vase to look like
[45:00] and then they'll they'll follow that
[45:01] Master model the whole
[45:04] time and so as they're doing that one of
[45:06] the first steps of pottery is called
[45:08] centering and when you're centering you
[45:10] have the clay on a potter's wheel and
[45:12] you're trying to Center that clay as
[45:14] much as you possibly can to keep it in
[45:16] Balance so it won't fall off this way it
[45:18] won't fall off that way and you just
[45:20] Center that clay so that it will be
[45:21] ready for the steps that
[45:24] follow and they're not doing that so
[45:26] they there's a lot of pushing and
[45:27] pulling involved in centering something
[45:29] just like us on the word there there's a
[45:31] lot of days that we're pushing and
[45:32] pulling with the Lord you know the word
[45:34] tells us something but we feel something
[45:35] else and there's a lot of push and pull
[45:38] a lot of give and take and so it's the
[45:40] same way with pottery and there they're
[45:42] not doing it the the Potter doesn't do
[45:43] it to hurt the clay or harm it in any
[45:46] way it's trying to get that clay to
[45:48] fulfill its ultimate purpose to get it
[45:51] down the road to where it can hold those
[45:53] flowers or it can be a bowl to hold food
[45:55] for someone
[45:57] and so the next step that they have is
[45:59] called the dry out and so the dry out
[46:01] after they Center the clay and they have
[46:03] it on the wheel they got to wait until
[46:04] every bit of moisture is wicked out of
[46:07] that every bit of moisture or anything
[46:08] that's in the clay that'll that'll harm
[46:10] the clay later down the road there's a
[46:12] dry out process that
[46:14] happens
[46:16] and the importance of getting all the
[46:18] water out is that if you put it into the
[46:20] um into the oven too early without any
[46:23] water or with water still in it that
[46:25] moisture expands so it can be dangerous
[46:28] down the road if it doesn't get
[46:30] completely dried out and a lot of the I
[46:31] looked that up and a lot of the experts
[46:34] say never try and manufacture the drying
[46:37] process you let it happen on its own you
[46:40] let it happen naturally don't don't
[46:42] don't fake the drying process cuz you're
[46:43] not going to trick the oven once it gets
[46:45] in the oven cuz if that water's still in
[46:47] there something's going to happen and
[46:49] not something
[46:51] good so for a sec let's say the Clay's
[46:53] got a mind of its own for a second it's
[46:55] partially dried out but there's still
[46:57] just a little bit of moisture left in
[46:59] that clay it's still holding on to a few
[47:02] things it shouldn't really be holding on
[47:03] to that it knows it shouldn't be and
[47:06] there's a story I seen the other day
[47:07] it's uh it it was about a method that
[47:10] Hunters had used in Africa to capture
[47:13] monkeys and so what they would do they
[47:15] would get a large Plant it's a shell
[47:17] pretty much a gourd it's called a
[47:19] calabos and they would drill a hole in
[47:21] its side just large enough for the
[47:23] monkey's hand to go in like this and so
[47:26] they would do that and after they did
[47:27] that they would put peanuts in the
[47:29] bottom of the gourd and so the monkey he
[47:31] would be going through and he would
[47:33] smell something familiar and so he'd be
[47:35] going through and then he'd look up and
[47:37] he'd see not like it's strange that
[47:38] there's a gourd in a tree with peanuts
[47:40] in it or nothing not like that's odd or
[47:42] anything but he smelt the peanuts and he
[47:44] liked it so he went up and as soon as
[47:46] the monkey put his hand in there and got
[47:48] a hold of what he wanted he couldn't get
[47:50] his hand back out because the hole was
[47:52] specifically the size of his hand that's
[47:55] right
[47:56] and so the the conclusion of that was if
[47:59] he would only release the prize that he
[48:02] thought he had his hands on he could be
[48:04] free again that's right but the monkey
[48:06] thought that he still wanted that it was
[48:08] what he still wanted it was something
[48:10] that he remembered maybe from a past
[48:12] life and he was trying to hold on to it
[48:14] dearly and so the hunters would come and
[48:17] he would still be up there but he just
[48:19] wouldn't let go of the peanuts he
[48:20] couldn't get his hand out so his freedom
[48:23] was really H it was his choice it was
[48:26] hinged upon the monkey so the the last
[48:29] step of the clay is firing the clay so
[48:34] what happens after the drying out
[48:35] process is you fire it and what firing
[48:38] it does is it really molds the clay
[48:40] together and it fuses the clay and any
[48:42] elements together and I just thought
[48:45] that's something I'd really like to
[48:46] focus on because as a Christian in our
[48:49] Journeys that's something we're going to
[48:50] do we're going to spend a lot of time in
[48:51] the fire getting molded together a lot
[48:53] of things coming together a lot of
[48:54] things getting worked on burnt out of
[48:57] us so once in the fire all these
[48:59] chemical compounds and minerals they're
[49:01] they're burned away they're broken down
[49:03] and it takes shape of what it's supposed
[49:04] to be and the thing about when it takes
[49:06] shape there is no possible way to return
[49:09] that vase or that bowl back into the
[49:11] clay that it once was it's there it is
[49:15] what it is if you try and go back to its
[49:17] old form if you try if I took a vase up
[49:20] here right now and I slammed it on the
[49:21] floor and expected clay to be on the
[49:23] floor I broke it it's broken you ain't
[49:25] going to get clay from that it's already
[49:26] it's already transformed into something
[49:28] new a new
[49:30] creation one of the first tests after
[49:32] they get that new creation is a stain
[49:34] test and what they'll do is they'll put
[49:37] they'll they'll stain the outside of the
[49:38] ceramic with something and then they'll
[49:40] let it sit and they'll watch it and
[49:42] they'll watch the outside and then
[49:44] they'll look at the inside and if they
[49:45] see anything any of that stained color
[49:48] on the inside then they'll know that
[49:50] there's some cracks on the outside that
[49:51] didn't quite get taken care of so
[49:54] they'll see something seeping through
[49:55] something that shouldn't be on the
[49:56] inside of that
[49:58] bowl so we can see this testing it's not
[50:01] to hurt the product make it look bad
[50:03] it's it's only to prove the work of the
[50:05] Potter that's all that these tests and
[50:08] these processes are for is to prove the
[50:11] work of the Potter and he's the one who
[50:13] shaped it he molded it he baked it and
[50:15] produced
[50:16] it brother brandham said in we have seen
[50:20] a star and have come to worship Him
[50:23] paragraph 42 he said and sometimes we
[50:25] think that our burdens he said I might
[50:28] inject this here that we think our
[50:30] burdens are so heavy sometimes that
[50:33] there's nothing like it in the
[50:35] world he said do you know all those
[50:37] things are good for you all your burdens
[50:41] all your struggles all your tests
[50:43] whatever you're being put through if
[50:45] what I assume when I said when I read
[50:47] this quote the things that I were going
[50:49] through that I was going through at that
[50:51] specific time started rushing through my
[50:53] head and I started thinking you're
[50:56] Lord you're telling me that these things
[50:57] that I'm going through have a purpose
[51:00] that they're for my
[51:01] betterment that they're good for they
[51:03] don't feel good for me right now they
[51:05] don't look good for me it don't sound
[51:07] good for me but if your word says it's
[51:09] good for me then I trust your word it is
[51:10] good for
[51:11] me he said they are all to mold you make
[51:15] you it says prophets and sages was
[51:18] molded on the back side of the desert in
[51:20] the hot blazing sun through tribulations
[51:23] and trials and persecutions
[51:27] and these things that we have today this
[51:29] really struck he said there's nothing
[51:30] happened to us that hasn't happened to
[51:33] other Christians before so when you read
[51:35] that quote you would think well brother
[51:37] brandham didn't have to deal with cell
[51:38] phones he didn't have to deal with the
[51:39] internet Paul didn't have to deal with
[51:41] cell phones to the internet they didn't
[51:43] have to deal with those things but the
[51:44] same spirit that can attach itself to
[51:47] those devices they had devices in Paul's
[51:49] day that Spirits attached their yourself
[51:51] to and they used it and I'm not saying
[51:53] get rid of the internet or cell phone
[51:57] but sometimes I think we which it's a
[52:00] tough day to live in but those same
[52:02] spirits that were battling today were
[52:04] battled then as
[52:05] well he said other Christians has had to
[52:08] stand in the hour of Darkness like this
[52:10] and even be fed to lions for their
[52:14] testimony you know just as we have our
[52:17] products like you you buy a new Ford
[52:18] truck and you hop that that truck was
[52:20] tested you hop that they did something
[52:23] to it well they were sure that if you're
[52:25] going 75 down the highway that the tires
[52:27] won't fall off you know any product you
[52:30] have you hope that it was tested and
[52:31] tried so that it won't blow up in your
[52:33] face or hurt you in some way and you
[52:35] know the Lord wants to do the same
[52:37] things with his products that's us we
[52:40] are his we're his hands and feet here we
[52:42] are his products on the earth we are
[52:44] what he can use here and he does the
[52:47] same exact thing with us brother
[52:49] brandham said and how can I
[52:51] overcome I'm not sure about the
[52:53] paragraph what it is but it's how can
[52:55] overcome at
[52:56] 63 and he said now we're expected to be
[52:59] tested said that's a good lesson for my
[53:03] brother back there also he that cometh
[53:04] to God must first be tested tested what
[53:07] with the word that's God's test said Do
[53:09] you believe it he that cometh to God
[53:11] must be tested he said that only shows a
[53:15] true child then see be tested and when
[53:18] the test comes you can't
[53:21] overcome L there's a test to give to you
[53:24] right so the Bible tells us we are more
[53:26] than Overcomers the Bible plainly tells
[53:29] us that and there has to be something to
[53:31] overcome there has to be a test a trial
[53:33] a roadblock something you got to get
[53:36] through to overcome to to make that
[53:38] scripture come to life to
[53:41] you and so he goes on to say and when
[53:44] the test is given it's to see whether
[53:47] you can overcome or not and Jesus said
[53:49] to him that overcome the test the test
[53:52] is the greatest thing that ever ever
[53:55] happened to you he said the test is the
[53:58] greatest thing that ever happened to you
[54:01] you know if that Ford truck wouldn't
[54:02] have been tested and they all failed
[54:05] nobody would have bought the fort truck
[54:06] nobody would have wanted it nobody would
[54:08] have been interested in it and the test
[54:10] that there's
[54:12] a a big reason why I think the test is
[54:16] the greatest thing that ever happened to
[54:17] someone is that the lie that Satan will
[54:20] try and tell a lot of people is that
[54:22] you've gone too far you've messed up
[54:24] you've gone too far you've done too much
[54:26] there's no redeeming you but the test is
[54:28] proof that God's still working with you
[54:30] you haven't gone too far you haven't
[54:31] done too much you're not you're not the
[54:35] test is a proof and evidence a manifest
[54:37] token like the scripture said that God
[54:40] is still there in your life working with
[54:45] you it said I believe it's written in
[54:48] the scripture Peter said that our trials
[54:49] are worth more to us than precious gold
[54:52] it's a testing time and brother Bram
[54:54] says right right here it's one good
[54:56] evidence to us that God is with us when
[54:59] we're tested for all children of God are
[55:02] tested and
[55:04] tried and once again I could see how
[55:07] that ceramic pot had a mind of its own
[55:09] it might question it might say it's at
[55:12] this stage right now and it say well I
[55:15] was tested back there I thought it was
[55:16] over with I went through all these tests
[55:18] the the firing up the the drying out the
[55:21] centering I went through all of this
[55:23] stuff and you're telling me there's more
[55:25] I'm a ceramic pot now I'm done I thought
[55:28] my journey was over but even the ceramic
[55:30] pot once it gets sold and goes to a
[55:32] house I can attest having two little
[55:33] babies that ceramic pot's probably going
[55:35] to get headbutted a few times and shaken
[55:37] and the handles pulled on maybe dropped
[55:40] who knows what is going to get happen to
[55:41] it but the testing is never over that
[55:44] pot will be tested and there will be as
[55:46] brother Israel spoke this morning
[55:47] there's Seasons there'll be seasons of
[55:49] that test and there will be some that
[55:51] are probably a little bit easier than
[55:52] others some that are a little bit harder
[55:55] all
[55:56] right but the testing it's not because
[55:58] the Potter is mad at it what he's
[56:00] created he actually just wants what's
[56:02] best for it the Potter he he's not angry
[56:05] at his creation he would and went off
[56:06] went through all the trouble to have
[56:08] that
[56:09] creation and test it and do all these
[56:11] things with it and show it this
[56:12] attention and heal it and give it
[56:15] salvation and hang on a cross and die
[56:17] for
[56:18] it he wouldn't have done all that if he
[56:20] didn't love it if he didn't love what he
[56:23] did and the Lord wants to same for us
[56:25] and he knows what's
[56:27] best so brother brandham said in the
[56:29] message I know it's a 1960 paragraph 46
[56:32] I don't know if you getting any of these
[56:34] I don't know I'm not sure okay um and I
[56:38] know uh paragraph 46 he said we ask for
[56:42] comfort and peace God gives us the best
[56:45] he could give us trials and
[56:47] tribulations said that's better than
[56:49] comfort and peace our Comforts is just
[56:52] beyond the
[56:53] river he said it was until the Hebrew
[56:56] children was forced into the fiery
[56:58] furnace on one of their most outstanding
[57:01] trials that they are seen one like the
[57:04] Son of God standing among
[57:07] them I love this he said their troubles
[57:11] produced the son of God standing among
[57:13] them in the breezes to wave away the
[57:17] Heatwave said but not until they went
[57:19] into the fire did the comforter
[57:23] appear he said they troubles produced
[57:25] the son of God standing among them it
[57:28] squeezed them those Hebrew children they
[57:30] had a squeeze put on them they had been
[57:32] told things they had been told you can't
[57:33] do this you can't do that you better do
[57:35] this or else they were squeezed tight
[57:38] and the only thing out of them that that
[57:40] squeeze produced was genuine faith that
[57:44] is exactly what that squeeze produced
[57:46] out of those Hebrew children you know
[57:48] they they were they were squeezed and
[57:50] squeezed but when they came out of that
[57:52] fiery furnace with no burn marks there
[57:54] wasn't no bleeding I bet they weren even
[57:57] sweating bet it wasn't even hot I it
[57:59] felt like 69° in the house or something
[58:03] 70° but if they have walked into that
[58:05] furnace saying oh it's all over now
[58:07] God's forsaken us God Don't Care About
[58:09] Us this fire is too much for me this
[58:12] fire is going to overtake me it may have
[58:14] turned out different I can't say I don't
[58:16] know if it would have but it may
[58:18] have but they said our God is able to
[58:22] deliver us and that Faith produced the
[58:24] Son of God to come on the
[58:28] scene and and I found this uh the next
[58:30] quote I found this striking that they
[58:33] didn't even have a promise like ours to
[58:35] put their faith
[58:37] in they didn't have anything like what
[58:39] we have what we have access to we got
[58:41] all the message we got all the Bible we
[58:43] can access it in in one second I could
[58:46] have it pulled up on my phone almost and
[58:48] they didn't have none of that they say
[58:50] God is
[58:52] able brother brandham said in God hath a
[58:55] provided way paragraph
[58:59] 110 he said he did the same thing he was
[59:01] going to glorify himself in the Hebrew
[59:03] children he made a preparation when did
[59:07] he make it the Hebrew children didn't
[59:08] have any promise they couldn't get back
[59:10] here and reading the Bible and say Lord
[59:12] you promised in your word that any of
[59:14] your children ever went into a fiery
[59:15] furnace you would deliver them all right
[59:18] Lord we're coming right there upon that
[59:22] well that wouldn't have been so hard to
[59:23] do just their Fai
[59:25] because God had already promised it
[59:26] that's that's us today that brother
[59:28] bram's talking about he said that
[59:29] wouldn't be so hard to do God promised
[59:30] it you got in the word to me it was kind
[59:33] of funny how he just he talked about
[59:34] that he said it wouldn't be that hard to
[59:36] do you know God promised it and that's
[59:38] us today we have all of that we have
[59:40] access to every bit of
[59:43] that and he said but God hadn't promised
[59:46] them no such thing imagine that what
[59:49] walking towards a fiery furnace that's
[59:51] huge and just fire on the inside fire as
[59:53] tall as you are
[59:55] and you don't know what God has promised
[59:57] you you just believe in him you believe
[59:59] he's able you believe he has the ability
[1:00:02] to rescue you from that but he's never
[1:00:05] promised it he's never told you he's
[1:00:08] never spoke to you in his word nothing
[1:00:11] imagine
[1:00:12] that he said but here's the words they
[1:00:15] had God was so real to them they said
[1:00:16] our God is able how about that the F
[1:00:19] that don't believe in Divine Healing God
[1:00:21] is able to deliver us come these y
[1:00:24] furnace but will not bow down to your
[1:00:27] images and when they walked into the
[1:00:29] fiery furnace upon bare sheer faith that
[1:00:33] God was able not promised but he was
[1:00:36] able God sent Christ in the fiery
[1:00:39] furnace and fan the fire away from them
[1:00:41] and protected them and brought them out
[1:00:44] sure but I'm saying God is
[1:00:49] able he said now you don't come saying
[1:00:52] God is able you don't have to come that
[1:00:54] you can say God you promised amen you
[1:00:57] have his word said you prepared it at
[1:01:00] Calvary and I've come to receive it it's
[1:01:02] your preparation you provided it and you
[1:01:05] promised it and I see others receiving
[1:01:07] it said so I come too Lord to get my
[1:01:10] part of
[1:01:11] it he said you'll go away a different
[1:01:15] person he said you'll go away with such
[1:01:17] an anchor inside your soul that nothing
[1:01:20] can upset you you know that you're
[1:01:23] healed you know that God has taken care
[1:01:25] of this matter for you because he
[1:01:27] promised
[1:01:29] you brother Bram said he gives testings
[1:01:32] and trials with these promises and he
[1:01:35] wants to see who you'll tone to he wants
[1:01:37] to see if
[1:01:38] you'll maybe that's why we're tested he
[1:01:41] want he wants to see if you'll fall back
[1:01:42] drop back a little bit or if you'll ask
[1:01:44] him for some help you'll say Lord I I
[1:01:46] don't know what to do in this situation
[1:01:48] this is this situation has outgrown me
[1:01:49] completely I'm not sure what to do but I
[1:01:51] know who knows what to do that's all you
[1:01:54] got got to do just go go to them in
[1:01:57] prayer and I I had a I thought of this
[1:02:00] during brother Israel's sermon this
[1:02:01] morning I can't remember what made me
[1:02:03] think of it but it it made me think
[1:02:05] about like a train ride you come up on a
[1:02:07] tunnel and the tunnel's dark and you go
[1:02:09] in the
[1:02:11] tunnel and you can't see the end and
[1:02:14] it's not because there's not an end it's
[1:02:16] just you can't see the
[1:02:18] end but going into the tunnel you didn't
[1:02:20] realize it's a tunnel that's got to turn
[1:02:22] like this and so you're going through
[1:02:24] the tunnel you just haven't got to your
[1:02:27] turn yet and it starts turning it starts
[1:02:29] turning and little by little you see a
[1:02:31] sliver of light here sliver of light
[1:02:33] there and then pretty soon Your Eyes Are
[1:02:36] Fixed On the exit you have faith in that
[1:02:39] exit you know it's there you see the
[1:02:41] light completely it might have been a
[1:02:43] story about the boy in Awin bicycle I
[1:02:45] think that's what it was um but how much
[1:02:47] more face should we have all that's been
[1:02:49] given to us with struggles and trials
[1:02:52] and we're we're not facing a fiery
[1:02:53] furnace right now now I'm glad I'm not
[1:02:57] cuz I don't know if I have what they had
[1:02:58] yet but I'm hoping I'll get it I have
[1:03:00] faith that I'll get it I'm trusting in
[1:03:02] the Lord for
[1:03:05] it so thinking on that manifest token
[1:03:09] topic who knows what a touchstone is if
[1:03:11] you heard brother brandom talk about
[1:03:12] that in the message I think he mentions
[1:03:14] it a few time it's a stone and it's a
[1:03:16] black stone they'll take uh like it it
[1:03:19] used to be an old way to prove what kind
[1:03:20] of metal you had if you had gold if you
[1:03:22] had silver or what you had when you're
[1:03:24] trying to sell it and mostly used for
[1:03:26] gold and they would take the gold and
[1:03:28] they had the stone and they had a line
[1:03:31] they used friction against a stone and
[1:03:33] they already had a line that was real
[1:03:34] gold there and what the touch Stone did
[1:03:37] was if you were claiming to have a gold
[1:03:38] ring you'd take that ring off and they'd
[1:03:40] take the Touchstone and they'd start
[1:03:42] scraping it real hard against it the
[1:03:44] friction and so they'd scrape it and
[1:03:46] scrape it and then they would compare
[1:03:48] the two to see if it was real gold or
[1:03:49] not they' put it through a test to see
[1:03:51] if that gold was legitimate or to see if
[1:03:54] you had of Fate
[1:03:55] Kon and so so by what the gold produces
[1:03:58] from the friction against the Touchstone
[1:04:01] that's what told if it was real gold or
[1:04:02] not that friction produced that real
[1:04:05] gold that friction is what told them
[1:04:08] that it was truly
[1:04:11] gold so brother Bram said I think he
[1:04:13] mentioned it twice in the message he
[1:04:15] said the man that has good gold don't
[1:04:17] mind going to the touching Stone he he
[1:04:20] ain't scared of it he don't mind getting
[1:04:22] tested he don't mind it coming he knows
[1:04:24] it's coming he's he's got a gold ring
[1:04:26] he's going to sell and he takes it up
[1:04:27] there and he knows the test is coming
[1:04:29] but he don't care because he knows
[1:04:31] that's genuine gold that he's got and
[1:04:33] just like us we know what we have here
[1:04:36] we know what that Pillar of Fire
[1:04:38] represented we know what dying on the
[1:04:40] cross meant for us we have real gold
[1:04:43] it's not fake it's not phony it's real
[1:04:46] gold and another way they use for gold
[1:04:48] brother brandham said in conferences
[1:04:51] paragraph 86 he said in the old days the
[1:04:54] only way they had to separate it was a
[1:04:57] beater he said beat the gold with a
[1:04:59] hammer like the Indians beat it and the
[1:05:01] only way that the beater knew that he
[1:05:03] had the gold ready was when he beat all
[1:05:06] the dross out of it and I didn't know
[1:05:07] what dross was I never heard of that I
[1:05:09] had no idea so draw is actually it's a
[1:05:11] mass of solid
[1:05:13] impurities it's stuff that it's not
[1:05:15] worth no money has no value it's no good
[1:05:18] it doesn't do anything good for the gold
[1:05:20] it's worthless pretty much and he said
[1:05:23] and he would beat it and turn it over
[1:05:24] and beat it and beat it until all the
[1:05:26] dross went out of
[1:05:29] it he said when he seen his own self
[1:05:32] reflect back into the gold he then knew
[1:05:35] that all the
[1:05:37] dirt and the iron and the foreign
[1:05:39] matters was out of the
[1:05:40] gold so when Christ these tests that he
[1:05:44] allows us to go through when he sees
[1:05:46] himself reflecting back in us he's our
[1:05:50] example when he's reflecting back in our
[1:05:52] lives our day-to-day lives how we're
[1:05:54] talking to people how we're treating
[1:05:56] people you know what we're doing in
[1:05:57] church just who you
[1:05:59] are that's what it is and that's the way
[1:06:02] God is trying to do his church is to
[1:06:03] beat it till all the Creeds and the
[1:06:05] nonsense and all the world is beat out
[1:06:07] of it till it reflects back the life of
[1:06:10] Jesus
[1:06:14] Christ if you know that's one of the
[1:06:16] enemies that's what he likes to attack
[1:06:18] people that's his favorite thing to do
[1:06:20] is tell a Christian you aren't actually
[1:06:22] what you believe you are that's a that's
[1:06:24] a big struggle a big test that's that's
[1:06:26] not even a very forceful test he it's he
[1:06:30] just wants you to doubt who you are and
[1:06:32] what your position is in this
[1:06:34] word and as long as he can do that and
[1:06:36] keep you subdued like the faith and fear
[1:06:38] there's two roads as long as he can keep
[1:06:41] you down fear and you're subdued and you
[1:06:43] don't believe who this message tells you
[1:06:45] you are he can keep you trapped it's
[1:06:48] like that monkey he's got his hand in
[1:06:49] there he's got his peanuts but he can't
[1:06:51] get it out you're trapped you're staying
[1:06:52] right there until through Revelation you
[1:06:55] can realize whom you
[1:06:57] are cuz truly he's scared of what will
[1:07:00] happen if you know who you are I had a I
[1:07:02] left my phone in there I had a quote I
[1:07:04] did want to read it's on my phone though
[1:07:06] um I'm not going to try and paraphrase
[1:07:08] it I'd probably miss it up but you know
[1:07:11] every lie that he tells you is usually a
[1:07:14] truth about himself everything he tries
[1:07:17] to tell you you are is you you know old
[1:07:19] saying when you're pointing at somebody
[1:07:21] telling them what they are you got these
[1:07:22] three pointing right back at you right
[1:07:24] and so when he's trying to tell you what
[1:07:26] you are what you can't do what Authority
[1:07:29] you don't have that's all Truth for
[1:07:33] him he's trying to trick you into
[1:07:35] thinking you're like him but you're not
[1:07:37] we're redeemed we have the blood of
[1:07:39] Christ to be under he doesn't he he
[1:07:42] doesn't have nothing to be under so John
[1:07:45] 8:44 says when he speaketh a lie he
[1:07:48] speaketh of his own and to me that's
[1:07:51] usually a pretty good sign of jealousy
[1:07:53] he wants to be you he wish he probably
[1:07:55] wishes he could go back and change a few
[1:07:57] things and have what you
[1:08:00] have so a lot I've always like sports
[1:08:04] broadcasters if you if you've ever
[1:08:05] watched a football game or something or
[1:08:07] seen one so the broadcasters what they
[1:08:09] like to do is criticize the players and
[1:08:11] they talk about the players like they
[1:08:13] could do it better than them they're up
[1:08:15] there sitting there say ah you couldn't
[1:08:17] hit them with that pass across the
[1:08:18] middle you couldn't do that you couldn't
[1:08:19] throw him out from center field but you
[1:08:21] get out there you ain't no can throw a
[1:08:22] ball 10 feet
[1:08:24] but they're up there criticizing from
[1:08:27] the
[1:08:28] outside but that's jealousy that's
[1:08:31] wanting to be who you are that's wanting
[1:08:33] to do what you do and he's just not able
[1:08:36] to do that and he's mad about it but I
[1:08:38] can't help he's mad about it but he says
[1:08:40] stuff like you can't be healed but
[1:08:42] Jesus's Stripes say
[1:08:44] different he says things like you've
[1:08:46] gone too far but then the grace of God
[1:08:48] says
[1:08:50] different he says you're weak-minded
[1:08:52] he he says you got anxiety you're
[1:08:55] depressed you're in a slump right now
[1:08:58] nothing's going good nobody you nobody
[1:09:01] loves you this is all terrible but then
[1:09:04] the love of God and the mind of Christ
[1:09:06] says different the scriptures given us
[1:09:08] ways that he can hit you with all these
[1:09:10] lies but he can't hit you with something
[1:09:12] that's going to defeat the scripture cuz
[1:09:14] nothing defeats the scripture nothing
[1:09:16] defeats this message this word what
[1:09:19] Christ has
[1:09:21] sent but that's the way anything worth
[1:09:24] anything has ever been made through
[1:09:26] pressure through test and pressure you
[1:09:29] don't get a diamond without some intense
[1:09:31] heat and
[1:09:32] pressure you just don't get
[1:09:34] it I loved it it was a I think it was a
[1:09:37] presbyterian minister in the early 1900
[1:09:40] said his name was Peter Marshall he said
[1:09:42] may we may we think of Freedom not as
[1:09:46] the right to do as we please but as the
[1:09:48] opportunity to do what is right he said
[1:09:52] when we long for life without
[1:09:54] difficulties remind us that the Oaks
[1:09:57] grow strong in contrary
[1:10:00] winds and diamonds are made Under
[1:10:04] Pressure he said Oaks thrive in those
[1:10:07] rough winds when other trees fall other
[1:10:10] trees are falling there's a storm coming
[1:10:12] through and this is not it wouldn't have
[1:10:14] been my first guess but I researched a
[1:10:16] little bit and the thing that makes an
[1:10:18] oak so
[1:10:19] tough is not the bark it's not it's not
[1:10:22] the outside of the tree it's not the
[1:10:24] branches how thick they are it's not any
[1:10:27] of those things that you see from the
[1:10:29] outward appearance of that Oak but it's
[1:10:31] The Oak's root
[1:10:32] system it's something unseen it's it's
[1:10:36] an anchor in the ground for that Oak
[1:10:38] that's holding it still now it has it
[1:10:40] has properties about the outside of it
[1:10:42] that's tough you know it's hard to chop
[1:10:44] down an oak
[1:10:46] tree but the roots are what holds it the
[1:10:49] roots steady
[1:10:52] it
[1:10:54] something from underneath the surface
[1:10:56] and so when the the neat thing about a
[1:10:59] Oak's root system is when they're
[1:11:01] planted around each
[1:11:03] other they reach for each other they
[1:11:06] want to interconnect they want to be a
[1:11:07] part of one another and that's what
[1:11:09] makes Oaks that are planted together
[1:11:11] even
[1:11:12] stronger The Oaks will they get planted
[1:11:17] and they reach out for others and they
[1:11:19] bind their s together and they hold so
[1:11:21] when a storm comes maybe this Oak over
[1:11:24] here the wind's only blown this way and
[1:11:25] it's been hit by storms all the time
[1:11:27] this Oak over here ain't never been
[1:11:29] through a storm but because those Oaks
[1:11:32] this this Oak don't know what it feels
[1:11:33] like to go through that storm it ain't
[1:11:35] never been there but the Oaks are
[1:11:37] interconnected underneath there there's
[1:11:39] a there's an invisible Union between
[1:11:42] those oak trees that you can't
[1:11:44] see there's something holding them
[1:11:49] together that's and it just made me
[1:11:51] think you know Fellowship matters that's
[1:11:53] a big thing talking about testing and
[1:11:55] struggles and trials you know Fellowship
[1:11:57] is huge so you know when I'm if I'm
[1:12:00] going through something and I'm in a
[1:12:02] struggle and it comes church night I
[1:12:04] think ah it's just too that's a lot of
[1:12:07] trouble to get get up get dressed go to
[1:12:10] the house of God and worship you know
[1:12:12] I'mma be expected to S expect me to sing
[1:12:15] sit back there and sing I'm going have
[1:12:16] to raise my hand stuff and you know it
[1:12:18] seems like a lot of trouble but when you
[1:12:20] get here and you start
[1:12:22] fellowshipping it's nice and you get
[1:12:25] here and you're like man I like that
[1:12:26] that's nice wow both of them maybe and
[1:12:29] you get to maybe hollering a little bit
[1:12:31] and you get to say an amen and you get
[1:12:32] happy and that's what the Lord does for
[1:12:34] you and that's a test in itself he's put
[1:12:37] you through some or allowed something to
[1:12:39] happen to you and went through that day
[1:12:42] and he's going to say I'm going to see
[1:12:43] what he's going to do this time I'm
[1:12:45] going to see if he's going to take my
[1:12:46] way and go to the house of the Lord and
[1:12:48] worship with his brothers and sisters or
[1:12:50] if he's going to sit here and just
[1:12:52] wallow in it be sad about
[1:12:56] it but that's the same for Christians as
[1:12:59] well exactly the same and I guess so
[1:13:01] Fellowship struck me in this I guess it
[1:13:02] matters to me so much cuz when there was
[1:13:05] times when I didn't really want
[1:13:07] to when I first came to church there was
[1:13:10] times when I didn't want to keep going
[1:13:12] even in life you know I I wanted it
[1:13:15] there was days where before I was a
[1:13:17] Christian I wanted it to be all over but
[1:13:19] the people that the Lord placed in my
[1:13:21] life and the oak trees that he put my
[1:13:23] life
[1:13:24] then the only reason I'm still here
[1:13:27] today you know I I was praying then and
[1:13:30] I I wouldn't realize I'd be praying you
[1:13:32] know Lord I want these things that I'm
[1:13:33] struggling with I need help and you know
[1:13:36] what I wanted some mystical help like it
[1:13:38] be swept away from me and just I never
[1:13:40] never think about it again well that can
[1:13:42] happen too God can do that but what he
[1:13:45] can also do is Place oak trees in your
[1:13:47] life he can put people in your life
[1:13:49] there to guide you and to help you and I
[1:13:52] had those people plac in my life when I
[1:13:54] went to church I had oak trees that I
[1:13:56] were around I had people I could lean on
[1:13:58] people that their root systems ran deep
[1:14:00] and they were tied together and I was
[1:14:02] just a tiny little Oak I'm still tiny
[1:14:03] little
[1:14:04] Oak but I had them to lean
[1:14:10] on and in Clos closing I'd like to
[1:14:13] mention maybe one more example of
[1:14:16] testing uh what about steel you know
[1:14:19] steel to build buildings to build a
[1:14:22] church to build whatever you want to
[1:14:23] build with
[1:14:24] it in the first stages of making steel
[1:14:27] it's not ready to support those things I
[1:14:29] just named it's not there yet and the
[1:14:32] very first step is metal casting there's
[1:14:34] a mold and you pulled into the mold and
[1:14:37] it's a specific mold for this part of
[1:14:39] that building there's different molds
[1:14:41] there's different parts to a skyscraper
[1:14:42] it's not all I beams or o beams or
[1:14:46] whatever beam they want to call it it's
[1:14:47] not all just one set of beams it's
[1:14:49] different beams that come into a
[1:14:51] collective to help one another and it
[1:14:54] helps one another to build that
[1:14:56] building they they Fellowship together
[1:14:59] and they lock together and then there's
[1:15:01] a skyscraper all of a sudden a huge
[1:15:04] beautiful Skyscraper with these simple
[1:15:06] little things that have been made to
[1:15:08] hold them
[1:15:10] together and it they go through some
[1:15:12] tough tests to qualify to be the
[1:15:14] structure of a building the the first
[1:15:16] test they go through is tensile testing
[1:15:19] and that's done to decide how the steel
[1:15:20] responds when you apply Force to it
[1:15:24] so they test it they'll they'll bend it
[1:15:27] and test it and try and shape it
[1:15:29] different ways and they'll see you know
[1:15:31] they'll they'll leave it there like that
[1:15:33] for a long time to see what it can
[1:15:35] withstand to see it to see if it'll come
[1:15:37] out okay or to see if it'll eventually
[1:15:42] break so very similar to The Clay Pot
[1:15:45] steel also goes through a burning out
[1:15:46] process to get all the impurities out to
[1:15:49] get everything that doesn't need to be
[1:15:51] in the makeup of that steel out of the
[1:15:52] steel steel and this is probably out of
[1:15:55] all these this probably my favorite step
[1:15:57] of the steel making
[1:15:59] process and I it has a lot of big words
[1:16:01] so I did have to plagiarize it pretty
[1:16:04] much
[1:16:05] completely it says for says for Reliable
[1:16:09] longevity and to Bear extreme weight
[1:16:11] structural steel must be of the right
[1:16:16] composition now this is it says iron say
[1:16:18] iron here and carbon are two of the most
[1:16:21] vital components used by steel mills
[1:16:24] when making structural steel it says the
[1:16:27] carbon lends strength to the iron ore
[1:16:31] which is a source for the Iron and Steel
[1:16:34] and it's said that the iron is quite
[1:16:35] soft on its own so what happens as those
[1:16:39] components come together and the carbon
[1:16:42] in that steel goes to the iron and fuses
[1:16:45] together with it to make it one to form
[1:16:49] something
[1:16:51] together the iron itself said is quite
[1:16:53] soft on its own it can't do it on its
[1:16:55] own it's not good enough it's not worthy
[1:16:58] it can't have it without that and that's
[1:17:00] what the blood of Christ has to us we
[1:17:02] can't do it without his blood it has his
[1:17:05] Spirit has to come down and fuse with us
[1:17:08] just the same as that carbon fuses with
[1:17:10] that iron because we're soft on our own
[1:17:13] we're weak we can't do it think about
[1:17:15] before you knew the Lord were you doing
[1:17:17] it then I wasn't I wasn't anywhere
[1:17:22] close
[1:17:23] and it says to achieve loadbearing
[1:17:25] capacity structural steel must have a
[1:17:28] higher carbon content by weight it says
[1:17:32] in manufacturers can increase the amount
[1:17:34] of carbon according to the level of
[1:17:36] strength its application requires so it
[1:17:38] saids it needs a higher carbon content
[1:17:42] by
[1:17:43] weight so the carbon in this type would
[1:17:47] be the Holy Ghost and you need more of
[1:17:49] him in you than you and
[1:17:51] you you need quite a bit more of him in
[1:17:54] you and that's what I want today I want
[1:17:57] more of him in me I want more and more I
[1:17:59] want to be like each one of these types
[1:18:01] I want to be like the pot I want to be
[1:18:03] like the steel I want to be like the oak
[1:18:05] tree I want to be a oak tree I want my
[1:18:07] my roots to nobody has to see how tough
[1:18:09] I
[1:18:10] am but with the Holy Ghost in here that
[1:18:14] I'm rooted I got an anchor I've got
[1:18:16] something to hold on to something that
[1:18:18] runs deeper than any outward appearance
[1:18:21] of toughness or shown that I could take
[1:18:24] whatever the world's got to throw at me
[1:18:26] I have something more than that
[1:18:27] something
[1:18:29] unseen so as the musicians come I have
[1:18:31] maybe one more quote I'd like to read
[1:18:34] and it's a it's a long one but it's a
[1:18:37] good
[1:18:38] one and it is
[1:18:40] in go tell my disciples starting at
[1:18:44] paragraph
[1:18:48] 158 he says standing sometime ago I was
[1:18:51] standing at Gary Indiana where they
[1:18:53] taken me through the big Gary steel
[1:18:55] mills and I was very much alarmed while
[1:18:58] I was watching the superintendent taken
[1:19:00] me up and he was showing me all around
[1:19:01] the place and he said I was watching the
[1:19:03] men said a little whistle tooted 5
[1:19:06] minutes before quitting time I noticed
[1:19:08] every man taken his apron off and laid
[1:19:10] it upon machine upon the machines and
[1:19:13] right out through around his lays and
[1:19:15] things and he was sweeping out into the
[1:19:17] aisle a bunch of shavings that had been
[1:19:20] collected from the material he was
[1:19:21] working on
[1:19:23] and he swept them all out in the aisle
[1:19:25] and he said I'll show you something here
[1:19:26] Reverend brandom I said all right he
[1:19:28] said then he walked back to a little
[1:19:29] place after the main whistle blowed all
[1:19:32] the men went out everybody was clear
[1:19:34] from the building we were left standing
[1:19:36] alone and he pressed a button and Away
[1:19:38] back in the back I heard of something
[1:19:40] run Thunder and Roar and Burr coming
[1:19:43] down I thought what is that after a
[1:19:46] while he said now you stand to his side
[1:19:49] I stood
[1:19:50] aside he said I I seen a track coming
[1:19:54] down through there and when it did here
[1:19:56] come a great magnet coming down through
[1:19:59] excuse me and as the magnet passed down
[1:20:02] through the line I begin to notice those
[1:20:04] shavings flying up to meet it like that
[1:20:07] then metal shavings and I when I was
[1:20:10] reading this you know maybe it was a
[1:20:12] metal shaving maybe it was a little bit
[1:20:14] bigger piece maybe there's a little bit
[1:20:15] bigger piece than that fly up to meet
[1:20:17] that magnet but they were all pure steel
[1:20:20] it didn't matter how big you were it
[1:20:22] didn't matter what you were as long as
[1:20:23] you were pure steel that's what that
[1:20:26] magnet required the magnet only had one
[1:20:28] requirement is that you are
[1:20:31] steel said I noticed some of them didn't
[1:20:33] come up and I noticed several pieces of
[1:20:35] iron didn't come up and that magnet went
[1:20:37] on back over into the Capa and melt
[1:20:40] dropped all this stuff down into the
[1:20:41] Capa and it was melted and made over
[1:20:43] again and I said well why didn't it all
[1:20:46] raise up I said I see some shavings he
[1:20:48] said Reverend brandom we make some
[1:20:50] aluminum parts here he said those
[1:20:51] aluminum pieces are not magnetized to
[1:20:54] that magnet I said praise the Lord and I
[1:20:57] said he said what's the matter with you
[1:20:59] I said I was just thinking so I said why
[1:21:01] didn't them iron pieces go up said if
[1:21:03] you noted they are bolted down they
[1:21:06] can't raise up I said praise God
[1:21:09] hallelujah he said what's the matter
[1:21:11] Reverend brandom I said I was just
[1:21:13] thinking said you must have been I said
[1:21:15] brother way back Yonder somewhere in
[1:21:17] eternity's Hallelujah there is a great
[1:21:20] magnet the Son of God is going to be
[1:21:22] turned loose one of these mornings he is
[1:21:25] sweeping down over the Earth like a
[1:21:27] magnet and every soul that's magnetized
[1:21:30] to him will go up to meet him in the air
[1:21:34] and there will be in the resurrection to
[1:21:37] live with him be taken out yonder and
[1:21:39] these old bodies that we now live in or
[1:21:42] even like we have now that's getting old
[1:21:44] and crinkling up and dropping down will
[1:21:46] be dropped Over Yonder into the Capa of
[1:21:49] dust and molded over and made like unto
[1:21:51] his own glorious body in the final
[1:21:54] Resurrection when he comes again you
[1:21:56] know without all the tests that that
[1:21:57] steel went through up to that point it
[1:22:00] wouldn't have been ready for that magnet
[1:22:01] to sweep over it those tests had a
[1:22:03] purpose those struggles had a purpose
[1:22:06] those things those days that were hard
[1:22:08] to get through had a purpose and they
[1:22:11] shaped and molded that steel and they
[1:22:13] made it true steel that steel it
[1:22:15] accepted that carbon that iron accepted
[1:22:18] the carbon and formed something greater
[1:22:20] it Formed something Everlasting
[1:22:23] that's what it does in our
[1:22:24] lives and I said well now look at here
[1:22:27] there's many people that's not
[1:22:28] magnetized there's many people that's
[1:22:30] bolted down with circumstances say I
[1:22:32] can't do it I just couldn't do it it's
[1:22:34] too much of a
[1:22:36] price brother except that heart is
[1:22:38] changed and that Soul sitting under
[1:22:41] magnetized with God by the Holy Ghost
[1:22:43] when Jesus comes you'll be left on Earth
[1:22:45] alone remember there will be a
[1:22:48] resurrection one of these mornings only
[1:22:50] for those that are dead in Christ will
[1:22:52] God bring with
[1:22:54] him I would like to be one of those as I
[1:22:58] said earlier I want to be one of those I
[1:22:59] don't care if I'm a clay pot a clay vase
[1:23:03] I don't care what I am but as long as I
[1:23:05] go through that testing and that trying
[1:23:07] that's what I want to be for
[1:23:09] myself I want to be that piece of Steel
[1:23:12] that can be put in the building that can
[1:23:13] help the building I don't care if I'm
[1:23:15] the smallest piece I don't care if I'm
[1:23:17] the biggest piece but I want to go
[1:23:20] through that testing I want to be a
[1:23:21] pieace I want to be a
[1:23:24] part and that's just my prayer this
[1:23:26] morning to be
[1:23:27] a when that great magnet comes through I
[1:23:30] want to go up and meet it in the
[1:23:32] air amen God bless
[1:23:37] [Applause]
