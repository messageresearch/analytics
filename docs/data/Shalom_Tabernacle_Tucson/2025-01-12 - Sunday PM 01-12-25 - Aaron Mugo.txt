light our souls on fire let us be a light for you yes we ask this in the name of Jesus Christ amen thank you thank you musicians um it's good to be here in Arizona nice to meet all of you here um like he like uh brother Israel said it's my first time here um and I already enjoyed it it's uh it's uh first time I've had Mexican food apparently cuz anything before this was not Mexican food and uh I was blessed by that I'm blessed by Brother Moore being able to he he's been hosting us him and his wife his family very kind and uh uh I appreciate the invite to come share the word with you um I bring greetings from the Saints back at our church we've had some ministers come through here um and uh I I couldn't possibly fill their shoes brother lingar brother Chris Kathy brother uh Trevor Eman I couldn't possibly do that but uh I hope whatever word here that the Lord uh gave me to give to you is um is a blessing right mate um if you'd open your Bibles we're going to go to Deuteronomy 6 that'll be Deuteronomy chapter 6 and verse six it says in these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shalt talk of them when thou sest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and on thy Gates you may be seated thank you so um it's hard to know where to begin because there's so much to share um this scripture here is talking about the word and uh there's so much word to share right you know we we come to church all the time and we get to hear an amazing pastor and evangelist and brother over here brother Moore whoever whoever's local and ministering in the church um and you can't possibly remember it all right nobody expects you to you're not going no one expects you to do that um and yet it's telling you to bind it in your heart right so uh whenever I read that I'm thinking to myself I need to let that word whatever it is I may not remember every single sentence that somebody says when they're preaching or I may not remember everything I read in the Bible or here on a tape but I will let it affect my heart and let my heart be changed I can do that right that's all we want right uh that's why I asked my wife actually to sing that song Thank you for singing that love um word of God speak because we come here to hear God's word right um we don't want to hear people's opinion right like if I came over here and I didn't read any quotes or scriptures and I was trying to preach to you guys you probably would You' be like Israel are you sure about this guy why' you bring him here and if they didn't show it to you over here you wouldn't like that right but if you know the SCE and where the source is coming from then you know you're kind of willing to receive right right okay now stick with me here um I'm going to prove that there are words that God gives us and when God gives you a word it's your duty and your right to speak that word okay not just to hear it but to speak it all right so just listen here uh let's go actually in you can just follow with me in the Bible if you have your Bibles uh Genesis chapter 2 verse 25 I'm going to start bringing some words out in the scripture right and these are from your actual Bible so you don't have to doubt anything I'm saying because I'm going to read it to you and you're going to read it yourselves right promise me come on come on you're going to read it yourselves right yeah all right there's your guarantee Genesis 2:25 I'm going to talk about this word uh the word naked it says and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed so that's right after the creation of man and his wife and God gave them physical bodies and they were naked but get this they didn't know that right they were not ashamed because they didn't know it so they didn't know this word so whenever God was speaking to them it was not in their vocabulary right yeah okay so skip over to Genesis chapter 3 this is right after they ate of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil that fruit they were told not to eat of and that's uh verse 7 and it says and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked see right before that they did not have a need for this word in their vocabulary right and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons so up until this point they don't know this word naked and God created them for a purpose amen and he created them uh in in order to to be to have dominion over the world right that's what God told man to do he had him name all of his creation he had him completely in control of everything and so their purpose was just to follow that purpose that God had created them for but then whenever this word enters into their vocabulary and they know this word and they start applying this word well guess what where did the word come from it didn't come from God he didn't teach them this word right it's her interest interaction Eve with the serpent and with the Devil the devil is the one who taught her this word and so when the devil taught her this word she starts applying this word on her own self and then she comes to this point where she starts professing that and then when her language and her vocabulary changes her purpose changes and their purpose Chang and it stopped being about having dominion and telling doing what God told them to do and the purpose became cover my nakedness they started sewing up fig leaves because their purpose changed because their language changed and their language didn't come from God so you know you know it goes down in verse 10 same chapter verse n actually God God is looking for Adam he's like you're you're not doing what I called you to do right so he starts walking around he's like Adam Where Art Thou it says in the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou verse 10 and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself in the first thing God is like whoa you're using a word I've never even heard come out of your lips he said and he said who told you that th was naked cuz something changed here that you're saying about yourself that I didn't say about you and from there was a down downhill slope right there for mankind not there are a lot of things people have told us in our lives about ourselves and the problem with us as humans as we accept those things and then once we start professing those things we don't get to live up to our potential a lot of things in life now if we actually just took the thing took the word and said okay the God said something about me right he said I am a chosen generation I'm a royal priesthood those are great words but then when we start throwing that aside and we start hearing words like oh I just went to the dentist he told me I had menitis menitis tell me is the word menitis in the Bible no if God said that I don't have that then I don't have that if God said that he's going to heal me and keep me away from things like menitis like cancer that's not in the Bible but here they are people what you do is you go to the doctor and through his manly wisdom with words that doctors made up and then start applying to us and he tells you oh here's your diagnosis you have periodon Titus I'm just using medical terms I don't really know what they mean but they're not in here so I don't need to know what they mean right God didn't apply that word to me so that's not a word for me that's not in my vocabulary if he says I am loved then I am loved if he says I am perfect then I am perfect maybe I can't see that right now with my own lip with my own eyes maybe I can't see that right this second but I can profess it because God told me that I'm going to be perfected God told me that I have a theophany God told me that I am his bride and those things are things that I can apply for myself as soon as I keep speaking those words over my life those words over the lives of my brother and my sister stop dragging people down with your words people you're tearing them down you're bringing them down parents of children you just keep telling them they they're failure that they're never going to grow up to be something that's a pet pee for me that's a pet pee for me cuz then those same children you drag them all the way to church and say you have to be in service and guess what those children come and start talking to ministers like my dad he said the worst things about me what am I supposed to say you create if you think about it if you think about it God uses his words and every time he speaks something he can't take it back because it's perfect that's right right that's because he's a Creator right he is perfect he can't say a promise without it coming to pass he can't pronounce a blessing without it coming to pass he can't pronounce a curse without it coming to pass so everything he says has to be good in his mind before he says it right and what are we his children sir that's right are we not amateur creators huh those same people who start professing bad things over their children or pastors who say bad things about their congregation you're not perfect you you you need to go get baptized you're a sinner you're useless you're worthless those things they just keep pronouncing them over the people and then what they do is they create these broken creatures and then say this is my offering to the Lord what you that you used your power for the wrong thing it's a creative power and whenever you take a create a power of God and you know you know those are words that the devil makes up right and he starts to apply them on people he starts to use your lips to speak upon people with your own mouth and if those words came from the Devil the devil can't can't create right he can't create he can pervert that's what the prophet said he said he perverts perverts so you're creating a perverted creature and then you're you're wondering why it's not perfect because that's not what God said about that child of yours that's not what God said about each one of the people in the congregation everybody here has the potential to get the Holy Spirit everybody has the potential to goow to be a perfect thing because God said so not my opinion not what I think it's what God Said in the Harvest Time 1964 uh brother brandom says in verse 241 says now notice if it was possible he's talking about deceiving the elect if it was possible in these days only one word one word is needed that's all satan had to have to Adam just get him on one word that's all he has to have today just get one thing turned around that's all that's all he needs now you know that's the truth to add one or take one it's total failure every bit every word of God think of now of the interpretations of the seminaries everyone different from the other so whenever we as Christians are supposed to take on the whole word of God yes it's great that you know the God sent a prophet yeah and he He restored all the word amen amen right He restored all the word and I can accept everything he said for myself but you can't leave a single thing out and how can you you don't have to I'm not saying you have to memorize everything that's in the table appp that that that's not going to happen right but you can accept everything in the table appp every time you hear what the prophet said for you in your day you can accept that and allow that to work itself on you right and if you do that then the devil will find fewer and fewer opportunities to get one over on You by adding or taking something away why because even though you might not have everything memorized when you hear something that's a little bit off does doesn't sound like the rest of it you realize huh that word isn't H I don't I'm not going to take that for myself because that doesn't line up with everything else that I heard amen I'm going to do a second word over here it is the word uh rain actually so in Genesis chapter 2 it says and this is uh God talking about this is God uh when he's uh creating the world so the world the way was made before is not the way it is right now in the past it didn't rain that wasn't a thing so if you read in the in the in Genesis chapter 2 right talks about the firmament of water and there's water above it and beneath it and uh we're going to read that right here it says in verse four these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the Earth and there was not a man to till the ground so rain was just not a thing not until Noah comes on the scene in Genesis 6 uh you you see God actually he's repenting because he made man because his works are evil and he decides that he's going to have to judge the Earth One Way or Another now we know that you know God he decided to judge him by by water that time and it's going to be fire next time but at that time he decided to use water and that's the reason that he had water above the firmament in the first place so he decides he's going to make it rain so what he does is uh in in Genesis 7 he's talking to Noah in verse four he says for yet seven days and I will cause it to rain upon the Earth 40 days and 40 nights and every living substance that I made will I destroy from off the face of the Earth so at this point Noah he hears a message from God and he he he had actually heard from God before that in the chapter before and God had told him hey you I'm going to judge the Earth and all that stuff is going to happen so he's preaching for years until God comes back and reveals to him that it's going to rain it's going to be rain that's doing this so Noah goes to these people in this scientific age brother brandham tells us it was super scientific and he has to tell them hey water's gonna start falling from the sky and water's never done this before right and the scientists are just like well you know what we have we have all our instruments that measure this and that atmospheric pressure barometers blah blah blah science words insert and whenever he whenever they do that he he's like well it's going to rain and they're like rain what is that that doesn't that that's not in our vocabulary they can look in every book they have they don't have the word rain but he said God said it's going to rain and he had to stick with that message now God he he was doing a new thing in that day and they had to accept that for themselves but they just couldn't get to that point just because they couldn't measure it with what they could see with their eyes or touch or feel they could have the only thing they could have latched on to was that Faith was was faith in what the word of God for the prophet was saying right and that was rain now if you come to um further on in the Bible we're still following just going in a straight line we're going to see the language that people are using what they're trying to do to pervert what God is saying and uh the next example is actually in Genesis chapter one um notice everything goes back to Genesis and then comes forward right Genesis 1 and two and then so back at the Tower of Babel um when before all languages started getting confused they started to try to imitate what God was doing and what they were imitating is what he had done in chapter 26 now man God decides to make man and he says in Genesis 26 it says and God said let us make man in our image just remember those two words let us make man in our image after our likeness and after that you know he creates man and to have dominion and everything then you skip over to Genesis 11 in verse 3 and 4 the same same people who are building the Tower of Babel start trying to imitate what God was doing back then and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they for Mortar and they said go too let us build a city and a tower whose top May reach unto heaven and let us make a name lest we be scattered upon the face of the whole earth so they are imitating what God is saying but they're doing it the wrong way right and God knows because they they have this unity and this one Accord and everybody speaking one language he says they're actually going to be successful so in in uh verse 5 he says and the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of man builded and the Lord said behold the people is one and they have one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do nothing's going to stop them because they have that one language remember back at the beginning when I started talking I said their purpose changed because their vocabulary changed so they start borrowing God's vocabulary and they have one purpose and one mind one Accord and they all have one language and their purpose is to build this Tower and God said they're going to be successful what could that mean for us as Christians if every Christian was speaking the same not the same Earthly language but God's language if everybody was speaking the language of the word and was actually doing the same thing together and everybody working together in the church what would happen if we as a church church right here locally how many people are in here like 50 60 70 I don't know how many people are here but if everybody who's listening to my voice was one Accord had one goal in mind and that was to further the kingdom of God what would happen nothing would stand in our way there'd be nothing to stop us but we all just have to get in tune with what God's telling us to do amen we just need to pray and get into that place wherever that that channel right there where God he's speaking straight into our minds and then we only speak the things that God says to to speak over our lives over our neighbors over those people around us what would happen we do better than building some dumb Tower it's not about building a church it's not about I I I don't know what it's it's about the kingdom of God it's not about a building much as God can bless you with a building amen but it's not about that it's about his kingdom what can we do for him can I do for Jesus what is he telling me in this moment to do that will help my brother and help my sister that's what I need to know so in verse 7 he says go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another speech he hit them right where it hurt that's the one thing that was keeping them all together and we all know like come on humans love to divide over differences let's be honest right everybody finds a reason to not not like somebody and it's just how it works oh you were born the next County over I don't like you you must support that team you know and then automatically have a preconception about that person oh you're a different race than me ah I can't deal with you you know oh you speak a different language from me now all of these things humans are just built that way and God knows it but if we could get in one Accord and completely set aside those differences and realize that we're all of One blood all born of to the same God same baptism same same hope same faith if if if we could all get right in that channel and realize we have the same background because it came from before the foundation of the world we're all from the same place and that being said there is no difference between me and you there may be a difference in our understanding of the word but hey we're all one guess what God called us into the same word into the same faith and the same baptism so the Lord scattered them abroad from a face upon the uh from then upon the face of the Earth and they left off to build the city so their vocabulary changed and their purpose changed now I'm going to ask the sister at the back is it sister Melissa could you put up um the first picture it's like an image of where they uh dispersed from so the Tower of Babel it's generally believed to be around in Iraq in the Middle East and you can see where the children actually went to all the arrows are pointing in different directions so jaffi is you know he went up north to Europe and ham his children went down to Africa and then Shem was Asia and Middle East and all that stuff so that's where they all dispersed it and God ordained that he wanted them to be dispersed he wanted that that that whole plan of theirs to fall apart so the next word I'm going to focus on still moving down through your Bible amen going through Exodus going Exodus actually uh chapter 16 see God he might do a new thing in order to judge the Earth and that would be uh rain he he created something new that had never be done before just to judge the Earth but he can also do the same thing to bless us right if he decides he's going to give you something it doesn't matter what you've ever heard before if if it's never happened before he decided it's going to happen it's going to happen because he said so amen and he has to stand by his word 16 verse uh 14 it's talking about the first time Mana landed outside near the children of Israel it said when the Dew that was that lay was gone up behold upon the face of the Wilderness there lay a small round thing as small as the hor frost on the ground and when the children of Israel saw it they said one to another it is Mana for they wi not what it was it is Mana so they had to make up a new word because God was blessing them in a way that had never happened before they had to make up something to describe what was happening because what was happening was exceedingly abundantly above anything that anybody had ever experienced or seen before and they said oh wow mana and and if you look up the the definition for this word actually if you look it up the translation of it is what is it like the word just means what is it because I I don't know I don't know what this is it's just God did it that's all I can say and I receive it for me if God decided he's going to bless you if God decided that he's going to do something for you in your life there's nothing that can stand in the way of that and you might not be able to describe it and be like you know what if somebody ask me to testify it's it's terrifying standing up here with like I don't know how many people staring at you but maybe I can't get up here and testify but I can just say God did something and I'm so excited about that because God did something in my life and I just want him to get the glory from that amen I don't care what people said that was negative about me I don't know what they pronounced about me over my life and said oh brother Aaron's a loser brother Aaron's like I don't know he has a high voice he sounds like a girl yes that's true I mean I don't care but God bless me brother Aaron can't sing brother Aaron's uneducated brother Aaron he isn't even a brother he doesn't see the word the right way he's not even a good preacher he's garbage it doesn't matter God did something for me and I'm here to tell you about that and I'm only going to say what God said about me cuz I don't need to hear all that negativity that negativity is not for me God did something in my life that you can't describe and you can't replicate so don't you try to judge me with the words that the devil gave you you to speak out of your mouth on me I don't receive that ner ner when I was a kid you'd say I'm rubber you're glue whatever you say bounces off of me and sticks to you keep that for yourself I don't want to hear it God didn't say it the devil said it that's why the Jesus turned to Peter and said get behind me Satan now I don't prescribe saying that to your brother and your sister but I'll think it real hard [Laughter] though I'm going to say something new right something new something new right you want to hear a new word from the word amen yeah you want to hear it it's in here but it was new to them who Heard It For the First Time first person who heard it was Mary Mary Joseph's wife the very first person to hear it in Luke chapter 1 so if you think about it it was uh we're talking about down Through the Ages the word like you know Adam and Eve speaking the same language and then the devil perverting that language and adding words that they hadn't heard before so their language is already degrading and then uh when rain comes along judgment comes to the Earth and they have to incorporate that into their language too so negative things start happening to the language and then finally at the Tower of Babel their language is completely destroyed and there's so many languages throughout the world and nobody really knows that Heavenly language that God is speaking to them amen that Heavenly language and then God decides to do something to turn it around right so we're here in the scripture and we get to Luke chapter 1 uh verse 26 it says in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the house House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou thou that art highly favored so right here Mary is I don't know how old she was was probably 12 to 16 years old and she's a virgin now a Virgin uh she could control that right she can control being a virgin and that you know that's great for her virtue that's something she could do for herself but this Angel comes here and starts dropping language on her that she's never thought about before she like Mary is unheard of until this point in scripture right until the beginning of the gospels that's when you first hear her name that's Mary and and he says highly favored so she she has to hear that she heard this word and she's just like huh it's like okay uh no one's ever said that to me before reading on the Lord the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women so highly favored and blessed I've never huh I've never really thought of myself as special but go on kind sir I want to hear what else you have to say it says and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying I would be too and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name Jesus so this time right here is the first time in all the generations of man from the fall of Adam up till now that this name has been spoken why is it important we're about to find out why do we baptize in his name why do we pray in his name why why is this so important that we say that now why is this name translated into more languages on the earth probably than most other words why and nobody had ever said this out loud before he skipped down and he's describing how Jesus is going to be great and called the son of the highest and skipped down to verse 36 says and behold thy cousin Elizabeth sheath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called Baron so people called her Barren but when a Barren person conceives are they still Barren no no no no no she she she she had a something in her in her body got changed because she was told something and she had to accept that for herself and she was told something that had never happened before is that a Barren person suddenly receive life in their womb no no human could have made that happen sure Hannah I think Hannah made that happen with Samuel but she had to receive that word for herself and then that changed her situation because she professed that she was going to have a baby and it says for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the manmade of the Lord so here's the reaction right whenever you hear these words that come from Angels or from the word of God or from the prophet that are spoken over you this is the reaction you need it says be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her he said oh she got it I don't need to stay here anymore he left he like she's saying that herself then that's it it doesn't matter so from that instant right there she may as well have been a mother because she said it and she accepted that word for herself she was a mother that's it and it it's crazy it's that simple he said I said a word over you and you said I accept it and then I and then start confessing it and that's it amen that's it the resurrection of Lazarus 1951 brother brandom's talking about this same exact thing he says in just as she said I think it's verse 59 and just as she said Jesus Little John leaped in the mother's womb began to jump like that received life see she said be it unto me according to thy will but she hadn't actually said the word out loud that the angel gave her and whenever she spoke this word out loud for the very first time to Elizabeth something happened life came into a child life was spoken just by saying that word The First Time The Name of Jesus Christ was ever spoke by mortal lips a dead baby come to life in the womb of a mother brother if it will bring a dead baby to life what ought it to do a Born Again Church Hallelujah that's right no wonder it will make a walk the blind see deaf here the name of Jesus Christ Little John in his mother's womb and Elizabeth said whence cometh the mother of my Lord to me said for as soon as thy salutation came to my ears my baby leaped in my womb for Joy what a baby what a baby hallelujah what a name my baby leaped in my womb for Joy when your salutation came to my ears this name changes everything thing it's not just something you throw around you know some people that's their they use it as a cuss word something scary happens to Jesus like that and that's they they don't know what they're doing they're just saying a noise at that point they're just spouting out nonsense that that doesn't that doesn't mean anything but whenever you take that word because it was given to us as children of man mankind was given this word by Angel and it was passed down through generation through generation and given to us in the scripture and a person in faith taking that word and actually saying it with their lips with faith that can change a situation there's a difference here so right now at this point the very word appeared in the word Jesus has entered the building and when Jesus ENT enters a building stuff starts to change in the Bible I'm going to keep tracking it along it says in uh Matthew 7 it says in in uh verse 28 it says and it came to pass when Jesus had ended these sayings he started preaching to people it says the people were astonished at his Doctrine for he taught them as one having Authority and not as the scribes and the reason he taught them as one having Authority is because he's just speaking what he is he was the living embodiment of the word of God everything that he comes out of his mouth is going to be pure and of course it has Authority now if you if if I'm going around and and you if you go around you've heard my name and somebody says Aaron Mugo Aaron Mugi Mugo that's my full name if if if you go around and start talking to people and asking them about me they'll be like well you know what do I know about him right well I could ask you and you'd be like well he's tall all right I could ask you you say girl voice right I could ask you You' probably say well he's black yes ask you and say he's a male but none of you really knows me and you could ask my wife and she'd know a lot right sister Becca please tell me all about Aaron I'll tell you lots of stuff about him but if you really want to know who has the most Authority about me who are you going to go talk to that's right that was that wasn't a rhetorical question who are you going to go talk to me right so if I come over here and I start telling you about myself would you trust me whenever I tell you I don't like cherry pie I think it's garbage I don't know why people made that now do you know if I'm lying or not you don't know why I just told you I hate cherry pie like that's a fact like you don't have to ask somebody else's opinion cuz it came out of my mouth I don't like cherry pie and I know that might be divisive for some people but it's it's awful thank you brother George I like you like I don't think it's good but if you ask I don't know what that boy's name what's your name Angel awesome I love the name okay so somebody asked Angel what is Aaron like you can't trust him right he might have read up on me but he's never even met me he might have read my birth certificate he might read my password he might read my ID he might know VAR facts but he that's just what he thinks he knows until he actually meets me so Jesus having Authority here there it's not a mystery he's just telling you about himself he says search the scriptures because all of this stuff is just testifying about me here I am and the Pharisees just weren't able to accept that in the Harvest time he says how did they know he wasn't wrong because God Vindicated every word that he promised to him in that age that's the reason they knowed he was the Messiah why just cuz he's talking about himself he has the most Authority about himself not Angel and much as I'm married to Becca she's not the authority on me I'm the authority on me so if you go along Jesus comes and he has his Earthly Ministry and he gets taken up and then he you know he he he he leaves behind he sends the Holy Ghost and they're waiting in there for 10 days uh his disciples at his behest says uh Terry in Jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high and so they're they're waiting and I want to show you something that [Music] happens in Acts chapter 2 verse 5 says and it says and there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and they're confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language and they were all amazed and marveled saying one to another behold are not all these which spake galileans now and it says and how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born so all these people from all parts of the world are joined together and contrary to what was happening back in the Tower of Babel where God confused languages he takes all these languages and brings them together and because the holy spirit is present they all hear it in their personal language it's the same word multiple languages but that effect right there caused them all to realize whoa this is something special because it applies to every person here somehow we all hear them in our own language verse 9 it says parthians and mes and elamites and the Dwellers in Mesopotamia and in Judea in caposa in pontis and Asia friia and pamilia and Egypt and in the parts of Libya about sirene and strangers of Rome Jews and prelit Crees and Arabians we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God and they were all amazed please put the second picture up and they were all amazed and we in doubt saying one to another what mean is this it's Mana what is this it's something new it's never happened before and this is what the diagram looks like of everybody coming right back around from the same places that Babel dispersed them to and said you know what the holy spirit's here and now that the holy spirit's here let's all join up in one language the language of God the language of the word the same it's the same map people like it's not an accident God knows how to do Stu he said there is something special about this that everybody in the world needs to know and I don't care what your background is it's for you I don't care what somebody said about you what I said here is for you and it's going to change you this is the only thing that's going to change you going on to the rap amen and then from this point in the Bible some things start to change so uh you know the Old Testament is where I've read most of this stuff and then the New Testament the words that are used actually if you look at the the the frequency with which uh different words are used in the Bible in the King James version you start to notice a pattern right um I'm guessing no one else did that here but uh I'm going to show you the pattern so um let's do picture number three the word sin in the Old Testament was used 299 times very top of the list Old Testament is longer than the New Testament but it's still used 299 times and then in the New Testament it's only used 90 times why because the word came to the word and when the word came to the word the vocabulary that we needed to apply to Christians is changed the children of Israel sure they had plenty of sin over their lives and there wasn't anything the blood of pools and goats could do to completely do away with it but the New Testament comes and that blood comes actually word number three 280 time 282 times the word blood is used in the Old Testament the New Testament only 93 because they needed blood of bulls goats Lambs Turtle does I don't know how many different animals but then one blood comes and the answer for all that sin is gone the word sacrifice 182 times down to 23 in 23 I can guarantee you most of those is just talking about what they did in the past because there was only one sacrifice needed sir to cover everything people said about you to cover every word that you use to describe yourself it doesn't matter the blood can wash that all the way it can wash all your sin away all the things that you've done that's not your identity it's what God tells you you are the word Arc is the same way 193 times in the Old Testament and six you don't really six in the new you don't you don't need to use that word anymore but then the vocabulary changes and the words that start getting used a lot more often the word faith is only used twice in the Old Testament 39 books way bigger than the New Testament the word faith is used twice and then 229 times in the New Testament like I don't know what the percentage increase there is but that's insane why cuz you need faith faith is for you that's a word you need to use so if there's a word if I have a list here go back up to the Top If I have this list here and there please yeah and these words in the Old Testament are used a lot more I honestly don't need them as much in the New Testament so I don't need to worry about that we don't need to worry about an arc right Noah said get in the ark there's no Arc for me to get into I'm not getting in an arc if somebody tried to tell me right now to get in an ark I'd say I don't I don't get it like why why would I do that that's not going to help me in my spiritual life if somebody told me to tote around an arc of the Covenant I don't need to do that because I'm a new testament Christian right if someone tries to tell me to sacrifice a whole bunch of stuff I don't need those things what I do need is Faith what I do need is Jesus 942 times in the New Testament zero in the Old Testament Christ 532 and zero in the Old Testament Eternal okay I'm Eternal Ed two times in the Old Testament they didn't know anything about that that's right but 45 times in the New Testament predestinated 200% increase you can't divide by zero but that's a 200% increase in my book I'll just call it that predestinated zero times in the Old Testament and two times in the new and when he was talking about me when he said somebody was predestinated he was saying Aaron was predestinated and I'm here to tell you what he said about me I'm here to tell you that he said I was eternal I'm associated with Christ I know Jesus and I have faith why because he said those things about me he said I'm a chosen generation he said I'm a royal priesthood he said I'm complet completely separated from all my sin and all my past nature all those things that you might use to describe my outward appearance that's not what God sees in me there's a lot of faith required to live the word I'm just going to be honest I have a bit of time left a little over 15 minutes and the devil is trying to kill my iPad but we're going to see how far I can preach I don't need the iPad to preach but it's words in the words so I'm trying to read these words out to you so it is what it is right the next word that I'm going to show you is the word redeem because in the Old Testament much as there was a way to cover their blood there was no way to redeem their nature back to the nature of Adam right and here this word comes and I'm not going to tell you it's the first time it was used in the scripture I don't know where the first time was to be honest but in Psalm uh 49 I want to bring out this word in this scripture Psalm chapter 49:5 it says wherefore should I fear in the days of evil when the iniquity of my heel shall Compass me about they that trust in their wealth and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches none of them can by any means his brother nor give God a ransom for him all these people who say things about you can't redeem you what they're saying can't redeem you what God says about you that redeems you amen and I accept what he says in Psalm 49 same chapter verse um uh 15 it says but God will redeem my soul from the power of the Grave for he shall receive me even if no one else does for he shall receive me sayah in hose chapter 13 ver14 it says I will Ransom this is God speaking to to uh about his children he says I will Ransom them from the power of the Grave I will redeem them from death oh death I will be thy plagues oh grave I will be thy destruction repentance shall be hid from mine eyes so death speaking over you trying to follow you through life and say I'm going to get you Jesus took care of death amen the Redemption is complete God is saying you're welcome you are redeemed this word is for you start to speak that I am redeemed you know there I'm how many people here are under uh 30 years old I'm GNA raise my hand because I can only do that for a few more weeks raise your hand higher please yeah all right um I'm going to preach to you for a second right so have you ever heard wait how many people under 30 actually just 35 yeah and higher come on guys you're killing me here okay under 35 all right yeah yeah cool um you know adult like older people you could have raised your hand too cuz you're going to be younger you should be speaking these words now right there you go I like that bro okay so um for the people who are actually physically under 35 have you ever seen a Marvel movie Just raise your hand if you have I have I'm going to be honest okay yeah have you read a read a comic book yes yeah is yeah yeah okay so what's popular right towards the end of that they get into the Multiverse don't they right please raise your hands I nobody's vocal here you know what the Multiverse is yeah and whenever they talk about the Multiverse they're like o this is crazy thing you've known Spider-Man this whole time you've known Batman this whole time but whoa there's a Batman from Another Universe all the way over there right and you never knew but he meets this Batman and they're not friends they fight each other or something like that they just come up with some new story and they're trying to make it I'm just here to tell you right God did the Multiverse first in the scripture y'all y'all don't look like you believe me then tell me who Jesus was praying to when he was in the garden he's here who who is he praying to when Jesus has the Holy Spirit and receives it in the form of a dove when he gets baptized who's the Holy Spirit and who's Jesus it's the same person yes different forms but they're not visible in the same exact spot right same person right you guys are multiversal creatures adults I'm going to catch up with you God give me a minute just give me a minute you guys are multiversal creatures why because God said that you have a theophany and you might be walking on this Earth and your theophany is up there and if you got to think people try to tell you things about yourself like you're sick you're not going to amount to much you your your body is weak you're falling apart you're imperfect you're not quite there from what I think a message believer should look like so therefore you're all messed up I can't take you at all think about that God he's not looking at you he's looking at your theophonic he's not sick that theophany she's not sick that theophany she she's perfect God loves her God loves him that's what God sees me as right now and you can accept that by faith and walk into it in you're traveling the Multiverse and then you accept your healing for yourself if my theophan is not sick then I'm not sick if my theophan is not broken and battered and bruised then I'm not broken battered and bruised if my theophany is not perfect well if my theophany is perfect that means I'm perfect whatever attribute it has is for me amen right all right everybody else I'm catching up um let's go back to these words now back to everybody the word predestinated like I said it only appeared uh twice in the scripture in the New Testament in Ephesians 5 uh 1: 15 rather says having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will also in verse 11 it says in whom we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that's what God says about us and who is this melkisedek 1965 verse 1116 brother brandom says God vindicates that that's always been right God vindicates it to be true show plainly the predestinated is the only one that's considered in Redemption so if you can accept predestination for yourself if sorry if you can accept Redemption for yourself then you can accept predestination for yourself it says the predestinated is the only one that's considered in Redemption did you get it let me say that again the predestinate is the only one that's considered in Redemption people might be taking making like think they are but the real Redemption is those that are predestinated because the very word redeem means to bring back is that right the redeem is something to redeem anything is bring it back to the original Place Hallelujah so it's only the predestinated will be brought back because the others didn't come from there that's so he's defining both words right there and there interchangeable at this point right now I'm going to segue into this and it says there's a section here I I want to go into watching what you say right and that's what I've been talking about this whole time because what you say determines what you become what you say determines your purpose that's what I've been driving home this whole time in Hebrews chapter 2 but brandom says um in verse four he says if you can't decide don't say nothing just leave it alone wait you know what I'm gonna back it up the beginning of the verse it says if you witness to anything you're just as guilty as being a partaker of it so if we witness say oh yes they ought to have done this and so and so be careful what you say because you're guilty the way your judgment goes if you can't decide don't say nothing just leave it alone and when you testify you are a Christian then you're guilty see you're guilty of being a Christian that you must live to that and when God makes a promise in the Bible I see a man here in a wheelchair when God makes a promise he is guilty of that promise until he brings it to pass so God is guilty when he makes a promise and the scriptures are guilty until they're fulfilled so you're guilty with what you say as an amateure Creator you're guilty with what you say until it becomes fulfilled take the word in faith recognize that your words have consequences don't have a negative testimony Saints amen in Isaiah 55 uh verse 10 it says for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but WTH the Earth and maketh it bring forth in Bud that it may give seed to the swer and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return to me void but it shall be accom accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper on the thing wherein to I sent it we got to get that mindset [Music] amen and I realize this isn't me trying to say you walk out of here and name it and claim it but your faith produces a testimony and your testimony changes your situation now um God has to honor your faith because he said he would if you go to um actually I'm gonna prove that to you right here if you go to Matthew um 21:20 it says when this is right after Jesus saw the the Fig Tree and he cursed it what does he tell them the disciples Marvel and in verse 21 he says Jesus answered and said unto them verily I say unto you if you have faith and doubt not ye shall not only do this which was done to the Fig Tree but also if ye shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done can you realize he's not saying if I tell you if if I say he's saying if you say why why because you know God on this Earth only has your hands to work through he has your lips to work through at the moment and if he's working through you then he's realizing he's giving you that power on your lips through the word of God if you have faith on it then you have unlimited power and with that unlimited power you can do these things that he says you can do why am creators that's what we are if you go back to Genesis I'm going to do it again Genesis one more time verse uh chapter 2: 19 it says and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them did y'all catch that he didn't bring them to Adam and tell him what to call them he said to see what he would call them why because Adam was the one who was supposed to name these things because Adam was in the will of God and he had the mind of God and the mind of God revealed it to his heart what God would want him to say and then he's speaking that the verse next verse says and Adam gave names to all Catt to the F of the air Adam gave them names God didn't name them so Adam was using words in the Garden of Eden that God revealed to his heart to say so whenever he started saying stuff like naked he knew something was wrong and that's where he fell you got to watch what you say Saints in hearing recognizing and acting on the word of God actually yes uh no no no let me let me leave that quote alone I'm going to do God hiding himself in Simplicity musicians can return please um 1963 if we'd all stand actually while I read this because this is a declaration um we can make over ourselves God hiding himself in Simplicity it says he he's praying at the end of this uh tape and he says Lord Jesus in the way of humility in the way of humbleness I offer you this congregation that's on their feet I offer them to you because they have stood in response to the call they're seeking deeper things they're seeking more life after hearing that the blood of Jesus so thoroughly cleanses that there's no more nothing that the complete word of God rests within them that the very command of their own voice is creative power because in them is the Holy Ghost and this Holy Ghost is a Creator he makes things come to pass because he speaks the word and the word spoken becomes God In Action the word spoken right not not random words that you came up with over yourself and I realized there I'm I'm battling Spirits here um there are depressive spirits that make you think you're nothing right there are you know the devil does the same thing he he's just constantly going to try to give you words to say you can play whatever you like he's going to say give you words to say you see that happening like you go out in the world you see people out there it's like oh I you know a full grown man with you know supposed to be in good mind and sound mind and everything he says I'm a woman why cuz the word g the devil gave him some words to speak and he starts trying to apply that to himself and when he does that what happens he starts changing the words that apply to himself it's like my pronouns are she her changing words that are applied to himself because they're trying to pervert and make people around them try to prophesy over their life and say bad things that aren't true that's not what they are that's not a man that's not a woman you might be battling with a spirit yourself and be like oh well I just I don't know I'm just anxious I have anxiety I can't I can't get rid of it I can't kick it stop professing that over yourself that's what somebody told you about yourself and then these words become popular you know they become Trends it's like oh I have OCD then suddenly everybody on Instagram has OCD you know and it's just like y all don't all have OCD stop saying that a lot of them don't even know what OCD stands for It's like because they don't know what they stand for we should stand for this right God didn't say I CD and yes you might recognize some symptoms attacking you but that's just something the devil's trying to tell you you might recognize that you're broken and you know what that's okay to be broken but God's A Healer and if I can accept that he has healed me and is going to heal me and he's this isn't my permanent State that's that's not my testimony I'm not going to say it out loud maybe it's true as far as you can see but it's not true as far as what he can see and I can recognize that let's bow our heads and recognize God he's not trying to leave us where we are like if this word came like on the day of Pentecost and it came to so many people throughout the world and you go to church and you see these Christians around you and they look like they're living great lives they're Victorious all the time looking good healthy happy faithful realize that if God sent a word to me in this day in this age and I can see a strong Christian right there that's for me too there's no reason why he would send a word for them that doesn't apply to me that's for me too I accept it for me if God sent the word for this age then it applies to everybody in this age it doesn't matter your Creed tribe color it doesn't matter your history it doesn't matter how broken you are in fact the more broken the better it just shows his will and his power more greatly amen Heavenly Father we thank you for uh anointing us this evening and for you breaking the Word of Life to

just need to have faith and testify of what you've done in our lives there are blind people who were blind but as long as they testified that you had healed them Lord you took away their blindness maybe the rest of the world didn't understand the sequence of events they they might say oh he's a liar he said he was he said he's been healed or she's that sister said she she said she's not a but she's on using a cane right now like she's lying no she's she's standing on your word Lord your word called us healed your word called us perfect Lord these words I brought out tonight Lord let us run
