So good to be in the house of the Lord with you. Praise the Lord to each of you. God bless you richly. Good to see you, Sister Becken, the kids, and each of you. We're going to listen to the portion of the message, the countdown. And brother Brandon will be starting in the scripture, if you'd like to turn there in Hebrews chapter 11. Let's take from paragraph number two through paragraph the number I gave them, 96. About 40 minutes or so, 45 minutes. and then we'll go to the Lord in prayer. It's a powerful tape. Brother Randon preached this message three times. Twice in 1962 and then this is the last time he ministered it in 1964 in Bakersfield and totally comparing the um scientific achievements to our daytoday. Just a tremendous tremendous uh message that he brings to us. So trust you're looking forward to that. Amen. Amen. Let's sing. Only believe. Only believe. Only believe that all things are possible. Only believe. Only believe. Ally believe. &gt;&gt; All things are possible. [Music] Only. Can we say Lord I believe with all your heart? Oh Lord I believe. Lord, I believe that all things are possible. Lord, I believe. Oh Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. Hallelujah. All things are possible. Lord, I believe and may remain standing, brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; But now we're standing in respects of the word while I read a portion of scripture here and ask God for a context for my text. We are turning to Hebrews 11th chapter. if you'd like to follow as we read. Now faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report. Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God. So that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. Let's pray. Lord, bless your word. Sanctify the instrument that it shall be used for. And may the instrumentality be to go together with the word to bring forth life and make this word live again before us. We ask that in Jesus name. Amen. And be seated. Just give me your undivided attention just for a few moments about 20 minutes. I have a little text here. I'd like to call it countdown. You know all the things. Did you hear what the scripture said? The things that are we see were made of things that was not because it was the word of God who spoke things into existence. The world that we are sitting upon today, the chairs that we're sitting in, the floor that's beneath us, the dirt, the trees, everything is nothing but the interpretation of the word of God. When God interprets it, when it happens, that reveals it. Let there be and there was. Let there be and there was. And to see nature, how it is formed. Now, nature has been my Bible. As everyone knows who I've been in my audience when I spoke, I'm really almost on the illiterate side and just barely read. I had a seventh grade education. I had a lot of experience. But in my preaching, I have to take my inspiration and hype it with something in the in nature so that you can understand what I'm talking about. I can't use words like a smart educated man does because I haven't the education to do it with. So therefore, I pick up nature and type what my inspiration is telling me with nature. I felt awful lonesome for that. But one time I read in the Bibles where the prophets of the Old Testament did that. And then the greatest of the prophets was John. And we noticed when he was 9 years old, he was carried into the wilderness by the spirit because he had to introduce the Messiah. His father was a priest. It was ordinary. That is he would follow the trend of his father. But his job was too important to take some ethics of what somebody else thought. He had to get his message from God. So at the age of 30, he came out of the wilderness uneducated but with a burning zeal in his heart with a revelation from God and a vision that he was going to announce the Messiah. He knew it so plainly until he said, "There's one standing among you right now that you don't know." &gt;&gt; Think of that. One standing among you right here that you don't know. He his shoes I'm not worthy to unloose, but he will baptize with the Holy Ghost and fire. His hand is in his hand. And did you notice his his manner of speech? Now he said to the Pharisees when he come out, he knew being a prophet, he knowed what was in their heart. And he said, "You generation of vipers," meaning snakes. See, they he knew that that now some other man might have said, "You something else, you know, you some a good high grammar. You uh insignificant piece of inconvenience or whatever you might have wanted to call it. That might be wrong. I just picked that up." See, u so it might have been some other words that he could have used. But you see his inspiration, he knowed that a snake was little and low down and sneaking. So he said, "You generation of snakes who's warned you to flee from the wrath that to come, don't begin to say within yourselves that we belong to this or that. For I say unto you that God's able of these rocks, stones, what he'd seen in the wilderness and on the bank to raise up children unto Abraham." Also, the axe is laid at the root of the tree, what he'd seen. Every tree like in the wilderness, it didn't bring forth fruit. That's what he used for firewood. See, it laid at the root of the tree. And if you don't bring forth good fruit, he shoeed down and cast into the fire. See, his inspiration followed nature. And if you watch nature real close, you won't get too far from the word because God is in nature. I think last time I was down on the West Coast, I preached on the four ways of seeing God. God in his son, God in his word, God in nature, and so forth. Now if we notice everything that God made in nature being able to speak that way on natural things typing spiritual things it because it was made of things which does not appear it was the word. Now we take for instance like yeah a few months ago I was asked to preach a sermon a funeral sermon for a dear old friend of mine. Many ever read my book and you remember where I a boy that was a one belonged to some of the boy scouts or something and he I asked him to save him my save me his old cow uh or scout suit when he wore it out well he saved me one leg and you remember it in the book and I put it on Lloyd Ford his mother died recently about 85 years old very precious friend of mine and Lloyd being single yet and stayed with his mother he came to me and he said brother Bill that's how he knew me we I call him Lloyd He called me Bill. And I said, "Uh, what do you want, Brother Lloyd?" He said, "Will you uh will you preach Mother's funeral?" I said, "I'd be glad to do it. It'd be like my own mother." Oh, I said, "She's cooked me so many meals and things and been so sweet to me." He said, "I want you to say those last words over Brother Brandham." I said, "What would you what would you want me to say, Lloyd?" He said, "One thing I want you to do just assure my people. Assure us of her resurrection." So I took the text from something over in Job uh of how that Job was watching nature and I said in my death of my own mother, my own mother that just died about two years ago, my young sister had just been saved a little while and she called me up when she knew mother was going and she said, "Uh, Bill, what can I do?" Said, "I just can't stand it no longer standing there looking upon my mother." I said, "It's the sweetest sight I ever seen." She said, "How can you say that in your mother?" Why? I said, "She's ready to go and wanting to go. She's old and she's ready to pass in this life." I said to her, "Mother, does Jesus still mean to you what they did the day you got the Holy Ghost?" She'd say, "Yes." When and I when she couldn't do it no more. I said, "Smile." When she got slow, she couldn't smile or speak. I said, "Mother, you're dying. She's in my arm." And I said, "Mother, if Jesus Christ still means the same to you? And is this sweeter, even sweeter than he was when you received the Holy Ghost? I'm your preacher son. I've got to meet the public. Does Jesus mean something to you while you're dying? If it does, if you can't speak," she couldn't speak. I said, "Can't you speak, mother?" She couldn't move. I said, "Bat your eyes real fast." And she started batting her eyes real fast. No. Water running down her cheeks when she couldn't even speak no more. But her senses in her sense the presence of Jesus Christ. In a few minutes, a wind comes sweeping through the room and mother went out with it to meet God. Now, this woman when she died, I said, "Is there hopes in the resurrection?" I said, "Everything I've been privileged is speaking practically to every nation under the heavens. I've seen all kinds of gods and all kinds of religions, but there's none of it true. But Christianity, it's the only one. Even nature itself, it speaks for Christianity. God the creator. Look, there is life, death, burial, resurrection, resurrection. The you can't go outside without seeing it. Watch the leaves come on in the spring. Watch them get to their youth in their old in their middle age and then their old age and the veins and the leaves packing the life. Few minutes you find out it isn't long before any frost falls or anything. Them leaves drop off and what happens? The life that's in that tree, that sap goes down into the roots. If it didn't, the winter cold would kill the tree, kill the life. It can't stay up. It's got to go down and bury itself. But in the spring of year, here it comes back with a new leaf again. It's testifying there is a life, a death, a burial, a resurrection. Everything tightened. We just can't get from it. Watch the sun when it's rises of a morning. The sun that lights the skies. It's a little baby rocked in its mother's arms. when it's weak, not very much light, not very strong. Then about 8:00 it starts off to school. At 11:30, she's graduated and it's out of high school, out of college. Then she's in her strength from about 12 till about 2. Then she begins to get weak, weaker, weaker, weaker, and finally she gets real weak like an old man or woman. Goes down. Is that the end of it? She comes back the next morning. You'll testify there is a resurrection and a life beyond death. Everything testifying. All nature testifies. The word testifies to it. The very spirit itself, it's in our heart testifies to it. Something within us calling out that there is a resurrection of the dead. So you see to say if everything serves God's purpose, it's got a resurrection. But it can only rise if it serves God's purpose. If a flower lives and is not germatized, it will not rise again. If you plant corn and it is not geratized, it will not rise again. Anything that doesn't serve God's purpose has no resurrection. But you can't keep anything in the ground that serves God's purpose. It comes forth again to testify of the resurrection. We know that all these things are right. There are testimonies to us to encourage us each day. Everywhere you look, you see God. There is a natural body of people. There is a spiritual body of people. There is a natural bride. I've had the privilege of marrying fine young couples. I never think of it unless I uh kind of turn them around little superstitions and I face with my back to the east and them looking to the east. And as I look at them, I think of their hearts beating as one Christ and his bride. There is a natural bride. And then there is a natural bride. It's only a testimony. There is a spiritual bride. There is a spiritual bride because there is a natural bride. All these natural happenings now they forerrun spiritual happenings. Each happening accompanies the other happening only it improves it. You say what's like that? Well something like a spiritual life when it comes into the natural life it improves the natural life. It it makes you in a better condition than you was in the natural life. When the leaf is getting old and dies, when it comes back with the life again in the resurrection to testify in another year, it comes back in a better condition than it did when it went down. See, everything testifies of these things. Now, let's take for instance the achievement that man has been uh able to do on earth and all of these natural achievements. Now if I want your undivided attention now the all the natural achievements uh happened in the earth has been forerunners of spiritual achievements that God has done by his church. All the natural things are type of the spiritual things. Now you say how is that? Let's take for one transportation. First the transportation was by horse. The next it was by automobile. Then science build us an airplane and but you see it is uh first was one horsepower. The car was maybe 20 horsepower. The airplane goes up to hundreds of horsepower. See what it is? It's just as we come on with the horse. Then an automobile was made. Then the next thing was an airplane. We just keep achieving on higher and higher going greater and greater. This is the achievement of science. This is a forerunner of the spiritual things that's happened of God by his spirit has been in his promised word. The natural man by the knowledge looks backward for his achievement. That's science. &gt;&gt; See to what God has done in a former creation. They go out and pick up clouds and get pieces of rocks and fossils and and elements and ties them together. See on that achievement they are taking what God has done and perverting it from its original estate and making his living quarters and so forth and his economy a little better by what has been created. That's in the natural achievement by man. But God in the spiritual achievement is going forward not going backward. He's going forward looking into the word and believing the promises for things that never has from you &gt;&gt; for the spiritual revelations to manifest the spiritual things that God has promised. He sees them come to pass. Just as the scientists in his laboratory are working on different things to help man take in creation, the spiritual man is looking forward to something that God promised that has never yet been created. The natural man looks backward. The spiritual man looks forward. That's the way they got got that in the church. The natural church member looks back to what Penny Sanki Knox Calvin that was all right. But that was their day. We're looking forward for something else. A promise is greater than higher and what God has promised. &gt;&gt; Science goes back to pick it up. We go forward in the word of the Lord to find what God has achieved in these two things. one four runs the other or types it. Now as science has been able to achieve more horsepower as he did by taking the power and making greater instruments autotos and aeroplanes. God has achieved from the same manner as each one of those type. Now watch. Way back in the days of Luther, their power was horsepower. And then God by getting Luther in his hands, controlled out of a great organization or a system, he let the man see that the just shall live by faith. &gt;&gt; And when he was able to achieve justification and preach it, the church come to life. Amen. &gt;&gt; It come to life and it begin to move just a little bit back under the days of the horsepowers when horsepower was about ready to fade out of the carriage and horse and buggy. Now he achieved justification and through that then the church received life by believing on Jesus Christ. Not taking some say I believe the church I believe this to believe him is life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Justified by faith. Luther preached it. That was tight by the horse and buggy days. Then he got a man in England by the name of John Wesley under his control to take out all the isms away from him. And he was able by John Wesley to bring into the church sanctification. Sanctification raised a church to its feet and got it able to walk. Now at the end of Wesley's age was the automobile. We realize that when the end of the Wesley church, I mean not see ever ever a reformer comes at the end of the age. Now we find out that Wesley and last of his church age, it come just before the Pentecostals. Well, we see that the church got strengthened through sanctification to walk away from the things of the world. Sanctify means separate for the glory of God. It too bad it lost that. But it uh got strength enough. Luther give it life back in the horse and buggy day. Wesie got it on its feet to walk and sanctification separating from the things of the world. Through that come the little branches off like the pilgrim holiness and Nazarines and whatever more come from that through sanctification. But remember they couldn't stay still. The pillar of fire moved out and they come to Isusa street here in California. And then what did it do? It represented the airplane days from the automobile when the God was able by the Wright brothers to or the man was to achieve an airplane that could fly immediately for running that the Zeusa street Pentecost fell and man tucked to the air into the supernatural to the unknown. He spoke with unknown tongues. He done unknown things that was foreign to the church because he had tucked off of the ground. He left the air into the air. What did it immediately after the airplanes come on? He took to the air. God showed by the airplanes that his church was arising. He shows by the natural things what's happening in the spiritual. They always follow just like the wise man following the star to find Christ after following for two years. Now notice all those things are achievements that man has achieved only are types and shadows of what God is doing. He always does it that way. He's told us the signs that would be in the skies, the things that would be happening just before the coming of Christ. We see that now. It's only a pointing post. And we see signs how they have achieved and how God has achieved by his church. Does a man ride in an airplane? He don't want no horse and buggy no more unless he just want a little fun. But the horse and buggy, remember what is the power in the airplane? Just more horses added, that's all. And so when John Wesley found sanctification a set aside work from justification, he never condemned justification. He only added more power to it. &gt;&gt; And when the Pentecostals found the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the restoration of the gifts, they never denied sanctification or justification. They just got more power and raised up. &gt;&gt; Praise God. He went up because he found more power. See all those things foreshadowing as they come up. If we had time, we could really stay on that, but we haven't. But he raised up as science achieved something looking backward. God chieves going this way, going forward to the kingdom. Now we find from Isusa street the plains took off in great revivals and swept the world to the unknown in the heavenly places speaking unknown tongues with unknown gifts to the world. Why? They thought they were fanatics, but they had been able. God got a group of people in his hands. You got a little crosseyed negro man down here in Isusa Street that had no more sense than to believe what God said was the truth. &gt;&gt; See, when a science has got to get a lot of sense in a man's head of wisdom, of knowledge to go back and find these things, God's got to get what he's got in him out of him so he can use him. Amen. &gt;&gt; One going this way and one going that way. &gt;&gt; One's going down, the other's going up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, she left these intellectual churches grounded. When the Pentecostal took off with speaking in tongues and great gifts of healing, they healed the sick. They've done great things. They've done it. There's no doubt what they've done it. It's a proof that they done it. &gt;&gt; Sure did. And they left this intellectual church sitting on the ground. No matter. They say, "Oh, you can't go." They did it anyhow. Whether you like the little boy in jail for shooting a gumbo, somebody come in said, "The little boy come into this." He said, "Oh, they can't put you in jail for that." He said, "They can't. He is already there." And that's why they say that the Holy Ghost was for another age. That's what they think. It's here. We know it. We It It's We've been flying in the air for the last 40, 50 years with it. Seeing things that the intellectual people knows nothing about. Only thing they can do is sit down and say just make fun of it. Like a little calf one time come out of a stall. They said it was just fat and round. He's kicking up his heels and he had a very fine farmer fed him good and he's all round and full of vitamins. And there's another old lazy farmer over there that had a little calf also born in the barn that winter when a little fell hadn't eaten nothing but weeds. And when he come out he was so poor he couldn't hardly move. And every time the wind would blow shove him sideways. He seen this little fat cat just kicking up his heels and having a great time. You know, he looked to the crack of the pants and said, "Such fanaticism." He was all full of vitamin. No wonder he could kick up his heels. And when a man is filled with the Holy Ghost, there's something in him. It's full of God's spiritual vitamin. Makes him praise God. Shout. And that given because why? He's no longer earthbound. He's in the heavens sailing around in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. He left them earthbound with their bicycles and automobiles and they went to the air. Yes, they're practically taking them out of they're out of date. They healed the sick. They spoke in unknown languages and done many things. &gt;&gt; But now friends, may I say this? It has come to the age of astronaut. &gt;&gt; We've moved out of the airplane age. We got more power. Now the astronaut age has come in. What is it? Not a we come in to a spiritual age of astronaut. See going above. It's not it's the same spirit only more power. Only lift it and higher can go higher, see more, bleed more, be more like Christ. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Not the automobile, not the horse and buggy, not even the airplane, but the astronaut. &gt;&gt; He sweeps on and above each one. It's called the eagle age in the Bible. God calls his prophets eagle age. We realize over in the Bible, we find in Malachi 4 that we're promised that in the last days. Now, he likes his prophets to eagles. He calls himself eagle. He's the great Jehovah eagle. He's able to achieve to himself a bride. He's going to in the last days be able to get a bride that with a ministry that's so exactly the like a man and his wife becomes one. And when Jehovah gets his people like him, then he lives in his people. They are one. It fulfills the scripture. Exactly what he said in St. John 14:12. He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he also. It also fulfill what Jesus said would take place. As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the coming of the son of man. Now is the astronaut age. And the astronaut sees things that the horse rider automobile or airplanes either sees. &gt;&gt; He goes high. &gt;&gt; Airplanes still down here bouncing around in the clouds and having blowouts and hip downs and everything else, but he goes beyond the clouds of creeds and denominations. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Moves on up into the heavens. &gt;&gt; I'm away from everything. the astronaut age. We are living in the astronaut age. Just as sure as God has testified of the natural happenings there, so is he testifying now that if we've achieved an astronaut, God has achieved what he promised to achieve in the last days according to Malachi 4. Only thing he has to do is get somebody in his hands &gt;&gt; that can cut loose from the airplanes and automobiles and what more. Not look back to what it was, but more power to lift him higher. lift him into the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Lift him up there where all things are possible. Now we see it's happening. There's no doubt to it. So does a spiritual astronaut. As a the natural astronaut goes on above the planes. The planes always wrecking up and fussing in the clouds and everything like that. There can be nothing greater, no more achievement than the astronaut. Only thing he has to do is keep putting more power. He'll go anywhere he wants to. See, because he's done gone into space, airplanes are still down, wrecking, pussing, grounded, and everything like that. But the astronaut don't have to be grounded. He goes on above the clouds. He goes on above, on above the creed, on above the denomination, on above those say it is and so it isn't. So he's got a guide. The Holy Spirit, the word tells him so. And he moves on. &gt;&gt; How does the science make an astronaut? He takes what power they got. Just keep breaking something into it. It'll make it go farther, go without air and so forth. He keeps I don't know the the chemicals of it. I'm not a mechanic. But whatever it is, he keeps making it go higher and higher. He keeps improving at all times. And now he can go beyond any reason. So does God's astronaut. &gt;&gt; Goes beyond all church creed, all boundaries, all these things. Says the days of miracles has passed. There is no such a thing. How did the astronaut find this? He figured it out on paper. It come off of paper what he figured out. the same thing that any man can sit down and read the word of God and see what's promised. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life said Jesus and they testify of me. &gt;&gt; That earthbound bunch they had back there in them days didn't know what he was &gt;&gt; ministry what does it the astronaut sees things that the planes and everything's out of date. So does a spiritual astronaut goes beyond the clouds and beyond creeds and beyond doubt out into outer space. Outer space of all unbelief. &gt;&gt; Outer space where he don't hear the chatter saying, "Well, you can't do it. The whole body cooperate cooperate with you. You can't do this. You can't do that." He doesn't notice it. He's an astronaut. He goes on beyond those clouds. &gt;&gt; It's too stormy. We can't make it. It don't make any difference to an astronaut. He goes beyond the storm. That's the way it is to a real astronaut faith today. They say, "Well, the doctor said so and so that might be all right, but an astronaut don't believe that." When his wrote here and he's got it in his heart, something tells him, he just propels right on out. It's all goes right on out into the space because we're living in an astronaut age. Yes, sir. Out in space where all things are possible to them that believe. He has a guide which is his word that tells him how to go. The word of God natural astronaut is has uh something to control him. When the astronaut is in the air, he has something backwards here back down here on the earth that controls him. It's called radar. That radar moves him around, tells where he's at, tells what he's doing, and that radar controls him from a radar tower here on Earth. That's the natural astronaut. So the spiritual astronaut has a control power, has a control tower, too. It's not down here like man is. It's up there. And it's the Holy Ghost that's in him that's controlling him. A power of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. It's under control. Keeps him in control by the word. Not in a bunch of fanaticism, some hooped up nonsense, but thus sayaeth the Lord. And it happens. It's always under control. He's got a control tower. That's the Holy Ghost and the word is his his program and he lays right into that program and the power of the Holy Ghost endows him to move out and it brings the achievement that God wants to be achieved for his people that it might fulfill what he promised. Jesus did not heal the people because he had to do it. He fully fulfilled the scripture. He healed because it was written he would do it. He don't have to show these signs today. He don't have to have a ministry of such and such, but he promised he'd do it. &gt;&gt; He does it to fulfill his promise. &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, man, women, can't you see that? Can't you see the type of the spiritual and the natural? These great achievements has brought the time clock of science and it broke into such a place until they say now it's only on the clock of science. They say it's three minutes till midnight. They're at the end. &gt;&gt; They found the thing that will destroy him. &gt;&gt; They found everything an astronaut can get in the air and go over with atomic powers to set up there and say, "Surrender or be blown up." Three minutes until midnight, they have worked on what God has done. They've been able to pervert. Instead of trying to make life, they're always trying to find something to kill somebody. Something out do the next thing, beat the next nation, beat the next place. That's what they're trying to do. But man looks on calling man his brother and trying to lead him to a home where he won't have to die. &gt;&gt; One is in death, the other is in life. But these in death only represent life. The leaf when he falls off a tree and dies only mean it's coming back again &gt;&gt; because it has been. &gt;&gt; The clock ticks up on the achievement of science today to 3 minutes to midnight. On God's great clock, it ticks Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. We have arrived. The works that I do shall you also. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. When the scientific clock says three minutes to destruction, God's clock says Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. He's on the earth in the power of the Holy Ghost to make his word live and do for his church just exactly what he promised it would do. &gt;&gt; Filling his astronauts, getting them all fueled up and ready. So, they got in their great big scientific tube here not long ago, astronaut tube, and are taking the countdown now headed for the moon. They're getting off of here, too. They got a astronaut in a big tube powered by atomic power that they can send it plum to the moon. They claim they got in their tube and are waiting for the countdown. the spiritual astronaut, God in Christ, and is listening to the countdown of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you Lutheran order shout, "You Baptist and Presbyterian, watch the countdown of the word." &gt;&gt; Oh my. Countdown of the word. And they're headed for heaven, &gt;&gt; not to the moon. They'll pass the moon so fast they won't even see it. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Waiting for the countdown. Yes, sir. Waiting for the countdown is right. What are they doing? They're wrapped in Christ in rapturing grace. &gt;&gt; Nothing they did themselves. Christ took the uneducated, the foolish things of the world, wrapped his astronauts in it, and empowered them with the Holy Ghost to take off. &gt;&gt; This world's going to be left alone. That's right. Taking off. Notice the natural man even counts backwards. I said he did things backwards. He counts backwards. Watch his count. 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 zero. &gt;&gt; See, he goes back and starts counting. See, he's all up. 10's a bad number. That's right. To start with 10, it's a bad number. They had 10 tribes of Israel. And that was all carnal. And he had to take Joseph's two son, Ephraim and Manasses, the prophet's children, and bless them. And when he did, his hands crossed. And he said, "Father, not so. You put your hands on Ephraim. should be on Manasses. He said, "God, cross my hands from the taking it from the older son, the law, and putting it up over on Christ." And through that, come through the cross came the change of the birthright. &gt;&gt; Amen. To the younger son. Oh my, how wonderful. We had time to go into that will some other time. All right. Now, 10 is a bad number, but man always counts backwards. Starts at 10. 10 98765 443 2 1 zero. What does God do? He starts with his number seven. That's God's number. &gt;&gt; Watch him. Seven. Oh, he counts ahead starting with one. He starts with his first church age. That's what his symbols was on earth. The seven church ages. He made the world in seven days. Seventh day he rested. That's his last number. And his creation he rested. Notice he counts straight ahead, not backwards. He goes forward. He starts from his first church age which began in 8033. And he started the countdown. He counted his church ages. That was the birth of the church on the day of Pentecost. What did he start counting? He started counting the church ages. First one was Ephesus. Number one, two, Samaria. Three, Pergus. Four, Thirara. Five, Sardis. Six, Philadelphia. Seven, Leosia. It's later than you think. &gt;&gt; It's later than you think. The counting's over. &gt;&gt; The next thing is zero. &gt;&gt; Let's go. Everything's ready. The count's over. &gt;&gt; When John Glennise, &gt;&gt; our astronaut, got into that big tube to take off, the nation stood speechless. They didn't know that morning that he took off. When he did, he got in the tube and everybody was crying and waiting and watching what was going to happen. The nation stood spellbound. You seen the all the televisions blaring and everything so everybody could sit. Their natural eye couldn't see it. But of course, they put it on television. You remember it. Then when he got spaced up in the tube just right, and when he did, they started 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 zero. Off he went. What happened when the big lever pull? The atomics begin to catch fire, begin to break, fire begin to fly, smoke be to roll, and the great big tube took off for the air into the unknown out under somewhere. He took off in the man's achievement. the greatest he's ever had. But let me tell you, that's just a very small thing. One of these mornings, God's achievement of his astronauts that's climbed into Jesus Christ, been born in there by the Holy Ghost, filled with his power. One of these mornings, the whole universe will be screaming and wailing and nashing of teeth when they see they missed it. When the great eagle powered by the Holy Ghost and fire begins to spread her wings, &gt;&gt; the astronauts will take off into the sky. You're going to meet the bridegroom. When the bride takes off in the astronaut power of God Almighty, who sent Jesus Christ to the earth in the form of the Holy Ghost has brought the church through these achievements until now she's getting resurrected powering her the power beyond the things of the world. Seeing him out here in the church making himself the same yesterday, today, and forever. Yes, sir. The countdown's even over. Ever. Church age is done past. We're ending on the Lady Oia. Get in, my brother, sister. Get pressurized. The pressure won't hurt you. Uh when you get on the inside and get pressurized. Get in Christ. You don't care what the world says. They can't never hit you anyhow. You're safe. You're tucked in. Jesus Christ is our great glorious astronaut tube that we'll be in. that'll be propelled by the Holy Ghost and power and fire when she begins to fly. One of these mornings, the Holy Ghost fire hit the earth like that. When it do, the church will be lifted up and all the nations will stand. They won't need television. They'll see him. Every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess as she propels her way in her into the glorious rims of of heaven to be married to her bridegroom. God, help us to live for that day. Let us bow our heads. Are you driving a horse and buggy today? Are you riding a bicycle? Are you a automobile? Or have you got up into the clouds with a plane? If you have, I've got something to tell you. There's an astronaut age on now. &gt;&gt; Why don't you come get into that astronaut? &gt;&gt; Oh, I know it sounds scary. The first man ever got in an airplane like scared to death. First one had an automobile. You know what? Done. But now it's a common thing. Oh, brother, sister. Jesus Christ is here. The great astronaut tube that we're to be in. Cloud over us won't mean one thing. He'll break every cloud of doubt, every thing of unbelief and sweep out into the space. If you haven't got into him yet, you have an opportunity this afternoon. Would you raise your hands and say, "Pray for me, Brother Brandham, that I can walk into that place where I can see every word that God promised. I can see and feel a pulsating power of God within me. That I know that my this world and things is gone from me." God bless. Just look at the hands. My oh my. All everywhere. Our heavenly father, you see their hands. I'm only responsible for preaching the word. You, they are yours. I give them to you. They are yours. Let the Holy Spirit down and may they see that these achievements they see it in the natural. Then if we look back we see it in the spiritual. You're here you promised just before the end time come that as it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah and we had look back and see those days. Look there and see where two ministers outstanding angelic anointed man went down in Sodom and preached in the days of Abraham calling out Lot. Then there was one stayed with Abraham and that was the one who done a sign to Abraham. The others and Sodom did their sign. And father, so many things could be said right here. Maybe the church wouldn't understand, but I pray that you'll give them such a crave for it, Lord, that they'll come and see we're at the end time, the astronaut age. I pray, Father, that they'll realize it isn't trying to condemn what they have. It's only trying to give them more rapturing grace. For the hour will come when we'll have to have rapture power. Not only to heal the body, but to change it in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye. Christ will be so real into their bodies so he can change it by his great death and what he purchased. May they take this today, that token that I spoke of last night, hold it before them and walk into this astronaut. Granted, Father, where visions, powers, and worlds beyond known, and oh God, where all the great mysteries of God is unfolded in those seven seals and made known to man, granted, Father, they're yours. Now, I realize that alter calls is what we do, but Lord, you said as many as believed, I pray that you'll give them faith to believe. They're in your hands, Lord. And if I never see and they never see me no more until we meet at your side, we'll know them as we are known. I pray that you'll help them. And may we all be there safely carried through by amazing grace of our great astronaut faith that we have in Jesus Christ where we're in house with him. Amen. Amen. Thank God for his word tonight. How many you are grateful for the word? I bless you. Amen. Uh, brother Bobby Wartz, his funeral is tomorrow. We want to keep that family in prayer, the entire family. Um, sister brother George Moore sent me a text about Eden. She's been throwing up and has had a fever for 4 days. They've taken her to the ER and uh, requesting prayer for her. Sounds like it's pretty serious. Also, brother um will Alifont's dad Stan Alifont was taken to the emergency room. His uh retina detached in his eye and so he's in the emergency room, I believe, here in Tucson. Sister Deborah McGinty had a a treatment for her face just the other day. Going to keep her in prayer. um brother Art's family that was um that he lost at the funeral for. There's a number of them that want a Bible study. So, we're going to do that this Friday. I'm going over there to one of their homes. They were ready. They were wanting to do it right away. So, be in prayer for that. Amen. Um, also someone had a request for a coworker named Billy. And so I don't know who turned that one in. Was that you, Joe? All right. Brother Joe has a coworker named Billy. Thinking about our brother Angel Harris. Um, I haven't heard from him. I know it's not good. So we'll pray for Angel also for the the group in Mesa there tomorrow. There's a gentleman Jonathan Houchin that will be preaching for the service there. So be in prayer for that and also for our meetings that are coming. Um we want to be in prayer for that and also we want to just pray for one another. Amen. Was there someone else that had a request they want to make known? Yes. Mr. Joy, she's not feeling well. All right. Someone else had a request they want to make known. All right. So, we'll keep these requests before the Lord. Brother Brandham talked about this the black man there in in the ISUsa street. Um, how many know what his name was? Anyone here? Got it. Yeah. Seymour. William Seymour. I was studying his life here a couple years ago. I have a few books on him. But when he was seeking the Holy Ghost, so he was preaching it, but he had never received it. And so he was praying and it got to where he was praying five hours a day. That's how serious it he was about seeking the Holy Ghost. And the Lord used him tremendously. I was thinking about that, his consecrated life and how the Lord used him. So, we are in the astronaut age. Lord, help me to get off my bicycle and get into the astronaut age. Amen. So, God bless you. Um, let's take these requests before the Lord. We have a little time to go before the Lord in prayer. And so, let's stand to our feet and we'll sing that. There was no other requests, right? Or announcements. There's no announcements. I don't think I believe the choir is moving forward every Sunday afternoon on till the meetings. There'll be choir rehearsal at 3:30. Keep that in prayer. Also, we will have another work day, but there is some little things that can be done that if someone has free time afterwards. There's a couple things that um that um if you have time to do that, uh work on that list. I think that's another way to do it. But there will be another workday November the 1st, right? Amen.
