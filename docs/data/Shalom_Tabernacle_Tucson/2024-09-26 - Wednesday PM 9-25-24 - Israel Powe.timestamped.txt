[25:55] morning this evening amen amen we
[25:58] certainly greet each of you we're so
[25:59] happy to see you tonight we' like to go
[26:02] into the word of the Lord there's just
[26:05] three places in the scriptures Hebrews
[26:07] chapter 11 Romans chapter 10 and
[26:11] Deuteronomy chapter
[26:13] 30 Hebrews 11 so good to see brother
[26:16] George and sister Randy back and um each
[26:20] of
[26:21] you enjoyed the meetings over this
[26:24] weekend with brother Bates I thoroughly
[26:26] enjoyed that
[26:29] I believe it was the Lord speaking to
[26:32] us and encouraging our hearts
[26:39] amen verse one now Faith is the
[26:42] substance of things hope for the
[26:45] evidence of Things Not
[26:48] Seen for by it the elders obtain a good
[26:53] report through faith we understand that
[26:55] the worlds were framed by the word of
[26:59] God so that the things which are seen
[27:03] were not made of things which do
[27:06] appear amen take a
[27:09] scripture in Deuteronomy Romans chapter
[27:14] 10 Romans chapter
[27:21] 10 verse number
[27:26] five the apostle Paul's bringing the sin
[27:29] for Moses described the righteousness
[27:32] which is of the law that the man which
[27:35] doeth those things shall live by them
[27:38] but the righteousness which is of faith
[27:40] speaketh on this wise say not in thine
[27:44] heart who shall Ascend into heaven that
[27:48] is to bring Christ down from above or
[27:50] who shall descend into the deep that is
[27:53] to bring up Christ again from the dead
[27:56] but what saith it the word is nigh thee
[28:00] even in thy mouth in thy heart that is
[28:04] the word of faith which we preach amen
[28:08] take one more scripture in Deuteronomy
[28:10] chapter
[28:13] 30 really could read that whole
[28:17] chapter in Romans but the safe
[28:22] time Deuteronomy 30 verse number
[28:26] 11 this is the script scripture that the
[28:28] Apostle Paul was referring
[28:31] to that the word is n
[28:35] thee for this commandment which I
[28:37] command thee this day it is not hidden
[28:41] from thee neither is it far off it is
[28:45] not in heaven that thou should us say
[28:48] who shall go up for us to heaven and
[28:50] bring it unto us that we may hear it and
[28:54] do it neither is it beyond the sea that
[28:57] thou sh should it say who shall go over
[28:59] the sea for us and bring it unto us that
[29:03] we may hear it and do it but the word is
[29:07] very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in
[29:11] thy heart that thou mayest do it amen we
[29:17] pray God's
[29:19] blessing over his word actually let's go
[29:22] to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we
[29:24] come before you tonight we thank you
[29:26] Lord for the opportunity to stand here
[29:29] with the elected the redeemed of the
[29:32] Lord that have been washed by your blood
[29:35] Lord we
[29:36] claim every promise that you've given to
[29:39] your bride in this last day and Lord
[29:42] though we may not see and even feel
[29:45] encouraged like we should your word is
[29:48] still true and we claim Every Blessing
[29:51] every promise you have for us raise us
[29:54] up out of whatever despair we're in if
[29:57] there's there's any negative or Darkness
[30:00] or just discouragement Lord just Lift us
[30:02] up we pray by Your Word tonight and
[30:06] encourage our hearts Lord we know that
[30:08] you've given this day to us it's a day
[30:11] that you made we'll be glad in it Lord
[30:14] and we'll worship you and we just pray
[30:16] your blessings now for each one the
[30:19] hearts that are on the stream and those
[30:21] that couldn't be here tonight remember
[30:24] them those that are maybe on their way
[30:27] we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you
[30:30] you may be seated we've been talking
[30:33] about this whole man and being
[30:36] healed um but it sets up to what we had
[30:41] talked back in earlier this year in
[30:44] February March I I remember talking
[30:48] about a positive testimony and never
[30:51] letting your testimony be negative and
[30:54] that our words are seeds that we plant
[30:57] and I think I may made the statement
[30:58] that you need to go plant a garden plant
[31:01] go plant some trees go plant some things
[31:04] in your life and that planting happens
[31:07] through the word of God and brother
[31:09] random takes a message here in the
[31:12] message the resurrection of
[31:14] jerus 1954 and he says this now what is
[31:18] faith faith is the substance of things
[31:21] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[31:24] Seen you'd say that shirt is white yes
[31:28] well now if your faith says that you're
[31:31] going to be healed just as sure as just
[31:34] as true to you and just as real that
[31:38] your sight says that that's white
[31:40] there's no need of being prayed for
[31:42] you're already healed that's it you can
[31:46] go home so you're going to get well you
[31:49] can't keep from it see it's not just an
[31:53] emotional it's not something Mystic it's
[31:56] a fact
[31:58] a truth sight will fail everything else
[32:02] will fail but Faith Faith Can't Fail see
[32:06] because it goes into the supernatural
[32:09] Realms and it can't fail amen and um
[32:14] remember we were sharing with you and we
[32:17] listened to the tape I think on Sunday
[32:19] night no Wednesday night where brother
[32:21] Bram was talking to the doctor about and
[32:26] he told him they thinking about
[32:28] something good to eat and he said
[32:29] squirrel and pinto beans and then
[32:32] there's a reaction started to happen in
[32:34] his body he said what did that he said
[32:36] that that there w a wire in your brain
[32:40] sent a message down as he began to think
[32:43] about eating and this is this is the way
[32:46] our bodies are made and brother Brandon
[32:48] brings it out and the doctor tells him
[32:51] that the cases where Christians get
[32:53] these news that they're going to their
[32:56] life will be shortened or bad news and
[32:58] they just take the attitude well you
[32:59] know I got to go sometime
[33:01] anyways I'm going to heaven I'm a
[33:03] Christian I'm saved he said that
[33:05] attitude almost always retards the case
[33:10] because it's the attitude and it's the
[33:12] way we think brother bam tells us it's
[33:14] not mind over matter but it is a fact if
[33:18] you think something is helping you it
[33:22] probably is and if you approach
[33:25] something with the right attitude you'll
[33:28] get more out of it than with the bad
[33:30] attitude that's right that's right your
[33:34] your your waitress at the restaurant
[33:37] will say Amen to that just a good
[33:40] attitude is just beneficial for you it's
[33:44] your approach and this is just in the
[33:47] natural and and brother brandom brings
[33:49] this out and the scriptures brings it
[33:52] out to us they don't say that you know
[33:56] who's going to bring the word down from
[33:58] Heaven who's going to come from the sea
[33:59] to bring it to me so don't say that
[34:02] because the word is nigh thee it's
[34:04] already in you in your heart and in your
[34:07] mind Romans 10 goes on to say that if
[34:10] you confess with your mouth the Lord
[34:12] Jesus that thou shalt be saved it's just
[34:16] a
[34:17] confession in in our natural you know
[34:20] the Natural Body you know your mind is
[34:23] here and your speech is here and your
[34:26] heart is here just just a short distance
[34:29] between what's in your heart and you
[34:32] speaking it out of your mouth and though
[34:35] we want to meditate on the right things
[34:36] and that's good and to read the right
[34:39] things and that's good but the
[34:41] confession is where it begins to take
[34:43] place when you speak it things begin to
[34:46] happen and this is these are laws as
[34:49] we've said before these are principles
[34:52] that God has established in his word
[34:56] he's established even in the laws of
[34:59] science they use certain laws like
[35:02] gravity and the different things that
[35:04] they use to to accomplish their
[35:07] equations to know how fast things travel
[35:10] how you know it's it's all God he he
[35:14] puts the universe together with atoms
[35:17] and there's a law there's an order to it
[35:20] there's a structure and when you go to
[35:22] study him he can reveal what that order
[35:25] and that structure is and when you do
[35:28] get that Revelation then you can operate
[35:30] better you'll know how to operate better
[35:33] and this is what science is they study
[35:35] nature they study animals they study
[35:37] people and then they come up with ways
[35:40] of doing things a bit better we the
[35:43] believer know that God has founded his
[35:46] word the Earth everything has been
[35:48] founded by his word he speaks his word
[35:53] and then it happens now a beautiful
[35:57] thing that the prophet introduces to us
[36:00] in um the message Jehovah Gyra many
[36:03] other messages he brings in the seven
[36:07] compound names of
[36:10] redemptions and the scriptures have it
[36:13] there very plain I'd like to read a few
[36:15] of those but before I do let's go into
[36:19] that enticing Spirits just one more time
[36:22] and brother random is talking about our
[36:23] soul our body and our minds and he says
[36:27] seek the first the kingdom of God I'll
[36:29] take paragraph 45 and he says this I I
[36:32] really believe this is very very
[36:34] important and I'm asking the Lord to
[36:36] help me and I pray that you would ask
[36:39] the same that these things will become a
[36:41] reality to you he says now all things
[36:45] ought to be considered prayerfully first
[36:48] seek ye first the kingdom of God and his
[36:50] righteousness and all these other things
[36:52] will be added I am positive sure this
[36:55] morning if men and women could only get
[36:59] into the position of where their soul
[37:02] their thinking their attitude will be
[37:05] perfect in the sight of God that would
[37:07] be one of the most powerful churches
[37:10] that ever
[37:12] existed so when we when he says churches
[37:15] think of individual that would be one of
[37:16] the most powerful individuals because
[37:19] when he's talking about churches he's
[37:20] talking about people why not me why not
[37:24] you be one of the most powerful churches
[37:27] that ever existed and as I've been
[37:30] thought on these things more and more
[37:32] brother George this has changed the way
[37:34] I Repent okay this has gone deeper into
[37:38] the way I repent and I'm processing what
[37:42] sin is you know of course you know we
[37:45] know the dirty ugly sins the outward
[37:48] sins malice enemies all those things
[37:50] like that but then when you start
[37:52] looking in the word and that word begins
[37:54] to examine your intentions and your
[37:58] motives so that's this has nothing to do
[38:00] with nobody else it ain't somebody
[38:03] else's fault the real problem is the man
[38:07] in the
[38:08] mirror and if if God can get if I can
[38:11] release my mind to God that where my
[38:14] soul my thinking and my attitude is
[38:17] lined up properly that's right right
[38:20] I'll be a better I'll be better in my
[38:21] Ministry I'll be better in my prayer
[38:23] life I'll be better in the way I handle
[38:25] you and everybody else so this has
[38:27] changed the way I Repent it's gone
[38:30] deeper than just you know getting by or
[38:34] look like I'm getting by because he sees
[38:37] everything
[38:38] anyways paragraph 46 he says watch for a
[38:41] few moments on the physical now we have
[38:44] many times and half for years we got
[38:46] what we call a lie detector you can put
[38:48] it on your wrist set it across their
[38:50] head and you can get in there and try
[38:52] your best to make a lie sound like the
[38:54] truth and it'll register negative every
[38:57] every time because the human was not
[38:59] made to lie lying is a deceitful hard
[39:04] thing evil thing I'd rather have a
[39:07] drunker with me any day than a liar see
[39:11] a liar and your body wasn't made to lie
[39:14] no matter how sinful you are you're
[39:17] still a fallen Son of God the most
[39:20] sinful person in the city today God
[39:22] didn't intend you to be sinful he wanted
[39:25] you to be a son or daughter of his
[39:27] you're made up in his own makeup but sin
[39:29] has caused you to do that and no matter
[39:33] how much you try to impersonate and try
[39:35] to make a lie seem right they got a
[39:37] scientific instrument that proves that
[39:40] it's wrong you can tell it with all the
[39:43] Innocence you want to but it'll still
[39:45] register negative because there's a
[39:48] subconscious down in a human being and
[39:51] that subconscious knows what's truth and
[39:54] no matter what you're saying out here
[39:56] that sub conscience know that it's a lie
[39:59] and it'll register off the
[40:02] subconscious
[40:04] therefore if a man or woman could ever
[40:07] get their thoughts and their testimony
[40:12] and their lives so lined up with God
[40:16] Amen until the channel of the holy
[40:19] spirit will be perfectly one with God
[40:22] what would take place if the man or
[40:25] woman could ever get lined up
[40:28] where with the freedom from their heart
[40:29] with Faith from the innermost so just
[40:32] think of those three rings the three
[40:34] rings that make up the man he looks on
[40:37] the heart we're on the inside God when
[40:40] it comes from the heart all things are
[40:43] possible then your confession meets up
[40:46] with your life your life speaks as loud
[40:50] as your confession does but when you
[40:54] confess says one your confession says
[40:56] one thing and your life lives another
[40:58] there's something wrong
[41:00] somewhere that's because you've got an
[41:03] intellectual faith and not of Faith from
[41:06] the heart and that shows that outside
[41:10] here is a knowledge of God but inside
[41:14] here is a demon of
[41:17] doubting I believe in Divine Healing but
[41:20] it's not for me see H it could be so but
[41:23] I don't believe it get it outside you
[41:27] say yes inside your conscience says no
[41:30] that same scientific thing would prove
[41:33] that that wasn't right prove it give me
[41:36] a preacher give me a Christian give me a
[41:38] housewife that's a Christian give me a
[41:41] farmer or a factory worker that will put
[41:44] God first in everything I'll show you a
[41:46] man will be
[41:48] successful in the spite of all the devil
[41:51] can put on him he seeks God
[41:55] first now how many can say praise the
[41:58] Lord to that this is um this is so true
[42:02] so you know as we speak on the the
[42:06] confession and the words that we speak
[42:08] they mean so much and how your your
[42:12] words Ecclesiastes 52 says be not rash
[42:17] with thy mouth and let not thine heart
[42:20] be Hasty to utter anything before God
[42:24] for God is in heaven and thou on Earth
[42:28] therefore let thy Words Be
[42:31] Few and the scripture goes on and says
[42:35] in Matthew 12:
[42:36] 3637 this is the Lord Jesus but I say
[42:39] unto you that every Idol word that meant
[42:43] shall speak can can you say Every Idle
[42:47] Word every is that every word this is
[42:50] Jesus he says Every Idle word that men
[42:53] shall speak they shall give an account
[42:57] thereof in the day of judgment for by
[43:01] thy words Thou shalt be justified and by
[43:04] thy words Thou shalt be
[43:08] condemned in the scripture so many
[43:10] places Proverbs 18:20 as we know goes
[43:15] even deeper now brother Ram mentions
[43:17] this here this a a quote that we all
[43:20] have heard before I want to read it
[43:22] again because it's still
[43:24] true and if reading the quotes make them
[43:27] less true then that's a devil that would
[43:31] tell you that actually read the more you
[43:33] read them the more they become more real
[43:36] amen because God is opening more to you
[43:39] this is in the message the law 1955 the
[43:42] prophet of God says this paragraph
[43:45] number
[43:47] 18 we'll go up just a little bit above
[43:50] paragraph 18 says
[43:53] so if we want a blessing let's be a
[43:57] blessing to someone else and a blessing
[44:00] will return like casting your bread upon
[44:04] the Water it'll return and that's true
[44:07] in all walks of life you'll find that
[44:11] you usually reap just as you sow so
[44:14] let's do good talk good be kind and
[44:18] people talk about us we'll say good
[44:20] things in kind things and good things
[44:23] will come our way if we'll give them out
[44:26] now Paul speaks speaking here of the
[44:27] Valley of the Shadow rather the law
[44:30] being a shadow of good things to come
[44:32] could never make the worshiper perfect
[44:34] then he goes on to show you what
[44:36] Perfection is now it's a strange thing
[44:39] that this is so much thought of people
[44:43] they say well I'm weak my faith is not
[44:47] very much I'm not a very good Christian
[44:50] that's just what the devil wants you to
[44:52] say you're just talking his language
[44:55] right then see you mustn't never say
[44:59] that don't never let your testimony be
[45:03] negative let it be positive all the time
[45:07] I am saved I've got God in my heart I
[45:10] believe him with all my heart do you
[45:12] believe in Divine Healing with all my
[45:15] heart let your testimony always and your
[45:20] thoughts
[45:22] everything never permit a negative
[45:25] thought to come in your mind mind if you
[45:28] can help it am I talking to anybody when
[45:32] it starts that don't entertain it well
[45:35] you say I can't help the thoughts from
[45:36] coming well that'll be like the farmer
[45:38] that said he couldn't stop he couldn't
[45:40] stop the birds from flying over his
[45:42] place but he can sure stop them from
[45:45] roosting and that's a good thing you see
[45:48] you can't help the thoughts when they
[45:51] come but don't don't don't entertain
[45:55] them just pass it on no sir Jesus Christ
[45:58] is my savior All Things Are Mine by God
[46:02] I'm going to keep them I'm going to
[46:04] testify of them and God can only bless
[46:07] you as you confess that he has done it
[46:10] for you he's the high priest of our
[46:13] confession is that right Hebrews 3 he
[46:15] said he's the high priest of our
[46:18] confession and we he can only do for us
[46:21] as we accept it and believe it and
[46:25] confess it can you say Amen
[46:29] now that's
[46:31] real negative thoughts come I mean they
[46:35] just come and sometimes they come when
[46:38] we're tired when we've been squeezed we
[46:42] been we we we put out everything we
[46:44] could and people don't appreciate us and
[46:47] then it happens again and we start
[46:49] building it up in our mind and it's just
[46:51] negative all around all of us are
[46:54] susceptible to that because we have a
[46:55] real enemy and the Battleground is in
[46:58] our mind but we don't have to permit it
[47:02] he says never permit it never permit a
[47:06] negative thought to just where you're
[47:09] entertaining it the scriptures Ephesians
[47:11] 2 says give no place to the devil don't
[47:15] give him any room to to start building
[47:18] something in your mind that's contrary
[47:21] to the
[47:22] word um you think sometimes it feels
[47:25] good to be a little NE we want to hold
[47:27] on to it we feel that carnal flesh of
[47:30] ours we want to stay mad just a little
[47:33] bit get into the emotion of being mad I
[47:37] want to feel this and someone wants to
[47:40] make it right with don't make it right
[47:41] with me yet I just want to feel this
[47:43] feeling and then we can make it right
[47:45] later you know we we ought to want to
[47:48] wallow in that yes sir and be justified
[47:52] in that because it's not pleasing to the
[47:54] Lord it not the Holy Spirit leading us
[47:56] to do do that and um he's given us the
[48:00] word it's nigh thee even in your mouth
[48:04] and in your heart and you have to
[48:06] confess that now brother bam brings this
[48:10] seven compound Redemptive names the
[48:13] scriptures do and brother Ram talks
[48:14] about it I'll just read them off there's
[48:16] the Jehovah Rafa Jehovah Shalom Jehovah
[48:23] Rah or Roy Jehovah situ Jehovah Gyra
[48:27] Jehovah shama Jehovah
[48:31] nii the Lord who heals the Lord is my
[48:33] healer the Lord is my peace or our peace
[48:37] the Lord is my shepherd or the Lord has
[48:40] provided a sacrifice the Lord our
[48:44] righteousness the Lord will provide my
[48:46] provider the Lord is there or is present
[48:51] the Lord is my banner Jehovah nii now
[48:55] these seven compound Redemptive names I
[48:58] like the way brother random puts it I
[49:00] got three quotes and then we'll we'll
[49:02] we'll go into prayer as we think about
[49:05] what these compound names are and what
[49:07] they mean and how they apply to us today
[49:11] here in the message uh 1957 Jehovah Gyra
[49:14] brother bam says this paragraph
[49:18] 15 I think of that sometimes when you're
[49:20] right in those Great Moments you see the
[49:22] god of Heaven step right in and change
[49:24] that scene oh it's so wonderful
[49:27] I think that the folks are home are
[49:29] praying now see we must we mustn't get
[49:33] in our minds that God just works with
[49:36] one
[49:37] individual he works with us as a body
[49:41] we're all one one's just as important as
[49:45] the other one we got to be together to
[49:48] make the body of Christ now I want to
[49:51] use my subject for just a little while
[49:53] if I maybe take my watch off that I
[49:55] won't get too long and I want to speak
[49:57] on the subject of Jehovah Gyra it's a
[50:01] very deep
[50:03] subject now Jehovah Gyra means the
[50:06] Lord's provided sacrifice now God
[50:09] appeared in the Old Testament in seven
[50:12] compound Redemptive names Jehovah Gyra
[50:15] the Lord will provide a sacrifice
[50:17] Jehovah Rafa the Lord that Health all
[50:20] thy diseases Jehovah Manasseh Jehovah
[50:23] the armor the buckler the shield and so
[50:26] forth for seven compound Redemptive
[50:30] names those Redemptive names are
[50:35] inseparable you can't separate them
[50:38] because they each one apply to an
[50:42] attitude of
[50:44] Jehovah this is God's attitude each one
[50:47] of those um uh names of redemption apply
[50:52] to an attitude of Jehovah here what the
[50:54] prophet of God says in 1955 5 paragraph
[50:57] 18 He
[50:59] says here we want to make our quotation
[51:02] I have written out on the envelope here
[51:05] that carry the seven compound names of
[51:08] Jehovah in other words it was what
[51:11] Jehovah is is made up in the seven
[51:15] Redemptive names of his now God his
[51:19] attitude towards the people from Eden
[51:22] Back to Eden is wrapped in the seven
[51:25] Redemptive Nam names the first one be uh
[51:29] being Jehovah Gyra which means the Lord
[51:31] will provide a sacrifice the second one
[51:34] is Jehovah Rafa the Lord the Healer
[51:37] Manasseh our Banner Shalom our peace
[51:41] Roy is Shepherd our righteousness sham
[51:46] the Lord is
[51:49] present brother bam continues in the
[51:51] message Jehovah Jara 1955 and he says
[51:55] this
[51:57] my last quote he says this paragraph
[52:00] number five now I wish to continue my
[52:02] text and it was found in Genesis
[52:05] 2214 the text was Jehovah Gyra now God
[52:09] is God has seven compound Redemptive
[52:12] names now in these compound Redemptive
[52:16] names it was God expressing his present
[52:21] attitude for all his creatures what he
[52:24] would be for them in all all
[52:27] generations you cannot separate his
[52:30] compound name now in Washington DC my
[52:34] name is recorded it makes me they what
[52:39] what nationality I am who my father and
[52:41] mother was how much I weigh when I was
[52:44] born my description my prints my thumb
[52:48] you see it's the expression to the
[52:50] nation who I am and William brandom is
[52:54] recorded up there in Washington that's
[52:57] my the expression of me to the nation
[53:00] that is my name so when God came down
[53:03] from heaven to be king over the Earth he
[53:06] expressed himself to his subjects in
[53:10] seven compound Redemptive names Jehovah
[53:14] Gyra was his first name it means God
[53:17] will provide for himself a
[53:21] sacrifice the next compound Redemptive
[53:23] name is Jehovah Rafa Meine I'm the Lord
[53:27] that Health thee and he goes on Jehovah
[53:30] our Banner our peace our Shield our
[53:33] righteousness that's what he is to us so
[53:36] we can't separate those names if he
[53:39] still Jehovah Gyra he has to be Jehovah
[53:43] Rafa also he is he if he's our provided
[53:49] sacrifice he has to be our healer also
[53:53] so the names are inseparable
[53:57] we accept him as Savior we must also
[54:00] accept him as healer as our peace as our
[54:03] Shield as our Banner all these
[54:06] Redemptive names God's present attitude
[54:09] is to his people now the same now Sunday
[54:13] or two ago or few Services back I asked
[54:17] how many of us are saved and we would no
[54:20] problem can say we're
[54:22] saved if I ask you the same question how
[54:25] many of us are healed
[54:27] you think
[54:28] well yeah maybe I am healed or I'm kind
[54:31] of you know I'm feeling kind of bad
[54:33] maybe I will accept my healing well
[54:36] that's the wrong that's the wrong answer
[54:38] because just as saved you as you are
[54:41] you're just as healed it's not something
[54:44] that might happen it's not something
[54:46] that we're looking to take place it's
[54:49] not like a lottery ticket that you know
[54:51] God might smile on me and heal me no no
[54:54] no he's already Smiled On You
[54:56] and you're already healed just like
[54:59] you're saved the same blood it's in the
[55:02] same Covenant that he is my savior he is
[55:06] also my healer and these seven
[55:09] Redemptive names are seven Redemptive
[55:13] attitudes and I'll add one more to you
[55:16] there are seven Redemptive confessions
[55:19] that you ought to be making there're the
[55:22] confession that the believer should be
[55:25] speaking
[55:26] that the Lord Is My Savior My Healer my
[55:30] provider the Lord is with me he'll never
[55:33] leave me or forsake me all of my needs
[55:37] are already met in glory he has
[55:41] everything covered for he is my banner
[55:45] and this is the conversation of the
[55:47] believer because that's God's attitude
[55:50] towards the believer and if you can
[55:52] imprint these confessions into your
[55:55] heart and then speak them out of your
[55:58] mouth the word is nigh thee even in thy
[56:00] heart and in thy mouth and your body
[56:03] will ly up with that word this is not
[56:06] Hocus Pocus this is not a trick this is
[56:10] the word of the Lord this has already
[56:13] been settled it's called it's like the
[56:16] law of gravity but greater it's God
[56:19] created in the beginning he said it will
[56:22] be and it was let there be and it was
[56:26] and that is the word of the Lord to us
[56:29] that's God's attitude so if he is your
[56:32] savior how many of you saved tonight let
[56:34] me see your
[56:36] hand let me see that tired hand let me
[56:40] see that weary hand that struggling hand
[56:43] barely making it hand you can't get more
[56:46] saved Saints you either saved or you're
[56:49] not if you're saved today guess what
[56:52] you'll be tomorrow you'll be saved
[56:55] tomorrow and and guess what you'll be on
[56:57] the other side
[56:59] save what about your healing it's the
[57:03] same thing what about your peace what
[57:06] about him being your banner what about
[57:08] him fighting your battles what about him
[57:11] being your Shepherd what about him
[57:13] meeting all your needs what about him
[57:15] never leaving you never forsaking you I
[57:20] am Jehovah shama I'm always present
[57:24] that's the word of the Lord yes seven
[57:27] Redemptive
[57:29] names seven Redemptive
[57:34] confessions you
[57:36] know he is the
[57:39] savior and he is the
[57:41] Healer that's what he is he's the
[57:45] Healer and not only is he the Healer he
[57:48] is my
[57:50] healer how many can say praise the Lord
[57:53] to that and I can read to the Bible
[57:55] where he was someone healer he was this
[57:57] sister's healer he was this brother's
[57:59] healer I can look into this congregation
[58:01] he was this one's healer he was that
[58:03] one's healer but the confession isn't
[58:05] that he's just a Healer or somebody's
[58:08] healer yes sir but he's my healer my
[58:11] healer he's mine that's his attitude
[58:15] that's his attitude that's my attitude
[58:17] and my attitude is my
[58:19] confession if he's somebody's savior
[58:23] throughout the scripture he was savior
[58:25] to many and the many we know in this
[58:28] congregation he was a savior to them but
[58:30] not just that he is my
[58:33] savior so say it yes sir when the enemy
[58:37] comes in when the negative thoughts come
[58:40] say what the word of God says because
[58:42] the worlds were framed by these words
[58:46] because you're taking the words of the
[58:48] lord it's not your word it's not your
[58:51] strength it's not your power to bring it
[58:53] to pass it has nothing to do that that
[58:55] you can do within yourself you're
[58:57] quoting what the word of God said about
[59:00] you this is Jehovah's attitude towards
[59:04] you can I get an

[59:57] righteousness my life was filthy rags
[59:59] but his life wasn't I was no good but he
[1:00:02] was good I wasn't worthy but he was
[1:00:05] worthy so his worthiness is now my
[1:00:10] worthiness by the blood of the Lamb
[1:00:13] That's My Confession now that's his
[1:00:15] attitude is my confession the Lord will
[1:00:18] provide Jehovah Gyra how many need the
[1:00:21] Lord to
[1:00:22] provide is he able is HE capable
[1:00:27] is he more than able yes the Lord is my

[1:00:41] lord is here Jehovah shama that means
[1:00:44] the Lord is present he said I'll never
[1:00:46] leave thee or forsake Thee the Lord is
[1:00:50] always with you and Jehovah ni the Lord
[1:00:56] Lord is my
[1:00:58] banner the Lord is my
[1:01:01] banner you know that that Jehovah n the
[1:01:04] Lord is my banner was
[1:01:06] when Moses and the children of Israel
[1:01:09] were fighting against
[1:01:11] amalec and Joshua was down there
[1:01:14] fighting the battle and they started to
[1:01:16] lose and so Moses would put his hands up
[1:01:19] and as his hands got up then they begin
[1:01:22] to win the
[1:01:23] battle and then as he got tired they
[1:01:26] finally set him on the Rock and then
[1:01:27] they took two brothers and held up his
[1:01:30] hands and Moses couldn't hold up his
[1:01:33] hands he was too tired so two helpers
[1:01:35] held up his Moses's hand you say why was
[1:01:37] it Moses's hands because that's the way
[1:01:40] God set it
[1:01:41] up uh in other words y'all not going to
[1:01:44] win without Moses you're in the fight
[1:01:47] but you need somebody you need a
[1:01:49] prophetic covering so you can win this
[1:01:52] battle so they in the battle and you
[1:01:54] look up and you see Moses hands up oh
[1:01:56] yeah we got
[1:01:58] this if Moses hands is down it's like I
[1:02:01] don't know if we can make it when they
[1:02:03] in the battle fighting they look up on
[1:02:05] the hill they see Moses hands up it's
[1:02:07] like yeah we can do this boys and every
[1:02:09] time his hands was up they fought the
[1:02:11] Battle they fought they fought and they
[1:02:13] won the Victory and Moses called him
[1:02:17] Jehovah nii the Lord is my banner you
[1:02:22] need that on your job you know that you
[1:02:25] need that in traffic you need that in
[1:02:27] the courthouse you need that with the
[1:02:30] crazies get out here with their guns and
[1:02:32] their attitude they got attitudes but we
[1:02:34] got attitude too we have Jehovah's
[1:02:36] attitude and that attitude that the Lord
[1:02:39] is our Banner now they got a bad
[1:02:42] attitude and we can take a bad attitude
[1:02:44] and try to fight them but the attitude
[1:02:46] that God give us is Jehovah ni the Lord
[1:02:53] is my banner I don't have to fight F
[1:02:56] anybody the Lord's got my battles he's
[1:02:59] the fighter of my battles victory
[1:03:03] victory shall be mine if I hold my peace
[1:03:07] and let the Lord fight my battles
[1:03:10] Victory oh Victory shall be
[1:03:12] mine isn't that
[1:03:14] beautiful those are our confessions
[1:03:17] tonight that's the compound names
[1:03:20] they're
[1:03:21] Inseparable so if you're a little
[1:03:23] discouraged on him being a provider just
[1:03:26] always go back to that one you're sure
[1:03:27] of and that's he is my savior and if he
[1:03:30] is your savior they're compound they're
[1:03:34] Inseparable they all go together and
[1:03:38] he's all of these things to the believer
[1:03:40] at all times amen God bless you richly
[1:03:43] the Lord bless you give you what you
[1:03:46] have need of
[1:03:47] Amen so tonight we'll go to the Lord in
[1:03:51] prayer take time to
[1:03:54] pray Jesus just spent lots of time in
[1:03:59] prayer
[1:04:00] um as I said I've been repenting a bit
[1:04:04] different My Confession has been a bit
[1:04:06] different and you know my as I take
[1:04:10] inventory on the time that the Lord has
[1:04:13] given me here the time that he's given
[1:04:16] me that
[1:04:19] um you know it changes your how you'll
[1:04:22] pray and how you'll uh give your time
[1:04:24] and so we you know I talked about the
[1:04:28] other day if you you know how you can't
[1:04:30] sleep at night and you know it be nice
[1:04:32] to carve out that time and just praying
[1:04:36] Give the Lord a
[1:04:39] time in the we hours of the morning it's
[1:04:41] hard to do I've committed myself to
[1:04:43] trying to get up early I set my alarm
[1:04:47] but oh man this whole tired body is like
[1:04:50] man you do it next week we'll get it
[1:04:53] next time but you got to uh you got to
[1:04:57] kick the old man kick that tired man
[1:05:01] wake him up because there's something
[1:05:04] greater and you'll never there will be
[1:05:06] no regrets for the time you spend with
[1:05:09] the Lord in prayer there are no regrets
[1:05:13] now you can sleep too much and then
[1:05:15] you'll be regretful of it you can you
[1:05:17] can do a lot of things too much but you
[1:05:18] can't never what too much pray too much
[1:05:21] this is a little prayer meeting we thank
[1:05:23] God for the little place we have too
[1:05:25] pray we won't always have this time to
[1:05:28] pray we know that nothing stays the same
[1:05:31] changes happen we just don't know in in
[1:05:34] you know but tonight we have it so we
[1:05:37] thank the Lord for it and if um and we
[1:05:42] have more of more times that we can
[1:05:44] commit to the Lord in prayer and Jesus
[1:05:47] spent much time in prayer there's a
[1:05:48] whole set of quotes I have put together
[1:05:50] there where brother brandom talks about
[1:05:53] if Jesus the son of God had had to spend
[1:05:56] much time in prayer now he's qualifying
[1:05:58] it by an amount much time in prayer to
[1:06:03] fellowship with the spirit that was in
[1:06:05] him how much more you are I and if you
[1:06:09] go back and you look at all the
[1:06:12] revivalists that had healing meet
[1:06:14] meetings and Ministries that God blessed
[1:06:16] them with as I'm going I'm looking at
[1:06:18] Oral Roberts and AA Allen I think AA
[1:06:22] Allen's son lives here right in the city
[1:06:24] somewhere I saw a testimony gave I don't
[1:06:26] know if he's still alive and then um um
[1:06:30] TL
[1:06:32] Osborne and these men would fast for
[1:06:35] days three days no food no water for
[1:06:40] their Healing Ministry that they had in
[1:06:43] an organization or denomination and God
[1:06:46] honored it and God blessed it and God
[1:06:49] was with him and then you look at
[1:06:51] brother brandham and the life that he
[1:06:54] lived and the time that he spent in
[1:06:57] prayer Jesus to and this is with the
[1:06:59] commission of an Angel minister to him
[1:07:03] now the
[1:07:04] lazy the lazy man doesn't want to pray
[1:07:07] that's right can I get a witness can we
[1:07:10] be honest we don't want you know to get
[1:07:12] down on our knees okay we we'll find a
[1:07:15] comfortable position to
[1:07:18] pray so we can slide right into our
[1:07:21] sleep but but I'm talking about me now
[1:07:25] now so don't get uptight with me I'm
[1:07:28] talking about me the the carnal man
[1:07:31] don't want to pray it's always a reason
[1:07:33] I got to do this it's too hard here you
[1:07:36] know it's not quiet enough it's too much
[1:07:39] I'll get it next time and so forth and
[1:07:41] so on but
[1:07:43] prayer is an absolute for the believer
[1:07:47] as we draw closer to
[1:07:49] him and if you want to speak to God and
[1:07:52] God speak to you you need to pray you
[1:07:56] there's no other way to do it you need
[1:07:58] to carve out that
[1:08:00] time and make yourself available to
[1:08:02] speak to the Lord get quiet with him
[1:08:05] however you do it a quiet time and spend
[1:08:08] time in prayer and let the Lord Jesus
[1:08:11] reveal to you
[1:08:12] secrets and things for your life keys
[1:08:16] for your soul for your life so you can
[1:08:19] overcome and I need that I need more of
[1:08:22] it God help us all amen if if this
[1:08:26] church would just increase in its prayer
[1:08:29] life
[1:08:30] alone my would it help us would it help
[1:08:34] our youth would it help when the
[1:08:36] preaching Goes Forth would it help the
[1:08:38] song leader you think you think it'll
[1:08:40] help the Sunday School do you think God
[1:08:43] might give dreams and visions and
[1:08:45] increase our healings in our midst for a
[1:08:50] church that prayed more what do you

[1:39:02] so
[1:39:04] um I want to describe how we caim the
[1:39:08] church and how we've done it for over
[1:39:10] the last 10
[1:39:11] years uh we've asked uh two people each
[1:39:16] week to spend four to five hours
[1:39:20] cleaning the church and I just want to
[1:39:23] recog recognized those people that have
[1:39:26] blessed us for those years the king
[1:39:29] family uh both Sister Barbara and U
[1:39:35] brother Chuck they've
[1:39:38] been doing this for a long time
[1:39:42] and uh we're kind of running out of gas
[1:39:46] so we got you uh the PO family sister
[1:39:50] Sharon and and their family have been
[1:39:53] and uh cleaning the church and uh sister
[1:39:58] uh uh K and Carina would would clean the
[1:40:04] church and uh they after sister K passed
[1:40:08] then I've been helping

[1:40:15] uh helping out uh now um the Morris
[1:40:19] family and Bazi family uh they've
[1:40:22] cleaned the Church also for a lot of
[1:40:25] years am I forgetting
[1:40:33] anybody thanks
[1:40:36] so we're going to change the format from
[1:40:38] once a week to cleaning it uh on
[1:40:42] Wednesday night so going from four to
[1:40:44] five hours but we want to go from to
[1:40:47] about 30 minutes and what we want to do
[1:40:50] is create uh a group of people that have
[1:40:53] about 10 to 12 tasks to occur to carry
[1:40:57] out and those tasks will be uh um
[1:41:02] dusting uh vacuuming uh mopping cleaning
[1:41:06] the bathrooms taking out the trash so
[1:41:10] what we'll do is most of the tasks will
[1:41:12] only take uh 10 to 15 minutes and after
[1:41:15] you're done with your tasks then you're
[1:41:17] done and so uh but if we can do it with
[1:41:20] a big group then we can really just
[1:41:22] knock it out quickly um so that's what
[1:41:25] we're asking people uh we want to get
[1:41:29] the whole church to do it we don't want
[1:41:31] uh just the people that have been doing
[1:41:34] it but we do want those people that have
[1:41:36] been doing it to train the new people
[1:41:39] how to do it so that you know because
[1:41:42] people won't know exactly what to not to
[1:41:45] not to uh uh do anything to this piano
[1:41:48] we know how to do that so there are some
[1:41:51] things that uh the the ways that we've
