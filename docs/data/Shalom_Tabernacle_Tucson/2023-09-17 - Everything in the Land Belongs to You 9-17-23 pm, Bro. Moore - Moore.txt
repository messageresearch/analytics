be back again there was a time in my life where I'd been doing anything but coming to the house of the Lord but that man's gone and dead and and God replaced him by a new creature that's desire is to come to the house of the Lord I I appreciate that how many of you love the Lord tonight amen let's turn to our Bibles while we're all standing to Genesis the 14th chapter should appreciate the musicians and songs and appreciate Brother Scott laboring through today and as he's recovering Genesis the 14th chapter I want to take a little subject a little further I talked about this on Wednesday night in Phoenix but I guess we could call this part two and want to go a little deeper into this uh thought here in Genesis the 14th chapter and the eighth verse and there went out the king of Sodom the king of Gomorrah and the king of adma and the king of Zebulon and the king of Bela the same as zor and they joined battle with them in the valley of sidom with cheddar lomer the king of Elam and with title king of Nations and with amphil king of sonar and arak the king of elisar Four Kings with five and the valley of sidom was full of slime pits and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled and fell there and they remained fled to the and they that remained fled to the mountain and they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their victuals and went their way and they took lot Abram's brother's son who dwelt in Sodom and his goods and departed and there came one that had escaped and told Abram to Hebrew for he dwelt in the plane of mammary the Amorite the brother skull of the brother of Aynor and these were the in these were Confederate with Abram and when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants born in his own house 318 and pursued them unto Dan and he divided himself against them he and his servants by night and smote them and pursued them unto hoba which is on the left hand of Damascus and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his goods and the women also and the people and the king of Sodom went out to meet them after his return from the slaughter of Cheryl lomer and of the Kings which were with him at the valley of Shiva which is the King's Dale and Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and he blessed and blessed be the most high God which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him tithes of all can you say Amen to the word of God today amen let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you for the reading of your precious word we thank you for this group of Believers gathered here this afternoon we thank you for the songs that were sung we thank you for a place to sing them in Lord and but most importantly we thank you because your presence is here Among Us you're with us tonight and I just ask oh God that you would take this further part of the service bless it Lord I pray that you'd watch over me tonight bind my lips before I'd speak anything unpleasing to you and we'll commit it into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ God bless you and you may be seated and I want to take a subject tonight of everything in the land belongs to you and I'll read you this quote from the way of a true prophet of God brother Branham said when as I said Abraham see he was in the promised land God gave it to him lot was taken by some Renegade Outlaws took away that was his nephew all right everything was in that land belonged to Abraham so he wasn't a warrior he never did fight he didn't have any warriors with him he had some servants but when he seen that something the devil had come and robbed him of something that was a promise to him he armed his servants and took an arm himself he didn't know how he was going to overcome this whole company of Kings just a handful of servants but God told him how to do it and he divided himself and slaughtered the Kings and come back triumphant why he laid his faith upon God's promise that everything that was in the land was his and lot was a part of it that's right was a part of the land oh my and there he met Melchizedek after the battle was over could you just see Abraham coming up the road he didn't know he was a warrior but he knew then he was yes sir and he met the one who gave the promise Melchizedek now Saints I'll tell you everything that was in that land belonged to Abraham is that what brother Branham said and we find that Abraham was minding his own business he was in the valley of mammary and he was minding his own business and these kings came in and they took Sodom and Gomorrah captive and when they did they took lot away with them and Saints that's where they messed up right there because they took something that belonged to Abraham amen and keep in mind saints that Lots was down in the wrong place he was amongst the wrong crowd he was in with the wrong company and he deserved everything that was coming at him but it didn't matter because he was still a part of Abraham amen and he said in a message God's word calls for a total separation from unbelief brother Brown said all these Believers as we could go on for hours all these were like a bunch of change in your out of your pocket in God's hands he said you pull out a bunch of change and there's pennies nickels dimes quarters half dollars dollar all in coins and that's what the world is in God's hands there are some people that just can have a Penny's worth of it and God can only use them in a penny way that's all they can buy don't reject them brother Branham said and it's like what brother Israel is preaching on this morning if you run into somebody at the grocery store and they tell you that the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ has saved them and and has delivered them then praise God don't don't reject them brother Branham said if they can't believe the real truth don't turn them down don't kick them out and say they're not of it because God uses pennies sometimes and lot was just a penny and Abraham was a silver dollar so it taken a hundred lots to make an Abraham and so will it take a hundred carnal uh Believers will never stand in the presence of a genuine Christian that's separated from the carnal things of the world living in Christ Jesus where the word now listen Saints where the word can flow through them and I'm here to say tonight saints that this should be our goal is that we live a Christian Life That's separated from the carnal things of the world living in Christ Jesus where the word can flow through US amen that's got to be our goal today is to have the word of God flowing through us it's got to be our our motive our objective is to have the word of God flowing through us today see the Lord separated that's got to be your desire today saints that the Lord separates you from the carnal things of the world and that the word of God flow through you is that your desire today Saints say it ain't just about what you're doing it ain't just about your life but you're not just standing for yourself you're standing for your children you're standing for your husband you're standing for your wife you're standing for your loved ones you're standing for your church you're standing for your family you're standing for your community you're standing today it ain't just about you it's about everybody you come in contact with it's about the people you're related to it's about and we got to get to the point to where the word of God can flow through us because we can have an impact on those around us you create an atmosphere that has an impact on those around you so it's not just about you that's selfish real Christianity brother Brown said is living for others amen so we're not just living for a sample we're living for those that's around us we're living for those that's coming in contact with us and we got to have the word of God flowing through us and when they see us they can say there's something different about that brother there's something different about that sister there's a presence about them there's an anointing about it there's something about them that I like to be around I want to be around it I want more of it yeah amen and we're standing for something tonight we're standing for a message tonight we're standing for our brother tonight amen turn to your neighbor and say I'm standing for you see brother Brown talked about that that train car about the seal being placed on the outside of it and he said it couldn't be placed on the outside until everything else on the inside was just right amen and he said in a token message he said full obedience to the whole word of God will entitle you to the token full obedience not the part of it as far as your denomination goes but all of it full obedience to the word which is Christ brings you into Christ now what if you was just all in but your feet hanging out what if you was all in with your hands hanging out most all of us sin but the heart hanging out see see the hearts in the world yet see but we don't do that full complete obedience puts you and the word one you believe it every bit all of you it's it's in you and now you watch it working through you man we need to become one with the word because we got people that need saving Saints we need to come one with the word because we need the ability to apply the token in their life and if we are one with the word we're entitled to the token is that right so our prayer has got to be Lord separate us from the world separate us from the things of the world because I got family I got friends that needs you Lord I separate me let the word flow through me Lord separate me from the world so that the word can flow through my life because my family needs you my children needs you my friends needs you the people that work needs you and I need you Lord to flow through me [Music] amen separate us from the things that were Saints this ain't no time to let the world creep into our lives it's too late to have the world creeping into our lives it's no time to see how close to the edge we can get amen that's not who we won't drive in The Chariot we won't stay as close to the wall as we can come on somebody tonight it's no time to see how close we can get it's no time to have one foot out in the world it's no time this is a time of separation not separation from Brotherhood we got enough of that going on not separation for Fellowship we got too much of that but separation from the things of this world so that the word of God can flow through Us Saint sometimes it feels like we're losing the battle against worldlyism in this message Saints amen it seems like it's creeping in from all sides Saints it looks it looks like they're close keep getting tighter it looks like the dress keeps getting more and modest it looks like the paint keeps getting thicker it looks like the men keep keep cowering down like women well Saints men got to be men men got to leave their home man gotta work man got to provide man got to take care of the families men got to be a support to their wife a support to their children yes amen and we got men that you're just turned into whether and have no control over their own flesh just to pass the least resistance that's the way they go but thanks that ain't being a man being a man is doing the right thing whether you feel like it or not then being a man is going to work whether you feel like it or not it ain't time to be one with the world it's time to separate from the things of the world it's time to separate from worldly amusements worldly entertainments I know it's hard preaching tonight but it's time to separate from the things of the world Saints amen because the guy takes full obedience to the word of God to apply the token and we don't want to see how much more worldly we can get we won't see how much cleaner we can get we'll see how much closer we can get amen amen we got a we got to take care of God first and then and then our family next and then ourselves last Saints is that right hey man we got to have that kind of character in our lives and the message cries out against these things but people go on like like brother Ram didn't say it but he did say it he cried out against it amen but but you don't hear a lot of crying out against it anymore but but since we got to separate from the things of the world it ain't no time to let a ball game or a TV program or some kind of entertainment keep us out of the house of the Lord it ain't no time for that it ain't no time to let things come more important to us on Sunday they're coming to church it ain't no time for it it ain't no time to have no energy for church on Wednesday but we got energy for a TV program it ain't no time for it since it's time to separate from the things of the world brother Brown's sitting in unconditional Covenant that God made with his people he said God wants separators separate yourself that's right God always calls for separation separate from your Kindred from your people separate from your Associates separate from your habits separate from everything and come out and stand alone with God that's where the first man was called by election that's where the last man's been called to do the same thing separate yourself from the associates and the things of the world and come out from among them and be separate he said then I'll bless you how many of you want to be blessed tonight he said if you want a blessing separate yourself from the things of the world oh yeah now we're gonna have to go through some homes to do that you got to go in and look around and say is this profiting me or is this hindering me is this bringing me closer to the Lord or is it driving me further away and then you go to the next room and do it again and go to the next room and do it again and say is this a help or a hindrance because if it's not bringing us closer to the lord it's pulling us further away you can't remain neutral [Music] and so you see people many times in churches and different places and and then they claim to believe the message many times and you wonder what they ever really see do they ever really see it do they ever really get a hold of something do they have that Revelation it seems like they never really sell out it seems like they're just they're always around but they don't ever really sell out and you wonder why don't they sell out why don't they give it all the gods they may come to church or just maybe they're just not as consecrated as as we think they are to be or or maybe they just don't maybe they just don't understand what we think they should but Saints I'll tell you some are pennies and some are nickels and some are dimes and summer quarters and some are silver dollars but let me caution you that I'm not really interested tonight and trying to classify who everybody is I'm not really interested in trying to say you're a carnal believer or you're a a natural believer you're a spiritual believer or you're a foolish version or your version I don't know since I've been wrong too many times I've seen too many people that I thought wasn't going to make it and something snapped and something happened and they rose up in the in the power of God and live differently I've seen God do it too many times I've seen him change people I've seen people go for years just living a certain kind of life and then all of a sudden something set fire and everything changed so it ain't how you start it's how you finish I don't know how anybody's gonna end up you don't know how anybody is going to end up that's all in God's hands amen so we don't give up on nobody we just believe for everybody I've seen it go the other way too I've seen what I thought was real Believers and they're not around no more today amen those things are up for God it's up to us just to preach the word it's up to us just to testify we don't we don't put nobody in we don't take nobody out those things are all God's business amen now Lots brother Brown said was a carnal believer but he was still a believer now the Bible said that the sins of Sodom vexed his righteous Soul daily is that right Saints but he was hanging around with the wrong crowd he was hanging around with the wrong people and the people that you're around have an influence on you and it doesn't matter how strong a Believer you are it doesn't matter how much of the message you know if you hang around the wrong people it'll have a negative impact on your testimony is that right Saints it doesn't matter it's me you anybody if you're around the wrong people it's gonna have an effect on you and lot was around the wrong crowd down in Sodom and Saints if you get around the wrong people it'll have a negative effect consequently you cannot get around Holy Ghost Field Bible believing Christians and it not have an influence on you is that right if you want to be Godly hang around godly people if you want to be worldly hang around worldly people and it'll rub off on you is that right Saints that's why we have to assemble ourselves together amen this might be the only time all week long that we're around other believers this might be the only opportunity that you have to shake the hand of a brother or sister and tell them God bless you once you leave this place you might not come across another believer until you come back here amen that's why we assemble together more not less amen and we find also that we don't need to look around and try to size everybody up say pennies nickels dimes quarters okay that brother there looks like about 17 cents a sister over there by 37 cents see we could get a critical spirit on us where we're just looking around trying to find everything that's wrong with everybody trying to pick on everything that everybody's doing wrong is that right Saints now the Bible said that the sins of Sodom vexed slots righteous Soul daily another thing brother Branham said is Lord had wife trouble always gets quiet here brother Ezekiel he said he had wild trouble I'll tell you Saints if you got a good wife you sisters if you got a good husband that's a huge blessing the best thing God could give a man is a good wife outside of his salvation most important decision we can make outside of our Salvation is who we're going to spend our life with brother bear said the sins of Sodom vexed his soul only his wife wouldn't permit him to do anything about it she belonged to all the clubs and things and see lot had got himself into quite a predicament he was in quite a situation but it didn't matter because he was a part of Abraham and everything that was in that land belonged to Abraham and because he was a part of Abraham think about it when the destroying Angels Came to take care of Sodom they couldn't even touch Sodom until April until lot left because Lots was a part of Abraham they couldn't even destroy it until they got lot out of there not because lot was lot but because Lots was a part of Abraham you remember when Sarah laughed within herself brother Branham said that that angel would have would have took her life right then but he couldn't do it because Sarah was a part of Abraham that's what it means for you to be a believer tonight that's what it means Saints for you to serve the Lord that's what it means for you to live this message that's what it means for the word of God to flow through you amen because you're a part of Abraham amen and see Saints you might have family today that's got themselves in a similar predicament we've all got family that's got themselves I'm sure in quite a quite a mess quite a bad shape and it maybe it doesn't look like there's any way they can get out of it we've all got maybe we got children that's gotten in a bad shape you don't look it looks like they're so far gone you don't understand how God's ever going to bring them back but Saints everything that is in this land belongs to you because you're the Seed of Abraham and the Seed of Abraham is heirs with him according to the promise everything that's in the land belongs to you just like the The Prodigal Son in Luke 15 the man that we all know the story I talked about this the other night in in Phoenix but we we talk we know of the story of the man that had his inheritance given to him early and he went out with that inheritance and he blew it all he spent it all on worldly riots it's living and he found himself broke and then a famine hit the land and he found himself so low until he was in a Hog Pen and his job was to feed the swines and he was in such a condition that he didn't even have his own food to eat and the Bible said that he was eating the corn husk That was supposed to be fed to the swine that's how low he had gotten he was in the shape of eating a corn husk and I told him the other night Saints I'm not a farmer I don't know a lot about corn but I do know that the corn husk is the part of the tamale that you throw away that ain't what you eat now I don't know about farming but I know a lot about tamales pastor and I know that you throw the corn husk away but he was trying to eat that and he was in such a low estate now many of us might say to the prodigal son or to lot well you deserve what you got because the mess you're in is the mess you made and Saint sits that way a lot of times most of the time the problems that we're dealing with are problems we created ourselves most of the time the problems that we fight are things that we've done by the decisions that we have made and you might say well he deserved it but I'll tell you saints that according to the word of God we all deserved it Corinthians the book of correction he said all of us deserve death because we are rebellions against God correct notice we all deserve dying but God is so merciful till he shouldn't never thought of us but he's so merciful till he took the sins of every one of us and struck it upon his own beloved Son Christ that we might not perish but would have eternal life and you say well say you say well I'm a pretty good person I I've lived a message all all of my life that's good but you still had to have your sins taken from you you say well I've been a pretty good person I've done a lot of good works and that's good but you still have to have your sins taken from you and I'll tell you Saints we all would be in that same situation tonight except for the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we all would be in that same situation except for what God did for each and every one of us it's not by my own will that I'm here tonight it's because God who is rich in Mercy call me out of this world and I'll tell you Saints we got to have a little bit of Grace in this day and age for people we got to have some love for people we got to understand that we never know what people are going through we never know the battles people are fighting we never know the trouble they're in we never know what's going on when they leave this church you don't know what happens when they leave here you don't know what they're fighting before they get back you don't know what people deal with before they come into work you don't know what they deal with in their homes you don't know what they deal with at school we never know what's going on behind the scenes and we got to have a little Grace this is a deceitful age people make mistakes the devil sets traps for everybody and we get caught from time to time come on somebody we get caught from time to time it's so deceiving it's so polluted it's so wretched it's so vile it's almost impossible outside of the Holy Ghost you can't keep yourself pure you can't keep yourself it's God keeping us so we got to have a little bit of Grace now we talked about it the other night it's a Bible study in Galatians 1 it says Brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual is that us Saints is the bride spiritual ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted amen see we all are not above temptation we're all not above making a mistake and we got to have a little Grace come on somebody tonight Brother Band listen is the message of Grace he says but now according to the prophecy there will come The Headstone and I want you to notice when that headstone comes the prince that's going to cry out the message will cry Grace Grace for it's by Grace were saved not that of Works lest any man should boast and the message of Grace has been trampled on the feet of man until it's become a disgrace say we don't believe anything goes we don't believe in worldly living we don't believe that just let everybody do what they want to and God's going to save you we don't believe that that you just can get by with anything God's a good God we don't believe that's TV preaching amen but we believe that if somebody makes a mistake there is Grace for them we believe that if somebody comes up shorts they can have Grace we believe that God forgives us we believe that if you ask God God will do that for you we don't believe in making it a disgrace but we do believe that every one of us is potentially fixing to fall in some way none of us is above it and there's Grace if we make a mistake amen brother Bram said it's the disgrace some of them runs out into eternal security some runs out into everything but the true message of Grace Remains the Same and that's where Satan tries to knock it out from the church but it's the grace of God that we're all saved by can you say Amen to that then why let me skip down a little bit then why could anyone criticize and say grace is wrong that we're saved by works we're saved by grace through faith not by works works shows that you have been saved but what saves you is the grace of God grace saves you Grace is what God does for you works is what you do for God to show appreciation of what God did for you but by grace are you saved what a beautiful example of The Prodigal Son the Bible sentence Luke 15 17 that when it came to himself now Saints I want you to remember he was in the pig pen when it come to itself he was eating corn husk when it came to himself he was in a famished backslidden decrepit dirty rotten condition when it came to itself foreign and I remember the day that I came to myself I remember the hour when I came to myself I remember the time when God reached down into that same Hog Pen [Music] and pulled me out I remember that day and I believe that if he does it for me he can do it for anybody I believe that the same God that saves me can save my family I believe the same God that protects me can protect my children I believe the same God that came got me in the whole pen can't come get my my friends at work [Music] I believe the same God that God me can come get the man on the streets I believe the same God that got me can come get the girl at the grocery store I believe the same God that keeps his hand on us can't keep his hand on our young people and I remember when I came to myself I remember the hour everything changed and this young man was sitting in a hog pan eating corn husk in the mud in the manure and he said you know what my father has got slaves that's living better than I am he said it'd be better to be a servant in My Father's House it'd be better to be a slave in my father's house than to be sitting out here in this manure pile eating these corn husks see it's better to be a doormat in the house of God than to dwell in the tits with the wicked and he said I'll arise and I'll go to my family and I'll say in Him Father I sinned against heaven and before Thee I like the approach here Saints I like the repentance I like that attitude I like the way he went see say so many times we see people they try to serve the Lord but they don't ever really repent they don't ever really feel sorry for the life that they lived they don't feel sorry for the sinus in their life this man knew he'd messed up he knew he needed help he was willing to admit that and he said I'm no more worthy to be called thy son but make me as one of the hard servants that he rose he came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him and his son said father I'll sinned against heaven and in our sights and I'm no more worthy oh God to be called thy son is that the way you feel tonight's Saints I'm no more worthy to be called thy son but the father said to his servant bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and choose on his feet and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry for my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they began to be merry see Saints God what he deserved everything that he got he deserved to be in that Hog Pen but his father had Grace on him his father had mercy on it no matter what he done he was still his son and he had Grace for him amen I remember the day when he had Grace for me I remember the hour when that Grace changed my life now we find back it a lot that lot had got itself into a bad situation his life was in shambles his life was kind of a mess but he still belonged to Abraham and brothers and sisters there might be people in our lives that have got their self into a bad situation their life might be a mess too but they still belong to you their life might be a mess but that's your mess because everything that's in the land belongs to you your children might not be where they want them to be they might not be doing like you want them to do but they're yours they belong to you and everything that's in the land belongs to you your family might not be where you want it to be but it's your family it belongs to you and they might have done things to deserve the mesitarian but it doesn't matter because they're a part of you they're still yours and you still apply the token to their life just like Abraham was moved with compassion for his nephew we got to be moved for compassion with the church has to be moved with compassion say Saints this message is my family this message is the greatest people in all the world there are no people nowhere on Earth better than the brothers and sisters in this message it's the greatest people I've ever been associated with it's the greatest people I've ever been around and I know we got problems and I know we got faults and I know people make mistakes but they're still the best of the best the cream or the crop and you can't get no better than the people in this message and I know there's disagreements and I know there's bickering and I know there's trials and I know churches don't get along but Saints they're still my family they're still my family and we might get into it in the backyard but if you get around to the front yard and you need a hand I'm gonna be there to help now brother Brown said there was 10 of them branhams and they fought like cats and dogs in the backyard but if you got around to the front yard and you started messing with one of them Brands you're gonna get all 10 of them on you and he said that's the way the church is amen I'll tell you Saints I know we got disagreements I know we got problems but we got to have each other's backs we got to have each other's backs there's so much evil in the world today and I see people and I see churches and I see that we may not agree with everybody's Doctrine but Saints I'll tell you when you look around and you see the attack that's coming against these churches in the message today I may not agree with them but I don't want to see that [Music] I don't like these websites it's cropping up to cause problems for these churches amen that's all right it's that church but it might be this one next I don't like these news articles and these interviews that's against these message churches I don't want to see that I may not agree with them and they might have done things to deserve some of that but I still don't want to see them come against they're still my brothers and sisters and I still got their back and if they need my help I'm going to be there if there's something I can do I'm gonna do it because everything that's in this land belongs to me now I want you to notice that lot had gotten taken away and these Kings had come down and they'd already defeated five Kings in their armies and they took Sodom and they took Gomorrah and they took lot and it took all of his stuff and it left and Abraham was faced with the tax the task of going and rescuing lot he was moved with compassion for his nephew and lot brother Brown said that Abraham wasn't a warrior and he didn't have any Warriors working for him he said he took 318 of his own servants and he armed him and then he armed himself I like that Abraham wasn't scared to get his own hands dirty he didn't just send his folks he went with him and he went out and and what I like about that is we don't read in the Bible of anywhere that God came to Abraham in a vision or and said Abraham go get lot or any time we don't read in there where the Angels appeared to Abraham at that particular time and said go get lot now we do know brother Branham said that God showed him how to do it but we don't see him anywhere where there was an audible voice from God that spoke to Abraham or where an angel told him how to do it or or where a staircase rolled down from heaven and told him how to do it he didn't do any of that but lot was was part of Abraham and Abraham already had the promise that everything in that land belonged to him is that right Saints and see sometimes brothers and sisters When Trials come we begin to pray we begin to seek God and we should and we're waiting on the leadership of the Lord but sometimes we're looking for a supernatural sign or we're looking for an audible voice and we want to see a vision or we want to dream a dream when God has already give us his word amen see Abraham acted on the word of God that he already had God had already told him that that land was his and everything in it was his and he went upon that word brother Brown said and why Christ speak he said there's no place to retreat in God oh come on there's no place to retreat in God he said go forward he said the doctor says it's cancer go forward it says it's TB go forward if the devil says you can't give this up go forward if your home says you're going to be a fanatic go forward the church turns you out go forward there's no retreating back go forward speak and go forward speak what his word and go forward the saith the Lord and move on amen Saints if you get sick the word has already told you you're healed amen you're the Seed of Abraham Saints and a Seed of Abraham is heirs with Abraham according to the promise everything in this land right here belongs to you what land is he talking about the promised land now to us that's the Holy Ghost everything in this word belongs to you you have become part of the laws of God now there's a a little quote I read I think the last time I preached here I read it again in Mesa I'm going to read it again tonight because it's it's too good not to believe it's too powerful not to believe it's too true not to believe he said in a restoration of the Bright Tree he said then we have the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God gave us for God has a law and his word is a law and God is in this word made certain claims to the church therefore we have a right to force these claims upon Satan and say give it back and he has to do it because we can take God's agent the Holy Spirit and go right down on our knees and say it's thus saith the Lord and he's got to give it up that's all because the holy spirit is there to make him do it skip down just a little bit 89 he said but the law of the spirit of God is to force Satan to give up that which he has unrightfully deceitfully taken from God Souls of men he took from God Souls of women children sickness of the body he placed upon people where God made him in his image to be like him and the church is given the rightful legal rights by the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and enforce this upon him so you have a right as a Believer tonight you have rights as a Believer tonight he said and he swore by himself I don't think I gave y'all this quote he said and he swore by himself paragraph 286 he said now by faith my brethren and my mother moved right into this blood cell with the Lord Jesus where all those Redemptive blessings are yours your everyone Christians I presume then if you are Christians you have a right a legal right for everything that Christ died for it's your possession you own it it's yours now the only thing you can do is do like Abraham and after he had endured a fight he obtained the promise Satan just don't let you take it easy you got to have faith you gotta believe it you got to endure but everything Saints it's in this land belongs to you you have a right to the Redemptive blessings of God tonight do you believe that tonight do you believe you have a rights to the Redemptive blessings of almighty God but we gotta fight for every inch of ground that we're standing on amen we got to quit waiting for everything to fall in our lap we got to stop hoping the devil doesn't do anything else bad to us and start taking back what he's took from us now these things don't come easy they take time they take prayer they take fast and they take they take consecration they take separation from the things of the world but the Redemptive blessings of God are yours tonight eternal life is a Redemptive blessing of God forgiveness of sin is a Redemptive blessing of God freedom from the curse of the law is a Redemptive blessing adoption into the family of God is a Redemptive blessing peace of God is a Redemptive blessing the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a redempted blessing Divine Healing is a Redemptive blessing deliverance from an inbred weakness is a Redemptive blessing the virtues of God faith and joy and knowledge and Temperance and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness and love or redempted blessings the virtues of God the gifts of the Spirit are all the Redemptive blessings of almighty God and when you stand redeemed you stand forgiven holy Justified free and adopted and reconciled to God oh God the Redemptive blessings of almighty God belong to the believer tonight everything in that land belongs to you because he died for it he made a way for it and it belongs to you so we just believe God's word and we go forward we don't go backwards you say are you feeling any better I'm feeling fantastic are you feeling better today I'm feeling wonderful how's your how you doing today by the grace of God I'm wonderful today oh how's your family doing they're getting better how's that child doing they're coming closer to God every day that's good there's no going backwards in God everything in the land belongs to you and these four kings came and they took Sodom and it already whipped the five Kings in their armies but where they messed up is when they took a lot because Lots belonged to Abraham and Abraham didn't know he was a warrior but he knew everything in that land belonged to him and brother Brown said he divided himself and slaughtered the Kings and came back triumphant why he laid his faith upon God's promise that everything in that land was his and lot was a part of it that's right was a part of that land say Saints Abraham didn't know he was a warrior David didn't know he was a Warrior when he smote Goliath shamgar didn't know he was a Warrior when he picked up that Ox gold amen and Abraham didn't know he was a warrior but brother Brown said on his way back he knew and Saints I don't know what your testimony is I don't know what kind of background you got I know that I grew up fighting mom had to come get me from school all the time because I got into it with somebody they kicked me out of high school several times because I was always in a fight with somebody I grew up that way I grew up rough so I was always a fighter and it served me well in the message pastor and that may not be your background you might say well I didn't grow up like that I'm not a fighter you might say well I'll tell you brother George I just was born in the message and I've been raised in a message home and I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I've lived for the Lord every day of my life Saints that's the best testimony that I know of there's no greater testimony than the testimony if I was born in a message I was raised in the message and I'll served the Lord every day of my life that's the testimony I want for my children that's what I want for my grandchildren you don't have to go out in the world so that you can say you got a testimony you can live with the Lord every single day of your life and that's the greatest testimony that there ever was what a testimony that is amen and you might say well I don't know if I'm a fighter or not I don't have one else or it's shattering testimonies I didn't get shot four times I I wasn't member of a gang I didn't run and I was I've been good all my life and I and the Lord saved me and he and he said he's helped me and he's taking care of me you might not have that kind of Earth shattering testimony but that don't mean you're not a fighter see Abraham didn't know it was a fighter Sam guard didn't know it was a fighter and you you might not know if you're a fighter or not but I'll tell you Saints the devil does not want to go to battle against a mama fighting for her children the devil does not want to go to battle against a housewife fighting for her marriage the devil does not want to go to battle against a child praying for a wayward parents the devil does not want to go to battle against a grandmother building a hedge of protection around her grandchildren the the devil does not want to go to battle against the daddy fighting for his little girls amen it ain't the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight that's in a dog all right because everything that's in that land belongs to you see Abraham was forced into battle he didn't go looking for trouble but he wasn't going to run from it when it came he didn't go looking for it but he wasn't backing down when it got there I love the verse and if I must fight then I must Reign Saints if we gotta fight anyways we might as well win if we got a battle every day anyhow we might as well be victorious amen if you got a loose if you gotta tie your boots up something's got to go down if we're gonna fight anyways why don't we win Saints and we're going to fight every one of us is going to fight every one of us is going to battle why don't we win tonight [Music] we're gonna have to do it anyway and I'll tell you if you got to take out the sword of the of the word if you got to take the sword of the truth about Saints then something's got to go down somewhere there's a devil's got to be taking a whooping when you get the word outs it's like Peter Cartwright when it went into that little town and he had the word of the Lord and the Lord told him to hold a Revival and when he went into that little town he was watching the windows getting ready for the Revival and a town bully told him we ain't having no revivals around here he said well the Lord told me to is that right is that the story of saints the Lord told me to hold a Revival here he said if you're going to have a Revival here you'll have to whip me first he said well I just do that next then yeah I just handled that next and he said he got on top of it he said if I must fight then I must Reign increase my courage Lord and he said that bully got saved at nights caused everything that was in that land belonged to him man amen so if the Hellman's salvation goes on the gloves got to come off Saints if we gotta fight anyways we might as well win amen ever present water from the Rocks see Saints the brine has got to recognize who she is he said if there wasn't a law to that Sons and Daughters of God would create them a world out here and go live a private life on it he said you have the power in you to do it if you've got a shadow of the power of God in you you've got power to do it my my mind is that what it says Saints he said God is omnipotent see what I mean the power that's in you will make you could speak a world into existence and go live on it now keep in mind brother Israel read this morning those things are sovereignly given see because the way we are now if I spoke something into existence you'd go speak it out of existence he said the power that's in you will make you could speak a world into existence and go live on it Hallelujah there you are that's the power is in the church now but it is controlled by a law and that law is not to just keep a bunch of Commandments it's a law of faith and Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe that is yours every place the soul of your foot can set upon by faith God gives it to you amen it's yours you possess it and if you find the key to this law of faith that opens it to you you see what I mean that power controlled by if you are a son of God you are a daughter of God that never leaves you it's with you all the time by your faith gets away from it but it's still there Hallelujah now recognizing your day in his message he said the spirit of God which is the word of God and I'm closing now matter of fact the musicians can go ahead and come he said the spirit of God which is the word of God my word is spirit and life we'll put the bride in her place want to put the bride in her place Saints the word will put the bride in her place he said well put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in Christ we'll put her in her place no National Force will do it but the National Force did Drive Israel into the Homeland the national forces of the Council of churches will drive every organization into it but the power of God will raise the bride into Glory out of it amen so Abraham took God at his word and he went and took back Lots because everything that was in that land belonged to him Abraham wasn't sure he was a fighter but he knew on his way back that he was a warrior he knew everything in that land was belonging to him speak and go forward tonight Saints the power is within us if we can believe amen oh God speak and go forward amen let's just bow our heads oh God oh God tonight Saints you might not know that you're a warrior and you might not know if you're capable of winning the battle but we have the word of God tonight in the same word of God that spoke this world into existence lives within the believer tonight and we've got promises in this word tonight we've got Promises to the believer tonight we got promises as a Seed of Abraham God has promised these blessings we've got promises contained in the Redemptive blessings of the Lord Jesus Christ and we've got the promise that the power of God by the word of God will put this bride in the rapture we've got promises that the token is applied to our family we got promises that everything in this land belongs to us amen can we just play something sister Sharon we've got promises today and the Lord knows all about what each one of us have need of and he knows all about what our struggles are and he knows all about what our tests are and he knows all about our trials he knows all about her family he knows all about her circumstances he knows all about our problems but he also knows that everything that's in this land belongs to you and if you got a need tonight you'd just like to have the faith say Lord I believe your word just give me the faith to hold to it tonight Lord just give me the faith to obtain the promise tonight I got a need but I know that you're the master of my circumstance I know you're the master of my trial I know you're in control Lord just give me the faith to speak the word and go forward give me the faith to lean not to my own understanding but to lean unto the understanding of the word of God let the mind that was in Christ be in me just let him know by the uplift your hand Lord you see these hands you know what your people need you knew before we asked but it's your way father to ask you want us to ask you require that we ask you said pray unto the Lord of the Harvest that he'll stay Ascend laborers into the Harvest and you are the lord of the Harvest standing right there but we had to ask and Lord we're asking tonight for these needs we're asking tonight for our trials we're

take we're asking tonight that you'll give us the faith to overcome these these uh the violence in our body that you'll give us the faith to obtain our healing tonight it shall give us the faith to obtain Deliverance Lord yet you'll give us the faith to separate from the things of the world that you'll give us the faith to to call upon you Lord just separate ourselves and to let the word of God flow through us tonight Lord we're asking tonight Lift us up Lord we're asking for that step ladder tonight Lord let's let us get up a little higher tonight Lord let us reach a little further tonight
