[40:58] said and call ye on the name of yours
[41:02] God and I will call on the name of the
[41:05] Lord and the god that anth by fire let
[41:08] him be God all the people answered and
[41:12] said it is well spoken let's pray
[41:15] Heavenly Father we just so grateful
[41:17] again for this time lord we just
[41:19] expecting to get more from you father
[41:22] because this is the best way that you
[41:23] use to speak to your people so bless
[41:26] Lord everything bless the service from
[41:29] the beginning to the end father and we
[41:31] hope that by the time we'll be going
[41:32] home we're going to go with a testimony
[41:34] and say indeed the Lord has spoken to us
[41:37] we pray and we believe in the name of
[41:39] Jesus Christ amen amen you may be
[41:44] seated so this is the parts uh this is
[41:47] one of my favorite stories in the
[41:49] Bible because it shows me the power of
[41:52] God and it testifies about the power of
[41:55] God and from this story we see a man who
[41:58] has overcome fear a man who's not afraid
[42:02] of anything because in the Bible at this
[42:07] time Elijah has decided to stop rain
[42:10] from Israel and he said as the is the
[42:15] Lord God of Israel liveth he was just
[42:17] telling the king and the King back then
[42:21] can be compared to what we call
[42:23] president today and Elijah never sh or
[42:26] never trembled before the king he was
[42:29] before the king because he was seeing
[42:32] what was going on in the city the
[42:34] corruption and everything he did not
[42:36] just take the time and maybe go uh to a
[42:38] television start to criticize or maybe
[42:42] uh he start to tell people hey this I'm
[42:44] not happy about this but he went before
[42:46] the king before the the the the
[42:49] president of that time and he told him
[42:51] as the Lord God of Israel leaveth before
[42:54] whom I stand there will not not be due
[42:57] nor Reign all these
[43:00] years not said that said the Lord but he
[43:02] said according to my word I'm the one
[43:05] who decides that you shall NE not get
[43:08] train nor do for all these years and it
[43:13] came to pass 3 years and a half there
[43:16] was no rign there was no do that was
[43:19] according to the will of a servant of
[43:23] God Elijah amen and then the spirit of
[43:27] the of the Lord told him now it's time
[43:29] for you to go and meet uh
[43:31] Ahab he went and met Ahab so he didn't
[43:35] even need to book an appointment he had
[43:38] just to show up because he knew that he
[43:40] was really
[43:42] important than Ahab the king and when he
[43:46] came before Ahab the king told him so
[43:50] you're the one who's bringing trouble in
[43:53] Israel you know in Elijah I just like
[43:56] you know his attitude he didn't have a
[43:58] lot of things to explain like can you
[44:01] see I do apologize you see he knew on
[44:04] what he was standing on and he was like
[44:07] no I'm not you are the one in your
[44:11] father's house you have forsaken the
[44:14] Lord's commandments and you went after B
[44:17] so you are the one bringing trouble in
[44:20] Israel who's this
[44:22] man who's this man how how courageous he
[44:26] is and back then they have laws like you
[44:30] have to respect the authorities you have
[44:32] to respect the king you have to obey
[44:35] whatever the king is saying but not
[44:38] Elijah because Elijah could not submit
[44:42] himself to the corruption that was going
[44:44] on he had a word to speak he had
[44:47] something to say and then he said now it
[44:50] is a good time let's just do a a show
[44:53] let do a show bring all your Prophets
[44:57] The Prophet of ba bring them put them
[44:59] together and then we're going to see who
[45:01] is the who has the real God let the god
[45:05] that will answer by fire let him be God
[45:08] because when you have God first of all
[45:11] you can't be afraid to prove what you
[45:13] got because we have power that what Paul
[45:17] you know uh told to Thessalonians he
[45:19] told them our gospel came not to you
[45:23] only in words but in power
[45:27] and in the Holy Ghost amen so the gospel
[45:30] is not just about talking talking by
[45:33] words only but that gospel has to be
[45:36] backed up by a power are we together and
[45:41] when you have that power you don't
[45:44] hide you don't hide yourself because
[45:47] when you have power you have to prove it
[45:49] that I have power and here's what uh
[45:53] Elijah did here he said bring them
[45:55] prophets we're going to see who's doing
[45:58] the right worship we're going to see who
[46:01] has the the true God so he was not
[46:03] afraid at all and he gathered 450
[46:06] prophets against one man are we together
[46:10] because our God is not he's not a god of
[46:13] multitude he just need one person who is
[46:15] Sincere he just need somebody who can
[46:17] recognize who he is and then use that
[46:20] person God will not wait for the entire
[46:23] Tu to get Revelation no if you got the
[46:26] revelation God will use you to bring the
[46:29] light to
[46:30] toon if you are a righteous God will use
[46:33] you to preach the word in ton and bring
[46:37] the light are we together and Elijah was
[46:39] here he gaed them all he put them
[46:43] together and he said now let's bring two
[46:46] ballocks this is a demonstration brother
[46:49] and you cannot do something like this if
[46:51] you don't know where you stand where
[46:53] you're standing at on what you're
[46:54] standing on you cannot do something like
[46:58] this if you still playing you know
[47:00] Church you know you don't know if you
[47:02] are a Believer or not you don't know if
[47:05] you have the Holy Ghost or not this is
[47:07] not for you cuz if you do this if you
[47:11] try to bring this kind of challenge oh
[47:13] my the devil you're going to be a good
[47:14] lunch for the
[47:16] devil this only for the people who knows
[47:21] where they are standing at are we
[47:24] together let me read something
[47:28] in a message God's way that's been made
[47:30] for us that he preached uh September
[47:35] 1952 the date it says 0 0 paragraph 9
[47:39] the prophet of God says after through
[47:41] the services of this
[47:43] week trying to show people that there is
[47:47] no need of being
[47:50] scared here is what he says the
[47:53] worst the worst thing
[47:57] the devil can put upon you is
[48:01] fear this is the worst thing the worse
[48:04] is
[48:06] fear
[48:08] if if you ever had a Cancer and didn't
[48:11] fear and believe God will heal you you
[48:13] wouldn't be in too bad a shape God take
[48:16] care of that if you are sick whatever it
[48:19] is if you didn't fear so fear oh my the
[48:23] prophet keep you know he keeps repeating
[48:25] this word fear is the worth things that
[48:29] Satan can place upon the
[48:33] person because when you're scared you're
[48:36] going to forget about the power that was
[48:39] vested in you on
[48:40] Calvary when you have fear you can do
[48:44] nothing at all and as long as you still
[48:47] you still scared as long as you still
[48:50] full and filled up with fear God will
[48:53] have a hard time to use you amen because
[48:56] God cannot use you when you have fear
[48:59] God need people who are
[49:02] fearless people who have you know this
[49:05] attitude like
[49:06] Elijah's people who can stand before
[49:09] anyone and tell the truth of the Gospel
[49:12] are we
[49:13] together here's what the prophet of God
[49:15] says in the message you know of
[49:17] spiritual Amnesia in the message
[49:19] spiritual amnia that he preached uh on
[49:22] November no April 11th 1964
[49:27] paragraph 146 I love this when I'm
[49:31] reading this I have to smile CU this is
[49:33] really really
[49:36] good he says they think he's talking
[49:39] about nowadays Christians he says they
[49:42] think just because I belong to
[49:45] church that's all is
[49:49] necessary and then he says do you have
[49:52] that he says oh brother
[49:56] that means no more to God than to be a
[50:00] Manson or anything
[50:04] else any other
[50:06] Lodge like for people are pressing
[50:08] themselves I come to church all the time
[50:09] I come to church the prophet God says
[50:12] that means nothing to God he says to
[50:16] belong to church that don't mean nothing
[50:20] to
[50:24] God he said
[50:26] you've got you've got to be Sons and
[50:28] Daughters of God that a condition
[50:32] belonging to church doesn't mean nothing
[50:35] but you have to be Sons and Daughters of
[50:38] God are we together he says you've got
[50:41] to be born of
[50:45] God see now we have the first category
[50:47] of people we all in church that's good
[50:51] but now we're going to call the second
[50:52] group of people Sons and Daughters of
[50:55] God God and then now we're going to call
[50:58] people who are born of God and that why
[51:01] we have three kind of Believers in the
[51:03] church when you all come together oh
[51:05] we're happy that was a nice service that
[51:07] was a good a a very nice service but are
[51:11] you born
[51:14] again are you born of God do you have
[51:17] the spirit of God because belonging to
[51:21] church it doesn't mean
[51:24] nothing we should be proud when we have
[51:28] the Holy
[51:29] Ghost I'm born again be proud of
[51:32] yourself cuz you are born again you can
[51:34] do wonders you can do a lot of things
[51:37] but I belong to church that a nth grade
[51:41] before
[51:43] God he says uh you have to be born of
[51:48] God
[51:50] and God is the
[51:53] word when I become part of of my father
[51:57] I become all my
[51:59] father when you become part of
[52:02] God you become God can you complete in
[52:09] full not a part of God not a portion of
[52:14] God but you become
[52:17] God in
[52:20] full this is nice so this this should be
[52:25] a Congregation of God in
[52:29] full are we together so when God is in
[52:33] full there is a certain power that goes
[52:36] with it it's not by words
[52:39] only because God you know the reason why
[52:42] the devil is
[52:44] scared uh is scared is scared of God
[52:47] it's because he knows his power
[52:50] am because there is no respect if you
[52:53] have no power
[52:56] are we together some country some
[52:59] countries fear other countries not
[53:02] because they want to but because they
[53:05] know they have some ammunitions that we
[53:07] don't
[53:08] have they have some some of the armors
[53:13] that we don't have so we are obligated
[53:16] to respect
[53:19] them it's by
[53:21] obligation because if I mess up if I
[53:24] make them m God they will come with
[53:27] their F35 F16 and our country will be
[53:30] gone are we together and there is no
[53:34] respect without
[53:35] power because the devil you you see the
[53:38] way he's messing up he has some kind of
[53:40] power but the power of God is above his
[53:44] power and that why he's always submitted
[53:47] to God are we together so the prophet of
[53:51] God says when we have the spirit of God
[53:54] we we are born of God we are God in
[53:58] full so the devil the same way is scared
[54:01] of our God he should be scared of us the
[54:04] same way am are we together but first of
[54:08] all we have to be born of God we have to
[54:11] be born of God so the question will be
[54:15] what's going on now why we don't see
[54:18] this things that happen in the Bible
[54:20] happening in our lives because I I I
[54:22] love my prophet he preached
[54:25] everything he said
[54:29] everything one time he went to India and
[54:33] when he was there he saw a group of
[54:36] people he said there was a multitude of
[54:38] people 17 confessions you know United
[54:41] together they were talking against
[54:44] God Muslims were there you know Buddha
[54:46] followers were were were there you know
[54:48] a lot of people Hindus were there and
[54:51] the prophet said the I heard something
[54:53] telling me if you don't say anything
[54:55] thing to defend Christ you know I will
[54:57] be a coward and the prophet of God stood
[55:00] up and that at that time they came you
[55:03] know a a blind man who was born blind
[55:06] and the prophet said now this is a good
[55:09] time to do another
[55:11] demonstration they were all against God
[55:14] they were cursing the name of Jesus they
[55:15] were cursing God but I like what the
[55:18] prophet of God did here he did not
[55:19] debate with them no he did not take his
[55:22] Bible and say hey stop what you're
[55:24] saying read here in John read here in uh
[55:27] in Corinthians that was not the time
[55:29] because for all that group of people to
[55:32] respect him or to know that he's in the
[55:34] truth he had to show them some power are
[55:37] we together and that's where a lot of us
[55:39] we are failing today we're just bringing
[55:42] people to believe by
[55:44] force and some of us have fear so we
[55:48] make people to fear like hey you going
[55:50] to go to hell see the way you are
[55:51] dressing you're not supposed to do this
[55:53] you going to go to hell then we put some
[55:56] kind of fear in their hearts and they
[55:57] come to our church they join us not
[56:01] because they were convinced not because
[56:03] they saw something
[56:05] Supernatural but because we made them
[56:08] Afraid come to our church you going to
[56:11] be saved are we together but the prophet
[56:14] of God was showing the power he brought
[56:18] that blind man and he said if you have a
[56:22] true
[56:23] God then God who will answer by fire let
[56:28] him be God today and he promised him for
[56:31] the first time the prophet of God told
[56:33] him if your God give back to this man
[56:37] his sight I will be baptized into your
[56:40] religion are we together and they were
[56:43] all there that was a challenge let me
[56:46] tell you Brothers you cannot serve god
[56:49] without challenging people and you
[56:51] cannot challenge people if you don't
[56:52] have power it's going to be a shame came
[56:55] for
[56:55] you to serve God you have to put a
[56:59] challenge if you have if you are born of
[57:02] God if you have the Holy Ghost you have
[57:05] to put a challenge but today the message
[57:09] some of the Believers they became even
[57:12] very very mean the way they are
[57:15] preaching they are preaching in the mean
[57:19] way condemning people condemning people
[57:23] but if them people people can see some
[57:26] Supernatural things happening in your
[57:28] life they will have to follow
[57:31] you if at work you show them some power
[57:35] of God they will follow you you're not
[57:38] going to need even to preach them but as
[57:41] there is no
[57:42] power there is nothing at all so the
[57:46] only weapon that we have is to make them
[57:50] afraid oh you're going to go to hell oh
[57:52] you're going to go to hell you're going
[57:54] to go to to hell you're going to go to
[57:56] hell the prophet of God in India did not
[57:58] tell them that if he told them if your
[58:02] God is real give back you know to this
[58:04] man his
[58:05] sight and if my God is real I will also
[58:08] pray for him we need s you know this
[58:11] kind of
[58:12] challenge this kind of challenges are
[58:15] the ones that we
[58:16] need oh they are wrong no we are right
[58:19] they are wrong we are right they are
[58:20] wrong if we are right where are Miracles
[58:24] yeah
[58:25] if we are right we are
[58:27] wonders let's leave them alone they are
[58:30] wrong let let's now focus on ourselves
[58:33] and see what's going on with our right
[58:38] side are we together so instead of
[58:41] claiming the power and showing the power
[58:45] a lot of Believers are becoming what
[58:49] judges judges you're just seeing the
[58:52] church trying to find something that's
[58:54] wrong
[58:56] that's wrong you know just you just
[58:58] waiting for something that way you'll
[58:59] see a lot of Believers nowadays they are
[59:02] very quick like to to decide if they're
[59:04] going to stay home oh I saw in that
[59:06] church doing this I don't think that's
[59:08] right I will never go back
[59:11] there well we we can just tell the
[59:15] spirits that is behind that because if
[59:18] you have love you can know how to
[59:21] correct the wrong thing that you saw but
[59:23] you cannot correct
[59:25] cuz you have no love and you think that
[59:28] you have love oh I'm going to just stay
[59:30] home I can't go back
[59:32] there are we
[59:34] together and you
[59:37] develop those funny feelings against
[59:41] brothers because you couldn't correct
[59:43] them and you didn't correct them cuz you
[59:46] to begin with you're not a
[59:49] Believer brother said that's hard yeah
[59:53] if you were a Believer you would have
[59:54] have corrected the wrong thing that you
[59:57] saw and stay with the brothers because
[1:00:01] nowhere in the message the prophet of
[1:00:03] God said when you saw something wrong
[1:00:05] leave the church no there is no quat
[1:00:08] that says
[1:00:09] so when you see something wrong leave
[1:00:12] the church no pray for them pray for
[1:00:16] them and for you to pray for somebody
[1:00:19] you need to love that person first you
[1:00:22] cannot pray for somebody that you don't
[1:00:23] love before praying love has to be there
[1:00:28] are we
[1:00:30] together maybe this is hard I don't know
[1:00:33] the Lord but it's the word of God
[1:00:38] Amen so the prophet of God he explain us
[1:00:42] why we don't see this power
[1:00:45] today and I know that someone is curious
[1:00:47] to know why we don't see that
[1:00:50] today as if the gospel that we received
[1:00:53] is in words no it was not inwards only
[1:00:56] we see what the prophet God has done
[1:00:59] wonders Miracles he preached and there's
[1:01:01] some wonders big Miracles that happened
[1:01:04] we together so you want to know why we
[1:01:07] don't see that
[1:01:08] today who is curious to
[1:01:12] know oh okay so we can read
[1:01:16] this in the
[1:01:18] message as the eagle STS her nest that
[1:01:22] he preached January 22nd 19
[1:01:25] 61 he
[1:01:27] says
[1:01:28] and that's
[1:01:32] and that's what's the matter with the
[1:01:34] church
[1:01:35] today that's what the matter with the
[1:01:38] church today it's need a goodness Turing
[1:01:43] to get some of the loose feathers out of
[1:01:46] it out of its wings packing a chip on
[1:01:50] your shoulders and gages and things like
[1:01:53] that you will die in the
[1:01:58] flight how can God ever have a church
[1:02:03] with signs and wonders and miracles when
[1:02:07] you are fussing one
[1:02:10] another I'm this I'm that and grud
[1:02:14] grudges oh my
[1:02:16] God if the prophet say this it means
[1:02:20] some people they have
[1:02:23] grudges Lord
[1:02:25] and the prop says gud gudes like in the
[1:02:30] plural
[1:02:33] form says Gres and everything f up till
[1:02:39] the Holy Ghost come down like a rushing
[1:02:41] wind find all the differences in
[1:02:44] denominationalism all the little old
[1:02:46] loose feathers I'm this I'm that you are
[1:02:50] nothing that you ought to be what the
[1:02:52] scripture said find out all the loose
[1:02:56] feeds get them all tightened up because
[1:03:00] she's going to take them on a real ride
[1:03:02] pretty soon a solo oh my that solo
[1:03:07] flight the first one then she finds all
[1:03:10] the feathers out and the nest just boils
[1:03:13] like that the loose feathers are flying
[1:03:18] everywhere get all the fils flying out
[1:03:22] so they get good tight ones in here in
[1:03:25] there and she examines them over and see
[1:03:29] if they are ready that's what God trying
[1:03:32] to do to his church
[1:03:34] now just can't get her
[1:03:40] ready them fethers just keep getting
[1:03:43] lose the prophet says he can't get her
[1:03:46] church ready because them feathers your
[1:03:51] grudges your funny feelings keep coming
[1:03:55] all the
[1:03:56] time and then you wonder why the Rapture
[1:03:59] is not
[1:04:00] happening you the one you are the
[1:04:05] cause because of your grudges evil
[1:04:08] feelings all the time you're not happy
[1:04:10] you don't like
[1:04:13] people God cannot get his church
[1:04:17] ready because of your feathers your
[1:04:21] loose
[1:04:23] feathers
[1:04:27] such Court have very very few
[1:04:31] amen he says you need some more
[1:04:35] spiritual vitamins to tighten to tighten
[1:04:38] up some Eagle
[1:04:41] vitamins and that's the
[1:04:45] word tighten up them feathers are we
[1:04:51] together that's what matters with the
[1:04:54] church
[1:04:56] today people they have all kind of loose
[1:04:59] feathers in the
[1:05:01] church and when it's hard to demonstrate
[1:05:04] the power of God when you have these
[1:05:06] loose feathers you cannot even
[1:05:08] demonstrate the power of God you will
[1:05:11] just belong to the church but not
[1:05:13] contributing to that
[1:05:16] church you will just be called one of
[1:05:19] them but you're not doing nothing to the
[1:05:23] group
[1:05:24] because you have loose
[1:05:29] feathers can I add one
[1:05:32] more the prophet of God when he gave
[1:05:36] back sight to that man in India all of
[1:05:39] them
[1:05:40] confession they were
[1:05:43] baptized are we together and here's why
[1:05:46] he says in the message thirsting for
[1:05:49] life that he preached um June 13th uh
[1:05:53] 1959
[1:05:55] he says Don't Be
[1:05:57] Afraid Don't Be Afraid our God is God
[1:06:01] paragraph 35 our God is God if he ever
[1:06:04] was God he's God yet and if he's God at
[1:06:09] all he's God of the whole creation and
[1:06:13] so when saying that then said uh they
[1:06:16] won't say nothing and I can't but God
[1:06:18] has showed that he uh that this will be
[1:06:22] now we'll see if it happens and they bow
[1:06:24] their heads uh this was right there in
[1:06:27] India and when we prayed the Man's eyes
[1:06:31] come open could see as good as any
[1:06:34] person here oh I said how many of you
[1:06:39] will receive Jesus Christ as your
[1:06:41] personal savior if this man's eyes come
[1:06:46] open and just as far as you could see
[1:06:49] tens of thousand of hands up in the air
[1:06:54] and then here is another problem with no
[1:06:59] cooperation amongst the churches perhaps
[1:07:03] tonight 99 out of every th out of every
[1:07:08] thousand is back in the temples of
[1:07:11] Buddha and so
[1:07:13] forth why because of the lack of
[1:07:18] cooperation of men to get there and Lead
[1:07:21] those people on into the churches
[1:07:25] listen this it's a Pity that there is no
[1:07:30] cooperation among Christian
[1:07:33] people today when God tries to do
[1:07:37] something that's the hardest thing I
[1:07:41] found and the most misunderstanding
[1:07:44] thing that people will not cooperate
[1:07:46] because you are uh you are not of their
[1:07:50] denomination he says it's a
[1:07:52] disgrace to the
[1:07:55] world Christians don't cooperate instead
[1:07:58] of cooperating they are fighting each
[1:08:01] other message believers they don't
[1:08:04] cooperate instead of
[1:08:06] cooperating they're just arguing over
[1:08:10] Cotes oh I think that's called no that's
[1:08:13] before 1966 63 oh no that's when when is
[1:08:18] that what is the year of that quote
[1:08:19] after reading a quote to a brother he
[1:08:21] need to know what is the year does the
[1:08:24] year
[1:08:26] matter when we read the Bible when we
[1:08:29] open the book of The First Kings we
[1:08:32] don't ask what is the
[1:08:35] ear why when it comes to the message you
[1:08:38] need to know the
[1:08:40] ear because the word of God is the same
[1:08:44] it's not about the ear it's about the
[1:08:48] content if you believe what the content
[1:08:51] says Say Amen yeah oh I can't and that's
[1:08:56] the
[1:08:57] the lack of cooperation that is going on
[1:09:00] in the in in the message world oh they
[1:09:03] don't believe it they don't believe he
[1:09:04] came they don't believe if he came what
[1:09:06] is he doing in your life yeah we needs
[1:09:09] to see physical tangible proof than just
[1:09:14] arguments put together and I always tell
[1:09:17] people no matter how hard and how
[1:09:21] sincere your Revelation can be
[1:09:24] if that Revelation develop in your
[1:09:26] heart's hatred against other people it's
[1:09:30] a wrong
[1:09:32] Revelation that's even if they don't
[1:09:34] agree with you keep loving
[1:09:37] them even if they refuse what your
[1:09:40] saying keep loving
[1:09:43] them are we together you keep loving
[1:09:46] them oh they have criticized me they say
[1:09:49] this to uh uh to to my subjects they've
[1:09:52] been against me yeah but keep loving
[1:09:58] them this is hard oh maybe bar you never
[1:10:01] been in a situation keep loving
[1:10:05] them before you tell us your story love
[1:10:08] them first before you tell us what they
[1:10:11] said against you love them first are we
[1:10:16] together because there is no Revelation
[1:10:19] that goes with
[1:10:20] hatred you have a right spirit
[1:10:24] love
[1:10:25] them love
[1:10:28] them because this is one thing that the
[1:10:30] prophet had he loved everybody all these
[1:10:33] Pentecostals they were criticizing him
[1:10:36] they were against him but he loved
[1:10:38] them and he said if you make a cycle and
[1:10:42] you exclude me I will make a bigger one
[1:10:44] and include you but today Brothers don't
[1:10:48] say so if you SCH oh I'm gone I'm gone I
[1:10:53] don't want to be in trouble I'm gone oh
[1:10:54] I don't like that can you just say like
[1:10:57] the prophet I will make a bigger one and
[1:10:59] include you cuz you are my brother are
[1:11:02] we
[1:11:03] together let me read this quote here oh
[1:11:08] my I have 10 more minutes I can read two
[1:11:13] quotes in a
[1:11:16] message in the message I read this quote
[1:11:19] to Brothers
[1:11:20] yesterday in the prayer meeting
[1:11:24] what is that in your hand that he
[1:11:26] preached on November 20th uh 1955
[1:11:29] paragraph
[1:11:30] 51 he says notice him now he is a new
[1:11:36] man here he goes and now how and now how
[1:11:41] the world will criticize you when you do
[1:11:45] this don't expect a flower bed of
[1:11:49] easy
[1:11:51] because a lot of people today they just
[1:11:54] want to be along people you know who
[1:11:56] love them who speak good about them you
[1:11:59] know people who are just nice to them
[1:12:03] but the prophet says don't expect a
[1:12:05] flower bed of
[1:12:07] easy if everybody talked good about me
[1:12:12] and everything went fine didn't have any
[1:12:16] troubles and
[1:12:18] trials I will go back to the altar see
[1:12:21] see the reason why the prophet will go
[1:12:22] back to the altar
[1:12:24] like why is everything going fine in my
[1:12:28] life why nobody's against me why
[1:12:32] everybody speaking good about me the
[1:12:35] prophet says I will now praise the Lord
[1:12:39] because most of us that what we do when
[1:12:41] everything is okay oh brother Isel this
[1:12:43] year was the best no problem no trials
[1:12:46] all is well you are wrong that's right
[1:12:49] you shouldn't do that if you did that
[1:12:52] this year don't do it again
[1:12:54] if you see everything going well no
[1:12:57] trials no sickness no troubles the
[1:12:59] prophet says I will go to the
[1:13:01] [Applause]
[1:13:03] altar I will go cuz it's not
[1:13:07] possible I will go to the Altar and say
[1:13:10] Lord what's the matter here what's the
[1:13:15] prophet is asking what's the matter
[1:13:17] because everything's going
[1:13:20] well but most of us we ask what matter
[1:13:23] where things are not going well so we're
[1:13:26] doing just the
[1:13:27] opposite that's
[1:13:31] right that's that's a big problem
[1:13:34] yeah and many people be like when
[1:13:37] everything is going well brother say yes
[1:13:39] that what the prophet said and this is
[1:13:42] his own experience in his
[1:13:45] life because most of the time we we we
[1:13:48] love to be praised you know but we we
[1:13:50] need to be
[1:13:52] challenged the devil will come after you
[1:13:54] as long as you're still alive and if you
[1:13:57] are born of God you will see the devil
[1:13:59] all the time you will see if you're born
[1:14:02] of God because you have a certain power
[1:14:04] and all the time he's needing to to
[1:14:06] fight against that power that's right he
[1:14:09] will come after you but when you see
[1:14:12] everything go
[1:14:13] smoothly nicely the prophet says come to
[1:14:17] the Altar and ask Lord what's going
[1:14:21] on are we together he says uh I I'll say
[1:14:26] what's the matter here there is
[1:14:28] something
[1:14:31] wrong so there is something wrong when
[1:14:34] all is
[1:14:35] well this is the question when all is
[1:14:39] well in your life there is something
[1:14:41] wrong this is hard brother Israel what
[1:14:44] kind of equation brother BR yes
[1:14:46] according to the prophets when all is
[1:14:48] well something is
[1:14:51] wrong because how come the devil is he
[1:14:55] afraid of you why is he no longer you
[1:14:58] know uh chasing you what's going on
[1:15:00] there is something
[1:15:01] wrong why brother Bram he says for all
[1:15:06] that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall
[1:15:10] suffer uh all that live Godly in Christ
[1:15:14] Jesus shall suffer
[1:15:18] persecution so when you don't see
[1:15:20] persecution come to the altar yes said
[1:15:24] Lord you know uh who's going to do this
[1:15:26] prayer I I don't know people are just
[1:15:28] looking at me but I don't know who's
[1:15:30] going to make this prayer like Lord all
[1:15:32] is well what's
[1:15:38] wrong he says when everybody talk good
[1:15:41] about me why so much
[1:15:45] clappings why are people happy about me
[1:15:48] why is everything going well what's
[1:15:51] going on are we together
[1:15:54] what's going on I need to
[1:15:58] know let me finish with this quote here
[1:16:01] in a message uh raising J's daughter
[1:16:05] that he preached on July 31st
[1:16:09] 1956 paragraph 56 he says where your
[1:16:13] faith lays wherever you
[1:16:17] believe it's according to your faith
[1:16:21] jerus was come lay your hands on my girl
[1:16:25] she will be all right you just lay your
[1:16:28] hands on her here he come they was going
[1:16:32] on a little drive his heart go settled
[1:16:35] down walked alongside of Jesus with his
[1:16:38] head up oh I'm so glad I made my
[1:16:42] decision Lord don't
[1:16:44] worry soon as you make your
[1:16:47] decision the devil's going to give you a
[1:16:53] a
[1:16:56] shock oh this was a nice Revival meeting
[1:16:59] yeah I got the Holy Ghost as soon as you
[1:17:01] start saying so the devil will give you
[1:17:05] a
[1:17:06] shock and you know he has different kind
[1:17:09] of shocks you know the shock that he
[1:17:11] will give me it's not the one that he
[1:17:12] will give you it's not the one he give
[1:17:14] to Levi he has all kind of shes right
[1:17:18] you see so this quot goes together goes
[1:17:20] along with the other one when I
[1:17:23] everything going well something is wrong
[1:17:26] be because the devil is there to send
[1:17:30] his
[1:17:31] ches as soon as you make your decision
[1:17:34] let me follow the lord and some of us
[1:17:36] will see that the time when you decided
[1:17:38] to follow the message you had troubles
[1:17:41] that you never had when you were in the
[1:17:43] world as the as long as you start
[1:17:46] looking for the Holy Ghost and you start
[1:17:48] proclaiming that you got a holy ghost
[1:17:51] you'll start saying things that you you
[1:17:53] never saw before new kind of problems
[1:17:56] new kind of Trials because that's why
[1:18:00] the devil is there to give you a
[1:18:03] shock are we together he said the devil
[1:18:07] will give you a shock don't worry he is
[1:18:11] the biggest Bluff I know of but he's
[1:18:16] only but he's only a BL did you hear me
[1:18:20] he's a BL that's all he is
[1:18:23] he anger one legal power Jesus Christ
[1:18:28] stripped him of everything he had on
[1:18:30] Calvary right the fullen penalty was
[1:18:34] paid at Calvary and the devil has no
[1:18:37] legal rights at all he's just a big
[1:18:41] Bluff and as he's a big Bluff he knows
[1:18:44] how to give
[1:18:46] shocks he knows how to scare you he
[1:18:49] knows how to give you shocks and you
[1:18:51] feel really I'm shock ched because the
[1:18:55] big BL one gave you that
[1:18:58] choke and that will develop your prayer
[1:19:01] lives you will add more hours to your
[1:19:05] prayer time are we together because what
[1:19:08] all goes well we don't pray is brother

[1:19:16] the weather no I don't think I can go to
[1:19:18] church oh I can't make it this this

[1:19:28] see the head of God you don't look at
[1:19:31] the
[1:19:32] weather you don't look outside before

[1:23:34] I than I've ever been there's anybody I
[1:23:37] might not be the most talented or the
[1:23:39] most gifted or the most qualified but I

[1:23:44] sincere with what the Lord has given me
[1:23:46] amen amen we can
[1:23:49] really pray like we never prayed before

[1:23:55] to get give me the energy you know
[1:23:57] sometimes I wake up I have a lot of
[1:23:59] energy for this and that and ask the
[1:24:02] Lord to give me energy and strength so I
[1:24:05] could serve him better amen and so
[1:24:08] that's one of my prayers this year we've
[1:24:10] been going a bit um with the little uh
[1:24:15] the little group of Believers there in
[1:24:16] Phoenix with Brother Art and there's a
[1:24:19] Thursday night service we'll have with
[1:24:21] them
[1:24:23] and they stream this service Sunday
[1:24:25] morning and Sunday nights until the Lord
[1:24:29] uh shows something different and um
[1:24:34] but I wouldn't take nothing from our
[1:24:36] journey now and I don't want
[1:24:40] to
[1:24:42] um rust out I want to wear out I want to
[1:24:46] put all my time in the word of the Lord
[1:24:49] amen I'm still a young man I'm I'm very
[1:24:52] young I got a lot of strength I got a
[1:24:54] lot of you know say brother that's long
[1:24:57] that's you know you're really going to
[1:24:59] oh what what we got so I'll rest on the
[1:25:03] other side how about that you and I will
[1:25:05] rest on the other side when is it time
[1:25:07] to work today today the time to work
[1:25:11] amen so God bless you uh we appreciate
[1:25:14] brother Bonza coming and sharing those
[1:25:16] words with us amen and and we're coming
[1:25:21] to the table of the Lord here tonight
[1:25:24] which is a very sweet service it's it's
[1:25:26] nice to be able to remind it's always a
[1:25:31] showdown you want to make sure things
[1:25:32] are right in your life and that you
[1:25:35] don't have
[1:25:36] any loose feathers loose sins hanging on
[1:25:41] there and uh it can happen so easily
[1:25:44] where you can develop the wrong uh
[1:25:47] perspective or attitude and but the
[1:25:50] communion service seems to help us those
[1:25:52] that take it seriously seem to help us
[1:25:54] to not to you know let things go on
[1:25:58] that's not right that's not correct and
[1:26:00] so we want to be honest and faithful and
[1:26:04] and honest with all men I don't want to
[1:26:07] be a gr have a grudge against nobody I
[1:26:11] don't want to feel a funny feeling
[1:26:12] towards anyone any group any church
[1:26:16] anybody amen we the Bible says with if
[1:26:21] possible all that life within you live
[1:26:23] peaceably with all men and that's our
[1:26:27] desire and we can do that without
[1:26:28] compromising I believe Amen in 1
[1:26:31] Corinthians chapter 11 and verse number
[1:26:36] 23 we prepare to go
[1:26:40] here the scripture says thank you just
[1:26:43] saw that thank
[1:26:49] you I've received of the Lord that which
[1:26:53] also I delivered unto you that the Lord
[1:26:55] Jesus the same night in which he was
[1:26:59] betrayed he took bread and when he had
[1:27:02] given thanks he broke it and said take
[1:27:06] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:27:10] you this do in remembrance of me after
[1:27:14] the same manner also he took the cup and

[1:27:22] of as you drink it in the remembrance of
[1:27:25] me for as often as you eat this bread
[1:27:28] and drink this cup you do show the
[1:27:30] Lord's death till he come wherefore
[1:27:33] whosoever should eat this bread and
[1:27:35] drink this cup of the Lord unworthily
[1:27:38] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:27:40] the Lord but let a man examine himself
[1:27:43] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:27:44] drink of that cup for he that eateth and
[1:27:47] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[1:27:50] Damnation to himself not Discerning the

[1:27:56] and sickly among you and many sleep for
[1:27:59] if we would judge ourselves we should
