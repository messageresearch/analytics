[13:27] all [singing] my fears
[13:34] and [music and singing]
[13:35] it dries all [music]
[13:39] my tears.
[13:42] The blood [music and singing] that gives
[13:45] me strength
[13:47] from day
[13:49] [singing]
[13:50] to day. [music]
[13:53] It will never [singing]
[13:56] lose [music]
[13:58] its power.
[14:01] [singing]
[14:02] [music]
[14:03] for it reaches
[14:06] [music] to the highest
[14:10] mountain
[14:12] [singing and music]
[14:15] and it flows

[15:27] never

[15:31] It [singing and music] will never
[15:35] lose

[15:40] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[15:44] &gt;&gt; When I think about the Lord,

[19:17] &gt;&gt; It makes me want to shout
[19:21] halleluah. [singing]
[19:24] Thank you, [music] Jesus.
[19:26] Lord, you're worthy of all
[19:29] [singing and music] of the glory and all
[19:31] of the honor and all of the praise.
[19:37] It makes [singing and music] me want to
[19:39] shout.
[19:45] Amen. Let's just lift our hands and
[19:47] praise the Lord. Give him praise and
[19:50] thank him for his goodness, his mercy to
[19:53] us. Father, we thank you for your grace,

[20:27] tonight. I'm so happy to be in the house
[20:29] [music] of the Lord with you. We're
[20:31] going to listen to the message.
[20:32] believest thou this? Brother Brandon
[20:35] preached that in 1960
[20:38] and [music] um he'll be taking his
[20:40] scripture in St. John chapter 11 if
[20:43] you'd like to prepare to go there.
[20:45] Believest thou this. How many's happy to

[20:52] you. God bless you. You that were
[20:54] traveling and each of you God bless you

[21:04] to service
[21:06] to the prophet of God. Amen.
[21:10] Only
[21:12] believe. [singing and music]
[21:15] Only
[21:17] believe [music]
[21:20] that all things are possible.
[21:27] Only
[21:29] believe.
[21:32] Only
[21:34] believe.
[21:38] Ally [singing]
[21:40] believe. [music]
[21:44] All things [singing] are [music]
[21:46] possible.
[21:49] Only [singing]
[21:52] Lord I believe.
[21:54] And Lord,
[21:57] I believe. That's my testimony tonight.
[21:59] [music]
[22:01] Amen. I believe [singing]
[22:06] that all things [music]
[22:08] are possible. [singing]
[22:12] Lord, I believe.
[22:18] Lord,
[22:20] I believe. [singing and music]
[22:23] Lord,
[22:25] I believe [singing]
[22:29] all things are possible.
[22:35] Lord, I believe. [music]
[22:39] I bless you. You may be seated, Brother
[22:40] Brandham.
[22:45] And before we pray, I would like to say
[22:48] this that
[22:50] last evening, I believe it was, I said
[22:53] to a lady, if you'll just do as we're
[22:56] instructed to do, that would the baby
[23:00] with a water head, it would shrink. And
[23:03] the baby's head shrunk last night 1/2
[23:06] inch by measure of a string. So the lady
[23:10] brought it here now. I the reason I did
[23:14] that, sister, is for a purpose. See, if
[23:17] you can see something tangible happen,
[23:20] that'll make your faith increase to keep
[23:22] believing it. Sometimes I do that just
[23:25] maybe like ask the person to get up,
[23:27] make a step or two, move your hand,
[23:29] wiggle your finger, just something that
[23:31] they can do different just to let them
[23:33] see that it's all all right. They just
[23:35] get nervous and think it isn't going to
[23:37] happen, but it's happening all the time.
[23:39] See, it has to. How many wants to be
[23:42] remembered in prayer now? Would you just
[23:43] raise your hands and say, "Lord, grant
[23:46] it." Let us bow our heads.
[23:50] Lord, as we hear this grand old hymn of
[23:53] the church wrote by my precious friend
[23:56] Paul Rder, only believe.
[24:00] We are thinking now of a boy was brought
[24:03] by his fathers to the disciples no more
[24:06] than 10 days after Jesus had given them
[24:09] power to cast out devils and heal the
[24:12] sick and here they was completely
[24:14] defeated on an epileptic case
[24:17] and they seen our Lord coming
[24:22] and the father ran and said Lord have
[24:25] mercy on us. My son is vierously vexed
[24:29] with the devil
[24:31] and I brought him to your disciples and
[24:33] they could not cure him. Jesus said, I
[24:37] can if you believe. Only believe. Oh
[24:42] God, you haven't changed a bit since
[24:44] then. You're just the same loving,
[24:49] sweet, and compassionate God as you were
[24:52] then. So are you today. And Lord, like
[24:55] that Father, we all cry, "Lord, help
[24:58] thou our unbelief." It's so simple, we
[25:01] just stumble over it. Father, we want to
[25:04] offer youth thanks and praise for
[25:08] touching that little baby last night to
[25:10] see that that skull that's been swollen,
[25:15] that is, that the bone has pushed out,
[25:18] it went down a half an inch last night.
[25:21] We're grateful for that, Father. when we
[25:24] know what our doctors has nothing in the
[25:26] research for. There's nothing that they
[25:29] can do for it. But thou art still God,
[25:31] the master of all situations.
[25:34] &gt;&gt; We thank thee, Father. We thank thee for
[25:36] this mother's loyalty and sweetness and
[25:39] obedience to bring back the string and
[25:41] pasted on this piece of paper here to
[25:44] show to the public her testimony for the
[25:47] glory of God. May her little one live
[25:49] and be a normal child for your glory.
[25:52] Look at all those hands that went up,
[25:54] Father. Each of them had a need. Mine up
[25:57] too, Father. I have need. And here's
[26:00] many here in the form of letter or in
[26:04] this box that's needy. People who are
[26:07] really needy. Let it come to pass, Lord,
[26:10] that each will receive their request
[26:12] this night. May they take this mother's
[26:15] testimony and just as an example to show
[26:19] that when you say anything, it's
[26:21] finished. It's all we have to do is to
[26:24] receive it and act upon it. It's a
[26:27] finished work. Grant Lord, that each one
[26:29] of these letters and these handkerches,
[26:31] the people that they're laid up on, may
[26:33] they be healed. Everyone that raise
[26:35] their hands, Father, they may receive
[26:37] their heart's desire. We ask that in
[26:40] Jesus name. Amen.
[26:43] Can you be seated?
[26:49] &gt;&gt; I just wanted to show you the string
[26:50] here that the lady
[26:56] that the little baby's head did shrink
[26:58] as the Lord promised us through the Holy
[27:01] Spirit last night. Isn't he wonderful?
[27:04] So gives us so much courage to have
[27:08] faith and believe.
[27:10] Now when Jesus said to that tree in Mark
[27:14] 11:23,
[27:17] "No man eateth from thee from
[27:19] henceforth," he might not have yelled
[27:21] out. Why, frankly, he was sus about it
[27:25] till his disciples just I think one of
[27:28] them heard him. And um it uh when that
[27:32] epileptic uh when it come up before the
[27:35] Lord Jesus, the boy had the hardest fit
[27:37] he ever had. perhaps fell on the ground
[27:39] like he was dead, but he realized that
[27:41] he met someone who had faith far above
[27:44] those apostles. Now, I'd like for
[27:46] someone who didn't believe in divine
[27:48] healing to watch this. Jesus had given
[27:50] them power to cast the spirits out and
[27:54] they had failed. Not the power had
[27:56] failed, but they had failed. Jesus told
[27:58] him, "Why could we not cast him out?" He
[28:00] said, "Because of your unbelief." The
[28:02] church still has the power. God's never
[28:05] taken his power from the church, but the
[28:07] church don't have faith enough to act
[28:09] upon it. That's all. It's just that
[28:11] simple. We try to make it so complicated
[28:14] sometimes, but the more simple you make
[28:17] the gospel, the more reality you'll
[28:19] have. When you just get real simple with
[28:21] it, God said so. That settles it. That's
[28:24] all. And just believe it. Go ahead. When
[28:26] Jesus said, "No man eateth from me."
[28:29] While the leaves are just as pretty and
[28:31] bright as they ever was, the bark look
[28:33] the same. But way down beneath the
[28:35] ground and those roots, the life begin
[28:37] to dwindle away. So is it upon a cancer,
[28:40] upon any kind of disease that that you
[28:42] might want to think when you can accept
[28:46] God's word down deep in the roots, the
[28:49] cancer may be there, your hand may be
[28:51] just as stiff. That don't have anything
[28:52] to do with divine healing. It's if thou
[28:55] canst believe. See, way down somewhere,
[28:58] it's already gone to work. Jesus said,
[29:00] "If you say to this mountain, be moved
[29:03] and don't doubt in your heart, but
[29:05] believe that what you said will come to
[29:07] pass. You can have what you've said."
[29:09] Isn't that lovely? Who'd that come from?
[29:12] The son of God whose words heavens and
[29:15] earth will pass away. But now, but his
[29:18] words won. Now, the only way that you
[29:20] can do that, you've got to have the
[29:21] right objective and the right motive.
[29:24] Now, if I went out here and said, I'll
[29:26] show you I can move this mountain, be
[29:28] move mountain, it would never move.
[29:30] Certainly not. No matter what I had,
[29:33] it's got to be first. You've got to find
[29:35] the will of God.
[29:37] That's the reason usually in the prayer
[29:39] lines I I get the very hardest is
[29:41] because it's something that's went
[29:42] through lines and so forth, and that's
[29:44] where you get it back. But see, if
[29:47] you've got unconfessed sin, do you ever
[29:49] notice on a case before I asked the evil
[29:51] spirit to leave? I watched that case
[29:54] real sure to be certain that there's
[29:56] nothing in that life that would hinder
[29:58] anything. See, because remember on these
[30:01] gifts, you can get in trouble with them.
[30:03] God, you remember one time gave a
[30:05] prophet, made a prophet out of a man,
[30:08] Moses, and told him to go down and speak
[30:10] to the rock and the prophet is all
[30:11] excited and went out and smoked the
[30:13] rock, speaking of the weakness of Christ
[30:16] that he'd have to die the second time or
[30:18] be smitten the second time. He had power
[30:20] to bring it, but it wasn't the will of
[30:22] God. I never could believe that it was
[30:24] God's will for Elijah to go around cause
[30:28] them children or teasing him about being
[30:30] baldheaded. I don't think he should have
[30:32] did that, but he was a prophet and was
[30:34] angered and he put a curse on those
[30:36] children and two she bears killed 42
[30:38] little innocent children. But I don't
[30:41] believe he should have done that. And
[30:42] it's just just we God I believe today
[30:46] before he puts his church in power, he
[30:48] tries his church to see what it will do.
[30:50] Yes,
[30:51] &gt;&gt; we um next time maybe the Lord willing
[30:53] when I come back we have time to dwell
[30:55] on something like that on something it's
[30:57] fixing to happen and then we'll know
[30:59] more about it then but if you'll just
[31:02] speak the word say Lord I believe it
[31:06] don't doubt mean it in your heart now
[31:09] say for instance I was in a valley and I
[31:12] don't I'm preaching to millions of
[31:14] people but just across the mountain
[31:16] there is a group of people of 100 and
[31:19] there are dying dying without knowing
[31:21] Christ. Well, I've got a million here to
[31:23] preach to. But yet, something in my
[31:25] heart's telling me, "Get across to those
[31:27] people. Get to them. They're perishing.
[31:30] I don't want to go myself." But yet,
[31:32] there's something in me. See, that's God
[31:35] then moving. See what the objective is.
[31:38] See what the motive is of going. Not for
[31:40] self. Now, if I say, "Well, if if uh my
[31:44] objective is right to get over there,
[31:47] but then I get up there and here's a big
[31:48] mountain." I say, you know, if I get
[31:50] over that mountain and save all those
[31:52] hundred people, someday they'll have a
[31:54] statue there. Brother Brandon, I'm a
[31:55] great missionary. Now, my motive is not
[31:57] right. The mountain won't fall. No, sir.
[32:00] But when my motive and objective is
[32:03] right and God in my heart is leading me
[32:05] and I can't get over the mountain,
[32:07] around the mountain, under the mountain,
[32:09] I'd say mountain move. Maybe when I say
[32:13] that, no more than I say it with that
[32:16] kind of a right spirit led of the Holy
[32:19] Spirit in the will of God, there might
[32:21] not be but one little spoonful of that
[32:23] mountain dropped down, but it's on its
[32:26] own. The next day there may be a two
[32:28] pounds fall. The next day, a quarter of
[32:31] a ton and maybe in a month five ton
[32:35] drops in. What of it? May not even see
[32:37] it yet, but she's moving on its road.
[32:40] I'll stay right there and watch the
[32:41] thing be done because God said so and
[32:44] that just settles you.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Can you think that about your mother
[32:47] there tonight?
[32:49] &gt;&gt; All right. If you'll think it, she'll
[32:50] get well. All right. That's if you just
[32:52] believe it. Just speak the word and stay
[32:55] with it. See, just believe it. Hang on
[32:57] to it. It's eternal life. Now,
[33:01] tomorrow afternoon,
[33:03] I told Billy uh tonight just to omit the
[33:07] prayer cards. And I want to speak. I'm
[33:11] confessing in truth. I've been going
[33:12] since January overseas and back in
[33:15] Phoenix, right home, back and all
[33:17] completely that discernment that I am so
[33:20] weak. I hardly know where I'm standing
[33:22] at times. It just about got me whipped
[33:24] out. Now I have to leave and they you
[33:28] you brethren invited me to stay over for
[33:31] some more days. How I appreciate that. I
[33:34] certainly think that this is a wonderful
[33:36] bunch of ministers here. Wish we could
[33:38] have had a little more time for
[33:40] fellowship if the Lord willing, I'll be
[33:42] back sometime. Nothing else, just go
[33:44] from one church to the other and wind
[33:46] around through the city and visit you
[33:47] all. I'd be glad to do that. Anything
[33:49] that I could do to help the kingdom of
[33:51] God, that is if you'd want me to do it
[33:53] and to come back sometime and join up
[33:55] with us and have a nice good meeting
[33:57] somewhere. And remember, brethren, I'll
[34:00] be praying for you. That's one thing.
[34:01] Sure. And I want you all to pray for me,
[34:03] all of you. And now uh um
[34:08] tomorrow morning is a church services.
[34:11] All these different fine churches around
[34:13] the city. Now some of the groups from
[34:16] Jeffersonville is here. Some of my
[34:18] friends, one of my trustees of the
[34:20] church is here. Brother Fred Sman, I've
[34:22] never been able to see him in the
[34:23] meeting. And brother all many other my
[34:26] friends from up there at Jeffersonville,
[34:28] my p my secretary there and all is here
[34:32] somewhere in the meeting. I haven't seen
[34:34] them yet. And brethren, there's some
[34:36] fine churches here in this city. And all
[34:38] the rest of you visitors, find one of
[34:40] them and go to these churches tomorrow.
[34:42] They'll do you good. I'm sure there are
[34:45] brethren who believe in this kind of a
[34:48] ministry. That's the reason you're here
[34:49] sitting on the platform and down in the
[34:52] places here because they believe in it.
[34:55] And I appreciate those men. Lord bless
[34:57] this full gospel businessman's chapter
[35:00] here who who sponsored this meeting or I
[35:03] believe that was right sponsored the
[35:05] meeting. I I go a lot of their sponsors
[35:08] because in there we oughten to be this
[35:10] way but many times brethren let's little
[35:14] bitty differences like a man believe a
[35:16] little something another little
[35:17] something it kind of makes a little
[35:18] friction and oh sore some way back it
[35:21] ought to be healed up by this time but
[35:23] it it and if you I get the full gospel
[35:25] business man then that kind of helps
[35:27] bind it up and we get together and we
[35:30] have real fellowship together
[35:32] &gt;&gt; just real good times and we appreciate
[35:34] that. God blessed that chapter. I
[35:36] believe the Lord raised it up for a
[35:37] purpose. Now,
[35:41] and then I had the grand privilege of
[35:42] seeing bro, brother or Robert's place
[35:45] the other day, and my such a mammoth
[35:47] place. Such a beautiful thing. It's it's
[35:50] a memorial to Pentecost. Then I went
[35:52] over to brother Tommy Osburn's another
[35:54] wonderful place, wonderful man of God
[35:57] who brother Tommy and I are just close
[36:00] and brother oral too. just real close
[36:02] brothers and we love one another and
[36:04] trying our best to work everything that
[36:06] we can for the good of the people in the
[36:08] kingdom of God. So I certainly
[36:10] appreciate those men being here in this
[36:12] city among the rest of these fine men
[36:15] you've got you sheep have got wonderful
[36:17] shepherds I'll say it like that. May the
[36:20] Lord continue to be with you all is my
[36:22] prayer. And now tomorrow afternoon uh
[36:26] what time does the service start,
[36:27] brethren? 2:30.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; 2:30. Let's say 1 1 or 1:30. he ought to
[36:31] be here so they won't interrupt with the
[36:32] rest of the services. Now, if the boys
[36:35] hasn't already told you tonight, uh they
[36:38] have some books, pictures, and so forth,
[36:41] and tapes and records of the meetings,
[36:43] and they sell them, but we will not let
[36:45] them sell them on the Sabbath tomorrow.
[36:48] No books or nothing to be sold tomorrow.
[36:50] So, we won't we never permitted that.
[36:53] Although many said, "You're awful
[36:54] wrong." And old Daddy Bosworth used to
[36:57] tell me, "Oh, brother Random, you're
[36:59] wrong there." But that's the way I feel.
[37:01] See, and I I feel if you want one, they
[37:04] give you one. But if you But uh we can't
[37:06] sell on on the Sabbath. No. And so I
[37:10] believe that I got to live it. Just I
[37:12] got to live with myself. You see, I got
[37:14] to live with my convictions. And so or
[37:17] you could stand home up the house up the
[37:20] place and get it. Now tonight,
[37:24] oh well, let's just all just forget that
[37:28] that there's any work to be done or
[37:30] anything else or the toils of the day.
[37:32] Let's just lay aside everything and look
[37:34] into the word for a few minutes and see
[37:36] what God would speak to us through his
[37:38] word. And may I pray that God will just
[37:41] give us an extremely great blessing
[37:43] tonight.
[37:45] Jean, could you kidnap her for me? Could
[37:48] you kidnap that little girl for me?
[37:50] Isn't she a pretty little thing? Would
[37:52] you like to go home with me and play
[37:53] with my little Sarah about this high?
[37:55] Oh, you would? Ah, I'd like for you to.
[37:57] She's just about your size. And she's
[38:00] daddy's little girl.
[38:03] I bet you love your daddy, too, don't
[38:05] you, mommy? Oh, sure you do. The
[38:07] prettiest little girl I'm sitting here
[38:08] looking at. Little eyes look like two
[38:10] burnt holes in the blanket and and
[38:12] little brown hair. I just love little
[38:15] children. I got two little girls at
[38:18] home. One of them is Rebecca and the
[38:21] other one is Sarah here some time ago
[38:24] eyes away. They're both daddy's little
[38:27] girls and I love them and as soon as I
[38:30] get in I got to give him a piggy back
[38:31] and only Becky's getting too big for it.
[38:34] She's big as I am. She'd break my back
[38:36] now. She But she still daddy's little
[38:40] girl anyhow. And now about another year
[38:42] we want to get her in Bible school
[38:43] somewhere and away from the public
[38:46] school. And then they was waiting up for
[38:50] daddy, you know, to come home. I've been
[38:51] out in the meeting and tomorrow night
[38:53] they'll be waiting until midnight for me
[38:56] to try to get in. And uh so I got in
[39:00] real early in the morning around 3 or
[39:02] 4:00 and mother come the door and let me
[39:06] in. And I was so tired and weary. I here
[39:09] on the platform uh when the anointed it
[39:12] feels fine. But when that once leaves
[39:15] you, that's where you get in trouble.
[39:17] How many ever knew that? Well, sure it
[39:19] is. Look, Elijah went up on the mountain
[39:22] and called fire out of heaven, called
[39:24] rain out of heaven. And then when the
[39:26] spirit left him, he wandered in the
[39:27] wilderness 40 days. And God found him
[39:29] pulled back in a cave somewhere. Jonah,
[39:31] he went out and stayed live in a belly
[39:33] of a whale for three days and nights.
[39:35] Was spit out upon the bank and went
[39:37] around preaching. The whole city
[39:39] repented and come to God. And when the
[39:41] anointing left him, he went up on top of
[39:42] the hill and asked God to take his life.
[39:44] See, I stand by the side of William
[39:47] Kapper's grave not long ago that wrote
[39:49] that famous hymn that we used at our
[39:51] communion service. There is a fountain
[39:53] filled with blood drawn from Emanuel's
[39:55] veins where sinners plunged beneath the
[39:57] flood. Did you ever hear what he
[40:00] happened to him? After inspiration left
[40:02] him from that, he tried to find the
[40:03] river to commit suicide.
[40:06] I live right across from the old
[40:07] Kentucky home and Stevens Foster gave
[40:10] America its most famous folk songs. And
[40:13] when he write get inspiration up that
[40:15] inspiration write a song then when he
[40:17] come out of it he go get on a drunk
[40:19] finally called a servant and cuff a
[40:20] razor and committed suicide. People
[40:22] don't know what those people that live
[40:24] in that spiritual realm go through. Now
[40:27] here you feel like you can move a
[40:28] mountain but just let the anointing drop
[40:31] from you and start through that door.
[40:32] Somebody ain't there to catch you. And
[40:34] then maybe for a few hours you hardly
[40:36] wonder where you're at. And then night
[40:38] after night that takes the best of you.
[40:41] And little I want to tell you about
[40:42] little Sarah and Rebecca. So the next
[40:45] morning I couldn't sleep and I got up
[40:47] was sitting in the chair and after a
[40:48] while Becky being the oldest she was had
[40:51] longer legs than Sarah. So uh Becky come
[40:55] running woke up jumped out of bed not
[40:57] waking her little sister up. Here she
[40:58] come through the house running as hard
[41:00] as she could. She's saying daddy daddy.
[41:02] I stuck out one of my legs and she
[41:04] jumped across there pretty well
[41:05] balanced. kind of like the the modern
[41:08] church, you know, it's been in the game
[41:10] for a long time, you know, for several
[41:12] hundred years. She could balance
[41:13] herself, right? Well, and she put her
[41:15] arms around me and said, "Oh, my daddy,
[41:17] my daddy." And little Sarah had in the
[41:20] commotion woke up. Well, I don't know
[41:22] whether your children does or not. Mine
[41:23] does. The younger one gets the
[41:25] hand-me-downs. And so Sarah had on
[41:28] Becky's pajamas, feet about that much
[41:30] too long, you know. Here she come.
[41:32] Little bitty shark fella falling,
[41:34] stumbling. And she got there a little
[41:36] late. So Becky turned around and said,
[41:38] "Sarah, my sister, I want to tell you
[41:42] something." She said, "I was here first
[41:45] and I have the monopoly. So I've got all
[41:49] of daddy and there's none left for you."
[41:54] That's the way some people try to think
[41:56] about religion, isn't it?
[41:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:59] And poor little Sarah, she dropped her
[42:02] little lip, her little black eyes,
[42:04] looked at me, and she started to cry.
[42:06] And Becky had her cheek against mine,
[42:07] hugging me. I love her. And Sarah
[42:10] started to walk away cuz Becky had all
[42:12] of daddy. I scooted the other knee out
[42:14] like this and motioned to her like that.
[42:16] Oh, she perked up right quick and run,
[42:18] jumped up on my knees. So, she hadn't
[42:22] been around very long and her legs
[42:23] wouldn't even reach the floor. She's
[42:25] kind of a little tottery perhaps like I
[42:28] am. just a little totter, you know, and
[42:31] she didn't uh couldn't reach the floor.
[42:32] She wasn't a big denomination, you know,
[42:34] and so she couldn't get out on the solid
[42:36] floor. She hadn't been around long
[42:38] enough. And so she was kind of tottering
[42:40] and I throwed both arms around her like
[42:42] this and hugged her up close to me and
[42:46] she sparkled those little black eyes and
[42:48] looked back to Rebecca. She said,
[42:50] "Rebecca, my sister," she
[42:54] said, "It may be true that you've got
[42:57] all of daddy, but I want you to know one
[42:59] thing. Daddy's got all of me."
[43:05] That's just so he's got all of me. I
[43:07] might not have the education if the big
[43:09] thing's over, but as long as I know he's
[43:11] got all of me in my toler.
[43:17] Well, let's offer another little word of
[43:19] prayer to him before we open up the
[43:21] word. Now, heavenly father, we realize
[43:24] that we are just like children also and
[43:26] and you love to be with us and worship
[43:29] with us and as we worship you and you
[43:32] love us and hold us in your arms and
[43:35] send down your Holy Spirit and make us
[43:37] to know that you're living and you're
[43:39] our father. We thank you so much. Now,
[43:42] let the Holy Spirit come to us tonight.
[43:45] Love each heart, Lord. Give us a fresh
[43:47] blessing. Pour out the dew drops of
[43:50] mercy upon us, Father. Do not look at
[43:52] our sins. They're too many. Lord, just
[43:55] forgive them. Omit them, Father, and
[43:58] just take us into thy arms and and heal
[44:01] our sickness and and cleanse our souls
[44:04] and set our spirits free, Lord, that we
[44:07] can worship and praise thee. Be like
[44:10] little children running around the
[44:12] house. Just know that daddy's watching
[44:14] over us. Grant it, Lord. Now, no man is
[44:17] able to to interpret the word. We
[44:22] realize that John saw the book in the
[44:25] right hand of him that sat upon the
[44:26] throne. And there was no man in heaven
[44:29] or in earth or beneath the earth that
[44:32] was worthy to take the book, to open it,
[44:35] or to loose the seals. And there come a
[44:38] lamb up that had been slaying since the
[44:40] foundation of the world. And he was
[44:42] worthy. And he took the book and loosed
[44:45] the seals and opened the book. Oh lamb,
[44:49] come tonight. Open the book to us,
[44:52] Father, as we wait upon thee. For we ask
[44:55] it in Jesus' name, the lamb of God.
[44:59] Amen.
[45:03] I have chosen tonight a little scripture
[45:06] verse share
[45:08] of three words. But first I want to read
[45:11] a verse or two out of St. John the 11th
[45:14] chapter
[45:16] beginning with the 23rd verse.
[45:21] Jesus said unto her, "Thy brother shall
[45:26] rise again."
[45:28] Martha said unto him, "I know he shall
[45:32] rise again in the resurrection at the
[45:35] last day."
[45:37] Jesus said unto her, I am the
[45:41] resurrection and life. He that believeth
[45:44] in me, though he were dead, yet shall he
[45:48] live. And whosoever liveth and believeth
[45:50] in me shall never die. Believest thou
[45:53] this? She said unto him, Ya, Lord, I
[45:58] believe that thou art the Christ, the
[46:01] Son of God, that should come into the
[46:03] world.
[46:05] And for our text, I wish to use these
[46:08] three words. Believest thou this.
[46:14] I read a story some time ago. I think it
[46:17] was a fiction story and most all
[46:20] ministers I guess have read Dr. Ingram's
[46:22] book of um of the prince of the house of
[46:26] David. It's a great book. I think it's
[46:29] absolutely out of print. I like to have
[46:32] it in print so I could put it among the
[46:35] people. And in there I was reading a
[46:38] little article on this Lazarus and upon
[46:42] Jesus and Mary and Martha that the
[46:46] sisters of Lazarus.
[46:49] And I was reading in there that word
[46:52] Jesus lived. I believe with Martha and
[46:56] Mary. They were both lovely Hebrew
[47:00] girls. And Lazarus was learning or
[47:05] training to be a scribe at the temple,
[47:09] making letters of the law for the
[47:11] priest. And Jesus had great fellowship
[47:17] especially with Lazarus.
[47:19] And we read in the book that where he
[47:21] did come to their home and Martha was a
[47:24] little dilitary about uh listening to
[47:27] his words. But she had uh get the dinner
[47:30] ready and set the table. But Mary sat at
[47:33] his feet and Jesus said that Mary has
[47:36] chosen the better things. And then
[47:41] we were told that Lazarus was the one
[47:43] that brought uh uh Jesus to John in the
[47:49] story of Dr. Ingram's books and uh on
[47:52] the Prince of the House of David.
[47:54] However, that might not have been true.
[47:56] I do not know. But just for the
[47:58] background of it, but he was supposed to
[48:01] been living with them. Now we've been
[48:03] learning this coming this last week
[48:06] rather that Jesus said in St. John 5:19
[48:11] I the son can do nothing in himself but
[48:15] what he sees the father doing that doeth
[48:19] the son likewise the father workketh and
[48:23] the son workketh hither to see what he
[48:26] sees the father doing. So to make this
[48:29] really the right story, the father God
[48:33] must have spoke to his son Jesus and
[48:35] said, "Your friend Lazarus is going to
[48:38] die, but it's going to be for the good.
[48:40] So you leave the home. Go away asking
[48:44] you to pray for him and make him well."
[48:46] And and I don't want you to do that. If
[48:48] you watch the story as we go along,
[48:50] you'll see it heaps up to that very
[48:52] truth of that. So Jesus just without any
[48:57] warning or anything walked away from the
[48:59] house and went somewhere else. Didn't
[49:01] return that night and he went to some
[49:04] other cities. And as soon as Jesus left
[49:08] the home,
[49:11] then trouble set in. And when Jesus
[49:14] leaves your home, trouble is on its
[49:17] road.
[49:19] Just remember when he leaves your home,
[49:22] trouble is on the way. When you get
[49:25] social societies and everything
[49:27] operating in your church so perfectly
[49:29] like some great big 16 cylinder Rick and
[49:33] Backer and you leave Jesus out of it.
[49:35] When Jesus goes from your church,
[49:38] troubles on the road. Yes, sir. when
[49:41] Jesus leaves a denomination that they
[49:45] lay him aside and say, "Well, now we
[49:47] just don't believe that these things
[49:48] could be just exactly right." You adopt
[49:50] something else. Troubles on its own.
[49:54] Just remember that. It reminds me of a
[49:56] story of the Lord Jesus is found in the
[49:59] book of Luke. you know, when he was just
[50:01] a boy of about 12 years old, his people
[50:05] taken him, as uh the custom was each
[50:08] year up to the feast of Pentecost.
[50:11] And while they were in the city of
[50:13] Jerusalem uh uh at the feast and having
[50:17] a good time, we find in the Bible that
[50:20] they went three days without him. and
[50:24] they they thought maybe just took it for
[50:27] granted that Jesus must have been among
[50:30] some of their kin folks. Now, we cannot
[50:33] do that when they come to go through
[50:36] their kin folks to find out he wasn't
[50:39] there. And we can't take it for granted
[50:42] just because we're Methodist, Baptist,
[50:44] Presbyterian, Pentecost, and our
[50:46] backgrounds and our forefathers were
[50:49] great believers. We just take it well
[50:51] for granted Jesus is WITH US. WE CAN'T
[50:53] DO THAT. We've got to be in contact with
[50:56] him every day and every minute.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love that.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; I want what God is now.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; What my parents had, what my forefathers
[51:07] had is wonderful, but what they had is
[51:10] good. I think we're farther up the road.
[51:13] Let's see what he is today. I don't want
[51:16] to look back and see what Mr. Moody did
[51:18] because we're farther up the road in Mr.
[51:20] Moody. The trouble of our church is we
[51:22] look back and say u well let's see what
[51:25] Mr. John Wesley said what some of the
[51:28] others said. That's the reason science
[51:30] is so farther in their field than
[51:33] religion is in its here. 300 years ago a
[51:36] French scientist proved that if you'd go
[51:39] the terrific speed of 35 miles an hour
[51:41] gravitation take you off the earth. You
[51:44] think science would refer back to that
[51:45] today? They're going 1,900 miles an hour
[51:49] and still going on. They're pressing
[51:51] forward, looking forward. But we want to
[51:53] look back and see what Moody said, Sanki
[51:55] said, Finny said, Knox, Calvin, some of
[51:58] those. What they SAID WAS ALL RIGHT.
[52:00] THAT WAS FOR their age. But we're going
[52:02] on. My grandfather wrote a cart. I'm
[52:06] driving a Ford V8. My son will fly a jet
[52:09] plane. That's where we're moving on.
[52:11] That's what religion ought to be. The
[52:13] coming of the Lord is at hand. The
[52:15] church OUGHT TO BE MOVING ON INTO the
[52:17] powers. Science can only climb so far
[52:20] and then it has to drop off. But we got
[52:22] untapped sources that's never been
[52:25] touched of the power unlimited of God
[52:29] that we ought to be moving into.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; We're living a million miles under our
[52:34] privilege tonight of privileges of
[52:36] Christians to be enjoying. I feel
[52:39] ashamed of myself when I look out here
[52:41] and see the institutions and the
[52:42] sickness and the troubles that's going
[52:45] on right now. Our church are be walking
[52:47] the street, healing the sick, raising
[52:49] the dead, casting out devils, doing
[52:51] signs and wonders, making the whole
[52:53] world realize that Jesus Christ lives.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; That's what we need to be done doing.
[52:58] Why didn't you say Mr. Moody never? Mr.
[53:00] Moody wasn't living in this day. That's
[53:02] right. We're living on the coming of the
[53:05] Lord. And we just took it for granted
[53:07] that he was WITH OUR KIN FOLKS. BUT THE
[53:10] other day when a challenger challenged
[53:12] Mr. And we found out that he wasn't
[53:14] among our kin folks.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Where did THEY FIND HIM? WHERE DID WHERE
[53:20] DID THEY FIND JESUS? RIGHT WHERE THEY
[53:22] left him.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; WHERE DID THEY LEAVE HIM? At the feast
[53:26] of Pentecost.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; WHERE DID WE LEAVE JESUS? WHERE DID THE
[53:30] CHURCH AT THE FEAST OF PENTECOST? WHEN
[53:33] WE GET AWAY FROM THAT OLD TIME
[53:34] PENTECOSTAL POWER AND THE FEAST OF
[53:36] PENTECOST, WE WALK away from Jesus.
[53:39] That's exactly right, friend. We are
[53:42] living under our privileges. Yes, sir.
[53:47] They left him at THE FEAST OF PENTECOST.
[53:49] AND THERE'S the only place that
[53:51] Methodists, Baptist, Presbyterian, and
[53:54] Pentecostals will EVER FIND HIM IS GO
[53:57] BACK WHERE YOU LEFT HIM AT. WHERE IS THE
[53:59] JOY OF THE LORD? WHERE IS THE POWER OF
[54:01] THE LORD? THE CHURCH ASKED TODAY, WHAT
[54:03] WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GOD OF HISTORY?
[54:05] HE'S WAITING FOR HIS PEOPLE TO CALL HIM
[54:08] ON THE SCENE. BUT UH WE can't do it
[54:10] through denominations. We can't do it
[54:13] under UH PSYCHOLOGY. We can't do it
[54:16] under arithmetic or we can't DO IT WITH
[54:19] EDUCATION. WE SEPARATE OURSELVES, DIVIDE
[54:22] OURSELVES. WE ARE NOT DIVIDED. WE ARE
[54:25] ONE [screaming] PERSON INDEED IN CHRIST
[54:27] JESUS. WE ARE ALL ONE IN CHRIST. AND OUR
[54:30] DENOMINATIONS WILL NEVER DO IT. AS GOOD
[54:32] AS THEY ARE, THEY won't do it. Our
[54:34] education is THE GREATEST HINDRANCE THE
[54:36] GOSPEL EVER HAD IS EDUCATION. WHAT WE
[54:39] NEED IS NOT EDUCATION. WE NEED THE POWER
[54:41] AND DEMONSTRATION OF THE HOLY GHOST BACK
[54:44] IN THE CHURCH to demonstrate the power.
[54:47] Jesus never said go into all the world
[54:49] and and teach. He never said go into all
[54:52] the world and he said go into all the
[54:53] world and preach the gospel.
[54:57] AND THE GOSPEL IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE
[54:59] POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST, the
[55:01] resurrection.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; We're still a million miles short and
[55:05] where we should be. Let us move forward.
[55:08] LET'S GO BACK WHERE WE LEFT HIM AT THE
[55:10] FEAST OF PENTECOST. JESUS SAID IN JOHN,
[55:12] I'll be the 15th chapter. He said, "I am
[55:16] the vine. Ye are the branches." Well,
[55:18] NOW IF THAT VINE PUT FORTH the first
[55:20] branch, and out of that branch wrote a
[55:23] book of Acts,
[55:25] the second branch will make another book
[55:27] of Acts.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; THE THIRD BRANCH WILL MAKE ANOTHER BOOK
[55:30] OF ACTS. HALLELUJAH.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; And every BRANCH THAT COMES OUT of that
[55:34] vine will be THE SAME AS THE FIRST
[55:36] BRANCH WAS.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; NOW, you can draft. We know that. I've
[55:41] seen a citrus tree with about eight
[55:42] different kinds of fruit on it. I've
[55:44] seen an orange tree putting grapefruits
[55:46] and lemons and everything else on it,
[55:48] BUT THEY WERE DRAFTED IN. THAT'S WHAT'S
[55:50] THE MATTER TODAY. WE'VE DRAFTED IN OUR
[55:53] IDEAS, DRAFTED IN OUR DENOMINATIONS. BUT
[55:55] IF THAT TREE EVER PUTS FORTH ANOTHER
[55:57] FRUIT VINE ITSELF, IT'LL BE LIKE THE
[55:59] ORIGINAL WASN'T GOOD.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; OH, CHURCH WILL BLEND TOGETHER. BUT WE
[56:05] NEED THE POWER OF THE ORIGINAL. WE NEED
[56:08] THE HOLY GHOST. THE POWER OF THE
[56:11] RESURRECTION OF JESUS CHRIST. THAT'S
[56:14] WHAT HE TOLD US to do. I am the vine. Ye
[56:17] are the branches. If a grape vine puts
[56:20] forth a shootute and it comes out with
[56:21] pretty blue grapes, the next vine it
[56:24] brings out will have pretty blue grapes
[56:26] on it. If the FIRST VINE COME OUT and
[56:29] they fell under THE IMPACT OF THE HOLY
[56:31] SPIRIT and they did great miracles and
[56:34] signs and seal their testimony to a
[56:37] world even many OF THEM WITH THEIR OWN
[56:40] TESTIMONY. THEY WITH THEIR BLOOD THEY
[56:42] seal their testimony. They went through
[56:44] all kinds of perils and everything TO
[56:46] BRING THE GOSPEL. THEY SUFFERED. They
[56:49] were beaten. They were punished. Must we
[56:51] be carried home to HEAVEN ON A FIERY BED
[56:54] OF EASE? WHILE OTHERS FOUGHT TO WIN THE
[56:56] PRIZE AND SAILED THROUGH BLOODY SEAS.
[56:58] WHAT DO WE EXPECT TO DO? I MUST FIGHT IF
[57:01] I MUST REIGN. INCREASE my courage. Lord,
[57:04] certainly we need a We don't need a new
[57:07] denomination. We don't NEED A NEW CHURCH
[57:09] BUILDING. WHAT WE NEED TODAY IS AN old
[57:11] time BACKWOOD SKY BLUE SINKILLING
[57:15] PENTECOSTAL REVIVAL THAT WAS BORN at
[57:17] Pentecost and back into the church
[57:19] again. The power of the Holy Ghost again
[57:22] to bring Jesus on the scene. The God of
[57:25] history always rises on the scene in a
[57:28] crucial moment. We need it.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; That's what's the matter church today.
[57:33] We're getting too far back. We're
[57:34] falling into the fashions of the world
[57:36] and gradually year by year it begins to
[57:38] die a little and wither away. It's
[57:41] pruning time pretty soon.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; God will cut it back as sure as I'm
[57:45] standing this pull pit. God will cut her
[57:47] back. HE'LL MAKE HER BAD FRUIT. HE'LL
[57:49] CUT THE WORKS OF THE WORLD OUT OF IT ONE
[57:50] OF THESE DAYS.
[57:53] Such a disgrace the way the church has
[57:55] carried on under the name of religion.
[57:57] And we find out when Jesus left, death
[58:02] set in. When Jesus LEAVES OUR CHURCH,
[58:05] THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT LEAVES OUR
[58:07] CHURCH, it begins to dwindle and and
[58:10] die. And after a while, there's nothing
[58:12] more to it. Now, when Jesus left, death
[58:16] set in. OH, WHAT A SAD time it was. And
[58:19] notice, they wandered around and they
[58:22] sent for Jesus, but he didn't come. They
[58:26] sent for him again and he didn't come.
[58:28] But he knowed what he was going to do.
[58:31] HE KNOWS TONIGHT WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO.
[58:33] IT'S NOT LOST WITH HIM. HE KNOWS EXACTLY
[58:36] WHAT HE'S FIXING TO DO. He's going to
[58:38] raise a people up. Just as certain as
[58:40] I'm standing this pulpit, he'll raise a
[58:42] people for his name's sake. Now, the
[58:44] Gentile generation, he'll do it. The
[58:47] Jews times right at hand now. And the
[58:50] Gentiles are ending out because they
[58:52] just went on out. They're rejecting
[58:54] Christ. They're rejecting their signs.
[58:56] They're rejecting EVERYTHING IS CALLED
[58:58] GODLY AND BRANDED AS SOME kind of
[59:00] telepathy or devil power and do they're
[59:03] blaspheming the Holy Ghost and sealing
[59:05] themselves away from God AND GOD WILL
[59:07] TAKE THAT MINORITY AFTER A WHILE AND
[59:09] raise it up into a powerful church and
[59:11] then turn the spirit to the Jews and
[59:13] take the Gentile church home. Exactly
[59:16] right. She's in the making now.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Well, we're at the end time nearly.
[59:21] Jesus he knew and after a while he said
[59:23] our friend Lazarus sleepeth. While the
[59:26] disciples thought he was taking a little
[59:28] rest. He said well if he's asleeping
[59:30] he's doing very well. Well he said in is
[59:34] their words so that they would
[59:35] understand. Said he's dead and for your
[59:39] sake I'm glad I wasn't there.
[59:42] See for your sake I'm glad I wasn't
[59:45] there because they've been asking him to
[59:47] to heal to heal him. But he knowed he
[59:50] couldn't do it because the vision was
[59:51] yet after those four days. He knew that
[59:54] was the time the father told him. How
[59:56] beautifully said the grave. Father I
[59:58] thank these I was already heard but I
[1:00:00] just say it for these it stands by. See
[1:00:02] he already know what he was going to do.
[1:00:05] He said I'll go wake him. Now I can
[1:00:07] imagine that little home was really
[1:00:09] broken up. The bread winner gone.
[1:00:11] Sadness. Oh, it's wonderful when you got
[1:00:14] a sad home or a sad heart. Then Jesus
[1:00:17] appears all at once, isn't it? I can
[1:00:19] imagine seeing Martha, the beautiful
[1:00:21] little woman with the black veil over
[1:00:23] her face and little Mary and them
[1:00:25] holding one another saying, "What will
[1:00:26] we do? Papa and mama's gone and our
[1:00:29] precious brother. Now we have left the
[1:00:32] church and we're excommunicated from
[1:00:34] them and come out to follow Jesus of
[1:00:36] Nazareth and he's pulled away and left
[1:00:38] us somewhere." I can hear a critic come
[1:00:40] by and say, "Hey, where's that divine
[1:00:42] healer, that prophet of Galilee? Where's
[1:00:45] he at now?" See, when it really comes to
[1:00:47] time for him to do something, he's gone.
[1:00:49] There it is. See, God just loves to do
[1:00:52] that just to let people just let people
[1:00:54] show what they are. Just trying them to
[1:00:57] see what they really are. He gives him a
[1:00:59] blessing. He appears, shows himself,
[1:01:02] introduces himself to the people just to
[1:01:04] see what kind of a reaction they'll
[1:01:06] take, just to see what they'll do about
[1:01:08] it. Now, we find that after uh a few
[1:01:12] days, four days, poor Lazarus was dead.
[1:01:15] that beared him. Second day, third day,
[1:01:18] fourth day. Now, anyone knows corruption
[1:01:21] sets in after three days. The nose falls
[1:01:24] in on the face first and then corruption
[1:01:28] sets in. The skin worms begins to eat
[1:01:30] the body. They lay him in the ground,
[1:01:32] cut a big rock over the top of the cave
[1:01:34] where they had him. And every once in a
[1:01:36] while, the young girls would go out and
[1:01:38] kneel down the grave and cry. After a
[1:01:41] while, the news got around.
[1:01:43] Jesus has come. We seen him moving into
[1:01:47] the city. Oh, that little Martha that
[1:01:50] had been so seemingly so dilitary about
[1:01:53] it. She proved then what she was made
[1:01:55] out of. Here she comes. She's coming on
[1:01:57] her road then. Run out seeking. I can
[1:01:59] hear some of them along the road say,
[1:02:00] "Well, I guess you're satisfied now that
[1:02:03] your religion was false." She just
[1:02:05] ignored him and went on. Passed right on
[1:02:08] by all the critics. She went down till
[1:02:10] she seen him, maybe set him down at the
[1:02:12] street corner. Now, it's seemingly she
[1:02:15] must she might have had a right to array
[1:02:17] him and and speak evil to him. Why? She
[1:02:20] didn't run up and say, "Look at here.
[1:02:22] Look at here. You you're SUPPOSED TO BE
[1:02:24] A PROPHET, a man of God. WHY DIDN'T YOU
[1:02:27] COME WHEN WE called you? Why? WE'RE THE
[1:02:29] LAUGHING STOCK OF THE TOWN NOW. WE COME
[1:02:32] OUT OF OUR CHURCH TO follow you." Seemed
[1:02:34] like she had a right. But, you know,
[1:02:36] just like I preached on the lamb and
[1:02:38] dove. If we are a lamb, a lamb forfeits
[1:02:41] every right he's got. It's exactly
[1:02:43] right. You ain't got nothing but wool,
[1:02:45] so he has to forfeit that. And you
[1:02:47] forfeit every right that you've got to
[1:02:49] serve God. That's exactly right. I was
[1:02:52] getting there at the women about the way
[1:02:53] they're wearing these little old
[1:02:54] clothes, you know. And they said, "Well,
[1:02:56] we we're Americans. WE CAN DO WHAT WE
[1:02:58] WANT TO." I said, "That's exactly right.
[1:03:00] But if you're a land, you'll forfeit
[1:03:01] your rights. Smoking cigarettes and
[1:03:03] carrying on like that, that's the worst
[1:03:05] thing a woman ever done." It's exactly
[1:03:07] right. A lady said to me not long ago
[1:03:09] talking. She said, "BUT BROTHER
[1:03:10] BRANDHAM, THEY DON'T MAKE NO OTHER kind
[1:03:12] of clothes." I said, "But they still
[1:03:13] make sewing machines and sell goods.
[1:03:15] There's no excuse for it at all."
[1:03:17] Exactly. Right.
[1:03:20] Remember, someday you may be pure here
[1:03:22] to your husband, but you'll answer for
[1:03:24] adultery. For this is certain. Whosoever
[1:03:27] lookth upon a woman to lust after her
[1:03:29] has committed adultery with her already
[1:03:31] in his heart. What's the matter with the
[1:03:34] Pentecostal women today? What I'm
[1:03:35] wondering how you have got away from the
[1:03:38] old hewing line how your mothers used to
[1:03:40] wear long hair and the day the Pentecost
[1:03:43] women paint up like a bunch of muddy
[1:03:44] grows and cut their hair and wear little
[1:03:46] short clothes like that just like the
[1:03:49] rest of the way get out and mow the yard
[1:03:50] in the afternoon when man's coming by.
[1:03:52] Do you realize woman that you're going
[1:03:54] to have to answer for committing
[1:03:55] adultery without management? YOU PRESENT
[1:03:58] YOURSELF TO THEM FOR THAT PURPOSE.
[1:04:00] IT'S A EVIL SPIRIT ON THE CHURCH AND THE
[1:04:02] PEOPLE AND THEY DON'T KNOW IT. BLIND AND
[1:04:05] DON'T KNOW IT. The truth.
[1:04:08] Maybe you might say, "I haven't got a
[1:04:10] right to say that as evangelist." Well,
[1:04:11] I I have to follow the leading of the
[1:04:13] Holy Spirit. That's all I can say. You
[1:04:15] know, if I meet your judgment, then I
[1:04:17] won't have to have your blood ON MY
[1:04:19] HANDS. GET AWAY FROM EVERY BIT OF THE
[1:04:21] GROUND THAT LOOKS LIKE SATAN. STAY AWAY
[1:04:23] FROM IT. Get I don't care how MANY
[1:04:26] TELEVISION STARS. YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE A
[1:04:28] TELEVISION STAR. YOU'RE A DAUGHTER OF
[1:04:30] GOD.
[1:04:32] preaching in a pastor's church the other
[1:04:33] morning about an old slave timely
[1:04:36] selling slaves long ago and they used to
[1:04:39] come by and buy them on the auction and
[1:04:42] the people were they're weeping crying
[1:04:44] because their homeland they never go
[1:04:47] back no more they had to whip them and
[1:04:48] they'd buy them just like you'd buy an
[1:04:50] automobile just for anything prices and
[1:04:53] selling [clears throat] them human
[1:04:54] beings and one day a buyer come by a
[1:04:57] broker to a big found a big plantation
[1:04:59] rather and he said how many slaves you
[1:05:02] got for sale? Said, "Well, you got some
[1:05:03] to swap. They try to get them big. Take
[1:05:05] them mothers, fathers. If the woman he
[1:05:08] had married was a little weakly woman,
[1:05:10] take these big healthy men and breed
[1:05:12] them like HORSES AND ANIMALS." NEVER WAS
[1:05:14] RIGHT.
[1:05:16] GOD MADE MAN. MAN MADE SLAVES. NOT right
[1:05:20] to begin with. Never. God don't intend
[1:05:22] any man to be a slave. No, sir. And no,
[1:05:25] watch what taking place. Then in the
[1:05:27] midst of all that, this fell said,
[1:05:29] "Well, I'd like to buy some." You notice
[1:05:31] one young fellow there. They didn't have
[1:05:32] to whip him. His chin was up, head up,
[1:05:35] just like a real gentleman walking
[1:05:37] around. And that broker said, "I'd like
[1:05:39] to buy him." He said, "But he's not for
[1:05:41] sale." He said, "Well, why?" Said, "Is
[1:05:44] he the boss?" He said, "He's a slave."
[1:05:46] Well, said, "Why? Do you feed him better
[1:05:48] than you do the rest of them?" He said,
[1:05:50] "No, he eats out there in the galley
[1:05:51] with the rest of them. He's a slave."
[1:05:53] Said, "What makes him so much different
[1:05:55] than the rest of them?" And the boss
[1:05:58] said, "I wondered that myself for a long
[1:06:00] time, but one day I found out over in
[1:06:03] the homeland, his father is a king of
[1:06:06] the tribe. And though he's an alien away
[1:06:09] from home, he still knows he's a king's
[1:06:11] son, and he conducts himself like one."
[1:06:14] If if an AFRICAN NATIVE COULD REALIZE
[1:06:17] THAT HIS FATHER IS A KING and over here
[1:06:19] an alien in a STRANGE LAND CAN STILL
[1:06:22] KNOW THAT ACROSS THE SEA HE'S A KING'S
[1:06:24] SON. How art WOMEN AND MEN CONDUCT
[1:06:26] THEMSELVES when you're sons AND
[1:06:28] DAUGHTERS OF GOD ACT like it.
[1:06:31] CERTAINLY CONDUCT YOURSELF, CLEAN up
[1:06:33] yourselves and act like SONS AND
[1:06:35] DAUGHTERS OF GOD. Wonder what a
[1:06:38] condition here we are. Oh, little Martha
[1:06:42] come running out. She looked like she
[1:06:44] had a a way to have said something
[1:06:47] against him. Why didn't have you COME TO
[1:06:48] MY BRETHREN? LOOK WHAT WE'VE DONE FOR
[1:06:50] YOU AND YOU let us down. What if she had
[1:06:53] said that? The story never would have
[1:06:54] finished the way it did.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; It's the way you approach a divine gift
[1:06:59] of God. If God sends a gift, you've got
[1:07:02] to approach it right. If you ever expect
[1:07:04] to get anything from it,
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; you've got to approach it right. And
[1:07:08] Martha knew that. She'd probably read
[1:07:10] about the Shounomite woman and her baby.
[1:07:12] And she, if that Shounomite woman knew
[1:07:14] that God was in Elijah, how much more
[1:07:16] was he in Jesus?
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Sure. So, she went up with the right
[1:07:20] approach. She run up and fell down at
[1:07:22] his feet. I LIKE THAT.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; FELL DOWN AT HIS FEET AND SAID, "LORD,"
[1:07:28] that's his right title. That's what he
[1:07:30] was. He was her Lord. "LORD, IF THOU
[1:07:34] WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE, MY BROTHER WOULD
[1:07:36] NOT HAVE DIED." Oh my. Oh, I could just
[1:07:40] imagine seeing his great heart as he
[1:07:42] looked at that beautiful woman of tears
[1:07:44] running down her cheeks said, "Lord, if
[1:07:46] you'd have been here, my brother would
[1:07:48] not have died." Watch what she said.
[1:07:50] "But even now, Lord,
[1:07:55] though he's dead, though the skin worms
[1:07:57] is crawling through his body, EVEN NOW,
[1:08:01] LORD, WHATEVER YOU ask God, God will
[1:08:03] give IT TO YOU."
[1:08:05] OH, THAT'S THE SECRET.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT SAY I'VE SEEN THROUGH EVERY
[1:08:10] HOSPITAL. THE DOCTOR SAYS I'M GOING TO
[1:08:12] DIE. But even now, Lord,
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; I'm all CRIPPLED UP WITH ARTHRITIS. I
[1:08:17] CAN'T MOVE. But even now, Lord, that
[1:08:20] little BABY HAD A WATER HEAD THAT BIG
[1:08:22] AROUND LAST NIGHT. THERE'S NOTHING HE
[1:08:23] CAN DO. SPREAD ON OUT AND BURST ITS
[1:08:25] LITTLE HEAD AND DIE. But even now, LORD,
[1:08:28] HE'S STILL THE SAME GOD. HE'S STILL THE
[1:08:31] SAME LORD. EVEN NOW, LORD. AND HE'S
[1:08:35] SITTING AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD
[1:08:37] ALMIGHTY, MAKING INTERCESSIONS UPON THE
[1:08:40] THINGS THAT WE PRAY THAT HE'S done for
[1:08:42] us. Now, I really feel religious. Sure
[1:08:45] do. You're going to call me a holy
[1:08:47] roller anyhow, and you might as well get
[1:08:49] started and get it over with. So, yes,
[1:08:52] SIR. EVEN NOW, LORD, WHATEVER YOU ASK
[1:08:55] GOD, GOD WILL DO IT. ASK THE FATHER
[1:08:57] ANYTHING IN MY NAME, I'LL DO IT. JESUS
[1:08:59] SAID, "Even now, Lord, whatever you ask,
[1:09:02] God will give it to you." Oh, that must
[1:09:04] have turned in his great heart. He said,
[1:09:07] "Thy brother shall live again." She
[1:09:10] said, "Yay, Lord, he'll live. He was a
[1:09:12] good boy. He'll come forth in the
[1:09:14] general resurrection at the last day."
[1:09:16] Them Jews believed in the gentle
[1:09:17] resurrection. He'll come forth in the
[1:09:20] resurrection of the last days. Look at
[1:09:22] him. He pulled his little self together.
[1:09:24] He said, "I am the resurrection life.
[1:09:28] Oh my. THERE NEVER WAS [screaming] A MAN
[1:09:31] CAN SAY THAT BEFORE. THERE NEVER WILL BE
[1:09:33] ONE AFTERWARD WHICH CAN SAY IT. HE'S THE
[1:09:35] ONLY ONE THAT CAN SAY IT. I AM THE
[1:09:38] resurrection and life, saith the Lord.
[1:09:42] He that believeth in me, THOUGH HE WERE
[1:09:44] DEAD, YET SHALL HE LIVE.
[1:09:47] AND WHOSOEVER LIVETH AND BELIEVETH IN ME
[1:09:49] SHALL NEVER DIE.
[1:09:52] Leavest thou this? She said, "Yay,
[1:09:55] Lord." Oh, she knows something's fixing
[1:09:57] to happen. HAS TO BE. WHEN FAITH FROM AN
[1:10:00] HONEST HEART MEETS GOD, THEM COG JUST
[1:10:03] COMES TOGETHER LIKE THAT. Something has
[1:10:05] TO TAKE PLACE.
[1:10:07] I CHALLENGE THIS AUDIENCE TONIGHT IN THE
[1:10:10] NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. LET YOUR FAITH
[1:10:11] CONNECT WITH GOD LIKE THAT. IN A FEW
[1:10:13] MINUTES, we'll have another Pentecost.
[1:10:17] There will be such a revival break IN
[1:10:18] THIS TOWN, THERE WON'T BE ENOUGH COPS IN
[1:10:20] THE COUNTRY TO keep them down. That's
[1:10:22] right. There will be a real revival
[1:10:26] EVEN NOW, LORD. WELL, LORD, WE'VE DONE
[1:10:28] CALL OFF HIM THIS. WE'VE DID THIS AND
[1:10:30] DID THAT. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'VE DONE.
[1:10:32] EVEN NOW, LORD, HE'S WAITING FOR YOU TO
[1:10:34] CALL on him. Even believe this.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Sure, Esther. Even now, whatever you ask
[1:10:41] him, where have you laid him? Now, he
[1:10:44] goes down to the grave. HE WAS MAN
[1:10:47] ENOUGH TO CRY. He was God enough to
[1:10:50] raise the dead. here some time ago a
[1:10:52] woman it belongs to a certain group of
[1:10:54] people I never make it a habit to make
[1:10:56] it about denominations but this woman
[1:10:59] they do not believe that Jesus was
[1:11:01] divine they said he was just a prophet
[1:11:03] now he was if he is just a prophet we're
[1:11:06] all in sin
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; he was either God nothing less than God
[1:11:10] or the biggest deceiver the world ever
[1:11:12] had
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; right
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; he was more than a man she said he
[1:11:16] wasn't divine so much of that in this
[1:11:17] SOCIAL GOSPEL TODAY TRYING TO MAKE JESUS
[1:11:19] CHRIST A PROPHET
[1:11:21] WELL, HE WAS A GOD OF THE PROPHETS.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Sure was. She said, "I'll prove IT TO
[1:11:26] YOU WITH YOUR BIBLE. HE WAS JUST A MAN."
[1:11:28] I said, "You do it." And she said, "WHEN
[1:11:31] HE WENT TO THE GRAVE OF LAZARUS, THE
[1:11:33] BIBLE SAID HE WEPT. He had to be mortal
[1:11:35] or he couldn't weep." I said, "Lady, is
[1:11:37] that your scripture?" I don't mean to be
[1:11:39] sacriiggious here to say this, but I'll
[1:11:41] tell you what I told her. She said,
[1:11:43] "That's it." I said, "That statement is
[1:11:45] weaker than the broth made out of a
[1:11:47] shadow of a chicken and starve to
[1:11:48] death." I said, "Well, YOU YOU HAVEN'T
[1:11:50] GOT ONE THING TO STAND ON." SHE SAID,
[1:11:53] "WELL, HE WEPT. THAT SHOWED HE WAS
[1:11:55] MORTAL." I SAID, "HE WAS BOTH MORTAL AND
[1:11:57] IMMORTAL. HE WAS GOD IN FLESH." SHE
[1:12:01] SAID, "OH, NONSENSE." I SAID, "HE WENT
[1:12:03] TO THE GRAVE WEEPING." THAT'S TRUE
[1:12:05] ENOUGH. BUT WHEN HE STRAIGHTENED HIS
[1:12:07] LITTLE SELF UP, THE BIBLE SAID THERE
[1:12:08] WASN'T MUCH TO LOOK UPON HIM. NO BEAUTY
[1:12:10] WE SHOULD DESIRE. BUT WHEN HE THROW THEM
[1:12:12] LITTLE SHOULDERS BACK AND SAID,
[1:12:13] "NAZARETH, COME FORTH." AND A MAN HAD
[1:12:16] BEEN DEAD FOUR DAYS AND ROTTEN IN THE
[1:12:18] GRAVE. HE CAME FORTH. THAT WAS MORE THAN
[1:12:22] A MAN.
[1:12:24] Show me the man TO DO IT. WHAT WAS IT?
[1:12:27] CORRUPTION KNEW ITS MASTER. LIFE KNEW
[1:12:30] ITS CREATOR. SOMETHING HAD TO HAPPEN. HE
[1:12:33] SPOKE. AND A MAN THAT WAS DEAD AND IN
[1:12:35] THE GRAVE FOR 4 DAYS, RAISED AGAIN,
[1:12:38] STOOD ON HIS FEET AND LIVED.
[1:12:40] HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:42] THAT WAS GOD IN HIS SON.
[1:12:45] YES, SIR.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; That was God making himself KNOWN TO
[1:12:49] HIM. SON, THAT WAS GOD SPEAKING, NOT A
[1:12:52] MAN.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; HE was a MAN WHEN HE LOOKED AROUND ON
[1:12:55] THAT TREE THAT DAY FOR SOMETHING TO EAT.
[1:12:57] THAT WAS A MAN. But when he took five
[1:12:59] biscuits AND TWO FISH AND FED 5,000,
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS MORE THAN A MAN. THAT WAS GOD.
[1:13:07] Was more than a prophet. MORE THAN A
[1:13:10] MAN. HE WAS THE GOD MAN. SURE. HE LAID
[1:13:13] ON THE BACK OF THAT LITTLE BOAT THAT
[1:13:15] night and the SEAS ROARING AND BOUNCING
[1:13:19] LIKE A BOTTLE STOPPER OUT THERE IN THAT
[1:13:21] MIGHTY SEA WHEN 10,000 DEVILS OF THE SEA
[1:13:24] SWORE THEY HAD DROWNED HIM THAT NIGHT.
[1:13:26] HE WAS A MAN WEAK AND TIRED FROM PRAYING
[1:13:29] FOR THE SICK LAYING BACK THERE AND THE
[1:13:31] WIND DIDN'T EVEN DISTURB HIM. HE WAS A
[1:13:33] MAN WHEN HE WAS ASLEEP. BUT WHEN HE WOKE
[1:13:35] UP, PUT HIS FOOT UP ON THE BRAILLE OF
[1:13:37] THE BOAT, LOOKED UP AND SAID, "PEACE BE
[1:13:39] STILL." AND THE WINDS AND THE WAVES
[1:13:41] OBEYED HIM. THAT WAS MORE THAN A MAN.
[1:13:44] THAT WAS GOD IN MAN MAKING HIMSELF
[1:13:47] KNOWN.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; That's right. He was a man AT THE CROSS
[1:13:50] WHEN HE CRIED FOR MERCY. WHEN HE CRIED
[1:13:52] AND SAID, "I THIRST." THAT WAS A MAN.
[1:13:55] WHEN HE DIED, HE WAS A MAN. BUT ON
[1:13:57] EASTER MORNING WHEN HE BROKE THE SEALS
[1:13:59] OF DEATH, HELL IN THE GRAVE, AND ROSE
[1:14:02] AGAIN, HE WAS MORE THAN A MAN IN GOD.
[1:14:08] NO OTHER COURT SAID LIVING HE LOVED ME.
[1:14:10] DYING HE SAVED ME. BURIED HE CARRIED MY
[1:14:13] SINS FAR AWAY. RISING HE JUSTIFIED
[1:14:16] FREELY FOREVER. SOMEDAY HE'S COMING. OH
[1:14:20] GLORIOUS DAY.
[1:14:24] He said BECAUSE I LIVE YOU LIVE ALSO.
[1:14:29] BELIEVE US THIS.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; HE'S THE SAME YESTERDAY AND FOREVER.
[1:14:33] BELIEVE US THIS.
[1:14:36] I BELIEVE THE HOLY GHOST IS RIGHT HERE
[1:14:38] NOW. LEAVE US DOWN THIS.
[1:14:41] I BELIEVE HE'LL FILL US WITH HIS
[1:14:42] PRESENCE. LEAVE US THIS. I BELIEVE THE
[1:14:45] HOLY GHOST WANTS TO POUR HIS PRESENCE
[1:14:47] OUT. HEAL ALL THE SICK. MAKE ALL THE

[1:14:51] HEALED. LEAVE US THOU THIS. DO YOU
[1:14:54] BELIEVE WITH ALL YOUR HEART? LET'S STAND
[1:14:56] TO OUR FEET AND GIVE HIM PRAISE. I
[1:14:58] BELIEVE YOU RIGHT NOW. Oh Lord God,
[1:15:02] creator of the heavens and earth, author
[1:15:04] of eternal life, giver of every good
[1:15:07] gift. We bring us out this heart. We

[1:15:23] AND OUR NAMES are written in the lamb's
[1:15:25] BOOK OF LIFE. ALL HEAVENS AND EARTH WILL
[1:15:27] PASS AWAY, BUT WE WILL LIVE FOREVER
[1:15:30] BECAUSE YOU LIVE FOREVER. LORD, you
[1:15:33] promise it's good. We believe it with
[1:15:35] all our heart. Everything that's in us,
[1:15:38] we believe,
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; you breathing.

[1:16:05] BELIEVE US THOU THIS. THE HOLY SPIRIT IS

[1:16:11] DEATH. This is it. The Holy Ghost." Oh
[1:16:14] Lord, prayer of heaven is earth. Send
[1:16:17] thy POWER AND THY BLESSINGS AND THY
[1:16:19] goodness upon this people and bless
[1:16:22] their hearts and let them see that the
[1:16:24] son of man is alive forever more. Grant
[1:16:28] it, oh Lord. We present them to thee in
[1:16:31] the name of Jesus Christ, the son of
[1:16:33] God. Anybody doesn't have the Holy
[1:16:36] Ghost, raise up your hands and praise
[1:16:37] his box. I'LL GIVE YOU A FALL ON YOU.
[1:16:39] SOMEBODY PUT YOUR HANDS ON THERE. THIS
[1:16:41] IS THE HOUR. WHY DO WE WAIT ANY LONGER?

[1:16:47] Pentecost coming back to God. Get life
[1:16:50] without Pentecost. GET YOUR HEART

[1:16:59] your soul. He's your battle tonight. We
[1:17:03] are to heal the sick in sight to the
[1:17:05] blind with the great and mighty power
[1:17:08] for he proves himself to be ever more
[1:17:11] the same. HALLELUJAH. PLEASE RAISE YOUR
[1:17:14] HAND
[1:17:17] around him and his glory power and his
[1:17:21] mercy.

[1:18:05] Let's see people. Let's see the people
[1:18:08] of God. I'LL RAISE MY HAND. LORD, YOU'RE

[1:18:15] cold and send your power upon us. God

[1:21:46] it. We're children of God. We're all one
[1:21:48] baby church, one unbaked person in
[1:21:51] Christ Jesus."
