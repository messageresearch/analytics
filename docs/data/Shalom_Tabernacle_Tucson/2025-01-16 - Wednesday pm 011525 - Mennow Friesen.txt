ministering for us tonight and we look forward to that the last time he spoke here he quoted out of a message I think it I can't think of the name of it but it stayed with me he's talking about how

God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God Amen let's just bow for word of prayer father we thank you tonight that with a joyful heart we can praise you the one true worthy God beside thee there is none though many have claimed to be but you never fail and your word stands sure heavens and earth will pass away from this condition but your word will never pass away it will simply go to be fulfilled and we believe tonight is a part of that fulfilling we're standing here in your grace standing here the what we believe is the brink of a new dispensation a new kingdom coming where there'll be no more sin or sickness trials and tests but as long as we're here we sing that song through many dangers toils and snares I have already come but it was grace that brought me safe thus far and Grace will lead me home thank you Lord for your mercy bless us tonight around your word Lord just one word from you changes the whole condition Lord so as we surrender to you now through the singing and the song leader and the musics and everyone's done their little part to see that you would would get the atmosphere right where you'd come and bless your children I commit them to you not only here but the sister churches in the Tucson area the round area Lord maybe they gathered tonight we pray your blessing on them as well bless your word now we pray humbly in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you can be seated and um I want to greet you tonight it's good to be here always good Tucson always holds a real uh well I uh I was kind of reminiscing to myself today I you know I've come we've come here the first time and back in ' 69 and uh a few uh Winters have gone by since' 69 and uh many a precious person I was trying to look through some of them you know and all of the names the uh well they leave me by now but people that we've met over the years and sometimes thinking there must be more on the other side than there's living of the elect lady they most all the whole generation passed away and uh and some of us are bumping that generation real close we might I don't know how many of us will still pass away before the Rapture takes place but um good thing is we know that death has no part in this to them that are in Christ There Is No Death and just a change of dispensation I like the way brother Ram said is just a change of address and um I've been having the same address for what 40 44 years 45 years um it'll kind of be nice to have a new plaque hanging out out there different address the kingdoms of this world will soon before for and fall we shall see the King when he comes than of the precious people here I was uh you know of course brother Israel here the uh the work here the labor that God puts in heart it's it's interesting to know I've always looked at sometimes we count it kind of complicated sometimes but he said the steps of the Lord the steps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord pretty good order isn't it I know we can put it in order sometimes and we don't get what we order but God always gets what he orders and sometimes we wonder why God put us over here for our reason we were reminiscing a bunch of us are sitting around the table Kim you didn't get to be there but um we we did talk about you a little bit but it was good yeah and uh he's my uh close friend although we live miles and miles apart but we've brother dly as well good to see you Brothers here and sister good to see you and uh but we were talking reminiscing about some of the things and and uh you know sitting about there's about 12 of us around the table I thought must have been like the Lord Jesus uh sitting with his disciples sometimes and we begin to talk about the things brother Ron Peterson myself and some of the other brothers were talking about the things and how that the steps have been ordered in a different way and we marveled how did we get where we were at and it's amazing how sometimes you think through through many dangers toils and snares there's way more to it than just singing the song when you realize what happens that God infinitely by divine nature that he knows them that are his and he can't lose one and I want to just maybe just I don't remember what I preached last time maybe I'll take the same notes and if I I don't have too many notes really they are pretty much all the same just change scriptures and but do you know there is only one note really isn't it you know you start you you can start in Genesis and end up in Revelations you start in Revelations end up in Genesis it's the same self same Living God the same entity the same God that started the work has been working and he's enjoyed his work I know that because he laid it out and it was his pleasure you know it was his good pleasure to save you it was his good pleasure to go and let you and me and I you and I go through the the the tests and the trials that makes up the shape that we need to have there's not not one of the trials we ever go through is there to destroy us it's there to mold and shape in the place to where we are just tuned just right when you look at the tuner uh this year uh is a pretty good tuner and uh and I I like the way the prophet said when you look into this Bible you should be able to see yourself as in the mirror of God and he said the evidence of having the Holy Ghost is to believe every word in its season when it's Vindicated made flesh oh I like that the word made flesh that's what God has always dwelt in in flesh vessels unworthy as we were why I'm going to read a little from from the scripture but but that's what I believe this message has done and uh I hear the prophet say uh when he gets to the third pull of his ministry is so profound how God has separated the people for his own name and and he gets to the place and said and the rest of the world knows nothing of what God is being revealed to us knows nothing to keep around they know nothing about the church ages they know nothing about The Messengers to the AG they know nothing about the spirit of God moving from glory to glory to glory to glory they say oh it's the same thing we're just all religious different names different brand just religious that's about it but many are called but few are chosen but the ones that God chooses they walk in the light I like God bless all the names I I you know I was thinking of the greens now they're gone and uh Bobby and Jenny they're not here anymore they took to Florida for the winter and and uh Chuck and Barbara are still here good to see you and uh yeah still plugging along it's good to see in the Y Bros Mike and yeah see you don't see your wife here tonight but your mom still living ah praise the Lord your dad of course we know he's on the other side waiting hurry up and uh think of uh you know Joy and Chris and John Green and different ones that passed on um wheelers WS Normans all I got to meet them all when I was when brother Bram was still alive 1965 and uh got to meet them there I remember brother wheeler brother man she got Offspring there and uh uh it was it was uh brother wheeler that led us to the pool and brother man baptized Us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and uh back in 6066 and uh how the years have gone but I thank the Lord you know like I said tuon we used to come here with the brothers and saying and uh met people like Mike catcher and different ones that we got to know along the way then one by one we gain the portal there to dwell with the immortal someday they'll ring those golden bells for you and I I want to I want to be I I know I'm you know I don't want to act like I'm some kind of a Great Hero I just don't want to be a coward when that comes I'd like to rest so in the Lord say Lord I have waited for this glorious moment the changing of address I want to read Ephesians if I could Wednesday night we'll do it quick but I know that one word spoken in due season is better than a thousand spoken out of season so let's read the word if you would why don't you stand with me I'm going to read Ephesians the 2 chapter and I'm going to drop in just a little bit because I uh round the eth verse and uh draw just a few words from there I love that part how he begins there and uh says for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any of of any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus I like the way he puts it it's not about Christ Jesus or perhaps around him but in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them wherefore remember that ye being in time past Gentiles In the Flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time ye were without Christ I want you to just just listen to this very closely being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of Promise could you imagine this evening if you here you didn't have one promise to you not one Covenant belonged to you to me I couldn't base one thing upon anything that it is promised I couldn't say that there was nothing promised to we were Gentiles we had no hope look what he says that in that time ye were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel strangers from the covenants of Promise having no hope without God in the world do that make you want to cry out said oh God how merciful but now now in Christ Jesus ye have become ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ for he is our peace who hath made both one ha broken down the middle wall of petition between us having abolished I like that word in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of Twain one new man Soul making peace and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were a far off and to them that are nigh for through him we both have excess by one Spirit unto the father now therefore we are no more strangers or foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God I like that and I built upon on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together the growth unto a holy Temple in the Lord in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the spirit God bless his word as you're seated I I just wanted to read that as a good foundation and and maybe just uh uh pick up one little quote if I could that uh brother Bram so beautifully declares and I know you've all uh undoubtedly have uh read it many times and uh but it's in one of the invis invisible Union and uh brother brah makes some wonderful comments concerning the reality of what the Holy Spirit has been doing all through life he his grace and let me just read it and you'll understand he said oh the spiritual union of Christ and his church now when the flesh has become word and the word is becoming flesh manifested Vindicated just what the Bible said would happen in the last days it's happening day by day he said why it's accumulating so fast out there in the desert and things taking place that I couldn't even keep up with it we're near the coming of Jesus Christ now not the appearing the coming changing of the bodies we've been living under the shadow under the presence of the appearing all these the pillar fire still leading the CH the the elect lady brother B says when it leaves we leave Amen to be United with the church where the word becomes the word call of the Holy Spirit searching the hearts you're standing completely you never sin in the first place I just let it let it soak into your heart now you don't have to do anything if you if you just say something you feel like saying Oh Me Oh My yeah that's me that's what I like to do now I'm reading to myself here I'm standing complete I've never sinned in the first place say oh you're not bragging no you've never said God don't even know now here's a little comment somebody should get get pretty excited about but from period to period it says God doesn't even know nothing that's how some people interpret the message sometimes now that's I'm reading it here God don't even know nothing wait a minute he doesn't know nothing about our sin it's in the sea of God's forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and a daughter of God you're standing there washed and your old book of divorcement is put out of the way and it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God now who's going to who's going to point a finger if he says they did this they did that this I don't even I don't even know what you're talking about remember that little song they used to sing and uh I forget the words but it said you know the devil stood before him accuse the accuser and come before the Lord and he said and the man had made the man woman had made it right with the Lord and confessed her sin and and the the Lord said back said what sins are you talking about I don't see any M You're The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Jesus Christ now if we are Christians today tonight if we are Sons and Daughters of God we know we've repented we've been baptized we believe this message and the Absolut is to Absolut is to believe every Vindicated word in this day when God vindicates his word makes it live again not Reformation but restoration being restored back to the original Faith amen you're the precious virtuous sinless son Son of God standing with the pure unadulterated word bride or bride word that he Washed by the Water of his own blood that become flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestined in the bosom of the father what did Jesus say I come from God and I go back I come from the Boos of God I go back to God where do we go back to where we came out of predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was he was the great attribute of God Called Love whatever you are you are a servant of God whatever God wants you to do where you where your place is God placed you in the church someplace Apostles and Prophets teachers and pastors I like what brother Braham said and I believe this is the truth you say why am I going to church here I like the way brother Braham said find yourself the most spiritual church and go there support it with all your heart your finances your prayers whatever you can do then don't criticize the other one that's a good one to be don't you know it doesn't make us any bigger if we criticize somebody now criticize sin and unbelief as the doctrine comes along the message I'm not saying you oh well they're all nice people no they're not all nice people Satan's not a very nice person sir he is a deceiver and his whole program is deception he has never forced or raped anybody he just makes them willing he is that's what happened to Eve happened to Eve he tricked her deceived her look at the prophet when he comes to this last day I indict this generation for what for the second crucifixion of the of Jesus Christ not the blood the blood word They Crucified the effect of this word to the people so that if they could have been saved they didn't even want that oh no whatever you are you're a servant of God whatever God wants you to do where your places God places in the church some Apostles prophets teachers he placed that by virtue of his own predestination and you were that to begin with I like how brother bam said so many times we think oh I can't be this oh if I could be like that he said if you're a humble housewife a farmer maybe don't have one spirit spirital gift you come to church all your life I've I've I've been I was raised in this church among men andite people hardwork and farming people sometimes you don't have to know when a certain person came into the the church you could smelling he just came out of the hog Barn before he check his final hog see how they were doing before he came to church it was my uncle nobody if he came in after on a Wednesday night you always knew when he came in he couldn't smell it cuz he was just part of the Hogs you know I like what brother said sometimes you know we we smell alike you know and we and that's why we talk alike and we eat the same food and we act like we're just we're just Humble Home people just love the things that God loves you know pastures with you shepherd with a sheep you know he's not sitting up there in some rocking chair all you know like in oh there goes my sheep there goes my sheep no he goth before them he walks with us he talks with us a little while the world will see me no more but you'll see me for I will be with you even in you oh I know we sing about him being with us and so on that's wonderful but it's greater for him to be in you do you know brother Bram says when he quotes that scripture greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world he said did you know that the one that's in you as a real believer has already overcome all sin over overcame all sickness overcame all doubt all fear he that's in you is greater he said he that's in you is already overcome that in you all we have to do is recognize that he's the Overcomer whatever you are that by The Virtue by predestination you are that to begin with oh I like this your first wedding is an old it was you never done it remember brother Braham said I'm taking going to predict the message sound like I'm preaching on Mar and divorce he said but the first husband must be dead before you could be remarried or married again he takes it to the church your old husband denomination has to be dead before before you can marry The Virtuous word Son of God and he said in the first place because there's only one thing could do it that would be God come down himself and took your place in the form of the Son of God Jesus Christ and washed you by the water of the washing of the word by the word Water by the word the word not the denomination the word washed you but if you want stand in the water of the word now here's the warning anybody that won't stand in the water of the washing of the word how can he wash you how can how can we be washed you're still as spotted as Eve was dear dying lamb thy Precious Blood shall never lose its power till all the ransom Church of God be saved to sin no more what is sin sin is unbelief unbelief is what the word unbelief in God which is the word that's it sometimes say well I don't understand it just say I believe it anyhow in fact I doubt very much that too many of us understand very much at all how would we even explain the Eternal thing of God you know when I sometimes I get a little bit I try to be funny it's not always funny but wife and I were driving and we were going to Ohio in Spring and we've been driving for for 3 days and uh I was kind of wanting to talk and and uh she was a little sleepy but I I started talking and so she she listened and I said isn't it funny I said just think for three days I've been driving east and I'm still not getting there wherever I am there I am it's still not west east north or south and I said we keep driving and driving and never going over said how come we're always up never down how come north the they don't change I said by now we should be leaning over this way because we're going downhill here I said well I don't know how the Chinese Drive even while we're driving here in the daytime they're hanging upside down that's about how we would look at that's about how I look I'm not include you all but that's how I look at at the word of God how do you explain the Eternal gravity of God how do you explain the way of the spirit how he Woos so one one person sitting right next to you and one person gets it another said I don't know what he's talking about we don't control that nobody controls that that's sovereignty of God and God ever reveals himself to you there's nothing can never change it you no no one can take it from you no one can preach you out of it or into it you know what I can't preach you into it no Pastor can do that he can only preach the word and say God there they are if it quickens to them it says amen within the soul said that's good that's a place to start but what but but you we we don't understand take the simple thing of the globe round oh I know science would explain it so beautifully but how is it created so perfect that you that you're never out of place you just keep on going flying you fly around the world come back again and you're up all the time just keeps moving oh yeah right so does the word of God how do we explain Revelation how do we explain Faith it's impossible if you could explain it it's not Faith but when you can explain said God said so I believe it that settles it if God says anything calls it the pure unadulterated oh Hallelujah leaving soon for the skies it goes un like that now that's a great mystery isn't it how these bodies are going to say well I know he can heal but change the complete chemistry of a body make it so that it can walk through the walls it can eat Jesus said have you got any fish here any food he ate the food what happened to the food when he went through the wall disappeared it was substance here explain that one that's the reason we don't explain it said Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible and brother Braham said if you will confess with the god in you who has done the overcoming with you confess that and say Lord I believe you've already overcome this sickness you've already come this temptation Amen in me now work it out through me you'll look with a different eye you'll see with a different heart when you look through God's word and see things as they are you know the whole picture changes you can look past the beautiful things of the world that are so enticing that's what I love about what the Holy Spirit does the one thing you be assured if God ever puts the Holy Ghost on you the desire of sin is gone that's something that leaves I didn't say the temptation of sin I said the desire for that's what he takes away that's the reason why say well oh but you know what you would have go over here their Church they allow this and they allow that the desire of unbelief is gone amen no church holds the right to any part of God's word for themselves for it is to the one that will believe it amen no Pastor has the right to hold people by his own but lead them to the word and there anchor them and if he anchors them in the word you know they're going to hold their ankle or hold let me just close here with this pure unadulterated said leaving for the sky soon standing ready think your garments Washed by the Water of the bleeding word the word became blood the word bled for you and you are washed in bleeding word and the word bleeding the life of God in the word and the Word was bled for you and you might that you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes and be cleaned and Sanctified by the washing of the Water by the word and makes you make your mind and your heart stay on God and on his word oh I like that now how you know it's true God when God comes down and vindicates it and proves it church we are building every step that we're taking on a Vindicated word of this hour I hear Brother Braham stay so many times stand there and said I challenge the world over to come and stand with me upon the scripture here and see if God won't confirm his word in fact you did many times but you know what he left it off later you know why he didn't do it cuz that judgment wasn't to be then but they're coming to it let's we close here we're all the same said well you say well I don't believe that I don't believe it's that way they didn't believe that Jesus way either but God proved it they didn't believe it Noah's way they didn't believe it in Moses way they was willing to take balam's word for it right we're all the same so let's just associate together no let me tell you this separate yourself the Bible says from unbelief amen from unbelief no we're not all the same do you know that the prophet said very plainly said it's not given for everybody Jesus himself proved it constantly in his word how he proved it when he walked on the on the Earth but when he had finally got to the place where he knew his ministry is changing he began to say such strange things that just literally stumbled the people so much so that they they called him a cannibal said except you eat the Flesh of the Son of God and drink his blood you have no part of him now what would those people of the theologians of that day and the ones that were wise and and understood and studied all the ways of they claimed the spirit now to become eating human sacrifice why it was the furthest thing away from reality but I like what brother B said Jesus never explained it he said he does that to shake off sometimes say oh we want our church to grow shall we everybody wants to see Sinners saved everybody wants to see great move of God everywhere but remember you one thing you will you know search the scripture if watch the last part of brother Bam's Ministry he said you're going to see a falling away winding down oh I know around the world now because of the internet we know everywhere and there's God done Mighty work in the last 50 years with a message that's already pure and they've this pure word has went around the world and pick up the elect lady there's nothing been added in the last 60 years to this messag amen it's catching that elect lady and every country Nation Kindred people and tongue and when they see it they come over here and preach the same message if they put their own Thoughts with it you'll find out real quickly and they do just like we have I'm say we I'm talking about we here on nor in North America how many people have taken this message and totally confused it and wound it right back down to where it's lost its Grace lost its power lost its reality become a man-made outa Hallelujah you notice you're not only that but you're going to the wedding in the sky and you are wearing the wedding band of predestination oh my so you see actually that's not very nice sometimes you don't like to make too hard but without being in the book before the foundation of the world it'll never be saved say well who are they no one knows except when the word strikes you for the scripture says and you hath he quickened Ephesians Made Alive we could read a little further there you hath the quickened there's a many isn't quickened look at the seed Jesus speaking about the seeds the word falling on different grounds but there's only one kind of a condition that brought forth of its kind right it was soil prepared for the seed but the Rocks the Briars the thistles each one declared itself but listen how ends it up he said but you are wearing the wedding band of predestination unmerited Grace a wedding band of Grace unmerited of your own God did it himself he knew you would he knew you before the foundation of the world so he slipped the wedding band on you there put your name on the book what a Thanksgiving Hallelujah says praise be to God isn't he wonderful that's what I believe with that's that's what my encouragement is to the assembly here we're not confused we're not preaching something that we don't say oh while you're beaten there Paul said no he said I'm not just beating I'm not just standing here with and you know act like some kind of a acrobat and try to be somebody great and so on impress people right amen if there's any impression to be done Let It Be by the blood-washed word that'll impress you so much you'll say oh as for me in my house we'll walk in this light this glorious light shine all around us by day and by night Jesus the light of the world this Mees in itself I love the way the prophet said it you know how he how he took the the the message and he said this message is that which will bring to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine this message in itself predestinated I love that part predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as Jesus was that makes us the Overcomer said you know the scripture Revelations to each age he had one final word to each age he never said much good about the last one in fact he found nothing that he could say except one thing to him that overcometh this is the age of all deception a nation and a world you can see right now it's not men deceiving men it's God allowing it's the nature of the seed now you see when you were quickened that made didn't make you a seed that showed the seed laid there to be quickened the baptism of the Holy Ghost doesn't make a seed it quickens the seed makes us alive isn't he wonderful
