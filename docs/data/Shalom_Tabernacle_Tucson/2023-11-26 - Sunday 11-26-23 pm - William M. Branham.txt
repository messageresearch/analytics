bless you we had some visitors this morning they brother John sure seem to enjoy themselves maybe more than some of us I think brother are used to be homeless I think and and brother Doug visits with us and he's probably brought more visitors my wife and I were saying than any of us so God bless him for it and Dorothy it looked like was really enjoying herself so it kind of helps me enjoy myself more so you know what I'm saying so that was good we had another visitor in the back I didn't get to talk to him but just real nice um to do that of course we have Nathan and Melissa God bless you I'm sure you're enjoying Mom and Dad in the warm weather so appreciate you all tonight one other little thing brother Israel might get in in trouble for doing this but brother Joe will get in less trouble Maybe maybe and that's our lovely Aaliyah has a birthday today we're so thankful for her we praise the Lord for her very faithful and blesses us and the Lord with music and we appreciate our sister tonight so with that brother Tim we've been you know brother isel's been talking about the firstborn before the meetings and then they continued if you'll notice with brother whisper the different ones with the Z zer Bell the the what brother Brown he called it the pyramid message I looked it up today he called it the pyramid message three times that might be significant I don't know he also called it the pyramid message five times I think or at least there's a quote five times probably insignificant but brother Israel said we should do the birth pains tonight so I'm really looking forward to continuing and building upon what he's talked about so be good to hear a portion of that we won't get it all tonight we'll cut cut it just for the sake of time the first part of that you'll remember brother Brown talks about brother Victor Leo a translator and in the beginning of this message be good to go back and hear it I kind of read through it and when you read it you've heard it so many times you can almost say the it was a prophecy that he translated about uh brother Bram the message and in the last words or something about the love divine and we appreciate that so much so make sure you read that look into that and all that we'll also cut a little bit off the end but this is also the message you're very familiar with that part where brother Brenham is a new Bible and the pages stick together so we hear that that's where we'll we'll start and it's just really neat there's a lot of significance to that as you know where the Lord you know in the scriptures quoted half half of the a scripture there and so we'll have part of that um we won't get into all of it but we'll start the tape right there in the scripture so if you'll stand with us we'll sing the theme song and get right into birth pains tonight only only believe that all things are possible yes when we only believe only believe only believe all things are possible only Bel let's remain standing and brother Brandon will read the scriptures in St uh John's gospel the 17th chapter and beginning with the 20th verse I wish to read for um a text I think that is right neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their words that I believe I have got the wrong place excuse me just a moment I'm looking for Jesus prayer that or not Jesus prayer rather but for his U I might have got marked down here on my text something wrong it's where Jesus prayed that or was saying that as a woman in travail for birth of her child birth child birth is that Luke or John Jack which is that even 16th of John I thought that was right but it didn't sound very much like it the 16th of John 21st verse sure 21st verse sure here we are John St John 16 and 21 that they may be no brother Jack that's still wrong ver 16 16:21 I got the 16th chapter of St John 21st verse but it Am I Wrong woman it well there's a mess in this mix in this Bible yes it wrong they printed it wrong yes sir you know what that's exactly the truth here's a brand new Bible I've just gotten it and it's got It's got the it's printed wrong just just draw a breath there's a reason why it was done and you God will show you bring out this wonderful all thank you thank you very much 16:21 thank you very much that's true a woman when she very verely I say unto you that you shall sleep weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful your sorrow shall be turned to Joy a woman when she in is inail has sorrow because her hour cometh but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remember no more anguish anguish for joy that a man is Born Into the world thank you very much my brother I sure appreciate that now that certainly is the misprint in the Bible page has been put in wrong and I just found it on my old old scopio Bible and picked up this one and run up here with it just few moment SC calls my wife just give me this for Christmas present now I want to to speak this afternoon upon a subject that I announc birth pains now that sounds very bad but it's in the Bible I believe that Jesus year was speaking of as he said you will have uh sorrow but your sorrow shall be turned to Joy speaking to his disciples here knowing that the birth of the of Christianity was coming into existence and now the old has to die in order that the new is born to have anything that gives birth has to have Pains of distress and they certainly was going to go through a pain of distress and anguish to get from the law unto Grace normal natural birth types the spiritual birth all things of the natural is types of the spiritual and um we find out if we look out here on on the ground and see a tree in the earth growing is struggling for life that goes to show that there is a tree somewhere that doesn't die because it's a it's crying out for something we find people no matter how old how sick what condition they're crying out to live because it shows there is a life somewhere where we live live forever notice how perfect now in 1 John 5:7 I believe it is if I'm not mistaken it said there are three that bear record in heaven the father father the word and the Holy Ghost these three are one there are three that bear record in Earth that's water blood and spirit and they agree in one now notice the first three are one the second three are Earthly which agree in one you cannot have the father without the son you cannot have the son without having the Holy Ghost but you can have the water without the blood and the blood without the spirit I think to our ages has proved this to be true water blood spirit justification sanctification the baptism of the holy spirit that types or makes the or antitype which takes away from the natural birth look on a a woman or anything intervail for birth the first thing comes to pass the breaking of the water a normal birth second thing is the blood and then comes Life water blood spirit and that constitutes the normal natural birth and so is it in the spiritual realm it's water justification by faith believing on God receiving as your personal Savior and being baptized second is sanctification of the spirit that God cleanses the spirit from all uh elements of the world and the desire of the world and then the Holy Spirit comes in and gives New Birth and fills up that Sanctified vessel for instance like this that I told you what you don't believe lay aside and then take the pine notice now a glass is laying out in the chicken yard you don't just pick that up and put on your table and fill it up with water or milk no but picking it up is justification cleansing it is sanctification calls the Greek word sanctifies a compound word which means means cleansed and set aside for service not in service for service then when you fill it it is put in service excuse this now not to hurt that's where you Pilgrim Holiness nazarin failed to walk on up into Pentecost you was cleansed by sanctification but when you were ready to put in service by the gifts of speaking in tongues and another thing you turned it down drop back out in the pen again see now that's that's what happens at all always does that now not to criticize you now but just I I want to get this off my heart and it's been burning me ever since I've been here so I might as well just if Carl's Grace and Deus and them and your alls I I'll try my best to deliver my soul from it see that's up to you normal typing the spiritual now we find out then and it's fully born when the baby usually now when the water breaks you don't have to do very much about it and when the blood comes you don't have to do much about it but in order to get life and the baby you've got to give him a spanking to make him yell out and um that's uh now without education as my brethren here are so well trained to it there's but I have to take nature to type it and there you are that's what happen at taking a real spanking to get this to them now you take a little some kind of a shock maybe wouldn't have to spank him but just shock him a little the very idea of him being born sometimes will do it grab him Shake him you don't start breathing spank him a little and then he yells out and unknown tongues to himself I guess but anyhow he he's making a noise when I think if a baby is born just by by still birth with no sound no emotion that's a dead baby that's what's the matter with the church today the system we got too many stillborn children right they need a gospel spanking you see and so uh to wake them up to bring him to themselves so that God can breathe the breath of life into them and now we find that that's so true it's crude theology but it's the truth anyhow so notice in a seeds birth the old seed must die before the new one can be born so therefore death is hard anytime so it's painful it's distressful uh birth is the same because you're bringing life into the world and it's it's painful Jesus said that his word was a seed that a sar went forth to SW now we're all acquainted with that and I want to teach this like a Sunday school lesson because it's Sunday notice then this uh word being a seed but remember the the seed is only bringing forth a new life when it dies and that's the reason it was so hard for those Pharisees to understand our Lord Jesus Christ because they were under the law and the law had was the word of God In seed form but when the word was made flesh and become not law but Grace now Grace and law cannot exist at the same time because Grace is the far above law laws not even in the picture and therefore it's so hard hard for the Pharisees to die to their law so that Grace could be born but it must go the two laws cannot exist at the same time there cannot be a law says that you can run this seore and the other says you can run it one says you can one says you can it has to be one law at a time maybe one time you could have went through it caution go through it but this time it's red stop and so there cannot be two laws exist at the the same time now we notice that always my thought now to you it takes pain distress discomfort look how them Pharisees died to that law through pain distress discomfort but it must be now we find that rain which brings forth fruit upon the Earth it's bned as the PO said in the fields of thunder and a ragged Jagged Skies but if we didn't have the Thunder and the Ragged Jagged Skies the little distilled drop of rain that's been lifted from the Seas and distill from the salt it would not be born it takes that lightning thunder blast ragged rugged fearful thing to bring forth the soft petal drops of water it takes pain to bring forth birth it takes dying and as the clouds die rain is born because rain is a part of that cloud one has to see so the other one can exist my brethren here some of them was able they could give you all the laws of those things I can't now let's drop over to another thing just for a little proof I think one of the prettiest flowers everybody has their own ideas of them but I think the prettiest flower that I've nearly ever seen is back in the East our Pond Lily how many you ever seen a Pond Lily oh there's just nothing like it to me but did you notice what that Pond Lily had to be I think of what Jesus said consider the Lily how it toils and spins but yet I say unto you that Solomon in all of his glory was not arrayed like one of these for Solomon's glory and his arrayment was all artificial but the Lily in its beauty is life that's making it beautiful not some artificial uh smear on paint on just just like our women I don't think you have to have all this green you know and ey wiers you know out like that and all that manicure or not I get that stuff mixed up all on your face to make you pretty pretty is as pretty does if you'll add a little Acts 2 and 4 mix it all up together a little John 3:16 it'll be anything that Max fact ever did try [Applause] to your husband will love you more everybody else will I'm sure God will Lily he said consider it how it grows toils has to bring itself up this Little Pond Lily look where it come through dirt muff mud Muddy Waters dirty Waters pressed its way through all of that this little germ of Life working itself from the bottom of the pond where the frogs and and things are at and then brings itself up through all of that but when it gets in the presence of the Sun it's born the little seed burst open into life it cannot do that until it goes through all that process it's got to come through that that's what makes it is because that the sun itself is what's drawing it and when it gets fully above all the dirty Waters and muck and so forth then it's so happy it just gives its life out freely and it's a beautiful life when it gets in the presence of that which is drawn it up I think that's a beautiful type of Christian Life when something is drawing you out of the world until one day you're born right into its Presence by the Holy Spirit how beautiful if you try to help it you kill it like a little chicken when it's being born you know if you ever notice one of the little fellas right on top of his little beak or any bird that's born from an egg it's it's got It's maturing this old egg shell the old inner parts of the eggs has to to rot away and it has to take this little beak and scrape back and forth Until It Breaks the shell out we call it pipping its way out down in Kentucky where I come from piping his way out they've never found a better way why it's God's provided way you try to help him you kill him pick the shell off of him you'll die see he's got to labor strain Break Forth that's the way a Christian has to do it ain't somebody just shaking your hand take in you got to lay there till you die Ro and are born into the kingdom of God it's God's provided way you don't go in by book or Shake hand and jar pump up pull down you you just simply uh had to get away from the old Shell notice no better way have they ever found they found no better way for a baby to get What It Wants besides God's way for yes now when that little baby's born you could um set a bell down here Bes side his little crib say my little son I am a a theologian in the way I've read books on how to raise a baby and I tell you you're a modern child you've been born in a modern home by a modern parent when you're hungry or need mother I just ring the little bell it'll never work the only way that it can get what it wants is the cry for that's God's way and that's the way that we get what we want is cry Far Cry out don't be ashamed say I'm hungering for God don't care where the deacons pastors or whatever it is around scream out anyhow the Joneses are sitting there what difference does it make cry out that's only way there is to get it until you get help he taught that when he was here on Earth you know about the unjust Jud a little do drop I don't know the farmer of it maybe there' be a science share I'm go to say way I think it might be a some kind of a congested group of atmosphere come together in a dark night and it falls to the Earth and when it does it's borned in the night but in the morning it's laying there cold and shivering on a little uh blade of grass or hanging on your clothes line but just let the sun shine out once did you notice how happy it gets it just glistens and quivers why it knows that it's that sunlight is going to draw it back to where it was at the beginning and so is every man or woman that's born to the spirit of God there's something about it when light spreads over us that we're happy because we know we're going back to where we come from from the bosom of God can Sparkle with joy when the Sun hits it of course KN it's going the where it come from Little crude things but we could keep on with them but let's find something else we know the old seed is must before the new seed can come out of the old seed it must rot absolutely not die only but rot after its death we know that to be true that's the same thing in New Birth we never go back but we go forward when you're born again and that's why I think today we have so many uh not so many rather genuine New Birth is because the seed is maybe of sympathize with the word or the person but they don't want to rock away from the old system that they were in they don't want to come out of it they want to stay in the old system and claim the new birth or the message of the age we found that under the Luther Wesley Pentecostals and all other ages they still try to hold on to the old system and claim this but the old system age must die rough in order to bring forth the new one they still want to claim notice they know the old system is dead but they just don't want to rot out of it now rock is what it really is done away with when a a claim is made that they are newborn but a claim is only a begotten sign rotten brings forth the new birth got to rot away from it just as we did in all ages through the wesling and all fourth but the thing of it is after that new Perth is born Wesley or Luther came forth with one word the just shall live by faith well he could not no longer cling on to the old system he had to come out of it and then when the calvinist got the angelan church in such a condition under the calvinistic doctrine until God raised up an Armenian Doctrine which was John Wesley the old system had to die in order for the new to come on and when Wesley's age ceased and all the little ages or blades that come out on the stock of the tosel in Wesley's time see when Pentecost come out with the restoration of the gifts they had to come out of Baptist Presbyterian Pilgrim Holiness nazarenes Church of Christ socalled and all that they had to come out of it R away from it to accept the new birth you're always called crazy but it's as like Paul said when he rot it out of what he once he said in the way that's called heresy that's the way I worship the god of our fathers in the way that's called heresy see it accepted the new life that the Old Testament had give birth to the new and he had to rot away from the old just make it a shadow in order to be that's just where we are at now now bear with me me but that's my idea the churches has got so systematically till you can't get into one unless you belong to one you've got to have a fellowship card or some kind of a identification and by believing this the only door I really have open is these businessmen and as long as they're not an organization I can go in with them but and get the bring the message that I feel that's on my heart to the people but it's not so systematic saying I love you Pentecostal people and Pentecost is not an organization anyhow you just call yourself that Pentecost is an experience and not a denomination but you see the thing of it is is so hard for many men when they look at it and believe it and see it so identified by God in the word yet it's so hard to rot away from that thing you've been in what would I do where did I get my meal what God is your meal meal God is a thing for you to hold on seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness I'll leave it lay at that you know what I'm talking about we are told by God's prophets that we are to have a new Earth a new Heaven and a new Earth if you want scripture that is revelation 21 I can quote it before you have it here John said I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first heaven and first Earth was passed away it was gone now if we're to have a new Earth the old Earth and the new Earth cannot exist at the same time or the new world the old world cannot exist at the same time there can't be two World orders together at the same time now in order to get the new Earth the old one has to die now if the old one has to die then it's giving birth pains for a new one now and then if a doctor went to examine a patient that was in labor now the one of the things that doctor would do which I'm talking in the presence of two or three I know of good medical doctors here Christian doctors and I I I would ask you this one of the first things that doctor does after he's been watching the patient is to time the pains birth pains he times the pains how close together and how much more terrific each one gets one is more harder to have than the other one next one still harder get closer together that's the way he diagnoses the case by the birth pains well if the world has to give away to the birth of a new world let's just examine some of the birth pains were're having on the earth and then we'll see about what day and it's about how far she is along in her labor yes the first world war showed great pain birth pains it showed one of the first birth Pains of her going into labor because of that time for her we had brought forth the bombs and we had uh uh machine guns and poison gas and you remember maybe many of you cannot was just a little boy of about 8 years old but I remember them speaking of this mustard and chlorine gas and so forth how this looked like a just get started and they said it would burn up the whole earth it kill everybody well it might be a a Breaking of that it's winds blowed across the Earth and how everybody was scared to death of that great weapon of poison gas the Earth went through its first birth pains and we find out now we've had had a second war world war and her pains was much greater more terrific all the time the birth Pains of the earth she almost had to give away during the time of the atomic bomb because it would destroy a whole city it was much greater than the Pains of the first world war of Destruction to the earth now she knows that her time of Deliverance is at hand that's the reason she's so nervous flustrated as she is is because that there is a hydrogen bomb and missiles of the air that could destroy the whole world one nation is scared of the other no matter how little it is they've got those missiles that they claim just one of them they can direct them by the stars and drop them anywhere in the world they want to Russia as I heard on news the other day she claims that she can destroy this nation and and keep the Adams or the things from breaking up her Nation we don't know what to do about it everyone's making these claims and it's so people's science has broke into God's Great laboratory until they're going to destroy themselves God let always let wisdom destroy himself God doesn't destroy anything man destroys himself by wisdom as he did at the beginning taking Satan's wisdom and instead of God's word now she knows she must give away she cannot stand it Russia I believe would destroy this nation today if she thought that she could destroy it and then preserve herself any of those little Nations could do it but they're afraid because they know that this world cannot stand in its orbit under such conditions so the world knows that her birth pains is so great she's got to give away there's going to be a new birth born at hand I'm thankful for that I'm tired of the this one any anyone knows that that here it's a place of death and sorrow and all kinds of discrepancies and so forth I'm glad that she has to give away I'm glad that time is at hand as John said of old even so come Lord Jesus now she must rot of course as I have said in order to bring new birth look what she's rotted into notice my brethren she's totally rotten her politics and systems is just as rotten as they can be there isn't a sound bone in her in her World Systems her politics and her religious politics and whatever it is one says I'm a Democrat I'm a republican I'm methodis I'm Baptist why the whole thing's rotten to the core got to be something give away she can't stand if you put a George Washington or an Abraham Lincoln in every County in this United States is still couldn't come back it's beyond Redemption there's only one thing can help her that's the coming of the Creator amen she knows she must give away she's in pain and distress one don't know what to do the one's looking this way and one that way and everything one scared of the other one trying to do something to destroy this and this and trying to contradict that and destroy the other until now they've got it in the hands of sinful man who could destroy the whole world and a 5 minutes time so she knows she can't stand it the people know she can't stand it and the world knows that they going to it's going to happen for God said it was the whole heavens and Earth's going to be on fire it's going to be a renovation of the whole thing so the new world can be born God has prophesied it she's rotten in all of her systems and she's got to do that to right away that's why she I said she's so nervous and red in the face and flustrated and earthquakes everywhere and up and down the coast and tidal waves in Alaska and shaking up and down the coast of earthquakes and things and people writing shall we leave it shall we leave it see they don't know what to do there's no safety zone but one that's Christ the son of the Living God and there's only one thing that is the safety zone and that's him all outside of there will perish this is certain as God said so now let's look at the doctor's book if she is in this kind of a condition and see if this is supposed to happen when the new Earth is to be born Matthew 24 in the doctor's book which is the Bible and let's see what's prophesied what are symptoms would be now if a doctor knows the symptoms of birth of a child and just about time the child's to come he gets everything ready because he knows that that is the um the time the child's to be born to C all symptoms shows the the water's broke the blood and now the it's time the child's dropped it's time for the child to be born and so he gets everything ready for it now Jesus told us just exactly what would take place just at this time he told us in Matthew 24 that the church true church and the other Church would be Church natural Church spiritual would be so close together impersonators until it would deceive the very elected if it was possible how that in was the days of Noah how this eating drinking marrying giving in marriage and all this uh immorality of the world that we see today the Bible the book the doctor's book said it would happen so when we see this happening we know that the birth is at hand amen it's got to be yes sir now we look at that as as a nation as not a nation but a world now Israel the church let's start back with her a few minutes and let's follow her for the next 10 minutes maybe Israel had birth pains under every Prophet that came to the Earth she had birth pains at his message for what did he do the prophet had the word and um and she had sown so much rottenness and made so much systematic orders in her being until this Prophet sh off of her foundation they were hated by everybody so therefore when God sent a prophet the church itself wanted to birth pains because the prophet the word of the Lord comes to the prophet and him only that is the word that's spoken for that day is made manifest by the prophet of that age always has been and the church has built so many systems around the word until he shuer off her rocker honey come she had birth pains what was it back to the word back to the life systems doesn't have a life it's only God's word has life the systems is filled around it well it does not have life it is the word that gives life his message rocked The Remnant back to the word a little group of come out believe sometimes maybe in no's time only about eight people but anyhow God rocked The Remnant and destroyed the rest of it had to rock away it did that all down Through the Ages until finally the church delivered to them a Manchild and that Manchild was the word itself made flesh in the beginning was the word and the word is with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us he conquered every devil every Power upon the Earth and that come against him with the father's word only every Temptation that Satan give him he rebuked Satan not with his his own powers that he had but with the word of God it is written it is written it is written for he was the word when Satan flew against Eve she wasn't the word so it failed when he flew against Moses it did the same thing but when he hid into this son of God he was 10,000 BTS that knocked the loose feathers out of him when he come back and said it's written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God there was that man child made flesh God's Eternal Word himself manifested in a body of Flesh here on Earth to represent the word that's how he know what was in their hearts that's how he could tell fil where he was who he was he could tell Simon Peter who he was told the woman at the well why he was the word yes right the Bible said in Hebrews the 4th chapter the word of God is sharper more powerful than a two-age sword uh cutting us Su even to the mar of the bone and a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart why those blinded Pharisee priests couldn't see that that was the word made manifest or they wrapped up into a priesthood and a system and the old system had had to give away it was the word but what have been promised had been fulfilled so if it's fulfilled it's got to run away it's the whole the seed went on Moses could not have brought Noah's message neither could Jesus have brought Noah's message because it was another age and the old seed was right but it served his purpose and was dead and gone on the transformation from the old to the new where the life was at was what was worrying the people what worries them yesterday name we're not building a wall like we start off with Luther's message go right down a straight line or Pentecostal message right we are turning the corners we're building a building God's word is the blueprint anybody can run a straight line but it takes a Mason to turn the corner it takes the power of God to do that it takes an anointed one from Heaven to be sent down to do that it has an every age in the prophet's age the world the Lord comes to those prophets and they turned those Corners made those difference but the builders wanted to build a wall it's not a wall at all it's a building a building of God now we feel and know that this is the truth that the systems was rocked in every age and every one of their systems had to root and die out until she brought forth that church out of that rotten mess came forth the word itself the word of the Lord come to the prophets never come to the priest it come to the prophets and notice and when it did finally that word all together was born here in human flesh the fullness of the godhead bodily rested in him he was the word the prophets is part of the word the word for their age we today are part of the word who follow the word but he was the entire fullness of the word he was the word yes he said when they was accusing him making himself equal with God because he was the son of God they said to him well you make yourself God he said isn't it written in your laws that you called those who the word of God came to Gods the prophets and they were then how can you condemn me when I say I am the Son of God where the fullness of the godhead bodily rested in the Son of God he was the full manifestation of God that's what finally the birth pains under those prophets while them being the word they pointed that fullness of themselves the fullness of the word and then finally the systems died away until the word was made flesh and dwelled Among Us watch How It Was portrayed in Jacob watch how was portrayed in Joseph exactly loved of his brother his father hated by his brother without a cause he was spiritual could fora tell things and interpret dreams he couldn't help being that he was just born that he was predestinated to be that but was hated by his brothers and finally sold him for 30 pieces of silver almost 30 pieces and was raised up set at the right hand of pharaoh look in his prison there was a butler and a baker one was lost and one was saved Jesus in his prison on the cross cross one was lost one was saved exactly then exalted into heavens and sat down on the throne of God and when he shall leave again there will be a sound go forth bow the KNE and every tongue confessed and when Joseph left the throne and started forward a trumpet sounded and every knee had to Bow Joseph was coming so someday the great Trumpet Of God shall sound the dad he Christ shall rise and every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess to this word but what's coming after what's he coming here for notice she brought forth this complete word which was made flesh under birth Pains of the prophets that blasted out he's a coming he's a coming he's a coming now but she was without a prophet for 400 years according to history and the scripture from Malachi until John they only had theologians priests pastors now here we can imagine without that what kind of a rotten condition her system must have been in 400 years without a message direct thus sayth the Lord from God so the priests prophets and so forth had got it into an awful mess she was rotten then John the promised Elijah of Malachi 3 not Malachi 4 Malachi 3 because Jesus said the same thing in in Matthew the 11th chapter when John's Eagle Eye got filmed over as I believe P's early ages expresses and he said go ask him if he is the one or should we look for another thing and he said Jesus after sending his disciples back after telling to stay at the meeting and watch what happened and go show John these things and bless his he not offended he turned and looked to the his disciples and the people he was speaking to you he said what did you go out to see when you went to see John he said did you go out to see a man and soft rment and he said I say unto you that's the kind that stays in King's palaces he said did you go out to see a h a reed that was shaken by the wind in other words every little thing come along he shook by it I'll tell you if you just come over join our group we can give you a better salary not John if you just won't preach against this and that well you can join in our groups not John said then what did you go out to see a prophet and I say you more than a prophet for if you can receive it this is he who was spoken of by the prophet saying I'll send my messenger before my face to prepare the way that's Malachi 3:1 not Malachi 4 at all that's a different because that Elijah come the world's to be burnt immediately and the righteous walk out on the ashes of the wicked now notice his message never stirred them very much from their ecclesiastical sleep they just said there's a crazy man down there passing by soon call himself crazy trying drown people down there in water why there's nothing to that old man why he don't even have on right kind of clothes he's got his sheep's getting wrapped around where he his PO his job's turkey why what Seminary did he ever come out of what Fellowship card we not even cooperate in his meetings we just let him stay down there and starve it out the world hasn't changed very much neither has the systems but we'll just let him stay down there he don't have any you know why he didn't remember his father was a priest but why didn't he follow the line of his father which was customed for the children to do in those days because he had something too greater a message he was to introduce the Messiah for the Holy Spirit had said so that little Rim that that had been brought back by the message of Gabriel down there knew that that would be so so we're told about 9 years old he went to the Wilderness after losing his father and mother that he went into the Wilderness because he had to hear exactly C in that great big theological uh building there that said now I know that you're supposed to be the one to announce the Messiah Isaiah said you was coming so you are going to be that voice now don't you think if brother Jones here just beats that just exactly and he'd be easily persuaded but he never learned any of their systems his message was too important he went out into the Wilderness to stay notice this message wasn't like a theologian he used types he said oh you generation of snakes calling those clergymen snakes the one of the bad things that he had found in the wilderness one of the sneaking things the snakes and he thought that's just about the best comparison I know he said you generation of bipers who's warned you from the Wrath to come don't begin to say we belong to this and that for God's able these stones to rise children to Abraham these Stones what he found in the wilderness and on the creek Bank also the axe what he used in the Wilder laid to the root of the tree what he saw in the wilderness every tree that bringeth forth not good fruit you know where he got his firewood see he h him down and cast Into the Fire make firewood out of it see his message wasn't a clergyman at all it was after nature in the wilderness but he had the message to announce and had the faith in his message to say that Messiah is so close to coming so he's right here among you now I say unto you there's one standing in the midst of you you know not whose shoes I'm not worthy to Bear he'll baptize with the Holy Ghost in fire who is he John I don't know but one day there come a young man walking down to the river ordinary looking man just old John the Baptist was standing over there the Blessed old prophet and he looked across the Jordan he said behold there's a lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world how do you know know in John he in the wilderness that told me to go baptize the water said upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit descending he is the word that'll baptize with the Holy Ghost this message couldn't come from a theological standpoint or some man-made Creed system and had to come directly from God well his message didn't Shake him very much they thought oh he said he saw that I doubt it very much I didn't see nothing looked all my I couldn't see nothing about it the priest them said but he saw it and we know now he saw it sure it is but you notice what it got it never stirred them out of their sleep they went right on cut his head off is the same but it it never stirred them but it did get the remnant the one that had the life in them that little Bunch an and and Simeon and a few of those that were waiting all for the coming of the Lord and Anna in the temple blind a prophetes that serve the Lord by prayers and then one day when she was in the spirit and Simeon had prophesied and said old man he said the Holy Ghost told me that I will not see death until I see the Lord's Christ well some of the priests you know said poor old fell just a little off you know why he's got one foot in the grave now and he doesn't sleeping well just let him alone he's been an honorable old man but he's kind of but you see what did he have it was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost that's the same thing that is revealed to you people this afternoon the Holy Ghost brought you here for some reason the some the Holy Spirit look at these priests and clch and here from Methodist Baptist Catholic and all they was moved by the Holy Ghost the hours here so the Holy Ghost moved on them and they've been looking for it hungering then just in a one day they don't didn't have television thank the Lord for that day so they uh they was down up on the hillsides of Judea there was a a baby born a star appeared and so forth but after 8 Days the mother brought the little baby in wrapped in swatling cloth it's swatling cloth I'm telling told that was a they didn't have nothing to put on it it was a a little uh rag off of a yolk of an ox I'm told that was a swalling cloth here come Joseph and man coming in with this little baby Out imagine the mothers stood back from a distance with their little babies with needle work and everything said look at there see see there she is see she was pregnant but that man here she comes in De stay away from her keep your distance they still think the same thing but Mary with that baby in her arms it didn't make any difference what they thought she know whose son that was so is every believer that accepts God's word into their heart I don't care what the system say you know what it is but the promise of God it was revealed to you by the Holy Ghost when you were overshadowed with his to you know where it's at no man has a right to preach the gospel until he's met God back on the back side of the desert and that burning bush where there's no ecclesiastical system in the world can explain it away from you you were there it happened to you I don't care what the system say you are a witness of it Hallelujah I feel like that colored man I talking about I ain't got room up here now see I feel very religious at this time when I think that that's right God himself revealed to you Simeon had the promise sitting over in his study that morning well I guess there might have been several hundred babies brought in every morning about 2 and a half million Jews in the country these babies come in many born every eight days the mother had to come offer offering for purification now here come Simeon sitting there you know maybe reading the scroll of Isaiah I don't know but all at once now if the Holy Ghost has made you a promise the Holy Ghost has got to keep that promise if it's really God he if he if a man comes to you and says a certain thing God doesn't back it up it isn't scripture to begin with forget it and if he says it so and God still doesn't back it up it's still wrong because God interprets his message he's his own interpreter what he says comes to pass then God said hear it for it's the truth that's only common sense if he says it happens and it happens that tells it it must be every time exactly the truth because God don't tell lies and so man here Simon steing there taking the persecution he was the remnant he' heard John and the little remnant of that day and here he was was sitting there uh listening to this scroll knowing I mean knowing that John was coming because he he was part of the rim that the word was revealed to him and all at once when that baby come into the temple that was duty of the Holy Ghost to reveal that it was there so he moved by the Spirit come out of the little study room right down to the hall hit that line of women coming right down along that line of women until he got down to where this little baby was is all standing away from picked up the baby in his arms said Lord let your servant depart in peace for my eyes have seen your salvation and at that time another one of the little elected in that day was Anna a prophetess she's sitting over there blind in the corner raised up blind here she comes led by the spirit among all the women and the people crowding out the temple till she come right straight to where the Christ child was if the Holy Ghost could lead a blind woman him what about a Pentecostal group that's supposed to have your eyesight I won't go any further you know from there on notice oh my how that that church must have been in an awful mess again it surely must have been in that day but it rocked the little Remnant as it said now let's be honest if we see that church in that condition today haven't we arrived at that time again now just look at the things that promise of the Bible that would be going on in the church at this time we see what's going on in the world and we see it's at its end now let's look at the church she the church had birth pains under Luther now we know these seven Church agents and seven Messengers to them Church agents according to Revelations now when Luther had to come forth it certainly throw the church into birth pain but it brought forth the Luther that's right after that it got in trouble again so it brought forth a Wesley that's right got forth again and it brought forth a Pentecost each of them messengers of their age Rock the back to the word the message of their age the message of according to the Bible I've got come in a book out on that the commentary the first four chapters of Revelations read it soon as we get it on press and it proves beyond a shadow of Doubt what Luther's message was justification what uh sanctification is the next process in the natural birth and then come the Pentecostals exactly now notice each age Rock the church and give it birth pains but what did they do after the birth Pains come instead of going on with the word they got a bunch of man together just like the first one did exactly right after the rocking of the apostles then we find her going off again then we find out Along come uh uh many of the others activist and many of the Great reformers back in the beginning each age done as you studied in PR Council and ni fathers all back you find it all in there each age was rocked every time a messenger come forth with thus sayeth the Lord now she is in the worst stage that according to the scripture that she's ever been amen we are in the lady oan Church age a rich but blinded Church age that don't know it there wasn't nowh in the Bible that Christ was ever put out of the church but the lady of sea age she's in the worst age she's the rottenest she ever was said I said do Queen have need of nothing and don't know that you're naked miserable blind poor and don't know it yes sir so I counsel thee come by I say for me that I might open your eyes and that'll that'll certainly the eyes save of God will certainly bring light to the church if it wants to open its eyes to what God has said notice quickly now now she is in that stage Beyond a out of doubt we're in the lady of sea church age now her messenger is Promised in Malachi the 4th chapter he's promised to do it and the message is to bring back the word bring the people back to the word birth is to be she's to be delivered of a new birth from According to Malachi 4 in the church world today there is two systems of work and now listen read your clo now see if you going to say Amen on this this there's two systems working in the church world today I'm going to get this off my shoulder and then I have it over with we all know that that's the word of God and the denominational system there is the two systems that work just as it was Jacob and Esau one after the spirit the other after the Flesh and what is it Esau and Jacob was fighting in the woms of the mother even to the time they were born and so is the denominational and the word fighting one against the other they have been since Luther first brought the First Reformation I hope that's simple enough that you can understand it these men if they pick up this and go out with it they can make more sense to it see to bring it to a place you would I just want to lay this seat hope they make it come to life notice see it's always been that that's the reason she's bearing birth pains because her there's a fight in her there's the Esau just the man of the world very religious and uh oh he's all right good fell clean moral as far as know but he don't know nothing about that Birthright he's born that way he's shaped that way and Jacob I don't care what he is he wants that Birthright he's the spiritual one and them two today is in the womb of the church there's a great big system trying to be formed called a world Council of churches and from the womb of the church is coming forth two children you just weren't my word the world the world word must deliver the word bride church the church has got to be delivered out of her a bride for Christ damn it fell asleep in all ages or make up that bride that come out on the word that they come out on like from your feet coming to your head she gets get greater and more you have to have and so forth as the body grows up so does the body of Christ grow up and then finally the head will come to it the head of it will now if we know it's C it's it's all linked to the head the head does a turning pulling but these systems will not grow out of that because it's a system and it cannot bring forth a cuckle BG cannot bring forth a bunch of wheat but they're both in the same field watered by the same water and the same sunlight one is the word one is not the word them two are fighting they've been fighting since the first reformation and they're still fighting now I don't have go any further on that do surely you know what I'm talking about there we are there you are system what system are you in just imagine now if you would have lived back in the other days under the Jing of God's prophets and words that come forth what side would you want to be on back there well you got the same Choice today she speaks to bring forth the perfect word back there and the words coming for the word Bride As a a woman is a part of a man taken from him so the church will have to be a word abiding church every word of the Bible not systems dogmas or nothing added to it it will have to be an unadulterated pure virgent word right in the days of the lot of Luther when the church B that Luther for you one under her pains but he come forth to shall live by faith this is not the communion now we find out under the days of John Wesley she gave pains again but there there's a Wesley barn but what did he do went right back like mother did and on the days of Pentecost was your father's mothers come out of that thing and hated it they went out on the street your mother with no stockings on that beating on an old tin Cannon talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and some old guitar they L out on the street cars TR stayed all night in jail and we were so starchy and went right back into an organization and made oursel the same muck that draw their children back then if they come out of they turn over in the grave they'd be ashamed of you I know that's hard but it's the truth you say I thought you love people if love isn't corrected then how can you produce love love is corrective and I do love the world I'm I'm zealous of God's church and to see these systems that binding it down on her dogmas and it's rotting it away God declaring his word to be the truth and still they hold on to it amen that's true you know it's the truth brother sister that's just that's a simple way of telling you it isn't a breaking down of Greek and things but it's the breaking down showing Common Sense surely you can understand that two and two is four see now we know that that's right now the word must produce the bride but but the old system has to keep its type it has to produce an Esau who sold his birthrights here it comes I feel it I hope you don't think I'm crazy well if I am let me alone I feel good this way I'm better this way than I was the other way I maybe to the I know where I'm at I know where I'm standing look it's going to produce a stillborn baby an ecclesiastical system is going to bring all the denominations together to produce a Esau that hates Jacob amen I hope you see it a still born dead denomination all of them going together oh word Believers give into my message hear me not my message but his message that he firmly declares to be the truth you've got to choose from somewhere you can't sit still after this You' got to make your choice remember the other day down to Westford hole there on that morning on that breakfast how the Lord let me show that wheat hats come up through Luther do Wes the tosel and so forth and little springs off every Church represent in a stock of corn then went right down into that wheat as it was and there was that little sh looked just exactly like the real grain of wheat when you go out and look at you don't know your wheat you'll say you got wheat there but it's just a Shu then you open that Shu up there's no wheat there at all way back as a little bud of Life coming forth you take a glass and look at it and when Pentecost first come out it was so close Jesus said in Matthew 24:24 it would deceive the very elected if it was possible what was it to do a support to the grain is that right now the tossel look here the blade doesn't look like the grain that went in neither does the tossle but it's a little more like it and the shook is a whole not like it but still it ain't the wheat it's a carrier of the wheat don't you see how those messages has come with birth pains but the life left right out there to go to the next message the life went right out of Luther into Wesley's message right out of Wesley's message into Pentecostal message now it's time again to leave the shook what's the matter there's nature in every form declaring that's a true now you see why you think I'm crazy maybe I am as I said but there's something in me I can't stop it I never put it there it never come to my own choosing it's God and he confirms it to prove that it's the truth to make it the truth not as I have anything against Lutheran Wesley Pentecostals or Baptist or whoever nothing against nobody the systems is what I'm against because the words against it not the man look at these priests and cl been sitting here today they wouldn't be here if they listen to the system but they had the common audocity of the word of God to to step out and accept it Hallelujah Hall means praise our god it won't hurt you mean so be it I believe it I believe and know that it's the truth it's confirmed to be the truth someday you find out maybe too late now watch watch the Bible said his wife has made herself ready at the End of the Age how did she make herself ready to becoming his wife and what did what kind of garment she had on his own words she was dressed in his righteousness that's what his right See Vision notice just closing I want to say this one thing just before closing that's what led me to say this thus sayith the Lord a man would say that without putting it in his own thinking he'd be a hypocrite and should go to hell for right if he'd try to get a bunch of people find people like this and deceive him why he'd be a devil in human flesh God would never honor him you think God would honor a devil or a lie never see it goes over the top of their heads and they don't get it he pulls the elected out look at all the prophets through the age how he got the elected look coming down through even to the Reformation like uh the Roman Catholic Church burnt Jon of AR to a stake for being a witch that's right later on they found out she wasn't she was the saint of course they done pen dig up priest body and throw them in the river but you know but that don't sett it in the books of God Amen no they call St Patrick one too you see and he's by as much as I am one so we notice look at his children look at his place up like how many killed look on the mology and see how many was killed there you see it isn't so but the claim of the people that doesn't make it so it's what God Said and proves that is truth prove all things hope fast to that which is good now we find out here about a a few months ago one morning I was walking out of the house and a vision came and I challenge anybody here that snowed all these years to say at any time that the Lord ever let me say thus sayth the Lord by what had happened how many knows this the truth raise your hand could anybody speak contrary it's true don't paying attention to the messenger look at the message you did that's what it is it isn't that don't notice the little baldheaded you know person because it's just a it's just a human being and we're just all the same but watch what's happening that's what declares it I was taken now I know people say all kinds of things and we know that a lot of it's not right I can't answer for what any man says I got to answer what I said and I can only say whether it's truth or not and I I I'm the one that has to be responsible for it not what somebody else says I can't judge no one I wasn't sent to judge but to preach the message notice I was to have a a preview of the church and I was taken by someone who I could not see and was set up on like a stand and I heard the sweetest music I ever heard and I look coming and a bunch of little ladies about look to be of all some age around 20 18 20 and they all had long hair and was fixed in different dresses type dresses and they were marching just as perfectly in step of that music as it could be and he went from my left going around this way and I watched him and I looked in to see who was talking to me and I couldn't see no one then I heard a rock and roll band coming and when I looked over to my right side coming up this way coming back here come the churches of the world and some of the each one carrying their Banner from where they were from some of the dirtiest looking things I ever seen in my life and when the American Church come up it was the awest I ever seen the heavenly father is my judge they had on these tattletail gray skirts like one of these barroom girls with no back on it up here holding up like a gray looking piece of paper and like hoola dancing paint short bobbed hair smoking cigarettes and twisting as they walked to rock and roll and I said is that the Church of the United States and the voice said yes it is and when they passed by they had to hold it like this and put the paper behind them when they passed by I I started to cry I just thought of all my labor and all that I've done and everything that we ministers has worked together and brother I I don't know how much you believe about these Visions but it's truth to me it's always proved to be true when I seen that annoying what was going on my heart like to broke in me what have I done how I miss could have stayed right with the word Lord and how could have done I thought why could you give me a vision not Longo and see me in there and I said well will they had to be judged he said Paul's group too I said I preached the same word he did Christian businessman carried the article of it and I said why why would it be like this and I seen that bunch of prostitutes going by like that all dressed up like that and call the church of Miss USA now I just painting and directly I heard that real sweet music come again and here come that same little bride coming by again he said this is what comes out of and when she walked by she's exactly like the one was in the first place walking to the step of the music of God's word marching on by and went out of sight I stood there with both hands up crying like that want to come to I stand on my porch out there looking around across the feet what she's to be the same bride the same kind build out the same kind of material that she was in the first place now read Malachi 4 and see if we're not supposed to have a message in the last days that'll turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers back to the original Pentecostal message word by word Brothers we are here now this church is supposed to get us sign and it's last sign we find out here in the in the in the scripture see now see the great birth pains has been in this lady
