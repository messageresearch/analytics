thank you for the songs of Zion that have gone forth and now Lord we come to the sacred part of the service Lord and it's your service it's your word and we look to you the Lamb of God to speak to our hearts tonight bless us as we prepare to our hearts to come to the table of the Lord and communion and foot washing fellowship with our brothers oh God let let not our coming be in vain Lord but speak to our heart is our prayer we ask in Jesus name amen amen God richly bless you so tonight we'd like to go right into the word I'll ask you to to stand and we'll turn in the scriptures to Revelations chapter 13 something's going on up here thank you Revelations thir first Beast whose deadly wound was healed and he doeth great wonders so that he maketh Fire come down from heaven on the earth and the sight of men and deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth by the means of those Miracles which he had power to do and the sight of the Beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the Beast which had the wound by a sword and did live and he had power to give life unto the image of the Beast that the image of the Beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads that no man might buy or sell say he that had had Mark or the name of the Beast or the number of his name here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of of the Beast for it is the number of a man and his number is 63 score and6 666 amen we'll take one more scripture in Revelations chapter 10 one of our favorite verses verse seven those that follow this great message but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets amen may God add a blessing to the reading of his word God richly bless you you may be seated you know this great image to the Beast that is rising up in the country now uh the prophet of God through prophecy and the understanding of the word shows us that that's this country in the hour and the time that we live in and as I said this morning we love our country we love what it stands for in many respects it's still the greatest country that the world knows I couldn't think of a better country to live in but the truth of it is that uh it has rejected God and it is been it has been indicted it can cannot repent and that's a that's a very strong thing to see someone or an individual that Cann not make things right they just can't do it and that's the case of our nation and so we are going to be playing the seventh seal on Sunday the Lord willing here but there's a portion that I'd like to play tonight and then I'll read out of the message uh Look Away to Jesus because he brings that afterwards um after he had opened up those seals deadly wound was healed and he doeth great wonders so that he and I think that was my voice huh it's all being recorded it's kind of shocking he said no I didn't do it well there's the recording you you're recorded and so we know there's a great recording the Reckoning time but to end of message the seventh seal I wanted to play this portion I believe it's paragraph number 269 somewhere right in there and uh just to give you a little background brother banam is explaining the cloud picture and how the Seven Seals came to us and so so I know it's I know it's so so good to hear it again and to get into it it's so deep and it's so rich that Pieces by pieces you can just get so much out of it and so we're going to do that tonight before we go to the table of the Lord all right amen thank you remember the consolation of the vision of the Angels when I left here to go to Arizona you remember what time is it Serv you remember that yes notice there was only one great burst of thunder and seven angels appear is that right one burst of thunder seven angels appear and I saw the lamb when he had opened the first seal and I heard as it was a voice of a thunder and one of the four beasts said come and see notice one Thunder seven messages that's been sealed up and cannot be revealed until the last day amen at this age see what I mean amen now have you noticed a mysterious part yes of this week amen that's what it is amen that's what it's been amen it's been not a human being a man it has been the angels of the Lord amen amen hallelujah notice there's Witnesses of three setting in

Vision see now to let you know brother sopan has not got the game that he went after was trying to get it for him and he said now tonight for sign to you he isn't going to do it you must conf

away from that tent like that is that right because this is what it was amen exactly what it was and knowing that I couldn't say it till happened to see if the people understand it and did you notice that one angel I said in there was a strange Angel you look more to me than any of the rest of them remember that they were in a constellation three on the side and one on top and the one right next

Angels was and it struck my hand and I looked and it was a sword yes and it had pearl handles amen real pretty and had a guard over it with gold and the blade looked like something like a chrome like silver on his real shiny and it was so feathered sharp oh my and I thought isn't that the prettiest thing that's fit my hand I thought that's awful pretty but I said hey I'm always freid of them things a sword I thought what will I do with that and just then voicey shook down through that that rocked the Rocks said it's the sword of the king amen and then I come out of it the sword of the

helpy God stand over his holy desk here with this holy word laying here it's the word amen amen oh what a day we're living in what a great thing see the mystery and secret the third sending there when this left me something has come to me and said Don't Fear now I didn't hear no voice like on the inside of me spoke I have just tell you the truth this is exactly what happened something hit and said Don't Fear this is that third pull third pull you remember he said you've had so many impersonators on this what you tried to explain I said don't even try this you remember how many remembers that Vision why it's all over tap and everywhere that's been about six years ago seven years ago been seven years ago said don't try to explain that said this is the third pool but I'll meet you in there that right he said don't I was standing with a a little baby shoe when he told me say make your first pull and when you do the fish will run after the lure said then watch your second pool said because it'll only be small fish he said then the third pool will get it and all them ministers got around and said brother Brown we know you can do it Hallelujah brother Brown that's where always get tied up with a bunch of preachers I love people they want you to explain everything this that and I said well uh uh I said I don't know I said I've understand fishing now I said now first thing you do here's what it's done you see all the fish around you got the jerk The Lure well that's exactly the tactics of fishing so I said jerk The Lure now I see when I jerk The Lure the first time now the fish takes out ad but they were little ones that's just like they were catching so then I I said D your and I jerked it out on the bank I had a fish but it looked like a skin over the lure it just he was so little and then I stand there and something said I told you not to do that I started crying all the line was Tangled around me like this I had was standing there crying with my head down like that I said God oh I forgive me I I'm a stupid person Lord don't forgive me and I I had this line and that what I had my hand was a little baby shoe about that long and I had that string was about as big around as my finger about a half inch line and the eyelet in this shoe was just about the size of a uh little than a uh 116th probably of an inch of the eyet and I was trying to lace this little shoe up with this great big inch card and a voice come said you can't teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things said now let him alone and just say he picked me up he took me up and set me way up high to where a meeting was going to look like a tent or Cathedral of some sort and I look there's a little box like little place over in the side and I seen that light was talking to somebody above me that light that you see there on the picture it Whirled away from me like that and went over to that tent and said I'll meet you there and said this will be the third pool and you won't tell it to nobody and in Sabia handed he said this is the third pool and the three great things that goes with it and one unfolded today or yesterday the other one unfolded today and there's one thing that I cannot interpret because it's in an unknown language but stand right there and look right straight at it and this is the third pole coming up amen and the Holy Spirit of God oh that's the reason all heaven was silent amen now I I better stop right here see I just I just feel checked not to say no more about it see so just remember the seventh seal the reason it was not open the reason it did not reveal it no one should know about it and I want you to know before I even note any word about that that Vision come years years ago do you remember that and here it is just as this other has slides right straight into the word exactly where it was and God knows my heart I never one time thought of such a thing as that am and here it was it's later than we think amen oh my this shows is from God for see it fits exactly in the promises of God from the end of the the message you notice notice now for the End of Time message the seal after all he he's revealed all the six seals but it don't say nothing about the seven and the end time seal when it starts will be absolutely a total secret according to the Bible before knowing that and remember Revelations 10 1 7 1: 7 chapter 10 1: 7 at the end of the 7th Angel's message all the mysteries of God Amen will be known we're at the end time the opening of the seventh seal now how did I know the other day last Sunday a week ago today when I was preaching on be humble be humble remember God deals in little things I didn't realize what it really was talking about and now I see it it is in such a humble way yes you'd think it something like that would be revealed to the Vatican or but it comes just like John the Baptist amen it comes like the birth of our Lord in a stable glory to [Applause] God we're here oh my now do you see it the truth of God's Vision the seven Angel bringing me from the West they were coming from the West Coming Back East bringing here for this message tonight oh my now the voice of that great Thunder and the mission that was brought here has been revealed that it and proven that it was of God you think now I knew not these seals and they've been revealed this week did anybody think of that of those seven angels being this being the message that was coming forth them Angels bring me back here for that remember the seventh messenger was the seven Messengers was the noted one to me the seventh angel it seemed more to me than any I see they were're standing like this we just want you to notice and I was standing here and I was watching those other see one first bunch of little birds feathers all beat down you remember them and they all flew Eastward and the second Bunch were brighter bigger birds look like doves pointed Wings they flew Eastward first pull second pull then the next was Angels am and it's I was standing right there and this explosion left and I was looking this way towards the west and they come and just picked me up in there and I went Plum out of my [Applause] knowing and the one of them coming was the one that looks so strange to me was the one on my beat the left where I entered the constellation at but counting from the left to the right it would been the seventh angel coming across now remember the seven Messengers do you remember the Pyramid of flight Rock of Junior Jackson's dream that I interpreted you notice the night that I left and uh there were six dreams came and every one of them directly to the same thing then the vision started and sent me West is junior he was watching well notice look how perfect I'm I'm hoping and trusting that you people realize that I'm trying to put this grace on Jesus Christ who is the author of all of it and the only reason you never heard me talk like this before in your life but this hour is approaching amen We Believe amen believe notice I to make it sure to you so it can be driven down I'm fixing to leave you again I don't know where I go I must preach the gospel other places bless Lord but now that you might say I've heard all that kind of fanatic I don't know why I can't judge any other man I only have to answer to God for what I for myself but has there ever been one time never told you anything in the name of the Lord it wasn't right in all these years nobody else can say so because I always told it just the way he told it now let me just show you that this is exactly true and confirm it now remember if there be a spiritual or Prophet I the Lord will speak to him in visions and make known to him by dreams interpret in dreams is that Joseph he can interpret dreams and speaking and see Visions is that true now notice this that now when this taken place Junior was standing in a field that had a had a big pyramid to it like that and there was something wrote on the rocks and I was revealing that to the people is that right Junior about a year before it happened and notice the next thing now I took some kind of a bar and cut it off and on the inside was White Rock that had nothing wrot on it and at that time I started to the west and I told them all I said don't go out west stay here and look on this till I return went West for the blast return back to the east with the Holy Spirit interpreted this Unwritten word amen hallelujah now if that isn't perfectly a God Almighty I want you to know what is what am I trying to say this for friend is to show you we're at the end time now if them others is perfectly on the dot with the word so is this perfectly on the dot with the word we are here we're at the end friends soon it shall be time run out Millions will lose their lives Millions will be at now believe that they are saved will be counted f for the atomic age we are living at the the last hour by the grace of almighty God by his help to his people that they might look forward to the soon appearing of Christ how long brother Brandon maybe in 20 years maybe in 50 years maybe in a 100 years I don't know and maybe in the morning maybe at the night I don't know and anybody says they do know they're wrong amen they don't know God Only Knows amen now notice so help me by God I tell the truth that these are spiritually discerned to me discerned by the Holy Spirit and by every one of them has identified its place in the Bible now what this great secret is that lays beneath this seal I do not know I don't know it I couldn't make it out I couldn't tell it just what it what it said but I know that it was in seven Thunders uttering themselves right close together just banging seven different times and it unfolded into something else that I seen then when I seen that I look for the interpretation it flew across there and I couldn't make it out that's exactly right see the hour is isn't quite yet far amen but it's moving into that cycle see it's coming up close so the thing for you to do is to remember that I speak to you in the name of the Lord amen hallelujah amen hallelujah be prepared or you don't know what time something can happen and praise the Lord how many thank God for his word that portion of his word amen that's the third pull brother random is talking about and he goes five months later in the message Look Away to Jesus and he gives us a time frame of the great squeeze and you see the church is going to put this persecution on the bride amen and we know that's going to take place we won't take time to read that but it's in that message Look Away to Jesus and I think that these are spiritually discerned uh things that we the bride of Christ should be into it's more it's closer today than it's ever been and our appetite and our desire and our heart looking on these things every time like I could study it study it and then play it every time I listen to it I get something more out of it just sitting here now just getting more out of it what the prophet is trying to tell us for what we have need of for the Rapture is laying in there amen so God richly bless you as we prepare to go to the table of the Lord if the musicians would come please trust that was a blessing to you and for you in 1 Corinthians chapter 11 see this great hour approaching my say Lord have mercy on us keep me true to your word Lord Jesus in verse 23 if we'll stand for the reading of God's word 1 Corinthians 11:23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as of as you drink it in the remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chased chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come what a a beautiful opportunity to obey the word of God As He commands us to do this till he comes and the examination is a self-examination and the Bible says let a man EX examine himself that's a man or woman boy or girl you examine yourself so that you're not taking the blood and the body of the Lord unworthily and you don't want to be guilty of that and those that are guilty of it are sick they're weak and they sleep they die a premature death and this death strikes it's not just a natur death it's a spiritual death and you see it across and you'll see behaviors that people engage in and attitudes won't make it right grudges issues and problems won't make it right we just get used to living that way because um there's no open rebuke you haven't been embarrassed in front of the congregation no one openly called your sin out that that you with repent but the Bible says let a man examine himself you say well Pastor why don't you point those things out why don't you preach on this why don't you preach on that let a man examine himself and you examine Yourself by taking God's word and looking at the word and don't make it don't try to make it fit what your circumstances just let it say what it says and
