[0:23] [music]
[0:38] with the U series on the Holy Spirit and
[0:42] this first one that we started was what
[0:44] is the Holy Ghost 1959
[0:48] December 16th. We'll start at paragraph
[0:51] 23 and end after 48 and this is from the
[0:55] book of Acts chapter 7.
[0:58] Let's all bow our heads in prayer.
[1:01] Heavenly Father, we're grateful to be
[1:03] here today.
[1:05] You are our Holy Spirit, Father. And we
[1:08] thank you for the word of God says you
[1:10] are our spirit. Lord, we pray that you
[1:13] just anoint everyone, the Sunday school
[1:16] children, the adult class, the whole
[1:20] service, everything that will be done in
[1:22] this house of worship this day. Father,
[1:26] we want to hear from you and we need
[1:27] more of you every day. Cover us in thy
[1:30] precious blood, Lord. Lord, if there be
[1:33] anything we Lord have neglected that we
[1:36] know we should do, we pray your
[1:38] forgiveness. Pray, Lord, that you just
[1:40] lean and guide us ever. Help us to see
[1:42] your word clearly, Lord, and to act upon
[1:45] it, Lord. We just look forward to this
[1:48] day. We'll give you all the praise and
[1:50] the glory. In the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:52] we ask it. Amen.

[2:34] possible.
[2:37] Only
[2:39] believe.
[2:41] You may be seated. Brother Brennham.
[2:46] Just like I was talking to our brother
[2:49] Jeff today
[2:51] and he said, "I would like to be at the
[2:54] meeting tonight, but I'll be there
[2:55] tomorrow night." He didn't know the
[2:57] meeting was going on because we didn't
[2:59] announce it just right here. Some of the
[3:02] brother Leo and them wrote to some of
[3:04] our friends and told him out of town.
[3:07] Well, because we didn't have room.
[3:11] Now,
[3:13] I said, "Brother Jeff,
[3:16] if you sent me down to turn on one of
[3:19] your oil wells
[3:21] and I didn't know nothing about it, I'd
[3:24] probably blow it up.
[3:26] I might turn the wrong key or start the
[3:30] wrong motor.
[3:32] I'd have to know how to do it before I
[3:36] did it." And that's the way with
[3:38] receiving the Holy Ghost. You've got to
[3:41] know what you are coming for and how to
[3:45] receive it and what it is.
[3:50] Now the first place the Holy Spirit has
[3:53] been promised we could take 10 weeks and
[3:58] never just skip the age of this subject
[4:02] what the Holy Spirit is. But the first
[4:05] thing I want to approach it just enough
[4:07] to give an outline each night. Then see
[4:10] the following night if there's any
[4:12] questions.
[4:14] How many in here has not received the
[4:16] Holy Ghost? Been baptized with the Holy
[4:18] Ghost. Raise your hands. You know you
[4:20] haven't been. Just look at the hand.
[4:24] Now [clears throat]
[4:28] I want to talk on it as a Holy Spirit
[4:31] being a sign
[4:35] for it is a sign. We realize that that
[4:40] all promises is given to us
[4:44] by Abraham
[4:46] was the father of the promise
[4:50] because God gave the promise to Abraham
[4:53] and to his seed after him.
[4:57] The promise is made to Abraham and to
[5:01] his seed.
[5:04] And this sign is to a covenant people.
[5:10] Now there is a vast difference [snorts]
[5:14] between just a Christian and a Holy
[5:18] Ghostfilled Christian.
[5:22] And now we're going to get this from the
[5:25] scripture and place it just exactly in
[5:28] the scripture. the first place there is
[5:31] a Christian professed to be a Christian.
[5:37] But if this Christian has not yet been
[5:41] filled with the Holy Ghost, he's only in
[5:44] process of being a Christian.
[5:47] See, he is professed to believe it. He's
[5:51] working to it.
[5:54] But God has not yet given him this
[5:56] spirit of the Holy Ghost. He's not yet
[6:00] reached that goal with God that God's
[6:02] recognized it
[6:04] because that God made a covenant with
[6:08] Abraham after he had called Abraham
[6:12] which is a type of calling the believer
[6:15] today.
[6:17] He called Abraham and Abraham
[6:21] moved out of his country and went into a
[6:25] strange land to dwell among strange
[6:30] people.
[6:32] And that was the type of when God calls
[6:36] a man to stop his meanness, repent of
[6:38] his sins, he turns then from the crowd
[6:41] that he was in to live in a new crowd.
[6:48] among new types of people.
[6:52] And then after God found Abraham to be
[6:55] faithful to the promise
[6:58] that God gave him that he would have the
[7:00] child and through this child all the
[7:03] earth would be blessed.
[7:05] Then God confirmed his faith by giving
[7:09] him a sign
[7:12] and that sign was circumcision.
[7:16] and circumcision is a type of the Holy
[7:19] Spirit.
[7:20] &gt;&gt; Just the very next uh verses of this
[7:24] chapter that we have just read, if you
[7:26] want to take it down and the um
[7:31] uh Stephen said in the 51st verse, "Ye
[7:36] stiff necks, uncircumcised
[7:39] in the heart and ears, you do always
[7:42] resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers
[7:44] did." So do you.
[7:48] The circumcision is a type of the Holy
[7:53] Ghost. And God gave Abraham the the
[7:58] circumcision sign after he had accepted
[8:02] God on his promise and walked out into a
[8:06] strange country.
[8:08] &gt;&gt; It was a sign.
[8:11] and all his children and his seed after
[8:16] him should have this sign in their flesh
[8:19] because it was a distinction.
[8:23] It was to separate them
[8:27] from all other peoples.
[8:30] This sign of circumcision
[8:34] and that's what God uses today.
[8:38] It's the sign of circumcision of the
[8:41] heart.
[8:43] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit that makes God's church
[8:47] a separated church from all other
[8:51] creeds, faiths, and denominations.
[8:56] &gt;&gt; They're in all kinds of denominations,
[8:59] but yet they are a separated people.
[9:03] You let me talk to a man two minutes, I
[9:06] can tell you whether he's received the
[9:07] Holy Ghost or not.
[9:09] &gt;&gt; So can you
[9:13] separates them? It's a mark. It's a
[9:15] sign.
[9:18] And the Holy Spirit is a sign.
[9:22] And it's any child that refused
[9:27] circumcision
[9:29] in the Old Testament, which was a
[9:32] foreshadow of the Holy Ghost, was cut
[9:36] off from amongst the people.
[9:40] He could not have fellowship
[9:43] with the rest of the congregation if he
[9:45] refused to be circumcised.
[9:49] Now, pattern that to today.
[9:52] A person that would refuse to receive
[9:55] the baptism of the Holy Ghost can have
[9:58] no fellowship among those that has the
[10:01] Holy Ghost.
[10:02] &gt;&gt; You just can't do it.
[10:05] You have to be a nature.
[10:08] Like it's my mother there used to say
[10:11] birds of a feather flock together.
[10:14] Well, it's an old proverb, but it's a
[10:16] true one. You don't see doves and crows
[10:19] fellowshipping.
[10:21] Their diets are different, their habits
[10:23] are different, their desires are
[10:25] different. That's the way it is with the
[10:28] world and with a Christian.
[10:31] When you have been circumcised by the
[10:34] Holy Spirit,
[10:36] which means to cut off a flesh.
[10:42] Circumcision could only be in the male.
[10:46] But if the woman was married to a man,
[10:49] she was part of him. She was circumcised
[10:52] with him.
[10:55] You remember in Timothy where it said,
[10:57] "Never notwithstanding, she shall be
[10:59] saved in childbearing if she continues
[11:01] in faith and holiness with all
[11:03] sobriety."
[11:04] Now,
[11:06] circumcision,
[11:08] you know, when the Sarah laughed in the
[11:11] tent behind her at the message of the
[11:14] angel,
[11:15] when he said, Abraham, not knowing who
[11:17] he was, a stranger,
[11:21] where is thy wife Sarah?
[11:25] How did he know that he had a wife?
[11:29] As Jesus said, as it was in the days of
[11:31] Lot, so will it be in the coming of the
[11:33] son of man. Remember those signs wasn't
[11:37] committed down to Sodom and Gomorrah in
[11:39] the world amongst the religionists,
[11:42] &gt;&gt; but it was to the elect, the called out
[11:46] &gt;&gt; and Abraham was called out. And the word
[11:50] church means called out
[11:53] &gt;&gt; the separated
[11:55] like Abraham
[11:57] separated himself and have been
[11:59] circumcised.
[12:02] And then when Sarah laughed at the very
[12:04] message of the angel, God would have
[12:07] killed her on the spot.
[12:10] But he could not bother Sarah without
[12:13] bothering Abraham because they were one.
[12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[12:20] She was part of him. You're no longer
[12:23] twain but one.
[12:26] So circumcision, the Holy Spirit today
[12:32] circumcises the heart and it's a sign,
[12:37] a given sign.
[12:40] Someone said the other day, I just
[12:42] repeat this not as a joke because it's a
[12:46] truth, but it sounds like a joke. As
[12:49] I've often said, this is no place for
[12:52] jokes.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; But there was a little German out on the
[12:57] West Coast where we were just at. He
[13:01] received the Holy Ghost
[13:04] and he went down the street and he would
[13:07] walk a little peace and he'd raise up
[13:09] his hands and speak in tongues and he
[13:11] would run and he would jump and he would
[13:14] shout and he was at work carrying all
[13:16] like that and his boss said to him,
[13:19] "Where have you been?"
[13:24] I like those places where you have been.
[13:30] He said, "You must have been down
[13:32] amongst that bunch of nuts."
[13:37] He said, "Then you think they are nuts?"
[13:41] He said, "Sure they are." He said,
[13:44] "Well, praise the Lord for the nuts."
[13:49] And he said, "You know what? The nuts
[13:54] play a big part."
[13:56] He said, "For instance, the automobile
[14:00] You take all the nuts out of it, you
[14:02] ain't got nothing but a bunch of yunk.
[14:04] So that's just about right.
[14:10] You are so different
[14:13] when the Holy Spirit comes on you
[14:17] until the mind of this world don't like
[14:21] you and they're against you and they
[14:23] don't want nothing to do with you at
[14:25] all.
[14:27] You're born of another world.
[14:30] &gt;&gt; You are just as much an alien, 10 times
[14:34] more alien you'd be if you'd go into
[14:36] forest plum regions of African jungles.
[14:40] &gt;&gt; You're different when the Holy Spirit
[14:43] comes. And it's a sign. It's a mark
[14:47] amongst the people. Now you say then,
[14:51] brother Brandham,
[14:53] that sign of circumcision was given to
[14:56] Abraham.
[14:57] That is true.
[14:59] Unto his seed. Yes.
[15:03] All right. Now we are going to turn to
[15:05] Galatians 3rd chapter 29th verse and see
[15:09] how that could apply to us. Galatians 3
[15:15] and 29. and just see how this
[15:19] circumcision could apply to a gentile
[15:24] if we are
[15:26] Gentiles
[15:28] which by natural birth we are.
[15:32] Now the first I want to read the 16th
[15:35] verse. Now to Abraham and his seed were
[15:40] the promise made. Abraham and his seed.
[15:44] He said not and to seeds just any kind
[15:49] of a seed. Oh, I'm Abraham's seeds, too.
[15:51] No, to a seed.
[15:54] Abraham's seed. Not the seeds as of
[15:57] many, but as of one and to to they
[16:02] and to thy seed, which is Christ.
[16:07] Christ was Abraham's seed. Do you
[16:09] believe that?
[16:12] All right. Now, let's get to 28th and
[16:15] 29th verse. There is neither Jew nor
[16:19] Greek, neither is there bond or free,
[16:23] neither is there male or female, for we
[16:26] are all one in Christ Jesus.
[16:32] And if ye be Christ, then ye are
[16:36] Abraham's seed and are hes according to
[16:39] the promise.
[16:43] &gt;&gt; How do we take on Abraham's seed? By
[16:48] being in Christ.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; Then we are Abraham's seed.
[16:55] And what was the seed of Abraham? As we
[16:57] might go on to Romans 4 in different
[16:59] places,
[17:02] Abraham never received the promise
[17:07] while he was circumcised
[17:09] to show that circumcision was just a
[17:12] type. He received the promise before he
[17:17] was circumcised.
[17:19] And it was a type of recognition of his
[17:23] faith that he had before he was
[17:26] circumcised.
[17:28] Now when we are in Christ, we become
[17:33] Abraham's seed and are hes with Christ.
[17:39] Therefore, no matter who we are, Jew or
[17:42] Gentile, and the seed of Abraham,
[17:47] the seed of Abraham has the faith of
[17:50] Abraham,
[17:52] who takes God at his word.
[17:56] Regardless of how ridiculous it seems,
[17:59] how unusual you act, how peculiar it
[18:03] makes you, you take God at his word
[18:07] regardless of anything.
[18:10] &gt;&gt; Abraham at 75 years old and Sarah at 65
[18:16] took God at his word and called anything
[18:19] contrary to it as though it wasn't.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; What do you think the doctors thought of
[18:24] that day? What do you think the people
[18:26] thought when they seen an old man 75
[18:29] years old going around praising God?
[18:31] He's going to have a baby by his wife
[18:33] and her 65 years old about 25 years past
[18:36] menopause.
[18:39] But you see, it makes you act funny.
[18:43] The faith of Abraham
[18:45] and when you're circumcised of the Holy
[18:48] Ghost, it does the same thing to you.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; It makes you do things that you didn't
[18:52] think you would do. It makes you take
[18:54] God's promise and believe God. Now, it's
[18:59] also besides
[19:02] a se a promise
[19:05] and a sign, it's also a seal.
[19:11] Now, if you will go with me unto Romans,
[19:16] first I want you to go with me to
[19:19] uh Ephesians 4:30.
[19:23] And let's read here just a minute.
[19:28] Ephesians 4:30 says this. Now you've
[19:31] heard so many people say that different
[19:34] things are seals. If you go into the
[19:38] church, you have the seal of the church.
[19:41] And some people says it's keeping a
[19:43] certain day, a Sabbath day. That's
[19:46] that's a seal of God. Some of them says
[19:49] if we put our membership into a certain
[19:52] denomination, we are sealed into the
[19:54] kingdom of God. Now, the Bible said,
[19:57] "Let every man's word be a lie, and
[20:00] God's be the truth."
[20:03] Now, Ephesians 4:30 reads like this,
[20:06] "And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God,
[20:10] whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
[20:15] redemption.
[20:19] I'm going to have to get a little bit
[20:20] hard on this. Now lay down. Are you
[20:23] legalist brethren? Just hold quite for a
[20:25] little bit. Did you notice how long that
[20:28] seal last?
[20:31] &gt;&gt; Not to the next revival.
[20:34] Until the next time something goes
[20:36] wrong.
[20:38] Until the day of your redemption.
[20:42] &gt;&gt; That's how long you're sealed.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; Praise God. until the day of your
[20:47] redemption.
[20:50] When you are redeemed up to be with God,
[20:53] that's how long the Holy Spirit seals
[20:55] you. Not from revival to revival, but
[20:58] from eternity to eternity. You are
[21:01] sealed by the Holy Spirit. That's what
[21:04] the Holy Spirit is. It's a seal of God.
[21:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; That he's found you found grace in his
[21:11] sight. Hallelujah. And he loves you and
[21:13] he believes you and he's putting a seal
[21:15] up on you.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; What is a seal? Anyone want a seal
[21:21] designates or means of finished work.
[21:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; God has saved you, sanctified you,
[21:31] cleaned you up, found favor with you,
[21:34] and sealed you. He's finished.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; You're his product until the day of your
[21:40] redemption.
[21:43] The sealed is a finished thing. What is
[21:45] the Holy Ghost? It's a sign.
[21:50] We're going to get on that a little
[21:51] later on in another message. The sign
[21:53] Paul spoke of tongues was a sign to
[21:56] believers or unbelievers. Now notice,
[22:00] but in this the Holy Ghost is a sign. I
[22:04] mean, and the Holy Ghost is a seal. It's
[22:08] a sign
[22:10] that God gave to his chosen children.
[22:15] To reject it is to be cut from the
[22:17] people.
[22:19] &gt;&gt; And to receive it is to be finished with
[22:23] the world and all the things of the
[22:25] world.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:27] &gt;&gt; And to be a product that God
[22:32] has put a seal of approval on.
[26:11] Hallelujah.
[26:54] Heat. Heat.
[27:43] Hallelujah.
[28:53] Heat. Heat.
[29:00] Hallelujah.
[29:24] Thank you.
[29:41] Away.
[30:12] Hallelujah.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; [music]
[31:48] &gt;&gt; So great.
[31:51] There is no one else like
[31:55] [music and singing] you.
[31:59] Yes, there [singing and music] is no one
[32:03] else like you.

[33:48] There's no one else [music and singing]

[34:11] Lord. There is [singing] no
[34:15] one
[34:16] else
[34:19] &gt;&gt; like you.
[34:22] Amen. Brother Chris Smith, would you
[34:24] open our service with a word of prayer
[34:25] this morning? [music] Why don't we just
[34:26] give our Lord and Savior a praise
[34:29] offering this morning? [applause]
[34:31] There's no one else like you, Lord.
[34:34] Hallelujah.
[34:37] Dear Lord,
[34:39] &gt;&gt; you do deserve all the glory we can give
[34:41] you. Lord,
[34:43] &gt;&gt; dear heavenly father, the promises,
[34:45] Lord, prayers, your answer, Lord,
[34:49] &gt;&gt; we appreciate it, Lord. You are such a
[34:52] great God, Glory Jesus.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; We trust in you for everything, Lord.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; And you always deliver for us, Lord. We
[35:00] appreciate you so much, Lord. We just
[35:03] want to worship you this morning, Lord.
[35:05] Just please Lord come down here with us
[35:08] today Lord just worship Lord so we can
[35:12] worship you Lord Jesus may your presence
[35:15] be here we love you so much Lord please
[35:19] be with us we ask this in Jesus Christ's
[35:22] [music] name amen
[35:29] you can be seated if [music] you'd like
[35:30] this morning
[35:33] Amen just I want to mention mention
[35:35] something before we start the uh the
[35:38] rest of the singing and before [music]
[35:40] they bring the prayer requests. But um
[35:42] most of you were here on Wednesday
[35:44] night. Brother Chuck gave a a praise
[35:47] report where they were traveling back
[35:49] from um from Minnesota
[35:52] and they had a flat tire on their car
[35:56] and it happened in one of the only two
[35:59] places in [music] maybe a thousand mile
[36:02] stretch where they had one of the tire
[36:06] places that uh was able to change his
[36:09] tire. [music]
[36:10] Um, and you know, we just believe that
[36:12] the Lord bad things are going to happen
[36:14] to us, but the timing of them couldn't
[36:17] be better than than what it was with
[36:19] with Chuck. And so, you know, the
[36:22] vehicle had a flat and it was just
[36:24] within miles of of one of the two places
[36:27] that they could have had the tire
[36:28] changed. So, um, just wanted [music] to
[36:31] thank the Lord for that and I want to
[36:32] thank him in advance. We have another
[36:33] timing thing. Saw the lights flickering
[36:35] this morning. And I'm thankful that
[36:36] that's happening this Sunday instead of
[36:38] next Sunday. But we need for we need we
[36:42] need for that to be [music] fixed before
[36:44] our special meetings. We have our
[36:45] dedication meetings. We don't want to
[36:46] have any distractions. And we just so
[36:49] just remember that in prayer that
[36:50] [music] whoever's working on that that
[36:53] give the electricians wisdom. They'll be
[36:56] able to find out what the problem is.
[36:58] And we are in store [music] for a
[36:59] wonderful week of worship and looking
[37:02] forward to what he has in store for us.
[37:04] Somebody can say, "Every day with Jesus
[37:06] is sweeter than the day before."
[37:08] Every day with Jesus, oh, it's sweeter
[37:12] [singing and music] than the day before.

[47:47] you. [music]
[47:48] Truly, you are our everything. Father,
[47:52] Lord Jesus, the fullness of the Godhead
[47:54] dwelt [music] in you bodily. There's no
[47:57] other name under heaven where that is
[47:59] given where we must be saved, Father.
[48:03] Lord, so we have confidence in that. We
[48:06] have confidence, [music] Lord, in the
[48:07] blood of Jesus that has been shed for
[48:09] every sickness. You're our savior.
[48:12] You're our healer.
[48:14] And we ask that, Lord, that you just
[48:17] just help those that are suffering,
[48:19] Lord. Those that are sick, those that
[48:21] may not be with us this morning. Father,
[48:24] let the blood of Jesus overpower every
[48:27] every work of the enemy. We come against
[48:30] it in our precious name. Lord, raise
[48:33] everyone up. Lord, make everyone strong.
[48:36] Father, we pray for that blessed Holy
[48:39] Spirit anointing and presence [music] on
[48:41] this meeting this morning, Lord, that
[48:43] we'd receive all that you have for us,
[48:46] [music]
[48:47] Lord. Let the ministers speak as the
[48:49] oracles of God. [snorts] And we'll be
[48:51] [music] thankful, Lord, and we'll praise
[48:54] you for everything. In my precious name,

[49:13] window on the east side. So, those that
[49:17] weren't here yesterday for the [music]
[49:18] workday may not have seen that yet. If

[49:40] hours of their time they spent working
[49:43] on that. So it may it may look like, oh,
[49:46] finally we got it back up, but that was
[49:48] a huge labor of love that went into
[49:49] that. And I don't want to take away
[49:51] their [music] reward, but I just want to
[49:53] thank them for their for that burden
[49:55] that they had and [music] just you see

[1:00:10] Oh,
[1:00:13] [singing and music]
[1:00:35] God bless you, [music] saints. So good
[1:00:36] to be in church with each one of you
[1:00:38] this morning. and you're away for a few
[1:00:39] days and you realize how much you miss
[1:00:41] one another and love you so [music] much
[1:00:43] and a lot of special people in the
[1:00:46] congregation this morning. Love you and
[1:00:48] appreciate you. We miss our pastor of
[1:00:50] course today. So be in prayer for him as
[1:00:52] he's returning for service [music]
[1:00:54] tonight.
[1:00:56] I know we'll be missing sister Rachel
[1:00:58] and sister Helen are Lord willing
[1:00:59] leaving us on Tuesday. [music] So
[1:01:01] remember them also as they're going home
[1:01:04] although this is home maybe number two.
[1:01:06] [music] So we love you. appreciate you.
[1:01:09] So, in the way of Sunday school, we had
[1:01:10] 10 children, eight Bibles, and $2 for
[1:01:13] the offering [music] this morning.
[1:01:17] There will not be service on Wednesday.
[1:01:19] So, I think there'll be a lot of
[1:01:20] activity this week and probably [music]
[1:01:22] some folks here Wednesday. Talk to the
[1:01:24] pastor, Sister Sharon, and those
[1:01:26] orchestrating maybe doing some final
[1:01:28] touches. We'll probably be missing these
[1:01:30] two windows. I think John um we'll
[1:01:32] probably have to use the overflow.
[1:01:35] So, get here early. your seat that you
[1:01:38] we normally tend to sit in may or may
[1:01:40] not be available. Just bear [music] with
[1:01:42] us. We'll change it up a little bit, try
[1:01:43] to squeeze a few more seats in. So, just
[1:01:45] be in prayer for all those things and
[1:01:48] the Lord will help us through
[1:01:49] everything. And he'll be ministering to
[1:01:51] us this morning. He'll be ministering
[1:01:53] through our [music] precious brother
[1:01:54] Luis Aguilar from South Phoenix Church.
[1:01:57] That's our pastor, Brother Octavio
[1:02:00] Ordonius. And [music] love them and
[1:02:02] appreciate them. We want our brother
[1:02:03] just to be right at home. His young
[1:02:06] family, brother Alex here, I think mom
[1:02:08] and a couple of other little ones are
[1:02:10] probably in the nursery. So, make sure
[1:02:12] you say hi to them and welcome them this
[1:02:15] morning. Amen. [music] God bless you.
[1:02:17] Anything I'm missing, Brother Chris,
[1:02:20] Brother Ben?
[1:02:22] Yes, sir.
[1:02:24] Great question. I didn't think to text
[1:02:27] brother Israel just a few minutes ago,
[1:02:29] and so I haven't heard back. If we hear
[1:02:30] back, we'll let brother John know as he
[1:02:32] sings for [music] us. Um, so we may or
[1:02:34] may not have communion tonight. I'm not
[1:02:37] sure. So, just be here and then we'll
[1:02:39] commune [music] one way or another. So,
[1:02:42] thank you for that, brother Chris.
[1:02:43] Anything else? Let us all stand and
[1:02:47] amazing grace, how [music] sweet the
[1:02:48] sound. It's really sweet when you just
[1:02:51] remember that he saved a wretch like me
[1:02:54] as our precious brother [music] comes
[1:02:55] this morning. Amazing
[1:03:00] [singing]
[1:03:00] grace,
[1:03:02] how sweet
[1:03:05] the Oh, think about it. He saved a
[1:03:08] wretch like [singing] me.
[1:03:11] A wretch. Oh, like me.
[1:03:18] Yes. Well, [singing]
[1:03:20] I once [music]
[1:03:23] Oh, think about it today. Yes. [singing]
[1:03:26] But now, right now, I'm
[1:03:31] [music and singing]
[1:03:33] Aren't you thankful you can see this?
[1:03:35] Now I can see
[1:03:40] [music]
[1:03:41] was his grace. It was his grace
[1:03:46] that taught [music and singing]
[1:03:49] my heart
[1:03:52] to
[1:03:54] [music]
[1:03:55] embrace
[1:03:57] my fear.
[1:04:00] [music]
[1:04:03] [singing] How precious,
[1:04:06] how [music]
[1:04:07] precious
[1:04:10] did
[1:04:12] that grace
[1:04:15] of
[1:04:18] the hour
[1:04:20] I
[1:04:23] [music] believe.
[1:04:29] And through many [music]
[1:04:33] angels
[1:04:38] [music]
[1:04:41] I have
[1:04:44] Glor. [music]
[1:05:04] [music]
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. and God bless you this
[1:05:14] morning. Would you be so [music] kind to
[1:05:16] just take your seats just for a few
[1:05:18] moments? I'd like to to greet you and
[1:05:20] introduce myself. Um, [music] for the
[1:05:23] ones who don't know me, I I'm Brother
[1:05:25] Luis Aguilad. I come from South South
[1:05:28] Phoenix, [music] a small little church
[1:05:30] there by South Mountain Church. Our
[1:05:32] pastor there is brother Octavio
[1:05:35] Ordonius. I have my uh our little cousin
[1:05:38] here with us and my wife and my two
[1:05:41] little boys. I think they're in the in
[1:05:42] the nursery and uh I really feel
[1:05:46] comfortable and I feel at home that uh
[1:05:48] the brothers that welcome us and we feel
[1:05:51] very very nice and that's our first time
[1:05:53] being here in in Shalom Tabernacle. I've
[1:05:56] been knowing brother Israel for for some
[1:05:58] time and I was telling I asked brother
[1:06:02] Israel back in New Mexico about a couple
[1:06:04] months ago. I I remember I was I come
[1:06:07] from a small town in East Texas. I was
[1:06:09] born and raised there and I've been
[1:06:11] living in Phoenix for about six years.
[1:06:13] And uh when I was a little boy around
[1:06:16] 12, 13 years old, I my uncle used to
[1:06:18] take me to these meetings in a small
[1:06:20] town called Jasper, Texas.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; And uh you know, so my mom would make
[1:06:26] sure, hey, you go with your uncle, he's
[1:06:27] going to take you to these camp
[1:06:28] meetings. And so I'll go and I remember
[1:06:30] seeing a colored brother there and I
[1:06:33] would see him real fire and he had a lot
[1:06:35] of energy and and I always had as years
[1:06:38] go on I had this doubt. I said, "Is that
[1:06:40] brother Paul? Is that not brother Paul?"
[1:06:41] And so when I finally got chance to sit
[1:06:44] down and talk with him, I don't got a
[1:06:45] lot of chance to sit down and talk with
[1:06:46] him, but that one time that I did, I
[1:06:48] said, "Brother, were you that brother
[1:06:50] back in Jasper, Texas many years ago?"
[1:06:52] He says, "Yep, that was that was me."
[1:06:54] So, so I I to me it's a really
[1:06:57] tremendous blessing for me as a as a
[1:06:59] 12year-old boy to see him and to now as
[1:07:02] years go on, we've gone in this journey
[1:07:05] and to have the privilege to stand
[1:07:07] behind this pulpit.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; So, I I don't take it lightly. I'm so
[1:07:11] glad to to be able to be here and to
[1:07:14] have fellowship with every single one of
[1:07:16] you. Amen. We we we worship the same God
[1:07:20] you worship. We believe the same message
[1:07:22] you believe and we're in the same
[1:07:24] journey in the same battle as all of
[1:07:26] you. Amen.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Would you please stand as we go
[1:07:29] into the word? Amen. Are you ready to go
[1:07:32] into the word this morning?
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to the book of Revelation
[1:07:38] uh chapter 3 verse 20.
[1:07:43] Amen. And what a what a beautiful church
[1:07:46] that the Lord has given you.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. We we plan on being here uh this
[1:07:50] coming weekend. Um we possibly won't be
[1:07:54] here for the whole services, but we'll
[1:07:56] try to be here Saturday and try to bring
[1:07:57] as many young people as we can and try
[1:08:00] to be the first ones here. Amen. I'm
[1:08:02] sure you're going to have a lot of
[1:08:03] people coming over. So, we're going to
[1:08:05] try to be the first ones here. Amen.
[1:08:07] [snorts] So, try to save us some seats
[1:08:09] for us, please. [laughter]
[1:08:12] Let's go. Revelations 3 20. And it it
[1:08:15] says, "Behold, I I stand at the door and
[1:08:18] knock. If any man hear my voice and open
[1:08:21] the door, I will come into him and and
[1:08:24] will s with him and he with me." Amen.
[1:08:27] Let's bow our heads. We go to a word of
[1:08:29] prayer. [snorts]
[1:08:30] Dear Lord, heavenly father, Lord, we
[1:08:32] give you thanks, Lord, in this beautiful
[1:08:34] morning, Father, as we gather here as a
[1:08:37] as a group of believers, Lord. Father,
[1:08:40] and a beautiful church, Lord, a
[1:08:42] beautiful atmosphere, Lord, and
[1:08:44] tremendous worship, Father, that's
[1:08:46] that's in this place, Lord. Father, as
[1:08:48] we going to enter in your word, Father,
[1:08:50] help us to help me to speak it right,
[1:08:53] Father, for your people. Lord, help your
[1:08:55] people. They're going to hear your word,
[1:08:57] Father, may go into fertile ground,
[1:08:59] Lord. May you close my mouth if I say
[1:09:01] anything wrong, Lord. Father, may you
[1:09:04] bless this beautiful congregation and
[1:09:06] brother Paul, wherever he's at. Father,
[1:09:08] may you be with him, Father. But we ask
[1:09:10] this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:09:13] And amen. Amen. Before you take your
[1:09:15] seats, won't you greet your brother,
[1:09:17] tell them good morning? Tell him to give
[1:09:19] him a nice smile.
[1:09:21] Amen.
[1:09:24] Amen. You may then you may take your
[1:09:25] seats.
[1:09:28] Amen. Amen. So once again, God bless
[1:09:31] you. Okay. Amen. you may take your
[1:09:33] seats. And this this morning I I hope
[1:09:36] not to take too much time, but this is
[1:09:38] something that we spoke to the to our
[1:09:41] church last week. And um but I want to
[1:09:45] go a little bit on in a different
[1:09:47] direction.
[1:09:49] And if [clears throat] I can place a
[1:09:50] little bit of a a title so we can
[1:09:52] understand in the direction that we're
[1:09:54] going, I like to entitle it a spiritual
[1:09:58] eclipse.
[1:10:00] Now here in the scripture that we find
[1:10:03] here as we all know it's we find it we
[1:10:06] find that it's a church of Laaya.
[1:10:09] Now as we know there's seven church ages
[1:10:14] and here in this last church age we find
[1:10:17] Jesus outside of his church knocking
[1:10:21] trying to get back into his church.
[1:10:25] Uh and he says, "Behold, I stand at the
[1:10:28] door and knock." And brother Brandham
[1:10:31] says as as he read the as he read the
[1:10:33] scripture, Brother Brandham says it, "I
[1:10:35] don't find it in the scripture that the
[1:10:38] church led him back in."
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brham says in the message,
[1:10:43] the Messiah 1961, he says, he says he's
[1:10:46] trying to get back in his own church
[1:10:49] where they pressed him out. And he says,
[1:10:51] "Isn't that pitiful that the most
[1:10:54] pathetic thing I can think of of him in
[1:10:59] his own church, giving his life for that
[1:11:01] church and being being doing the way he
[1:11:04] did and sent the light to the church and
[1:11:07] he and he said he did and they rejected
[1:11:09] it and they pushed him on the outside,
[1:11:12] accepted some kind of creed or something
[1:11:14] the church had made up. And there he is
[1:11:17] standing at the outside trying to get
[1:11:19] in.
[1:11:21] Now, as we see the the seven church
[1:11:23] ages, how the beginning of the word was
[1:11:25] Ephesians, where Ephesians came out,
[1:11:28] they had the original word. And as time
[1:11:31] begin to go, they got a little bit more
[1:11:33] colder. They got more formal. They
[1:11:35] started accepting other things besides
[1:11:38] the word. And if you notice that in in
[1:11:41] in the Ephesian church age that he says,
[1:11:44] you have tried them which say that
[1:11:45] they're apostles and you're not, and you
[1:11:47] found them liars. Because the people
[1:11:51] they receive the word from the apostle
[1:11:53] Paul. They knew the scriptures. So when
[1:11:57] somebody will come and preach something
[1:11:59] that was anti-word
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; or to add something or take away, they
[1:12:03] would quickly say that's not the word.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; That's not what the apostle said.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; So you notice and as the next church age
[1:12:10] went on, they they let something slide
[1:12:12] in. Then the next church age, well, we
[1:12:14] can start doing this. It doesn't matter.
[1:12:17] It's fine. and then the next church age,
[1:12:19] the next church age, and the next church
[1:12:21] age until finally we find him in the
[1:12:24] seventh church age kicked out of his own
[1:12:27] church
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; and he's trying to get back in.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham says we could take
[1:12:33] this to a church. We can we can talk it
[1:12:35] about it as an individual, as a
[1:12:38] marriage, as a family. Jesus trying to
[1:12:41] get back in.
[1:12:44] But whenever he arrives, we don't like
[1:12:46] what it does to us because he applies
[1:12:49] the word and and he he he acts us
[1:12:52] sometimes make us act a little funny.
[1:12:54] Brother Ram says it makes you say amen.
[1:12:56] It makes you raise your hand. It
[1:12:58] sometimes, brother Bram says the
[1:12:59] sisters, they don't want to get in the
[1:13:01] spirit because it makes the makes their
[1:13:02] makeup run off their their faces. You
[1:13:05] see? And so they're now they're cold and
[1:13:08] they're formal. Brother Ram says he sent
[1:13:10] the light to the church
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; and they rejected it. Amen. Now, Brother
[1:13:17] Brandham says in the message, the
[1:13:19] invisible union of the of the bride of
[1:13:21] Christ, he says the seven seals which
[1:13:24] all the mysteries of the seven church
[1:13:26] ages was sealed in the seven seals.
[1:13:30] The reformers didn't have time to do it
[1:13:33] in their days. They didn't live long
[1:13:35] enough. But this blessed revelation of
[1:13:38] the seven seals is open to us in this
[1:13:42] last day from a prophecy that went forth
[1:13:45] to Arizona.
[1:13:47] Now, Brother Brandham just finished
[1:13:49] saying that the seven seals is a
[1:13:51] revelation of the seven church ages. So,
[1:13:54] when brother Brandham preached the seven
[1:13:55] church ages, believe it was 1960,
[1:13:59] he had a an understanding of the seven
[1:14:01] church ages. But when 1963 came, the
[1:14:05] revelation came of the seven seals. Now,
[1:14:08] Brother Brandham says, "NOW I understand
[1:14:11] it."
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Now, now I want to I really want to run,
[1:14:17] but I want to take time with this. So,
[1:14:19] let's go to Revelations chapter 6.
[1:14:23] Amen.
[1:14:25] So, Revelations chapter 6 verse 1. And
[1:14:28] it says like this, "And I saw when the
[1:14:31] lamb opened one of the seals." Now, who
[1:14:35] is that lamb? It's Jesus. Jesus is the
[1:14:39] lamb. He opened the seals and I heard as
[1:14:41] it was a noise of thunder. Brother Ram
[1:14:43] says, "What is the voice of thunder?"
[1:14:45] Brother said, "It is the voice of God."
[1:14:49] And one of the four beasts saying, "Come
[1:14:52] and see." Now John as John the he's a
[1:14:56] scribe and he's writing this in aisle of
[1:14:58] Patmas and he's writing this. He only
[1:15:00] sees a symbol. He doesn't see the
[1:15:03] revelation of this. He just sees a
[1:15:04] symbol. He just sees a beast. He sees a
[1:15:07] horse. He sees a dragon. He doesn't know
[1:15:09] what it means. But it wasn't revealed.
[1:15:12] As years and hundreds of years ministers
[1:15:15] would read this scripture and not know
[1:15:18] what it really meant. Is that right?
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; So John, he's just writing it. He
[1:15:23] doesn't have the revelation of it. Now
[1:15:25] he says in second verse and and I saw
[1:15:28] and behold a white horse and he that sat
[1:15:31] on him had a bow and a crown was given
[1:15:35] unto him and he went forth conquering
[1:15:37] and to conquer. Now brother Bam says I
[1:15:39] said I thought that was the Holy Spirit
[1:15:42] was not once the seals were revealed to
[1:15:44] me that rider that white horse is the
[1:15:49] antichrist.
[1:15:52] coming out in the first church age,
[1:15:54] something innocent. Because the devil,
[1:15:57] he won't he won't approach you with a a
[1:16:00] skeleton skull and a skeleton horse and
[1:16:03] a fire. No, he's going to come up to you
[1:16:06] like I'm white. I'm innocent. I'm an
[1:16:08] innocent little horse. What can I
[1:16:10] possibly do to you? And that's what it
[1:16:13] little doctrine, little just a little
[1:16:14] teaching. It doesn't hurt. Real
[1:16:16] innocent. But he was a writer and he had
[1:16:20] a he had a bow but he had no no arrows.
[1:16:23] So brother R said he was a bluff and as
[1:16:25] time went on he received a crown that he
[1:16:29] was innocent.
[1:16:30] Sometimes we allow that in our our own
[1:16:33] lives. We allow something happen in our
[1:16:35] marriage, in our home, in our church. We
[1:16:38] there's something innocent. It doesn't
[1:16:39] hurt. It doesn't matter. But brother
[1:16:42] Brandham says that that white horse
[1:16:44] rider is the antichrist spirit because
[1:16:48] those spirits look so alike,
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; so similar,
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; but it would deceive the very elected if
[1:16:56] it was possible.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Ram says in the fourth seal
[1:17:00] says, "Have you noticed that the writer
[1:17:01] is a he and he had in his hand?" So,
[1:17:07] he's a man, false prophet. Now, here's
[1:17:10] here's where here's going to he's going
[1:17:12] to be a something heavy right here. I
[1:17:13] want you to really chew this. But his
[1:17:16] bride,
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; not not he's not talking about Jesus.
[1:17:20] He's talking about the rider that's
[1:17:22] riding that horse. Are you following me?
[1:17:25] The rider that's following that horse,
[1:17:27] he has a bride
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; and it's called the church.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; She [snorts]
[1:17:34] Jezebel. Ahab and Jezebel.
[1:17:38] So that rider was riding an innocent
[1:17:42] white horse, Antichrist spirit. And he
[1:17:45] has a bride. It's not the bride of Jesus
[1:17:47] Christ. It's that rebellious loudest
[1:17:49] saying church age that rejected the word
[1:17:53] that Jezebel.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says in the fifth seal, he
[1:17:58] says, excuse me, the first seal, this
[1:18:00] guy isn't called nothing. He doesn't
[1:18:03] have a name. He's just a rider on a
[1:18:04] white horse that has a has a bow and has
[1:18:07] a crown. That's all it is. But he's on a
[1:18:10] white horse. He doesn't have a name and
[1:18:12] he's sitting on a white horse.
[1:18:15] Now, Brother Ram says he was given a
[1:18:17] crown. He crowned a man a superman.
[1:18:20] Crowned him. The the Bible didn't call
[1:18:22] him a pope. The bi the Bible called him
[1:18:25] a false prophet. He says, "Of course, he
[1:18:28] must have been a must have been a false
[1:18:30] prophet by his antichrist spirit." Now
[1:18:33] this white horse had had an anointment
[1:18:37] and his anointment was false teaching.
[1:18:40] False teaching that was that's what he
[1:18:43] brought forth was false teaching.
[1:18:46] Brother Ram says by his antichrist
[1:18:48] spirit that taught antichrist against
[1:18:50] the original word because if he taught
[1:18:53] against the original word it was
[1:18:56] antichrist.
[1:18:57] It was and the word is God. See Christ.
[1:19:00] All right. Now after that we find him
[1:19:02] then crowned and when he got crowned now
[1:19:05] he sees very innocent and he's very
[1:19:07] helpless. Now brother Bham says the
[1:19:10] beast the living creature that said come
[1:19:13] and see that was sent to combat that
[1:19:18] white horse rider that white horse rider
[1:19:21] what was he doing? False teaching. It's
[1:19:24] going a little bit off the word here
[1:19:26] little bit off the word there. Something
[1:19:27] very innocent. It doesn't hurt to just
[1:19:29] do this. Take away that. So, but then
[1:19:32] God sends the anointment of the lion.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Is that right? The lion. God sent the
[1:19:39] lion which represents the word to combat
[1:19:44] that antichrist spirit.
[1:19:47] Now, let's go to verse three. It's
[1:19:50] chapter 6 verse three.
[1:19:52] And he says, "A second seal."
[1:19:55] And when he opened the second seal, I
[1:19:58] heard the second beast say, "Come and
[1:20:01] see." And there went out another horse
[1:20:04] that was red, and power was given to him
[1:20:07] that sat there on to take peace from the
[1:20:10] earth, and that they should kill one
[1:20:12] another, and there was given unto him a
[1:20:15] great sword. Brother Ram said, "It is
[1:20:18] the same rider, just a different horse,
[1:20:21] changing ministry.
[1:20:23] He was given a sword. He took away peace
[1:20:27] to kill one another. Now, Brother
[1:20:29] Brandham says what this was, it was a
[1:20:32] real dark tribulation period where now
[1:20:36] that white horse was very innocent.
[1:20:38] We're going to teach a little bit here.
[1:20:40] But now he changes his ministry. The
[1:20:42] same writer, just a different ministry.
[1:20:46] Now he has a sword and he says, "If you
[1:20:48] don't agree with me, I'm going to kill
[1:20:49] you if you don't agree with me." Amen.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; He was a bloody red horse and he took
[1:20:54] away peace to kill one another. Brother
[1:20:57] Ram says in the second seal says the
[1:20:59] Roman Catholic Church put 68 million
[1:21:03] Protestants to death
[1:21:06] for people not bowing down to that
[1:21:09] Catholic dogma dogma.
[1:21:11] You see he started very innocent, very
[1:21:13] subtle. says there were millions fed to
[1:21:16] lions and slaughtered in every way
[1:21:19] because they wouldn't bow down to that
[1:21:22] Catholic dogma.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; I really recommend you go to those seven
[1:21:26] church ages. Go to those seven seals.
[1:21:28] This is history.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham is taking out a history
[1:21:33] and putting it to the people's eyes.
[1:21:35] Look what happened there. And as we get
[1:21:38] in deeper into this, you're going to see
[1:21:40] how how the these denominations how they
[1:21:43] failed.
[1:21:46] Now, that's the red horse, same rider.
[1:21:50] And that he he he puts down his bow,
[1:21:52] picks up a sword, and kills anybody who
[1:21:54] disagree with him. Now, the living
[1:21:57] creature to combat this red horse
[1:22:00] anointment. Now, again, these are not
[1:22:03] literal horses. These are not little
[1:22:05] literal uh uh lion. It's spiritual.
[1:22:09] Amen. This is spiritual. John is just he
[1:22:12] sees this
[1:22:14] but he doesn't see the full
[1:22:16] understanding of it. Now to combat this
[1:22:19] red horse. Brother Ram says it was the
[1:22:22] ox that came to combat that red horse.
[1:22:27] Now an ox, he's not a a fighting animal.
[1:22:31] He's very very calm. He's a brother says
[1:22:34] we find he sent the ox during the time
[1:22:35] of the tribulation period he's a
[1:22:37] sacrificial animal and in this tribul
[1:22:41] tribulation tribulation period that's
[1:22:43] all the people could do
[1:22:46] was just work be slaves and offer
[1:22:50] themselves as sacrifice
[1:22:52] because if you spoke up at all they'll
[1:22:56] kill you right there. So that was the
[1:22:58] anointment of the ox. All you could do
[1:23:00] is just surrender yourself, work as a
[1:23:02] slave, and offer yourself as a sacrifice
[1:23:05] and to seal your testimony.
[1:23:08] As time goes on, the church ages go on.
[1:23:11] Now, we we see a third horse. Let's go
[1:23:14] to chap uh chapter 6 verse 5. And it
[1:23:17] says like this. And when it opened the
[1:23:20] third seal, I heard the third beast say,
[1:23:22] "Come and see. And I beheld, and lo, a
[1:23:25] black horse, and he that sat on him had
[1:23:28] a pair of balances in his hand. And I
[1:23:31] heard a voice in the midst of the four
[1:23:33] beasts say, "A measure of wheat for a
[1:23:35] penny, and three measures of barley for
[1:23:38] a penny, and see thou hurt not the oil
[1:23:41] and the wine." Now, same rider, just a
[1:23:46] different color horse. Now, this black
[1:23:49] horse, Brother Ram, said, represented
[1:23:50] the dark ages. Oh, dark. He had a pair
[1:23:54] of balances in his hand, saying, "A
[1:23:57] measure of wheat for a penny, three
[1:23:58] measure of barley for a penny, but see
[1:24:00] thee thou not hurt, the oil and the
[1:24:04] wine." Now this real innocent white
[1:24:07] horse giving a little teaching, trying
[1:24:10] to take a little bit one of the word.
[1:24:12] Now he changes. He says, "You don't
[1:24:14] agree with me? I'll kill you if you
[1:24:16] don't agree with me." Now he got more
[1:24:18] power. He turns into a black horse. And
[1:24:20] now he says, "You want prayer? Do you
[1:24:24] have $2? I give me $2 and I'll pray for
[1:24:28] you."
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; And now he started charging for stuff.
[1:24:33] That's tremendous.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; You see how this Antichrist spirit is?
[1:24:39] He was charging for prayer.
[1:24:42] You wanted prayer, you call the priest
[1:24:44] over, but you have to give them a couple
[1:24:46] coins.
[1:24:48] Brother Brandham says that's why Russia
[1:24:51] kicked out the Catholic Church and it
[1:24:53] turned into a communist country. And he
[1:24:56] said, Brother says, "Communism is a tool
[1:24:59] in the hand of God
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; because Russia, communism is going to
[1:25:04] avenge the blood of the saints." There's
[1:25:06] a quote that Brother Bram says that
[1:25:08] Russia has a bomb ready to throw it to
[1:25:10] the Catholic Church
[1:25:12] because the Catholic Church killed many
[1:25:15] Christian believers.
[1:25:18] Brother Ram says Mexico. Brother Ram
[1:25:19] says in the first seal he says Mexico
[1:25:21] where the poor Mexican people have a
[1:25:23] couple pesos and they don't make a lot
[1:25:25] of money but if they need something from
[1:25:28] the from the priest or whatever his name
[1:25:30] is need something you got to give them a
[1:25:33] couple dollars that you make which are
[1:25:36] hard money.
[1:25:38] You notice how far the church has gone
[1:25:41] from what the apostle Paul has brought
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; charging for prayer
[1:25:47] and then they come with this great idea.
[1:25:51] HOW CAN WE MAKE more money? So now the
[1:25:53] pope innocent white horse then he gets a
[1:25:57] crown. The Bible doesn't call him a
[1:26:00] pope. He calls him a false prophet.
[1:26:02] And he kills anybody who disagree with
[1:26:04] him. And then he says, you know what? I
[1:26:08] got power over heaven, over hell. I and
[1:26:13] I am the instead of the son of God.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; That's tremendous.
[1:26:18] And then he has a triple crown. And then
[1:26:22] he says, I got power over heaven and
[1:26:24] hell. And he says, guess what? I got so
[1:26:26] much power
[1:26:28] that I can take your loved one who did
[1:26:30] not live a Christian life. I can take
[1:26:33] him out of hell, put him in a place
[1:26:35] called purgatory,
[1:26:37] and then when he's cleansed in
[1:26:39] purgatory, he goes to heaven,
[1:26:42] but just give me some money or some
[1:26:45] charge. I'll give you a certificate
[1:26:49] declaring that your loved one that is in
[1:26:52] hell, he's in purgatory and he's going
[1:26:55] to go to heaven.
[1:26:56] Bro, this is history. You don't have to
[1:26:59] go to the message to look at this. This
[1:27:01] is history.
[1:27:02] Brother Brandham has taken out a history
[1:27:04] and applying it to the word
[1:27:07] charging for prayer. THERE'S NO SUCH
[1:27:09] thing as a purgatory. YOU GOT TO ACCEPT
[1:27:12] JESUS CHRIST RIGHT NOW.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says when you die, YOUR TIME
[1:27:17] IS UP THERE. YOU CAN'T GO BACK TO YOUR
[1:27:20] BODY. You got your opportunity is right
[1:27:24] now.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; There's many people in the grave. There
[1:27:28] are many bodies in THE GRAVE WHO LOST
[1:27:30] THEIR OPPORTUNITY, WHO HAD A LOT OF
[1:27:32] POTENTIAL, but they're sitting in a
[1:27:34] grave. Father Ram says that young rich
[1:27:37] ruler, he wanted him as an evangelist.
[1:27:42] But where is he at? He's found in hell
[1:27:45] tormented.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Brother says, "When you die," he says
[1:27:48] when you die, your body, your soul
[1:27:50] leaves your body. You can't go inside
[1:27:52] your body because your time is up. You
[1:27:54] can't go to heaven because you don't
[1:27:56] have the token which is the Holy Spirit.
[1:27:58] So there's only one place you can go and
[1:28:01] that's torment.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; There's no such thing as a purgatory.
[1:28:05] There's no such thing as certificates.
[1:28:07] There's no much thing give me money and
[1:28:09] you're saved. If you give that amount,
[1:28:11] you're saved. You give this amount
[1:28:12] you're not saved. That does not exist.
[1:28:16] You love the Lord.
[1:28:20] So then to combat that spirit,
[1:28:24] he sends the living creature of the man
[1:28:30] which was the reformer's age.
[1:28:32] Martin Luther, John Wesley, God said, he
[1:28:36] said he sent out the wisdom of a man, a
[1:28:38] man like a head on a beast, which was
[1:28:40] the power that went out for the
[1:28:42] reformers.
[1:28:44] It's tremendous that uh Friday was the
[1:28:47] 31st of October.
[1:28:50] That is the day that Martin Luther wrote
[1:28:54] 95 thesis and nailed it on the Catholic
[1:28:58] door of the church.
[1:29:01] The putting out everything that he
[1:29:03] disagreed with the pope and the Catholic
[1:29:06] church.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; That is what we need today. more men and
[1:29:10] women of God that stands for the word.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; They could have killed him.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; He But see, Martin Luther was
[1:29:20] intelligent. He was wise because the
[1:29:22] pope the the the Bible was written in
[1:29:25] Latin. The people were humble. They
[1:29:27] didn't know how to read. So the pope
[1:29:28] would go up there and the priest would
[1:29:29] go up there and he says, "You got to do
[1:29:31] this and this cuz the Bible says it."
[1:29:33] The people were humble. They were
[1:29:34] farmers. They didn't understand. They
[1:29:36] didn't know how to read. So they just
[1:29:38] agreed with it.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; But Martin Luther was a wise man. He he
[1:29:43] he began to read this. He says, "Wait a
[1:29:45] minute. It doesn't say that here.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; He didn't say there's a purgatory. It
[1:29:50] doesn't say if you're saved because of
[1:29:51] the pope or because the word of the
[1:29:52] church." HE SAYS YOU'RE SAVED BY GRACE.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; He begin to make these notes. He says,
[1:29:59] "That doesn't make sense." He says, "The
[1:30:02] just shall live by faith."
[1:30:06] that you're justified, you're forgiven.
[1:30:10] And he says, these are two quotes that
[1:30:13] that I like from Martin Luther. There's
[1:30:14] many quotes.
[1:30:16] He says, "A simple layman," which means
[1:30:19] a simple member of the church, a simple
[1:30:22] layman armed with the scripture is
[1:30:26] greater than the mightiest pope without
[1:30:29] it.
[1:30:31] [laughter]
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; This is tremendous, brothers. I I
[1:30:34] recommend you go look what Martin Luther
[1:30:36] said.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Look what Martin Luther He what Martin
[1:30:40] Luther did. He stood up. He says, "Wait
[1:30:42] a minute. The Bible does not SAY THAT.
[1:30:46] TOOK PEOPLE OUT. THEN WHAT HAPPENED? He
[1:30:50] died. The church grew and they became a
[1:30:54] denomination and they went right back to
[1:30:56] the Catholic Church."
[1:30:59] Here's another quote from Martin Luther.
[1:31:02] The law says do this and it's never
[1:31:05] done. Grace says believe this and
[1:31:10] everything's already done.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; So some of the points that he had Martin
[1:31:17] Luther had was saved by grace alone
[1:31:20] through faith alone according to the
[1:31:24] scripture alone to the glory of God
[1:31:27] alone alone. So Martin Luther, he went
[1:31:31] in combat that that black horse rider
[1:31:34] spirit that was charging for money. He
[1:31:36] says, "There's no such a thing. You're
[1:31:39] saved through through grace. You're
[1:31:41] saved by grace through faith.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; We're all saved. You just got to believe
[1:31:45] it."
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; You can't see it. You can't touch it,
[1:31:47] but you got to believe it. I'm not going
[1:31:48] to give you a certificate that your sins
[1:31:51] have been washed away. You got to
[1:31:53] believe that, brother and sister.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; It's through faith. Amen. Do you love
[1:31:56] the Lord?
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, as time went on, the last we
[1:32:01] get here to the last church age, you can
[1:32:04] see how how of a mess and chaos the
[1:32:08] church is going into. Now, let's go to
[1:32:11] the fourth seal. Chapter 6, verse 7. And
[1:32:15] it says, "And when he had opened the
[1:32:16] fourth seal, I heard the voice of the
[1:32:19] fourth beast say, come and see. And I
[1:32:23] looked, and behold, a pale horse, and
[1:32:26] his name that sat on him was death, and
[1:32:30] hell followed with him, and the power
[1:32:32] was given unto them over the fourth part
[1:32:35] of the earth to kill with the sword, and
[1:32:37] with hunger, and with the death, and
[1:32:38] with the beasts of the earth.
[1:32:41] Now, we see now that these three colors,
[1:32:46] white, then we have red, and we have
[1:32:50] black. But they're all mixed.
[1:32:52] They're all mixed together to turn into
[1:32:54] one horse. A pale yellow sickly horse.
[1:33:01] But now he has a name. He didn't start
[1:33:05] off with a name. He was innocent.
[1:33:08] But now in this last fourth seal, now he
[1:33:13] tells us his name.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; And his name is death.
[1:33:18] You notice if you lay off the word just
[1:33:21] a little bit and you follow something
[1:33:23] very innocent eventually it will take
[1:33:26] you away from the word completely
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; because leaving the word of God leaving
[1:33:33] the presence of God is death.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:40] And he says he sent the fourth beast to
[1:33:43] combat this last horse rider. He was
[1:33:48] death and hell followed him. He had a
[1:33:51] sword to kill and he killed with hunger.
[1:33:55] The red horse he killed and he took away
[1:33:57] peace.
[1:33:59] This one he's he's not killing also with
[1:34:01] the sword but he's killing people with
[1:34:03] hunger.
[1:34:05] today. There's so much food today,
[1:34:07] brothers. There's so plenty of food,
[1:34:09] mass producing food everywhere. There's
[1:34:12] plants and there's there's these
[1:34:13] warehouses. There's so many food, but
[1:34:15] we're not talking about literal food.
[1:34:18] We're talking about spiritual food. The
[1:34:21] people are hungry for the REAL WORD OF
[1:34:24] GOD. That's why the scripture says,
[1:34:26] "Blessed are they who hunger and thirst
[1:34:29] for righteousness, for they shall be
[1:34:31] filled.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Just like in the time of Elijah, there
[1:34:35] was a famine in the land. It was dry.
[1:34:38] There was there was no food."
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; He commanded the heavens to shut, not to
[1:34:44] open, not to have any rain.
[1:34:47] But finally, when Elijah, he took those
[1:34:49] false prophets to Mount Carmel and he
[1:34:52] challenged them. And this is the God who
[1:34:55] answers by fire. There it was all those
[1:34:58] prophets. And he says, "You get GET THE
[1:35:01] CALF. I'LL GRAB THE CALF and you chop it
[1:35:03] up. Do what you want to do. Just hurry
[1:35:06] up."
[1:35:08] And you notice that Elijah, he had a
[1:35:11] sense of humor
[1:35:13] because it started from the morning
[1:35:15] until 12:00.
[1:35:17] He was sitting down and he said, "Are
[1:35:21] you done yet or do you if you read the
[1:35:23] scripture? Go to the scripture."
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; He makes fun of them.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Elijah had a sense of humor. So, he
[1:35:31] wasn't always just, "Brothers, God
[1:35:32] bless." He had a sense of humor.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; He says, "Is he in vacation? If he is,
[1:35:37] we got some business to do. You better
[1:35:38] go call him.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; If he's sleeping, we better go wake HIM
[1:35:41] UP BECAUSE WE GOT A SHOWDOWN."
[1:35:44] YOU NOTICE BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD ALWAYS
[1:35:45] SAY, he says, "Oh, those cemeteries."
[1:35:48] Oh, I'm sorry. Those seminaries. Brother
[1:35:51] Brandham had a sense of humor.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET OF GOD had a sense of humor.
[1:35:58] Now, that pale horse, those three horses
[1:36:01] mix into one. Anything that's anti that
[1:36:05] goes against the real has to be death.
[1:36:10] But again, the devil's never going to
[1:36:11] approach you with a skeleton face and a
[1:36:14] skeleton horse and, "Oh, I'm the devil."
[1:36:16] No, it's innocent.
[1:36:19] Innocent. It doesn't hurt to do this.
[1:36:21] Doesn't hurt to do that.
[1:36:25] Brother Ram says, "Naturally, they
[1:36:27] killed 68 million Protestants and put
[1:36:29] them to death in the Roman church."
[1:36:33] Brother Ram says in the fourth seal, he
[1:36:34] says, "Now God only knows how many he
[1:36:38] caused to spiritually die
[1:36:42] by this by his anti-Bible word
[1:36:45] teaching." This is the one he put 68
[1:36:49] billion to the sword and killed them.
[1:36:51] And probably literally
[1:36:54] billions not millions billions died
[1:36:58] spiritually
[1:37:00] on his false teaching. No wonder he took
[1:37:04] that name of death. So this brothers in
[1:37:07] this last day people are not dying
[1:37:10] literally. People are dying spiritually.
[1:37:13] This is a spiritual death by anti-word
[1:37:17] teaching by letting the bar down just a
[1:37:20] little bit. Just one thing I was telling
[1:37:24] the church last Sunday, brothers,
[1:37:27] by hearing this from brother Brandham,
[1:37:29] brothers, we should be praying all
[1:37:31] night.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; What are we doing with our young people,
[1:37:35] with our children, with the church?
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. People are spiritually dying and
[1:37:41] we're going to give accounts for that.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; We're going to give accounts as me as a
[1:37:46] husband. I'm going to GIVE ACCOUNTS FOR
[1:37:47] MY WIFE AND CHILDREN.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; People spiritually dying
[1:37:54] now. His name is called death
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; and he's writing and the people who are
[1:37:59] following him are heading that way.
[1:38:03] But
[1:38:04] that living creature to combat that pale
[1:38:08] sickly horse by the name of death is an
[1:38:11] eagle.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT THE LION. It's not the ox. It's
[1:38:15] not the man. It's an eagle.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; And the eagle IS A PROPHET.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; TO BRING FORTH the revelation
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; of the word.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; He's revealed now. He wasn't revealed in
[1:38:29] Luther's time or in Wesley's time. It
[1:38:31] wasn't re revealed then, but he's
[1:38:33] revealed now.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY IT WAS brother Brian in 1963
[1:38:38] when those seals were open, he says that
[1:38:40] white horse is not the Holy Spirit. It's
[1:38:44] the antichrist.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; It couldn't be revealed then, but it's
[1:38:48] revealed now.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Now, it wasn't revealed in the lion or
[1:38:53] the ox of the man, but it's revealed
[1:38:54] under the eagle age of the prophet.
[1:38:59] Now, brother Ram says,
[1:39:02] "Was there mis excuse me, why did there
[1:39:05] excuse me, in the message, the feast of
[1:39:06] the trumpets, 1964, was there mysteries
[1:39:08] that was still hid?" Revelation 10, we
[1:39:11] find at the end of the seventh angel's
[1:39:13] message that these mysteries that had
[1:39:16] been hid would be revealed.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Notice the reason is because there had
[1:39:22] been no prophets during this age.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; There had been no prophets.
[1:39:28] only Apostle Paul was a prophet but
[1:39:31] everybody else they weren't.
[1:39:35] The last one brother says the last one
[1:39:37] is to be to be uh prophesied in the
[1:39:39] scriptures that the last seventh angel
[1:39:41] messenger would be a prophet to reveal
[1:39:43] these things. The Bible said that God
[1:39:46] does nothing until he reveals his
[1:39:49] secrets to his servant the prophets.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; That's why it's revealed in our day.
[1:39:57] We have the revelation of the word.
[1:40:00] That's right.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; It was great what Martin Luther said. It
[1:40:03] was great what John what John Wesley
[1:40:05] SAID. LIVE A SANCTIFIED LIFE. BUT NOW WE
[1:40:08] GOT SOMETHING GREATER.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; WE GOT THE HOLY Spirit
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; and access for you.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; All you have to DO IS ACCEPT THE HOLY
[1:40:16] SPIRIT.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Back then you just believe. You're
[1:40:19] justified
[1:40:21] now. Then John Wesley came. But now you
[1:40:23] have to live a clean life.
[1:40:26] You got to put some 30 things away. You
[1:40:28] have without holiness, no one will see
[1:40:32] God.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; And then here came the seventh angel
[1:40:35] messenger.
[1:40:36] And he says, he says, "Come up higher.
[1:40:40] Now it's time for you to receive the
[1:40:42] word to be filled with the word and
[1:40:44] filled with the Holy Spirit because
[1:40:45] that's the only way you can overcome
[1:40:48] this spiritual death that's in the
[1:40:50] world."
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes sir.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Now this this this one quote here is
[1:40:54] really impacted me. So I want you to
[1:40:56] really chew on this quote on the message
[1:40:58] of the fifth seal line 195.
[1:41:02] And uh [clears throat]
[1:41:04] I want you to notice this. I want you to
[1:41:05] notice the numbers. Brother Ram says and
[1:41:07] I'm going to see if the brothers will be
[1:41:09] so kind in the back kind of put that
[1:41:11] that number there once we're done here
[1:41:13] because I I kind of learn more by
[1:41:14] looking than I am by hearing. So it
[1:41:18] says, "Brethren, in the in the days of
[1:41:20] the lion that came, the original word,
[1:41:23] because a white horse had a false
[1:41:25] teaching, the lion brought the word."
[1:41:27] Notice when the in the days that the
[1:41:29] lion came, the original word, about
[1:41:32] 100th
[1:41:34] of them listened to the lion.
[1:41:38] In the days of the ox came just a tiny
[1:41:41] little group that listened to the ox
[1:41:44] message. And the day the days of the man
[1:41:47] came, he worked among men. You see, he
[1:41:49] was shrewd. He got a little group out.
[1:41:52] And then what did he do? Satan seen
[1:41:55] that. So he just sends them right back
[1:41:58] and marries them into it.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; What that means is that came Martin
[1:42:02] Luther took the take the church out.
[1:42:05] Then Martin Luther dies, the church
[1:42:06] denominates and marries right back to
[1:42:09] the Catholic Church. Here comes John
[1:42:11] Wesley leaves the Catholic Church. John
[1:42:13] Wesley dies. They denominate and marry
[1:42:16] back into the Catholic Church. But
[1:42:18] brother Ram says, "Not this message.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Not the message. This message would not
[1:42:23] be denominated."
[1:42:26] Now 199. And remember, when the eagle
[1:42:31] finally comes, it will be 100th of 1%
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; that'll listen. It's an eagle age.
[1:42:42] Now, I'm not sure if it's possible,
[1:42:43] sisters or brothers. Okay, look, 100th
[1:42:47] is 1%.
[1:42:49] Now, for you young people, when you What
[1:42:50] does 1% mean? You have your phone,
[1:42:52] right? Your phone, you that's about the
[1:42:54] way we understand it, right? You're
[1:42:55] charging your phone. When it's fully
[1:42:57] charged, what is it?
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; 100%. Is that right?
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; And when it loses charge, it goes to 1%.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; So, it's not 100, it's only 1%.
[1:43:10] Now, brother Ram says in the days of the
[1:43:12] lion, he didn't say it was 100%. He said
[1:43:14] it was 1%.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Only 1%.
[1:43:20] When the lion came. When the OX CAME, A
[1:43:23] SMALLER group than 1% came out.
[1:43:28] Now, when the man came, it was a smaller
[1:43:30] percent than 1%.
[1:43:32] But when it finally got to the eagle
[1:43:34] age, it's not 1%. It's 0.01%
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; that will listen to the prophet William
[1:43:46] Mary and Brandham
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; only 0.01%
[1:43:52] brothers this is 1963 he's talking here
[1:43:56] he says listen that will listen to the
[1:43:59] message
[1:44:01] I wonder how many people are actually
[1:44:02] living that message and that 0.01% 01%.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; That's what brother Ram says in the
[1:44:08] rapture. He says it won't be a lot of
[1:44:10] people. It'll be very few
[1:44:14] brothers. WE GOT TO FIGHT FOR THIS. WE
[1:44:16] GOT TO FIGHT FOR EVERY inch that we to
[1:44:20] get THIS GROUND.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; WE CAN'T be lazy around. We got TO PRAY.
[1:44:25] WE GOT TO RECEIVE THE HOLY Spirit
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; for it to be not to no reserves in us.
[1:44:30] But the day that we get there, WE CAN
[1:44:32] SAY, "LORD, I DONE EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY
[1:44:36] could to live this message." Say, "Lord,
[1:44:41] rebuke me. Chasten me. There's something
[1:44:43] you see that's wrong IN ME. SEARCH MY
[1:44:45] HEART, OH GOD. SEARCH ME [screaming]
[1:44:47] NOW.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO BE SEARCHED THEN. I WANT
[1:44:50] TO BE SEARCHED RIGHT NOW."
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY. BROTHER BRAM
[1:44:55] SAYS THE THE BRIDE THE BRIDE IS BEING
[1:44:59] formed right now.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; She's being rebuked right now.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Not over there.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; We're receiving it right now.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; We're being tested right now. There's
[1:45:11] people there people who are refusing the
[1:45:13] test. They're refusing it. They want to
[1:45:15] postpone the test.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; IF YOU POST POSTPONE THAT TEST, IT'LL BE
[1:45:20] in the tribulation period. Then you'll
[1:45:22] be tested. But right now, the bride,
[1:45:26] she's being tested. She's being tried.
[1:45:28] Right now,
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; 100th is 1%.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; The time of the eagle, it was 0.01%.
[1:45:41] That will listen to the message.
[1:45:45] I wonder how many people are actually
[1:45:47] living the message. You love the Lord.
[1:45:51] Now, in Matthew 24, we're not going to
[1:45:53] read the scripture. It mentions signs in
[1:45:55] heavens concerning the last days before
[1:45:58] Jesus comes. Here we have stars. We have
[1:46:02] the sun and the moon. And the sun
[1:46:05] represents the son of God, Jesus. Is
[1:46:08] that right?
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; The moon represents the bride. Amen.
[1:46:13] Now, the moon shines in the absence of
[1:46:17] the sun. Right now, there's daylight. We
[1:46:19] have the sun. There's not a moon out
[1:46:21] there. So, the sun is shining right now.
[1:46:25] But when the sun goes away or hides, now
[1:46:28] the moon comes. But the moon does not
[1:46:31] have a light of her own. She reflects
[1:46:34] the light of the sun.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; Now, brother says the sun is Jesus, the
[1:46:40] word, the light, and we reflect the
[1:46:44] light of the world in this dark age.
[1:46:48] Let's go real quickly to Isaiah chapter
[1:46:50] 60 verse1.
[1:46:53] Isaiah 60 verse1 verse2.
[1:46:56] Amen. Isaiah 61 verse two. And it says,
[1:47:01] "Arise, shine, for the light is come and
[1:47:04] the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[1:47:07] thee. For behold, the darkness shall
[1:47:10] cover the earth, and gross darkness the
[1:47:14] people, but the Lord shall rise upon
[1:47:17] thee, and his glory shall be seen upon
[1:47:21] thee. Brother Ram says, he says he it's
[1:47:24] a contrast of scriptures because the
[1:47:27] first one he says, "Arise and shine, for
[1:47:29] the light is come." And the second verse
[1:47:32] it says, "For behold, there should be
[1:47:34] darkness on the earth and gross darkness
[1:47:38] upon the people." One thing is darkness,
[1:47:41] the other thing is gross darkness on the
[1:47:43] people.
[1:47:44] And brother Ram says in the message
[1:47:46] shalom, it says darkness. This loudest
[1:47:49] say a church age. Now when Jesus which
[1:47:52] is the word in the loudest of church age
[1:47:55] was on the outside of the church
[1:47:57] knocking at the door trying to get in
[1:48:00] darkness gross darkness upon the people.
[1:48:04] If you go to the Philadelphia church age
[1:48:06] brother scripture says that there that
[1:48:08] Jesus says he placed an open door.
[1:48:12] He says that open door is not in the
[1:48:13] Philadelphia church age. It's not in the
[1:48:15] loud church age. It it's right in the
[1:48:18] middle. So as the church is is is
[1:48:21] journering on is traveling on from
[1:48:23] Ephesus Mir Titara Pergamus is going on
[1:48:26] and it gets to Philadelphia
[1:48:28] God places an open door before going
[1:48:31] into Laosa
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; because LAOSA GOES INTO CHAOS GOES INTO
[1:48:36] DARKNESS
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; but he places an open door. It's like
[1:48:40] going down the highway. You're going
[1:48:42] down uh what is this highway? I I 10.
[1:48:44] YOU'RE GOING TO I 10 and and uh you're
[1:48:46] going to to Phoenix.
[1:48:49] Now if you TAKE GOING TO PHOENIX that's
[1:48:52] an example LOUDA
[1:48:54] BUT GOD SAYS I PLACE AN EXIT
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; DON'T GO STRAIGHT
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; TAKE THE EXIT
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; DON'T GO STRAIGHT AND GO INTO CHAOS
[1:49:03] BROTHER ABRAHAM SAYS THAT OPEN DOOR IS
[1:49:06] THE HOLY GHOST IS JESUS CHRIST IS THE
[1:49:09] MESSAGE
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE MESSAGE of the hour
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; THAT YOU NOTICE WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:49:16] TOOK A PICTURE IN DALLAS TEXAS. There he
[1:49:19] is in Dallas, Texas, standing like this
[1:49:21] and there's a pillar of fire.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Where was he at? Standing before the
[1:49:25] door.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the GREAT SHEPHERD.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; STANDING IN THE THE DOOR OF THE
[1:49:32] SHEEPFOLD. No one can come in and NO ONE
[1:49:35] CAN COME OUT UNLESS THE PASTOR KNOWS WHO
[1:49:37] IT IS.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Jesus is our great shepherd. AMEN.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO COME IN THAT SHEEPFOLD
[1:49:45] JUSTIFIED, SANCTIFIED, and be baptized
[1:49:47] with the Holy Spirit.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; So, as you see that open door, HE SAYS,
[1:49:52] "DON'T GO CUZ IT'S CHAOS.
[1:49:55] NAKED, WRETCHED, MISERABLE, BLIND, AND
[1:49:58] DON'T EVEN KNOW IT. BUT I'LL place an
[1:50:00] open door. It's an exit. Take the exit."
[1:50:03] The open door.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; And we are in that open door. It's this
[1:50:08] message right here.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:13] Now the light is the the now the message
[1:50:16] shalom. He says now it's light time
[1:50:18] coming for the believers but it's gross
[1:50:21] darkness for the people.
[1:50:24] Light has come for the believers but
[1:50:26] gross darkness for the people. What is
[1:50:28] the light? The word.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; That's the light.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; The word. When you go into your house,
[1:50:34] you can't see it's dark. What do you do?
[1:50:36] YOU TURN ON THE LIGHT SO YOU CAN SEE
[1:50:38] WHERE YOU'RE GOING.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Is that right? you driving down the
[1:50:40] road. What do you do? It's dark aside,
[1:50:42] you turn on the light. So you can see
[1:50:45] John 3:16. I'm gonna read this scripture
[1:50:48] real quick. For God so loved the world
[1:50:52] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:50:55] whosoever believeth in him shall not
[1:50:57] perish but hath everlasting life. For
[1:51:00] God sent not his son into the world to
[1:51:02] condemn the world,
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; but that the world through him might be
[1:51:06] saved. Now is a time of grace and mercy.
[1:51:11] It's not time of judgment, brother and
[1:51:12] sister. It's time of grace.
[1:51:15] When that when that woman that was
[1:51:17] caught in the act of adultery,
[1:51:19] the Pharisees dragged her out and it got
[1:51:21] Jesus and trying to tempt him says the
[1:51:23] law says to stone her, that's what the
[1:51:26] law says that when Moses says, "But what
[1:51:28] do you say?" Amen.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram, scripture says that he
[1:51:33] looked at her.
[1:51:36] He looked at her but not with eyes of
[1:51:38] flame of fire. Because if you go to the
[1:51:41] book of Revelation in the sevenfold
[1:51:43] personage of the Lord, one of those
[1:51:47] items is a flames of fire, judgment.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; But when he was here on earth, it was
[1:51:54] grace.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; It was mercy.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; So whatever you do, brother and sister,
[1:52:00] God, Jesus, and the word is not here to
[1:52:02] condemn you. THE GOSPEL IS NOT to
[1:52:05] condemn you. The gospel not to put you
[1:52:08] IN PRISON BECAUSE YOU ALREADY ARE IN
[1:52:10] PRISON.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; BUT THE GOSPEL IS TO TAKE YOU OUT OF
[1:52:13] PRISON. TO TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE FREE,
[1:52:16] THAT YOU CAN FLY, THAT YOU'RE OKAY.
[1:52:18] THAT'S NOT THE GOSPEL TO TELL you're
[1:52:19] wrong. You're wrong. You're wrong. The
[1:52:22] gospel is to set you free.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; There he was. Jesus looked at her with
[1:52:29] the eyes of mercy, of grace, and forgave
[1:52:32] her. But there's going to come a time in
[1:52:34] the day of judgment where it won't be
[1:52:36] eyes of grace,
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; but it'll be eyes of flaming fire
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; of judgment.
[1:52:42] 18 He says, "He that believeth on him is
[1:52:45] not condemned, but he that believeth not
[1:52:48] is condemned already
[1:52:50] because he hath not believed in the name
[1:52:52] of the only begotten son of God." 19.
[1:52:56] And this is the condemnation. This is
[1:53:00] what happens when a person gets a gives
[1:53:02] into prison and they're about to give
[1:53:04] him his for someone who commits a crime.
[1:53:06] The judge comes and says, "This is what
[1:53:08] you're here for. This is the
[1:53:10] condemnation. The light has come into
[1:53:13] the world and men love darkness rather
[1:53:17] than light because their deeds were
[1:53:20] evil." What is the light? The word.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. When we receive the word,
[1:53:26] when Jesus is knocking on the outside,
[1:53:29] we don't want him to let him to come in
[1:53:31] because when he comes in, the light
[1:53:33] turns on
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; and then we're we he sees everything
[1:53:37] that we're hiding.
[1:53:40] The first thing he does, he goes into
[1:53:41] your living room
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; and he sees maybe things are out of
[1:53:45] order. You kind of get ashamed, but it's
[1:53:48] okay. It's a living room. He'll clean it
[1:53:51] up and he you can have fellowship.
[1:53:54] Then he comes into the to the kitchen
[1:53:55] and he sees everything nasty that we
[1:53:57] eat, everything that we see, all the
[1:54:01] perversions that we eat.
[1:54:03] We let him that far. But when it comes
[1:54:06] down to the bedroom,
[1:54:08] where there's intimacy, whether your
[1:54:11] deepest, darkest secrets are that your
[1:54:13] mom and dad doesn't know, that your wife
[1:54:15] doesn't know, that your husband doesn't
[1:54:16] know, that your pastor doesn't know. No,
[1:54:18] Jesus, you can't come in here.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; WE REJECT THE LIGHT.
[1:54:23] WE WE LOVE DARKNESS rather than light
[1:54:27] because our deeds are evil.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; We don't want Jesus to see them.
[1:54:32] Brother, I would rather have Jesus see
[1:54:33] it now than rather see it over there.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; That's why I repeatedly say, say,
[1:54:38] brother and sister, we should be praying
[1:54:40] and say, Lord, if you see anything wrong
[1:54:43] in me, DO PLEASE DO IT NOW.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO CONFESS MY SINS NOW. I WANT TO
[1:54:49] GET RIGHT WITH you right now. Amen.
[1:54:51] Amen.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; That is what the light does.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; It turns on the light,
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; but it's not to expose you to make you
[1:54:58] all that look to expose you as a sinner,
[1:55:00] as a as a hypocrite,
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S TO EXPOSE THAT YOU REALLY ARE A
[1:55:05] SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT IT'S REALLY EXPOSING.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE DEVIL IS TELLING YOU, DON'T
[1:55:11] LET HIM come in. Because if you let him
[1:55:13] in, he's going TO CONDEMN YOU. HE'S
[1:55:15] GOING TO EMBARRASS YOU. HE'S GOING TO
[1:55:17] EMBARRASS YOU. BUT THAT'S NOT IT. IS TO
[1:55:20] EXPOSE the devil that you really are a
[1:55:23] son and daughter of God.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; That's why we're fighting so MUCH TO LET
[1:55:27] JESUS in
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; because we think HE'S GOING TO EXPOSE US
[1:55:30] AS SINNERS, but he's not. HE'S GOING TO
[1:55:34] EXPOSE you that you really are a son and
[1:55:37] daughter of God.
[1:55:40] Just like in the beginning when there
[1:55:42] was gross darkness upon the earth and
[1:55:45] then God said, "Let there be light.
[1:55:49] And there was light. And when he turned
[1:55:52] the light on, he saw the earth was void
[1:55:54] and empty. [clears throat]
[1:55:56] And he began to form the earth. He began
[1:55:59] to separate the waters. He began to
[1:56:00] separate this. And that's what he does
[1:56:03] with our life.
[1:56:05] Let there be light. The word comes and
[1:56:09] places our life in order.
[1:56:14] Now, as I'm getting ready to close,
[1:56:18] when brother Brandham, he preached to
[1:56:19] seven church ages in 1960,
[1:56:22] he drew on a black board seven moons
[1:56:27] that he was revealed to him by the Lord.
[1:56:29] Remember the sun, son of God, the moon
[1:56:33] is the bride. Is that right? Seven
[1:56:35] moons, seven church ages. And I don't
[1:56:38] have an image here, but he says uh got
[1:56:41] the first moon that had more light and
[1:56:43] it got more darker and darker and darker
[1:56:46] until he got to Laosa.
[1:56:48] It was just a little bit of light left.
[1:56:53] now. And after he was done preaching
[1:56:56] that series, Brother Ram says in the
[1:56:59] message uh scriptural signs of the time
[1:57:02] of 1964,
[1:57:04] Brother Brandham says that in the back
[1:57:06] of the church of the tabernacle, the
[1:57:09] seven moons appeared that he drew in the
[1:57:12] blackboard that the angel Lord drew
[1:57:14] those same exact moons to vindicate what
[1:57:17] the prophet did. Amen.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; And he says in that same message,
[1:57:21] scriptural signs of the time, he says
[1:57:22] people were fainting when they saw the
[1:57:25] seven moons in the back.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; So one is the blackboard, two is the the
[1:57:30] the seven moons in the back, and the
[1:57:33] third
[1:57:35] before 1963 ended, December 30th, 1963,
[1:57:41] Jerusalem goes into an eclipse.
[1:57:46] Why? Because in January 4th of 1964, the
[1:57:50] Pope Paul V 6 goes to Jerusalem.
[1:57:56] You notice brother Ram says he took the
[1:57:58] name of Paul
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; like the first messenger but he takes
[1:58:02] the number of six the man
[1:58:05] and it to goes into total darkness
[1:58:09] before the pope goes into Jerusalem.
[1:58:13] Brothers, brothers, I wasn't even born
[1:58:16] yet. You imagine how much little time we
[1:58:19] have now.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; Brothers, we we have to get ready.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; Now, what did it mean for the pope to go
[1:58:30] to Jerusalem?
[1:58:32] The message shalom. He says, "It isn't
[1:58:33] Isn't it strange that just before the
[1:58:36] pope took his journey to Jerusalem that
[1:58:38] the moon and the heavens made a total
[1:58:40] blackout just a few days before he took
[1:58:43] his journey? He's coming here also." You
[1:58:45] know, now that he's that has never been
[1:58:48] known. See, but what does it show that
[1:58:51] this that he's doing this to win
[1:58:53] fellowship
[1:58:55] as he met on that day after he come into
[1:58:57] Jerusalem? He met with the Greek
[1:58:59] Orthodox Orthodox hierarchy. And what
[1:59:02] does that reflect? Fellowship is what
[1:59:05] they're wanting. Protestants and
[1:59:08] Catholicism
[1:59:09] joining together.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Which they are doing, which they are
[1:59:15] doing right now and will completely do
[1:59:18] it.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; And God reflected this to us in the
[1:59:21] moon. A total blackout. So that's three
[1:59:25] signs vindicated before 1963 ended. the
[1:59:28] blackboard that brother Brandham wrote
[1:59:30] the seven moons in the back and the
[1:59:32] total eclipse before the popes goes to
[1:59:34] Jerusalem and what was he doing the pope
[1:59:38] Catholicism joining with the Protestants
[1:59:41] having fellowship that's what the
[1:59:44] SCRIPTURE SAYS COME OUT OF HER DO NOT
[1:59:47] PARTICIPATE FROM OUR SINS GET AWAY FROM
[1:59:49] that
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; Martin LUTHER HE GAVE HIS LIFE TO LEAVE
[1:59:54] THAT THING AND THEY'RE GOING RIGHT BACK
[1:59:56] AT IT JOHN ASHLEY GAVE HIS LIFE TO GET
[1:59:59] THE PEOPLE out of THERE AND THEY GO
[2:00:01] RIGHT BACK TO IT.
[2:00:03] PROTESTANTISM, Catholicism joining
[2:00:06] together in fellowship. It's a spiritual
[2:00:09] eclipse,
[2:00:10] gross darkness upon the people.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you love the Lord?
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; People don't want to hear the word
[2:00:23] anymore. Probably people want to go to
[2:00:25] church anymore.
[2:00:27] We left we left the we left Phoenix
[2:00:29] early in the morning and and uh it might
[2:00:32] sound kind of funny but I'm not talking
[2:00:34] about a church you know you know even
[2:00:37] though I am right the Catholic church
[2:00:39] right but uh we left and 7 7 o'clock in
[2:00:42] the morning 7:15 in the morning and we
[2:00:44] drive by and the whole parking lot of
[2:00:46] the Catholic church is filled up. I told
[2:00:48] my wife, we have service at 9:30
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; in Phoenix. Doors open 9:30 and service
[2:00:54] begins at 10:00 and we got people coming
[2:00:56] in when the preaching starting.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; Oh boy, that's that's crazy that the
[2:01:01] Catholic Church is 7:30 in the morning
[2:01:04] and it's packed
[2:01:06] AND US TO HAVE THE MESSAGE OF the eagle.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; And brother BRAM SAYS YOU GOT TO AT
[2:01:12] LEAST COME 30 minutes before the service
[2:01:14] even starts. and the Catholic CHURCH HAS
[2:01:17] ALREADY FILLED UP THE PARKING LOT. I
[2:01:20] TOLD MY WIFE, "That's tremendous."
[2:01:23] I said, "The church, we got people
[2:01:24] coming out. I'm about to go up there and
[2:01:26] preach and there's people still coming
[2:01:27] in. I'm about to preach."
[2:01:30] Tell my wife that's why receive the
[2:01:33] message of the eagle. Gross darkness
[2:01:36] upon the people just like it was in the
[2:01:39] time of Egypt. All the people of Israel,
[2:01:42] they're in Egypt. But God sends a mighty
[2:01:45] prophet by the name of Moses, a
[2:01:48] stutterer WHO DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO TALK.
[2:01:51] BUT GOD SENT HIM. GOD VINDICATED HIM.
[2:01:53] God confirmed him. Sent him out there.
[2:01:55] And he gave he told the Pharaoh to let
[2:01:58] his people go.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; Pharaoh rejected. It's scriptural that
[2:02:02] God hardened his heart for a purpose. So
[2:02:04] the people CAN SEE THAT GOD WAS WITH
[2:02:07] MOSES.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; The same thing with the prophet.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, SO GOD CAN GOD CAN SHOW US
[2:02:13] THAT he has a prophet in our day.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; But he was there plagues and plagues,
[2:02:20] gross darkness hitting the people of
[2:02:23] Egypt, striking the land of Egypt until
[2:02:26] finally the last plague. What was that
[2:02:29] last plague? Death.
[2:02:32] Brother Ram said it was so dark. And the
[2:02:34] scripture said it was so dark you can
[2:02:36] feel it. The people of Egypt can feel
[2:02:39] the darkness that was in Egypt.
[2:02:43] But in Goan,
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; there was light in Goan.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; Not one single plague hit Goan.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the city. It wasn't because
[2:02:56] where they were located necessarily, BUT
[2:02:58] BECAUSE THEY OBEYED WHAT MOSES SAID.
[2:03:01] YEAH.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; MOSES SAYS, "TAKE [screaming] A LAMB,
[2:03:04] SLAUGHTER IT, cook it, and put the blood
[2:03:07] of the lamb on the doorpost
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; because in that night, the angel of
[2:03:12] death will pass by."
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; By obeying the word,
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; THAT'S ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS OBEY THE
[2:03:20] WORD THAT THE PROPHET SAID IN OUR LAST
[2:03:22] DAY.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; And plagues after plagues was hitting
[2:03:26] and striking Egypt. But in GAN THERE WAS
[2:03:29] LIGHT IN OCEAN.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON WAS STRUCKEN BY it
[2:03:35] because they OBEYED THE PROPHET OF GOD.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; And this last plague, it's not literal
[2:03:43] death, not natural death, it's spiritual
[2:03:45] death.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ram says in the message
[2:03:48] Christ those who got the blood on the
[2:03:51] doorpost out here the blood of the Lord
[2:03:53] Jesus Christ. Brother Ram says those who
[2:03:56] are born again
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; they know where they're standing
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; if they're really born again.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; You got to know where you're standing
[2:04:06] brother and sister on the word.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Not on the church, not in the doctrine.
[2:04:11] Not on anybody else. Not even on brother
[2:04:14] Brandham. Brother Brandham says in the
[2:04:16] message shalom, we said, "What are you
[2:04:18] going to turn to?" Turn to brother
[2:04:19] Brandham. Brother Brandham says, "You'll
[2:04:21] be foolish if you do that."
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; We ought to look to Jesus Christ.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; They'll, he says, they'll be in they'll
[2:04:31] not be entangled with every yoke and
[2:04:33] every doctrine and tossed here and there
[2:04:36] and every cult because they know where
[2:04:38] they're standing in Christ through the
[2:04:41] blood. Amen.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; There's spiritual darkness,
[2:04:45] but in this last day, that's why God or
[2:04:47] Moses said, "The Lord thy God will raise
[2:04:50] up a prophet out of the midst of thee of
[2:04:53] thy brethren."
[2:04:55] What's all of this with all this death
[2:04:57] and gross darkness?
[2:05:00] What can we do? What can we do? What can
[2:05:03] we possibly do? If there's gross
[2:05:06] darkness,
[2:05:07] where can we go?
[2:05:10] Brother Ram says in the message shalom,
[2:05:12] I'm I'm I'm finishing up now. The
[2:05:14] musicians can come forth.
[2:05:17] Brother Ram says in line 40,
[2:05:20] he says, "My new year's message is to
[2:05:22] the church elected in Jesus Christ for
[2:05:26] 1964."
[2:05:29] Not just not just to the church groups,
[2:05:35] but to the elect. I'm going to read that
[2:05:38] again. My new year's message is to the
[2:05:41] church elected
[2:05:43] in Jesus Christ.
[2:05:47] Remember that first horse, that rider,
[2:05:51] he had a bride, too. Who was the bride?
[2:05:55] The church. The Jezebel church. The
[2:05:57] loudest in church, the rebellious
[2:05:59] church.
[2:06:02] But brother says, "My message is not to
[2:06:05] that church." He says, "My new year's
[2:06:07] message is to the church elected
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ."
[2:06:15] Not just to the church groups, but the
[2:06:18] elect. The elect lady.
[2:06:21] You see this bride. She's a lady. She
[2:06:26] knows how to sit down.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; She knows how to stand up like a lady,
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; talk like a lady.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; Now, brother says, there's women that
[2:06:33] smoke and they spit tobacco and they
[2:06:35] drink. Sometimes they they they drink
[2:06:37] more than a man. They spit like a man.
[2:06:40] But this is a lady. She sits down like a
[2:06:43] lady, stands up like a lady.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; She doesn't let no man touch her.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; She's a lady.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; Just like Rebecca.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; As Abraham told Eleazar, I want you to
[2:06:59] go find a wife for my son Isaac. Go out
[2:07:03] there to my people. I want you to find
[2:07:05] her. Eleazar as a type of brother
[2:07:09] random. Eleazar goes, he prays and he
[2:07:13] says, "Lord, will you send her?" He had
[2:07:15] camels. Eleazar had big strong men with
[2:07:18] him. Eleazar was also a strong man, too.
[2:07:22] And in the evening time, there's the
[2:07:25] damsels came out to bring out water and
[2:07:28] he and the leazar goes up to her says,
[2:07:30] "Would you get fetch me water?" And he
[2:07:32] says, "I will and I'll give water for
[2:07:34] you and your camels."
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; And there she is. You imagine how much
[2:07:40] water that Eleazar drank and all of
[2:07:44] those camels. How much water those
[2:07:47] camels drink?
[2:07:49] She was just a a young lady. She didn't
[2:07:52] have two buckets. She probably just had
[2:07:54] a little Spanish. We had a little call
[2:07:58] like can we have a little bucket, you
[2:07:59] know, just that's that's all she had.
[2:08:02] Come back, fill it, go back over there,
[2:08:04] fill it there. By the time she went over
[2:08:06] there, they already already done
[2:08:06] drinking that one. Come back and do it
[2:08:08] again. But Rebecca
[2:08:11] Eleazar and his servant said, "No, don't
[2:08:14] help her. Don't help her. She has to do
[2:08:18] it by herself.
[2:08:22] She has to show that she has character.
[2:08:26] Don't help her. Eleazar
[2:08:29] strong man. He could have helped her.
[2:08:31] These other strong servants, they could
[2:08:32] have helped her. But the bride has to do
[2:08:36] it by herself.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; No one is going to help you.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; This is an individual affair.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; She had to SHOW THAT SHE HAD CHARACTER.
[2:08:48] SHE HAD TO SHOW THAT SHE WAS A LADY. SHE
[2:08:50] WASN'T COMPLAINING, GOING BACK AND GOING
[2:08:52] HERE, GOING BACK AND GOING HERE. OH,
[2:08:54] NOBODY HELPS me here. Nobody calls me
[2:08:56] there and nobody wants to uh motivate ME
[2:08:58] TO COME TO CHURCH. NO, SHE DID IT
[2:09:00] HERSELF.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; CUZ SHE HAD CHARACTER.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; SHE WAS AN ELECT LADY. SHE KEPT GOING
[2:09:07] BACK UNTIL THOSE CAMELS WERE SATISFIED.
[2:09:10] SHE HAD CHARACTER. YOU HAVE TO DO IT BY
[2:09:13] YOURSELF. [screaming] YOU HAVE NO ONE'S
[2:09:15] GOING TO TAKE YOU TO THE ALTAR AND SAY,
[2:09:17] "BROTHER, YOU GOT TO DIE. YOU GOT TO
[2:09:18] DIE." YOU YOURSELF HAVE TO DIE TO
[2:09:20] YOURSELF
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE BRIDE HAS CHARACTER. IT'S
[2:09:25] NOT TEMPER. It's not anger. A character
[2:09:28] is a Christlike character that follows
[2:09:30] the word. Blessed be the name of the
[2:09:34] Lord.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; Not just to the church groups, but the
[2:09:38] elect. The elect lady, the elect lady of
[2:09:40] the church, Christ's bride.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; That's who I'm addressing.
[2:09:47] Brother Ram says, "What I can say to
[2:09:49] this
[2:09:51] last church age and we're entering the
[2:09:53] gross darkness and chaos."
[2:09:57] My says, "My my New Year's message is
[2:10:00] shalom.
[2:10:03] Peace.
[2:10:05] Shalom."
[2:10:07] That's my New Year's message to the
[2:10:10] church. Shalom.
[2:10:13] peace.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; People look for peace,
[2:10:18] but the only peace you can ever find is
[2:10:21] with the Holy Spirit,
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; with the word.
[2:10:25] You're not going to find peace anywhere
[2:10:26] else, young person, brother, or sister.
[2:10:29] You're not going to find it anywhere
[2:10:30] else. You're not going to find it in the
[2:10:32] church. You're not going to find it
[2:10:33] decreed. You're not going to find it
[2:10:35] anywhere else. You're going to find
[2:10:38] peace the day you find God.
[2:10:42] But if you're looking for God, it's
[2:10:43] because God's been looking for you.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; Jesus always comes in the darkest hour.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; And the spiritual eclipse that we're
[2:10:51] living in, there shall be light in the
[2:10:54] evening time.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; There's light in Go.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Would you please stand? Let's bow
[2:10:58] our heads.
[2:11:01] Dear Lord, heavenly father.
[2:11:04] Lord, we give you thanks this beautiful
[2:11:06] morning, Lord.
[2:11:09] Lord, a morning of resurrection, Father.
[2:11:13] Lord, you know your people.
[2:11:15] I don't know your I don't know the
[2:11:16] people here, Father, but you do, Lord.
[2:11:19] You know their need. You know their
[2:11:20] desires, what they're going through,
[2:11:23] Lord.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; Father. But I pray, Lord, in this hour,
[2:11:27] Lord, that could say I said [music]
[2:11:28] something, Lord, that would motivate
[2:11:30] them to keep going forward.
[2:11:33] Now, oh Lord, if I said something
[2:11:34] [music] that was wrong, Lord, may they
[2:11:36] cast it out, Lord Jesus.
[2:11:39] But Father, may you be with these
[2:11:41] people,
[2:11:42] beautiful, [music] kind people, Lord,
[2:11:44] and may you give each and every single
[2:11:46] one of them, Lord, your Holy Ghost. May
[2:11:49] you seal them with your Holy Ghost,
[2:11:50] Lord, as we living in this dark hour,
[2:11:53] Lord.
[2:11:54] Lord, may you protect us, Lord. Help us
[2:11:57] [music] to obey your word
[2:12:00] as darkness is going by and the the
[2:12:02] angel of death is passing by. Lord of
[2:12:05] spiritual death.
[2:12:07] Lord, help us to apply the blood on our
[2:12:09] doorpost
[2:12:11] to be born again Christians of [music]
[2:12:14] God, not tossed about here and there.
[2:12:18] But Lord, I place them all in your
[2:12:19] hands. Father, you bless all the young
[2:12:22] people, Lord, the children, Lord, all
[2:12:24] the departments, Father. What a
[2:12:25] beautiful church. Lord that is here
[2:12:27] today, Father.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; May they grow, Lord. May they stay

[2:24:30] Dear Lord Jesus, heavenly father, Lord,
[2:24:33] we come before you with thankfulness
[2:24:34] [music] and gratefulness. Lord, thank
[2:24:37] you for the message that we heard this
[2:24:39] morning. Lord, I pray that you would
[2:24:40] bless brother Louise, Lord, very greatly
[2:24:42] [music] for his efforts, Lord. Oh, God,
[2:24:45] for his his ministry and his labor,
[2:24:47] Lord, here in the church this [music]

[2:24:54] Lord.
[2:24:56] Oh, God. I just think of [music] how
[2:24:59] Lord you started your church Lord. you
[2:25:02] put your spirit in your church, Lord,
[2:25:03] [music]
[2:25:04] and how it veered off, Lord. But how you
[2:25:07] knew that it would, and how you sent,
[2:25:09] [music] Lord, a restoration ministry in
[2:25:11] this last day, Lord, you didn't have to
[2:25:14] do that, Lord. No obligations, Lord, but
[2:25:17] you in your loving kindness, Lord.
[2:25:21] You came down, Lord, and said, [music]
[2:25:23] "This is the way. Walk therein." Oh God,
[2:25:27] in this day of Lord gloomy darkness,
[2:25:29] it's not fully dark, not fully light,
[2:25:32] Lord. It's deceptive, Lord. But oh God,
[2:25:35] [music]
[2:25:36] you said your people have observed a
[2:25:40] great light.
[2:25:42] Oh Lord Jesus, we're so thankful [music]
[2:25:44] for that, Lord. for the spirit that
[2:25:47] you've placed in the church to combat,
[2:25:49] Lord, the spirit of Antichrist in
[2:25:51] [music] this day to rise up out of it,
[2:25:53] Lord, to rise a little higher. The
[2:25:56] spirit of an eagle, Lord, you've said to
[2:25:58] [music] your church, come out of her. Be
[2:26:00] not partaker of her her sins and her
[2:26:03] iniquities, [music] Lord Jesus, in this
[2:26:05] confusion of Babylon. So thankful for
[2:26:08] that, Lord Jesus. [music] What would we
[2:26:09] do without it? Oh, God. on our own. We
[2:26:12] had no chance, no shot, [music] Lord.
[2:26:17] And oh God, I pray that you would, Lord,
[2:26:19] give us all the character of of Rebecca,
[2:26:22] Lord. How that speaks to us, Lord, this
[2:26:24] morning. Oh God, that that labor, Lord,
[2:26:28] the bride has made herself ready, you
[2:26:30] said. Oh God, [music] feeding the very
[2:26:33] power, Lord, that would take her to her
[2:26:36] her bridegroom. Lord Jesus, let us be
[2:26:39] found doing the work of the Lord. Lord,
[2:26:42] believing, Lord, trusting, oh God, day
[2:26:46] by day.
[2:26:48] Please be with brother Israel, Lord, in
[2:26:50] his [music]
[2:26:51] ministry, Lord. Give him safe travel.
[2:26:53] Give him safe passage, Lord. Bless,
[2:26:55] Lord, greatly the meetings that he went
[2:26:57] out, Lord, there to be a part of, Lord.
[2:27:00] And let your spirit move and work
[2:27:02] through him, Lord. Work in those
[2:27:03] meetings. Bring a blessing, Lord. or
[2:27:06] bring a unity of the bride of Christ,
[2:27:07] Lord. We're detached from them
[2:27:10] physically, Lord, but oh God, we know
[2:27:13] that we're one in in the spirit of
[2:27:15] Christ.
[2:27:17] Bless us, Lord. Watch over us. Keep us
[2:27:19] all close to you, Lord. I pray that you
[2:27:22] would bring us back at the appointed
[2:27:23] time to hear from you, Lord, and just
[2:27:25] receive [music] from you a little
[2:27:26] higher, Lord, a step further in you,

[2:28:06] Let it shine
[2:28:09] on [singing] me.
[2:28:12] Let [music] the light
[2:28:14] from [singing] the lighthouse
[2:28:18] shine [music]
[2:28:20] on me.
[2:28:25] Amen. So, [music] just a couple of
[2:28:26] announcements. Choir practice at 3:30
[2:28:29] this afternoon for those who are in the
[2:28:30] choir.
[2:28:31] Um, and then there will be [music] no
[2:28:33] communion tonight. So, brother Chris,
[2:28:35] thank you for for reminding us of that.
[2:28:37] So, um, Sister P, do you by chance know
[2:28:41] that song, [music] Silver and Gold have
[2:28:42] I none, but such as I have give I thee?
[2:28:45] And we won't we won't try that one. But
[2:28:47] just I was thinking when [music] brother
[2:28:49] Luis was sharing um about just with with
[2:28:53] the Catholic church and having to pay
[2:28:54] the [music] priest and how far people
[2:28:56] had come in in a short period of time
[2:28:59] from back to the initiation [music] of
[2:29:00] the church which was that open door of
[2:29:02] Pentecost. So we read about that in
[2:29:04] chapter 2 of Acts. Chapter 3 starts out
[2:29:06] with John and Peter which they say was
[2:29:09] the first [music] pope on the way to the
[2:29:11] temple to pray. And there was a lame man
[2:29:14] that was brought to the gate beautiful
[2:29:16] at the entrance to the temple. And
[2:29:19] [music] it was the exact opposite of
[2:29:21] that. It wasn't Peter or John, can I pay
[2:29:24] you [music] something? But it was
[2:29:26] asking, can you pay me something? You
[2:29:28] know, arms for the poor. And they said,
[2:29:30] silver and gold have I none, but such as
[2:29:32] I have give I thee. In the name of Jesus
[2:29:36] Christ [music] of Nazareth, rise up and
[2:29:38] walk. And he went leaping, shouting, and
[2:29:40] praising God. Amen. is that [music] is
[2:29:44] that's our standard. That's what we look
[2:29:46] at. That's the image in our mind. That's
[2:29:48] [music] where that's back at back to
[2:29:51] Pentecost. And we started the service
[2:29:53] today with what is the Holy Ghost?
[2:29:54] What's it given for? [music] And that's
[2:29:57] the open door is that open door of
[2:29:58] Pentecost. And so, amen. Lord, just
[2:30:02] that's my expectation. I want to see a
[2:30:04] church that's on fire and we have
[2:30:05] somebody that comes in with a need and
[2:30:07] is they go leaping and shouting and
[2:30:09] [music] praising God. Amen.
[2:30:14] I said I wouldn't do it and but [music]
[2:30:15] so I won't. Amen. Key of F. When the
[2:30:18] redeemed are gathering in as you go. I
