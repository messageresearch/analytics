[27:19] are, Lord.
[27:21] Oh God. And she went before the king and
[27:24] he extended the supplr to her, Lord.
[27:28] Lord, he she interceded for her for her
[27:32] raise for the Jews, Lord. And we come
[27:34] and intercede for our loved ones, Lord
[27:36] Jesus.

[27:41] brothers and my sisters, my co-workers,
[27:44] Lord, everybody, Lord, we we intercede
[27:47] like from like Esther there, Lord.

[27:59] for a body change, Lord God. You said,
[28:02] prophet said it's not hard to ask for it

[28:51] shoulders, Lord. Oh God, give him peace
[28:54] in his heart, Lord. And give him
[28:56] courage, Lord, to to speak the word,
[29:00] Lord. Take off the gloves and tell us
[29:02] the truth, Lord. I pray thee, we love
[29:05] you and appreciate you, Lord. We commit
[29:08] this [music] service into your hands for
[29:09] your keeping in the name of the Lord
[29:11] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[29:21] Jesus,
[29:23] I just want [singing] to thank you.
[29:32] Yes, [music and singing] Jesus.
[29:35] I just want [singing]
[29:37] to thank
[29:41] you.

[29:43] Yes, [singing] Jesus.
[29:46] I just want to [music and singing] thank
[29:50] you.
[29:54] [music] Want to [singing] thank you
[29:57] for being
[29:59] [music] so good.
[30:02] Tell him again, [singing] I want to
[30:04] praise you, Lord Jesus.
[30:08] I just [singing and music] want to
[30:12] praise you,
[30:16] Lord Jesus.
[30:20] I [music and singing] just want to
[30:23] praise
[30:25] [singing]
[30:26] you,
[30:29] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[30:31] I just want to
[30:34] praise you.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; I want to praise you
[30:42] for being
[30:45] so good. One more time. I just want to
[30:48] praise [music and singing] you.
[30:50] Oh Jesus,
[30:54] I just want
[30:57] to praise you.
[31:00] Praise your name, Lord
[31:03] Jesus.
[31:06] Just want
[31:09] praise
[31:11] you,
[31:14] Jesus.
[31:17] I just want
[31:20] to praise [singing] you.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Praise you,
[31:29] &gt;&gt; [singing and music]
[31:29] &gt;&gt; be
[31:31] so good.
[31:34] Amen. God bless you, saints. Welcome to
[31:36] the house of [music] the Lord tonight.
[31:38] Always good to come into his presence to
[31:41] feast on the good things of God. Amen.
[31:44] Certainly enjoyed the service this
[31:46] morning. Always enjoy the presence of
[31:48] the Lord. Amen. Tonight, we're going to
[31:52] finish that tape. We have about
[31:55] um just about an hour or so of the
[31:59] prophet going into that message. He
[32:01] started the scripture in 1 Samuel
[32:03] chapter 8 verses 4 and 10. And I'm going
[32:06] to read that again just to set the tone
[32:09] and he'll get into some greater things
[32:12] for us tonight.
[32:14] And I thank the Lord for each of you.
[32:18] Um,
[32:21] I know some
[32:24] one of the brothers said some really
[32:26] nice things. He loved the message and he
[32:30] likes to hear when I preach too. And I
[32:33] certainly appreciate that. But I know
[32:35] that for believers, we know there's no
[32:39] replacement for the prophet. Amen. And
[32:42] um you know every 20 years, 30 years or
[32:46] so, pastors, they have to leave the
[32:48] scene and um the believers have to
[32:52] continue on and the Lord will raise up
[32:55] someone else and whoever that is, they
[32:57] will be pointing you to the message of
[32:59] the hour. And so we know that the
[33:01] message you can't there's no replacement
[33:04] for that. Amen.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; And so I certainly appreciate the the
[33:09] gifts, all the gifts that God has. I
[33:10] love to hear good preaching and I love
[33:13] to hear the tapes as well and but I
[33:16] don't want
[33:18] because I like to hear good preaching to
[33:21] people to think that I'm have something
[33:23] against the prophet and that's what they
[33:25] try to make you do. Pick one or the
[33:27] other. Uh I love to hear the prophet
[33:30] preach
[33:31] &gt;&gt; and I love to hear good preaching too
[33:34] and they're all in the word of the Lord.
[33:36] because I I don't feel guilty by doing
[33:39] one or the other or we shouldn't. Amen.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; It's God's word, God's blessing to us.
[33:45] And um brother Rick had some things to
[33:48] say at the end of the service there. And
[33:50] I know I put questions in some of your
[33:53] minds in two days or three days. And my
[33:56] position is always that however many
[33:59] days, whatever is to take place, we are
[34:02] commanded to be ready anyways.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; Is that right? And so that's the
[34:09] commandment for the bride is just to be
[34:11] ready. I remember when Y2K hit just
[34:14] before the year 2000 struck. How many
[34:17] were around all the bottled water and
[34:20] the storing up cans and this and that?
[34:23] and how about let's just be ready.
[34:27] [laughter]
[34:28] And I get the natural element, but
[34:30] really we're believers. And so we thank
[34:32] God he's already called us to be ready.
[34:35] 1st Samuel chapter 8 and verse
[34:44] number 4-10.
[34:46] Then all the elders of Israel gathered
[34:48] themselves together, and came to Samuel
[34:51] unto Rama, and said unto him, "Behold,
[34:53] thou art old, and thy sons walk not in
[34:56] thy ways. Now make us a king to judge us
[34:59] like all the nations." But the king But
[35:03] the thing displeased Samuel when they
[35:05] said, "Give us a king to judge us." And
[35:08] Samuel prayed unto the Lord. And the
[35:11] Lord said unto Samuel, "Hearken unto the
[35:13] voice of the people, and all that they
[35:15] say unto thee, for they have not
[35:18] rejected thee, but they have rejected
[35:21] me, that I should not reign over them,
[35:25] according to all the works which they
[35:28] have done since the day I brought them
[35:30] up out of Egypt, even unto this day.
[35:34] wherewith they have forsaken me and
[35:36] served other gods, so do they also unto
[35:40] thee. Now therefore hearken unto their
[35:43] voice, how be it yet protest solemnly
[35:48] unto them, and show them the manner of
[35:51] king that shall reign over them. And
[35:53] Samuel told all the words of the Lord
[35:55] unto the people that asked of him a
[35:57] king. And he said, "This king will be
[36:01] the manner of a king that shall reign
[36:03] over you. He'll take your sons, appoint
[36:05] them for himself, for his chariots to be
[36:08] his horsemen, and some shall run before
[36:11] his chariots."
[36:13] And Samuel continues on in that warning.
[36:16] And uh it's a very uh sobering portion
[36:19] of scripture. It'd be nice for you to
[36:22] continue to read that, get the full
[36:24] context of it. We're going to go right
[36:26] into the message. I'd like to welcome
[36:29] this couple here. I don't know who these
[36:30] folks are. Maybe I know. Do I know you
[36:32] all?
[36:34] No.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; I used to know you.
[36:38] Okay. God bless you. Welcome. All right.
[36:41] Welcome to the house of the Lord. Amen.
[36:44] And so, as we prepare to go to this
[36:46] portion of the message, only believe. We
[36:49] had a visitor [music] this morning. He
[36:51] was from the neighborhood his first time
[36:53] here and he said he wanted to come by
[36:55] and see what was it all about and so he
[36:59] [music] heard why we're against
[37:01] organized religion.
[37:04] So he stayed for the whole thing. So God
[37:06] bless him. Pray for him. [music] I
[37:08] didn't catch his name but he lives here
[37:10] somewhere. So amen. Let's sing that.
[37:13] Only
[37:15] believe.
[37:19] Only
[37:21] believe
[37:25] that all things are possible. [singing]
[37:31] Only
[37:33] believe.
[37:37] Only
[37:39] believe.
[37:42] Only [singing]
[37:44] believe.
[37:48] All things are possible.
[37:54] Only
[37:57] God bless you. You may be seated,
[37:58] brother Brandham.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; The way Moses was.
[38:05] That's the reason he fell ON HIS FACE
[38:07] BEFORE GOD AND SAID, "GOD, YOU SENT ME."
[38:09] HE SAID, "SEPARATE yourself from that
[38:11] bunch."
[38:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; See what I mean?
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So always been the thing that
[38:18] twisted man's mind got him off the will
[38:20] of God. Now remember fortold by his word
[38:25] and PROPERLY ABINDICATED BY HIS WORD.
[38:29] Now Jesus SAID IF I DO NOT the works of
[38:31] God then don't believe me.
[38:36] If I miss say who you can condemn me of
[38:39] sin,
[38:40] &gt;&gt; who you can show me that I'm an
[38:42] unbeliever.
[38:46] Nicodemus said, "We know you're a rabbi.
[38:48] You come from God because nobody could
[38:50] do those things unless God was with
[38:51] him." So he surely he was a believer.
[38:54] Now we who know church history, now put
[38:58] on your thinking caps.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; It's not late yet.
[39:04] So, just listen real close now. And I'll
[39:06] try to be just quick as I can. I I won't
[39:09] listen close to the tape.
[39:13] Now, anyone who's ever read church
[39:17] history knows that the first time that
[39:21] Christianity was ever organized was the
[39:23] Roman Catholic Church.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Now, if there's any time before that, I
[39:29] want somebody to bring the history and
[39:30] show me. I'm a bosom friend of Paul
[39:32] Boyd. Many great historians. I've got in
[39:35] my study there the postNE council, the
[39:38] Nyian council, Nyine fathers, all the
[39:42] sacred writings of the church that I
[39:44] know of. 33 years I've studied them,
[39:48] looked over them. There was never an
[39:50] organization. The Catholic Church is a
[39:53] mother of organizations.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; We know that. That's the truth. Never
[39:58] was a church organized. had a
[40:00] denomination until the Catholic Church
[40:02] and the word Catholic means universal
[40:05] and they made a state church religion
[40:07] and made it over all the dominion of
[40:10] Rome and it had about the be best part
[40:12] of the world conquered at that time. It
[40:14] was a state church and those who would
[40:16] not obey it was put to death.
[40:19] the NSA council 15 days of bloody battle
[40:22] when real prophets of God when they
[40:25] stood up there on those that Catholic
[40:27] church why it first started while we all
[40:29] know it I've taught it here
[40:31] &gt;&gt; how really Aquilla Priscilla was a
[40:34] pastor
[40:36] Aquilla was a pastor of
[40:40] of the Roman church when the Holy Ghost
[40:42] fell on Pentecost it fell on the Jews
[40:45] out of every nation under heaven but a
[40:47] few days after that Peter had a vision
[40:49] on the housetop to go up to Carneliuses,
[40:51] a Roman, a just man, and he prayed and
[40:56] the Holy Ghost fell on him. After while
[40:58] the dignitaries begin to receive it,
[41:00] Aquil and Priscilla went into into uh
[41:03] Rome and they organized or never
[41:05] organized but set in order the first
[41:07] Roman church. And when they did, they
[41:10] had their their brethren and sisters and
[41:13] Claudius in his reign excommunicated all
[41:16] Jews from Rome. And that's the very time
[41:18] that the Roman Catholic Church said
[41:19] Peter was in Rome.
[41:22] Show me one scripture where Peter ever
[41:24] was in Rome.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Or any history that says he was
[41:30] he wasn't according to the word of God.
[41:33] And that's what I believe. And how could
[41:35] Peter, a Jew, ever put up with idolatry
[41:38] and stuff that they have of worshiping
[41:40] idols and things?
[41:42] &gt;&gt; How would he go against his own teaching
[41:43] here? Amen.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Nonsense.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; No more than that than the Protestant is
[41:48] too.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; We'll get to it in an extra while
[41:51] &gt;&gt; by and by. The Lord willing. Notice
[41:54] &gt;&gt; notice. Now we find out that the very
[41:57] time that the church says that Peter was
[41:59] in Rome, the history says that Claudius
[42:02] and the Bible said also had ordered all
[42:06] Jews out of Rome.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; And Paul passed through Ephesus and come
[42:12] to the upper coast there. He finds these
[42:14] disciples and they had been up there
[42:16] visiting Aquilla and Priscilla after
[42:19] their going away. Then the Roman
[42:22] brethren in this church begin to form
[42:24] their own ideas and they added idolatry.
[42:28] And then Constantine which is mother was
[42:31] a real Christian and hoped her boy would
[42:34] be but he was a politician AND HE SAW
[42:37] THAT most of Rome or a big part of it of
[42:40] the poor class had already accepted
[42:43] salvation through Christ. And then they
[42:46] would begin to come very popper because
[42:47] they were taking down Venus and putting
[42:50] up Mary and taking down Jupiter and
[42:52] putting up Peter and so forth like that
[42:54] and and the disciples and it was a very
[42:56] popular religion AND THEY WERE GALLANT
[42:58] THEY AND CHRISTIANS WOULD DIE. The
[43:01] Catholic Church said we were the
[43:02] beginning that's exactly the truth. The
[43:04] Catholic Church begin at the day of
[43:06] Pentecost. But here's WHAT GOT HER OUT.
[43:08] SHE organized
[43:10] and ejected from the word dogmas. And
[43:13] the latest dogma, you people over 10
[43:16] years old can remember the latest dogma,
[43:17] the ascension of Mary
[43:19] &gt;&gt; about 10 years ago. Another dogma added
[43:22] to the church. Instead of scripture,
[43:24] IT'S DOGMA. And they'll give you
[43:26] understand right now. THEY DON'T CARE
[43:27] WHAT THE SCRIPTURE SAYS. It's what the
[43:28] church says. They a priest told me, HE
[43:31] SAID, "GOD IS IN HIS CHURCH." I SAID,
[43:33] "GOD IS IN HIS WORD."
[43:37] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, that Bible is just the
[43:39] history of THE EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH." I
[43:42] SAID, "DAN, I'm an early Catholic."
[43:46] &gt;&gt; I said, "That makes me more Catholic
[43:48] than you being a priest."
[43:51] &gt;&gt; I said, "If that's it, then I'm that." I
[43:54] said, "You see, I BELIEVE EXACTLY WHAT
[43:56] THE APOSTLES TAUGHT. YOU BELIEVE WHAT
[43:58] MAN IS INJECTED into it."
[44:01] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly the way it went.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Sure it was. It went that exactly that
[44:06] way. Now, notice history. Then they
[44:08] begin to add dogmas. Dalma. AND WHEN
[44:12] PAUL came over, we know according to
[44:14] history THAT HE DID NOT EVEN VISIT that
[44:17] first church because he could not stand
[44:19] idolatry. And he visit the second church
[44:22] which they had established. Second
[44:24] church of Rome. And when that n see a
[44:26] council come where Constantine seen the
[44:29] idea to unite his kingdom, the very same
[44:31] thing Ahab did with Jezebel marrying
[44:34] down there. Amen.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; See, and when he seen a chance to unite
[44:37] his people and MAKE A GREAT POWERFUL
[44:39] nation out of it, he thought they'd get
[44:40] their religion. So he made him A CHURCH
[44:43] STATE RELIGION. And when they had that
[44:45] nasty council and these questions come
[44:48] up, whether there was one God or three,
[44:50] whether they should baptize in the name
[44:52] of Jesus Christ or father, son, holy
[44:54] ghost, all these other questions brought
[44:56] the the showdown in there. And when it
[44:58] did, some of them old prophets COME UP
[45:00] OUT THERE WITH NOTHING BUT SHEEP SKIN
[45:01] WRAPPED AROUND THEM AND EATING HERBS,
[45:05] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BUT THEM BIG DIGNITARIANS THAT
[45:07] HAD ALREADY WORKED THEIR WAY INTO THE
[45:09] CHURCH, SHUT THEM UP WITH WORLDLY
[45:10] WISDOM, BUT THEY HAD THUS SAYETH THE
[45:12] LORD.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; She went into pagan darkness for about a
[45:16] thousand years, but she broke forth
[45:19] again to bloom. That's right. You can't
[45:22] kill it. I will restore, sayeth the
[45:24] Lord, all the years these things them
[45:27] denominations added dogma.
[45:30] AND TO DO THIS, to add dogma, the only
[45:35] way that any church,
[45:40] the only way that any DENOMINATION
[45:43] CAN EVER GET AWAY FROM THE WORD OF GOD
[45:46] IS TO ADD DOGMA INSTEAD OF THE sacred
[45:50] scriptures.
[45:52] is to try to make your tradition OR THE
[45:55] DOCTRINE OF YOUR CHURCH GO BE CONTRARY
[45:58] TO THE SCRIPTURES. THEN HOW CAN YOU
[46:00] CONDEMN THE CATHOLIC church when you're
[46:03] doing the same thing they did?
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Do you understand?
[46:10] &gt;&gt; All right. When I think
[46:14] the scriptures can't fail,
[46:17] &gt;&gt; DOGMAS IS [screaming] A LIE TO BEGIN
[46:19] WITH.
[46:22] And when YOU ACCEPT THE DENOMINATION,
[46:24] YOU'VE ALREADY GOT A
[46:25] &gt;&gt; DOCUMENT
[46:26] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING ADDED. IT'S NOT
[46:28] IN THE SCRIPTURE.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; LORD, HELP.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT IN THE SCRIPTURE.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; There's no such a thing as organization.
[46:38] Jesus never said, "I commission you to
[46:40] go into all the world, make
[46:42] organization."
[46:44] No, sir. No such a thing. To do this is
[46:47] to reject the sacred scriptures. When
[46:50] this was done, it was changed from
[46:54] church by birth to CHURCH BY DOGMA AND
[46:59] CREED. NOT CHURCH, let me apologize,
[47:03] lodge.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; You're born into the church, but you
[47:06] join a lodge.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; IT ISN'T BAPTIST CHURCH, METHODIST
[47:10] CHURCH, Pentecostal church. It's Baptist
[47:12] lodge, Pentecostal lodge,
[47:15] &gt;&gt; and Methodist lodge.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; You join them. You can't join church.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; There's no such A THING. YOU'RE BORN
[47:22] INTO IT.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Nicodemus is told that.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; So you see where you're at.
[47:28] Oh my.
[47:30] That's why I'm against it. Not against
[47:33] the people in it. The system that I'm
[47:36] against. Cuz they can't one of them
[47:39] elders or something, one of them
[47:40] churches preach something that's in the
[47:42] Bible. It's contrary to that doctrine,
[47:44] that uh charter that they have in that
[47:46] church. He's excommunicated right like
[47:47] that.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Some of them so nasty they
[47:52] won't even let a revival come to another
[47:54] church unless it be one of their own
[47:55] man.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; While there's a somebody one time was
[47:59] going to give a preacher right here in
[48:01] this country, a little old preacher
[48:02] stand out on our street crying and
[48:04] begging for repentance and saying, "COME
[48:07] RECEIVE CHRIST. BE FILLED WITH THE Holy
[48:10] Ghost." and things like that. And
[48:12] someone out of a Pentecostal
[48:13] organization come up and give a man a
[48:15] dollar in his hands and had to go repent
[48:17] because he committed adultery
[48:20] against his church. Talk about Catholic.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; That's right. You know what I'm talking
[48:27] about, too. This church does anyhow. All
[48:30] right. Does this reject the scriptures?
[48:33] When this is done, it is changed. Then
[48:36] when you add dogma and join an
[48:39] organization, you have automatically re
[48:42] accepted your first dogma
[48:46] because it's not scriptural. So it's
[48:48] something added and a dogma is something
[48:50] added take place of it's taking place of
[48:53] the birth. When you accept the
[48:54] denomination, you have added dogma. All
[48:57] right. When this is done, then it's
[49:00] changed from church by birth to lodge by
[49:05] dogma or creed.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; For see, it's dogma in itself,
[49:14] not think scripturally. Now, Jesus never
[49:20] said, "Go into all the world and make
[49:23] denominations. Go organize the people
[49:26] together." He said, "Go make disciples."
[49:32] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; So, you see, you're all together.
[49:40] Listen, watch here. Let's close it on
[49:43] something here. Drive something down
[49:45] tight right this time.
[49:47] How many has a Greek leon? The emphatic
[49:50] dialogue from the old manuscript. Greek.
[49:53] All right. Read it. Get any scholar that
[49:57] you want to get into the library and get
[50:00] the lexon, Greek lexon, read Revelation
[50:04] 17.
[50:05] And when you read there, the King James
[50:08] version here says, "And this, he carried
[50:11] me away in the spirit, and I saw a woman
[50:13] sitting upon a scarlet clothed beast
[50:15] full of of
[50:18] names of blasphemy."
[50:21] Now, that's what the King James said,
[50:23] but the original interpretation said,
[50:25] "Carry me away in the spirit, and I saw
[50:28] a woman full of blasphemous names."
[50:33] &gt;&gt; There's a whole lot of difference
[50:34] between
[50:37] names of blasphemy and blasphemous
[50:40] names. Now, watch, we all understand and
[50:43] know that that was the Roman church
[50:45] sitting on seven hills, controlling the
[50:48] powers of the world.
[50:49] And she was called a
[50:52] &gt;&gt; And she was a mother of harlots.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; What? What is a harlot? Could it be a
[51:00] man? Has to be a woman.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; So if it's a woman, it has to be a
[51:05] church.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; She was a mother of harlots the same as
[51:10] she was.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; And look, watch in her.
[51:16] Let it soak. in her
[51:20] was
[51:21] blasphemous names. What is it now
[51:26] ministers here and on the tape? Let's
[51:29] hold your peace. WHAT IS THOSE
[51:31] blasphemous names? Methodists, Baptist,
[51:34] Presbyterian, Lutheran, Pentecostals, SO
[51:38] FORTH. BLASPHEMOUS NAMES BECAUSE IT'S
[51:40] ORGANIZATIONS HOARD THEM TO GOD JUST
[51:43] LIKE SHE WAS. AND they in THOSE GROUPS
[51:46] OF PEOPLE SAY, "WELL, HE'S A METHODIST
[51:48] AND DO THIS. HE'S PENTECOSTAL AND DOES
[51:50] THIS. HE'S PRESBYTERIAN and does this."
[51:52] They do everything on the calendar. You
[51:56] know that.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; And what is it? IT'S NAMES THAT OUGHT TO
[52:00] BE CHRISTLIKE AND CALLED BY THE NAME OF
[52:03] CHRISTIAN AND IT'S blasphemous names.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT CHURCHES.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE FALSELY CALLED CHURCH.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE LODGES.
[52:17] Now you see why I'm against organization
[52:19] not the people
[52:21] the system of organization
[52:25] &gt;&gt; the blasphemous names watch of LODGES
[52:30] FALSELY CALL CHURCHES Methodist church
[52:34] Baptist church Presbyterian church
[52:36] Pentecostal church Lutheran church
[52:38] United BRETHREN CHURCH THERE'S NO SUCH
[52:40] THING
[52:41] &gt;&gt; THAT'S UNSCRIPTURAL
[52:43] &gt;&gt; THERE'S ONLY ONE CHURCH.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; AND YOU CAN'T JOIN IT.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE BORN INTO IT. YOU'RE
[52:50] PREDESTINATED TO IT.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; THE MYTHICAL BODY OF JESUS CHRIST. THE
[52:55] MYSTICAL BODY RATHER OF JESUS CHRIST
[52:57] HERE ON EARTH WITH THE WORD BEING MADE
[53:00] MANIFEST.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Sons and daughters of God. They belong
[53:06] to none of come out from among us.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Watch quickly now. I don't want to tire
[53:13] you,
[53:15] but if you just give me a few more
[53:16] minutes now,
[53:18] &gt;&gt; I'll go as quick as I can, but I want
[53:20] you to be sure to get it so that you
[53:24] won't miss it.
[53:26] Remember, mother Rome
[53:29] was found in her floral OF BLASPHEMOUS
[53:33] NAMES,
[53:35] a mother of harlots. THEN IF THEY ARE
[53:38] HARLOTS, WHAT IS A HARLOT? What is a
[53:40] Same thing as a harlot.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; It's a woman that lives untrue to her
[53:46] marriage vow.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; And any church that claims to be the
[53:51] church OF CHRIST AND DENIES GOD'S WORD,
[53:55] SHE'S UNTRUE TO HER MARRIAGE BACK.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; THEN SHE COMMITS ADULTERY BY ADDING
[54:01] DOGMA, HOARDING THEM WITH THE WORLD AND
[54:04] HER WISDOM INSTEAD OF ACCEPTING CHRIST
[54:06] AND THE POWER OF his
[54:08] ghost. Hallelujah. Amen.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; And she's a mother of harlots that done
[54:15] the same thing.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Pop don't call kidd greasy. You know,
[54:21] &gt;&gt; see,
[54:23] six of one, half a dozen the other. Some
[54:26] of these people run along just making
[54:28] fun of the Catholic and belong to one of
[54:30] the same thing themselves.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; She was a mother of the false baptism
[54:36] and water. Amen.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; She's a mother of the false evidence of
[54:39] the Holy Ghost.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; And you follow her right along with her.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Now, let's see. Is that true, Brother
[54:48] Brandham? Hold your peace just a moment.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; See, she is the mother of blasphemous
[54:54] names of lodges that the people has
[54:58] joined
[54:59] and bring a reproach.
[55:02] Live anyway.
[55:04] Wear shorts. Women with bobbed hair
[55:07] painted up,
[55:08] &gt;&gt; sing in choir, smoke cigarettes, take
[55:10] communion.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; All kinds of filth of the world. It's a
[55:15] stumbling block
[55:18] &gt;&gt; to the unbeliever.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Didn't Timothy speak of it the Holy
[55:25] Spirit?
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Watch. See, she Rome is the MOTHER OF
[55:31] EVERY ONE of them.
[55:36] See, you did exactly in your
[55:38] organization just like what she did.
[55:41] Inject dogmas instead of the word
[55:43] because a group of man said it together.
[55:45] The preseters and the bishops and so
[55:47] forth had to be this way. And that's
[55:49] exactly what took place at Rome.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; And you try to, my pastor, brother,
[55:55] accept the full word of God. And look
[55:56] where you go.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Right out the door.
[56:01] Amen.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Now, we'll see if God told you to or not
[56:04] in a few minutes. See?
[56:05] &gt;&gt; All right. See, she's a mother of
[56:08] everyone because she was the first one
[56:10] to take away the writings of the
[56:13] scripture and add DOGMA BECAUSE SHE
[56:15] REJECTED ANOINTED PROPHETS WHO HAD THE
[56:18] VINDICATED life of the word
[56:22] &gt;&gt; for their intelligence, smart man, Roman
[56:25] emperors and so forth that had accepted
[56:27] Christianity but won't accept it in
[56:29] their own way. See, that's right. They
[56:32] want it in your own way. Non wanted to
[56:34] get rid of his leprosy in the waters of
[56:36] his own country. He didn't like the
[56:37] muddy waters of Jordan. But if you ever
[56:40] get rid of his leprosy, he had to walk
[56:41] out there in that mud just exact like
[56:43] the prophet told him.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; God don't have respected person.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Notice she is the first denomination.
[56:53] Look at her daughters
[56:55] done the same thing. Added creeds and
[56:57] dogmas instead of the word. Don't tell
[57:00] me. Show me one that's not off of it.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Show me one pastor that'll accept the
[57:05] truth that they won't turn you out on
[57:07] it.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Unless you're so popular that you know
[57:10] they have to hold on to you for your
[57:12] popularity or something. It's all right.
[57:14] Now look at Revelations 18 just for a
[57:18] few minutes. The next verse over the
[57:20] next chapter after Revelation 17 had
[57:25] explored and and had showed the mystery
[57:31] of this misdablin.
[57:34] The 17th
[57:36] chapter of Revelations explains that she
[57:40] is a church that sits on seven hills,
[57:43] &gt;&gt; the Vatican City and rules all the kings
[57:46] of the earth. That's exactly what's
[57:48] right in the president's too and so
[57:50] forth.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; So, um,
[57:53] &gt;&gt; but she's there holding the wealth of
[57:56] her world in her hand. Exactly. Who's
[57:59] able to make war with her? That's
[58:02] &gt;&gt; right. We all know that. But why would
[58:05] you belong to something that's connected
[58:06] with her? Amen.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Now notice in the 18th chapter, the very
[58:13] next chapter after her mystery has been
[58:17] explained
[58:18] sits in the temple of God. Now here are
[58:20] the Zella Breakman. Are you here tonight
[58:22] Zella? She brought it's in the room in
[58:24] there now. our Sunday visitor the
[58:27] Catholic paper and the Catholic paper
[58:30] was answering a minister said did you
[58:32] say reverend that did the u in the Roman
[58:37] numeral over the Vatican or over the
[58:40] pope's throne is written vicarious
[58:43] filillion which it means that it in the
[58:46] catholic dascese there that that is the
[58:49] the number of the beast of the
[58:52] apocalypse why he said certainly it
[58:55] It's exactly spells out 666.
[58:59] It's exactly and the Roman dascese
[59:03] admitted that it does. But here's their
[59:05] answer. Smart, full of wisdom. Said,
[59:09] "But you know your name in a certain
[59:11] language might spell out the same
[59:12] thing."
[59:14] This man said, "Mine almost the same
[59:17] thing in some language." He spelled it
[59:18] out. Said, "See, I'm almost 666, too."
[59:22] Said, "There's been hundreds of them."
[59:24] said, "Every time anything raises up,
[59:26] somebody's got a 666."
[59:28] And said, "Rever, did you know in one
[59:31] language your own name might spell out
[59:34] Antichrist?"
[59:36] said, "Why do you look at such things
[59:38] that look at the wisdom, but the Holy
[59:41] Spirit knows better?" Watch
[59:44] &gt;&gt; that might be my name might spell out
[59:46] 666, but I don't meet the rest of the
[59:49] qualification. If I don't set up on a
[59:51] hill, I don't say these things. I'm not
[59:53] a governor or nothing. That's right.
[59:55] That's the one he's talking about.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; So your worldly wisdom comes to nothing,
[59:59] sir.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Right. In the presence of the Holy
[1:00:02] Spirit.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; I don't meet the rest of it. But he
[1:00:07] does. Sets in the temple of God showing
[1:00:09] himself he is God and sets on seven
[1:00:11] hills. I don't sit on seven heels and
[1:00:12] death spell 666. I don't meet the rest
[1:00:15] of it, but he does. See, there you are.
[1:00:19] See? So, we rely on the Holy Spirit.
[1:00:22] Take no thought what you're going to say
[1:00:24] because it's not you that speaks. It's
[1:00:26] the father. So how can your wisdom and
[1:00:29] your new birth from above ever compare
[1:00:32] with these things here on earth? These
[1:00:35] we mighty magicians in it while they
[1:00:37] know every LITTLE CROOKED CORNER. HOW
[1:00:39] COULD MOSES STAND WHEN HE FOLLOWED THE
[1:00:41] COMMANDMENTS OF GOD TO THROW DOWN HIS
[1:00:43] STICK AND IT TURNED INTO a serpent and
[1:00:45] here come the magicians UP AND DONE THE
[1:00:47] SAME THING. But Moses stood still
[1:00:50] knowing he'd follow the word of God and
[1:00:52] his serpent eat the rest of them up.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; When you've obeyed and got what could he
[1:00:58] DO WHEN HE LED HIM TO THE LAND OF
[1:00:59] PROMISE and there WAS A RED SEA BOBLING
[1:01:01] them in but God's path went right
[1:01:03] through it.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; SAID STAND STILL AND SEE THE GLORY OF
[1:01:09] GOD.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; When it's in a path of duty of following
[1:01:12] the word, stand there and watch it open
[1:01:14] up.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:16] I'm 53 years old. Been serving him for
[1:01:19] about 33 years. Wish I had 10 million
[1:01:21] years to serve him. I've never seen him
[1:01:24] fail yet
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; when his word is kept. That's right. Now
[1:01:27] look, immediately after her sin, her
[1:01:31] secrets was discovered. We've had that a
[1:01:34] long time ago. We know it. Now, the next
[1:01:37] chapter, look at Revelations 18. May I
[1:01:40] just turn to it just a minute? It might
[1:01:42] be a good thing. It won't take us but
[1:01:44] just a few minutes longer. might mean a
[1:01:46] little something to you. I hope it does.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Now, we see here in the 17th chapter,
[1:01:51] the fifth verse, upon her forehead was a
[1:01:54] name written, Mystery Babylon, the great
[1:01:57] the mother of harlots, the abomination
[1:02:00] of the earth. And watch. And I saw the
[1:02:04] woman church drunk with the blood of the
[1:02:06] saints and with the blood of the martyrs
[1:02:08] of Jesus. When I saw her, I wondered
[1:02:11] with great admiration. See see she is
[1:02:14] such a great beautiful thing and she was
[1:02:16] a mother of prostitutes prostitute
[1:02:19] religion denominations exactly what she
[1:02:21] did see because they injected dogmas
[1:02:23] just like she did now look look at
[1:02:26] revelations now that's the 17th chapter
[1:02:29] ends up in the 18th verse now watch
[1:02:32] after these things after her mystery was
[1:02:34] discovered after these things I saw
[1:02:38] another angel come down from heaven
[1:02:40] having great power now Here comes
[1:02:43] another messenger
[1:02:45] coming down next chapter. Her mystery
[1:02:47] was discovered. Now this is now
[1:02:52] the discovery of her mystery and her
[1:02:56] children's mystery. See, we understand
[1:03:01] now exactly what made her a harlot
[1:03:04] because she committed ADULTERY AGAINST
[1:03:07] GOD'S WORD. And that's what made her an
[1:03:09] organization. She couldn't stay a Bible
[1:03:12] church
[1:03:13] and accept that. And neither can any
[1:03:17] organization THAT DON'T TAKE EVERY WORD
[1:03:19] OF IT AWAY IT'S WROTE ever be a Bible
[1:03:21] church.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; And there's none of them that way
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; that I know anything about not a one. So
[1:03:29] there see she organizes the things she
[1:03:32] does
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; both by the scripture and by evidence.
[1:03:36] She dies right there. She accepts the
[1:03:40] dogma. Now look, now that's what
[1:03:42] happened. God sent in this 18th chapter
[1:03:46] a mighty angel. After that mystery was
[1:03:49] known, a mighty angel or a messenger.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Watch here. After these things, I saw
[1:03:55] another angel come down from heaven with
[1:03:57] great power. And the earth was lightened
[1:04:00] by his glory. And he cried with a loud
[1:04:03] voice, babbling, confusion, the great is
[1:04:07] falling. and is become the habitation of
[1:04:10] devils, the whole of every foul spirit,
[1:04:14] and a cage of ever clean and hate
[1:04:16] unclean and hateful bird. And all
[1:04:19] nations have drank of the wine of the
[1:04:20] wrath of her fornications, and the kings
[1:04:23] of their committed fornications with
[1:04:25] her, and the merchants of the earth has
[1:04:27] waxed rich through the abundance of her
[1:04:29] desolence.
[1:04:31] Look, immediately after her mystery was
[1:04:35] made known, who she was, what she was,
[1:04:39] who her daughters was, the mysteries
[1:04:42] BEEN MADE KNOWN, THEN GOD sent an angel,
[1:04:46] a messenger.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; TO WHAT?
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; CALL OUT. [screaming]
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Come out.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour. AMEN.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; That she be not partakers of her
[1:05:04] plagues.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; He's going to curse her.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; WATCH.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; COME OUT OF HER. GOD SENT A MANY MIGHTY
[1:05:13] ANGEL OR A MESSENGER. AND HIS LIGHT
[1:05:16] WASN'T IN A CORNER. IT'S SCATTERED OVER
[1:05:18] THE EARTH.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; COME OUT OF HER.
[1:05:23] WHAT?
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Her and her sisters, too.
[1:05:29] TO LIGHTEN THE EARTH AND CALL HIS PEOPLE
[1:05:33] OUT OF HER.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; NOW, you know that's the truth.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; The name of the Lord.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; A messenger was sent from heaven
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; TO CALL GOD'S PEOPLE OUT OF BABYLON.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; AND HIS LIGHT LIGHTED THE EARTH.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; GREAT Holy Spirit. NOTICE
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS SHE IS A CAGE
[1:06:00] AND HAS CAUGHT hateful
[1:06:05] unclean birds.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Not eagles now. No, no, no.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Vultures.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; UNCLEAN, HATEFUL BIRDS.
[1:06:19] THAT'S WHAT SHE'S CAGED UP AROUND HER.
[1:06:22] SHE IS A CAGE FULL OF THEM.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; A WHOLE CAGE FULL WITH WHAT? BLASPHEMOUS
[1:06:30] NAMES.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; CONTRARY TO THE SCRIPTURE.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; SECOND TIMOTHY 3 SAID THE HOLY SPIRIT
[1:06:36] SPEAKING IN THE LAST DAYS THEY WILL
[1:06:39] DEPART FROM THE FAITH and give heed to
[1:06:41] seducing spirits. IT ALSO SAID THE HOLY
[1:06:45] SPIRIT SPOKE THAT IN THE LAST DAYS
[1:06:47] THEY'D BE HEADY, HIGHMINDED, [screaming]
[1:06:50] HATEFUL,
[1:06:52] Bless God, you belong to us OR YOU DON'T
[1:06:54] HAVE YOUR NAME ON OUR BOOK, YOU'RE LOST,
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; HATEFUL, UNCLEAN,
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not hurting. I hope I'm doing
[1:07:04] good.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Hateful, unclean birds.
[1:07:10] SHE CAGED THEM.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER, GOD IS AN EAGLE.
[1:07:17] HE CALLED HIMSELF AN EAGLE.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; AND HE CALLED JACOB AN EAGLE.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; AND WE ARE HIS EAGLE.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; HE CALLED HIS PROPHETS EAGLES.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; THIS ANGEL COME DOWN TO EXPOSE
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; AND TO CALL OUT.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; LIKE MY LITTLE MESSAGE ON THE EAGLE
[1:07:39] STIRS your nest.
[1:07:41] That little old eagle had been following
[1:07:43] that OLD HEN AROUND IN THE BARNYARD all
[1:07:44] the time, clucking around, but he
[1:07:47] couldn't eat that stuff that she had.
[1:07:49] Socials and painted face women, bobbed
[1:07:51] hair and shorts. He couldn't do that.
[1:07:54] But he DIDN'T KNOW NOTHING ELSE BUT THE
[1:07:55] CLUCK OF THAT OLD H.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; But one DAY THE MOTHER EAGLE FOUND HIM.
[1:08:00] [clears throat]
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; She screamed,
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; CALLING HIM OUT,
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; SAID, "SON, YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THEM.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; COME OUT OF HER.
[1:08:11] SAID, "MAMA, WHAT CAN I DO?" SAID, "FROP
[1:08:13] YOUR WINGS AND STARTLE."
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; The first jump HE HIT ON A POST RIGHT IN
[1:08:23] THE MIDDLE OF A ORGANIZATION SAID, "SON,
[1:08:25] you'll have TO COME HIGHER IN THAT
[1:08:26] EARTH. CAN'T CATCH HIM."
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Got to get your feet off the ground.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; She's going to take him on a flight.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; He found out he could fly. She come to
[1:08:37] call him out.
[1:08:39] That's right. But this mother Bablin had
[1:08:42] called herself a bunch of chickens,
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; slick chicks,
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; painted up, bobbed hair, call themselves
[1:08:51] Christians.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; She got a cage full of them.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; You preachers that STAND IN THE PULL PIT
[1:08:58] AND LET THEM WOMEN GET BY THAT. SHAME ON
[1:09:00] YOU.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; To make your denominational more.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; GOD WILL REQUIRE THAT OF YOUR HAND.
[1:09:08] AMEN.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; COME OUT OF IT.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; My sheep hear my voice.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; A cage of hateful, heady, highmounted,
[1:09:21] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:09:23] God. Got to be like the world and to be
[1:09:26] like Christ.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; When you see a woman with a lot of
[1:09:29] makeup on, it goes to show she's empty
[1:09:31] inside.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; She's false inside. It's exactly right.
[1:09:36] If the woman I seen one the other day
[1:09:38] with a green hair,
[1:09:40] right?
[1:09:42] And all that green stuff under their
[1:09:43] eyes. Now, if you I if you didn't have
[1:09:48] any hair and and you wanted to wear some
[1:09:50] hair, it' be all right. But wear one
[1:09:52] that look like human
[1:09:54] and if you didn't have any fingernails
[1:09:56] and and you wanted to get some
[1:09:58] fingernails, don't get them like hollers
[1:10:01] off of Navy Beans. Get them get real
[1:10:03] fingernails.
[1:10:04] IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANY OF THESE THINGS,
[1:10:07] it's all right. IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANY
[1:10:09] TEETH, GET YOU SOME. If they make you
[1:10:10] some, get them. BUT DON'T PULL YOUR
[1:10:13] GOD-GIVEN TEETH OUT JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE
[1:10:15] A LITTLE crooked and they're good teeth
[1:10:17] to get some.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; DON'T DYE YOUR HAIR SOMETHING LOOK LIKE
[1:10:22] something you come out of a some mirror
[1:10:25] somewhere.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Don't if you're colorless and you want
[1:10:29] TO MAKE YOURSELF LOOK LIKE YOU GOT SOME
[1:10:31] COLOR, IT'S all right, I imagine. BUT
[1:10:33] DON'T MAKE YOURSELF LOOK LIKE JEZEBEL,
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; like a barn somewhere
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; being painted.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; And you Pentecostal brethren, letting
[1:10:47] them women cut their hair
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; when the Bible said that's her glory.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; And it's even uncommon for her to pray
[1:10:54] with her hair like that
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; and let let her come up in the pulpit
[1:10:57] and preach the gospel, sing in a choir,
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; teach a Sunday school. Shame on you.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Been ashamed of yourself.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Why am I against the organization? You
[1:11:12] think I could ever cater to something
[1:11:13] like that? I know the reason you do it,
[1:11:15] brother. You know better. But if you
[1:11:17] teach against that, you'll be turned
[1:11:18] into the headquarters and they'll
[1:11:19] excommunicate you. Bless God for your
[1:11:22] courage if you'll do it.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. God will honor you. What did
[1:11:27] THIS ANGEL SAY? COME OUT OF HER.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. This angel came to the earth
[1:11:33] and he'd come to bring the light and he
[1:11:35] shine the light around the world. He was
[1:11:37] a mighty angel and he come to proclaim
[1:11:39] THE MESSAGE OF COME OUT OF BABYLON.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Touch not our unclean things.
[1:11:45] Got a whole cage full of them. Said
[1:11:47] she's a cage of every hateful bird. Yes,
[1:11:49] she got a cage full of them now. The
[1:11:51] World Council of Churches or lodges, she
[1:11:54] got the whole bunch caged up now.
[1:11:56] They're all coming together.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; She become a cage. All right. full of
[1:11:59] hateful birds. That's right. Try to talk
[1:12:02] to one of them one time.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Just try it. Boy, smart in the world's
[1:12:06] wisdom, but know more about God than a
[1:12:08] rabbit does about snowshoes. That's
[1:12:10] That's right. Just that's just it. See,
[1:12:12] just all they know is some wisdom. They
[1:12:14] can put this and do that and there, but
[1:12:16] when it comes to knowing him,
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah. got caught in her cage with her
[1:12:25] dogmas. The Protestant churches begin
[1:12:27] the same and become her daughters. Cause
[1:12:30] this by denying
[1:12:32] the word of God that she does. She
[1:12:36] denies the word. And when you accept
[1:12:38] something else instead of the word, you
[1:12:40] deny it yourself. And when you join up
[1:12:43] in one of them, you've also denied the
[1:12:46] word.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; God don't want you that way. No place of
[1:12:50] it for the scripture. Notice this is the
[1:12:53] angel of light.
[1:12:56] Remember the last angel. It's the angel
[1:13:00] in the church age to the lady OA.
[1:13:03] It's the lady OA messenger
[1:13:07] that it's the last because the very next
[1:13:12] chapter is the 19th chapter which is a
[1:13:16] coming bride
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; and this is in THE SCRIPTURE. THE LAST
[1:13:21] ANGEL THAT CAME TO BRING LIGHT BEFORE
[1:13:24] THE COMING OF THE BRIDE, the god is a
[1:13:28] lady I see in church age.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; What was THE LADY OF SEEING CHURCH AGE
[1:13:32] MESSENGER CALLING HIM OUT OF ADAM?
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; LOOK churches caught in her cage with
[1:13:38] her with her dogmas denying the word and
[1:13:41] accepting dogmas. This is the angel of
[1:13:44] light to the lady of sin church THAT HAD
[1:13:47] REJECTED CHRIST AND HIS WORD for dogma
[1:13:51] and had put him outside and he stood at
[1:13:53] the door knocking trying to get in.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; The church age had rejected
[1:14:02] THE CHRIST AND CHRIST IS THE WORD and
[1:14:06] had REJECTED IT AND HE WAS ON THE
[1:14:08] OUTSIDE. THE ONLY CHURCH age that we
[1:14:11] have of Christ on the outside knocking
[1:14:13] trying to get in.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; AND THIS ANGEL'S MESSAGE messenger come
[1:14:18] from God WAS ECHOING HIS MESSAGE ON THE
[1:14:22] EARTH TO COME OUT OF Babylon come out of
[1:14:25] the organizations.
[1:14:27] The Holy Spirit today, the manifestation
[1:14:31] of THE HOLY SPIRIT IS THAT ANGEL TRYING
[1:14:35] TO GET THE PEOPLE BACK TO THE word
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; because the Holy Spirit will only
[1:14:40] vindicate the word. It can't vindicate
[1:14:42] dogmas.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; There's no life in him. He's lying.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Notice
[1:14:48] the lady of St. Church had denied him,
[1:14:50] rejected him, and he put him on the
[1:14:53] outside. Notice this angel is the last
[1:14:57] messenger before the coming of Christ in
[1:15:00] the 19th chapter of Revelations. The
[1:15:03] messengergers's voice, if we notice,
[1:15:05] when he gave his voice on the earth,
[1:15:08] there was a voice echoed again in
[1:15:10] heaven. Fourth verse, if you want to
[1:15:12] read it. All right. Fourth verse, the
[1:15:14] 19th chapter. This messenger on the
[1:15:17] earth WAS SO INCLINED WITH GOD UNTIL
[1:15:20] WHEN HE SPOKE IT ON THE EARTH. GOD
[1:15:24] ECHOED THE SAME THING OUT OF HEAVEN.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THAT FOURTH VERSE TRANSLATION?
[1:15:29] WHAT DOES IT MEAN? GOD'S VOICE SPEAKING
[1:15:33] TO HIS PREDESTINATED PEOPLE SAYING,
[1:15:36] "Come out of her." Just exactly what the
[1:15:39] voice was.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; He's got people all out in there, all
[1:15:43] out THROUGH BABYLON. COME OUT OF HER
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; that she be not partakers of her sins.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. OUT OF THAT DOGMA AND CREEDS
[1:15:52] TO THE WORD MADE SPIRIT AND LIFE.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Notice the 19th chapter is the
[1:16:00] next. After these things. Did you notice
[1:16:03] her in the 19th chapter?
[1:16:05] After these things. Watch what? After
[1:16:09] what? If the message had come out of
[1:16:11] her. After these things, WATCH
[1:16:17] IS THE SHOUT OF THE BRIDE SAINTS.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; WITH THE BRIDEGROOM GOING TO THE
[1:16:25] MARRIAGE OF THE LAMB.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; How close are we then, brethren?
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S THE LAST CALL? COME OUT OF
[1:16:32] BABYLON.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; NOW, my brethren, that's the reason I'm
[1:16:36] against it. It's unscriptural.
[1:16:40] It's unorthodox.
[1:16:42] It's been proven to be false.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; God is not in it. He never was. He never
[1:16:49] will be.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; I ain't saying there's not people in
[1:16:52] these organizations. That's what the
[1:16:53] church is made up of. But as long as you
[1:16:55] stay into that system,
[1:16:58] you're part of it.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; If I stay in the United States, I'm an
[1:17:03] American.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; As long as I'm a citizen or a member of
[1:17:07] this United States, I'm part of it. If I
[1:17:10] go to Germany and deny my membership
[1:17:12] here and my citizenship, I take out
[1:17:14] citizenship in Germany, I'm no more an
[1:17:15] American. I'm a German. And if I go to
[1:17:19] Japan or wherever Russia, I became a
[1:17:21] citizen there. AND WHEN YOU JOIN UP WITH
[1:17:24] A CITIZEN, a system, AND BECOME A
[1:17:28] CITIZEN OF THAT SYSTEM, YOU'RE SHOWING
[1:17:31] WHAT YOU ARE.
[1:17:35] AND IN THIS LAST DAYS, GOD IS CALLING
[1:17:39] THE PEOPLE OUT OF IT.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE said so.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Come out of her that you be not
[1:17:47] partakers with her
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; and I will receive you. Touch not her
[1:17:52] unclean things.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; I will receive you and you'll be sons
[1:17:57] and daughters to me and I'll be god to
[1:17:59] you. That's the reason I have spoke
[1:18:02] against the church. the the lodge. I
[1:18:04] can't call it a church. There's only one
[1:18:06] church. That's the church of the body of
[1:18:08] Christ.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; But these lodges, it's called church. My
[1:18:11] Bible tells me that they are blasphemous
[1:18:14] names.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; All of them. All organizations. What are
[1:18:18] they blaspheming? Blasphemia is to be
[1:18:20] contrary to or speak against. When God
[1:18:24] says
[1:18:26] come be born and they say come join.
[1:18:30] See,
[1:18:32] when the baptisms of the spirit is
[1:18:35] falsely tuck over for a wafer in the
[1:18:39] Catholic church, a handshake in the
[1:18:43] Protestant church, in an emotion in the
[1:18:46] Pentecostal church, instead of the
[1:18:48] person of Christ,
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; coming in with all that pyramid building
[1:18:53] we had the other day,
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; add to your faith virtue and so forth.
[1:18:57] all this in first Peter the first uh
[1:19:00] second Peter be the first chapter where
[1:19:02] it's all added to your faith all these
[1:19:04] things godliness and purity and holiness
[1:19:07] and everything and then you're sealed by
[1:19:09] the Holy Ghost
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; but it's just like somebody they people
[1:19:13] claim to have this when they haven't
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; because they've been falsely taught
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; the Methodists get a funny feeling used
[1:19:20] to it shake a little bit or or dance in
[1:19:23] the spirit the Pentecostals speak with
[1:19:25] tongues or or do something emotional. I
[1:19:28] believe those things CERTAINLY, BUT
[1:19:31] THOSE THINGS WITHOUT THESE OTHERS IS NO
[1:19:33] GOOD.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; As I said, it's like a peacock or a
[1:19:36] blackbird trying to put peacock feathers
[1:19:38] in himself.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Or a buzzard trying to use dove
[1:19:41] feathers. They never grow there. HE
[1:19:43] PUSHED THEM INSELF. They're planted.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE DENOMINATION.
[1:19:48] BUT WHEN GOD PUTS ANYTHING IN THERE,
[1:19:50] IT'S NATURAL.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; You make yourself say, "I joined church
[1:19:55] last night. I can't go no more. I can't
[1:19:57] drink no more. I can't do this. I join
[1:20:00] church. See, you're trying to put
[1:20:02] peacock feathers in your buzzard
[1:20:04] carcass. That's right. See,
[1:20:08] YOU'VE GOT TO BE BORN AGAIN.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO RECEIVE CHRIST. AND WHEN
[1:20:15] YOU RECEIVE CHRIST, YOU CAN'T RECEIVE
[1:20:18] CHRIST WITHOUT RECEIVING HIS WORD
[1:20:19] BECAUSE HE IS THE WORD.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:22] And when you have a form of godliness
[1:20:24] and deny that, then I wonder.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; See, and you can still belong to all the
[1:20:29] organization you want to and have a form
[1:20:30] of godliness and still don't have it.
[1:20:32] Now, there you are, friends. There's the
[1:20:34] whole thing. God bless you. God help
[1:20:37] you. I don't say this to be different.
[1:20:39] I'm explaining myself. This being
[1:20:41] Armisters's days, I'm not signing a
[1:20:43] treaty of peace with you ministers. Not
[1:20:45] at all.
[1:20:47] I think you ought to come sign with me.
[1:20:49] Not with me, but with God. The word.
[1:20:52] That's right. That's right. Say what the
[1:20:54] Bible says. Say it the way it says it.
[1:20:56] Because the Bible said, "Who shall take
[1:20:58] away or add to the same?" And you see,
[1:21:00] organization is unscriptural. And when
[1:21:03] you receive the first dogma, you just
[1:21:06] might as well go all the way back cause
[1:21:08] that you cross the line right there.
[1:21:11] When you come back to the new birth,
[1:21:13] then you walk into the scripture and you
[1:21:15] go into a denomination. They say, "I
[1:21:17] know we don't believe in this. Our
[1:21:19] bishops and our church teaches. We are
[1:21:21] one of the oldest churches. We don't
[1:21:23] teach. I don't care what they don't
[1:21:25] teach. If the Bible teaches it, the Holy
[1:21:27] Spirit in you, it'll feed on the word.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; No matter how smart a man is and how he
[1:21:33] can try to explain it away, they can
[1:21:35] explain away. A infidel can take the
[1:21:37] Bible and explain God away from you.
[1:21:40] Therefore, no man has any right to
[1:21:44] preach the gospel unless he's been like
[1:21:46] Moses back down on that sacred sands
[1:21:49] where him and God alone stood
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; until a man's born again and stands
[1:21:54] there face to face with God and knows
[1:21:57] there's no infidel, there's no
[1:21:59] psychology, there's no explaining,
[1:22:02] there's no scholar in the world can take
[1:22:04] that away from you.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; You were there when it happened.
[1:22:08] Yes sir. You know what taking place.
[1:22:10] Then you say, "I had that kind of
[1:22:12] experience and I got a spirit on me."
[1:22:15] And if it denies the word in any way,
[1:22:18] you got the wrong spirit.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; You say, "I can't go for this stuff like
[1:22:23] this." I know, but aren't uh there's a
[1:22:26] wrong spirit. There's your mark of
[1:22:28] identification.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Cain, you're mark.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Eve just doubted one little
[1:22:36] word. Not all God said, just one little
[1:22:39] word and it caused every heartache and
[1:22:42] heartbreak and death and sin at battles
[1:22:45] and everything else. Every grave, every
[1:22:47] ambulance, ever screamed, every hospital
[1:22:49] was built for the sick. Her one little
[1:22:52] doubting, one little word of God caused
[1:22:56] all of this and she was put out when
[1:22:59] this never would have had to happen. How
[1:23:01] are you going to get in doubting one
[1:23:03] word of it? Amen.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Say, I know it says that, but it it
[1:23:08] means just that.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Now, look, God's got to judge the world
[1:23:13] by something.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; You cannot have judgment unless you have
[1:23:18] a uh first a law.
[1:23:21] There's got to be something. You've got
[1:23:22] to break something in order to be
[1:23:24] judged. See? And then there cannot be
[1:23:27] judgment correctly without penalty. Now,
[1:23:30] see, you can't have a law in town that
[1:23:32] says $5 fine for run the red light and
[1:23:35] the next law say no he can go free. See,
[1:23:37] you can't do that. So, there can't be
[1:23:39] two laws in existence at one time. And
[1:23:41] there's one law, one God, one book, one
[1:23:47] Christ. It's all one faith, one hope.
[1:23:52] That's all. That's the Bible. Christ.
[1:23:55] Notice now in this if there is to be
[1:24:00] something added to this it's got to be
[1:24:03] added by name. It can't be no more than
[1:24:07] and if God is going to judge the world
[1:24:09] by a church as a Catholic says
[1:24:12] then what Catholic church is he going to
[1:24:14] judge it by? There's several of them.
[1:24:17] There's one Roman, one Greek and all
[1:24:18] these all different kinds. Which
[1:24:20] Catholic church you going to judge it
[1:24:22] by? Or maybe he's going to judge it by
[1:24:24] the Lutheran.
[1:24:25] Well, then maybe he's going to judge it
[1:24:27] by the Presbyterian. See,
[1:24:30] what's he going to do? He's going to
[1:24:31] judge it by a church. He's going to
[1:24:33] judge it by his word.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Well, then he never See, he can't keep a
[1:24:39] group of people as the sister's vision
[1:24:41] the other night. The Holy Spirit poured
[1:24:42] in. It went right through that box.
[1:24:44] Sure, nothing holds that. It's an
[1:24:46] individual. It's g to cleanse the
[1:24:49] church, but it can't hold it. No
[1:24:51] organization can hold it. That's all. It
[1:24:54] just can't do it. You got everything in
[1:24:55] there in there. You can't do it. The
[1:24:58] organization can't do it. But it's an
[1:25:00] individual that has the Holy Spirit. Now
[1:25:05] notice then if God is going to judge the
[1:25:09] world by his word, then he certainly has
[1:25:12] watched over it and kept it in
[1:25:14] condition.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. or if it's all scrupled up, how is
[1:25:17] he going to brain judge him?
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; It's got to be something. And he never
[1:25:23] said, "Whosoever by the church." He
[1:25:26] said, "Whosoever shall take one word
[1:25:28] away from this
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; or add one word to it." The same will be
[1:25:33] taken his part out of the book of life.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; So to me, it's God, his word, and the
[1:25:40] judgment.
[1:25:42] Now, if I judge and accept the word and
[1:25:45] see that Christ died for me, then I ask
[1:25:47] for his life to come in and guide me.
[1:25:49] And if his life is the word and he wrote
[1:25:52] the word, how can his life be in me and
[1:25:54] me claiming I have the Holy Spirit and
[1:25:56] adding a dogma instead of the word?
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; It just wouldn't work.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; How can I add a denomination when he's
[1:26:04] against it and PROVED IT AND SHOWED IT
[1:26:06] THROUGH HISTORY that every time they
[1:26:08] denominate, they die spiritually? Amen.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, they grow members. Sure.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; That's right. They grow members, but
[1:26:15] spiritually they never go nowhere.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Show me. Tell me in the history.
[1:26:20] Wherever a church that after it
[1:26:22] organized, it died right there. The Holy
[1:26:25] Spirit left that there's no more
[1:26:26] miracles and signs and she just went
[1:26:28] right on in chaos. That's exactly what
[1:26:30] happened to our Pentecostal churches.
[1:26:33] They did exactly what their mother did
[1:26:36] at the beginning. They've come out of
[1:26:38] people that rejected denominations. Now,
[1:26:40] some of you brethren listen to this
[1:26:41] tape, some of you old man know that
[1:26:43] years ago, 40, 50 years ago, if they
[1:26:45] talked to you about an organization, you
[1:26:47] would have said it was blasphemy. But
[1:26:49] today, you belong to the thing that you
[1:26:52] thought was blasphemy.
[1:26:55] You women that bob your hair and paint
[1:26:57] your face, your mother was against that.
[1:27:00] That go to good old Pentecostal saint.
[1:27:02] What happened to you?
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Paul said you did run well. What
[1:27:05] hindered you?
[1:27:10] back there. You was free from that
[1:27:12] stuff, but you wanted to be like the
[1:27:14] rest of them. Exactly what Samuel said.
[1:27:17] Israel had a king, and that was God. And
[1:27:19] they said, "Samuel, you're getting old.
[1:27:21] Make us a king. We want to be like the
[1:27:23] rest of the world. We want to be like
[1:27:25] the other nations. We want a king to
[1:27:26] take us to war. We want a king that can
[1:27:30] fight our battles." And it displeased
[1:27:32] Samuel. He said, "Have I ever took
[1:27:35] anything from you? Have I ever took your
[1:27:39] money from you?
[1:27:41] Have I ever asked you for an ox or
[1:27:44] anything? Have I ever asked you for
[1:27:46] anything?" They said, "No, you never
[1:27:48] asked us for nothing." Or says, "Have I
[1:27:50] ever spoke anything to you in the name
[1:27:53] of the Lord of what come to pass?"
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:27:59] He said, "Then don't receive that king,
[1:28:02] because it's going to mean chaos to
[1:28:05] you." Now, I want to ask you something,
[1:28:07] the brand tabernacle. You're fixing to
[1:28:10] grow into a big tabernacle. Now,
[1:28:13] I may be away for a while. I may go
[1:28:16] somewhere. Hard tell where the Lord will
[1:28:18] call me. Maybe off the scene, maybe back
[1:28:21] into the field. Maybe he might call me
[1:28:23] into the wilderness. I don't know where
[1:28:25] he'll call me till Jesus comes. I want
[1:28:28] to ask you something.
[1:28:30] Did I ever ask you for anything?
[1:28:33] Did I ever beg you for money?
[1:28:38] Did I ever tell you anything of the
[1:28:41] thousands of things that I have told you
[1:28:43] in the name of the Lord? But didn't it
[1:28:45] come to pass?
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Then don't never join an organization.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; It's against the word of God. Come out
[1:28:54] of it if you're in it. and be ye
[1:28:57] suffering and receive the word of the
[1:28:59] Lord.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.
[1:29:07] Great God of the prophets,
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; the God of Abraham, Isaac, and of
[1:29:12] Israel,
[1:29:16] add virtue, Lord,
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; to this little chopped up message that's
[1:29:22] been on my heart for a long time
[1:29:25] to go to my brethren.
[1:29:28] Many of those out there, Lord, has the
[1:29:31] wrong impression of me. They think that
[1:29:34] I want to be different. They think that
[1:29:36] I'm trying to be a know-it-all. They've
[1:29:39] told the people that I deceive the
[1:29:43] people,
[1:29:45] especially on such subjects as the water
[1:29:48] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; And upon the serpent's seed,
[1:29:56] the great harlot. And in many of those
[1:29:59] tapes, it's one out with nothing but
[1:30:01] unadulterated truth.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I've asked them, some of you
[1:30:06] come and show me where I sin are
[1:30:08] disbelieving or misinterpreting the word
[1:30:13] and none has showed up.
[1:30:17] I pray thee, Father, let these men know
[1:30:20] that they're missing the hour.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; They are going to wait too late if they
[1:30:30] don't watch.
[1:30:32] May they everyone Lord I am sure of
[1:30:35] this.
[1:30:36] My heart would break if this scripture
[1:30:40] wasn't real to me when you said all that
[1:30:44] the father has given me will come.
[1:30:49] My sheep hear my voice.
[1:30:52] Then Lord I guess the kingdom is truly
[1:30:55] as you said. I know it is. It is like
[1:30:58] unto a man that took a net and went to
[1:31:00] the lake, cast in the net, and pulled
[1:31:03] every kind.
[1:31:05] There was no doubt scavenger fish. There
[1:31:09] were turtles, water spiders, serpents,
[1:31:13] everything that the gospel net caught.
[1:31:16] But finally, by and by, the crawfish
[1:31:20] backed into the water again. The turtle
[1:31:23] pulled away. The serpent hissed and
[1:31:26] tucked back to the mud hole like a dog
[1:31:28] to its vomit
[1:31:31] or a hog to its wall.
[1:31:34] But there was real fish there, Lord. And
[1:31:37] I have this consolation of knowing that
[1:31:39] even before the net went over them, they
[1:31:42] were fish.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; They were born predestinated fish.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; And so is the gospel net that catches
[1:31:51] out into the revivals. You know your
[1:31:53] own. The only thing I'm responsible for,
[1:31:56] Father, as far as I know, is stay true
[1:31:58] to this word. You are the one who to
[1:32:01] decide which is which. And I know that
[1:32:05] no more than the turtle could become a
[1:32:08] trout.
[1:32:10] So could a man or a person that has deaf
[1:32:14] ears to the gospel ever understand the
[1:32:17] truth. For the Father has foresaw this
[1:32:21] and you have promised that all that he
[1:32:23] give you would come. Heavenly Father, I
[1:32:27] pray thee that every person that hears
[1:32:30] this little message that the light that
[1:32:34] it's been preached in and the meaning
[1:32:36] that I have in my heart towards my
[1:32:38] fellow man,
[1:32:40] people who you died for and man, some of
[1:32:44] them out there, Lord like in Cororus
[1:32:46] bunch,
[1:32:48] genuine man, falsely led with a holy
[1:32:52] sensor in their hand, but perished.
[1:32:56] While they wouldn't even let the sensor
[1:32:59] fire go in with them, Aaron's son,
[1:33:02] Elohar, had to gather it up and they
[1:33:04] made a banner for the altar out of those
[1:33:06] kdles,
[1:33:08] a shield to show
[1:33:11] and to be a memorial of that awful thing
[1:33:14] that Kora tried to form an organized
[1:33:17] party against the messenger of God.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:22] far be it from us, Lord. May the Holy
[1:33:26] Spirit always protect us. We thank thee,
[1:33:29] Lord, that our little church, this
[1:33:32] little sacred shrine, many years ago, 30
[1:33:36] some odd years, I knelt in the pond here
[1:33:39] full of weeds and moisture,
[1:33:42] and we dedicated this ground to you.
[1:33:45] This little structure and yonder in that
[1:33:47] tabernacle corner lays that vision
[1:33:49] that's come to pass. Exactly.
[1:33:52] Still there. They're not going to tear
[1:33:54] it down, Lord. They're just going to
[1:33:57] It's getting old and they're just going
[1:33:59] to preserve it by putting one over the
[1:34:01] top of it.
[1:34:03] God grant that this golden gospel that's
[1:34:07] recorded in the pages here, may it never
[1:34:09] leave this little church until Christ
[1:34:11] comes. May every member, every member of
[1:34:16] the body of Christ, they come in here
[1:34:18] from across the nation and around the
[1:34:20] world, may every one of them receive the
[1:34:23] light, the gospel, and walk in it, then
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; and receive Christ. And may it be so
[1:34:30] real that his words will come to pass,
[1:34:33] the works that I do shall they do also.
[1:34:37] He that heareth my words and believeth
[1:34:40] on him that sent me has eternal life.
[1:34:44] And when eternal life comes in, they're
[1:34:47] born from above and the works from God
[1:34:51] manifest himself because it's the same
[1:34:53] life that was in him. It cannot do
[1:34:57] anything else. So, Father, let this
[1:34:59] church never rest their eternal
[1:35:02] destination upon a sensation,
[1:35:05] upon an organization,
[1:35:08] upon anything less than Christ himself
[1:35:11] living in them, vindicating his word
[1:35:14] through them and his promise. May from
[1:35:17] the least little child here tonight
[1:35:20] until the oldest person receive this
[1:35:22] experience. And may every man or woman,
[1:35:25] boy or girl, who hears this tape, may it
[1:35:27] be so with them, Lord, and give them the
[1:35:30] understanding that I'm only trying to
[1:35:33] warn and call out,
[1:35:36] for this hour is later than we think.
[1:35:38] And we see Babylon, the mother
[1:35:42] and all of her prostitute daughters
[1:35:44] assembling themselves together.
[1:35:48] God, we realize that the scripture says
[1:35:51] that the terriers out of the wheat field
[1:35:54] will be bound first in bundles and they
[1:35:58] have bound in bundles calling themselves
[1:36:00] blasphemous names.
[1:36:03] That really doesn't pertain to them.
[1:36:06] It's not pertaining to the church
[1:36:08] either. It's lodges, not churches.
[1:36:12] There's only one of them, Father, and
[1:36:14] that's the one you died for. And I pray,
[1:36:16] Father, as we see them all being bundled
[1:36:19] now for an atomic fire soon, I pray,
[1:36:23] Lord, that you'll let the wheat be full
[1:36:25] and heavy. Grant it, Lord. May we grow
[1:36:29] and shine light and be like Jesus. If I
[1:36:33] do not the things that God required me
[1:36:36] to do, then I have no life in me. But if
[1:36:39] God speaks and shows his life, then that
[1:36:43] speaks for itself. Grant it, Lord. I
[1:36:46] commit this message to you and that you
[1:36:49] watch over it and bring tens of
[1:36:52] thousands Lord or all your predestinated
[1:36:56] children to the gospel and Jesus Christ
[1:36:59] who is the word. In his name I pray.
[1:37:03] Amen.
[1:37:12] I
[1:37:15] love
[1:37:24] me
[1:37:27] and
[1:37:30] just my salvation
[1:37:37] on
[1:37:39] Calary
[1:37:42] Street.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; I'm
[1:37:47] Amen. God bless you. The musicians come.
[1:37:50] How many enjoy the word of the Lord? How
[1:37:53] many needed to hear that?
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, who was this angel in
[1:37:57] Revelations chapter 18? This mighty
[1:38:00] angel who lighted up the whole earth.
[1:38:04] Who was it? The prophet just told us who
[1:38:06] it was. And I'm so glad that I heard
[1:38:09] that message again tonight.
[1:38:12] It really, you know, that movement
[1:38:14] that's trying to get us to move and look
[1:38:17] like the denomination and kind of cater
[1:38:20] to what they're doing. A message like
[1:38:22] this really tells you to get back in
[1:38:24] line with the word because that voice
[1:38:27] called us to come out of her. Is that
[1:38:30] right?
[1:38:32] How many of you here [sighs]
[1:38:35] um
[1:38:36] were not born or raised in the message
[1:38:39] and you heard the message and you came
[1:38:41] out? There's a number. There's a good
[1:38:43] portion of the saints here that were
[1:38:46] born in the message. How many of you
[1:38:48] saints were born in the message like my
[1:38:50] wife and many of you? Bless you. And so
[1:38:56] I can't really I can't really identify
[1:38:58] with like my children their experience
[1:39:02] and for their whole life they've heard
[1:39:04] the message. They've seen that pillar of
[1:39:06] fire that picture and the signs and
[1:39:08] wonders and I try to identify with it
[1:39:10] and try to understand it. Um, but being
[1:39:15] born and raised in a Pentecostal church
[1:39:17] and going in the world, when I first
[1:39:20] heard this message, it was the greatest
[1:39:24] thing I ever heard in my life.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; I mean, it shook me to my core. There is
[1:39:30] nothing else like it.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; It was a dynamic explosion in my life.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; And so, that's the way I handled it.
[1:39:37] That's the way I preach it. That's the
[1:39:39] way I promote it. And I was talking to
[1:39:42] some of the other a couple other pastors
[1:39:44] or friends of mine. They're believers
[1:39:46] that were raised in the message and
[1:39:48] they, you know, we've had this
[1:39:49] discussion before. I might lean a little
[1:39:52] hard. I'm always quoting and talking
[1:39:54] about the prophet. And I told one
[1:39:57] brother, I says, "Brother, I came out of
[1:39:59] something." And so this is so it's just
[1:40:05] I first heard the message, I thought
[1:40:07] everybody was the same. I did. I didn't
[1:40:10] know there were several churches. I just
[1:40:12] thought, man, this is heaven. I was
[1:40:14] waiting for this my whole life. [gasps]
[1:40:17] Oh my goodness, what a surprise.
[1:40:21] But um I know it's still it's a powerful
[1:40:24] word and each person has to have their
[1:40:27] own revelation. And I thank God that
[1:40:30] he's able to get a hold of you no matter
[1:40:33] where you were born. Amen.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; So I think I remember you now, sis.
[1:40:37] You're from Tennessee. Is that right?
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Union City.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Union City. That's right. You play the
[1:40:43] piano or organ or something?
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; God bless you. What's your name?
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Rebecca.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Rebecca. Your dad's a minister. No.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Yes. All right. Wonderful. I just
[1:40:54] remember your face and I was sitting
[1:40:55] there and then it clicked. Yeah, that's
[1:40:56] where she's from. So, God bless you.
[1:40:58] Welcome you and my brother. God bless
[1:41:01] you all. And so, um, thank the Lord for
[1:41:05] his word tonight. We will stand and
[1:41:08] we'll sing a few praises. Um we'll ask
[1:41:11] brother John to come. Service on
[1:41:13] Wednesday night. We'll start that at 9
[1:41:16] p.m. And if you have testimony or songs
[1:41:20] that would be nice for you to bring
[1:41:21] those at the for the end of the year
[1:41:24] service and we'll put those together. I
[1:41:26] know I ask saints to sing and nobody
[1:41:28] sings. My wife, she she gets after you.
[1:41:33] She got the whole Christmas program. she
[1:41:36] got people to sing and and um so the
[1:41:39] pastor's wife sometimes they have a
[1:41:41] stronger influence than the pastor I
[1:41:44] think so I maybe I'm just not asking you
[1:41:47] right maybe I should text you and ask
[1:41:49] you but I really love to hear you all
[1:41:51] sing it just blesses me I love to hear
[1:41:54] your testimony I love to hear you sing
[1:41:56] get your little group together you know
[1:41:58] and put it together sing a song for the
[1:42:00] Lord so we'll start that at nine Lord
[1:42:02] willing we have a few testimonies that
[1:42:04] we'll lay out and so God richly bless
[1:42:07] you. Amen. So, Brother John, why don't
[1:42:10] you come and I wanted to uh Brother Kim
[1:42:12] to come and greet you all. We're so
[1:42:14] happy to have him back with us. And so,
[1:42:16] maybe he'll we'll have him come and
[1:42:18] greet you. Come on, brother Kim Dingall
[1:42:20] sitting back there. Call him by name.
[1:42:25] He gets a place squeezed in by the wall
[1:42:28] so he's not an easy access. But we'll
[1:42:30] wait for you to come on through. We love
[1:42:33] Brother Kim. Hammy love our brother.
[1:42:35] Amen. God bless you. [applause]
[1:42:38] Welcome.
[1:42:39] Just greet the saints for us. All right.
[1:42:41] God bless you.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Well, I thought I'd made it through the
[1:42:43] whole day without it.
[1:42:45] And I was looking around to see is there
[1:42:47] another brother Kim? He's calling.
[1:42:50] Well, it's certainly wonderful to be
[1:42:51] here. Um my daughter would tell you that
[1:42:54] when that first note hit the cello this
[1:42:57] morning, it just really struck my heart,
[1:42:58] you know. Um I really feel at home here.
[1:43:02] And I said this, I was on on our way
[1:43:04] down. We stopped at a church in
[1:43:05] Bakersfield and I said this there. I
[1:43:07] said, 'You know, I've traveled to a lot
[1:43:09] of places around the world, 65 countries
[1:43:12] or so. And I find when I'm in Gabon, you
[1:43:16] know, the dogs all sound the same when
[1:43:18] they bark.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; And when you hear children playing in a
[1:43:21] playground, no matter what language they
[1:43:23] s they speak, they all sound the same.
[1:43:25] You just hear the chatter of children.
[1:43:27] And when you get around the Holy Ghost,
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; it sounds the same. whether it's in
[1:43:31] Gabon or here or home or wherever. And
[1:43:35] you know, Sister Peterson sang it wrote
[1:43:38] a song, I always feel at home in the
[1:43:40] presence of the Lord.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; That's that's where we that's where we
[1:43:43] feel at home. We really feel at home
[1:43:45] here. We feel welcome here. Um you know,
[1:43:47] Brother Bram talked about that welcome
[1:43:50] Holy Spirit. That welcome spirit that
[1:43:52] you know, if people would come up in the
[1:43:54] prayer line and he would say he would
[1:43:56] recognize that welcome Holy Spirit, you
[1:43:58] know that they had the Holy Spirit in
[1:44:00] them. And so we're we're thankful to be
[1:44:02] here. Um I don't I'm not sure how long
[1:44:04] we're here. We're going to be here until
[1:44:07] um you know, we have a little bit of
[1:44:09] work to do, but beyond that, uh we were
[1:44:12] almost to the place I'm not sure if we
[1:44:13] were going to make it this year. I had,
[1:44:15] you know, like I said, just before we
[1:44:16] came, we're in Gabon and then we
[1:44:18] traveled to Manitoba and then to here
[1:44:19] and and I looked at the calendar and I
[1:44:22] thought, "Oh man, you know, January, so
[1:44:23] I'm going to pick up again." And so I
[1:44:26] said to my wife, we were home, just came
[1:44:28] home from Manitoba. I said, "If we don't
[1:44:30] get in the motor home and go now, we're
[1:44:32] not going to get there." So, we we just
[1:44:34] threw some things in and came. So, we're
[1:44:36] we we really appreciate being here. We
[1:44:39] feel very welcome here. Uh we really
[1:44:42] enjoy the Holy Spirit here. The level
[1:44:46] that the word is preached at here. You
[1:44:48] know, we stream a lot of your services
[1:44:50] from home. We don't get them all, but we
[1:44:52] we we [snorts] get most of them. Um, we
[1:44:54] usually do our Sunday morning service
[1:44:56] and then Sunday afternoon is streaming
[1:44:58] the morning service from here. That's
[1:44:59] kind of what our that that's kind of
[1:45:01] what our routine is. And you know,
[1:45:04] there's so much going on around the
[1:45:06] world everywhere. And we see the
[1:45:08] churches leaning this way and this way.
[1:45:10] And I told brother Po yesterday, you
[1:45:12] know, when you when you ju when you're
[1:45:14] just hearing the message preached, then
[1:45:17] you can relax. And that's what I find in
[1:45:19] brother Po's preaching. His thoughts
[1:45:22] come from the message.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we hear where the thoughts
[1:45:26] come from Google and then we get a few
[1:45:27] message quotes to support it. But the
[1:45:29] but the inspiration comes from the
[1:45:31] message.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; And you know I was talking to a young
[1:45:34] brother. Is it okay? Am I I'm okay.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; I was talking to a young brother a
[1:45:39] little while ago and I said to him, you
[1:45:41] know,
[1:45:43] you know that the story of Ezer in the
[1:45:46] Bible. Do we we all know the story,
[1:45:47] right?
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Alza was sent to find a bride for
[1:45:50] Rebecca. And you know, at one point she
[1:45:53] said, "I will come." And she made her
[1:45:55] stand. She made her stand with her
[1:45:57] family who said, "No, no, you shouldn't
[1:45:58] go." And she made her stand. That's kind
[1:46:00] of like getting saved.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; But you know, it was a long journey on
[1:46:04] that camel
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; all the way back to Isaac. And two
[1:46:07] things happened on that journey. You
[1:46:10] know, he was teller was telling her all
[1:46:12] about Isaac, what a wonderful man he
[1:46:15] was. and his character and all about so
[1:46:18] that by the time she got there she was
[1:46:20] absolutely in love with him.
[1:46:23] And then the other thing he did was on
[1:46:25] that whole trip he said now you know he
[1:46:28] doesn't like things done like this. He
[1:46:29] likes things like this. And she knew how
[1:46:32] to go in and how to come out, how to
[1:46:34] come into his presence and how to not
[1:46:37] upset him. It's like my wife, you know,
[1:46:39] she knows how to make my toast. You
[1:46:41] know, I like it put in the toaster and
[1:46:43] then I like it half cooked and then turn
[1:46:45] the other half so it's all even and then
[1:46:48] the butter's got to be right out to the
[1:46:49] edges.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; And there's nobody can do toast for me
[1:46:53] like my wife cuz she knows exactly how I
[1:46:56] like it. And Rebecca knew exactly how to
[1:46:59] present herself to Isaac,
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; how to how to stand, how to show respect
[1:47:05] for him, how to dress. You know, don't
[1:47:08] don't show up to Isaac with your face
[1:47:09] all painted up. He's not going to like
[1:47:11] that, right? I remember Brother
[1:47:14] Hildebrandt's wife was in the hospital
[1:47:15] once she'd been really sick and uh she'd
[1:47:18] had a heart problem. And uh and the the
[1:47:22] nurses said to her, "You know, you're
[1:47:23] you're really pale. You know, you should
[1:47:25] probably put a little makeup on your
[1:47:26] face to look good for your husband." And
[1:47:28] she said, "No, I don't think my
[1:47:30] husband's going to like that none."
[1:47:31] [laughter]
[1:47:32] And she didn't. And so on this long
[1:47:35] journey that we're on, how in the world
[1:47:37] do we know how to get into the rapture
[1:47:39] without Elozer?
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; How do we know how to come in and out of
[1:47:43] his presence? How do we even know that
[1:47:45] we're not supposed to be sitting in
[1:47:47] church talking to one another and
[1:47:49] cutting up and chewing gum and doing all
[1:47:52] this in church? Because Ezer told us,
[1:47:55] now if you know if you don't if you do
[1:47:56] that, the Holy Spirit just might not
[1:47:58] show up.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; See, how would we know that without
[1:48:01] Eleazar? Amen.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; And that's why we need Alzer. That's
[1:48:05] what we heard today. How would we know
[1:48:08] this?
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Right. And so when we come to a place
[1:48:12] where we're hearing the word preached
[1:48:14] from that place, you know, I I just say
[1:48:16] like this, you know, you can just you
[1:48:17] can just sit back and relax and actually
[1:48:20] feed. You know, you can't really feed
[1:48:22] when you're not relaxed. You know, you
[1:48:24] know, if you're in a home, you know, I
[1:48:26] have a bit of a nervous stomach. So, if
[1:48:27] you're in a home and things are upset,
[1:48:29] my wife knows, you know, I need to have
[1:48:30] a calm atmosphere when I eat my supper.
[1:48:33] If it's all up and down and all over the
[1:48:35] place, I can't eat. I get I get an upset
[1:48:39] stomach. And so, when you're just coming
[1:48:41] from the word and and the and and the
[1:48:44] thought is coming from the message and
[1:48:46] the message is coming forward,
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; we can just relax and feed
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; and get fat
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; on the word of God.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's it's nice to be with you.
[1:48:56] Um, I'll turn it back to you. Somebody's
[1:48:58] gonna sing a song. Somebody's gonna do
[1:48:59] something. God bless you, brother. Amen.
[1:49:02] [applause]

[1:49:50] been good to me.

[1:49:56] do.

[1:50:04] Then healed my body when [singing] I was

[1:50:11] You healed my body when I was sick.
[1:50:14] Surely been good to me. [music] Oh, you
[1:50:16] [singing] have done what this world
[1:50:19] could not do. You filled me with You
[1:50:23] filled me with the Holy [music] Ghost.
[1:50:26] You surely have been good to me. You
[1:50:29] filled me with the [singing] Holy Ghost.
[1:50:32] You surely been good to [music] me. You

[1:50:39] been good to me. You have done what this
[1:50:43] world could [singing and music] not do.

[1:50:52] good [music and singing] to me.
[1:50:54] Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been
[1:50:58] [singing] good to me. Oh, Lord Lord,
[1:51:02] [music]
[1:51:03] you surely been good to me. You have
[1:51:07] done what this world could not do.
[1:51:13] Amen. Amen.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; And brother Kim, when you were talking
[1:51:16] about I was thinking about Esther as
[1:51:18] well. Brother Ben had mentioned
[1:51:20] something from the book of Esther and
[1:51:22] [music] in his prayer, but you know,
[1:51:24] they had the dresser of women that would
[1:51:26] come and instruct all of the the
[1:51:29] hopefuls to be the next queen. They
[1:51:31] said, "This is what the king wants, and
[1:51:33] this [music] is what the king wants."
[1:51:34] And some of them took things in
[1:51:37] addition. They were given that liberty
[1:51:38] to take things additional when they went
[1:51:41] to go meet the king. But it says Esther
[1:51:42] only [music] took that what the dresser
[1:51:46] had told her this is what the king
[1:51:48] likes. And so just that that came to my
[1:51:51] my mind as he [music] was saying that.
[1:51:53] And maybe we could just sing that chorus
[1:51:54] together. Pleasing Lord let me be
[1:51:57] pleasing unto you.
[1:52:00] Pleasing.
[1:52:05] Let [singing and music] me be pleasing
[1:52:09] to you.
[1:52:12] Let everything [singing and music]
[1:52:15] that I do
[1:52:19] be pleasing
[1:52:23] to you
[1:52:26] [music]
[1:52:27] and praying
[1:52:32] that [music and singing] everything
[1:52:36] I pursue
[1:52:40] would be pleased. Is [music] it
[1:52:43] [singing]
[1:52:44] oh Lord
[1:52:46] unto you. Let's ask him again. Lord,
[1:52:53] let [music] me be pleasing.
[1:53:00] Let [singing and music] me be pleasing
[1:53:05] to you.
[1:53:07] Let [singing and music] everything
[1:53:10] that I pursue,
[1:53:14] Lord, [music and singing] let it be
[1:53:16] pleasing
[1:53:18] to you.
[1:53:24] [singing]
[1:53:28] Let [music] everything
[1:53:31] I [singing] pursue,
[1:53:35] let it be [music] pleasing,
[1:53:40] oh Lord,
[1:53:42] unto [singing and music]
[1:53:43] you.
[1:53:50] Amen. Brother Caleb, would you come
[1:53:51] dismiss us tonight with a word of
[1:53:52] prayer?
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Let me
[1:54:04] in
[1:54:07] that [music]
[1:54:08] I do
[1:54:11] Lord be [singing] pleasing
[1:54:14] [music]
[1:54:15] to you.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; [singing and music]
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Everything
[1:54:28] I [singing]
[1:54:29] pursue
[1:54:32] would be pleasing,
[1:54:36] oh Lord,
[1:54:39] unto
[1:54:40] you.
[1:54:44] Amen.
[1:54:55] Dear Lord, we just [snorts] thank you
[1:54:59] for the messenger you sent for this
[1:55:01] hour, William Miranda. Lord,
[1:55:05] thank you for fulfilling your word,
[1:55:09] Lord, in the Bible that you would send a
[1:55:12] prophet for this age, Lord.
[1:55:15] Lord Jesus, thank you for keeping your
[1:55:18] word, pulling a people out of this
[1:55:21] world, the denominations,
[1:55:24] the institutions of man, Lord, that put
[1:55:28] your children in cages, Lord.
[1:55:31] Thank you, Lord, for opening those
[1:55:33] cages, Lord.
[1:55:36] Lord, just
[1:55:39] I know like your prophet said, the
[1:55:42] deepest calls to the deep, Lord. And
[1:55:45] when you unlock those cages, some of
[1:55:47] those stay in there not knowing they're
[1:55:49] free, Lord. But
[1:55:52] your call pulls them from that place,
[1:55:55] Lord.
[1:55:58] Lord, may none of your children be lost,
[1:56:02] Lord.
[1:56:03] May there be hands, Lord, work hands,
[1:56:07] Lord, that still will go out in the
[1:56:09] field, Lord, and still carry your will,
[1:56:13] Lord. And Lord, may you always still
[1:56:16] pull. And those that you pull, may they
[1:56:20] come to your work hands, Lord, that they
[1:56:24] may see what you want them to see, Lord.
[1:56:29] Lord Jesus, we just thank you so much
[1:56:32] for your love, Lord,
[1:56:35] thank you for your [music] tapes, Lord.
[1:56:39] Lord Jesus, we just appreciate you,
[1:56:43] Lord, and appreciate those here tonight,
[1:56:45] Lord.
[1:56:48] Lord, we [music] just love you, Lord. We
[1:56:50] just ask these things, Lord. Just go
[1:56:52] with your people tonight, Lord. Your
[1:56:55] hands over their lives, Lord.
[1:56:58] just ask these things in the name of
[1:56:59] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:57:02] Amen.
[1:57:04] Amen.
[1:57:08] Amen. You're dismissed. Maybe we could
[1:57:10] sing that song I [music] mentioned
[1:57:11] earlier. They come from the east and
[1:57:13] west since Jesus has set me free.
[1:57:16] They come from the [music] east and
[1:57:19] [singing] west for they come from the
[1:57:22] lands of far [singing]
[1:57:26] to feast [music] with the king to dine
[1:57:29] as his guest. How [music and singing]
[1:57:31] blessed these pilgrims are.
[1:57:35] Beholding [music] his hallowed [singing]
[1:57:38] face, a glow with light divine, a glow
[1:57:41] with lighting.
[1:57:45] Bless partaker
[1:57:47] of [singing]
[1:57:48] his grace [music] as Jim in his crown to
[1:57:51] shine.
[1:57:53] Since [music] Jesus has set me free.
[1:57:58] Oh, I'm [music and singing] happy as
[1:58:00] heart can be.
[1:58:03] No longer I bear [singing and music]
[1:58:05] the burden of care. His yoke is so sweet
[1:58:09] to [singing] me.
[1:58:12] My soul was in black [music]
[1:58:14] at night,
[1:58:16] but darkness has taken light.
[1:58:19] [singing and music]
[1:58:21] Now I shout the victory [singing]
[1:58:25] for Jesus [music] has set me free.
[1:58:30] I look [singing] on the great white
[1:58:32] throne.
[1:58:35] Before it the ransom [music and singing]
[1:58:37] stand.
[1:58:39] No longer our tears, no sorrow is known,
[1:58:43] [singing and music] nor death in that
[1:58:45] goodly land.
[1:58:48] My Savior [music] has gone before,
[1:58:53] preparing the waiting for me.
[1:58:57] Soon we'll meet to part no [singing]
[1:59:01] more through time or eternity. Let's
[1:59:04] sing the third verse. The gates
[1:59:06] [singing and music] of that holy place
[1:59:10] stand open by night and day.
[1:59:13] [music and singing]
[1:59:15] Oh, look to the Lord who giveth more
[1:59:19] grace, whose love is prepared [singing]
[1:59:22] the way. [music]
[1:59:24] A home in his manions [singing]
[1:59:27] fair.
[1:59:29] his [music] hand at preserve for all
[1:59:32] [singing]
[1:59:33] for the wedding feast prepare [singing]
[1:59:38] obeying [music]
[1:59:39] the graious call.
[1:59:42] Oh [singing] Jesus [music] is coming
[1:59:45] soon.
[1:59:46] Our trials [singing] will then be all.
[1:59:52] What if our Lord this moment should come
[1:59:56] for those [singing and music] who are
[1:59:57] free from sin?
[2:00:00] Well, then would it bring it joy?
[2:00:04] For sorrow [music and singing] and deep
[2:00:07] despair.
[2:00:09] When our [singing] morning glory comes,
[2:00:13] [music] we'll meet him up in the air.
[2:00:16] [singing]
[2:00:18] Since Jesus has set me free,
[2:00:22] I'm happy as heart [singing and music]
[2:00:25] can be.
[2:00:27] No longer I bear the burden of hair. His
[2:00:32] yoke [music] is so sweet to me.
[2:00:34] [singing]
[2:00:37] Was his black.
[2:00:40] My darkness has taken.
[2:00:43] [music and singing]
[2:00:45] Now I shout the victory
[2:00:49] for [music and singing] Jesus has set me
[2:00:52] free.
[2:00:56] Hallelujah.
[2:00:58] And know
[2:01:00] how I love Jesus.
[2:01:09] Oh. [singing]
[2:01:11] Oh, now I love you, Jesus.
[2:01:17] [singing and music]
[2:01:20] Oh,
[2:01:23] how I love [singing and music] you,
[2:01:25] Jesus,
[2:01:30] [music]
[2:01:31] because
[2:01:33] he first [singing]
[2:01:36] love me. to me he's so wonderful
[2:01:41] to me
[2:01:45] he is [singing and music] so wonderful
[2:01:51] yes to me
[2:01:55] he is [singing and music] so wonderful
[2:02:01] oh [music and singing]
[2:02:03] to me
[2:02:06] he is so wonderful
[2:02:13] because
[2:02:15] he first
