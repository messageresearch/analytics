[4:32] According
[4:34] [Music]
[4:40] to my
[4:44] according to
[4:46] my promises
[4:49] I can stand.
[4:54] You are upon my heart.

[5:14] [Music]
[5:15] Good evening and God bless you all.
[5:17] Let's all stand and like to take the
[5:20] opportunity while I ask our brother Art
[5:23] if you could come up in the service with
[5:24] a word of prayer.
[5:33] Amen. Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus,
[5:36] Father God, thank you Lord for allowing
[5:38] us to be in this house, Lord, to come
[5:40] and to worship you, Father, to give you
[5:42] thanks. And as always, Lord God, we
[5:44] realize as a prophet has stated it so
[5:46] many times, there's nothing that we
[5:48] could ever do to merit your grace. And
[5:50] we know God, we fall short each and
[5:52] every day. As our our prophet taught us,
[5:55] Paul said, "I die daily." So first Lord
[5:57] God, we want to ask that you forgive us
[5:59] of our sins and our shortcomings even
[6:02] Lord as the scripture says that we
[6:03] forgive those that trespass against us.
[6:06] Father we invite your presence because
[6:08] we know Lord God if we come and you
[6:10] don't meet us the service is in vain.
[6:13] Lord you said where two or three were
[6:14] gathered in your name that you'd be
[6:15] there in the midst. And father there's
[6:17] more than that here. And father, our
[6:19] desire is to come and to worship you, to
[6:22] receive from you, God, to get strength,
[6:24] to help us, Lord, to live a life where
[6:26] the gospel. Please God, take away any
[6:28] doubt, thoughts, fear, pain, whatever
[6:31] might be struggling or battling the
[6:32] people with and ask Lord that you would
[6:34] come in each and every heart. Cleanse
[6:36] us, Father. Help us to focus on you to
[6:38] get ourselves out of the way. God, we
[6:40] commit this service. We ask a blessing
[6:41] in your anointing in the name of the
[6:43] Lord Jesus Christ and for that glory.
[6:45] Amen.
[6:47] Amen.
[6:51] Amen. Let's just take a few moments just
[6:53] to worship Almighty God. Amen. Let's go
[6:56] to the key of C.
[7:01] It's beginning to rain.
[7:06] Hear the voice of our father.
[7:10] [Music]
[7:14] So ever
[7:17] drinking of his water.
[7:22] He promised to pour his spirit out on
[7:27] his son and his daughters.
[7:31] [Music]
[7:32] If you're thirsty and dry, look up to
[7:36] the sky. It's beginning to rain.
[7:42] [Music]
[7:44] The turtle doves are singing sweet songs
[7:49] of mourning.
[7:55] Leaves of the trees turn to silver
[7:58] clouds to the sky.
[8:05] The silent clouds up above are beginning
[8:10] together.
[8:14] There's
[8:17] thirsty
[8:20] and so am I.
[8:24] It's beginning to rain.
[8:30] Hear the voice of the father.
[8:35] He's saying whosoever
[8:39] will come drink of this water.
[8:45] He promised to pour his spirit up on his
[8:51] sons and his daughters.
[8:55] If you're thirsty and dry, look up to
[8:59] the sky. You may be seated. We'll sing
[9:03] that chorus one more time.
[9:05] It's beginning to rain
[9:11] to the voice of our father.
[9:16] He's saying
[9:18] whosoever
[9:20] will drink of this water.
[9:25] [Music]
[9:26] He promised to pour his spirit out on
[9:32] his son and he's on earth.
[9:37] If you're thirsty and dry, look up to
[9:41] the sky. It's beginning to rain.
[9:45] [Music]
[9:49] Go to the key of B flat.
[9:52] [Music]
[9:54] Jesus has a table spread where the
[9:58] saints of God are fed. He invites his
[10:02] chosen people come and lie
[10:07] with his men
[10:11] and supplies their every need. Oh, too
[10:15] sweet to suffer with Jesus all the time.
[10:21] Come and die. The master of fallen. Come
[10:24] and die.
[10:26] [Music]
[10:35] [Music]
[10:52] Oy Christ's command for the master
[10:57] to come and die.
[11:02] There they found their hearts desire.
[11:05] bread and fish upon the fire. Thus he
[11:09] satisfies the hungry every time.
[11:15] Come and die. The master call it come
[11:19] and die.

[11:38] callth now. Come and die.
[11:43] Come and die. The master callth. Come
[11:47] and die.
[11:50] You make feast at Jesus table all the
[11:54] time.
[11:55] [Music]
[11:57] He fed the multitude.
[12:00] Turn the water into wine.
[12:05] Hungry calling. Now come and die.
[12:10] [Music]
[12:13] &gt;&gt; Let's go to E flat.
[12:18] We find many people who can't understand
[12:23] why we are so happy and free.
[12:28] We've crossed over Jordan to Canaan fair
[12:32] land. And this is like heaven to me.
[12:37] Oh, this is like heaven to me.
[12:43] This is like heaven to me.
[12:47] I've crossed over Jordan to Kadan land
[12:52] and this is like heaven to me.
[12:57] So when I get happy, I sing and I shout.
[13:02] The devil don't believe it, I see.
[13:07] But I'm filled with the spirit. There
[13:10] isn't a doubt. And that's what's the
[13:14] matter with me.
[13:17] Oh, that's what's the matter with me.
[13:23] That's what's the matter with me.
[13:27] I've crossed over Jordan to spare them.
[13:32] And that's what's the matter with me.
[13:37] We've heard the sweet music, the
[13:40] heavenly cord, glory land over the sea.
[13:47] A so thrilling message from Jesus our
[13:51] Lord. And this is like heaven to me.
[13:57] Oh, this is like heaven to me.
[14:03] This is like heaven to me.
[14:07] I crossed over Jordan to Maryland and
[14:13] this is like heaven. One more time with
[14:15] all your heart. Oh, this is like heaven
[14:20] to me.
[14:23] This is like heaven to me.
[14:27] I crossed over Jordan to Canaan's fair
[14:31] land. And this is like heaven to me.
[14:40] Let's go to the key of G.
[14:43] [Music]
[14:45] I was sinking deep in sin, far from the
[14:50] peaceful shore,
[14:54] very deeply sane within,
[14:59] sinking to rise no more.
[15:04] But the master of the sea heard my
[15:10] despairing cry
[15:14] from the waters lifted me. Now say
[15:20] am I
[15:24] love lifted me.
[15:29] Love lifted me
[15:34] and nothing else could help. Love lifted
[15:41] me.
[15:44] Love lifted me.
[15:49] Love lifted me.
[15:54] When nothing else could help
[16:02] lifting
[16:04] me
[16:08] souls in danger
[16:11] above,
[16:13] Jesus completely saves.
[16:18] He will lift you by his love out of the
[16:24] hairy waves.
[16:28] He's the master of the sea. Fills his
[16:34] will oy.
[16:37] He your savior wants to be saved
[16:44] today.
[16:47] Love lifted me.
[16:52] Love lifted me.
[16:56] [Music]
[16:57] When nothing else would love, love
[17:03] lifted me.
[17:07] Love lifted me.
[17:12] Love lifted me.
[17:17] When nothing comes good,
[17:22] love
[17:25] lifted.
[17:27] [Music]
[17:34] As we prepare to change the order of the
[17:35] service, let's all stand.
[17:42] In Christ alone,
[17:46] my hope is found.
[17:49] He is my light, my strength,
[17:53] my song.
[17:56] This corner stone.
[17:59] This solid ground
[18:03] firm through the fiercest ground
[18:06] and storm.
[18:08] What heights of love?
[18:12] What depths of peace?
[18:15] When fears are still,
[18:18] when striving cease.
[18:21] My comforter,
[18:24] my all in all.
[18:28] Here in the love of Christ
[18:32] I stand.
[18:38] In Christ alone
[18:41] who took on flesh
[18:45] fullness of God in helpless
[18:49] faith.
[18:50] His gift of love
[18:54] and righteousness
[18:56] [Music]
[18:57] scorned by the ones he came
[19:01] to save.
[19:03] Till on that cross
[19:06] as Jesus died,
[19:09] the wrath of God
[19:12] was sisfied
[19:15] for every sin.
[19:18] On him was laid.
[19:22] Here in the death of Christ
[19:26] I live.
[19:31] There in the ground.
[19:34] His body laid.
[19:37] Light of the world by darkness
[19:41] lain.
[19:43] and bursting forth
[19:46] in glorious day.
[19:50] Up from the grave he rose
[19:54] again.
[19:56] And as he stands
[19:59] in victory.
[20:02] Sin's curse has lost
[20:05] its grip on me.
[20:08] For I am his
[20:11] and he is mine.
[20:14] Bought with the precious blood
[20:18] of Christ.
[20:21] [Music]
[20:23] No guilt in life.
[20:26] No fear in death.
[20:30] This is the power of Christ
[20:34] in me.
[20:36] From life's first cry
[20:39] to final breath,
[20:42] Jesus commands my death.
[20:47] [Music]
[20:48] No power of hell.
[20:51] No scheme of man
[20:54] can ever pluck
[20:57] me from his hand
[21:00] till he returns
[21:03] or calls me home.
[21:07] Here in the power of Christ
[21:10] I'll stand.
[21:15] [Music]
[21:25] Give me the key for day star.
[21:32] Liy of the valley.
[21:36] Let your sweet aroma
[21:40] fill my life.
[21:49] Rose of Sher show me
[21:54] how to grow in beauty in God's sight.
[22:01] [Music]
[22:07] Farest of 10,000.
[22:11] Make me a reflection of your life.
[22:23] Day stars shine down on me.
[22:28] Let your love shine through me in the
[22:32] night.
[22:35] [Music]
[22:40] Lead me, Lord. I'll follow.
[22:45] Anywhere you open up the door.
[22:57] Let your word speak to me.
[23:01] Show me what I've never seen
[23:06] before.
[23:10] [Music]
[23:13] Lord, I want to be your witness.
[23:18] You can take what's wrong and make it
[23:22] right.
[23:26] [Music]
[23:30] Day stars shine down on me.
[23:35] Let your love shine through me in the
[23:39] night.
[23:40] [Music]
[23:47] When I seen a world that's dying,
[23:52] wounded by the master of deceit.
[23:59] [Music]
[24:04] Roing in the darkness,
[24:08] haunted by the years that paste
[24:14] [Music]
[24:22] standing near me,
[24:25] shining With compassion in your eyes,
[24:32] in your eyes,
[24:35] [Music]
[24:42] let your love shine through me in the
[24:46] night.
[24:48] [Music]
[24:54] Lead me, Lord, I'll follow.
[24:58] Anywhere you open up the door.
[25:05] [Music]
[25:11] Let your word speak to me.
[25:15] Show me what I've never seen
[25:19] before.
[25:22] [Music]
[25:23] Lord
[25:27] Lord, I want to be your witness.
[25:31] You can take what's wrong and make it
[25:35] right.
[25:39] Take it right.
[25:44] Day star shine down.
[25:48] Let your love shine through me in the
[25:52] night.
[26:00] Day stars shine down on me.
[26:05] Let your love shine through me
[26:09] in the night.
[26:11] [Music]
[26:16] Amen. God bless you saints. So good to
[26:19] be in the house of the glory with you
[26:20] tonight. Amen. welcome you to the house
[26:23] of the Lord. Amen. Are you happy to be
[26:26] here?
[26:27] &gt;&gt; God bless you richly. So happy to see
[26:29] each of you. A pleasant surprise to see
[26:32] brother Art and Sister Annabelle and
[26:34] each of you. Amen. This is our prayer
[26:36] meeting tonight and we'll take a few
[26:39] moments to go into the word and um trust
[26:42] it to be a blessing to you. We'll turn
[26:44] in the scripture. Sorry. Yes. We're
[26:48] turning to scripture in Revelations
[26:51] chapter 1
[26:56] and also Matthew 28:19,
[26:59] the great commission.
[27:01] And we're just going to take a
[27:05] simple but deep subject on water
[27:07] baptism.
[27:10] And we all know
[27:14] what it is.
[27:17] But how important is it to us?
[27:21] And this is what we should be preaching.
[27:25] Go into all the world and preach the
[27:26] gospel. Now in Revelations chapter 1
[27:30] verse
[27:31] number
[27:41] we'll start with verse
[27:44] number three. Blessed is he that
[27:48] readeth,
[27:50] and they that hear the words of this
[27:52] prophecy, and keep those things which
[27:55] are written therein, for the time is at
[27:57] hand.
[28:01] Sorry, my Bible. John to the seven
[28:03] churches which are in Asia. Grace be
[28:06] unto you and peace from him which is
[28:09] which was which is to come from the
[28:12] seven spirits which are before his
[28:14] throne. From Jesus Christ who is the
[28:16] faithful witness and the first begotten
[28:19] of the dead and the prince of kings of
[28:22] the earth. Unto him that loved us and
[28:24] washed us from our sins in his own
[28:27] blood. had made us kings and priests
[28:29] unto God and his father. To him be glory
[28:33] and dominion forever and ever. Amen.
[28:36] Behold, he cometh with clouds, and every
[28:39] eye shall see him. And they also which
[28:41] pierce him, and all kindreds of the
[28:43] earth shall because of him. Even so,
[28:47] amen. I am Alpha and Omega, the
[28:51] beginning and the ending, sayaeth the
[28:53] Lord, which is, which was,
[28:57] &gt;&gt; which is to come, the Almighty.
[29:01] Take that verse. He says it again,
[29:04] saying, verse 11, saying, I am Alpha and
[29:08] Omega, the first and the last. And what
[29:11] thou seeest write in a book, and send
[29:13] unto the seven churches, which are in
[29:15] Asia, unto Ephesus, unto Smyrna, unto
[29:19] Pergamus, unto Thyra, unto Sardis, and
[29:23] to Philadelphia, and unto Leodysia.
[29:27] Verse 17. And when I saw him, I fell at
[29:30] his feet as dead. And he laid his right
[29:32] hand upon me, saying unto me, fear not.
[29:36] I am the first and the last. I am he
[29:39] that liveth and was dead. Behold, I am
[29:42] alive forever more. Amen. And have the
[29:45] keys of hell and death. Amen. So, we
[29:50] know who's speaking there in Matthew 28,
[29:54] the great commission.
[29:59] And one of the more controversial
[30:03] um
[30:06] issues amongst the denominations
[30:13] when it comes to water baptism is this
[30:15] scripture right here. Matthew 28 verse
[30:18] 19
[30:21] verse 18. And Jesus came and spake unto
[30:23] them, saying, All power is given unto me
[30:27] in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore
[30:30] and teach all nations, baptizing them in
[30:33] the name of the Father and of the Son
[30:36] and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to
[30:39] observe all things, whatsoever things I
[30:42] have commanded you. And lo, I am with
[30:46] you always, even unto the end of the
[30:49] world. Amen. Amen. And let's pray. Lord
[30:52] Jesus, we ask your blessings on this
[30:55] service tonight. Ask your blessing on
[30:57] this portion of the word, oh God, and
[31:00] just help us, Lord, to say what you
[31:02] place on our hearts and help us to,
[31:05] Lord, to receive from you, the great
[31:08] Holy Spirit. We commit our ways to you,
[31:10] Lord. We ask you to come on the scene
[31:13] and meet the needs that we have. In
[31:16] Jesus name we pray. Amen. God bless. You
[31:20] can be seated. Water baptism. Simple
[31:23] subject.
[31:24] But that is what was on my heart this
[31:27] morning. I got up this morning and was
[31:30] going through some of the scriptures and
[31:33] um I realized the great
[31:37] debate amongst
[31:40] you know most Christians in the
[31:42] Christian church baptized in these
[31:45] titles father son and holy ghost. And
[31:48] they use this scripture here in Matthew
[31:50] 28:19 to do so. Now, in the book of Acts
[31:54] all the way through Acts chapter 2 on,
[31:59] you'll find that the disciples Peter
[32:03] being there that heard this great
[32:05] command and great commission that
[32:08] everyone that was baptized was baptized
[32:12] in the name of the Lord or the Lord
[32:15] Jesus or the Lord Jesus Christ.
[32:18] In the King James version Bible, it
[32:20] brings that
[32:22] um I think the Lamza Bible takes the
[32:25] Pacetta which is um taken from the
[32:29] Syriak language which is a dialect from
[32:32] the Aramaic. Brother Random speaks of
[32:34] this um and of this in translation Dr.
[32:40] Lamza, I can't think of his first name.
[32:42] Anyways, and also the Greek dialogue
[32:47] when you go to those scriptures, Dr.
[32:49] Lamza puts right there in Acts chapter
[32:52] 2, Acts 8, Acts 9, the Lord Jesus
[32:57] Christ. So in your King James version,
[33:00] it'll say Lord Jesus or the name of the
[33:04] Lord. But in none of them are there the
[33:08] titles father, son and holy ghost when
[33:12] the individual is getting baptized.
[33:15] This is very clear. It is um not
[33:20] debatable.
[33:22] Many of the scholars, even the
[33:24] trinitarian scholars will agree that the
[33:28] and the Catholics will agree that the
[33:30] original church when baptizing they used
[33:34] the name of the Lord Jesus.
[33:38] But as the church grew on in what they
[33:41] call revelation and they instituted
[33:44] doctrines and forms on how to do things,
[33:48] they begin to 100 years, 200 years after
[33:52] they begin to take on these titles of
[33:56] father, son, and holy ghost. And I
[33:58] thought that was quite interesting that
[34:00] many of them will agree that the
[34:01] original church did it this way. Um the
[34:05] book of Acts shows that they did it this
[34:07] way. So why are we doing it a different
[34:10] way today? Why are many churches doing
[34:12] it a different way today? And it's
[34:17] simple that you know truth gets lost
[34:21] when you don't stay with it.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; And you got to stay with the original
[34:26] truth that came.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if all of the apostles and the
[34:30] apostles after them all went into the
[34:34] water and baptized these individuals in
[34:38] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, why
[34:41] would we change that? Who has the
[34:43] authority or the power to change it? And
[34:46] they have done it. So most of the
[34:48] churches,
[34:50] in fact, most many Christians, if you
[34:52] ask them how they were baptized, some of
[34:55] them don't even know how they were
[34:56] baptized.
[34:58] It's very interesting that you ask them
[35:00] how they they'll say, "Well, I was
[35:01] baptized in water because the teaching
[35:04] and the understanding that uh there is a
[35:08] correct formula to be baptized." And you
[35:10] say, "Well, water baptism doesn't save
[35:13] you." And that's true. Water baptism
[35:15] doesn't save you. Your faith in Jesus
[35:18] Christ is what saves you.
[35:20] But if you are saved, Jesus said, "Go
[35:24] therefore and teach all nations,
[35:27] baptizing them." So this baptism is a
[35:32] must for the Christian.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; So let's take Acts chapter 19 just for a
[35:36] moment and we'll see if it really makes
[35:39] a difference. Okay?
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Now, many of you all can come up here
[35:46] and preach this sermon for me,
[35:48] &gt;&gt; or you should be able to.
[35:50] All right.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; If you can't come up here and preach it,
[35:57] you should be able to preach it on your
[35:58] job
[35:59] &gt;&gt; or on the streets.
[36:02] Acts 19 verse one. And it came to pass
[36:05] that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul
[36:08] having passed through the upper coast
[36:10] came to where?
[36:13] Ephesus and finding certain disciples.
[36:18] So, let's back up a minute. I'm moving a
[36:21] little ahead of myself. Who are these
[36:23] disciples that they found? So, let's go
[36:27] to Matthew.
[36:30] This is at the beginning of John the
[36:32] Baptist's ministry. Matthew chapter 3,
[36:34] just for a moment
[36:38] in verse number one.
[36:42] When you have that, you can say, "Amen."
[36:49] Amen.
[36:51] In those days came John the who?
[36:54] &gt;&gt; Baptist.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; What was he doing?
[36:57] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist preaching in the
[37:00] wilderness of Judea, saying, "Repent ye,
[37:03] for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[37:05] For this is he that was spoken of by the
[37:07] prophet Isaiah, saying, "The voice of
[37:10] one crying in the wilderness, prepare ye
[37:12] the way of the Lord, make his path
[37:14] straight." And the same John had his
[37:17] raignment, camel&lt;unk&gt;s hair, leather
[37:19] gutter about loins, and his meat was
[37:22] locust and wild honey. then went out
[37:26] then went out to him Jerusalem and all
[37:29] Judea and all the region round about
[37:32] Jordan and were what?
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Baptized
[37:36] &gt;&gt; baptized of him in Jordan doing what?
[37:40] &gt;&gt; Confessing their
[37:41] &gt;&gt; confessing their sins. So here's John
[37:44] preaching to all of Judea and all the
[37:46] region about very popular ministry. He
[37:50] had a ministry amongst the worldly
[37:52] folks, the kings, the the the uh the
[37:56] leaders in charge knew who John was. He
[37:59] had a reputation. He preached. He was
[38:02] out in the wilderness eating locust and
[38:05] honey. A wild man, preaching baptism,
[38:10] something we had never seen before. He
[38:13] comes out of nowhere. Brother Random
[38:16] describes him as an eagle that lands on
[38:19] the banks of the Jordan.
[38:22] Like an eagle that lands there. He lands
[38:25] in Jordan there. Prophet 400 years, no
[38:29] prophet. And here comes John the Baptist
[38:32] in the spirit of Isaiah in as Isaiah
[38:36] said he would come as the voice of one
[38:38] crying in the wilderness. And he's
[38:39] baptizing many many people. In verse
[38:44] number 11
[38:47] says this,
[38:49] he preached his sermon, the axes laid to
[38:51] the root of the tree. And he's telling
[38:54] them to repent, bring forth fruit. And
[38:57] he's preaching his ministry. In verse 11
[39:00] says, I indeed baptize you with water
[39:03] unto repentance, but he that cometh
[39:05] after me is mightier than I, whose shoes
[39:09] I am not worthy to bear. you he shall
[39:12] baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with
[39:15] fire. And so we see John the Baptist's
[39:19] ministry moving forward. He is baptizing
[39:24] the whole region. Mark 1 verse4 says
[39:28] this
[39:33] verse three the voice of one crying in
[39:35] the wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[39:37] Lord makes his path straight. John did
[39:40] baptize in the wilderness and preached
[39:42] the baptism of repentance for the
[39:45] remission of sins. And there went out
[39:48] unto him in all the land of Judea. And
[39:51] they of Jerusalem and were all baptized
[39:55] of him in the river of Jordan confessing
[39:58] their sins. It wasn't a little ministry.
[40:01] It was a tremendous ministry. and his
[40:04] ministry was getting the people to
[40:06] repent
[40:07] &gt;&gt; and to be baptized. Now this uh baptism
[40:12] in water is an outward uh symbol and it
[40:18] is an outward
[40:20] uh uh work an outward emotion is what
[40:24] brother Vanom calls it that an inward
[40:27] work has taken place. It is essential.
[40:32] It is what we preach is what we do.
[40:35] Jesus himself was baptized.
[40:38] John is com commanded to go and preach
[40:42] repentance and he's bringing in all of
[40:44] these souls in all of the region around
[40:47] to be baptized. He baptizes them unto
[40:51] repentance. Now, it's interesting how
[40:55] the Lord knows that this ministry or
[40:59] this baptism would one day have to be
[41:03] changed. And here it is in Acts 19.
[41:05] Let's go back there and see
[41:10] where this change took place.
[41:13] So Paul now after his conversion,
[41:16] the Holy Ghost have been given out in
[41:18] Acts chapter 2. And here Acts 19, Paul
[41:24] comes to the upper coats of Ephesus.
[41:27] It's one of the largest cities of all of
[41:29] the seven or eight churches there. The
[41:31] Corinth, Ephesus, Thara, all of those
[41:34] churches that we read about in
[41:35] Revelations there. Ephesus was the
[41:38] largest and where one of the first
[41:40] churches were born. They were more
[41:42] mature. They had a lot of um believers
[41:45] there. Paul started the work there. I
[41:48] think it was two years he settled in and
[41:50] preached in in in during the daytime and
[41:54] would um and and go into synagogues and
[41:59] teach and preach and many people
[42:01] received him and many rejected him. But
[42:05] Ephesus is now he's finding these
[42:07] disciples here. Verse two. And he said
[42:10] unto them, "Have you received the Holy
[42:12] Ghost since you believed?"
[42:14] And they said unto him, "We have not so
[42:16] much as heard whether there be any Holy
[42:18] Ghost." And he said unto them, "Well, it
[42:22] doesn't matter. Just let me pray for you
[42:24] so you can receive the Holy Ghost." Is
[42:26] that what he said?
[42:28] &gt;&gt; That is not what he said.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; What did he asked them?
[42:34] &gt;&gt; He asked them, "How what? How were you
[42:37] baptized? If water baptism doesn't make
[42:41] a difference, why is the Apostle Paul
[42:44] asking these people, "How were you
[42:47] baptized?"
[42:49] &gt;&gt; It is a question you need to know. You
[42:51] need to know why you were baptized the
[42:54] way you were baptized. You need to know
[42:56] how you were baptized. This is the
[43:00] truth, saints, that we all have
[43:02] received. And this is not the truth that
[43:05] we receive and just sit on it. This is
[43:09] the truth that we receive and we go tell
[43:11] it to other people because most people
[43:14] don't know this truth.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; They don't understand that this even
[43:18] exist. Acts 19. Most people think, well,
[43:21] water baptis, it doesn't matter. As long
[43:23] as I gave my heart to the Lord. That is
[43:25] not what Paul said here.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Paul asked him, "Have you received the
[43:30] Holy Ghost since you believe? You're
[43:32] believers. Thank God for that. You've
[43:35] come a long way. Praise the Lord for
[43:36] that. Have you received the Holy Ghost
[43:39] in your journey?"
[43:41] And he said, "No, we haven't received
[43:42] that. What are you talking about?" He
[43:44] says, "Okay, well, let's let's go back.
[43:45] Let's back up here. How were you
[43:47] baptized?"
[43:49] Very nice.
[43:51] And he said unto them, unto what then
[43:54] were you baptized? And they said unto
[43:57] John's baptism,
[43:59] John's ministry caught us.
[44:03] Then said Paul, John verily baptized
[44:06] with the baptism of repentance, saying
[44:08] unto the people, they that should
[44:09] believe on him should come after him,
[44:13] that is on Christ Jesus. When they heard
[44:18] this, they were baptized in the name of
[44:23] the Lord Jesus. So, here's believers
[44:26] that had to get rebaptized.
[44:29] How many of you have been baptized more
[44:30] than once? Yeah.
[44:34] It was necessary, wasn't it?
[44:38] Um, when the truth comes your way, it
[44:40] came their way. They didn't fight with
[44:42] it. They didn't know what the Holy Ghost
[44:44] was. Paul just simply tells them you're
[44:47] he didn't discredit what their their
[44:49] journey. He didn't discredit their
[44:50] journey. He said John baptized with
[44:52] repentance. But John's ministry was
[44:55] exactly right. That's what you were
[44:56] supposed to do. But he was preaching of
[44:59] something coming. And that something
[45:01] coming has arrived.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; And that something that was coming was
[45:05] the Lord Jesus.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Now you need to be rebaptized again. Now
[45:10] look at this.
[45:12] Paul said, "And when they heard this,
[45:14] they were baptized in the name of the
[45:15] Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid his
[45:18] hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on
[45:21] them, and they spake with tongues and
[45:24] prophesied. And all the men were about
[45:27] 12." So we see it just just doesn't end
[45:32] at baptism, does it? We got to go to the
[45:35] Holy Ghost.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; John said it in his ministry. I wonder
[45:40] not everybody caught it. Maybe not all
[45:43] all all the people understood it. Maybe
[45:45] certainly these uh disciples didn't
[45:48] catch it because John said, "I am
[45:50] baptizing you unto repentance, but the
[45:52] one coming after me, he's mightier than
[45:55] me. He'll baptize you with the Holy
[45:57] Ghost and with fire." So Paul brings
[46:01] that to those disciples.
[46:05] Luke 3:16, John said, 'I indeed baptize
[46:08] you with water. John 1:26,
[46:12] same thing. John St. John 1:31 all the
[46:15] way through is John speaking of the Holy
[46:19] Ghost that would come after him. But he
[46:23] had a great ministry and he caught a lot
[46:25] of disciples under his ministry.
[46:30] But still the truth of God had to come
[46:32] their way. And what was that truth?
[46:34] water baptism in the name of the Lord
[46:37] Jesus Christ. All of the disciples did
[46:40] it this way. All of the disciples that
[46:44] heard this great commission in Matthew
[46:46] 28:19,
[46:48] they performed water baptism just this
[46:53] way. you know, Jesus was baptized by
[46:56] John
[46:57] and um um and the importance of the
[47:02] believer coming to get into a pool of
[47:06] water, a body of water, whether it's
[47:10] muddy or dirty, whether it's cold or
[47:13] warm, whether it's a natural tributary
[47:16] or some metal tub, whether it's a tank
[47:19] in a sign synagogue or wherever it is,
[47:22] the command to to be baptized is there
[47:26] among all of us to be a believer moving
[47:29] forward in your Christian journey. And I
[47:32] wonder if this isn't a nice piece for us
[47:35] to step in and witness the gospel to
[47:38] somebody who doesn't know this truth
[47:41] because it is a truth and many people
[47:43] don't know it.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Jesus is dealing with this
[47:50] alpha. I'm alpha and omega. I'm first. I
[47:53] am the last. I'm he that was alive and
[47:57] then I died, but I'm living again. I
[48:01] have the keys of death in hell. It is
[48:05] witnessing. It is speaking of who he was
[48:10] in this great father, son, and holy
[48:14] ghost um dilemma that we have here.
[48:17] Matthew 28:19
[48:19] says, "Go ye therefore and teach all
[48:21] nations, baptizing them in the name of
[48:23] the Father and of the Son and of the
[48:26] Holy Ghost." Now, in the book of Acts,
[48:27] this is what they did. Let's turn there.
[48:30] Acts chapter 2,
[48:37] where the day of Pentecost was fully
[48:39] come. They were gathered in one place.
[48:43] The Holy Spirit falls down
[48:46] upon the cites, the Arabians, the
[48:48] Assyrians, strangers, people from
[48:51] different parts of Asia in Judea.
[48:55] No doubt many of these came under the
[48:58] ministry of John as well.
[49:01] And in verse number 37 says, "Now when
[49:04] they heard this, they were pricked in
[49:07] their heart and said unto Peter and to
[49:08] the rest of the apostles, men and
[49:11] brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter
[49:14] said unto them, "Repent and be
[49:17] baptized." How many of you?
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Every one of you. In the name
[49:23] &gt;&gt; of the Father and the Son and of the
[49:25] Holy Ghost.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Well, he does it. He does it in the name
[49:31] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[49:34] sins. Now, I've heard many people say,
[49:37] "I would rather listen to Jesus than to
[49:40] listen to Peter."
[49:43] And they're quoting this out of the
[49:45] Bible. I would rather listen to Jesus
[49:47] than listen to anybody, too. That's
[49:49] right. But who is speaking in this Bible
[49:51] right here? That that is Jesus that is
[49:54] speaking. In Acts 2:38, what Peter did,
[49:58] he did exactly what Jesus told him to
[50:01] do. There's no contradiction in the
[50:04] word. I mean, if we're going to separate
[50:07] the Bible that way, my good luck moving
[50:10] forward and just deciphering, you know,
[50:14] I could take this Paul. I heard our old
[50:16] church that we come out of and I was in
[50:18] the organization, the the bishop would
[50:20] say that there was uh people that would
[50:23] uh talking about women and their dress
[50:26] and the order of the church. And there
[50:29] were people that would say that Paul was
[50:31] he hated women. He had a problem with
[50:33] women. That's why he was so hard on
[50:34] them. Could you imagine somebody saying
[50:37] that about you know this is a Bible
[50:41] character. This is the Apostle Paul.
[50:43] This is what he laid out. Here's Peter
[50:46] doing exactly what the Lord told him to
[50:49] do. He baptizes them in the name of
[50:52] Jesus Christ.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:56] And so we know it is essential. How many
[51:00] can say amen to that?
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Let's take an Old Testament scripture.
[51:05] It doesn't really um the Old Testament
[51:08] doesn't share or show us water baptism,
[51:12] but there are some places where the
[51:15] priest had to be washed. Exodus 19 and
[51:19] 10.
[51:21] And the Bible says this here.
[51:25] It's not baptism, but you can kind of
[51:27] see that this approach to the Lord, even
[51:31] the sacrifice, had to be a certain
[51:34] approach. It wasn't just coming any kind
[51:36] of way. There's a way to come. In verse
[51:40] 10, Acts
[51:42] 19:E 10, and the Lord said unto Moses,
[51:45] "Go unto the people and sanctify them
[51:48] today, and tomorrow, let them do what?
[51:53] wash
[51:54] &gt;&gt; wash their clothes. You say, "Well,
[51:56] Lord, I'm just coming. It's my heart."
[51:58] But the Lord commanded them to wash
[52:01] their clothes. Exodus 29:4
[52:04] says this.
[52:15] and Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring
[52:18] unto the door of the tabernacle of the
[52:20] congregation and shall wash them with
[52:23] water.
[52:26] Leviticus 8:6. Take one more scripture
[52:29] here
[52:32] showing the use of water in the Old
[52:34] Testament. Not just on the sacrifice,
[52:38] not just in a clean place, but the the
[52:41] the priests and the Levites and the ones
[52:43] that's coming forward, they had to be
[52:46] washed with water. The people's clothes
[52:48] had to be washed as they come forward in
[52:51] the learn. These are just shadows and
[52:53] types. We understand that. But it's
[52:55] still the same God who gave these
[52:57] commandments. Is that right?
[52:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Ex Leviticus 8:6. And Moses brought
[53:02] Aaron and his sons and wash them with
[53:07] water. Leviticus 14
[53:17] verses number 8 and N. And he that is to
[53:20] be cleansed shall wash his clothes and
[53:24] shave off all his hair, wash himself in
[53:27] water, that he may be clean. And after
[53:29] that he shall come into the camp and
[53:31] shall about carry abroad out of the tent
[53:35] seven days. But it shall be on the
[53:37] seventh day that it that he shall shave
[53:40] all his hair off his head and his beard
[53:44] and his eyebrows. Even all his hair he
[53:46] shall shave off and he shall wash his
[53:48] clothes also. He shall wash his flesh
[53:51] and water and he shall be clean. This is
[53:56] the law of a leper coming back.
[54:00] Leviticus let's take numbers 19 verse
[54:04] number 7.
[54:07] How many like these quotes?
[54:09] &gt;&gt; You know these are quotes too. Now,
[54:14] how many you like this quote book?
[54:18] Leviticus 19 verse number 7. Then the
[54:21] priest shall wash his clothes and he
[54:23] shall bathe his flesh in water and
[54:26] afterward he shall come into the camp
[54:28] and the priest shall be unclean until
[54:32] the evening. So this is the priest. I
[54:35] believe this is referring to the red
[54:39] heer and offering the sacrifices for the
[54:42] sins of the people and then he would go
[54:47] forward and have to be cleansed himself.
[54:50] The Lord dealing with Naaman told him to
[54:54] go wash in Jordan, the Jordan River and
[54:57] dip seven times. Gave him those
[54:59] instructions. Didn't fight about it.
[55:01] Didn't argue about it. He did kind of
[55:03] flex against it, didn't he? He told him
[55:05] that Naam na wanted to get healed from
[55:08] this leprosy. The Lord gave him the
[55:10] answer to go wash in Jordan. He says,
[55:12] "Well, where I'm from, our rivers are
[55:14] nicer. They're cleaner. I I like going
[55:17] there anyways, and I can maybe, you
[55:19] know, can't we can't we just do it?" He
[55:22] says,
[55:24] "My brother, if he would have told you
[55:27] something this, that, or the other,
[55:28] wouldn't you have done it?"
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Aren't you trying to get healed?
[55:32] Yeah. So, what what's with all of the
[55:34] what's with all of the you know, you you
[55:37] want to pick out your own river to get
[55:39] baptized in or wash your clothes or do
[55:41] you want to be cleansed? And he thought
[55:43] about it. Yeah. And he goes into the
[55:45] Jordan in obedience and dips seven
[55:48] times. And when he comes up out of the
[55:50] water, he was clean. His skin came back
[55:54] to him completely healed. Amen.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; It was just obedience.
[55:59] And I believe this is one of those
[56:03] deals.
[56:04] It is the obedience to the word.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Okay. What kind of water are we
[56:09] baptizing them in? Is it is it water
[56:11] from the river? Is it water from the the
[56:15] municipality?
[56:18] I mean really how important is this
[56:20] water? This water I can drink it. What
[56:22] what different you know it's the
[56:24] obedience
[56:26] and obedience is better than sacrifice
[56:29] and there's a type and there is a
[56:33] outward
[56:34] um to the people in the fellowship that
[56:38] witness this great event taking place.
[56:42] It it it might I mean theologically or
[56:45] or logically speaking, what does that
[56:48] have to do me getting into a pool of
[56:51] water and having somebody dip me in the
[56:55] water? I mean, how what what's the big
[56:58] deal? Is it really that serious? I say
[57:01] yes. Is that serious?
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus commanded the disciples to do it.
[57:08] And all through the scriptures,
[57:11] believers coming to Christ were
[57:13] commanded to do that.
[57:16] It's not a nothing, saints. It is a
[57:18] something.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; It is actually the first something when
[57:22] you're dealing with someone that wants
[57:24] to come to the Lord.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Or that needs to come to the Lord. I
[57:29] think water baptism is one of those.
[57:31] It's nice. It's easy. It's many many
[57:34] people have already been baptized. Many
[57:37] Americans know the order of it. If they
[57:40] were Catholic, of course, they were
[57:41] baptized as children. They had no clue
[57:44] about it. This is a wonderful
[57:46] opportunity to just open up your Bible
[57:48] and share with them the importance of
[57:50] water baptism.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Amen, somebody.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; But not just baptism in water. After
[57:56] baptism in water, it's the baptism of
[57:59] the Holy Spirit,
[58:02] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost in fire that is to take
[58:06] place next. Now look at Acts chapter 10
[58:10] quickly.
[58:13] This are these are the Gentiles coming
[58:16] in. Cornelius
[58:18] from the Italian band. He was a
[58:21] centurion, very important man. He was a
[58:24] military man, a Roman and um a part of
[58:30] their army. A centurion has the
[58:33] authority over a hundred men or 80, just
[58:36] depends on
[58:38] um and you know it takes a certain
[58:42] character to be to have that many people
[58:45] under you. He's a man of authority and
[58:48] he sends and but he's a religious man.
[58:51] And he has some kind of heart towards
[58:53] the Lord. He praised, the Bible
[58:56] describes him as a devout man and a man
[59:00] that feared God with all of his house.
[59:03] And he gave much arms to the people and
[59:05] prayed to God always.
[59:08] Um, this is Acts chapter 10 verses 1 and
[59:12] two.
[59:13] You know, this this man doesn't even
[59:15] have the the laws of Judeaism
[59:18] or the laws of Moses in his life. He
[59:22] this man doesn't even know the message,
[59:24] but I think he would probably do good
[59:26] for some of us in the message.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; I mean, that's a pretty nice resume to
[59:31] have and not know what he didn't know.
[59:35] And
[59:35] &gt;&gt; it's amazing how we'll criticize many of
[59:38] the elders that they was in deep or they
[59:41] did this and but but their ministries
[59:45] have reached hundreds and thousands of
[59:48] people and many converts come in under
[59:50] their ministry with what they didn't
[59:52] know.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; And we know so much
[59:56] &gt;&gt; and we have produced very little.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; It's amazing.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; We're so deep. We're so revelated. We
[1:00:02] have all the quotes. We know where
[1:00:03] everybody missed it. But a lot of the
[1:00:06] people that we flex against, they're
[1:00:08] they're the easy they're the easy target
[1:00:10] because they're highly they're visible
[1:00:12] and everybody else is throwing at them.
[1:00:13] So, I'm going to throw at them, too.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Right? And it's easy to do. It's easy to
[1:00:18] target. They ain't here to defend
[1:00:19] themselves. And by the way, I have a
[1:00:21] personal testimony of what brother did
[1:00:23] and what this brother did and how they
[1:00:25] messed up. But look at their life work
[1:00:28] and compare your life's work with their
[1:00:31] work.
[1:00:32] and then you'll stop talking.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; And and if this man is so off, he wasn't
[1:00:39] that off.
[1:00:42] He prayed always. He was devout. He
[1:00:45] feared God. And guess what? The Lord was
[1:00:49] hearing his prayer all along.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; He's one of them that like Elijah didn't
[1:00:56] know who the 7,000 were. the he he he's
[1:01:00] another one. You know, the the the the
[1:01:02] the Jews, the the religious church, the
[1:01:04] the the Holy Ghost fil church, they
[1:01:06] don't know who this man is. They don't
[1:01:08] know he he, you know, when when he goes
[1:01:13] to send to go get Peter because the
[1:01:16] vision told him to go send for this man
[1:01:18] Peter, Peter says, "Lord, we don't hang
[1:01:20] out with them people."
[1:01:23] The Lord had to send him a dream two,
[1:01:25] three times and deal with Peter. You
[1:01:27] know, Peter had an issue working with
[1:01:30] the other race.
[1:01:32] Y'all get quiet for a minute.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Peter had a problem. Remember, he he he
[1:01:38] was with the Gentiles warming up and
[1:01:40] talking, chopping it up with them.
[1:01:42] Everything was fine until the Jews
[1:01:44] showed up and then he he separated
[1:01:46] himself from them.
[1:01:50] Well, we don't do that in 2025, though.
[1:01:55] You know, the Bible deals with every
[1:01:57] spirit that you see going on today.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, it does.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; And all of us has a spirit that the
[1:02:05] Bible is trying to deal with even
[1:02:07] tonight if we'll just be honest. Amen.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; That's why we say, "Lord, help us."
[1:02:12] Right? Lord, help me. And here he is. He
[1:02:16] sends to Japa. Peter comes uh
[1:02:20] reluctantly. The Lord tells him, "Don't
[1:02:22] call anything uncommon or unclean." The
[1:02:25] vision kind of preparing him for it.
[1:02:27] Then he comes, sends men to Cornelius's
[1:02:32] house. Cornelius gathers his family in
[1:02:36] to uh hear their guests come. This Jew,
[1:02:40] this Jewish man to come into his home.
[1:02:43] Probably the first time the Jews didn't
[1:02:45] do that. and he comes into his home and
[1:02:50] verse
[1:02:51] number 34. Then Peter opened his mouth
[1:02:55] and said of a truth, I perceive that God
[1:03:00] is no respector of persons.
[1:03:03] But in every nation he that fearth him
[1:03:06] and workketh righteousness is accepted
[1:03:09] with him. Every nation. The word which
[1:03:13] God send unto the children of Israel
[1:03:15] preach in peace by Jesus Christ. He is
[1:03:17] Lord of all.
[1:03:19] That word I say you know which was
[1:03:21] published throughout all of Judea and
[1:03:23] began from Galilea after the baptism
[1:03:26] which John preached. How God anointed
[1:03:28] Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost
[1:03:31] and with power who went about doing good
[1:03:33] and healing all that were oppressed of
[1:03:35] the devil. For God was with him. This is
[1:03:38] Peter preaching in this man's house. And
[1:03:41] we are witnesses of all these things
[1:03:44] which he did both in the land of Jews
[1:03:46] and Jerusalem whom they slew and hanged
[1:03:48] on a tree. Him God raised up the third
[1:03:52] day and showed him openly not to all the
[1:03:56] people but unto witnesses chosen before
[1:03:59] of God, even to us who did eat and drink
[1:04:04] with him after he rose from the dead.
[1:04:06] Peter was an eyewitness.
[1:04:09] Verse 42. when he commanded us to preach
[1:04:11] unto the people and to testify that it
[1:04:14] is he which was ordained of God to be
[1:04:16] the judge of the quick and the dead. To
[1:04:18] him give all the prophets witness that
[1:04:21] through his name whosoever believeth in
[1:04:23] him shall receive remission of sins.
[1:04:27] Very basic message you would say very
[1:04:30] simple but it's true. These things
[1:04:33] happen. This is what Peter is saying.
[1:04:36] John's baptism. Jesus came and preached
[1:04:39] the Holy Ghost. They took him and hung
[1:04:41] him up on the tree. He died, but he rose
[1:04:44] three days later. And there's witnesses.
[1:04:47] I'm one of those witnesses. I saw him. I
[1:04:49] ate with him. There were witnesses that
[1:04:52] these things are true. And while Peter
[1:04:55] yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost
[1:04:58] fell on all of them which what?
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Heard the word.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Which heard the word. Amen.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Some people are in church and they don't
[1:05:06] hear anything.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; There's a song. It says they come
[1:05:11] emptyhanded.
[1:05:13] They come emptyhearted.
[1:05:16] And they come empty-headed.
[1:05:18] And they leave that way.
[1:05:21] It's okay to come empty-headed, but you
[1:05:23] should leave with something in your head
[1:05:26] and in your spirit that the Lord did for
[1:05:28] you.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; You came in here blank, but you don't
[1:05:31] leave out of here blank.
[1:05:33] Something happened. I received something
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost fell on them that
[1:05:43] heard the word. And they of the
[1:05:44] circumcision which believe were
[1:05:46] astonished, as many as came with Peter,
[1:05:49] because on the Gentiles also was poured
[1:05:53] out the gift of the Holy Ghost. For they
[1:05:57] heard them speak with tongues and
[1:05:59] magnify God. Then answered Peter,
[1:06:04] "You all have the Holy Ghost. You don't
[1:06:07] need to get baptized cuz you already
[1:06:09] have the Holy Spirit." Is that what he
[1:06:11] said in verse 47?
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; No. He says, "Can any man any man forbid
[1:06:18] water
[1:06:20] that these should not be baptized which
[1:06:23] has received the Holy Ghost as well as
[1:06:25] we?" And he commanded them to be
[1:06:28] baptized in the name of what?
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; The Lord.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; The Lord. Then pray they him to tarry
[1:06:35] certain days. So here's a group that
[1:06:38] actually receives the Holy Ghost before
[1:06:40] they were even baptized.
[1:06:43] And Peter still commands them
[1:06:47] even after they received the Holy Ghost
[1:06:51] to be baptized in water. Is it
[1:06:54] important?
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is it truth?
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Then go tell somebody the truth. It is
[1:07:01] the truth. And many people have missed
[1:07:03] this truth.
[1:07:05] And
[1:07:07] we don't want to leave them out there
[1:07:08] like that. Water baptism is a truth. The
[1:07:13] truth of God. And the way to be baptized
[1:07:16] is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:07:19] And there's no other way for today. It's
[1:07:24] true. Uh there's disciples that get
[1:07:26] baptized. The Bible showed that they
[1:07:28] were baptized before uh the Holy Ghost
[1:07:31] came out, but there was a change and
[1:07:33] that change is in Acts chapter 19. So
[1:07:35] you use that in in while you're
[1:07:38] witnessing. Now can I take a few places
[1:07:40] from the prophet here?
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:07:45] this
[1:07:48] water baptism even goes deeper.
[1:07:51] I know that the trinitarians or the
[1:07:55] trinity that word I don't have a problem
[1:07:58] with the word it it just it means three
[1:08:01] and um but when they define it that
[1:08:05] there's three separate persons in the
[1:08:09] godhead.
[1:08:11] Well, that's an argument. That's a
[1:08:13] debate that great smart men have debated
[1:08:16] that for years and years and years.
[1:08:20] And actually the definition of the
[1:08:22] trinity or the doctrine of the trinity
[1:08:24] has changed even amongst the
[1:08:26] trinitarians
[1:08:27] over the years. They have changed and
[1:08:29] their explanation of the trinity is
[1:08:32] quite similar to the way we would
[1:08:35] explain the oneness of the godhead.
[1:08:39] That the father, the son, and the holy
[1:08:42] spirit is the lord Jesus Christ. And
[1:08:46] many some trinitarians say that Jesus is
[1:08:49] God and that um it was the the father
[1:08:55] dwelling in him doing those works and
[1:08:58] all of the the words and the the
[1:09:01] explanation around it is very similar.
[1:09:04] You you won't find I haven't find
[1:09:06] there's a few that will actually believe
[1:09:09] in three gods that they say they believe
[1:09:12] in three gods. They'll say there's one
[1:09:13] God manifested in three persons co-equal
[1:09:19] co-eternal.
[1:09:20] They all have the same power, the same
[1:09:24] omniscience. Co-equal co-eternal three
[1:09:28] the three um distinct persons
[1:09:32] in the godhead.
[1:09:35] The three persons but the three are one
[1:09:37] is the way they'll explain it. And it's
[1:09:40] very close. Fine. No problem.
[1:09:43] They can explain it that way. They can
[1:09:45] say it that way. They quote the
[1:09:47] scriptures, the same Bible that we
[1:09:49] quote.
[1:09:51] But when it comes to water baptism,
[1:09:54] there is no compromise with that. It's
[1:09:58] either the disciples did it in the name
[1:10:00] of the Lord Jesus or they did it in the
[1:10:03] father, son, and the holy ghost, you
[1:10:06] know, order in the water. And if they
[1:10:08] did it that way, show it in the Bible.
[1:10:12] That's what you would have to that's the
[1:10:13] position that we take because it answers
[1:10:17] the question who the father is, who the
[1:10:19] son is, who the holy ghost is. When
[1:10:22] Peter baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:10:26] Jesus, Jesus said, "Go ye therefore
[1:10:29] teach all nations, baptizing them in the
[1:10:31] name." That was the command of the
[1:10:33] father and of the son and of the holy
[1:10:34] ghost. That was the command. And what
[1:10:37] did they do in obedience to the command?
[1:10:39] They did exactly what he told them to do
[1:10:42] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:10:45] which fulfills the Father, the Son, and
[1:10:48] the Holy Ghost.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; You don't have to back down on that.
[1:10:52] That's the scripture. It doesn't matter.
[1:10:54] Most of the churches doesn't don't do
[1:10:56] it. Doesn't matter that no one's heard
[1:10:58] it that way before. This is what the
[1:11:00] Bible says. It's very very clear. And if
[1:11:04] it doesn't matter, then why would Paul
[1:11:06] ask the question, how were you baptized
[1:11:09] when the subject of the Holy Ghost came
[1:11:11] up? H
[1:11:14] I would even ask the question uh today
[1:11:18] even in the message. You might have been
[1:11:20] baptized correctly, but if I asked you
[1:11:23] the question, how were you baptized? and
[1:11:26] you're blank and you don't understand
[1:11:27] it, then I would go back into those
[1:11:31] scriptures and make sure you get an
[1:11:32] understanding why you're baptized the
[1:11:34] way you're baptized because it's the
[1:11:36] understanding of what you're doing
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; that you want. You want the Lord to
[1:11:41] reveal that to you. Amen.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Can I take 10 more minutes?
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Here, the prophet of God in questions
[1:11:48] and answers says this here. He's
[1:11:50] speaking a bit on communion. We just had
[1:11:54] that on Sunday night. He says just eat
[1:11:56] of the bread. Now I know Jesus is the
[1:11:58] bread of life. That's true. But this is
[1:12:00] a symbol just like baptism.
[1:12:04] Baptism doesn't save you. Baptism is
[1:12:07] only a sign that you're witnessing to
[1:12:10] the congregation
[1:12:12] that you believe in the death, burial,
[1:12:16] and resurrection of Jesus Christ. It
[1:12:19] doesn't save you. Water will not save.
[1:12:22] It's your faith that saves you. But
[1:12:25] baptism is an order and it must be
[1:12:28] carried out because God can't say be
[1:12:31] baptized and then turn around and say it
[1:12:34] doesn't need to be done.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; He cannot issue taking communion and
[1:12:39] turn around and say there's no need to
[1:12:42] taking it. You've got to do it. It's an
[1:12:45] order forever with God.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:49] In the message communion 1965, the
[1:12:51] prophet God says this right here in this
[1:12:54] city. He says this. Now we only have
[1:12:56] three physical divine orders left to us.
[1:12:58] One of them is communion, feet, washing,
[1:13:02] water, baptism. That's the only three
[1:13:04] things. That's the perfection of the
[1:13:07] three. See, and that's the only three
[1:13:09] orders we have. We realize that that was
[1:13:12] the issue given by St. Paul in the New
[1:13:15] Testament. Now, if we would say
[1:13:17] communion should just be taking the
[1:13:20] word, I don't believe anyone has a right
[1:13:23] to take the Lord's supper until he has
[1:13:26] taken the word of the Lord into his
[1:13:29] heart.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; See, because I'm going I'll read
[1:13:33] something for you in a few m moments and
[1:13:35] you'll see. Now, notice then why then on
[1:13:39] the same basis we could absolutely
[1:13:42] justify the Salvation Army. They do not
[1:13:45] believe in any form of water baptism and
[1:13:48] says we don't need it. Now if we don't
[1:13:50] need water baptism, why are we baptized?
[1:13:54] Said the water can't save you. The blood
[1:13:57] saves you. I'll agree with that. That's
[1:13:59] right. The blood saves you, not the
[1:14:01] water. But we must take the water as an
[1:14:04] outward emotion that an inwardly work of
[1:14:08] grace has been done. See? So we so must
[1:14:11] we on communion.
[1:14:15] Now this is a strong one I'm going to
[1:14:17] read here. Now I'll save the strong one
[1:14:19] for later. All right. Paragraph 8. You
[1:14:22] somebody said later. I thought you was
[1:14:24] done.
[1:14:26] I am done just about. Paragraph number
[1:14:29] 89 in the message ordination. The
[1:14:32] prophet says this. I think that is one
[1:14:35] of the most beautiful verses. I have
[1:14:37] given you an example that you should do
[1:14:39] as I've done unto you. We should do to
[1:14:42] each other in commemoration. This it's
[1:14:46] been a practice of of the church of this
[1:14:48] group of people gatherings ever since we
[1:14:52] began and before this tabernacle was
[1:14:54] ever built when we were yet a cottage
[1:14:57] prayer meeting. We practice feet
[1:14:59] washing. Our sisters go to the room in
[1:15:01] the back. Our brethrens go to the room
[1:15:03] at the right. We observe feet washing.
[1:15:06] Strangers, if you're with us tonight,
[1:15:08] we're only happy to have you fellowship
[1:15:10] in these ordinances of God. I might
[1:15:14] explain, as I said a few minutes moments
[1:15:16] ago, the thing that God left for us to
[1:15:18] do. Water baptism, one article,
[1:15:21] communion, and remember that's only two.
[1:15:24] God is perfected in three. Feet washing
[1:15:27] is the third. See?
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we remember that years later,
[1:15:32] even in the Bible, some people try to
[1:15:35] say it's not necessary. Certainly, I
[1:15:38] don't mean to say that people's feet
[1:15:40] need washing. That isn't it. Maybe
[1:15:42] theirs didn't. Not either. But it was an
[1:15:45] act of humility. It's an act of doing
[1:15:49] just as essential as water baptism.
[1:15:53] because he has said here that I have
[1:15:55] given you an example that you should do
[1:15:58] to each other as I have done to you. We
[1:16:02] find out that a widow could not be
[1:16:04] brought in among the people unless she
[1:16:06] had large strangers and had washed the
[1:16:08] feet of the saints, showing ourselves
[1:16:11] humble. That if anything we want to be
[1:16:14] is humble because that's the secret.
[1:16:18] That's the secret to power is through
[1:16:21] humility. You're always happy when you
[1:16:24] come out of these things of doing them.
[1:16:27] It's a blessed order of fellowship that
[1:16:29] we observe here at the church.
[1:16:35] Now, the prophet of God takes
[1:16:39] um so we'll take one scripture and then
[1:16:41] I'll read this last quote in St. John 11
[1:16:45] where feet washing is mentioned.
[1:16:56] Sorry. St. John 13. Yeah.
[1:17:01] With the Lord's supper
[1:17:04] uh instituted. This is the night of our
[1:17:06] Lord's
[1:17:08] um he uh had the Passover and then Jesus
[1:17:14] washes the disciples se feet. In verse 7
[1:17:18] St. John 13:7
[1:17:20] Jesus answered and said unto him, "What
[1:17:23] I do, thou knowest not now, but thou
[1:17:25] shalt know him hereafter." Peter said
[1:17:28] unto him, "Thou shalt never wash my
[1:17:30] feet." Jesus answered him, "If I wash
[1:17:33] thee not, thou hast no part with me."
[1:17:36] Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my
[1:17:39] feet only, but also my hands and my
[1:17:42] head. Jesus said to him, "He that is
[1:17:44] washed needeth not saved to wash his
[1:17:47] feet, but is clean every with, and ye
[1:17:50] are clean, but not all, for he knew
[1:17:53] should betray him."
[1:17:55] Verse 12, he says, "Know ye what I have
[1:17:58] done to you." Verse 13, "You call me
[1:18:01] Master and Lord, you say well, for so I
[1:18:03] am. If I then, your Lord and Master,
[1:18:06] have washed your feet, you also ought to
[1:18:09] wash one another's feet. I have given
[1:18:12] you an example that you should do as I
[1:18:17] have done to you. Verily, verily, I say
[1:18:20] unto you, the servant is not greater
[1:18:22] than his Lord, neither he that is sent
[1:18:25] greater than he that sent him. If you
[1:18:29] know these things, happy are ye if you
[1:18:31] do do them. So Peter is like, Lord, I'm
[1:18:35] not going to wash you. You you'll never
[1:18:36] you'll never wash my feet. And the Lord
[1:18:38] tells Peter, "If if I don't wash your
[1:18:41] feet, you have no part with me." Jesus
[1:18:43] instituted it and showed the importance
[1:18:45] of why he instituted it. And the prophet
[1:18:49] of God said, "The foot washing is as
[1:18:53] important as water baptism." Is that
[1:18:56] right?
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Just read it for you.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; It's part of what we do. Let me take
[1:19:01] this last quotation here and show you
[1:19:05] the deception behind this father, son,
[1:19:09] and holy ghost baptism
[1:19:12] that the enemy has slipped into the
[1:19:15] church and they lost this truth. They
[1:19:18] lost the truth of water baptism in the
[1:19:20] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. So many
[1:19:23] scripture whatsoever you do in word or
[1:19:25] deed do all in the name of the Lord. You
[1:19:30] lay hands in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:19:32] You call on his name in prayer. It's um
[1:19:37] it's what we do. It's how we seal our
[1:19:39] prayer. We go, we come in the name of
[1:19:42] Jesus Christ. And when we get baptized
[1:19:45] or married or whatever we're doing, it's
[1:19:48] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:19:50] Satan doesn't like that name.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Satan wants to take it out. Lily of the
[1:19:55] valley, bright morning star, name of the
[1:19:58] father, name of the son, name of the
[1:20:00] holy ghost, the alpha, the omega. All of
[1:20:03] those things are true. The true, the
[1:20:05] one, the only. All those things are
[1:20:07] true. But what is his name?
[1:20:10] His name is Jesus Christ.
[1:20:14] And that name, demons tremble at the
[1:20:17] sound of that name. And there's a power
[1:20:20] in that name that the Apostle Paul when
[1:20:24] he saw these disciples when those
[1:20:26] believers got the understanding of what
[1:20:29] the true baptism was, he baptized them
[1:20:33] in the rebaptized them by the way in the
[1:20:36] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then
[1:20:38] laid hands on them and they received the
[1:20:40] Holy Ghost.
[1:20:43] Amen. Amen.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; So this is 1958. The baptism of the Holy
[1:20:48] Spirit, the prophet of God says this
[1:20:50] here. Let me tell you a little personal
[1:20:52] experience. Switzerland, Germany, in the
[1:20:55] places where I've been. How does fortune
[1:20:58] tellers work? How does evil spirits
[1:21:02] travel? I want you to believe me as your
[1:21:05] pastor because you're the one I'm
[1:21:07] speaking to. Devils travel in the name
[1:21:10] of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. They
[1:21:13] cut feathers and everything else and
[1:21:15] throw spells on each other through the
[1:21:18] name father, son, and holy ghost. Call
[1:21:21] it the three high names. The mother of
[1:21:24] it is the Catholic churches. They go to
[1:21:27] these little statues and kneel there,
[1:21:29] cut a feather with scissors, turn it
[1:21:31] backwards, throw spells on their
[1:21:34] neighbors, and so forth where they've
[1:21:36] burnt to death and everything else for
[1:21:38] it. So
[1:21:42] you know when we baptize in the name of
[1:21:45] the Lord Jesus Christ, we are baptizing
[1:21:48] in the name of the father, son, and holy
[1:21:50] ghost and alpha and omega and the lily
[1:21:54] of the valley and all of those. And
[1:21:56] brother Bam gives a a detail. I'm not
[1:21:58] going to take your time to read it, but
[1:21:59] he gives us testimony how the witches
[1:22:02] came against him and called up a storm
[1:22:05] in the name of Father, Son, and Holy
[1:22:08] Ghost. and and and I had this friend he
[1:22:12] he's been he's come to the way of the of
[1:22:15] partial way to the Lord he but he used
[1:22:18] to he came here uh he visited us here
[1:22:21] one time and he was always had a cross
[1:22:25] in his hand every trouble every problem
[1:22:28] he he would hold on to that cross and he
[1:22:30] pray even when he was a thug out there
[1:22:32] in the streets and when I gave my heart
[1:22:34] to the Lord he would tell me he'd give
[1:22:36] me little testimonies how the cross
[1:22:38] healed
[1:22:39] saved him and and so forth. I never
[1:22:42] challen I never said nothing to him. And
[1:22:44] then later he got saved and he realized
[1:22:47] there was no truth to it but his faith
[1:22:50] in that.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; And so we were talking about that. He's
[1:22:53] like, "Israel, you never, you know, you
[1:22:55] never challenged me on that. You just I
[1:22:57] was so ignorant. You never told me how
[1:23:00] dumb I was." I says, "Well, it you it
[1:23:03] didn't come up to to to really uh you
[1:23:06] know to bring it out to you that way."
[1:23:08] But he says, "I realized." And I was
[1:23:11] like, "Curtis, where did you you he
[1:23:13] says, I I got that from Hollywood,
[1:23:16] from watching movies,
[1:23:18] the C, get the cross in the name of
[1:23:20] Father." He, you know, he didn't read
[1:23:22] the Bible, didn't know the Bible, but
[1:23:24] the movie showed him and told him, "This
[1:23:26] is how you approach the Lord."
[1:23:28] Funny, huh? But he come to the way of
[1:23:32] the truth. Now he was baptized in the
[1:23:34] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And that
[1:23:38] is a tremendous truth that we know is
[1:23:41] the truth. Go sharpen your sword with
[1:23:44] these scriptures. Amen.
[1:23:46] Go sharpen your sword and be a witness
[1:23:50] to somebody. You know, Paul found those
[1:23:55] those other uh uh disciples. He didn't
[1:23:58] criticize them. He just went right
[1:23:59] along. Some some of these people come to
[1:24:02] the great, you know, um you know, these
[1:24:05] great conferences that these
[1:24:06] denominations have and they come up to
[1:24:08] the altar and they come because they
[1:24:10] want to get saved and something strikes
[1:24:13] their hearts and these big conferences
[1:24:16] over the years that these mega fest and
[1:24:18] and they pull in all, you know, the the
[1:24:20] men's keepers or the promiseke keepers
[1:24:23] and they've done a great work and they
[1:24:25] bring loads and loads of people to the
[1:24:27] altar and brings them to Christ and they
[1:24:30] want to get saved. And when they get to
[1:24:33] be get baptized, they typically will
[1:24:35] baptize them in the name of the Father,
[1:24:37] Son, and Holy Ghost. And when you meet
[1:24:39] these people, they're good people.
[1:24:41] They're Christian people. Thank God that
[1:24:43] you got baptized. Wonderful. Beautiful.
[1:24:46] But Paul goes deeper and shows them
[1:24:49] something deeper to their experience.
[1:24:52] Hey, brother, you know, there's a
[1:24:54] baptism here in Acts 19. Jesus said and
[1:24:58] you know you just bring those scriptures
[1:24:59] in a loving way. Amen.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; So God bless you richly
[1:25:06] that was on my heart tonight. I trust it
[1:25:09] to bless you and God be with you. We
[1:25:12] have a few prayer requests tonight.
[1:25:15] We want to
[1:25:18] go.
[1:25:20] Thankful for the healthy baby. Brother
[1:25:23] Joseph and

[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. I saw that picture. Very
[1:25:31] nice. Doing well.

[1:26:05] think, on Sunday. Remember our meetings
[1:26:08] in November.

[1:26:14] someone else that had a request? they

[1:26:18] will.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Okay. Yes. Keep brother Kevin Cassidor
[1:26:25] in prayer. Brother Kevin preached one of
[1:26:28] our meetings, one of our first meetings

[1:27:14] can't get a hold of him. I was just in
[1:27:16] his mother's house last night. So maybe
[1:27:18] I believe that's the Lord. He needs
[1:27:21] prayer. Pray for Angel. Angel Harris is
[1:27:25] his name. And the the Colombian
[1:27:27] gentleman um Omero, pray for him and
[1:27:31] that the Lord will deal with him. Been
[1:27:33] talking to him a little bit. I think
[1:27:35] Jonathan's been encouraging him a little
[1:27:37] bit. Pray for pray for him. Someone else
[1:27:41] had a request. Yes.
[1:28:04] Amen.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, thank the Lord for that. The
[1:28:16] Lord is so good to us. Amen. So Jonathan
[1:28:21] wants to give the Lord thanks for for
[1:28:25] the brothers and the people around him
[1:28:27] and where the Lord has brought him so
[1:28:29] far. Amen. I think we're all thankful

[1:55:54] Lord, plant my feet on higher

[1:56:07] stand.
[1:56:10] like earth on heaven.
[1:56:13] Heaven's table land
[1:56:18] a higher plane
[1:56:22] that I have found.
[1:56:26] Lord, plant my feet on higher
[1:56:30] ground.
[1:56:33] My heart has no
[1:56:37] desire to stay
[1:56:41] where doubts arise
[1:56:45] and fears.
[1:56:47] [Applause]
[1:56:50] So some may dwell

[1:58:20] flat, but I feel like it's still too
[1:58:21] high. So, we'll try A. So
[1:58:26] for everything that's good is made by
[1:58:30] the hands of God. He's the author of it
[1:58:34] all. Whether big or whether small, like
[1:58:39] the little baby laughing, or the gentle
[1:58:44] cool green, or the smell after the rain,
[1:58:49] it's all him.
[1:58:52] I see Jesus in each rainbow. I see Jesus
[1:58:58] in the clouds. I see Jesus in the
[1:59:02] sunlight and the moon and the stars. I
[1:59:07] see Jesus in the good times. I see Jesus
[1:59:12] in the bad. He is there no matter where
[1:59:17] we are.
[1:59:21] He's the same yesterday
[1:59:24] and today and tomorrow. You will find
[1:59:30] him in simplicity.
[1:59:32] You don't need to look far. He's in
[1:59:36] brotherly
[1:59:38] kindness. Peace and joy. He's in faith.
[1:59:43] Give a chance. You'll get a glance of
[1:59:47] him.
[1:59:50] I see Jesus in each rainbow. I see Jesus
[1:59:55] in the clouds. I see Jesus in the
[2:00:00] sunlight and the moon and the stars. I
[2:00:05] see Jesus in the good times. I see Jesus
[2:00:10] in the bad. He is there no matter where
[2:00:15] we are.
[2:00:19] And he was there on sunset mountain as a
[2:00:23] mighty whirlwind.
[2:00:26] He was in the burning bush, but it was
[2:00:32] not consumed. He was there as a pillar
[2:00:36] of fire. He was there as a pillar of
[2:00:40] cloud. He washed away all my sins.
[2:00:45] Praise. Let's take the last verse.
[2:00:48] He is knocking on the door to enter into
[2:00:54] your heart. If you let him in today, his
[2:01:00] presence won't depart. Simply ask him to
[2:01:05] reside and give him full control. He
[2:01:11] will never be the same
[2:01:14] again.
[2:01:18] I see Jesus in each rainbow. I see Jesus
[2:01:23] in the clouds. I see Jesus in the
[2:01:28] sunlight and the moon and the stars. I
[2:01:33] see Jesus in the good times. I see Jesus
[2:01:38] in the bad. He is there no matter where
[2:01:43] we are.
[2:01:47] I see Jesus in each rainbow. I see Jesus
[2:01:53] in the clouds. I see Jesus in the
[2:01:57] sunlight and the moon and the stars. I
[2:02:02] see Jesus in the good time. I see Jesus
[2:02:07] in the bad. He is there no matter where
[2:02:13] we are.
[2:02:17] Amen. The Lord gave me all those verses
[2:02:20] in like maybe four or five minutes and
[2:02:24] just I wrote all them down in the course
[2:02:26] and I was like, "Oh, thank you, Lord."
[2:02:28] And it's just been a blessing to me. So,
[2:02:31] Brother Edward, it's so good to see you.
[2:02:33] Could I pull on you to dismiss us with a
[2:02:35] word of prayer?
[2:02:38] [Music]
[2:02:48] God bless you. It's good to see each and
[2:02:50] everyone.
[2:02:52] Let's go to the Lord in prayer tonight.
[2:02:56] Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord,
[2:03:00] it's good to be in your house, Lord, and
[2:03:02] to worship you, feel your presence,
[2:03:04] Lord, and to
[2:03:06] Lord, to hear the word. Thank you for
[2:03:09] the name that you put above every other
[2:03:11] name, Lord. Lord, the authority in that
[2:03:15] name, the power in that name, Lord, the
[2:03:18] victory that you won through that name
[2:03:20] you gave to the church, Lord. And it's
[2:03:22] through that name,
[2:03:25] oh God. Thank you for a restoration,
[2:03:27] Lord. The truth to seal it, Lord, and to
[2:03:30] use it, oh God. We It would be no good
[2:03:34] to us if we didn't know how to use it,
[2:03:36] Lord. And you've instructed us and
[2:03:38] showed us the way, Lord.
[2:03:41] Grateful for that, Lord. Thank you for
[2:03:43] each one here, Lord. These prayer
[2:03:45] requests that have been brought before
[2:03:46] you tonight, Lord, through sincere
[2:03:49] hearts, Lord, sincere needs, Lord.
[2:03:54] God, you allow things into our lives,
[2:03:56] Lord, to draw us deeper into you, Lord,
[2:03:59] through need, Lord. Sometimes through
[2:04:01] sorrow, sometimes, Lord, through hard
[2:04:05] times, but it's for a deeper walk with
[2:04:08] you,
[2:04:09] Lord. We commit each and everyone into
[2:04:11] your hands tonight. Go with each one.
[2:04:14] Bless us, Lord. Keep us close to you,
[2:04:16] Lord. Keep our eyes on you. Raise us up,
[2:04:19] Lord. A step higher, Lord. A step closer
[2:04:22] to you, Lord. Let us be like Enoch and
[2:04:25] walk with you. And one day, Lord, Lord
[2:04:28] willing, we won't be found.
[2:04:31] Pray these things tonight in the name of
[2:04:33] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:04:38] [Music]
[2:04:40] Let's go to the key of E flat.
[2:04:48] [Music]
[2:04:50] As I travel through this pilgrim land,
[2:04:55] there is a friend who walks with me.
[2:05:00] [Music]
[2:05:02] Leads me safely through the sinking
[2:05:07] sand. It is the Christ of Calary
[2:05:12] [Applause]
[2:05:14] and this would be my prayer. Dear Lord,
[2:05:18] each day help me do the best I can.
[2:05:26] For I need thy light to guide me day and
[2:05:32] night. Blessed Jesus,
[2:05:35] hold my hand.
[2:05:40] Jesus,
[2:05:42] hold my hand.
[2:05:45] I need
[2:05:48] thee every hour.
[2:05:52] And through
[2:05:54] this filled man,
[2:05:58] protect me by thy saving power and hear
[2:06:07] my feeble feet.
[2:06:11] Oh Lord,
[2:06:13] look down on me.
[2:06:17] When I kneel in prayer, I know I'll meet
[2:06:22] you there. Blessed Jesus,
[2:06:26] hold my hand
[2:06:30] and let me travel in the light divine
[2:06:36] that I may see the blessed way.
[2:06:42] [Music]
[2:06:43] Keep me that I may be holy. Thine and
[2:06:49] sing redemption
[2:06:51] song someday.
[2:06:55] And I will be a soldier brave and true
[2:07:01] and ever firmly
[2:07:04] take a stand.
[2:07:08] As I onward go and daily meet the foe.
[2:07:14] Blessed Jesus
[2:07:17] hold my hand.
[2:07:21] Oh Jesus
[2:07:24] hold my hand.
[2:07:27] I need
[2:07:30] thee every hour.
[2:07:32] [Applause]
[2:07:34] And through
[2:07:36] this pilgrim land,
[2:07:40] protect me by thy saving
[2:07:45] power and hear
[2:07:49] my feeble fear.
[2:07:52] Oh Lord,
[2:07:55] look down on me.
[2:07:59] And I kneel in prayer. I know I'll meet
[2:08:04] you there. Blessed Jesus
[2:08:08] will my last verse.
[2:08:12] And when I wander through the valley
[2:08:18] toward the setting
[2:08:20] of the sun,
[2:08:25] lead me safely to a land of rest
[2:08:32] now of my w.
[2:08:38] I have put my faith in thee, dear Lord,
[2:08:43] that I may reach the golden strength.
[2:08:49] [Music]
[2:08:50] There's no other friend on whom I can
[2:08:55] depend. Blessed Jesus,
[2:08:59] hold my hand.
[2:09:03] Oh Jesus,
[2:09:06] hold my hand.
[2:09:09] I need
[2:09:12] every hour
[2:09:16] and through
[2:09:18] this film.
[2:09:22] Protect me by thy saving
[2:09:28] power and hear
[2:09:31] my people.
[2:09:35] Oh Lord,
[2:09:38] look down on me.
[2:09:41] When I kneel in prayer, I know I'll meet
[2:09:46] you there. I said, "Jesus,
[2:09:50] hold my hand." When I kneel in prayer,
[2:09:54] when I kneel in prayer, I know I'll meet
[2:09:59] you there. Blessed Jesus,
[2:10:03] hold my hand.
[2:10:08] Let's give him a praise offer.
[2:10:18] God bless you. You're dismissed.
[2:10:22] Jesus,
[2:10:25] hold my hand.
[2:10:28] I need
[2:10:30] thee every hour.
[2:10:34] And through
[2:10:36] this pilgrim,
[2:10:40] protect me by thy saving
[2:10:45] power and hear
[2:10:49] my feeble pain.
[2:10:53] Oh Lord,
[2:10:55] look down on me.
[2:10:59] When I kneel in prayer, I know I'll meet
[2:11:04] you there. Blessed Jesus,
[2:11:08] hold my hand.
