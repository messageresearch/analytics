[45:49] the beautiful crowd sometimes. So, God
[45:51] bless you. Welcome you to the house of
[45:53] the Lord. We have a friend of the
[45:57] ministry here, Brother Aaron Gara. He's
[45:59] a good brother to us. He's minister us
[46:02] to for us a number of times and we're so
[46:05] happy to have him with us. His wife's
[46:06] there in the back. God bless her. and um
[46:09] he is um one of us, Tucson, Arizona.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; And so we're uh happy to have him with
[46:19] us. This is his first time with us in
[46:21] this uh in this building or tabernacle.
[46:24] So we were testifying back there a
[46:26] little bit. So as he prepares, this
[46:29] wasn't planned. So I didn't announce it
[46:31] this morning because I didn't know. I
[46:34] had a little thought that I had been
[46:35] working on. And then of course there's a
[46:38] nice tape that I was thinking of and
[46:40] then I got this headache after lunch and
[46:44] I was going to push my way through it
[46:46] and then I got a text from brother Joe
[46:48] that some of the tabernacle folks
[46:51] um what are you all doing? Working on
[46:53] that thing
[46:55] keep working on it. Keep cancelling keep
[46:59] cancing services. So, I'm so glad uh I
[47:02] got one of my friends to come and help
[47:04] me sling the sword of the Lord.
[47:09] Amen. So, I get to hear some good
[47:11] preaching tonight. And so, let's stand
[47:13] to our feet and welcome our brother and
[47:15] we'll sing the old hymn of the church,
[47:16] Amazing Grace.
[47:22] Amen.

[49:30] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads and just
[49:32] continue playing that.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Lord, what more could we do but to give
[49:38] you all honor,
[49:40] &gt;&gt; all glory?
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Cuz me in my best, I could do nothing to
[49:47] get myself to heaven.
[49:49] But you knew that. and you said, "I'll
[49:52] go into his place
[49:54] and I'll take all his sin. I'll take all
[49:56] his iniquity. I'll take all his wrong
[49:58] and I will bear it to Calvary and I'll
[50:01] give my life for him." And we just want
[50:04] to tell you, you're worthy of all honor,
[50:07] all glory, and all praise, Lord. Thank
[50:10] you for your goodness, Lord, in Jesus
[50:12] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. You may be
[50:16] seated.
[50:18] [Music]
[50:19] Show
[50:21] I knew about maybe an hour ago that we
[50:24] would be ministering, but we had
[50:26] intended to come
[50:29] and um
[50:31] kind of uh pretty well all my friends
[50:33] here.
[50:35] I hope they're all my friends.
[50:38] Thank you. I've always appreciated your
[50:40] pastor, brother Israel. I've always
[50:43] appreciated his spirit, his and as we've
[50:47] aged a little bit. He's still chasing
[50:50] me. But
[50:52] you grow, you learn.
[50:54] If you're not learning, uh, that's not a
[50:56] good thing. So,
[50:59] but, uh, something that I ministered
[51:01] here recently, I'm
[51:04] I love to be able to help someone. Can I
[51:07] give you something that will help you?
[51:10] Um, you know, I just recently retired.
[51:15] Uh, just shy of 50 years of work and
[51:19] probably forgot more than I learned.
[51:22] But there are some things you can still
[51:23] reach out and help somebody with,
[51:26] you know, experiences you've gone in
[51:28] life. And that's what the what the
[51:31] elders are here for, to encourage the
[51:33] younger ones
[51:35] &gt;&gt; to say, "You can make it. You can do it.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; It's doable. I'm here by the grace of
[51:39] God, by his mercy. So,
[51:43] the thought is something I heard and and
[51:46] I'll read it to you. I read and heard
[51:48] and and you guys stay up on the
[51:52] don't they don't let you sit down?
[51:54] Well, is it okay if they
[51:58] you may go and sit? I'm not going to
[51:59] sing no more. Not when you have brother
[52:02] John and some good singers here. No, I
[52:04] don't.
[52:06] But um
[52:08] just something I read and it starts a
[52:10] thought if if you've ministered before.
[52:13] Um sometimes it's just something you
[52:15] read. See
[52:17] &gt;&gt; and it starts out brother Brandham is
[52:18] walking and there's a a cigarette
[52:21] package there.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Most of us would have gone a long ways
[52:25] around it
[52:26] &gt;&gt; so that nobody would even think in any
[52:28] way that we had any association with
[52:30] that. But it caught his attention, picks
[52:33] it up and he read a thinking man's
[52:36] filter comes out from that sermon, from
[52:39] that thing. And you and I would never
[52:41] look at something like that. So
[52:43] sometimes God talks to you in a way that
[52:46] you wouldn't expect,
[52:49] &gt;&gt; but you just you learn to know how he
[52:52] talks to you. You know, I have six
[52:54] daughters and they were all at times
[52:57] treated as a group of six daughters,
[53:00] but they were also individually spoken
[53:03] to. My oldest one being 10 years older
[53:07] than her youngest sister. There was a
[53:09] time that she was
[53:11] uh she was a teenager before her
[53:13] youngest sister. So, her youngest sister
[53:14] didn't get to do what she did because
[53:17] she hadn't got there. But then her
[53:18] younger sister got to that age and she
[53:20] got included.
[53:21] As you grow in Christ, there are things
[53:23] that God does with you because you've
[53:25] matured in Christ.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; You've grown in Christ and he's willing
[53:29] to share more with you,
[53:32] &gt;&gt; you know, and so,
[53:35] but
[53:37] those of us that have have gone, we've
[53:38] learned, we've made more mistakes than
[53:41] you have because we've lived longer.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; But we've also learned more because we
[53:45] made more mistakes.
[53:47] And sometimes God has to reach just like
[53:49] a father or a mother has to get your
[53:50] attention and say that's not right.
[53:53] That's not good. And I'm glad he does.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; I would like I want to get there on that
[53:58] day and find out that I made so many
[54:00] mistakes I can't go in.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; But he he said look and then I was able
[54:05] to repent.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; And then when the slate and when it's
[54:09] open it doesn't there's no nothing
[54:11] wrong. He said there's nothing. It's all
[54:12] covered by the blood
[54:14] &gt;&gt; and every one of us is welcome. And we
[54:16] must come to a place in our lives that
[54:18] there's no one that we would put
[54:20] outside.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; No one. Because I didn't do anything to
[54:25] deserve it, but the the the the amazing
[54:28] grace of God. So, just like to read you
[54:30] this, and this is what brought the
[54:33] thought. It's you're holding a cup of
[54:36] coffee when someone comes along and
[54:38] bumps you or shakes your arm, making you
[54:42] spill the coffee everywhere.
[54:45] So why did you spill the coffee?
[54:49] Well, cuz somebody bumped me. I mean, he
[54:53] says, "No, because you had coffee in
[54:55] your cup.
[54:57] If you didn't have anything in your cup
[54:59] when they bumped you, you wouldn't have
[55:00] spilled anything."
[55:03] So that started what comes out of me
[55:06] when I get bumped, when I trip, when I
[55:09] make a mistake. What what comes out of
[55:12] me is what's inside of me. You spill
[55:15] coffee because there was coffee in your
[55:17] cup. Had there been tea in the cup, you
[55:19] would have spilled tea. Whatever is
[55:21] inside the cup is what spills out.
[55:25] Therefore, when life comes along and
[55:26] shakes you, which it will happen,
[55:30] &gt;&gt; if you lived a little bit of time,
[55:32] you've been shook. You've been troubled.
[55:36] Whatever is inside you will come out.
[55:39] It's easy to fake it until you get
[55:42] rattled.
[55:45] I don't know about you, but I there's
[55:47] this mirror in our bathroom, and I don't
[55:50] like that guy in there.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; And my wife comes in, she says, "I put
[55:55] it up because it's beautiful. How come
[55:58] when I stand in front of it, it doesn't
[56:00] look like that?"
[56:02] Sometimes when we compare ourselves to
[56:04] somebody else,
[56:06] &gt;&gt; oh, look at they're good Christians.
[56:07] They're wonderful Christians. They've
[56:09] got it made
[56:11] &gt;&gt; and they're looking at you. You're a
[56:12] wonderful Christian. You've got it made.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; But it's when you look in the mirror
[56:16] &gt;&gt; that's when you have to look at
[56:18] yourself.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; We have to ask ourselves then, what's in
[56:22] my cup? When life gets tough, what
[56:26] spills out? Joy, gratitude, peace,
[56:31] humility,
[56:33] or anger, bitterness, victim mentality,
[56:37] and quitting tendencies.
[56:40] This is the 10th time I've done this
[56:42] week. I give up.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "Father, forgive them. They
[56:48] don't know what they're doing."
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:54] Life provides a cup. You choose how to
[56:56] fill it.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; You make the choice. What is going in my
[57:00] cup? Today, let's work toward filling
[57:03] our cups with gratitude, forgiveness,
[57:05] joy, words of affirmation, resolence,
[57:08] positivity, and kindness, gentleness,
[57:11] and love for others.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; If God so loved the world that he gave
[57:17] his only begotten son,
[57:20] &gt;&gt; while we were yet sinners,
[57:23] &gt;&gt; he said, "I'll go and I'll die for
[57:25] them."
[57:27] &gt;&gt; How could you not love a God like that?
[57:31] You know, brother Brandham, and let me
[57:33] let me get this quote here
[57:37] in the message,
[57:42] go tell my disciples in 53. He says, I
[57:44] used to say about speaking down here
[57:46] about the old spring I used to drink
[57:49] from. It was bubbling and jumping and
[57:51] jumping and jumping down around Miltown.
[57:55] I used to wonder why that spring jumped.
[57:57] So one day I sat down and I was talking
[57:59] to it. Imagine a man talking to a
[58:02] spring.
[58:04] Yeah, we we we talk a lot all the time
[58:06] just going down the road saying, "No, I
[58:08] shouldn't have done that. I shouldn't
[58:09] have done this." You know, he said, "Can
[58:11] you imagine?" But I was talking to
[58:12] nature who made the spring and I
[58:14] wondered what makes you so bubbly, so
[58:17] jumpy. Is it because that the children
[58:20] come here and drink from you or I drink
[58:22] from you or something? Then he says
[58:24] this. If the spring could have spoke
[58:26] back, he would have said, "No, Billy. It
[58:27] isn't because you drink from it. It
[58:29] isn't because anybody drinks from me.
[58:32] It's something down beneath me here
[58:35] pushing me and making me bubble and jump
[58:38] and carry on like this."
[58:41] &gt;&gt; So when it comes bubbling up and
[58:43] something you don't like comes out,
[58:46] that's God's mercy saying, "Hey, we need
[58:48] to work on something."
[58:50] Because if everything looks good and you
[58:52] think it's every right, but you get
[58:53] there on that day and then all a sudden
[58:55] it says you knock on the door and say,
[58:57] "I don't know you.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; I've never had to work with you. I never
[59:01] had to deal with you. I
[59:02] &gt;&gt; But Lord, every day, let us say, Lord,
[59:05] search me, oh God.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Look at my heart. Look at my attitude."
[59:09] And and help me to be willing to say,
[59:10] "I'm sorry."
[59:12] &gt;&gt; It's hard for human for human just to
[59:15] say, "I'm sorry. I was at fault."
[59:18] and and he took
[59:22] all my fault
[59:23] &gt;&gt; when he was not guilty.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Let's see. There was there was I don't
[59:29] know if I brought the other was another
[59:30] one, but it was kind of the same thing.
[59:36] So I I look at it this way and we go to
[59:40] um
[59:43] in in Acts
[59:45] and I put these in order and then I
[59:47] scrambled them.
[59:49] So,
[59:51] oh, here's the other one I was looking
[59:52] for. And it's similar,
[59:56] but it's he goes, "At a high school
[59:58] reunion, a group of successful alumni,
[1:00:02] now doctors, lawyers, business owners.
[1:00:05] I've been in the message for 20 years,
[1:00:07] 30 years, 40 years, 50 years. I've got
[1:00:09] my degrees in the message. I've
[1:00:11] learned."
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; No, we don't do that, do we?
[1:00:16] just when we're awake
[1:00:19] decided to visit their favorite teacher
[1:00:21] and they chatted about their careers and
[1:00:24] families. But soon the conversation
[1:00:26] shifted to life's pressure, stress,
[1:00:29] constant chasing after more.
[1:00:33] We to wonder sometimes why we're tired.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; You know, in God there's rest
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; and everything else is a struggle,
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; but sometimes we'll struggle for it.
[1:00:46] After listening a while, the teacher
[1:00:48] smiled and said, "Hold on a minute. I'll
[1:00:50] go make us some coffee." He came back
[1:00:53] with a large pot and a tray full of
[1:00:55] cups, and none of them matching. Some of
[1:00:58] them fine porcelain, others were plain
[1:00:59] ceramic, a few were chipped glass mugs,
[1:01:03] and one even looked like it came from a
[1:01:05] old diner.
[1:01:07] Everyone reached for a cup. The
[1:01:09] professor watched in silence. Once they
[1:01:11] all had coffee in hand, he said, "Notice
[1:01:14] just what happened. Most of you
[1:01:16] instinctively reach reach for the nicest
[1:01:18] cups." Leaving behind the simpler ones.
[1:01:21] It's normal to want the best for
[1:01:23] ourselves, but that's often where the
[1:01:26] stress begins.
[1:01:29] He gestured toward the cups. The cup
[1:01:32] doesn't make coffee taste any better.
[1:01:36] What you really wanted was the coffee,
[1:01:38] but you were still focused on the cup.
[1:01:42] And that's one reason why we ask Christ
[1:01:45] to clean us, to wash us
[1:01:48] so we don't give a wrong testimony.
[1:01:52] But we are not leading someone to
[1:01:53] ourselves.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; We are leading them to Christ. That
[1:01:58] that's what we're trying to do. Life is
[1:02:00] a copy. Coffee. Your job, your house,
[1:02:03] your income, your status. All those
[1:02:06] things are just cups. They help contain
[1:02:08] life, but they don't define it. And the
[1:02:11] trouble is the more we focus on the cup,
[1:02:13] the more we miss out on the coffee.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Lord, I would have got a good good
[1:02:18] blessing today if I hadn't made a
[1:02:20] mistake today. Because that's all that
[1:02:22] was on my mind during church. I messed
[1:02:25] up today. I messed up today. I messed up
[1:02:27] today. or brother so and so is here in
[1:02:30] church and I know he's got a problem and
[1:02:33] that's all you got at the church
[1:02:34] service.
[1:02:36] If God would allow us to see what he
[1:02:38] sees when he looks sometimes I think we
[1:02:41] would all be embarrassed at times.
[1:02:45] He says remember happy people don't
[1:02:47] always have the best of everything
[1:02:50] but they know how to make the best of
[1:02:51] what they have. Amen.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; You know, my car is not brand new, but
[1:02:57] it got me here. Didn't have to push it
[1:02:59] either,
[1:03:01] but some days you do have to push the
[1:03:03] car, and you tell thank God for that,
[1:03:06] you know.
[1:03:11] So
[1:03:14] there's so many things you could say,
[1:03:16] but just just to forgive is to liberate
[1:03:20] a prisoner
[1:03:22] and to discover that the prisoner was
[1:03:24] you.
[1:03:27] You were bound by what you were going
[1:03:29] through
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; while you're looking at others and
[1:03:33] judging them by what you're going
[1:03:34] through.
[1:03:36] But the prisoner is you.
[1:03:39] And until you realize, you have to reach
[1:03:41] out and say, "God, have mercy on me. Let
[1:03:44] my light shine. Let Christ be the one
[1:03:47] that has seen in me."
[1:03:50] Okay. So, what will you do with the
[1:03:52] issues, the struggles, the problems, the
[1:03:55] temptations that come your way? And
[1:03:57] everyone has temptations.
[1:04:01] And maybe what's your temptation is not
[1:04:03] my temptation. And I look at you and
[1:04:05] say,"Wh are you struggling with that?"
[1:04:07] And you're looking at me and saying,
[1:04:08] "Why are you struggling with that?" But
[1:04:10] that's how we help one another.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; You know, I sometimes I think back of as
[1:04:16] raising our our daughters, you know,
[1:04:18] some of the things we did and we wish we
[1:04:20] could do them over. We had not done them
[1:04:22] that way. We had done this. I I we were
[1:04:26] just moving into where we live now and
[1:04:30] um I needed a tool and we had just met
[1:04:33] the neighbors and they had three
[1:04:34] daughters and somebody across there were
[1:04:36] so many kids in our yard all the time.
[1:04:38] Everybody came to play in our yard and
[1:04:41] um which was okay. I'd rather have them
[1:04:43] in my yard than maybe my kids in their
[1:04:46] yard. I don't know what's going on over
[1:04:48] there. But I wanted to know if the
[1:04:50] neighbor had a rake I could borrow. So I
[1:04:52] sent one of my daughters. can you go
[1:04:54] over there with the neighbors because
[1:04:55] you know the kids there and she turned
[1:04:57] around and sent her little sister
[1:05:01] and that's what brothers and sisters do
[1:05:03] to each other. Okay. Well, my younger
[1:05:06] daughter ran out right in front of a
[1:05:08] car. She didn't look. Fortunately, the
[1:05:10] car was going slow enough it hit its
[1:05:12] brakes and stopped. There was nothing
[1:05:15] happened. But my oldest daughter got in
[1:05:18] a lot of trouble for that.
[1:05:21] Daddy was mad so he took it on the the
[1:05:23] eldest daughter when really dad should
[1:05:26] have gone across the street and God
[1:05:28] asked first place.
[1:05:31] Okay, we got to we just got to be
[1:05:34] careful. Just got to stop for a minute
[1:05:36] and look at at this. Yeah.
[1:05:39] So So you find out you are the prisoner,
[1:05:42] the one that needed to be set free. What
[1:05:45] will you do with the issues, struggles,
[1:05:47] problems, temptations that come your
[1:05:49] way? And they will.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Is there anybody here that doesn't have
[1:05:55] to struggle with problems sometime? Man,
[1:05:58] you're excused. You can go home now.
[1:06:01] You've passed the test already. But no,
[1:06:04] it's a daily thing.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; We are being observed by those around us
[1:06:09] at home, at work, at church, at school,
[1:06:13] and when we're out and about.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:17] and our sisters and I appreciate that
[1:06:19] the way they dress and they go out and I
[1:06:22] appreciate that they do it because they
[1:06:23] want to.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Okay. When you're forced to, that's a
[1:06:26] different because when you're forced to,
[1:06:27] the attitude comes out. I'm wearing this
[1:06:30] but not because I want to. I have to.
[1:06:33] But when when you're a sister and even
[1:06:35] the brothers dressing like gentlemen and
[1:06:37] all, when it's part of you, it's part of
[1:06:39] you, you know, and and that's a good
[1:06:42] thing.
[1:06:43] So again, when we're out and about,
[1:06:45] there are people looking at us. And
[1:06:48] what's in your cup is going to be made
[1:06:50] known.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; And for we know it's Christ in us,
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; the hope of glory
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; for me and maybe my neighbor and the
[1:06:59] stranger that I meet. How do I know
[1:07:01] that's not a child of God?
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Everyone should be looking at someone.
[1:07:06] Everyone is they could possibly be a
[1:07:08] child of God. I should offer them what I
[1:07:11] have.
[1:07:14] That's where Peter says in
[1:07:18] let me get that scripture real quick
[1:07:19] here. Acts chapter 3
[1:07:25] verses 3-6. They had just come out from
[1:07:28] that experience
[1:07:30] up up in in the day of Pentecost where
[1:07:33] it's Christ in us now the hope of glory.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; All that God had wanted to do. It wasn't
[1:07:39] just to bring Jesus Christ and have him.
[1:07:41] If I could say it this, it was paraded
[1:07:43] in front of everybody to see how great
[1:07:45] God is, but rather God wanting to be
[1:07:47] with his family.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; He would come every day to visit with
[1:07:52] Adam and Eve.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; And do you think he didn't know what
[1:07:56] happened on that day?
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; He still came down and said, "Adam,
[1:08:01] Adam, Adam."
[1:08:04] As he knew exactly what had happened,
[1:08:07] but he still went calling them. He
[1:08:09] didn't turn his back on them.
[1:08:11] Because inside of him was a redeemer,
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; was a savior.
[1:08:17] Everything that God was was going to
[1:08:19] come out of that cup.
[1:08:22] And the same thing in you, everything in
[1:08:24] you is going to come out of that cup.
[1:08:26] Peter says, and we know we he's coming
[1:08:29] out. They've come they've received the
[1:08:31] Holy Ghost. They're going and they're
[1:08:32] they didn't stop going to church. They
[1:08:34] were on their way to church service that
[1:08:36] morning. It says who serving Peter and
[1:08:38] John about to go into the temple asked
[1:08:40] of alms
[1:08:43] and Peter fastening his eyes upon him
[1:08:45] with John said look on us and it says he
[1:08:49] gave them heed expecting to receive
[1:08:52] something of them. Now you and I when we
[1:08:55] interpret that we say he was expecting
[1:08:57] some money something to help. But look,
[1:09:01] there are people walking down on this
[1:09:03] earth right now that need something
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; that you have.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; And when they look to you and they say,
[1:09:10] "Do you have a dollar?" Maybe that's not
[1:09:12] what they're really wanting.
[1:09:14] They're wanting some hope. They're
[1:09:17] wanting something in their heart and
[1:09:19] they're seeing something you being
[1:09:20] reflected out of you. And you go like
[1:09:23] this
[1:09:25] and they get disappointed. Sure, there
[1:09:28] are those that just want money. I
[1:09:30] understand that but that which is in you
[1:09:33] is going to come out.
[1:09:35] So he gave heed expecting something of
[1:09:38] them. Then Peter had said silver and
[1:09:41] gold have I none. Just because I'm a
[1:09:44] Christian and I believe this message
[1:09:46] didn't make me rich didn't give me
[1:09:48] money. But that's not what it's for.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; God said I'll be with you even in you
[1:09:53] until the end of the world and I will
[1:09:55] meet your needs.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; And we just trust him that.
[1:10:00] Now, sometimes we try to tell them how
[1:10:01] to do it. I don't think any of your boy,
[1:10:04] your son or your daughters ever tried to
[1:10:06] tell you how to manage your money as
[1:10:09] long as you gave them some.
[1:10:13] It was uh
[1:10:15] going back a few years now and
[1:10:19] um a quarter bought a lot. This was in
[1:10:22] the 60s when I was a kid. You could go
[1:10:25] to the store and get three big candy
[1:10:27] bars and five little candy bars for 25
[1:10:30] cents. And that was for good for about a
[1:10:32] whole hour maybe.
[1:10:36] You know, today a quarter you'll walk by
[1:10:39] it, not even pick it up anymore. But you
[1:10:42] know the value of what you place on
[1:10:44] something,
[1:10:46] is it worth eternal life?
[1:10:48] Then you'll give your all for it. Peter
[1:10:50] says, "Silver and gold have I none, but
[1:10:53] such as I have."
[1:10:56] Peter could not have given it if Peter
[1:10:58] didn't have it.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; It's not my job to run to your pastor or
[1:11:03] your job to go to your pastor to give to
[1:11:05] somebody you. It's his to give it to let
[1:11:09] you know that you can have it
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; that it can be part of your life.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:15] It's not based on on brother Israel
[1:11:18] building a big congregation so they no
[1:11:20] if his heart is right. He is desirous
[1:11:22] for you to get to know this God
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; that it's personal with you
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; that if you're by yourself it's no
[1:11:30] different than you being with the whole
[1:11:31] congregation.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Remember they came up to him and said
[1:11:36] this whole group of people is hungry.
[1:11:39] And Jesus said, "You know,
[1:11:42] ah, go down to that warehouse. They have
[1:11:44] 6,000 fish in there. Go over." No. He
[1:11:47] said, "What do you got?"
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; I got three fish and I got this. He go,
[1:11:50] "Wow, way more than enough."
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; And he just began to give out what was
[1:11:58] in him.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Excuse me, brother. I've got to go pray
[1:12:01] for an hour before I can help you. No,
[1:12:04] we should be at a place where we can
[1:12:06] give.
[1:12:07] where we can give.
[1:12:10] Such as I have, I give thee in the name
[1:12:14] of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Rise up and
[1:12:16] walk. Wow. I never realized it had
[1:12:19] Christ in him till I just read that
[1:12:21] scripture. Read the Bible. You'll find
[1:12:25] so many things that God is telling you.
[1:12:28] I asked him one day because when my
[1:12:32] daughters were were growing up and
[1:12:34] getting their cars and getting insurance
[1:12:36] and all and um I called the insurance
[1:12:39] agent and I said uh cuz they girls got a
[1:12:42] car when they could afford it and we
[1:12:44] couldn't buy insurance because when you
[1:12:45] have six daughters, you can't afford six
[1:12:47] daughters that way.
[1:12:49] But I called him up and um I talked to
[1:12:52] him a bit. I said, "How are my girls on
[1:12:54] the insurance on their cars?" I think
[1:12:56] three of the girls were had their own
[1:12:58] cars then. And this were his words. He
[1:13:00] said, "Aaron, if all the parents were
[1:13:03] like you, we wouldn't have the problems
[1:13:06] we have."
[1:13:09] Wow. What do you mean? He said, "You've
[1:13:12] brought your daughters up, right? They
[1:13:14] come and they pay for their insurance or
[1:13:16] they send it to me and if they're going
[1:13:17] to be a day late, they know. They let me
[1:13:20] know." And he goes,"I have a lot of
[1:13:23] parents that come in and pay the
[1:13:25] insurance for them because the kids
[1:13:27] won't do it."
[1:13:29] And I thought to myself,"Wonderful.
[1:13:32] I can drive down the road a lot happier
[1:13:34] and a lot more peace that way." But as I
[1:13:37] was driving the road after that heading
[1:13:39] on to work, it just came to me. I Lord,
[1:13:42] I said, "But what about my daughters? Is
[1:13:44] there a a insurance between them and
[1:13:46] you?"
[1:13:49] Man, he took me right to the scripture
[1:13:52] where Job laid a sacrifice every morning
[1:13:54] in case his children had sinned.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; I don't know if God ever opens the Bible
[1:13:59] to you like that, but he does for me
[1:14:00] sometimes. He'll just say, "There it
[1:14:01] is." I just said, and he goes, "And just
[1:14:05] as Job did it, I will honor your prayers
[1:14:08] for your daughters."
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; I was one happy I stayed on the road
[1:14:12] honest.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; I was one happy dad. I mean, I was
[1:14:15] rejoicing.
[1:14:17] So, just a few days after that, I'm I'm
[1:14:20] reading through a message and brother
[1:14:22] Brandham and and you know, sometimes if
[1:14:24] I'm I'm looking for something, maybe
[1:14:26] brother Bam said organ and I'm going
[1:14:28] through it and I I went up five four or
[1:14:30] five paragraphs and and started reading
[1:14:32] down and he says like any good father
[1:14:37] would do. He said just like Job's father
[1:14:40] laid a sacrifice every morning. I said,
[1:14:43] "Man, double confirmation. What more do
[1:14:45] I want?"
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; you still worry about him.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; You're still troubled about him. You
[1:14:53] know, but I have a God and he's the same
[1:14:56] God you have.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; They can watch over them all.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Every once in a while, they would come
[1:14:59] home and say, "Dad, can I talk to you?"
[1:15:02] You remember the other day, um, I got a
[1:15:05] little upset with you and I said this
[1:15:07] and this. It was one of my daughters and
[1:15:08] I said, "Yeah." She said, "I just want
[1:15:11] to tell you I'm sorry
[1:15:13] cuz I I said this and this. It wasn't
[1:15:15] mean, but she just she was one of the
[1:15:16] younger ones. She wanted to do what her
[1:15:18] older sisters could do." And you know,
[1:15:20] and I let her and she says, "Uh, you
[1:15:23] know, when I did this and I was driving,
[1:15:25] well, I got pulled over by a policeman
[1:15:27] and I got a ticket
[1:15:29] and I'm sorry. I did I didn't respect
[1:15:32] you as my father."
[1:15:35] He goes, "I know that that's why I got
[1:15:36] stopped because of the attitude I had
[1:15:38] towards you. I wanted to get the same
[1:15:40] privileges of my older sisters.
[1:15:44] You know how happy that makes a father
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; and you just thank you Lord because you
[1:15:50] did it. I didn't do it.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; It wasn't forced on him. That's what
[1:15:55] Peter said. Such as I have I give unto
[1:15:58] you. He didn't turn around and say,
[1:16:00] "Hey, James, you got any extra? You got
[1:16:01] any you got any cash in your pocket?"
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; No, he said, "Such as I have.
[1:16:09] Now watch this.
[1:16:11] In Luke 8:37-39,
[1:16:15] we know this was the man that Jesus had
[1:16:17] come up and found him, that the
[1:16:18] demon-possessed man.
[1:16:22] Then the whole multitude of the country
[1:16:24] of the gatherings around besought him to
[1:16:27] depart from them, for they were taken
[1:16:29] with great fear and went into the ship,
[1:16:31] and returned and looked back in. Now the
[1:16:34] man of whom the devils had departed
[1:16:37] besought him that he might be with him.
[1:16:40] But Jesus sent him away, saying, I like
[1:16:43] this part, return to thine own house,
[1:16:46] and show thee how great things God has
[1:16:49] done unto thee. And he went his way,
[1:16:52] published throughout the whole city how
[1:16:55] great things Jesus had done unto him.
[1:17:00] Because now in his cup
[1:17:03] that could be given out or spilled was
[1:17:05] the joy of the Lord.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; He had had been received redemption. He
[1:17:10] had received healing. He had received so
[1:17:12] much he said such as I have now I can
[1:17:14] give.
[1:17:19] And and so again here is what's in your
[1:17:23] cup
[1:17:25] because that's what's going to come out.
[1:17:27] Okay. If we look at Psalms 16:2,
[1:17:33] "Oh my soul, thou hast said unto the
[1:17:35] Lord, thou art my Lord. My goodness
[1:17:39] extendeth not to thee." Or, "Oh my soul,
[1:17:42] you have said to the Lord, you are my
[1:17:44] Lord, I have no good but you."
[1:17:50] in my best efforts in all that I do. And
[1:17:52] we should give our best efforts and do
[1:17:54] everything as good as we can.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; But that will never save you.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; It's the grace of God.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; The goodness of God. And we have to
[1:18:03] understand it's the goodness of God that
[1:18:06] we are where we are.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; And I don't know that I would have
[1:18:10] chosen me if I was God. But that's why
[1:18:12] I'm not God.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Because he's perfect.
[1:18:16] because he's perfect.
[1:18:21] Proverbs 18:4
[1:18:24] and I'll read the the
[1:18:27] I I used a couple of different word.
[1:18:30] Wise words are like deep water. Wisdom
[1:18:32] flows from the wise like a bubbling
[1:18:35] brook.
[1:18:37] What's coming out? What's coming? What
[1:18:39] is wisdom? Because you're smarter than
[1:18:41] everybody else. To me, wisdom is
[1:18:44] learning from your experience.
[1:18:46] and being able to apply it and give it
[1:18:48] to somebody else.
[1:18:50] Not because I read it in the book. I
[1:18:52] know more scriptures than you. I No, no.
[1:18:55] My life shows that I have experienced
[1:18:57] what God has said. And that's what's
[1:18:59] coming out. Grace, grace, God's grace.
[1:19:03] Amazing grace. How sweet the sound. And
[1:19:07] And if it's the grace of God, shouldn't
[1:19:09] we be giving the grace to someone else?
[1:19:12] Because sometimes uh God has been
[1:19:16] merciful to us. He's brought us up in a
[1:19:18] way. He's we've had some hard times and
[1:19:21] he's been merciful. And you know, you
[1:19:23] didn't deserve that,
[1:19:25] but he did it for you anyways.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Okay? And then you should then turn
[1:19:31] around, there's mercy in my cup. There's
[1:19:34] grace in my cup. There's love in my cup.
[1:19:38] You know, so he says
[1:19:42] then Psalms 30 uh verse 5, for his anger
[1:19:46] endureth but a moment in his favor is
[1:19:50] life. Weeping may endure for a night,
[1:19:54] but joy cometh in the morning.
[1:19:58] Sometimes a night is long, sometimes a
[1:20:00] night is hard. sometimes the fact that
[1:20:03] you had to pay or bear what you went
[1:20:07] through
[1:20:08] but it's a lesson learned and that
[1:20:11] morning will come
[1:20:13] you know I worked um 20ome years in
[1:20:18] working in cabinetry and countertops
[1:20:22] and uh they were there was a young man
[1:20:24] that they brought in and they asked me
[1:20:26] to began to train him and he was like 18
[1:20:29] 19 years old and so I asked him I said
[1:20:32] uh um I just want to know what
[1:20:33] experience he had. And I said, "What
[1:20:36] experience do you have with in
[1:20:37] countertop cabinet or anything like
[1:20:39] that?" And he said, "Well, my grandpa
[1:20:41] owned a cabinet shop and my dad worked
[1:20:43] with him all the time." I said, "Well,
[1:20:45] good. What did you do?" Well, you know,
[1:20:47] my grandpa used to build this and my dad
[1:20:49] used to help him and he just kept going
[1:20:51] down the line. Well, that's not what I
[1:20:54] want to know. I want to know what you
[1:20:55] did. So, then I realized what he was
[1:20:58] afraid I was going to say. Well, you
[1:21:00] have no experience. I can't use you.
[1:21:03] And I remembered when I was a kid and
[1:21:05] just dad used to take us out was part of
[1:21:08] the LA airport was Ontario
[1:21:10] International. My dad would take me and
[1:21:12] my younger brother and we'd sit over one
[1:21:13] side to buy us an ice cream cone and
[1:21:15] we'd watch the National Guard jets
[1:21:17] taking off and uh ice cream cones were
[1:21:20] 10 cents back then. So it didn't cost
[1:21:21] dad a whole lot, but it was neat. We
[1:21:24] would go over to the airport to see
[1:21:25] that. It was close by. I moved to
[1:21:27] Tucson. I uh I got my first uh camera
[1:21:31] and I used to go out and take pictures.
[1:21:32] I worked at the airport. I even cleaned
[1:21:34] the owner's lair jet one time and I sat
[1:21:37] inside and took a picture of it. And I'm
[1:21:39] telling them all this. I said, "I think
[1:21:41] I can fly. You want to go flying with me
[1:21:43] this weekend?
[1:21:46] I've been all around them. I've cleaned
[1:21:47] them. I've actually sat inside of them."
[1:21:50] And finally goes, "I've never done this
[1:21:52] before." I said, "Thank you. Now I know
[1:21:54] where to start you.
[1:21:57] just being honest. What's in your cup?
[1:22:00] You don't have that training, but that
[1:22:01] training can come
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; if we'll be willing to do that.
[1:22:07] And then I I unto Timothy, Paul says,
[1:22:10] Timothy says this in in 1 Timothy 4
[1:22:13] 4:12, he said, "Let no man despise thy
[1:22:16] youth
[1:22:18] or or somebody new in the gospel." Now,
[1:22:22] I I took the liberty to interpret it
[1:22:24] that way. Somebody new. Somebody don't
[1:22:26] have the experience that you have, don't
[1:22:28] have the time that you have, uh, fallen
[1:22:30] down and got up as many times as you
[1:22:32] have and you've learned from the from
[1:22:34] that. He's telling you, "But be thou an
[1:22:37] example to the believers in word, in
[1:22:40] conversation, in charity, in spirit, in
[1:22:42] faith and in purity, in conversation."
[1:22:46] Not how you talk, but how you live.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; That's when the word conversation is
[1:22:50] used in the Bible. Muslim is talking
[1:22:52] about how you live, how your actions
[1:22:54] are, because that speaks louder than
[1:22:57] words a lot of times. I look like a
[1:23:00] Christian, but I don't act like a
[1:23:01] Christian.
[1:23:03] And I'd rather be acting like a
[1:23:05] Christian and getting accused of being a
[1:23:07] Christian that way than dressing like a
[1:23:09] Christian and saying, "No, he's not a
[1:23:12] Christian."
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Because it's not really about me. I I
[1:23:15] really make my father look bad.
[1:23:18] You're the son of Oh, what does that say
[1:23:21] about your dad?
[1:23:23] We got to be careful with that.
[1:23:27] And again, another way they said, "Let
[1:23:29] no man make little of you because you
[1:23:31] are young,
[1:23:33] but be an example to the church in word
[1:23:35] and behavior and love and faith and in
[1:23:38] holy living." When I say young, not
[1:23:40] necessarily an age, but also a newcomer.
[1:23:46] If if somebody comes in and and they're
[1:23:49] made to sit in the back seat and said,
[1:23:51] "Until you're as good at us, you can't
[1:23:53] participate."
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; No. They don't have a first string,
[1:23:57] second string, third string. And they do
[1:23:59] in football, but not in Christianity.
[1:24:02] You're my brother, you're my sister.
[1:24:04] We're all part of the family of God.
[1:24:08] Ephesians 6:4.
[1:24:11] Now this just just some thoughts because
[1:24:13] we're talking about about coming into a
[1:24:16] place of what's in our cup. Okay.
[1:24:20] He says, "Fathers, do not provoke your
[1:24:22] children to anger by the way you treat
[1:24:24] them." No. Rather bring them up in the
[1:24:28] discipline and instruction that comes
[1:24:30] from the Lord.
[1:24:33] And sometimes I find myself acting like
[1:24:36] my father, getting angry and spanking.
[1:24:42] And um we all done that I'm sure
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; in our anger in our in our and a moment
[1:24:47] of but I found out if I was angry enough
[1:24:50] and you my wife's not here but she she
[1:24:52] was I got angry over something I would
[1:24:56] if I wasn't dressed to go outside to
[1:24:58] have my tennis shoes. I took my and I
[1:24:59] went for a long walk and I burned out
[1:25:03] all that frustration.
[1:25:05] Sometimes it wasn't that long. Sometimes
[1:25:07] it was a long walk. Sometimes it was
[1:25:09] from here in New Mexico and back. No,
[1:25:10] not that far. But just went out until I
[1:25:13] no longer was frustrated because now I
[1:25:17] could handle the situation in a calm
[1:25:19] manner.
[1:25:21] because if I would have handled it and
[1:25:23] you can ask one of my daughters, I took
[1:25:24] her by the head one time for a second
[1:25:26] and realized what I was doing. And I ran
[1:25:28] out the door crying that I had reacted
[1:25:30] that way.
[1:25:32] So after that, I learned just go away
[1:25:34] for a little while. They're going to be
[1:25:36] in the room terrorized and dad's coming
[1:25:38] to to But then they learn, oh, when dad
[1:25:41] comes back, he's going to talk to us.
[1:25:43] He's going to make it easier on us.
[1:25:45] We're not going to die through this
[1:25:46] situation.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Because I had to learn that myself.
[1:25:51] And you know that's why he came on the
[1:25:54] cross and he lived a life here on earth
[1:25:58] so he could be touched by the filling of
[1:25:59] our infirmities so he could understand
[1:26:02] because as God as he would not know.
[1:26:05] He's never had sin. He's never had a
[1:26:07] problem. He's never had a bad thought.
[1:26:08] He never had a temptation until he came
[1:26:11] in flesh and he was tempted and tried
[1:26:13] like you and I.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; But he overcame
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; and Christ in you is your overcomer.
[1:26:20] Amen.
[1:26:24] Or or or another way to say, "Let no man
[1:26:27] um I I'm sorry, read that one." Do not
[1:26:31] provoke your children to anger by the
[1:26:34] way you treat them. Rather, bring them
[1:26:36] up with the discipline and instruction
[1:26:38] that comes from the Lord. When I would
[1:26:41] be instructing my children with a hard
[1:26:44] attitude, God would say, "Is that the
[1:26:47] way you want me to treat you?
[1:26:50] No. Then why are you doing that?
[1:26:53] Sit down. Walk away for a little while.
[1:26:54] Calm down a little bit.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; And you know, there'll still be love
[1:26:59] flowing through there for a little
[1:27:00] while. There won't be And my wife gets
[1:27:02] mad when I say it won't cost you as
[1:27:04] much. You won't have to take her to
[1:27:06] dinner. You won't have to buy her a new
[1:27:07] dress.
[1:27:09] And she says, "You're going to make
[1:27:10] everybody think that you have to do that
[1:27:12] to me." And I don't. But you know,
[1:27:14] sometimes just a little bit of quiet
[1:27:16] peace. Settle down. get him sometimes
[1:27:19] getting before the Lord for a little
[1:27:20] while. Lord, I know I've sinned. I know
[1:27:22] I've done wrong. I know I've failed. And
[1:27:25] God says, "That's exactly what I want to
[1:27:27] hear from you because now I can come in
[1:27:29] my sweetness, in my presence, and
[1:27:32] minister to you." When you're angry,
[1:27:34] when you're frustrated, when you're mad,
[1:27:35] when you're yelling and screaming, he's
[1:27:37] sitting on the side. And brother
[1:27:38] Brandham says the Holy Spirit sometimes
[1:27:40] will flee off a little bit to the side
[1:27:41] and wait till you calm down a little bit
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; because maybe you know Jesus took a whip
[1:27:47] and he chased them all out of the
[1:27:48] temple. I I don't want that to happen to
[1:27:51] me with him if I have to say Lord I'm
[1:27:54] sorry let me humble my spirit my
[1:27:56] attitude.
[1:27:59] Matthew
[1:28:01] chapter 25 34 to 40
[1:28:05] watch this. Then the king shall say unto
[1:28:07] them on his right hand, "Come ye blessed
[1:28:09] of my father, inherit the kingdom
[1:28:11] prepared for you from the foundation of
[1:28:14] the world.
[1:28:16] It's prepared for you."
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "I prepared this and I
[1:28:20] don't know what to do with it." No, he
[1:28:21] had you in mind while he was doing all
[1:28:23] of this
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; and he knows you by name.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; I think I've shared this with you
[1:28:29] before.
[1:28:30] I asked the Lord if he knew my name. I
[1:28:32] walked into the house and I was
[1:28:33] frustrated over someone. I just went
[1:28:35] over to the room and I said, "Lord, do
[1:28:37] you even know where I live and I know my
[1:28:39] name and I opened the Bible and it falls
[1:28:41] into Psalms 115 and it says, "Oh house
[1:28:43] of Aaron, I have blessed you, kept you."
[1:28:44] It says it three times in a row. Knows
[1:28:47] my name and where I live. But you know
[1:28:50] what? I asked him again. And then I
[1:28:51] asked him again. Then I asked him again.
[1:28:52] I wish we would learn. But you know
[1:28:55] what? He never said, "That's enough.
[1:28:56] Don't ever ask me again. If you do that
[1:28:58] again, no." He said, "Call on me. I'll
[1:29:00] talk to you. I'll share with you.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; He's never told me that I can't talk to
[1:29:05] him about the same thing again.
[1:29:08] And when you get my age, you repeat the
[1:29:10] same things a lot more than I ever used
[1:29:12] to.
[1:29:14] Dad, we've heard that story. That's the
[1:29:17] 337th time. One of the girls that keep
[1:29:20] records, I'm sure
[1:29:24] you laugh, but it's true.
[1:29:27] when they can tell you the same story
[1:29:28] back because you've said it so many
[1:29:30] times and maybe it's changed the story
[1:29:31] time. Then shall the king say unto them
[1:29:34] on his right hand, "Come ye blessed of
[1:29:36] my father, inherit the kingdom prepared
[1:29:39] for you from the foundation of the world
[1:29:42] prepared for you."
[1:29:45] He wasn't like, "Oh, I've prepared it
[1:29:47] because I know you're going to be there.
[1:29:50] You're going to go through troubles.
[1:29:52] You're going to have hard times. You're
[1:29:53] going, "But I know you will be there. I
[1:29:56] have prepared it for you. It's got your
[1:29:58] name on it.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we wonder if we can erase your
[1:30:02] name. No, you can't.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; You might get a little bit of um help
[1:30:09] from him. Um the kind that's swiftly
[1:30:11] applied,
[1:30:13] the kind that you know gets you going,
[1:30:16] but he cares. That's why
[1:30:18] if I didn't care what my children would
[1:30:20] do, and that's what you're seeing and
[1:30:22] happening in the world right now. You're
[1:30:24] old enough. you're on your own.
[1:30:27] You know, hey, you grew up. Goodbye. No,
[1:30:30] they're still my children. I'm still
[1:30:32] his. And he still watches over me.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; He says, "For when I hunger was hungry,
[1:30:40] you gave me meat. When I was thirsty,
[1:30:42] you gave me drink. I was a stranger and
[1:30:45] you took me in.
[1:30:47] And because of this, I've inherited the
[1:30:50] kingdom of God. The things that we
[1:30:52] should be doing daily should be part of
[1:30:55] our life. Should be part of our nature
[1:30:56] and our character. The same thing he
[1:30:58] did. Uh Jesus, they're hungry. What do
[1:31:00] we have? We have two fish and a couple
[1:31:01] of those. We got more than enough. He's
[1:31:04] still the same yesterday, today, and
[1:31:06] forever. He's more than able.
[1:31:11] Naked and you clothe me. I was sick and
[1:31:13] you visit me. I was in prison and you
[1:31:16] came to me
[1:31:18] and I I could hear them when
[1:31:22] when were you in the hospital? I don't
[1:31:24] remember you being sick. I don't ever.
[1:31:27] And he goes, "Then shall the righteous
[1:31:29] answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we
[1:31:32] thee hungry, and fed thee, and thirsty,
[1:31:35] and gave thee drink? When saw we thee as
[1:31:38] a stranger, and took thee in, and naked,
[1:31:40] and clothe thee? or when saw we thee
[1:31:43] sick or in a prison and came unto thee?
[1:31:46] And the king shall answer and say unto
[1:31:48] them, verily I say unto you, in as much
[1:31:50] as you have done it to one of the least
[1:31:52] of these my brethren, you have done it
[1:31:55] unto me.
[1:32:00] So we are being measured how we treat
[1:32:02] one another.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; That's one of God's main measuring
[1:32:06] sticks,
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; you know, and and Yeah. And and we know
[1:32:12] we do fail. We do make mistakes.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; And all God wants to see if you have the
[1:32:17] same attitude that he did and he said,
[1:32:19] "Father, forgive them. They don't know
[1:32:22] what they're doing."
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; See if we're going to take that same
[1:32:25] attitude.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Lord, have mercy on them. Forgive them.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Rather than
[1:32:31] Lord, they need to be taken care of.
[1:32:33] They need to be straightened out. You
[1:32:35] need to take care of them until I'm
[1:32:37] happy.
[1:32:38] We won't say it in words, but that's
[1:32:40] really what we're saying.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; I want to be made happy by you taking
[1:32:45] care of them.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Yes. When your children are little,
[1:32:50] there are times that they disappoint
[1:32:53] you. They misbehave. They're children.
[1:32:57] Now, when they're 16, 18, 20 years old,
[1:33:00] that's a little bit different. But when
[1:33:02] they were little kids, the there's six
[1:33:04] girls. There's 10 years apart them
[1:33:06] between uh my wife had taken them to the
[1:33:08] library
[1:33:10] and um when she came out of the library,
[1:33:12] they were all kind of following her and
[1:33:14] some man saw them and he starts going
[1:33:16] quack quack quack quack quack quack and
[1:33:19] the girls thought it was hilarious. My
[1:33:21] wife didn't think so. So she takes them
[1:33:24] shopping and they purposely line up
[1:33:26] behind her smallest to the tallest and
[1:33:30] followed her around the shopping center
[1:33:31] going quack quack quack quack quack
[1:33:33] quack.
[1:33:35] They're still alive.
[1:33:39] Children are children. They're your
[1:33:40] children. God gave them to you. But
[1:33:43] today
[1:33:45] they all they're not all all at home
[1:33:47] there. But sometimes we're all sitting
[1:33:48] around the dinner table and we're I'm a
[1:33:50] happy dad.
[1:33:52] They love the Lord Jesus. They respect
[1:33:55] their parents. All of them have a good
[1:33:58] testimony.
[1:33:59] Not because dad did it, because all I
[1:34:02] did was get them. Lord, let you be their
[1:34:05] example.
[1:34:07] They make mistakes. Yes, they make
[1:34:09] mistakes. Do they have to come back and
[1:34:11] say, "I'm sorry." Yes, they have to come
[1:34:13] back. Sometimes, John, did you take care
[1:34:15] of this? You were supposed to do this on
[1:34:16] your car. No, Dad. I forgot. I said,
[1:34:18] "Well, it would have been a $50 problem.
[1:34:20] Now it's a $500 problem.
[1:34:23] See, something taken care of quickly,
[1:34:25] it's usually like this. Something that
[1:34:28] goes six months and not like this.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; And if we just be willing to say, "Lord,
[1:34:33] I'm sorry."
[1:34:34] So again,
[1:34:37] what's in your cup?
[1:34:40] What's in your cup? What's in your cup
[1:34:43] is what you put in it.
[1:34:50] I know I have the paper here.
[1:34:57] Remember, such as I have is what Peter
[1:35:00] said as as we finish up with this. You
[1:35:01] probably come up to your the instruments
[1:35:04] now.
[1:35:06] [Music]
[1:35:08] Such as I have, the woman at the blood
[1:35:11] issue, she drew from God.
[1:35:16] She drew from him. Why? Because she went
[1:35:18] and touched him. But in him was what she
[1:35:22] needed.
[1:35:23] And you know who God on earth is today?
[1:35:26] He's in me and you.
[1:35:29] That's he sends you down that way. And
[1:35:33] somebody reaches out. Hey, what is it
[1:35:37] about you? There's a peaceful spirit
[1:35:39] around you. There's something about you.
[1:35:41] How where do I get that from? Such as I
[1:35:44] have, I give unto you.
[1:35:48] What is drawn from me? What is drawn
[1:35:50] from you? Is there something that
[1:35:53] somebody would want, somebody would
[1:35:55] desire? Or is it uh he calls himself a
[1:35:59] Christian and he acts like that?
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Then I don't want Christianity.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:36:06] Eden was not just a place where you like
[1:36:10] where you live, you work, you
[1:36:11] fellowship. It was an atmosphere.
[1:36:15] It wasn't just a literal place. There
[1:36:17] was an atmosphere, an environment to
[1:36:19] where growth can be achieved.
[1:36:22] Okay? It in other words, there's
[1:36:23] something there to to draw out of you so
[1:36:27] someone can receive from it. That's what
[1:36:30] Eden was for them. It was a place where
[1:36:33] God let everything grow. There were
[1:36:36] trees, there were plants, there was
[1:36:37] everything was there. It wasn't just a
[1:36:40] mark, a literal place, a place where God
[1:36:43] was dwelling.
[1:36:46] It says when a star leaves the
[1:36:48] atmosphere it was created for, it
[1:36:51] destroys itself.
[1:36:53] So what atmosphere do we keep around us?
[1:36:59] And really we have to watch that. What
[1:37:02] atmosphere do we keep around us?
[1:37:05] What house will you build me? He says,
[1:37:07] "A beautiful home, a temple, a mansion."
[1:37:09] No, what he wants is you. You're his
[1:37:11] dwelling place. Sure, he'll come and
[1:37:14] meet with us in here. But if he's just
[1:37:16] here when we leave, he doesn't go with
[1:37:18] us. But if we bring him, we take him.
[1:37:21] He's with us all the time.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; I think I think brother Israel,
[1:37:27] if you didn't come, Brother Israel would
[1:37:29] stand here and say, "Who do I preach to?
[1:37:30] What do I do?" There's somebody willing
[1:37:33] to receive.
[1:37:35] And and it's it's it's something that in
[1:37:38] God is placing brother Israel to give.
[1:37:41] It's something God has placed in you to
[1:37:42] give at school, at work, in the
[1:37:45] neighborhood, right in the same house
[1:37:47] that you live in with your family to
[1:37:49] give one another.
[1:37:52] The Bible even says the right hand
[1:37:53] doesn't say the left hand, I'm better
[1:37:54] than you. I don't need you. It's all
[1:37:56] part of the body.
[1:37:59] He says,
[1:38:01] so so he says if his dwelling place is a
[1:38:05] church, a temple or in special meetings,
[1:38:09] then our only time with him is when we
[1:38:11] are in those places.
[1:38:15] And we know it's good together with the
[1:38:17] saints in church. It's good for the
[1:38:18] meetings. We look forward to them. But
[1:38:20] it should be an everyday experience. It
[1:38:23] should be just as welcome in your home,
[1:38:24] in your car, at your work, wherever you
[1:38:26] are at.
[1:38:29] We don't leave him in church. We don't
[1:38:30] leave him in our prayer go. We We take
[1:38:33] him everywhere we go. Such as I have, I
[1:38:35] give unto you.
[1:38:37] It's Christ in us, the hope of glory.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Then his glory should be with in us to
[1:38:44] be able to give to others such as I
[1:38:48] have. You don't have to run to the
[1:38:50] brother to to the pastor. Can I borrow
[1:38:54] some of your grace? I need some. Can I
[1:38:55] borrow some of your peace? No. Because
[1:38:58] when when they did that, he says, "No,
[1:38:59] go and look for yourself, lest you take
[1:39:02] ours."
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; But the Christ in you is the hope of
[1:39:06] glory for you and maybe your neighbor
[1:39:09] and maybe your coworker.
[1:39:11] What is it that you have that's so so
[1:39:14] good and so rich? I want it also.
[1:39:19] Fill my cup, Lord. I lift it up, Lord.
[1:39:23] How many would say that today?
[1:39:25] Yeah. Feel my cup.
[1:39:33] I left
[1:39:38] [Music]
[1:39:45] this
[1:39:49] my soul.
[1:39:54] Bread of heaven.
[1:40:00] Free me till I
[1:40:10] come.
[1:40:15] [Music]
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Here's my cup. I lift it up. I put it
[1:40:22] before you.
[1:40:24] Fill it up.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Fill it up and make me whole. Make me
[1:40:29] complete.
[1:40:31] Make me everything you want me to be.
[1:40:33] And that's what would come out of you.
[1:40:36] No matter where you're at. No matter
[1:40:38] where you're at. We should not be
[1:40:40] embarrassed to be a Christian wherever
[1:40:43] we're at. A Christian doesn't mean you
[1:40:45] have to stand there and preach to
[1:40:47] everybody. It doesn't mean that you have
[1:40:49] to tell them how wrong they are and how
[1:40:50] right you are. In fact, it shouldn't
[1:40:51] mean that at all.
[1:40:53] That should be a life lived that speaks
[1:40:55] louder than any words. That you'd be
[1:40:58] willing to go help somebody that's
[1:40:59] hurting like the wounded man and they
[1:41:02] were coming out and the priest went this
[1:41:03] way and the other one that way. But the
[1:41:06] the the other man come and says, "I'll
[1:41:07] take him. I'll bear him over to there
[1:41:09] where they can take care of him and I'll
[1:41:10] pay for it out of my own pocket." That
[1:41:12] was a type of Christ. I'll come down and
[1:41:15] I'll pay for this out of my own pocket.
[1:41:17] I'll get my life for them. One more
[1:41:19] time. Here's my cup pocket. Hear my God.
[1:41:29] I
[1:41:31] [Music]
[1:41:50] breath of heaven
[1:41:56] me filled I want
[1:42:01] no
[1:42:03] more.
[1:42:05] It's my cup.
[1:42:08] Fill it up. And one more time, let's
[1:42:13] lift our hands to him. Make it a prayer.
[1:42:18] Oh
[1:42:20] my God.
[1:42:22] Oh Lord,
[1:42:25] I lift it up.
[1:42:29] [Music]
[1:42:30] Oh my. Yes, Lord.
[1:42:33] Come and quench
[1:42:38] this thirsty
[1:42:41] of my soul.
[1:42:44] Yes, Lord Jesus.
[1:42:53] Lead me till I
[1:43:00] more
[1:43:04] cup.
[1:43:06] Fill it up and make it home.
[1:43:13] Amen. How many enjoy the word of the
[1:43:15] Lord tonight?
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say thank you, Lord? Amen.
[1:43:19] Yes. Thank you, Lord
[1:43:23] Jesus. He has everything we need. Amen.
[1:43:27] Let's sing that song just a praise and
[1:43:30] worship. God is so good. Good to me.

[1:45:29] answers
[1:45:30] prayer.
[1:45:32] He's so good
[1:45:36] to
[1:45:38] me.

[1:45:41] so good to me.
