[34:03] that many people you got to sing more
[34:04] than one that's the way I feel about it
[34:07] amen God bless you my brother I met him
[34:10] some years ago I didn't quite remember
[34:12] him until I saw his face and so I'll let
[34:15] let him greet the Saints and you could
[34:17] tell us about your church and and those
[34:20] things amen we'll take this one here I
[34:22] bless you by
[34:24] amen uh God bless you Church
[34:27] amen uh it's good to be here it's always
[34:30] good in the house of the Lord and uh my
[34:32] name is uh brother Edmond rafino we're
[34:35] from uh massachusett and we came down
[34:37] here nine years
[34:38] ago and uh we were participating in
[34:41] Harmon desert and we had a great time
[34:46] and uh we bu a few people back then we
[34:48] were singing and um but a peragon asked
[34:52] me to to have the people sing in his
[34:54] church but I wanted to come to be with
[34:57] my brother here but we end up not being
[35:00] able to to be in his church so I said
[35:03] next time I come down here I'll I'll
[35:06] visit him so so I came down here I said
[35:09] well let me give him a call and to see
[35:12] how's he doing so and I guess he's doing
[35:17] well well you know there was a the first
[35:21] time I came down he was back in
[35:23] 1999 and I was preaching for brother
[35:25] perig back then and um we came back
[35:29] again and uh few years after that to to
[35:34] go see um brother brandham Dan with a
[35:38] few people so I've been coming down here
[35:41] not often but from time to time with the
[35:44] church so they can see around so this
[35:47] time again we came with a few more
[35:49] people so they can see but but I'm there
[35:51] and say a few things so so it's good to
[35:55] fellowship with one another you know and
[35:58] when I enter the door I saw old faces
[36:02] and I saw old friend from Alaska where
[36:04] she's that there she is God bless you so
[36:09] it's good when you enter a place you
[36:11] find out you see people that you know so
[36:15] so it's good to be here it's good to be
[36:17] with uh all of you uh because not now
[36:21] it's very rare to find Believers of this
[36:23] end time message you know especially uh
[36:27] those that waiting for the
[36:28] promise so there are those that waiting
[36:31] for the promise and there are those that
[36:33] manifesting the
[36:35] promise so so now those the promises of
[36:40] the prop of God that what he says in the
[36:42] book with AI you know everybody can talk
[36:47] about the promise okay you can say nice
[36:49] word about the promise that can say even
[36:52] better what but what says now the Bible
[36:56] already said if it was possible they
[36:59] will even they even will get the
[37:03] elect they even will get the elect they
[37:06] even will deceive the elect so the only
[37:08] way they will not deceive the elect you
[37:12] have to be able to become the
[37:16] word you have to become the word now
[37:19] because you have to produce what brother
[37:23] Bram
[37:25] says because
[37:27] AI can make you look like the
[37:30] word it can even make you talk like the
[37:33] word but if you don't really manifest
[37:37] produce the word you are fake okay
[37:41] because you can make you like you look
[37:43] like you look good you look like you
[37:45] have one wife you look like you know
[37:47] everything looks fine you have long hair
[37:49] you look like you got everything what
[37:51] like look like you a perfect believer
[37:54] but really you're a fake oh because this
[37:57] is the hour where what said the third
[38:00] pool supposed to be what spoken word or
[38:03] the opening of the word supposed to be
[38:05] all kind of stuff but one thing he said
[38:07] about the third pool he said that's the
[38:09] same thing he was at sudom and gomor he
[38:12] said that's what what Noah was doing by
[38:15] their
[38:16] testimonies so the question is still the
[38:18] same you Believers because he says
[38:21] something at the end of the Bible the
[38:23] same thing in the Book of Genesis the
[38:25] spirit and the bride say the same thing
[38:29] so the question Still Standing
[38:31] today if you're a Believer what is your
[38:34] Vindication
[38:38] okay what is the spirit of God
[38:41] says make you a Believer what is the
[38:44] evidence that God says that will make
[38:46] you a Believer not what the pastor says
[38:49] what what's what the people says what is
[38:51] God says that will make you a believer
[38:55] in the same thing when you get arrested
[38:56] it what he says what is the evidence the
[38:59] C has on you that will make you that
[39:02] will convict you they have to have an
[39:05] evidence that will make you that will
[39:07] convict you to be a Christian and that
[39:10] evidence is the Holy Spirit and what is
[39:12] the evidence that will make you a
[39:15] Believer people waiting for the pastor
[39:18] to say oh you're a Believer will make
[39:20] you somebody said you're a Believer but
[39:22] the evidence is to to produce the word
[39:26] of God
[39:27] if you not manifested this message of
[39:30] the hour you are fake that's right if
[39:33] you're not producing what bam says you
[39:37] have to produce it amen you have to
[39:39] bring it in evidence amen not we have to
[39:41] see it in the papers now all of us we
[39:46] need to see the message amen when I see
[39:49] you I need to you become a living
[39:52] aist because the message pretty soon
[39:55] going to be nothing
[39:57] we have to become the message
[39:59] ourself you have to become a living
[40:04] message so we have to walk the
[40:07] message because our life has to become
[40:10] the
[40:11] message and this is where we at right
[40:13] now and that's why we are singing the
[40:17] messag because there's going to be
[40:19] things that going to turn the message
[40:20] upside down we don't know what's going
[40:22] to happen and this is a Time Believers
[40:26] this is this is the time Believers when
[40:28] we see somebody now we have to see the
[40:31] message in them when we look us seven
[40:34] the mirror we have to see the message
[40:38] when I look myself in the mirror I have
[40:40] to see the
[40:41] message and that's why we're here I come
[40:43] down to see you because I want to see me

[41:21] testimony same Abraham has the same
[41:25] testimony all the Believers have the
[41:28] same testimony we have to have the same
[41:31] testimony why we are waiting to get outy

[43:47] like to go right to the word we've been
[43:49] on our Wednesday night is a prayer
[43:51] meeting and we've been just taking a few
[43:55] moments on the
[43:57] cood and we've been on the conduct
[44:01] portion conduct order and Doctrine we've
[44:02] just been dealing with the conduct and
[44:05] this is our third time third service on
[44:07] that just 30 40 minutes or so and then
[44:11] we'll take some prayer requests I've
[44:14] been thanking the lord for it and I've
[44:16] been enjoying myself going into it I
[44:19] trust the Saints have been feeding on
[44:22] the word as well in the scriptures um um
[44:27] um in Hebrews chapter 2 we'll stand and
[44:30] read there Hebrews 2 and Ephesians
[44:33] chapter
[44:52] 1 Hebrews chapter 2 veres 1 1 3
[44:57] therefore we ought to give the more
[44:59] Earnest heed to the things which we have
[45:03] heard lest at any time we should let
[45:05] them
[45:07] slip for if the word spoken by Angels
[45:10] was steadfast and every transgression
[45:13] and disobedient received a just
[45:16] recompense of reward how shall we escape
[45:21] if we
[45:23] neglect so great salvation
[45:26] which at the first began to be spoken by
[45:28] the Lord it was confirmed unto us by
[45:31] them that heard him amen Ephesians
[45:35] chapter
[45:36] 1 the Apostle
[45:41] Paul placing the Ephesian Church Grace
[45:44] be to
[45:45] you and peace from God our Father and
[45:49] from the Lord Jesus
[45:51] Christ blessed be the God and father of
[45:54] our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us
[45:57] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[46:01] places in Christ Jesus amen let us pray
[46:06] Lord Jesus we ask your blessings on your
[46:08] word tonight the portion that you have
[46:10] allotted for us Lord help us to just uh
[46:15] consume what you have for us tonight
[46:18] speak to our hearts to every heart
[46:20] that's gathered here Lord let the young
[46:23] ones receive the old ones receive
[46:26] the newcomer the Old Timer each one
[46:29] receive their portion is our prayer in
[46:32] the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray
[46:35] amen God bless you you may be
[46:37] seated amen we took on that first uh
[46:40] order conduct order and Doctrine we was
[46:43] talking about the conduct we talked
[46:45] about the beginnings in Luke chapter 14
[46:49] Jesus brings that to the believer that
[46:52] he that can't hate his father mother
[46:56] brother-in-law wife children Brethren
[47:00] sisters
[47:02] wife husband whoever whatever and their
[47:07] own life they're not worthy to serve him
[47:10] and so we know that our life is not our
[47:12] own and we don't love our own life we uh
[47:17] live this life for Christ when we come
[47:19] to him we deny ourselves and we're now
[47:23] enlisting into an army and that's the
[47:26] army of the Lord the greatest army now
[47:28] you might think you're here for one
[47:30] purpose or the other as far as why God
[47:33] brought you
[47:34] here uh but to a Believer it's revealed
[47:37] to us why we are here we are to be about
[47:41] our father's business and this is why he
[47:43] institutes the church and he calls us
[47:47] out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light
[47:50] so that we can Proclaim his light he's
[47:53] the light of the world and we become
[47:54] that light of the world world and so
[47:56] that's a tremendous calling and in that
[47:59] calling we are commanded in the
[48:02] scriptures to gather together in his
[48:04] name and not to forsake the assembling
[48:08] of ourselves together even as we see the
[48:10] end time
[48:12] approaching and last time we were here
[48:15] we took uh and we'll continue in that
[48:17] just a little bit about our post of
[48:21] Duty how brother Brandon brings that out
[48:23] as a Believer how the believer has a
[48:26] post of Duty a place that is depending
[48:30] on them and why that is and why God set
[48:34] it up and how he set it up now brother
[48:39] brandom says this in the message the way
[48:40] of a true prophet and again I'll just
[48:44] back up a little bit the reason why
[48:46] we're bringing this this is the ABCs it
[48:48] seems like it's the Simplicity it's the
[48:51] beginning but um if you ever let those
[48:55] things slip like Hebrews said that's
[48:58] right you'll be guilty of being
[49:01] negligent and you know we are not trying
[49:05] to make halfway church members uh the
[49:09] members of any church should be pillars
[49:13] should be able to handle the word
[49:15] responsibly know where they stand on
[49:17] God's word and be able to um defend it
[49:23] even to Proclaim it and live the gospel
[49:26] of the Lord Jesus Christ that's not just
[49:28] for preachers coming to the house of the
[49:31] Lord isn't just the preachers I'm called
[49:34] to be here the ministers are called to
[49:36] be here but the Believers that are
[49:37] called to that local assembly they're
[49:40] supposed to be there too and Jesus said
[49:44] that when you gather in my name there I
[49:48] will be in your midst what a wonderful
[49:51] promise so we gather with the promise in
[49:53] mind that Jesus said he would be here in
[49:56] our midst I'm going to read from the
[49:57] message the way of a true prophet and
[49:59] the prophet says this here paragraph
[50:02] 26 and he was in the campaign and some
[50:05] meetings and he's talking about the late
[50:07] service that they were having he says
[50:09] but you go you got to go to Sunday
[50:11] school in the morning now now you must
[50:13] be sure to do that and remember I've
[50:17] always said it's absolutely a sin to
[50:20] send your children to Sunday school
[50:22] don't never do that that's wrong take
[50:26] them always see always go with them he
[50:30] and so now that's in the morning so now
[50:34] if you have if you have had to miss work
[50:37] to hear to be with us and pray with us
[50:40] and so forth you have to miss work
[50:44] that's all right just go ahead and miss
[50:46] work but don't you miss church did he
[50:50] say that what' he say don't you miss
[50:53] church I won't make you l late enough to
[50:56] miss church but if you do have to miss
[50:58] work once in a while that won't hurt we
[51:03] switch that around didn't
[51:05] we now cuz work that's just your daily
[51:08] bread and you the Lord promised to
[51:10] provide that so but this you must really
[51:13] be sure to come to church you see so
[51:17] it's brother bandom telling us to quit
[51:19] our jobs and just join a church and go
[51:21] to church every day it's not what he's
[51:23] saying he's bringing in the balance you
[51:26] know this age has taken all of the days
[51:29] of the week it's taken every hour that
[51:32] it can and there's jobs that are
[51:35] available 24 hours a day Sunday through
[51:39] Sunday somebody's hiring and for
[51:42] believers we call our Sunday our holy
[51:47] day that's the Lord's day that we have
[51:49] set aside to Worship the Lord and it's a
[51:52] very important day it's a day we just
[51:54] set aside and prepare for on the
[51:57] Saturday we shouldn't be preparing to go
[51:59] to church on Sunday that should have
[52:01] started Saturday and that would release
[52:04] a lot of the arguing that takes place on
[52:08] Sunday ain't nobody saying amen but it's
[52:10] the truth um you know that Sunday
[52:14] morning belongs to God now you can slip
[52:17] in and try to go to the grocery store in
[52:20] between the services and go pick up this
[52:22] and do a little bit of shopping because
[52:24] something's on sale
[52:26] but I don't think that's right I think
[52:28] we need to go back to what the prophet
[52:31] told us and what the Bible gave us what
[52:34] the Old Testament Sabbath was and how
[52:37] that crossed over to our new testament
[52:40] Sunday the Resurrection Day the world
[52:44] has made it less important the church
[52:46] world has done the same and if you're
[52:48] not careful that spirit will get upon
[52:51] you too so now brother Brandon brings us
[52:54] that you can miss work a little bit if
[52:57] you have to but don't miss church
[53:01] continues on the the message the Seal of
[53:03] Christ paragraph 38 he says this
[53:08] here I became the chief presor next year
[53:11] and maybe I'll be a district man or
[53:13] something that's all the preacher about
[53:16] cares about anymore come on preacher
[53:20] we're going to take it with them that's
[53:22] right oh my pulling feathers in the hat
[53:25] and so forth when we ought to be on our
[53:28] knees crying for the sins and the
[53:31] Abomination and the disgrace that's done
[53:33] in the city we seem to be so unconcerned
[53:36] about the Lost amen amen that's right
[53:40] you know that's truth unconcerned about
[53:43] the loss just so our church makes it so
[53:47] we have the greatest congregation Sunday
[53:50] all stay home Sunday night and look at
[53:53] the television today I was in one of the
[53:55] biggest churches in the city one of the
[53:58] members said we have 3,000 people here
[54:00] on Sunday morning Sunday night we don't
[54:04] have half of it they all come to church
[54:07] to do their religion and go back home
[54:10] look at the television take a little
[54:12] ride out in the country why it's a
[54:16] disgrace it shows there's something
[54:19] lacking in the heart you know many of
[54:21] the churches I'm not criticizing them
[54:24] I'm not talking against it but many of
[54:26] the churches have totally done away with
[54:29] their Sunday evening service and they
[54:31] haven't even added another one during
[54:33] the week and guess what if I cancel a
[54:36] Sunday night service guess what you
[54:37] going to do you'll fill it with
[54:40] something else to do and let's cancel it
[54:42] for a year and then and we can go on a
[54:45] country ride and have the family time
[54:48] and after service enjoy our family enjoy
[54:52] ourselves and do that for about a year
[54:54] and and then I feel it on my heart to
[54:56] bring back Sunday night who's going to
[54:58] give me a hard time most everybody will
[55:01] because you can feel that time in with
[55:03] anything whether it's Sunday night
[55:06] Friday night Sunday morning that's not
[55:09] the point the point is if the if the
[55:12] church is gathering together and you can
[55:15] be there and you decide not to be there
[55:18] not that you couldn't be there but you
[55:19] decided not to be there the scripture
[55:22] says you're forsaking the
[55:26] assembling cuz others are there so you
[55:31] say well brother Israel what if you
[55:32] cancel church we didn't have church
[55:34] anyways you know we missed tonight maybe
[55:37] we're missing out no you're not
[55:38] forsaking that's you're forsaking the
[55:42] assembly so when the assembly is called
[55:45] together to worship Believers that work
[55:48] just like everybody else work people
[55:51] that have children in families just like
[55:52] you have and the responsib abilities and
[55:55] the cares of life and then you take your
[55:59] that that that that um the the uh the
[56:03] the uh the weight of the day and the
[56:05] tiredness and the the aches in the body
[56:09] and I could catch up on some sleep I
[56:12] really should get some extra sleep but
[56:15] you know the doors have been open at the
[56:18] house of the Lord Brother brandom says
[56:21] if the love of God is in your heart it
[56:24] will dve drive you to the church when
[56:27] those doors are open so there's a
[56:29] question to our love then where is our
[56:33] desire in our love if I was going to
[56:36] play a series of movies Here gospel
[56:39] movies or church movies more people
[56:42] would come out to church for that
[56:44] because it's an entertainment and church
[56:47] I mean it's just church again right the
[56:50] song leader somebody's going to preach
[56:52] the brother's going to preach I'm going
[56:54] to get up and use a the bathroom a
[56:55] couple times same brother who falls
[56:57] asleep will fall asleep and it we'll get
[57:00] out about the same time every time well
[57:02] if that's your expectation that's
[57:04] exactly what you're going to get that's
[57:05] it but in the Bible when God called The
[57:09] Tabernacle together it was very serious
[57:12] there was a order and a structure to it
[57:16] behind the curtain was the shakina glory
[57:19] and not just anybody could go in there
[57:22] it was a purpose it had an anointing and
[57:26] God called that assembly together I
[57:29] wouldn't forsake that so brother random
[57:32] continues on in this message a greater
[57:35] than Solomon is here paragraph number
[57:37] 201 he says this
[57:42] here paragraph 203 God said a woman that
[57:46] will wear a garment pertains to a man is
[57:48] an Abomination to God and you man that
[57:52] can't stop gawking and looking at women
[57:54] wom immorally dress the idols of the day
[57:58] you man that hasn't got enough real
[58:00] Grace in your heart to make your wife
[58:02] and kids quit doing such things as that
[58:05] the love of God isn't Anchored In Your
[58:07] Heart don't be called a Son of God
[58:10] you're still in Sodom a man that can't
[58:13] take over his own house God ordained him
[58:16] to do and you deacons that's married two
[58:19] or three times and you man that run out
[58:21] on your wives and try to hold your
[58:23] profession you women that cross the
[58:26] other way you people that hide behind
[58:28] the cloak of the church your
[58:31] denomination won't have nothing to do
[58:33] with the next fellow let him be a
[58:35] Christian or not if he don't belong to
[58:37] your crew you'll have nothing to do with
[58:40] him shame on you may God display real
[58:45] tonight to you may you come to him
[58:48] sweetly now and say Lord forgive me my
[58:52] sins from this night h H forth I'll
[58:55] serve you you that love television
[58:59] programs you that'll stay home to see
[59:01] some immoral movie star like we love sus
[59:04] or what some of the other stuff that
[59:06] they have stay home on Wednesday night
[59:09] to watch television instead of coming to
[59:11] the prayer room the love of God is gone
[59:15] from your heart you do that you still
[59:18] hold your membership the love of God
[59:20] would drive you from that and drive you
[59:23] to your Church to your brother and
[59:27] sister to come together sit in Heavenly
[59:30] places and listen at your pastor preach
[59:34] and the Revival or the camp is ending
[59:36] now if that still remains in your heart
[59:38] let us pray together now that God will
[59:41] remove it prophet of God
[59:44] continues you can say Amen to the word
[59:48] in 1964 the message identification he
[59:52] says this
[59:53] here
[59:55] paragraph
[59:56] 194 now if everyone would just keep your
[59:59] seat and be real reverent just a moment
[1:00:01] please so you see and contact him you're
[1:00:04] right on something here and something
[1:00:07] moves it throws you out it's a very hard
[1:00:09] thing it looks like that if one woman at
[1:00:12] SAR had done one time Jesus didn't
[1:00:15] repeat it over and over but the American
[1:00:17] people has got to be
[1:00:19] entertained you know that's just the
[1:00:22] nature of us we'd rather stay home home
[1:00:24] and watch television more entertainment
[1:00:27] that there than there is in the church
[1:00:30] see see that's Entertainment that's what
[1:00:33] we want it's got into the church God
[1:00:36] don't entertain you he just brings you
[1:00:39] his
[1:00:40] word praise the Lord so we see this love
[1:00:44] for entertainment in the church that
[1:00:47] Christmas and the Easter programs are a
[1:00:50] big Hollywood production in the
[1:00:52] denominational world they brought that
[1:00:55] into the church and now the way they're
[1:00:58] they have these different kinds of
[1:01:00] singing that they do and it's like rap
[1:01:03] music but they put gospel hymns to it
[1:01:06] and they put that in the church now but
[1:01:09] I'm so glad that we have a standard and
[1:01:11] they have people that's going to hold to
[1:01:13] that standard they have the
[1:01:15] entertainment in the church to keep the
[1:01:17] young
[1:01:18] people but what you
[1:01:21] keeping or you get them to stay you get
[1:01:23] them to come but who is there are they
[1:01:26] being filled with the Holy Ghost is
[1:01:29] there a change taking place can they
[1:01:32] handle the correction of the
[1:01:34] word and that's really a sign of a True
[1:01:38] Believer is can they handle when the
[1:01:41] word brings a correction to them and
[1:01:44] I'll say this here to you Saints God
[1:01:46] bless each of
[1:01:47] you that one of the single greatest now
[1:01:51] it's not the only but one of the single
[1:01:53] greatest you all think about this and
[1:01:54] tell me if you agree or not one of the
[1:01:58] single greatest outward
[1:02:01] indicators that God is dealing with a
[1:02:04] man or a woman is directly connected to
[1:02:08] their attendance in
[1:02:10] church now you think about that you see
[1:02:14] a newcomer come on and they get baptized
[1:02:18] and then you see
[1:02:20] them constantly in the word at every
[1:02:23] time the doors are open they're
[1:02:25] available they're there you have to say
[1:02:28] God is doing something with them and
[1:02:29] dealing with them this is why when
[1:02:32] you're when you're trying to establish
[1:02:34] someone to be on the board they can't be
[1:02:37] somebody that's here and there they got
[1:02:39] to be be here first show the stability
[1:02:44] of just simple Church
[1:02:46] attendance you can't even keep a decent
[1:02:49] job if you can't show up properly right
[1:02:53] uh like most of the time like even more
[1:02:57] than most of the
[1:02:59] time and and then when you do show up
[1:03:02] you shouldn't be looking to get credit
[1:03:05] because that was part of the job
[1:03:08] description and when when you come to
[1:03:10] the house of the Lord why do we think
[1:03:12] it's only the pastors are supposed to be
[1:03:14] here every day like the pastor is never
[1:03:18] tired he's never wanting just to stay
[1:03:20] home and sleep in tonight he just loves
[1:03:24] is coming every Wednesday
[1:03:27] night the fish are
[1:03:29] biting and we know they biting on the
[1:03:32] lake at
[1:03:33] Springtime and we could take that day
[1:03:35] off and go fishing and we just you know
[1:03:38] but you know there's a sacrifice there
[1:03:40] and when the when the the doors are open
[1:03:45] that's where the Believers we have
[1:03:47] agreed to come and gather in his name
[1:03:49] there and when We Gather in his name he
[1:03:52] promised to be there that's right
[1:03:55] it is this Daily Grind that where our
[1:03:58] training is many times
[1:04:01] exposed you can see the faithfulness of
[1:04:03] an individual just based just take the
[1:04:07] attendance marker just take that right
[1:04:09] there I'm not talking about someone that
[1:04:12] can't be there I'm talking about
[1:04:13] somebody that can be there and choose
[1:04:16] not to be there that shows that's a
[1:04:20] spiritual you say brother Israel coming
[1:04:22] to church doesn't save you I agree it
[1:04:24] doesn't save you you're saved by the
[1:04:25] blood of Jesus Christ there's people in
[1:04:27] the hospital that get saved there's
[1:04:29] people in prisons that get saved they
[1:04:31] can't come to church that's not what
[1:04:33] we're talking about we're not talking
[1:04:34] about salvation we're talking about your
[1:04:36] spiritual commitment and your
[1:04:38] faithfulness it's determined and this
[1:04:41] age has spoke against us coming to the
[1:04:46] house of the Lord and even coming to the
[1:04:49] house of the Lord in a decent halfway
[1:04:53] decent attire and the people come to
[1:04:56] church like a unmade
[1:04:59] bed like a bedroom that need to be swept
[1:05:02] and cleaned up where are you going what
[1:05:05] do you think that and you look at you
[1:05:08] look at the society they go out in
[1:05:10] Walmart that go shopping in house
[1:05:14] clothes and then you look at that into
[1:05:16] the church because they want everybody
[1:05:17] to feel welcome but I'm so glad we got a
[1:05:21] standard at coming this day
[1:05:24] and a witness that comeing this day that
[1:05:26] showed
[1:05:28] us and people that care you know you
[1:05:31] know what the what the what what B blows
[1:05:34] the excuse away is that you'll say
[1:05:38] someone will say something like well I
[1:05:40] have
[1:05:41] kids
[1:05:44] but but people that got kids when they
[1:05:46] show up they just blow that argument up
[1:05:49] it's like I got more than one kid I got
[1:05:52] two I got
[1:05:54] three who got five
[1:05:57] kids who's got nine
[1:06:00] kids and where you at you in church them
[1:06:03] kids you should be more responsible than
[1:06:05] that you should have them kids at home
[1:06:09] they got to go to school tomorrow why
[1:06:11] you going to have them in church because
[1:06:13] they might get saved they might hear
[1:06:17] something they need for their
[1:06:20] soul down the journey in life what is
[1:06:24] more important than hearing the word of
[1:06:27] the Lord somebody tell me somebody show
[1:06:33] me so what God does he raises up a
[1:06:37] standard by presenting a testimony right
[1:06:40] before
[1:06:41] you and I'm glad he does it that way he
[1:06:43] does
[1:06:45] so there is
[1:06:47] something with the sin of
[1:06:50] omission you omit to do the simp simple
[1:06:54] things that slip away from us the
[1:06:57] importance of coming together the
[1:07:00] sacrifice that's involved with getting
[1:07:03] dressed after you worked all day God
[1:07:06] sees it
[1:07:08] all and the people in the neighborhood
[1:07:10] see it all and your family sees it all
[1:07:15] and the church body needs you to be here
[1:07:18] because we come together in Heavenly
[1:07:22] places in Christ
[1:07:24] Jesus all right so let's go a little bit
[1:07:28] further just for a moment all right I'll
[1:07:31] take a few quotations here and
[1:07:36] then move right
[1:07:38] on now our life is not our
[1:07:41] own we were bought with a
[1:07:44] price you say me time my own personal
[1:07:48] time well brother and sister we were
[1:07:51] actually purchased with the precious
[1:07:53] ious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ yes
[1:07:56] sir when you join the Army it's till
[1:07:59] death I mean you really have to be
[1:08:02] willing to give your life for what you
[1:08:05] believe if it's really a conversion
[1:08:08] you'll give your life for it it's not
[1:08:10] just to join some group or some number
[1:08:13] you've joined the greatest group you
[1:08:16] could ever as God birs you into the
[1:08:19] family of God he's the chief Captain
[1:08:23] there's dangers seen and unseen there's
[1:08:26] perils there's swords there's lies
[1:08:29] there's darts of the enemy the enemy has
[1:08:32] the Target on your back and now all of
[1:08:35] hell is after you but hold on good
[1:08:38] soldier he that called you is able to
[1:08:42] keep
[1:08:43] you when others are falling apart
[1:08:46] backsliding losing their faith going on
[1:08:49] you'll still be standing in the name of
[1:08:52] Jesus Christ
[1:08:54] because God is there to help you he's
[1:08:59] the one who called you and he will bring
[1:09:01] you all the way through amen here what
[1:09:05] the scripture says
[1:09:07] here we'll take a scripture or
[1:09:11] two
[1:09:15] M Luke
[1:09:18] 142 there were great multitudes with him
[1:09:21] and he turned and said unto them if any
[1:09:23] man come to me and hate not his father
[1:09:27] and mother and wife and children and
[1:09:29] Brethren and sisters yay in his own life
[1:09:33] also he cannot be my
[1:09:38] disciple and who soever does not bear
[1:09:40] his cross and come after me cannot be my
[1:09:46] disciple for which of you intending to
[1:09:48] build a tower sth not down first and
[1:09:53] count
[1:09:54] the cost whether he have sufficient to
[1:09:57] finish
[1:09:58] it less happily after he have laid the
[1:10:01] foundation is not able to finish it and
[1:10:03] all that behold it began to mock him
[1:10:06] saying this man began to build and was
[1:10:08] not able to finish that's a problem with
[1:10:10] a lot of Believers today they can't
[1:10:12] finish verse 31 or what king going to
[1:10:16] war against another king sth not down
[1:10:20] first and consulted whether he be able
[1:10:24] with 10,000 to meet him that cometh
[1:10:27] against him with 20,000 or else while
[1:10:30] the other is yet a greater way off he
[1:10:33] sendeth of ambassage and desireth
[1:10:36] conditions of Peace So
[1:10:39] likewise whosoever he be of you that
[1:10:43] forsaketh not
[1:10:45] what all that he has he cannot be my
[1:10:52] disciple
[1:10:54] so you belong to
[1:10:56] somebody you're called to a
[1:10:59] person you're not called to a group
[1:11:02] although there is a group but you're
[1:11:05] called to a person and we are his
[1:11:08] disciples he called us into his army and
[1:11:13] he's given us the equipment to fight
[1:11:16] until he calls us home no
[1:11:20] breaks no taking days off no part-time
[1:11:25] Christian part-time off part-time on
[1:11:28] it's every day a Christian it's a fight
[1:11:31] all the way I don't know a believer that
[1:11:33] ain't in a fight I don't know a marriage
[1:11:35] that isn't in a fight I don't know a
[1:11:38] church that isn't in a fight I don't
[1:11:40] know a young person that isn't in a
[1:11:42] fight but Jesus our captain already won
[1:11:45] the battle for us and all we have to do
[1:11:48] is stand and stand with him with the
[1:11:51] word or else while he is other a great
[1:11:54] way off he sended an ambassador and
[1:11:56] desireth conditions of Peace So likewise
[1:12:00] whosoever he be of you that forsaketh
[1:12:03] not all that he
[1:12:07] hath he cannot be my disciple salt is
[1:12:10] good but the salt is lost his savior
[1:12:13] wherewith shall it be seasoned it is
[1:12:15] neither fit for the land nor fit for the
[1:12:18] dun Hill but Men cast it out he that
[1:12:21] hath ears let him hear here so if it's
[1:12:24] salt it should be salty and if you're a
[1:12:27] Believer you should count up the
[1:12:30] cost you should count up the cost that
[1:12:32] it cost to follow Jesus Colossians 3
[1:12:38] 1-5 if you then be risen with Christ
[1:12:43] seek those things which are
[1:12:46] where above where Christ sth on the
[1:12:50] right hand of God set your affections on
[1:12:53] on things above not on things of the
[1:12:57] Earth for you are dead and your life is
[1:13:00] here with Christ in God when Christ who
[1:13:03] is our life shall appear then shall ye
[1:13:07] also appear with him in glory how many
[1:13:11] know that Christ is our
[1:13:13] life mortify Therefore your members
[1:13:17] which are upon the Earth fornication
[1:13:20] uncleanness inordinate affection evil
[1:13:24] and coitous which is
[1:13:28] idolatry 1 Corinthians 6:1 19- 20 the
[1:13:32] Bible says this what know ye not that
[1:13:37] your body is the Temple of the Holy
[1:13:40] Ghost which is in you which you have of
[1:13:44] God and ye are not your
[1:13:48] own for ye are bought with the price
[1:13:54] therefore glorify God in your body and
[1:13:57] in your spirit which are Gods is you're
[1:14:01] not your
[1:14:03] own actually your time doesn't belong to
[1:14:06] you your life doesn't belong to you it
[1:14:11] all belongs to God we're to we're here
[1:14:15] to serve
[1:14:16] him you know we've turned that
[1:14:19] around we
[1:14:21] misappropriated that we feel like we we
[1:14:25] we have our own our our my me time and
[1:14:28] my and minds and what belongs to
[1:14:32] me and but for a Believer we're Lambs he
[1:14:36] say my rights I have a right to do this
[1:14:39] but as a lamb you give those rights
[1:14:42] up your time belongs to him you say well
[1:14:46] I'm going to go over here I'm going to
[1:14:47] do this but what if God wants you to go
[1:14:49] over here and pray for
[1:14:51] somebody what if at the end of the
[1:14:53] service there's a soul that needs prayer
[1:14:55] at the altar but you got plans for
[1:14:59] lunch well whose time clock are you on
[1:15:02] anyways whose business are you about
[1:15:06] anyways your little calendar that you
[1:15:08] have all this stuff you going to do you
[1:15:10] going to do this and do that and do this
[1:15:12] your time really your whole life is in
[1:15:15] God's hands you got only so many
[1:15:17] heartbeats left here my brother the time
[1:15:21] clock is switched over and the grain of
[1:15:23] sand is winding up for all of us and we
[1:15:28] will give an account for the time and
[1:15:29] what we spent with our
[1:15:32] time you know where your heart is that's
[1:15:36] where your Treasures are and you spend
[1:15:39] your time where your heart is and when
[1:15:42] God calls
[1:15:43] you and he reveals himself to you and
[1:15:47] this becomes a reality to you then
[1:15:50] you'll lay everything else aside
[1:15:54] and you'll pick up your
[1:15:57] cross and follow Jesus which is the word
[1:16:02] thank God for it amen
[1:16:05] amen
[1:16:07] this type of preaching really should be
[1:16:11] preached on the Sunday morning somebody
[1:16:12] told
[1:16:14] me because that's you know the crowd
[1:16:16] feels up brother ROM I read the quote
[1:16:19] for you 3,000 on Sunday morning Sunday
[1:16:22] evening half of them
[1:16:24] gone it's I mean all over where I've
[1:16:27] traveled the Wednesday night crowd is
[1:16:29] typically a small of crowd we've been
[1:16:31] blessed that a good portion of the
[1:16:34] Saints make it here on
[1:16:35] Wednesday as they do Sunday morning is
[1:16:38] that right Saints sometimes but just
[1:16:41] about but generally speaking that Sunday
[1:16:44] morning oh we can't miss that we can't
[1:16:46] miss that we got to be there Sunday
[1:16:47] morning Sunday evening is
[1:16:52] like
[1:16:54] I don't
[1:16:56] know we got something better we can
[1:16:59] do but your life is not your own all
[1:17:02] right now there's a couple quotes I want
[1:17:06] to read here and it's going to put a
[1:17:08] smile on everybody's face all right I'm
[1:17:11] going say that by
[1:17:14] faith some of y'all
[1:17:16] look well don't let me say that all
[1:17:19] right I'm going to keep my testimony
[1:17:20] positive up
[1:17:22] here
[1:17:23] but but here's what brother bradam says
[1:17:26] about staying home from church there's a
[1:17:29] couple of places where he talks about it
[1:17:30] he says I watch many times the wolf
[1:17:34] after the deer it can catch the little
[1:17:36] deer out to itself that's the that's the
[1:17:39] one they work on there's a lesson if you
[1:17:42] can catch a deer away from the herd
[1:17:45] that's what the devil wants to do so to
[1:17:47] you young ladies he wants you to go out
[1:17:50] with the boy that's not a Christian to
[1:17:52] you young young man he wants you to go
[1:17:54] out with some little pained Jezebel
[1:17:56] that's not a Christian that's where he
[1:17:58] wants to break you up that's where he
[1:18:01] wants he wants to Sock his teeth into
[1:18:04] you and this little deer would get out
[1:18:07] to itself away from the herd that's the
[1:18:09] one the wolf works on you two old man or
[1:18:13] woman when you separate yourself from
[1:18:16] Believers people say I can stay at home
[1:18:19] be just as good as a Christian as I can
[1:18:22] at church Church you can't the Bible
[1:18:26] said not forsake or assemble ourselves
[1:18:29] together and that much more as we see
[1:18:31] the time coming if you're a Christian
[1:18:34] you long to go where other Christians
[1:18:36] are right and fellowship with other
[1:18:39] Christians so you cannot stay away from
[1:18:42] church and live the same life you can't
[1:18:47] do it because it's like I'm hungry but
[1:18:50] I'll never go to to the table I'll just
[1:18:52] I'll never never eat I just I ain't
[1:18:55] going to do it see you've got to go and
[1:18:58] feed on the word of God and fellowship
[1:19:01] one with another we need one another
[1:19:06] more now than we ever did need each
[1:19:09] other is now when you get yourself
[1:19:12] singled out from the rest of them making
[1:19:14] yourself just a little different you
[1:19:17] don't want to associate with them
[1:19:18] because they believe this and don't want
[1:19:20] to associate with that you're getting on
[1:19:22] D Dangerous Ground right then keeping
[1:19:26] away from church find the one of your
[1:19:28] choice and remain there and be a
[1:19:31] Christian brother to all of them that's
[1:19:34] the way to be a real Christian then
[1:19:36] we've got
[1:19:37] Fellowship
[1:19:38] protection people love you and pray for
[1:19:42] you that's the success of my meetings is
[1:19:46] because real godly people pray for me
[1:19:48] that's it in the message in tement 1957
[1:19:52] paragraph 54 the prophet of God says
[1:19:55] this
[1:19:57] here how can you say you can stay home
[1:20:00] and be just as good as Christian as you
[1:20:02] would be at church you can't do it read
[1:20:07] the word the Holy Spirit feeds on the
[1:20:10] word the Bible is God's spiritual diet
[1:20:14] for his church and the Holy Spirit is
[1:20:16] the one who brings it to you and places
[1:20:19] it in the heart and with Thanksgiving
[1:20:22] you water it and every Divine promise
[1:20:25] will produce just exactly what God said
[1:20:27] it would do it's got to it's his word
[1:20:30] and his
[1:20:33] life Christ is the mystery of God
[1:20:36] revealed brother bam opens up here a
[1:20:39] little bit more
[1:20:42] 1963 paragraph 83 says don't never Clan
[1:20:47] or talk or make yourself clannish we are
[1:20:51] one I couldn't say left hand I'm mad at
[1:20:53] you I'm going to take you away cuz
[1:20:55] you're not a right hand he's my left
[1:20:58] hand I want him to stay right there even
[1:21:00] the little tip of my finger I want it to
[1:21:02] stay right there every little part of my
[1:21:05] body stay right there and God wants us
[1:21:09] as a body of Believers to stay right
[1:21:12] exactly with one another right at with
[1:21:17] one another now you've got tapes on that
[1:21:21] you got tapes on what we believe you got
[1:21:25] tapes on discipline in the church this
[1:21:27] is what we're getting into in these
[1:21:29] messages here the next week or so how we
[1:21:32] behave oursel in the Church of God how
[1:21:35] we got to come here together and sit
[1:21:38] together in Heavenly places don't stay
[1:21:41] home if God is in your heart you can't
[1:21:44] hardly wait for them doors to open out
[1:21:46] yonder to get in here to fellowship with
[1:21:49] your brothers if you don't feel that way
[1:21:52] way then I tell you it's time you got to
[1:21:57] pray cuz we're in the last days where
[1:22:01] the Bible exhorted us much more as we
[1:22:04] see the day that day approaching to love
[1:22:07] one another with Christian love and
[1:22:08] divine love to assemble ourselves
[1:22:11] together in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:22:14] Jesus and love one another this will all
[1:22:17] men know you are my disciples when you
[1:22:19] have L one for the other isn't it
[1:22:23] amazing how this great challenge in the
[1:22:27] last couple of years has been on this
[1:22:31] Gathering Together how they want the
[1:22:34] church doors closed and this issue and
[1:22:38] that issue keeping Believers from
[1:22:41] gathering together when there's a direct
[1:22:44] command for us not to forsake
[1:22:48] that I mean that's the orders from the
[1:22:51] Army captain yes sir you can't listen to
[1:22:54] another private you can't listen to
[1:22:56] another follower God never called you to
[1:23:00] follow a follower God called you and us
[1:23:03] to follow the leader and the leader is
[1:23:06] the word and our orders come from him so
[1:23:11] when we want to ask permission from
[1:23:13] someone we get it from the word but you
[1:23:17] know what if I want to stay home if
[1:23:19] somebody's got something that they can
[1:23:22] you know twist the word around and give
[1:23:24] a reason why you know what I'm going to
[1:23:27] jump on that bandwagon cuz I want to
[1:23:29] stay home
[1:23:31] anyways but that still doesn't uh that
[1:23:34] still doesn't take away the word what
[1:23:35] the word of God has told us
[1:23:39] specifically as we see the day
[1:23:42] approaching not to forsake the
[1:23:46] assembling of yourselves together now
[1:23:49] here brother manam says this here
[1:23:53] and we're in the last days the Bible
[1:23:57] exhorted us that much more as we see
[1:24:01] that day approaching in the message the
[1:24:03] position of the believer he says this
[1:24:07] here now this is our scripture that we
[1:24:09] read in
[1:24:11] Ephesians and brother Rand is going to
[1:24:13] bring that in and I love the way he
[1:24:15] brings this in in Ephesians chapter 1
[1:24:17] that we read that we're in Heavenly
[1:24:19] places and he says this here paragraph
[1:24:22] 43 he's addressing this to those now
[1:24:26] that have come into Christ Jesus by the
[1:24:29] Holy Spirit Grace saluting them now
[1:24:33] Grace be unto you peace from God our
[1:24:36] Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:38] giving them the blessings of God grace
[1:24:41] be unto you and peace from God the
[1:24:43] Father the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be
[1:24:46] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[1:24:49] Christ who has blessed us with all
[1:24:51] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[1:24:54] in Christ
[1:24:57] Jesus now the fellow said I can be a
[1:25:00] Christian and stay home just as well no
[1:25:05] you can't no you've got to meet together
[1:25:11] with the rest of the body he has blessed
[1:25:15] us together in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:25:19] Jesus amen amen
[1:25:23] praise the Lord that's the word of the
[1:25:25] Lord to
[1:25:27] us prophet of God takes one two more
[1:25:30] places here in the message blessing
[1:25:33] prophet in the second-handed robe and he
[1:25:36] says this
[1:25:39] here

[1:26:14] sins of the country that's right and I'm

[1:30:40] laying right ahead the devil tries
[1:30:43] everything he can to discourage
[1:30:46] us we go through trials and testings but
[1:30:50] Elijah being spiritual minded also he
[1:30:53] knew that he had a purpose and he wasn't
[1:30:56] going to leave him he said as the Lord
[1:30:59] liveth and his soul liveth I'm not going
[1:31:01] to leave you I like that that
[1:31:02] determination oh my we take a little
[1:31:05] thing from God and get all discouraged
[1:31:07] in an
[1:31:08] hour but not
[1:31:11] Elisha he looked forward to the time he
[1:31:14] know that it was a close at hand so he
[1:31:17] went to another place and he said Terry
[1:31:19] here I pray thee for the Lord calling me
[1:31:22] somewhere else you just stay back here
[1:31:25] but there's no staying back with
[1:31:27] Elisha he had the revelation of what God
[1:31:31] was going to do so if somebody says just
[1:31:34] stay home tonight and look at the
[1:31:37] television it's too bad to go out don't
[1:31:41] you worry if you know the Lord Jesus is

[1:31:56] something to happen at any
[1:31:59] time know the church attendance should
[1:32:01] go up I guarantee you if our air

[1:32:47] people are looking for a reason to stay
[1:32:50] home but a True Believer is looking for
[1:32:53] a reason to come to
[1:32:55] church we looking for an
[1:32:58] opening where the church doors open

[1:33:12] the Saints looking for the Sho glory to
[1:33:16] come down in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:33:20] Jesus where the blessings flow the
[1:33:23] anointings flow the revelations flow
[1:33:26] that's why we come that's why we're
[1:33:29] gathered he sends that to us it's a sign
[1:33:33] of what's in our
[1:33:35] heart The Daily Grind is our training
[1:33:39] ground we meet together to receive these
[1:33:42] instructions from Heaven it's a great
[1:33:45] outward
[1:33:46] sign that God is really dealing with an
[1:33:50] individual is their Church Church
[1:33:51] attendance we know that's true it's not
[1:33:54] salvation please don't get that wrong
[1:33:56] but it does show that the spirituality
[1:33:59] of the individual is how they make it to
[1:34:02] the house of the Lord when they can
[1:34:05] Ephesians 1:3 tells us that he blessed
[1:34:08] us in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:34:11] this is our post of Duty We Gather in
[1:34:14] his name we love not our own life
