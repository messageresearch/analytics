Revelations to the 17th chapter of Revelations we still got 15 minutes all right I listen real real close now as we read you have your Bibles in turn I'm going to give you just a little time so that you'll get it did you get that lead in Smuckers is where I got see glorious reform that taken straight out of the martyrology of Rome at the Vatican now that was down to the persecution of St Patrick's people and then they called St Patrick they're they're saint St Patrick is about as much Catholic as I am you know how much I am he he detested the doctrine of the church he refused to go to the PO yes sir St Patrick even why you did you ever go up Northern Ireland where he had his schools you know his name wasn't Patrick how many knows that his name is sscat that's right lost his little sister you remember when they were all right now notice 17th chapter of Revelation everybody just try to open your heart let the Holy Spirit teach you now there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the had the seven vials now I see the seven vs you know these sevens as we're going through they all had right the same time following the plagues following the church agent just the same because it's all sealed up into that one book amen everything and everything happens just in rotation and one goes right in to the other other other these two Spirits are working God and the devil amen which had the seven last FES and he talked with me saying come here and I'll show thee unto thee the Judgment of the great that Seth upon many Waters now look here over here that Waters what is that that's a woman can't be a man and what is a woman symbol in the church in the B Church why Christ bride and so forth you see it's woman the church now Waters what does that mean watch here read the 15th verse over there and he said unto me the waters which thou sawest where the hor sth are peoples multitudes Nations and towns this church is ruling over the whole world set upon many Waters with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication spiritual fornication has taking her Doctrine in doctor and the habits of the Earth has been made drunk with the wine of her fornications boy you talk about a drunken Bunch on it you so he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman and did you know what the Catholics on riding admit this is their Church how many knows that right in their own writing I got facts of our faith is called I see belongs to a priest all right all right and so he Carri me away in the spirit into the Wilders and I saw a woman sitting up on a Scarlet clothed Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and 10 horns I just watched that that symbol that's seven heads now you see here said and the and and the the heads which thou saw us there Seven Hills on which the woman set it Rome sets on Seven Hills now there's no mistake about it see seven heads and 10 horns you were 10 kingdoms and so forth and the woman was arrayed in purple Scarlet clothes decked in gold and precious stones pearls having a golden cup in her handful of of abomination of abomination of the filthiness of her fornication that Antichrist Spirit fornication she teaching at committing adultery with thought see now she's supposed to be a bride see and committing an adultery see just like Eve did just like the church does that and upon on her head was written a name written mystery babblin the Great anybody knows babblin wrong the mother of harlots and Abominations of the earth and listen to the six verse and I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus and when I saw I wondered with great admiration she's such a beautiful thing with crosses and everything on her high in the world could she be the guilty of drinking the blood of the Saints he puzzled him I just go to tell him and the angel said en me wherefor does thou Marvel I'll tell thee The Mystery of the woman and the Beast that carth her now this is not under the one of the seals this is something else and he said the seven heads and the 10 horns the Beast I saw us wise and is not and shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit has no Foundation the PO and shall go into predition amen and they that dwell upon the Earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life there's the elected life from the foundation of the world how when was your name put on the book of life that Revival he atted no sir from the foundation of the world when they beheld the Beast that was is not and yet is see the Beast one will die another take his place he was he was not he was he was not was he was not not and she go Plumb into predition that way see all right and here is and here is the mind which has wisdom how many knows these nine spiritual gifts and one of them are wisdom right the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman said it you'd have to be totally blind deaf and dumb not to get that all right there are seven Kings five are fallen and one is Nero and one is to come and when he cometh he must continue just a short face you remember what he done burnt the city and laid on to the Christians and put his mother on a single tree of a horse and run her through the streets and Fiddle R burnt all right and the Beast that was and is not even he is the eighth Pagan room brought into Papa room when the Incarnate Antichrist Spirit become incarnate and was crowned he was made a Crown King of Rome amen both in state and church together am oh brother see it's just full of it as is seventh and he goth how long does he last they never change the system to predition the 10 horns which thou saw us are 10 Kings which have received no Kings kingdoms as yet but received poish Kings one hour with the beast that's dictators see course these have one mind all right look here and they talk about communism these have one mind and shall give their power and strength unto the Beast these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he's Lord of Lord and king of kings and they that are with him are called Chosen and faithful and he said unto me the waters which thou saw where the horse sth are peoples multitudes Nations and tongues the 10 horns which thou saw upon the Beast these shall hate the that Covenant is broken I talked about last night and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire don't you know the Bible says that the ship Masters and everything else said the last last that great City I met it Doom in one hour see for God has put in their hearts to fulfill his will and to agree and give Their Kingdoms over to the Beast until the word of God shall be fulfilled the woman which thou sawest is that great city which reth over all the kings of the Earth tell me one Russia don't re Over All We Don't Rain Over All there's only one king that Reigns over every like that Nebuchadnezzar's iron running out every one of them toes that's Rome Rome don't do it as a nation it does it as a church every nation under Heaven is to Rome no wonder they said who can make war with him he say peace that settles it every Catholic say don't fight they'll fight that's all who's able to do what he can do nobody that's right so they wondered if the Miracles he can do he stop War only thing you have to is stop that's all but you think you'll do it certainly not notice that sure sure they should kill one another should kill each other his Bo had no erors at first but his great sword did he done his killing later and changed from White Horse to Red Horse the same exactly Devil with his sword what did Jesus say Jesus said they that take the sword will perish by don't fight back see Jesus that night when he told said that and Peter tuck his sword see let do like he did just go ahead now now remember he's got a sword he's going forth a sword in his hand riding red horse waiting through the blood of everybody that disagrees with him how do you understand it how many understands what that seal is now all right now what did Jesus say they that take the sword will perish By The Sword is that right all right all right this writer and all his kingdom subjects that are slain down through the age that's draw all this blood are the martyrs of the Saints will be slain By The Sword of Jesus Christ when he comes they that take the sword will be slain By The Sword they took the sword of dogma and Antichrist and cut down the real true worshippers all down through the ages to the millions and when Christ comes with the sword for it's his word that proceeds out his mouth he'll slay every is before him you believe it hallelu let's go here just a minute Revelations we'll see now if I'm just saying that or where the word says it Revelations 1911 and I saw heaven open amen and behold a white horse and he that set on him is called faithful and true and in righteous he to judge and make war his eyes were the flames of fire and on his head many crowns oh brother See's done be crowned by Saints you see and he had a name written that no man knew but himself you remember we we can't we don't know that see and he was clothed let's see and he was clothed with the vure dipped in Blood and his name is called not is but called the word of God because he in the word is the same see now notice not his [Music] names his name it's called word of God it only knows one name no other name and the armies of Heaven which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen quiet and clean that's the righteousness of saints see now watch what did Jesus say he that takes the sword all right red horse rider here where she's coming amen he that takes the sword you might have killed 68 million of down through these ages since s amen maybe more but Jesus said he that takes the sword will perish by amen watch and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword amen Hebrews the fourth chapter said the word of God is sharper than a two-edged sword cutting even to the m of the bone and what does the word do it's a discerner of the thoughts of the heart right out of his mouth go a sharp to a a sharp sword that with it he should Smite the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he tread The Wine Press of the fierceness of the wrath of almighty God and he had on his vesture and on his thy a name written king of King and Lord of [Applause] Lord as the Impostors against the word of God and because they wouldn't agree and this thing Satan Place United the political Powers which he held and the spiritual Powers which he held together and made a church that sweeps into every nation and he's put Millions times Millions after he jumped off from his White Horse onto his red horse and he tuck his sword and went forth but God said with the same thing that he perverted or tried to but false teaching that same word will rise and power coming forth from the lips of Jesus Christ and shall slay [Applause] everything Heen there's a second seal you love him Hall oh my Hallelujah that's thus sayith the [Music] Lord [Music] [Applause] H if all these other Revelations and visions and everything has hit just exactly on the on the point and how many knows that raise your hand H everybody here with their hands up that's right so shall this be remember so oh friend come to the Fountain that's filled with blood drawn from emanuel's veins where Sinners plunged beneath the flood lose all their guilty stains come believe on him if you've never don't take any chance don't don't if there's anything in your life right we're here something's fixing to happen I don't know why I don't know when I know what's going to happen but I don't know when it's going to happen but it's found to be because he's revealing it right now he doesn't do anything unless he makes it known amamos three he makes it known first and he promised that these things would come in the last days and the seventh Church age at the end of it when The Messengers arrive there it would be it would be revealed those broken seal will be revealed and here they are now that's in the name of the Lord believe it friend Hallelujah come out of bab Hallelujah I want to say something before closing because I got I'm getting just 9:30 it's just right now time Billy and I when we got off of the plane in India our last trip there I was looking at a a paper that the brought was written in English and it said the earthquake must be over the birds are coming back then it the details they there something funny happened uh India don't have uh wolen fences like we do they pick up rocks and make their fences and they build all their houses out of rock just place them up there it's warm there around all any where PR in India let's up in the mountains and all down through kolut and things that people just lay on the street starving to death so forth now so uh and they build their house and towers of their house they run the the fence right up here at the side of their house build a tower for their house and a tower maybe where they got their well they dug it for their cattle and things and run their fences around and all at once something begin to happen the little birds you know go into those rocks and they build their nest and raise their young ones and something begin to happen every day when it would get hot all the cattle will come around and stand under the shadow of those walls keep cool and all the little birds live in those places and all of a sudden all them little birds for some unknown reason now you know what we said the other day about little birds some unknown reason they all took off and they went out and didn't come back to their nest they went out in the field and they set in the trees wherever they could get right out on the ground the cattle wouldn't come around the Sheep wouldn't come around they stayed right in the field hugged up against one another it's a good way to do they knew that something was going to happen then all of a sudden an earthquake talk place and shook the walls down the fences down and everything else then the little birds begin to come back didn't come back for 3 or four days then begin to come back they said well the earthquakes must be over now the birds are coming back why don't you believe that the same God that could make them birds and cattle and sheep in the days of Noah go into the ark he's still the same God that can make him fly to safety is that right now let me say something brother there's something fixing to happen and all these big old ecclesiastical walls are going to collapse and go right back over and agree because you're going to do it as certain as I'm standing here there's an image to that Beast it's as certain as I'm standing you're in this nation tuing according to the word of the law amen listen when you feel that little funny feeling you get away from them walls get away you'll die there don't do it come out of it get away from all this stuff flead to safety as quick as you can ask God for Mercy don't just take some well my mother was Methodist so I suppose I'll be my papa was bad this I'll be don't you do that don't you don't you take any chance I don't care how simple and humble it seems It's a word of the Lord you flee to Jesus Christ just as

from above our father who sees our needs he ministers to those needs and we thank him for it amen if we come expecting we will get what we are expecting amen that's what the prophet told us and as I looked into that here a year or so ago or earlier few months ago it really changed my attitude towards a service you know sometimes a brother might be going in the direction I might see it that way I might not but I'm already there and if the word of God is being preached what I do is I say Lord there's something in this service for me and I believe you're going to give me what I have need of it's about my attitude it's not about what attitude is up here amen so that has helped me to serve better and to worship him better amen so it's good to see each of you see the Hansen's here this this morning got bless them our fine friends and um uh brother um brother Glenn McHugh and his dear wife back there I kind of I was reading a quote about the Sabino what was it on the earthquake and that trip and I looked over and he was sitting in the service and I made mention of it and I just assume everybody knows who you are brother Glenn but if you could stand to your feet just for a moment I hate to do that this brother Glenn Muse that's brother Doug Muse's brother and he's probably going to punch me after the Ser doing that give the Lord a hand of Praise And I do that because he was an eyewitness and I was reading a quote I didn't even think about it and then I looked I was like brother Glenn were you there he was like yeah I was there he's in the pictures and so after the service someone came up to me and said brother Israel there was somebody in our church that was in the so being at Sunset I said yes so we just take it for granted so God bless you we're honored that that we know you amen we can shake hands amen with you and uh praise the lord we had a wonderful meeting ministers meeting there on uh Saturday in Phoenix the Phoenix Tabernacle there was 60 brothers or so and one of the things that uh there was many things I was so blessed brother George I'm sure that was one of the best ones I thought me too yeah and brother Josh was there and one of the things that one of the brothers got up as I'm I'm going to introduce brother Bill right now he greeted all the preachers and ministers and that just really touched my heart had he how he recognized that and I thought well you know what we really should um thank the Lord for the the the preachers that they they um they have little complexes preachers do and all of us do actually and so let's just say Amen about that all right and so I was thinking I how I appreciate our brother George who handles the word and lives the life and brother Josh and they are ministers in our midst brother bonsa as well he just was married and he has his Affairs to deal with with his wife and so we want to always keep them in prayer and I was thinking about that I should we should pray for them and pray for one another and thank the Lord for them with double honor actually says the scripture so we have a good friend of mine brother um Bill lingar he is originally from Sacramento so you know he's good people and uh but I met him after he had moved to Boise Ado and when I went he he was having services in his basement and that's where I met one of my best friends on the earth that was sister Kay k Barber was under his Ministry he was her pastor there and um it was maybe 1992 or 93 I think it was 1993 we went there and we had a service and visited them and sister K just made a lasting impression on me she shook my hand you know that firm handshake that she had she looked me in the eyes said are you married brother like no well I'm going to pray that God sends you a good wife and that's how she introduced herself I was like okay who is this sister and so she gave me her contact information and then her she said I have two sons in college I want you to write them and that was brother Samuel uh Barbara and Michael but me and Samuel hit it off very well but me and sister Kay hit it off better than any other Barber I know so she was my friend my good good friend and by extension good friends to our brother bill and his dear wife is with us as well and she her her brother Larry KH was every church needs a Larry KH in it oh yeah and he um the Lord called him home here a couple uh year or so ago but I don't want to talk about it right now but this is his dear sister and um Sister Sister um um Barbara why don't you stand and we recognize her this is Brother Bill's wife God bless

I we go way back when I first moved to Arizona uh I was under the tutorship of brother Carpenter and uh I was greener than the grass brother but he was patient with me and he helped to develop me and so I just want to greet all of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we're very happy to be here uh those that know my daughter Anna lingar she used to live up in Mesa when she was is going to the university her now is name now is uh Anna Elder she sends her greetings all to you so let's open our Bibles this morning a very familiar scripture Matthew chap 5 and verse 16 let your light shine okay let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven to let your light shine the first thing you got to do is you got to have the light and there's only one light amen amen and that's the Lord Jesus Christ amen and if he's in you and shining through you he's going to make his written word live that's correct and be a testimony that he is shining through you that's correct amen amen and so we want to now turn to 2 Corinthians 5:116 and my question for us this morning is when this light shines through you what impact does it have on others what what's the outcome what's the result what's the fruit and 2 Corinthians I believe gives us the answer 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and let's read at verse 16 wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh y though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth we know him no more the first way you know the Lord Jesus is by his blood then after the blood you know him by the Holy Ghost you know him by the power of the spirit you know him by that Spirit making the word live exactly in line with the light of the hour that's correct amen amen amen and so he says here uh and all things are of God who has re reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation what did he give us the ministry of reconciliation correct amen now notice verse 19 to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world un himself not imputing their trespasses un them and has committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for Christ amen and though God did besee you by us exactly by us exactly amen we pray you in Christ Steed exactly be ye reconciled amen and so God was in the Christ reconciling you can you say Amen reconciling you to the light yes amen now if the light is in you you have the ministry of reconciliation to reconcile others to the light that's correct amen that's correct so my subject is the light of reconciliation all right do you have a need is there somebody that you know that needs to be reconciled it may be a friend it may be a family whatever the barrier is call their name put your stand up for them today and we'll just pray a simple prayer come on there's got to be somebody that you know there's barriers there and that's the devil's work but you know what your work is you're the light of reconciliation praise the Lord let us pray Heavenly Father we just commit these hands and the needs under their hands the hearts to you heavenly father let us take our position in the army of light let us shine this light and pull down the strongholds and bring the blessings and the honor and the peace that you paid for in Jesus name amen you may be seated GL to his name so I I I want to uh I want to speak on the light of reconciliation and I want to come to this main point and that is this now I'm going to start my timer right now oops okay by his cross you become the light and by your cross you Shine the Light let's say it again by his cross I became the light brother George by my cross I Shine the Light okay so reconciliation means to remove the barriers praise God praise God remove the barriers the barriers something caused a separation between two or more persons and so there's a barrier and when there's a barrier the relationship is not right corre the fellowship is broken okay something caused a separation correct it may have been an attitude it may have been just a word it may have been the deed it may have been an attitude a word or a deed and one of the hardest barriers is when I cause a misunderstanding and I didn't mean to that hurts that hurts and so there's you know there's a lot of reasons for barriers and we know that Satan is behind it all because that's his business that's his business and so something causes the separation and we know that the greatest separation of all is the separation between God and man and God is the light that's right God has symbolized as the Tree of Life the bread of life the seed of life the Waters of life but what he is he is the light of eternal life that's what he is in his substance okay amen and so we know by this message that it was blood that caused the separation it was blood that caused the separation of our sinful life and then when blood caused the separation it then put a barrier and that barrier was the life that came through the blood which is the life of the devil right Satan entered the human race through a sexual seed based upon Eve believing the LIE is that right and so it's a blood it's a blood that caused the separation and then by the life of that blood that nature we were all born with it's a barrier it's a barrier to get in along some people were more H than others I'm just preaching now right some people are more hry than others you know when I was growing up you know and you walking by the hall and me at school if you looked at me wrong I'd say what are you looking at yeah I wasn't born again all right okay I wasn't I wasn't born again the problem is is that I had a complex all all right I had a complex and the only way I knew to defend myself was to fight that's right that's the way I grew up yes sir all right and so but I won most of the fights because it's not the size of the dog it's the it's the fight of the dog in the you know and so anyway we find out that there's many things that lead to a barriers but the Great Barrier was the blood that was seed in the human race opened the door for Satan right amen right amen which means then the only way that can reconcile us back that can get our relationship back with almighty God is by his own blood amen his own blood reconciled us his own blood removed the barrier of the old life get it now remove the barrier over the life and then released his life and now I got a relationship with my heavenly father now the Father of Lights is manifesting itself in me praise the Lord and now I have I have a relationship with the father I have relationship and a fellowship with the father and I also can have a same relationship and fellowship with those who claim to be a part of this family of light are you in the family of light then we're kin folks are we not we're related am amen amen so it was a corrupt seed that Satan used to enter the human race but it was a royal seed that God used Amen to restore our relationship with the pillar of fire of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm so thankful for it and we know that the great symbol of this separation was the veil in the old Temple it was a it was a it signified that man and the light that Pillar of Fire that was back behind that veil in the old Temple it was signifying that man did not have a right to enter the presence of that light which was eternal life that's right that's right he didn't have a right right he was a sinner light and darkness have no fellowship and so that was a very classic uh symbol of the separation and and uh we know that by the atonement right for sin exactly right by the atonement for sin and the high priest he was symbolizing how that someday by Blood amen we're going to be able to to go back through the veil and stand in the presence of our heavenly father Yes amen amen so Paul called this the middle wall of partition right and that separated man from the presence of eternal life right now listen it not only separated man from that light but it separated man and man that Veil separated man and man not only God and man but the Jews and the Gentiles they had no Fellowship that's correct now think about this that's correct they had no Fellowship see because the Jews thought that they were of the right seed they were the natural Seed of Abraham amen and not only that they had circumcision they had the Sabbath day they had a special diet they had a the feast and they worship at the temple and you know what what else it was all under the message of Moses the prophet they had the prophet's message and so in their eyes Sir they were more righteous all right come on now than the Gentiles yes sir there there was no basis of of of Fellowship they had the their Prophet the messenger of the hour and they were looking for something by that Prophet yes they were looking for the Messiah they were looking for the word to be fulfilled and when he came right among them when the written word became the Living Word they were blind to it amen amen that's good brother amen and so they become Sinners hello sure they become Sinners a worse sinner than the woman at the well a worse sinner than the woman taking in adultery they brought to Jesus a worse sinner than the woman that was washing his feet The Prostitute they were religious Sinners that's right and we got a lot of religious sinners in the message today and we're not saying it to rebuke you we're saying it to open your eyes that's good brother yes sir amen it was religious sin now why is religious sin so dangerous because it's blind to its own condition those prostitutes those harlots they knew what they were that's right they knew what they were but they didn't see anything that can reconcile them to God until they met this man called Jesus amen glory thank you Jesus Hallelujah thank you Jesus is there anybody else that can say that he saved you thank you God hallelujah praise His name well you know I got to seal Small Voice so do I it controls me it tells me when to cry tells me when to shout tells me when to speak tells me when to be quiet it controls me right so that's not an excuse to be called informal cuz brother brandom never taught any cold formal religion that's Catholicism there's not a one of us amen that somebody knocked on your door and had a check for a million dollars and paid off all your bills that you wouldn't be happy and you can buy the car you want Hallelujah yeah yeah you be saying hallelujah yeah you be in the door doing your own little jig that's right so don't sit in the skit of the scornful when David is dancing and somebody else is rejoicing because God has reconciled them amen amen praise the Lord I'm way off my notes Oh Glory Hallelujah yeah so then their eyes they were following the message the prophet Moses and what a mighty prophet he was Vindicated by the pillar of fire but now they're religious Sinners and so now Paul comes along he knows what that was all about so he says all have sinned and come short of the glory there's none righteous no not a one amen we've all come sin and we come short of that shakina Glory that's behind that Veil amen so who are you what's your attitude what's your words what's your actions all of sin and come short of the glory of the light of his glory yeah nevertheless in the old Temple God was sh as a shadow of good things to come and he foreshadowed it by the high priest that when he took the blood he could go Beyond the Veil and he would enter in now but when he went beyond the veil he had to do something yes he did to be able to stand in the presence of the pillar of fire he had to sprinkle The Mercy Seat seven times with blood okay now here's where we're going to go just a little deeper okay now we're living in the age let me remind you the water in this age is not up to the ankles neither is it to the knees neither is it to the waist it's a River of Life and an outpouring of the Holy Ghost that the rainbow trout love to swim in amen amen so we should go deep okay but we also understand as p and Discerning the flock some sometimes the people are here and this brother's here the sister's here and we've got to adjust yes amen and you have to adjust that's part of your maturity excuse me is to adjust and to recognize we're not all at the same level but if we're all born of the light amen it's coming up amen amen so in this old Temple he walked in on the day of atonement and he sprinkled The Mercy Seat yes amen now that Mercy Seat was a lid over the ark okay because in the ark was the law by which God condemned him but now listen to this Mercy Seat this Mercy Seat was made of solid gold solid gold this Mercy Seat was solid gold and it forhad that someday gold and blood was going to be mingled together that's yes sir someday oh GL gold and blood was going to be mingled together and it was going to make a way for me need to stand back in the presence of the pillar of fire and so he was showing right someday gold that's correct the deity that's correct of the Living Word that's correct MDC that Heavenly Dove that could not die can you say amen he could not die he was eternal but someday that deity that gold was going to become flesh as a lamb the son of man now whenever I say the son of man I am speaking of this man right here amen the only man ever born of a woman perfect and the only man that will ever be born of a woman perfect that's correct but he produced a blood and a life that can reconcile us back to a perfect man if you'll walk in the light amen so how many want to just stay partial how many want to be reconciled all the way back yes amen amen amen and so why did they bring Jesus gold see because why he was deity yes he was he was the word made flesh and he came in service to make a sacrifice he did that could rent The Veil on Calvary and then by water blood and spirit Hallelujah rent The Veil off your heart put the Holy Ghost in make me a relationship now I he can call me the Father of Lights amen and the father of lights and the children of light love to fellowship with the Family of Light that's right amen now the family of light they might wear this brand they might wear that brand they might wear this brand but let me tell you what they have in common they have in common the blood tag the token amen the blood tag brother mam sent meant that that that heer the only way could be on that that that that graze out there it had blood in it that said it was a heer and the Holy Ghost in you tells you the blood has been applied amen amen amen amen that's the sign the blood has been applied and so we find out then that the gold of the Living Word yeah the only way he could become the bleeding word have you ever heard brother RAM use that word the only way he could become the bleeding word was to be made flesh and when he was made flesh and hung on Calvary then the blood and the gold mingled together and Saul said who are you Lord he says I'm Jesus praise the Lord what was he now that Pillar of Fire that light that white light had now become the light of the lamb and out of that light was coming a rainbow amen a rainbow a covenant amen that through seven Church ages amen God was gonna make a way for his children to walk back into the pillar of fire amen amen hallelujah glory to God so gold is the Living Word to become the bleeding word that would make a way to fulfill Jesus's promise what was his promise what did he say okay look this is the hour that these things are meant to unfold okay what did he say Amen that where I am you'll be you'll be also where was he in the pillar of fire at sunset Mountain Jerusalem Tucson where did Brother brandham go back into into the pillar of fire yes or no amen unveiling of God hear the tape Mighty God unveil hear the tape so you see there's being born of the light there's walking in the light yes and then there's entering back into that Pillar of Fire that's the promise of the age that's what I'm looking for that's what I'm living for and you say well brother lingar I don't see it well I'll pray for you amen I'll pray for you see see the the ministry the the gift of the spirit I can't give you Revelation but I can help you what to look for right I can help you what to look for I can point these things out to you but if you're afraid of the truth then then then that's on you see people are afraid of the truth it's like I said in Africa how many loves the Lord Jesus everybody loves the Lord Jesus until he begins to reveal himself as the truth of justification a little more sanctification a little more baptism Holy Ghost and the Luther felling off the Methodist fell off the Pentecostals fell off and here he is in the evening light where a man a prophet has gone into the pillar of fire and has come out with the ministry of adoption amen yes sir I'll just say this when a when when Adam Adam was an amateure God Adam did not need a new birth there was no such a thing as a new birth Adam was created he was perfect he had the light in him he had perfect love and he had the power of his father the power of a Creator that's an amature God that's not a born again son that's an amateure God but a born again son or daughter will take you back to that exactly yes it does yes it does are you with me y amen amen amen who art thou Lord I'm Jesus I'm the bleeding word and now I'm being manifested as the light of the Lamb you get get it the light of the Lamb it's his life of the Lamb that comes in you by the blood of the Lamb that manifests that nature that can be led that nature that will grow that nature that'll give the wool it's the blood that does that through the spirit all right so by his cross of the bleeding word we are reconciled back to the light yes amen amen and by your cross you shine the light of reconciliation that's what we're coming to by your cross you shine the light of reconcil ilation now what is the substance of this light okay I'm going to go into something very specific that only this messenger could tell us what is the substance of this of this light if if if if there was a candle you could tell me what the substance of a candle light was or electric light but what is the substance of this eternal light that we are reconciled to and he makes a statement in Revelations 4 and listen to this number two that great Jewel he's talking about this man right here the Lord Jesus Christ what was it it was perfect amen it was at the age of 33 and A2 years old when God put it through the big bumping machine when when he took it over there and began to shape it up he cut it he mashed it he bruised it he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him it was and with his stripes we were healed amen what did God do to that perfect man there's only one of them in the worlden only one in the world am amen and that was him and God chiseled him off here he was wounded for our transgression because I was a sinner that was me amen I was a hippie brother I was a hippie amen I went through the university high on marijuana yeah and I was a be student okay but I was a sinner I was a rock and roll hippie I was a sinner but there was something in me this whole year of my senior year was calling me nobody was witnessing to me nobody was talking to me but amen there was a gene in here my father was calling me home Amen brother yes sir now you see I look a little different right I don't look like a hippie anymore I don't act like a hippie because I was a sinner he let the rainbow light there it is he let the rainbow light of his seven Church ages flash upon me to know he was wounded for my transgressions that's the light we're talking about now listen by his cross you were reconciled to that rainbow light and by my cross I'm going to shine that rainbow light I'm going to shine that rainbow light as the light of reconciliation and sister you're going to Rejoice praise the Lord amen if you know the truth it'll set you free it does you don't have to feel any power you don't have to feel any power that woman that thought she had seven devils and then another woman said you had five and she said well what happened to the other two and when she met the prophet brother B said you don't have any of it you're just in mental pause what she began to relax she got her diet back and he begin to tell her he saw her house and this and this said just go home sit on the lap of your husband love him up put some uh cherry pie in the oven whatever it is it's okay Hallelujah Satan has lied to you God and just a simple truth Jesus exactly Amen brother amen praise His name Hallelujah by his cross yes amen by his cross I am reconciled back to this rainbow light and now by my cross right I'm going to shine this rainbow light and that's what we want to make real to you amen because a cross is an emblem of suffering and shame is it not it's an emblin of suffering and shame amen but it's God's provided way now before let me see here yes before we go any further I want to drop this in and uh that is this every Born Again Child of the Light yes is there any here amen there's some here praise the Lord every Born Again Child of the Light has a part in the ministry of light that's correct amen absolutely every one of us absolutely exactly that is born of the light that's correct has a part in the ministry of light that's correct you are commanded by Jesus to shine your light amen and it's a rainbow light oh glory and it's the light that brings reconciliation does by a little bit of his faith and his virtue and his knowledge and his Temperance and his patience and his godliness and some brotherly kindness it'll bring reconciliation and pull down all the strongholds in Jesus name yes it Willl amen very good yes it will amen glory to his name every Born Again believer Hallelujah has a part in the ministry of reconciliation correct amen or amen not amen you believe your Bible yes amen you believe your Prophet let's see what Moses said there you go the samna age and every person in the church has an individual Ministry correct and that individual Ministry goes together with the rest of the ministry corre to edify the body of Christ amen that's true that's why that's why I I've been going to brother Nathan's for the last year there's some find people in there would you believe that man they look like Christians they act like Christians they Worship the Lord they get in the spirit and here I'm going through a hurricane not a storm a hurricane and I get in there and I feel the love of God I feel what I need in there amen and I'm not only there to draw I'm there to give that's and maybe I gave a little too much too soon because you know be all right it'll be all right yes sir they get used to it yeah you know what I'm like brother Caleb Duram he's just being who he is the pastor from from up there at Flagstaff that's not his style okay right different personalities right correct yeah there's four different uh anointings that is in the person of Jesus Christ the the lion the ox the man and the eagle hallelujah amen thank you Jesus prais name see we got to be able to bear with one another's peculiarities you know amen we want I want you to be patient with me like God is patient with you yeah amen very good amen and so now let me say this we all have a part in the ministry of reconciliation but we all don't have the same position that's correct okay we don't okay foot legs hands that's correct and in the head there's an eye and that eye is not my position I'll let you figure that out okay it's not my that's not my position but by that eye I begin to see things that the church could never see before that's right is that right yes amen amen I begin to see things in the Bible I begin to see things in his own life him manifesting what he's teaching exactly he's not just teaching the stature of a perfect man he's manifesting the stature of a perfect man but you say but brother bam he made mistakes he had his wife tell him on the phone I'm not here you know and and he lost the feeling for the people so what amen amen are you going to make mistakes do the prophets have like passion exactly did they get angry did they get upset it's part of the humanity but it doesn't stop God's work of reconciliation what he starts he finishes hallelujah amen amen where was that somebody said Hallelujah where was that at hallelujah oh oh oh I see you now brother thank you Jesus I love the Lord Jesus do you love him I'm going to test you do you love me you think you could love me a little bit how about it brother George I love you brother we're going to be friends right amen praise the Lord yes sir he he was at brother Nathan's Bri preaching and my I sure enjoyed it and he says I'm not too far north of Tennessee to get an amen am I Hallelujah yes sir all right so we all have a part in the ministry Let It Shine amen you just can't say I believe the message of Moses and that's my identification no amen you've got to let your light shine amen and and you don't have to go out and and and look to let it let shine you just have to go out and be your DayDay business and have be who you are yes sir and you'll find an opportunity here you'll find a situation there and it'll unfold you are the lighten well well why did my car break down and this and this and this and this guy come down here and oh here's a book there you go see it works it works doesn't it sir I got to get going brother Israel in John 828 Jesus said when you have lifted up the son of man that was on the cross right then you'll know that I am he amen Oh Glory that's that's good yeah that's the King James version you'll know that I am here he but the Greek version says when the son of man is lifted up you'll know that I am Oh Glory there a subtle difference isn't it amen you'll know that I am and I am was that Pillar of Fire that came down in the burning bush and anointed Moses I said he anointed Moses to be what the light of reconciliation to Israel Hallelujah to Israel they had a problem they had a barrier between them and the promised land and it was Pharaoh but he came in the power of an amateur God yes he did yes he did and he plagued the house of Pharaoh Pharaoh saw the plagues amen but Israel saw the token the light of reconciliation being reflected through Moses yes or no amen and they went free amen the barrier was removed Let My People Go praise the Lord Pharaoh experienced the power of God by the plagues Israel experienced it by the token he was foreshadowing that by the blood of the lamb every barrier that Satan put in your way will be paid for and the life of the holy spirit is going to shine through you to make it manifest I like that amen I just realized that right yeah the blood removes the barrier the blood pays for it now let the light shine and start removing and claiming what he paid for if it's sickness faith and virtue amen amen so that was the first Exodus in the second Exodus The Great I Am appeared on the scene again did he not yes the light came down on the Jordan River and this time there was a prophet like to Moses amen it was the Lord Jesus it was the son of man and he had the real blood of God he had the real blood of the Lamb that could rent The Veil amen they Moses they put the blood on the door amen his blood rent The Veil and opened the door back to the light and the life of God amen amen and so the token that his blood manifested was the earnest of your reconciliation exactly amen now take that in brother yes amen it was the earnest of your reconciliation you're born of the light to walk in the light how can you walk in the light if you're not born in the light you can't do it it's just an intellectual conception okay then you walk in the light what all the way back to the pillar of fire yes Amen to be placed yes amen all right amen so the second Exodus The Great I Am came down on the Jordan River to manifest the real blood of the Lamb that could rent The Veil and remove the barrier of sin in our life remove it and not just reflect a shadow but reflect the token the earnest of our reconciliation that's what the new birth is is the earnest of your reconciliation the light has shined in your soul okay your fleshly body it's just as a cockabur it's just as sinful as it was the day you were born it hasn't changed it at all but what it does is it has the power to bring it subject to the word that's correct that's correct amen amen that is true first Exodus was the blood of a natural lamb right the second Exodus Jesus came down with the light of reconciliation by his own blood by his own cross and he rent The Veil off of our heart the barrier the old man the darkness his blood rent that Veil and the light Shone in that little seed that was laying in in there what was it my father had a conception amen that light penetrated the veil and struck that seed and there was a conception now there's a relationship now there's fellowship with my heavenly father amen by his word praise the Lord amen now in the Third Exodus we are privileged to be living in the Third Exodus and three is the number of perfection so in this Exodus you and I have the opportunity to be made perfect we weren't born perfect but we can be made perfect amen and when we're made perfect Jesus Christ is glorified in us why would he be glorified in us well who made you perfect whose light are you shining right amen how did that body get to be his glorious body that's right amen when this body is changed you know that that's what symbolizes crowning him king of kings and Lord of lords that's exactly what it is because it's his life in you has come to maturity and the power of that creative spoken word amen amen that's the age we're living in I look for it every day I believe it you know Sarah she had hard time with it but Abraham was sitting in a different place he was sitting in the door the tent door and he was looking out he was watching he was waiting amen so am I I know the Lord's coming in this day it's been 60 years 50 years I've been waiting but I'm looking for him today and I'm looking for him tomorrow and all the signs of time is telling me he's coming and I want to be ready all right so the Third Exodus no matter how many denominational barriers Satan has raised amen by the Catholic denomination by the Protestant denomination by the religious Sinners under Moses's message no matter how many barriers he has raised God made a promise it will be light in the evening time and there's there's nothing going to stop it amen amen amen and and and the denominational barri is what did it do it separated the people from the Holy Ghost did it not it gave them a wafer it gave them a handshake right it gave them sensation a false evidence it gave him a false baptism amen all kinds of barriers but in the evening time it shall be light amen and where does the pillar of fire appear in the evening time publicly first in the water amen why straight is the gate and narrow is the way God's restoring the first step you got to get it right and that's acts 238 so it separated all these barriers us from the light of God and it separated the people from the others Oneness over here and The Trinity over here and look at it now well I worship this way I go to this church in the message you worship here you go to this church of the message okay let me tell you something friend all right if you want to act that way that's your choice yeah it my choice is I've gone around the world I've Fellowship with every group in the message well aren't you afraid of fleas no because when he's sealed in Satan sealed out that's right can Satan tempt me yeah can he battle me yeah right but what God started in me God's going to finish amen so amen if you're going to let your light shine you're going to have to overcome some of those denominational spirits that have come out in The Exodus because God is going to test you and see your reaction because we've been taught on the tapes the message brother random not only lived it not only taught it he lived it he stood between the Oneness and The Trinity yes he did yes he did yes he did amen so the evening light is going to shine and what's it going to do it's going to restore the word of reconciliation yes amen the Holy Ghost moves according to his word the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ no eternal hell all all of these different things all the building material it takes to build the body of Christ into the statue of a perfect man the evening light message is going to reveal it and he shined it amen he was an example amen amen that no barrier could stand in his way because of why the presence of Jesus Christ the presence of Jesus Christ whose presence is with you right is it Jesus Christ what is that like is it Jesus Christ amen amen for 6,000 years God's plan is I want to reunite God and man as one and here we are in this age when it's coming to pass and we see it materializing in William Mary and brandom and the people want to separate it who's the temple of God we are we are not flowers not animals man is the Temple of Light amen it's man that God wants to reflect the light of life through exactly amen amen and so in the evening time the sun would come out to reflect the light of the cross through the messenger of Malachi 4 lifted him up by the Seven Seals and when he broke the Seven Seals what did he do he lifted the veil off the Bible amen he lifted the veil off to the Bible so we could see God's truth of how to unite with him he lifted the veil off of my heart and put the Holy Ghost in so now I can see my position I am not happy being a born again Son of God I want to be an amateur God a fully mature Christian you say well how can you do that by the Light that's in me if I bear my cross which were coming to now then I can Shine the Light of reconciliation and as as you reconcile others you're reconciling yourself amen so watch let me let me share this with you through the seven Church ages they had the earnest of reconciliation that light what they have they had a rainbow light but it was only a half a circle right when you look at a rainbow from the earth you can only see a half a circle how many can say amen amen see and that represented the earnest of our Recon ilation being born that is the Son of God light but in the evening time light when you get up into the heavens where this man was taken up then it's the complete circle of light it's the complete rainbow light amen that rent The Veil off the Bible rent The Veil off your heart and rent the veil off of the flesh to see behind the veil of William brandom the power of an amateur God amen amen to whose Glory read second Thessalonians to the glory of Jesus Christ do you think I made myself a perfect man do you think you made yourself a perfect man you're are his workmanship Amen to him be the glory amen amen all right let's move on so here's a key to the message brother George he he does a wonderful job he he talks about God doesn't change right uh he he talks about Amos 3:7 there's the other key that God works in threes is that right absolutely all of these keys are critical to understanding the plan of God so the key to the message in this age here's another key all right it's the keys that Peter had okay the half of circle the half of rainbow light is the earnest of your salvation that's all they had through seven Church ages but in the evening light the complete circle of this rainbow light the complete Covenant to manifest the token not as the earnest of salvation but to manifest it in the full stature of a perfect man okay so if you had that picture here Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and the Capstone comes down amen and the Capstone manifests the full stature of the perfect man which is the token and it comes don't let this scare you please it comes not as Son of God but but a son of man it's a son of man reflecting the perfect life of Jesus Christ the son of man how did he perfect You by his blood and his life yes amen amen amen all right how many remember so we're going to we're going to hit this now clo how many remember the story brother Brown tells about the dunard cafe when he went to eat there it was a Holiness atmosphere and they were closed on Sunday okay all right I'm going to dramatize that a little bit from me memory to help with the point and this is my takeaway okay when I heard the tapes when I listened to the message this is my impact amen am I free to tell you the impact it had on me amen amen amen amen and so he on Sunday the dunkard resturant was closed the Holiness so he had to go to another Cafe to eat and when he did it was a worldly atmosphere he saw the the youth they were in sin he saw the law they were in sin he saw the seniors and that that older lady there her hair was purple and all painted up real shorts flabby and Dr and drinking with those those two men he saw that and you know what happened it upset him it upset him it absolutely upset him and he said Lord how can you stand a look at this why don't you just condemn it did he do it yeah he did why God's given us an example amen look look at Elisha amen when he when he came to to to to help Jehoshaphat and and what was that King ahab's son's name rabom or Jobo one of those guys right and he saw him and Elisha was upset right he was flat out upset and he said I wouldn't even look at you if it wasn't for this righteous man and so brother brandham was upset it absolutely upset him because he was in this atmosphere now he's in this atmosphere Lord how can you look at this why don't you just destroy it and start over and brother Ram said the angel that was with him said come aside I know amen and he went over in the corner yeah amen and he showed him a vision and he saw a world and around this world was a rainbow around the world was a rainbow and that rainbow acted as the blood of the Covenant amen and all the sins that come up they could not get through that rainbow light amen and then and and then when he saw the the the sins hitting Jesus remember he he would shake and he would Pat himself in the blood and he would write on the book pardon and brother Ram says is that the sins of the world he said no that's your sins amen amen that's your sins what's the takeaway don't condemn her go Shine the Light of reconciliation amen did you get that don't condemn her amen you you want to be reconciled by the light now go and Shine the Light to the reconciliation to her yeah it looks bad amen yeah she was bound yeah she was deep in sin but it just takes somebody with the light of reconciliation and the love of God to reach out and touch him that's right Reach Out And Touch him sir not if uh you don't come to my fellowship you know it doesn't work friends I I my my position is you Fellowship wherever you want you do what you want but come on let's start acting like the example that William Mariam brandom gave us yes sir let's project the light let's try to win those that are opposing us that are against us and so watch young people I want to say they emphasize this next part to you especially to help you because I should have learned this a lot younger in my life as a Christian okay by your cross you die once to sin I'm Sorry by his cross you die once to sin how many heard me by you by his cross you die once the sin by your cross you die daily okay by his cross you die once to sin by your cross you die daily so when you die once to sin the veil is rent off your heart the old man is crucified and the light shines in the new man raises up and that's in your soul amen but in your spirit and in your mind in that spirit and in their mind is where the Battle of light and darkness is taking place the Battle of light and darkness is in your mind and your flesh it's still dark okay the sinful impulses so don't go by that feeling amen amen that doesn't Define you no it doesn't okay and so in your mind and this is why you have to pray this is why you have to hear the word this is why you have to meditate on the word and read your Bible and come to church and stay in the atmosphere and and not only just think about yourself but put yourself out create an atmosphere here and here so people can get Faith people can get healed the church can get blessed amen Shine Your Light amen amen amen but in your spirit you have to Die daily because you're in the kingdom of darkness but you're not of the the darkness amen everywhere we look everything we see dark dark dark see and then Satan comes and and and uh he has an your old book of your old life it it's a counterfeit because the other one doesn't exist amen amen amen do not let him amen anymore accuse you by your old book God said it does not exist it does not exist that's true amen that's true that's true and so he continually wants you to look back to what you were because he doesn't want you to be what Jesus died for you to be amen all right amen so then in my mind I'm dying daily in my mind I'm fighting the battle right well the battle's change the situations change some of it you just knock it off knock it off knock it off right right right we see and other times there's something comes up you have a burden okay you know of a situation you know of a barrier and maybe in the family you know the barrier maybe in the local church you know the barrier maybe be between churches or a friend somebody that you care about right it cares it matters to you right and it's a burden to you amen so what are you going to do with that burden what does God want you to do he wants you to shine in the light of reconciliation amen amen well you say well brother lingar in this situation in this situation I I I I don't know what to do I've been praying about it and I don't know what to do sure okay just keep praying amen just keep praying and just put it on the Lord and believe okay I don't know how I don't know when but now watch that's correct watch now you're you're it's a burden right and even yourself suffering because of it can you say Amen so it's a cross to you it's a cross to you it's Agony it's a burden to you it's something on your heart and you're praying about it and maybe a long time has gone by but one day one day the Lord gives you the knowledge of the root cause and the solution let's see there's Faith there's virtue there's knowledge right amen Holy Ghost knowledge right amen exactly praise God your wife said honey finally after all this time the Lord has showed me what caused this and what the solution for it is praise the Lord and your husband said hold your peace oops hold your peace hold my peace I've been waiting for this answer for a long time and God has showed me and he has showed you can you say Amen I'm not making this up he showed you but the Lord quickened your husband he says honey hold your peace hold my peace after your knowledge comes what Temperance Temperance hold your tongue all right hold your peace God showed you the solution but you've got to wait now amen and so you need you need that knowledge what's the next One Pastor yes I know him from a long time so you know he he can afterwards Temperance right hold your peace how long how long patience patience patience right do you see see the virtues the virtues come by the cross they come by suffering they come by Agony they come by travail not your will his will be done right amen okay amen and so then and so then you've been patient okay we know the answer we we're holding our peace we're patient what are we waiting for for God's time and all of a sudden one day you're not even thinking about it and you're in the room and it's the right place and it's the right time and the Lord tell quickens you to speak and you just say it so mellow so softly you know uh did you ever think about this and this and this and this and boom the light turns on is that the way it happens amen that's the way it's happened for me that's the way it can happen for you that's what the light of reconciliation is amen it's very hard excuse me it's very hard when you know you've had a positive attitude to somebody and you get a negative back it's very hard when you've said good things about somebody and you know they're saying not so good things about you amen it's very hard when you're doing good for others and they're not doing good for you I mean let's be honest it's painful it hurts yes it does it absolutely hurts but I'm going to tell you it's normal can we all can we all give a smile little facelift right now it's normal Satan wants to make you to think it's not normal it's normal this is the path of a Christian yes it is yes it is amen amen so knowledge Temperance patience and then all of a sudden God inspires you without even thinking about it amen to speak that's the kind of word word I'd like to see the church speak amen that kind of word God has to get you in control of the Seven Virtues before you're going to get the authority of the spoken creative word how can he trust you with the spoken creative word when your life is not in the control of the Seven Virtues that's right that's what it's all about I I I believe in the spoken credible we've seen the five indications of it amen but when God took brother brandham into it he goes he didn't even know the scripture the scripture puzzled him right and then and then when you you watch how he describes him speaking the word who's talking to me what who is that it's not being presumptuous no it's God taking control of his bride it's you surrendering through the difficulty of the hard trials okay look now I'm going to close with this and I've been one hour and four minutes and I just ask for a little Grace because my time is up but this will bring it all together for you what what motivates a born again Christian to endure hardness as a good soldier of the Cross to suffer afflictions what motivates you the reason is and I'm here's this is a new symbol but it's it's just another symbol of adoption the reason is you are anointed for a kingly position you're anointed for a kingly position now we'll bring this out that's and and that is to sit in his throne that's correct as he sat in the father's Throne right and that's the promise of Revelations 3:21 to him that overcometh will sit with me in my throne in The Great I Am as I sat down in The Great I Am amen and here's what brother brandom said about that verb adom if we suffer for Christ and his word we will reign with him for he is the word if we suffer for him and his word we will reign with him in his word in other words you're going to come to the top of the pyramid all right am all right and so it's just another symbol of a another symbol of of adoption okay that God has anointed us with the spirit of adoption when you are born again you're Anointed with the spirit of adoption right that you're predestinated to adoption when you're when you're born again you've got the Spirit of glory amen you're anointed to suffer to be crowned in glory all the different symbols see the Bible's open to me see no matter what what epistle I read I can see it because I see the pattern yes amen I see the pattern all right look and so all of this God foreshadowed by David God had Samuel the prophet to call David okay how did he call him well he offered up the blood he made a blood sacrifice how did he call you he offered up his own blood the blood begin to speak to you amen Jesus begin to call you and you know in the prayer line so many he makes it so simple he says yeah that's him talking to you right remember he that brother George brother yeah that's him talking to you yeah yeah yeah I was waiting for you you you hear that on tell yeah that was him talking to you yes that was him see so through the blood he calls you and and then when you answer the call by the blood he anoints you and pours the oil on you for your position and he poured the oil on David to anoint him for a kingly position David was just a good shepherd He was the Good Shepherd that put his life on the line for the Sheep but now he's being anointed to be the chief Shepherd of Israel the Chief Shepherd of Israel the king of Israel which means he wears the crown he's got the throne so he's got the power of the king he's got the Dominion of the throne amen and that's what it is when we will get placed into Christ Jesus we will be joint hirs with him amen this is the age it's coming it's already unfolded because he does nothing except he shows you first first by his prophet and he took him into the The Cloud of Glory right and where did he do it in the Coronado Forest which means what the crowning Place amen the crowning place if you got up and you know did a little dance on that one I wouldn't blame you I I did one too when I saw that praise the Lord look and so he foreshadowed into David he called him by the blood and he anointed him by the spirit for a kingly position Amen to be the chief Shepherd of Israel praise the Lord now let me make sure I get this right okay and uh and so the question is the question is is then why why did David why did David have to suffer the way he did why do you have to suffer the way you do amen after we're anoint anointed right through the blood and the spirit for our kingly position for our adoption right amen then we have to suffer amen and what happened to David David he started doing exploits of Faith so God begin to vindicate his kingly ministry before Saul and the church and the Philistines in the world they all knew it they all saw the the the sign of it amen just like when brother bandam says Lord what does this mean being me being caught up into this cloud of and the Lord put the king's sword in his hands okay put the king's sword in his hands you're being anointed for a kingly Ministry praise the Lord amen amen amen and so and so here's David anointed he's doing exploits of Faith right because God's vindicating him and then instead of David taking the throne he became a fugitive EXA he was caught in the fires between the church split with Saul and the world you know they were both against it you know it's one thing when the world's against you and then you're having to fight this church split over here in the message amen amen I'm just being honest but I'm telling you I'll fellow sh with any of you and even if you know me speaking about the son of man scares you I'll still fellowship with you right I'm I'm saying that as gracious as I can I'm trying to be example okay amen look so so now he becomes a fugitive now now he's on the run now he's on the defense now he's having to hide out he's a you know he's anointed for this position right and he's hiding out he's running for his life he's being treated like a dog and all he did was good exactly amen amen and why did God permit it why did God permit an evil spirit to come on Saul and what what what did that evil spirit anoints Saul with hatred and when people hate they murder they'll kill your influence okay amen I'm talking about spirits we're talking this is a house of correction this is for those that want to come to your kingly position this is those that are willing to Humble themselves to the word of the king in this hour and say Lord whatever it takes let me sacrifice it to the Cross amen I'm not here to condemn anybody right I'm here to help you right and so Saul uh uh David got frustrated absolutely absolutely he got flustrated you know he he got discouraged he was on the Run he was on the def defense and yet he was anointed with that rainbow light exactly he was anointed with that rainbow light that oil but why did God permit it brother manam told us because kingly power without kingly character can't Reign it's demonic okay it's de it it's demonic and so kingly power without kingly character it will destroy life that's what it does that's what a demon does it's out to destroy it's not out to edify it's not out to tear down barriers and build Bridges it's out to destroy and tear things apart am okay and so hmon was the classic character of that you remember hmon the king's right-hand man the King of Persia his right-hand man right he had a demon character but he had the king's signature ring do you know that he had the king's signature ring and the King's signature ring means that he had the authority of the king's name he had the power of the throne he had the power of the of the crown was all behind him by the king's signature ring amen and so when he made the decree he hated the Jews why because morai would not bow to that Spirit know right he won't bow I'm not going to bow to no denominational Spirit you know I you can just Fellowship me anybody can just Fellowship me I've had to suffer that but I'm not going to bow to that but you know what I'm going to love you I'm going to be your friend if you'll let me I'm going to help you why it's in me brother it's in me that's what's in me and now sometimes you know brother George we know we get hurt and we got to wrestle it out we got to fight it out amen but that's part of the experience yes it is that's part of the experience yes it is and so the reason then and so hmon what' he do he he wrote out a proclamation going to kill all the the Jews and being that it was the king's word it could not be altered and do you know that that Proclamation is in writing to get the spiritual Jews the Bride of Jesus Christ absolutely it's already in in in writing it's just waiting for the hour so that's what hmon did with his kingly power he used it to destroy and to kill but there was another man called Mor he lived his life for others he developed the character of a queen in hadessa right who became Esther not only did he do that but he saved the King's life how many knows that story he saved the King's life and it reminds me of brother brandham brother brandham saved the life of the king of saints you say how did he do that well because of the conspiracy of the Oneness and The Trinity against acts 238 amen he stood right in between the two and says no sir the baptism is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah if you want the atonement and you want to meet the king of the Saints amen you got to meet it by acts 238 so then you know just at the right time the Lord brought it to the mind of the king he he got woke up started reading the Chronicles he wrote about the story of of morai what happened here what has been done for morai oh nothing okay many times nothing right you'll hear nothing you'll know nothing time will go by and a year like God remembers God remembers God knows and so what oh and he says what shall be done for the man whom the king Delight to honor about that time hmon comes you know all all stuck up well who else would the king want but me you know hmon wasn't satisfied being the right-hand man hmon wanted the very Throne himself is that right ain't that right absolutely and well hmon what shall be done with the man well put the Royal crown on his head put the king's Royal garments on him and put him on the king's horse and March him through the town what your be done with the man whom the king Delights to honor that's right wow and so then Esther exposed his scheme right he exposed his scheme again just at the right time Saints amen have faith in God it's been a long time since have faith in God claim your own amen amen amen and so exposes the plot he takes the king's ring off of hmon and puts it on the hand of morai why because he had the character he lived for others and what did he do he couldn't change the proclamation but he issued a new Proclamation amen just in time God will raise up a standard in this age when they move in to kill the Royal Seed of Abraham you can mark it down amen God's plan will not be filled amen and so amen now I'm out of Grace it's been one eight one minute 1 hour and 18 minutes but I'm almost done okay you love the Lord so David he became a fugitive and finally Saul had him cornered y Amen in the caves of inti how many's ever into Israel and seen that tour and you've seen inti in that area rugged area but there was that stream of water coming down through there and so he had him he was in the cave Saul was coming in but then God stood up for David Glory why do you think Saul got sleepy why why did he get sleepy amen the Lord put the Spirit of Slumber on him and he went so sound asleep and all the Army went to sleep and and then and then David and his men came up to King Saul and here came the final test for David here came the final Temptation for David David the Lord has delivered him into your hands kill him David amen God has put your enemy in your hands kill them amen here's your time to get even sister exactly here's your time to get even brother exactly exactly exactly and so light and darkness was going through his mind yeah right am he heard all the arguments of why he should kill him right see but finally the light of reconciliation David suffered all of this amen but the light of reconciliation came through and he says I'll touch not the Lord's anointed touch not the Lord's anointed and do His prophets no harm harm no matter how much you disagree with him do His prophets no harm so instead he cuts a piece of the king's garment he takes it and then Saul gets up and Saul goes out David calls him musicians you can come he calls him is that you my son David and he looks and he waves before him the king's garment he waves before him a token of kindness he's showing the king he's reflecting the light of reconciliation he showing in him I preserved your life amen I could have killed you but I preserved your life I could have got even if I had a grudge I would have got even but there was no grudges God forbid that I touch his anointed amen and his anointed acting like that yeah exactly exactly exactly and when King Saul saw it he said now I know that you'll be king for whereas I rewarded evil for good you rewarded good for evil that's what it's going to take Church yes it is to be the Bride of Jesus Christ in this age amen it's going to take more than hearing the word it's going to it's it's a LIF it's a life it's a light of reconciliation and did you notice amen Revelations 3:21 where why did God place it where he placed it in the scripture why is Revelations 3:21 at the end of the seven Church ages at the top of the pyramid because it's after his bride through all the denominational persecution all the worldly persecution of seven Church ages her faith her virtue her knowledge her Temperance her patience her godliness her brotherly kindness amen and now by the seventh angel who represents us all amen glory to God he overcame every denominational barrier for us and he had the light of reconciliation he had the kingly character amen amen in or and to enter into glory for the crown of glory amen brothers and sisters you're living in a glorious age amen you have a glorious
