[21:18] Shalom Phoenix on Sunday night the
[21:21] weekend before that we're in Flagstaff
[21:23] Sunday morning and in Shalom Phoenix on
[21:25] Sunday night the weekend before that I
[21:27] think maybe
[21:28] landmarkers somewhere I'm losing track
[21:30] at this point but um it's certainly good
[21:34] to be back home with you tonight and and
[21:36] we just uh look forward for What the
[21:37] Lord Has for us can you say Amen tonight
[21:40] amen Isaiah the 56th chapter want to
[21:44] greet our stream uh folks that are
[21:46] streaming we greet our Saints in Phoenix
[21:48] there my friends there and and also if
[21:51] um brother Israel gets a chance to
[21:54] stream or listen in on the service I'm
[21:56] sure he'll maybe have a chance hopefully
[21:58] sometime we want to greet him uh in the
[22:01] name of the Lord tonight too and we just
[22:02] trust that God is using him and sister
[22:05] Sharon in a mighty way and that uh I
[22:08] know wherever he's at whoever he's
[22:10] preaching to he's going to do him good
[22:12] because he's done me good all these
[22:14] years and so I have confidence that the
[22:16] Lord is is using Brother Israel and just
[22:20] uh I just hope that the Lord just
[22:22] continues to bless them and and uh we
[22:24] look forward to hearing the the
[22:26] testimonies that come out of this Isaiah
[22:29] 56 and the 4th verse Isaiah 56:4 for
[22:33] thus sayith the Lord unto the unic that
[22:37] keep my sabbaths and choose the things
[22:39] that please me and take hold of my
[22:42] Covenant even unto them will I give in
[22:45] mine house and with my walls a place and
[22:49] a name better than the sons and of then
[22:53] of sons and of daughters and I will give
[22:56] them an everlasting name name that shall
[22:59] not be cut off also the sons of the
[23:02] stranger that join themselves to the
[23:05] Lord that's that's the Gentiles to serve
[23:09] him and to love the name of the Lord to
[23:11] be his servants everyone that keepeth
[23:15] the Sabbath from polluting it and take
[23:16] hold of my Covenant even them will I
[23:20] bring to my Holy Mountain and make them
[23:24] joyful In My House of Prayer everybody
[23:28] say
[23:29] Joyful Joyful In My House of Prayer
[23:32] their burnt offerings and their
[23:35] sacrifices shall be accepted upon my
[23:38] Altar for mine house shall be called a
[23:42] house of prayer for all people let's
[23:47] just bow our heads heavenly father it's
[23:49] a privilege to be in the house of the
[23:51] Lord tonight Lord and may we be joyful
[23:54] to be here Lord Lord God no matter what
[23:57] what we've had to go through today no
[23:59] matter the trials that today have held
[24:02] no matter what's going on at work or at
[24:05] school or at home no matter what Lord
[24:08] may we be joyful to come to the house of
[24:10] the Lord the house of prayer and Lord we
[24:14] just ask oh God that you would speak to
[24:16] us tonight Lord break to us the bread of
[24:19] life bless your children we pray and
[24:22] Lord I ask you to watch over me and Lord
[24:25] bind my lips before I'd speak anything
[24:27] unpleasing pleasing to you and we'll
[24:29] commit it into your hands in the name of
[24:31] the Lord Jesus Christ we ask it amen and
[24:35] amen God bless you you may be seated and
[24:37] go ahead and turn in your Bibles to
[24:39] James the 5th chapter for another little
[24:42] reading and I want to touch on the topic
[24:44] tonight of Prayer Changes Things Prayer
[24:48] Changes Things and if you want a good
[24:50] search sometime you can search in the
[24:53] message Prayer Changes Things and you'll
[24:56] find uh nice uh a nice selection of
[25:00] quotes that that brother brandham talks
[25:02] about how that that Prayer Changes
[25:05] Things in our lives and so I think
[25:08] tonight as we're entering into this
[25:10] prayer meeting hopefully we can uh read
[25:12] some quotes and some scriptures that
[25:14] will bless you and will help you and and
[25:17] have confidence that that when we go to
[25:20] the Lord in prayer it's not in vain but
[25:22] but Prayer Changes Things Saints do
[25:25] y'all believe Prayer Changes Things
[25:28] tonight amen that's what the prophet of
[25:30] God taught us and and so James the 5th
[25:33] chapter and the 13th verse says this is
[25:36] any among you Afflicted let him pray is
[25:39] any marry let him sing songs is any sick
[25:43] among you let him call for the Elders of
[25:46] church and let them pray over him
[25:48] anointing him with oil in the name of
[25:51] the Lord and the prayer of faith shall
[25:54] save the sick the prayer of faith shall
[25:58] save the sick and the Lord shall raise
[26:01] him up and if he has committed sins they
[26:05] shall be forgiven him that's a lot of
[26:07] power in that prayer isn't it confess
[26:10] your faults one to another and pray one
[26:13] for another that you may be healed now I
[26:17] love this Saints it says the effectual
[26:19] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[26:23] availeth much and he says Elias was a
[26:26] man subject subject to like passion as
[26:29] we are and he prayed earnestly that it
[26:32] might not rain and it rained not on the
[26:35] Earth by the space of three years and
[26:37] six months and he prayed again and the
[26:40] heaven gave rain and the Earth brought
[26:43] forth her fruit isn't that a beautiful
[26:46] scripture reading tonight Saints and and
[26:48] so I'll tell you it's a it's shocking to
[26:50] me I think we probably all have have
[26:53] gotten to the point to where we say my
[26:55] prayer life is not what it should be I
[26:59] don't pray in the manner that I should
[27:02] pray now I realize that in our lives we
[27:06] have es and flows and you might have
[27:08] times where where your prayer life is
[27:10] better than others and and you might
[27:12] have Hills and Valleys in your prayer
[27:14] life but at one time or another if it's
[27:16] not right now you know what I'm talking
[27:18] about that we say I'm just not praying
[27:20] like I should be praying can you say
[27:22] Amen tonight to that and the majority of
[27:25] the Christians in the world today I
[27:27] would say this is a major struggle for
[27:30] them to be able to spend enough time in
[27:33] prayer can you say Amen to that and and
[27:36] probably one of the most neglected parts
[27:39] that we see in the Christian walk is
[27:42] prayer life and and it's the desire to
[27:45] pray and the need to pray and and you
[27:48] find brothers and sisters that that it's
[27:50] it's absolutely the only thing that's
[27:53] going to do any good is to spend that
[27:55] time in prayer is that right and and
[27:57] it's and it's absolutely free to us it
[27:59] don't it don't cost nothing it's not
[28:01] it's not difficult for us to do it's
[28:04] it's absolutely free and it's the only
[28:06] thing that does any good and it's the
[28:07] one thing the devil fights so hard to
[28:10] keep us from doing see see everybody
[28:12] gets to the point to where we're so busy
[28:15] in this day and time with different
[28:17] things to keep us distracted and
[28:20] overwhelmed and we're just busy with
[28:23] work and with home life and with
[28:25] entertainment and with commit ments and
[28:28] different things that would stop us from
[28:30] being able to concentrate on our prayer
[28:33] life can you say Amen tonight Saints and
[28:35] and we find it happens to all of us and
[28:37] and it doesn't necessarily have to be a
[28:39] bad thing it can actually be something
[28:42] involved in the church when you know we
[28:43] get busy with the church and we get busy
[28:46] uh uh coming up on these meetings and so
[28:48] forth and all the Prep Prep work that
[28:50] goes into that and planning and and
[28:52] those type things we can easily get so
[28:54] busy with this church function that we
[28:56] forget the the main thing that's going
[28:58] to make these meetings successful and
[29:00] that's to spend time in prayer for those
[29:04] meetings
[29:06] amen and brother brandom says and why
[29:09] are people so tossed about he said the
[29:12] Bible said the effectual fervent prayer
[29:15] of a righteous man availeth much now
[29:18] that word aileth means to exercise force
[29:21] or to Prevail and he said the effectual
[29:24] fervent prayer of a righteous man avails
[29:27] much see Elijah was a man subject to
[29:30] like passions as we are and he prayed
[29:32] earnestly that it would rain and it
[29:34] didn't rain for three years and six
[29:36] months and then he went and prayed
[29:38] earnestly again and the heavens give
[29:41] rain now brother Brown says prayer
[29:44] changes things he says it can't change
[29:48] it I can't change it he said you can't
[29:51] change it it's prayer that changes it is
[29:54] that what the prophet said nothing I can
[29:57] do about it nothing you can do about it
[29:59] but there is something prayer can do
[30:01] about it amen amen so so I think it's
[30:05] striking that that it's not you and it's
[30:08] not I but there's something about prayer
[30:11] that that changes things now I don't
[30:13] want to get ahead of myself but but
[30:15] we'll find that prayer is actually an
[30:17] action of the Holy Spirit working in our
[30:20] life it's not prayer is not something we
[30:23] do it's something that the Holy Spirit
[30:25] does through us do you believe that
[30:27] tonight and and prayer is the only thing
[30:31] we find that you can't do too much of
[30:34] you you can eat too
[30:38] much and and and you can sleep too much
[30:42] and you can work too much amen you can
[30:45] you can you can preach too much even I
[30:48] can I after about 45 minutes it gets to
[30:51] where it's too much preaching ain't it
[30:53] and so you find that you can do anything
[30:55] too much but pray and you can't pray too
[30:59] much now brother Bram said in the
[31:01] healing of D gas's daughter he said and
[31:03] if Jesus had to spend much down this is
[31:05] a real familiar quote to us Saints but
[31:08] but but even the familiar ones we got to
[31:10] keep on reading them amen and he said
[31:13] and if Jesus had to spend much time in
[31:15] prayer to stay in fellowship with the
[31:18] spirit that was with him in him how much
[31:21] more do you and I have to spend in
[31:24] prayer so Jesus had to stay in prayer to
[31:28] stay in contact with the spirit that was
[31:30] within him and he said what about me and
[31:33] you amen and I Think Jesus set the
[31:36] example to us and he says if you only
[31:38] knew what time in prayer meant and see
[31:41] it said what sometimes when you're in
[31:43] prayer God changes the complete
[31:47] destination of different things that's
[31:49] going to happen so so brother brandham
[31:52] says that that there could be something
[31:54] that was going to happen and your
[31:56] prayers could change what's going to
[31:58] happen or could change the outcome of a
[32:02] situation that's how critical our time
[32:05] in prayer is do y'all believe this
[32:07] tonight and he said he said it changes
[32:09] things that was going to happen he said
[32:12] do you believe that he said might be
[32:14] something fixing to happen and your
[32:16] prayer could change the whole situation
[32:19] well you say if God knows it's going to
[32:21] happen what would my prayer do you
[32:23] remember when he stood there looking out
[32:26] upon the Harvest and he said he was the
[32:29] lord of the Harvest and he said the
[32:31] Harvest is ripe and the laborers are but
[32:34] few pray ye that the to the lord of the
[32:37] Harvest that he will send laborers into
[32:40] the Harvest in other words pray to me
[32:43] that I will send laborers into the
[32:45] Harvest which I'm just telling you is
[32:48] such a needy thing but part of it lays
[32:51] but part of it lays in human beings so
[32:54] brother Bram said that Jesus stood there
[32:56] talking to the disciples and he
[32:58] recognized the need for Laborers in the
[33:01] Harvest and he instructed the disciples
[33:03] to pray to the Lord of the Harvest that
[33:06] they would send laborers and he was the
[33:08] lord of the Harvest you see Jesus was
[33:11] guiding their
[33:14] prayer Jesus was guiding their prayer to
[33:17] what was at need at that time do you
[33:19] believe that tonight Jesus was guiding
[33:22] their prayer and he was the lord of the
[33:24] Harvest and he could have simply sent
[33:26] laborers into the Harvest but God
[33:28] chooses to work through man tonight he
[33:31] chooses to work through you and I
[33:33] tonight and he can't just do it all for
[33:36] us there's something we got to do in
[33:38] this
[33:39] Saints and he said pray that I'll send
[33:41] laborers and he said the kingdom of God
[33:43] he said but part of it lays in human
[33:46] beings see Saints you and I are you are
[33:49] are are elements for the use of God
[33:52] tonight we we the our hands are his
[33:55] hands our our mouth is his mouth or our
[33:58] our tongue or our our bodies are his
[34:01] body we may be the only Jesus that some
[34:04] people will ever see and he uses men
[34:07] tonight he uses women tonight do you
[34:10] believe
[34:11] it and he said pray that I'll send
[34:13] labors into the Harvest he said part of
[34:15] it lays in human beings do you believe
[34:17] that the kingdom of God lays within the
[34:21] human being now Jesus said in one place
[34:24] I am the vine ye are the branches the
[34:28] vine can't bear fruit the
[34:30] branches in the vine bears fruit so so
[34:35] brother so Jesus can't bear fruit that's
[34:38] up to you and I to
[34:42] do and he says God cannot bear fruit of
[34:46] his it's got to take the
[34:49] church is that right now he could do it
[34:54] however he wanted to do it Saints but he
[34:56] chose to to do it through you and I amen
[34:59] he he doesn't have to have us but he
[35:01] chose to have us he didn't have to do it
[35:04] this way but this is the way he chose
[35:06] and it's our job amen amen and that's
[35:10] the way he chose it he says he's got to
[35:12] take your branches to bear fruit and
[35:15] when you branches are are yielded to the
[35:18] vine when you branches are yielded to
[35:20] the vine then fruit comes forth see what
[35:24] I mean God wants your hands he wants
[35:27] your eyes he wants your tongue he wants
[35:31] your lips he wants your ears he wants
[35:34] your hands and feet so he can bring
[35:36] forth fruit through you see Saints he is
[35:40] counting on your prayers tonight he's
[35:42] counting on you to lift up something in
[35:45] prayer
[35:47] tonight amen so he was the lord of the
[35:51] Harvest and he saw the need that was in
[35:54] the world but he asked his follow to
[35:57] pray for the to the lord of the Harvest
[35:59] which he was because he has chosen to
[36:02] use you and I tonight he chose you and I
[36:06] to be his members so Jesus essentially
[36:09] guides the prayers of the
[36:12] Believers am
[36:15] amen he guides the prayers to the of the
[36:20] Believers now we'll talk about that more
[36:21] here in just a little bit but that's why
[36:23] we must be as brother brandham said
[36:25] yielded to the Vine because if we're
[36:27] yielded to the vine then he can guide
[36:30] our
[36:32] prayers all right now just to help build
[36:36] your faith a little bit when you
[36:39] pray I I want to tell you that we must
[36:42] realize that when we pray
[36:45] God always
[36:49] answers not part of the time not some of
[36:52] the time but God always answers when we
[36:55] pray now here you him brother Bram says
[36:58] get the fear away don't be scared that
[37:02] God's not going to answer prayer God
[37:05] always answers
[37:08] prayer The Works already finished he's
[37:12] obligated he must do it he's got to do
[37:15] it to keep his word notice it's a
[37:18] finished work so no matter what the
[37:21] answer is Saints we got to have
[37:23] confidence that the answer is just
[37:25] righten the answer is just what it's
[37:28] supposed to be now Romans 8:28 I love
[37:31] this verse it's one it's one of my
[37:33] favorite verses in the Bible and
[37:35] somebody at the youth service had this
[37:36] as their favorite verse who was that
[37:38] y'all you remember who that somebody had
[37:40] this 828 and we know that all things
[37:43] work together for good to them that love
[37:47] God do you love God tonight then all
[37:51] things work together for good to them
[37:53] that love God to them who are the called
[37:57] according to his purpose how can you go
[38:00] wrong with a promise like that Saints
[38:02] how can you go wrong when you got that
[38:04] much confidence how can you go wrong
[38:06] when no matter what comes your way no
[38:08] matter what happens it's all working for
[38:11] your
[38:12] good what a blessed people that the
[38:14] worst day you ever had was for your good
[38:18] the hardest time you ever had was for
[38:20] your good amen the worst meal you ever
[38:24] cooked was for your
[38:27] good is that right all things work
[38:30] together for good of them that love God
[38:33] and are called according to his purpose
[38:36] we can't go wrong with a promise like
[38:38] that Saints All Things the good things
[38:42] the bad things the tough things the easy
[38:44] things the happy things the sad things
[38:46] all things work together for
[38:50] good
[38:51] amen so if the Lord gives us exactly
[38:55] what we prayed about and exactly what we
[38:57] were asking for then that's for our
[39:01] good but if he doesn't give us exactly
[39:03] what we ask for then that was for our
[39:05] good
[39:06] also or if he tells us he we can have it
[39:09] but we got to wait just a little bit
[39:12] that's for our good also all things work
[39:15] together for good of those that love God
[39:18] and are called according to his purpose
[39:20] and I believe God has called a bride out
[39:23] of the into this message tonight do
[39:24] y'all believe that and I'm believe we're
[39:26] the called of God and I believe all
[39:29] things are working together for our good
[39:33] amen now here's the part that blows my
[39:36] mind he's such a good God that he
[39:39] actually makes intercessions for our
[39:46] prayers now intercession means the act
[39:49] of
[39:50] intervening on behalf of another now the
[39:53] Bible said he makes intercession for our
[39:57] prayers he acts on behalf of our
[40:02] prayers now Romans 8:26 says likewise
[40:05] the spirit also helpeth our infirmities
[40:08] for we know not what we should pray for
[40:11] as we
[40:13] ought amen sometimes we don't know the
[40:17] right thing to pray for do we sometimes
[40:20] we don't know if we should pray for this
[40:21] or pray for that what we should pray for
[40:24] well the Bible said that that he know
[40:27] that we know not what we should pray as
[40:28] we ought but the spirit itself makes
[40:32] intercessions for us with groanings
[40:34] which cannot be uttered amen amen so he
[40:38] that searches the hearts knows what is
[40:41] in the mind of the spirit because he
[40:44] maketh intercession for the Saints
[40:47] according to the will of God see he
[40:52] knows what his will is we may not know
[40:55] but he knows and he makes intercessions
[40:58] for our prayers according to his will
[41:02] amen that's miraculous SES now let me
[41:05] read it to you in a different
[41:06] translation the ESV version y'all don't
[41:09] y'all don't throw Rotten Tomatoes at me
[41:10] it's all
[41:12] right likewise the spirit helps us in
[41:15] our
[41:16] weakness for we do not know what to pray
[41:19] for as we ought but the spirit himself
[41:23] intercedes for us with Gro too deep for
[41:27] words and he who searches Hearts knows
[41:31] what is in the mind of the spirit
[41:33] because the spirit intercedes for the
[41:36] Saints according to the will of
[41:40] God let me just say it like this even
[41:44] your prayers are controlled by the Lord
[41:48] Jesus
[41:49] amen amen if you're yielded to the vine
[41:53] even your prayers are in the hands of
[41:56] the the Lord
[41:59] Jesus is that what the Bible said now
[42:02] you remember how he guided the disciples
[42:05] prayer and he said there's a need for
[42:07] Laborers in the Harvest now you pray
[42:12] that the lord of the Harvest will send
[42:14] laborers is that right Saints just like
[42:17] he did it when he was here on Earth he
[42:19] does it now by the Holy Spirit and he
[42:22] says pray for this pray for this pray
[42:27] for this he guides the prayers of the
[42:29] Believers because that's the way he's
[42:32] chosen to do it that's good amen if the
[42:36] spirit of Christ is in our heart it
[42:38] causes us to cry ABA
[42:41] father amen now Abba actually means
[42:45] father so it actually means that we
[42:47] should cry father
[42:49] father
[42:51] amen and this desire he said to commune
[42:55] with the father you can't can't put it
[42:56] in words he said we don't know how to
[42:58] say it like we ought to he says for ye
[43:00] have not received the spirit of bondage
[43:02] again to fear but you have received a
[43:05] spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA
[43:10] father all right and you just can't put
[43:14] it into words you can't describe how you
[43:16] feel about the Lord in so many words
[43:20] there's just no way to describe what he
[43:22] means to you what what he what he's done
[43:25] for you you can't put in words there
[43:27] there's not a word in a language that
[43:29] you can use to describe everything that
[43:31] God means to
[43:32] you is that right Saints but the spirit
[43:36] knows what's in the heart the Bible
[43:39] said the spirit knows what your heart
[43:43] means and it makes intercession for that
[43:47] so isn't that and not only that the
[43:49] spirit also knows if you're close to the
[43:52] vine if you're attached to the vine and
[43:54] if your heart is right towards God God
[43:56] then the spirit knows that at the end of
[43:58] the day you would rather have God's will
[44:01] than your
[44:03] will is that your prayer today thy will
[44:06] be done thy kingdom come on Earth as it
[44:09] is in heaven I might pray for something
[44:11] Saints but at the end of the day I'd
[44:14] rather have it be God's will than to be
[44:16] my
[44:17] will I'd rather have his will in my life
[44:20] than my own will now I'll pray for what
[44:23] I think is right but I but God know
[44:26] knows my heart that I really want his
[44:28] perfect
[44:30] will
[44:34] amen so our desire to commune with the
[44:38] father can't be put into
[44:40] words and and we find that it's not our
[44:43] will but it's his that has to be done I
[44:47] think of it like this it's like all of
[44:49] us dumb guys that's trying to find a way
[44:54] to tell our sweetheart how much we care
[44:56] about
[44:59] him now if I try to do it it ain't gonna
[45:03] make no
[45:05] sense come on somebody y'all don't leave
[45:07] me hanging up
[45:09] here if I try to tell my wife exactly
[45:12] how I feel about it I can't put it into
[45:15] words
[45:16] correctly I guess y'all are all good at
[45:18] that you good at that
[45:21] Caleb all
[45:24] right some of y'all might be good at
[45:26] telling your wife how you feel but as
[45:29] for me I'm not the best at it all right
[45:33] but she knows my heart because we have a
[45:37] relationship together and she knows what
[45:40] I'm trying to say whether I can get it
[45:43] out or not all right she's able to read
[45:48] between the lines see it's impossible
[45:52] for us to pray correctly if our hearts
[45:55] aren't right towards
[45:57] God see we can't fake anything with God
[46:00] you can pull the wool over anybody
[46:01] else's eyes but you can't fake it with
[46:04] God he knows what you are he knows what
[46:07] you aren't he knows the ins he knows the
[46:09] outs and he knows all about it and you
[46:11] can't you might look like one thing in
[46:13] front of everybody else but he knows
[46:15] what you really are and he knows if your
[46:19] heart's right towards him or not that's
[46:21] why the Bible said if our hearts condemn
[46:24] us not is that right 1 John 3:19 says
[46:28] hereby we know that we are of the truth
[46:31] and shall assure our hearts before him
[46:35] for if our heart condemn us then God is
[46:38] greater than our heart and knoweth all
[46:40] things see it's a good thing if your
[46:43] heart is being condemned about something
[46:45] that's a good thing that means god is
[46:47] dealing with you and you know what you
[46:49] need to make right you know what you
[46:51] need to pray for you know what you need
[46:53] to do you know what's got to be
[46:54] corrected to make your heart right it's
[46:56] a good thing to have
[46:58] condemnation amen it's it's I I I want
[47:02] to be corrected do you want to be
[47:04] corrected Saints I want to be right
[47:06] towards God I I don't want to be wrong I
[47:09] I want to be right and I like to have my
[47:12] it don't feel
[47:13] good but I'd rather get it out of the
[47:16] way I'd rather not have anything between
[47:18] me and
[47:20] him amen and he says God is greater than
[47:23] our heart and knoweth all things says
[47:25] beloved if our heart condemn us not then
[47:28] we have confidence towards God and
[47:31] whatsoever we ask we receive of him
[47:35] because we keep his Commandments and do
[47:37] things that are pleasing in his
[47:41] sight is that right Saints so if we get
[47:44] oursel right and our heart is right and
[47:47] we're walking in the way and we're
[47:48] living the right kind of life and we
[47:50] keep the Commandments of the Lord and
[47:52] our heart is right towards God we can
[47:54] have confidence that our prayers are
[47:56] being answered right
[48:00] amen now there is certainly such a thing
[48:03] as a sinner's prayer but it don't need
[48:05] to stay a sinner's prayer we need to
[48:08] have a sinner's prayer for a sinner but
[48:10] then once there a Saint they need to
[48:12] move on up
[48:16] amen so we got to make right what needs
[48:19] to be made right so that we can have a
[48:21] clear conscience towards God and and and
[48:24] that's whatever God shows us that we
[48:28] need to make right whatever God reveals
[48:31] to our hearts that's holding us
[48:34] up amen is this all right tonight
[48:38] Saints so whatever is holding us up
[48:41] whatever is keeping us from having a
[48:43] clear conscience toward God that so we
[48:46] can go boldly to the throne of God in
[48:49] prayer and have confidence that he hears
[48:51] and answers our
[48:54] prayer all right right so I'll tell you
[48:57] Saints one of the things that's the
[48:59] hardest to do here is that we got to
[49:01] stay alone with God long enough for him
[49:04] to place on our hearts the things that
[49:07] he wants us to ask him
[49:11] for that takes a minute it takes some
[49:15] time it it takes I I had a a good a
[49:19] friend of M he said brother George one
[49:20] of my one of my uh the songs that I
[49:23] couldn't I didn't like the most growing
[49:26] up with Sweet Hour of
[49:28] Prayer he said number one the song just
[49:31] goes on and on and on and on he said but
[49:35] then number
[49:36] two he said I can't
[49:38] imagine praying for an
[49:44] hour right
[49:47] now at least he was being honest all
[49:50] right he said what would you pray for
[49:52] well you know what if you get down there
[49:54] with a wish list of everything that you
[49:55] want to tell God that you need you're
[49:57] going to be out you're going to be
[49:58] through your list pretty fast but if you
[50:01] get down on your knees to commune with
[50:04] God and to and to hear from God of the
[50:07] things that that he places on your heart
[50:09] to pray for it can take
[50:12] hours
[50:15] amen all right so brother Bram says this
[50:17] as I thought on my wayist that some of
[50:19] us go other paths in this neurotic age
[50:22] that we're living so many people turn to
[50:25] the p psychiatrist to Christians go to
[50:27] the psychiatrist and psychiatrist has
[50:30] got to go to a psychiatrist he said turn
[50:33] your path to God he's the Healer and if
[50:37] our hearts condemn us not then we have
[50:40] this assurance that God answers
[50:43] prayer
[50:45] amen letting off the pressure he said
[50:47] just another testimony uh to the glory
[50:50] of God he said to know that he answers
[50:53] prayer when the hearts are sincere and
[50:56] want to believe on him he answers prayer
[51:00] when the hearts are sincere and want to
[51:03] believe on
[51:05] him there's nothing too great for him to
[51:09] do let me read that again there's
[51:11] nothing that's right too great for him
[51:14] to do and I believe that he just loves
[51:19] to do that for his
[51:21] people so brother Brown said there's
[51:23] number one there's nothing too great
[51:26] there's nothing off limits amen there's
[51:29] nothing that God can't take care of
[51:31] there's no problem we got that's too big
[51:33] there's no problem we got that's too
[51:35] small there's nothing that that God
[51:37] can't handle in our life nothing that he
[51:41] can't do nothing he can't handle He's
[51:43] Got No Limits he's omnipotent and he's
[51:45] omnipresent and he's more than able to
[51:47] handle anything but not only that number
[51:50] two brother Bram said he loves to do
[51:53] it so we're not asking God to do
[51:57] something that he don't want to do we're
[51:59] asking God to do something that he loves
[52:01] to
[52:02] do amen he loves to do it he loves to
[52:07] answer the prayers of the Saints he
[52:10] loves to do that for his children he
[52:12] loves to do that for his
[52:15] people
[52:17] amen so stay right with it stay with it
[52:22] now brother Bram talked about amram now
[52:24] everybody knows am and yabel in the
[52:26] Bible and he said he prayed and he
[52:29] prayed and he prayed for the children of
[52:31] Israel in bondage and he and he kept
[52:34] praying and he kept praying and it kept
[52:36] getting worse and it kept getting worse
[52:38] and it kept getting worse and he prayed
[52:40] and he prayed and he prayed some more
[52:42] and and and he kept on praying Saints
[52:43] what else could he do what other options
[52:47] did he
[52:49] have amen what else can we do tonight I
[52:53] can't do nothing about what's going on
[52:55] in Israel but I can pray I can't do
[52:58] anything about what's going on out here
[52:59] on the street but I can pray I can't do
[53:02] anything about all the evils and and the
[53:04] Ws of the devil in this world but I can
[53:07] pray amen I can't do anything about
[53:10] others people's walk with the Lord but I
[53:13] can
[53:17] pray amen and he couldn't do anything
[53:20] else he couldn't deliver his people he
[53:23] couldn't ease his people's burdens
[53:26] but he could pray and brother Bram said
[53:28] lifting him up out of History he said
[53:30] one night when Abraham had prayed maybe
[53:32] for several hours and his hair now was
[53:35] turning gray he been praying so long
[53:37] Saints he been praying since he was a
[53:38] young
[53:40] man and his hair was turning gray no
[53:42] Deliverance but just getting worse amen
[53:45] sometimes when you pray it seems like
[53:47] things are getting
[53:49] worse amen one night he got right down
[53:52] to business that's how we have to do it
[53:55] get right down to business he said God
[53:57] you promised this and we've looked
[54:00] forward to it and we see the signs all
[54:02] here and the time is at hand it's time
[54:05] for you to do something about
[54:07] it and while he was deep concentrated
[54:11] prayer while he was in deep concentrated
[54:14] prayer praying with all his
[54:18] heart he looked standing in a corner he
[54:21] rubbed his eyes and looked again and
[54:23] there stood an angel with a sword drawn
[54:26] and he said Deliverance is coming and
[54:28] you're going to bring a son into the
[54:29] world and he's going to be the one to
[54:32] deliver them see God always answers
[54:36] prayer doesn't he if we just hold on
[54:40] brother
[54:42] BRS Prayer Changes Things Prayer Changes
[54:47] Things it changes the outcome it changes
[54:50] the circumstance it changes the the the
[54:52] whole the whole outlook of the situation
[54:55] does complaining change
[54:57] anything does worry change anything do
[55:01] does does gossip change anything does
[55:04] anger change anything does self-doubt
[55:07] change anything does emotion change
[55:11] anything but prayer does change things
[55:15] amen so if none of those other things
[55:18] work why don't we spend so much time en
[55:21] thr enth thralled in them why do we
[55:24] spend so much much time messing with
[55:26] things that don't work and not enough
[55:28] time in the things that do work amen
[55:32] many times it seems like our prayer is
[55:35] is the last resort after we've done
[55:38] everything we can do to try to make it
[55:40] work
[55:41] ourself after we've tried all we can try
[55:43] and done all we can do then we
[55:46] pray amen amen so let's do the one thing
[55:51] that's guaranteed to
[55:54] work amen
[55:56] amen The Works that I do bear witness of
[55:58] me brother Brown says and if you ever
[56:00] want to do anything for me that'll
[56:02] please
[56:03] me you pray for
[56:06] me that's the one thing I want you to do
[56:09] is pray for me CU I know Prayer Changes
[56:13] Things it even changes God's mind about
[56:17] things changes God's program do you
[56:20] believe that he says God can pronounce a
[56:24] certain thing it's going to be just that
[56:26] way and prayer will change his mind
[56:29] about it it has been
[56:33] done amen so we fight and we pull and we
[56:37] strain when the most powerful tool in
[56:40] the Arsenal is left in the sheath many
[56:44] times amen y'all believe that
[56:47] tonight amen let's goad we'll just have
[56:50] the musicians come just a few words
[56:53] tonight
[56:56] 37 M 38 minutes brother isra will be
[56:58] proud of
[57:05] me I was thinking about this while I was
[57:07] putting this message together
[57:10] today and I'm not a
[57:13] poet and I I can't spell good enough for
[57:16] spell check to even know what I'm trying
[57:18] to say that's pretty bad brother will if
[57:21] spell check can't figure out what you're
[57:23] trying to say
[57:27] but every once in a while every five
[57:29] years or so the Lord will the Lord will
[57:32] lay uh maybe they that wait upon the
[57:34] Lord sis we if youall know that
[57:37] song every once in a while the Lord will
[57:39] give me a little something and I'll
[57:41] write it
[57:42] down and I was
[57:44] thinking one day
[57:47] about brother brandom talked about that
[57:50] eagle and he said when he began to get
[57:53] old and weary he said he gets a crust
[57:57] over his head y'all heard the
[57:59] story and he says he gets so weary that
[58:02] he don't know what to do and and the
[58:05] Bible said that the eagle renews his
[58:09] youth so he said I studied about this
[58:12] fell when he gets old and weary and that
[58:15] crust all over his head he says he flies
[58:19] just as high as he can go and he finds a
[58:23] great High Rock
[58:25] and he sits down by the side of this
[58:28] rock and he sits there and he beats his
[58:31] head on this
[58:33] rock and he said what's he trying to do
[58:36] he's trying to beat the crust off oh the
[58:39] crust off he says and he said the blood
[58:42] will fly out of his head and it goes
[58:44] through all kinds of torture but as long
[58:47] as he can feel some of that crust on him
[58:49] he he's got to get that off so he beats
[58:52] it on the Rock and he just keep beating
[58:54] until the crust is off his head and he
[58:57] says as soon as the crust is off his
[59:00] head though he's bleeding and wounded he
[59:02] just screams to the top of his
[59:05] voice and he lets off the pressure
[59:09] because as soon as all that crust is off
[59:12] then he renews his
[59:15] youth he says it's sure to come so as
[59:18] soon as the crust is gone he can start
[59:21] screaming because he knows he's got rid
[59:23] of all that crust he said so his youth
[59:26] is sure to be
[59:28] renewed so he can just let off the
[59:31] pleasure start screaming because he's
[59:33] going back to a young Eagle again that's
[59:36] wonderful he says I'm glad for the eagle
[59:38] I'm glad for that bird and I was
[59:40] thinking about that one day I was
[59:42] thinking about this
[59:43] story and the lord gave me these words
[59:46] and I'll and again I'm not a poet but I
[59:49] want to read this it's all right if I
[59:50] share this with you
[59:52] tonight and it was just a few words that
[59:55] the lord gave me to write down and I I
[59:57] pray it's a blessing to you because I
[59:59] tell you Saints this was after I come up
[1:00:02] out of a great trial in my life have you
[1:00:05] ever been in a great trial and right
[1:00:07] after I come up out of the great trial
[1:00:10] that was in my life I was at that point
[1:00:12] to where I was tired from fighting a
[1:00:16] battle but I felt better because I knew
[1:00:20] I was going to make it you know what I
[1:00:21] mean Saints I I knew I was going to make
[1:00:24] it
[1:00:25] and so I wrote these words down hope
[1:00:29] it's a blessing to you the eagle worn
[1:00:32] and battered stood beaten and alone his
[1:00:36] feathers loosed and ruffled his blood
[1:00:38] upon a stone the years had taken from
[1:00:41] him more than their fair share he looked
[1:00:45] a sight of pity a film upon his
[1:00:49] stare tired and weary in his flesh the
[1:00:52] trials had mounted High
[1:00:55] but something called within him his eyes
[1:00:57] looked toward the sky the choice had
[1:01:00] been made for him by birth he could not
[1:01:04] fail the anchor held within his heart
[1:01:07] behind the inner Veil not satisfied with
[1:01:11] where he was ashamed of how he looked he
[1:01:15] gathered strength for one more try and
[1:01:18] to the sky he took High into the heaven
[1:01:22] far from the world below a still Small
[1:01:25] Voice was calling back to the Rock I'll
[1:01:28] go on this rock I'll plant my feet up
[1:01:32] Way Beyond the sky I'll beat myself upon
[1:01:35] the stone until I clear my eyes the
[1:01:39] crust was thick upon them from age or
[1:01:42] storm or Foe but still the voice was
[1:01:45] calling you don't belong
[1:01:48] below an eagle from the beginning
[1:01:51] greater than other birds predestinated
[1:01:54] to Glory because the voice he heard
[1:01:57] painful is the process that it takes to
[1:02:00] be renewed but joyful is the victory as
[1:02:04] light comes shining through one by one
[1:02:07] the scales fell off as the eagle Wars
[1:02:10] and stries the blood upon the
[1:02:13] Mountaintop revealed the hidden prize
[1:02:16] his sight refreshed his Focus sharp his
[1:02:20] strength began to grow his burdens
[1:02:22] seemed much lighter as his feathers
[1:02:25] start to Glow through the scattered
[1:02:27] mountain tops of scream came forth with
[1:02:29] praise the sign of Resurrection the
[1:02:33] renewing of his days the victory came
[1:02:36] calling because of Royal birth and
[1:02:39] though he had some troubles he was
[1:02:42] greater than the earth oh praise the god
[1:02:45] of Heaven who gives and takes away for
[1:02:48] by the Lord's provided way the night is
[1:02:52] turned to day
