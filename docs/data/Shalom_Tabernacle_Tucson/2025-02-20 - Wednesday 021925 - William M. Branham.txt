just something that I was um goes with the testimony I wanted to share as well uh you know Paul imagine had a lot of time to to just think and meditate and pray and you know he was rested multiple times and so just reading in Ephesians 6 where he tells us to be strong in the Lord and the power of His might and then tells us how to do that put on the whole armor of God and I think how many times did Paul see a Roman soldier and he's probably in his mind going through and here's all the things that you can do but you go through the whole armor of God none of those are the power of His might at the end of that it's praying always and and that's where you know we're told that prayer is the greatest weapon that we have and so I just thought you know that's the power of His might and just wanted to share that having the prayer meeting tonight we had a prayer request a couple weeks ago for my brother Joe and so it may be a a book of prayer requests but just want to thank the Lord that the first chapter God answered the request for the first chapter today and so we just wanted to praise him and was thinking of a song what what can we sing I just want to thank the Lord for his

e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e again no sir you can breed hybrid K but you plant that hybrid K back over again you get nothing you got to rebreed it each time because God said let every seed bring forth of its kind Now by high breeding things look what the world's got into today I was reading an article here how the Readers Digest more 20 years and now when won't have babies if it keeps on they're eating hybrid food the thing of it is they've hybrid it and that's not a way a human being was made to eat that kind of food it was made to meet it to eat it in the way it was created that's the reason today that they can't keep meats and everything is the way it is is because it's hybrid hot planted and every kind of a way it's just all mixed up it's got to where the entire human race is being destroyed by their own achievements but trying to take something that God made good and turn it around and make it some other way in their own way leave it the way God made it it's even got into a place to where they're uh trying to high breed the churches today from the real baptism of the Holy Ghost to a handshake some kind of a sprinkling to a water baptism oh my the whole thing's hybrid we want to get back a hybrid plant you have to bathe it and spray it and keep the bugs and beetles off of it but not a genuine healthy plant he's sturdy strong no bugs come on him he's got enough in him to throw the bug off so is a genuine Christian you don't have to babe him and Pat him and tell him this that other he's got something ined the baptism of the Holy Ghost that throws all the rest of it out you don't have to beg him around because he's a genuine plan of God he's got something in him at Wars a Christian fights for every inch of ground he stands on he must do that if he ever expects to exist and by doing something in him that takes care of him Eve tried to hybrid the word in the beginning God told her the day you eat thereof that day you die she tried to breed it in with knowledge it's Satan give her and when she did she lost the whole human race right there to the devil when she tried to mix God's unadulterated word with knowledge it doesn't come from the knowledge of the world it comes by the power of the Holy Spirit not by power by my but by my spirit saith the Lord that's how God does it God's word is a seed of eternal life if you try to hybrid it what will you do you'll kill yourself with it it will not work it will not mix the more than all our water ever mix it will not do it they have never in all the way tried to find anything that's better than God's way of doing it you know they've never found a way better for a chicken to get bned in this world than pecky out of a shell did you know that they never have found a better way the little Fell's barn with a little snoot on the end of his on the end of his bill and that little Bill he got to go to work go to scratching scratching back and forth till he gets his head started gets his head up picks his way free it's God's provided way you pull him out of the shell it'll kill him he won't live if you pull him out of the shell he has to come God's way that's what some Christians today we so soft soaked him and shuck their hands and brought them in by secret and Jared them into the church what they need is an oldfashioned prayer Al where they pray through until using themselves go come in God's provided way till they free themselves from the world trouble of today her name on the book and John church and that's all there is to it but God's way provided way is to stay there and work your way through until God gives you the new birth that's exactly right it came out it'll kill him that's what's the matter today with the people the new birth they all Dodge it they don't like it oh they are substituted something for a New Birth come up and believe and that's all you have to do the devil believes himself and you know he's not born again there's a new birth there something goes with it it's kind of unfitting untas to the world any birth is a mess I don't care where it's that it's in the pig bin or or a hospital a birth is a mess so is the new birth it'll make you do things you didn't think you would do it make you get out the altar cry screen wash the paint off your face raise your hands praise God speak in tongues and all kinds of things a new birth will do that because it's God's provided way to be born again you have to die you have to die before you can be reborn any seed has to die before it's regenerated again unless it dies it dieses alone a man's got to die to his own thinking he's got to die to the thinking of anything but God's word and come his way amen that's God's ground we don't meet him on our thoughts we meet him on what he said do that's God's provided Way Part people Dodge it they don't want it but it's true just the same it'll it produces death you have to die die to your thinking well I know the Bible says it but I can't understand it then stay there till God reveals it amen that's right it's got that's the new birth ducks in geese they've never found a better way for them to go south in the Swarm first that's right you'll see them all get together and they'll come themselves some kind of an instinct draws them together and they get together and swarm before they fly before they go south what is it it's revival time when they all get together do you ever hear such a chatter in your life as you hear them geese get together or them dogs I never heard such and they have there's no other better way for him to do it and the times up in the North Woods I watched The First beginning of the cold weather in Canada a bunch of ducks born right there on that Lake they've never been off that Lake this little fell hasn't and the first thing you know a cold breeze comes down from the north this little little old Drake he's just born to leader gets right out there in the middle of that pond sticks his little Honker up in the air honks four or five times and every duck on the pond comes right to him and he rises from there and goes this is straight to Louisiana as he can go to the rice Pates why they've never found a better way for him to get there you can't hurt them together you put him in a cook and a c and Chuck him down there that Duck's got better sense than that you put him in that c to take him down he knows he's headed for the slaughter pin exactly right he goes God's provided way that's way man ought to do today not be HED in with some denominational cook but come in the way God said come in by the baptism of the holy ghost in a new bir swarming Revival not Church joining soliciting from door to door and passing magazines but a birth being born again filled with the Holy Ghost com's way dream himself from the world right believing God's word the hour is here that's what we must believe man you can never I don't care how many man would try to go to that duck pond up there and say now wait a minute you little ducks got something to talk to you we got an educated duck here he's got a PhD and lldd I'm telling you he can lead you them Ducks got better sense than that yes sir they don't care about his better education whatever it is they can tell the certain honk he gives it's an instinct oh my the church ought to know that much about the word of God it's a certain uncertain sound the Bible said Paul said if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound who can prepare himself for battle that's right if the church if the church give an uncertain sound of joining God said birth what the birth did there the birth does the same today because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever what he was then he is today what they did then is the same thing we do today the way they got it there is the same thing they do today same thing they got today is what they had back there if it comes at all it comes that way that's the way God's provided way it never changes Ducks never change they completely swarm each year go north south and whichever way they go they swarm first that's the way God does he sends his word at season That season then it's manifested and I don't care how many other things have go on when they see the word of God promised for that day being Vindicated and promised there's nothing going to stop them a virgin shall conceive and when they said the Lord Our God shall raise up a prophet liken unto me Moses said and when they seen this man come and do the things he did they know that was a messiah Philip saw that done he said Thou Art the Christ th art the king of Israel he knew it because the word had promised it and it was living in that day no matter how many Pharisees Sadducees were standing around doctors of divinity didn't stop him a bit because he was looking for that sign when he saw it done that was a sign of the hour yes Hallelujah that's that's what they were looking for God's way provided yes sir now you couldn't give a duck education he couldn't do it he wouldn't want it the rest of ducks wouldn't foll him no matter how much degrees he could say he had now look here I went to duck school I know all about it I have graduated I know all these things that wouldn't do a bit of good none of them other Ducks would follow me if they're Janu wine Ducks amen because they're looking for a certain sign they see that sign they believe it if a duck has a way on it how about a barn again Christian we ought to know Jesus Christ in the power of his resurrection right God does it God's provided way remember the education would be the instrument to lead him to God's provided place the instrument they have as Instinct and they D du know that instinct will take them to God's provided place so does the Holy Spirit take the church to God's provided place not to join a church but to be filled with his presence to see his word made manifest Vindicated that's God's provided way for the church always part of the people to bring them to the place that God has provided for them that's exactly what the church should be today now we know that's truth there's no better way for they never found a better way for a baby to get what it wants them to cry for could you give him a bell and say junior you're only three days old but now when you want uh when you want your bottle raise up this Bell and ring it see if it works it don't work the baby cries for what it wants that's God's provided way he louder you cry don't qu the little fell he's the only following God's Prov body way he want something that's right it's the only way he knows to call his mother scream for it cry for it that's right God recommends this for his children God recommends this for his believing children he did not intellectual speeches not some great the theology to teach he wants you to cry for your needs that's right cry part you're too stiff and starchy you'll never get it if you're ready to limber yourself up a little and cry God will give it to you he likes to hear he shouldn't cry cry your needs to God God wants it that's his provided way cry out for that's the way the baby cries that's the way he wants you to cry cry how long how long does a baby cry until he gets satisfied that's the way the believing Christians should do God's child if you see God made the promise don't give it up cry till it's answered cry till you see God vindicates his word god vindicat te his word and proves it sure then you don't have to cry no more you got it walk away thaning for him until tell you do that scream out till you get it I like that persistent holding on not a hybrid plant not one that has to be baby and petted and packed around Christians are real genuine born articles of God they fight for their position and fight till they're finished on this Earth every move of it is a fight God told Moses uh he give him the land he told Joshua every place the foot s of your foot tread that I have given you they had to fight for every inch of it so do we fight for every inch of it it isn't something to be babed and petted and around like that and say well I'll take you over there see what you think about it you pass your opinion that's no way to come come with the determination amen come that you're going to stay there till it's over stay there until God answers and vindicates a man that believes a't God can see the presence of God feel the presence of God sense the presence of God and know he's here he's D to answer everything that he made promis for in this day then cry till you get it hold on to him don't leave you have to stay day and night God don't want his children listening to intellectual speeches he wants them to cry out to it till the promise is Vindicated Abraham here had a need of a sacrifice what happened God provided him a lamb that was God's provided way he needed a sacrifice so God provided it later on he called the place Jehovah gy the Lord will provide for himself a sacrifice the job one time the old Prophet job he was a prophet he had got in trouble Satan had desired to tempt him and he broke him out in boils and he taken his children he taken his stock he taken all he had and he broke him out and boils and his comforters come what did they do they provided nothing but a scorn teasing telling him why you sin secretly jobus H right on he cried out he was sure he was following God's Commandments he had done just exactly what God promised to do what God promised him that he would stand by him under the burnt sacrifice and he stayed there so God provided him a vision he was a prophet what did he see he saw the word Jesus Christ he said I know my redeemer liveth and at the last days he'll stand upon the Earth though the skin worms destroys this body yet in my flesh shall I see God he provided the resurrection vision for him him being a prophet he saw the word he saw the word and he know that his bones and his body would rise again in the last day he must question if he know where God was if he could only see he said a flower dies it rises up again a tree goes down it rises up again but a man layeth down he giveth up the ghost he wastes away where is he all that thou would hide me in the grave and keep me in the secret place till thy wrath be passed and the Thunders begin to Roar the lightning begin to flash the spirit of the Lord come upon the prophet and he stood up and he saw the coming of the Lord and he screamed I know my redeemer liveth and at the last days he'll stand on the earth though the skin worms destroys this body in my flesh I shall see God God provided the word Jesus Christ and he saw him and called him his Redeemer Israel needed a way out of Egypt and God provided them a prophet a prophet that Vindicated the word that was promised to Abraham exactly God's provided way they couldn't train up a soldier they couldn't do this they couldn't do that they the only thing they did was wait for God's provided weight and he told said he would bring those people out after 400 years his people would be in bondage but he' bring him out with a strong hand he'd show his signs and wonders and get glory in that Nation here come the man down when they cried and cried and I remember all the crying wouldn't deliver him until that time was fulfilled these things that we're seeing today couldn't happen 20 years ago or 40 years ago it's today it happens this is the hour this is the time yes amen now is the time it's fulfilled why God promised it and here it is they said 100 years ago that the baptism of the Holy Ghost could not be again they said 50 years ago the Holy Ghost but you Pentecostal people proved them that it was God's hour to pour out the Holy Ghost no matter what the Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran said you stayed right with God's word man of Courage went out there and held on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost come and they spoke in tongues and magnified God nobody can tell you any different God's is interpreter you got it you might not be able to explain it but you know you got it who can explain God nobody can I can't tell you how God can show a vision but I know it happens I can't see how God can do these things it's not my business to explain it he's abides alone he's Elohim the self-sufficient one I'm just his servant I know he promised it and I know a chair that's one thing I know I know that that he's the same yesterday today and forever I know he promises God's here to make it his promised true yeah God's provided way Israel was provided a prophet had Vindicated the word and they were brought out this Prophet Moses he lived for several years in the wilderness 40 years struggling with these people trying to keep them till they to get them to the promised land it come to a place a man had to die he's 120 years old it wasn't a place for him to die when he got ready to die God provided him a Roth the Roth that he had smokee in the wilderness the Roth that had followed him that they drank from God provided him a rock a place to die where Moses could die a decent death Upon This Rock God let me die on that same Rock that's where I want that rock was Christ Jesus yes sir a he died up on that rock and Eed paw beers God sent him a bunch of angels why not a bunch of his Elders because no one could take him where he was going but Angels they packed him into the presence of God he needed Paul beer and God provided and he went God's provided way Hallelujah to God en walked 500 years with God and he pleased him he need a highway to go home on God provided it Elijah had cursed jezz Bell about her painted face and her way she' got all the people doing and he tired and weary and is about ready to go home he was so old he couldn't hardly walk across Jorden God provided away for him the cross jarden he wanted to go up into heaven to meet God God sent a chariot of fire down in horses and Tuck him up God's provided way amen God's provided way he always does it just exact uh right yes sir God provides a away always yes the wise men when they were on their Road from up in Babylon they were seeing a way they wanted to go down because they knew this King was to be born they needed a compass God provided a star they left everything else behind they didn't need compasses they followed the star it was God's provided way God provided way they followed the star until they found the perfect light oh the world needed a savior one day they was lost they didn't know it they thought they were saved but they needed a savior God provided a son for the Savior why no one else could do it there was no man on Earth no man in heaven nowhere was able to do it God overshadowed a virgin she conceived and brought forth a Manchild and that Manchild was not Jewish or Gentile he was God manifested In the Flesh the only one that could redeem his blood saves us his blood heals us it's that blood that we can stand on to any promise that he made God promised to do it God only meets a worshipper through the blood and ear the blood Israel had one place to meet God not in God's got one place today he he meets the worshipper not at the Methodist Baptist or Pentecostal he meets him under the blood that's the only provided Place God has not in an organization not in a union but in the blood is where Jesus Christ meets his worshipper when I see the blood that's God's provided we he the church had been thoroughly convinced when they seen him that he was a messiah when the little woman at the well when she needed a savior she needed something to show she'd been to church and everything else and they' seen this Creed and that Creed till she turned to be a prostitute it turned her on the street one day she was going to get a bucket of water about 11:00 in the day and there said a man a Jew up here at those little panoramic and she said uh when she went to drop her bucket down on the window to get the water she heard a man say woman bring me a drink and she said she turn quickly and think him just to be an ordinary Jew or he was just human as far as the body was concerned he was a man eat drink slept like we do he was so much human till he could die and yet he was God then we find out that when said it's not customary if few Jews ask Samaritans such things as that he said but if you knew who you were talking to you'd ask me for a drink said go get your husband and come here she said I have no husband said thou has said the truth you've got five and the one you're living with now is not yours what happened God had provided something for her she said sir I perceive that you are a prophet we know the when the Messiah cometh he'll tell us these things that's what he'll do the word says so we're looking for it I'm sick and tired of all this stuff there Creeds and things Pharisees Sadducees and rodians whatever it might be but we know a messiah's coming when he comes what do you say about it he said I am he amen God had provided a way she left the water pot a changed woman had run into the City and said come see a man who told me the things I've done isn't this the Messiah Peter listened to Andrew's story many times had listen to he to Andrew talk about John introducing a messiah and a man and all these things taking place it's all mystery to Peter but one day he come with Andrew to see Jesus and when he got in the presence of Jesus Jesus looked at him and he said your name is Simon and you're the son of Jonas God had provided the way for Peter to see who he was he was that Messiah now we find out that after Jesus had died and ascended into heaven the church needed power to witness God give him a Pentecost he provided a Pentecost 2,000 years as passed friends 2,000 years has passed in these latter days we have got so man has got into the system of Christianity and has perverted again hybrid it to Creeds churches denominations intellectual speeches until the power in the real thing of the gospel of Christ is practically lost and here we are with word promised for this last days what will happen what will take place man don't believe it they've got away from it you yes if the Christians say I belong to so and so that doesn't mean one thing you got to be a Christian by birth now we got the whole thing into a babyon again after 2,000 years the church today needs power and Truth again oh God raised up his son that this would be taken care of for he said a little while in the world will see me any more yet you'll see me for I'll be with you even in you we find out in Hebrews 13:8 he's the same yesterday today and forever we find out in Malachi 4 that he promised us a message in the last days that would restore the faith of the people back to the fathers again he promised it in the last days he also promised in John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also even more than this or greater than this shall he do for I go to my father he's speaking one day they said master show us a sign he said a weaken adulterous generation seeks after a sign that's the generation we're living in today he said and I'll give him a sign for as Jonas was in the belly the whale three days and nights so must the son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and night what kind of a sign would a wicked and adulterous generation find out the resurrection sign that's what we are promised today the Resurrection sign that he's still alive he's the same yesterday today and forever he said as it was in the days of lot as we went through it last night a days of lot what happened in the days of lot so would it be at the coming of the son of man these things were promised many more scriptures to keep from taking up time a little while and the world won't see me no more Cosmos the art the church age they won't see me no more yet ye shall see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age Jesus Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever what is it it's God's provided sign God's provided way Abraham waiting for the Sun the last sign that he saw before the destruction of the Gentiles was God manifested in human flesh that know the secrets of the heart of Sarah when she was in the tent Jesus said that'll return again at the coming of the son of man brother sister I believe we're living in that day I believe this is the day of the promise you've got to have faith in watch your doing if you haven't got faith if you just taking it presumbly the word presume according to Webster needs to Adventure without Authority but when the word promises and God stands behind that word you're not presuming anymore you're doing exactly what God Said do and he's Duty bound to back it up Hallelujah great famous revivalist many years ago I seen him when I was a little boy was Paul Raider he told a story one day it's always stuck with me he said one day he was cutting wood is a logger up in orgon and said his boss told him go up top the hill he was dreaming that where he was really at at the time he was down in the islands and took a fever real hot and he was dying they went for a doctor but it's Miles and Miles Away by canoe before the doctor could get there Paul began to fade away get sicker and sicker he called his faithful wife he said dear it's getting dark in the room darker the closing in and he went back into a coma and what he did he said he dreamed when he was in this a coma that his boss stand him up to cut a certain tree he found the tree he fell the tree stuck his ax into it and reached down to pick it up he just couldn't pick it up said his strength was depleted he just couldn't pick it up he said all the size that tree is surely I can pick that up let me try again and he got down and he lifted he just toil till his War out he sat down the side of the tree and said I just don't know what I'll do the boss requires this tree down there at the camp and I'm too weak to bring it down that he heard the sweetest voice he ever heard it was his voice and but said when he turned to see who his boss was it was the Lord Jesus he said Paul what are you fighting so about what are you all flustrated about you see that water running there so why don't you just stole the log in the river and ride it down ride it to the camp he jumped on the log and started down over the riffle screaming to the top of his voice I'm riding on it I'm a riding on it brother sister Jesus Christ promised these things to happened in the last days I believe that we're living here I believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever I don't know how it's happened but I'm riding on it I believe that it's a truth because it's a gospel God's provided way I believe it is a message of the hour the time end it's God's provided way I'm riding on it won't you jump on with me while we bow our heads Heavenly Father we are riding into Glory upon Thy word we believe that Thy word is truth oh God May every man and woman tonight climb aboard the word and remember as they go along down through the Journey they can confess I'm riding on God's promise it'll take me right into Glory it's God's provided way for me today Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you said a little while in the world won't see me no more yet ye shall see me for I will be with you even in you you promised us Lord we would see you the Greeks come one time and said sir we would see Jesus and they was granted that privilege and tonight Lord we want to see you too it's our heart's desire no one can ever hear of you unless they want to see you then if these Greeks was permitted to see you and you provided a way for us to see you you always make a way because you're the same yesterday today and forever a servant brought these Greeks into your presence and they got to see you grant us the same privilege tonight father may we as servants bring this audience into your presence and May we see Jesus tonight who is the same yesterday today and forever Grant it Lord Save The Lost Lord if there be a man woman boy or girl when we see our nation so polluted with murders and Cutthroats and perverts and to see the corruption in the nation today and to see the corruption in the churches and see them leading to that ecumenical Slaughter up there because they are not going God's provided way they're going by the way of some Creed instead of coming by the word God we pray that real genuine born Christians as are illustrated by being real Ducks they my sheep hear my voice a stranger they won't follow Lord your voice is the word that's always been your provided way for the church and for the people is your word Thy word is the truth and you are the word and the Bible tells us the word of God is sharper than a two-edged sword a discerner of the thoughts and intents of their heart why couldn't Israel see their Messiah when they saw that he was that word when he could discern the thoughts that was in their heart how didn't they they understood it through the prophets that the prophets could but when the fullness of God was made into his son and he lived among us then they failed to see it because they were blinded Lord those who have their eyes open tonight may we see Jesus in our midst May every sick person be healed may this sett it Lord that they'll never know more from this hour on but what will believe that you are the Messiah they coming God's way many of them are here tonight dying there's many here tonight that probably won't be here a week from today if you your help doesn't come father you're only responsible for what you promised but you did promise that we would see you you promised that what you did we' do also this is the hour I've confessed it I believe it I heard you say so uh your word says so you confirm it uh know it's true now let it be known Lord it has been written now let it be done for the kingdom of God's sake amen I don't believe we go to call prayer line I believe I'll just use it from right here how many of you sick now will you be your holding your hand witness in your seat how many of you will witness the same thing brother brandom I'm really not saved will you raise your hand pray for me God bless you you that's good that's God bless you I'm not saved now you that raised your hands and you that didn't but brother BR truly I want to be saved it's my heart I believe that there's nothing left for anyone in the world what more what could you achieve would be greater than your salvation pray for me I want to be saved would you raise your hand all over the bilding where I want how many of you haven't received the Holy Spirit say I know I must receive it raise your hand I I want to all right it's quite a few that has it now Christ keeps his word and you got to keep your faith in him he is the word now Hebrews the fourth chapter said that the word of God which is Christ Christ is the word you all know that say amen he is the word the same yesterday today and forever what he was in Moses he also was in Elijah what he was in Elijah he was in John what he was in John he complet himself and and Jesus and today he's the same as he was and and still God's word word prophesied for the day which makes him the light that lights up and vindicates the promised word we're at the end time friends Jesus is present I know you've heard that what if you never did see in your life and you never had a sense of sight no human being did but every once in a while you feel a real warm feeling I had a sight I could see and I tell it was a sun you say I don't know how it happens but I get a feeling like warm you can feel I say that's a sun what is a sun it's a light what is a light it all be a new world you but what if I told you Jesus Christ was standing here now what if I told you he's in the midst of us he promised it wherever two or three are gathered in my name there I am in their midst there I am now that's either the truth to me this is all the truth or it isn't any of the truth amen this is either the right or isn't right now as far as saving you he did that when he died at Calvary healing you he did that when he died at Calvary you believe that the word said he did now the only thing that he could do if he was standing here with this suit on that he gave me would only be proved to you he was Messiah not the nail scars in his hand any hypocrite can do that but nail scars and blood over his face and marks and things that can be done that's been many person even crucified like him that isn't it but his life what was in him the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing it's a life that in him it pro not because he was a Jew did the little woman at the well believing to be the Messiah because he could discern the thoughts in her heart that made him Messiah but that was the way the Messiah introduced himself in the days gone by that was his provided way to make himself known that's his provided way according to the scripture for this age do you believe that now each one of you here I'm a stranger I've looked around I don't see a person that I know everybody in here that doesn't know me and knows I know nothing about you raise up your hands solid everywhere this personally on this cop raised up his hand he didn't know me nobody knows me but remember God does know you God knows you now if he proves that he's here what is it brother BR it's a gift what is a gift what is a gift anyhow not to take something and use something say I got a gift of healing I go out and heal this one heal that one if I could I'd certainly do it that's but a gift you you you misinterpret a gift a gift is just get yourself out of the way and let the Holy Spirit use you see that's the gift that's what a minister is he Don't Preach what he wants to preach he just gets himself out of the way it's a gift and inspiration comes and he he speaks to the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and the other gift is the same way and ministerial gifts and so forth has been there's first of god-given gifts is first apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelist that's the offices that's our gifts now Jesus Christ promised that he would do do this in the last days if he does it if he promises that and will do it how many will believe in accept him tonight raise up your hand say I will accept him how many in here then thank you how many in here has never been in one of the meetings before raise up your hands mine nearly half the crown how many believes before he does it you believe anyhow God bless you now look if I've told you the truth God's obligated to answer me he will he puts his words in your mouth and they materialize that's thought it's his words that has to do it I've sent my word it won't return void now if I could heal I would do it just like The Honorable late brother Upshaw that was talking about that old man sitting back there in that wheelchair a gallon old man I would have healed him if I could I started to leave the platform frankly and I turned around and saw him in a vision going walking called him told him what it was and that was it he got up and walk come the platform touched these toes after being a for 66 years same night a color lady with her baby down on the side I said I see a a doctor with glasses on and and is operating on a little color girl it's paralyzed her from her throat an old colored woman he couldn't hardly hold her off the platform she said lordy Mercy that's my baby and here she come bunch of ushers couldn't even hold her I said Andy it won't do no good to come up here that is that's God I said won't do no good to come here just believe and she got down on her knees and started praying I looked across the audience I seen an alley like I seen a little color girl with a doll in her arms going down down through the alley I looked at the little color girl look back and it's the same one I said it's answered up she got away from the cot it's God see it's God see he can't no one can heal it's your faith in God now the Bible said that he's a high priest right now that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities do you believe that a high priest now if he's a high priest how would he act if he's the same yesterday day and forever he'd act the same yesterday today and forever now you pray and let the Holy Spirit then you say to God God this man standing there doesn't know me but what he says makes sense you are the same you are Christ I'm sick I need and if you let me either if I haven't got the faith to do it let somebody that I know have faith and let it you call and let let let me or that person Touch the Hem of your garment in glory then if that man is out of the way then you use his mouth to speak back and just do it the same way you did when you were on Earth I'll know that you're the same yesterday today and forever let us spow our heads now Lord Jesus turning from evangelism to prophetic work but yet I believe you Lord you promised it and I pray that you will grant it tonight granted hear me when this audience leaves here tonight and we go home may we stay like those who come from emus did not our hearts burn within us as he talked to us along the way Jesus was raised from the dead they didn't know what they were talking to him they didn't know it but when he got them in the house and closed the door then he did something the way he did it before his crucifixion that opened their eyes they seen it was him again Lord May our hearts burn as we go home tonight as theirs did for we know that you spoke to us along the way do the things tonight that you did when you were on Earth for you are the same yesterday today and forever we ask in Jesus name amen now being in prayer just believe let's consecrate this side first no matter where you're at in the building believe God I wish that everyone would be real reever set quiet pray this is totally impossible I was talking this morning at the ministerial breakfast a paradox a paradox is incredible something incredible but yet true you know that the Holy Spirit would stand here and speak something in that audience to people that I don't know it would have to be a paradox it's something cannot be explained I don't know that he will I'm just hoping that he will trusting that he will I just pray and say Lord Jesus I want to touch your garment and I I have a need I promise you Lord I I'll serve you all my life God wants you to repent if you're not repented repent say I want to repent Lord I want you to heal me I want you to bless me heal me now Lord I'm your servant let's goad did you give out prayer cards today I just go to ask Billy for if he doesn't do it i' call a prayer line but they never give out prayer cards today just said rever believe I in the name of Jesus Christ I take every Spirit here under my control for the glory of God that his word might be made knowing that at the day of the Judgment we'll have no excuse I look this way and believe now pray with all your heart just pray humbly don't fight it just relax yourself and say Lord you made the promise I believe you that's what I have to do I know there's no
