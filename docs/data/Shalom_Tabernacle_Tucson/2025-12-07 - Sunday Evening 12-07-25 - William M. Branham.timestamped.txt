[10:41] Jesus.
[10:46] Like the fragrance

[11:01] Jesus.
[11:03] Jesus,
[11:08] let all heaven
[11:11] and earth
[11:14] proclaim.
[11:19] Kings
[11:22] and kingdoms,
[11:24] they will all
[11:27] pass away.
[11:29] But there is something
[11:33] about
[11:35] that day.

[17:27] And when I look upon his face, the one
[17:33] who saved me by his grace.
[17:38] When he takes me by the hand and leads
[17:44] me through the promised land,

[17:51] glorious day
[17:54] that will be.
[18:01] Oh, I thank God
[18:05] for
[18:07] the lighthouse.
[18:10] Oh, I owe my life to him.
[18:18] For Jesus
[18:20] is the lighthouse.
[18:25] And from the rocks of sin, all he has
[18:33] shown
[18:34] his light
[18:36] around me
[18:39] so that I
[18:42] could clearly
[18:44] see.
[18:45] Oh, if it wasn't
[18:49] for the lighthouse,
[18:53] just tell me where
[18:56] would this ship. Sing it one more time.
[18:59] Oh, I thank God
[19:04] for the lighthouse.

[19:15] Lord Jesus
[19:18] is the lighthouse
[19:22] and from the rocks of sin. Well, he has
[19:30] shown
[19:31] his life
[19:33] around me
[19:36] so that I could clearly
[19:40] see.
[19:42] If it
[19:45] wasn't for
[19:47] the lighthouse,
[19:50] tell me where would this ship be?
[19:57] It's going to keep J.

[23:56] Worthy is the lamb.
[24:02] Oh, worthy is the lamb.
[24:11] I've seen the lightning flashing
[24:15] and I've heard the thunder roll.
[24:21] I felt s breakers clashing
[24:26] trying to conquer my soul.
[24:31] I've heard the voice of my savior
[24:37] telling me still to fight on. Aren't you
[24:40] thankful for this? He promised never to
[24:44] leave me.
[24:47] Never to leave me alone.
[24:51] No, never alone.

[27:18] He promised never to leave me,
[27:23] never to leave me alone.
[27:30] Amen.

[27:36] to remember Sister Ellie who uh wasn't
[27:39] feeling well and also travel in mercy

[34:14] just want to love you more and more. How
[34:18] I long
[34:20] to be deeper
[34:22] in love.
[34:30] He is all
[34:33] I need.
[34:36] He is all
[34:39] I need.
[34:43] Jesus
[34:45] is all
[34:47] I need.
[34:53] He is all
[34:56] I need.
[34:59] He is all
[35:01] I need.
[35:04] Lord Jesus

[35:14] need. Yes, you are all
[35:18] I need.
[35:21] You are all
[35:23] I need.
[35:27] Jesus,

[35:32] I need.
[35:37] You are all
[35:39] I need.
[35:42] You are all

[35:55] I take you now. Oh, I take
[36:00] you now.

[36:12] all
[36:13] I need.
[36:18] Yes, I take
[36:22] you now.
[36:24] I take
[36:27] you now
[36:30] for
[36:33] all
[36:34] I need here.
[36:37] Let's all stand to our feet as we
[36:39] prepare to go to um the word of God and
[36:43] then to the table of the Lord. We're
[36:45] going to listen to this message
[36:46] communion preached in 1957
[36:49] and start at paragraph number 12. I'd
[36:51] like to greet each of you. I trust the
[36:53] Lord will bless you. There is the
[36:56] scripture in Matthew chapter 27 that
[36:59] brother Random will be reading from if
[37:01] you'd like to prepare to go there.
[37:04] Amen. We certainly thank the Lord for
[37:07] all his many blessings to us. Amen.
[37:10] Amen. God bless you richly.
[37:14] Amen.
[37:20] And as we prepare to go to the tape,
[37:22] let's sing that old hymn of the church.
[37:25] Only believe,
[37:34] only
[37:39] that all things are possible.
[37:46] Only
[37:48] believe.
[37:51] Only
[37:53] believe. Hallelujah.
[37:57] Only
[37:59] believe
[38:02] that all things are possible.
[38:08] Only. Can we make that confession? Lord,
[38:11] I believe.
[38:13] Sing it. Lord,
[38:16] I believe.
[38:19] Oh, Lord,
[38:22] I believe.
[38:25] and all things
[38:28] all of my heart.
[38:31] Lord,
[38:32] I believe.
[38:36] Lord,
[38:38] I believe.
[38:41] Lord,
[38:43] I believe.
[38:47] All things are possible.
[38:52] Lord, I really
[38:56] bless you. You may be seated. Brother,
[39:00] I got a new Bible tonight was given to
[39:03] me by some Dunker brothers and it's kind
[39:06] of a big thing and it's first time I've
[39:08] ever preached out of it. It's a little
[39:09] awkward to me. Now uh know that we have
[39:14] met for one purpose that is to to
[39:18] further the cause of Christ and to find
[39:22] peace in our souls and to make us better
[39:26] men and women better servants of the
[39:29] Lord. And if we come for any other idea,
[39:33] well then we will not be blessed of the
[39:36] Lord. We've come for help. We've come
[39:39] looking to God. And this is a house of
[39:42] correction where God gives us of his
[39:45] blessings and corrects us from the
[39:47] wrong. Now just before we open the word
[39:51] or or ask the Holy Spirit to help us,
[39:54] let us bow our heads. Blessed heavenly
[39:57] father, into thine divine presence we
[40:00] present ourselves now as listeners to
[40:04] the gospel
[40:06] and as speakers of the word, circumcised
[40:11] lips that speak and ears that hear and
[40:15] hearts that receive. And may the Holy
[40:19] Spirit divide to us tonight and impart
[40:22] the truths of God's eternal grace to
[40:26] every one of us that when we leave this
[40:28] building tonight, we'll say like those
[40:31] who coming from Emas, did not our hearts
[40:34] burn within us because he talked to us
[40:37] along the road for we ask that in Jesus
[40:40] name. Amen. Amen.
[40:45] over in the book of St. Matthew's gospel
[40:50] and the 26th chapter the 27th and 28th
[40:53] verse for a text I wish to read. And he
[40:58] helped the cup and when he gave thanks
[41:02] and he gave it to them and said drink ye
[41:05] all of it for this is my blood of the
[41:10] new testament which is shed for many for
[41:13] the remission of sins.
[41:16] But I say unto you, I will not drink it
[41:21] forth of the fruit of the vine until the
[41:24] day when I drink it a new with you in my
[41:28] father's kingdom.
[41:30] And now we're going to speak on the
[41:34] communion.
[41:36] And this is the original communion
[41:39] night.
[41:41] And communion was held first way down in
[41:46] Egypt. The first of the communion which
[41:49] was the the Passover lamb that was slain
[41:53] which was the type of Christ.
[41:57] Many of us are familiar with that
[41:59] blessed old story of how that they who
[42:04] took the communion down there walked
[42:06] through the wilderness for 40 years. And
[42:10] when they come out, there wasn't a
[42:13] feeble one among them. And there even
[42:17] their clothes was not even threadbear.
[42:20] For 40 years, God had kept them.
[42:25] What a blessed assurance it is to us
[42:28] tonight. If that be the type, then
[42:31] Christ is the antitype.
[42:34] and how that God delivered the children.
[42:37] And in the taking of the communion was
[42:41] the difference between life and death.
[42:46] Those who were on the inside under the
[42:49] shed blood took the communion. No one
[42:53] could take the communion outside being
[42:56] under the shed blood. The blood of the
[42:59] lamb was shed first and then was put on
[43:03] the lin and the doorpost. The little is
[43:06] the cross timber and on the doorpost and
[43:09] then the lamb was roasted and was and
[43:13] and was eaten with bitter herbs and they
[43:16] girded themselves after the blood was
[43:19] shed and they passed under the shed
[43:21] blood. They were gired and ready for the
[43:26] march. Amen.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; And it's a very beautiful type tonight
[43:32] of people who take communion is not to
[43:35] be associated or affiliated with things
[43:39] of the world anymore.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; They must come under the blood first and
[43:45] be cleansed from all sin which is
[43:48] unbelief and then be shaved with the
[43:52] preparation of the gospel.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. uh having on the whole armor of
[43:57] God ready for this summons at any time.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; And it was the the sign that the death
[44:05] angel could not go beneath that blood.
[44:10] The death angel had to rise and go over
[44:12] the blood.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; And that's where the poet got the
[44:15] inspiration saying, "When I see the
[44:18] blood, I'll pass over you."
[44:23] It was near the hour of deliverance when
[44:26] they accepted the communion, the the
[44:31] roasted lamb and the the herbs that they
[44:34] taken before leaving. Now, in the
[44:38] antitype that we're to speak of, it was
[44:41] many years ago tonight that Jesus taken
[44:46] what we know as the Lord's supper, the
[44:49] communion.
[44:51] And there's something about it that he
[44:53] was going to talk to his disciples and
[44:55] just before going away he wanted to talk
[44:59] it over with them
[45:02] and it's a they had a room prepared.
[45:06] It was a time of fellowship
[45:10] and the communion does mean a
[45:13] fellowship.
[45:14] Many of the churches have closed
[45:17] communion that is just to their own
[45:20] church when they have a communion. But
[45:23] here we are not a denomination. We have
[45:26] a open communion for all. For we believe
[45:29] that every believer
[45:32] has a right to the table of the Lord and
[45:36] to fellowship around the good things of
[45:39] God. with that every believer,
[45:41] regardless of creed, color, or whatever
[45:44] he may be, that all have been made drink
[45:48] of the selfsame blessing,
[45:52] Christ.
[45:54] Now, this great hour had approached our
[45:58] Lord. One of the most trying times of
[46:02] all of his earthly journey were just at
[46:06] hand. Testing time. Jesus had to go
[46:11] through testing just as we go through
[46:14] testing. And the Bible said that every
[46:18] son that cometh to God must first be
[46:22] tested,
[46:24] trained, corrected.
[46:28] Now many people it is a showdown
[46:31] when the testing time comes.
[46:34] It's a time of approving place.
[46:38] And the Bible said if we cannot stand
[46:41] the testing then we become illegitimate
[46:45] children. We are professing God to be
[46:48] our father and then he is not our
[46:51] father. For if we have correctly
[46:55] and with all of our heart received the
[46:59] Lord Jesus as our personal savior, there
[47:02] is nothing in this earth or in all dark
[47:08] eternity can can ever separate us from
[47:11] the love of God that's in Christ Jesus.
[47:15] I'm astounded in this day and I've
[47:18] always been when people profess to be
[47:22] Christians and the first little trial
[47:25] comes along, they fall by the wayside.
[47:29] It goes to show that it was an
[47:32] intellectual conception of Christ.
[47:36] That's the reason so many doesn't hold
[47:39] out today is because it's an
[47:41] intellectual conception.
[47:45] Intellectually you could believe it but
[47:48] it goes further than that.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; To accept Christ is to accept the person
[47:55] of Christ. Many of us accept religion of
[48:00] Christianity upon the learning of
[48:02] creeds.
[48:04] Other accept Christianity upon doctrines
[48:08] of baptism.
[48:10] Others believe that they are Christians
[48:12] because of some emotion as they have
[48:15] exercised
[48:17] such as shouting or dancing in the
[48:20] spirit or speaking with tongues or
[48:24] having some marvelous gift to present.
[48:28] All those things are good in their
[48:31] place. But to accept Christ is to accept
[48:35] the persons of Christ.
[48:39] If then these other things just
[48:41] automatically fall in line.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; Now
[48:47] if God did not spare his own son from
[48:51] the cruel testing
[48:54] then he will not spare you or I from the
[48:57] cruel testing.
[48:59] And Jesus was here confronting the
[49:03] greatest test that he had ever had.
[49:06] Gethsemane laid just before him. Were
[49:10] that once and final all sufficient test
[49:15] must come
[49:18] when the burdens of the entire world
[49:22] laid upon his blessed shoulders.
[49:27] There was no one in all heavens or earth
[49:31] could ever stood it but him.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; And to know that all of the sins of past
[49:40] sins and present sins and future sins
[49:44] rested upon this decision.
[49:48] And it was one of the most greatest
[49:52] victories that Christ every one approved
[49:57] his great messiahship is when he said to
[50:01] God, "Not my will, thine be done."
[50:06] &gt;&gt; That was the greatest victory he had
[50:08] ever won.
[50:11] All the demons of torment was around to
[50:15] tip him and time.
[50:19] And when we get right with God, when our
[50:23] hearts become pure and the Holy Spirit
[50:27] has taken its place in our hearts, it's
[50:31] the most glorious thing to have testing.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible tells us that our
[50:37] testings and trials are more precious to
[50:40] us than silver and gold of this world.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; So we are should be thankful.
[50:49] I do not wish to bring my own self into
[50:53] some experience.
[50:55] But just as it comes on my mind, I
[50:59] remember the great and final test that I
[51:02] had of my Christian experience.
[51:06] It was yonder in the hospital out here
[51:08] on Spring Hill when my wife was laying
[51:12] in the morg down here a carp.
[51:17] And she had just moved out of this life
[51:20] to be with God.
[51:22] And the testings and trials was all not
[51:27] just someone saying, "Billy, you're holy
[51:29] over." That wasn't much testing.
[51:34] And
[51:35] these other little trials and so forth
[51:38] of criticism from the man that I work
[51:40] with. It wasn't much testing.
[51:44] But my great hour of testing comes when
[51:48] the doctor a dare that I rehearsed it to
[51:51] him yesterday in the hospital when we
[51:53] sat together and when he come down the
[51:57] hall to meet me and took me by the hand
[52:00] and said, "Billy, your baby is dying
[52:04] and there's not a chance for it to live.
[52:09] It's got two burglar menitis."
[52:12] I said, "Surely not, doctor."
[52:16] And his mother laying a cart
[52:20] and I go in. He said, "Just come with
[52:23] me." And we went to the laboratory and
[52:26] there he picked up a little glass tube
[52:30] and he shook it and there seemed to be a
[52:32] streak in it. He says, "That is the
[52:35] menitis
[52:37] germ and it's in the baby." We drew this
[52:40] from the spine to release the spasm and
[52:44] he said in this we find that it's two
[52:46] bir menitis
[52:49] said it nursed it from its mother and
[52:52] said if that baby should live it would
[52:55] be crippled afflicted but he said by the
[53:00] mercies of God the baby is going to be
[53:04] with its mother.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; I said doctor I want to see the baby. He
[53:09] said, "You can't do it, Billy. Because
[53:12] of Billy, Paul, your boy, said you would
[53:15] pack the germs back to him." And after
[53:19] trying to encourage me the best that he
[53:21] knew how, when he left the building, I
[53:25] flipped around and went down into the
[53:28] basement. And when I got there, the
[53:31] hospital at that time wasn't fixed as it
[53:34] is now. And the window was up and the
[53:37] screen was out in some flies that got
[53:40] into the little fella's eyes. And I
[53:42] shoot the flies away and looked down at
[53:45] her little body all drawed in her little
[53:48] legs moving back and forth.
[53:52] And I said to her, "Sherry, honey, do
[53:55] you know daddy?" And it seemed like that
[53:58] she was kind to wave her little hand to
[54:01] me about eight or nine months old.
[54:05] And I looked at her and she was
[54:07] suffering so hard, a little innocent
[54:10] baby, until one of her little baby blue
[54:14] eyes crossed.
[54:17] So much pain.
[54:20] Oh, I would have took it at any time.
[54:23] and her dead. And I knelt down on my
[54:27] knees with the doors closed. And I said,
[54:31] "Oh, God's father,
[54:34] there lays my wife, the baby's mother,
[54:38] laying yonder in the undertaker's m.
[54:43] There's Billy Paul on the bed sick. And
[54:47] here's my baby dying. You surely Lord
[54:51] won't take her.
[54:53] I love her. And she resembles her
[54:57] mother. I want to raise her.
[55:02] Won't you please, oh God, spare my
[55:06] baby's life? And as I looked up, and as
[55:10] you all know, I've always been subject
[55:13] to vision. It seemed like a black sheep
[55:16] began to unfold
[55:18] coming down. And as if God took my
[55:22] prayer and throwed it right back in my
[55:24] face. I said, "What have I done, God?
[55:30] Have I transgressed your laws that I
[55:34] should have this punishment? If it is
[55:36] you just reveal it, and I'll repent,
[55:40] I'll do anything, but don't take my
[55:44] baby." And I seen she was going anyhow.
[55:48] I raised up and then the tempter came to
[55:52] me. There was the one time in all my
[55:58] life that I can call was the crucial
[56:02] moment my Gethsemane
[56:04] when I was just barely holding to the
[56:07] bed. The devil said, "There you are.
[56:11] That's the reward for trying to serve
[56:14] him. You mean that he'll take that young
[56:18] 22year-old mother and lay her yonder as
[56:21] a corpse in the mar and will take the
[56:25] precious baby your own flesh and blood
[56:28] and slam your prayer right in your face
[56:32] and then you need to say that you'll
[56:35] surely
[56:36] I was standing between opinions it had
[56:40] to be decided
[56:42] then I put my hand over on little head.
[56:46] I said, "The Lord gave and the Lord
[56:50] takes away. Blessed be the name of the
[56:54] Lord." Amen. I felt relief. I said,
[56:58] "Sherry, honey, daddy cannot go where
[57:02] you are now, but daddy can come someday.
[57:08] I'll lay you on the arm of mother and
[57:10] bury you, but daddy will see you again
[57:14] someday. Amen.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Mr. Eer, who's probably sitting present
[57:19] now. I can't see through the crowd. The
[57:22] ex state senator here of Indiana. I was
[57:24] going up the highway. Mr. Eiser, I guess
[57:26] you can well remember. I had my hands
[57:29] behind me going up to the graveyard rack
[57:33] with blood weeping. I used to go up
[57:36] there and in the evening an old turtle
[57:38] dove would set over in the tree and
[57:40] would sing to me and seem like down to
[57:44] the breezes of old pines and trees seem
[57:49] like a song would whisper to it. There's
[57:52] a land beyond the river
[57:55] &gt;&gt; that we call the sweet.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; We only reach that shore by faith
[58:01] degree. One by one we gain the portal
[58:06] there to dwell with the immortal.
[58:08] Someday they'll ring those golden bells
[58:12] for you and me.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Mr. Eisler driving his old truck jumped
[58:18] out and put his arm around. He said,
[58:20] "I've heard you preaching on the street
[58:23] corner, Billy. I've seen you standing in
[58:26] the tabernacle. I've heard you at the
[58:28] hymn sings how you exalted Christ. what
[58:32] you said he was. So now he has taken
[58:36] your father, your brother, your wife,
[58:40] and your baby. So now what does he mean
[58:43] to you? I said, Mr. Eer, if he would
[58:47] send me to the regions of the law, I
[58:51] still love him. Or one day down under in
[58:55] an old coal shed, something happened
[58:58] down here in my heart that there is
[59:01] nothing that can rub it out. It was
[59:05] nothing that I did. It was God's eternal
[59:08] grace that helped me in the hours of
[59:12] great decision.
[59:15] And when our blessed Lord in the
[59:18] Gethsemane
[59:20] went down when he was re to be rejected
[59:25] at Jerusalem and the council was going
[59:27] to take his life when the eternal
[59:31] destination of every soul that ever was
[59:35] or would be on the earth rested upon his
[59:40] decision.
[59:42] Oh, how little mine was
[59:46] comparison to that. How little yours was
[59:51] in comparison to that. Such a pity that
[59:55] we can't stand these little things.
[1:00:00] But in that great crucial hour until he
[1:00:04] suffered knowing all things
[1:00:08] until the water and blood separated in
[1:00:12] his body and great drops of sweat like
[1:00:16] blood dropped down his brow.
[1:00:20] He died more death in Gethsemane than he
[1:00:23] did on the cross.
[1:00:27] He was just at the event of this, just
[1:00:30] before the great battle was to start
[1:00:34] and he taught the communion. He brought
[1:00:38] his disciples together to talk over
[1:00:40] things with them. And that's the way he
[1:00:44] does you and I. Just before the great
[1:00:48] battle
[1:00:50] of life starts, before the great battle
[1:00:56] of right and wrong begins to battle
[1:00:58] within us, God brings us to a
[1:01:02] Gethsemane.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; He brings us to the communion
[1:01:07] and he talks it all over with us. Way
[1:01:12] out in Phoenix, Arizona, there used to
[1:01:14] be a little triota that used to sing for
[1:01:17] me. I would like to talk it over with
[1:01:20] Jesus. I'd like to say, Jesus, you love
[1:01:25] me when my path got so near.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; When it was so dim that I could see, no
[1:01:32] father, you love me when it was dim.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:38] And the little song goes on to say,
[1:01:40] "Well, I'd like to talk it over."
[1:01:44] And it's a good thing that men and women
[1:01:47] of this earth stop in lifong
[1:01:51] travel and talk it over with Jesus. Have
[1:01:55] communion with him in a fellowship. Then
[1:02:00] the battle begins of the testing and the
[1:02:03] trying.
[1:02:05] Every son that cometh to God must be
[1:02:08] tested. Amen.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:02:11] the communion
[1:02:13] is not a is not given for the purpose
[1:02:17] that many people think it is. It's
[1:02:21] taught by a certain denomination of
[1:02:24] church that communion is called the last
[1:02:27] right
[1:02:29] that it pertains to salvation.
[1:02:33] Communion does not pertain to salvation.
[1:02:38] Communion does not give you salvation.
[1:02:41] Whether you take it in your death or or
[1:02:43] what, it does not have nothing to do
[1:02:46] with your salvation.
[1:02:48] It is a commemoration.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus said in the gospel, he said, "This
[1:02:56] do in remembrance of me."
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:01] Not it leading or pointing to salvation,
[1:03:05] but it's in commemoration of a finished
[1:03:09] work.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; That's been done in you
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Spirit.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; It's a commemoration.
[1:03:19] Now, there's many that take the
[1:03:21] communion is not saved.
[1:03:25] Many eat the pastoral lambs and perish
[1:03:29] in the wilderness
[1:03:31] and many take the communion the days
[1:03:35] that will never see God.
[1:03:38] But you cannot be a partaker of his
[1:03:41] salvation and not see him because
[1:03:45] salvation is the gift of God.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; And communion is commemoration of the
[1:03:53] great also sufficient sacrifice that was
[1:03:56] made for that salvation.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:01] It's to let people see that we believe
[1:04:04] in the death, burial, and resurrection
[1:04:08] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; It represents the finished work.
[1:04:15] Salvation once was not completed and the
[1:04:19] offering of the goats, the sheep, the
[1:04:22] heers in the Old Testament because the
[1:04:26] Old Testament blood could not atone for
[1:04:29] sin. It could only cover sin. It was
[1:04:33] appointing to a time when it would be
[1:04:36] completed. Tomorrow night we're to get
[1:04:38] right in on that. But it was only a
[1:04:42] time. But when Jesus came and his blood
[1:04:47] was shed at Calvary, it was a complete
[1:04:51] divorcing of sin.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; It taken sin away. It's the only means
[1:04:58] of salvation.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; There is no church joining, no letters
[1:05:04] of fellowship.
[1:05:06] There is no ritual baptism. There's no
[1:05:10] communion or nothing in the ritual or
[1:05:14] any article that's been left of God as
[1:05:17] articles pertain to salvation. It's all
[1:05:20] in commemoration of the finished work.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Water baptism does not save you as much
[1:05:30] as people sometimes think it does. Water
[1:05:33] baptism is a commemoration of the death,
[1:05:37] burial, and resurrection of the law.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; It does not save you.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Communion is in commemoration of his
[1:05:48] great agony and his going out in his
[1:05:51] broken body and his blood that was shed.
[1:05:56] It is not the literal blood. It is not
[1:06:01] the literal body, but it's in
[1:06:04] commemoration of his literal body and of
[1:06:07] his precious blood. And we take this as
[1:06:12] order. And Jesus commanded us to do it
[1:06:16] as long as he stays the way we are to
[1:06:20] take it.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have a great beautiful picture
[1:06:26] over in the book of the Hebrew letter.
[1:06:29] in the seventh chapter. I would like to
[1:06:32] read just a little place in Hebrews 7 to
[1:06:37] get a context to go with this.
[1:06:42] For this Melchzdc,
[1:06:45] king of Salem, priest of the most high
[1:06:48] God, who met Abraham, returning from the
[1:06:52] slaughter of the kings, and blessed him,
[1:06:57] to whom the patriarch Abraham gave a
[1:07:00] tenth of all, first being by
[1:07:04] interpretation, the king of
[1:07:06] righteousness,
[1:07:08] after that the king of Salem, which is
[1:07:12] the king of peace.
[1:07:15] Notice we want to go back and think Paul
[1:07:19] here is referring back to an Old
[1:07:23] Testament character
[1:07:26] in the book of Genesis. We take up the
[1:07:29] life of Abraham from the 12th chapter of
[1:07:32] Genesis.
[1:07:34] God giving
[1:07:37] uh Abraham the promise and through
[1:07:41] Abraham would come the righteous seed
[1:07:44] and Abraham as believed by many to be a
[1:07:48] Jew. He was not. Abraham was a gentile a
[1:07:52] child from the city of Israel.
[1:07:56] And he became God's servant not because
[1:08:01] he was different from anyone else but
[1:08:04] because of the election of God.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; You are not saved because you are a good
[1:08:11] person. You're saved because Christ
[1:08:15] chose you.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; No man seeks God. God seeks man.
[1:08:23] Jesus said, "No man can come to me
[1:08:26] except my father draws him first."
[1:08:31] And if we could stop just for a few
[1:08:35] moments and realize the great
[1:08:39] importance of that one thing,
[1:08:44] that it was God who chose you,
[1:08:48] not willing that you should perish, but
[1:08:51] give to you the opportunity
[1:08:54] and called you and elected you to be his
[1:08:57] servant. While what could be more
[1:09:00] precious than that? Amen.
[1:09:05] Without you having a choice,
[1:09:08] it would be total impossible
[1:09:12] for any man to seek God.
[1:09:15] For he by nature is a sinner,
[1:09:20] and he has nothing within him to give a
[1:09:22] desire to serve God. Could you go to the
[1:09:27] pig and tell him he's wrong?
[1:09:31] He's a pig by nature.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Could you tell him his diet is wrong?
[1:09:38] Certainly not. By nature, he is a pig.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; You should tell him he'd be a lamb. But
[1:09:45] he's satisfied as a pig.
[1:09:48] And a sinner is satisfied as a sinner
[1:09:53] because his nature is a sinner.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; And here it is. We are ALL BORN in sin,
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; shaped in iniquity, come to the world
[1:10:05] speaking lies.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:08] by nature a child of disobedience
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; WITHOUT GOD WITHOUT hope
[1:10:18] of God abiding on us.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Help us.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; And by the loving grace of Christ,
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; GOD IN HIS SOVEREIGN GRACE AND HIS
[1:10:28] omnipotence
[1:10:29] at your heart and GIVES YOU THE BLESSED
[1:10:32] opportunity
[1:10:34] and sets you up the road.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. How could you turn that down?
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Changes your hold of God.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; TURNS YOU AROUND.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; And start you the other way.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, you'll be silly TO THE WORLD.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'LL be blessed in the sight of
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; blessed are they that do hunger and
[1:11:02] thirst for righteousness. or they shall
[1:11:05] be filled, said our Lord Jesus.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; God by his amazing grace.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; NOTICE IT WAS WHAT GOD DID,
[1:11:18] what God called.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; You had no will to call.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; YOU COULD HAVE NO DESIRE TO CALL because
[1:11:27] your nature was completely contrary to
[1:11:30] it.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:32] But God by election
[1:11:35] called you and turned you around and set
[1:11:38] your affection towards Christ and the
[1:11:40] things.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; How could we turn it down?
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Then God showed in Abraham what he would
[1:11:49] do for all. Not only was this blessed
[1:11:52] promise of the resurrection of eternal
[1:11:55] life given to Abraham, but to his seed
[1:11:58] after him. Yes,
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; the call the elected of God.
[1:12:04] And we notice that Abraham out in the
[1:12:07] fields where he was soldiing, his
[1:12:10] brother, he called it Lot. It was really
[1:12:14] his nephew, his brother's son.
[1:12:20] And the time come for the testing
[1:12:25] and not weakened under the testing. He
[1:12:29] is a perfect picture of the carnal
[1:12:32] believer today.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; When the testing comes to stay on the
[1:12:37] barren land, Abraham give him his
[1:12:41] choice.
[1:12:43] And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw the
[1:12:47] fields of valleys
[1:12:49] and it was full of grass. It was also
[1:12:53] full of fine homes. It was full of
[1:12:56] jeopard
[1:13:04] nature.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Loving this present world more than the
[1:13:08] things to come. Chose rather
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:13] live luxurious in this life than I have
[1:13:17] life here after.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Abraham, a perfect type of the true
[1:13:23] believer who's been washed in the blood
[1:13:27] of the lamb. whose affections are set on
[1:13:30] things above
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; THAT I'LL TAKE THE WAY with
[1:13:36] define
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; regardless if it cost my popularity
[1:13:43] whatever it cost I'll take the way
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; with the Lord's
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; and he chose to stay in the land where
[1:13:54] God placed him under the testing time.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; I wonder tonight if I'm speaking to
[1:14:04] people who once made a start
[1:14:06] to go through with God and when the
[1:14:10] testing time come, you chose rather to
[1:14:14] go back into the world and do the things
[1:14:16] of the world or did you take the rugged
[1:14:20] old way of salvation?
[1:14:24] Did you do like Moses when he was under
[1:14:27] testing?
[1:14:28] When he had his foot on the throne of
[1:14:31] Egypt, but he esteemed the riches of
[1:14:34] Christ. Amen. Greater treasures than all
[1:14:39] the riches of Egypt.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; He fortook Egypt. Did not care how much
[1:14:46] gold, how many coppers. He took God at
[1:14:50] his word and forsook the things of
[1:14:53] Egypt,
[1:14:55] carrying the reproach of Christ greater
[1:14:58] than the treasures of Egypt.
[1:15:01] God,
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; what do we do under the testing?
[1:15:06] When the hard trials come, when they say
[1:15:10] because that you separate yourself from
[1:15:12] the things of the world that you're a
[1:15:14] religious fanatic,
[1:15:16] does the strain come? It's got to come.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; And you've got to make the choice.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; But I'd rather abide under the shadow of
[1:15:30] the Almighty.
[1:15:32] I had rather take my way and like Jacob
[1:15:36] has a pillar of stone.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; I'd rather be considered by the world a
[1:15:41] crank.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Than to have all THE RICHES AND
[1:15:45] BLESSINGS that this world could afford
[1:15:47] to give
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; because greater is the blessings of God
[1:15:52] than all the riches and gold and silver
[1:15:55] of this world. Amen.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:16:00] notice then
[1:16:02] when the great testings come, Lot went
[1:16:06] down into sin. You remember he went from
[1:16:10] the mountain down into the plains. He
[1:16:14] backslid
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; like the a perfect representative of
[1:16:20] carnal Christianity today. so called
[1:16:23] choosing rather to take the road of
[1:16:26] ease, the far better at ease than to
[1:16:28] stand true in the time of trial.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; And he finally got in trouble.
[1:16:36] And you will too. Amen.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; When you choose that
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; better ease, remember you are going to
[1:16:44] get in trouble
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; something your sins will find you out
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; and God will catch up with you someday.
[1:16:55] And one day the kings, the gentile kings
[1:16:59] of the great region away came in and
[1:17:04] took Lot and his children, his wife, and
[1:17:07] all that he had and escape with them.
[1:17:12] And someday,
[1:17:14] my frail friend, if you don't stay under
[1:17:17] the blood, the kingdoms of Satan will
[1:17:22] overtake you and carry you away
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; if you don't stay under the blood.
[1:17:30] And Abraham, a type of the just,
[1:17:34] he was so concerned about his statue, a
[1:17:38] representative of the real true
[1:17:40] Christian that's tested and tried and
[1:17:44] been proven.
[1:17:47] Now, the women had a lot to do with it.
[1:17:51] Lot's wife was carnal, very carnal.
[1:17:54] She stands today in the fields there as
[1:17:58] a pillar of salt, as a disgrace to those
[1:18:01] who passed by.
[1:18:04] Sarah, a beautiful woman,
[1:18:07] she wanted to do what God wanted her to
[1:18:10] do.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; She respected her husband as we spoke so
[1:18:15] definitely on that last evening. And she
[1:18:18] stayed with Abraham
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; regardless of what come or went. She
[1:18:23] stayed with him because he stayed with
[1:18:26] the promise.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; That's the thing.
[1:18:32] Then when Lot was passed away, Abraham's
[1:18:35] heart went for him and he gathered the
[1:18:38] army of his own servant and went after
[1:18:42] his brother and a very beautiful type.
[1:18:46] They tucked their swords and shot those
[1:18:49] kings down till there was not one of
[1:18:51] them left.
[1:18:53] And that's the type of the gospel
[1:18:55] preachers. When he sees that sin has
[1:18:58] caught his church and caught the people,
[1:19:01] he takes the blessed old gospel, the
[1:19:04] sword of the spirit and he chops it and
[1:19:08] chops it until he cuts out sin from his
[1:19:12] chest. If he's a true servant of God,
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; he removes all the nonsense, the
[1:19:19] tattling, the backbiting.
[1:19:22] He moves all of the things and con
[1:19:25] natures of the world that's creeped into
[1:19:27] the church as he's a true servant of
[1:19:29] God. He takes the word and chops it from
[1:19:32] one side to the other until he cut
[1:19:35] everything out.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; And then when he had got lost his
[1:19:42] backslidden brothers and the children
[1:19:45] and he was bringing them back to
[1:19:48] reconciliation.
[1:19:49] Amen.
[1:19:51] Notice this great king comes down from
[1:19:56] Jerusalem.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; And then
[1:20:02] Melzdc.
[1:20:05] What type of man was that? He was called
[1:20:09] the king of Salem, which any scholar
[1:20:13] knows that Salem was Jerusalem.
[1:20:17] It was called Salem before it was called
[1:20:20] Jerusalem.
[1:20:22] Who was this man that met that thought
[1:20:25] he'd taken the right step?
[1:20:28] WHO WAS this person that stood by him?
[1:20:33] Watch who he is. He is the king of
[1:20:36] Jerusalem
[1:20:38] and he's also the king of peace.
[1:20:44] Third verse, without fathers,
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; without mothers, without descent,
[1:20:51] without beginning of days or without
[1:20:54] ending of life.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Who was this great prince?
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; THAT NAME AFTER THE BATTLE was over.
[1:21:06] Let's turn over to Genesis the 14th
[1:21:09] verse, the 14th chapter and the 18th
[1:21:12] verse. And Melazdc, king of Salem,
[1:21:17] brought forth bread and wine.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Blessed and said, blessed be THE MOST
[1:21:25] HIGH GOD, PRESERVER OF HEAVENS AND
[1:21:27] EARTH. AMEN,
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; and blessed be Abraham who is his
[1:21:31] servant.
[1:21:33] After the battle was over,
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; after the victory was won,
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; after the clearance had been made,
[1:21:42] Melzdc
[1:21:44] left Abraham on the plane and brought
[1:21:47] bread and wine
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; and turned it to him. and who no other
[1:21:56] was back than the one that made Abraham
[1:21:59] about a year later sat under the tree
[1:22:02] and talked to him. And this same bell
[1:22:06] said, "I will take no more of the fruit
[1:22:09] of the vine until I fake it and do with
[1:22:13] you in my father's kingdom after."
[1:22:19] When the victory is won, then we'll take
[1:22:23] it a new in his
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. When the last battle is
[1:22:29] fought, when the last door have killed
[1:22:32] the last evil of the world and the great
[1:22:35] church of the living God,
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Christ will meet them in THE AIR WITH
[1:22:43] THE fire
[1:22:49] and for eternity in the presence of the
[1:22:53] father.
[1:22:54] Oh weary pilgrim tonight.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Come back to the father's house.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Come up out of Sodom.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; You've been reconciled by the blood
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; and this glorious memorial night when
[1:23:11] our great bel
[1:23:14] who had no beginning of days or ending
[1:23:16] of life but is a king and a prince
[1:23:20] FOREVER AND FOREVER.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:24] The Holy Spirit here tonight is a ruing
[1:23:28] to the uneem.
[1:23:30] Now, if you're without Christ tonight
[1:23:33] and when the battle is over, if you want
[1:23:36] to meet him in peace and take the
[1:23:38] communion with him and you promise that
[1:23:41] you love him and separate yourself from
[1:23:46] the things of the world,
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; take the OLD RUGGED GOSPEL IN THE OLD
[1:23:52] FASHIONED RUGGED way
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; and drink the cup of the
[1:23:58] persecution of the world
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; and drinking the bitter drugs of
[1:24:03] persecution of the world. IT'S GIVEN TO
[1:24:06] US BY THE BIBLE THAT WE'LL drink the
[1:24:08] sweet wines of heaven someday when we
[1:24:11] need a peace on earth between the
[1:24:13] heavens and earth when it comes to serve
[1:24:15] the communion.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; May our hearts think this over.
[1:24:22] I'll drink it and do with you in my
[1:24:25] father's kingdom.
[1:24:28] If he should come before another Easter
[1:24:30] comes,
[1:24:32] if you should die before another Easter
[1:24:34] comes, it will not prevent that great
[1:24:37] event.
[1:24:39] Hallelujah.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; For I say by the word of the Lord that
[1:24:42] those which are sleeping in Christ shall
[1:24:46] come forth first,
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; and we which are alive and remain shall
[1:24:51] be caught up with them together in the
[1:24:53] air to meet the Lord. Amen.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; And the great Melchzdc of heaven, the
[1:24:59] king of not the natural Jerusalem, but
[1:25:02] the king OF THE HEAVENLY JERUSALEM, the
[1:25:05] new Jerusalem will meet us and will be
[1:25:09] served again. The wine and the bread.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Tonight, we are to take the symbols of
[1:25:16] this. We are to do it till we find him
[1:25:19] coming again. May we be found faithful
[1:25:22] as we bow our heads just a moment for a
[1:25:25] word of prayer.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Everyone just as quiet as possible
[1:25:34] in this most solemn holy moment.
[1:25:39] How easy is it to let these things slip?
[1:25:44] The Bible said, "Lest we should let
[1:25:48] those things slip and neglect such a
[1:25:51] great salvation."
[1:25:54] It's so easy to forget it. We do not
[1:25:58] come to church to be seen. We do not
[1:26:01] come to hear good singing or a good
[1:26:04] sermon. We come to church to worship,
[1:26:08] to worship God. And each one of us are
[1:26:12] mortal beings that's got a soul that's
[1:26:15] got to meet him someday.
[1:26:19] And on the eve of this great crucifixion
[1:26:22] day
[1:26:24] in commemoration of his going away
[1:26:29] tonight. If you're not a Christian, have
[1:26:32] never accepted Christ in your life as
[1:26:35] savior.
[1:26:36] Are you convinced enough by the
[1:26:39] preaching of the word? And is the Holy
[1:26:42] Spirit standing near you to say you're
[1:26:44] guilty?
[1:26:47] Now turn and start the other way.
[1:26:52] Would you declare the same by raising up
[1:26:54] your hands, saying, "Brother Brandon,
[1:26:56] pray for me. I now solicit your prayers
[1:26:59] that God will be merciful to me."
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Would you raise your hand while we're
[1:27:04] waiting? God bless you sir. Someone
[1:27:08] else. God bless you. God bless you sir.
[1:27:11] God bless you little one. God bless you
[1:27:14] with someone. God bless you lady. You
[1:27:17] say brother Brandham does that mean
[1:27:19] anything to raise my hand? What's the
[1:27:21] difference between death and life?
[1:27:26] What's any greater than life?
[1:27:29] You love. You look at nature. You love
[1:27:32] it. You hate to go away from it.
[1:27:36] just across the street there when my
[1:27:38] brother's wife was dying one morning
[1:27:40] many years ago when poor little Ruth
[1:27:43] raised up her head and there's a robin
[1:27:46] sitting in a cherry tree and she wanted
[1:27:47] to see it one more time
[1:27:51] how she loved nature
[1:27:54] but someday when Jesus comes she'll hear
[1:27:58] the birds of eternity singing
[1:28:02] the flowers in marvel will be growing.
[1:28:07] There will be no sickness, sorrow or
[1:28:09] death because she made her peace with
[1:28:12] God and accepted the great Christ who
[1:28:16] died for her with this blessed assurance
[1:28:20] who cannot fail. The blessed word of God
[1:28:24] who cannot lie promised eternal life to
[1:28:27] those who believe. When you raise your
[1:28:30] hand, it shows that a spirit inside of
[1:28:33] you
[1:28:35] has made a decision. God bless you,
[1:28:37] ladies.
[1:28:40] Something in you,
[1:28:43] a a spirit by nature, your arms is made
[1:28:46] to hang down.
[1:28:49] And when you raise your hand, you defy
[1:28:52] the very laws of gravitation.
[1:28:54] It has to be supernatural.
[1:28:58] It's a it's against science scientific
[1:29:04] against all scientific things for you to
[1:29:07] break the laws of gravitation.
[1:29:10] It cannot be done unless there is
[1:29:13] something supernatural.
[1:29:15] Your arms would continually hang down.
[1:29:18] But if in your heart
[1:29:21] you believe the gospel story
[1:29:25] and have made your decision this night
[1:29:29] that you're through with sin and on this
[1:29:32] beautiful approach to Calvary when
[1:29:36] tomorrow at 3:00 in commemoration we
[1:29:40] celebrate the day when Jesus died for
[1:29:44] your salvation.
[1:29:47] and you think enough of it and the Holy
[1:29:50] Spirit has come and knocked at your
[1:29:52] heart and you've now accepted it. You
[1:29:54] just something in your heart says raise
[1:29:56] your hand. That shows to the people and
[1:29:59] to God that you believe it and accept
[1:30:02] it. God bless you. All you little
[1:30:05] children, three or four of them here on
[1:30:06] the altar, little boys and girls about
[1:30:09] 18 years old, they all put up their
[1:30:11] hands at one time.
[1:30:14] Jesus said, "Suffer, little children, to
[1:30:17] come unto me. Forbid them not, for such
[1:30:19] is the kingdom." Is there another before
[1:30:21] we pray? God bless you, lady. That's a
[1:30:25] real You might have done many things,
[1:30:27] lady, in life that was real. I believe
[1:30:30] you to be an honest woman. And remember,
[1:30:34] you could not have put up your hand,
[1:30:35] sister dear, unless something inside
[1:30:38] you, something way down in you said, "Do
[1:30:41] that."
[1:30:42] It may seem just a little foolish now to
[1:30:44] the carnal mind, but brother, on that
[1:30:47] day when the doctor walks away from the
[1:30:49] door and says, "It's finished." When he
[1:30:51] goes away from that wreck and pulls that
[1:30:53] little body of yours out, the bloods are
[1:30:56] going away and your heart's a pain.
[1:30:58] There's no need of fooling with them.
[1:31:00] They're gone. Oh my. and frantically and
[1:31:05] wild you'll kind of repent and God said
[1:31:07] in your calamities I can only laugh.
[1:31:11] But while you're staying in your right
[1:31:14] mind,
[1:31:16] Father, as we bring this message to the
[1:31:20] close and a harvest of about 15 people
[1:31:23] raising their hand that's been sinners
[1:31:26] all their lives and now by grace you
[1:31:31] have spoke to them. turn them right
[1:31:33] around
[1:31:35] and let them face Calvary. And hearing
[1:31:38] them words come from the lips of the Son
[1:31:41] of God, "Father, forgive them. They
[1:31:44] didn't know what they were doing, but
[1:31:47] tonight they have received the gospel."
[1:31:51] We hear him say a few days prior of
[1:31:54] this, "He that heareth my words and
[1:31:57] believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:31:59] everlasting life, and shall not come
[1:32:01] into the judgment, but pass from death
[1:32:04] to life.
[1:32:06] We present them to thee tonight, Lord,
[1:32:08] as thy children. May thy eternal
[1:32:12] blessings rest upon them in Christ's
[1:32:14] name we pray. May they come Sunday
[1:32:17] morning packing their clothes saying, "I
[1:32:21] desire to make a public confession to
[1:32:24] this world that I am a believer. I am
[1:32:27] now desiring to be baptized in the name
[1:32:30] of the Lord Jesus Christ, calling upon
[1:32:33] him to fill me with the Holy Spirit and
[1:32:36] care for me through life. Bless these
[1:32:38] young women, these young men, the age,
[1:32:41] the little children and all.
[1:32:43] Care for them, Father. They are yours
[1:32:46] and in the fruits of this message
[1:32:48] tonight, I present them to you as the
[1:32:51] attributes
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; and they are in your hand as love gifts
[1:32:55] from God the Father. I pray that you
[1:32:58] will care for them through life. In
[1:33:00] Jesus name I pray. Amen.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:33:16] We are very happy to have you here
[1:33:18] tonight and we are glad that you come.
[1:33:21] And tomorrow night our message is
[1:33:23] tomorrow night on the perfection of the
[1:33:27] believer. And now come bring someone
[1:33:30] with you if your own church doesn't have
[1:33:33] services. And now we are going to have
[1:33:35] the communion. Maybe some of you I'm
[1:33:37] just uh a little teeny bit late a few
[1:33:41] minutes and we're going to dismiss those
[1:33:43] who have to go and those who wish to
[1:33:46] stay to take the communion and
[1:33:48] footwashing with us. We believe and
[1:33:51] absolutely doing every article that
[1:33:54] Jesus left for us to do. And if he shall
[1:33:57] come in my generation and will let me
[1:34:00] stay in my right mind and keep his love
[1:34:03] in my heart, I'll be trying my best to
[1:34:06] do every one of them and be found
[1:34:07] faithful at the post. God bless you.
[1:34:10] Now,
[1:34:14] thank the Lord for the word tonight.
[1:34:16] Amen. Let's sing that song, Longing,
[1:34:20] Longing for Jesus. As we prepare to go
[1:34:23] to
[1:34:24] the word and the brothers bring the
[1:34:26] elements, you'd stand with me and turn
[1:34:29] in Corinthians 11. Let's sing that. All
[1:34:35] glory
[1:34:41] Jesus.
[1:34:46] I am
[1:34:48] looking
[1:34:50] in my heart
[1:34:53] for
[1:34:55] you.
[1:34:59] us to
[1:35:01] be near
[1:35:04] him.
[1:35:11] Amen. Amen.
[1:35:13] I am
[1:35:16] longing.
[1:35:23] Yeah. Amen. Is that your desire?
[1:35:26] Amen.
[1:35:29] In moments
[1:35:31] like these,
[1:35:35] I sing out
[1:35:37] a song.
[1:35:40] Sing out
[1:35:43] a love song to Jesus.
[1:35:50] In moments
[1:35:53] like these,
[1:35:56] I lift up
[1:35:58] my hands.
[1:36:01] I lift
[1:36:04] up my hands to the Lord
[1:36:09] with all your heart sing
[1:36:13] I
[1:36:15] love
[1:36:17] you Lord
[1:36:21] singing
[1:36:23] I
[1:36:26] love
[1:36:28] you Lord Lord,
[1:36:32] sing
[1:36:34] of
[1:36:39] you,
[1:36:42] oh Lord, oh
[1:36:45] I
[1:36:47] love
[1:36:49] love love you.
[1:36:52] 1 Corinthians 11 verse 23. For I have
[1:36:56] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:36:58] delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus
[1:37:01] the same night in which he was betrayed,
[1:37:03] took bread, and when he had given
[1:37:06] thanks, he broke it and said, "Take,
[1:37:08] eat. This is my body which is broken for
[1:37:11] you. This do in remembrance of me."
[1:37:14] After the same manner also he took the
[1:37:16] cup when he had sucked, saying, "This
[1:37:19] cup is the new testament in my blood.
[1:37:21] This do ye as oft as you drink it in
[1:37:24] remembrance of me. For as often as you
[1:37:26] eat this bread and drink this cup, you
[1:37:29] do show the Lord's death till he come.
[1:37:32] Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:37:34] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:37:35] unworthily
[1:37:36] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:37:38] the Lord. But let a man examine himself,
[1:37:42] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:37:44] drink of that cup. For he that eateth
[1:37:46] and drinkketh unworthily eateth and
[1:37:49] drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not
[1:37:52] discerning the Lord's body. For this
[1:37:54] cause many are weak and sickly among
[1:37:57] you. Many sleep. For if we would judge
[1:38:00] ourselves, we should not be judged. But
[1:38:03] when we are judged, we are chasen of the
[1:38:05] Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:38:07] with the world. Wherefore my brethren,
[1:38:10] when you come together to eat, tarry one
[1:38:13] for another. And if any any man hunger,
[1:38:16] let him eat at home that you come not
[1:38:18] together unto condemnation, and the rest
[1:38:21] will I set in order when I come. And
[1:38:25] brother Bannam says that Terry means to
[1:38:27] wait. And so just for a few moments of
[1:38:31] silent prayer, you pray for me, I'll
[1:38:34] pray for you, and pray for the one next
[1:38:37] to you, in front of you, behind you as
[1:38:40] we um uh pray and wait.
[1:39:16] Heavenly Father, in my hands I hold the
[1:39:18] bread that was made for this service,
[1:39:21] Lord. It's a type of your body that was
[1:39:24] shed. It represents your body. It is not
[1:39:28] your literal body, Lord, as we heard
[1:39:30] tonight, but as we partake of it, Lord
[1:39:33] Jesus, in commemoration, Father, that
[1:39:37] shows that we are actually under the
[1:39:39] blood. And we thank you. May you bless
[1:39:42] it for this service. We pray in Jesus'
[1:39:45] name. Amen.
[1:39:52] Heavenly Father, in my hands I hold the
[1:39:55] cup of the New Testament of your blood.
[1:39:58] Your blood that was shed for us at
[1:40:00] Calvary.
[1:40:01] Lord, we ask that you would bless it.
[1:40:04] Bless the cup and those that partake of
[1:40:07] it. May they receive the blessings
[1:40:10] that comes with this service, Lord.
[1:40:14] Lord, we know this is a fellowship as
[1:40:16] the prophet taught us. It's also
[1:40:19] healing, Lord.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; And we claim that we need a touch in our
[1:40:24] bodies, Lord. We need a touch in our
[1:40:27] spirit, Lord. Heal us, we pray.
[1:40:30] Just not just naturally, Lord, but
[1:40:33] physically and spiritually, Lord, bless
[1:40:36] us, we pray, sanctify this cup, we ask
[1:40:39] in Jesus' name. God bless you. You may
[1:40:42] be seated. Follow the directions. Usher
[1:44:06] Heat. Heat.
[1:45:47] Heat. Heat.
[1:47:42] Heat. Heat.
[1:48:38] Heat. Heat.
[1:50:18] this portion of bread that remains for
[1:50:20] we burnt with fire before the rising of
[1:50:22] the sun. Let us stand and take our
[1:50:24] Bibles and turn to St. John
[1:50:29] chapter 13.
[1:50:46] supper being ended, the devil having now
[1:50:49] put into the heart of Judas Scariot,
[1:50:51] Simon's son, to betray him. Verse three,
[1:50:55] Jesus knowing that the Father had given
[1:50:57] all things into his hands and that he
[1:50:59] was come from God. He went to God. He
[1:51:02] rise from supper. He laid aside his
[1:51:05] garments. He took a towel and girded
[1:51:07] himself. After that, he poured water
[1:51:09] into a basin and began to wash the
[1:51:12] disciples feet and to wipe them with the
[1:51:14] towel wherewith he girded. He was
[1:51:16] girded. Then cometh he to Simon Peter.
[1:51:20] And Peter saith unto him,"Lord, dust
[1:51:22] thou wash my feet?" Jesus answered and
[1:51:24] said unto him, "What I do, thou knowest
[1:51:27] not now, but thou shalt know hereafter."
[1:51:30] Peter said unto him, "Thou shalt never
[1:51:33] wash my feet." Jesus answered him, "If I
[1:51:37] wash thee not, thou has no part with
[1:51:39] me." Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord,
[1:51:42] not my feet only, but also my hands and
[1:51:45] my head. Jesus said to him, "He that is
[1:51:49] washed needeth not saved to wash his
[1:51:51] feet, but is clean every wit, and ye are
[1:51:54] clean, but not all."
[1:51:58] We see the importance of foot washing,
[1:52:00] don't we? Verse 11, for he knew who
[1:52:03] should betray him. Therefore said he,
[1:52:06] "Ye are not all clean." So after he had
[1:52:09] washed their feet, had taken his
[1:52:11] garment, and was sat down again, he said
[1:52:13] unto them, "Know ye what I have done to
[1:52:16] you? You call me Master and Lord?" You
[1:52:19] say, "Well, for so I am. By then your
[1:52:21] Lord and Master have washed your feet.
[1:52:24] You also ought to wash one another's
[1:52:26] feet. For I have given you an example,
[1:52:31] that ye should do as I have done to you.
[1:52:34] Verily, verily, I say unto you, the
[1:52:36] servant is not greater than his Lord,
[1:52:40] neither he that is sent greater than he
[1:52:42] that sent him. If you know these things,
[1:52:45] happy are ye if you do them.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, may God add a blessing to the
[1:52:52] reading of his word. Thank you for those
[1:52:54] scriptures. I left my glasses in the
[1:52:56] back, so I really needed that tonight.
[1:52:58] And um just a word of announcement. Next
[1:53:02] week Sunday, Brother Bill Lingard will
[1:53:04] be with us ministering here in the city.
[1:53:07] And so we pray for that. And also
[1:53:11] uh keep one another in prayer. And so we
[1:53:13] want to sing that song.
[1:53:17] Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good
[1:53:19] to me. The brothers will remain in the
[1:53:21] sanctuary. The sisters go over there to
[1:53:24] footwash
[1:53:26] singing, "Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely
[1:53:30] been good to me.
[1:53:33] Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good
[1:53:37] to me.
[1:53:39] Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good
[1:53:43] to me. You have done what this world
[1:53:47] could not do. Save my soul. You save my
[1:53:52] soul. I was lost. Surely been good to
[1:53:56] me. You saved my soul. I was lost.
[1:54:01] Surely being good to me. You have saved
[1:54:04] my soul. I was lost. Surely being good
[1:54:08] to me. You have done what this world
[1:54:12] could not do.
[1:54:15] Fill me. You fill me with the Holy
[1:54:18] Ghost. surely been good to me, Lord. You
[1:54:22] filled me with the Holy Ghost. Surely
[1:54:26] been good to me. You have filled me with
[1:54:30] the Holy Ghost. Surely been good to me.
[1:54:34] You have done what this world could not
[1:54:38] do. Lord, Lord, oh Lord, Lord, Lord,
[1:54:45] surely be good to me.
[1:54:48] Lord,
[1:54:49] oh Lord, surely be good to me. Singing
[1:54:54] Lord,
[1:54:56] oh you surely been good to me. You have
[1:55:00] done what this world could not do.
[1:55:06] Hallelujah. God bless you. You dismiss
[1:55:09] your sisters, your brothers. God bless
[1:55:10] you.
[2:11:57] Amen. I thank the Lord.
[2:12:00] We'll sing a couple songs. Brother
[2:12:03] John, come and close out, I think.
[2:12:06] Create in me a clean heart and
[2:12:10] renew the right spirit in me. Let's
[2:12:12] stand and sing that.
[2:12:15] Create in me
[2:12:18] clean heart,
[2:12:22] oh God,
[2:12:27] and renew the right spirit
[2:12:31] within me.
[2:12:37] Create in me a clean
[2:12:42] heart,
[2:12:45] oh God,
[2:12:50] and renew the right spirit
[2:12:54] within me.
[2:12:59] Ooh,
[2:13:00] and cast me not away
[2:13:05] from thy presence,
[2:13:09] oh Lord.
[2:13:13] Take
[2:13:15] the Holy Spirit from me,
[2:13:21] Lord.
[2:13:24] Restore
[2:13:26] unto me
[2:13:29] all of the joy
[2:13:31] thy salvation
[2:13:36] and renew the rock spirit within me.
[2:13:44] Oh, created me. Created me a clean
[2:13:51] heart.
[2:13:54] Oh God,
[2:13:59] and renew the right spirit.
[2:14:05] Amen.
[2:14:08] Oh, create
[2:14:11] me a clean
[2:14:14] heart,
[2:14:17] oh God,
[2:14:22] and renew the right spirit
[2:14:26] within me.
[2:14:30] Cast me not away,
[2:14:32] and cast me not away
[2:14:37] from thy presence,
[2:14:41] oh Lord,
[2:14:44] and take not thy holy spirit from me.
[2:14:51] From me.
[2:14:55] Restore.
[2:14:57] Hallelujah.
[2:15:00] All of the joy
[2:15:02] thy salvation
[2:15:07] and renew the right spirit
[2:15:11] within
[2:15:18] me not away
[2:15:23] from thy presence,
[2:15:26] oh Lord.
[2:15:29] Take not thy holy spirit from me.
[2:15:40] Restore
[2:15:42] unto me
[2:15:45] the joy of thy salvation.
[2:15:52] and renew a right spirit
[2:15:56] within me.
[2:16:01] There's another song. Sister Sharon, do
[2:16:03] you know that song? Unto thee, O Lord.
[2:16:06] Unto thee, O Lord,
[2:16:10] do I lift up my soul.
[2:16:15] Unto thee, oh Lord.
[2:16:20] Do I lift up my soul,
[2:16:26] oh my God,
[2:16:30] I trust in thee.
[2:16:34] Oh, let me not be ashamed. Let on my
[2:16:38] enemies triumph over me. Let on that
[2:16:43] weight.
[2:16:44] Yay, let on that way.
[2:16:50] Only thee be ashamed.
[2:16:54] Yeah, they're none thy way.
[2:16:59] Only the be ashamed.
[2:17:05] Oh my God,
[2:17:09] I trust in thee.
[2:17:14] Oh, let me not be ashamed. Let all my
[2:17:17] enemies sham
[2:17:19] over thee.
[2:17:23] Yeah, let none that way.
[2:17:29] On thee be ashamed.
[2:17:33] Yeah, let none that way.
[2:17:38] On thee be ashamed.
[2:17:44] Oh my God,
[2:17:48] I trust in thee.
[2:17:53] Let me not be ashamed. Let not my eneies
[2:17:57] triumph over thee. Is there another
[2:18:00] verse that we sing with this? Show me
[2:18:03] thy ways.
[2:18:07] Thy ways, oh Lord.
[2:18:12] Show me thy ways.
[2:18:17] Thy ways, oh Lord,
[2:18:23] oh my God,
[2:18:27] I trust in thee.
[2:18:32] Let me not be ashamed. Let not my
[2:18:35] enemies triumph over me. Let's sing that
[2:18:39] first verse one more time. Unto thee.
[2:18:42] Under thee, oh Lord,
[2:18:46] do I lift up my soul.
[2:18:51] Under thee, oh Lord,
[2:18:56] do I lift up my soul.
[2:19:01] Oh my God,
[2:19:05] I trust in thee.
[2:19:10] Let me not be ashamed that all my eneies
[2:19:14] triumph over thee.
[2:19:21] Let's sing that song. There's never been
[2:19:22] a day like this day. Brother Chuck, if
[2:19:24] you come and dismiss us tonight. There
[2:19:27] has never
[2:19:29] been a day
[2:19:32] like this day
[2:19:35] to me.
[2:19:38] There has never
[2:19:40] been a day
[2:19:43] like this day
[2:19:46] I see.
