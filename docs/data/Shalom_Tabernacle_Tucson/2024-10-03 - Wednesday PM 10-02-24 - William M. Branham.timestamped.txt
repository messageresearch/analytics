[22:41] ever was had a foot washing let's see
[22:43] your hands oh my look at the Baptist
[22:46] that's in here this

[22:51] Baptist and uh thing old and I used to

[23:05] blessings in one if it's a blessing you
[23:08] wash one foot yard try both one night
[23:11] the foot wash
[23:14] bapti well it depends on what kind of
[23:16] service we have this
[23:19] morning we don't know just what it will
[23:22] be tonight because we of um how the
[23:26] service is this morning uh kind tired we
[23:29] just come from Mexico where I had one of
[23:32] the one most marvelous meetings we've
[23:35] ever had and I know many of you are
[23:38] interested to hear of it so uh we was
[23:42] down there for three nights had three
[23:44] nights of service and the our Blessed
[23:48] Redeemer certainly did do the exceeding
[23:50] abundantly down there the last night we
[23:53] had 20,000 people that have never come
[23:57] to Christ in any manner receive Jesus as
[23:59] personal savior at one time 20,000 at
[24:03] one time a resurrection of a little baby
[24:05] that died in its mother's arms while
[24:07] standing on the ground and the doctor
[24:10] had said the day before it was going to
[24:12] die and she had brought it to the
[24:13] meeting to be prayed bar and the people
[24:15] were standing like they are around here
[24:18] you think it's pretty bad here for we
[24:19] Americans to have to stand hour but they
[24:22] would come in sometimes at 6:00 at
[24:24] morning and stand till 11: that night
[24:27] and they were so jammed together till
[24:29] they estimate how much ground we had for
[24:31] them to stand on and they were standing
[24:32] six people every 3 Square fet six people
[24:36] just standing jammed together leaning
[24:38] against each other I said it reminded me
[24:40] of sheep you know when the heat of the
[24:43] day is on the sheep all get together and
[24:47] they stand against another and they make
[24:49] shade for each other and they support
[24:51] each other so that's the way the Sheep
[24:54] of God should do kind of Stand Together
[24:56] F places and support one another with
[24:59] our faith now every person and your own
[25:03] way of praying whichever way you pray at
[25:05] your church you pray this morning and we
[25:09] are going to read some of God's word and
[25:11] because of those who are standing as we
[25:13] come up they just turning the people
[25:15] away and away and said they've been
[25:17] turning away for quite a long time so
[25:20] now we're going to be real quick and
[25:23] speak on the word so you can have a
[25:25] ground for Faith and then after that
[25:28] then we're going to pray for the sick uh
[25:31] the way the Lord will I've been wanting
[25:33] to have our first opening service to
[25:37] take the people away the vision it just
[25:39] showed but I don't know where I'm going
[25:40] to be able to do that or not the rooms
[25:42] are Jam full in there to get them away
[25:45] from the
[25:47] public trust that you'll try to hold on
[25:50] just for a little while and pray now the
[25:53] first thing I believe that
[25:56] all Doctrine
[25:58] must come from God's Eternal blessed
[26:02] word amen for faith cannot rest upon the
[26:06] shifting SS of Theology of man it must
[26:10] be based upon the unmovable Rock of
[26:13] God's word therefore a person can rest
[26:17] assure that if God has said it God will
[26:21] perform what he
[26:23] said in the message this morning we were
[26:25] talking on how that God
[26:28] before perhaps 10,000 years before
[26:32] there's ever a World Jesus Christ was
[26:35] slain before the foundation of the world
[26:39] God spoke it and that said it as long as
[26:42] God speaks it that makes it right and in
[26:45] God's mind when he speaks the word it's
[26:48] already confirmed in heaven that's how
[26:51] perfect it is up there so how much ought
[26:54] we martal who have been redeemed by his
[26:56] grace trust his his
[26:59] word if his word said so that
[27:03] settled now first the word the Bible
[27:06] said in the beginning was the word and
[27:08] the Word was with God and the Word was
[27:12] God now before it could be a word it had
[27:15] to be a thought because a word is a
[27:18] thought
[27:20] expressed and God when he seen that the
[27:23] enemy of this world had was going to do
[27:27] what he did
[27:29] God thought how he would stand the great
[27:33] Plan of
[27:35] Redemption and when he thought it then
[27:38] he spoke it and it was as good as done
[27:41] right then and thousands of years later
[27:44] came the Lord Jesus Christ and died for
[27:47] sins and rose again some 1900 years ago
[27:51] this morning for our justification
[27:52] setting up his right hand now as a high
[27:55] priest making intercession Upon Our
[27:57] confession it's already finished and any
[28:00] word that comes out of God's Bible you
[28:03] can rest your soul
[28:06] upon that's the reason down in Mexico
[28:10] the most of the people down there are
[28:12] Catholic and being interviewed by
[28:15] Catholic man he said brother brandom do
[28:19] you believe that that our Saints can
[28:22] perform Miracles I said if they're
[28:25] living not dead and he said well he said
[28:28] um well you I said I he said what church
[28:32] are you with I said the Church of the
[28:34] Lord Jesus and he said what denomination
[28:38] is it now I said it isn't a denomination
[28:40] it's the body of Christ by one Spirit we
[28:43] all come together to believe and in
[28:46] there no matter what the man thinks it's
[28:50] his personal faith in Christ he said of
[28:53] course that Bible was the ancient
[28:55] history of the Catholic Church now I
[28:58] said well I'm going to give you the
[28:59] benefit of the doubt I have I read many
[29:02] histories and I don't see where the
[29:04] Catholic church ever come into existence
[29:06] for 300 years and something after death
[29:08] the last Apostle but however I I'll give
[29:11] you the benefit of the doubt and say it
[29:12] well then you can call me a Catholic of
[29:15] the old type because I believe the Bible
[29:19] that's right all right and I believe
[29:22] that every word can never be changed if
[29:26] God has once spoken in it forever the
[29:28] truth see see you and I keep learning
[29:31] more wisdom you know more now than you
[29:35] did a few years ago a little girl
[29:37] sitting here uh she's just a child her
[29:41] parents has to lead her after a while
[29:43] she'll grow up and probably in her day
[29:45] she progresses she might be smarter than
[29:47] her mother is now see because she keeps
[29:49] progressing but God is infant he can't
[29:52] change he has he he was he was perfect
[29:55] to begin with he'll be the same at the
[29:57] end he he can't change so whatever his
[30:01] attitude was towards anything in the
[30:04] Bible it has to be the same now or he
[30:06] did wrong the way he acted then see so
[30:09] he's got this never change so before we
[30:12] open up his word let us speak to the one
[30:15] who wrote it the Lord Jesus while we bow
[30:17] our heads our heavenly
[30:20] father today is one of the greatest days
[30:24] of the on the history of the Christian
[30:28] calendar it's the day of the
[30:32] Resurrection we pray heavenly father
[30:34] that he who is alive today and alive
[30:38] forever more will visit with us in these
[30:40] next few moments of speaking and praying
[30:44] for those poor people who are sick and
[30:47] needy
[30:48] today I humbly ask that you forgive us
[30:51] all of our sins and
[30:54] trespasses we do wrong we realize that
[30:58] because we're living in a wrong world
[31:01] with wrong
[31:02] motiv wrong Spirits wrong
[31:06] emotions but father thou knowest all
[31:09] these things so we are so thankful that
[31:11] we have Jesus who sets it right hand of
[31:14] the Majesty to make intercessions Upon
[31:17] Our confession that we are wrong and he
[31:19] promised to forgive us and we believe it
[31:22] and
[31:23] trusting get Glory out of the service
[31:25] today circumcise every heart to hear the
[31:28] word and the lips who speak it far we
[31:30] ask it in Christ's name
[31:34] Amen in the book of the Ephesians I wish
[31:38] to read these
[31:41] words I just love to read God's word
[31:46] wherefore the book first chapter
[31:48] beginning with the second 15th
[31:53] verse wherefore I also after I heard of
[31:57] your Fai in the Lord Jesus and love with
[32:01] all the saints cease not to give thanks
[32:04] for you making mention of you in my
[32:08] prayer that the god of our Lord Jesus
[32:12] Christ the father of Glory may give unto
[32:14] you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation
[32:17] in the knowledge of him the eyes of your
[32:21] understanding being enlightened that you
[32:24] may know what is the hope of the calling
[32:27] and what is the riches of the glory of
[32:31] the inheritance of the
[32:33] Saints and what is the exceeding
[32:36] greatness of his power to us word who
[32:39] believe according to the working of his
[32:42] mighty power which he has wrought in
[32:45] Christ when he raised him from the dead
[32:49] and set him at his own right hand in the
[32:53] Heavenly
[32:54] places far above all all principalities
[32:59] and powers and might dominion and every
[33:03] name not only in this world but also in
[33:07] that which is to
[33:09] come and has put all things under his
[33:12] feet and given to
[33:16] be the head over all things to the
[33:19] church which is his body the fullness of
[33:23] him that
[33:24] filth all in all
[33:28] and then over in the gospels of St Mark
[33:34] or Luke rather beginning about the
[33:38] [Music]
[33:39] 20 5th
[33:41] verse then he said unto them oh fools
[33:46] and slow of heart to believe all things
[33:48] the prophets have
[33:51] spoken ought not Christ to have suffered
[33:54] these things and to enter into his glory
[33:58] and beginning at Moses and all the
[34:01] prophets he expounded unto them all the
[34:04] scriptures and the things concerning
[34:07] himself and they drew not unto the
[34:09] village where they went and he made as
[34:13] though he would have gone
[34:16] farther but they constrained him saying
[34:20] abide with us for it is towards evening
[34:24] and the day is far spent and he went in
[34:27] and carry with them and it came to pass
[34:30] as he sat at meat with them he took
[34:33] bread and blessed it and break it and
[34:35] gave it to them and their eyes were open
[34:41] and they knew him and he vanished out of
[34:44] their sight may the Lord add His
[34:47] blessings to his
[34:49] word enough scripture has been read till
[34:52] it would take us weeks and months to
[34:55] even halfway go to the context of this
[34:59] text but my subject this morning our
[35:03] text is a mighty
[35:06] conqueror and now we begin where we left
[35:10] off of the Resurrection where it proved
[35:14] what he was there's many mens who can
[35:17] make statements there's been many
[35:19] philosophers in the world Buddha muhamed
[35:22] confucious many other great philosophers
[35:25] they've all made statements that they
[35:27] were great people but death settled the
[35:30] question forever with them but never has
[35:34] there been a man outside of Christ who
[35:36] said I have power to lay my life down
[35:38] and to take it up again and could prove
[35:41] it that's the one beautiful thought of
[35:45] Christianity even today that as we speak
[35:48] of the Gospel we do not have to take a
[35:51] year say our historical thing about it
[35:54] because it can be proven right here this
[35:57] morning that Jesus Christ lives and
[36:00] Reigns and is raised from the dead and
[36:02] alive forever more after 2,000 years
[36:05] he's just as present as he was when he
[36:08] was walking in Galilee with his
[36:10] disciples doing the same thing
[36:12] performing the same Miracles showing the
[36:14] same Mercy preaching the same
[36:17] gospel he is not dead but alive forever
[36:21] more what happy heart that ought to make
[36:24] Christian and be today to know that it's
[36:27] not some purist philosophy that we're
[36:30] understanding but it is the power of the
[36:33] resurrection of the Lord Jesus and as
[36:36] the great St Paul said in his days being
[36:39] the only educated one among the
[36:41] disciples he said I didn't come to you
[36:44] with the Excellency of word or with the
[36:46] speech of man that your faith would be
[36:49] trusting in such things but said I come
[36:52] to you with the power and demonstrations
[36:55] of the Holy Ghost that you're your uh
[36:59] Faith would rest in God something to
[37:01] that order how we love that and to know
[37:05] that the same thing that Paul preached
[37:07] in the days after the resurrection of
[37:10] Christ is just the same today and can be
[37:13] proven right here now infallible proofs
[37:17] that Jesus is alive
[37:19] today what a marvelous day it must have
[37:22] been for copius and his friends it was a
[37:25] beautiful Easter morning the first
[37:28] Easter morning brokenhearted as they
[37:31] went along the road the Bible said they
[37:34] were ignorant and unlearn man his
[37:36] apostles were they might not have know
[37:38] much about botney they might not have
[37:40] know much about um uh mathematics or or
[37:45] algebra or anything of that sort of our
[37:48] modern education they might not have
[37:50] know much about that but they know him
[37:53] and that's the main thing to know him is
[37:56] life
[37:58] remember that Christian friend and
[38:00] sinner friend to know Christ is life
[38:04] many people go and they learn a
[38:06] catechism they think that's life many
[38:08] people go and learn the Bible they think
[38:10] that's life many people know the
[38:12] doctrine of their Church they think
[38:14] that's life all those things are good
[38:17] but to know him personally as your
[38:21] personal individual savior that is life
[38:25] and that alone to know him it's good to
[38:27] know your catechism it's good to know
[38:29] your books it's good to know your
[38:31] doctrine of your church but all of that
[38:33] is the sideline but to know him is to
[38:37] know life and to to have life is to know
[38:40] him for he that heareth my words and
[38:42] believeth on him it sent me have
[38:44] everlasting life and shall never come
[38:47] into condemnation but pass from Death
[38:49] unto life Jesus made those statements
[38:52] and those are words that answer there's
[38:54] no more moon and stars those still words
[38:58] will still be in effect and just as
[39:00] powerful as it was the day that he
[39:02] spoken his words cannot fail now if you
[39:06] will listen closely on this Easter
[39:08] morning as they went along they were
[39:10] brokenhearted the man that they had
[39:12] trusted in the one that they thought was
[39:15] going to be the savior of Israel the one
[39:18] that they trusted to be the coming King
[39:21] had been miserably
[39:24] mistreated dead crucified buried
[39:28] and a seal put up his grave with the D
[39:31] of the Roman Garrison they ever touch it
[39:34] or the penalty of all Rome resting in it
[39:37] and if any man would break that seal
[39:40] they'd be put to death
[39:42] immediately Mary his beloved mother
[39:46] though she stood in Steam stripped down
[39:50] naked before the people beaten to a pop
[39:53] bones in his hands parted by the cruel
[39:56] Roman na
[39:58] and all these things and disgrace and
[40:02] heard him screaming for Mercy as he died
[40:05] thinking surely that no man of that
[40:09] caliber could ever die such a death but
[40:12] God works all things together for the
[40:14] good he had to bring in that as I said
[40:17] this morning how would you have
[40:19] confidence in your loved ones ever
[40:21] raising from the dead if if we only had
[40:25] en who was translated if Elijah who went
[40:28] home to heaven in a chariot if we only
[40:31] had them we'd be miserable but this man
[40:35] died he died until the sun know he was
[40:38] dead he died until the moon and stars
[40:41] know he was dead he died until
[40:44] everything in Earth and Heaven knew he
[40:45] was dead that he might die the death of
[40:48] every Mortal that ever lived amen
[40:51] because he died is because we live he
[40:55] died he was mistreated is he came into
[40:58] the World by the way of a barn no place
[41:01] to lay his head when he come on Earth
[41:03] and he was so rejected by the people he
[41:06] didn't have a place to
[41:08] Die the Earth refused him and Heavens
[41:12] couldn't have him because he was coming
[41:14] a sinner not with own sin but with our
[41:17] sins upon him he is bearing the sins of
[41:20] the world upon him so he was rejected in
[41:22] Heavens and the Earth didn't mourn him
[41:24] and they had to lift him up between
[41:25] heavens and earth and let him die
[41:27] outside of heaven and outside of the
[41:29] earth What A
[41:31] Savior how could you turn down such a
[41:34] person as that for modern theology are
[41:38] for the persons of people when you know
[41:40] that you've got to stand in his presence
[41:42] in that day of judgment give account for
[41:44] your
[41:46] life God won't hold you responsible for
[41:48] being a sinner he'll hold you
[41:50] responsible for rejecting the way out
[41:54] you can't help being a sinner you were
[41:55] borned your nature is a sinner
[41:57] but you can help it Jesus made the way
[42:00] for you and there he was after seeing
[42:03] all of that and surely How could a
[42:06] person thought Mary that not knowing a
[42:09] man I was packing water one day from the
[42:12] well and the Holy Ghost spoke to me in a
[42:14] big light and said that Holy thing which
[42:17] will be born to thee shall be called The
[42:19] Son of God how could God ever permit to
[42:22] see his own child hanging there
[42:24] suffering bleeding twisting dying how
[42:27] could it be they were looking at any
[42:29] time for him to turn from the cross pull
[42:31] his hands loose and Triumph over the
[42:34] enemies but they didn't realize if he
[42:37] did that then we'd be left Sinners this
[42:39] morning he had to do that they paid him
[42:42] the greatest compliment them Pharisees
[42:45] did that that crucified him they paid
[42:48] him the greatest compliment he was ever
[42:50] paid one they said he saved others but
[42:53] himself he cannot save they didn't
[42:56] realize that if he saved himself he
[42:58] couldn't save others he had to give
[43:00] himself in order to save others and it
[43:03] was a complimentary to him them not
[43:06] knowing it they were guilty of putting
[43:08] him to death but on Easter morning when
[43:12] God proved above a Shadow of Doubt that
[43:15] something more than a philosopher
[43:17] died something more than a prophet died
[43:21] man today in modern theology tried to
[43:23] make him preaching the Social Gospel as
[43:26] just a philosopher our good man or fine
[43:28] scholar a teacher he was more than that
[43:31] he was God himself made flesh among us
[43:34] he was divine his blood did not come
[43:36] from any mortal man but it come from the
[43:38] creative power of Jehovah God his father
[43:41] and he was divine and he proved it when
[43:44] he broke the seals of death and Rose on
[43:47] the third day here was many of the
[43:49] disciples all dishearten many things
[43:51] that come up in life just like we get
[43:54] ourselves along this journey they were
[43:57] on the road home going over to emus
[44:01] Copus and his companions walking along
[44:04] the road and how little did they know on
[44:07] this beautiful first Easter morning that
[44:10] Jesus Christ was alive and among the
[44:12] people they thought he was dead and as
[44:15] they did then so is it now many people
[44:19] who really love Jesus fail to understand
[44:22] that he's right with us living
[44:24] resurrected here Among Us they teach it
[44:27] as a historical Affair something and it
[44:30] is a history the Bible not only a
[44:33] history but it's a prophet
[44:35] also he's not only dead but he raised
[44:38] again he died truly but he rose again
[44:41] from the dead and there's many fine
[44:43] Christian people this morning who belong
[44:45] to fine churches who doesn't realize
[44:48] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[44:50] today and forever and Alive among us
[44:52] today with the same Powers the same
[44:54] principles the same acts that he did
[44:56] when he was here on Earth littlest
[44:59] people know that and as they journeyed
[45:01] Along on their way down to emus about a
[45:04] Sabbath day Journey about couple of
[45:06] miles I guess on their road down walking
[45:09] along the side of the road they were
[45:11] speaking of his
[45:14] death I want you to
[45:16] notice just when they were speaking
[45:20] oh why could it ever happen how could it
[45:25] ever happen to us we've left your church
[45:27] now to follow this man who we thought
[45:29] surely would be the why we seen him
[45:32] raised Lazarus from the grave after been
[45:34] dead 4 days and how could a man that
[45:38] could raise a dead man from the grave
[45:40] every die but God works in his own way
[45:45] he just just like a seed goes into the
[45:48] ground and dies and brings forth again
[45:51] except the corner of wheat falls into
[45:52] the ground and abides Alone says the
[45:54] Bible so they was wondering but while
[45:57] they were thinking on him he appeared to
[46:01] them and that's the way he usually comes
[46:03] to us when you usually find your
[46:06] greatest blessing you Housewives when
[46:09] the children's all gone to school and
[46:11] you're out by yourself or the dishes or
[46:14] something when you're running the
[46:15] sweeper on the floor or something when
[46:19] do you man when you're sitting eating
[46:21] your lunch maybe by yourself and read
[46:23] the Bible on the side somewhere where
[46:25] you're on your road going home home in
[46:27] this car and you're meditating
[46:29] on if we would let the thoughts of our
[46:32] heart and the meditations of our mind be
[46:34] up on him he would appear often to us
[46:37] amen but the trouble we're thinking
[46:40] about where we're going to make the next
[46:41] dollar and what we're going to do here
[46:43] how this is going to be Jesus said all
[46:45] these things will be taken care of but
[46:47] seek ye first the kingdom of God but as
[46:51] they went along on the road that morning
[46:53] I can just see them oh my the greatest
[46:56] BL what ever happened to them here they
[46:59] was on the road that left the church
[47:02] excommunicated far fing they thought
[47:05] surely he would do something Triumph
[47:07] there at the grave then they were taken
[47:09] from their Church they couldn't return
[47:11] to church anymore and they'd be branded
[47:14] mocked at laughed at made fun of that's
[47:17] the way a man does when he really sells
[47:19] out for Christ he has to cut every
[47:22] Shoreline to walk alone with Christ him
[47:25] alone and men and women of this world
[47:28] who's ever mounted to anything or man
[47:29] and women who has predominantly taken
[47:32] Christ for their Savior and stood alone
[47:35] in their
[47:36] decisions it'll be the same way with
[47:38] every man here this morning or every
[47:40] woman boy or girl if you ever wish to
[47:43] amount anything go farward with God
[47:45] don't trust your church don't trust your
[47:47] preacher your Rabbi your priest but
[47:49] stand alone in Christ Jesus amen the
[47:53] only way you can do it don't if you're
[47:56] here be prayed for her this morning to
[47:58] be healed don't say oh if I can get to
[48:00] the affair to be prayed for her if
[48:02] brother Brandon can pray for me somebody
[48:04] else do this there put your trust alone
[48:07] in him and there know he raised from the
[48:10] dead and made the infallible promise and
[48:13] it can never fail God's word you see it
[48:18] noce and as they went along thinking he
[48:22] appeared to them and walked with them
[48:25] and they didn't rest recogniz him well
[48:28] there's been many times God's walked
[48:31] right with you and you didn't recognize
[48:33] him who kept you from that wreck the
[48:35] other
[48:35] day who did this who who was it out

[1:01:33] once if he can only get you away from
[1:01:35] the crowd the pleasure seeking Crown if

[1:01:40] doubters it says the days of Miracles
[1:01:42] has pass he can ever get you away from
[1:01:44] the people that says there's no more
[1:01:45] feeling of religion the heartfelt
[1:01:48] religion of our fathers bled on the
[1:01:49] battlefield far there's nothing to it if
[1:01:52] he can ever get you alone one time and
[1:01:55] you're all your idea shut out TI
[1:01:59] H he could ever get a group of people
[1:02:03] together like that that would be a
[1:02:05] repeat of
[1:02:07] Pentecost he can ever get a church like
[1:02:10] that there'd be a Revival ever sweet the
[1:02:14] nation get alone with him while he was
[1:02:17] alone the doors shut the world
[1:02:20] outside he picked up some bread and he
[1:02:23] broke it and that's the way he done it
[1:02:28] they knew it had to be him their eyes
[1:02:31] were open they had talked to him all day
[1:02:35] they had Fellowship they heard him
[1:02:37] preach along the road through the
[1:02:39] Journey of the heat of the day but when
[1:02:42] Once
[1:02:43] alone he made himself known to him man
[1:02:46] their eyes come open oh if he could only
[1:02:49] get this group of people at this hour he
[1:02:52] can only get you to a place alone where
[1:02:55] you wouldn't noce say I'm sitting by a
[1:02:57] Methodist this morning and I'm a Baptist
[1:03:00] well you mustn't do that you must shut
[1:03:03] the world out shut the other people out
[1:03:06] you must walk alone with Christ if you
[1:03:09] ever get you alone then your eyes going
[1:03:12] to stay white with him all the
[1:03:14] time then he'll do something here this
[1:03:16] morning the way he used to do it and way
[1:03:20] he does it today for he has to do the
[1:03:22] same thing today that he did then act on
[1:03:25] the same principles or he isn't the same
[1:03:28] yesterday today and forever and he did
[1:03:29] wrong when he acted there if Christ in
[1:03:33] the here it is get it Christ at the
[1:03:37] first
[1:03:39] resurrection and made himself KN to
[1:03:42] these
[1:03:43] Apostles by something that he did when
[1:03:46] he was here on Earth to prove to them
[1:03:48] that he was risen from the dead and it
[1:03:50] was he he's under the same obligations
[1:03:52] to move this morning in this
[1:03:54] Tabernacle the do things here in this
[1:03:57] church this morning that he did when he
[1:03:58] was here on Earth in the same manner
[1:04:00] he's obligated the same way to act when
[1:04:03] the same Christ has
[1:04:04] AR now for another few moments on if
[1:04:09] you'll stand it I want to stay come to
[1:04:12] my other scripture quickly he is risen
[1:04:16] from the
[1:04:17] dead the highest of Heaven became the
[1:04:20] lest through Earth he passed through a
[1:04:22] City Jericho the lowest city in the
[1:04:25] world and the Littest man in the city
[1:04:27] had to look down the scene I tried how
[1:04:31] low did he come did you ever think of it
[1:04:34] he become me that I through Grace might
[1:04:37] become him he become sin knowing no sin
[1:04:41] that I by sin might be righteous in the
[1:04:45] sight of God that's what he did for you
[1:04:48] that's what he did for you sinner friend
[1:04:49] this morning how could you turn him down
[1:04:53] now notice now that was his his Earthly
[1:04:57] work was finished at the resurrection he
[1:05:00] proved everything he said now he's got
[1:05:02] another work to do that the world knows
[1:05:04] little about that's right his next work
[1:05:07] and his Ascension we want to speak on
[1:05:09] that for a moment after he's risen from
[1:05:12] the dead after he's already here on
[1:05:14] Earth and proving himself Alive by
[1:05:17] impower of proofs that he's doing the
[1:05:20] same things that he did when he was here
[1:05:22] in flesh and here he is walking breaking
[1:05:25] bread and eating with
[1:05:27] them oh the same
[1:05:30] Jesus he's proved us now the ascension
[1:05:35] come now the time comes did you ever
[1:05:37] know the Bible said that he ascended up
[1:05:41] on high far above every ever through
[1:05:44] every Heaven this Earth belonged to the
[1:05:47] devil through the fall this Earth was
[1:05:50] given to the devil every Kingdom of this
[1:05:52] world is governed by the devil we hate
[1:05:54] to think that but the Bible says it is
[1:05:57] that that's the reason we have wars and
[1:05:59] shooting and fighting and trouble is
[1:06:02] because the kingdoms of this world is
[1:06:04] the kingdoms of the devil the Bible said
[1:06:07] so and in the great Millennium which is
[1:06:08] to come the Bible said Rejoice all you
[1:06:11] heavens and you holy prophets of the
[1:06:13] Earth for the kingdoms of this Earth
[1:06:15] have become the kingdoms of our Lord and
[1:06:18] and he he shall Rule and Reign forever
[1:06:21] now they will become we'll have a moreal
[1:06:24] war then when he comes no more sickness
[1:06:26] no more trouble now notice when he had
[1:06:29] died there so little spoke of this
[1:06:33] Ascension it's one of the greatest days
[1:06:36] when he ascended up follows all over the
[1:06:39] Earth since the day in the Garden of
[1:06:41] Eden that sin was committed all Heavens
[1:06:44] was shut off from
[1:06:46] mankind Satan is the prince of the power
[1:06:49] of the
[1:06:51] air right why art thou falling from
[1:06:55] heaven old Lucifer no man could see in
[1:06:58] the glory no man could understand
[1:07:01] because the power is just above it
[1:07:03] Heaven means atmosphere above and then
[1:07:07] all these powers are shut off from
[1:07:09] mankind because of
[1:07:12] sin but when he had died and had rose
[1:07:16] again and come up he the Bible said no
[1:07:20] one has ascended up but he that came
[1:07:24] down from
[1:07:26] first when he was in heaven he was a
[1:07:29] lust that went out of God in the
[1:07:31] beginning and he came down on Earth and
[1:07:34] was not to be made an
[1:07:36] angel he came down on Earth and took the
[1:07:39] form of a bondsman not an angel not come
[1:07:43] down in the great Jehovah Glory but he
[1:07:46] came down as a man to redeem man to die
[1:07:51] for man to die for as a man he never
[1:07:56] died as God he died as a man the sin of
[1:07:59] man was up on the son of man and he had
[1:08:02] to become a man in order to pay the
[1:08:05] penalty what did he do the Bible said he
[1:08:07] was made a little lower than the angels
[1:08:10] in order for death that he might take
[1:08:13] away and abolish sin and take away
[1:08:16] sickness from the world now when he came
[1:08:19] down from the highest lust from God he
[1:08:23] came down through angels and came down
[1:08:26] and was made a man and he said I am not
[1:08:29] even a man I am a worm and no man for he
[1:08:33] was despised and rejected there was no
[1:08:36] Beauty we should desire him he was mared
[1:08:39] above every man he was probably a little
[1:08:42] skinny skinly looking fell didn't look
[1:08:45] like a king many times that people judge
[1:08:49] people by the way they dress or by their
[1:08:52] statues man is not judged by how big he
[1:08:55] is how strong his muscles man's judged
[1:08:58] by character and character alone I've
[1:09:01] seen men that weigh 200 lb and have
[1:09:03] answer man about him man is judged by
[1:09:06] character what he is in his heart and
[1:09:10] Christ was not judged by physical
[1:09:12] strength but he was judge by character
[1:09:15] never a man ever Liv like him or never a
[1:09:18] man could ever die like him amen never a
[1:09:20] man could have send up on high like him
[1:09:23] because he was God I am no man he made
[1:09:27] of himself no reputation did you ever
[1:09:30] think the man that made an artificial
[1:09:32] eye made a reputation the man that made
[1:09:34] false teeth made a reputation the man
[1:09:37] that made a wooden arm made a reputation
[1:09:39] for himself but the man who made the
[1:09:41] original eye the man who made the
[1:09:44] original arm made of himself no
[1:09:46] reputation but become a servant of bond
[1:09:49] man un the man who were Sinners that he
[1:09:52] might win them back How could a man in
[1:09:54] his right mind know the gospel truth of
[1:09:57] that and reject the man reject that
[1:09:59] offer God has given to save the man from
[1:10:02] a life of sin how can he do it I just
[1:10:05] can't understand it how that you could
[1:10:08] reject such a one when he's not here to
[1:10:10] make anything that you have to do for
[1:10:12] him but just offering you a way of
[1:10:15] escape from the things that you're going
[1:10:16] to and became that far you when he did
[1:10:21] when he was dying under
[1:10:24] Calvary everything everything had
[1:10:25] rejected him they spit on him his face
[1:10:29] was full of mocky spit they had a rag
[1:10:31] around his eyes and hit him on the head
[1:10:33] and said if you're Prophet tell us who
[1:10:34] hits it a little woman run into the
[1:10:37] midst of him and said what has he done
[1:10:39] but heal your sick and raise your dead
[1:10:41] and done good they smacked her in her
[1:10:43] mouth and said would you listen to that
[1:10:45] woman instead of your priest away was
[1:10:47] such a person and his own Dear Mother
[1:10:51] walking in his bloody Footprints God let
[1:10:53] me walk the same way as he under the
[1:10:56] calvary down in her heart was a
[1:10:58] wondering when she seen her darling
[1:11:00] child Die Young a man 33 years old and
[1:11:03] look like 50 the Bible said of his
[1:11:05] strain is where probably turning gray
[1:11:08] and the grim look on his face word he
[1:11:10] was suffering not so much physically but
[1:11:13] as it was Agony the Bible said that his
[1:11:16] blood and water separated from each
[1:11:18] other and any doctor or anything can
[1:11:20] tell you that knows the chemistry of
[1:11:22] blood that only sorrow will do that
[1:11:25] he never died from a Roman spear neither
[1:11:28] did he die from a nail drobe in his hand
[1:11:30] or his feet but he died of a broken
[1:11:32] heart being
[1:11:34] rejected he came to his own his own
[1:11:36] received him not said brother brand I
[1:11:38] wish I could have stood there that de
[1:11:40] Calvary rather you're standing in a
[1:11:42] better place today you're standing in
[1:11:44] the presence of a resurrected Lord Jesus
[1:11:47] who has proved himself
[1:11:49] Triumph look at him as he stands there
[1:11:53] and after he rose from the dead then we
[1:11:56] notice here that as he went on then
[1:11:58] after he talked with his disciples the
[1:12:01] Bible said he ascended up on high what
[1:12:04] did he do he took the he was here come
[1:12:07] down the low God from heaven when he
[1:12:09] went back he took within the high priest
[1:12:13] being a high priest Anointed with the
[1:12:15] torch light of his own blood when he
[1:12:17] went down all these pow sh that accused
[1:12:20] what L God and man Fellowship it had
[1:12:22] been broke in the Garden of Eden sin the
[1:12:26] things Satan had the domain of this
[1:12:29] Earth was Satan it belonged to the
[1:12:32] Devils but when he come the anointed
[1:12:34] high priest as the high priest Aaron
[1:12:37] went in to the holies of holies behind
[1:12:39] the veil Anointed with the precious
[1:12:40] anointing or walking a certain way
[1:12:42] playing holy holy to the Lord as he
[1:12:45] walked into the type of Christ with the
[1:12:47] blood of the lamb before him and if you
[1:12:49] want any other way he would die Christ
[1:12:51] with his own blood as the high priest
[1:12:55] Anointed with the power of God raised
[1:12:57] from the dead and poured down the
[1:13:00] Dominion of Satan as he broke the
[1:13:02] domains he went to Heavens Beyond
[1:13:05] heavens and he was come to the lowest on
[1:13:08] Earth and was seized up in heaven and
[1:13:10] God set him on a pinnacle until he has

[1:21:11] Chris
[1:21:37] yes man we sure want to do that I know
[1:21:39] my son's over there and didn't think too
[1:21:41] much about a hurricane in North Carolina
[1:21:43] he's just pretty near where that had hit
[1:21:45] a lot of Believers affected there in
[1:21:48] Tennessee brother George uh sister Chris
[1:21:51] um and I've lost everything very
[1:21:55] uh tragic I don't know that Believers
[1:21:57] have lost lives but sure affected a lot
[1:21:59] of people and we just turn to the Lord
[1:22:00] and asked for his help and kindness and
[1:22:03] deliverance for those and all these
[1:22:06] things occurring in the news and these
[1:22:09] tragedies just point us to talk to him
[1:22:12] talk to the master let's do that
[1:22:14] together for one another especially
[1:22:16] these the Believers in the South that
[1:22:18] were affected by the uh hurricane would
[1:22:21] there be another one we should mention
[1:22:28] all right uh let's turn these over to
[1:22:30] the Lord for here the next 15 minutes I
[1:22:32] know brother Chris and company wants to
[1:22:35] clean the church I'm going to apologize
[1:22:37] in advance Wednesdays don't work for me
[1:22:39] so you forgive me and if everybody
[1:22:41] stayed it probably wouldn't work out
[1:22:43] either but if we can get you know a good
[1:22:45] crew to help him we want to do that it's
[1:22:47] delicate it's delicate for me because we
[1:22:51] don't if someone wants to have an
[1:22:52] experience with the Lord we don't want
[1:22:53] to be coming in here too fast too quick
[1:22:57] mumbo jumbo rattling things around going
[1:23:00] Outdoors loudly we want to embrace the
[1:23:03] Holy Spirit and if we have to pray with
[1:23:05] you all night long we want to support
[1:23:07] that Embrace that and so let's let's
[1:23:09] approach that the right way if if at all
[1:23:11] possible I know you know what I mean I
[1:23:13] don't know exactly how to do all that
[1:23:15] right I think we do but just be aware um
[1:23:18] but as we leave to do that work with
[1:23:20] brother Chris and I missed this door I
[1:23:22] think maybe the choir or somebody opens
[1:23:24] it and and prop it let's not prop that
[1:23:27] door anymore please cuz I've missed it a
[1:23:28] couple of times thank the Lord nothing
[1:23:30] has happened so when whoever closes down
[1:23:33] let's make sure that that's the big
[1:23:34] thing there's fans and things they get
[1:23:36] left on try to get all that done but the
[1:23:38] main thing is get these doors closed
[1:23:40] where they can't be propped open in this
[1:23:42] um area of town and then the air
[1:23:45] conditioning just turn it back to what
[1:23:46] it was or what you have at your home
[1:23:48] when you're not there and that will be
[1:23:50] fine there's a remote control back there
[1:23:52] you got to hear it beep beep each one
[1:23:54] and so we'll just do those things
[1:23:56] decently and in order before the Lord is
[1:23:58] that okay man love you appreciate you so
[1:24:02] much let's go to prayer now for the
[1:24:04] needs
