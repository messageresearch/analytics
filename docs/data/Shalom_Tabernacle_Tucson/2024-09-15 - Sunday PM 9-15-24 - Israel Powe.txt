Abigail and Trevor here tonight I sure appreciated that encouragement we had this morning didn't you amen and you know we listen to the prayer requests I thought it was fitting tonight I don't know if brother will was here this morning but uh brother Israel was just speaking of claiming the promises for our healing and you know the most of the prayer requests that get turned in or got a headache backache but not dealing with the most important healing and that's our soul and so to hear a request for somebody that's demon oppressed and let's hold that up before the Lord those are the things that we all could say you know what I've got a little pride in my life I've got this that's B in me and I just James has to confess our faults one to another that we may be healed and I just I'm thankful for the Lord he started the work in me and he promised that he's faithful to complete it and I know that he's going to do that I can look back and see areas in my life where I can I can see where I was holding on to and I had pieces of my heart that I wouldn't give him the key to and wouldn't let him in those rooms but thankful for his grace thankful for conviction this song when brother Israel was preaching this morning I looked at joy and she just smiled at me and afterwards like got a song to sing tonight and we both said the same one at the same time so he came to both of our minds and he's the Healer of the broken pieces he touched my heart and made it new if you can't sing that tonight don't leave here until you can because is the Healer of the broken pieces [Music] amen

tonight I appreciate that very nice so good to see you Trevor clever Trevor and Sister Abigail they had a wonderful wedding that was very nice and we appreciate seeing each of you so let's go right to the word of the Lord tonight in the scriptures two places I want to read second Timothy chapter 1 John 3 1 and 2 uh let's see and when you have that uh you can say Amen second Timothy chapter 1 verse let's take verse number six this is Paul uses that word remember a number of times in that uh in that book there in uh verse number six he says wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my hands for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind amen the spirit of fear um doesn't belong in my mind God has given me a sound mind to believe his word in John 3 verses 1 and two or verses two John 3 the little smaller John's there says beloved I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy Soul Prosper amen we thank God for the reading of the word you know while I have you standing let's take one Old Testament scripture I think I have it's in judges or Numbers chapter 32 yes Numbers chapter 32 quickly right see what that is yes talking about this spirit of fear and how it encourages and discourages verse number six you have that you say Amen Moses said unto the children of GAD and the children of ribbon shall your brethren go to war and shall ye sit here and wherefore discourage you the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the Lord hath given them thus did your fathers when I sent them from Kadesh barnea to see the land for when they were up unto the valley of eshkol and saw the land they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel that they should not go into the land which the Lord hath given them amen let us pray father we thank you for your word tonight ask your blessings to come upon us anoint us with your Holy Spirit Lord we always desire a double portion of your spirit father every day every hour that we're here we want to magnify your name and we need the holy the Holy Ghost to do that and you grant that we pray in Jesus name amen amen amen God bless you you may be seated tonight praise the lord it's always good to see those come out Sunday night Wednesday night and Sunday morning that's our gathering times those are the meeting times we choose to come together I read that scripture in the Old Testament because here is Dan and Gad um they're part of the tribes of Israel and as they're crossing over to the promised land before they get to Jordan before they cross over over and actually take their inheritance they approached Moses with a personal request and they weren't they were not disrespectful they just simply realized that they were Cattlemen and they had lots and lots of cattle and this area of land that they were coming through was very very good for their cattle so they approached Moses and they said Moses um if we have found favor in your sight you got got to read the chapter and see the context that they come in if we have found favor in your sight we won't go with Israel to fight those battles for their inheritance we'll stay here and we'll be satisfied with our inheritance here on this side of Jordan and you know that upset Moses and he warned them and what Moses did is he equated their request on the same level with the spies that came back with an evil report and I want you to catch this because fear and our power to influence is so tremendous our actions and so what Moses said when if you if you stay back and you decide to stay back that's going to discourage the rest of us that are going to fight that's right and you're not even saying anything hurtful you're not saying the land is not there you're not saying it's true you just refrain to go and fight with us to get our property you know there are things that we have to push ourselves through and fight through even though we don't want to because the big picture is this this is in sight and if you know I've got a cancel a ball game or cancel meeting with someone for political Rally or something like that okay fine but but but the things of the Lord are the most important and these are the things we want to keep in our focus at all times and um our children follow us they watch us if we are studying and in the word and taking it in they can see that they can see us when we check out because I can see it you can see when I'm checking out if you're talking to me and we're talking like this and I start picking up my phone and start looking and looking outside and looking over here you're like well brother Israel I'm talking to you well I'm I'm right here but I really don't have your attention my eyes see you your eyes see me and our little ones see that and um this uh this this warning was to them thank the Lord they heeded the warning they say you know what no we don't want to be associated with those that pumped fear into all of Israel and let's let's just look at that just for a moment Israel leaves out of Egypt they come through the land fighting the we all brothers were cousins nephews we're all related we're not mixed with other nations we're all Israelites we have the same burdens have the same trauma troubles and but God has been good to us he delivers us with the mighty hand there is a pillar of fire and every night we can see it out there there is a pillar of cloud he's given us the laws he's given us all these things and here we come to the promised land and these Representatives go over to spy out the land and in spying out the land they come back with a report now we can all go we couldn't all go all of Israel couldn't go it wasn't designed for them to go but the Lord sent influencers he sent represent atives he sent people who had a word to go see with their own eyes and come back and tell us what you see they were reporters but they came and their report was brother Chris fake news it was fake news what made it fake because the word of the Lord told us we can take this land the Lord told us that and in their news and getting the word out there and then one family heard it and the next family heard it and then the next group until the entire congregation decided to go with the news that these gentlemen these men had spoke Joshua Caleb and Moses tried to steer them away they couldn't do it and so this fear is contagious it's dangerous it's detrimental anything that is going to take you away from your faith I would check that in the box of getting it out of your life anything that's hindering your faith if it's bothering you if it's causing a question in your life get it out of your life don't ask me don't ask someone else if it's causing a question in your faith between you and God get it out of your life and maybe later if it's something the Lord will introduce back to you you let him do that but don't don't fight within yourself with something that's hindering your faith so we we stopped here in this message uh this morning on enticing spirits and brother banam says this about the fourth dimension that every disease is from the fourth dimension he says it in paragraph number 40 he says just recently even cancer has been declared a fourth dimension disease that it's in another dimension sure it's demonology every disease is a fourth dimension disease the beginning of it now but now cancer in the body or cancer in the soul the demon can come in either place there's many times many people with good thoughts good people who try many times to rest upon some little theology they have or something they have been taught since a child and still they find that down in their being down in their soul they still have something that's not right you many are here this morning no doubt whether you where wherever you find Christians gathered together you find people who has those Spirits in them it's undesirable they don't want them they say oh if I can only quit lying if I can only quit lusting if I can only quit this or that how many can say Amen how many know what the prophet is talking about now that is devil and now they come in the form of religion many time being it's Sunday school it's a time of teaching so let's look into this now they come in the form of religion many times so brother bam and we're going to get back into that message because he gives us an answer on how to overcome that and how to deal with that and as we've been talking with you Saints about the three ringed man a three ring Circle that how the prophet talked about that I don't know if we have an image of that we don't or do we yeah thank you and there's so our our soul our spirit and our body now we don't separate those they they're they're separate because they do separate things but they work interchangeably and um what the Lord wants to do is heal every level of the human being of the human heart he wants to heal your heart he wants to heal the way you process things the way you think about other people the way you think about yourself the way you think your attitude that inner Spirit he wants to heal that he wants to get his hands on that there and um your body your spirit in your soul and so brother manam goes into the message enticing spirits and he deals with the human being and he said that the FBI they use this with the lie detector test this is what it's working on he says you are made in the image of God you're not even though you're Fallen you're a sinner inside of you your conscience knows when you're telling a lie and brother random says you were not made to tell a lie sinner or Saint whoever you are a human being he has that conscience in there he's not made to tell a lie and so when he tells a lie there's a reaction that takes place they're able to document this and they call it the lie detector test so brother branam brings that in and and this just is a is just a visual to show you Soul spirit and your body and he takes the message faith is the six sense preached it in 19 60 you all going to pray with me just for a moment and he says this in paragraph number one he says now these senses was given to you to only to contact your Earthly home that you might see taste feel smell and hear but there're by no means to lead you and now many times what if I refuse to look anymore and I just bind my eyes and say I refuse to look all right my my eyes can't serve me no more I'll finally go I'll go blind and then when my Boy comes on I'll tie his eyes up and say no sir there's no such a thing as sight I'll just tie his eyes up don't let him see he said my father told me there's no such a thing as sight so I'll tie up my boy's eyes well the first thing you know our generation would be born blind that's right if you don't use your six senses they become dormant they won't act at all what do they call that when you lay up in the bed and you you don't use your muscles atrophy atrophy you're not using them they're there the same muscles are there the same you is there but if you're not using them you begin to lose them and this is why the Simplicity of a message on Divine Healing the the message of Divine Healing is not my message that is a Heavenly message God sent the message of healing of our body to us that belongs to us we're not asking God to heal us he already declared that we're healed so when we approach him it's not like Lord give me a favor or Lord I'm lucky maybe I'll win the lottery or maybe I'll win a healing ticket and maybe I might get no that's not that's not it at all he's already purchased healing for you it's already yours am and if we can come with that assurance and have that Assurance in our mind and in our hearts then we just receive it and we claim it by the blood of God by the word of God and it becomes a reality to us to us and so he says they'll you'll lose them they won't act at all and he says this brother that's what the church has done to the six since God put them in let me ask you this let me ask you a question in this church here let's say we are we are called what what they call a message church and I take all the tapes and all the sermons recorded sermons of brother ranom and I'm having I I stack them up on the wall cre create a nice little rack over there and I have all the tapes over there then we have the good old Bible here and we have all the word of God it's all sitting there and you come into that church and it's dead I mean no life in it at all now now is that an indictment on the message sir is that an indictment on the Bible but have we seen that this is a man that has healthy muscles but he can't walk because he's not using them to walk and the the ability to walk is all there the prescriptions how you need to exercise how you need to practice it's all hanging up on the wall we have the instructions there it's all here we have witnesses we have evidence if you are not walking that is not an indictment on God that is not an indictment on his word that is not an in that's not because we have turned a corner that is because somebody chose to not let these things happen or work in their lives the Bible said that he put the gifts God gave gifts unto men he put those gifts in the church did he ever take those gifts out of the church they're in God's Church they might not be in your church but they're in God's church because they're in the Bible Church and when God wants to use those gifts he will as he chooses and he wants to so as a minister as brothers and sisters we're simply you know just going through the attic of what really belongs to us I'm going through the attic of mom and dad stuff and seeing what really belongs to me and that's the way you have to approach this word what really belongs to you I I don't want to sit in the same condition that I've always been I want to move on up a little bit higher a little bit more anointing a little more Victory a little more Victory can you use a touch of a touch more victory of Victory in Jesus that's all I want I just want another touch more and God has it for me he has it for you too he said that's what they done with the six sent brother the church has done the six sense God put him in he's just placed Faith Off In Miracles and signs and the things that contacts God gives him the Holy Ghost and things he's placed that off over there back over here somewhere till the thing has become dead you know some people they eulogize the quote it's a live quote it's aive scripture but the way they present it is dead like a eulogy the scripture didn't die the scripture is a liive it's on fire you might be dead but if you put it in the hands of a True Believer that thing will work just like it's always work yes you know I can claim my family because I seen others claim their family it worked on them it'll work in my family now the unbeliever will say well my familyes they're Hypocrites that's your family that is not our family here we believe in the token here we claim our loved ones you say it's going to take a miracle to save him exactly it took a miracle to save you and God is the miracle working God he's the one that's got the power to create a way when there is no way you can't see a way he'll create one amen yes cuz the word of God is alive and don't let the churches eulogize this word it's not dead it's alive so brother Brandon brings us in faith as a six sense and he says this right towards the end of the message in paragraph number 45 he says this here all right are you ready to receive your healing all of you you're going to put your six sense to work what is the six sense now it's faith and faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things that makes Missouri wrong I'm from Missouri you have to show me you know got to see it faith is that thing that subdues kingdoms that rots righteousness that does all kinds of Miracles and signs of the six sense wake it up take the bandage off your spiritual eyes look look around see if you can't see that God Still Remains God take the bandage off your ey you're a Believer here you are a Believer and every word of God belongs to you take the bandage off your eyes you can see these promises I love that and reading these quotes the bandages are coming off my eyes I don't know if I get too fired up I might have to leave here yeah would you come with me where are we going I'm going up yonder I'm getting up out of here this is not my home all the news they talking about it's garbage but there's a place there's a land where this message came from that's where I'm going back to by the glory of God by the grace of God you know we can't stay here the same the position you're sitting in right now you can't stay the same that's right that's right we don't think of it that way but in five years some of you all will be married and maybe move on some of you you know will move on in your life in other areas of your life your careers even jobs you've had there's changes that always happen but there's one thing that will not change and this is what we don't want to change in our heart and in our Spirits the unmovable faith in God's word am you know all of the things out here are going to change the laws will change the pressures on the job will change how you can talk to people will change I talking to two of my friends they're in the corporate world and they work these nine-five jobs and and they were telling me that time of the year they have to go through their sexual harassment training I was like wow what is that and they explain all of the the things they have to be careful of now and my one friend he said at the end they asked if he could give a comment and he wanted to give a comment but his computer broke down he said he's kind of glad he didn't because giving a comment ain't going to stop nobody preaching on the corner is not going to stop them this great machine of where they're moving to that's right they're high on it they're anointed brother brandom says because the last day says they would do what they're doing with the loss and so us going after them and fighting them it's not going to St them stop them it's just going to give you heartaches and stress but if you pick up the Bible and begin to read that and you let that come into your spirit that's going to bring Health to your bones it'll bring peace in your mind it'll give you Clarity and you'll know how to stand when you're dealing with the foolishness of the day it'll give you a faith when when there's so much darkness and doubt and unbelief it always lifts you up to where he is because it's the word of the Lord it cannot fail and when we take God at his word he keeps his word he backs his word up and he will always be with you as you stay with his word amen so we can't stay the same we can't stay the same we got to move on but the word of the Lord will endure and the things that's going to change in me let them be the changes for the better my body my spirit and my soul can I get a witness now this six sense that he says to take off the bandage of your eyes so that you can see how many you got some bandages on your eyes that you need to see clearly you know we have times where we operate in faith and then we get discouraged and we go down a little bit but you know this is why we're in the word today this is why we're in service today not just to be seen I'm actually trying to find a word I'm trying to find a word of the Lord that will raise up my faith amen that's what I came here for that's what we're gathered here for to hear the word of the Lord and Faith cometh by hearing the word of the Lord the god of this evil age brother bam says this here paragraph 189 he starts in his prayer paragraph 188 and he's talking to the Lord and He how he he's trusting for great services and the power of God that there will be great signs and wonders let's read it paragraph 188 I was going to skip it but let's read that this is Brother Bron's prayer to the people here I think this is in Tabernacle and I trust Lord tonight that there will be a great service that the power of God will be here great signs and wonders as we heard the results from these last couple of meetings let me stop here sorry I hate to stop but I'll pick it back up what kind of prayer is that I mean I mean can I pray that prayer in this church and you all don't look at me weird I mean listen to the prayer listen to the prayer to his congregation and I trust Lord tonight that there will be a great service that the power of God will be here great signs and wonders as we heard the from the results from the last couple of meetings how tremendous see what happened I pray dear God that you'll give us a double portion tonight I pray it with a sincere heart Lord because it's my love for you and your word and for these people granted dear God and if out across the land or even in here now that there's some that's sick and Afflicted and has to be gone tonight won't be here or be out there in the churches or places where they'll met I pray you'll heal them now Lord but for the greatest of all healing if you'll heal uh if you heal their physical body from cancer TB pneumonia something they'll get sick again no doubt if they live very long for their body is still under sin the curse but let them get the real Divine Healing the the healing of the Soul which makes a new creature passes from Death unto life and then waiting in this old Tabernacle for the Redemption of the body after the soul has been redeemed granted Lord what a prayer what a prayer thank God for a prophet who prayed the prayer of faith amen and we can use that as our example is that right amen now this this enticing Spirit as we started in on the on that quote cancer in the soul and how brother banam is dealing with Christians that have evil things in them they don't want them there and then he starts to talk about that um aligning these things up and I've read these quotes before over the years and I read them I think earlier this year this particular quote out of the same message enticing Spirits we play the tape here for you but it's good to go back and hear it and see how he breaks down what he calls demonology and he's bringing in the uh um that was one of the things that I mentioned the the gentleman's name he did the eulogy for brother brandom's um um service in Phoenix what was his name Osborne but I was mentioning how his wife had gave testimony and she said that when brother random came up to the platform form and he started preaching she said something she never thought of she said he asked the question where diseases come from and so if you know the diseases come from Satan and you're a Christian then you can categorize that these things do not belong to me as a Believer that's the foundation where did cancer come from where did rheumato arthritis come from to burco Lois and pneumonia where did that come from blindness and all the diseases what is it a result of it's a result of sin and then tell me what this means right here that day on Calvary that was the answer to all of our sins all of our diseases everything that would ever ill a human being if he finds the cross he can find his healing right there at the cross God and so she he brings this to the people brother brandom does and then in in his message he brings this Triune being and and these men that we the three men that we was talking about Body Soul and Spirit and he goes deeper into this message and it just won't it won't take me long to get through this and then I want to take that message Christ is the mystery of God revealed and right at the beginning and many churches have it in the front a word to to the church how many read that heard that very nice and something that we want to hear and read so he takes paragraph 43 he says this here oh if people could only realize that's why I come this morning and ask you to remember me as I go overseas and all things pray someone came the other day and said brother random do you think it's wrong to do a certain thing I said why are you question me about see if there's a question in your mind leave it alone don't do it at all I wish I could show you that ring up there in your spirit if there's a question inside of you then don't do it at all there's a question inside of you down in your spirit from your soul there's a question is this wrong to do if there's a question in there and then your body goes and does it anyway there's a conflict there and you can't have faith where there's a conflict so if there's a question then leave it alone God's word wasn't presented to you as a question am I the Lord that healed no it declares I am the Lord that heals you I am your salvation it's a declaration it's clear it's not a question and he says now all things ought to be considered prayerfully first seek ye first the kingdom of God and his right righteousness and all these other things will be added I am positive sure this morning if men and women could only get into the position where their soul their thinking their attitude will be perfect in the side of God that would be one of the most powerful churches that ever existed watch for a few moments on the physical now we have many times in half for years what we call a lie detector you can put it on your wrist set it across their head you can get in there and try your best to make a lie sound like the truth and it'll register negative every time because the human was not made to lie lying is a deceitful hard thing evil thing I'd rather have a drunkard with me any day than a liar see a liar in your body wasn't made to lie no matter how sinful you are your still a fallen Son of God the most sinful person in this city today God didn't intend you to be sinful he wanted you to be a son or daughter of his you're made up in his own makeup but sin has caused you to do that and no matter how much you try to impersonate and try to make a lie seem right they've got a scientific instrument that proves that it's wrong you can tell it with all the Innocence you want to but it's still register negative because there's a subconscious down in a human being and that subc conscience knows what's truth and no matter what you're saying out here that subconscious knows that it's a lie and it'll register off the subconscious therefore if a man or woman could ever get their thoughts and their testimony and their lives so lined up with God Amen until the channel of the holy spirit will be perfectly one with God what would take place if the man and woman could get lined up where with the freedom from their heart with Faith from the innermost don't you desire that don't you long for that your inner man and your testimony and your thoughts all be lined up with the word of God isn't that what we desire these little conflicts that come within us and you know sometimes we're conflicted how many's ever I won't ask you to raise your hand but how many's ever known you knew at one time in your Christian Journey that you should have gone up for prayer when it was offered but something kept you in your seat now down inside of you you know good and well if there was nobody there you would have got up and said Lord help me right now I need a touch from you but see that conflict of your body and our Christianity and what they're going to think about me and all this and that you need to let that go and come clean before the Lord then we'll have a worship service that'll be from your heart and you won't be looking around seeing who's praising the Lord or not but God will be dealing with your soul in your heart in your life we're conflicted looking around religion produces that church atmosphere produces it but the word of the Lord sees right down through you anyways and his grace and mercy will still find you even when you deny him it'll find you and his grace will still catch up with you and give you another opportunity to say yes Lord yes Lord I'm so glad he's faithful when I'm not faithful he's honest when I'm not honest he's persistent oh when I deny him he still comes after me and he keeps on blessing me keeps anointing me thank you Lord prophet God continues he says our thoughts Our Testimony Our Lives to be lined up look at this in paragraph 48 many people come to the altar to be prayed for they have intellectual Faith they confess their sins and join Church by intellectual Faith they believe it in their mind they believe it because they've heard it they believe it because they know it's the best policy but that's not what God looks at he don't look at your intellectual Faith he looks on the heart we on the inside God and when it comes from the heart all things said all things are all things all things are POS when it comes from the heart that's where I want to get to I want to get where it comes from my heart I believe it with all of my heart then all things are possible sir to them that believe that's what Jesus said that's what your Bible said is in the message message notice he continues but when your confession says one thing and your life lives another there's something wrong somewhere that's because you've got an intellectual faith and not a Faith from the heart and that shows the outside here is a knowledge of God but inside here is a demon ad doubting now I'm moving along quite quickly here but I'm going to slow down a little bit I might not get to the word of to the church I'm going to stop right at 6:30 all right but the prophet of God now says it's a demon doubting so we'd have to say it's not the Holy Spirit doubting causing you to doubt what's causing you to doubt where does sickness come from huh where does the sleepiness come from just when God's trying to speak to you I got to get my rest you know my body told me I got to get my rest you get your rest in the grave brother you get your rest on the other side over here we're working till Jesus come you need to drink a cup of cold water or pour some ice on your face wake up and then pray through huh somebody I get a head notot or something you know what I'm talking about how many's ever how many's ever you trying to get your sleep it's so sweet and at 2:00 3:00 in the morning you just wide awake can't go to sleep brother bam talks about that's the time that you should pray maybe God wants to speak to you but you want to stay committed to the body cuz I got to get my rest I got to work in the morning tell me what's more important God wants to fellowship with you and all the demons and everything else is sleep they all passed out from drinking and foolishness of the world everybody in the neighborhood sleep he says okay I want to talk with you wake him up wake him up and you wake up you roll over you're trying to get that sleep get that sleep you can't sleep rise up and grab the word of the Lord fall on your knees and pray and see maybe the Lord has something for you and so but he says it's a demon doubting um I believe in Divine Healing but it's not for me see oh I could be so but I don't believe it get it outside you say yes inside your conscience says no the same scientific thing would prove that that wasn't the right prove it notice paragraph 52 he says give me a preacher give me a Christian give me a housewife that's a Christian give me a farmer or a factory worker that will put God first in everything I'll show you a man who will be successful in spite of all the devil can put on him he seeks God first we must he must have first place so brother bam goes into this even further this message enticing Spirits I'm going to get to the answer of that I keep getting sidetracked pulled away a little bit but this is this is very good and paragraph 53 he says this and I want you to you you want to take time to go listen to that message it's very good I just took out these things how he brought in the cancer of the body and then he brought cancer in the soul and now he's talking about there's a demon doubting so this is this is what happens to True Believers this is a process that actually happens to us and is happening to us and um the prophet of God is going to help us through the word of the Lord to get through it paragraph 15 3 he says but they didn't do it they were clouded over because Ahab a great Bri Kingdom he had it done a whole lot of things drop down to paragraph 54 he says that's where the world is today that's where America stands today that's where the churches stand today we've built some of the best churches was ever built we have some of the best polish Scholars we ever had we've taught some of the best theology and so forth and learned to sing like Angels but yet there's a weakness somewhere there's a weakness because we've gone after man's Doctrine and enticing Spirits instead of coming back to the word of God they try to make things pattern like the world they try to put shining lights over it like Hollywood and brother bam goes on and he says how do you let go paragraph 96 so many people are wondering today saying well brother brandham how do you let go I know you heard a lot of theology on it let go a lot of people just work up a sweat trying to let go many people come around and say I was going on a 40-day fast so I can do something you don't need a 40-day fast you need to let go of the world and all these devilish things and take God's word in your heart you've got to be taught how to do that you don't do it by jumping up and down neither do you do it on a 40-day fast you do it by a surrendered heart to almighty God look at the example he gives us are you there tonight like a baby I noticed my little baby back there his mother trying to put his little jacket on him this morning he wanted to get his little old arm in the sleeve he couldn't put his arm in there he didn't know how you've got to guide his little arm he wants to get his arm in there but he's just beating all around it he never gets to the sleeve he knows he's not in the sleeve and so do you know that you're not right with God when you're still backbiting lying doing everything you can't be right with God I don't care how many churches you belong to until your soul becomes converted brother that's oldfashioned but that will boil down and put soup in your soul try to put his arm in he's got to have someone to direct him in how how to put his arm in then when he gets his arm in the little jacket he knows it's all right that's the way it is with every born again Christian when he's really gets into God he watches his life with God's word he realizes he's lined up with every bit of it he's got longsuffering gentleness quietness meekness power Faith love joy peace he ain't tossed about like the troubled sea he ain't worried about every little thing he ain't jumping here and there like a bottle stoer on the windy ocean he's set his heart is pure his thoughts is pure his intentions are pure his alternative is right and he knows he's lined up with the word of God all hell can't move him he's lined up by the word of God he's got Divine love Purity in his heart for every man and woman he's abstained from the things of the world they're dead to him he don't want them no more why you couldn't make a holy ghost girl put on a pair of them ungodly looking clothes and get out there for nothing no sir can I take one more paragraph paragraph 113 just to wrap this up and so brother banam is saying throughout the message and he makes this statement it's enticing Spirits versus the word of God that's what it is paragraph number 113 enticing Spirits versus the word of God let let loose let go how do you do it brother bam just let go that's all you have to do take God's word don't try to work up nothing don't get at the altar and beat on it holler God give me the Holy Ghost Lord give me the Holy Ghost um he ain't coming you beating on that altar that don't do no good no that ain't the way it comes it's taking him at his word why because the word has the healing virtues in it you take God at his word that's how it comes you surrender to his word and he does the rest of it is that right he deals with the fear the conflicts he deals with the enticing spirits that you know something isn't right you know it's not being honest but yet the lie detector would catch it and you know but yet we get by and we have that little conflict in there and we want that conflict to be removed we want our thinking our soul Our Testimony to be lined up how many know this doesn't have nothing to do with the Baptist Church or the Pentecostal church this has nothing to do with the other churches actually it doesn't have anything to do with anyone in this church this is between you and God you focus in on that and it becomes real to you you're walking with him one onone you're be getting into a deeper relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ he's the one who called you and saved you and he wants to have the closer walk with you as I read the quote earlier on the if a man can get his soul and his thinking if he can get all those things lined up he says that that would be if he can get his thoughts his testimony his life if he can get his soul thinking his attitude in the perfect plan of God that would be the most powerful church that ever existed and when he's talking about a church he's talking about an individual if you can get a person lined up like that that would be the most powerful individual we think of church we're thinking of a group of people here let's everybody share this quote so we can all see this together doesn't work that way you got to see it for yourself that's good you have your own salvation you actually have your own testimony and can't nobody tell your testimony if they told your testimony they probably eulogize it yeah he did this yeah he's just Chang yeah but no that's not your testimony your testimony is on fire I was on my way to hell but somebody changed me somebody delivered me that's real that's what happened to me you don't tell my testimony I can tell my own testimony I lived it and I'm so glad that I'm saved and I'm so glad that I'm Healed in my mind my spirit and my body God bless you richly don't you love the Lord now look at this here let me show you here this was going to be the dessert tonight that was the word to the church you guys have a little room for dessert as brother lzi says I have a little space right here for a piece of pie or something sweet okay I'm not going to read it all but it is in paragraph 80 the paragraph 87 and brother brandham gives the warning he says it twice remember my warning he's talking about a nice little church full of love he says remember remember my warning Satan won't let it stay that way this look like they're pushing me to read that amen I'll read let me read some of it all right you know how you get into one scoop and you have to eat the whole the whole plate right let's let's just read it just for a moment I have a few more moments all right will you say praise the Lord all the way through will you feed on it will you be thankful this is God's word this is brother brandom now this is to the brandom Tabernacle before he brings that tremendous message Christ The Mystery of God revealed love one another above everything love one another don't no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning see Satan won't let that stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his Target he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in and sit him down and cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness in things and then you'll shoot that guy with some kind of a poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with anything else you stay right loving and sweet and kind to one another pray for that man that he'll be saved to or that woman ever who it is just pray for them and stick one with another stay with your pastor see he's the shepherd and you give him respects he'll lead you through because he's ordained of God to do so now do you remember that the enemy will come and when he does just cling that much closer together and the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you that's all don't never Clan among or talk make yourself clannish we are one I couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you I'm going to take you away cuz you're not a right hand he's my left hand I want him to stay there even the little tip of my finger I want to stay right there every little part of my body stay right there and God wants us as a body of Believers to stay right exactly with one another right at with one another now you got tapes on that you got tapes on what we believe you got tapes on discipline in the church now how we behave ourselves in the Church of God how we got to come here together and sit together in Heavenly places don't stay home if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers if you don't feel that way then I tell you it's time you got to pray cuz we're in the last days where the Bible exhorted us much more as we see the day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in Heavenly places and Christ Jesus and love one another this will all men know that you are my disciples when you have loved one for the other that's right stay right together if the brother you think he's a little wrong or a sister say Lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness spring up cuz it'll affect him and it'll take the Christ right out of my life that poison acid acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you it will run him from the Tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of God or drive it away from here hurt your pastor it'll do everything see don't you do that you just wax that much closer together draw up take the Buckle as the brother testified Minister here the other night about having a buckle see it in a vision just that buckles on the whole armor of God just pull her on tighten up move right out close to one another love another anyhow talk nice about one another say nice things about one another and then God will bless you what am I supposed to do with that quote I'm supposed to believe it it starts by reading it again and again and again good and then meditating on what he just warned me he said Satan's going to come and then watch my motives and my actions as it pertains to this am I jumping on the side am I trying to am I talking nice about one another am I doing these things Lord help us those enticing Spirits against the word of God God richly bless you how many are saved tonight how many's healed what part of you you is healed all of me I'm Healed by the grace of God I can run through the streets I'm [Music] delivered I'm Healed I'm saved amen and that is the truth God bless you let's pray musicians come heavenly father thank you for the word of God tonight thank you for the word of God that you've given to us in this last day something for us to behold and to read and to let it manifest in our life oh God I pray that you would move us into the areas of our faith where would be exercised where maybe we have have let it go dormant take off the bandage of our spiritual eye and let us begin to see things that these things are all things are possible even a little thing oh God you answer just our simple prayers showing that you're with us oh God and let that increase more and let us accept it let us testify of it and then Lord you'll increase those blessings in our life and it'll increase our faith uh with thee Lord our faith in thee for the word of God is our prayer we love you we thank you we

lift you up [Music] magnify your name why my heart is filled with praise amen that's why my heart is filled with praise amen we'll go to the Lord in prayer brother Joe why don't you to come and just miss us in a word of prayer amen those that have to go you can go we'll Worship the Lord a little bit amen right go ahead thank you thank you my brother yes a moment ago I decided if you would call me up I mention a quote to you something that came to my mind during the yes the sermon tonight did you enjoy that did that help you along the way I so appreciate that that tonight let's praise the Lord praise tonight it's very simple so brother Joe can get it but uh what are these sermons God leaning man or something along those lines brother Brandon was talking about a sister here and a sister over here and he said the demon is calling to another do you remember what it's calling for to accumulate it's not to oppress you sure it's oppression is maybe bad thoughts is this and that and the other accumulate what is that one trying to accumulate you remember unbelief it's that simple we just believe and and uh just so powerful tonight that there's enough here that we can believe and maybe you're struggling with this something that demon yes it wants to oppress you but it really wants you to unbeli disbelieve the word of God that you know those 70 left eat my flesh drink my blood the Lord did not chase them down as I really didn't mean to eat this we're going to have a symbol and it's the blood and the life and the flesh didn't try to change that but he said are you going to go too no where will we go because we're Believers tonight and so if you got something in your life something oppressing you or a family member just apply that token tonight because the demons just want us to to disbelief to unbelief they're trying to accumulate that someh some way but we're Believers and we just call the name of the Lord together tonight dear God we're so thankful to be gathered in your presence Lord because you you just took a simple life like ours Lord and you allowed us to to believe Lord and to come together and when we have that Revelation doesn't matter what you say it doesn't matter what the prophet says Lord because we're Believers we don't always understand we want to walk straigh or we want to walk the narrow way Lord the with you Lord with one another and where there's a doubt or a maybe something we're not exactly sure of the Prophet just made it real plain and simple just stay away from that if you're not sure and and then let that go and then maybe some way down the road if you're strong or if something changes maybe the Lord will let you to bring that thing in or just or whatever it is in our lives we we don't want anything between us and you we just want to have a a real relationship with you tonight and so we just call upon the name of the Lord and Lord you said there in the word to the church at the end there the brother Isel read how that we want to be blessed Lord and you taught us how to do that very simple Lord I want to say nice things about this church nice things about those that I'm working with nice things Lord and and think nice things and then you said we could be blessed and so we want to do that Lord just help us along the way the the battles the it's very divisive time that we live in Lord set these two parties against one another set us uh the churches the Saints Lord something in between us that would hinder us Lord that then would cause that doubt to come and and we're not disbelievers but we believe we want to say nice things encourage one another and just let your spirit work in our lives oh God so as we depart tonight we just claim your power your healing Lord every promise that you've given to us
