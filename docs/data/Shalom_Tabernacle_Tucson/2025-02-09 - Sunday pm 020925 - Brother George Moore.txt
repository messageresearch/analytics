to sing is all right so if you would remember my brother Joe in your prayers he needs a touch from the master [Music] tonight and uh this song that we're going to sing is taken from The Book of John chapter nine it was the man that was born blind from his birth when Jesus came by and spit in the ground made the clay and anointed his eyes with it and he sent him to the pool of salom to to go wash and he never saw Jesus's face when when he was able to see and they asked him who healed you he says all I know is he touched me I was blind but now I can see and I think that's all of our testimony tonight we were blind but now we can see he fashioned These Eyes of clay and just thankful for the chance again to come and be Washed by the Water of the word tonight and amen let's just we sing A Chorus at the end that I know you'll all know and can join in with me [Music] tonight born in a world of Endless Night Darkness was all he knew without the light what could he hope to do begging for bread day after day living in dark despair why must it be did anybody care the sound of a voice the touch of a hand healing These Eyes of clay cleansed in a pool blindness was washed away how can this be how does he see tell us who was this man the beggar replied I'm just not sure I can all I know he touched me from the dark I am free blinded eyes now can see how to follow all I know he touched me from the dark I am free and now I know that he is all I know and I too was lost hopelessly lost Darkness surrounded me alone in the night without the light to see but then he passed by light of the world touch in these eyes of clay piercing the dark chasing the night away all I know he he touched me from the dark I am free blinded eyes now can see how to follow all I know he touched me from the dark I am free and now I know that he is all I know oh yes he touched me oh he touched me and oh the joy that floods my soul for something something happened and now oh now I know that he touched me and he made me whole just sing it one more time oh he touched me oh he touched me he and oh the joy that floods my soul amen with all your heart this evening something happened and now now I know he touch me he made me sing that one more time his brother Israel makes ready oh he touched me he touch [Applause] me oh joy Bloods my soul my soul something something happened and now I know he touched me and made me home am man can you lift your hands and say thank you Jesus amen that's that's who touched me the Lord Jesus Christ so happy to be in the house of the Lord with you this evening just before we go to the word of the Lord just another announcement on um the Cedar Hills Church of the cross our good friends the Petes Caleb Pettis and Tommy Jr is the assistant pastor there but they have their youth service starting February the 22nd at 12:00 and that will be posted on the back there you're all welcome to come it's a I think it's a three hour three and a half hour drive maybe I think you lose an hour but they're always they're good friends to the ministry here they always seem to support us whenever we can have them and so they've asked me to come and so pray for us on that meeting if you can't go pray for us amen for those meetings and just before brother George comes we had some pictures just a look back they're really short five minutes starting back from when we started uh here in this building um we were um in a hotel H for a few months June of 2016 is when we started right at the Rada or was the hotel in Suites they gave us one little hotel room there for two nights or Sunday and then a Wednesday night and then they let us take another room there as we could and the hustle and bustle trying to find a place to worship so I contacted the tday school district and um they were very friendly and nice they really look uh forward to having churches occupy their space because it cuts down on the vandalism I was told and so as we were looking for a place they said um the one lady Shelly she said um hey you know there's a building that used to be a church um would you be interested looking at sure so she sends me the address and I pull up here and this was Caleb used to be amazing grace Tabernacle used to worship here and this pull pit was over there they had a curtain and they sound booth was arranged differently so we got a hold of that at a very good price um first year was two was a two-year lease and they raised their rent on us one time still very very low and from that time till now they have not raised the rent they've been very favorable to us and we just was just one of those things we found it's on a beautiful well the neighborhood is not as beautiful as Beauty's in eye of the beholder so it depends on what you're looking at what time of the day you're looking but not far it's right on the open Street there and we the Lord has blessed us here right in this location and that was no wisdom of Our Own It was available we just followed the leading of the Lord and this has served us very well and so we have complaints but I refrain from complaining about this building because when we thought we were going to have to release or go to another place we realized we had a really good deal here right and so the expense for commercial property and so forth was just uh ridiculous but the Lord kept us here safe all these years we had our little incidences of B you know things were taken and stuff like that but um we've had some folks get baptized too and uh that little couple you see here whether um dug he is you know we did an Outreach meeting during covid and he was one of the ones he sat right up under me brother Isaiah Brooks sang and we sang and then he preached and Doug came with his big old cooler drink and he sat right up under just staring and looking and he said I'm going to come to your church I said yeah okay sure and he actually came and he's been coming ever since and he's probably single-handedly brought more visitors to this church Church than any one member oh yes and he's had me go to the hospitals to pray for his mother his friend and this one and that one and and so every time he calls I try to answer him I can't all the time but um and so that's you know that's what it is you the Lord sends you the people that he wants to come into your life and so and he has you uh walk where you're walking and so that's why we've been here and the Lord's bless us with another a place to go to not wisdom of our own but the the um the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord there's a scripture brother Ernie brother Ernie um there on Thursday night it's a scripture where Paul greets the church greetings holy Brethren and if we would never call each other holy Brethren but that's what the Bible says so look at your neighbor and says greetings holy brethren all right that's the Bible now don't praise the Lord and so just a few moments and then they'll just play this slideshow um or I think it's about five minutes and then we'll uh get into the word amen God bless you [Music] I [Music] [Music] I [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I [Music] amen praise the Lord God bless you I know there's quite a few pictures that may be missing and so the that was the last minute put together um and if you have pictures you want to add to that then uh they'll probably do that again let's all stand to our feet and sing the old Hymn of the church Amazing Grace as our brother George comes as you come looking to hear from the word of the Lord amen amen sing Grace how sweet the sound that save a r like me oh I was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see can we say praise God let's raise those hands praise God praise God praise God praise God praise [Music] God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God amen amen how many of you is happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen just an honor and a privilege to be here and maybe while we're all standing we'll go ahead and read our scripture tonight and get right into the word and I'm just curious by show of hands uh how many people we got that was here at the very first service in this building let me see oh my look at there all right well praise let Give the Lord a hand of Praise can we amen amen amen well thank the Lord for that Lord's been good to us hasn't he amen St John the first chapter we'll begin tonight for our scripture reading very very familiar scripture it should be to all of us St John the first chapter you know one thing I found down through life that if the Lord closes a door it's only because he has another door open for you and so we're so grateful for that and and Lord the things that he's done for us uh uh you can't make it up I mean you couldn't scrip it you couldn't have planned it the way he's done it it but the way he does it is perfect St John the first chapter in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in the darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light that was the True Light which lith every man that cometh into the world he was not he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came to his own and his own received him not but as many has received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God shall we bow our heads Heavenly Father we're so grateful tonight Lord to be assembled together with the purchase of your blood Lord the Bride of Jesus Christ Lord we don't take it for granted the opportunity that we have to gather Lord we don't know Lord how much longer we have on this world but Lord however much longer we have we want to spend it in service for you we want to spend it Lord doing all that we can for the kingdom of God and Lord Jesus we don't want to just halfway get through life but Lord we want to be victorious we want to accomplish that what you've have us to do we want to do the things you'd have us to do Lord and Lord God to to do the work that you want us to work father and we committed into your hands tonight Lord bless your people we pray father Lord I ask you to watch over me and bind my lips before I'd speak anything unpleasing to you and we'll commit it into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the church said amen God bless you the title of the message tonight is enlightened by the shikina glory you may be seated enlightened by the shakina glory everybody all right tonight all right well praise the Lord so Saint this little scripture uh that we just read John here he says in him was life in Jesus Christ was life and he says that the life was the light of men and we understand that the life was not just the light of good men it's the light of all men and we understand that sometimes you wonder how you know people can live around the message and can be doing the things that they're doing well it's because the life was the light of all men but we find that the light of Jesus Christ is actually the life that you and I live and the light shines in the darkness and the Darkness comprehends it not see the world doesn't understand what you and I understand and so they don't understand the life that you and I live they they don't understand what it is it doesn't make any sense to them saints because it's a light that's inside of each and every one of us it's the light is the life we live can you say Amen to that tonight and that he said it was the True Light that lith every man that cometh into the world and he says but as many as receive him to them gave power to become the sons of God aren't you thankful to be one that has received him tonight that he has given power to become the sons of God can you say Amen to that tonight Saints so I'm glad saints that I I've been given the ability to be a Son of God it it means everything to me that I'm a Son of God tonight I I didn't choose this path this path was chosen for me and I'm so grateful that he chose it for me tonight Saints and in him was life and the life was the light the life was the light amen so it's not just it's not just the word on paper it's not just the word in the Bible it's not just the word in the message but it's the word in you it's the light you live that's the light of all men can you say Amen tonight it's not the Bible in book form it's the Bible in you that's the life Saints and the son the Su n brings life into the world the the sun is what shines down on the earth and and the plant life and the animal life they they absorb that sun they receive that sun and the Sun that they receive brings forth life in them now is that right amen and the s o n is the same way Saints the s o n shines down on the seed word that's planted on the inside of you and I tonight and when it shines on the seed word it brings forth life the light is what brings forth that life now the word light the Greek word means fos it means to shine or to make manifest see the life is what manifests the light is what manifests the life whatever seed good or bad that's in a person when the light strikes it it manifests it it makes it known and you might be able to pretend to be a believer you might be able to pretend that you love the Lord but sooner or later when the light strikes it'll make known of what kind of seed is on the inside my wife's grandpa said that time was a tattletail time will tell on you eventually you can act like you're a Believer for a little while but you can't go forever and you can't hide that life and the life is what shines out against the darkness of the world it's such a stark contrast between the believer and the rest of the world it's a stark contrast between the life that you live and the life that the world lives it's such a stark contrast and and it condemns the world when they see it and you can't hide it people know what you are you don't have to say you're a Christian you don't have to say you're a Believer brother John people know you're a Believer they pick up on things they say man he don't he don't swear and he don't drink and he what's going on with that guy right there I bet he's one of those Christian types you sisters you're an example to the rest of the world when you walk out of this church everybody in the world sees that you're a Believer it's a testimony to what you believe they see it they recognize it they recognize the light that is the life that is in you and people that don't even think they believe the way we believe will call you for prayer is that right they don't agree with you but they want you to pray for them why because the light is the life and it's in you and it just matters what kind of seed is down on the inside those Pharisees were staunch they were they were real message believers they they obeyed all the law they they kept all the Commandments amen but they called Jesus a devil but a woman that had five husbands said Thou Art Christ the son of the Living God because the light was striking the seed and it don't matter where you're at Saints it don't matter what condition you're in when the light strikes the seed the light is the life and it will produce the Life of Christ in you I don't know where you was I know where I was and I know I was in the mud and I know I was in the muck and I know my life was trash but the light struck a seed on the inside and it brought forth life come on somebody tonight it brings forth life because there's a seed germ laying there ready to ripen and when it comes in contact with the life it's got to bring forth it can't stop because the light is the life brother Ram said in the message why Christ speak he says and that little prostitute said why this fell is the Messiah and he says the scripture says he'll do this see that predestinated seed was laying there and a prostitute that had five husbands and the one she was with now wasn't her husband but inside of her was a predestinated seed Saints now we had all given up on a woman like that but Jesus knew what was in there and when the light Struck it brother BR said it came to life you can't keep it down you can't hide life he said you can take and pour concrete upon a bunch of grass and it'll kill it in the winter time but the next spring where's the most grass hat right around the edge of the concrete CA the gerti seed under that stone when the sun begins to shine you can't hold it he said oh it'll wiggle its way around through there and come right out to the Hedge and stick its head up and say glory to the god you can't hide life he said when sun strikes bottling life it has to live oh God say that's what happened to me when the sun struck I had to lay I had to oh God I had to change when a holy spirit strikes the scriptural life that's in a man it brings forth its fruit right there he said oh God and once the light is inside of you you become the light once the Life of Christ is inside the believer the believer then becomes the light see he got no hands with your hands he ain't got no voice with yours he's using you now the light become comes the life Matthew 514 he says ye are the light of the world Jesus said ye that's you you are the light of the world is that what the Bible said Saints you are the light of the world and a city that's set on a hill cannot be hid he said neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house he said let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven so he said let your light shine before men not so that you can get Glory but so that he can get Glory whatever God's give you let it shine Saints so that you can glorify him not so you can puff yourself up or think you're something or think you got an ability or think you got a talent it all comes from him he's the light but you let the light shine so you can glorify him y'all believe that tonight Saints and I want you to notice that the closer you get to God the more mistakes or faults you find out you have let me say it again the closer you get to God the more takes you find out you got see Saints the light shines on the Dark Places you know you can paint a wall brother Israel and you can think that wall looks good until the light hits it and when the light hits it you realize all the spots you missed you can have a Smooth Wall of sheetrock and it can look real good until the light hits it and you realize all the spots that's not that's not right amen it's like when you sisters when you clean the window you think it looks good I clean that window it's nice and clean and it looks good until the sunlight hits it and then you recognize all the places that got missed the floor looks real good when you sweep it and you think it looks good until the light comes in and you realize all the filth that's still in the floor oh come on somebody tonight y'all ain't mad cuz we missing a Super [Music] Bowl this my Super Bowl right here Saints amen all right maybe they'll flash some score updates or something but it looks good until the light hits it the floor looks good the windows look good the air looks good you ever thought the air was clean your breathing and then you watch the sunlight come in and you see all the stuff floating in the air it's the light that draws it out and Saint the closer you get to God the more in your life you'll see that's not pleasing to him oh but that don't be condemned by that that's a blessing that God is showing you the things where you're lacking and the things you need to work on that's God dealing with us it's the light that does that and the more light that shines in your life the dirtier things look Hebrews the 12 chapter says our God is a consuming fire consuming brother Bram says and knoweth it not he said the higher you rise in God the more sinful the whole thing looks and he says and then sometimes in prayer you can imagine when the Holy Spirit takes you up into a spear he said then the whole thing looks chaos the higher We rise in God the more sinful this world looks the more sinful Our Lives will look the more sinful our thoughts will be oh come on tonight Saints he says but if you ever climb into them Spears one time where you can be in the presence of God not through emotion but through some genuine Holy Spirit lifting up the whole thing is wrote ikabod the glory of the Lord has departed from the whole denomination outfit he said that's right there's none of them right now I want to preface this by saying Saints we do not condemn The Sinner we condemn the sin we always got to have a heart to see a sinner saved to see somebody lost that gets found to see somebody that's dying that gets saved that's always got to be in our heart we don't condemn The Sinner it's the sin that's in the world that we can't stand but if he saved you he can save anybody I don't ever want to get so high and lifted up that I can't help somebody down to the altar but don't let the devil beat you up about God's program Saints condemnation and repentance is God's provided way now I I get a little worried when people don't have condemnation when they live any kind of way and there's no condemnation on their life but Saints for those of us that the Lord is condemning thank you Lord he just he's dealing with us Saints he doesn't want us to continue down the path that we're going condemnation is a blessing it gives us an opportunity to make it right and repentance is God's program remember Cain couldn't repent so thank God we got the opportunity now acts 2:37 Peter had got up and preached to him and he preached hard and he told him that the Christ came and you crucified him you took his life you buried him but God raised him up and the Bible said they were pricked in their hearts and that means they they were they were cut to the heart they were cut they were pricked in the their hearts and they said to Peter and the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do and then Peter said unto them repent that's God's program repent is God's program and we're never above repentance we're never so high and mighty that we can't repent repent and be baptized every one of you for the in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now brother br said in Hebrews chapter 7 part two he said the believer can't sin the believer can't sin he said the seed of God the blessings of God remains on him now you say well brother George if a Believer can't sin why do we need to repent then well brother BR says God can't see nothing but the blood of his own son no matter what is in his church what it is God don't see it because Jesus is making intercessions constantly the high priest see you might see the sin but God don't see it you can see all my faults you can see all of my failures but God is looking through the blood of Jesus Christ amen and he says now if you say well that gives me a good chance he said then that shows you're not right see no believer would want to take advantage of that no believer would would feel great thinking well I can't do nothing wrong I can live any way I want to no he said that shows you never had it to begin with a real believer is thankful and grateful that God provided that way for him he said you'll appreciate it you'll love it if you're a real Christian to a place that sin would haunt you till you couldn't do it he said amen once purged by the blood of Jesus has no more to desire to sin he said if you have a desire your heart's not right with God this a part I love right here he says now you will do wrong you will do wrong but you don't do it willfully see you're trapped and anything that you're trapped into or do something that you don't mean to do it's not sin yet you'll repent the minute you see that you're wrong now Saints the devil has a way of putting a thought in your mind and making you think you had it he'll he'll tempt you to do something and when you do it he'll blame you for doing it but brother Brown said that's not you're trapped into that that's not sin yet you'll repent the minute you done wrong oh that's shouting material right there Saints amen he says you'll turn quickly and say I didn't mean I see he said you'll say that all through life all through life he said you'll say that well I what if I've been in the message 20 years all through life you'll say it what about 40 years in the message all through life you'll say it if I live another hundred years I'm GNA say that you'll repent the minute you see that you're wrong amen he says a man don't want to be and that's the reason we're so stupid and so in the dark down here on Earth that there's a blood atonement for us all the time to keep us covered see it's a light that's shining in the darkness that's calling out to sin in our lives and bringing about repentance this is God's program brother Kim this is God's plan Amen to call out the sin to call out the sick to call out the the dark places in our life and bring us to repentance he said now there's your legalist idea that says oh you know what the woman that woman was Sanctified but bless God she done wrong I know she blacks slid he said she that's a legalist idea to say they done wrong I know they backslid he said that's wrong she's not backslid she made a mistake if she did it willfully then she wasn't right to begin with if she didn't mean to do it and she walks before the Holy Church of God and confesses it and say I'm wrong and you forgive me you are Duty bound to do it so if somebody ask for forgiveness he said we are Duty bound to forgive them he says if you don't do it in your heart then you ought to went to the altar yourself true there is a real Holiness in the church there is genuine Holiness the Holiness not of you but of Christ I have no Holiness to present to him I'm trusting in his oh his grace and I have it in my heart and I've unmar it nothing I do to deserve it but by the grace he called me and invited me to come the prophet said I make thousands of mistakes each month each year surely I do but when I say I'm wrong I say God I didn't mean to do it you know my heart I didn't mean to do that I was trapped into that I don't mean to do it you forgive me Lord I done wrong to my brother I say brother forgive me I didn't mean to do that there's a blood sacrifice there's the power of the Gospel that Holy Church moving on not because something you done it's something you had nothing to do with there's the atonement is said oh Saints we're not holy because of our good works we're holy because an atonement was made and I'm not sinless because of my good works I'm sinless because I told him it was made because of repentance because of making it right because of forgiveness because of Grace oh we're right tonight by Grace by the [Music] blood oh God there's an atonement laying there and when we make a mistake we run quickly to make it right it's not sin yet it's a mistake because of an atonement laying there it's a life of daily repentance you can't just clean the house once in 1974 you got to clean it every day you can't just wash the dishes once in 92 and think you're good you got to wash them dishes every day you can't just work in the same set of clothes every day and never wash them you say well I washed them two months ago they'll get dirty again Saints the dishes get dirty again the house gets dirty again you got to sweep that floor every dayen and after Paul became a Christian after Paul saw the lights he said I Die daily so repentance is always the program of God We're Never Getting Beyond it I don't want to get Beyond it I want to be right I Want to Be Right better than I want to look good I'd rather be right than I would be proud I'd rather get it right and know that my heart's rights than to be worry about what everybody thinks about me amen too many people are ashamed to come to the altar ashamed to pour their heart out ashamed to make it right they're scared of what people think about them there a whole lot of preachers need to be at the altar but they're scared of what people think about them saints repentance is is God's program yes sir we're never above it we're never too proud of it look sa there was a little woman that had an issue of blood 12 years and she couldn't get no better and she finally said I got to do something different and she said I got to get to Jesus I got to get to Jesus and she said if I can just touch the Hy that you can't stand up tall and touch the H you got to get down on your knees you got to get down low to Touch the Hem of His garments you can't stand up and say oh praise God I'm a message believer God's blessed me above everybody else you got to get down low but she said if I can just Touch the Hem of His Garment I'll be made whole and when she touched it Saints Jesus felt it because she came to him with the right attitude with the right heart is that right Saints that was a blind man named barus and he heard that Jesus was passing by and he shouted out have mercy on me son of David have mercy on me son of David and they said barname is quiet down don't make so much noise don't get so wound up and he shouted the more have mercy on me SUNY day I'm so glad today saints that we got the ability to cry out to him have mercy on me yes sir I'm struggling Lord have mercy on me I'm fighting Lord have mercy on me I got bad thoughts Lord have mercy on me I need a touch from you have mercy on me I need healing have mercy on me I'm fighting all kinds of battles I got anxiety I got depression I got all kinds of mental battles have mercy on me and if somebody tries to quieten you down cry out the more yes oh you don't need to go down there what's people going to think if you go down there what's people going to think they're going to think you're a sinner well sa we was all Sinners ain't none of us good not one but by the mercy of Jesus Christ and the grace of almighty God we can be perfect so the condemnation is not a sign that you aren't a Believer but a work of the holy spirit in your life life oh come on somebody see Angels can't Worship the Lord the way he wants to be worshiped because inside of him was the attributes to be a Healer well an angel ain't never been sick inside of him was the attribute to be a savior but an angel never was lost inside of him was an attribute to be a provider was an attribute to give you peace was an you know the SC compel Redemptive names was an attribute to provide your needs well an angel didn't need nothing but we are the only ones the redeemed are the only ones that can worship God in his attributes that can worship God the way he wants to be worshiped I'm you're the only one that can say thank you Lord for saving me an angel can't save that you're the only one that can say thank you Lord for my healing thank you Lord for my Deliverance thank you Lord for providing for my needs you're the only one can do it it's a song Holy Angels can't sing Jehovah Gyra he says now you're talking about somewhere that you think you've done something that you can't get back to God he says look at Abraham out there look what he done lying about his wife now Saints if you've gone too far you don't have a feeling to try to get back to God if you have a desire to get closer to God then it shows God is still dealing with you he said blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled now when you go past the point of being redeemable it's like that little woman that said I could watch my mama's soul frying hell like a pancake and laugh about it but as long as God's still dealing with you as long as God is still condemning you as long as he's still working on you as long as he's still showing you where you need to step up showing you the things where you're fallen short you can say thank you Lord thank you Lord I'm looking for Perfection amen we all do brother Rick he said he said setting up on one side he said talk about Abraham said he was backslid and he said any Jew that goes out of Palestine is backslid and he says amalec might have been a good Holiness man for all I know but God said I'll not answer your prayer but my husband uh that husband of hers is my Prophet God told Amil you ain't done nothing wrong but I still won't hear your prayer because the seed of God lays inside of Abraham that husband of hers he said is my prophet and if you don't take him his wife back and let him pray for you you're as good as a dead man that's what it means for you and I that the seed of God remains in us he said that's God keeping his promise to the Seed of Abraham can you see healing is yours salvation is your yours it's a free gift of God that God gave you and called you and chose you before the foundation of the world he chose you you're his air oh aren't you thankful tonight Saints he says you say but brother brandom I made a mistake last week or last month I don't care how many mistakes you make we've all sinned and come short of the glory if you're a child of Abraham you're ready to recognize that as Sin and come back to God again and God's mercy still hangs to you oh so grateful for his Mercy see the message can't be done to you it's got to live through you you can't do the message to somebody you can't force them into a box and make them live the message and make them it's just a book of rules to them it can't be done to them it's got to live through them when they get the light on the inside the light is the life and the light will produce the life on the inside and then it ain't done to them it's living through them now if you got children you got to be their Holy Ghost until they get it yourself is that right now we don't preach the Holy Ghost like it's a one-time occurrence you can't say well praise God the Holy Ghost blessed me back in 1970 we're talking about baptism after baptism we're talking about one light after another light after another light after another light sa every time we come to the house of the Lord we ought to be feeling the presence of the Holy Ghost in our life and the Holy Ghost is what calls out the dark places now in the Old Testament the Mana fell fresh every day now that's that's a type of the word it's like when the word's Fallen today and when it does we get blessed are you blessed by the word Saints the word is a blessing and when a word is being preached it blesses the people like the man of Fallen but brother Brown said that that they they got that blessing but then long about 9 or 10:00 that that the Mana was dried up and they started getting hungry again and Saints you can have a good service in the morning but but but Along by evening time you ought to be getting hungry again you can have a good service Wednesday but by Sunday you ought to be looking for another good service by by Sunday night by Wednesday night by Sunday Morning by Sunday night we ought to be looking for another re feeling now is that right he said but when that Mana was put into the Ark of the Covenant inside the holiest of holies it never got old it never ran out Jehovah Gyra he said so many people think today because they have received the Holy Ghost that settles it when you receive the Holy Ghost you're just getting started Saints you're just getting ready for service but they don't settle it that's not the end of it there's more of it there's more of God than what we have there's more of God than what we know right now there's more of God for do you Hunger for More Of God faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of who's got a favorite food in here all right brother Warren what's your favorite food steak oh God me too it's man after my own heart right there here now if you've ever had a longing for a big old fine steak the longing that you have is the evidence that there is a stake to respond let let me say it like this you couldn't want a stake unless there was a stake somewhere to respond for that I don't they don't get it brother Israel all right all right so let's say fried chicken let's say that you got a longing for a piece of fried chicken the longing that you have for fried chicken is what proves that there is a fried chicken because you can't want something that don't exist if there wasn't no Fried Chicken then you wouldn't know what she missing oh but once you taste it one time you say I got to have some more of it and faith is the substance of thing hoped for and the evidence of Things Not Seen so if you have a desire in your heart tonight for more of God it's the evidence that there is a God and He does exist and he's a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him faith is a substance faith is an Evidence the reason I know there's more God is because I have a desire for more of God it's it's the Deep calling to the deep I like steak butter and fried chicken brother War but I like fried chicken too he said you just beginning you haven't started yet hardly he said the people picked up this little Mana which was the type of the Holy Spirit Christ he said they come down and give his life for the world and they took this and made it into cakes and eat it but many time they found out by 9 or 10:00 they were getting hungry and he said that's the way many people think today in a great big Revival they come all pepped up you know and as soon as the Revival's over down they go again have to come back and maybe repent again and come back to church and take their vows over and some of them wants to be re-baptized again or something like that some religious service to be done to them to try to boost them along he said those people are never happy see we know people like this Saints we've seen this over the years people that can make it from revival to Revival they go from Mountain toop to Mountaintop but between the mountain tops they're so low they barely make it in on two wheels and I believe in revivals I believe in Holy Ghost services but you can't live on the mountain toop you got to learn how to make it in the valley if you're just relying on the mountain top he said those people are never happy got to make it from camp meeting to camp meeting he says but the man who goes on the inside where this golden Mana part of Mana was he it'll never run out it never got old it never diminished the man who lived there had Victory all the time is that what you're looking for tonight Saints I don't want to be up and down in and out praising the Lord one minute and then I can't hardly make it to church the next I'm discouraged this time I'm encouraged this time then I'm discouraged again that's never a way to be happy but I'm looking for a s solid daily life then he talks about the light he said watch the different light he said the people out in the courts they walked by the sunlight and he says the trouble with that was he says they walk by the Sunlight Moonlight Stars he said that light that the solar system give he says well in there sometimes they had dark days cloudy days rainy days and he Likens that to justification and he said then he said there's a man who lived in the Holy place by the altar he said that's sanctification he said he said at the altar represents sanctification he said there they had light they didn't have to depend on the sun and the moon and the stars they had the seven candlesticks that gave them light see there was in the church ages then they had the seven candlesticks that gave them light he said but many times they smoked up and went out that's why it's not good enough to say I know God sent a prophet that that's that you're just living by the candlesticks and they can get smoked up of course God sent a prophet but it's not good enough to say I I believe the message is true of course the message is true but Satan knows this message is true he says but when they went into the holiest of holies those veils Dro behind Aaron once a year and they didn't have live by no Moonlight Starlight or seven golden candlesticks under the interlocking wings of the cherubin the shakina glory was in there and they lived in that light which never did diminish or go out they lived by the pot of Mana that they could eat at any time they wanted to it never got hold old Saints it don't matter whether I got church tonight or not I can still live by the Mana it don't matter if I'm going to be in service or not I can still eat of the Mana anytime I want I got it on my phone I got it in this Bible I got it on tape and I'm living by it daily come on somebody it don't get old we can't wait from church service to church service to eat and when it's in the shakana glory it never gets old to you you don't ever get tired of it I heard a tape today I want to hear another one I've read my Bible today but I want to read it again I got a desire for more of it because it's in the Shak kind of Glory that quickens the words of my life and then it's not just words of a prophet or words on a tape or words in a Bible it's the living breathing word living in you working through you that's the Shak of Glory so justification it's it's not the evidence of the Holy Ghost it's a work of the Holy Ghost condemnation it's a work of the Holy Ghost sanctification it's a work of the Holy Ghost now none of them are evidences of it healing Deliverance love joy peace none of them are evidence of the Holy Ghost but they're all works of the Holy Ghost now is that right but it takes the shakina glory the prophet said to ripen this word and that's why people can't understand the message because they're just reading it off of paper and they can't understand the Bible because they're trying to read it like a dictionary but it takes the shakina glory to Quicken this word unveiling of God he said the shakina glory manifests him it brings forth the Word of Promise right out of you where's the word come from what did he say did it come from the Bible it come out of you you are the light that's the reason he had to Veil Moses face because in him was the word where was the word it was in Moses where's the word it's in you and he veils himself today in Earth and vessels with the shikina amen he says and it ripens the shoe bread that we Feast on it takes the Holy Ghost to ripen the shoe bread that we're feasting on and that's why some people can listen to the tape and can't get nothing out of it some people can read the Bible and can't get nothing out of it because it takes the shakina of Glory to ripen the shoe bread and that's what we're missing in the message today we got the word in head knowledge but we need the shakina glory to ripen the word he said that shakina Glory over the shoe bread kept it from spoiling amen once you get to shakina Glory it don't matter that the message was preached in 63 or 64 or 65 or 57 40 it it don't matter Saints because it don't get bad it don't get wiggle tails in it it don't spoil it's still the Living Word of God outside of the Shan Glory it's just a message of the prophet but inside the sh kind of Glory it's the words of life it's Hebrews 138 he talks about sunflower seeds that they got out of the Garners in Egypt he said in the days of Joseph 4,000 years ago he said put them in the Garner they planted them and they lived 4,000 year old sunflower seeds and they planted them and they live why he said they had life I don't care how long you've been going brother Rick when a light Struck it brought forth life there's a seed land in there now you might be 20 years old when you give your heart to the Lord might be 12 years old when you give your heart to the Lord might be 70 years old when you give your heart to the Lord it don't matter when the light strikes it don't matter how long the seed's been laying there when the Shak of Glory strikes the seed it brings forth life he said to break Beyond the Veil to see God Is Standing before you see who God is standing here before us he said the pillar of fire he is veiled in human flesh he said but what does the Shak glor what it do he said the shoe breed seed the word that we're to live on this day by these promises the shakana glory ripens that shoe bread oh do you believe that today it brings it to pass makes it bread to the believer that laid in the pages of the Bible year after year the word for this age see Saints brother brandham didn't bring no words that wasn't already in the Bible amen he just brought the revelation of it it Ren the word that was already there the Bible hasn't changed changed but the Shak Glory brought it to life in our day so we don't want to leave the Bible laying on the table we want the Bible to get inside of us we want to place the Bible in the holiest of holies fill with the shikina glory and see that it's Hebrews 138 because the light is the life the Living Word it's the Supreme deity of of the Lord Jesus Christ brother Bram said that the Supreme deity of the Lord Jesus Christ was the greatest of all Revelation and I used to think that that meant Jesus was God well sure Jesus was God but that's not the Supreme deity Saints the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ is Jesus Christ in all Jesus Christ in Paul Jesus Christ in Moses Jes Jesus Christ in brother brandom and Jesus Christ in you the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ controls all things Works through you Works through me to accomplish his purpose do y'all believe that tonight amen as the musicians come I'm so grateful today Saints to live in the presence of the Living Word ripened by the shikina glory and to see that word manifested made known working through the Believers Saints I've tested the message and what the message says is the truth what it says it'll do it does you love him tonight can we bow our heads Lord Jesus we're so grateful tonight Lord that we're in the presence of the shik of glory Lord that your spirit ripens this word brings it to pass Lord lives through us and father I just pray Lord that you speak to every heart tonight Lord Lord I ask oh God you keep revealing to us where we're falling short keep revealing to us the things we need to make right Lord that condemnation we don't look at it as a bad thing but Lord an opportunity to make right what needs to be made right so that we might get back into the presence of God that we might be forgiven of what we need to be forgiven of that we might forgive those that need forgiving Lord that we might be back into your presence father we just thank you for that that Lord and Lord how the devil would beat us up and make us think we're not good enough or we're not smart enough or we don't know enough oh but it's just the light shining that's calling out the dark places in our lives and Lord it's our desire to be perfect so Lord you just pray that you just keep on doing it Lord keep on showing us and we'll keep on walking we want to stay in step Lord we thank you Father for this opportunity to come together we thank you for this church Lord the church isn't the building but it's the people and Lord but we thank you for the building also we thank you for providing a new building but Lord God most importantly Lord we want to live Lord these Tabernacle these bodies of ours Lord we want them to

what I [Music] meant amen I sometimes I feel pretty bad about myself I know we all do but I'm thankful that there's something in me to feel bad something in me that wants to be right that that that has a hunger and a thirst to be righteous amen God don't ever let me get so proud think I know so much that I can't humble myself to fall down at an altar that I can't humble myself to talk to somebody about the Lord that I can't humble myself to to to ask forgiveness that I can't humble myself to forgive others is that your desire tonight God bless you Saints as I turn the service back over brother [Music] amen let's give the Lord a hand of Praise amen thank God for his word tonight thank God for the light Jesus is the light of the world Amen let's all stand to our feet so good to

everything over and over and over and over again again again amen we'll bow our heads for a word of prayer I many appreciated that word tonight thank God that there is a condemnation or the word conviction that the Lord would bring to you he doesn't condemn you to where you can't make it back but he will convict you and that is a blessing it's the grace of God God that puts conviction over your heart and in your life so that you can go make it right there's many people don't care brother Banner made the statement there's some people that don't care but then there's some people they don't want to do wrong and they're push to do it but then but God makes a way for those kind of people that want to do what's right and I believe that a True Believer wants to do what's right Amen brother Joel come forward yes yes yes amen and we've been convicted by his word amen I can't hardly pick up a tape where it catches me somewhere I remember when I gave my heart to the Lord come forward brother Ben uh you may be seated just for a moment he'll share something I remember I was coming to the Lord and I thought if I could just get over this man everything could be all right but then I'm still 30 40 years later still just getting over this and that and as you get closer to him you'll see how much more you want to live for him our brother Ben God bless you God bless you all

a a relay race we've been given the Baton we have we're the anchor where God's best the fastest to finish the race Lord help us he said when the bride realizes who she is she'll be invincible so we
