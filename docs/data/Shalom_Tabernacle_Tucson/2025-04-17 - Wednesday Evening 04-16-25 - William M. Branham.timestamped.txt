[0:00] Christ Jesus paid the debt. Let's all
[0:04] sing and stand. We'll sing that one more
[0:08] time. He paid a debt. You did not own. I
[0:15] owe a
[0:16] debt could not pay. I needed
[0:22] someone to wash my sins away.
[0:29] And now I sing a brand new song. Amazing
[0:36] grace all day long. Christ Jesus paid a
[0:42] debt that I could never
[0:47] [Music]
[0:50] pay. God bless you all. It's good to see
[0:52] everyone this evening. like to welcome
[0:55] all those who are here, any of those who
[0:56] will be streaming, any visitors. Like to
[0:59] ask if our brother Lazy could open up
[1:01] this service with a word of
[1:04] prayer. Thank you, Lord
[1:07] Jesus, for that you give us a desire to
[1:11] come to your house to worship you and
[1:15] fellowship. Bless the
[1:17] musicians and their brothers and
[1:20] sisters.
[1:22] bless us this evening. That's
[1:25] my my
[1:27] prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen.
[1:32] Amen. It's an honor to be amongst you
[1:35] all once more at this meeting. But as
[1:38] much as I was looking forward to this
[1:39] meeting, there's a meeting in the air
[1:40] that I'm looking forward to even more.
[1:43] Let's sing that. Amen.
[1:48] You have heard of little Moses in the
[1:52] borage. And you have heard of fearless
[1:56] David and his
[1:58] sling. You have heard the story told of
[2:02] dreaming
[2:04] Joseph and of Jonah and the whale you
[2:08] often sing.
[2:12] There are many many others through the
[2:17] Bible. I should like to meet them all. I
[2:21] do
[2:23] declare by and by the Lord will surely
[2:27] let us meet
[2:29] them at that
[2:31] meeting in the air.
[2:36] Oh, there is going to be a meeting in
[2:41] the air in the sweet sweet by and
[2:47] by. I am going to meet you, meet you
[2:53] over there in that home beyond the sky.
[3:01] Such singing you will hear never heard
[3:05] by mortal ears will be glorious I do
[3:12] declare and God's own son will be the
[3:17] leading one at that
[3:21] meeting in the many things will there be
[3:25] missing many things will there be
[3:27] missing at that
[3:30] eating for the mourers's will have
[3:34] no place at
[3:37] all. There will never be a sermon
[3:41] preached to
[3:43] sinners. For the sinner had refused to
[3:47] heed the
[3:49] call. There will be no mourning over
[3:53] wayward love.
[3:56] There will be no lonely nights of
[3:59] pleading
[4:01] prayer. All our burdens and our anguish
[4:05] will be
[4:07] lifted at that meeting in the air.
[4:14] Oh, there is going to be a meeting in
[4:19] the air in the sweet sweet by and
[4:26] by. I am going to meet you, greet you
[4:32] over there in that home beyond the
[4:38] sky. And the singing you will hear
[4:42] never. Oh, it'll be so beautiful. It'll
[4:46] be glorious, I do
[4:51] declare. And God's own son will be the
[4:56] leading one at that
[4:59] meeting in one more time with all your
[5:02] heart.
[5:03] Oh, there is going to be a meeting in
[5:09] the air in the sweet sweet by and
[5:15] by. I am going to meet you, greet you
[5:21] over there in that home beyond the sky.
[5:29] Such singing you will hear never heard
[5:33] by mortal ear will be glorious I do
[5:40] declare and God's own son will be the
[5:46] leading one at that
[5:49] meeting and God's own
[5:53] son and God's own son will be the
[5:58] leading one at that
[6:01] meeting in the
[6:04] air. Amen. Let's praise the
[6:08] [Applause]
[6:10] Lord. You may be
[6:12] seated. It's good to see Brother Edward
[6:15] and Sister Bethany. Missed you guys. God
[6:18] bless you.
[6:25] [Music]
[6:27] Father, I see that you are
[6:30] drawing a line in the sand. And I want
[6:35] to be standing on your
[6:38] side, holding your hand. So let your
[6:43] kingom come. Let it live in me. This is
[6:50] my
[6:52] prayer. This is my plea. Let the
[6:56] worshippers
[7:02] arise. Let the sons and the daughters
[7:09] sing. I'm surrendering my all.
[7:17] Oh, I surrender to the king. Let the
[7:22] worshippers, let the worshippers rise.
[7:25] Let the worippers
[7:29] [Music]
[7:31] arise. Let the sons and the daughters
[7:34] sing.
[7:40] I'm surrendering my
[7:46] all. I surrender to the
[7:50] king. Let's take that second
[7:55] verse. Father, I hear it growing louder.
[8:00] Song of your
[8:03] redeem. As the saints of every
[8:07] nation are awakening to
[8:10] sing from our heart that comes and
[8:14] love hear the heavens ring. This is our
[8:20] song. Song to our king.
[8:24] Let the worshippers
[8:31] arise. Let the sons and the daughters
[8:35] [Music]
[8:38] sing. I'm surrendering my heart.
[8:44] [Music]
[8:47] I surrender to the
[8:50] [Music]
[8:53] king. Let the worshippers
[9:00] arise. Let the sons and the daughters
[9:04] sing.
[9:09] I'm surrendering my
[9:13] [Music]
[9:15] all. I surrender to the
[9:23] king. We've been made more than
[9:30] coner,
[9:32] overcomers in this life.
[9:38] We've been
[9:40] made
[9:45] victorious through the blood of Jesus
[9:49] [Music]
[9:52] Christ. We've been
[9:55] made
[9:59] coner
[10:01] overcomers in this life.
[10:08] We've been made
[10:14] victorious through the blood of Jesus
[10:22] Christ. We've been made more than
[10:29] coner,
[10:31] overcomers in this life. We are
[10:34] overcomers today.
[10:37] We've been
[10:39] made
[10:40] [Music]
[10:43] victorious through the blood of Jesus.
[10:47] One more time with all your heart. Sing
[10:50] it to him
[10:51] tonight. We've been made more than
[10:59] coner
[11:00] overs in this life.
[11:04] In this life, we've been
[11:08] made
[11:09] [Music]
[11:13] victorious through the blood of Jesus
[11:21] Christ. Let's go to the key of
[11:27] Eflat. Think about his love.
[11:33] Think about his
[11:37] [Laughter]
[11:39] goodness. Think about his
[11:43] [Music]
[11:44] grace that's brought us through.
[11:52] For as high as the heavens
[11:58] above, so great is the
[12:02] measure of our Father's
[12:11] love. Great is the
[12:14] measure of our Father's love.
[12:23] Think about his
[12:28] love. Think about his
[12:31] [Music]
[12:34] goodness. Think about his
[12:40] grace that's brought us through.
[12:48] For as high as the heavens
[12:53] above, so great is the
[12:57] measure of our Father's
[13:06] love. Great is the
[13:09] measure of our
[13:12] Father's love.
[13:18] [Music]
[13:20] All hail King
[13:27] Jesus. All
[13:29] hail
[13:30] [Music]
[13:35] Emmanuel. King of
[13:39] kings. Lord of lords.
[13:43] bright morning
[13:50] star and through out
[13:55] [Music]
[13:57] eternity I'm going to
[14:00] praise
[14:04] him and
[14:07] forever
[14:09] more I will reign.
[14:14] with
[14:15] him with all your
[14:18] heart. All hail King
[14:21] [Music]
[14:25] Jesus. All
[14:27] hail Emmanuel.
[14:33] He's the king of
[14:37] kings, lord of
[14:40] lords, bright morning
[14:44] [Music]
[14:48] star. And throughout
[14:53] [Music]
[14:55] eternity, I'm going to
[14:58] praise him.
[15:03] And
[15:06] forever
[15:08] more I will reign with him.
[15:16] [Music]
[15:23] give.
[15:25] I want to be more like
[15:29] you,
[15:31] Jesus.
[15:33] I want to be more like
[15:39] you. I want to be a vessel that you work
[15:43] through.
[15:45] I want to be more like
[15:51] you.
[15:53] I want to be more like
[15:58] you,
[16:00] Jesus.
[16:02] I want to be more like
[16:07] you. I want to be a vessel that you work
[16:11] through.
[16:14] I want to be more like you. One more
[16:20] time.
[16:22] I want to be more like
[16:26] you. Is that your testimony
[16:29] tonight? To be like the
[16:35] master. I want to be a vessel that you
[16:39] work through.
[16:42] I want to be more like
[16:45] [Music]
[16:47] you. Where would I
[16:51] be? You only
[16:55] know. I'm glad you
[16:59] see through eyes of
[17:03] love. A hopeless
[17:07] case, an empty
[17:11] place, if not for grace. Let's all
[17:15] stand. Amazing
[17:19] grace, how sweet the
[17:22] [Music]
[17:23] sound. I once was
[17:27] lost, but now I'm
[17:30] [Music]
[17:31] found. A hopeless
[17:36] case, an empty
[17:40] place if not for
[17:44] grace. Precious
[17:48] Lord, please take my
[17:52] hand and lead me
[17:56] on and help me stand.
[18:01] A hopeless
[18:04] case, an empty
[18:08] place. If not for
[18:12] grace, where would I
[18:16] be? You only
[18:20] know. I'm glad you
[18:24] see through eyes of
[18:28] love. A hopeless
[18:32] case, an empty
[18:36] place. If not for Let's sing one more
[18:39] time to him. Where would I
[18:44] be? He only
[18:48] knows. I'm glad you
[18:52] see through eyes of love.
[18:57] a hopeless
[19:00] case. If
[19:04] not, if not for
[19:07] grace, I was a hopeless
[19:12] case, an empty
[19:16] place if not for grace.
[19:21] [Music]
[19:24] Praise the Lord tonight. hopeless case
[19:27] you're looking at, but by the grace of
[19:29] God, so thankful to be in church
[19:31] tonight, Brother Edward, Sister Bethany,
[19:33] we sure been missing you. And just love
[19:36] to have you back and you heard the call
[19:39] and answered the call and as as Trevor
[19:42] was singing, you know, I want to answer
[19:44] the call as the Lord, you know, you look
[19:46] at your life and I have to go to work
[19:47] and I have to do this, but if he was
[19:49] called to call me to do something
[19:50] different, Brother Scott, whatever it
[19:52] is, I want to be receptive and respond
[19:55] to that call tonight. And I was a little
[19:57] worried I'd maybe be uh worshiping with
[20:00] just a few tonight. Even I sometimes the
[20:02] pastor not going to be here. Maybe I
[20:04] want to take the night off or so. But
[20:06] we're not doing this for the pastor. But
[20:08] we're going to hear from heaven tonight.
[20:09] I don't really believe that. And just a
[20:11] few things during a song service really
[20:13] touched me. Just little things that were
[20:16] coincidental. Ordained before the
[20:17] foundation of the world. Brother Trevor
[20:19] used the word once more. You didn't
[20:21] catch that probably, but I did. We're
[20:23] listening to that tonight. So that was
[20:25] neat. and then going into these things
[20:26] of the Lord and the worship. I so
[20:29] enjoyed that with you. And that Romans
[20:33] 8 I wanted to read because he he did the
[20:37] the song there that had some of these
[20:39] words and he went into that that love
[20:41] and the redemption. And we'll just read
[20:43] a few of those scriptures in Romans 8
[20:46] before we go into once
[20:50] more. Romans
[20:53] 8:33, he was talking about being an
[20:55] overcomer tonight. Brother uh Trevor was
[20:58] singing about that and come home
[21:00] defeated, behind schedule, over budget,
[21:03] and all of these things. But by the
[21:05] grace of God, we're overcomers as he has
[21:08] told us
[21:09] tonight. 33 Romans 8:33 says, "Who,"
[21:13] maybe we read this
[21:15] together altogether. Romans 8:33, "Who
[21:19] shall lay anything to the charge of
[21:22] God's elect? It is God that
[21:25] justifieth. Who is he that condemnth? It
[21:29] is Christ that died, yay, rather, that
[21:33] is risen again, who is even at the right
[21:36] hand of God, who also maketh
[21:39] intercession for us. Who shall separate
[21:42] us from the love of Christ? Shall
[21:45] tribulation or distress or persecution
[21:49] or famine or nakedness or peril or
[21:53] sword? As it is written, for thy sake we
[21:56] are killed all the day long. We are
[21:59] accounted as sleep for the slaughter.
[22:02] Nay, in all these things we are more
[22:05] than conquerors through him that loved
[22:08] us. For I am persuaded that neither
[22:11] death nor life, nor angels, nor
[22:14] principalities, nor powers, nor things
[22:17] present, nor things to come, nor height,
[22:20] nor depth, nor any other creature, shall
[22:23] be able to separate us from the love of
[22:26] God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[22:30] And the people say, "Amen." Brother
[22:32] John, I think that covered it all. And
[22:34] I'm a conqueror through Christ Jesus.
[22:36] And he went into the love after that. So
[22:38] appreciate being able to worship with
[22:39] you tonight, Brother Trevor. Our young
[22:42] people always do a fine job and just
[22:45] love to be able to sing and worship with
[22:48] you kind of behind them. So uh welcome.
[22:51] God bless you. And we'll go right into
[22:52] the once more tape. We'll do a portion
[22:54] of this God willing tonight and then
[22:57] next Wednesday do our normal prayer
[22:59] meeting and remember those things. So be
[23:02] thinking of something you might mention
[23:04] to the church or unspoken. We'll do that
[23:06] in a moment. Um but only believe all
[23:08] things are
[23:13] possible.
[23:15] Only
[23:18] believe,
[23:20] only
[23:23] believe, all things are
[23:28] possible.
[23:30] Only believe.
[23:35] Only
[23:38] believe.
[23:39] Only
[23:43] believe. All things are
[23:47] possible.
[23:50] Only I believe. So all things are
[23:53] possible.
[23:54] Lord, I
[23:56] believe. Yes.
[23:59] Lord, I believe.
[24:03] All things are
[24:07] possible. Lord, I
[24:12] believe.
[24:14] Lord, I
[24:17] believe.
[24:19] Lord, I
[24:22] believe. All things are
[24:27] possible. Yay. Lord, I believe.
[24:34] Stay standing and brother Brandham will
[24:36] seat us. God bless
[24:43] you. We are assembled again in the name
[24:48] of thy beloved child, the Lord Jesus, to
[24:52] express our love and worship to him.
[24:55] Again, we pray that his spirit will meet
[24:58] with us. Yes. and that he will give us
[25:01] each a portion of that spirit that might
[25:04] give us sustaining grace to finish the
[25:07] journey and fight the fight that's set
[25:09] before us, the fight of faith. Grant it,
[25:12] Father, and break to us this afternoon
[25:14] the bread of life to strengthen us. For
[25:16] it is written, "Man shall not live by
[25:18] bread alone, but by every word that
[25:21] proceedth from the mouth of God." May we
[25:24] hear that this afternoon in the name of
[25:27] Jesus Christ. Amen. You be
[25:32] seated. Commenting
[25:35] Brother Carlson, you just let me on
[25:38] about 10 minutes late. It's getting
[25:40] better. Another week's meeting would
[25:42] just I'd probably be here on
[25:44] time. We're so happy for the privilege.
[25:49] Now, tonight is our closing night of
[25:53] this certain service. And I want to let
[25:56] you out in time so you can have your
[25:59] your
[26:01] supper. I know a lot of you call it your
[26:03] dinner, but if I have dinner, then
[26:04] where's my supper coming from?
[26:07] Now, I was talking to a fellow. He said,
[26:10] "Oh, Brother Brandham, it's it's
[26:12] dinner." Well, it is. I said, "I want to
[26:15] prove you you're wrong." I said, 'We
[26:17] don't take the Lord's dinner. We take
[26:19] his
[26:21] supper. So we um we like to think of it
[26:25] as the Lord as our supper or the Lord's
[26:27] supper that night, not morning or
[26:30] afternoon. He he tucked it in the
[26:32] evening. It was his supper.
[26:35] Now, so we want to get back early and so
[26:39] we won't be late tonight. Brother
[26:41] Carlson's going to let me on just
[26:42] exactly on time. Faith is the substance
[26:46] of things hoped for.
[26:50] And
[26:51] um I don't know if the Lord willing, I
[26:54] might try to speak tonight if I get a
[26:56] little enough time on the
[26:59] countdown the for the it's a scientific
[27:02] little message the Lord's given me for
[27:04] the last days. And maybe the Lord
[27:06] willing I might be able to speak on that
[27:09] tonight. Now we had a grand time last
[27:12] night. kind of went over and said,
[27:13] "We're not going to pray for the sick
[27:15] and the Lord heal the sick anyhow."
[27:19] Sometimes we can say something, but the
[27:20] Lord can just upset that anytime he
[27:22] wants to. You see, he he's God. Now, I
[27:26] want to read quickly from the scriptures
[27:29] for a little text that I a thought that
[27:32] might be a help to us this afternoon.
[27:34] Now, if he let me on on time, I won't
[27:37] try to get out on time. And that would
[27:39] be about 4:30, which would be about 50
[27:43] minutes from now. Let us turn now over
[27:46] to the book of Judges, the 16th chapter,
[27:49] and let's read um the um 27th and 28th
[27:54] verses as we look to the
[27:59] word. Now the house was full of men and
[28:02] women, and all the lords of the
[28:04] Philistines were there. And there were
[28:07] upon the roof about 3,000 men and
[28:12] women. The whole while Samson made
[28:16] sport. And
[28:19] Samson called to the Lord and said, "Oh
[28:24] Lord, remember me, I pray thee, and
[28:29] strengthen me, I pray thee. Only this
[28:33] once, oh Lord, that I might be avenged
[28:38] of the Philistines for my two
[28:42] eyes. Let's pray again. Lord Jesus, take
[28:46] this little
[28:47] text,
[28:50] water the church with it. Lord, we pray
[28:54] and commit it to you in Jesus name.
[28:56] Amen.
[29:01] There must have been
[29:02] about
[29:04] 3,000 Philistines
[29:08] uh looking down from the top of the
[29:13] galley this great arena when the couple
[29:17] entered the arena that
[29:21] afternoon. Must have been a hot day.
[29:25] All day long they'd been out
[29:27] there and in this great company on top
[29:32] of this great arena that was built
[29:35] something on an order of a upside down
[29:38] mushroom and the center post in the
[29:41] middle that went out something in this
[29:43] way and held the two post holding all
[29:46] the spectators around.
[29:51] Highly polished
[29:53] warlords and their fine jeweled
[29:58] women all lean
[30:01] forward at this certain
[30:05] event for they wanted to get a good look
[30:10] that was taking
[30:12] place. There had been
[30:15] preliminaries all the entertainment.
[30:17] They probably had little monkeys that
[30:19] that played little
[30:21] tricks and they had uh different things
[30:25] that they entertained themselves with
[30:27] fighting, rrestling, and and and maybe
[30:31] dueling to death and many other things
[30:34] that that they had been entertained with
[30:37] all
[30:38] day for it was a great
[30:40] day. But now the main event come. You
[30:45] know how we all wait patiently while the
[30:48] preliminaries are going
[30:51] on and they wait for the the main
[30:54] event and that's when everybody sets up
[30:57] and takes
[30:59] notice. We watch it in our religious
[31:03] services of when we have our our singing
[31:08] and our
[31:09] testimonials and the preaching and so
[31:12] forth. But the main event is see what
[31:15] the Lord's going to do. See why he's
[31:18] gathered us together for. We're all
[31:20] under anticipations to see just what the
[31:25] end's going to be. The main event. It's
[31:27] that way in anything. We always watch
[31:30] for the main
[31:31] event. And they all raised up to look
[31:34] forward to see what was taking place
[31:37] because the main event was being brought
[31:40] to
[31:41] them. What did they see but a blind
[31:45] man being led by a little
[31:48] boy. The halls that echoed all afternoon
[31:52] with drunken
[31:54] revery. How that
[31:56] they pass the whiskey and their high
[31:59] drinks and their fine painted up and
[32:02] jeweled women and great dignified
[32:05] warlords and all. It was a great
[32:09] celebration. They were celebrating the
[32:12] victory. Oh, how I hate to say this.
[32:17] The victory that the fish god Dagen had
[32:20] got over the servant of
[32:23] God. It just goes plummed down at the
[32:26] bottom of me to have to say that. But
[32:28] it's
[32:30] truth. Celebrating such a way as that of
[32:33] victory over Jehovah's
[32:38] servant. What a shameful thing.
[32:42] drinking, raing, painted women and
[32:45] jeweled up and great dignitaries, the
[32:49] fires is burning under the fish god and
[32:52] what a celebration it must have
[32:55] been. But the heartbreaking part as
[32:58] thousands of years later that we have to
[33:01] think back of such an event as that and
[33:04] when the great God of
[33:07] heaven who had purposed in his
[33:10] heart to destroy that
[33:13] nation because they were
[33:16] heathens and had sent a man to do the
[33:20] job. And here the fish god idol was
[33:24] celebrating a victory over Jehovah's
[33:29] uh
[33:31] servant. Jehovah never lost. The servant
[33:35] that he sent to do it lost the
[33:39] victory. What a
[33:41] sight. What a shameful thing it
[33:46] was. The lad led the stumbling blind man
[33:51] across the the hall to these big center
[33:57] post where on all the great upside down
[34:01] musherun or umbrella like set where the
[34:04] people look down like this from the
[34:06] great like pilasters run up and help the
[34:09] thing in order laid by stone that could
[34:12] not be reproduced again today. No one
[34:15] could build it like that.
[34:17] But what a great thing it was. And
[34:20] thousands of the
[34:22] celebrity priests who had served a idol
[34:28] with their chest all swelled
[34:31] out and all their ceremonies and rituals
[34:35] over their idle that he had conquered
[34:41] Jehovah. What a great day it was.
[34:44] drinking, reverying, and carrying on.
[34:46] And here comes Jehovah's
[34:49] servant,
[34:51] blind,
[34:53] stumbling, led by a little boy, out to
[34:57] this great
[34:59] post to make sport. The main event of
[35:04] entertainment was to make sport out of
[35:08] Jehovah's ordained purpose to destroy
[35:13] the nation. And yet the nation has taken
[35:16] the thing that God had placed in to
[35:19] destroy them. And now they had conquered
[35:21] him and was making sport out of him. The
[35:24] main event at their
[35:26] celebration. Doesn't that just kill you
[35:28] nearly to have to look at that?
[35:32] to think what could this story never
[35:36] really should have never had to be
[35:39] told but was probably told for for our
[35:43] admonition is wrote that way.
[35:49] humiliated,
[35:52] broken, standing now
[35:56] defeated right between the two posts
[35:59] that held the
[36:02] building. What a symbol that
[36:06] is of the church of this day.
[36:11] What a
[36:16] symbol that has sold out to the
[36:21] world and the very thing that we're here
[36:24] to conquer.
[36:27] The church that has sold
[36:29] its its
[36:32] moss, sold the
[36:35] Bible, sold its
[36:39] strength, soul surrendered its
[36:43] sword and standing
[36:47] humiliated in the hour when the
[36:49] approaching signs of the coming of Jesus
[36:51] Christ is at hand. when she ought to be
[36:55] washed, not a spot or a
[36:58] wrinkle, standing to receive her
[37:05] bridegroom. What a picture we see
[37:11] here. A symbol of
[37:13] moral
[37:15] decay that rest upon the nation, this
[37:19] nation. And I'm not going to try to stay
[37:22] with my scriptures too long so I can get
[37:24] through quick. But I could symbolize
[37:26] that with the church, with the nation,
[37:29] with politics, and with everything you
[37:31] can put your hands on today besides
[37:33] God's
[37:36] Bible. Morally
[37:38] decayed. The human race
[37:41] itself just in a terrible condition.
[37:46] And they're
[37:48] under
[37:50] atheists and
[37:53] unbelievers that can point their finger
[37:55] into the face of the church who should
[37:58] have the message for
[38:00] today and ask them, "What does all this
[38:03] mean?" And they don't have the
[38:06] answer. They don't have the
[38:11] answer. Wow. They did like Samson did.
[38:16] They've
[38:19] surrendered. So see him standing there
[38:21] and we'd say, "So this is
[38:27] Samson." Let's catch a picture of
[38:30] him. This great mighty
[38:35] warrior. Let's picture him this
[38:37] afternoon that he had wide shoulders,
[38:40] great framework. And here this big book
[38:44] of a man stands there
[38:47] blinded, tied with little strings and
[38:50] led to the middle of the floor,
[38:53] humiliated, broken,
[38:55] defeated with the great God of heaven
[38:58] looking down upon
[39:00] him. Down here is
[39:05] critics, drunken
[39:07] soldiers looking down.
[39:11] I'd imagine as he stood
[39:14] there, many Philistines had even shook
[39:18] in their shoes to hear his
[39:20] name. Samson was a mighty name one time.
[39:23] So was
[39:27] Christianity. The church
[39:30] was going to parallel it with the
[39:33] church. This
[39:35] scene
[39:37] Samson
[39:39] named people just
[39:41] fainted for he was some sort of a man
[39:45] that they had never seen a man like him.
[39:48] His strength was beyond anything that
[39:51] the world had ever had. There's nothing
[39:53] they had could match
[39:58] it. Many remember him as he looked on
[40:02] him standing there in that condition.
[40:04] Manny looked upon him from the galleys
[40:07] and remember seeing standing in another
[40:10] position one day standing with a
[40:14] jawbone of a mule in his hand with a
[40:17] thousand Philistines laying around him
[40:20] when they had fled to the rocks for
[40:22] safety standing motion his fingers. Come
[40:25] on if you want some of
[40:27] it. But now look at him.
[40:33] many of the Philistines that one night
[40:36] he was persuaded in by harlot and in the
[40:40] the city of Gaza. They took the great
[40:44] big gates that would weigh tons and
[40:47] fenced him in and caught him and sent
[40:50] out to the soldiers and said, "Now we've
[40:54] caught him. We've hemmed him
[40:57] in like the devil's always trying to do.
[41:01] Him you in on
[41:03] something. But remember when Samson
[41:06] awoke the next
[41:08] morning or that night rather seeing he
[41:12] was hemmed in, he could feel back on the
[41:15] back of his head and still know he was a
[41:17] covenant son of God. Amen.
[41:21] And there was nothing could he him in.
[41:25] The church once stood like that,
[41:29] too. What did he do? He rose up, walked
[41:34] down the street, pulled the gates out of
[41:37] its sockets, and put it up on his
[41:38] shoulders, and walked up the top of the
[41:40] hill and sat down.
[41:44] Many standing there that afternoon
[41:46] remember that event.
[41:48] But look at him now. Blinded,
[41:52] mocked, just a sport for the
[41:57] enemy. All his powers that he once had
[42:02] for his
[42:04] protection, for God's achievement that
[42:07] he had been born in the world to do had
[42:10] been stripped from him by a woman.
[42:17] I think that same thing could be applied
[42:22] today that a woman who pretends to be
[42:26] the bride of Christ
[42:28] uh and basing her teaching with a cup of
[42:32] the filthiness of her
[42:35] abominations of her fornications.
[42:38] She has tipped the cup of her
[42:42] fornications into the mouths of God's
[42:46] church been raised
[42:49] up to show his signs and wonders as
[42:53] Jesus last commandment was to do in Mark
[42:56] 16. And now we find that she has took
[43:01] God's little faithful group and
[43:04] organized them together just exactly the
[43:06] way she did herself. and got them
[43:09] standing stripped,
[43:13] denying the power thereof,
[43:17] denying the Holy Spirit, denying the
[43:20] power to speak with tongues, denying the
[43:23] power of of the Holy Spirit to raise the
[43:27] dead and heal the sick and cast out
[43:31] devils. And now the Philistines is up on
[43:34] thee. And what's he going to do now?
[43:40] strip all what must have went through
[43:44] that man's
[43:47] mind. We have seen what must have went
[43:50] through the Philistines
[43:52] mind. They didn't know when I've heard
[43:55] one reach over to another maybe say I
[43:58] remember the time when you say Samson
[44:01] every Philistine go like rats to a hole.
[44:05] I've heard the time they say a thousand
[44:07] men would be marching across the desert.
[44:10] They say Samson's coming. They'd drop
[44:12] their arms and run for safety as hard as
[44:14] he could. But now look at
[44:19] him. He's in a terrible condition, bound
[44:24] all because he compromised to a woman.
[44:29] That's what done it.
[44:32] She stripped him of his power.
[44:35] She kept trying to find out where his
[44:38] strength
[44:40] laid. She know he was a big man, but
[44:42] they had big man,
[44:44] too. But this
[44:47] Delila, she was a a real
[44:52] Jezebel. She knowed how to work on him
[44:55] to woo him to her and say that he she
[44:59] loved him. But all the time she was
[45:03] trying to fish along where his strength
[45:06] laden, that's the same thing that the
[45:09] Jezebel has done to the church.
[45:14] It's fished along until it's found out
[45:17] where the strength lead and it the
[45:20] strength is in the word. The word is
[45:23] God. Amen.
[45:26] And finally she found where that
[45:28] strength laid and she took him down to
[45:32] Na Rome and shaved off his locks.
[45:38] And now they've took what's left out of
[45:41] it and take them back to the World
[45:44] Council of Churches and got their locks
[45:46] shaved again.
[45:49] It's a constant
[45:51] shaving taking this out. This doesn't
[45:54] mean that in the days of miracles just
[45:56] passed. There is no such a thing as this
[45:58] that the other. They found where the
[46:01] strength went.
[46:04] Substituting baptisms and handshakes and
[46:07] all these other things for the true
[46:09] unadulterated word of God.
[46:12] This word is God that was given to his
[46:15] church to defeat the world and the
[46:18] devils and the sickness and to cast out
[46:20] devils and Amen.
[46:23] No denomination was given to the church.
[46:26] The word was given to the church. That's
[46:29] her strength.
[46:33] But they've cut this away. They cut that
[46:35] away and they shaved off this lock and
[46:37] shaved off that lock until she stands
[46:40] shoring today
[46:43] like a Catholic
[46:45] sister.
[46:47] Sure, until she's accepted a bunch of
[46:51] man-made creeds
[46:53] for her doctrine, just exactly what the
[46:56] prophet said she would do. And here she
[46:58] stands today
[47:02] humiliated when the God of heaven has
[47:05] chose the ignorant fisherman and so
[47:08] forth and has come down in that and
[47:11] proving it that he still remains God and
[47:15] they can't give an answer to their
[47:16] congregation for it because it's not
[47:19] connected with any denomination.
[47:24] and she stands humiliated where she
[47:27] ought to have been standing in her
[47:29] strength. If the church today stood like
[47:31] it did on the day of
[47:34] Pentecost. If the church today stood
[47:36] like it did in the days of
[47:38] Ireneius and in the days of St. Martin
[47:41] or in the days of Polocart where the
[47:44] church would march right into death
[47:46] before it would defy any word of God.
[47:53] Ireneius, Martin, all those men held
[47:56] tight to that water baptism in the name
[47:58] of Jesus Christ. Every one of them held
[48:01] tight to that baptism of the Holy Ghost
[48:03] with prophets, signs, and wonders. And
[48:06] they've got away from it today.
[48:09] What happened?
[48:12] Delilah and Node were the strength blade
[48:15] and if she could ever get those
[48:16] seminaries away from that word onto some
[48:19] man-made theology, she had it.
[48:23] Then it was easy to bind and lead them
[48:25] into the World Council of Churches.
[48:28] This economical council. You see, you
[48:30] ain't got no right. I'm still American
[48:32] citizen. I got a right to freedom of
[48:34] speech. That's right. Certainly is.
[48:37] Notice that's exactly the truth.
[48:42] Oh, how he must have felt what went
[48:45] through that man's mind as he stood
[48:49] there.
[48:51] Now, Jezebel knew, or not Jezebel, but
[48:54] Delilah knew if she could ever punch his
[48:58] eyes out, that was it.
[49:01] And that's exactly what Delilah of this
[49:04] last day has done to the church. Punch
[49:08] its eyes out to God's promise.
[49:11] and sold you to some great big
[49:12] intellectual
[49:14] denomination. Everybody likes to bl say,
[49:16] "I belong to the first church. I belong
[49:18] to down here." I see. As long as the
[49:21] devil can put your eyes out to the word
[49:24] of God and the promise of God, no matter
[49:27] how foolish it sounds, it's God's
[49:32] promise. I I'm not endorsing cults.
[49:37] Not at all. But them cults are known by
[49:40] their
[49:41] works. So is God's church known by its
[49:45] works. But I'm trying to say what
[49:49] Delilah has done to
[49:52] Samson. Now let's take Samson's side.
[49:56] What must have went through the man's
[49:58] mind as he stood
[50:01] there? All the great victories he had
[50:04] once had must have passed through his
[50:07] mind.
[50:08] The events on now the entertainment for
[50:11] the afternoon is fixing to
[50:14] start. The ones that's to be entertained
[50:17] are thinking of what he was. And here he
[50:21] is thinking are thinking of what he was.
[50:24] But because some woman lured him, the
[50:27] pictures changed to what it should
[50:30] been. God raised Samson up to destroy
[50:33] that nation.
[50:35] That was the very purpose of bringing
[50:37] him on. If God can only find one man,
[50:42] that's all he needs. One man that can
[50:46] fully surrender to him.
[50:49] He don't take an army. He never did use
[50:51] that. He only uses a man. Now, Samson
[50:56] gave God his strength to use, but he
[50:59] didn't give God his heart. He gave his
[51:02] heart to Goliath. and gave his strength
[51:05] to God. But you've got to surrender
[51:08] soul, body, spirit, spirit, everything
[51:12] you are to the will of God.
[51:15] Become a prisoner to him.
[51:19] You're going to be somebody's prisoner.
[51:21] That's right. You don't belong to
[51:23] yourself.
[51:28] You're somebody's prisoner. You're
[51:30] either a prisoner of the devil knowing
[51:33] this truth and won't surrender to it or
[51:34] a prisoner to to the world and surrender
[51:37] to God. One or the other. You're either
[51:39] devil's prisoner to sin or you're God's
[51:42] prisoner to righteousness.
[51:44] You're one of the
[51:46] other. And now Samson thinks of the
[51:50] great victories that he had won.
[51:53] No doubt it come to his
[51:56] mind. How that when he was a little boy
[51:58] that God had vindicated him, told his
[52:02] mother that how that she must uh uh do
[52:06] not drink strong drinks or or watch her
[52:09] diet that she was bringing forth a
[52:11] Nazerite. how she uh combed his hair and
[52:15] told him, "Son, through these locks,
[52:18] it's a covenant with God that your
[52:21] strength will lay in there. Don't never
[52:24] give it away. Don't never give away your
[52:27] secret. Don't never surrender it.
[52:30] Whatever you do, stay with it." Amen.
[52:34] Jesus Christ told the church that
[52:37] heavens and earth will pass away, but my
[52:41] word shall never pass away. Amen. And
[52:44] whosoever shall take one word from it or
[52:47] add one word to it, his part will be
[52:49] taken out of the book of life. Amen.
[52:54] The church ought to think of that now
[52:57] as we stand in this chaos and this hour.
[53:01] just prayer prior the coming of the Lord
[53:04] Jesus at any moment for a
[53:08] rapture. The great victories that we can
[53:10] point back in the days gone by and the
[53:14] reformation back in the days of Ireneius
[53:17] and St.
[53:19] Martin, Patrick and those who protested
[53:22] those
[53:24] organizations and when Luther came out
[53:27] and protested that first organization
[53:30] Catholic Church and the group that
[53:32] followed him come right back and
[53:33] organized behind him. When John Wesley
[53:36] come out of Anglicanism and the soon as
[53:40] Wesley left, they organize right behind
[53:43] him and the early Pentecost come out
[53:47] of the denominations.
[53:49] That was a cursed word to you. But as a
[53:52] dog goes to its bomb and a s to their
[53:56] wall, you went right back in the thing
[53:59] that you were born to defeat.
[54:04] Hallelujah. That hurts my heart too.
[54:08] Even more than to think of the victory
[54:10] honor that Dagon had over Samson. I see
[54:13] what Jezebel's got over the church.
[54:17] That's the reason every strength and
[54:20] ever fed my being. I'm trying time to
[54:22] protest that thing and call back that
[54:25] church to her place of repentance.
[54:29] Your mothers, your fathers were ousted
[54:32] out of those organizations.
[54:35] They come out of it and protested it.
[54:40] And here their children has turned right
[54:43] back around and went right back in the
[54:45] thing that they come out
[54:48] of. That ain't a picture of
[54:51] Samson. What Delilah
[54:54] did. how we ought to let the thoughts go
[54:56] through our mind of the great victories.
[54:59] I don't have time to get it and keep my
[55:01] word to
[55:15] you. And God's people say, "Amen." Maybe
[55:19] cut that a little short tonight. Hard to
[55:22] push pause on that one, but God willing,
[55:23] we'll we'll get the rest of it soon,
[55:25] Brother
[55:26] Chuck.
[55:28] So, let's uh remember their prayer
[55:31] requests tonight. We'll we'll give you
[55:34] plenty of time here with
[55:36] the We won't have to rush out. We can
[55:38] take some time and just pray for one
[55:40] another. Our precious brother Victor, he
[55:42] puts up a lot of circus nonsense at the
[55:44] house and we we bring them. We
[55:45] appreciate brother Vic you coming with
[55:48] us to church frequently and I know
[55:50] you've got a need on your heart. We just
[55:51] hold that up in faith believing for uh
[55:54] Victor Mickey there in the back. U a
[55:57] note to please remember
[56:00] um before we do that I'm getting ahead
[56:03] of myself. I get a little nervous up
[56:04] here. You forgive me think I wouldn't do
[56:06] that. But um I wanted to read a couple
[56:08] of these quotes that's full of nuggets.
[56:10] So if we could do that first and then
[56:11] we'll go to these prayer requests if you
[56:12] want to play something softly. Brother
[56:15] Brandon reminded us tonight, the
[56:16] strength is in maybe the one people, the
[56:19] young people can finish a couple of
[56:20] these sentences here, Timothy or
[56:23] someone. The strength is in the Where's
[56:28] the strength at
[56:30] Timothy? The strength is in the word and
[56:33] the word
[56:35] is God. Very powerful tonight. He said
[56:38] the word was gi to the church. That's
[56:41] her strength tonight. So, we have
[56:43] strength. We're made more than
[56:45] conquerors. This goes right along with
[56:46] what we were singing and reading
[56:48] earlier. And he reminds us to surrender
[56:51] everything you are to the will of God.
[56:54] If if they call you across the the
[56:57] United States, Brother Edward, to to do
[56:59] a work somewhere else, you just drop
[57:01] everything and you go do if if he calls
[57:03] you to Africa with brother Israel or
[57:05] these things, we want to just be
[57:07] responsive to the call. So just uphold
[57:10] these uh requests in in faith believing
[57:13] tonight for again brother Victor Mickey
[57:15] there in the back. A note to remember
[57:17] sister Ann, sister Ellie Troutman. She
[57:20] can't get out and and they would very
[57:22] much like to be here with us so badly.
[57:25] So remember them. I don't know if
[57:27] they're able to stream or anything, but
[57:29] we sure hold them up in prayer. We miss
[57:31] them. The Troutman's. A request for
[57:34] Michael
[57:36] Councilman Elizabeth
[57:39] Ericson husband is going to have in for
[57:42] emergency heart surgery even now. Did I
[57:44] get that right, Sister Barb? So
[57:46] certainly want to remember them.
[57:47] Everybody knows the Erikson family there
[57:50] in Jeffersonville and their ties here.
[57:53] So remember Michael
[57:56] Councilman. The Lord sure did a work for
[57:58] our precious sister Lori. She's been
[58:01] raised from the dead. She's doing much
[58:02] better, but a long way to go. And she
[58:04] has some rehab coming up. And the family
[58:07] requested some specific things there. I
[58:09] don't have them all written down, but we
[58:10] just trust the Lord to get her into
[58:12] rehab up there in Seattle and all that
[58:15] she has to go through. Brother Randy
[58:16] back here and uh things he's dealing
[58:19] with. So, and the family continue to
[58:21] hold up the snows. I like to tease her.
[58:24] We can't tease everybody, but Sister
[58:26] Rain, I call her. So, Sister Snow, Lori,
[58:28] we miss her and pray for the rehab
[58:30] there. Uh, we miss Brother
[58:32] Kim. He's giving me a big parking spot
[58:35] out here. And so I I told him that piece
[58:38] of junk. He got that out of here. So
[58:40] we're going to miss Brother Kim and
[58:42] Sister Hedi. I was kind of hoping he'd
[58:44] leave that piece of junk for me. But got
[58:46] a long road back to Canada. He's
[58:48] probably got more hours than any of us
[58:50] except for Aaron and brother Chuck. I
[58:52] think maybe there's some others, but we
[58:53] miss him and a big long road ahead. And
[58:56] he's one of those guys. He'll poke you a
[58:58] little bit and you just can't offend him
[59:00] and he does it in a way you just can't
[59:01] offend you. So I hope we're not
[59:02] offensive. I hope we're like that and I
[59:04] just pray that he'll have a safe trip.
[59:06] He's really a hero of the faith in my w
[59:08] mind. We watched the testimony. He's got
[59:11] another testimony and looking at his arm
[59:12] there the other day and he told the
[59:15] story of how it should have been cut
[59:16] off. He said when I wake up that arm
[59:18] better be attached I'm going to be real
[59:20] upset. He told a doctor and uh he said,
[59:22] "I just wanted to lay there if nothing
[59:24] else and the Lord will make that move
[59:27] and and it come out and it could barely
[59:28] move and it just the Lord worked in his
[59:30] life and ended a miracle there that that
[59:32] wasn't on the on the uh video that we
[59:35] watched." And so we're just thankful for
[59:36] that hero of faith and pray have a safe
[59:38] trip and Lord would bless him as he
[59:40] blessed us. Of course, we miss brother
[59:43] Israel tonight and doing the work of the
[59:45] Lord. And it's not all uh just easy. All
[59:48] that traveling. He's going across the
[59:50] country uh tonight of Africa and four
[59:54] layovers. If I got it right, and just a
[59:56] big long trip. I know he'll be a
[59:57] blessing, but time zones and different
[59:59] cultures and all the things. I just pray
[1:00:01] for him. Hold him up in your prayer
[1:00:03] life. He'll be a real blessing, I
[1:00:06] believe.
[1:00:07] So, what am I missing? Brother Chuck,
[1:00:10] Brother
[1:00:11] Levi, nothing there. Is there something
[1:00:13] you'd like to bring before the church
[1:00:15] saints out loud and
[1:00:17] mention? Is there anything we're we're
[1:00:19] missing? Yes. Little Chloe, you got
[1:00:20] something or you just want us to pray
[1:00:22] for you? Just pray for
[1:00:25] Chloe. It's good. We'll have faith with
[1:00:27] her. Maybe we'll stand and sing a
[1:00:31] song. There's some some folks missing.
[1:00:34] We miss our amen corner here, brother
[1:00:36] brother George and the missionary work
[1:00:38] and all that he's doing and going on for
[1:00:40] the moors. Just want to continue to hold
[1:00:42] them up and all the others that are
[1:00:44] missing there next to
[1:00:45] you. Anything else? Yes, sister.
[1:00:51] message to me
[1:00:57] They
[1:00:59] found ago.
[1:01:19] Praise the Lord. Thank you for that
[1:01:22] tonight. We appreciate that. I get so
[1:01:24] nervous. Like I said, I forgot to even
[1:01:25] mention that was Chicago in 60 I think
[1:01:28] it was. So appreciate that testimony of
[1:01:30] the Lord working in our sister Joyy's
[1:01:32] life through this message that's uh
[1:01:34] pertinent even today. Is there anything
[1:01:36] else that should be mentioned before we
[1:01:38] go to prayer? Yes, my
[1:01:42] sister. Yes. Thank you. That's brother
[1:01:44] Timothy Williams. That one that was in
[1:01:46] the prayer request. There's an email
[1:01:48] that went out. There's a way to support
[1:01:51] if you can do that. And for our sister
[1:01:52] Lori, people have been real responsive
[1:01:55] um to some of that. Some I think we
[1:01:57] could do a little bit better with just
[1:01:58] some reminders. So, we'll remind you and
[1:02:00] if nothing else, it's not to minimize
[1:02:03] the prayer. We can certainly hold them
[1:02:04] up and the Lord will move. Yes, my
[1:02:06] brother.
[1:02:09] Good.
[1:02:22] Definitely. Thanks for remembering our
[1:02:24] precious sister Deborah McGinty and the
[1:02:26] battles she's going through physically
[1:02:27] and um for a job and the things that she
[1:02:30] so desires. We delight ourselves in the
[1:02:32] Lord. He gives us the desires of our
[1:02:35] heart. Anything else?
[1:02:38] [Music]

[1:04:01] more.

[1:04:41] cares upon
[1:04:43] you. We'll sing it once more. Maybe
[1:04:46] they'll play a chord and keep us in
[1:04:47] tune. I
[1:04:49] cast all my
[1:04:52] cares upon you.

[1:31:15] appreciate sister RC so much and the the
[1:31:18] sisters and I missed one. We we should

[1:31:25] walk through them or pray for them or
[1:31:26] however he leads. But our precious
[1:31:29] brother Eli Castillo, he's preached for
[1:31:30] us before. We'll be ministering, God
[1:31:33] willing, for Easter Sunday. So be in
[1:31:35] prayer for him for that service on
[1:31:38] Sunday.
[1:31:42] Amen. God bless you all.
[1:31:48] Um that's one of my favorite tapes that
[1:31:51] uh we're hearing. Uh it's one of the
[1:31:53] first tapes that I heard when I came in
[1:31:55] the message and actually I I suggested
[1:31:58] it to brother
[1:32:02] Joe and uh there are some things that he
[1:32:05] said there this this night that uh kind
[1:32:08] of want to share with you a little bit
[1:32:09] that uh he he said that u this this
[1:32:13] story shouldn't even be wrote or
[1:32:17] told but it was done for our
[1:32:20] ammunition
[1:32:22] because it's for our day
[1:32:26] really. And then he also said that
[1:32:30] Samson gave his heart to Delilah and his
[1:32:33] strength to
[1:32:35] God.
[1:32:36] And when the prophet uh spoke uh the
[1:32:42] greatest battle ever fought
[1:33:42] Just coming.
[1:34:01] [Music]
[1:34:10] of God.
[1:34:40] [Music]
[1:35:00] And then uh Sister
[1:35:02] Chloe, Brother Timothy Williams Church,
[1:35:05] let's pray that um everything turns out
[1:35:08] for them. Sister Deborah McGinty, let's
[1:35:12] pray for her. I know she's been
[1:35:13] struggling and I told her she's one of
[1:35:16] my favorite
[1:35:17] singers. She sings with all her heart.
[1:35:22] Brother Israel, let's pray that God
[1:35:24] would be with him and give him traveling
[1:35:26] mercies and use them powerfully that he
[1:35:30] can come back real charged up that he
[1:35:32] can give us so he can charge us
[1:35:37] up. Yes. So, uh let's
[1:35:42] pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you,

[1:35:48] message, Lord. real simple.
[1:35:51] Lord, the prophet said it should never
[1:35:54] been wrote or told, but it was for our
[1:35:56] ammunition. Lord, it's for
[1:35:58] us. When we hear that second part, Lord,
[1:36:01] how Samson repent. He came to a
[1:36:03] repentance that we need to come to. It's
[1:36:07] Oh God, thank you Lord. We pray that you
[1:36:10] heal the sick. Lord, you we we u mention
[1:36:14] the names of the people here that
[1:36:16] requested prayer. Lord, we pray that you
[1:36:19] would come on the scene for all of them,
[1:36:21] Lord, and pray that you would be with us
[1:36:24] tonight, Lord, and and give us uh a good
[1:36:28] night, Lord, tonight, Lord. And just be

[1:37:12] be even now, Lord, working on his heart,
[1:37:15] Lord, that he can bring something to us,
[1:37:18] Lord, that would strengthen us, Lord,
[1:37:20] that would edify us, Lord, that would
[1:37:22] draw us closer to you, Lord. Thank you,
[1:37:25] Father. We bless you. We give you honor
[1:37:28] and glory, Lord.
[1:37:29] We commit our lives to thee, Lord, and
[1:37:32] give us traveling mercy's home, Lord,
[1:37:34] and be with us, Lord. Thank you once
[1:37:36] again for allowing us to be here, Lord.
[1:37:40] For we ask it in the name of the Lord
[1:37:41] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:37:46] And all God's people say, "Amen." Glad
[1:37:49] that they made you feel at home and made
[1:37:51] you feel important because you, Sister
[1:37:52] RC, and the girls, the sisters are
[1:37:55] important to us to to the body of
[1:37:57] Christ. Let's all stand. And I'm six
[1:38:00] string, but I'm going to take the
[1:38:01] opportunity to sing just a little bit.
[1:38:03] You're welcome to be dismissed at any
[1:38:04] time. If you want to be anointed with
[1:38:07] oil, sometimes that touch just in the
[1:38:09] word uh will mean something special. If
[1:38:11] you need that, you're welcome to come
[1:38:12] forward and we'll have brother Chris,
[1:38:13] brother Ben pray for you, lay hands on
[1:38:15] you, and we'll just be dismissing the
