[41:27] I'll ask you to to
[41:30] stand and we'll
[41:32] turn in the
[41:35] scriptures
[41:39] to Revelations chapter
[41:49] 13 something's going on up
[41:53] here thank you
[42:09] Revelations thir
[42:45] first Beast whose deadly wound was
[42:48] healed and he doeth great wonders so
[42:51] that he maketh Fire come down from
[42:53] heaven on the earth and the sight of men
[42:57] and deceiveth them that dwell on the
[43:00] Earth by the means of those Miracles
[43:03] which he had power to do and the sight
[43:05] of the Beast saying to them that dwell
[43:08] on the earth that they should make an
[43:10] image to the Beast which had the wound
[43:13] by a sword and did live and he had power
[43:16] to give life unto the image of the Beast
[43:19] that the image of the Beast should both
[43:21] speak and cause that as many as would
[43:24] not worship the image of the Beast
[43:26] should be killed and he causeth
[43:30] all both small and great rich and poor
[43:35] free and bond to receive a mark in their
[43:38] right hand or in their
[43:42] foreheads that no man might buy or sell
[43:45] say he that had had Mark or the name of
[43:48] the Beast or the number of his name here
[43:51] is wisdom let him that hath
[43:54] understanding count the number of of the
[43:57] Beast for it is the number of a man and
[44:01] his number is 63 score and6
[44:06] 666 amen we'll take one more scripture
[44:08] in Revelations chapter
[44:17] 10 one of our favorite verses verse
[44:20] seven those
[44:22] that follow this great message but in
[44:24] the days of the voice of the seventh
[44:27] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[44:29] mystery of God should be finished as he
[44:32] hath declared to his servants the
[44:35] prophets amen may God add a blessing to
[44:37] the reading of his word God richly bless
[44:40] you you may be
[44:42] seated you know this great image to the
[44:45] Beast that is rising up in the country
[44:48] now uh the prophet of God through
[44:51] prophecy and the understanding of the
[44:54] word shows us that that's this country
[44:58] in the hour and the time that we live in
[45:00] and as I said this morning we love our
[45:03] country we love what it stands for in
[45:06] many respects it's still the greatest
[45:09] country that the world knows I couldn't
[45:12] think of a better country to live
[45:14] in but the truth of it is that uh it has
[45:19] rejected
[45:20] God and it is been it has been
[45:25] indicted it can cannot repent and that's
[45:28] a that's a very strong thing to see
[45:31] someone or an individual that Cann not
[45:36] make things right they just can't do it
[45:38] and that's the case of our nation and so
[45:42] we are going to be playing the seventh
[45:44] seal on Sunday the Lord willing here but
[45:48] there's a portion that I'd like to play
[45:50] tonight and then I'll read out of the
[45:53] message uh Look Away to Jesus
[45:57] because he brings that
[45:59] afterwards um after he had opened up
[46:03] those seals deadly wound was healed and
[46:07] he doeth great wonders so that
[46:10] he

[1:02:46] messenger was the seven Messengers was
[1:02:51] the noted one to me the seventh angel it
[1:02:55] seemed more to me than any I see they
[1:02:57] were're standing like
[1:03:01] this we just want you to notice and I
[1:03:05] was standing here and I was watching
[1:03:08] those other see one first bunch of
[1:03:11] little birds feathers all beat down you
[1:03:13] remember them and they all flew
[1:03:17] Eastward and the second Bunch were
[1:03:20] brighter bigger birds look like doves
[1:03:23] pointed Wings they flew Eastward first
[1:03:27] pull second
[1:03:29] pull then the next was Angels am and
[1:03:33] it's I was standing right there and this
[1:03:35] explosion left and I was looking this
[1:03:37] way towards the west and they come and
[1:03:39] just picked me up in there and I went
[1:03:40] Plum out of my
[1:03:42] [Applause]
[1:03:43] knowing and the one of them coming was
[1:03:46] the one that looks so strange to me was
[1:03:49] the one on my beat the left where I
[1:03:52] entered the constellation at but
[1:03:54] counting from the left to the right it
[1:03:56] would been the seventh
[1:03:57] angel coming across
[1:04:00] now remember the seven Messengers do you
[1:04:04] remember the Pyramid of flight Rock of
[1:04:09] Junior Jackson's dream that I

[1:04:19] left and uh there were six dreams came
[1:04:23] and every one of them directly to the
[1:04:25] same thing then the vision started and
[1:04:28] sent me West is junior he was watching
[1:04:33] well notice look how
[1:04:37] perfect I'm I'm hoping and trusting that
[1:04:40] you people realize that I'm trying to
[1:04:42] put this grace on Jesus Christ who is
[1:04:46] the author of all of it and the only
[1:04:49] reason you never heard me talk like this
[1:04:50] before in your
[1:04:52] life but this hour is approaching amen

[1:05:08] know where I go I must preach the gospel
[1:05:11] other places bless Lord but now that you
[1:05:13] might say I've heard all that kind of
[1:05:15] fanatic I don't know why I can't judge
[1:05:17] any other man I only have to answer to
[1:05:20] God for what I for
[1:05:22] myself but has there ever been one time
[1:05:25] never told you anything in the name of
[1:05:26] the Lord it wasn't right in all these
[1:05:28] years nobody else can say so because I
[1:05:31] always told it just the way he told it
[1:05:33] now let me just show you that this is
[1:05:35] exactly true and confirm it now remember
[1:05:38] if there be a spiritual or Prophet I the
[1:05:41] Lord will speak to him in visions and
[1:05:44] make known to him by dreams interpret in
[1:05:47] dreams is that Joseph he can interpret
[1:05:49] dreams and speaking and see Visions is
[1:05:52] that true now notice this that now when
[1:05:56] this taken place Junior was standing in
[1:05:59] a field that had a had a big pyramid to
[1:06:02] it like that and there was something

[1:08:04] are spiritually discerned to
[1:08:09] me discerned by the Holy
[1:08:12] Spirit and by every one of them has
[1:08:16] identified its place in the
[1:08:19] Bible now what this great secret is that
[1:08:23] lays beneath this seal I do not know I
[1:08:27] don't know it I couldn't make it out I
[1:08:31] couldn't tell it just what it what it
[1:08:34] said but I know that it was in seven
[1:08:37] Thunders uttering themselves right close
[1:08:40] together just banging seven different
[1:08:42] times and it unfolded into something
[1:08:44] else that I seen then when I seen that I
[1:08:47] look for the interpretation it flew
[1:08:49] across there and I couldn't make it out
[1:08:52] that's exactly right see the hour is
[1:08:55] isn't quite yet far amen but it's moving
[1:08:58] into that cycle see it's coming up close
[1:09:03] so the thing for you to do is to
[1:09:05] remember that I speak to you in the name
[1:09:07] of the Lord amen hallelujah
[1:09:11] amen hallelujah be prepared or you don't
[1:09:15] know what time something can
[1:09:21] happen and praise the Lord how many
[1:09:24] thank God for his word that portion of
[1:09:27] his word amen that's the third pull
[1:09:30] brother random is talking about and he
[1:09:32] goes five months later in the message
[1:09:35] Look Away to Jesus and he gives us a
[1:09:39] time frame of the great squeeze and you
[1:09:43] see the church is going to put this
[1:09:46] persecution on the bride amen and we
[1:09:50] know that's going to take place we won't
[1:09:51] take time to read that but it's in that
[1:09:54] message Look Away to Jesus and I think
[1:09:58] that these are spiritually discerned uh
[1:10:01] things that we the bride of Christ
[1:10:04] should be into it's more it's closer
[1:10:07] today than it's ever been and our
[1:10:11] appetite and our desire and our heart
[1:10:14] looking on these things every time like
[1:10:17] I could study it study it and then play
[1:10:19] it every time I listen to it I get
[1:10:21] something more out of it just sitting
[1:10:23] here now just getting more out of it
[1:10:25] what the prophet is trying to tell us
[1:10:28] for what we have need of for the Rapture
[1:10:30] is laying in there amen so God richly
[1:10:33] bless you as we prepare to go to the
[1:10:34] table of the Lord if the musicians would
[1:10:36] come
[1:10:37] please trust that was a blessing to you
[1:10:41] and for
[1:10:42] you
[1:10:44] in 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:10:52] 11 see this great hour approaching
[1:10:56] my say Lord have mercy on
[1:11:01] us keep me true to your word Lord
[1:11:14] Jesus in verse 23 if we'll stand for the
[1:11:17] reading of God's
[1:11:21] word 1 Corinthians 11:23
[1:11:32] for I have received of the Lord that
[1:11:33] which also I delivered unto you that the
[1:11:36] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[1:11:38] was betrayed took bread and when he had
[1:11:41] given thanks he break it and said take
[1:11:44] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:11:47] you this do in remembrance of me after
[1:11:52] the same manner also he took the cup
[1:11:54] when he had s saying this cup is the New
[1:11:57] Testament in my blood this do ye as of
[1:12:01] as you drink it in the remembrance of me
[1:12:05] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:12:07] drink this cup you do show the Lord's
[1:12:09] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[1:12:13] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:12:15] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:12:18] of the body and blood of the Lord but
[1:12:21] let a man examine himself and so let him
[1:12:23] eat of that bread and drink of that cup
[1:12:27] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:12:29] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[1:12:32] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:12:35] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:12:38] sickly among you and many
[1:12:41] sleep for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:12:44] should not be judged but when we are
[1:12:47] judged we are chased chasen of the Lord
[1:12:50] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:12:53] world wherefore my brethren when you
[1:12:55] come together to eat t one for another
[1:12:58] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:13:01] home that you come not together unto
[1:13:04] condemnation and the rest will I set in
[1:13:07] order when I
[1:13:09] come what a a beautiful opportunity to
[1:13:12] obey the word of God As He commands us
[1:13:16] to do this till he
[1:13:18] comes and the examination is a
[1:13:22] self-examination and the Bible says let
[1:13:24] a man EX examine himself that's a man or
[1:13:27] woman boy or girl you examine yourself
[1:13:32] so that you're not taking the blood and
[1:13:36] the body of the Lord
[1:13:38] unworthily and you don't want to be
[1:13:41] guilty of that and those that are guilty
[1:13:43] of it are sick they're weak and they
[1:13:48] sleep they die a premature death and
[1:13:52] this death strikes it's not just a natur
[1:13:55] death it's a spiritual death and you see
[1:13:58] it across and you'll see behaviors that
[1:14:01] people engage in and attitudes won't
[1:14:04] make it right grudges issues and
[1:14:08] problems won't make it right we just get
[1:14:11] used to living that way because um
[1:14:13] there's no open
[1:14:15] rebuke you haven't been embarrassed in
[1:14:18] front of the congregation no one openly
[1:14:21] called your sin out that that you with
[1:14:25] repent but the Bible says let a man
[1:14:27] examine
[1:14:28] himself you say well Pastor why don't
[1:14:32] you point those things out why don't you
[1:14:33] preach on this why don't you preach on
[1:14:35] that let a man examine
[1:14:37] himself and you examine Yourself by
[1:14:40] taking God's word and looking at the
[1:14:43] word and don't make it don't try to make
[1:14:45] it fit what your
[1:14:48] circumstances just let it say what it
[1:14:50] says and you ask God to help you the
[1:14:53] blood is on The Mercy Seat seat to cover
[1:14:56] and to take care of all of your sins and
[1:14:58] weaknesses and don't and don't let the
[1:15:01] enemy fool you everyone in this room has
[1:15:04] weaknesses
[1:15:06] frailties problems issues that we must
[1:15:10] make right and so we come to the table
[1:15:13] of the Lord knowing not in our goodness
[1:15:15] or our righteousness but he paid a price
[1:15:18] for us that we too can come and
[1:15:21] partake from the table of the Lord and
[1:15:25] with that taking there's a blessing to
[1:15:27] it there's a spiritual strength that
[1:15:30] comes when you're obedient to the word
[1:15:32] there's uh the revelation of the word
[1:15:35] the holy spirit is there to lead you to
[1:15:38] guide you and strengthen you and we're
[1:15:40] going to take a moment and Terry will
[1:15:43] pray for one another you pray for me
[1:15:45] I'll pray for you just for a moment in
[1:15:48] silent
[1:15:50] prayer Jesus thank you
[1:15:53] Father e
[1:16:40] amen and in that self-examination then I
[1:16:44] just have to do my diligence to just to
[1:16:47] remind you of that the Lord is mindful
[1:16:50] of us his grace and mercy is there to
[1:16:54] uphold us and to bless us and strengthen
[1:16:57] us but he cannot repent for you you have
[1:17:01] to do that on your own and you don't
[1:17:04] want to you know you don't want a secret
[1:17:07] sin that's not covered and move forward
[1:17:11] okay so we'll bow our heads and bless
[1:17:13] the
[1:17:16] bread Lord Jesus in my hand I hold this
[1:17:19] bread that was made for this service
[1:17:21] tonight I pray you're bless it Lord and

[1:17:34] it's a type Lord to keep until you come
[1:17:38] back for us and Lord we know that it's
[1:17:42] it's not making this bread into your
[1:17:44] body it represents your body it

[1:17:50] that purpose in Jesus name amen

[1:29:52] of Judas scariot Simon's son
[1:29:54] to betray him Jesus knowing that the
[1:29:57] father had given all things into his
[1:29:59] hands that he was come from God and went
[1:30:02] to God he rised from supper and laid
[1:30:06] aside his garments and took a towel and
[1:30:09] GED himself after that he poured water
[1:30:12] into a basin and began to wash the
[1:30:15] disciples feet and to wipe them with the
[1:30:18] towel wherewith he was girded then
[1:30:21] cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith
[1:30:24] unto him Lord Dost thou wash my feet
[1:30:28] Jesus answered and said unto him what I
[1:30:30] do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt
[1:30:33] know Hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou
[1:30:36] shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered
