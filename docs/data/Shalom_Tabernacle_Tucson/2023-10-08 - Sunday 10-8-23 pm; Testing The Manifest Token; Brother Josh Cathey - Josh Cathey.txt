BR Jesus was thinking of me even as they be him I don't know how Jesus was thinking of me even as they drove the nails in his hands even as they pierced his side I was never out of his mind for a moment he was thinking of me when he died the angry M around him was hungry to see someone die the Roman soldiers bound him not knowing who they crucified it was in the nails in his hands and his feet that held him on that old [Music] tree it was a self-denying all consuming love for someone like me even while the blood was still warm on his brow Jesus was thinking of me even as they beat him I don't know how Jesus was thinking of me even as they draw the nails in his hands even as they pierced his son I was never out of his mind for a moment he was thinking of me when he died I was never

God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God [Music] for he's worthy to be praised God bless you brother Josh amen God bless you and I would just like to before we read the scripture um I just wanted to thank the church you know we've been here since January I think and I just wanted to thank the church for how they've just accepted a sin they act like they knew us for 20 years we got here and people were bringing gift baskets to our house giving us gift cards just really spoiling us and uh truly made it feel like home and we appreciate that we thank you so much me Caden the babies we just want to say thank you from the bottom of our hearts and um if we would if we could turn to Isaiah 648 in Isaiah 648 it says but now oh Lord Thou Art Our Father we are the clay and thou our Potter and we all are the work of thy hand and then turn over to 2 Thessalonians chap 1 verses 1-5 and it says Paul and Sylvanas and timotheus unto the Church of Thessalonians and God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ we are bound to thank God always for you Brethren as it is meat because that your faith groweth exceedingly and and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth verse four says so that we ourselves glory in you in the Churches of God for your patience and faith and all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure and it says which is a manifest token of the righteous Judgment of God and so a judgment we know a judgment in a court trial at least a judgment is after all the questioning the testing and all that has been done it's the end it's it's what where you get your judgment at and he said which is a manifest token of the righteous Judgment of God that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God for which ye also suffer amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we just thank you for this opportunity to come into the house of the Lord Lord Jesus your Prophet told us that it was a Christian's privilege and honor to come into the house of the Lord and father as this as this service goes forward I ask that you would move me out of the way that you would calm any nerves I have that you would just anoint me father and that you would help me along the way and Lord the prayer requests that went up earlier Lord we ask you watch over each and every one of those that you bless each one father and that you come down and just give them a Special Touch from you Lord we just thank you and we love you in Jesus Christ's name amen may be seated so another translation when I was looking up manifest token is what really caught me about this scripture says which is a manifest token and another translation of manifest token was evidence that their persecutions and their tribulations that they were enduring it was a type of an Evidence of the righteous Judgment of God upon their lives and so when I was reading Isaiah 648 I was wondering out of everything why would a out of everything we could have used as an example why would a Potter and a clay be what we used why would that be the things to look to as an example and the more I studied it I realized that it was it was really more about the entire process of what happens with a Potter in his clay it's not we know he shapes it but there's an entire process from being a piece of clay that's useless that that can't do anything and then turning that into something with purpose a vase that can hold flowers or a bowl that you can eat out of you know it has purpose after that and I saw a quote the other day it's not it's not brother brandham saying this but I just thought it was very appropriate for the the process it it said most people don't want to be a part of the process they just want to be a part of the outcome it said but the process is where you figure out who's worth being part of the outcome and so in in Pottery the Potter he can form his clay in many ways it doesn't have to be the same like I said a bowl a vase he's got many different ways of doing it and they use different tools and they use different things to do it and they usually follow a Master model maybe they'll sketch out over here this is what I want my vase to look like and then they'll they'll follow that Master model the whole time and so as they're doing that one of the first steps of pottery is called centering and when you're centering you have the clay on a potter's wheel and you're trying to Center that clay as much as you possibly can to keep it in Balance so it won't fall off this way it won't fall off that way and you just Center that clay so that it will be ready for the steps that follow and they're not doing that so they there's a lot of pushing and pulling involved in centering something just like us on the word there there's a lot of days that we're pushing and pulling with the Lord you know the word tells us something but we feel something else and there's a lot of push and pull a lot of give and take and so it's the same way with pottery and there they're not doing it the the Potter doesn't do it to hurt the clay or harm it in any way it's trying to get that clay to fulfill its ultimate purpose to get it down the road to where it can hold those flowers or it can be a bowl to hold food for someone and so the next step that they have is called the dry out and so the dry out after they Center the clay and they have it on the wheel they got to wait until every bit of moisture is wicked out of that every bit of moisture or anything that's in the clay that'll that'll harm the clay later down the road there's a dry out process that happens and the importance of getting all the water out is that if you put it into the um into the oven too early without any water or with water still in it that moisture expands so it can be dangerous down the road if it doesn't get completely dried out and a lot of the I looked that up and a lot of the experts say never try and manufacture the drying process you let it happen on its own you let it happen naturally don't don't don't fake the drying process cuz you're not going to trick the oven once it gets in the oven cuz if that water's still in there something's going to happen and not something good so for a sec let's say the Clay's got a mind of its own for a second it's partially dried out but there's still just a little bit of moisture left in that clay it's still holding on to a few things it shouldn't really be holding on to that it knows it shouldn't be and there's a story I seen the other day it's uh it it was about a method that Hunters had used in Africa to capture monkeys and so what they would do they would get a large Plant it's a shell pretty much a gourd it's called a calabos and they would drill a hole in its side just large enough for the monkey's hand to go in like this and so they would do that and after they did that they would put peanuts in the bottom of the gourd and so the monkey he would be going through and he would smell something familiar and so he'd be going through and then he'd look up and he'd see not like it's strange that there's a gourd in a tree with peanuts in it or nothing not like that's odd or anything but he smelt the peanuts and he liked it so he went up and as soon as the monkey put his hand in there and got a hold of what he wanted he couldn't get his hand back out because the hole was specifically the size of his hand that's right and so the the conclusion of that was if he would only release the prize that he thought he had his hands on he could be free again that's right but the monkey thought that he still wanted that it was what he still wanted it was something that he remembered maybe from a past life and he was trying to hold on to it dearly and so the hunters would come and he would still be up there but he just wouldn't let go of the peanuts he couldn't get his hand out so his freedom was really H it was his choice it was hinged upon the monkey so the the last step of the clay is firing the clay so what happens after the drying out process is you fire it and what firing it does is it really molds the clay together and it fuses the clay and any elements together and I just thought that's something I'd really like to focus on because as a Christian in our Journeys that's something we're going to do we're going to spend a lot of time in the fire getting molded together a lot of things coming together a lot of things getting worked on burnt out of us so once in the fire all these chemical compounds and minerals they're they're burned away they're broken down and it takes shape of what it's supposed to be and the thing about when it takes shape there is no possible way to return that vase or that bowl back into the clay that it once was it's there it is what it is if you try and go back to its old form if you try if I took a vase up here right now and I slammed it on the floor and expected clay to be on the floor I broke it it's broken you ain't going to get clay from that it's already it's already transformed into something new a new creation one of the first tests after they get that new creation is a stain test and what they'll do is they'll put they'll they'll stain the outside of the ceramic with something and then they'll let it sit and they'll watch it and they'll watch the outside and then they'll look at the inside and if they see anything any of that stained color on the inside then they'll know that there's some cracks on the outside that didn't quite get taken care of so they'll see something seeping through something that shouldn't be on the inside of that bowl so we can see this testing it's not to hurt the product make it look bad it's it's only to prove the work of the Potter that's all that these tests and these processes are for is to prove the work of the Potter and he's the one who shaped it he molded it he baked it and produced it brother brandham said in we have seen a star and have come to worship Him paragraph 42 he said and sometimes we think that our burdens he said I might inject this here that we think our burdens are so heavy sometimes that there's nothing like it in the world he said do you know all those things are good for you all your burdens all your struggles all your tests whatever you're being put through if what I assume when I said when I read this quote the things that I were going through that I was going through at that specific time started rushing through my head and I started thinking you're Lord you're telling me that these things that I'm going through have a purpose that they're for my betterment that they're good for they don't feel good for me right now they don't look good for me it don't sound good for me but if your word says it's good for me then I trust your word it is good for me he said they are all to mold you make you it says prophets and sages was molded on the back side of the desert in the hot blazing sun through tribulations and trials and persecutions and these things that we have today this really struck he said there's nothing happened to us that hasn't happened to other Christians before so when you read that quote you would think well brother brandham didn't have to deal with cell phones he didn't have to deal with the internet Paul didn't have to deal with cell phones to the internet they didn't have to deal with those things but the same spirit that can attach itself to those devices they had devices in Paul's day that Spirits attached their yourself to and they used it and I'm not saying get rid of the internet or cell phone but sometimes I think we which it's a tough day to live in but those same spirits that were battling today were battled then as well he said other Christians has had to stand in the hour of Darkness like this and even be fed to lions for their testimony you know just as we have our products like you you buy a new Ford truck and you hop that that truck was tested you hop that they did something to it well they were sure that if you're going 75 down the highway that the tires won't fall off you know any product you have you hope that it was tested and tried so that it won't blow up in your face or hurt you in some way and you know the Lord wants to do the same things with his products that's us we are his we're his hands and feet here we are his products on the earth we are what he can use here and he does the same exact thing with us brother brandham said and how can I overcome I'm not sure about the paragraph what it is but it's how can overcome at 63 and he said now we're expected to be tested said that's a good lesson for my brother back there also he that cometh to God must first be tested tested what with the word that's God's test said Do you believe it he that cometh to God must be tested he said that only shows a true child then see be tested and when the test comes you can't overcome L there's a test to give to you right so the Bible tells us we are more than Overcomers the Bible plainly tells us that and there has to be something to overcome there has to be a test a trial a roadblock something you got to get through to overcome to to make that scripture come to life to you and so he goes on to say and when the test is given it's to see whether you can overcome or not and Jesus said to him that overcome the test the test is the greatest thing that ever ever happened to you he said the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you you know if that Ford truck wouldn't have been tested and they all failed nobody would have bought the fort truck nobody would have wanted it nobody would have been interested in it and the test that there's a a big reason why I think the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to someone is that the lie that Satan will try and tell a lot of people is that you've gone too far you've messed up you've gone too far you've done too much there's no redeeming you but the test is proof that God's still working with you you haven't gone too far you haven't done too much you're not you're not the test is a proof and evidence a manifest token like the scripture said that God is still there in your life working with you it said I believe it's written in the scripture Peter said that our trials are worth more to us than precious gold it's a testing time and brother Bram says right right here it's one good evidence to us that God is with us when we're tested for all children of God are tested and tried and once again I could see how that ceramic pot had a mind of its own it might question it might say it's at this stage right now and it say well I was tested back there I thought it was over with I went through all these tests the the firing up the the drying out the centering I went through all of this stuff and you're telling me there's more I'm a ceramic pot now I'm done I thought my journey was over but even the ceramic pot once it gets sold and goes to a house I can attest having two little babies that ceramic pot's probably going to get headbutted a few times and shaken and the handles pulled on maybe dropped who knows what is going to get happen to it but the testing is never over that pot will be tested and there will be as brother Israel spoke this morning there's Seasons there'll be seasons of that test and there will be some that are probably a little bit easier than others some that are a little bit harder all right but the testing it's not because the Potter is mad at it what he's created he actually just wants what's best for it the Potter he he's not angry at his creation he would and went off went through all the trouble to have that creation and test it and do all these things with it and show it this attention and heal it and give it salvation and hang on a cross and die for it he wouldn't have done all that if he didn't love it if he didn't love what he did and the Lord wants to same for us and he knows what's best so brother brandham said in the message I know it's a 1960 paragraph 46 I don't know if you getting any of these I don't know I'm not sure okay um and I know uh paragraph 46 he said we ask for comfort and peace God gives us the best he could give us trials and tribulations said that's better than comfort and peace our Comforts is just beyond the river he said it was until the Hebrew children was forced into the fiery furnace on one of their most outstanding trials that they are seen one like the Son of God standing among them I love this he said their troubles produced the son of God standing among them in the breezes to wave away the Heatwave said but not until they went into the fire did the comforter appear he said they troubles produced the son of God standing among them it squeezed them those Hebrew children they had a squeeze put on them they had been told things they had been told you can't do this you can't do that you better do this or else they were squeezed tight and the only thing out of them that that squeeze produced was genuine faith that is exactly what that squeeze produced out of those Hebrew children you know they they were they were squeezed and squeezed but when they came out of that fiery furnace with no burn marks there wasn't no bleeding I bet they weren even sweating bet it wasn't even hot I it felt like 69° in the house or something 70° but if they have walked into that furnace saying oh it's all over now God's forsaken us God Don't Care About Us this fire is too much for me this fire is going to overtake me it may have turned out different I can't say I don't know if it would have but it may have but they said our God is able to deliver us and that Faith produced the Son of God to come on the scene and and I found this uh the next quote I found this striking that they didn't even have a promise like ours to put their faith in they didn't have anything like what we have what we have access to we got all the message we got all the Bible we can access it in in one second I could have it pulled up on my phone almost and they didn't have none of that they say God is able brother brandham said in God hath a provided way paragraph 110 he said he did the same thing he was going to glorify himself in the Hebrew children he made a preparation when did he make it the Hebrew children didn't have any promise they couldn't get back here and reading the Bible and say Lord you promised in your word that any of your children ever went into a fiery furnace you would deliver them all right Lord we're coming right there upon that well that wouldn't have been so hard to do just their Fai because God had already promised it that's that's us today that brother bram's talking about he said that wouldn't be so hard to do God promised it you got in the word to me it was kind of funny how he just he talked about that he said it wouldn't be that hard to do you know God promised it and that's us today we have all of that we have access to every bit of that and he said but God hadn't promised them no such thing imagine that what walking towards a fiery furnace that's huge and just fire on the inside fire as tall as you are and you don't know what God has promised you you just believe in him you believe he's able you believe he has the ability to rescue you from that but he's never promised it he's never told you he's never spoke to you in his word nothing imagine that he said but here's the words they had God was so real to them they said our God is able how about that the F that don't believe in Divine Healing God is able to deliver us come these y furnace but will not bow down to your images and when they walked into the fiery furnace upon bare sheer faith that God was able not promised but he was able God sent Christ in the fiery furnace and fan the fire away from them and protected them and brought them out sure but I'm saying God is able he said now you don't come saying God is able you don't have to come that you can say God you promised amen you have his word said you prepared it at Calvary and I've come to receive it it's your preparation you provided it and you promised it and I see others receiving it said so I come too Lord to get my part of it he said you'll go away a different person he said you'll go away with such an anchor inside your soul that nothing can upset you you know that you're healed you know that God has taken care of this matter for you because he promised you brother Bram said he gives testings and trials with these promises and he wants to see who you'll tone to he wants to see if you'll maybe that's why we're tested he want he wants to see if you'll fall back drop back a little bit or if you'll ask him for some help you'll say Lord I I don't know what to do in this situation this is this situation has outgrown me completely I'm not sure what to do but I know who knows what to do that's all you got got to do just go go to them in prayer and I I had a I thought of this during brother Israel's sermon this morning I can't remember what made me think of it but it it made me think about like a train ride you come up on a tunnel and the tunnel's dark and you go in the tunnel and you can't see the end and it's not because there's not an end it's just you can't see the end but going into the tunnel you didn't realize it's a tunnel that's got to turn like this and so you're going through the tunnel you just haven't got to your turn yet and it starts turning it starts turning and little by little you see a sliver of light here sliver of light there and then pretty soon Your Eyes Are Fixed On the exit you have faith in that exit you know it's there you see the light completely it might have been a story about the boy in Awin bicycle I think that's what it was um but how much more face should we have all that's been given to us with struggles and trials and we're we're not facing a fiery furnace right now now I'm glad I'm not cuz I don't know if I have what they had yet but I'm hoping I'll get it I have faith that I'll get it I'm trusting in the Lord for it so thinking on that manifest token topic who knows what a touchstone is if you heard brother brandom talk about that in the message I think he mentions it a few time it's a stone and it's a black stone they'll take uh like it it used to be an old way to prove what kind of metal you had if you had gold if you had silver or what you had when you're trying to sell it and mostly used for gold and they would take the gold and they had the stone and they had a line they used friction against a stone and they already had a line that was real gold there and what the touch Stone did was if you were claiming to have a gold ring you'd take that ring off and they'd take the Touchstone and they'd start scraping it real hard against it the friction and so they'd scrape it and scrape it and then they would compare the two to see if it was real gold or not they' put it through a test to see if that gold was legitimate or to see if you had of Fate Kon and so so by what the gold produces from the friction against the Touchstone that's what told if it was real gold or not that friction produced that real gold that friction is what told them that it was truly gold so brother Bram said I think he mentioned it twice in the message he said the man that has good gold don't mind going to the touching Stone he he ain't scared of it he don't mind getting tested he don't mind it coming he knows it's coming he's he's got a gold ring he's going to sell and he takes it up there and he knows the test is coming but he don't care because he knows that's genuine gold that he's got and just like us we know what we have here we know what that Pillar of Fire represented we know what dying on the cross meant for us we have real gold it's not fake it's not phony it's real gold and another way they use for gold brother brandham said in conferences paragraph 86 he said in the old days the only way they had to separate it was a beater he said beat the gold with a hammer like the Indians beat it and the only way that the beater knew that he had the gold ready was when he beat all the dross out of it and I didn't know what dross was I never heard of that I had no idea so draw is actually it's a mass of solid impurities it's stuff that it's not worth no money has no value it's no good it doesn't do anything good for the gold it's worthless pretty much and he said and he would beat it and turn it over and beat it and beat it until all the dross went out of it he said when he seen his own self reflect back into the gold he then knew that all the dirt and the iron and the foreign matters was out of the gold so when Christ these tests that he allows us to go through when he sees himself reflecting back in us he's our example when he's reflecting back in our lives our day-to-day lives how we're talking to people how we're treating people you know what we're doing in church just who you are that's what it is and that's the way God is trying to do his church is to beat it till all the Creeds and the nonsense and all the world is beat out of it till it reflects back the life of Jesus Christ if you know that's one of the enemies that's what he likes to attack people that's his favorite thing to do is tell a Christian you aren't actually what you believe you are that's a that's a big struggle a big test that's that's not even a very forceful test he it's he just wants you to doubt who you are and what your position is in this word and as long as he can do that and keep you subdued like the faith and fear there's two roads as long as he can keep you down fear and you're subdued and you don't believe who this message tells you you are he can keep you trapped it's like that monkey he's got his hand in there he's got his peanuts but he can't get it out you're trapped you're staying right there until through Revelation you can realize whom you are cuz truly he's scared of what will happen if you know who you are I had a I left my phone in there I had a quote I did want to read it's on my phone though um I'm not going to try and paraphrase it I'd probably miss it up but you know every lie that he tells you is usually a truth about himself everything he tries to tell you you are is you you know old saying when you're pointing at somebody telling them what they are you got these three pointing right back at you right and so when he's trying to tell you what you are what you can't do what Authority you don't have that's all Truth for him he's trying to trick you into thinking you're like him but you're not we're redeemed we have the blood of Christ to be under he doesn't he he doesn't have nothing to be under so John 8:44 says when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own and to me that's usually a pretty good sign of jealousy he wants to be you he wish he probably wishes he could go back and change a few things and have what you have so a lot I've always like sports broadcasters if you if you've ever watched a football game or something or seen one so the broadcasters what they like to do is criticize the players and they talk about the players like they could do it better than them they're up there sitting there say ah you couldn't hit them with that pass across the middle you couldn't do that you couldn't throw him out from center field but you get out there you ain't no can throw a ball 10 feet but they're up there criticizing from the outside but that's jealousy that's wanting to be who you are that's wanting to do what you do and he's just not able to do that and he's mad about it but I can't help he's mad about it but he says stuff like you can't be healed but Jesus's Stripes say different he says things like you've gone too far but then the grace of God says different he says you're weak-minded he he says you got anxiety you're depressed you're in a slump right now nothing's going good nobody you nobody loves you this is all terrible but then the love of God and the mind of Christ says different the scriptures given us ways that he can hit you with all these lies but he can't hit you with something that's going to defeat the scripture cuz nothing defeats the scripture nothing defeats this message this word what Christ has sent but that's the way anything worth anything has ever been made through pressure through test and pressure you don't get a diamond without some intense heat and pressure you just don't get it I loved it it was a I think it was a presbyterian minister in the early 1900 said his name was Peter Marshall he said may we may we think of Freedom not as the right to do as we please but as the opportunity to do what is right he said when we long for life without difficulties remind us that the Oaks grow strong in contrary winds and diamonds are made Under Pressure he said Oaks thrive in those rough winds when other trees fall other trees are falling there's a storm coming through and this is not it wouldn't have been my first guess but I researched a little bit and the thing that makes an oak so tough is not the bark it's not it's not the outside of the tree it's not the branches how thick they are it's not any of those things that you see from the outward appearance of that Oak but it's The Oak's root system it's something unseen it's it's an anchor in the ground for that Oak that's holding it still now it has it has properties about the outside of it that's tough you know it's hard to chop down an oak tree but the roots are what holds it the roots steady it something from underneath the surface and so when the the neat thing about a Oak's root system is when they're planted around each other they reach for each other they want to interconnect they want to be a part of one another and that's what makes Oaks that are planted together even stronger The Oaks will they get planted and they reach out for others and they bind their s together and they hold so when a storm comes maybe this Oak over here the wind's only blown this way and it's been hit by storms all the time this Oak over here ain't never been through a storm but because those Oaks this this Oak don't know what it feels like to go through that storm it ain't never been there but the Oaks are interconnected underneath there there's a there's an invisible Union between those oak trees that you can't see there's something holding them together that's and it just made me think you know Fellowship matters that's a big thing talking about testing and struggles and trials you know Fellowship is huge so you know when I'm if I'm going through something and I'm in a struggle and it comes church night I think ah it's just too that's a lot of trouble to get get up get dressed go to the house of God and worship you know I'mma be expected to S expect me to sing sit back there and sing I'm going have to raise my hand stuff and you know it seems like a lot of trouble but when you get here and you start fellowshipping it's nice and you get here and you're like man I like that that's nice wow both of them maybe and you get to maybe hollering a little bit and you get to say an amen and you get happy and that's what the Lord does for you and that's a test in itself he's put you through some or allowed something to happen to you and went through that day and he's going to say I'm going to see what he's going to do this time I'm going to see if he's going to take my way and go to the house of the Lord and worship with his brothers and sisters or if he's going to sit here and just wallow in it be sad about it but that's the same for Christians as well exactly the same and I guess so Fellowship struck me in this I guess it matters to me so much cuz when there was times when I didn't really want to when I first came to church there was times when I didn't want to keep going even in life you know I I wanted it there was days where before I was a Christian I wanted it to be all over but the people that the Lord placed in my life and the oak trees that he put my life then the only reason I'm still here today you know I I was praying then and I I wouldn't realize I'd be praying you know Lord I want these things that I'm struggling with I need help and you know what I wanted some mystical help like it be swept away from me and just I never never think about it again well that can happen too God can do that but what he can also do is Place oak trees in your life he can put people in your life there to guide you and to help you and I had those people plac in my life when I went to church I had oak trees that I were around I had people I could lean on people that their root systems ran deep and they were tied together and I was just a tiny little Oak I'm still tiny little Oak but I had them to lean on and in Clos closing I'd like to mention maybe one more example of testing uh what about steel you know steel to build buildings to build a church to build whatever you want to build with it in the first stages of making steel it's not ready to support those things I just named it's not there yet and the very first step is metal casting there's a mold and you pulled into the mold and it's a specific mold for this part of that building there's different molds there's different parts to a skyscraper it's not all I beams or o beams or whatever beam they want to call it it's not all just one set of beams it's different beams that come into a collective to help one another and it helps one another to build that building they they Fellowship together and they lock together and then there's a skyscraper all of a sudden a huge beautiful Skyscraper with these simple little things that have been made to hold them together and it they go through some tough tests to qualify to be the structure of a building the the first test they go through is tensile testing and that's done to decide how the steel responds when you apply Force to it so they test it they'll they'll bend it and test it and try and shape it different ways and they'll see you know they'll they'll leave it there like that for a long time to see what it can withstand to see it to see if it'll come out okay or to see if it'll eventually break so very similar to The Clay Pot steel also goes through a burning out process to get all the impurities out to get everything that doesn't need to be in the makeup of that steel out of the steel steel and this is probably out of all these this probably my favorite step of the steel making process and I it has a lot of big words so I did have to plagiarize it pretty much completely it says for says for Reliable longevity and to Bear extreme weight structural steel must be of the right composition now this is it says iron say iron here and carbon are two of the most vital components used by steel mills when making structural steel it says the carbon lends strength to the iron ore which is a source for the Iron and Steel and it's said that the iron is quite soft on its own so what happens as those components come together and the carbon in that steel goes to the iron and fuses together with it to make it one to form something together the iron itself said is quite soft on its own it can't do it on its own it's not good enough it's not worthy it can't have it without that and that's what the blood of Christ has to us we can't do it without his blood it has his Spirit has to come down and fuse with us just the same as that carbon fuses with that iron because we're soft on our own we're weak we can't do it think about before you knew the Lord were you doing it then I wasn't I wasn't anywhere close and it says to achieve loadbearing capacity structural steel must have a higher carbon content by weight it says in manufacturers can increase the amount of carbon according to the level of strength its application requires so it saids it needs a higher carbon content by weight so the carbon in this type would be the Holy Ghost and you need more of him in you than you and you you need quite a bit more of him in you and that's what I want today I want more of him in me I want more and more I want to be like each one of these types I want to be like the pot I want to be like the steel I want to be like the oak tree I want to be a oak tree I want my my roots to nobody has to see how tough I am but with the Holy Ghost in here that I'm rooted I got an anchor I've got something to hold on to something that runs deeper than any outward appearance of toughness or shown that I could take whatever the world's got to throw at me I have something more than that something unseen so as the musicians come I have maybe one more quote I'd like to read and it's a it's a long one but it's a good one and it is in go tell my disciples starting at paragraph 158 he says standing sometime ago I was standing at Gary Indiana where they taken me through the big Gary steel mills and I was very much alarmed while I was watching the superintendent taken me up and he was showing me all around the place and he said I was watching the men said a little whistle tooted 5 minutes before quitting time I noticed every man taken his apron off and laid it upon machine upon the machines and right out through around his lays and things and he was sweeping out into the aisle a bunch of shavings that had been collected from the material he was working on and he swept them all out in the aisle and he said I'll show you something here Reverend brandom I said all right he said then he walked back to a little place after the main whistle blowed all the men went out everybody was clear from the building we were left standing alone and he pressed a button and Away back in the back I heard of something run Thunder and Roar and Burr coming down I thought what is that after a while he said now you stand to his side I stood aside he said I I seen a track coming down through there and when it did here come a great magnet coming down through excuse me and as the magnet passed down through the line I begin to notice those shavings flying up to meet it like that then metal shavings and I when I was reading this you know maybe it was a metal shaving maybe it was a little bit bigger piece maybe there's a little bit bigger piece than that fly up to meet that magnet but they were all pure steel it didn't matter how big you were it didn't matter what you were as long as you were pure steel that's what that magnet required the magnet only had one requirement is that you are steel said I noticed some of them didn't come up and I noticed several pieces of iron didn't come up and that magnet went on back over into the Capa and melt dropped all this stuff down into the Capa and it was melted and made over again and I said well why didn't it all raise up I said I see some shavings he said Reverend brandom we make some aluminum parts here he said those aluminum pieces are not magnetized to that magnet I said praise the Lord and I said he said what's the matter with you I said I was just thinking so I said why didn't them iron pieces go up said if you noted they are bolted down they can't raise up I said praise God hallelujah he said what's the matter Reverend brandom I said I was just thinking said you must have been I said brother way back Yonder somewhere in eternity's Hallelujah there is a great magnet the Son of God is going to be turned loose one of these mornings he is sweeping down over the Earth like a magnet and every soul that's magnetized to him will go up to meet him in the air and there will be in the resurrection to live with him be taken out yonder and these old bodies that we now live in or even like we have now that's getting old and crinkling up and dropping down will be dropped Over Yonder into the Capa of dust and molded over and made like unto his own glorious body in the final Resurrection when he comes again you know without all the tests that that steel went through up to that point it wouldn't have been ready for that magnet to sweep over it those tests had a purpose those struggles had a purpose those things those days that were hard to get through had a purpose and they shaped and molded that steel and they made it true steel that steel it accepted that carbon that iron accepted the carbon and formed something greater it Formed something Everlasting that's what it does in our lives and I said well now look at here there's many people that's not magnetized there's many people that's bolted down with circumstances say I can't do it I just couldn't do it it's too much of a price brother except that heart is changed and that Soul sitting under magnetized with God by the Holy Ghost when Jesus comes you'll be left on Earth alone remember there will be a resurrection one of these mornings only for those that are dead in Christ will God bring with him I would like to be one of those as I said earlier I want to be one of those I don't care if I'm a clay pot a clay vase I don't care what I am but as long as I go through that testing and that trying that's what I want to be for myself I want to be that piece of Steel that can be put in the building that can help the building I don't care if I'm the smallest piece I don't care if I'm the biggest piece but I want to go through that testing I want to be a pieace I want to be a part and that's just my prayer this morning to be a when that great magnet comes through I want to go up and meet it in the air amen God bless [Applause] you amen how many enjoy the word of the Lord tonight oh very very
