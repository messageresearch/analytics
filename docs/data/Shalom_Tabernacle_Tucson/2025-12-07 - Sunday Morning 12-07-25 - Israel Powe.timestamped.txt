[0:31] and good morning everyone. Can we all
[0:33] stand? I'll open up in a word of prayer
[0:36] for the adult Sunday school class.
[0:40] Heavenly Father, Lord, we're grateful to
[0:42] be here this morning, Father. Lord, just
[0:45] to hear preaching of your word, Father,
[0:49] it brings us more clarity, Lord, as your
[0:51] scripture has said that this day loose
[0:54] ends would be Lord worked out. Father,
[0:58] mysteries would be revealed. And Lord,
[1:01] we're thankful that Lord, we can hear
[1:03] the things that we're about to hear this
[1:05] morning. Be with everyone, the children
[1:08] in their class. May your hand of mercy
[1:11] and grace just touch their lives, Lord,
[1:14] that they would grow strong in grace and
[1:16] in you,
[1:18] Lord. Everyone that may be on the way
[1:20] and everything that would be said and
[1:21] done in this church this day, we pray,
[1:24] Father, that you'd pour your Holy Ghost
[1:27] out upon us. Lord, help us to see you
[1:30] more clearly and we'll give you all the
[1:32] praise and the glory for it in the name
[1:34] of Jesus Christ, we ask.
[1:37] Amen.
[1:39] We're going to be listening to what is
[1:41] the Holy Ghost given for. We'll start at
[1:44] paragraph 14. There'll be a scripture
[1:46] reading there. So, we'll remain standing
[1:49] until that's uh finished. This will be
[1:52] about 21 minutes long.
[1:56] Let us sing only believe.
[1:59] Only
[2:00] believe.
[2:04] Only
[2:06] believe
[2:10] all things are possible.
[2:16] Only
[2:18] believe.
[2:21] Only
[2:23] believe.
[2:27] Only
[2:29] believe.
[2:33] All things are possible.
[2:39] Only
[2:40] believe.
[2:48] Now you that's keeping these scriptures
[2:51] down, if you would turn with me to St.
[2:55] John again,
[2:58] the 14th chapter. We want to begin at
[3:01] the 14th chapter of St. John
[3:07] and let's start about the 14th verse.
[3:10] St. John 14:14
[3:14] and just read a portion of this
[3:15] scripture.
[3:18] Now, in this you will find much of the
[3:21] context that I want to speak on tonight.
[3:24] And remember you that have the red
[3:26] letter Bibles, it's in red. This is it's
[3:31] the words that Jesus himself spoke of.
[3:37] So therefore, we can rest assure that it
[3:40] will be just as he has said,
[3:43] heavens and earth will pass away, but
[3:46] his word shall never fail.
[3:52] Now we shall read from the 14th verse of
[3:55] the 14th chapter.
[3:58] If ye shall ask anything in my name, I
[4:03] will do it.
[4:06] What a blessed promise.
[4:10] If you love me, keep my commandments,
[4:14] and I will pray the Father, and he shall
[4:18] give you another comforter,
[4:21] that he may abide with you forever,
[4:28] even the Spirit of truth,
[4:31] whom the world cannot receive,
[4:35] because it seeth him God. Now you that
[4:41] would be reading from a Greek Bible
[4:43] would see it in your not see there means
[4:46] to understand
[4:48] for the world understandeth him not
[4:55] that is so true. Let me read it again
[4:58] now. Even the spirit of tr who the truth
[5:02] whom the world cannot receive because it
[5:06] seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye
[5:12] know him who the comfortermen
[5:17] for he dwelleth with you. Now present
[5:22] tense he dwelleth with you and shall be
[5:27] in you.
[5:30] What is it? The same comforter.
[5:35] &gt;&gt; I will not leave you comfortless. I
[5:39] Anyone knows that I is a personal
[5:42] pronoun? I will come to you.
[5:51] Yet a little while and the world seeth
[5:54] me no more.
[5:56] But ye shall But ye see me, because I
[6:02] live, ye shall live also.
[6:10] At that day you shall know that I am in
[6:14] my father
[6:16] and ye in me and I in you.
[6:21] There's going to be the center of my
[6:23] thought, but we're going to read a
[6:24] little farther. Let me read that also.
[6:27] Now again, at that day, the great day,
[6:32] the judgment day, that day ye shall know
[6:36] that I am in the father, and ye in me,
[6:41] and I in you.
[6:44] He that has my commandments
[6:47] and keepeth them, he it is that loveth
[6:51] me, and he that loveth me shall be loved
[6:55] of my father, and I will love him, and
[6:59] will manifest myself to him.
[7:04] Judas said unto him, not is a carrot,
[7:09] Lord, how is it that thou will manifest
[7:13] thyself to us and not to the world?
[7:18] That's cosmos, the world order. If you
[7:21] got a margin reading there, you'll
[7:23] notice mine's a G. And it says over
[7:25] here, cosmos are world system. That's
[7:28] churches and so forth.
[7:31] How is it that you'll manifest yourself
[7:34] to us and not to them? How can you do
[7:38] it?
[7:39] Jesus answered and said unto him, if a
[7:42] man love me, he will keep my words.
[7:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:51] and my father will love him and we will
[7:54] come
[7:57] unto him and make our abode with him.
[8:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:04] He that loveth me not
[8:07] keepeth not my sayings.
[8:11] You might keep the church's sayings, but
[8:13] keep his sayings. disease.
[8:15] &gt;&gt; And the words which ye hear is not mine,
[8:20] but the Father which sent me. These
[8:23] things have I spoken unto you, being yet
[8:26] present with you.
[8:29] But the comforter, which is the Holy
[8:31] Ghost, whom the Father will send in my
[8:35] name,
[8:38] he shall teach you all things
[8:41] and bring all these things, that's his
[8:44] words, to your remembrance, whatsoever I
[8:48] have said unto you.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; What purpose did God send the Holy
[8:54] Spirit?
[8:56] Amen.
[8:57] &gt;&gt; May he add his blessings to his word.
[9:01] Jesus said that at that day you'll know
[9:05] that I am in the father
[9:09] and the father is in me and you're I am
[9:13] in you and you are in me.
[9:16] Now, if we were going to say this,
[9:20] now remember this is going to be on
[9:25] tape.
[9:27] uh Christian businessman out of
[9:29] Louisville called me a while ago and he
[9:31] said, "It's a shame, Billy, that these
[9:35] messages, like you said last night,
[9:38] doesn't get to 40,000 here instead of
[9:42] 150 or 200, 300 people at your little
[9:45] tabernacle."
[9:46] I said, "Sir, in six months from now,
[9:50] Jesus carries the whole world around
[9:53] will hear this." Yeah,
[9:56] &gt;&gt; them tapes go all over the world,
[10:01] &gt;&gt; all around.
[10:04] And therefore, we are teaching here now
[10:09] just what we believe to be truth and
[10:12] what we have found out that God has
[10:15] confirmed it to us to be truth.
[10:19] Now the purpose, what was what was God's
[10:24] purpose in sending the Holy Spirit. Now
[10:28] I mark that down. John 14 beginning at
[10:31] the 14th verse and reading through the
[10:33] chapter for the basis.
[10:36] God's purpose we find here in sending
[10:39] the Holy Spirit was one purpose that God
[10:44] himself might dwell in his church and
[10:48] continue his plans through the church
[10:53] that God
[10:55] was in Christ
[10:58] continuing his plans through Christ out
[11:01] of Christ into the church continuing his
[11:05] work through the church. Now, we know
[11:08] what the Holy Spirit is. We found out
[11:10] last night that it's God.
[11:13] Now, when we think of God the Father as
[11:17] Jesus spoke of here, his father, God the
[11:21] Son
[11:22] as Jesus, God the Holy Spirit as what we
[11:26] call it today.
[11:29] Now that does not mean that there is
[11:31] three individual distinct gods.
[11:36] It means that there is one God
[11:40] in three offices.
[11:43] May we say it like this.
[11:46] All that
[11:49] God was,
[11:52] he poured into Christ
[11:56] because he emptied himself
[11:59] and poured it into Christ. And Christ
[12:03] was the fullness of the Godhead bodily.
[12:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:10] &gt;&gt; All that Jehovah was, he poured into
[12:13] Christ.
[12:15] And all that Christ was, he poured into
[12:19] the church.
[12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:21] &gt;&gt; Not into one individual, but into the
[12:23] entire body.
[12:26] There we come together in unity. We have
[12:28] power.
[12:31] All that God was was in Christ, and all
[12:34] that Christ was is in you.
[12:38] For God was made flesh and dwelt among
[12:41] us. 1 Timothy 3:16. If you're putting it
[12:44] down without controversy, great is the
[12:47] mystery of godliness, for God was
[12:50] manifested in the flesh.
[12:53] &gt;&gt; We handle him. God
[12:56] Jehovah made flesh and walked on the
[13:00] earth and we saw him with our eyes.
[13:03] You know in the same chapter of John 14,
[13:07] Philip said, "Lord, show us the father
[13:10] and it will satisfy us." Jesus said,
[13:14] "I've been so long with you, Philillip,
[13:16] and you don't know me."
[13:19] &gt;&gt; When you have seen me, you have seen the
[13:22] father.
[13:24] &gt;&gt; And why sayest thou unto me, "Show us
[13:26] the father."
[13:28] God was made flesh. Now, here it is.
[13:34] The Father was God over you. We're
[13:38] saying we've been since Adam.
[13:42] God the Father was over Moses and the
[13:46] children of Israel in a pillar of fire.
[13:50] Then God with us in Christ walk with us,
[13:55] talk with us, eat with us, slept with
[13:57] us.
[13:59] God over us,
[14:01] God with us, and now
[14:06] &gt;&gt; God in us.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; All God was coming to Christ, all Christ
[14:14] was coming into the church.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; What is it? God working in you.
[14:22] anywhere in the world and he'd want to
[14:24] call on you, you're right there working
[14:27] in you to do his good will.
[14:31] How we are to thank God for that.
[14:36] God, the Holy Spirit is sent for the
[14:41] purpose of God living in his church,
[14:47] moving through each age, working out his
[14:51] divine will.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:53] &gt;&gt; When man makes fun of you, they're not
[14:56] making fun of you. They're making fun of
[14:59] him that sent you.
[15:04] So Jesus said, "Blessed are ye when man
[15:08] shall say all manner of evil against you
[15:12] falsely for my name's sake.
[15:15] Blessed are you." And again, all that
[15:19] live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[15:22] persecutions.
[15:24] For when God made himself known in
[15:27] Christ, they hated him. Who hated him
[15:30] worse? the church.
[15:33] &gt;&gt; The church hated him worse. They hated
[15:36] him worse than the the drunkard.
[15:39] They hated him worse than all the other
[15:42] people. It was the church that hated
[15:45] him. So therefore, when you see cosmos,
[15:48] the world or the world know him not
[15:51] means the church socalled knew him not.
[15:56] He came to his own and his own received
[15:59] him not. But as many as did receive him,
[16:04] to them gave he the power to become sons
[16:07] of God.
[16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:09] &gt;&gt; To them that believed on his name. Oh,
[16:12] how we should love him and worship him.
[16:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. the purpose of God wanting to
[16:20] become
[16:21] in fellowship
[16:25] like before we leave that text let's use
[16:29] this in the days of Ruth in the law of
[16:34] redemption
[16:37] when Naom had left the country because
[16:39] of trial
[16:42] hard times
[16:44] she went into the Moanite land which
[16:47] were just lukewarm nominal Christians
[16:51] because the Moanites come from the
[16:54] daughter of Lot
[16:57] and they were so-called believers and
[16:59] mixed up
[17:02] and then her husband died and her two
[17:05] sons died and on the road home Noma
[17:12] Ruth and Neoma on her wrote home her one
[17:15] of her daughter-in-laws, Ora. She said
[17:18] that she would return back to her
[17:21] country, to her gods, and to her church,
[17:23] and to her people.
[17:26] And Noma tried to get uh Ruth to go
[17:30] back, but she said, "Your people are my
[17:35] people. Your God is my God.
[17:39] &gt;&gt; Where you die there, I'll die. Before
[17:42] you're buried there, I'll be buried
[17:45] &gt;&gt; and I'll not turn back.
[17:49] &gt;&gt; That's when a person's caught a vision.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; Don't make any difference whatever.
[17:54] People said, "You're going over there to
[17:55] become a holy roller or something." That
[17:57] didn't make any difference to Ruth.
[18:01] &gt;&gt; That was a purpose of God to be
[18:03] fulfilled.
[18:05] And just as sure as you're hungering
[18:08] tonight for the Holy Spirit, it's
[18:11] something in you pulling you that a
[18:13] purpose of God in your life has got to
[18:16] be fulfilled.
[18:19] &gt;&gt; Just like it was with Ruth. The story so
[18:22] beautiful. I just can't leave it for a
[18:24] moment.
[18:26] You know the law of redemption
[18:29] that when Boaz, you know the story of
[18:32] how Ruth gleaned in the field and found
[18:36] favor with Boaz and before he could
[18:39] marry her, he had to redeem
[18:44] all that Naom had lost.
[18:48] And the only one that could redeem Nom's
[18:52] fallen estate in the law of redemption
[18:56] was a near kinsman.
[19:00] Had to be kin folks
[19:03] before he could redeem.
[19:07] And that was her closest kin folks. and
[19:11] he had to make a public insign outside
[19:14] of the gate or a public confession
[19:18] that he had redeemed all that Neoma had
[19:21] lost.
[19:23] And Boaz did it by kicking off his shoe
[19:26] before the elders and said, "There's
[19:27] anybody here that's got anything that
[19:30] belongs to the
[19:33] I HAVE REDEEMED IT."
[19:39] And that's the way God did follow his
[19:42] own laws.
[19:44] God cannot follow give you one law to
[19:47] follow and him follow another.
[19:50] &gt;&gt; He follows his own laws.
[19:53] and God in order to redeem the lost
[19:57] church,
[20:00] &gt;&gt; the lost world, the lost creation,
[20:04] GOD WHO IS INFINITE IN spirit
[20:08] &gt;&gt; to redeem the lost
[20:12] human race,
[20:14] &gt;&gt; God himself become kin, folks,
[20:18] &gt;&gt; a man,
[20:20] &gt;&gt; a son
[20:22] that he created in the womb of Mary
[20:27] and THEN HE MADE AN IN sign or a
[20:30] testimony
[20:32] outside the gates of Jerusalem. He was
[20:35] lifted up between the heavens AND EARTH
[20:38] AND DIED AND REDEEMED EVERYTHING. AMEN.
[20:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; And in bleeding, he sanctified a church
[20:46] that he himself might live in and
[20:51] fellowship and commune with.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:54] &gt;&gt; That lost spot of fellowship from the
[20:58] Garden of Eden where God came down every
[21:00] evening, church time.
[21:04] Did you notice God came down in the cool
[21:07] of the day, the setting of the sun?
[21:11] There's something about when it starts
[21:12] to get night, people think of church and
[21:16] of God.
[21:18] Christians, you see the sun setting, you
[21:21] realize it's your sun is setting.
[21:24] And in the cool of evening, he come down
[21:26] and commune with them. And there
[21:30] he lost that fellowship because sin
[21:33] would not let him do it. And then he was
[21:35] made flesh and dwelt among us in order
[21:38] that he could come back again to man.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:43] &gt;&gt; And live in man
[21:47] AND RESTORE MAN
[21:51] TO A STATE OF COMMUNION WITH HIM AGAIN
[21:54] AND GIVE HIM BACK HIS GODGIVEN RIGHT.
[21:56] AMEN.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; That's what he did. That's the purpose
[22:01] of the Holy Ghost. It's the Father
[22:03] again.
[22:05] God the Father dwelling in you,
[22:10] working out his plans to finish his plan
[22:13] of redemption, working through you,
[22:18] making you a coworker with him,
[22:22] giving you a place,
[22:25] GIVING YOU A PART FOR YOUR FALLEN LOST
[22:29] BROTHER AND SISTER.
[22:33] GIVING YOU HIS SPIRIT AND his love
[22:37] to go hunt the lost as he did in the
[22:40] garden of Eden. Adam, Adam, where art
[22:42] thou?
[22:44] That's what the Holy Spirit does to a
[22:46] man or a woman. When it strikes into
[22:49] their heart and takes it bold, THERE'S A
[22:52] THIRST AND A HUNGRY for soft souls.
[22:56] &gt;&gt; That's what's the matter with the
[22:57] meetings today. There's not enough
[22:59] spirit touch in it.
[23:01] go for the souls of the lost
[23:04] &gt;&gt; and the dying.
[23:07] &gt;&gt; It's more to make a name or a church or
[23:10] a building or denomination
[23:12] instead of a soulwinning
[23:16] program.
[23:18] How pitiful. We just stay on it much.
[23:24] God poured himself into Christ. Correct.
[24:57] Hallelujah.
[25:25] Get away.
[25:58] Hallelujah.
[26:01] Hallelujah.
[26:21] Heat. Heat.
[26:44] to
[26:53] me.
[27:37] Hallelujah.
[28:00] Hallelujah.
[28:04] Glory.
[28:44] Hallelujah.
[29:17] Oh, shine
[29:20] on me.
[29:23] Let it shine
[29:26] on me.
[29:28] Let the light
[29:31] from the lighthouse
[29:35] shine
[29:37] on me.
[29:39] Let it shine
[29:42] on me.
[29:45] Let it shine
[29:48] on me.
[29:50] Let the light
[29:53] from the lighthouse
[29:57] shine. Let's sing that one more time.
[30:00] Oh, let it shine
[30:04] on me.
[30:07] Oh, shine
[30:10] on me.
[30:12] Let the light
[30:15] from the lighthouse
[30:18] shine
[30:20] on me.
[30:23] Let it shine
[30:26] on me.
[30:29] Shine
[30:31] on me.
[30:34] Let the light
[30:37] from the lighthouse
[30:40] shine
[30:42] on me.
[30:45] Amen. Let's stand together this morning.
[30:48] Let's sing this chorus together. Praise
[30:50] him. Praise him in the morning. Let's
[30:53] praise him.
[30:56] Praise him. Oh, praise him in the
[31:01] morning.
[31:02] Praise him in the new time.
[31:06] Praise him.
[31:09] Praise
[31:10] him.
[31:12] Praise him. When the sun goes down,
[31:17] I'm going to serve him. I will serve
[31:23] him. I will serve him in the morning.
[31:27] And I'll serve him in the new time.
[31:32] Serve him.
[31:34] Serve him.
[31:38] Serve him. When the sun goes down, I'm
[31:42] going to love him. I will love him.
[31:47] Love him. I love him in the morning.
[31:54] Love him in the new time.
[31:58] Love him.
[32:01] Love him.
[32:03] Love him when the sun goes down.
[32:10] And we can't sing that and say we love
[32:12] him if we don't love each other. So
[32:14] shake hands with those around you this
[32:15] morning. Make them feel welcome this
[32:17] morning. Sing it one more time. I'll
[32:20] praise him. Praise him. I will praise
[32:26] him in the morning.
[32:28] Praise him in the new time.
[32:32] Praise him.

[34:49] Lord, standing in the need of prayer.
[34:52] Amen. I'm here. I want a closer walk
[34:54] with him. Just trust that we gather
[34:58] together this morning. It's not just a
[35:00] another time that we see each other and
[35:04] check the box, but we draw closer to him

[35:34] you must fight or keep on the firing
[35:39] line.

[35:58] Keep on the fire and light.
[36:03] Oh, you must fight. Be brave against all
[36:08] evil.

[36:19] righteous, keep on the firing line.
[36:26] God will only use the soldier he can't
[36:30] rush. So keep on the fire and light.

[36:39] cross, you must
[36:42] keep on the firing line.
[36:47] And life is but to labor for the master
[36:51] dear.
[36:53] Help to banish evil and to spread good
[36:57] cheer. Great you'll be rewarded for your
[37:02] service here. So keep on the fire line.

[37:14] evil.
[37:16] Never run or even lag behind.
[37:21] If you would win for God and the
[37:25] righteous, keep on the fire line.
[37:32] Oh, and when we get to heaven, brother,
[37:35] we'll be glad.

[37:43] I will praise the Savior for the call we
[37:47] had. So keep on the firing line.
[37:54] And when we see the souls that we have
[37:57] helped to win,
[38:00] leading them to Jesus from the path of
[38:04] sin
[38:05] with a shout of welcome, we'll all march
[38:09] in. Oh, so keep on the firing line.
[38:15] Oh, you must fight. Be brave against all

[38:59] time.
[39:02] We've got the power
[39:08] in the name of Jesus.
[39:13] We've got the power
[39:19] in the name of the Lord.
[39:25] Though Satan raes,
[39:30] will not be defeated.
[39:36] We've got the power
[39:41] in the name of the Lord. Let's sing that
[39:44] one more time.
[39:46] Yes, we've got the power
[39:52] in the name of Jesus.
[39:58] We've got the power
[40:03] in the name of the Lord.
[40:10] Though Satan raes,
[40:15] we will not be defeated.

[40:26] in the name of the Lord.
[40:32] Amen. Let's sing that song. He paid a
[40:34] debt he did not owe.
[40:38] He paid a debt he did not owe. I owed a
[40:45] debt I could not pay. I needed
[40:50] someone
[40:53] to wash my sins away.
[40:59] And now I sing a brand new song.
[41:05] Amazing
[41:07] grace all the day long. Christ Jesus
[41:13] paid a debt that I could never pay. He
[41:18] paid a debt on Calvary.
[41:21] He paid a debt on Calary.
[41:27] He cleansed my soul and he set me free.
[41:32] I'm glad that Jesus
[41:37] did all. Aren't you thankful for that
[41:39] this morning? Now we can sing that brand
[41:42] new song. Now we can sing a brand new
[41:47] song. It's amazing
[41:50] grace all the day long. Christ Jesus
[41:57] paid a debt
[41:59] I could never pay. One day he's coming
[42:03] back for me. One day he's coming back
[42:09] for me. Oh, I'll live with him
[42:13] eternally.
[42:16] Won't it be glory? Oh, just to see him
[42:22] on that day.
[42:27] I then will sing a brand new song.
[42:32] Amazing
[42:34] grace all day long. Christ Jesus
[42:40] paid a debt that I could never pay.
[42:49] And he is here.
[42:54] Hallelu
[42:58] He is here.
[43:02] Amen.
[43:06] He is here.
[43:10] Holy,
[43:12] holy,
[43:14] I will bless
[43:18] his name again.
[43:22] He is
[43:24] here.
[43:27] Just listen closely.
[43:30] Hear him calling
[43:34] out
[43:36] your name.
[43:38] He is here.
[43:42] You can touch him. You will never
[43:50] be the same.
[43:53] Yes, he
[43:55] is here.
[43:59] Hallelujah.
[44:03] He is here.
[44:06] Amen.
[44:09] He is here.
[44:13] Holy,
[44:15] holy,
[44:19] I will bless his name
[44:23] again.
[44:25] He is here.
[44:30] Listen closely.
[44:33] Just hear him calling
[44:36] out
[44:38] your name.
[44:40] He is here.
[44:45] You can touch him. You will never
[44:52] be
[44:54] the same.
[44:59] prisoners chains
[45:03] and bleeding stri.
[45:17] And in their pain
[45:21] they began to sing.
[45:26] Their chains were loosed
[45:31] and they were free.
[45:36] I bless your name.
[45:40] I bless your name.
[45:45] I give you honor.
[45:50] Give you praise.
[45:54] You are the light,
[45:59] the truth, the way.
[46:04] I bless your name.
[46:08] I bless your name. And some midnight
[46:12] hour,
[46:13] some midnight hour.
[46:18] If you should find
[46:23] You're in a prison
[46:28] in your mind.
[46:32] Reach out and praise.
[46:37] You defy those chains
[46:42] and they will fall
[46:46] in Jesus name.
[46:50] name.
[46:51] I bless your name.
[46:56] I bless your name.
[47:01] I give you honor.
[47:07] Give you praise.
[47:11] You are the life,
[47:15] the truth, the way.
[47:20] I bless your name.
[47:25] I bless your name. Your name is Jesus.
[47:30] Your name is Jesus.
[47:36] It's Jesus.
[47:41] Jesus.
[47:46] Jesus.
[47:51] Jesus.
[47:55] Jesus.
[47:59] I bless your name.
[48:03] I bless your name.
[48:15] I was sitting alone and wondering
[48:19] about what I'm supposed to do.
[48:24] I can't deny the times I've made
[48:28] mistakes. I can't hide from him. He
[48:32] knew.
[48:34] But I knew that deep within my soul I
[48:38] felt sorry. Honest I do.
[48:43] So I just cried and said forgive me Lord
[48:48] forgive me again. Will you?
[48:53] Oh justify.
[48:58] Oh justified.
[49:02] I never did it in the first place.
[49:08] Justified.
[49:12] Justified.
[49:16] Oh, justified.
[49:21] Never did it in the first place. Or
[49:26] justified.
[49:31] So often I am discouraged
[49:35] when I count the times I fall.
[49:40] Cuz he promised I'd be victorious
[49:44] when I know I'm not at all.
[49:49] Then I heard an eagle scream.
[49:53] His voice quickened
[49:56] my soul. You said you never did it in
[50:00] the first place. You're justified.
[50:06] You are justified.
[50:11] You're justified.
[50:15] You never did it in the first place.
[50:20] You're justified.
[50:25] You're justified.
[50:29] You are justified. Let's stand as we
[50:32] sing the last verse as the brothers come
[50:33] for the offering. Never did it in the
[50:37] first place. You're justified. He looked
[50:40] at your perfect picture.
[50:44] Well, he looked at your perfect picture
[50:48] without blame, spot, or wrinkle.
[50:52] He didn't look at you from where you are
[50:56] now. He looked from eternity.
[51:01] He said, "You're just trapped in that
[51:04] body. You by past your theophony.
[51:10] You never did it in the first place.
[51:15] You're justified.
[51:19] Yes, you're justified.
[51:23] You are justified.
[51:28] You never did it in the first place.
[51:33] You're justified.
[51:37] You're justified.
[51:42] You're justified.
[51:46] You never did it in the first place.
[51:51] You're justified.
[51:55] Amen. Aren't you thankful for that this
[51:56] morning? And God bless you, saints. Good
[51:58] to be in church with each one this
[52:00] morning. For Sunday school, we had 11
[52:02] children, nine Bibles, $6 in offering.
[52:05] So, we're thankful for that this
[52:07] morning. Thankful to have the Baggots
[52:08] and Brother Judah kind of filling in
[52:10] some seats or a row, an entire row for
[52:12] us this morning. We're missing some. So
[52:14] we certainly want to be in prayer for
[52:15] those missing. Also Matt and CJ helping
[52:18] finish out the King aisle there. So sure
[52:22] love and appreciate them this morning.
[52:23] So remember those not able to be with us
[52:25] or some children and camp and things.
[52:28] Also our precious sister Ellie Troutman
[52:30] is not feeling well this morning. So I
[52:32] want to remember her or elders and maybe
[52:34] you've got something on your heart.
[52:36] Brother John was singing earlier. Lord
[52:39] help me this morning. So just bring that
[52:41] before our prayer answering God
[52:43] together. Dear Lord, we're very thankful
[52:45] and happy to be in the house of the Lord
[52:47] today with like-minded believers, Lord,
[52:51] that believe every word of the prophet
[52:52] has spoken. And so, Lord, may we not
[52:55] just be hearers only, but doers of this
[52:58] great Bible. We know we will make
[53:00] mistakes, Lord, each and every day. We
[53:02] just cry out for the blood of Jesus,
[53:03] Lord, that we could be justified,
[53:05] though, as we never did it in the first
[53:08] place. My my Lord, so thankful. Thankful
[53:11] brother for Israel, Sister Sharon, and
[53:13] the Po family, Lord, and their talents
[53:15] and their burden for the loss this
[53:17] morning. And we share that burden, Lord,
[53:19] and and just hold them up. We know that
[53:22] brother Israel, Lord, you will be
[53:24] speaking, Lord, to us. May our hearts
[53:26] and our ears be open. And we cry out,
[53:29] Lord, for our loved ones, those that are
[53:30] still maybe wandering or unsure or
[53:33] doubtful. Lord, drive away that doubt.
[53:36] comfort, Lord, the feeblehearted, Lord,
[53:38] and those that are seeking, Lord, you
[53:41] said that they would be able to find
[53:42] you. And so, we pray that and just hold
[53:46] out our loved ones and and that last one
[53:48] that might come in, Lord, here this very
[53:50] day. We're looking for a looking for a
[53:52] rapture, Lord, looking for the saints to
[53:54] arise at any moment. Just cry out that
[53:56] you would come and we could overcome,
[53:59] Lord, by our testimony, the word of the
[54:01] Lord, and by the blood of the lamb this
[54:03] morning. Thank you for brother John the
[54:05] worship Lord. We commit it all the
[54:07] offering the ties to your mighty
[54:08] kingdom. In the name of our Lord and
[54:10] Savior, the precious Lord Jesus Christ.
[54:12] All God's people say amen.
[54:23] God
[54:25] Almighty.
[54:30] He's the prince
[54:32] of peace.
[54:38] Trles
[54:40] manage
[54:46] hearts unended.
[54:54] It's the presence
[55:01] of the king.
[55:07] Amen. You can be seated.
[55:11] Brother Joe welcomed Judah this morning.
[55:15] This is Judah Dodd visiting with us this
[55:17] morning and uh told he has a song. So,
[55:21] brother Judah, you playing for your
[55:22] yourself this morning? Yes. So, maybe we
[55:26] could just uh sing that chorus we were
[55:28] just singing. We can sing it ac capella
[55:30] if you start me out in the in the right
[55:32] notes, Sister Sharon. But just was
[55:34] thinking of the words of that song. In
[55:35] his presence, troubles vanish. Hearts
[55:38] are mended when we're in the presence of
[55:39] the king. And you know, we sometimes get
[55:43] sidetracked and we focus on how big our
[55:45] problem is instead of how big our God
[55:47] is.
[55:49] And this isn't just his presence
[55:51] hopefully when we get together, but I
[55:53] want to live continuously in his
[55:55] presence. And let's just try to block
[55:59] everything out as we sing there. Just
[56:01] shut your eyes and just don't think
[56:04] about the problems that we don't have
[56:06] because we don't have any. So he said,
[56:07] "Cast all of your cares unto me. I care
[56:10] about you." So if we truly do that, let
[56:12] go. Let God have them. Our troubles
[56:15] troubles will vanish. Hearts will be
[56:17] mended.
[56:19] in the presence
[56:27] of Jehovah
[56:35] God Almighty.
[56:40] You're my praise, my praise.
[56:45] Peace.
[56:51] from those manage
[56:58] hearts are binding
[57:06] in the presence
[57:14] of the
[57:45] You're Praise
[57:47] the
[57:54] tres.
[58:34] When I think of how he came so far from
[58:39] glory.
[58:42] He came to dwell among the lonely
[58:47] such as I
[58:51] to suffer shame and such disgrace
[58:56] on Mount Calary. Take my place.
[59:00] Then I ask myself this question. Who am
[59:06] I?
[59:10] Who am I that the king would bleed and
[59:16] die for?
[59:21] Who am I that he would pray? Not my will
[59:26] thine, Lord.
[59:30] The answer I may never know.
[59:36] know why he'd ever love me so.
[59:41] When I owe to an old rugged cross, he
[59:45] would go for who am I?
[59:52] When I'm reminded of his words, I'll
[59:58] leave you never.
[1:00:02] If you be true, I'll give to you a life
[1:00:08] forever
[1:00:10] and forever.
[1:00:12] I wonder what I could have done.
[1:00:18] To deserve God's only son.
[1:00:23] He'd fight my battles until they're won.
[1:00:27] For who am I? Sing it with me if you
[1:00:30] know it.
[1:00:33] Who am I that the king would bleed and
[1:00:39] die?
[1:00:43] And who am I that he would pray? Not my
[1:00:49] will. Thine, Lord.
[1:00:54] The answer I may never know.
[1:00:59] Why he ever loved me so
[1:01:04] that to an old rugged cross he'd go for
[1:01:09] who am I?
[1:01:13] Oh, who am I that the king would bleed
[1:01:20] and die for?
[1:01:25] Where am I that ye would pray? Not my
[1:01:30] will th
[1:01:35] answer I may never know.
[1:01:40] Why he ever loved me so
[1:01:44] that to an old rugged cross he'd go for
[1:01:49] who am I?
[1:01:53] That to an old rugged cross he go for
[1:01:59] who am I?
[1:02:13] Amen. You can remain seated. It
[1:02:16] need to welcome Sister Po back. We sure
[1:02:18] missed her when she was gone. Appreciate
[1:02:20] all she does here.
[1:02:26] Amen. Maybe we could just as we change
[1:02:28] the order of the service sing that hymn
[1:02:30] together. Have thine own way, Lord. Have
[1:02:32] thine own way.
[1:02:34] Thou art the potter.
[1:02:36] I am the clay.
[1:02:39] Have thine own way,
[1:02:44] Lord.
[1:02:47] Have thine own way.
[1:02:55] Thou art the potter.
[1:03:04] I am
[1:03:06] the clay.
[1:03:12] Mold me and make
[1:03:17] me
[1:03:20] after
[1:03:22] thy will.
[1:03:29] I am waiting
[1:03:36] yielded
[1:03:39] and still the last verse. Have thine own
[1:03:42] way, Lord. Yes. Have thine
[1:03:47] own way,
[1:03:50] Lord.
[1:03:53] Have thine own way.
[1:04:01] Just hold on my be
[1:04:10] absolute
[1:04:12] sway.
[1:04:15] How many can say this is your desire
[1:04:16] this morning? Fill with thy spirit
[1:04:26] till all shall see.
[1:04:34] Christy,
[1:04:37] always
[1:04:43] living
[1:04:45] in me.
[1:05:01] Heat. Heat.
[1:05:41] Heat. Heat.
[1:05:54] God bless you. Let us let us pray. Lord
[1:05:58] Jesus,
[1:05:59] we ask your blessings on this service
[1:06:01] this morning, Lord, as we take your word
[1:06:05] and uh Lord, go into it. May you
[1:06:08] minister to our hearts what we have need
[1:06:11] of. Lord, I pray that you'll touch us,
[1:06:13] Lord. Father, move away all the unbelief
[1:06:17] and the cares of life and let us come
[1:06:20] into your presence, Lord, and the
[1:06:23] presence of the word. Bless us, Father,
[1:06:26] as we commit our ways to you and these
[1:06:32] folks that have gathered in your name.
[1:06:34] May they each one receive their portion,
[1:06:36] Lord. And may it be said when they leave
[1:06:39] from here, it was good for us to be in
[1:06:41] the house of the Lord. Oh God, bless the
[1:06:44] saints in Mesa this morning for the art
[1:06:46] of the Stevie and the faithful few
[1:06:49] there. We just commit all in your in
[1:06:53] your hands in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[1:06:57] God bless you saints. So good to be in
[1:06:59] house of the Lord with you this morning.
[1:07:01] Amen.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen?
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Trying to find out what kind of service
[1:07:08] this is going to be.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Welcome. It's good to see
[1:07:13] the Baggots and then the brother and the
[1:07:16] Bowmans some of his family there. God
[1:07:19] bless them and each of you. We like to
[1:07:21] go right into the word and so happy to
[1:07:23] have sister Sharon back with us. Amen.
[1:07:26] And so
[1:07:28] um we'll have you stand to your feet
[1:07:37] and all those that were traveling that
[1:07:39] are have returned. We thank the Lord for
[1:07:42] you. Amen. In the scripture in
[1:07:45] Revelations chapter 3
[1:08:02] verse number seven, the scripture says
[1:08:06] this here.
[1:08:10] And to the angel of the church of
[1:08:12] Philadelphia, write these things saith,
[1:08:14] he that is holy, he that is true, he
[1:08:18] that hath the key of David, he that
[1:08:20] openeth and no man shutth, and shutth
[1:08:24] and no man openeth. I know thy works.
[1:08:28] Behold, I have set before thee an open
[1:08:31] door. I have set before thee an open
[1:08:34] door.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; And no man can shut it. Amen.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; For thou hast a little strength, and
[1:08:40] hast kept my word, and has not denied my
[1:08:44] name.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Behold, I would make them of the
[1:08:46] synagogue of Satan, which say they are
[1:08:49] Jews, and are not, but do lie. Behold, I
[1:08:53] would make them come and worship before
[1:08:55] thy feet, and to know that I have loved
[1:08:58] thee. Because thou hast kept the word of
[1:09:01] my patience, I also will keep thee from
[1:09:05] the hour of temptation, which shall come
[1:09:08] upon all the world to try them that
[1:09:12] dwell upon the earth. Amen. We'll take
[1:09:15] one more scripture. 2 Thessalonians
[1:09:18] chapter 2.
[1:09:30] Certain I won't be able to finish the
[1:09:32] entire message today
[1:09:34] but we'll do the best we can. 2
[1:09:36] Thessalonians chapter 2
[1:09:40] number 1 to3. Now we beseech you,
[1:09:44] brethren, by the coming of our Lord
[1:09:46] Jesus Christ, and by our gathering
[1:09:48] together unto him, that you, ye, be not
[1:09:53] soon shaken in mind, or be troubled,
[1:09:57] neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by
[1:10:02] letter, as from us, as that the day of
[1:10:05] Christ is at hand. Let no man deceive
[1:10:08] you by any means, for that day shall not
[1:10:12] come except there come a falling away
[1:10:14] first and that man of sin be revealed,
[1:10:18] the son of predition. Amen. We're going
[1:10:22] to take a few moments and I'll give this
[1:10:24] message a title. Um, the greatest of all
[1:10:27] revelations.
[1:10:29] The greatest of all revelations.
[1:10:32] And as you're standing, I'll read a
[1:10:34] quotation of the prophet here in the
[1:10:38] Patmas vision. And he says this here. I
[1:10:42] think I have it.
[1:10:47] Paragraph 132. The greatest of all
[1:10:50] revelations is the deity.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; The supreme deity of our Lord Jesus
[1:10:56] Christ. Who can't you can't get to first
[1:10:59] race until you believe that. That's what
[1:11:02] Peter said. Repent and then see the
[1:11:05] deity. We baptize in the name of Jesus
[1:11:08] Christ for the remission of your sins.
[1:11:11] And then you're ready to go in the
[1:11:12] spirit. The first thing you have to know
[1:11:15] is the deity of Christ. I am Alpha and
[1:11:19] Omega. I am from A to Z. There's no more
[1:11:22] but me. I was at the beginning. I'll be
[1:11:26] at the end. I'm he that was, which is,
[1:11:29] and shall come. the Almighty. Think of
[1:11:33] it. That's what the trumpet said.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; May God bless you. You may be seated.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; And in the presence of the Lord. Now,
[1:11:44] this um great falling away that we know
[1:11:47] the scriptures has prophesied for it to
[1:11:51] come. And I kind of uh apologize for
[1:11:55] some of the saints in Mesa because a lot
[1:11:57] of this is a repeat from Thursday night.
[1:12:00] But I did just felt really impressed to
[1:12:03] bring that again
[1:12:05] to the church this morning on
[1:12:09] the greatest of all revelations and this
[1:12:12] great falling away that we see
[1:12:15] happening. The scripture said it would
[1:12:17] come and we see it taking place right
[1:12:20] before our eyes. And what is the falling
[1:12:23] away?
[1:12:25] um who's the cause of the falling away
[1:12:29] and what are they falling away from?
[1:12:33] What is the falling away? Who's the
[1:12:34] cause of it? And what actually are they
[1:12:37] falling away from? Now, Brother Brandham
[1:12:39] takes the message the angel of the Lord
[1:12:41] 1951 and he says this here and as
[1:12:45] atheistism
[1:12:48] is on the march and so forth and the
[1:12:51] churches are falling away and getting
[1:12:54] formal.
[1:12:56] Let me say this to you my dear brother
[1:12:58] and sister. If you receive me as your
[1:13:00] brother, we need a revival.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, what I like to do, and I
[1:13:06] mentioned this on Wednesday, you know, I
[1:13:09] have something on my heart, something I
[1:13:10] think about, uh, a thought. I like to go
[1:13:14] and see what the prophet says about it.
[1:13:17] I like to see what the Bible says about
[1:13:18] it. And that's where I get my opinions
[1:13:21] from. Hopefully, I trust the Lord that
[1:13:23] all my opinions come from his word.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; And so, as I was looking at this falling
[1:13:29] away, I have a thought. The internet has
[1:13:32] a thought. Everybody has a thought. But
[1:13:34] God has a thought too.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; And God has spoken to us in this day.
[1:13:38] And why search running around trying to
[1:13:41] find an answer when God has given us the
[1:13:44] greatest? He's given us the answer
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; when he gave us his word.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; So I go through the message and I see
[1:13:50] what this falling away is. And here uh
[1:13:54] in 1951, brother Random is talking about
[1:13:57] this falling away. And he gets into how
[1:14:00] it's falling away from the spirit.
[1:14:04] You're getting formal. He says, he moves
[1:14:07] forward in the message 1952
[1:14:10] and he says this here, paragraph number
[1:14:13] 14,
[1:14:15] make the valley full of ditches. The
[1:14:17] hour has come for falling away of the
[1:14:20] church. The hour has come that religion
[1:14:24] would spread the world without
[1:14:25] salvation. form of godliness denying the
[1:14:29] power thereof. The hour has come. The
[1:14:32] hour has come for your church to rise.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; This hour has to come for uh raise out
[1:14:40] of the dust and shake herself and come
[1:14:43] to herself and realize positionally that
[1:14:47] she is a church of the living God and
[1:14:50] has rights over every every redemptive
[1:14:53] blessing that you promise to her.
[1:14:57] They're hers tonight.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; God, the hour has come.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Now grant it, Lord.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:07] Here the prophet continues in 1954, the
[1:15:09] mark of the beast. And he says this,
[1:15:14] Paul said that that day should not come
[1:15:16] unless there come a falling away first
[1:15:18] and the man of sin be revealed. Now
[1:15:21] watch. He declares him to be a man. Is
[1:15:24] that right? Paul said he was the man of
[1:15:27] sin who opposes himself all above all
[1:15:31] that's called God. So he that he so
[1:15:37] so he that is worshiped as God a man
[1:15:41] worshiped as God a man that would be put
[1:15:45] here as a form of worship. And he said
[1:15:48] that day could not come except first
[1:15:50] there come a falling away. What is it a
[1:15:55] lukewarm condition of the church?
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I like us to really
[1:16:02] internalize the quotations.
[1:16:05] And sometimes we think of the church, we
[1:16:07] think of the church, all of the
[1:16:09] believers. But I want you to look at the
[1:16:11] church as yourself. And when he's
[1:16:13] talking about a falling away from a
[1:16:15] lukew from into a lukewarm condition,
[1:16:18] you have to ask yourself the question,
[1:16:20] am I falling away into a lukewarm
[1:16:23] condition? Me personally, because that's
[1:16:26] really the only part that matters is how
[1:16:30] it affects me personally.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is it? A lukewarm
[1:16:36] condition of the church. All right. How
[1:16:40] many you know this age was prophesied to
[1:16:43] fall into a lukewarm condition?
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Lukewarm so much God so much not just a
[1:16:49] lukewarm not hot not cold but just like
[1:16:53] a a lukewarm
[1:16:55] condition and it actually makes God
[1:16:57] sick.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[1:17:01] The handwriting on the wall. The prophet
[1:17:03] of God says this here in 1958.
[1:17:06] No wonder there's a falling away. And
[1:17:09] what does the pastors know? They don't
[1:17:12] know what the cause of it. They are the
[1:17:15] cause of it.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Who's the cause of it?
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; The prophet said that. Now,
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; so there's a reason why there's a
[1:17:25] falling away.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; The Bible said there would be a falling
[1:17:29] away. The scripture shows us that
[1:17:31] they're falling away from the word, from
[1:17:33] Christ. We know Christ is the word. They
[1:17:35] fall away from the Holy Spirit. But
[1:17:37] there's a reason why people fall away.
[1:17:40] And that falling away, the prophet tells
[1:17:42] us the pastors are the cause of it.
[1:17:46] Prophet continues in the message,
[1:17:48] discerning the body of the Lord, and he
[1:17:52] says this here.
[1:17:55] Amen.
[1:17:58] Let's uh move from that one. We'll take
[1:18:01] this next one here. The testimony of a
[1:18:03] true witness 1961 paragraph 224.
[1:18:08] The messenger says this here. Now being
[1:18:11] that he said that we are his witnesses.
[1:18:14] Amen. In closing, listen close. Put on
[1:18:18] your understanding now and listen as I
[1:18:20] close. We are his witnesses
[1:18:25] who have received of his spirit. His
[1:18:28] word testifies
[1:18:30] in the last days that there will come a
[1:18:33] falling away and there will come up a
[1:18:36] cold formal powerless church age. That's
[1:18:41] what we're living in. A church that had
[1:18:44] no power.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Having a form of godliness but denying
[1:18:49] the power thereof from such turn away.
[1:18:52] He gave the sign that there would be
[1:18:55] times when a man would sit in the temple
[1:18:57] of God showing himself he was God. He
[1:19:00] come ruling the nation. How perfectly
[1:19:03] all these things. So we see there's the
[1:19:07] the prophecy of 2 Thessalonians chapter
[1:19:10] 2 that there would come this great
[1:19:13] falling away and that the man of sin
[1:19:15] would would reveal himself. The
[1:19:18] scripture calls him a man. But the
[1:19:20] warning was, brethren, don't be soon
[1:19:24] shaken. Don't be bothered by it. Don't
[1:19:28] worry. It's going to happen. But take
[1:19:30] your stand with the word of the Lord.
[1:19:33] Anyways, he says that you be not soon
[1:19:38] shaken in mind or be troubled, neither
[1:19:42] by spirit nor by word nor by letter.
[1:19:46] Brother um Edward Mcfatin sent a text to
[1:19:50] the uh to the group to the to the board
[1:19:53] text one that I I love and I don't have
[1:19:58] it in front of me but I see I do and um
[1:20:03] but brother Bham in that quote is
[1:20:06] talking about it's in the church age
[1:20:08] book and he's talking about how
[1:20:10] nervousness
[1:20:12] would um now
[1:20:16] h have a place in um I won't take time
[1:20:21] to get it but he identifies that this
[1:20:24] age will be a nervous age and he
[1:20:27] identifies that you know the the the
[1:20:30] hour that you and I are living in and if
[1:20:34] there ever was a time that people are
[1:20:36] more shaky more unstable than ever
[1:20:39] before we see it
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; we see people that we have put a lot of
[1:20:43] confidence in
[1:20:45] unright lightly, but we've done it. And
[1:20:47] they have shaken and they've fallen
[1:20:50] away. And when we see that, it hurts our
[1:20:54] faith in the entire process. We say,
[1:20:59] "How could he? How could she is standing
[1:21:02] so firm and they fall into this?" Well,
[1:21:05] the problem is when you get your eyes on
[1:21:07] men or people or groups, they will
[1:21:11] always disappoint you. There is no
[1:21:13] perfect group of people that are not
[1:21:16] going to disappoint you.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Starting with looking in the mirror.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; You look in the mirror, you will
[1:21:22] disappoint yourself.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; And everybody around you will disappoint
[1:21:26] you in groups and churches and people
[1:21:28] that should be stable. People you should
[1:21:31] be able to depend on. They're being
[1:21:34] shaken on every on every hand. But the
[1:21:36] scripture tells us to not to be so soon
[1:21:40] shaken in mind. Don't worry about what
[1:21:43] text or email comes by letter. Don't
[1:21:46] worry about what the internet or what
[1:21:48] the groups are doing and what everybody
[1:21:50] else is doing because the man of sin
[1:21:53] must be revealed.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; And I'm warning you of what that is. And
[1:21:57] here the prophet now shows us that it's
[1:22:00] a falling away into a lukewarm
[1:22:03] condition.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; If there ever was a lazy age or lazy
[1:22:08] spirit, it's this age here. can't pray
[1:22:12] like we should. Won't dig down deep like
[1:22:16] we should. We want everything given to
[1:22:19] us without any work, without any toil,
[1:22:22] without any suffering. But this is not a
[1:22:25] gimmick. This is not a prize that you
[1:22:28] win. This is not a lottery. This is not
[1:22:30] gambling.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; God has a purpose and a plan for your
[1:22:35] life.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; There is no golden ticket.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; THERE IS NO GOLDEN SERVICE. THAT'S GOING
[1:22:41] TO MAKE YOU A BELIEVER.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD BY HIS GRACE,
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; he builds you,
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; HE BUILDS YOU
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; FROM ONE SEED AT A TIME.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; ONE LITTLE SEED DROPS INTO THE GROUND
[1:22:56] AND THAT SEED BEGINS TO GROW AND IT
[1:22:59] BEGINS TO PUT ON BARK AND PUT ON LEAVES
[1:23:02] AND PUT ON ALL OF THE FRUITS. IT'S GOD'S
[1:23:06] PURPOSE. IT'S HOW HE DOES. AMEN.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; HE'S A MASTER BUILDER.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; AND YOU CAN'T MAKE GOD RUSH.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; You can't make God move.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; He has a time.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; HE HAS A PLAN. HE HAS A PROCESS.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; We were in this message here. I was
[1:23:32] listening to this message in um
[1:23:37] um
[1:23:39] I think it was surges at the time
[1:23:43] and the prophet was talking about
[1:23:47] that
[1:23:49] he's never produced uh um
[1:23:54] he he said he he's never um
[1:23:58] he wasn't into the gimmicks.
[1:24:01] He said, "I've not produced to you a
[1:24:03] gimmick."
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; And he makes this statement here.
[1:24:08] Let's see if I can find it. I got to get
[1:24:10] it.
[1:24:13] And sir, is this the time? He says this
[1:24:16] here. Let's see if I can.
[1:24:19] Is this the end of time, sir?
[1:24:24] Lord, help me.
[1:24:27] I just failed to read this one for you.
[1:24:29] Um,
[1:24:34] oh my.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Take my time."
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, whoever said that.
[1:24:46] I need a break up here, sir. All right.
[1:24:51] I can't get it.
[1:24:56] But he he said he he he never produced
[1:24:59] to the world a gimmick. He says, "Many
[1:25:02] of you have come to me with dreams and
[1:25:05] the Lord has um
[1:25:09] has revealed them." And then he says,
[1:25:11] "Many of you have come to me with dreams
[1:25:14] and visions and the Lord has never
[1:25:16] showed it to me."
[1:25:18] And I thought that really stood out very
[1:25:20] nicely that not every single dream, not
[1:25:24] every single trouble or problem we have
[1:25:27] has an answer to it.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; There is there is what God has for us. I
[1:25:34] have to read that for you because it's
[1:25:35] in my mind to read it for you. So let me
[1:25:38] get it for you. All right.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; 72
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; 72.
[1:25:45] You guys have it. They have it.
[1:25:47] Paragraph 72. Thank you.
[1:25:50] Paragraph 71. We'll start up there.
[1:25:52] Thank you, brother. And now I do not
[1:25:55] believe that there's anything he has
[1:25:57] spoken all these years my life that I've
[1:25:59] spoke to the people, but what come to
[1:26:02] pass? And many people has come to me
[1:26:04] with dreams that he's let me by his
[1:26:07] grace interpret for the people. And many
[1:26:10] has come with dreams and with problems
[1:26:13] that I was unable to interpret.
[1:26:16] But I haven't tried to introduce to a
[1:26:18] people a gimmick that has all the
[1:26:21] answers. I've tried to be honest and to
[1:26:24] tell you what was truth. And I can only
[1:26:27] tell you as he told me then as it come
[1:26:30] to me then I could tell you. That was so
[1:26:34] beautiful to see that even the prophet
[1:26:37] of God's ministry, there were people
[1:26:39] that came to him with dreams, with
[1:26:43] problems, and he couldn't give them the
[1:26:45] answer because he would have to receive
[1:26:48] that answer, that interpretation, and
[1:26:50] then give it to the people.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; And my mind went to Sister Edith, right?
[1:26:56] We all know Hattie, right?
[1:26:58] Sister Hadtie received that great power
[1:27:01] of the third pool manifested in her in
[1:27:04] her little home there.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; A tremendous example.
[1:27:08] But and when that power came down,
[1:27:10] Brother Vanov says, "Oh, just any moment
[1:27:12] now, Edith will be walking."
[1:27:16] And so I just start to look at sister
[1:27:17] Edith's little testimony there. And I
[1:27:20] used to have an article. Someone gave it
[1:27:22] to me. I can't remember but it was
[1:27:24] sister Hattie Wright had moer testimony
[1:27:27] about brother Brandham and maybe it's in
[1:27:30] the generations book or I had it and she
[1:27:33] was talking about her sister Edith how
[1:27:35] she could thread a needle with with a
[1:27:38] button with she use her little tongue
[1:27:40] and just do it so fast so quick. How
[1:27:41] many's ever heard that something?
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. How many's heard that besides
[1:27:46] Jonathan? No one's heard that. I maybe
[1:27:47] I'll get it some other time. Anyways,
[1:27:50] they were they were friends with the
[1:27:52] with the Brandham. Brother Brandham was
[1:27:53] friends with their family and she they
[1:27:58] are one of the oldest families that were
[1:28:00] in brother Brandham's ministry 25 plus
[1:28:03] years in with him. They're mentioned on
[1:28:06] the very first tape in the message.
[1:28:10] Brother Banner mentions the rights um
[1:28:12] from from faith is the substance and all
[1:28:16] the way through their ministry he says
[1:28:17] them and the slaughters are some of the
[1:28:19] oldest one. He says that sister Edith
[1:28:21] would be in in pain and she was crippled
[1:28:24] up. Her arms are twisted. She's in this
[1:28:26] wheelchair. He says we prayed for her
[1:28:29] and the Lord took the pain away but
[1:28:31] never healed her. And he goes on further
[1:28:34] and says I pray for many people far
[1:28:37] worse than her. And in fact, right in
[1:28:40] her own home, Brother Wright was dying
[1:28:44] with cancer. He was on his last stage
[1:28:47] dying. Brother Brandham said he prayed
[1:28:49] for four days and the Lord gave him a
[1:28:52] vision
[1:28:54] and the Lord healed brother Wright and s
[1:28:56] sister Sister Edith sat right there.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; And here's Sister Edith all these years
[1:29:01] until he mentions her birthday a number
[1:29:04] of times on tape. I think she passed in
[1:29:07] 196 something. I forget what it was, but
[1:29:10] he mentions it on tape that she's gone
[1:29:12] on. She she had passed and she sat in
[1:29:15] that wheelchair for all of her life. And
[1:29:17] there's quotes where brother Adam says,
[1:29:19] "We always looking for God to heal her."
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; And he had no answer
[1:29:27] why she wasn't healed.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Now, is God a healer?
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. Now, was she in contact with
[1:29:34] somebody who knew healing?
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Was she a part of a MINISTRY THAT
[1:29:38] DISPLAYED HEALING IN A great
[1:29:40] manifestation?
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; The third pull came down in her home.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; AND YET, SHE SAT IN THAT WHEELCHAIR.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Because this is not a gimmick.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; This is NOT AN ANSWER TO EVERYBODY'S
[1:29:56] QUESTION.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; GOD DOESN'T OPERATE THAT WAY. WHAT HE
[1:30:00] DOES, HE GIVES YOU HIS WORD
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; AND YOU KEEP HIS WORD AND THEN HE keeps
[1:30:07] you.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Now what was this word? The scripture
[1:30:11] calls it the word of his patience.
[1:30:15] And he the scripture tells us that you
[1:30:19] have kept the word of my patience and I
[1:30:22] will keep you in this hour of
[1:30:26] tribulation. Now, as we shared with you
[1:30:30] last couple of times on the the purpose
[1:30:32] or the reason why God gives us these
[1:30:34] mysteries, Revelations 10:7 that the
[1:30:37] angel would come and reveal those
[1:30:40] mysteries.
[1:30:42] And the mysteries are are what opens up
[1:30:45] to us. It's wisdom. It's the revelation
[1:30:49] of who God is. Upon this upon this rock,
[1:30:54] I'll build my church. He builds you by a
[1:30:57] revelation, not by education, not by
[1:30:59] intellects, but by a revelation, by
[1:31:02] something supernatural.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; You can't explain it all.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; This is not made to argue in the great
[1:31:09] halls of Congress and prove that God is
[1:31:13] true.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; No, but you can prove that he's true in
[1:31:16] your own life.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; He made himself known to you
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; personally. Can I get a witness? Amen.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; And every believer is built that way.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; He's built on a revelation.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Not education or intellect.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; It is a individual. When you come to
[1:31:37] worship the Lord, it is a individual
[1:31:40] praise.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Individual worship.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; A INDIVIDUAL THANK YOU JESUS.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; HE CHANGED MY LIFE.
[1:31:52] I CAN never be the same again.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; It has nothing to do who's sitting next
[1:31:58] to ME OR WHO'S BEHIND me or who SAID
[1:32:01] WHAT. BUT GOD GOT A HOLD OF MY LIFE AND
[1:32:06] I CAN NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; It's real.
[1:32:15] It's real.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; IT'S REAL TO THE BELIEVER.
[1:32:20] AMEN.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; It's not something we're arguing.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to prove it to anybody.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; GOD MADE HIMSELF KNOWN TO ME.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; I can never be the same again.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; It's individual like that.
[1:32:45] and he
[1:32:47] he opens up his word to us through
[1:32:50] revelation. Now, brother Bandham takes
[1:32:52] this open door as you read this
[1:32:55] Philadelphiaian church age and he gives
[1:32:58] us the time frame that it was open
[1:33:04] and this was in
[1:33:08] paragraph 236
[1:33:10] and the Philadelphiaian church age. This
[1:33:12] is what he says. Now this great
[1:33:14] temptation, the hour of temptation that
[1:33:16] shall come to try the whole world goes
[1:33:20] into tribulation. Just in a few minutes
[1:33:23] we'll see it goes on into the
[1:33:26] tribulation.
[1:33:27] The tribulation did not come in the days
[1:33:29] of Wesley. So what age are we in? What's
[1:33:32] the door set before? It's between the
[1:33:36] Wesleyan and where the church is headed
[1:33:39] right now and already in to the
[1:33:42] Leodysian age. But this little place
[1:33:44] right in here within the last 35,
[1:33:49] 40 years has been an open door setting
[1:33:52] right before the people to come in and
[1:33:54] God will take a remnant and seal it off
[1:33:58] and they'll go on into a lukewarm and
[1:34:03] he'll spew them out of his mouth. The
[1:34:06] work will be cut short.
[1:34:10] Up goes the church. Here comes the
[1:34:11] antichrist moving in for destruction.
[1:34:14] Just perfect. Fits with the whole Bible
[1:34:18] on around.
[1:34:20] All right. Paragraph 119.
[1:34:23] Same message. He says, "Open door." What
[1:34:25] is it? It's the revelation of the
[1:34:26] supreme deity, Christ, not being a
[1:34:30] second person of the Trinity, but being
[1:34:32] God himself made flesh and dwelt among
[1:34:35] us.
[1:34:37] The first time the name's been spoke of
[1:34:40] now since back in this age back here
[1:34:42] lost the name. Luther come out with the
[1:34:45] name that was alive and was dead. That's
[1:34:47] right. Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Here
[1:34:50] comes out the name of Jesus again in
[1:34:52] between these two ages in between the
[1:34:55] open door. Now it's a revelation what he
[1:34:58] was the deity.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; The revelations of his deity. Can you
[1:35:05] say praise the Lord? Amen. Praise the
[1:35:06] Lord.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; So, brother Random now identifies this
[1:35:09] age.
[1:35:11] He said the past 35 to 40 years.
[1:35:15] That was in 1960. So, that's going back
[1:35:18] to 1930s and early late 1920s and 1930s
[1:35:24] that this open door. This is Revelations
[1:35:27] 3 that we read. The Lord said, "I have
[1:35:29] set before you
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; an open door." Not somebody, not the
[1:35:33] church, not somebody else. The Lord
[1:35:35] says, "I have set before you an open
[1:35:37] door."
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; And this open door was in a specific
[1:35:41] period of time. And what was it? It was
[1:35:44] a revelation of the deity of Christ,
[1:35:46] water baptism, the name of Jesus being
[1:35:50] restored back to the church. And now
[1:35:53] those that keep the word of my patience,
[1:35:57] I will keep you during the hour of
[1:35:58] tribulation. Amen.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; How many know it's the word that
[1:36:02] actually is protecting you?
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; You think it's you and your nice driving
[1:36:08] skills that's protecting you out in
[1:36:10] these old crazy streets out here. What's
[1:36:13] going on in the mall and wherever you're
[1:36:15] going that it's you being so aware
[1:36:18] that's keeping you? No. No. It's the
[1:36:20] word of the Lord.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; It's the angels of God.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; If he just takes his hand off of you,
[1:36:26] you will fall. you will fail.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; But his word keeps us.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; His word protects us.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; He's the reason why we are here today.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; If you can even know the name of Jesus,
[1:36:40] it's because he has revealed that to
[1:36:43] you.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; It's not in our own strength.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; It's not in our own power.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; But this open door, the revelation of
[1:36:52] who Jesus is. Now Jesus, who is Jesus?
[1:36:56] Has any of us seen Jesus face to face in
[1:37:00] his flesh?
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Have we shook his hand? Do we know what
[1:37:05] really what he looks like in his
[1:37:07] stature? No. No. We The only revelation
[1:37:11] we know of Jesus is Jesus according to
[1:37:14] his word.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; That's who he is. Jesus is the word.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; And what word is he? He's the word for
[1:37:21] the day that you live in. Amen.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet of God continues on and
[1:37:27] he says this, talking about this open
[1:37:30] door just a little bit further
[1:37:34] and
[1:37:37] 1965.
[1:37:41] Well, let's take Christ the mystery of
[1:37:43] God revealed first. 1963, paragraph 303.
[1:37:49] Don't you love the Lord?
[1:37:51] He says, "God is known by simplicity and
[1:37:54] of the revelation of Jesus Christ to the
[1:37:57] most illiterate person."
[1:38:01] See, not your theology.
[1:38:05] It's a revelation of Jesus Christ. Upon
[1:38:09] this rock, I'll build my church. No
[1:38:11] other rocks accept it. No other things
[1:38:14] accept it. nor the Roman rock, nor the
[1:38:16] Protestant rock, no other school, no
[1:38:20] other nothing but on exactly the
[1:38:22] revelation of Jesus Christ through the
[1:38:24] new birth. He borns in there. He injects
[1:38:28] his own life and your life is gone. And
[1:38:31] the life of Christ is projecting itself
[1:38:33] through you with preeminences
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; to the people that they see the very
[1:38:39] life and works and signs and wonders
[1:38:42] that he did is doing the same thing
[1:38:44] through you. Outside of that, the rest
[1:38:47] of it is not even called to at all.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Watch God's great revelation unfolding.
[1:38:53] Amen.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; By lack of this revelation
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; is why see the reason
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; is why we have so many different
[1:39:04] divisions
[1:39:06] among us
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; and so much mockery
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; so much division among us is because the
[1:39:16] people lack the youth meetings
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; weeny roast
[1:39:24] get together for fried chicken.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Because the people last lack a
[1:39:29] basketball team to keep the youth
[1:39:31] together.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; They lack a team of of we need more
[1:39:35] people. We need more people in the
[1:39:36] church. That's why our youth are
[1:39:38] struggling. No. The reason the struggle
[1:39:41] is people lack the revelation.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; See, they lack the revelation.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; The teachers.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He's nailing the pastors today
[1:39:53] and the teachers.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Said the pastors are the reason for it.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; The teachers they lack it. Let me read
[1:40:00] it again without any comments. Paragraph
[1:40:02] 304. By lack of this revelation is why
[1:40:06] we have so many different divisions
[1:40:08] among us and so much markering so much
[1:40:12] division among us is because the people
[1:40:14] lack that revelation.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; See they lack that revelation. The
[1:40:20] teachers
[1:40:22] So,
[1:40:24] I have to internalize these quotations.
[1:40:27] I have to say that brother Brandham
[1:40:30] actually is telling me this.
[1:40:33] I'm not going to hold your hand with me
[1:40:35] and say, "Let's all say amen together."
[1:40:38] I'm not going to grab my Bible and say,
[1:40:40] "Let's all in a group agree at one
[1:40:42] time." No. No. No. Are you serious?
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; No. No. No. No. Every individual, man,
[1:40:51] woman, boy, girl that's a believer has
[1:40:55] to have a revelation on the greatest of
[1:40:59] all revelations.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; It's the supreme deity of our Lord.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; When he's speaking, you'll know it's him
[1:41:09] that's speaking.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; What does this revelation do for you? IF
[1:41:12] YOU GOT IT in this age, you'll have it
[1:41:15] in any other age. In the days of Moses,
[1:41:18] you would have had it. IN THE DAYS OF
[1:41:19] NOAH, YOU WOULD HAVE HAD IT. IN ANY
[1:41:22] OTHER AGE, ANYWHERE THROUGHOUT YOUR
[1:41:24] BIBLE, you put you in that age, you
[1:41:27] would catch that revelation.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Not everybody couldn't see who Noah was.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Everybody didn't see who Moses was
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; or Elijah or Daniel. AMEN.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; NOT EVERYBODY SAW IT, BUT THE TRUE
[1:41:40] BELIEVER THAT HAD THE REVELATION
[1:41:43] OF THAT IT'S GOD THAT'S DOING THE
[1:41:45] SPEAKING.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; It settles it for the believer.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness?
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Now, here what the prophet of God says
[1:41:57] here
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; in this message
[1:42:03] um paragraph 160. It's in the message
[1:42:10] spiritual food in due season. Now God
[1:42:13] has promised us
[1:42:15] these things in the last days in Malachi
[1:42:18] 4 said that Jesus Christ would come down
[1:42:22] and impersonate himself in human flesh
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; like he did at Sodom.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; And said the world would be in a Sodom
[1:42:32] condition.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "As it was then, the son
[1:42:35] of man will be revealed that day."
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; See this man that come down in the form
[1:42:40] of a man which was Elohim
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; by Abraham before this promised son
[1:42:46] came. Look what it was.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Abraham said it was God.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Bible said there was three men come to
[1:42:52] him dust on their clothes, travel, sat
[1:42:55] down and eat like a man. Skip down to
[1:42:58] paragraph one
[1:43:02] 61. Now mark that with the last prophet
[1:43:05] said behold I'll send you Elijah the
[1:43:07] prophet and he will restore the hearts
[1:43:09] of the children back to the father. So
[1:43:12] here brother Random is taking Genesis 18
[1:43:14] and he's typing it and he's bringing the
[1:43:17] the connection with this uh this man
[1:43:22] this being that came to Abraham.
[1:43:26] Remember the angel that came to Abraham,
[1:43:28] there was three of them, but the one,
[1:43:30] the Lord himself, revealed the secrets
[1:43:33] that was in the hearts of Sarah.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; And the tent behind him.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; We've seen that in our day. Amen.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; So now the prophet is now taking what
[1:43:43] Abraham, what happened with Abraham and
[1:43:45] Sarah, and now he's bringing now mark
[1:43:47] that with the last day prophet.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Now it's not what am I saying? It's not
[1:43:54] what are you thinking? is what is
[1:43:56] brother Brandham saying?
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; What is THE TAPE SAYING?
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE PROPHET SAYING?
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; And I thank the Lord. I thank the Lord
[1:44:06] that the message is recorded
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; so I can go listen to it and say amen to
[1:44:11] it.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; All by myself if I HAVE TO,
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; ALL ALONE IF I HAVE TO. BUT I'M GLAD
[1:44:18] IT'S BEEN RECORDED.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. the hearts. Behold,
[1:44:25] I'll send you Elijah the prophet. He'll
[1:44:26] restore the hearts of the children back
[1:44:28] to the fathers. See a message to bring
[1:44:30] them back to the Bible. And the son of
[1:44:32] man will be revealing himself in that
[1:44:34] day.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; In that day of the sounding of the last
[1:44:37] church age, the seventh angel, the
[1:44:39] mysteries of God should be made known in
[1:44:42] that day.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; The seven seals will be broken.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; The mysteries of all these churches and
[1:44:48] things, how they happen,
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; how what taking place. You see, they
[1:44:53] don't know it.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "You blind Pharisees said,
[1:44:58] if the blind leads the blind, don't they
[1:45:00] both fall in the ditch?" See, that's the
[1:45:04] reason those people don't see that.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; So, the prophet is now laying it out for
[1:45:13] us. The reason why because as Jesus said
[1:45:17] the Pharisees,
[1:45:19] they won't go in the door and then
[1:45:22] they'll prevent those that are going in
[1:45:24] the door from going.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; There's a candle that is lit. You don't
[1:45:28] set it under a bushel.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; You set it so it can be seen.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; And the Pharisees and the scribes
[1:45:34] wouldn't go in the door.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; And then they prevented those that were
[1:45:38] actually going in the door. Jesus said
[1:45:40] that. Now the prophet tells us by lack
[1:45:44] of this revelation is the reason why we
[1:45:47] have so many different um divisions
[1:45:50] among us.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; So what was the falling away? It's a
[1:45:53] falling away from the spirit. It's
[1:45:56] falling away from the word of God. It's
[1:45:59] falling away from this open door
[1:46:01] revelation. It's a foundation. The cause
[1:46:05] of it is the pastors. I read two or
[1:46:08] three quotes for you there. I'll read
[1:46:10] one more in just a moment moment. And
[1:46:13] the the what they're falling from is
[1:46:15] they're falling away from the word. Now,
[1:46:20] we'll see that a revelation
[1:46:23] is something that you can lose.
[1:46:27] It's something that actually the church
[1:46:29] lost. They had it
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; and then lost it. Amen.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; One example biblically, the Old
[1:46:37] Testament example was Esau. How many
[1:46:40] remember Esau?
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; He was born in the right position. He
[1:46:43] was born in the right family. It should
[1:46:46] have been Abraham, Isaac, Esau. That
[1:46:50] would have been the gradual uh uh uh
[1:46:53] inheritance. He would have received all
[1:46:55] from the lineage of Abraham. Was he not
[1:46:57] a son of Abraham?
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; He was.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; But he lost it, didn't he?
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; What did he lose? He lost because he
[1:47:05] disrespected the birthright.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; He disrespected the great move of God
[1:47:11] working amongst him in in this age would
[1:47:16] be the power of God and the Holy Spirit.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; And this Esau, the Bible calls him the
[1:47:24] evil one,
[1:47:26] a wicked one. He had it and then he lost
[1:47:30] it.
[1:47:32] Isn't that something?
[1:47:34] We can see that pattern happening again.
[1:47:37] Even today, Lord,
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; many people that have had the truth,
[1:47:42] they stood away from it. It's being lost
[1:47:45] from them. If you fail to preach it, you
[1:47:48] fail to teach it, it will become lost.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; It's just like your first language might
[1:47:53] be English or Spanish or French,
[1:47:57] whatever it is, you might know that
[1:47:59] language. You could be born in France or
[1:48:01] born wherever French-sp speakaking
[1:48:02] country and if you get to a place where
[1:48:05] you stop using that language, you'll
[1:48:07] actually lose that language.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; And then we look at you, you look
[1:48:13] Hispanic and we sayas
[1:48:16] and you say, "What he saying? Aren't you
[1:48:19] supposed to know Spanish, my brother?"
[1:48:22] Well, maybe not.
[1:48:24] I'll never forget there's a prayer line
[1:48:26] with brother Billy Paul at at North Side
[1:48:29] and Brother Billy Paul had a prayer line
[1:48:31] and ministers and brothers here
[1:48:32] everywhere and the little sister came up
[1:48:34] for prayer and uh she spoke Spanish and
[1:48:38] he turned and looked at Caleb Don said
[1:48:40] it's Spanish come here and Caleb was
[1:48:42] like I don't speak no Spanish
[1:48:45] oh he felt that small for years he's
[1:48:48] like man I was so embarrassed I should
[1:48:50] learn my own language yeah but he said I
[1:48:53] should have just stood there and God
[1:48:54] would have just gave me the language.
[1:48:58] But uh it doesn't work that way. You can
[1:49:00] lose it. Hebrews 12:16 says, "Lest there
[1:49:04] be any fornicator or profane profane
[1:49:07] person as Esau who for one morsel of
[1:49:10] meat sold his birthight.
[1:49:16] For ye know how, that afterward, when he
[1:49:19] would have inherited the blessing, he
[1:49:23] was rejected, for he found no place of
[1:49:26] repentance, though he sought it
[1:49:29] carefully with tears.
[1:49:32] Now, there is there is a cost for taking
[1:49:36] a stand for the Lord Jesus,
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; and Esau didn't want to pay that price.
[1:49:42] But Jacob was willing to do anything
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; to get that position that Esau had.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; It looked impossible.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; IT LOOKED LIKE THERE'S NO WAY, JACOB,
[1:49:54] YOU COULD EVER BE the first born. You're
[1:49:56] the SECOND BORN. BUT SOMETHING IN HIM
[1:49:58] DROVE HIM.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; YES, LORD.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; AND HE WAITED FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. AND
[1:50:02] WHEN IT CAME, he seized the moment.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; And Jacob was a TYPE OF THE SPIRITUAL
[1:50:09] BELIEVER.
[1:50:11] He doesn't DESERVE IT. IN FACT, HE'S ON
[1:50:13] HIS COURSE. HIS NAME IS OFF. EVERYTHING
[1:50:15] ABOUT HIM IS OFF. BUT HIS DESIRE
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; IS TO BE WHAT GOD CALLED HIM TO BE.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; THAT IS A TRUE BELIEVER.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; If you keep THE WORD,
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; GOD WILL keep you.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; But it's the word first.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; You don't put a political field out
[1:50:36] there to see who's going to agree with
[1:50:38] you.
[1:50:39] You don't check THE THE THE CROWD TO see
[1:50:42] who's going to be your friend.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; NO, YOU TAKE A STAND
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; for what's BEEN REVEALED TO YOU.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; And God will make a way. He made a way.
[1:50:53] HE MOVED ESAU AND PUT JACOB RIGHT THERE.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE PUT HIM THERE, HE CHANGED
[1:50:59] HIS NAME.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; SUPERNATURAL.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; That's the God that I serve.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; That we serve.
[1:51:08] So this wisdom, this revelation, we call
[1:51:12] it wisdom in the scripture also. We call
[1:51:14] it the the enlightening or better
[1:51:17] understanding. Psalms 110 111:10 says,
[1:51:22] "The fear of the Lord is the beginning
[1:51:24] of wisdom. A good understanding have all
[1:51:28] they that do his commandments.
[1:51:32] His praise endures forever."
[1:51:36] Now, wisdom is tied into people that
[1:51:38] fear the Lord.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; If they don't fear the Lord, that's not
[1:51:42] wise.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the IQ is.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; I don't care how many degrees they have.
[1:51:48] If they don't fear the Lord is just not
[1:51:49] wise. And the beginning of wisdom is
[1:51:53] those that fear the Lord.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 1:7 says, "The fear of the Lord
[1:51:58] is the beginning of knowledge, but fools
[1:52:01] despise wisdom and instruction."
[1:52:04] Proverbs 9:es
[1:52:06] 9 and 10. Give instructions to a wise
[1:52:09] man and he will argue with you. No. Give
[1:52:14] instructions to a wise man and he will
[1:52:16] be yet wiser.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Teach a just man and he will increase in
[1:52:23] learning. The fear of the Lord is the
[1:52:26] beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of
[1:52:28] the holy is understanding.
[1:52:31] I wonder sometime if people fear other
[1:52:35] people more than they fear the Lord. I
[1:52:38] wonder if they fear their boss on a job
[1:52:42] or the people their their family members
[1:52:45] uh uh more than they fear the Lord. They
[1:52:48] certainly respect their careers more
[1:52:50] than they respect the Lord. They respect
[1:52:53] their their peer groups and what they're
[1:52:55] going to say about them or think about
[1:52:57] them. But you're not wise to take that
[1:53:00] position. Wisdom begins as you fear the
[1:53:04] Lord.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; You're not to fear any man. Not to FEAR
[1:53:07] ANY CONSEQUENCE. NOT TO FEAR losing your
[1:53:10] freedom or EVEN LOSING YOUR LIFE. IT IS
[1:53:14] WISE TO FEAR THE LORD FIRST. THAT'S THE
[1:53:18] BEGINNING OF ALL WISDOM. I FEAR WHAT THE
[1:53:23] WORD SAYS. I RESPECT THE WORD OF THE
[1:53:26] LORD.
[1:53:27] That's the beginning
[1:53:29] of all wisdom.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 4:5 and 7. Get wisdom. Get an
[1:53:36] understanding. Forget it not, neither
[1:53:39] decline from the words of my mouth.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Forsake her not, and she shall do
[1:53:45] what to thee? Preserve thee. You keep
[1:53:49] it, it'll keep you. Forsake her not, and
[1:53:52] she shall preserve thee. Love her, and
[1:53:54] she shall keep thee.
[1:53:57] Wisdom is the principle thing.
[1:54:00] Therefore, get wisdom with all thy
[1:54:02] getting, get understanding.
[1:54:06] This wisdom, Ecclesiastes 9 13 and 18
[1:54:11] says this, the wisdom have I seen also
[1:54:14] under the sun, and it seemed great unto
[1:54:16] me. There was a little city, a few men
[1:54:19] within it, and there came a great king
[1:54:21] against it, and besieized it, and built
[1:54:24] a great bull works against it. Now there
[1:54:27] was found in it a poor, no-name
[1:54:33] wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered
[1:54:37] the city. Yet no man remembered that
[1:54:40] same poor man. Then said I, wisdom is
[1:54:45] better than strength.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, the poor man's wisdom is
[1:54:51] despised.
[1:54:53] And his words are are not heard. The
[1:54:56] words of the wise men are heard and
[1:54:59] quiet more than the cry of him that
[1:55:01] ruleth among fools.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Wisdom is what?
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; BETTER THAN WEAPONS OF WAR.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; But one sinner destroyth much good. So
[1:55:12] this wisdom, this great revelation
[1:55:16] is principle.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; The revelation that God reveals himself
[1:55:20] to you.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; This not going to give you a name so
[1:55:23] much, won't make you wealthy so much,
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; but you'll be right in the sight of God.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; You'll be on the right side when the
[1:55:31] judgment strike.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Wisdom
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; will have you inside of the ark versus
[1:55:38] outside of the ark criticizing
[1:55:40] everything.
[1:55:42] Wisdom will keep YOU FROM BOWING
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; EVEN IF THE COST SAYS, you know, just
[1:55:47] bow down because the king said so. No,
[1:55:50] those three Hebrew boys had wisdom. Why?
[1:55:53] Because they feared the Lord. Wisdom
[1:55:56] kept Joseph during his great TESTS AND
[1:55:59] TEMPTATION. WHY? BECAUSE HE FEARED THE
[1:56:02] LORD. He didn't fear Potterer. HE DIDN'T
[1:56:04] FEAR PHARAOH. AND HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T
[1:56:06] FEAR PIPER'S WIFE. HE STOOD WITH WISDOM.
[1:56:10] HE SAID, "HOW CAN I DO THIS AGAINST THE
[1:56:12] LORD?" AND LOOK WHAT THE Lord in his
[1:56:14] wisdom did FOR HIM. IT KEPT HIM. IT
[1:56:18] MOVED HIM. IT PRESERVED HIM. AND THAT'S
[1:56:20] WHAT'S KEEPING you today.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; DESPISE IT NOT.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Despise it not, saints of the most high
[1:56:30] God.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Stay with
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; this great wisdom,
[1:56:35] the wisdom that has been given to us in
[1:56:38] this last day. Now what was this
[1:56:42] last day open door?
[1:56:45] It was as brother Vanam says it. It was
[1:56:49] the son of God impersonated
[1:56:54] in his church.
[1:56:56] Now look at this quotation here in 1963.
[1:56:59] I'm going to take 10 15 more minutes.
[1:57:01] Okay saints.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Here what the prophet says here.
[1:57:05] Paragraph 148 147. They have refused the
[1:57:09] anointed word of promise of this age.
[1:57:12] And he is always the word. If God sent
[1:57:16] us an anointed promised word again for
[1:57:18] this age in 1946, he would be the same
[1:57:22] he was when he come in the beginning.
[1:57:24] The anointed word for the age. Hebrews
[1:57:27] 13:8 throws it right back in your lap
[1:57:29] and says he's the same yesterday, today,
[1:57:32] and forever.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. and he would stay
[1:57:37] with the father's promised word for this
[1:57:40] age.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; If Jesus comes, he would be just exactly
[1:57:44] what the word said he would be in this
[1:57:47] age. That's what Elijah was in his age.
[1:57:51] That's what Moses was in his age. That's
[1:57:54] what Noah was in his age. That's what
[1:57:57] everywhere, every prophet ever come. The
[1:58:01] word when it come in fullness, the
[1:58:05] entire word made flesh among us. It did
[1:58:08] just exactly what it said it would do in
[1:58:10] that age.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; If it come today, he would be just
[1:58:15] exactly Jesus Christ living out his
[1:58:18] promises of what he promised to do just
[1:58:20] as the word. Amen. Questions and
[1:58:23] answers. 1964,
[1:58:25] prophet says this, paragraph 49.
[1:58:29] So being a well-trained theo theologian
[1:58:32] had nothing to do with it. Being meek
[1:58:35] and gentle had nothing to do with it.
[1:58:37] What made him different? He was the word
[1:58:39] made flesh. Not the word for the day of
[1:58:42] Moses.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Moses was that day word.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; Not the word for the days of Noah. Noah
[1:58:50] was the word for that day.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Not the word for the day of Elijah.
[1:58:56] Elijah was the word for that day,
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; but he was the present tense word
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; and they were living in the back.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; The same thing repeats.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; WOW.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE EVIDENCE OF THE Holy Ghost.
[1:59:14] WOW.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD REVEALS to you and you see it,
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; thus sayeth the Lord and accept it, not
[1:59:23] what you are, not what you was, nothing
[1:59:25] about it. It was God has done for you.
[1:59:28] There's the evidence.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Now, we don't have a problem with Moses
[1:59:33] being the word for his day, do we?
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; We don't have a problem with Noah being
[1:59:36] the word for his day.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; We don't have a problem with Elijah
[1:59:39] being the word for his day. Do we have a
[1:59:41] problem with the prophet William Browner
[1:59:43] being the word for his day?
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; You say no.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; We want to skip that and just jump and
[1:59:54] say that we're the word made flesh.
[1:59:56] We're the bride will be the word. We
[1:59:57] want to skip the prophet.
[2:00:00] Don't skip nothing.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; SAY IT ALL. STAY WITH THE WORD.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; The prophet WAS THE WORD FOR THE AGE.
[2:00:07] AND when you receive that, the evidence
[2:00:09] OF THE HOLY GHOST, YOU BECOME THE WORD
[2:00:13] for your age.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil fool you.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; And have you sit down when it's time to
[2:00:22] stand up
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; and be reconciled or be noticed for what
[2:00:27] side you're on?
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; God sent his word and his word heals the
[2:00:31] people.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; Gy. Now, it's a lack of this revelation
[2:00:37] who Jesus is in the age that you live
[2:00:40] in. Huh?
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Can I go a little bit further?
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, I have time.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; In the message of trial, brother Random
[2:00:50] says this here,
[2:00:53] paragraph 77,
[2:00:56] blind prosecutor. Can't you see that
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; his words are true?
[2:01:03] Not nail scars and prints and thorns.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; It's the son of God impersonated
[2:01:10] in his church
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; as son of man.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; It has to fulfill Malachi 4 and the rest
[2:01:17] of the scriptures
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; are called to this court's attention.
[2:01:20] Look at that real good.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Brother is telling us look at it real
[2:01:24] good.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Son of man like God the Father, God the
[2:01:27] Son, God the Holy Ghost. It's the same
[2:01:29] God. Three different attributes of the
[2:01:32] same God. Now this is son of David. Son
[2:01:35] of man revealed then as a prophet son of
[2:01:39] David king. Now the son of God to the
[2:01:41] church age as God isn't man. God is a
[2:01:45] spirit and the spirit son is the holy
[2:01:47] ghost
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; which is revealing the church age.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; But promised here
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; in the last days
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; that the son of man would be revealed.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:00] Now, if you don't have this revelation,
[2:02:02] you're going to be very shaky, very
[2:02:04] loose on some matters coming as it as it
[2:02:07] pertains to the message. If you don't
[2:02:08] have the revelation of who Jesus is,
[2:02:11] even historically,
[2:02:13] even on the sea shores of Galilee,
[2:02:17] you're going to have a problem with him.
[2:02:19] If you didn't know that he was the
[2:02:21] answer to Isaiah's prophecy,
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; amen.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; If you didn't know that he was the the
[2:02:27] Jehovah of the Old Testament made uh is
[2:02:30] Jesus of the New. If you didn't know
[2:02:32] that, you're going to have a problem.
[2:02:34] What you're going to do, you're going to
[2:02:35] examine his statements and say, "Eat my
[2:02:38] flesh and drink my blood." That's
[2:02:39] contrary to what Moses said. We believe
[2:02:42] Moses and not you, Jesus.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; You're going to judge him HOW HE'S
[2:02:46] DOING. AND you're sitting with the wine
[2:02:49] bibbers and your your whole ministry is
[2:02:51] not the way we want. You're sitting
[2:02:53] there judging the word made flesh, the
[2:02:56] son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; judging him
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; because you don't have a revelation of
[2:03:02] who he was, present tense.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; It's the same thing today.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the same thing today. THIS IS
[2:03:12] WHY THERE'S SUCH A SHIFT in a move in
[2:03:16] the hearts of the people or who and what
[2:03:19] this message is. They think it's
[2:03:22] optional like like the prophet's
[2:03:24] ministry is equal to any other ministry
[2:03:27] or they can just SAY IT'S WRONG NOW OR
[2:03:29] IT'S OFF NOW OR I PROVED HIM wrong
[2:03:32] because the internet said so. I I I I
[2:03:35] CHECKED OUT WHAT HE SAID AND I JUDGED
[2:03:37] HIM AND I KNOW THAT HE'S OFF NOW. I'M
[2:03:40] SORRY. That's all right, saints. If
[2:03:42] that's the discipline you're going to go
[2:03:43] under, you're going to go under.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; God reveals himself
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; through his message,
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; through the messenger.
[2:03:55] AND THAT MESSENGER NOW BROADCAST to all.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; And it's not something that you can like
[2:04:03] theologically
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; in um in in in to argue like we're going
[2:04:08] to have a YouTube channel now and argue
[2:04:11] who's right, who won that debate. Who
[2:04:12] won that debate?
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Who won that argument?
[2:04:17] Jesus won all the arguments.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; How did he win? When he got up from the
[2:04:21] grave.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE SETTLED IT ONCE AND FOR ALL.
[2:04:25] ALL THE ARGUING, ALL THE
[2:04:27] MISUNDERSTANDINGS, ALL YOU'RE SAYING,
[2:04:29] WHY ON THAT THIRD DAY, HE GOT UP FROM
[2:04:31] THE GRAVE
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; AND THE RESURRECTION PROVES
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; THAT HE WAS WHO HE SAID HE WAS.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[2:04:46] AMEN.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; It's not an argument.
[2:04:50] It's not something we try to prove to
[2:04:52] people
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; as much as we try, much as we can. Paul
[2:04:55] said after the third admonition, "Let
[2:04:57] them go." Avoid foolish questions.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; Father,
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; get away from it. I know what it did for
[2:05:03] me, Brother Angel. This changed my life,
[2:05:06] young man.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, it did. I know what it did for me.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; I don't have to argue with that or prove
[2:05:12] that.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; I am the proof.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; I KNOW WHAT I WAS. I KNOW WHAT I AM
[2:05:17] TODAY.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND Jesus proved who he was. Now
[2:05:22] people don't see it. It was the son of
[2:05:24] God impersonated
[2:05:27] in his church. It's the son of God
[2:05:29] impersonated in his church as the son of
[2:05:32] man. Now what does God do?
[2:05:35] We've seen this pattern in the
[2:05:38] scripture.
[2:05:40] Well, God uses a faithful messenger
[2:05:43] and that spirit
[2:05:46] sometimes
[2:05:47] comes back upon the people.
[2:05:50] Huh? Let's take the Bible now. Numbers
[2:05:53] 11:25.
[2:05:56] This is where it might get a little
[2:05:57] quiet. All right.
[2:05:59] He's either going to get more quiet or
[2:06:01] going to get louder. All right. We'll
[2:06:03] find out which one it is for you.
[2:06:06] Numbers chapter 11.
[2:06:10] Old Testament example.
[2:06:14] Let's find it quickly here. I didn't
[2:06:16] read it this morning. I had it in my
[2:06:18] other notes and I remember what it was.
[2:06:21] Verses 25 and 29. It says, "And the Lord
[2:06:25] came down in a cloud and spake unto him
[2:06:29] and took of the spirit that was upon him
[2:06:32] and gave it unto the 70 elders. And it
[2:06:35] came to pass that when the spirit rested
[2:06:37] upon upon them, they prophesied
[2:06:43] and did not cease.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; They had something to say, didn't they?
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; They didn't have nothing to say before
[2:06:49] that. But when the spirit
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; that was on Moses,
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; this is your Bible now. This is your
[2:06:55] Bible. The spirit that was on Moses
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; was separated and came upon them. What
[2:07:01] they do?
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; They did what Moses was doing. They
[2:07:05] prophesy. Let's read it.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; Lord came down in the clouds, spake on
[2:07:09] him, and took of the spirit that was
[2:07:10] upon him, gave it upon the 70 elders,
[2:07:13] and it came to pass that when the spirit
[2:07:14] rested upon them, they prophesied and
[2:07:17] did not cease. Let's see this again in
[2:07:21] the scripture in second Kings chapter
[2:07:25] number two.
[2:07:30] Second Kings, is that in the Old
[2:07:32] Testament?
[2:07:35] What page is it on?
[2:07:39] Come on, somebody help me.
[2:07:42] Who said what?
[2:07:44] 4:22. Second Kings chapter 2.
[2:07:50] Some of y'all looking around.
[2:07:55] Yes. Second Kings chapter 2 verse
[2:07:59] number.
[2:08:01] Uhhuh.
[2:08:07] Nine.
[2:08:08] And it came to pass when they were gone
[2:08:11] over that Elijah said unto Elijah, "Ask
[2:08:15] what I shall do for thee before I be
[2:08:18] taken away from thee."
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; And Elisha said, I pray thee, what'd he
[2:08:23] say?
[2:08:24] Let a double portion of thy spirit
[2:08:30] be upon me.
[2:08:32] Is this a bad thing or a good thing?
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you. Is this man walked with
[2:08:38] Elijah?
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; He's a young man. Brother Brandon said
[2:08:42] it took him 10 years for him to fit the
[2:08:46] coat of Elijah.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; About 10 years for him to learn and see
[2:08:53] his ways and KNOW HOW HE ACTS and
[2:08:56] operates. And now the opportunity of a
[2:08:59] lifetime is presented to him. And the
[2:09:02] prophet turns to HIM AND SAYS, "YOUNG
[2:09:03] MAN, WHAT SHALL I GIVE YOU?"
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; LORD,
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; ASK AND I WILL GIVE IT UNTO YOU. WHAT
[2:09:09] SHALL IT BE? He says, "I want a double
[2:09:11] portion.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; I WANT WHAT YOU GOT plus
[2:09:16] I want a double portion of your spirit."
[2:09:19] And he says, "Thou has asked a hard
[2:09:23] thing. Nevertheless, if thou see me when
[2:09:26] I am taken from thee, it shall be so
[2:09:29] unto thee. But if not, it shall not be
[2:09:31] so. It came to pass as they still went
[2:09:34] on, they talked that behold, there
[2:09:36] appeared a chariot of fire, horses of
[2:09:38] fire, parting them both to sunder.
[2:09:41] Elijah went up by a whirlwind into
[2:09:43] heaven. Elijah saw it. HE CRIED, "MY
[2:09:46] FATHER, MY FATHER, THE CHARIOTS OF
[2:09:48] ISRAEL AND THE horsemen thereof. He saw
[2:09:51] him no more, and he took a hold of his
[2:09:53] own clothes and rent them in two pieces.
[2:09:56] He took up also THE MANTLE OF ELIJAH
[2:09:58] THAT FELL FROM him and went back and
[2:10:00] stood by the bank of the Jordan. And he
[2:10:03] took the mantle OF ELIJAH THAT FELL from
[2:10:05] him. HE SMOKED THE WATERS AND SAID,
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; "WHERE IS THE GOD?
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; What is where is the Lord God of
[2:10:16] Elijah?" And when he had smitten the
[2:10:19] waters, they parted hither, and thither
[2:10:24] Elijah went over.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; don't you love the Lord?
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; Was that wrong for him to ask for that?
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; When you're listening to the tape, don't
[2:10:37] you want the same anointing on that tape
[2:10:39] to come on you?
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; Huh? Yes.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; When you're reading your Bible, don't
[2:10:44] you want the same anointing of that
[2:10:46] Bible to come on you?
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE PRAYER LINE IS GOING ON AND YOU
[2:10:51] HEAR SAINTS BEING BLESSED AND FILLED
[2:10:55] WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND BEING HEALED AND
[2:10:58] DELIVERED,
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU WANT TO SAY, "LORD,
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; LET THAT SPIRIT COME ON ME AGAIN."
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. because I know who's
[2:11:14] speaking.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; I know whose spirit this is.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you. I have to
[2:11:22] close now. But let's deal with this last
[2:11:25] little quotation here on Moses. Let's
[2:11:27] see what the prophet says about this
[2:11:31] happening
[2:11:33] of Moses.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:11:38] And we could have kept going on and on
[2:11:40] in the evening and evening messenger
[2:11:43] brother Random deals with it
[2:11:46] who the problem is who the leaders but
[2:11:48] he says this in taking sides with Jesus.
[2:11:53] Paragraph 116.
[2:11:55] Musicians can come, please.
[2:12:02] Like Jethro said to Moses, "Why you
[2:12:05] can't you can't beat out all of them or
[2:12:10] God put elders out there, 70 of them
[2:12:13] took the spirit was on Moses and put
[2:12:16] them upon those 70 elders and they
[2:12:19] prophesied."
[2:12:20] And it didn't weaken Moses a bit, it
[2:12:25] strengthened him.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; I wish there was a spiritual application
[2:12:29] we can catch there.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:33] They have weakened brother Moses in
[2:12:36] their camp.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; Can I just keep it like that with Moses?
[2:12:40] They've weakened him,
[2:12:43] but it strengthened him.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; He had just as much prophecy in him as
[2:12:48] he did before they took the spirit off
[2:12:51] of him to prophesy.
[2:12:54] See, he's just separated. said, "Now
[2:12:57] Moses, let them judge the smaller
[2:12:59] things, but when it comes to the major
[2:13:04] things, you come in with them and help
[2:13:07] them like that."
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 153, end time evangelism.
[2:13:17] Can I make this my last one?
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; Who said no? Who said yes?
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; Can I get a vote here this morning? Do I
[2:13:26] need to close or I need to stay?
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; Somebody say go home.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; Somebody say stay for a little while.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; All right, I'll read one more for you.
[2:13:34] God bless you.
[2:13:36] All right. Paragraph 153, end time
[2:13:39] evangelism. He says this here. Now, we
[2:13:42] find out it's the leaders that does it.
[2:13:45] The leaders have always been the mixed.
[2:13:48] Amen.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; Look at old Dayton back there in the
[2:13:51] Bible time in Moses's dispensation of
[2:13:54] the law. He was the one who led the
[2:13:57] mixed multitude. Dayton, it was Kora.
[2:14:00] When God raised his prophet Moses, he
[2:14:02] had the word of the Lord. He had two and
[2:14:04] a half million people out there in that
[2:14:07] desert. And Jethro come up and said,
[2:14:09] "Moses is going to kill you. Your
[2:14:12] burden's so great." God took part of his
[2:14:15] spirit and put it upon 70 elders. And
[2:14:18] they prophesied. It never weakened Moses
[2:14:21] a bit. He But Moses was still the last
[2:14:26] answer
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; cuz he had thus sayeth
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; the Lord.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; Now, if you look real close,
[2:14:36] we can prophesy and preach today because
[2:14:38] God sent a tremendous message in our
[2:14:40] day.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want a double portion of
[2:14:43] that spirit
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; upon me,
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; upon my ministry.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; And if that does take place, it's not
[2:14:51] going to weaken the prophet in my eyes.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; It'll actually strengthen him.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; In my eyes. I believe that. Yes. Yes.
[2:15:00] Yes. I believe that with all of my
[2:15:02] heart. God bless you.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Lord Jesus, we thank you
[2:15:08] for your word this morning.
[2:15:11] We thank you for the great revelation of
[2:15:14] the supreme deity.
[2:15:16] How you have shown yourself to be the
[2:15:19] same yesterday, today, and forever in
[2:15:21] every age. And you prove it. You proved
[2:15:25] it here in this last age. And Lord, I
[2:15:28] want to stand for that
[2:15:31] as
[2:15:33] a witness
[2:15:36] of the change that's happened
[2:15:38] since that revelation struck me. Who is
[2:15:42] speaking
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; when I'm reading the Bible?
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; Who is speaking
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; when I'm listening to
[2:15:52] the tapes of the prophet?
[2:15:56] Oh God, it's been revealed to me who
[2:15:58] that is. It's you, Lord.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; The same yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:16:04] May you strengthen in every heart, Lord.
[2:16:07] May this move the confusion away from
[2:16:09] those that are weak in their faith.
[2:16:12] May it cause them, Lord, to be
[2:16:14] stabilized.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; In the hour that we live in, the great
[2:16:19] falling away that is taking place. But
[2:16:22] Lord, we stay with it. You said in your
[2:16:25] word, you have kept the word of my
[2:16:27] patience. Lord,
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; I will also keep thee during the great
[2:16:32] tribulation.
[2:16:33] And this is what's keeping us Lord. We
[2:16:35] believe that in Jesus name
[2:16:40] we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[2:16:44] Brothers John can come and sing a few
[2:16:48] songs.
[2:16:50] Amen. Let's bow our heads one more time.
[2:16:53] If somebody is here that needs special
[2:16:55] prayer, even if it's an unspoken need,
[2:16:58] I'm going to give this invitation. You
[2:17:01] actually you can come forward for
[2:17:02] prayer, too. It's always open, always
[2:17:05] welcome. You need prayer, you can come
[2:17:07] forward for prayer. I'll lay hands upon
[2:17:09] you and pray for you. Yes, Ezekiel.
[2:17:14] And as he comes and those that need
[2:17:16] hands laid upon them just laying right
[2:17:18] here, let's bow our heads
[2:17:22] and just the
[2:17:24] those of you that have a special request
[2:17:27] in your heart and in your life
[2:17:31] this morning
[2:17:33] for the Lord Jesus Christ. Thinking of
[2:17:36] Sister Edith.
[2:17:38] Edith Wright,
[2:17:41] you called her home. I don't even know
[2:17:42] if she was
[2:17:44] in her 50s,
[2:17:47] 40some, and
[2:17:49] never really got the answer why she you
[2:17:53] didn't answer that for her.
[2:17:56] But Lord, this is not a gimmick. We know
[2:17:58] that. We appreciate that. It's not a
[2:18:00] gimmick, but you keep your word.
[2:18:05] And if you're here today and you have a
[2:18:07] request in your heart, your life
[2:18:10] that God needs to answer for you,
[2:18:14] why don't you slip up your hand? I'll
[2:18:16] pray for you. Thank you for those hands.
[2:18:17] God bless those hands. All those hands.
[2:18:20] Hands all over. So many hands.
[2:18:24] I'll pray. Lord Jesus, you see the hands
[2:18:27] that are raised and what's beneath that
[2:18:30] hand this morning. Father, would you
[2:18:33] answer every one of them?
[2:18:37] Oh God, answer it in your own time.
[2:18:40] Lord,
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; and Lord, we wait upon thee to keep your
[2:18:44] word. We know that you're the healer. We
[2:18:47] know that you're the deliverer. We know
[2:18:49] that all of our answers are answered
[2:18:52] through you and your word.
[2:18:55] Oh God, I pray that you would grant the
[2:18:58] fortitude, the faith to hold steady.
[2:19:03] Lord, as you begin to answer these
[2:19:06] requests for your people, for your
[2:19:08] children, I pray you'll unlock the
[2:19:11] mysteries of their very life. In even
[2:19:15] troublesome times, Lord, tribulation,
[2:19:20] times of tribulation,
[2:19:22] you'll keep us if we keep the word. It's
[2:19:25] the word first.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; Oh God, may you grant that to these
[2:19:30] hands and these hearts. In Jesus name we
[2:19:33] pray.
[2:19:35] Amen.
[2:19:38] Yes.
[2:19:40] accepted
[2:19:43] the word
[2:19:45] of the Lord.
[2:19:51] The revealed
[2:19:55] word
[2:19:57] that was spoken
[2:20:04] by the prophet
[2:20:07] of Malachi.
[2:20:16] Can't you see
[2:20:20] why
[2:20:22] I'm happy?
[2:20:28] I've accepted
[2:20:31] the word
[2:20:34] of the Lord.
[2:20:40] the reveal
[2:20:44] word
[2:20:46] that was spoken
[2:20:52] by the prophet
[2:20:56] of Malachi
[2:20:59] 4.
[2:21:03] Oh, can't you see
[2:21:08] why
[2:21:10] I am happy?
[2:21:16] I've accepted
[2:21:20] the word
[2:21:22] of the Lord.
[2:21:28] the reveal
[2:21:34] that was spoken
[2:21:40] by the prophet
[2:21:44] of Malachi.
[2:21:51] Oh, can't you see
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; why
[2:21:58] I'm happy?

[2:36:50] But God, we we know we don't need to
[2:36:55] trust in our ability to hold on, Lord,
[2:36:58] for

[2:37:43] Father, may we
[2:37:48] just look back, Lord, to the the path
[2:37:52] you've laid for us, Lord. The the light
[2:37:55] you've shed, Lord, and
[2:37:58] walk in it, Lord. Father, keep each one,
