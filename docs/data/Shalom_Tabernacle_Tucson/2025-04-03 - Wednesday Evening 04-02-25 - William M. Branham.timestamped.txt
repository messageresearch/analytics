[0:00] [Music]
[5:11] Yes, I praise
[5:16] him
[5:18] for all he's done for
[5:25] me. He's
[5:27] redeemed and set me
[5:32] free and
[5:36] because just
[5:38] because he is God. Let's stand and sing
[5:43] that one more time. When I
[5:46] come, when I come into his
[5:51] presence, I humble
[5:55] myself. I lift up both my
[5:59] hands and I
[6:02] begin to
[6:05] worship you.
[6:10] I
[6:12] worship
[6:14] [Music]
[6:16] him when I come into his
[6:22] presence. Humble
[6:25] myself, remembering what you've done,
[6:30] all the victories you've
[6:33] won. And I praise him.
[6:40] Yes, I'll praise
[6:46] him
[6:48] for all you've
[6:51] done for
[6:54] me. He's
[6:57] redeemed and set me free.
[7:03] And
[7:06] because just
[7:09] because he is
[7:13] God. Amen. That's why we gather this
[7:16] evening. Just because he is God. We come
[7:18] to worship that name. Amen. Welcome
[7:21] everyone out this Wednesday night. We're
[7:23] so glad to have you, Chip. You with us,
[7:25] our visitors. God richly bless you this
[7:27] evening. Brother Ben, would you come and
[7:29] open in a word of prayer for us this
[7:31] afternoon?
[7:33] [Music]
[7:45] Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we come to
[7:47] thee this Wednesday,
[7:50] Lord. This prayer Wednesday, Lord. We're
[7:53] here looking for your presence, Lord,
[7:56] asking you to please come and be with
[7:58] us, Lord.
[8:00] Oh God, we need you so much in this
[8:03] hour, Lord. Our our mind battles us,
[8:06] Lord. And you told us that the greatest
[8:09] battle ever fought is in the mind. So we
[8:12] ask you to help us, Lord God. Give us
[8:15] the mind of Christ. I pray thee, Lord.
[8:18] You said have the mind of Christ. If you
[8:21] said it, there's a way to have it, Lord.
[8:23] So help us, Lord God. We love you. We
[8:26] appreciate you, Lord. We pray that you
[8:28] bless us. Bless brother Israel, Lord.
[8:31] And oh God, we know that he's in the
[8:34] front line, Lord, him and his family. So
[8:36] I pray that you would bless him, Lord,
[8:39] and keep them in the hollow of thy hand,
[8:41] Lord. We love you this this day, Lord,
[8:44] this Wednesday, Lord. We we're here to
[8:48] worship you, Lord. For you're an object
[8:50] of worship, Lord. You love to be
[8:52] worshiped. The prophet told us that you
[8:54] love us to worship you, Lord. We want to
[8:57] worship you in spirit and truth, Lord,
[9:00] in revelation, Lord. Gratitude in our
[9:03] hearts, Lord, for what you did for us at
[9:06] Calvary. What you did for for us in this
[9:09] hour, Lord, for sending us a prophet,
[9:11] Lord. Oh God, Lord, we we love you,
[9:15] Lord, for sending us a prophet, and we
[9:18] love you for all the things you do for
[9:20] us, Lord. We commit this service into
[9:22] thy hands, Lord. But we ask it in the
[9:25] name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[9:29] Amen.
[9:32] Amen. No one knew how
[9:36] alone I was
[9:40] feeling and the emptiness I tried so
[9:45] hard to hide.
[9:49] Though I laughed and said my life was
[9:53] fine without
[9:56] you. I was covering up the secret tears
[10:01] I've
[10:03] cried. Then one day someone told me of
[10:09] your
[10:12] mercy and the love you showed on a hill
[10:16] called Calvary.
[10:19] [Music]
[10:20] There
[10:22] you purchase my
[10:27] redemption when you broke sin's power
[10:31] and set my spirit free.
[10:36] I'm
[10:39] amazed that you love
[10:43] me. And I'm
[10:45] [Music]
[10:47] amazed how you
[10:50] care. Through your
[10:53] preious blood, I found
[10:57] [Applause]
[10:57] [Music]
[10:58] pardon. And my sins are washed.
[11:04] They're all washed away all my
[11:14] sins. Yes, it's true. There have been
[11:18] days when I've failed
[11:22] you. Lord, you know the many times I've
[11:27] gone astray.
[11:31] But I've learned your love is stronger
[11:35] than my
[11:36] [Music]
[11:38] weakness. And your ear is open every
[11:42] time I
[11:45] pray. No one else has ever cared for me
[11:51] like you, Lord.
[11:54] No other friend could ever be so close
[11:59] to
[12:00] me. And I'm not afraid to face the
[12:05] problems of
[12:09] tomorrow. Knowing you are everything
[12:13] I'll ever need.
[12:18] I'm
[12:21] amazed that you love
[12:24] me. And I'm
[12:28] amazed how you
[12:32] care through your
[12:35] preious blood. I found
[12:40] pardon. And my sins are washed. They're
[12:46] all washed away. All my
[12:50] sins are
[12:52] washed away with all your heart this
[12:56] evening. I'm
[12:59] amazed that you love me.
[13:04] Yes, I'm
[13:07] amazed how you
[13:10] care. Through your
[13:14] preious blood, I found
[13:19] pardon. And my sins are
[13:23] washed. They're all washed away. All my
[13:29] sins are
[13:31] washed away.
[13:35] And my sins are washed. They're all
[13:41] washed away. Oh, my sins are
[13:47] washed
[13:49] away. Amen. Let's give our Lord a hand
[13:52] of praise this evening. Amen. You may be
[13:55] seated or we'll go to the key of F.
[14:03] There's a light in the
[14:07] window. The table spread as
[14:12] splendor. Someone standing by an open
[14:19] door. I can see the crystal river, so I
[14:25] must be near forever.
[14:29] Lord, I've never been this home. Sick
[14:36] before. See the bright light
[14:40] shine. It's just about home
[14:45] time. I can see my father
[14:49] standing at the
[14:53] door. This world's been a wilderness.
[14:58] I'm ready for
[15:02] deliverance. Lord, I'll never been this
[15:07] home sick
[15:11] before. I can see the family
[15:16] gathered. Sweet faces are familiar.
[15:22] No one's old feeble
[15:29] anymore. This old lonesome heart is
[15:34] crying. Think I'll spread my wings for
[15:38] flying. Lord, I've never been this home
[15:43] sick before.
[15:47] Oh, see the bright light
[15:51] shine. It's just about home
[15:56] time. I can see my father
[16:01] standing at the
[16:04] door. This world's been a
[16:09] wilderness. I'm ready for deliverance.
[16:15] Lord, I've never been this home sick
[16:22] before. Just see the bright light
[16:27] shine. It's just about home
[16:32] time. I can see my father
[16:37] standing at the door.
[16:41] [Music]
[16:42] This world's been a
[16:45] wilderness. I'm ready for
[16:51] deliverance. Lord, I've never been this
[16:55] home sick
[17:00] before. Amen.
[17:04] Lord to take my
[17:10] life and form
[17:13] it. Take my
[17:18] mind and transform it.
[17:22] Take my
[17:26] will, come for
[17:29] it, to
[17:32] yours, to
[17:34] yours, to
[17:40] yours.
[17:42] Holiness,

[17:48] for.
[17:49] Holiness is what I need.
[17:58] Holiness,
[17:59] holiness is what you want from
[18:05] [Music]
[18:08] me. So take my
[18:14] life and form it.

[18:38] yours, oh
[18:44] Lord. Righteousness.
[18:47] Righteousness is what I've long
[18:52] for.
[18:53] Righteousness is what I
[18:59] need.
[19:01] Righteousness.
[19:03] Righteousness is what you want from
[19:08] me. We'll take another verse. It's
[19:10] faithfulness.
[19:16] Oh,
[19:17] faithfulness,
[19:19] faithfulness is what I'm long
[19:23] for.
[19:25] Faithfulness is what I
[19:31] need. Oh,
[19:33] faithfulness,
[19:35] faithfulness is what you want from me.
[19:44] Oh, please take my
[19:50] life and form
[19:53] it. Take my
[19:57] mind and transform
[20:01] it. Take my
[20:05] will and come for
[20:09] it to yours to yours. Let's raise our
[20:14] hands and sing it to him one last
[20:16] time. Take my
[20:21] life and form
[20:24] it. Take my
[20:28] [Music]
[20:31] mind. Amen. Let's all stand.
[20:36] I
[20:37] will
[20:40] conform to
[20:42] yours. To
[20:44] yours, to yours, to
[20:48] yours, to
[20:50] yours, to
[20:52] yours, to yours, to
[20:56] yours, to
[20:58] yours, to
[21:00] yours, oh Lord.
[21:04] Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless each of you
[21:09] this evening. We're so happy to be in
[21:11] the house of the Lord once again to hear
[21:14] the word of the Lord. Amen. Are you
[21:16] happy to be here? Amen. God is so good
[21:19] to us. Amen. He just keeps blessing us
[21:22] over and over again. And when this life
[21:25] is over, we get to go to heaven. What
[21:28] about
[21:29] that? That's a great deal. Amen. And I'm
[21:32] glad to be a Christian tonight. With all
[21:36] the tests and trials of life, I'm happy
[21:38] to be a believer. I wouldn't take
[21:41] nothing from my journey now. I'm so glad
[21:44] to be a Christian following this word
[21:48] and I get to hear the word of the Lord
[21:50] again tonight. The Lord's given us the
[21:53] opportunity to do that. Amen. And so
[21:55] we're going to do that as we uh prepare
[21:58] to listen to the message influence 1963.
[22:02] Brother Brandon preached that right here
[22:03] in Phoenix. And we'll go to paragraph
[22:08] one through paragraph 122. Amen. We like
[22:12] to welcome our visitors here, our
[22:15] brother from up north there, brother
[22:19] Ginsky. Bless him. Amen. Let's make him
[22:22] feel welcome. Praise the Lord.
[22:26] Yes.
[22:27] Amen. And um so as we prepare to go
[22:31] there, let's
[22:33] [Music]
[22:35] sing that song. Only believe.
[22:38] Amen.
[22:45] Only believe.
[22:50] All things are
[22:54] possible.
[22:56] Only
[23:00] believe.
[23:01] Only

[23:54] believe. All things are
[24:00] possible. Lord, I
[24:04] will. God bless you. You may be seated,
[24:06] brother Brennham.
[24:12] Morning. It's very nice to be here this
[24:15] morning to hear this fine report of how
[24:18] the Lord's work is growing. Praise God.
[24:21] That's what we're here for. That's what
[24:23] we're happy to always hear. The work of
[24:25] the Lord
[24:27] increasing. And uh when I got up this
[24:30] morning, I I thought I did you an evil.
[24:33] Uh I brought some Indiana weather down
[24:36] to visit
[24:37] you. I was for my first time I seen ice
[24:42] in Phoenix outside of the ice house, you
[24:44] know. But this was on the street this
[24:46] morning. Ice. My wife got up and she
[24:49] said, "Is this Phoenix?" I said, "I
[24:51] think so." She would come in wrong last
[24:54] night, but it was certainly surprising
[24:57] to see ice in Phoenix. Well, I said, "If
[25:00] you can just get roused up enough to
[25:03] come over to the breakfast, the ice will
[25:05] all melt over there."
[25:08] cuz the presence of the Lord always
[25:10] melts away all the coldness.
[25:13] So glad to be here this morning with
[25:15] brother and sister William and brother
[25:17] Rose and all the staff and so happy to
[25:20] be back at the rimada again. There's
[25:22] something about this place and I sit
[25:25] along the roads in my travel. I think
[25:27] about the meetings I've been in here
[25:29] before of the Ramada. And we're here now
[25:33] to start a series of meetings with our
[25:37] brethren around through the valley prior
[25:40] to the the businessman's
[25:43] convention. And uh how many ministers
[25:47] are here this morning? I see your hands
[25:48] everywhere. Oh, this is Well, we're in
[25:51] business or we're still let them know
[25:54] that we're in business, too. The
[25:56] greatest business in the world, saving
[25:59] souls. Amen. And we ministers are
[26:02] certainly happy this morning to join
[26:04] hands with this staff of of Christian
[26:07] layman to um for helpers and partners in
[26:11] this work to help save souls to the
[26:14] kingdom of God. So grateful for this
[26:19] effort. I was listening the other day on
[26:22] a radio broadcast as I was driving along
[26:25] and there was an attorney that said
[26:30] uh a great remark that I thought was
[26:33] outstanding. He said how it is that in
[26:37] this day that we know that we're facing
[26:40] the end
[26:41] time. He said, "And to see layman and
[26:47] ministers just settle
[26:50] down and not get their righteous
[26:53] indignation stirred uh to see the world
[26:57] so grossed in sin as it is that both
[27:01] minister and layman should be pressing
[27:03] every moment to
[27:06] the coming of the Lord so close at hand
[27:09] and we don't seem to be enthused about
[27:13] as we should be. I was speaking the
[27:16] other
[27:17] day on the subject of being
[27:21] sincere. Uh we believe as full gospel
[27:24] people that we have the truth, the truth
[27:27] of the gospel. We realize that there's
[27:30] much we can improve
[27:31] on on this and we're looking forward to
[27:36] the time that when all the loose ends of
[27:38] these great revivals has come across the
[27:42] world in the last few centuries. Well,
[27:45] since the falling away of the church and
[27:48] then the dark age and then these great
[27:51] warriors came forth for truth and they
[27:53] would live long enough to get it kind of
[27:55] halfway established and then little
[27:57] loose ends would run out. We're told in
[27:59] Revelations 10 that there'll be a
[28:02] messenger in the last day will gather up
[28:04] these little ends and will bring them
[28:07] together and then the mystery of God
[28:10] would be finishing at the sounding of
[28:12] this angel which was a messenger of the
[28:14] earth. Then one came down from heaven
[28:16] with his hands up rainbow over his head
[28:19] and swore that it'd be time no more. An
[28:22] angel taking an oath. And when we see
[28:26] this things
[28:29] materializing, oh, how sincere we should
[28:33] be.
[28:35] All promises of God are true, but their
[28:38] own conditions. No matter how
[28:40] fundamentally right we are, we've got to
[28:43] approach it in the right way.
[28:46] Now, man can be fundamentally right and
[28:49] still not receive the blessings of God
[28:52] because it's approached in the wrong
[28:54] way. It goes upon conditions. For
[28:57] instance, when Ahab and Jehoshaphat was
[29:00] together and Rama Gilead really belonged
[29:03] to Israel fundamentally because the
[29:05] lands divided by
[29:07] Joshua through Joshua by God had been
[29:12] given to Israel and the Syrians has
[29:15] taken the the land and filling the
[29:19] stomachs of the enemy with the food that
[29:22] should been given to Israel.
[29:23] Fundamentally, Ahab was
[29:26] right. And that's the reason 400 Hebrew
[29:29] prophets with one accord was
[29:32] prophesying, go on up to Ram with
[29:34] Gilead. Fundamentally, they were
[29:37] right. But Ahab wasn't right himself.
[29:41] And when this one little man stood up by
[29:43] the name of Micah, the son of Ammon, and
[29:46] saw a vision, now one man's vision
[29:49] against 400 trained prophets.
[29:52] But the man's vision compared with the
[29:55] word, that's the reason he knew it was
[29:57] right. And see, it's on conditions. We
[30:01] must be sure when Hana prophesied and
[30:04] tucked the yoke off of Jeremiah's neck
[30:08] that Israel was to be uh the vessels of
[30:12] the Lord rather down and under
[30:14] Nebuchadnezzar and all the kingdoms
[30:16] around had been given to this
[30:18] heathen
[30:21] Nebuchadnezzar down in Babylon. And here
[30:24] was Israel making their sacrifices and
[30:26] just as religious and fundamentally as
[30:28] they could be. But yet the sincerity had
[30:32] lifted and they was given down there for
[30:36] for slaves to serve Nebuch
[30:41] Nebuchadnezzar for all these
[30:43] years. And Jeremiah had
[30:47] a yoke around his neck and God had told
[30:49] him no matter what prophet prophesies,
[30:51] what dreamer dreams or anything else
[30:55] contrary to what he said, it was wrong.
[30:59] And there stood up hea just as sincere
[31:02] as any man could be and prophesied with
[31:05] a message, "Thus sayaeth the Lord."
[31:08] Well, of course, the people could clap
[31:10] their hands on that. That's true. Thus
[31:12] sayeth the Lord, the he they'll be back
[31:15] in two years in the sight of two full
[31:18] years and walked up to that vindicated
[31:21] prophet, tucked that off of his neck,
[31:23] and broke it and said, "Thus sayeth the
[31:25] Lord." Remember what Jeremiah said,
[31:29] Hana, amen. So be it. The Lord perform
[31:33] your words. But let us remember there's
[31:35] been prophets before us. They prophesied
[31:38] against great kingdoms, against war, so
[31:41] forth. But a prophet is only known when
[31:43] his prophecy comes to pass.
[31:46] And Hanan broke the yoke. And then you
[31:49] know what? God told him. I think we
[31:52] Pentecostal
[31:54] people fundamentally full gospel is
[31:58] truth but there's more goes with
[32:02] it is that deep
[32:06] sincerity of what God has given us. We
[32:09] must approach it with respect and and
[32:13] love
[32:15] and and a humble attitude. I think
[32:18] that's what we need. And now in this
[32:22] coming meetings I I really don't know
[32:24] where I'm going. Brother William, it's
[32:26] around from place to place uh amongst my
[32:30] brethren. All of you pray that God will
[32:33] help us that there will be the sick
[32:36] healed and there will first thing let me
[32:39] say first there will be souls saved and
[32:43] and believers filled with the Holy
[32:46] Spirit, the sick people healed. God
[32:49] receive glory and his church grow for
[32:52] the kingdom of
[32:54] God. And I'm here to help in every way
[32:57] that I can in this. I have I think it's
[33:01] mostly full gospel people of the the
[33:05] assemblies of God and the four square
[33:08] and the church of God and the oneness
[33:10] brethren and all all together. And
[33:14] that's the way I I like it where we can
[33:16] go to each place and all come together
[33:18] and Pentecost is really not an
[33:23] organization. It's an experience that we
[33:26] find that our little thoughts that used
[33:30] to be in years gone by that just one
[33:32] group called the Pentecostals and all
[33:34] got this blessing. We find that God just
[33:37] tore our little ideas all to pieces.
[33:40] He brought in Catholics, Presbyterian,
[33:43] Methodist, Baptist.
[33:46] He gave those the Holy Ghost who served,
[33:49] did his will. And he doesn't change. He
[33:52] cannot change. His attitude must always
[33:54] be the same. His decisions are perfect
[33:56] to begin with. He has to alter nothing.
[33:59] His words, he's sovereign. He has not to
[34:02] change anything. And he never does
[34:03] change. So, we're happy this morning
[34:06] that Christ lives. And as the song said,
[34:10] how do you know he lives? He lives
[34:12] within our hearts. And we know that.
[34:14] We're sure of it. So, approaching the
[34:17] revival, coming on from church to
[34:19] church, and then back here to the rim
[34:22] for the convention. Let's go with
[34:25] reverence, deep
[34:27] sincerity, humble praying, and believing
[34:31] God. Now, I know
[34:34] we stay a little long each time, but I
[34:37] don't want to do that in these meetings.
[34:39] I want to get in there and get the
[34:42] people out and get home and do what I
[34:44] can for the kingdom and take off
[34:47] somewhere and pray the rest of the night
[34:48] if I want to talk a while with the Lord
[34:50] and not hold you off while I'm doing
[34:52] it. And now this
[34:55] morning feel like this breakfast is kind
[34:58] of an
[34:59] opening to the this is the alpha and at
[35:04] the last the convention is the omega of
[35:06] the of the revival. And now let's just
[35:09] bow our heads a moment sincerely as we
[35:13] approach his throne of
[35:15] grace. And there's no doubt but what
[35:18] there's many requests in here this
[35:20] morning. But while we're praying and
[35:22] you'd like to be remembered, would you
[35:24] just raise your hand and hold beneath
[35:26] that the secret that you want God to do
[35:29] for you? Thank
[35:34] you, Most Holy and Reverend
[35:39] God, the Almighty. We approach thy
[35:43] throne. Now as we come up from this
[35:47] place called the
[35:49] Ramada
[35:51] in we pass beyond by faith the moon, the
[35:55] stars over the Milky White way into the
[35:58] presence of God as we stand by his great
[36:03] white
[36:04] throne looking across to
[36:07] that golden lights where God alone can
[36:12] dwell. We see
[36:15] between we and this altar there is a
[36:19] bloody sacrifice laying
[36:22] there as our brother and sisters so
[36:25] expressed it
[36:27] apolog
[36:30] Jesus. And he promised when he was here
[36:32] on earth if you ask the father anything
[36:35] in my name I'll grant
[36:38] it. There we see him today standing
[36:41] there to make good every word and every
[36:45] promise that he
[36:48] made. And we pray heavenly father that
[36:51] you
[36:52] will let us come into thy presence with
[36:58] sincerity and with faith believing now
[37:02] that you will answer this that we are
[37:04] asking.
[37:07] And the first of all things we ask for
[37:11] ourselves, the forgiveness of all of our
[37:16] trespasses and all the things that we
[37:19] have did which should be innumerable,
[37:21] Lord.
[37:25] And we pray that you will forgive us.
[37:29] And let that precious blood of the
[37:33] sacrifice on the altar this morning
[37:36] cleanse us from all
[37:39] unrighteousness, all
[37:43] selfishness, and all that's contrary,
[37:46] Lord, to thy great commandments and thy
[37:49] desires for us.
[37:53] May we this morning, Lord, in a another
[37:57] way or in another
[37:59] time consecrate ourselves to
[38:03] thee and in our
[38:07] humility believe that you're going to
[38:11] stir revival through this valley.
[38:16] And we are so weak
[38:20] Lord to try to undertake such a great
[38:23] effort. It would be totally
[38:27] impossible. But thou, oh God, can take
[38:30] the weak things of the
[38:33] earth and can make mighty works of God
[38:37] by them.
[38:40] We humble ourselves as
[38:43] believers and asking that you will take
[38:46] these weak
[38:49] vessels and
[38:51] will work your works through
[38:55] them that we might see a great
[38:59] results when this meeting is
[39:02] over. that the work of God has began to
[39:06] be made
[39:08] manifest aresh in this
[39:11] valley. Bless all of our
[39:14] brethren, the churches, each
[39:18] denomination, all of its
[39:21] members, and this
[39:24] businessman, this ley who is has
[39:27] consecrated their lives to thee. We
[39:30] pray, Father God, that you'll bless them
[39:33] in their coming
[39:37] convention. And all together, Lord, work
[39:41] your glory through us that others might
[39:45] see the good things of God and long to
[39:49] serve him.
[39:52] We commit these things to you with love
[39:54] and respects in faith in the name of
[39:58] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[40:07] Now I would like this
[40:10] morning, God willing, to open the
[40:13] scripture if you wish to now to the book
[40:15] of
[40:17] Isaiah.
[40:19] And this being a businessman's meeting,
[40:23] yet their main business is getting souls
[40:28] right with God. That's what they're
[40:31] dedicated
[40:33] to. And we are wanting to speak on the
[40:37] gospel and the sincerity and the
[40:40] approach to it. And let's begin reading
[40:44] now from Isaiah 6. The first chap the
[40:47] first verse of Isaiah 6 reading down
[40:51] including the
[40:55] e. And in the year that
[40:58] kingiah died, I saw also the Lord
[41:01] sitting upon a throne high lifted up and
[41:04] his train filled the
[41:07] temple. And above it stood the serap.
[41:11] Each had six wings. With twain he
[41:15] covered his face, and with twain he
[41:17] covered his feet, and with tween he did
[41:21] fly. And one cried to another, said,
[41:26] "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of
[41:30] hosts. The whole earth is full of his
[41:33] glory."
[41:35] And the post of the doors moved at the
[41:38] voice of him that cried, and the house
[41:41] was filled with
[41:44] smoke. Then said, I, "Woe is me, for I
[41:48] am undone, because I'm a man of unclean
[41:51] lips, and I dwell in the midst of a
[41:53] people of unclean
[41:55] lips. For mine eyes have seen the King,
[41:59] the Lord of
[42:00] hosts." Then flew one of the Sarah. unto
[42:04] me, having a live coal in his hand,
[42:08] which he had taken with the tongs from
[42:10] off the
[42:12] altar. And he laid it upon my mouth, and
[42:15] said, Lo, this has touched thy lips, and
[42:20] thine iniquity is taken away, and thy
[42:23] sin is purged.
[42:26] Also I heard the voice of the Lord
[42:29] saying, "Who shall I send and who shall
[42:33] go for us?" Then said I, "Here am I,
[42:38] send
[42:42] me." I wish to draw from this little
[42:47] text some context on some notes that I
[42:51] have written down here. And if I should
[42:54] give it a title, I would like to call it
[43:00] influence. You know, there's so many of
[43:02] us and most all of us
[43:06] uh influence somebody by the things that
[43:09] we do and the way we live and the things
[43:11] we say. We influence
[43:15] somebody. Somebody is watching your
[43:20] life. And then when we profess to be
[43:25] Christians, what type of life should we
[43:29] live? If
[43:31] somebody is watching us and your life
[43:35] that you live will reflect an influence
[43:38] on somebody that
[43:40] might it might be the their eternal
[43:44] destination will rest upon the way that
[43:47] you live and the things that you do.
[43:51] for they watch
[43:54] him. And in our text this morning as
[43:59] influence, we find that this king
[44:04] Uzi was
[44:07] a a great influence to Isaiah, the the
[44:11] young prophet.
[44:14] Isaiah had been called to his
[44:17] side and being uh noted a vindicated
[44:22] prophet of his
[44:24] day and he had a I believe the way that
[44:29] Isaiah spoke it, he was uh uh had a
[44:34] great influence upon Isaiah.
[44:38] Now we find that Uzekiah was called to
[44:44] be king at the age of about 16 years old
[44:48] after his father's death. And his father
[44:52] was a a great
[44:54] believer and he had his mother also was
[44:58] a very fine
[45:01] woman. And this young king had been um
[45:07] crowned at a young age and quickly he
[45:12] taken the road that was
[45:14] right because of the influence of a
[45:18] godly father and a godly mother.
[45:22] And I think that's a very fine example
[45:26] for we parent
[45:28] today is to set an example before our
[45:33] children. Now you'll live your your best
[45:37] and your worst at
[45:39] home. And I think that our lives though
[45:43] that children might not just exactly act
[45:47] like they're noticing it, but they are
[45:50] noticing it. Don't you never think that
[45:52] they are not because they're
[45:56] watching. Not only the children are
[45:58] watching, but the neighbors are
[46:01] watching. Not only the neighbors are
[46:03] watching, but the uh all that you are
[46:07] associated with watches. The people at
[46:10] your church watches. The people that you
[46:13] do business with in the markets, they're
[46:17] watching you after your confession.
[46:21] And we should always try to reflect
[46:25] Christ in everything that we
[46:27] do. I know a little motto that I had
[46:30] hanging in my house many years ago.
[46:35] I picked it up one day when at Billy
[46:38] Sunday's tabernacle when I was at one of
[46:40] the meetings up at um in Wona
[46:44] Lake and I liked it so much till I I got
[46:48] it and hung it up in my house and I kept
[46:51] it until it just fell apart. It was
[46:54] something like this.
[46:56] go no place you would not be want to be
[47:01] found if Jesus should come and uh be
[47:06] saying nothing that you would not want
[47:08] to be
[47:09] seeing if Jesus should come and it went
[47:14] on with many things saying what you and
[47:18] otherwise whatever you do or say or
[47:21] whatever action that you're performing
[47:25] do not do it If you would not want to be
[47:28] caught in that position when Jesus
[47:32] comes, if we can only do that, I'm sure
[47:37] we'd be a great influence upon our
[47:42] associates.
[47:44] And you know the right, there's two ways
[47:48] to do anything. That's right and wrong.
[47:51] I had my little son Joseph on my lap the
[47:54] other day and I said to him, he's eight
[47:57] years old and some little boy had uh
[48:00] stepped on his toes and he and the
[48:03] little boy had a fight. So I said,
[48:06] "Joseph, don't don't do that." He said,
[48:08] "But daddy, he did such and such." I
[48:10] said, "But that doesn't matter what he
[48:13] did. Just remember, Joseph, that you
[48:17] love your father." He said, "Yes,
[48:19] daddy." I said, "Then remember that
[48:22] people are going to look at your life as
[48:26] a minister,
[48:28] son." And then if you do anything wrong,
[48:32] then they're going to say, "Does this
[48:35] minister permit his child to do such?"
[48:39] Now, we know they do it anyhow. But, uh,
[48:42] we know that as Christians, we know that
[48:45] we try to bring up our children, right?
[48:47] But uh it's a good thing to keep that be
[48:51] front before all the time that do what's
[48:54] right. Don't don't ever take that other
[48:56] side. So um I said because you see that
[49:01] doesn't only reflect on you Joseph but
[49:03] it reflects on your mother, reflects on
[49:06] your sisters, it reflects on your father
[49:09] and the very cause of the family. what
[49:13] we're standing for and then what we
[49:16] stand for, it reflects on that on Jesus
[49:20] Christ. You don't want to do that. I
[49:22] said our our Lord told us if we're if
[49:26] somebody smites us on one cheek, just
[49:28] turn the other. And of course, that's
[49:30] kind of hard for a little boy with a
[49:32] high temper to begin with to to think of
[49:35] such things, but place it before him
[49:37] anyhow. See that he should not do it.
[49:41] Now this young fellow Yuskiah had such a
[49:46] training in his early days to when he
[49:49] taken the
[49:50] throne. He never turned right or left
[49:55] from the thing that was right. He stayed
[49:58] right with it. He never let politics
[50:04] influence him in any way. He was a man
[50:07] who was determined to serve God
[50:11] regardless. And so politics didn't he
[50:15] ignored all of those things. And another
[50:17] thing that I liked
[50:19] about was that he ignored popularity or
[50:24] popular opinions. No matter what anybody
[50:27] else thought or what the popular trend
[50:30] of the day was, he wanted to serve God
[50:36] regardless. Oh, we need man like that.
[50:41] That's right. In our uh political world,
[50:46] we need man like that in the White
[50:49] House.
[50:51] We need man like that in business.
[50:54] We need man like that in the pull pit.
[50:59] Man that will not turn to popular
[51:03] opinions or
[51:05] popularity but will stay straight with
[51:08] the word.
[51:11] Not turn right or left.
[51:16] God in commission Joshua said, "This
[51:18] book of the law shall not depart out of
[51:21] thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate
[51:24] therein day and night, and then thou
[51:27] shall make thy ways prosperous. Then
[51:30] thou shalt have good
[51:32] success." And not only that, but you're
[51:35] influencing somebody the same way you're
[51:38] traveling.
[51:40] And so I appreciate uh the stand
[51:45] that took to be determined. The first
[51:49] thing he began to do was to repair the
[51:52] house of the Lord and to build up the
[51:54] places that had been torn down and then
[51:57] go out to the enemy after he proved to
[52:00] God that he was sincere and he he was
[52:03] going to take the right stand regardless
[52:05] of what his uh people around him is uh
[52:09] advisors to influence him to a political
[52:12] side of the of the kingdom. He would not
[52:15] stand for it. Hallelujah. He wanted
[52:18] God's will in that alone.
[52:21] That's the kind of man we need, the kind
[52:24] of mothers we need. A woman, a mother of
[52:28] this day that will take the right stand.
[52:32] And do what's right regardless of what
[52:34] the other women does. Do what's right.
[52:40] It's such a pity to see our nation in
[52:43] such a scrimml as it is today.
[52:49] I got up a little late this morning to
[52:51] get to the breakfast and I I went to a
[52:53] place and to get some coffee and this a
[52:56] little lady come out to serve me and she
[52:59] had wife and I were sitting there and
[53:00] she had her eyes blue, you know,
[53:04] that stuff over her eyes. And um I seen
[53:08] one of those in Los Angeles one time,
[53:10] the first one I ever seen the ladies
[53:12] made up in that way. I I I thought that
[53:15] I I was going to walk up and tell her I
[53:17] was a missionary and I'd seen flaggery
[53:21] and leprosy and but I'd never seen
[53:23] anything like that. And I was going to
[53:26] ask her if I could not pray for her and
[53:30] and I and tell me what kind of a disease
[53:32] she had and I was a little afraid of it
[53:37] and I never seen anything quite like it.
[53:40] And I when I walked over, I was waiting
[53:42] for brother
[53:43] Arganbright and uh one of the
[53:46] businessmen and the officials and
[53:49] another girl walked up looked just like
[53:52] her. I would say I I might be wrong here
[53:56] that she might have did that herself and
[53:59] it was a very attractive girl would have
[54:03] been if she had just washed her face and
[54:05] looked like a human but she was so now
[54:09] when some of these movie
[54:12] stars are somewhere I don't know where
[54:14] it comes from when they will do a thing
[54:18] like that some woman with some kind of
[54:20] an influence then that influences is
[54:22] arrest the nation and try to do the
[54:24] same.
[54:27] That's right. When our Pentecostal women
[54:30] was allowed to cut their hair because
[54:31] some minister lay down in the pullpit,
[54:34] then the rest of them said, "Well, so
[54:35] and so's wife does it, can't we?" See,
[54:38] it's the influence that you place up on
[54:40] some of them. This little lady this
[54:42] morning was such a nice little lady. She
[54:45] was a very sweet and just as respectable
[54:49] as she could be. And when we she left
[54:52] the table and turned
[54:54] around, my wife looked across the table
[54:56] at me and I said, "You know, it's just a
[55:00] pity
[55:01] that some
[55:04] devil, and I'm not reluctant to say
[55:07] devil, that has coped up such a
[55:12] thing to bring our American women under
[55:15] such influence as that healing
[55:18] trace.
[55:23] influence. Somebody started it. Well,
[55:26] don't you never go by watch some s
[55:29] somebody of this country, I don't care
[55:32] other country or or some minister's wife
[55:35] or somebody else, don't you never be
[55:37] influenced for them. You let the Bible
[55:39] influence you
[55:41] to the thing that's right. And that's
[55:44] wrong.
[55:47] now. And then we we shout and dance and
[55:54] speak in tongues and and uh the glory of
[55:58] God we claim is on
[56:00] us and then go out to such as that.
[56:06] There's something wrong.
[56:09] I believe in these things, these uh
[56:12] shouting and speaking in tongues and
[56:15] dancing in the spirit. But brother, how
[56:18] could God tolerate such a thing as that
[56:22] when he's against it?
[56:25] And he says so in his word. Hallelujah.
[56:29] And our women has become in our churches
[56:33] uh which is merely practiced many times
[56:36] dressing sex appeal.
[56:39] It's very seldom ever spoke against from
[56:41] the pulpit. And yet we shout and jump
[56:44] around and speak in
[56:46] tongues. That's the reason that this
[56:49] great move called Pentecostal is not
[56:52] getting any worse because there's no
[56:54] sincerity behind it. It becomes an
[56:56] emotion. Glory to God. And because I say
[57:00] them things, many say he's a woman
[57:03] hater. He He's different from It's not
[57:06] trying to be different. It's trying to
[57:08] be sincere.
[57:10] I believe that we're in the last days
[57:14] and we got a a great message,
[57:19] but all of our shouting and speaking in
[57:21] tongues will be of no effect.
[57:24] You can see it among us. You can see
[57:27] that we're growing in numbers. But are
[57:30] we growing in power?
[57:34] We're still on the same grounds that we
[57:36] were when we started 40 years ago where
[57:39] we should already be over in the
[57:40] promised land
[57:45] influence. One minister's wife let down
[57:47] and did this and one minister started so
[57:49] and so and the rest just started. Oh,
[57:52] may we like uh the Ezekiah here that
[57:57] let's not let nothing influence us but
[58:00] the word of God.
[58:03] Let that be our influence.
[58:07] Uh bring ourselves back to the faith,
[58:11] back to the correction of the scripture,
[58:15] no matter what the rest of the world has
[58:16] to
[58:17] do. And we brethren, many of the
[58:20] brethren who belong to organization
[58:22] which practically it's all got little
[58:25] groups. I have nothing against that.
[58:27] That's all right. But when we going to
[58:29] get the place that we feel that ours is
[58:32] the only group that we got it and the
[58:35] other fella hasn't got nothing to do
[58:36] with it that is being influenced by the
[58:41] higherups in the organization that we
[58:44] should make our organization to grow. We
[58:46] are to make the kingdom grow.
[58:50] We are here to
[58:52] influence and we will never be an
[58:55] influence to the outside world as long
[58:58] as we're trying to influence them to
[59:00] some organization because they've been
[59:02] that before we were born.
[59:05] Let's take the stand for God and his
[59:08] word and fellowship and get all
[59:11] brethren. Let us not draw a line and say
[59:14] if you don't tow to this, let's reach a
[59:16] hand across the line. Amen. Be brethren.
[59:20] That's the reason I have been so sold on
[59:23] this year. Christian businessman's full
[59:26] gospel fellowship. That's the reason
[59:29] that Methodists and Presbyterians and so
[59:31] forth where the ministers could not seem
[59:33] to reach across
[59:36] there. But the businessmen broke down
[59:39] those
[59:40] traditions. They're helping doing that
[59:42] thing. Now, if we can just keep it beat
[59:44] out of their heads to
[59:46] organize, which it looks like they're
[59:48] headed that way, and when they do,
[59:51] that's me out because I'm here to stand
[59:55] for what is true.
[59:57] [Applause]
[1:00:01] You never want that. That's the thing
[1:00:04] that very I wish to speak on one of
[1:00:06] these nights. Samson standing that same
[1:00:09] place. So uh somewhere along the line
[1:00:13] now let's watch what our influence is.
[1:00:17] Now we see uh uh Uzzekiah here. He was a
[1:00:22] great man and we find out because that
[1:00:26] he took those terrific stands that he
[1:00:29] did that you know his kingdom was next
[1:00:32] to
[1:00:33] Solomon's he spread out even all the
[1:00:37] countries around about uh loved him and
[1:00:41] and they paid tribute to his kingdom.
[1:00:44] And we find out even weighed down in
[1:00:48] Egypt, his influence was
[1:00:51] felt. And this being the way he stood in
[1:00:55] this young prophet standing there before
[1:00:56] the king, he it was a great influence to
[1:01:00] Isaiah. how that God would bless any man
[1:01:05] that would be true to his word,
[1:01:07] regardless of what his politics tried to
[1:01:10] influence him to, regardless of what
[1:01:12] anything else tried to
[1:01:14] be. Hezekiah was determined to stay with
[1:01:18] the word and God blessed him and Isaiah
[1:01:22] saw
[1:01:23] it. I bet as
[1:01:26] usual, just like a group of
[1:01:29] people, just like the remark that I said
[1:01:32] about the
[1:01:34] businessman,
[1:01:36] when
[1:01:37] Uzzekiah begin to feel
[1:01:41] secure and he had just about got
[1:01:43] everything in the kingdom that God had
[1:01:45] for him, he got lifted up in his heart.
[1:01:50] Now, that's what's happened to our
[1:01:54] denominations all through the ages when
[1:01:58] they feel like they're big enough to
[1:01:59] say, "Now, we're
[1:02:01] that," then they get lifted up and
[1:02:04] that's when God leaves them. That's
[1:02:06] right. And if the businessman gets to
[1:02:08] that
[1:02:09] spot where we have, as brother Williams
[1:02:12] said,
[1:02:13] 15, but God can do more with 15 in his
[1:02:17] hand than he could with 1500 out of his
[1:02:19] hand. That's right. That's true. But we
[1:02:22] appreciate 1500 in his hand instead of
[1:02:24] 15 in his hand. If they'll all stay in
[1:02:27] his hand, that's the main thing. being
[1:02:32] influenced not by what great numbers we
[1:02:35] are, but by what a great God that we're
[1:02:38] representing
[1:02:41] and the kind of life that is in us by
[1:02:44] him that will influence others. Jesus
[1:02:48] said, "You are the salt of the earth."
[1:02:51] But if the salt has lost its savior, it
[1:02:54] is henceforth good for nothing, cast
[1:02:56] out, caught under the feet of man. We
[1:02:59] must never forget that we are salt. But
[1:03:03] if its salt loses its strength, that's
[1:03:06] its its power to
[1:03:11] contact. And salt can only save as it
[1:03:14] contact. And if it loses its power of
[1:03:17] contact, then it is no more salt, but
[1:03:19] it's sand.
[1:03:23] It's to be made
[1:03:24] walks. And when we lose our influence as
[1:03:28] a father, as a mother, as a Christian,
[1:03:33] as a businessman, as a minister, when we
[1:03:36] lose our influence with
[1:03:39] people. Now, we can be very popular in
[1:03:42] the line of the world and go wrong with
[1:03:44] the world. But I mean as what we
[1:03:46] represent, we represent Christ.
[1:03:51] When we lose our influences
[1:03:54] that as standing out, how can we blend
[1:03:58] in with the day when God so against the
[1:04:01] day? How could Micah say, "Go on up and
[1:04:04] prosper? My vision's right with yours."
[1:04:07] When he know that God had cursed that
[1:04:10] evil
[1:04:11] people, his vision had to be contrary.
[1:04:16] And a man's vision today that could go
[1:04:18] with the trend of the world and still
[1:04:20] remain a minister. There's something
[1:04:23] wrong with the man's vision.
[1:04:26] You know what God said about this rich
[1:04:27] Leoian church? Put him on the
[1:04:31] outside. We cannot stand with the
[1:04:34] popular belief and vote of the day.
[1:04:36] We've got to be against that thing.
[1:04:40] Now, so it this king got along fine
[1:04:45] until he found out that all the nations
[1:04:47] were steering him. He become largely uh
[1:04:51] populated. His kingdom got built up and
[1:04:53] he got lifted up in his heart with
[1:04:57] pride. You see, we're just I'm just a
[1:05:00] big man
[1:05:01] now. And that's the way out. The way up
[1:05:05] is down. How do you know which is up or
[1:05:08] down?
[1:05:10] Because if the world stand in space, how
[1:05:12] do you know which is up or down? So
[1:05:16] always he that humbles himself, God will
[1:05:18] exalt. Hallelujah. He that exalts
[1:05:20] himself, God will bring to a base. Amen.
[1:05:23] He'll bring him down. Always keep humble
[1:05:26] and be little in your own sight.
[1:05:30] No matter what God does for you, just
[1:05:31] see how much more humbler you can be all
[1:05:34] the time. More God blesses you, just
[1:05:36] keep get more humble all the time. He
[1:05:39] can continue to bless. But when you get
[1:05:41] to a place you think, I got it. You
[1:05:43] haven't got it.
[1:05:45] You're on your road out.
[1:05:50] You lose your influence. You lose the
[1:05:53] the strength of your
[1:05:55] testimony. When you women begin to uh
[1:05:59] want to be like the rest of women,
[1:06:02] there's something wrong.
[1:06:04] When you man, you ministers be trying to
[1:06:07] become like uh pattern after somebody
[1:06:09] else. When you businessmen trying to do
[1:06:12] business on the scale that somebody else
[1:06:14] would do it on because they're prospers,
[1:06:17] prosperity don't always represent
[1:06:20] success in Christ. Sometimes very much
[1:06:23] to the contrary. That's right.
[1:06:29] Now pride he got lifted up and he
[1:06:32] thought what a great fellow I
[1:06:35] am so much he got lifted up till he
[1:06:38] tried to take the place of
[1:06:41] a
[1:06:45] minister. He goes into the
[1:06:48] temple which p picked up the censure of
[1:06:51] fire and went up to the altar of
[1:06:54] incense.
[1:06:55] Now that was only consecrated man can do
[1:06:59] that. Now as I have said before so say
[1:07:03] that
[1:07:03] again businessmen are not
[1:07:07] preachers. We preachers have enough time
[1:07:09] to try to keep this thing straight. Let
[1:07:12] alone
[1:07:14] businessmen. You all are businessmen not
[1:07:17] ministers. And don't take the place of
[1:07:20] one or try to because you're not called
[1:07:22] for such.
[1:07:24] If you want somebody to speak at your
[1:07:26] conventions, get a
[1:07:27] preacher. Somebody's called to do
[1:07:30] so. Because you see what a struggle us
[1:07:34] ministers has
[1:07:35] got. So, you see what you do?
[1:07:41] And Hezekiah here, he tried to to take
[1:07:46] the place of a priest. He thought,
[1:07:47] "Well, God's blessed me. Why can't I do
[1:07:50] it?" Don't you never get that in your
[1:07:52] head?
[1:07:54] God calls and predestinates and forains
[1:07:58] to his glory. Nothing. You remember in
[1:08:02] the Bible when Moses was bringing Israel
[1:08:05] out of Egypt across to to the promised
[1:08:07] land, do you remember one in there,
[1:08:10] Dayan and those who got lifted up and
[1:08:12] said, "Now wait a minute, Moses, you try
[1:08:14] to be the only one on the beach. There's
[1:08:16] other holy men among here." And God
[1:08:18] said, "Separate yourself because I will
[1:08:20] destroy him."
[1:08:22] God had orained a certain thing to be
[1:08:25] done and it must be done that way.
[1:08:29] We're not to inject our own ideas. We're
[1:08:31] to respect his idea and his
[1:08:34] commandments.
[1:08:37] And not referring back to our sisters,
[1:08:39] but at the no matter what the other
[1:08:42] woman does, God's got your pattern laid
[1:08:44] here. That's right. No matter what uh
[1:08:48] some other layman done in the Bible,
[1:08:50] God's got your pattern here. What to do?
[1:08:52] We'll get to it after perhaps what the
[1:08:54] layman is to do. And the
[1:08:58] minister, all of us has our places and
[1:09:01] we must abide in our calling. Now, we
[1:09:05] find out that this man got lifted up. So
[1:09:07] he uh uh took the sensor and went forth
[1:09:10] to the altar which was only permitted by
[1:09:13] God to consecrated man to that
[1:09:18] office. He tried to take the minister's
[1:09:20] place and then the minister tried to
[1:09:23] correct him. We find out that four score
[1:09:26] priests besides the high priest come
[1:09:28] after him and told him sir. In other
[1:09:30] words like this God has blessed you.
[1:09:33] You're an honored man. You're a great
[1:09:36] man.
[1:09:38] And God has blessed you in your work,
[1:09:40] but you you shouldn't do that. You're
[1:09:42] getting off of the beaten
[1:09:45] road. Oh, how I could say some things
[1:09:51] here. Yes. Getting off the beaten road.
[1:09:55] But uh be it the thing is the way it is,
[1:09:58] let's try to conserve what we can get a
[1:10:01] hold of.
[1:10:02] think uh he said you're off the track
[1:10:05] for the word of God says so and so only
[1:10:10] Aaron's generation shall do this for
[1:10:13] Aaron and him alone
[1:10:15] and his children so king we honor you
[1:10:19] respect you a great man but don't try to
[1:10:22] do that and was he
[1:10:25] humbled no sir he thought God's blessed
[1:10:28] me so I'll just do what I want
[1:10:31] do. Now, watch my
[1:10:36] brethren. Be careful there because no
[1:10:40] matter how much God has filled you with
[1:10:42] his spirit and how much that you have
[1:10:44] done and how well you've been blessed,
[1:10:46] you stay with the calling of God.
[1:10:50] Don't get off on some traditions and
[1:10:53] organizational schemes and so forth. You
[1:10:56] better come back to the path. better
[1:10:58] come back to what God laid down at the
[1:11:01] beginning. Now, so we find out that this
[1:11:05] man when he was corrected instead of
[1:11:07] humbled himself and admitting that the
[1:11:10] word was right and God was right, he
[1:11:13] become
[1:11:15] angry. In other words, uh uh he was
[1:11:19] ready to kick him out of his
[1:11:20] organization. He was uh he was very
[1:11:23] upset about it, very perplexed and oh he
[1:11:27] got angry and he have to turn around and
[1:11:28] say now you just wait a
[1:11:31] minute you realize who I
[1:11:33] am now when you're corrected by the word
[1:11:37] of God you must be subject to the word
[1:11:43] and he said uh he would do as he pleased
[1:11:46] he was the head of the thing so he he'd
[1:11:48] just do as he wanted to and you know
[1:11:50] what happened. He was smitten with
[1:11:53] leprosy. And while his anger, rage was
[1:11:56] upon him, the priest detected the
[1:11:59] leprosy in his
[1:12:02] face.
[1:12:04] Now you say, well, what you mean leprosy
[1:12:08] represents is is a type rather of
[1:12:12] sin. And when a man won't stand
[1:12:15] correction by the word of God, he's full
[1:12:19] of leprosy.
[1:12:21] blows up and carries on. What does you
[1:12:25] what do you do? You ruin your
[1:12:28] influence. See, something
[1:12:31] happens. People knows and can tell the
[1:12:34] word that you're corrected by that
[1:12:37] you're not going to do
[1:12:39] it. Therefore, you ruin your influence.
[1:12:43] And it hurt this fellow. Anger got on
[1:12:46] him. And while he was in his anger,
[1:12:49] leprosy was in his face. And we find out
[1:12:53] that he not only did he drop the censor,
[1:12:56] but he ran from the house of God to
[1:13:00] never be able to return
[1:13:02] again. Because no matter how great he
[1:13:05] was and how much influence he had had,
[1:13:08] he when he was
[1:13:10] corrected then he refused to take his
[1:13:13] correction because his social standing
[1:13:15] had become more to him than the word of
[1:13:17] God had become.
[1:13:20] I'm sure you understand what I'm driving
[1:13:23] at. It become more to him. His position
[1:13:27] as king become more to him than the word
[1:13:29] of God.
[1:13:31] When this businessman's organization
[1:13:33] gets to that
[1:13:35] place, when the minister of his
[1:13:38] organization gets to that
[1:13:41] place, then he's done.
[1:13:45] Don't faint when you're
[1:13:47] rebuked. When you read something in the
[1:13:49] scripture and you know that you should
[1:13:51] humble yourself and follow the word of
[1:13:53] God in the path that he ordained for you
[1:13:55] walk in, then you don't do it. Then
[1:13:57] first thing you know, it's over. your
[1:14:00] influence is spoiled. Now we must
[1:14:03] remember that and this young prophet
[1:14:05] what a lesson that was to him. Then when
[1:14:08] he seen this
[1:14:10] king by this very thing, Isaiah learned
[1:14:14] one of his greatest lessons that no
[1:14:17] matter how great a man might be, how
[1:14:20] much influence he might have, but when
[1:14:23] he fails to walk in light, when he fails
[1:14:28] to obey
[1:14:30] God, then his influence is ruined and
[1:14:34] he's stuck off the field.
[1:14:37] Another thing Isaiah learned, he learned
[1:14:40] by this, that God orders his man to his
[1:14:46] place. Not you putting yourself in that
[1:14:49] place, but God puts his man in place.
[1:14:53] We must recognize that. I've often used
[1:14:56] this. Uh I like to hunt, as you know, up
[1:14:59] in the north when when the winter starts
[1:15:02] coming in, little ducks is born up there
[1:15:03] on the ponds. And as soon as that first
[1:15:06] cold breeze uh tops the mountains and a
[1:15:09] few flakes of snow falls, now that
[1:15:12] little duck was born in the spring up on
[1:15:14] that lake and he never was off the lake.
[1:15:17] He knows nothing about anything else but
[1:15:19] that lake. But just as sure as that
[1:15:21] breeze blows and he feels that breeze
[1:15:23] blow, he runs right out in the middle of
[1:15:26] that, swims out there and raises a
[1:15:29] little nose up the air and honks a few
[1:15:31] times and every duck on the pond will
[1:15:33] come right to him. And he'll raise up
[1:15:36] with
[1:15:37] that instinct in him knowing that soon
[1:15:40] that pond's going to be
[1:15:44] frozen as he can go.
[1:15:48] He will. Why? There's something in him.
[1:15:52] It's a God-given instinct and he uses
[1:15:55] it. It guides him. Now, what does it do?
[1:16:01] What if he went a if that instinct led
[1:16:04] him farther north, then he would know
[1:16:07] there was something
[1:16:08] wrong and those ducks wouldn't follow
[1:16:11] him because he's going contrary to the
[1:16:15] regular path. And when we get ourselves
[1:16:18] to a place that we try to lead people
[1:16:20] contrary, they say, "Well, we the
[1:16:22] Methodists has got it. We the Baptist
[1:16:24] has got it." That isn't
[1:16:26] it. God's got it.
[1:16:30] That's right. And in the beginning was
[1:16:32] the word and the word is with God and
[1:16:34] the word was God and the word still is
[1:16:36] God.
[1:16:38] So it's God that's God.
[1:16:42] So let's lead that way down the beaten
[1:16:45] path.
[1:16:46] Hallelujah.
[1:16:48] And not try to lead some other way. And
[1:16:50] then we find out that this little duck
[1:16:54] being that he was now the rest of the
[1:16:56] ducks seem to have any uh anything but
[1:17:01] amen. Because there something about that
[1:17:04] little fell that they knew the way that
[1:17:06] honk that bugle that he blowed. They
[1:17:10] they knew that he had the truth.
[1:17:15] And there's something about the gospel
[1:17:18] for the power of the resurrection of
[1:17:20] Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:17:23] Paul said, "If the trumpet gives an
[1:17:25] uncertain sound, who will know how to
[1:17:27] prepare himself for a battle?" Now, but
[1:17:30] when the gospel gives a sound, Jesus
[1:17:34] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[1:17:36] forever. And we watch it and see that
[1:17:38] it's the truth and it's with the word,
[1:17:40] that's the thing that influences a real
[1:17:42] devil.
[1:17:43] Now there's others on the pond like
[1:17:45] water guineies and so forth they have
[1:17:47] another way mud hins and all such but
[1:17:50] they stay their own way but the real
[1:17:52] duck goes on God placed that little duck
[1:17:55] there and give him that because God
[1:17:58] placed him to be that and now God has
[1:18:01] set in the church
[1:18:03] God not the
[1:18:05] organization not the achievement of man
[1:18:08] to make bishops and so forth presbyers
[1:18:11] but God set in the church first apostles
[1:18:15] that's missionaries second prophets
[1:18:19] teachers pastors evangelists God set
[1:18:21] them in the church and every bugle will
[1:18:25] blow the same the same gospel.
[1:18:29] If he's a prophet he blows the bugle of
[1:18:32] prophet he foretells the things that is
[1:18:34] to come and hits every time.
[1:18:37] Now a little girl come to me the other
[1:18:40] day. She may be sitting present now and
[1:18:43] she said, "Brother Brandon, uh, I gave
[1:18:45] you a dream and I in this dream I I had
[1:18:49] a certain thing I I want you to tell
[1:18:50] me." And I sit down. Now, if there's any
[1:18:54] out in here outside of Pentecostal
[1:18:55] realms, let me excuse myself to you a
[1:18:59] moment. And she said, "You never told me
[1:19:02] my dream." I said, "Honey, sit down just
[1:19:05] a minute."
[1:19:07] And I said, "Your father and mother are
[1:19:10] very good friends of
[1:19:11] mine, retired farmers who came from a
[1:19:15] long ways to sojourn with us." And I
[1:19:18] said, "They they believed me as a
[1:19:20] servant of Christ. You're just a child
[1:19:23] about 12 years old. I think she goes to
[1:19:25] school with my Becky." And I said,
[1:19:27] "Look, you're going to meet a lot of
[1:19:29] things out here, honey, in the name of
[1:19:32] Christianity."
[1:19:34] And I said, 'When you find a man that's
[1:19:35] got every interpretation just like this,
[1:19:38] got every this just like that in the
[1:19:40] name of the Lord, I said, 'You be
[1:19:42] careful about that. That's contrary to
[1:19:44] the
[1:19:45] scripture. Jesus said there was many
[1:19:47] lepers in the days of Elijah, but only
[1:19:49] one was sent to
[1:19:51] him. One, many widows in the days of
[1:19:54] Elisha, but only one was he sent to many
[1:19:57] things that Jesus did not do. Many times
[1:20:00] those gimmicks, it's got to ever answer.
[1:20:02] Be careful.
[1:20:04] When somebody stands up and speaks in
[1:20:06] the name of the Lord, that must be true.
[1:20:09] It must be exactly the truth. You might
[1:20:13] in your mind be impressed. I said, "Now
[1:20:15] honey, I believe I could tell you what I
[1:20:18] think your dream is, but to tell you in
[1:20:20] the name of the Lord, no sir, cuz she
[1:20:22] knows the things." I said, "Have I ever
[1:20:25] spoke to you in the name of the Lord
[1:20:26] about what had
[1:20:27] happened?" I said, "Thousands has come
[1:20:30] and said this, that." I said, "I cannot
[1:20:32] tell you what your dream is till I see
[1:20:33] it over again." And then he tells me.
[1:20:35] Then I say, "The Lord told me." Until
[1:20:37] then, I don't know. I don't want to take
[1:20:39] my own influence, my own opinions. I
[1:20:41] can't say thus sayeth the Lord because
[1:20:43] that's me thinking it. That's the best
[1:20:45] of my opinion. We must be sincere
[1:20:48] because we've got the greatest thing in
[1:20:50] the world. The greatest treasure of
[1:20:52] heaven is Christ among us. Why do we
[1:20:54] want to substitute some little influence
[1:20:56] to try to make ourselves somebody big
[1:20:58] among somebody here? Why not be a humble
[1:21:01] servant to Christ?
[1:21:03] And I said, "That's the reason I can
[1:21:05] tell you about the Bible." I said, "If I
[1:21:08] told you I was going to Arizona, I
[1:21:10] suppose your mother and father is going
[1:21:12] along to the businessman's convention."
[1:21:15] Said they are. I said, 'What if I told
[1:21:17] you the first night, I told you now in
[1:21:18] the name of the Lord that there would be
[1:21:20] a a woman coming in crippled and should
[1:21:22] be such a way as you've heard it said.
[1:21:24] And then that woman has been crippled
[1:21:26] for so many years, immediately after
[1:21:28] prayer, she'll get up and walk away. I
[1:21:30] said, what if I would tell you then in
[1:21:32] the middle of meeting a lady had a
[1:21:33] waterhead baby and as soon as we prayed,
[1:21:36] the baby's head was going normal. At the
[1:21:38] end of the meeting, there would be four
[1:21:40] men bearing a dead man that had been
[1:21:42] dead for so many days, they brought him.
[1:21:45] They were wearing dark suits and
[1:21:46] describe them. And as soon as I asked
[1:21:49] our heavenly father, his spirit would
[1:21:51] return to him. And I said, "But you know
[1:21:54] it has taken place." Now I said, "Then
[1:21:57] I'd say your little brother," he's a
[1:21:59] little 5-year-old toen. I said, "What if
[1:22:01] he gets killed on the street and he's
[1:22:04] going to get killed and you're going to
[1:22:05] bring him to me and I'll be standing by
[1:22:08] a a doorstep where there's a man with a
[1:22:10] light suit on. I'll be speaking to him
[1:22:12] and your little brother is going to be
[1:22:14] made whole. Now I said then if that
[1:22:17] taken place what if you went out there
[1:22:19] then and that
[1:22:21] woman arthoratic or whatever it was
[1:22:23] paralyzed woman wasn't
[1:22:29] there? What if the waterhead baby wasn't
[1:22:32] there? Then you're all mixed up in your
[1:22:36] mind. You don't know. and I spoke to you
[1:22:38] and told you thus sayeth the
[1:22:43] Lord. I said then my influence is
[1:22:48] lost. You might need me sometime real
[1:22:53] bad. I said, "But what if the woman is
[1:22:56] there? What if the waterhead baby is
[1:22:59] healed? What if the man is raised from
[1:23:01] the dead? Then your little brother gets
[1:23:03] killed. You wouldn't even cry. You say,
[1:23:06] "Daddy, let me have him. I'm going to
[1:23:08] show you the glory of God." Why? It was
[1:23:10] right here. It was right there. It was
[1:23:12] right there. It was right there. Every
[1:23:14] time it's right,
[1:23:16] then you know it's right. I said,
[1:23:18] "That's the reason we want to believe
[1:23:19] the word of God." In the Garden of Eden,
[1:23:22] it was spoke of a Messiah to come for a
[1:23:24] savior. The prophets foresaw it. He came
[1:23:27] just exactly the way the Bible said.
[1:23:30] Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a dream and
[1:23:31] Daniel interpreted him of the kingdoms
[1:23:33] of the Gentiles perfectly every time and
[1:23:36] everything the Bible has ever spoke of.
[1:23:39] The Bible says it year. History says it
[1:23:41] happened. The Bible said year. History
[1:23:43] says it happened. Now we're at the time
[1:23:46] of the
[1:23:46] rapture. It's going to happen because
[1:23:49] it's been perfect every other time. It's
[1:23:52] got to be perfect this time. God is
[1:23:55] calling out a people. Hallelujah. And
[1:23:57] it's a time. That's it. We got to be
[1:24:16] sincere. Amen. We thank God for his word
[1:24:19] tonight. Amen. So, let
[1:24:22] us take these requests. First, we have a
[1:24:26] few uh praise
[1:24:28] here
[1:24:29] tonight. We can all stand to our
[1:24:33] feet. Brother Kim's little grandson
[1:24:37] Charlie, he was released home and he
[1:24:40] wanted to thank the church for praying
[1:24:41] for him. And let's thank the Lord for
[1:24:45] that, for bringing that little baby
[1:24:47] home. Also,
[1:24:50] um, Brother Trevor got a job. He told me
[1:24:54] he's been praying about that. So the
[1:24:56] Lord answer their request for a job for
[1:24:58] brother Trevor. How many can say praise
[1:25:01] the Lord for that.
[1:25:03] Amen.
[1:25:05] So yeah. So we thank the Lord for that.
[1:25:08] By way of announcements, as we announced
[1:25:10] before that brother Ron's meeting are
[1:25:13] this weekend and also Jericho Tabernacle
[1:25:16] with brother Marco Santana, they have
[1:25:19] meetings and brother Chris Long in um
[1:25:24] Cottonwood. He has meetings this
[1:25:26] weekend. So be in prayer for for all
[1:25:29] those brothers and the meetings that
[1:25:31] they have.
[1:25:35] I want to keep brother Dave Cook in
[1:25:37] prayer. Dave Cook Jr. He had a surgery.
[1:25:41] Um, and the doctors couldn't finish the
[1:25:45] operation because the way the tumor was
[1:25:48] placed near his brain there. So, they're
[1:25:52] trusting the Lord to bring him through
[1:25:54] this. And um, we put ourselves in their
[1:25:59] shoes. Amen. and we go to the Lord
[1:26:02] thinking, "What if that was my dad or or
[1:26:04] me or my spouse or my family member?"
[1:26:09] He's one of us. He's a believer. And so,
[1:26:13] let's go to the Lord for our dear
[1:26:15] brother, Brother Dave Jr., he's a fine
[1:26:18] brother. How many know him? Fine
[1:26:20] brother. We love him. And so, we're
[1:26:22] going to pray to the Lord for him.

[1:27:11] Wilson. Amen. Also pray for one another.

[1:50:40] said my thoughts in
[1:50:42] heaven was louder than my voice on
[1:50:46] earth. And I just been meditating on
[1:50:48] that. Sometimes we let little thoughts
[1:50:51] come and we can't stop them from coming
[1:50:53] but we start dwelling on them. And those
[1:50:57] thoughts, he can hear those. And so what
[1:51:00] if my thoughts are clean and righteous
[1:51:02] and holy and that's what I want. That's
[1:51:06] the atmosphere I want in my life. Don't
[1:51:08] you? Amen. Lord, help us. Amen. We'll
[1:51:11] sing that.
