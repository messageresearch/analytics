[Music] [Music] e [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen praise the Lord good morning bless you we like to go right into our adults uh Sunday School portion of the service and we'll find our scripture reading in Revelations chapter 6 ask you to stand we're going into the second seal we'll just take two verses there as it pertains to that seal verses number three and um 3 and four the paragraph in this uh second seal that we're listening to is paragraph 134 through 183 amen so before we read the word let us pray Lord Jesus we come to you this morning Lord thanking you for bringing us together once again Lord we ask that you'll bless our services today Lord bless the Sunday School uh the first little class and the second AR teenage group that class Lord bless them and bless our class here this morning Lord just the portion of the word may we hear something that we need for our souls today bless those that are on their way here Lord we just thank you we ask that you would just be with us now we pray amen amen Revelation 6 verse number three three and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see and there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword amen and so let's sing only [Music] believe only [Music] only believe that all things are possible only [Music] believe only believe only believe all things are power Possible only be God bless you you may be seated brother brenon that's what the tree put its forth its first branch and that's what happened and if that tree ever puts forth another Branch they'll write another book of Acts behind it because you see the same life got to be in the same name so now today when we look over our denominational churches Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Luther Church of Christ soall and Pentecostals and things where do we find that you don't find it I will admit that the Pentecostals has the closest thing two three is because they're up here in the lady of sin Church age they had truth and rejected it they got lukewarm with it and God spewed them from his mouth exactly according to the scriptures you can't make them scriptures lie they're going to be truthful always don't try to only thing don't try line your thought up uh to the the scriptures up to your thought but align yourself up with the scriptures that's then you're running with God no matter how much you have to cut away or lay aside line up with that look what it did the first time it fell well if God acted like that the first time he's got to act like that the second time he's got to act like that every time or he acted wrong the first time see we as models we can make mistakes God can God's first decision is perfect and the way he chose to do things there can't be no other better way he can't improve on it because it's perfect to begin with if it isn't then he is an infinite and if he's infinite then he's omn Miss and if he's omn Miss he's omnipotent amen he's got to be that to be God see so you can't say he learned more he didn't learn more he's a he's the very Fountain of all wisdom our wisdom here come from Satan We inherited it from Eden where we swapped off faith for wisdom Eve did it now he was first called Antichrist the second stage he was called the false prophet because that Spirit among the people become incarnate you remember the white horse rider now had no Crown when he started but then he would was given a crown why he was a Cadian Spirit to begin with and then he become incarnate in a man and then he was crowned and received a throne and was crowned and then he served that for a long time as we see as we the seals break and then we find out after that long time Satan was kicked out of heaven and he come down according to the scriptures and enthroned himself just thing enthroned himself self in that man and become a beast and he had power supreme power like that he done all the Miracles and everything that that the uh killings and bloody fights and everything that that Rome could produce all right he killed by cruel Roman punishment just oh how we could break in some scriptures here remember Jesus Christ died under the punishment of Rome capital punishment the message that I've got my heart to preach up here at this next meeting on Good Friday afternoon meet three four things see there they crucify him there the Hol religious place in the world was Jerusalem they the most Most Holy supposed to be people in the world the Jews There They Crucified the most cruel punishment that Rome could produce crucified him what the greatest person that ever lived Hallelujah There They Crucified him my God helped me to swing into that bunch of business man they can see where they're standing now not to be different not to be nasty but to shake that to them brothers can see that they dignitaries and holy fathers and things are writing up in this businessman's journal is nonsense Christians are not supposed to call any man father God they start that I've tried to help him and everything I can you see know where this tape go so I'm finished I certainly won't have anything else to do with it all right first remember Christ first as Nick nicadan and what did the nicadan age ask for it asked to get away from them A bunch of people that shouts and claps their hands and looks like disgracefully like they on Pentecost act like drunk men staggering in the spirit and things they didn't want know that stuff they said they were drunk and when the celebrity listen don't miss this it may sound crazy to you but it's the truth when the the dignitaries begin to come in they couldn't stoop to that right what makes God big is because he's big enough to stoop down God that's what makes him big there's nothing bigger and he stooped the lowest that anybody could stoop any human being ever stoop he was a king of heaven and he come to the to the lowest city on the Earth Jericho and he got so low to even the shortest man in the town had to look down on him the SC is that right zachus that's right he was called a worst name that any human being could be called a sorcerer a devil the elub that's what the world thought of me died the cruelest death didn't have a place to lay his head amen kicked out by every organization but when God exalted him so high till he has to look down to see Heaven God in humility and give him a name so great that as the whole family of Heaven is named after and every family there the Earth all the family on Earth is named Jesus all the families in Heavens in the name Jesus am and such a name that every knee will bow and every tongue will confess to [Music] him either here in hell hell will bow to it everything else will bow to it see but first it was humility then it become great let God exalt he that humbles himself God will exalt now we notice this nickel Spirit wanted with wisdom smarter it had to reason out like it was in Eden reason against the word of God by the wisdom and the church fell for what was it now let's say take this church here and take a bunch of people like we are if he wasn't real spirit filled and let's take say h nothing against the mayor of our city I don't think I know him Mr but off is he still mayor I I don't Mr but off's a fine friend of mine but say the mayor of the city and all the police force and uh and uh all the marshals and they they all come here the first thing you know if they got this a little thing in their head begin to talk to the board and the people around here and say now you know what this ought to be different if you're not spirit filled and got a real spirit filled man behind the pull pit the first thing you know be catering to him maybe not this generation maybe the next generation and that's where it started in see why they were saying look at here it's reasonable you you listen to say a man come in here there could say this church is too little let us build a big church I'll build you when out your it'll be worth so much money a half a million dollars it'll be put in there I'll put the thing on the broadcast when they do that then they got to AAG grind nine times out of 10 you know one of them kind first thing you know then if he does he runs things to suit himself you can't stay him because brother John do back there he's a finan of this church and then you get a little Ricky out of some Seminary and knows about his much about God as a hot and toop does about Egyptian Knight and he'll come along there and he'll cater to that guy because he buys him a new car all the time lets him ride around buys him this that and the other now that's exactly how it started out Ryan notice wisdom and smartness they said now look here isn't only sensible now are are women what difference does it make how they wear their hair but the Bible says it does make a difference just take that one thing besides the hundreds of others see it does make a difference God said it made a difference so it is a difference but you see if they get that started the trustee board deacons and everything the first thing you know the pastor either gets in or gets out that's all it's the people that voted it in all right now notice that Spirit begin to move and the church that's that that got so much dignitary in it so much big things and so much money started after a while they listen to it and fail for it the crudeness of the and that's the very thing that Eve done in the Garden of Eden now you hear that that's right look the Natural Woman Adam's bride before he come to her as a wife fell for the Satan's scheme against the word of God by reasoning it before Adam lived with Eve as a wife Satan beating there that's right you heard the brid tree I preached on that's talks up see all right now notice there Eve fell for reason now he Satan tried to read she said but the Lord said he said oh you know but surely the Lord want yeah you you want to be wise you want to know something well you're nothing but a dumb child see you ought to know something if that isn't Satan if that isn't some of these modern oh they're just a bunch of holy RS don't P hisy don't wor now the natural first Bride of the human race before her husband come to her she fell from Grace by listening to Satan's lie after God had her fortified behind his word if she stayed behind the word should have never fell now that's in the natural notice a natural woman and what was the curse the actual curse of coming out from behind God's word now remember she believed about 98% of it but she just had to let one thing go see she believed a whole lot of it oh certainly Jesus said this and Satan Adit that's right if he can just get you on one corner that's all he wants see only thing you have to do is give the bullet a little twist this way and miss the target see that's all now she believes so much of it but yet missed it now and the and the results because she left the word for one little speck of a reason I say now what about the women or why you want to talk about something like that but any of those little things what's the difference for initial evidence it's something to it you got it's got to be straightened out we pursued that through seven Church ages almost but the Hours come when God speaks it he don't only speak it but he shows it and vindicates it and proves it right if he doesn't do it then isn't God that's all God stands behind his word notice now now the Natural Woman woman caused natural death because she listen to reason to make herself lies make herself wise instead of staying behind the word and doing what God told her to she wanted wisdom and be wise and she listened to reason and and she lost the whole human race now this time the spiritual woman the bride of Christ that started on the day of Pentecost with the early Apostolic Church lost the same thing amen at the NAA Council Lee you know that's right and it aasia Council when she swapped her spiritual birth rights to take Constantine's big churches and things that he offered there am and she sold out her scriptural birthrights for a bunch of Roman D now that's hard on the Catholic but the Protestant has done the same thing and representing the Bible here as a daughter of the Harlot of the that's right it's exactly right every one of them that's right no excuses but out of there has always been a little remant right along that goes to make the bride noce she lost her birth rights see before her husband got to her yeah see before the wedding she lost her virtue and now you remember that she said I said as a queen I have no need of nothing and that lady of seeing age there I'm rich increased in Goods so forth and all the whole world looks up to me I'm the Great holy church and so forth were this way the whole age and he said you don't know that you're a naked blind miserable wretched poor and don't know it that's the condition now if the holy spirit said the condition to be that way in the last days it's that way there's no way of getting around it that's the way it is now what now when she sold her birthrights back there her virtues right out the word what did she do when Eve did it she lost the creation whole creation fell under now notice and when the church did it except the dogmas instead of the spirit and the word it cursed the whole system amen every denominational system that ever was or ever will be was cursed with it and fell there's no other way when you get a bunch of man together to figure out anything one's got to head this way one's got to head that way and one's got to head this way they put the things together and Shake It Up and when it comes out that's what you got it that's exactly what they did at the N Council that's exactly what they do at the Methodist Presbyterian Church of Christ the rest of them and man no matter what God reveals to him you got to teach it the way their credential their Tre Creed says or they kick you out don't tell me I've been there and I know it and that's just exactly what's happened so the whole thing's cursed no one of the Angels said come out of her my people not partakes of her plag because she's going to she's cursed and she's got to suffer the curse of God's wrath upon her because she sold her virtue in right Hallelujah but oh my but remember seeing all that condition but yet God promised in Joy 225 he going to put it down and the last days when he said what the polymer worm left the caterpillar eaten what the caterpillar left the the Locust is eating what the Locust eating just on down bug after bug had come and eat on that church until finally it was nothing but a stump right what what the Romans left the lutherans eating what the Lutheran left the methodists eating what the methodists left the Pentecostals was eaten see until she's down to a stump and do you know what you take those worms in there that Locust and caterpillar and so forth and you chase them down through the uh the book and find out it's the same worm in just different stages what your point so is these seals it's the same worms amen you're going to see it when we bring it out so I'll tell you now it's the same worm all the time four those worms four here and are the same thing it's the same Spirit what one left the other eat what this left the other eat like that so they brought it to a stump but Joel said I will restore sayth the Lord all the years the caterpillar's eaten what is it how is he going to do it if it started out Antichrist but being against the teaching of Christ that accepted Dogma instead of word and through the years the reformers has plunged at it as the Bible said but in the last days at the sounding Revelations 101:7 he said the mysteries of God will be finished in the last days at the sounding of the Seven Angels Malachi 4 said that he would send Elijah before the evil Day come upon the earth when he burn it like a furnace and he would restore and would bring back the the children to the faith of the Father the original Apostolic Pentecostal Faith promised to be restored amen hallelujah now that's just as plain as scripture can say it now it's promised and if we're in the last days something's got to happen and it is happening amen and we're sing amen praise God praise the Lord amen [Music] hallu [Music] oh [Music] h [Music] h [Music] h [Music] oh [Music] h [Music] h [Music] h [Music] h [Music]

evening I will help him if he should fall oh but I want him to love me just because he really wants to to walk with me by his own way but in a slight trace of sadness came back into his eyes as he

Lord and pray for them as well and um um we just look forward to What the Lord Has for us today and for the service this evening will you pray yes amen all right Daniel chapter 5 5 verse number one basar the king made a great feast to thousands of his Lords and drank wine before the Thousand Bel shazar whilst he tasted the wine commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem that the king and his princesses his wives and his concubines might drink therein then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the Temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem and the King and his princesses his wives and his concubines Drank in them they drank wine and praised the gods of go of gold and of silver and of brass and of iron of wood and of stone in that same hour in the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand and wrote over against the Candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king's Palace the king saw the part of the hand that wrote then the king's countenance was changed and his thoughts troubled him so that the joints of his loins were loosed and his knees smoted one one against another verse 25 and this is the writing that was written many many tel euphrasian this is the interpretation of the thing many God hath numbered thy kingdom and finished it Tio Thou Art weighed in the balance and are found wanting perz the kingdom is divided thy kingdom is divided and given to the mes and Persians amen so let let us pray once again Lord Jesus we ask your blessings on this word and blessing on your people we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated we've been talking about this beginning and ending of the Gentile dispensation and we know that we are in the Gentile dispensation we shared with you the quotations the scriptures Daniel chapter 2 chapter 7 of the image of gold that that the King Nebuchadnezzar saw Daniel gave the interpretation of what the silver and the brass and iron and the clay and what they all meant and the Lord showed Nebuchadnezzar the beginning and ending of the Gentile dispensation showing him the time time of the Gentiles and we've been bringing those things and and um we see the the rock that was taken out of the mountain and it smot the great image and that image was bursted into powder and then the rock that smoted it rose up and became a great mountain and we know that that rock was Christ and that was speaking of the coming of the Lord can I get a witness this morning and the title of our message this morning is closing Days of Grace the closing days of grace and so we know that we are in the day of Grace right now and um it's a beautiful thing but it's sad also because that's all that we know we don't know what judgment looks like in a major way we only know one side of Grace the other side of Grace is God's judgment and we know that day is coming and so we the gentile people should be greatly appreciative of the day that we live in this is the day of Grace it's just like you know reading the history of Wars but we don't really know what wars uh what that means us As Americans we don't know um we haven't been in a war where it's come on our our our land on our ground I believe maybe the the last one that's of note is the Pearl Harbor when the Japanese snuck up on us and blew up on the coast there right there in Pearl Harbor and declared war on us um and that was a great we didn't know where it was coming from we didn't know exactly how how comprehensive it was but then you know we did what we did we got into the battle and fight and we did what we did but you know relatively speaking we I personally don't know what it is to be in war countries do other countries are in war now like what's going on in the Ukraine what's going on at in Israel at the border there what's going on in several countries they're in the time of war and it's a very difficult time for those folks those people we are concerned on you know if it's it's too cold in the house or if we got you know something where are we going to eat not if we're going to eat it's like where and what we're going to eat we made that a big old deal now it's not about the hunger it's about the experience of eating and the different flavors and the things that we call important but we know that there is a uh we are in the day of Grace but the time clock has been started on us and our time is winding winding up and if you are a True Believer you understand that the day that we're living in is not going to remain this way we know that there is coming you know in the foreground in the background just beyond the next set of of whatever whatever presidency or the next set of of circumstances is a great another happening and we um could be ushered right into something that we've never seen before and we realize that in in in word form we realize that because the word of God tells us that but do we know what it is in reality and so but but we thank God for this day of Grace don't we we thank God that we can actually go somewhere and pray without being forced to pray I mean we're not nothing's on fire or nothing is burning as yet we have the freedom to come and go we can come to church we don't have to we can stay late if we want to we can actually go to work get a job get three jobs actually we can build our wealth and build and go and come because this is the day of Grace God has given that to us God has given this nation liberties and freedoms that many nations wish they had and in all of the bad that we have done and all of the bad that's on our records and so forth there still it's a great nation to serve the Lord in we have the Lord on our money and God We Trust we call oursel a Christian Nation is that right we have what we call the freedom of religion kind of sort of and we are a Godly Nation part of the time sometimes we have liberty and justice for all but not everybody really some and so we we know that these things these these words and the things that we talk about as it pertains to this nation U that you know we experience that and we thank God for it and we say In God We Trust we can say in God we used to trust we can say it was the freedom of religion religion but it's really not free anymore now they're clapping down on what we believe and it just takes one video clip one posting on the social media and our neighbors and friends that are right out here will turn on us and say you all believe what you guys are really that hateful they don't know what we really believe do they no and it just takes one posting they come right here and they can record a part of a sermon or part of a statement highlight it dress it up and clip it out snip it out and post it online and then the people can get a very good picture they think of another hateful group of people people that really don't have the love and so we know that that that that is you know uh where we are so we we are in a day of Grace and we thank God for this day of Grace that's our Point that's our first point and that our time is winding up we're really on the clock right now it's already started click and we're moving into something our time is going into something secondly we believe and know that the Rapture is coming and will come to pass we know this we know that the word of God tells us that there will be a catching a way and we know that there's events to take place before the Rapture and whatever order you want to put it uh um it could very well and this is The Humbling part it could very well happen without it coming in the order that your pastor preaches or teaches it or that you have understood it let's take for one example the third pool there's many statements made about the third pool we know it's a promise we know it's it's come to pass we know it's in existence we know it is Con in connection to the Rapture but I can take the quote on it and show you that this third pool is happening right now it's in the ministry now and another group can say no it's a future event that we're looking for and another another group can say well it's happening now but it's going to happen greater over there whatever the interpretation is whatever way it's going to come in its order remember it could very well happen without God asking you permission to make it happen and it can happen in a way that you would miss it yourself even though you're looking for it even though you know there's a promise for it you can very well be sitting there looking for something that already happen or that is happening right before you and you not even it's all through the scriptures this is The Humbling part this is the part that should keep us on our knees this is the part where we put commas instead of periods on any Divine promise of God it can happen today and we don't know we don't know we well brother George I thought that was going to happen well I got these quotes I was waiting for this to happen and this group was waiting for that to happen well maybe it did happen in South America maybe it happened up in Canada you didn't have to go God don't have to show you when it's happening it's going to happen though is that right Saints we somehow think that because we know the promise is a promise that must happen that somehow God has to include us when it happens so we need to be very careful with that don't we so whatever scenario it may come of the order can I touch on that just a little bit more come on let's take for example the vision of the tent the tent vision and I I'm not afraid to say it I I I don't want you to be afraid to say it I don't have the inter interpretation of it I just know it exists because the angel of the Lord said so he showed it to the prophet and this great T vision and so you could say well brother Israel is going to happen just exactly like this or it hasn't happened yet or um when it happens this and this and this can and all of those things can absolutely be true and you still not see it happen that's right oh yes because God it is the one who's going to interpret his word the way he's uh wants it to happen how it's going to take place um the same thing with the third pool now you know with the with with the with the vision of the tent the tent Vision that brother brandom had in his life in his ministry I mean that those are visions that he spoke of and those are uh portions of the word that he said with was thus sayeth the Lord Lord and I believe it's it's more our attitude towards it more than what our understanding is of it what is your attitude towards it you know I I make that statement and immediately there's there in a certain group maybe not here in a certain group it'll tighten up oh what you trying to say well what do you mean I what I'm trying to say I I'm I'm quoting a vision of the prophet and so my attitude should be you know what that's what he said if you don't know what he said find out what he said and then we can at least agree that that's what he said shake my hand that's what he said now it did happen you might disagree is it you might say it's this version or it's not spiritual or it's not literal you can take all the position you want but I believe that we have to start with saying that you know this is what he said and I believe it's more our attitude towards it than it is our understanding of it and God can very well take this one I take the I I use the tent Vision because that's one of the hottest topics out there right and I like my food hot but but we like to take those and and so it's it uh we God can very well take that and do it in a way that you missed it that's right now your faith maybe didn't miss it and you believed it all along but God can do it and you not know that that's what he was doing or that's how he did it we've seen it over and over again I'm going to take a an example or two here just on this part I feel a little tightening up here and so that's when I know I'm maybe doing something good maybe I don't know let's see don't nobody leave now all right here what the prophet of God says here's here's what the Bible says in Matthew chapter 17 in in regards to the ministry of John the Baptist remember they were all looking for John the Baptist to come that's right they were all waiting for Elijah to come and to restore all things they hadn't had one for 400 years so you think that you know us looking for him when he comes we will catch him and when this Great Mighty messenger comes and The Valleys will be brought up high and the mountains will be brought down low he will thoroughly Purge the floor he'll come through and he'll burn it up it's a like a it's a tremendous Ministry going to come and so these True Believers true disciples had these quotations yes had these scriptures had these quotes of the prophet Isaiah that there would be a voice of one crying in the wilderness are you looking for him yes here's my quote here's my stand and here Matthew chapter 17 and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things but I say unto you that Elias has come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of of who that's who he was talking that's who John the Baptist was you know I heard he was preaching over there and I didn't even go I was too busy mama and then went to that meeting and they said something about this man drowning people and he's all hairy he looks wild he ain't took a bath he don't have no Coury caller talking about snakes and Serv grandma and then was talking about yeah we heard about it but I was over here trying to work on my career and I was over here trying to do whatever I was we heard about that and then finally we come to find out that this was Elijah yeah this was him they finally understood that this was John this John Was Elijah the one that was coming in fulfillment of what Isaiah had told them and so we know that the Lord can allow these things to take place even we can miss them now I don't want you to misunderstand me I'm not I'm not telling you not to believe the word as it is spoken that is what you must do the word says it you believe it there's no explanation the No Greater explanation that you have to come up with you just have to believe it that's what he said he said it you know does it make sense but that's what the word says and we stand on that so I want you to I want you to hold that faith and believe it with all your heart and know that we are in in a day of Grace and we know that that Grace time clock is winding up but we know that also there is a Rapture coming and will come to pass and the scenarios and the events for the Rapture to come to pass can happen outside of your understanding believe that it could take place without your knowledge of it and also knowing that there is a rapture coming to pass knowing that we're in the last days we realize that the Rapture happens just before the great destruction before Israel gets its gospel message so we see that there is a a very small portion in time that this uh coming of the Lord or the last day church is going to be manifested or Christ calling away his bride we know that before the rapture there uh H uh uh before the coming of the Lord is the rapture of the church before Israel receives the message of Grace there is the rapture of there's a great catching away we know that that's the time frame we're aware of that and so let's take the message here for for a moment and let's see what the prophet of God says here about you know things that are happening now you know something how our Sunday school ended up on that quote in the second seal paragraph 183 things that are happening now but this is in the message handwriting on the wall he's uh relaying what happened in Daniel there chapter 5 um and this great uh party or banquet that's taking place and we see this hand come out of nowhere and begins to inscribe on the wall it shook the king up he he he was shaking his in his boots is what we were saying his bones and joints began to shake as he saw this hand this Supernatural hand write a supernatural language on the wall he couldn't understand what was going on but it shook him up it caught his attention paragraph 84 and handwriting on the wall he says what's going to happen there's a sputnick up there and what would happen the nation would surrender of course that's the only decent thing the government could do then what happens wave after wave of shiploads of soldiers wave after wave of airplanes would land in this nation the women would be ravished in the streets what would you do it belongs to them kicked out of your homes they will take it over what will happen to you young girls and you young men and all of you at that time sin has to be paid for no matter what nation it is or who it is it does it individually or a nation is going to be paid for and a bunch of brutal ungodly whisker jawed communistic soldiers would grab your wives ravish them your young girls and you stand and and and and there's nothing you can do about it what causes that question mark because you have listened to such stuff as these television programs on rock and roll in sin and some cold formal preacher not able to interpret the supernatural the handwriting is on the wall that's right and we are weighed in the balance and found wanting when could that take place before daylight in the morning who's going to stop it try it the Bible says it'll happen but let me tell you that'll never touch the Church of the Living God will be gone by that time so friends listen if that thing is so close and we see see the handwriting on the wall there's nothing can stop this thing from happening now America has been preached to the supernatural's been done and continually they weighed right on over the top of it go to a country somewhere or hold a Revival and have 40 converts in a week go back in 6 weeks you don't have four the Old Pond has been s dry God is just so many he God God just has so many he's elected and when that last one is in that closes the door and it's over then there's nothing left but judgment when mercy has been spurn and here we are at the end of the road The Supernaturals being done it's been laughed at made fun of in the last thing God has come in his own power in his own beloved Son to work through his church and they say it's spiritualism or the devil what else can be left but judgment and here's the handwriting on the wall but but what but if that is that close and any teacher knows that the church goes in the Rapture before the tribulation sets in so if it if it is that close could happen before morning so if that is that close could happen before morning what about the Rapture it's closer than that oh blessed be the name of the Lord the coming of the Lord is at hand the writing is written and it's written in the Bible and we're living to see it now I want you to think about that church the handwriting is on the wall the handwriting of judgment is on the wall and only the spiritual people can read the handwriting Daniel had to be called into the king's chamber or King's house to interpret what the handwriting on the wall said it shook them up they knew it was Supernatural but they couldn't interpret it they didn't know what it was so Daniel comes and he interprets it to them King your days are numbered King You've Been weighed King you've been found wanting King uh the Persians are coming to get you brother random says they had already started to dig and reroute the Euphrates river to to travel under those great big walls because they were so secure in their Nation they didn't know that judgment had already come their way and they're busy partying and they're upping the party if it was I mean it's one thing you're partying but now let's go to the house of the Lord and get the delicate things from Jerusalem and let's don't drink out of our cups let's drink out of those cups and it just raised up the disrespect for God and that's exactly what we see taking place today we see this disrespect towards God towards the word towards Holiness towards righteousness and we see that that great um the the the animosity towards anything that's holy and this is where the king finds himself with the handwriting on the wall and an interpretation had to come somebody spiritual had to say this is what time it is you all are partying you all are having a great time but this is is what time it is King you're waiting to balance and you're found wanting you're waiting we looked at your vessel you a got no oil in there it's lamp trimming time it's time to fill your oil your vessels up with oil that's what time it is it's time to get ready for the coming of the Lord that's what time it is it's not a time to you know jump around and argue with folks right maybe that was a day that wasn't a time to gather the message and see how much how many tapes we got we already got the tapes now now what time is it it's lamp trimming time it's ripening the grain time it's maturing time and King you've been found wanting I'm going to deal with this judgment just for a minute but the prophet of God continues in the message indictment and he says here paragraph 259 now to you here just in closing now pay close attention see I know it's hot I'm hot too but oh brother this word is life if you hold to it look it's not something we talk about that may happen here and after it's something that's already here with us and happening now not something will be something something that's already we're not testifying we know what he has done we know what he's going to do but now we're telling what he is doing see this is our hour whose hour is it it's our hour it's our time this is your time my brother to wake up we may not live to see the rapture may die today you may die today I don't know but the Rapture is coming amen that's when that comes we'll be there don't worry uhhuh so will all the rest of them back there Through the Ages that's believed it and look for it they walked in the light of their day and here is the light Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever forsake your Creeds and believe his word this is the truth so we're not talking about something that will come something that might come we're talking about something that is here now happening is the way the prophet phrased it all right we're in that time of what's of things that are taking place that are happening right now okay so the prophet continues on in the message when their eyes were open and he says this here paragraph number 15 I think that's a whole lot like today that many times we'll accept some things that Jesus has said but not all the things that he said people sometimes get say well we believe this but we don't believe this well you can't believe this without believing this see You've Got to Believe it all it's either all God or it isn't any God and so it all must be fitted in right in its place amen and as I said last evening God has alloted that his scriptures from the beginning before there was any before there was any time when he was eternal he is the Eternal one then these things that's happening now are only the attributes of God's thinking at first it has to be a thought then a word and a word when a thought Express is a word then it's spoken it has to happen and the whole thing is God unfolding himself in his attributes than God being made material tangible that we can talk to speak with in his whole church body and everything Therefore your name was in his thinking that's how you have eternal life you can't have it no other way you got to have eternal life you always was how many can say praise the Lord because you always was and God allotted the time take a scripture in Acts chapter 17 quickly I want to read that for you Acts chapter 17 believe it's what I want Paul speaking here in verse 22 then Paul stood in the midst of Mars Hill and said ye men of Athens I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious that word means religious the same word word is used through in another place in the Bible they're too religious superstitious for as I pass by and behold your devotions I found an altar with this inscri inscription to the unknown God whom therefore you ignorantly worship Him declare I unto you God that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is the Lord of Heaven and Earth dwelleth not in temples made with hand neither is worship with men's hands as though he needed anything seeing he giveth it to give it to all life and breath and all things hath made one blood all nations of men for to dwell on the face of the Earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation that they should seek the Lord as happily they might feel at after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us so it's the Lord that made all men with one blood it's not a three or four different kinds of blood he makes all men with one blood and he made all nations and he set their bounds and he gave them their habitations and it's the Lord that appointed the Nations and the separations and the things that we see today all of the Nations it's not one nation greater than another Nation God is the father of all of the Nations and he with one blood made all these nations and he set their habitation so happily that you can find him but you know in these he's in thessalonia um verse one he's coming to thessalonica and then he he's preaching the word for three days three sabbaths rather and they they they they beat they come after him and then he goes to the Berean and we read that scripture before how the bereans took the word and examine the word and then they started to follow him and he he comes into this place where they had an incription to the unknown God these people were worshiping ignorantly they didn't know who they were worshiping and that's that's not our God that we serve God wants us to know him and He makes himself known by revealing himself to us and when we come to him we don't know everything but we know enough on how to serve him as he reveals himself to us amen he's not the unknown God he doesn't have an unknown name we know his name it's been revealed to us his name is Jesus the Lord Jesus Christ and so God has allotted the scripture from the beginning before there was any time when he was Eternal so God allots the scripture he all Lots the season and then he begins to reveal himself continue in the message a man ranning from the presence of the Lord Brother Ram talking about the Pentecostals that receive the restoration of the gifts and the baptism of the Holy Ghost come out speaking in tongues paragraph 60 and when you see then in this day now when the word of God has made the these promises of these things that we see happening now then we've got the responsibility to either face up to it or get away from it you have you just can't stay neutral you got to do something about it some move has got to be made you can't come in that church door and go out the same person you come in you either further away or closer to God every time you come in or go out there oh how easy it is for people to Sher these things and I want us to think of these things when we start into the official Services tomorrow so brother bam continues on that we can't stay neutral we have to take a stand we have to redeem the time we have to go forward in what God has revealed and showed to us and we know that the Rapture is going to happen it will take place and all we know is Mercy side the mercy side longsuffering longsuffering longu the the the the websites continue to grow anti- word anti- god anti- message and they seem to continue on the the unbelief seems to Foster and grow greater and you taking a step stand for what is right you can't man hardly pray in public if you own a big company or Corporation somebody's going to be offended a couple years ago at Congress or whatever they the National Day of Prayer the the the the the the head or whoever his head was that ended in prayer he says aen or a woman how many remember that it was closing y'all don't remember that yes can I say stupid I'm not going to say y y'all kids don't follow me on that I know you parents my mom didn't let us use that word either but I was reading a quote in the prayer brother abam says God forgive our stupidity that's what the prophet said and so I took that that there's some stupidity on our part I'm looking at myself now I'm not looking at nobody there's some stupidity on our part but how's a man going to end up prayer in a man or a woman y'all get it somebody else say it's y'all thinking it that's what it is it's like what what is he talking about a man then he says a woman so you you see that the handwriting is on the wall we see that this is just it's just going to get crazier and crazier when it comes to our our rights and our love for the lord it's going to stand out more and more right but we've been warned haven't amen and in one of the great warnings and signs of judgment was a prophecy given about California and I want to go into that just for a moment just to bring up before I finish up on what's Happening Now this great earthquake in Alaska that happened in 1964 uh March the 27th on a good Friday this coming March will be exactly 60 years that this took place now the nation knows it your history books Know It And The World At Large if you study earthquakes know exactly what that was on the RoR scale you can look it up it's very fine what the world don't know is what started the earthquake what they don't know was the Whirlwind that was spoken and they don't know that judgment was associated with it and we know that the Judgment the beginning of judgment has already started we're on the clock Saints let me read some quotations for you all right here the prophet of God in the message identify Christ of all ages 1964 paragraph number one he says we've enjoyed about 15 years Revival which according to history is longer than any Revival has ever lasted to my knowing usually a Revival lasts about 3 years didn't it get scattered but believing that this one is one of the last great revivals that the world will receive and it's come in the last Age The leod Dean age at the end of the Pentecostal dispensation and I believe that the church now is going out into its lukewarmness as the Bible predicted and we're seeing just the catching of the last part when we see things happening like has been happening in the world in the last few days for instance the great earthquake in Alaska never has been an earthquake like that and all the world did you notice it come on a good Friday you know the last time the world was shaking was on a good Friday too when our Master died and it shook the whole world and remember it might be the sign of him returning he said that there would be earthquakes in diverse places today we got another one in California they're just appearing everywhere light earthquakes we notice even the Capitol building has moved out of its place and move back and down here in Baton Rouge and Louisiana there's a swimming pool there Dash the waters out from Plum from Alaska over into Switzerland Sweden and through there shook buildings and things around the world I believe that it's trying to open our eyes to see the hour that we're living I'm here in Godly fear that it may be sooner than we think of his appearing now who you going to listen to Saints are you going to listen to the media or the news to tell you what time it is are you going to listen to a Vindicated Prophet to tell you what time it is he was s to tell us what time it was and he believed that we're living in the last closing we seen the last part of these things this is not just news so we can talk about it I wonder if some of our sometimes our our prayer requests isn't just news to some so we can know what's going on in the next group or the next Church hey so and so this was going on you know so die hey wait did you pray did you pray about that's what that was for it's a prayer request it's not a rumor tag it's not something just to talk about did you pray you know how we are we're very interested in knowing what other people are going through we gossip and then we try to sprinkle keep them in prayer after we finish gossiping all under the banner of gossip and he say yeah yeah I'm praying for him yeah just you just need to pray for him did you pray for him praise the Lord all right you're supposed to be a happy part of the service but we didn't get there yet we talking about Grace all right but look at this this earthquake in 1964 brother R is going to identify to us what's going on and the media and and the World At Large California they can identify what it was let the prophet identify to us what it was he continues in the message who do you say this is paragraph 156 watch what taking place walking along not just by yourself man along with you see a cluster of angels come from the heavens shake the whole earth just stand there and the newspapers write it up when it's predicted months and months before H hands would take place there he stood there and said the time is at hand return back open the Seven Seals of mystery that's been hid all through the reformations and things bring it out then comes preaching serpent seed and all these things and what does the clergy do instead of saying why Luther said this such they just they'll never see it see but what a privileg privilege it is for us who believe to walk in the presence of God every day stand there and see a whirl wouldn't come out of the sky it blowed a mountain half in Two standing there where we was at cut the top of the trees off and things like that and a blast of word come out and shook there three times said watch it go to the West Coast went right over there shook down Alaska coming right down the West Coast now just exactly day before I took a rock and I threw it up in the air and said thus sayith the Lord the hour is here judgments will start in the earth so who's telling us this these are the judgments that are starting in the Earth where does it start there's a rock thrown up in the air and that rock going up and coming down started a little Whirlwind that was the day before you got to know where you're at so glad we know where we're at that it was a messenger that started that it was an angel you go through your Through the Bible and Revelation it's the angel that declares many of the judgments and woes they pronounce those woes in judgment just like Elijah he pronounced there be a famine and then he pronounced that there would be a Revival in rain it's always a man on the earth that God uses that's good right yes you take the crime reports and you can see they'll tell you crimes is doing better here and we cracked down on crimes we started a new you know uh a team or a new drug task force and we stopped we crack down on crimes in this area crack down on crimes on that area judgments have already begin in the earth brother bam continues in the message of man running from the presence of the Lord Lord he says this here paragraph 88 while I was standing there the Lord said show me what was going to happen judgment is fixing to strike the West Coast he said get over here there beside that fireplace had a shovel in my hand I walked over there and brother Roy Roberson and all of us know him here he's not here tonight as I know of he's in Arizona out there he's the chairman of the trustees here and I know him being a veteran and something was going to happen real pretty still morning about 10:00 in the morning the boys all around there 10 or 12 of us letting down tents and skinning out pigs and things I rocked around I said Roy hi quick something is fixing to happen I couldn't tell him no more but just the time and coming down from the heavens come the Whirlwind of God and clapped like shook the hills running inside that mountain cut a streak Plum around it about 5 ft above my head and cut all the tops of the trees off and the Rocks went out and went up into the air and come down again with another big baptism and struck across the mountain and throw the rocks out like that did it three times then went up into the air brother Banks come over to me and said that's what you said yesterday I said yes sir that's exactly it see and then two days after that Alaska sunk almost up there and up and down the West Coast has been the thunderings and pushings and everything happen and one of these days she's going to slide beneath the ocean how many of y'all still believe that you know they believe it in 60s they believe it in ' 65 66 67 they believe it through the 70s I wonder do you still believe it you know some of these quotes you know their time you know there's a Time limit for some people you know certain things Chang that I don't believe that no more they used to all believe the same huh they all you know the message churches the mess Believers the witnesses that were here I'm told that everybody believed all the quotes in ' 66 but 77 happened it's like 1980s come oh brother Billy Paul's gone he [Music] like do you still believe the message yes sir actually we're believing it more I want something else to happen to shake off all the fake Believers expose them right yes the cup of iniquity has to fill the prophet of God continues in this day this scripture is fulfilled let me take this scripture let me take this quote for you here and and I know and trusted to be a blessing to you here what the prophet of God says here paragraph 165 are you there this morning the Seven Seals of the Hidden Mysteries of the entire Bible will be open and fulfill Revelations 10 that is in the seventh Angel's message these things should come to pass this day the scripture is fulfilled before our eyes this day the scripture is fulfilled last year St standing in the same place Mr wood here and I going up the hill in kind of a a morning about kind of in a morning about his wife being sick the holy spirit said pick up a rock laying there throw it up in the air when it comes down say thus sayeth the Lord there will be judgment strike the Earth tell him that he'll see the hand of God the next few hours I told Mr wood he's present tonight I guess eight or 10 of the men or 15 that was there at that time when he took place the next morning when the Lord came down in a whirlwind ripped the mountain around us and cut the tops of the trees loose and made three blast and said judgment is headed towards the west coast and look what he says two days after that Alaska almost sunk beneath the Earth and since then up and down the coast the belches of God 's judgment against that spiritual scream there is an iron curtain there is a bamboo curtain and there is a normally he would say a purple curtain but here he says it's a sin curtain which is tied into the purple curtain because Rome will rule the world remember Adolf Hitler he wasn't persecuting the Jews because the law of Moses he was persecuting the Jews because of his racist views towards them his blood was different than the Jewish blood his blood he wanted a pure race and in Acts chapter 17 we read for you there that God made all blood for all nations but his was just pure cruel hearted towards against those people they were different than him same thing with musolini and all their hatred but brother vanam shows us that that spirit that was on him is the same spirit that was on the Romans that crucified Jesus because it's an evil spirit so you see evil out there and the evil powers out there they're not bothering us today religious wise but they're coming they're coming amen and the prophet is now identifying you talk about this group of men brother Glenn Were You There Brother Glenn's a witness of one of those that was there in that group I think I saw his picture he hasn't aged one bit he looks exactly the same I was just thinking that he's here with us this morning eyewitness these things are true you know our eyewitnesses are leaving us today but it's still the truth here brother man was talking about a couple days before he throws up a rock you think Time Magazine knows this part you think people that study the earthquake do they know this part you think people that was in the Alaskan earthquake did you think they knew this part right here there is a little humble man from where where is he from again what town where's he from you got a TV men no he not even on TV you talking about great preachers and great ministers we don't even know him but God knew him and all of heaven knows him yes and heaven knows you too remember he not popular here but over there come on somebody they lifted him up on a high place on Earth you were a leader not a leader to everybody but a leader to people like me like you and the greater way the narrow path in in heaven a huge portion awaits you for your stand on the word it is my way and the million said we're resting on that am good enough for me yes sir good enough for me little humble man just a poor guy one of us poor man from some Kentucky broken English no language skills and he's out there in the mountains there and the Lord tells him to throw up a rock he throws up the rock you can believe it or not I choose to believe it he throws up a rock and it comes down when he hits the ground say thus sayeth the Lord and judgment is striking the West Coast yes he sends that out into the atmosphere of Truth everybody can't hear it many didn't hear it until it was recorded later but it's still the word of Truth judgment is striking the West Coast can you hear it this morning praise the Lord amen oh my I'm believable yes can I go a little bit further can I have 10 more minutes cuz I don't trust that clock I think it's earlier than it's later I don't know I don't trust it thank you somebody tell me what time it is yes all right just a few more moments all right everybody don't smile like that I know that start talking about taking your time people start frowning and want their burrito or lunch or hamburger or whatever it is what say you know that g starts at one the game starts at one we ought to preach at least until 1:30 right how many was say Amen to that it it well everybody ain't saying amen that's be honest that's all right yeah I see it I see you that's all right so here the prophet of God is now talking about this great earthquake in 1965 and look how he describes this this earthquake here and I'm going to close on this I had another Port I want to finish but I'm going to close on this he says first he identifies the Iron Curtain the bamboo curtain and then the sin curtain and which we were bringing out before that that's actually the purple curtain but here he calls it a sin curtain and he he directly identifies California and I want to say that we can say it because the prophet said it that California is going down Saints it's going down it's the word of the Lord and it might not happen in my generation that's the thing and it might not happen when I think is going to happen but the Declaration is still the same it's going down it's part of the Judgment that comes to this nation for rejecting god what happened in California some of the greatest Ministries ever the isusa Revival happened in California where God took a a onee black man and and groups of poor people poor blacks poor whites and people that were the outcasts of the big churches and he put his hand on them oh we can't go pray over there but when God puts his hand on you you will go there and get prayed for you go where God calls you to go and he he broke those lines of monetary and wealth and you know the aristocrats he broke all of that and he show know where he was prise the Lord so let God pick your church cuz you don't know how to pick one come on somebody help me preach just for a minute I try to pick a church it'd be a nice denominational church with more people in there that I can sit back and do nothing if I was going to pick a church I'll pick one in the right neighborhood like right around the corner from my house if I was going to pick a church I pick a church that has something to give me give me something make it you know you know something for me something to help me uh if I was going to pick a church I would pick one that kept me popular looking fine all the time no embarrassment don't bother me I won't if I was picking a church but God picked a church for me it's the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ and in that church I find Refuge I find strength I find the anointing I find the blessing of God I find a clean table to eat from why God chose the church that you Worship in and that's this message of the hour right Saints look at the how the prophet describes this in the choosing of the Bride I'm just going to land a plane right here is that all right okay when in the great hour that great monster laying up yonder that flipped over flipped himself over in Alaska a few days ago threw his tail up again this morning along about down around in Washington he could head this way Mighty easy and if the Holy Spirit ever tells me definitely so he's in the message choosing of a bride Excuse me yes he's in that message choosing of of the Bride in California he's talking about the earthquakes that had began and there was another one that happened and he's talking about like a monster he calls it a great monster and this monster flipped his tail over the monster still there there's a preacher looking out for another preacher thank you praise the Lord he knew what I was needing but the the the um he he he's talking about this Earth earthquake and the terminology he's using he calls it a monster we we haven't seen the monster flipy but you think that monster still dead is he dead or no is he still there oh he's going to flip one time sir he going to flip and the whole thing's going to slide in and there's a people that have been warned that's the part that is so beautiful there is a people that was on the inside of the inside of what's going on this is what the Alaska earthquake was all about it was judgment striking the West Coast because they rejected God and here this King in Daniel chapter 7 he takes the gold cups in his great party and he takes the holy things of God he didn't respect them and he started to party with them and then his days were number he didn't know his days were numbered the doors of his kingship was closing he had a little portion of Grace if he' have followed his grandfather he would have stayed with Daniel's religion but he got away from Nebuchadnezzar and he got into his own thing and he saw this thing and start shaking in his boots his wife one of the Queens come up to him and says oh there's a man in your kingdom that knows how to interpret this what's going on he calls all the astronomers and all the people what does that mean what does that mean we never we never seen that before what does it mean and the queen says there's a man here that knows these things so they call Daniel in it's like man you should have called him before but finally you get him in and Daniel comes in there faithful he he's seen these kingdoms come and go remember Daniel he was there at Nebuchadnezzar he's there with this King here he's even with King Darius God will preserve his own they change Powers all the time but God stayed with Daniel Amen cuz Daniel stayed with the word and Daniel begins to interpret to them like the message interprets to us what's really going do you know what time it is Saints do you know what time it is I'm not angry I'm just enthusi this morning to think about it the time that we're that we're in and here judgment has already started amen so he he says it that way and I'll get one or two more here right here in the message of shamed he says it like this paragraph 46 he said one day we brother wood when we come out there we went to the same place throw up a rock and come down he said within a day and night your some I forgot just what the words was you're going to see the glory of God and the next day a whirlwind came down out of the skies and we we know the story of what taking place when it went up they asked what it was I said it spoke three words in three great blasts the men only heard the blasting I understood what it said and said judgment striking West Coast that's what the he throws a rock up that's where the great blast takes place he's he as he's he says two days after that Alaska liked to have sunk It's been thundering around earthquakes everything just look at them every day earthquakes just shaking everywhere I got to get one or two more in here and I'll finish this all right talking about this Alaska earthquake I like how he frames it here in the message in the invisible Union of the Bride he said says this here paragraph 302 and everything has been said oh even to the destruction of California coming up now and all these other things and how I told them how many days it would be how it how it would be where this big earthquake happened in Alaska and that would be the beginning of the sign of time and what would take place and just word by word what it said it's never fell one time you never seen it fail and it can't fail because it's God's words and Heaven Earth will pass away but it can't fail that's right last quote on that he says in the message leadership 1965 this is December of 65 the Lord calls him home just a couple of weeks later he says look here do you know what the Lord says about Los Angeles in these places here she's gone you remember what I told you about two years ago how that earthquake would come in Canada up here Alaska I also tell you that Hollywood in Los Angeles is sliding into the ocean California you're doomed not only California but you world you're doomed Church unless you get right with God God your doom thus saith the Holy Spirit have you ever heard me use that name unless it come to pass ask you you know me 20 years did I ever tell you anything in the name of the Lord but what come to pass it's everything I've ever told you would happen happen say Amen see I tell you now is the hour you better be getting right all of us now is the hour we better be getting right how many will take that warning this morning that we better be getting right can I close the service with a few scriptures but just take a couple scriptures in uh uh um Ephesians chapter 5 in Colossians chapter 4 those would be my last two scriptures Ephesians chapter 5 and I just say to you Saints here you can't stay neutral any longer you got to pick a side we have to make our stand uhhuh what scripture did I call Ephesians 5 verse number 14 wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise Redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is I like in the NIV verse1 15 it says be careful then how you live not as unwise but wise making the most of every opportunity because the days are evil that's that's Redeeming the time amen last one in Colossians chapter 4 1-6 Masters give unto your servants that which is just and equal knowing that you also have a master in heaven how many have it there Colossians chapter 4 what it say in verse two continue in prayer and watch in the same with Thanksgiving so you're praying you're watching and you're thankful with all praying also for us that God would open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of Christ for which I am also in bonds that I may make it manifest as I ought to speak what walk in wisdom towards them that are without Redeeming the time let your speech be always with Grace seasoned with salt that you may know how you ought to answer every man amen that's our that's our our message that's our time that's our admonition to you so awake thou that sleepeth because the days are evil Saints our time is up my time is up here this morning but the day in time our time is up it's high time that we wake up out of our sleep Brothers well do you know who the next president is no I don't know I don't know who the next president will be remember you remember we had a when brother when Mr U Donald Trump was President remember he had a spiritual advice er a minister how many remember her name Paul y'all don't want to say thank you sis S Mrs Paula she's working on husband number three she's just I don't criticize her she went through a lot in her life and she's a minister and adviser and she prophesied at the last election that thus sayith the Lord that God had given Trump the the the presidency but she was wrong she was flat out wrong but you know you can do that in in them churches and then you'll say well it didn't happen because um y'all didn't believe it or it didn't happen because you guys had a bad attitude you wasn't ready no if it's th say the Lord it it's going to happen now what God will do sometimes he'll extend time because of grace and mercy and he might extend you some time like we're living on borrow time now but it's still going to happen this prophecy of California Saints it's going to happen it's the prophet said so that that that's more Vindicated in anything they can say in any history book anywhere in any school any campus anywhere any online uh any online group saying and whatever they want to say this is going to happen and what was the first sign of it was this Alaskan earthquake that happened almost 60 years ago just about 60 years ago on a good Friday it was was the beginning of judgments to strike into the Earth it was the sign of the time it was putting us on the clock that the Rapture is at hand and not everybody knows that but there's a group of people that do know it and what do we do with that information we get ready with it we wake out of our sleep it's time Saints the handwriting is on the wall and we know what the handwriting is saying God thank you for a warning such as this we ought to be a grateful people happy people watchful prayerful giving thanks God bless you amen let us pray father we thank you for your word this morning we thank you Lord that before one bomb would drop the bride would already be gone yes before rain every fail Noah's people were sealed away before the Judgment struck in the days of Noah Enoch was caught away oh God what a what a time what a warning what an admonition the ending of Grace coming to an end but Lord we certainly are appreciative of the grace that will show us the day and time that we're living in it has interpreted it to us the handwriting on the wall in this Kingdom we know we see the sign we see the great
