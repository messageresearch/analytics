[0:39] Morning
[0:43] everyone. All stand. We'll open up in a
[0:45] word of prayer.
[0:49] Heavenly Father, we're grateful for the
[0:52] privilege of being here today. Thank you
[0:54] for all your blessings
[0:56] and Father, as we hear the preaching of
[0:58] your word, we we know it's faithful and
[1:01] true. Father, may we all receive you in
[1:03] a greater measure today, Lord. Perhaps
[1:06] anyone that does not know you fully,
[1:08] Lord. We pray that they would accept the
[1:11] gift of God which is eternal life
[1:12] through Jesus Christ our Lord. Father
[1:15] have your way in the Sunday school class
[1:17] for the children. Father everything that
[1:20] would be said and done this Sunday in
[1:23] your house of worship. Father, we pray
[1:26] your hand would rest mightily upon
[1:28] everyone. In the name of Jesus we ask.
[1:31] Amen.
[1:33] We'll be continuing with the future home
[1:37] of the heavenly bridegroom and the
[1:39] earthly bride. We'll start at paragraph
[1:41] 182 and after 238.
[1:46] And just for reference, this is from
[1:48] second Peter chapter 3 and Revelation 21
[1:52] 1-7.
[1:54] [Music]
[1:56] Only believe.
[2:01] Only believe.
[2:05] All things are possible.
[2:10] Only
[2:11] believe.
[2:14] Only believe.
[2:19] Only believe.
[2:23] All things are possible
[2:28] only believe.
[2:32] &gt;&gt; You may be seated, brother Brandon.
[2:37] &gt;&gt; Have you often heard me say in prayer,
[2:38] take your hands off of God's property.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43] &gt;&gt; Have faith to claim your own.
[2:45] &gt;&gt; That's your rights.
[2:47] &gt;&gt; Take your hands off of her. Take your
[2:49] hands off of him. See, faith will do it.
[2:54] Oh my. Not annihilate it, but just take
[2:57] your hands off of it to loose it. Let it
[3:00] go. Pass it away. It changes.
[3:05] The earth will change. Politics will
[3:07] change. The religions will change. The
[3:10] denominations will pass away. Politics
[3:13] will pass away. The kingdom of God shall
[3:15] be established. We read in John uh read
[3:19] John in Revelation 6:14.
[3:22] See, it departed as a scroll.
[3:28] The Bible said the that it John said, "I
[3:31] saw the heaven and earth depart as a
[3:34] scroll." John Revelation 6:14. Jesus
[3:37] said, "Heavens and earth shall pass
[3:40] away." Or other words, heavens and earth
[3:42] shall be changed.
[3:46] &gt;&gt; Use that same word right there again.
[3:48] No, not annihilated.
[3:50] For later in Revelations 21
[3:54] 2- 24,
[3:56] he seen the new Jerusalem coming down
[4:00] from God out of heaven and sitting upon
[4:03] this earth.
[4:05] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that it'll be
[4:06] annihilated. The systems will be
[4:09] changed.
[4:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:11] &gt;&gt; Daniel saw the same thing. The rock
[4:13] struck the world will shoot out without
[4:15] hands and the whole image of the systems
[4:19] was broke down and become like a champ
[4:22] on a summer thrashing for and the wind
[4:24] packed it away
[4:26] &gt;&gt; and the rock itself grew into a great
[4:28] mountain that covered the earth.
[4:30] &gt;&gt; Watch that mountain now in a little bit.
[4:32] That mountain covered the earth.
[4:34] Also, we find out here over also in
[4:37] Revelations there, it said the kings of
[4:39] the new earth will bring their honor and
[4:41] glory into it. And the earth is sitting,
[4:45] the new Jerusalem is sitting on this
[4:47] earth. See, it just changed. You're the
[4:50] same man and statue that you was when
[4:54] God called you,
[4:55] &gt;&gt; same woman.
[4:57] &gt;&gt; But you see what it did? It was a
[4:59] regeneration. The old life passed away.
[5:01] The old desires passed away. When you
[5:04] used to like to drink and cuss and fuss
[5:06] and stew and run around and immoral,
[5:08] that thing just died.
[5:11] &gt;&gt; See, but now you are used and you was
[5:14] Satan's instrument. Now you are
[5:15] redeemed.
[5:17] &gt;&gt; And that's what the world would be the
[5:18] same way. Redeemed,
[5:20] &gt;&gt; a new heavens and new earth just like
[5:22] you. You are a new creature.
[5:24] &gt;&gt; And the Greek word there, anybody knows
[5:27] said you are a new creation.
[5:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. A new creation in the same old
[5:33] temple.
[5:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:35] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[5:36] &gt;&gt; Watch what happens here. Now, glorious.
[5:39] All right.
[5:41] Now, we find that this earth will hold
[5:44] the kings of the earth. And again, in
[5:48] Matthew 5:5, Jesus said, "The meek shall
[5:52] inherit the earth."
[5:55] &gt;&gt; It isn't going to just go to heaven
[5:57] earth. It's just going to be the same
[5:58] earth. I'm trying to get the the plan of
[6:01] redemption to you before if I don't get
[6:03] nothing else. See, the baptism a fire on
[6:07] it only is to cleanse it and make it a
[6:09] fit place for his meek to live in.
[6:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:14] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[6:17] like he did us this creation to live in.
[6:19] Before he could come in it, he had to
[6:20] give us the baptism of fire.
[6:22] &gt;&gt; Then the Holy Ghost come in and live.
[6:24] &gt;&gt; Baptism of fire. Then when you get that
[6:27] baptism of fire, then the Holy Ghost can
[6:30] come in. What does it does? It burns up
[6:32] everything contrary to the word out of
[6:34] you.
[6:36] &gt;&gt; See, it won't believe nothing else but
[6:38] the word
[6:39] &gt;&gt; because it is the word.
[6:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:44] &gt;&gt; That's what we was talking the other
[6:45] day. The evidence of the Holy Ghost.
[6:47] &gt;&gt; See the evidence of the Holy Ghost when
[6:49] you can receive the word
[6:51] &gt;&gt; not some system
[6:53] &gt;&gt; but have a clear understand. How you
[6:55] know the word's clear? Understand? Watch
[6:56] it vindicate itself.
[6:58] &gt;&gt; Well, you say, "I see this do it that."
[6:59] Oh, yes. Weeds live the same way.
[7:03] &gt;&gt; But it's got to be the entire word.
[7:07] &gt;&gt; To be the bride, you have to be part of
[7:08] him. He is the word.
[7:11] &gt;&gt; See, and what a part of him is it? The
[7:13] word that's promised for this day when
[7:15] he calls his bride.
[7:17] &gt;&gt; You're part of that. You get it?
[7:20] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't lose that. Now notice
[7:25] and he makes it a fit place to live
[7:27] through eternity. Notice this is still
[7:30] not referred to
[7:33] uh this millennium reign. The thousand
[7:36] years is not the new earth. See the
[7:39] millennium reign is a different reign.
[7:41] That's what we go into the millennium.
[7:43] That isn't a new earth. The new heaven.
[7:44] No. No. That's just a rest place. A rest
[7:48] period. Not at all. The new heaven is a
[7:49] new earth. For see, in the millennium,
[7:52] we have things that would not go into
[7:54] that. It's a type of the old seventh day
[7:56] out of Eden. The seventh day after he
[7:59] made the world, the seventh day he
[8:01] rested in Eden. And the millennium, see,
[8:04] the world has now almost 6,000 years
[8:07] old. See, every 2,000 years, it's had a
[8:11] a destruction. See, first 2,000, the
[8:15] flood came and he baptized it with what?
[8:19] water. Next 2,00 Jesus come to sanctify
[8:22] and clean it. Dropped his blood upon it,
[8:24] called it his. All right, I'll come
[8:26] again now as king with his queen. And
[8:31] the second 2,000 years, what does he do?
[8:33] He comes and gives his rest spirit and
[8:35] then burns her off and claims it for his
[8:37] own.
[8:37] &gt;&gt; Puts his own back on it. And notice,
[8:41] not the perfect world. This millennium,
[8:43] it's a type of the seventh day. Then
[8:46] comes the white throne judgment. See, we
[8:47] still have judgment. We're still in time
[8:49] in the millennium. It's a day 1,000
[8:51] years. It's a time element, not don't
[8:54] get that mixed up with the new earth
[8:56] now, because it's not.
[8:58] You must say this to me. I just somebody
[9:01] might say this to me that uh now,
[9:03] brother Brandham, what do you go to do
[9:05] now? You've run out of your complete
[9:08] sevens.
[9:10] What are you going to do now? Now you're
[9:12] a dispensationalist, which I am. I
[9:14] believe that God is too. No, notice you
[9:17] run out of dispensation types
[9:20] for if you're going to put something
[9:21] beyond that seventh day, how you going
[9:23] to get it? Where are you going to now?
[9:28] All right, I'll call your attention to
[9:30] something. See,
[9:34] I I ain't had a dispensation yet. I got
[9:37] another scripture here. And remember,
[9:39] all of it has to be fulfilled.
[9:41] &gt;&gt; Every bit of it. Now you say, "Brother
[9:43] Bram, you're trying to put something way
[9:45] over yonder beyond that seventh day,
[9:48] that seventh day Sabbath. As God made
[9:51] the earth and labored six days and
[9:53] rested the seventh is only a type of
[9:55] time
[9:57] &gt;&gt; time,
[9:59] &gt;&gt; but I've just said here we become
[10:01] eternal."
[10:04] &gt;&gt; So where's your type now? You said your
[10:06] typologist. So you you've run out of
[10:08] types now. What happened?
[10:10] &gt;&gt; Let's just find out if we have Let's go
[10:13] to Leviticus back in the 23rd chapter of
[10:15] Leviticus.
[10:17] I want you to notice in Leviticus where
[10:19] we was at last Sunday or this what gave
[10:21] me the idea right here the 23rd chapter
[10:24] of Leviticus and the 26th verse. Now
[10:27] remember there is seven feast days. The
[10:32] feast of trumpets, the feast of of
[10:34] tabernacles, the feast of the sheath
[10:36] waving, all this is seven great feast
[10:39] days. That was only a type of the seven
[10:43] church ages.
[10:45] And you remember how many Sabbaths there
[10:48] was between one and the other. See,
[10:51] seven Sabbaths between Pentecost and the
[10:53] trumpets, which was seven church ages.
[10:56] And there was seven feast days that
[10:58] represent the seven church ages. Keep
[11:00] your numbers running. Say, "Well, now,
[11:01] Brother Bram, you're done. Run out. You
[11:03] got your seven." All right, let's take
[11:05] the last feast which is a feast of
[11:08] tabernacles. Now notice here in the 36th
[11:11] verse, seven days shall you offer
[11:15] offerings made of fire unto the Lord. On
[11:18] the eighth day,
[11:23] &gt;&gt; on the eighth day shall be a holy
[11:26] convocation.
[11:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[11:28] &gt;&gt; There's another holy time coming, holy
[11:31] convocation to you. And you shall offer
[11:34] an offering made by fire unto the Lord,
[11:36] and it is a solemn assembly.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; And you shall do no terrible work
[11:41] therein. G.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; Now, we got an eighth day.
[11:46] Now, there's only seven days, but yeah,
[11:48] we speak of the eighth day holy
[11:51] conversation. Uh, combination. Notice do
[11:54] no work in it. The eighth day are what?
[11:57] Back to the first day.
[11:59] &gt;&gt; What speaks of eternity? as she rolls
[12:02] around without a stop in place.
[12:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you see it?
[12:07] &gt;&gt; Notice it was also upon this eighth day,
[12:11] last day, feast day of the tabernacle.
[12:15] Notice after that, after the last feast
[12:17] day, at the last church age, at the last
[12:21] complete seven days upon the earth,
[12:23] after the millennium that this holy
[12:25] convocation comes.
[12:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember this is feast of
[12:29] &gt;&gt; tabernacles.
[12:32] &gt;&gt; Tabernacles.
[12:33] &gt;&gt; Gathering places.
[12:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:36] &gt;&gt; Where in the millennium the Bible said
[12:40] they shall build houses.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; They shall inhabit. But in the new earth
[12:45] he's already went prepared the place
[12:47] it's built.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[12:50] &gt;&gt; We have nothing to do with the building
[12:51] of it.
[12:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Eternal.
[12:56] Oh, I just love that word. My
[12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:01] &gt;&gt; A holy convocation. The eighth day,
[13:05] which is only seven days. Then on the
[13:07] eighth day, which comes back to the
[13:09] first day again, comes right back to the
[13:11] first day. The eighth day is a holy com
[13:14] accommodation. Notice seven days only
[13:19] has to do with the old creation world
[13:21] time.
[13:23] &gt;&gt; Seven days. That's a millennium. The
[13:25] rest day is God labored six days, rested
[13:28] the seventh. The church labors se six
[13:30] days and rest the seventh. But you're
[13:32] still in time element. I ain't speaking
[13:35] of the eternal.
[13:37] But you see, there's no such a thing as
[13:38] eight days. You go back to the first day
[13:41] again. Amen.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; See the first day the Sabbath speaks of
[13:46] the old law which was to pass away. The
[13:48] keeping of a Sabbath which passed away
[13:51] or uh said uh changed to another. It
[13:55] didn't pass away. It is changed from the
[13:58] old law of keeping a certain day of the
[14:00] week. Isaiah the 19th chapter said I
[14:03] believe 28:19 said preip must go on
[14:06] preip here a little and there a little
[14:07] hold fast that what's good for stammer
[14:09] lips and other tongues when I speak to
[14:11] this people and here is the rest
[14:15] you enter into life
[14:18] not keeping a day or shadow Paul said
[14:20] over there in Hebrews the 4th chapter
[14:22] you keep days and shadows and things
[14:24] like that I'm scared of your experience
[14:27] &gt;&gt; see we don't pass into certain days and
[14:29] orders you pass from death unto eternal
[14:32] life
[14:34] &gt;&gt; not days and times you pass into
[14:36] eternity
[14:37] &gt;&gt; that's a holy com conversation
[14:40] convocation rather seven days what which
[14:43] pass away or I have said will change to
[14:46] another eight days
[14:49] deals with new creation
[14:53] see not old creation eight days is new
[14:56] creation for it was on the eighth day
[14:59] that our Lord Lord raised from the dead.
[15:03] &gt;&gt; There's your other convocation.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; The holiness
[15:07] &gt;&gt; not considered in the Sabbath at all or
[15:09] the feast of the tabernacles, feast of
[15:11] this, the feast of Pentecost.
[15:14] Jesus raised from the dead for our
[15:17] justification on the eighth day after
[15:21] the seven Sabbaths or seven days, seven
[15:24] church ages, Jesus raised from the dead.
[15:28] eighth day,
[15:29] &gt;&gt; which is a holy convocation.
[15:31] &gt;&gt; See, which is the first day.
[15:34] &gt;&gt; See, who's done passed through time and
[15:36] dropped into eternity again.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; Not keeping of days and keeping of
[15:41] Sabbaths and new moons and things like
[15:43] that, but have passed.
[15:46] &gt;&gt; Changed your form,
[15:49] &gt;&gt; not annihilated,
[15:51] &gt;&gt; glory,
[15:52] &gt;&gt; but passed from death unto life eternal.
[15:58] Hallelujah.
[16:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, what the Bible does teach us
[16:03] &gt;&gt; pass from one to another.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; All right. Pass the old Sabbath past.
[16:10] Jesus raised on the eighth day. That was
[16:14] a solemn day.
[16:17] Holy.
[16:18] And it wasn't a day cuz day of time had
[16:21] done run out. It passed into eternity.
[16:24] See, it swung right back to the first
[16:26] day again. See, eternity is like a a
[16:29] ring. You can't find no corner to it.
[16:32] You can't find no stopping place in a
[16:33] perfect circle.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; You go on and on. I don't care how far
[16:36] you go, you're still going. You start
[16:38] going around like this, go through the
[16:39] floor, go through the earth, go beyond
[16:40] the earth, you're still going. All
[16:42] things that was created down here are
[16:44] perverted, not created by Satan will
[16:47] drop out when the great golden bell
[16:49] rings and a trumpet sounds and back down
[16:52] at the beginning where the tie post is
[16:55] made in Eden. When man came to the earth
[16:58] and he fell,
[17:00] a little lamb shed its blood that spoke
[17:04] of the great lamb was coming to shed its
[17:06] blood. Calvary raised the cross that
[17:09] died for the Old Testament to them who
[17:11] justified. look for it. And in this new
[17:14] dispensation
[17:15] at the coming of the Lord at the new
[17:17] earth, the rope of salvation, the blood,
[17:21] the redeemed power that I'm talking
[17:22] about, and through the same system has
[17:25] redeemed both man and the earth
[17:28] &gt;&gt; will raise right up into eternity again.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; And the lake of fire will consume
[17:33] everything is ungodly and
[17:34] uncredestinated to it.
[17:37] &gt;&gt; Do you see it? Yes.
[17:39] &gt;&gt; Notice
[17:41] &gt;&gt; the eighth day Jesus raised for our
[17:43] justification. The eternal king with the
[17:47] eternal kingdom to be baptized into to
[17:51] eternal life.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; Not seven days. Had nothing to do with
[17:55] any of the days. It's speaking of
[17:57] another
[17:59] &gt;&gt; eternal coming. Speaking of an eternal
[18:01] time,
[18:03] &gt;&gt; the world I'm speaking of. And notice
[18:06] after 50 days or seven Sabbaths from
[18:09] there again come another holy
[18:12] convocation. What happened? The Holy
[18:15] Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost on
[18:17] the seventh day or the eighth day
[18:19] rather. Eighth day fell on the eth day
[18:22] was seven Sabbaths later. Exactly after
[18:24] his resurrection. See so it'd be seven
[18:26] times that again. Bring it right back
[18:27] around to the first day of the week
[18:28] again.
[18:31] &gt;&gt; Exactly. See, there's your holy
[18:34] convocation.
[18:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:35] &gt;&gt; Not have anything to do with the literal
[18:37] things. It's beyond that.
[18:40] &gt;&gt; It's into the kingdom of God with
[18:42] eternal life.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; With the predestinated that never did
[18:46] start.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; It never started on anything.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; You wasn't saved on any day.
[18:52] &gt;&gt; You was always saved.
[18:56] Jesus has come to redeem that
[18:59] &gt;&gt; but you were saved from the beginning
[19:01] because you had eternal life to begin
[19:03] with.
[19:06] &gt;&gt; A trout fish can never be a gar
[19:09] &gt;&gt; or a tadpole.
[19:11] &gt;&gt; He might be in the same water with him,
[19:12] but he was from the beginning a trout.
[19:17] &gt;&gt; The net only caught him.
[19:20] See,
[19:22] &gt;&gt; but he was that from the beginning.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; There's that. Now, we're not out of
[19:27] dispensations, are we? We're right into
[19:29] the scripture. 50 days later, it come.
[19:32] See, eight cannot be counted with the
[19:34] week.
[19:36] See, it cannot be counted eight days a
[19:37] week. You can't do it.
[19:39] &gt;&gt; See, because it's only seven days in a
[19:41] week.
[19:42] &gt;&gt; Count any way you want to. Sunday's the
[19:43] first day of the week.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; See, you count seven, then you have to
[19:47] go back in and start over again. Count
[19:49] seven, come back, go over again.
[19:50] &gt;&gt; See, we live through all these types in
[19:52] here. But when you hit the eighth,
[19:54] &gt;&gt; you go on into eternity.
[19:57] &gt;&gt; You don't come by laws and rituals and
[19:59] orders. You come by predestination.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; There's a genuine holy old vocation.
[20:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[20:07] &gt;&gt; See, and we're ending the seventh church
[20:10] age.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; Church age.
[20:13] &gt;&gt; The Pentecostal age.
[20:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; Do you see it? Amen.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; We're entering that holy v cococation.
[20:21] &gt;&gt; We are entering into that real genuine
[20:26] eternity.
[20:27] &gt;&gt; Where the church is called not to some
[20:29] station, some denomination, but into
[20:32] eternity with their eternal king.
[20:37] &gt;&gt; We don't have it at all.
[20:39] &gt;&gt; No such a thing as days and hangs and
[20:41] times. You're passed into eternity.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; Where you come from?
[20:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. You was there to begin with.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; If you got eternal life, he's only one
[20:51] form. That's God.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; And you are an expressed attribute.
[20:56] &gt;&gt; See?
[20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; If you if you're not, you're not going
[20:59] to be there anyhow.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; No man can come to me except my father's
[21:05] drawing.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; See, which passes away all these old
[21:08] things, but these things don't. So, it
[21:11] speaks of eternity. The Holy Ghost is
[21:14] eternal. Then you are in eternity
[21:18] where you was all the time but you've
[21:21] just recognized what happened.
[21:25] &gt;&gt; See, you were made for an eternal
[21:27] purpose because you was a the
[21:30] manifestation of an attribute that was
[21:32] in God that thought of you
[21:34] &gt;&gt; and expressed you and he made an earth
[21:37] to take you out of
[21:39] &gt;&gt; and to make you a human being. and sin
[21:42] come along and perverted his way.
[21:44] &gt;&gt; You come anyhow
[21:47] &gt;&gt; but you was lost with the world.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; So he come and redeemed you
[21:53] &gt;&gt; the express attribute and also redeems
[21:57] his earth by the same way here
[22:02] &gt;&gt; then his purpose rolls on.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:09] Oh, that does me so much good.
[22:12] &gt;&gt; Think of just what lays ahead.
[22:44] [Music]

[50:15] Sister Heather, our precious sister
[50:16] Heather writes that last week we prayed
[50:18] for my cousin's baby Liam. They went
[50:20] through the surgery but were not able to
[50:22] save the vision in his left eye. The

[51:09] the Lord will just lead him and lead
[51:11] each one of us to be a help and that he
[51:14] would bless those.
[51:16] Let us pray. Dear God, we're so thankful

[51:57] meetings coming up. Oh God, we want your
[51:58] perfect will in our lives, Lord. The
[52:00] events from this week, Lord, from the
[52:02] next week, it just grounds our faith
[52:04] even more, Lord, knowing that you've got
[52:06] everything under control. There's no
[52:08] accidents or
[52:10] you're not anxious about anything, Lord,
[52:12] like we sometimes get. We're not
[52:14] supposed to be anxious, but Lord, our
[52:16] humanity, sometimes our flesh gets in
[52:18] the way. So pray that you just calm us
[52:20] this morning. Speak to each heart, each
[52:21] need, each life. We love you and thank
[52:24] you so very much. As we collect the
[52:25] tithes and offerings, we believe and
[52:28] pray that it'll go right to the very
[52:30] kingdom, Lord, that you claimed and we
[52:33] are part of and that it might just
[52:35] further that, Lord, that last soul we
[52:37] know would be coming right in and you'll
[52:39] be coming home for us. Lord, we thank
[52:41] you for all things. Thank you for this
[52:43] opportunity. Name of our precious Lord
[52:45] and Savior. All God's people say, "Amen.

[54:38] I am nothing
[54:42] without Lord. Take my voice. Let us sing
[54:45] about the songs of mercy that I found.
[54:48] Take my voice
[54:52] and pour it out.
[54:57] Let it sing the songs of mercy I have
[55:01] found.
[55:03] Thank you, Lord. I'm nothing.
[55:08] Oh, I'm nothing
[55:12] without you.
[55:18] And all my soul
[55:24] needs
[55:26] is all your love
[55:30] to cover me.
[55:33] All the world
[55:38] will see
[55:40] that I have nothing
[55:46] without you. Lord, take my body.
[55:52] Take my body
[55:56] and build it up.
[56:00] May it be broken as an offering of love
[56:07] for I'm nothing.
[56:12] I am nothing
[56:15] without you. Take my time, Lord.
[56:21] Lord, take my time
[56:26] here on this earth.
[56:30] Let it glorify
[56:33] all that you are worth.
[56:37] For I am nothing.
[56:41] I am nothing
[56:45] without you.
[56:48] All my soul needs
[56:51] and all my soul
[56:57] needs.
[56:59] all your love
[57:03] to cover me.
[57:06] So all the world
[57:11] will see
[57:14] I am nothing
[57:18] without you.
[57:22] [Music]
[57:25] And the second verse I was singing it
[57:27] and just you know when I when I sing
[57:29] that one normally just think yeah that's
[57:31] what it gave me my voice to sing but
[57:33] paying attention to what it said on
[57:35] there. Maybe you could put up the words
[57:37] for that second verse. Let it sings of
[57:39] let it sing of mercy that I have found.
[57:42] And that's what I want my testimony to
[57:44] be is what am I doing with my voice? Am
[57:47] I talking about what he's done for me?
[57:49] Am I talking about his mercy for me, his
[57:51] grace for me? or am I using it to talk
[57:55] something that is not consistent with
[57:58] the mercy and grace that he showed to
[58:00] me? Am I extending grace and mercy to
[58:02] others in the way that I'm talking to
[58:04] them, talking about them? Lord, just
[58:08] help me. How many can say that's your
[58:09] desire this morning? Lord, take my
[58:11] voice, pour it out. May it be used for
[58:15] your good, Lord.
[58:17] Oh, take my voice
[58:21] and pour it out,
[58:25] Lord. Let it sing us the songs of mercy
[58:30] I've found.
[58:33] I am nothing,
[58:36] Lord. I'm nothing.
[58:41] Without you,
[58:44] all my soul needs
[58:47] and all my soul
[58:52] [Music]
[58:54] is all your love
[58:59] to cover me.
[59:02] Your all the world
[59:07] will see
[59:10] that I am nothing
[59:14] without you.
[59:17] [Music]
[59:20] I need more of you.
[59:28] Yes. More of you.
[59:36] I've had it all,
[59:39] but what I need is just more of you
[59:46] [Music]
[59:50] of things
[59:51] I've had.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, but they won't satisfy.
[59:57] And yet
[59:59] I hunger
[1:00:01] still
[1:00:05] empty and bare.
[1:00:09] Lord hear my prayer
[1:00:12] for more of you.
[1:00:18] I need more
[1:00:21] of you.
[1:00:26] I need more of you.
[1:00:34] I've had it all,
[1:00:37] but what I need is more of you.
[1:00:47] of things
[1:00:49] I've had my will
[1:00:54] and yet
[1:00:56] I hunger
[1:00:58] still
[1:01:02] empty and bare.
[1:01:06] Lord hear my prayer
[1:01:09] for more of you.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Let's ask him again. That's what we need
[1:01:15] this morning, Lord, is all
[1:01:18] of you.
[1:01:23] We need more
[1:01:25] of you.
[1:01:31] We've had it all
[1:01:34] but one,
[1:01:39] just more of you.
[1:01:43] [Music]
[1:01:44] of things
[1:01:46] I've had to fear.
[1:01:51] And yet
[1:01:54] I hunger
[1:01:56] still
[1:02:00] empty and bare.
[1:02:03] Lord, hear my prayer for more of you.
[1:02:09] Just continue to worship. Pray for that
[1:02:12] this morning as they continue to play
[1:02:15] for you.

[1:06:07] Amen. Let's bow our heads for a word of
[1:06:10] prayer. Lord Jesus, ask your blessings
[1:06:13] upon this service this morning. Lord, we
[1:06:17] give you all the praise, all the glory,
[1:06:18] the honor. We thank you for another
[1:06:21] opportunity, Lord, to stand
[1:06:24] in your presence, Lord, a place provided
[1:06:28] for us to worship you in spirit and in
[1:06:31] truth. Lord, bless every heart. Send
[1:06:34] your anointing upon us. We pray, Father,
[1:06:37] just uh forgive us of any shortcomings.
[1:06:41] And we pray that you'll be glorified.
[1:06:44] you be magnified in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:06:48] Amen. God bless each of you. So happy to
[1:06:51] be in the house of the Lord with you
[1:06:53] today. And uh welcome to the house of
[1:06:57] the Lord. Amen. Are you happy to be
[1:07:00] here?
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; We're so happy to see each of and every
[1:07:03] one of you. Amen. So, I think the
[1:07:07] announcements went out for the prayer
[1:07:08] meeting for the brother's men's prayer
[1:07:11] meeting that's coming up on the 20th,
[1:07:14] next week, Saturday. And so, um, if you
[1:07:18] have an RSVP, why don't you do that so
[1:07:21] the brothers can know? And we would love
[1:07:24] to do something for you sisters, too, if
[1:07:27] someone can give me what that would be.
[1:07:31] And so, um, I know that
[1:07:35] we've been very busy with the different
[1:07:37] activities and stuff. So, but we're
[1:07:39] thinking about you all and we trust the
[1:07:42] Lord will help you help us uh to do
[1:07:44] that. And so, I was getting ready for a
[1:07:47] prayer meeting or every Saturday morning
[1:07:50] prayer meeting with the brothers. We've
[1:07:53] been doing that for I think since 2018
[1:07:57] is when we started doing that. Um and
[1:08:00] the Lord has made a way for us to do it.
[1:08:04] almost feel empty when I don't do it on
[1:08:06] my Saturday. But as I was getting ready
[1:08:10] la this last Saturday,
[1:08:12] um I thought, you know, it'd be nice.
[1:08:16] Everyone's welcome to be a part of that.
[1:08:18] It's just for the brothers only, but you
[1:08:20] sisters can get up at 4 or 5 in the
[1:08:23] morning and pray
[1:08:25] with us. And you brothers that can't
[1:08:27] come or don't come. And I'm being
[1:08:29] serious. I'm It's funny, but I'm being
[1:08:31] serious, too. you can be a part but you
[1:08:34] know in your home there and maybe pray
[1:08:37] with us because when we come together
[1:08:39] and pray the Lord has answered our
[1:08:41] prayer many many times
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; right on the scene instant healings
[1:08:46] right on the scene um and I usually ask
[1:08:50] the brothers is there anything to pray
[1:08:52] for and the brothers usually call some
[1:08:54] of your all's names out the needs of the
[1:08:56] elders I usually pray for all of the the
[1:09:00] sister churches here in the
[1:09:02] pray for voice of god recordings and not
[1:09:04] just their missionary effort but all the
[1:09:06] missionary efforts we pray for them or
[1:09:08] we try to and then that's the purpose of
[1:09:12] it so we know we can't pray too much and
[1:09:15] I think that that's where our strength
[1:09:17] lies it's a secret
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; it's a secret power
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; and um and every Christian has to
[1:09:24] develop that and the sooner you can
[1:09:27] develop that ability to pray to call on
[1:09:30] God in desperation, then God will hear
[1:09:33] your prayer. Amen. We know that prayer
[1:09:37] changes things.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; You know, God is going to do whatever he
[1:09:41] wants to do. We can't make God do
[1:09:43] anything. So, I I would love for this
[1:09:45] service to just go in a in a certain
[1:09:48] direction, but I can't make the Holy
[1:09:50] Spirit move. I can't make any service.
[1:09:53] Now, we can manufacture some things and
[1:09:56] get louder or get faster or get
[1:09:59] whatever, but God is going to do
[1:10:01] whatever he wants to do.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; But also in the realms of prayer, prayer
[1:10:07] changes things and he places that in the
[1:10:09] hands of his people. So, you can get
[1:10:13] down on your knees and pray and the Lord
[1:10:16] will hear your prayer.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. My subject is not on prayer today,
[1:10:19] but I'm just thinking about Daniel when
[1:10:22] he went to the Lord to pray. He was in
[1:10:24] prayer and 21 days later, the angel met
[1:10:29] him and said, "Daniel, the first day you
[1:10:33] prayed, I heard you, but I had to fight
[1:10:37] with the prince of the power of Persia
[1:10:41] to and I needed help from one of the
[1:10:43] angels to come and see you." But from
[1:10:46] the first day you prayed, I heard you.
[1:10:48] And that was 21 days.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; And this is an unseen battle, but the
[1:10:53] scriptures have it written there so you
[1:10:55] can see what's taking place when we
[1:10:57] pray. When you go down on your knees and
[1:10:59] pray, God hears your prayer. Can he come
[1:11:02] instantly? Does he come instantly? Well,
[1:11:05] not all the time. You He He's battling
[1:11:08] it out for you. You are battling it out.
[1:11:11] It's a weapon of our warfare. is not
[1:11:14] carnal. But we have a weapon called
[1:11:16] prayer. More greater, more powerful than
[1:11:19] the atomic bomb.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; And um this is why we have to pray for
[1:11:23] one another. We pray for the meetings.
[1:11:26] What did that atomic bomb do? That
[1:11:28] atomic bomb was I mean it was just it
[1:11:31] was powerful. Anyways, I want to get
[1:11:32] into prayer. But that um is what we do.
[1:11:38] We have that men's prayer meeting every
[1:11:40] Saturday. And then this one will be the
[1:11:43] prayer meeting for a prayer breakfast.
[1:11:46] And we've done that for four years. I
[1:11:47] think this is our fifth year. Doing
[1:11:50] that, it allows some of the other
[1:11:51] churches to come together um if they so
[1:11:56] choose and then the brothers to come
[1:11:57] together and eat and so forth. And so um
[1:12:02] I really lengthened that announcement
[1:12:04] out more than I wanted it to.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; But prayer is the key that unlocks the
[1:12:08] door. Amen.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; If maybe you don't like me, but if you
[1:12:16] pray for me, I'll prefer that.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; I want you to like me and pray for me.
[1:12:21] But if I had to choose one or the other,
[1:12:23] cuz prayer is the greatest thing you can
[1:12:25] ever do for another individual. Pray for
[1:12:29] me and I'll pray for you. Amen. And pray
[1:12:33] for the service. So, um, and then also
[1:12:36] our special meetings are coming actually
[1:12:38] in November. We have the dates on that
[1:12:41] and we want to be in prayer for that.
[1:12:44] Was there another announcement?
[1:12:47] We're going to greet the saints in Mesa.
[1:12:49] The art's not feeling well. So Ezekiel's
[1:12:51] there song leading for the service there
[1:12:55] in Mesa this morning.
[1:12:57] I would have liked to see that.
[1:13:00] But Ezekiel led the service there. He's
[1:13:02] going to lead tonight for them. So we
[1:13:04] appreciate him doing that. I don't see
[1:13:06] the saints from Ngalas here. Oh, there
[1:13:09] she is. Sorry, sis. Hopefully you can.
[1:13:12] You understand a lot of English.
[1:13:19] I said it in Spanish.
[1:13:22] No, she understands quite a bit. And if
[1:13:25] you need an interpreter, I think I don't
[1:13:28] know if Brother Ben, you're able to do
[1:13:30] that. I She maybe she's okay. But if we
[1:13:33] needed one, who would that be? Brother
[1:13:35] Ben or who else could interpret?
[1:13:38] Zack. Zack. Brother Zack, can you
[1:13:41] interpret for the sister this morning?
[1:13:44] Yeah.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; What was he gonna say? No. I appreciate
[1:13:49] Appreciate that, brother Zach. Put you
[1:13:51] on the spot like that. Thank you. So,
[1:13:54] oh my God bless you. Thank you. So,
[1:13:57] we'll get the interpreter for you, sis.
[1:14:00] Amen. And so we'll go let's go right
[1:14:03] into the word this morning and take our
[1:14:06] Bibles
[1:14:08] in
[1:14:09] a very familiar portion of scripture.
[1:14:11] Matthew chapter 16.
[1:14:15] I know this the the team in the back
[1:14:18] there got those quotes probably late. I
[1:14:20] emailed them to you. Did you get them?
[1:14:22] Okay. So, we'll be patient and I think
[1:14:25] there many of those you'll find them
[1:14:27] very quickly. Anyways, Matthew chapter
[1:14:30] 16. And I was thinking about this
[1:14:32] thought here on what our mission is
[1:14:36] and what you know what do you think of
[1:14:40] when you think of this church. Now I
[1:14:42] have it in my mind what I think is the
[1:14:45] most important thing and what I have
[1:14:47] portrayed to the church and each man
[1:14:50] here brother sister how you have
[1:14:54] portrayed what you think people think of
[1:14:57] you. But if we were to ask you,
[1:15:01] what does the church actually stand for?
[1:15:03] This little church here.
[1:15:06] I Okay, we're in the message. Yeah. But
[1:15:08] what does it actually stand for? What
[1:15:10] are we preaching on all the time? What
[1:15:12] are we always pointing people to? Sum it
[1:15:16] up in a sentence or two. Um, are we a
[1:15:20] holiness church? Are we always preaching
[1:15:22] against sin? Are we always preaching on
[1:15:25] the Holy Ghost? are we promoting the
[1:15:27] message or what part of the message?
[1:15:30] And so, um, just taking a few
[1:15:33] scriptures. I won't be able to go deep
[1:15:35] into it like the subject would allow,
[1:15:39] but I think starting here in Matthew
[1:15:40] chapter 16 will help us.
[1:15:44] What did I say? Matthew or Mark?
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Okay, we're going to take Matthew 16 and
[1:15:49] then Mark 16 also. Matthew chapter 16.
[1:15:58] In verse
[1:16:00] number 13, when Jesus came into the
[1:16:02] coast of Cesaria Philippi, he asked his
[1:16:05] disciples, saying, Whom do men say that
[1:16:09] I, the son of man, am? And they said,
[1:16:12] Some say that thou art John the Baptist,
[1:16:15] some Elias, and others Jeremas, or one
[1:16:18] of the prophets. And he saith unto them,
[1:16:22] But whom say ye that I am?
[1:16:25] And Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou
[1:16:27] art the Christ, the Son of the living
[1:16:31] God." And Jesus answered and said unto
[1:16:34] him, Blessed art thou Simon Barjonah,
[1:16:38] for flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[1:16:40] unto thee, but my father which is in
[1:16:43] heaven, and I say unto thee that thou
[1:16:47] art Peter, and upon this rock, I will
[1:16:52] build my church, and the gates of hell
[1:16:56] shall not prevail against it. So we see
[1:17:00] the church is built upon this rock. Mark
[1:17:05] chapter 16
[1:17:13] verse number 15.
[1:17:16] The prophet of God and many
[1:17:19] Christians call this the great
[1:17:22] commission. So this is the great
[1:17:24] commission of the church.
[1:17:29] When you have that, you can say amen.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Let's read it all together. Verse 15,
[1:17:34] 16, 17,
[1:17:37] and 18. All together. And he said unto
[1:17:40] them, "Go into all the world, and preach
[1:17:44] the gospel to every creature. He that
[1:17:47] believeth and is baptized shall be
[1:17:50] saved, but he that believeth not shall
[1:17:53] be damned. And these signs shall follow
[1:17:56] them that believe. In my name shall they
[1:17:59] cast out devils. They shall speak with
[1:18:02] new tongues. They shall take up
[1:18:05] serpents. And if they drink any deadly
[1:18:08] thing, it shall not hurt them. Then lay
[1:18:12] hands on the sick and they shall
[1:18:15] recover. Amen. Let us pray. Lord Jesus,
[1:18:18] we ask your blessings upon your most
[1:18:20] holy word. Bless your people. Bless me
[1:18:24] Lord. Father, may your word uh come
[1:18:28] forth how it's supposed to today in
[1:18:31] Jesus name. Amen. One more scripture as
[1:18:35] you're being seated. Acts 1:8. I'll just
[1:18:38] quote it. And ye shall receive power
[1:18:41] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[1:18:44] you. Now this uh scripture in Matthew
[1:18:49] chapter 16, you may be seated. Thank
[1:18:51] you. Our mission.
[1:18:55] This is our mission. If I was to title
[1:18:58] it, I would just title it that. Our our
[1:19:01] mission. This is the great commission.
[1:19:04] And brother Madam sums this up in uh not
[1:19:08] sums it up, but he really opens it up in
[1:19:12] a message, the invisible union of the
[1:19:14] bride of Christ. And he makes this
[1:19:16] statement. We've said it many times.
[1:19:19] Many of you know it. 1965
[1:19:22] November he says this paragraph 101 what
[1:19:27] a sacred trust what a responsibility to
[1:19:31] a woman now see why she's a type of the
[1:19:35] church which has the same responsibility
[1:19:39] as a woman has a sacred responsibility
[1:19:42] to motherhood to her virtues to her
[1:19:45] husband the church has a sacred
[1:19:49] responsibility ability to prayer and to
[1:19:53] the word and to Christ just the same as
[1:19:58] a woman has. That word responsibility is
[1:20:02] the state or the fact of having to deal
[1:20:06] with something or having control over
[1:20:08] someone. You're responsible for this one
[1:20:11] or that one. the state or fact of being
[1:20:15] accountable
[1:20:17] or to blame for something.
[1:20:20] So when you're the responsible one, you
[1:20:23] are the one to blame.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Now, we all have a level of
[1:20:28] responsibility. Every one of us do. and
[1:20:31] what man has done from the garden all
[1:20:34] the way down. We've always wanted to
[1:20:37] point the finger at somebody else's
[1:20:40] responsibility
[1:20:43] or we make an excuse to lessen
[1:20:48] the blame on us. Who wants to be blamed
[1:20:50] for anything
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; that's negative? I mean, I was to blame.
[1:20:55] Adam, what are you doing here? Uh, you
[1:20:58] have these figs on you. Well, the wife
[1:21:00] you gave me,
[1:21:03] she's to blame.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; And then the serpent, he gave me this
[1:21:08] fruit. Oh, he's to blame. The serpent's
[1:21:10] to blame. And all those things are true.
[1:21:13] The serpent was to blame. Yes, the wife
[1:21:15] was to blame. But Adam, did you have any
[1:21:18] responsibility?
[1:21:19] Is there any blame towards you?
[1:21:24] And this um um
[1:21:29] accountability
[1:21:31] is something that the scripture
[1:21:35] tells us that we are all going to have
[1:21:37] to stand and give an account one day.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Romans 14:12 says, "So then every one of
[1:21:44] us shall give an account of himself to
[1:21:49] God."
[1:21:51] So, it's not these group accountability
[1:21:55] sessions
[1:21:56] like me and my friends and me and my
[1:21:59] friend, hey, hey, stand with me in the
[1:22:01] judgment. No, no, no, no, no, no. You're
[1:22:04] not going to have these groups to stand
[1:22:05] with. You're not going to have these
[1:22:07] peers. You're not going to have the
[1:22:09] people that that that you have a problem
[1:22:11] with, the ones that you can blame.
[1:22:13] They're not going to stand with you.
[1:22:15] That's not correct. Every individual
[1:22:19] will give an account
[1:22:22] for the deeds that are done in their own
[1:22:24] bodies.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Now, our accountability is connected,
[1:22:28] too. We're connected to one another and
[1:22:32] the way I treat you and the things that
[1:22:35] I have said to you, what you have said
[1:22:37] to me and pastors and preachers and the
[1:22:41] leaders and a mother and a father to
[1:22:44] have all these levels of accountability
[1:22:47] that will be there to witness
[1:22:50] um when your time comes to be judged.
[1:22:55] And the prophet of God makes the
[1:22:58] statement, and maybe we'll read it here
[1:23:01] in a moment, that everything we've done
[1:23:04] or said in our life is being recorded
[1:23:08] right now.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; And it'll be brought back up again
[1:23:14] and it will speak on your behalf. You
[1:23:17] won't have to say anything. We just get
[1:23:19] the recording
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; and watch you and see you. And so this
[1:23:23] accountability
[1:23:26] Every one of us shall give an account to
[1:23:27] God. That's Romans 14:10. Matthew 12:36.
[1:23:31] But I say unto you that every idle word
[1:23:34] that men shall speak, they shall give an
[1:23:38] account thereof in the day of judgment.
[1:23:42] That's our Lord Jesus speaking.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness, somebody?
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Every idol word. Those are those not the
[1:23:50] verbal words. Those are little secret
[1:23:52] words. There little words that nobody
[1:23:54] else heard, but every idol word will
[1:23:58] give an account. You give an account.
[1:24:00] Jesus said so. Hebrews 13:7 says, "Obey
[1:24:03] them that have the rule over you and
[1:24:05] submit yourselves, for they watch for
[1:24:09] your souls."
[1:24:12] as that
[1:24:14] as they that must give an account that
[1:24:18] they may do it with joy, not with grief,
[1:24:21] for that is unprofitable for you. You
[1:24:24] know, the ministers are going to give an
[1:24:25] account.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; All the stuff they're saying is a nice
[1:24:29] little position. Yes, you get to stand
[1:24:31] in the front. Yes. You know, you visit a
[1:24:34] place, they give you a special seat.
[1:24:36] Yes, if you need something, you're the
[1:24:38] minister. You have all the praise. Yes.
[1:24:40] You always have the mic in your hand.
[1:24:43] You get to do all the talking. You're
[1:24:45] the preacher and you're going to give an
[1:24:48] account.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Every one of us are
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; now
[1:24:54] in
[1:24:56] uh 1 Peter 4:5 says, "Who shall give an
[1:24:59] account to him that is ready to judge or
[1:25:02] quicken the dead?" So, we see this
[1:25:04] accountability is coming to every one of
[1:25:06] us.
[1:25:08] And
[1:25:09] this is part of the sacred trust. This
[1:25:13] is part of the great commission. Go and
[1:25:16] preach the gospel to every creature. Let
[1:25:18] me ask you, have you been preaching the
[1:25:21] gospel?
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Have you been telling others and trying
[1:25:27] to witness to them about the good news?
[1:25:33] or
[1:25:35] have we developed this attitude that,
[1:25:37] you know, they're not going to receive
[1:25:38] it. It's kind of strange. It's a little
[1:25:40] off. I don't want to make it awkward. I
[1:25:42] don't want to make it uncomfortable, but
[1:25:44] you know, you're going to give an
[1:25:45] account.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; You have to give an account for your
[1:25:50] words. You have to give an account and
[1:25:52] for the scriptures to go and to preach
[1:25:56] the gospel to every creature.
[1:25:59] Brother Manner makes this statement here
[1:26:01] in the message God's only provided place
[1:26:04] of worship 1965. Now have you notice
[1:26:07] every three years a great meeting what
[1:26:10] takes place? A denomination. This is 20
[1:26:13] years and no denomination. Dear dying
[1:26:17] lamb may it never do that. If I go in
[1:26:21] this generation, may the people who
[1:26:23] believes this message never stand still
[1:26:26] for a denomination.
[1:26:28] Uh you'll die right in your track.
[1:26:30] Remember that. The very hour that you
[1:26:33] mention denomination among you. I don't
[1:26:35] care how sincere you are. Take man for
[1:26:38] your leader instead of the Holy Spirit
[1:26:39] to confirm this word. That's the hour
[1:26:42] you die. The genuine seed cannot because
[1:26:46] there's nothing left after the seed.
[1:26:48] It's the same thing was back at the
[1:26:50] beginning. It's the bride that fell in
[1:26:53] the ground to bring forth the corn of
[1:26:56] wheat. I meant to read that early
[1:26:58] earlier, but we read it and I might read
[1:27:00] it again. So this church that to preach
[1:27:04] the gospel and this solemn warning that
[1:27:08] I just read for you here as we who claim
[1:27:11] to follow the message and and really our
[1:27:14] responsibility is for this local church
[1:27:17] here, the the members in this church,
[1:27:19] how you serve one another here, that's
[1:27:22] really um what you'll be uh going to be
[1:27:26] judged with, not so much what the other
[1:27:28] churches are doing. What are you doing?
[1:27:30] what is your position? What what's
[1:27:33] taking place in your life right now is
[1:27:35] really um what you should be responsible
[1:27:39] for. And you know, one of the great
[1:27:43] warnings for those of us that follow
[1:27:46] this word, we know that every church,
[1:27:50] every group after three years, a
[1:27:53] denomination was formed.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; And what was that? that was uh the
[1:27:58] people took men as their leader instead
[1:28:01] of the Holy Spirit.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; We would say if if I was to sum up one
[1:28:06] of the greatest teachings that differs
[1:28:08] us that brother warned over and over and
[1:28:11] over against was just that one aspect
[1:28:14] right there. Do not denominate.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Do not accept the leadership of man over
[1:28:20] the word of God. He's always to remain
[1:28:24] first.
[1:28:26] And so has any of our churches that
[1:28:28] follow the message, have they
[1:28:29] denominated?
[1:28:31] The individual individuals that follow
[1:28:33] the message, have they denominated?
[1:28:36] Is there anyone in here that's ever got
[1:28:38] a denominational spirit on you?
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; And so it's a responsibility.
[1:28:45] It's a warning to us that that doesn't
[1:28:48] happen, that we don't um become a
[1:28:53] denomination because God is depending on
[1:28:57] us to represent who he is. And he said,
[1:29:01] "Upon this rock, I build my church." Not
[1:29:05] brother Israel's church, not brother so
[1:29:07] and so's church, not the reverend over
[1:29:09] there's church, but God has a church
[1:29:12] that he built his revelation upon. And
[1:29:18] the gates of hell shall never prevail
[1:29:21] against that.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Who who who are these people? What's the
[1:29:24] name of that group? What what street
[1:29:27] corner are they on? How do you identify
[1:29:30] them? These signs shall follow them that
[1:29:36] believe in my name, they'll cast out
[1:29:40] devils. So this great temptation,
[1:29:43] this great warning to not denominate
[1:29:46] you.
[1:29:48] You ever invite anyone to church,
[1:29:50] they're going to ask you what church you
[1:29:51] go to? Many times they'll ask you what
[1:29:54] denomination it is and we'll say we're
[1:29:56] not a denomination
[1:29:59] by name. But denomination isn't just a
[1:30:02] name. We know that denomination is a
[1:30:04] spirit.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; And this is probably the greatest
[1:30:07] warning in the message, overruling,
[1:30:12] overriding warning in the message is to
[1:30:15] not denominate.
[1:30:19] We are not a denomination. We're a
[1:30:21] fellowship of Jesus Christ. We are not a
[1:30:24] denomination. We are Christians,
[1:30:28] sons and daughters of God.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; We are not a denomination. We're not
[1:30:32] tied to a group. We don't have a creed.
[1:30:36] There's no rules. There's no man that
[1:30:38] leads us. We are led by the Holy Spirit.
[1:30:42] He is the captain. He's the leader of
[1:30:44] our church. He's the founder. He's the
[1:30:46] one who died. He's the one that we
[1:30:49] serve,
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; We are Christians.
[1:30:56] But we become in our little groups. We
[1:30:59] have to make sure we we let the other
[1:31:01] group know that we're not that group
[1:31:05] before 633 group or after 63 group
[1:31:08] whatever it is. And um so that's one of
[1:31:12] those great responsibilities is you know
[1:31:16] is that spirit of denomination trying to
[1:31:18] creep on me?
[1:31:20] Is it trying to creep on your pastor? Is
[1:31:23] it tried to creep in my mindset or my
[1:31:25] mentality? The message screams out
[1:31:28] against that spirit
[1:31:31] and Satan is behind it.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; He is the author of organized religion.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; He is the one who wants to control a
[1:31:44] man. One man leading another man. God
[1:31:47] never called one man to lead another
[1:31:49] man. God called the Holy Spirit to lead
[1:31:53] his church, sons and daughters of God,
[1:31:56] led by the spirit of God. Romans 8. Is
[1:32:00] that right?
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he gives us his word. Now,
[1:32:06] brother Bandom gives us this warning
[1:32:07] after every three years a great meeting
[1:32:11] what takes place a denomination forms.
[1:32:13] So what happens here? Brother Banham
[1:32:16] alive 20 years this great pillar of fire
[1:32:20] is being manifested right
[1:32:23] no denomination form and then brother
[1:32:27] Brandham leaves the scene that's been 60
[1:32:29] years ago over 60 years something like
[1:32:32] that he's been gone is that right has
[1:32:35] there been any organizations or
[1:32:37] denominations form after it
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; we might argue about that
[1:32:45] Somebody said yes. Somebody said no. Not
[1:32:47] officially. Well, officially no.
[1:32:52] But if it Did he say quack like a duck?
[1:32:55] Walks like a duck, smells like a duck,
[1:32:58] you can put chicken over it if you want
[1:33:00] to, but it's a duck.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; And you can call whatever you want to
[1:33:04] call it, whatever you want to call it.
[1:33:05] But if the spirit of organization is
[1:33:09] working or ruling the group or you in
[1:33:12] your life, then you're falling into this
[1:33:15] great trap that you were warned not to
[1:33:18] do. Brother Bam tells us in the
[1:33:20] fundamental foundation for faith 19 uh
[1:33:24] 55, he says this, "Now God is depending
[1:33:27] on you as a member of his body
[1:33:31] to bear fruit of his spirit. And now if
[1:33:35] if he's depending on you, let's open up
[1:33:38] our channels and let the Holy Spirit
[1:33:41] come in tonight and energize us
[1:33:44] and free us from all these fears and
[1:33:47] doubts. Revival has come. Someone said,
[1:33:50] "The power is only given to the apostle
[1:33:52] for those things." I'm not a historian,
[1:33:55] but I've read much history of the church
[1:33:57] history, and I've never seen a time in
[1:33:59] all the history of the world where there
[1:34:02] ever was waves of the Holy Ghost that
[1:34:04] ever struck the church and without a
[1:34:06] revival. But what signs, wonders,
[1:34:10] miracles followed it. God healed the
[1:34:12] sick in every age and will continue to
[1:34:16] do it in every age where people and
[1:34:19] churches are willing to let loose and
[1:34:22] let the Holy Spirit take control of
[1:34:26] their being.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; That's the church I want to be a part
[1:34:30] of.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; That's the church that we call God's
[1:34:35] church.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; God is depending on you. He says in
[1:34:39] questions and answers
[1:34:42] paragraph 41, God is depending on you
[1:34:44] and I. See, the Holy Spirit, the earth
[1:34:48] is full of the spirit of God, but it's
[1:34:51] poured out. It cannot operate until it
[1:34:53] comes into us. We human beings to
[1:34:57] operate. And the devil wants to take us
[1:35:00] over to operate under him.
[1:35:03] So when he gets this mouth form, he
[1:35:05] starts in sin. If he can hold him just
[1:35:09] in a righteous man, a good man, and just
[1:35:12] let him go ahead and try to be good like
[1:35:13] that, if he can hold him like that until
[1:35:16] he's dead, that's just what he wants to
[1:35:19] do.
[1:35:20] He's got him. Because no matter how
[1:35:22] righteous you are, how good you are, how
[1:35:24] moral you are, how clean you are, how
[1:35:27] honest you are, you'll never get to
[1:35:29] heaven until you're born again.
[1:35:33] Jesus said so. So there's no it's you've
[1:35:37] got to be born. You've got to be
[1:35:41] regenerated or there's not a way in the
[1:35:43] world for you to ever enter heaven or
[1:35:47] ever come to Christ.
[1:35:50] Now is that statement true or not?
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; That's a true statement.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Got to be born again.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; The Patmas vision paragraph 219.
[1:36:01] He says this here, the word was made
[1:36:03] flesh and dwelt among us. Now the word's
[1:36:06] made flesh in his church dwelling among
[1:36:09] us. His angels in his hand ministering.
[1:36:13] God is depending.
[1:36:16] God is depending upon his church. God is
[1:36:20] relying on us of this age to bring this
[1:36:25] gospel light to a dying, heathenbound
[1:36:30] traditional world. God is laying the
[1:36:33] burden on me and you.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Woe unto us if the heathen dies without
[1:36:42] knowing. Woe unto us if these people
[1:36:46] running around in this Walmart parking
[1:36:50] lot dies in this neighborhood where
[1:36:53] there's two churches in walking distance
[1:36:57] and they never hear about the gospel.
[1:36:59] Whose whose job is that?
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Who who go who whose burden is that? He
[1:37:06] said, "Well, Lord, send the Holy Spirit
[1:37:08] and just cause people to lead him in
[1:37:10] here like you let him in the time with
[1:37:13] Noah's ark. Just just blindly just let
[1:37:15] him just walk, you know, just blindly
[1:37:18] send them through these doors." He can
[1:37:21] do that.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; But he can use you, too.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Go get them.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Go get them.
[1:37:30] A free pull pit, free preaching time,
[1:37:35] a lot of ministry right there. Right
[1:37:36] over here, right there.
[1:37:40] [Music]
[1:37:42] And somebody
[1:37:45] in this neighborhood
[1:37:47] is to blame
[1:37:50] for those people not hearing it. Now,
[1:37:53] who's to blame?
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Well, he said that Catholic, there's a
[1:37:58] big Catholic church on the corner.
[1:38:00] They're the blame. They should be the
[1:38:01] ones out there trying to get the gospel
[1:38:03] to these people. I don't think so.
[1:38:07] Who's responsible for that?
[1:38:11] You know, we make excuses, don't we?
[1:38:14] We say, "Well, you know, they're so far
[1:38:17] gone and look how bad they are and look
[1:38:20] at this and you know, you know, there's
[1:38:23] no glory in spending my time with this."
[1:38:26] You know, it's dangerous out there. We
[1:38:28] like that one. There's d a lot of danger
[1:38:30] out there.
[1:38:31] It's probably more dangerous in traffic.
[1:38:35] Probably more dangerous I mean dangerous
[1:38:38] everywhere. Sure.
[1:38:41] But we're talking about preaching the
[1:38:43] gospel now. Who is responsible
[1:38:46] so that these people don't die without
[1:38:50] ever hearing about it? I think that
[1:38:52] ought to be a tragedy for a young man
[1:38:56] 20, 30, 50, whatever, die and stands
[1:39:00] before the Lord and says, "Well, what
[1:39:03] city you come?" I came out of the city
[1:39:04] of Tucson. Have you ever do you know
[1:39:07] anything about these pictures? And just
[1:39:09] show them some of these pictures. Ah,
[1:39:10] what is that?
[1:39:12] Do you know anything about the angel of
[1:39:13] the Lord coming out? No, I never heard
[1:39:15] about it. What city did you come out of?
[1:39:17] I came out of Tucson. How many churches
[1:39:19] were there? 15 of them.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:39:31] All right.
[1:39:34] Somebody's to blame for that.
[1:39:38] God is depending on you and I.
[1:39:44] Can I go a little bit further? In the
[1:39:46] message leadership, the prophet of God
[1:39:48] says this. You know, Jesus said, "In so
[1:39:51] much as you give unto the least of
[1:39:53] these, you have done it unto me." See,
[1:39:55] you're the men and women of tomorrow. If
[1:39:58] there is a tomorrow, you'll be there.
[1:40:00] God is depending on you. He's talking to
[1:40:04] these young people. 1965
[1:40:07] leadership. Where was that at? In
[1:40:09] Prescott.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Believe it's in Prescott. He's talking
[1:40:12] to the the new generation, the young
[1:40:13] generation. and and that new generation.
[1:40:17] Just look it up. It's a beautiful
[1:40:19] message. I don't have time to bring it.
[1:40:21] It's a beautiful thought that there is
[1:40:24] another generation that's following this
[1:40:26] message.
[1:40:28] Now, I know to some of the young people
[1:40:31] here, I'm old,
[1:40:34] but to the old generation, I'm young.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; So, to some people, I'm old, some people
[1:40:40] I'm young. I'm right at that little spot
[1:40:43] there. Okay. But I'm still part of the
[1:40:46] new generation.
[1:40:48] I'm a part of the generation I didn't
[1:40:50] see Moses. I didn't see the prophet. I
[1:40:53] didn't see though I know that it
[1:40:54] happened. I see the signs and wonders
[1:40:56] around the pastors. I met many of them
[1:40:59] that were part of that first generation.
[1:41:01] But here I am, you know, preaching the
[1:41:04] gospel in this city. And you know, all
[1:41:06] of the churches, I don't get along with
[1:41:08] all of them per se in the sense of like
[1:41:11] I agree with every one of them. But
[1:41:14] we're we're certainly comrades. And
[1:41:17] comrades have the same goal. Comrades
[1:41:20] don't even have to be friends. Comrades
[1:41:22] are like, "There's the enemy. Let's get
[1:41:24] them." And that's, you know, that's
[1:41:27] what, you know, that's what some of the
[1:41:28] churches are. Now, I'm friends with most
[1:41:30] of it. I I believe I I know I love all
[1:41:32] of them. I don't have nothing personal
[1:41:34] with, let me think real quick. I don't
[1:41:37] have nothing personal against none of
[1:41:38] them. But but you know we're in the city
[1:41:42] here and I believe we have the same
[1:41:46] mission and go I think if I think of all
[1:41:48] of the pastors that I know I'm talking
[1:41:49] about this city I'm talking about Tucson
[1:41:51] that I know I think every one of them
[1:41:55] want to see the gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:41:57] go forward.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; I believe that. I really do.
[1:42:02] I don't believe it's a negative. I don't
[1:42:04] believe they're devils. I don't believe
[1:42:06] they're trying to hurt. I don't believe
[1:42:07] they're trying to take something. I
[1:42:08] believe they're trying to see the
[1:42:10] message go forward. So with that I stand
[1:42:13] with them in the same mission.
[1:42:18] Okay. But I'm going to give an account
[1:42:20] not for what they are doing but I am
[1:42:23] going to give an account for my attitude
[1:42:25] towards them. And I will give an account
[1:42:29] for my own ministry,
[1:42:32] my own little gift, my own little
[1:42:34] talent, my own little wherewithal that I
[1:42:37] have. And every sister, every brother,
[1:42:40] every preacher, non- preacher, every
[1:42:43] believer
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; will give an account
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; for the good news that God gave to you.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to put that together.
[1:42:56] giving an account without your pastor,
[1:42:59] without the church, without the excuse.
[1:43:01] You personally given an account here. I
[1:43:04] gave you this. What did you do about it?
[1:43:06] Did you tell anybody in the last month?
[1:43:10] In the last year?
[1:43:12] Did you even think about telling
[1:43:14] somebody?
[1:43:17] This is the great commission. Go into
[1:43:21] all the world and preach
[1:43:25] the gospel to what? To every creature.
[1:43:31] There's some creatures out there, too.
[1:43:34] Preach it to them.
[1:43:37] This
[1:43:39] is part of our mission. Are we doing
[1:43:42] that?
[1:43:44] Amen. If we're not achieving that,
[1:43:45] there's a problem there. the unity of
[1:43:48] one God and his church.
[1:43:50] 1958 the prophet of God says this
[1:43:54] prayer 32 and Jesus said on the earth a
[1:43:56] little leavenven is a whole lump and
[1:43:58] it's got to be perfectly right or it
[1:44:01] isn't right at all and the plan of
[1:44:04] salvation has got to be exact
[1:44:07] and God's promises are exact
[1:44:12] and they work exact
[1:44:15] and there's something there is something
[1:44:18] is wrong somewhere where and if the
[1:44:21] church of the living God is not
[1:44:23] achieving what God purposed for them to
[1:44:26] do, there is something wrong with that
[1:44:29] system
[1:44:31] somewhere. Just got to be. Now,
[1:44:37] I truly believe that there is coming a
[1:44:40] church that will manifest signs,
[1:44:43] wonders, and miracles. That will be a
[1:44:45] Holy Ghost fil church. I believe that
[1:44:46] church is in existence. I believe that
[1:44:49] church is maybe an infant and some are
[1:44:52] maybe more mature. And then some I
[1:44:54] believe are really doing what the Bible
[1:44:57] said, what the message said that they
[1:44:58] would be doing. But I don't necessarily
[1:45:01] have to know them. They don't there's no
[1:45:04] s there's no, you know, demand that they
[1:45:07] have to be on Facebook where we have to
[1:45:09] say, "Oh, there's the church that's
[1:45:11] doing what he said." No, no, no, no.
[1:45:13] Very well could be in existence. And I
[1:45:15] believe it is in existence somewhere
[1:45:21] cuz God keeps his word and he always has
[1:45:24] a witness.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; So the idea that God's church
[1:45:29] manifesting with the signs, wonders, and
[1:45:32] miracles like it's supposed to be like
[1:45:34] it's going to be posted on some church
[1:45:37] form so everybody can identify that
[1:45:39] we're doing what actually what brother
[1:45:41] Brandham said to do. Who said that it
[1:45:43] has to exist? Could
[1:45:48] very well be a young brother picked up
[1:45:52] this message and believed it and is
[1:45:56] preaching it and God's manifesting it
[1:45:59] with signs, wonders, and miracles. Let's
[1:46:02] be real clear. The Lord is manifesting
[1:46:06] miracles,
[1:46:07] signs, wonders in our midst.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:14] But how many want to see more of it?
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. How many want to get drunk
[1:46:22] in the spirit?
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about drunk for the sake
[1:46:26] of getting drunk.
[1:46:29] I'm talking about drunk with a purpose
[1:46:31] behind it.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about when a sinner comes in
[1:46:36] our midst, they say, "Surely God is
[1:46:40] among them people." Amen.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; That's the scripture. That's the Bible
[1:46:43] says that when the stranger is among you
[1:46:46] and this thing takes place, they'll say,
[1:46:48] "Surely
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; God is with them
[1:46:53] people."
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; That little neighborhood over there.
[1:46:59] All right.
[1:47:00] Praise the Lord.
[1:47:04] I'm going to run the aisle in a minute.
[1:47:05] Now,
[1:47:08] so there's only one place provided by
[1:47:11] God here. Now, so we've been warned
[1:47:15] about this organization, warned about
[1:47:17] this denomination. And here's what the
[1:47:19] prophet of God says. This is really
[1:47:20] striking. When I read this, it really
[1:47:22] struck me. 1963,
[1:47:26] he says this. Today, I know it's
[1:47:29] becoming the same way. There's not a
[1:47:32] thing left, my Christian friend, but the
[1:47:33] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. That's
[1:47:36] the only hope that the church has as far
[1:47:39] as it comes. If it ever takes up a
[1:47:41] denomination again, it's finished
[1:47:44] because every denomination's finished.
[1:47:47] When it become a denomination, it's the
[1:47:50] very thing I'll say something here.
[1:47:53] Maybe I ought to say it, but yet I
[1:47:55] believe I ought to say it. Remember he's
[1:47:58] in Chicago telling us if you notice
[1:48:01] Lucifer is exactly doing the same thing
[1:48:05] today that he did at the beginning. See
[1:48:09] Lucifer at the beginning wanted to build
[1:48:12] himself a kingdom which was greater and
[1:48:15] more beautiful than Michael's kingdom.
[1:48:17] Christ
[1:48:18] that he that was that was his ambition
[1:48:22] to achieve something like that. And what
[1:48:24] did he get to do it by? He took fallen
[1:48:28] angels
[1:48:29] who had lost their first estate. He took
[1:48:32] that to do it with. And today Lucifer
[1:48:34] has got into the church and taken away
[1:48:38] the word and injected denomination.
[1:48:42] And he is building a church. The
[1:48:44] ecomunical move that's going on now to
[1:48:48] unite all Protestants together and then
[1:48:51] all together come to Catholic. And this
[1:48:54] pope, they got in now to do the same
[1:48:57] thing, exactly what the scripture said
[1:48:59] it would do. And what's he doing it by?
[1:49:02] He's doing it by man of those great
[1:49:06] economical moves who does not know God.
[1:49:09] And many of them in the Pentecostals
[1:49:13] cause because they're doing the same.
[1:49:16] What is it? He's doing it with fallen
[1:49:19] angels,
[1:49:20] fallen Lutheran, fallen Methodists,
[1:49:24] fallen Pentecostals that lost their
[1:49:27] original state from the word of God. Can
[1:49:29] I add one in there? Fallen message
[1:49:31] believers,
[1:49:33] fallen so-called believers who's fallen
[1:49:36] from the word of God and going right
[1:49:38] back into make a great big economical
[1:49:41] move. fallen messengers. Messengers who
[1:49:45] once stayed with the word but sold out
[1:49:48] their birthrights and join in with the
[1:49:50] world. Same thing it is at the last day
[1:49:54] and their and Lucifer is achieving today
[1:49:57] by man with those spirits in them that
[1:50:00] he did with angels at the beginning.
[1:50:02] Fallen angels who kept not their first
[1:50:04] estate to obey God. And he's doing the
[1:50:07] same thing today.
[1:50:11] This was after he preached Christ the
[1:50:14] mystery of God revealed
[1:50:16] and keeps talking about it 4-hour
[1:50:18] message. He just got through preaching
[1:50:20] that. He travels up to Chicago and then
[1:50:22] he drops this in here that this is what
[1:50:25] Lucifer is doing. He's gathering fallen
[1:50:30] angels and he's showing us that these
[1:50:32] fallen angels are fallen men that fallen
[1:50:35] Luther's, Methodists, whatever. They've
[1:50:37] fallen from the word and they've caused
[1:50:40] this to be called a so-called church.
[1:50:46] Everybody that's called a church is not
[1:50:48] a church. And everybody that's called a
[1:50:51] Christian is not a Christian. But my
[1:50:53] responsibility is to be a part of the
[1:50:55] church that Christ built upon this rock.
[1:51:00] I will build my church
[1:51:04] and the gates of hell shall never
[1:51:05] prevail against it. And the day I take
[1:51:08] man's leadership over the word of God,
[1:51:11] that's the day that I die. And all of
[1:51:14] the groups that have gone on before us
[1:51:15] that did it, they died. And our groups
[1:51:18] are no different.
[1:51:21] This little church is no different.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Any individual in here is no different.
[1:51:28] The day you take the leadership of man,
[1:51:32] man's idea, your idea over the word of
[1:51:37] God, that's the day you die and you're
[1:51:39] not fulfilling the mission of the great
[1:51:40] church that we're supposed to be
[1:51:42] fulfilling. Now, brother Vanam asked
[1:51:44] this question. Now, that was a loaded
[1:51:46] one there. Lucifer is now in the church
[1:51:49] now leading people. He asked this
[1:51:51] question in his message. Remember he was
[1:51:55] traveling from overseas. I think he was
[1:51:57] in South Africa. He come across a
[1:51:59] missionaries that were in the airport
[1:52:01] with him,
[1:52:03] a young man and two ladies and they had
[1:52:06] been on the mission field for a number
[1:52:07] of years. And he asked him this question
[1:52:10] and it's a real one and it's a
[1:52:12] challenging question. And those of you
[1:52:15] that are sleeping, please wake up to
[1:52:17] receive at least this question.
[1:52:21] How many souls have you brought to
[1:52:24] Christ since you have been witnessing on
[1:52:29] the mission field? How many souls? How
[1:52:31] many souls?
[1:52:37] You know, I I would even phrase a
[1:52:39] question like this. How many souls have
[1:52:41] you even told about Christ? not even
[1:52:44] warned them to Christ. Have you even
[1:52:46] told about Christ?
[1:52:50] Whose job is that? We say, "Well,
[1:52:52] brother, it's brother Ben's job because
[1:52:54] he, you know, he likes to witness." Or,
[1:52:57] "It's brother Chris's job because he's
[1:52:59] likes to witness and he's tall and he
[1:53:01] can get out there and more visible." No,
[1:53:04] it's sister so and so, sister
[1:53:07] whoever's position because she's, you
[1:53:10] know, she's got that nature. She could
[1:53:11] talk to every No, it's go into all the
[1:53:13] world and preach the gospel. Who is he
[1:53:15] talking to? His church. Who are you a
[1:53:17] part of? Who's going in the rapture?
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; Who's the bride of Christ?
[1:53:23] This is a responsibility. Somebody's to
[1:53:25] blame for the sinners on the streets
[1:53:26] that didn't hear. Now, if they heard
[1:53:28] about it, that's one thing. But if they
[1:53:31] didn't hear about it, what neighborhood
[1:53:34] was you living? Oh, I've lived next door
[1:53:36] to a believer and he don't even know
[1:53:38] anything about Christ.
[1:53:40] I I would say this. I would say this
[1:53:43] there there is no mechanical way of say
[1:53:46] brothers, well now I'm going to go out
[1:53:47] there and go knock on every door. No,
[1:53:49] no, no. I think it starts by you
[1:53:51] praying. It has to be a desire in your
[1:53:54] heart
[1:53:55] to see someone else come to the Lord
[1:53:57] Jesus Christ.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; And that someone else might be my
[1:54:01] sister.
[1:54:03] It might be my brother or one of my
[1:54:04] uncles.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; It might be somebody that looks like
[1:54:07] you, like me, like whoever. But it
[1:54:10] should be somebody that we're going to
[1:54:13] go get to talk about the gospel.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; We're responsible for that. Amen.
[1:54:22] Amen. Now, I like how brother Brandon
[1:54:25] brings it here. And be not afraid.
[1:54:32] We stand on the corner somewhere in our
[1:54:34] church. We cast out the net through the
[1:54:36] neighborhood and gather with all that we
[1:54:38] can, bringing in every sinner. No matter
[1:54:41] what position he's in, we try to bring
[1:54:43] him to Christ. Well, then there comes a
[1:54:46] time when we want to reach a way out.
[1:54:49] So, we put all of our nets together so
[1:54:52] we can go away out and get a big rake.
[1:54:55] And that's what we're here for tonight.
[1:54:58] And I just knitted my net in the
[1:55:00] fellowship of love around the brethren
[1:55:03] and their net to sane way out through
[1:55:06] Los Angeles and around and see how many
[1:55:09] souls we can get in for Christ. That's
[1:55:12] the purpose of being here. Don't you
[1:55:14] like that attitude?
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; I think that's the right attitude. I
[1:55:17] think the right attitude is like let's
[1:55:19] see how many souls we can get into
[1:55:21] Christ. Let's see who we can witness the
[1:55:24] word of truth to. Okay, that's the right
[1:55:27] attitude. And then brother Bam deals
[1:55:29] with this end door to the heart 1958. He
[1:55:32] says one of the greatest churches that I
[1:55:33] know of the pro in the Protestant realm.
[1:55:36] I was coming down out of southern
[1:55:38] Rhdesia and I'd been up there in a
[1:55:40] meeting and I seen the American
[1:55:41] passport. There was three little girls
[1:55:44] and a boy and I said, "I see that you
[1:55:46] got American passports." He turned and
[1:55:48] said, "Oh, you speak English?" I said,
[1:55:50] "I'm an American." I said, "What are
[1:55:53] you?" He said, "Oh, we're missionaries."
[1:55:55] I said, "That's fine." And I said,
[1:55:57] "Where are you from?" And they was from
[1:55:59] my backyard almost where the great
[1:56:02] seminary is at. I said, "That's good." I
[1:56:04] said, "I'm from Jeffersonville,
[1:56:06] Indiana." Oh. He said, "You are? How
[1:56:09] long you been over?" He said, "Going
[1:56:12] over two years." I said, "How many souls
[1:56:15] have you won to Christ since you've been
[1:56:18] over?" Ducked his head. And I said,
[1:56:21] "Sisters, have have have many have you
[1:56:24] won to Christ since you've been over?"
[1:56:27] But just before I did that, he says,
[1:56:29] "What's your name?" I said, "Brandom."
[1:56:32] Oh. He said, "You're the one that caught
[1:56:33] that big stir down in Africa down
[1:56:35] there." Down in South Africa. I said, "I
[1:56:38] don't know whether there was any stir or
[1:56:40] not." He says, "Well, we heard that you
[1:56:42] was a holy roller." I said, "30,000 raw
[1:56:46] heathens come to Christ day before
[1:56:48] yesterday." I said, "There's more than
[1:56:51] all of our churches has done in our
[1:56:53] missionaries in 150 years over there."
[1:56:56] And I found missionaries, our natives
[1:56:58] coming in with the tag on their neck as
[1:56:59] a missionary as Christians packing an
[1:57:02] idol in their army. So, Brother Adam
[1:57:04] continues on. And so, he asked the
[1:57:08] question. That's all it was was a
[1:57:10] question.
[1:57:12] You're missionary.
[1:57:14] Two years you've been missionary on the
[1:57:16] field. How many souls have you won to
[1:57:18] Christ? It's a real question. I'd ask
[1:57:20] that question to us tonight or this
[1:57:23] morning.
[1:57:25] Brother Brandham continues in paragraph
[1:57:28] number 12 in the message experiences. I
[1:57:31] have a couple more quotes here. God
[1:57:34] bless you. I said, "Gentlemen, for the
[1:57:36] past 50 years, you've been sending
[1:57:37] missionaries down in Africa. I met many
[1:57:39] of them. I've been there for a long
[1:57:41] time. Some of them little old girls
[1:57:44] there said they were missionaries." And
[1:57:46] boys, I said, "Where are you from?" They
[1:57:48] told me what college they're from. How
[1:57:50] many souls you won to Christ? Not none
[1:57:52] yet. Riding out in a nice car, live in
[1:57:55] the best hotels, and says, "None yet."
[1:57:59] No. When the natives have a war dance
[1:58:00] after they come up out of the mines and
[1:58:04] things, they pass out a few tracks. What
[1:58:06] does a native know about a tract?
[1:58:10] Paul learned a long time ago Jesus
[1:58:13] Christ always knows that it takes power
[1:58:16] to convert the heathen. That's right.
[1:58:20] They was walking around there and all
[1:58:22] them little old pamphlets in their hand.
[1:58:24] As soon as their back was turned, they
[1:58:26] throw it away like that. I said, "You
[1:58:28] sent missionaries in there for 50 years.
[1:58:31] You spend millions of dollars." I says,
[1:58:33] "What would what you call fanaticism
[1:58:36] won more people to Christ in five
[1:58:38] minutes time than all the missionaries
[1:58:41] you sent in for 50 years?" Hallelujah.
[1:58:44] Our God lives and reigns. He's a God of
[1:58:48] power.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; How many believe that?
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Look at brother Brandham, the blushing
[1:58:57] prophet. Look at his attitude. So, first
[1:58:59] the attitude should be let's see how
[1:59:01] many we can get. Let's see who we can go
[1:59:04] get. And then the question should be
[1:59:06] asked, how many did you how many have
[1:59:08] you witnessed to? Did you win? How many
[1:59:11] did you witness to? What's your
[1:59:12] witnessing strategy? Are you even
[1:59:15] thinking about it? Do you even pray
[1:59:16] about it? Is it something that's a
[1:59:18] burden on you when Jesus said go and
[1:59:20] preach the gospel?
[1:59:24] Oh, how we need to pray. Now, we'll go
[1:59:27] back to you again, brother. Do you
[1:59:29] realize we don't pray half as much as
[1:59:31] our fathers did? Pastor, do you know we
[1:59:35] don't put as much time on our knees as
[1:59:37] the pastors before us did? Women, do you
[1:59:40] realize you don't instruct your daughter
[1:59:43] and pray with her at night like your
[1:59:45] mother did you? Then what about it? Who
[1:59:48] is guilty? We are guilty. There's no way
[1:59:52] around it. We are guilty. I'm guilty.
[1:59:54] I'm guilty of not doing the job of God
[1:59:57] like I should do. I'm confessing it that
[2:00:00] I'm wrong. I'm asking God to be merciful
[2:00:03] to me. I look out here and see the
[2:00:05] opportunities I've missed because of
[2:00:07] petty things, little old insignificant
[2:00:10] things that didn't mean nothing. I'm
[2:00:12] ashamed of myself as a gospel minister
[2:00:15] before you. I repent before God. And I
[2:00:19] ask God to forgive me and the church to
[2:00:21] forgive me for being so dilitary about
[2:00:25] the work of God.
[2:00:27] By the grace of God and by the help of
[2:00:29] God, I'll not listen to what everyone
[2:00:32] trying to tell you something to do. They
[2:00:34] got a program. They got something for
[2:00:36] you to do. Nonsense. I know God's
[2:00:39] program. It's written out here in the
[2:00:41] Bible. And I'm ashamed of myself as a
[2:00:43] minister of the gospel. 1 million souls
[2:00:46] won. I ought to have 10 million souls
[2:00:50] won. I'm way behind. Look at the
[2:00:54] attitude of a successful man.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; I would say Brother Brandon was
[2:00:58] successful in this ministry.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; I believe he's got rewards to prove it.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; I believe it's diligence, his family,
[2:01:05] the witness behind, the fruits left
[2:01:07] behind. His 60 years passed and his
[2:01:09] message has gotten stronger and greater.
[2:01:11] I say he was successful.
[2:01:13] wouldn't you? But look at the attitude
[2:01:16] of a successful man. Thinks he's never
[2:01:19] done enough
[2:01:22] versus
[2:01:24] looking for an excuse or a reason not to
[2:01:26] do anything. He won 1 million. Wow. I'd
[2:01:29] say wow. But then he says, "I should
[2:01:31] have won 10." And I think that's the
[2:01:33] right balance. I think we should be
[2:01:37] doing something, but then we should be
[2:01:40] doing even more than we're doing.
[2:01:44] And that's not a criticism. That's an
[2:01:46] encouragement. That's a coach. That's a
[2:01:49] teacher. That's the Lord leading you on.
[2:01:52] There's lots of work to do. The the
[2:01:56] laborers are few. The harvest is plenty,
[2:02:01] but the labor can't find anybody to go
[2:02:03] work.
[2:02:06] I need some workers in my vineyard. I
[2:02:08] can't find anybody to work.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, somebody.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; And then he comes back into that cro
[2:02:20] that question again. 1 million souls
[2:02:22] won. I ought to have 10 million souls
[2:02:24] won. I'm way behind. What about you? How
[2:02:29] many souls you want since you've been in
[2:02:32] Christ?
[2:02:33] Christianity just goes from one to
[2:02:36] another.
[2:02:38] How many souls you won since you've been
[2:02:41] a Christian? If you're not winning
[2:02:43] souls, you're guilty. You are barren.
[2:02:47] You have brought shame on the church and
[2:02:51] the gospel. How many people you get out
[2:02:54] for Wednesday night prayer meeting?
[2:02:58] You got to get out yourself
[2:03:01] before you can get somebody out.
[2:03:03] Y'all don't let me start preaching in
[2:03:05] here this morning.
[2:03:07] How many people you get up for a
[2:03:09] Wednesday night prayer meeting?
[2:03:12] If you're not doing it, you ought to be
[2:03:14] ashamed of yourself before Christ.
[2:03:17] You're guilty. Your place is at the
[2:03:19] altar. I invite you to come with me for
[2:03:23] repentance. All right. Now, every
[2:03:26] service wasn't a repentance service,
[2:03:29] right? Every service, brother cry out
[2:03:32] and go to the altar every service. But
[2:03:35] here's one that he did.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; He got to preach that one.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; Is that right or wrong?
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; If we
[2:03:52] would internalize the quotations, I
[2:03:54] think we would move a little
[2:03:56] differently. Now in the message church
[2:03:58] order, brother Vandom says this here.
[2:04:00] Now may the Lord bless you all and I
[2:04:03] trust that this will be carried out to
[2:04:05] the very best of our knowledge. May the
[2:04:07] Holy Spirit watch over each one of you.
[2:04:09] And may every officer of the church fill
[2:04:12] his post of duty knowing this that God
[2:04:14] is going to hold you responsible for how
[2:04:17] you held your office in the church. Each
[2:04:21] one will have to give an account.
[2:04:26] How many believe that?
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, we'll give an account.
[2:04:42] The prophet says this 1963,
[2:04:45] show us the father. Heavenly Father, we
[2:04:47] have assembled in the in in the name of
[2:04:49] thy dear son, the Lord Jesus. realize
[2:04:51] the sacredness of this hour. After it is
[2:04:55] passed, it'll be history. And we'll give
[2:04:58] an account at the day of judgment for
[2:05:01] being here tonight and for what we do.
[2:05:04] Therefore, Father, we are coming to thee
[2:05:07] with bowed heads and bowed hearts,
[2:05:09] asking for mercy, that the great Holy
[2:05:12] Spirit will come upon us and lead us to
[2:05:15] what we should say and what we should
[2:05:18] do.
[2:05:20] Now, so
[2:05:23] this thought of preaching the gospel or
[2:05:25] winning souls or preaching to the lost,
[2:05:28] there's a there's that purpose. There's
[2:05:30] the attitude that we should have the
[2:05:32] attitude to go be willing to go. Then we
[2:05:35] ask ourselves, how successful are we?
[2:05:38] You know, the Lord has to he's, you
[2:05:40] know, we planting water, but God gives
[2:05:42] the increase. We understand that. And
[2:05:44] then whatever we have done, we should
[2:05:46] have done more.
[2:05:49] I think that's the right balance. It's
[2:05:50] the right attitude. That way you don't
[2:05:52] stay rusty. You don't stay overconfident
[2:05:54] like, "Yeah, we got my look. Last year
[2:05:57] we we did better than we did last year.
[2:05:59] That's great, but what are we doing this
[2:06:01] year? We should be doing more, right?"
[2:06:03] And I think that's the right attitude. I
[2:06:05] think that the generation I have many
[2:06:08] more quotes here, but I'm going to uh
[2:06:11] land here. I think there's a struggle
[2:06:14] that we all have to go through
[2:06:17] and there is that, you know, I have a
[2:06:21] struggle. You have your struggle. I I
[2:06:23] said it the other day. It's probably
[2:06:25] this is probably the hardest age
[2:06:28] for an individual to sit in a church and
[2:06:32] listen to preaching.
[2:06:34] It's probably the hardest age to preach
[2:06:36] to people that's sitting in a church
[2:06:38] with all of the distractions. Hardest
[2:06:40] age to be a young person. Hardest age to
[2:06:42] be a mother, to be a father, the hardest
[2:06:44] age just to do anything decent or that's
[2:06:48] right. You go to do good, evil is there
[2:06:52] always.
[2:06:54] But he's given us the power
[2:06:57] to overcome the enemy.
[2:07:00] And God is dependent on us.
[2:07:04] And woe to us if the heathen die and
[2:07:07] don't know the gospel. And I know that
[2:07:11] this mission or the the purpose of the
[2:07:14] church or the responsibility of the
[2:07:18] church, the God gives us a great warning
[2:07:22] that that's our responsibility. It's to
[2:07:25] prayer
[2:07:27] uh to the word and to Christ. It's a
[2:07:31] sacred trust that we have. It's a
[2:07:33] responsibility. It's a burden that's
[2:07:36] laid upon us.
[2:07:38] It's our personal accountability.
[2:07:43] What kind of church are you going to
[2:07:45] anyways?
[2:07:48] Huh?
[2:07:51] What kind of people go there?
[2:07:54] What's the mission of that church? Are
[2:07:56] you even interested? Are you even
[2:07:58] involved?
[2:08:00] Huh?
[2:08:01] Is it God's church?
[2:08:05] it just so random just so happened to be
[2:08:07] you know there or is there a purpose is
[2:08:10] there a plan I believe there's a purpose
[2:08:12] there's a plan there's a mission and I
[2:08:15] want to take the responsibility
[2:08:17] thank God for what we have but I believe
[2:08:21] there should be more
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; huh
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; Lord give me strength give me grace give
[2:08:27] me energy give me insight give me
[2:08:30] revelation give me the tools make me
[2:08:33] gifted make be talented so that I
[2:08:38] can win others to Christ so that I can
[2:08:41] preach the gospel. Amen.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; Well, each one will give an account for
[2:08:47] that. God bless you so much. Let us
[2:08:49] pray.
[2:08:52] Lord Jesus, we thank you for your word
[2:08:54] today.
[2:08:56] We ask you Lord to make these
[2:09:00] things a reality to us.
[2:09:03] Father
[2:09:05] take the few words
[2:09:07] in simplicity Lord but bring the power
[2:09:11] behind it to make it a reality to us is
[2:09:14] our prayer.
[2:09:16] Oh God,
[2:09:18] the little burden, the little thought
[2:09:20] placed upon our heart. Father, I just
[2:09:23] pray and ask you to develop that
[2:09:28] and to every every believer,
[2:09:31] Lord, to be a witness for you to go to
[2:09:36] preach the gospel to every creature.
[2:09:39] And Lord, with the power of God that you
[2:09:42] have built your church upon,
[2:09:45] Lord, that we're standing for your word
[2:09:50] and that the Holy Ghost will fall among
[2:09:53] us and be a part of our praise, our
[2:09:56] worship, and things that we do. May you
[2:09:58] grant it, Father. We pray in Jesus name.
[2:10:04] Jesus,
[2:10:05] [Music]
[2:10:06] use me, John.
[2:10:10] Lord.
[2:10:11] [Music]
[2:10:14] Oh, surely
[2:10:20] I can do
[2:10:27] even though it's hard
[2:10:31] [Music]
[2:10:32] of my will to grow.
[2:10:38] of the cross be great. I'll work for
[2:10:43] you.
[2:10:45] [Music]
[2:10:48] Dear Lord, I'll be a witness
[2:10:54] if you will help my weakness.
[2:11:00] I know that I'm not worthy, Lord of
[2:11:05] peace.
[2:11:11] By eyes of faith I see thee
[2:11:16] upon the cross of Calvary.
[2:11:22] Dear Lord I cry, let me be thy servant
[2:11:28] be.
[2:11:32] Lord Jesus,
[2:11:36] use me.
[2:11:39] Oh Lord, don't refuse me.
[2:11:44] For surely there's a work that I can do.
[2:11:55] And even though it's humbled,
[2:12:01] Lord, help my will to crumble.
[2:12:07] Though the cost be great
[2:12:11] for you,
[2:12:14] [Music]
[2:12:17] I will stand for thee, dear Jesus.
[2:12:22] Though death may come my way,
[2:12:28] I'll spread the gospel to the lost each
[2:12:34] day.
[2:12:36] [Music]
[2:12:39] But if it be thy will
[2:12:45] to go across the sea,
[2:12:50] Lord, help me to be willing
[2:12:55] to say yes.
[2:12:58] [Music]
[2:13:01] Oh Jesus,
[2:13:02] [Music]
[2:13:04] use me.
[2:13:06] [Music]
[2:13:07] Please Lord, don't refuse me.
[2:13:12] Surely there's no work that I can do.
[2:13:20] [Music]
[2:13:23] And even though it's humble,
[2:13:28] Lord, help my will to crumble.
[2:13:34] Though the cross be great over
[2:13:40] you,
[2:13:41] [Music]
[2:13:44] and he's the lily of the valley.
[2:13:50] He's the bright and morning star.
[2:13:56] He's the fairest of 10,000
[2:14:00] to my soul.
[2:14:06] He's the beautiful rose of Sharon.
[2:14:12] He's all the world to me.
[2:14:18] But best of all, he is my coming king.
[2:14:25] [Music]
[2:14:28] Oh Jesus,
[2:14:32] use me.
[2:14:34] Please, Lord, don't refuse me.
[2:14:40] Surely there's a work that I can do.
[2:14:50] And even though it's hard,
[2:14:56] held my will to crumble.
[2:15:00] [Music]
[2:15:01] Oh, the cross be great power for you.

[2:21:50] nor does he slumber.
[2:21:57] God still moves.
[2:22:02] Yes, God still moves.
[2:22:07] Oh, God still.
[2:22:13] Yes, God still moves
[2:22:20] in the heart
[2:22:23] of his people. God's the old.
[2:22:31] He does not sleep,
[2:22:36] nor does he slumber.
[2:22:43] God still moves. Let's stand as we sing
[2:22:46] it one more time. Yes, God still.
[2:22:53] Oh, God
[2:22:55] still.
[2:22:58] [Music]
[2:22:59] Yes, God still moves
[2:23:06] in the hearts
[2:23:09] of his people. God still lives.
[2:23:16] He does not sleep,
[2:23:22] nor does he slumber.
[2:23:28] God still moves.
[2:23:32] [Music]
[2:23:34] God still moves.
[2:23:41] I think all of us can say oh me instead
[2:23:43] of amen this morning.
[2:23:46] It's I was challenged. I think this week
[2:23:49] has been something that I've been
[2:23:50] thinking about that and
[2:23:53] we've probably all heard of the young
[2:23:56] man Charlie Kirk that was had his life
[2:23:58] taken this week and and just looking at
[2:24:01] a man 31 years old it's a year older
[2:24:04] than Tim and just looking at the burden
[2:24:07] that he had to spread the gospel and you
[2:24:10] know we can we can sit and criticize but
[2:24:12] what have we been doing and just think
[2:24:15] his his wife was giving a speech
[2:24:18] um the first time that we'd heard from
[2:24:20] her and she said you know one of the
[2:24:21] last conversations he had here on this
[2:24:23] earth he was sharing the gospel with
[2:24:24] somebody and you know taken in the line
[2:24:27] of duty and and just I just speaking
[2:24:33] from myself being raised on a message
[2:24:35] pew I think we just become a little too
[2:24:38] too uh much like the Pharisees and we
[2:24:41] have got so much and if we really
[2:24:44] believed it we would be telling telling
[2:24:47] people about what we're so excited
[2:24:49] about. And if we don't have that fire
[2:24:52] lit, then
[2:24:54] this is where we need to be. Lord, just
[2:24:57] light that fire in me and give me that
[2:25:00] let people see something in me that
[2:25:02] they're not seeing some some Pharisee.
[2:25:04] They're not seeing somebody who's
[2:25:07] self-righteous, but somebody that is on
[2:25:09] fire with his joy and with his peace and
[2:25:12] with his love that that just radiates
[2:25:14] from our life and and draws people to
[2:25:16] him and he does the work, but he needs
[2:25:19] to he needs our hands to use. He needs
[2:25:22] our voice as we sung at the beginning of
[2:25:23] the service.
[2:25:26] He still moves and I want him to move
[2:25:27] through me. I think that's each of our
[2:25:28] desire. Brother Joseph Carver, would you
[2:25:30] come and just dismiss us with a word of
[2:25:32] prayer this morning?
[2:25:34] [Music]
[2:25:39] Thank you, John, for mentioning Charlie.
[2:25:42] Um,
[2:25:43] it was uh really hard for us to hear
[2:25:45] that news cuz we know he spent his life
[2:25:47] preaching the gospel, sharing the word,
[2:25:50] and besides political, you know, he's
[2:25:52] the same age as me and Tim with the
[2:25:54] family. And it's hard to know that
[2:25:56] there's so many people that pretty much
[2:26:00] hate the word or hearing it. You know,
[2:26:01] we pray for them. We don't hate others.
[2:26:04] That's all we can do is pray. So, please
[2:26:06] bow your head with me. Dear Lord, thank
[2:26:08] you. We come together as a body, as one
[2:26:12] under your precious blood, your
[2:26:14] sacrifices that you've made for our
[2:26:16] souls, our sins, our shortcomings.
[2:26:20] All we ask is that our prayers are
[2:26:23] heard. You have ultimate control.
[2:26:27] We praise all the blessings you give us.
[2:26:30] We we take a knee.
[2:26:33] We understand that there's so much evil
[2:26:35] around us more than ever. We know that
[2:26:39] the end times are near. There's signs
[2:26:42] all around us. We can ignore them. We
[2:26:44] can pretend that they don't affect us,
[2:26:46] but they are put into our life. And
[2:26:50] we know that we can back ourselves, our
[2:26:54] souls, our lives with your word.
[2:26:57] Please let us keep coming together
[2:26:59] praising your name.
[2:27:01] Let us learn from our prophet brother
[2:27:03] Brandham. He laid out a road mapap for
[2:27:06] us to save us. And every time we come
[2:27:08] together,
[2:27:11] all we can do is say amen, hallelujah.
[2:27:14] Thank you for all the things you've
[2:27:15] given to us, the things you've taken
[2:27:16] from us that did not need to be in our
[2:27:18] lives and place us in all the right
[2:27:21] situations to grow stronger in your
[2:27:23] Lord. We love you, Lord.
[2:27:26] And the people say amen. Thank you.
[2:27:31] Amen.
[2:27:33] Remember the service at 5:00 this
[2:27:35] evening. Sing that song key of G. When
[2:27:40] the roll is called up yonder, I'll be
[2:27:42] there. When the trumpet of the Lord
[2:27:44] shall sound and time shall be no more.
[2:27:48] And the morning breaks eternal bright
[2:27:51] and fair.
[2:27:53] When the saved of earth shall gather
[2:27:56] over on the other shore and the roll is
[2:28:00] called up yonder, I'll be there.
[2:28:04] Oh, when the roll
[2:28:07] is called up yonder.
[2:28:10] When the roll
[2:28:12] is called up yonder.
[2:28:15] When the roll
[2:28:18] is called up yonder.
[2:28:22] When the roll is called up yonder, I'll
[2:28:25] be there.
[2:28:27] And on that bright and cloudless
[2:28:30] morning, when the dead in Christ shall
[2:28:32] rise, and the glory of his resurrection
[2:28:37] share,
[2:28:39] when his chosen one shall gather to
[2:28:42] their hol beyond the sky and the roll is
[2:28:46] called up yonder, I'll be there.
[2:28:50] Oh, where the road
[2:28:52] is called up yonder.
[2:28:55] Where the road?
[2:28:58] It's called up yonder
[2:29:01] where the roll.
[2:29:03] It's called up yonder.
[2:29:08] Where the roll is called yonder, I'll be
[2:29:11] there.
[2:29:13] So let us labor for the master from the
[2:29:17] dawn till setting sun. Let us talk of
[2:29:20] all his wondous love and care.
[2:29:24] Then when all of life is over and our
[2:29:28] work on earth is done and the roll is
[2:29:31] called up yonder, I'll be there.
[2:29:35] Oh, when the roll
[2:29:38] is called up yonder.
[2:29:41] When the roll
[2:29:43] is called up yonder.
[2:29:47] When the road
[2:29:49] is called up yonder.
[2:29:53] When the roll is called up yonder, I'll
[2:29:57] be there.
[2:29:59] Oh, when the roll
[2:30:02] is called up yonder.
[2:30:05] When the roll
[2:30:07] is called up yonder
[2:30:10] when the roll
[2:30:13] is called up yonder.
[2:30:17] When the roll is called yonder, I'll be
[2:30:21] there.
[2:30:25] Amen. You're dismissed. You'd like to
[2:30:26] go. Well, you have heard of little Moses
[2:30:30] and the Bora.
[2:30:33] You have heard of fearless David and his
[2:30:37] name.
[2:30:39] You have heard the story told of
[2:30:41] dreaming Joseph
[2:30:44] and of Jonah and the well you often
[2:30:47] sing.
[2:30:49] Now there are many, many others in the
[2:30:53] Bible.
[2:30:55] I should like to meet them all. I didn't
[2:30:58] plan.
[2:31:01] By and by, the Lord will surely let us
[2:31:04] meet them at that meeting
[2:31:08] in the air.
[2:31:11] Oh, there is going to be a meeting in
[2:31:16] the air in the sweet by and by.
[2:31:23] I'm going to meet you, reach you open
[2:31:27] air in that home beyond the sky.
[2:31:34] Such singing you will hear. Never heard
[2:31:37] my Lord appear. It'll be glorious, I
[2:31:41] doare.
[2:31:45] And God's own son will be the leading
[2:31:49] one at that meeting in the air.
[2:31:55] And many things will there be missing in
[2:31:59] that meeting.
[2:32:01] For the morning will have no place
[2:32:04] at all.
[2:32:07] There will never be a sermon preached to
[2:32:10] sinners.
[2:32:12] For the sinner had refused to heed the
[2:32:16] call.
[2:32:18] There will be no mourning over wayward
[2:32:21] love.
[2:32:23] There will be no lonely nights of
[2:32:26] pleading prayer.
[2:32:29] All our burdens and our anguish will be
[2:32:32] lifted
[2:32:34] at that meeting and in the air.
[2:32:40] Oh, there is going to be a meeting in
[2:32:44] the air in that sweet
[2:32:48] by and by.
[2:32:51] I am going to meet you, preach you over
[2:32:56] there in that home beyond the sky.
[2:33:02] Oh, such singing you will hear. Never
[2:33:05] heard by dear. It'll be glorious.
[2:33:10] to declare
[2:33:13] and God's own son will be the leading
[2:33:18] one at their meeting in the air
[2:33:24] and there the doubters will be missing
[2:33:27] all together
[2:33:30] all the skeptics will be absent on that
[2:33:33] day
[2:33:35] there will be no crumblers present to
[2:33:38] disturb service
[2:33:41] and the acres will be busy far away.
[2:33:46] There the saints will have his seal upon
[2:33:49] their forehead.
[2:33:51] Dressed in rain and none but ransom ones
[2:33:55] can wear.
[2:33:57] All who have the wedding garments will
[2:34:00] be present
[2:34:03] and beat in the air.
[2:34:08] Oh, there's going to be a meeting in the
[2:34:13] air in the sweet sweet by your
[2:34:18] [Music]
[2:34:20] go to meet you, reach you over there in
[2:34:25] that home beyond the sky.
[2:34:30] Oh, such singing you will hear, never
[2:34:34] heard by mortal near. Oh, it'll be
[2:34:36] glorious in the day.
[2:34:41] And God's son will be the living one as
[2:34:49] in the air.
[2:34:52] Oh, there's going to be
[2:34:56] in the air that sweet
[2:35:00] by and by.
[2:35:03] I'm going to meet you, reach you over
[2:35:08] there in that home beyond the sky.
[2:35:14] Such singing you will hear, never heard
[2:35:18] by mortal ear. It will be glorious, I
[2:35:22] doare.
[2:35:25] And God's own son will be the leading
[2:35:30] one at death
[2:35:33] in the air.
[2:35:35] [Music]
[2:36:07] Hallelujah.
[2:36:12] Hallelujah.
[2:36:18] [Music]
[2:36:31] [Music]
