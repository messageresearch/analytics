all right amen we appreciate apprciate you God bless you uh that'll be good musicians and let's just go ahead and get right into the word tonight Matthew the 26th chapter and so glad to be back and and my how much I enjoyed this past weekend services that testimony that we heard Sunday morning of our brother Billy Paul and then uh brother Armondo I thought did a wonderful job Sunday night and so enjoyed that been feasting on that for this week so far and then had this little thought come upon my heart uh Sunday and I just want to share it with you send you greetings tonight from Brother Israel who was uh um leaving the West uh West Cape heading to Rwanda for his last the last leg of his tour there and so uh I think he might be on a plane even right now heading to Rwanda and y'all just keep praying for him if my math is right he's will have preached up to eight Services while he's been gone so um and it takes a lot out of you to do that so let's just keep the keep uh keep our pastor lifted up in prayer and he asked that we send you his greetings tonight so God bless you Matthew the 26th chapter and the 47th verse we'll read for a little text tonight Matthew 26:47 and when you got that say Amen am amen amen and while he yet spake Lo Judas one of the 12 came and with him a great multitude with swords and staves uh from the chief priests and Elders of the people now he that betrayed him gave them a sign saying whomsoever I shall kiss that same is he hold him fast and for withth he came to Jesus and said hail master and kissed him and Jesus said unto him friend wherefore art thou come then uh then came they and laid hands on Jesus and took him and behold one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand and Drew his sword and struck a servant of the high priest and smote off his ear well that Peter didn't play did he then said Jesus unto him put up thy again thy sword into his place for all they that take the sword Shall Perish with the sword thinkest thou that that I cannot now pray to my father and he shall presently give me more than 12 Legions of angels but how then shall the scripture be fulfilled that thus that thus it must be amen and may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word and let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father we're so grateful to be back in the house of the Lord tonight we're grateful to be assembled with your your children with Believers with the purchase of your blood and Lord we ask oh God tonight that you would break to us the bread of life that you would Lord bless this service bless your people and and Lord bless your word to our hearts we pray and we commit it into your hands I ask you to watch over me and bind my lips before I would speak anything unpleasing to you and we commit it unto thee in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask it amen and amen God bless you you may be seated did and I'll just take a little text tonight on the mirror of God's word the mirror of God's word and I come across this thinking and I believe it might have been brother clever on Sunday maybe Sunday morning and he was singing that song about 10,000 angels He could have called 10,000 angels wasn't it Sunday morning brother John and he could have called 10,000 angels and I began to think about what kind of character what kind of a man our lord Jesus must have been and to know that all power in heaven in Earth was given to him and to know that uh he could have easily called 10,000 angels and he could have easily not gone through the things that he went through but he went through those things for a purpose and there was such a beautiful character in Jesus that that he was able to do the things that should be done not just the things that he wanted to do and it's so striking to me how amazing is the Lord Jesus tonight amen this was not just some other man this was the almighty God tabernacled in the son of man is that right this wasn't just a man like me or you this was God made flesh and dwelling Among Us brother Chuck this was a special man this was a sinless man this was a man full of power and he was the creator of this Earth the Bible said all things were made by him is that right and and so he was the creator of this Earth but yet he was being rejected by his own creation can you think about that tonight Saints what if we went home tonight and and those of you that's got kids what if you went to your house tonight and your children were there and they and they told you Dad or Mom we we don't want you around here anymore you're you're not welcome in this house anymore you're not welcome to be here anymore you can't eat this food in this house anymore and and and and we're not going to listen to you tell us what to do anymore and and and we're actually actually going to punish you for trying to tell us the right things to do we're actually not going to listen to you and we're going to punish you and don't you even open your mouth anymore what if your kids said that to you now you would say you better go check that in mail and see whose address this is cu this house belongs to me and I'm going to do what I want to in this house and you better go look at them receipts and see who it is that bought all that food I bought that food I'm going to eat that food if I want to is that right Saints amen that's you and I but that's not what our Lord did amen he could have called 12 Legions of angels uh but where would we be tonight night if he had have done that where would you and I be if he' had took the easy way out that he could have done but he died for you and me is that the truth tonight Saints that's the gospel truth and there's a quote I don't know who wrote it but it says because we can do a thing does not necessarily mean that we must do that thing because we have the power to do something doesn't mean we must do it is that right and Jesus had all power in Heaven and Earth and he had but he had that beautiful character to know how to handle the power that he had amen and see character is what makes all the difference brother brand said power without character was satanic is that right but we know that the character is what makes a man to where he can handle the power that he's given and you see people that power when they come into power you find many people if they don't have that kind of Godly character that power will change them it'll make them into something that they didn't used to to be if you if you watch sometimes when a man uh is trying to be a police officer and and and you watch certain ones if you find a man that he's not he doesn't have a good character when he gets that badge in his hand it changes him doesn't it amen if you watch what happens to some people when they get promoted and they become a boss if they don't have a good character when they get that Authority it changes them it makes them something that it didn't used to be and I'll tell you uh if if don't have the character it'll make it go to their head if you watch people sometimes if they start to get a little bit of money if they don't have that character that money will change them is that right Saints and money will will change you power will change you Authority will change you but Jesus had this beautiful character that he knew how to handle that power that he had is that right and so we find many times that men can't handle the power that's given to them many men you'll find can't handle the power of being the head of their home even and you find many men if they're weak what they'll do is push off hard decisions that they should be making and they'll push them off on their wife because they have the power to do that and they'll let their wife make the decisions they should be making and then when it goes wrong they can blame their wife for it all right but but they they but many people can't handle being in a position of power or authority because they don't have the character to match the power they've been given and they can let it go to their head they had a saying when I was in retail brother Chuck they said the quickest way to fire somebody was promote them because if they wasn't ready for the promotion then then very soon they would do something to get themselves in trouble and they get fired for it and we saw it happen many many times I would watch people that one like store store of the Year and that store manager would win store of the year and and you'd find it 50% of those store managers wasn't around this time next year because they got to thinking they were something and they started making mistakes so people have to have the right kind of character before they can handle success or authority or money or power amen but the most powerful man that ever lived gave his life for people that did even love him back is that right is that our Lord tonight isn't he marvelous tonight's thing isn't God good to us tonight it's amazing what God did for us today and the most powerful man that ever lived lived for others and this wonderful character that he had he was riled upon but he riled not back they smoted him on the chicken he did nothing back to him yet he had power to lay his life down and he had power to pick it back up again but he let a Roman soldier spit in his face he he he he he endured mocking and shame and he did all of those things and he had the power not to have to do any of it but the character that was in him constrained him now I tell you Saints many people if they had that kind of power if somebody smoked them on their cheek poof they'd be gone is that right Saints but not this man amen because of this great character this great love that was that was for us is what kept Jesus nailed to the cross his great love is what led him to Calvary it wasn't it wasn't that he had to do it no one could make him do anything he had to become obedient to death amen because of the power that was in him and I'll tell you Saints could we allow oursel to be spat upon like him could we love our enemies like he loved can can we turn the other cheek like he turned the other cheek can we live our lives in service for others can can we give without expected return come on somebody see many times people want to do things but only if they'll be recognized for doing it they want to do but they want to be recognized for what they've done amen but the word tells us to do those things in secret and the father that seiz Us in secret will reward us openly but many times people only want to do something for the Lord if somebody else will see them doing something for the Lord and we will'll give them a pat on the back for doing it Saints if somebody Pats you on the back for doing it that was your reward is that right Saints you remember when they stood praying he said verily they have their reward everybody sees them amen but do your arms in secret and the Father which Sees In Secret will reward you openly is that what the gospel says and so we find it some people want to pat on the back and and and the Bible says that if you want recognition you have the reward already but we're laying up Treasures in Heaven Saints amen but this great love is what kept Him nailed to the cross now the Bible said he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not and he came to his own and his own received him not he made the world and he came to it and the world rejected him the very world that he created is that what the gospel say tonight and he had the power to call 10,000 angels but he forfeited that power to do what was right for you and I praise God tonight he gave up that power to do what's right for you and me tonight amen that's the gospel story he forfeited his rights to fulfill the scripture to redeem us he forfeited his rights to save all of us tonight thank you Lord amen he didn't have to do it he did it to save you and me tonight he did it because before the foundation of the world he saw you and he had a Plan of Redemption and he those that you were what kept Him you and I were what kept Him nailed to that cross amen he died for you and me praise God tonight Saints thank the Lord and Philippians the 2 chapter the fifth verse says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man humbled himself and become obedient unto death even the death of the Cross amen Saints if he hadn't committed his Spirit to God he he had never been able to die amen he had to become obedient ience to death for you and I so here's a man who had all power in Heaven and Earth but he never felt the need to make a big name for himself he never felt the need to show off he never felt the need to boss people around but rather he was born in a stable over a manure pile with a swaddling cloth wrapped around him he became a servant to the people he was raised a carpenter son amen is that right Saints and he lived his life for others yet he was so powerful that he had to allow him self to die but he had the power he had that beautiful character to go along with it and that's our example today amen so we might have the right to do something but we forfeit those rights to serve him amen you might have the right by the law to drink or to smoke or do other things but we forfeit those rights Amen to do what's right amen now brother Bram talked about the little boy from Kentucky that went to visit his grandmother and he said he he' never seen a mirror before but on the back side of the door in his grandmother's house he said he saw a mirror and he was kind of Lonesome and he wanted the little boy to play with him so he started walking toward the little boy and and he said he began to look into this glass and he got up close and he turned around he said why mama that's me is that right Saints and he said and that's what we want to look at tonight I want to look uh I want to look at me and I want you to look at yourself and as we look into God's Great mirror of his word let us be able to identify ourselves with some that's gone that we're going to speak about some characters of the other times and I want to see myself in God's looking glass is that your prayer tonight I want to see myself in God's looking glass cuz if anything will show you where you're standing he said it's this book amen he said there's no book like it cuz it's all truth and I don't say that other books are not true but I know this one is true it's all truth because it's the word of God so the prophet says to us to look at ourselves in the mirror of this word right here is that right Saints and he said whatever the word said we should look like that's what we should look like amen so whatever kind of man or woman the word of God says we should be that's what we want to be is that your prayer tonight Saints what whatever the word says I should be that's what I want to be and if the word says I should have joy then I want to have joy and if the word says I should have longsuffering then I want longsuffering and if the word said I should have peace then I want peace amen amen and if the word said I should have love I want love if it says I should have goodness I want goodness if it says I should have gentleness I want gentleness if it says I should have meekness I want meekness if it says I should have oh God if it says I should should have patience I want patience I want to look in the mirror of God's word and look back at myself and see where I measure up tonight amen oh come on somebody tonight and we want to be all that the word says we should be and we should identify oursel he said with the characters of The Bible oh my identification paragraph 116 he says we want to make this Bible our looking glass and let ourselves be molded by his character having his character his mind letting the mind that was in Christ be in us his mind was always his uh what was his mind to do the mind that was in Christ always to stay with the father's word amen no matter what looked glossy and what looked this way it didn't make any difference to him the father's word is what counted everywhere that he met the devil oh I love his Saints not to be just a hearer of the word of God but a doer of the word of God not just to to feel good cuz we heard a tape but to but to feel good because we live the life that's on that tape that's it amen Saints and he never used his power to defeat him talking about the devil he used the word because that was him he was the word amen amen did you ever think he never wrote a book when he was here on Earth as far as we know he never wrote but one time and that was in the sand then he erased it out probably afterwards why didn't he write write a word because he was the word see he lived the word we don't need so many books when you become a written Epistle of God see see that's what God wants you to do images of him amen you know in the Heathen world how the Heathen puts up an idol and they prostrate themselves before the idol and work themselves into such an emotion till they believe that they can hear that Idol speak back to him it's a mental Affair but how vice versa from God's truth God wants you he don't want an idol you are the living image of God and you prostrate yourself before God and he FS you with himself and you express him as a Looking Glass his church that's beautiful Saints and his mind is his word and we become the word as we receive the word is that what the message teaches and so as we receive the word we become that word tonight and we become and as we become the word it's quickened To Us by his Spirit Hallelujah Glory we become then living images of christen amen written Epistles read of all men amen Romans 12:2 says be not conformed but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God Amen that's why we assembled here tonight brother will that's what we come here for it's for the transforming of our mind amen amen oh God identification paragraph 86 he says wonder if we Christians could think that tonight wonder if we can look in God's looking glass or what the requirements is of a Christian and identify ourselves that way I wonder if we could I wonder if we can identify ourselves tonight with John 3:16 and oh all the other kind of scriptures Mark 16th chapter and all these other places that over in Galatians I believe and the different places second Thessalonians where the fruits of the spirit and so forth wonder if we can identify ourself he said so the prophet straightly charges us to examine ourselves by the word of God and to make sure that we can identify that word in our life amen and so as we do when we see things in our life that doesn't measure up to God's word that's where we take that to him he said we prostrate oursel before God and we say God make me a Living Image oh God so many times we hear the word but we must be constantly examining Our Lives to make sure we measure up to God's word amen I was just thinking on this character I wanted I want God's character in me I want to have the character that Christ had I I want to be that kind of a Believer I I don't want to be the kind of believer that's one way one day and another day another day if if you talk to somebody else that maybe doesn't know me from church what kind of person would they say I am am I the same person there that I am here that's what I'm talking about tonight say is that character that reflects through US amen and brother brandom goes on into this great character that Jesus had he had so much power that if he hadn't said the name of Lazareth remember brother Billy Paul's testimony brother it's in the message brother BR said if he hadn't said the name Lazarus all that were in the grave would have come forth that's power Saints if he didn't say if he just said come forth all that were in the grave would have come forth that's power but he was so special because he had the character to know what to do with all that power and he said power apart from character is satanic now brother Brown said in identification in in the 40th uh paragraph he says now Jesus gave us the example of what we ought to be looking at and he says when he reflected his life to us through the word what we should see when when we look into God's mirror we should see ourself identified with him he said that is a perfect example but now but we find out that as we go along through life that our character molds the image that we are each one knows that you as you live so is your character molds to what you are now you've seen people that you just love to be around yet they might not exactly be in your bracket of society and again they might be of A different race the color or the brown or the yellow but there's just something about that character that you just love to be in their presence that's the kind of person we want to be tonight Saints the kind of person that has such a character that people are drawn to us to be in our presence they want to be in our presence that's I know people like that brother Billy Paul was that kind of person that you just wanted to be in his presence you just felt better just looking at him is that right Saints and there's there's a few people that I know like that but that I'm envious of those people that's what I want Saints is that your desire tonight he said he said but there's just something about that character that you love to be in their presence because each person is a little Dynamo of their own and you put out an atmosphere and he said then you see people that were their noble people but yet you always glad to get away from them now that's true too Saints amen it's just they create such an atmosphere around where you are nothing against them they're nice people but you just don't like that atmosphere that they they're they're in and their character creates whatever they are and it makes them what they are now we all know people that when you see them come in the door you tense up a little bit I I mean we all know people I I've been stuck with people before that I wish somebody would have pulled a fire alarm to get me away from them right but Saints I got to thinking about this and I I question myself am I ever the kind of person that produces the kind of atmosphere that somebody can't stand to be around me now I've just had to be honest with myself am I ever that person am I ever the person that somebody's looking to pull the fire alarm to get away from me so Jesus was our example and his character was reflected to us through the word and he said our character molds us into an image the right character molds us into the image of Christ and the wrong character molds us into the image of the world and some people have such a character that we just want to be around them is that what the message teaches we love to be in their presence because we see the image of Christ in their life now I remember years ago when I was a sinner that several people there was some friends of mine at work and different places they would try to talk to me about the Lord and I was such a rank sinner when they would try to talk to me I I I would I'd let them have it I'm ashamed to say I there's no telling what kind of Filth was coming out of my mouth but I did not want to hear anybody talk to me about the Lord I didn't want to hear it it was probably my own condemnation but I didn't want to hear it and I didn't want to hear it from them but one day when I got around bry's grandfather father and and and uh I don't guess nobody here knows him he's gone on to be with the Lord now but he was such a gentle soul he was such a humble man he had such an atmosphere about him brother Josh you know mama you know he had such an atmosphere about him he had such a spirit about him that you just love to be around him and he talked to me about the Lord and I listened because he was such a man I couldn't say nothing negative to him that's the kind of man I want to be tonight amen somebody that can talk to a sinner and get through to them because of the atmosphere that I projected is that right Saints amen and that's why Christ had to Forfeit his rights and become obedient to the death of the Cross his character compelled him to make our place to take our place as the kinsman redeemer he saw the condition that we're in and he knew there was going to be no way that God and man could ever be reconciled is that right Saints and identification he says this this condition that the world is in today it's never it was never it's never the desire of God he didn't mean that at all but when he seen that creation had fallen now his own loving character molded himself into the person of Christ his character molded himself into the person of Christ and God's own character of Love projected himself in the man Christ and as Paul speaking think it not robbery but making himself equal to God rather his own character molded that kind of a person oh no one could ever do that but God this was done so that he could pay the penalty of the fall of his his creation thank the Lord Jesus look at that amazing character he he died so that he could pay a debt that he did not oh amen he paid a penalty for not for himself but for his creation the same creation that that rejected him amen he says uh paragraph 48 identification he says now therefore his loving character of love oh for us it makes plain John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life God projected himself and become a man that he might have upon him the form of his Creation in other words he changed his tent he spread it amongst human beings thank the Lord tonight Saints so how can you and I have the same how can we get this great character that Jesus had well the answer is is we can't you can't have the character Jesus had you you can't develop the character that Jesus had you can't do it but brother Bram said paragraph 58 you cannot no way ever produce a character like that only accepting that character in you a church cannot do that a Creed cannot do that a denomination cannot do that an education cannot do that it must be a birth it's got to be a dying out and let God in by the grace of Christ and mold this type of character in you is that what he said saints that you become him and your life in his is the same then you are Sons and Daughters of God I can't develop that kind of character myself I can only die out to myself and receive his character into me amen so we can never produce the character that Jesus had so we can only be reborn with that character we can only have a new birth to have that character in us and then the old things pass away and then All Things become new and we let the grace of Christ mold his character into each one of us amen so the question isn't how can I develop that character it's how can I die out to myself and receive that character from Christ now brother Brown said in identification 111 he says and now remember after Jesus doing this nobody else could do it nobody else could do it we are invited now Church think of this just a minute we are invited to shape our own character to his by by his grace we are invited think of it to become characters like this if we are ready to lay our character down and the molding that we had heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God false accusers incontinent despisers of those that are trying to do right having a form of godliness and denying the power of the word how can God come into a place like that that's what we were Saints that's what we that's a character we had and then he says but he watches over his word to vindicate it to make it come to pass and the word is pushed out how can he identify himself with something like that we've got to take the entire Full Gospel we must and now being that we have identified ourselves as Full Gospel people let's mold our character we're invited to be molded in His image that we might reflect his presence and the works that I do shall you do also the life that I live so shall you you're invited by God to take him as an example and let our character be molded like his what a thing M amen just a couple more here and then we'll close brother Brown said this and this is in the saman church age let me skip down just a little safe some time now let me read this he says according to Paul he has left this his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection so brother Brown said that that that God has left this church a measure of suffering that while we are suffering we we we will come to a place of perfection through that suffering he says why did he want this James 1 2 and4 said my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing why does he stand by the reason is in Romans 8:17 and 18 and CH and if children then HS Heirs of God and Joint HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us so the Bible said that we might have to suffer a little bit but there's no comparison with The Suffering that we got going on right now there's no comparison with The Joy and the glory that'll be revealed amen he says unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to rain you have to suffer to rain he said the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering is that what the word says character is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcome and is sat down in his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary suffering that we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes aren't you happy about that Saints oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation so so the word teaches us that it's not going to always be easy that there is going to be trials that there is going to be tests that there is going to be tribulation but that all things work together for good to those that love God and are called according to his purpose and that all those things go to build a great character in you and I today is that what the word said saint it's not a victory it's a gift and without it we're not fit to rule because uh we have to endure temporary suffering and we have to overcome as he overcame and we suffer with him so that we can reign with him amen and I'll tell you Saints there ain't going to be no complaining when we get on the other side there ain't going to be no body here upset because of everything we had to go through on this side when we're on the other side it'll all be for it'll all be for the right cause amen there won't be there won't be no tears over there there won't be no complaining about how tough it was over there right amen that's right amen we won't be taking any of this world's Goods with us but we will be taking something with us when we meet the Lord Brother Bram said in the lat s Church age he said we better re be real careful now to see that we take something that will make us right before God oh my amen we better be careful to make sure we take something that'll make us right before God so then what will we take with us we will take our character brother that's what we will take with us now what kind of character will you take with you will it be like his whose character was molded by suffering and the fiery furnace of Affliction or will it be the softness and character of this characterless lot to sin people it's up to each one of us for in that day every man will bear his own burden so he said you're going to take your character with you oh God amen amen let me check my time okay two more quotes and then we'll we'll go to prayer tonight Saints is this all right tonight Saints amen I know everybody's tired it's Wednesday night y'all y'all G yourself up and amen let's get through this last couple of of uh of quotes here in the message I know brother Bram says this about troubles he says and why does God let troubles come he said God harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him amen and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with God amen amen there ain't no prayer like a troubled prayer there ain't no prayer like one when everything's going wrong you never seek God quite like you do when everything's going crazy in your life there's no prayer like a sincere prayer and there's no prayer more sincere than when you're in the depths of Despair that's right when you don't know how you're going to make it through the day when everything is stacked against you that's a sincere prayer amen and God uses that he hardest is that he puts a bent in its mouth and he uses that to bring us into a closer fellowship with him amen amen he uses that to build in this Godly character that Jesus had Hallelujah is that what he does Saints thank the Lord for it tonight amen now we ask God many times in our prayers for comfort and for peace right Amen in the message I know he says this as the musicians come he said there had been no rainbow until the flood came but after Noah was pressed into that condition that he was in to float 40 days and nights in a storm and the little Ark pitching up and down in the water it was after the flood was over that he saw the rainbow for its first time the Covenant of Hope the Covenant of promise and after he had went through the tribulation then he saw the promise after he had went through the tribulation then he saw the promise that's the way you see the Promise after you've gone through the tribulation can you say Amen tonight he said I've liked that poem or Psalm must I be carried home to heaven on a flowy bed of ease While others fought to win the prize and sail through bloody Seas he says we ask listen this Saints we ask for comfort and peace and God gives us the best he could give us trials and tribulations that's better than comfort and peace amen now we might not understand that Saints but that's what the word says tonight we ask God for comfort and peace and he gives us better than comfort and peace he gives us trials and tribulations because it's through those trials and tribulations that we're drawn closer to him and you might be going through trials today you might have tests in your life right now you might be in the middle of a Great Tribulation in your life you might be struggling in your life your family might have needs you might not know where your next where your next uh paychecks coming from you you might not know how you're going to get the rent paid you might not know how you how God's going to deliver you from the trial that you're in you might not know how he's going to bring your family in you might not know how he's going to make it all work out for your good but you can rest assured that the promise said he gives us trials and tribulations and it's better than comfort and peace and it works for our good and it molds us and it makes us in His image and God Will Make A Way tonight God Will Make A Way all things work together for the good of those that love him and are called according to his purpose amen let's just bow our heads father we thank you tonight for this group of Believers we thank you for brothers and sisters with a sincere heart
