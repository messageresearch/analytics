[2:26] Brandon I stopped there today at down
[2:29] Tucson where I live and I was talking to
[2:32] someone up on top of the mountain

[2:37] that 300 years ago the old papy go come
[2:42] down through there on his Travis with
[2:44] his squa and children sitting on the
[2:46] back rode out there somewhere and live
[2:49] peacefully there was no adultery no
[2:53] whiskey uh no gambling no nothing among
[2:57] them they live clean and the coyote come
[3:00] down the the wash each night through
[3:03] Tucson here howling and the mosqu cactus
[3:08] bloomed around on the banks and Jehovah
[3:11] looked up on it and must have
[3:14] smiled
[3:28] but
[3:35] but the white man come that way and what
[3:39] has he done he's du up the
[3:43] cactus he has polluted the country with
[3:47] deer cans and whiskey bottles he's
[3:50] ruined the morals of the nation the only
[3:54] way he could whip the Indian was kill
[3:56] out his food the Buffalo amen when I was
[3:59] was reading at Tombstone the other day
[4:02] in the the museum and saw the pictures
[4:05] of jonal and many of you might think
[4:08] that jonal was a renegade to me he was a
[4:12] genuine
[4:14] American he was only fighting for that
[4:17] which was right that God had give him a
[4:19] land and a nation and a place to live I
[4:23] don't blame him amen and one of those
[4:26] white soldiers come in there and by for
[4:30] taking over the land and killing them
[4:32] out like a bunch of flies and there was
[4:35] the original picture of
[4:37] jono's uh medical headquarters or his uh
[4:42] hospital it was two or three blankets
[4:44] over a piece of mos them wounded real
[4:48] genuine Americans Indians fighting for
[4:51] their god-given rights and there Jona
[4:54] with a baby of his own on the hips
[4:57] standing there looking upon his own
[4:58] Warriors bleeding dying with no
[5:00] penicillin or nothing no way to help
[5:03] them Jan god-given
[5:07] Americans then call him a renegade I
[5:09] call him a
[5:11] gentleman Coes would have never
[5:14] surrendered he was an old man but the
[5:17] American Army them all dressed in there
[5:20] and they went out there and would kill
[5:22] the Buffalo they run excursions out and
[5:25] sharp invented the Buffalo rifle and
[5:28] they went out there and say oh had a
[5:29] good day today shooting off the side of
[5:31] a of a box car or passenger car so I
[5:35] kill 40 today 40 buffaloes which would
[5:38] have kept the whole tribe of indion two
[5:41] years or more what did they do with them
[5:43] let them lay on the desert they all
[5:46] carrying bloated the lands and stunk the
[5:49] lands the coyotes eat when the Indian
[5:53] killed the Buffalo there was a religious
[5:55] ceremony he took his hoofs saved them to
[5:58] make pans
[6:00] his meat they eat even to the meat on
[6:03] the entral they've taken all of his meat
[6:06] and hung it up and drive it get out of
[6:08] here get back out here and do us and our
[6:10] children the way we did those Indians

[6:17] to re amen that's the law of God you
[6:21] know there's a plainy time and then a
[6:24] harvest time I think that uh it's too
[6:28] bad sir now what happened the polluted
[6:33] seed of Adam has polluted and absolutely
[6:37] destroyed the
[6:39] land do you know the Bible says that and
[6:42] because that he has did this the
[6:45] polluted seed of Adam God will destroy
[6:49] them you want to read that I see I got
[6:53] it roll down here turn to Revelations
[6:54] 11th chapter and we'll find
[6:57] out get over in Revelations 11th chapter
[7:00] and we'll see what God said about them
[7:02] who's destroying the
[7:03] Earth the 11th chapter and let's take
[7:06] the 18th verse I believe it is
[7:10] 1118 here we are and the nations were
[7:14] angry and thy wrath is come now watch
[7:19] God's Wrath and the time of the Dead
[7:23] that they should be
[7:25] judged and that thou should us give
[7:27] reward unto thy servants the
[7:31] prophets and to the Saints and to them
[7:35] that fear thy name both small and great
[7:39] and should
[7:40] destroy
[7:42] destroy them which destroy the
[7:48] Earth what they going to do reap what
[7:50] they sow amen sure when you see sin

[8:57] stuff that they do in our Hollywood wood

[9:03] oh my I just think someday someday yeah
[9:08] but remember the Bible has told us in
[9:11] Matthew the 5th chapter that the meek
[9:14] shall inherit the
[9:17] earth that's right the meek and humble
[9:21] will inherit the earth Hallelujah Jesus
[9:24] said blessed are the meek the simple
[9:29] ones and just don't try to be some great
[9:32] big something they shall inherit the
[9:35] earth Jesus said so yes now they
[9:40] polluted it and God will destroy them
[9:43] but the meat will inherit the earth
[9:46] after it's been purified now oh my now
[9:52] the forfeited title deed is now in the
[9:57] hands of the original owner
[9:59] oh mighty God
[10:03] Amen the Mighty God
[10:08] Amen the title deed to the Earth and to
[10:13] eternal life when Adam fared it then
[10:18] Satan's dirty hands cannot take
[10:22] it so it went back to its original owner
[10:27] God himself we're going to find just a
[10:29] minute there he sits on the throne with
[10:30] it in his
[10:31] hand Hallelujah the
[10:36] tile oh that makes me feel
[10:39] religious the title deed to eternal life
[10:44] abstract titled e the eternal life when
[10:48] Adam forfeited for wisdom and instead of
[10:51] faith it went back to the hands of the
[10:54] owner
[10:56] ohmighty God what a great thing all
[11:01] right waiting what's it doing in the
[11:04] hands of God waiting for Redemption
[11:10] claims he made a way of
[11:13] redemption he made a way back and
[11:17] someday the Redeemer is to take it
[11:21] back you see where we're getting to now
[11:23] well once this fell sitting up on the
[11:26] throne all
[11:27] right
[11:29] waiting for Redemption
[11:34] claims it's Redemption what is this book
[11:38] of redemption this title
[11:42] deed Abstract title deed you say
[11:46] abstract what does an abstract mean
[11:49] means it's searched all the way back to
[11:52] its beginning like that little like that
[11:55] little drop of ink this morning when he
[11:58] struck that bleach it went all the way
[12:01] back and when sin has been confessed and
[12:07] fallen into the blood of Jesus Christ oh
[12:12] my it gives an abstract right straight
[12:15] back to the Creator again you become a
[12:19] Son of
[12:20] God Abstract title deed is held in the
[12:25] hands of the almighty oh my
[12:30] its
[12:31] Redemption means all legal possession to
[12:36] all that was lost by Adam and
[12:40] Eve what ought that to do to born again
[12:44] Christian it's legal
[12:48] possession to that abstract deed titled
[12:51] deed of eternal life
[12:55] means that you possess
[12:59] everything that Adam and Eve
[13:03] [Applause]
[13:04] lost what it
[13:08] hallelu
[13:10] Hallelujah the possession of that
[13:13] deed Adam could not meet the
[13:16] requirements of redemption after you
[13:18] found he lost it he had sinned and he
[13:20] separated himself from God was on this
[13:22] side of the CM so he could not uh redeem
[13:25] it he just couldn't do it because he was
[13:27] he needed Redemption himself so he could
[13:30] not do it but the law required a kinsman
[13:37] redeemer the law of God required a
[13:39] kinsman redeemer you want to mark that
[13:42] down kinsman redeemer find it in
[13:44] Leviticus 25 we won't have time to
[13:47] thoroughly search this because you know
[13:49] each each text would make a a
[13:52] night but God's
[13:55] law received a substitute now what if
[13:59] God had not offered to take a
[14:02] subtitute but love constrained him to do
[14:06] it that man was out of way back and
[14:10] there's no way for him to get back he
[14:13] was
[14:15] gone but the grace of
[14:18] God met this kinsman redeemer in the
[14:22] person of Jesus
[14:26] Christ law required it Grace made
[14:32] requirements
[14:34] oh how sweet sound hallelujah hallelujah
[14:38] God's law required an innocent
[14:42] substitute in who was
[14:44] innocent every man had been born
[14:47] sexual after sex
[14:51] everyone and the only one that wasn't
[14:54] had forfeited the rights to eternal life
[14:57] and to be king on the Earth
[15:00] hallu oh think of that scripture for
[15:02] thou has has redeemed us back to God
[15:06] that we may Reign and be Kings and
[15:09] Priests upon the earth oh my what the
[15:13] kinsman
[15:14] [Music]
[15:16] redeemer oh what a story we would have
[15:19] here notice law required a kinsman
[15:24] redeemer to redeem a lost substance
[15:28] Grace met this requirement in the person
[15:32] of Jesus Christ a Kinsman must be born
[15:38] of the human race
[15:43] amen now how could we be when every man
[15:49] that's born has to and anybody couldn't
[15:51] see it was a sex act there he's totally
[15:55] blind CU every man that was born was
[15:58] borned of a
[16:00] woman and God required a kinsman
[16:03] redeemer and he must be a
[16:08] human oh my what he going to do now law
[16:12] required a kinsman
[16:15] redeemer I couldn't take an angel you
[16:18] had to have a man because we're not kin
[16:20] to the angel we're kin to one
[16:23] another the angel never fail he's a
[16:27] different kind of being got a different
[16:28] body he never Sinn or nothing he's a
[16:31] different but the law required a kinsman
[16:35] redeemer and every man on Earth was born
[16:39] of a
[16:41] sex I know what you see that's where it
[16:43] come from that's where sin
[16:46] started amen so you see where it's at
[16:49] now there comes your seat of the serpent
[16:53] in now
[16:57] notice require are a kinsman redeemer
[17:00] and the
[17:02] Redeemer kinsman redeemer must be borned
[17:06] of the human
[17:08] race here that leaves us on a limb but
[17:12] let me sound the trumpet to you the
[17:14] Virgin birth produced the the
[17:20] product the Virgin birth produced our
[17:23] kinsman redeemer none other but the
[17:27] almighty God become
[17:30] [Applause]
[17:32] Emmanuel
[17:34] Emmanuel the kinsman redeemer was met
[17:38] you see how God makes a requirement and
[17:41] there's nothing we can do but then Grace
[17:44] steps in and overshadows that law and
[17:46] produces the
[17:49] product Oh when you get over home when I
[17:52] get my little cabin down there brother
[17:54] nille sings about when you all hear
[17:56] something down there one morning sing
[17:58] amazing in Grace How Sweet the Sound the
[17:59] saved the r like me you say praise God
[18:02] old brother Brandon made it there he
[18:05] is yes hallelujah oh it's Grace that
[18:09] taught my heart to it was Grace my fears
[18:13] relieved how precious did that Grace
[18:16] appear they are our first believe wait
[18:18] till we get down to it just in a moment
[18:21] oh my now we look the The Book of Ruth
[18:25] gives a beautiful picture of this how
[18:28] boy has and neom had lost his State you
[18:31] you know you hear me preach on having
[18:32] you raise your hands up if you heard me
[18:34] preach it so you understand see ohaz had
[18:37] to become a redeemer and he was the only
[18:40] one that could he had to be a Kinsman a
[18:42] near Kinsman in redeeming Nom he got
[18:45] Ruth that was
[18:48] Jesus Boaz typing Christ and when he
[18:51] redeem Israel he got the Gentile bride
[18:55] with SE so very beautiful well we have
[18:59] it on tape I'm sure here somewhere you
[19:01] like to have it now
[19:04] notice now he must be kinman so you see
[19:07] an angel couldn't do it a man couldn't
[19:09] do it it must be a man but he can't be
[19:12] born of a woman a sex act so the Virgin
[19:15] birth the Holy Spirit overshadowed Mary
[19:18] therefore Jesus was not a Jew Jesus was
[19:21] not a gentile Jesus was
[19:23] God exactly his blood didn't come from
[19:27] any sex act amen he was the Holy created
[19:31] blood of God and we're not saved by
[19:34] Jewish blood neither are we saved by
[19:35] Gentile blood we're saved by the blood
[19:38] of God that's according to the Bible it
[19:40] says so we're saved by so you see Jesus
[19:43] was God he was not no third person
[19:46] fourth person second person he was the
[19:48] person he was God see he was God
[19:53] Emmanuel God come down from his glory
[19:59] revealed himself I love that story of
[20:03] boo cver that great beautiful hm down
[20:07] from his glory ever living story my God
[20:12] and savior came and Jesus was his name
[20:17] born in a manger to his own a stranger a
[20:21] man of sorrow tears and Agony oh what
[20:26] condensation W he house Redemption when
[20:29] in the dead of night not one faint hope
[20:34] in sight God precious tender laid aside
[20:38] his Splendor stooping to woo and save my
[20:43] soul oh how I love him how I adore him
[20:49] my breath my sunshine my all and all the
[20:53] great Redeemer became my savior the
[20:57] great creator became my savior and all
[21:00] God's fullness dwelleth in him that's
[21:04] the one met the requirement Grace
[21:07] produced the person of Jesus Christ and
[21:12] we find this book now
[21:14] God stretched his tent come from God to
[21:18] become a man he changed his stream from
[21:23] the almighty to be a man to take on the
[21:26] form of man so he could die to redeem
[21:29] man wait till we see him when there's

[50:16] instead of sometimes arguing things over
[50:18] and if you project love God can come on
[50:21] the scene and take care of the situation
[50:23] for you so I thought of this song 10,000
[50:27] angels and uh I hope it's a blessing to
[50:30] [Music]
[50:40] you they bound the hands of
[50:45] Jesus in the garden where he

[51:06] savior so pure and free from
[51:11] sin they said crucify
[51:14] him
[51:17] he to
[51:22] bless he could have called
[51:29] 10,000
[51:32] angels to destroy the
[51:37] world and set him
[51:43] free he could have
[51:48] called

[52:11] head they placed a crown of
[52:16] thorns they left and said
[52:21] behold the
[52:24] king
[52:27] they struck him and they cursed him and
[52:32] mocked His holy

[1:06:03] it's a YouTube thing we didn't have time
[1:06:06] to try to download something where we
[1:06:08] could just play it separately so it's a
[1:06:11] YouTube clip and uh I believe you'd be
[1:06:14] blessed but it might pop up in ad if if
[1:06:17] there is we'll mute it play through it

[1:20:13] yes when I was just a young
[1:20:16] boy I started traveling with my dad now
[1:20:19] I'm going to get into the
[1:20:21] testimony and I'm going try my best to
[1:20:23] be done here in three
[1:20:25] hours but as I begin the travel my dad
[1:20:28] would tell me just like you hear the
[1:20:30] tapes and you hear your mother and dad
[1:20:32] tell you different things but until you
[1:20:39] have until you have a personal
[1:20:41] experience with Jesus Christ it's just
[1:20:44] words
[1:20:45] yes you've got to be borned
[1:20:49] again when I was 12 years old how old
[1:20:52] are you
[1:20:56] Luke eight I was a little bit older than
[1:20:58] Luke probably not as big but I was but
[1:21:02] anyway my dad I'd hear him talk about
[1:21:04] the
[1:21:05] angel and I love to tell this part of my
[1:21:08] testimony and I know every one of you
[1:21:10] heard it but I'm just going to tell it
[1:21:11] to you
[1:21:13] again I'd hear my
[1:21:15] date talk about the
[1:21:17] angel and brother bam not only preached
[1:21:20] your a message but he lived your a
[1:21:22] message
[1:21:23] he was a poor man he wasn't rich man no
[1:21:28] he wasn't a rich man at
[1:21:30] all and he'd stay in the cheapest of
[1:21:34] Hotel he'd eat less food and have us to
[1:21:39] so it wouldn't be hard on you for the
[1:21:42] expenses of the meetings he not only
[1:21:44] preached your message but he lived your
[1:21:47] message we stay in this little hotel in
[1:21:50] velia
[1:21:51] Illinois and I was about 12 years
[1:21:55] old and he woke me up one morning and I
[1:21:59] I wasn't giving out prayer cards in I
[1:22:00] was just a little bit long bigger than
[1:22:02] Luke there but I was selling three
[1:22:05] little books one was called I was not
[1:22:07] disobedient to heavenly
[1:22:10] vision Divine Healing in the brandom
[1:22:12] campaigns Jesus Christ the same
[1:22:14] yesterday today and forever I had a
[1:22:16] little nail
[1:22:18] apron I'd have it around me had nickels
[1:22:21] dimes and quarters and there I thought I
[1:22:23] was something and I'd go down and I'd
[1:22:26] give you you sell you books before the
[1:22:28] meeting start and the tent
[1:22:30] meetings when I come home that night my
[1:22:33] dad was sleeping in a bed right here I
[1:22:36] was next to my dad and my uncle Donnie
[1:22:40] was in the bed next to me was all in the
[1:22:43] same bed never even had a bathroom in
[1:22:47] the hotel room we had to go down the
[1:22:49] hall to use a bathroom and over on a
[1:22:51] corner in the about back by the window
[1:22:54] there was a table and I don't know if
[1:22:56] you know what I'm talking about it it
[1:22:57] had Lis what you call them things you
[1:22:59] pour the picture you know picture water
[1:23:01] and things that's where we
[1:23:03] wash Daddy he said he had a pillow
[1:23:07] across my
[1:23:08] face and he said Paul I said yes sir he
[1:23:13] said you know the angel that Daddy talks
[1:23:15] about I said yes he said he's
[1:23:21] here he said he's in the room right now
[1:23:24] and he said he visited me tonight and
[1:23:26] told me about the meetings what to do he
[1:23:29] said I ask him if I could wake you and
[1:23:33] my uncle up
[1:23:34] Donnie and he said you can wake up
[1:23:38] Billy that don't make me no more than
[1:23:41] you or anybody else but it was just what
[1:23:43] the grace of God to me he said you can
[1:23:45] wake up Billy he said I want him to see
[1:23:51] you
[1:23:54] he said when Daddy takes the pillow from
[1:23:55] your
[1:23:57] eyes he said you look over where that
[1:23:59] war spacing is and there stands the
[1:24:02] angel that I told you
[1:24:05] about well I thought it'd be something
[1:24:08] you know that you see pictures of you
[1:24:10] know
[1:24:11] flying it was a man dressed in a white
[1:24:15] Rob had hair down to his
[1:24:18] shoulders 200 lb or so he had his arms
[1:24:21] folded like that
[1:24:22] and all he do would just move his head
[1:24:25] back and forth and keep his eye on Daddy
[1:24:27] it scared me to death you say it
[1:24:30] wouldn't scare me you just haven't seen
[1:24:34] you there was a reverence I can't tell
[1:24:36] you about but he says he sent from the
[1:24:40] presence of God and I grabbed my daddy I
[1:24:43] was scared to death he said Paul he
[1:24:44] won't harm you he said I asked him if he
[1:24:48] could see you he never spoke a word to
[1:24:51] me or today Daddy but I'll never forget
[1:24:54] his eyes just looking back and forth at
[1:24:56] Daddy back and forth and I held on to my
[1:25:00] daddy and he clutched me up and he went
[1:25:02] from that being like a man in that room
[1:25:06] out that window before he went he just
[1:25:09] went into like a Mist like a vapor and
[1:25:13] he disappeared out the window and when
[1:25:16] he left a rainbow at 3:00 in the morning
[1:25:20] come and stood in that room from that
[1:25:23] day to this day I can tell you when he's
[1:25:26] there I might have been in Africa India
[1:25:29] anywhere I'd be Daddy call the prayer

[1:30:36] walked in just walk in the auditorium
[1:30:41] and I'd have him by the arm leading him
[1:30:43] in I seen people just stand up out of
[1:30:46] the
[1:30:48] wheelchairs push the wheelchairs back I
[1:30:51] see them come off the Cs I've seen
[1:30:54] mothers pass their

[1:31:00] thousands of
[1:31:02] people just to get him to touch that
[1:31:05] baby am not even knowing if they'd get
[1:31:07] that baby back but they knew that God
[1:31:11] was in that man am so do you know that
[1:31:15] God was in that
[1:31:17] man I saw the
[1:31:20] Redeemer live Liv in a redeemed
[1:31:23] one I don't worship him but I glorify
[1:31:27] the God that was
[1:31:28] in I may not understand it but I believe
[1:31:31] it and I don't
[1:31:33] compromise I'm not want to be no smile
[1:31:35] like but I don't compromise on nothing
[1:31:37] to do that my job was to pass out prayer
[1:31:41] cards to get him in and out of the
[1:31:44] meeting what a privilege you say oh I
[1:31:48] wished I had no you don't want that job
[1:31:50] no it was was a wonderful job I don't
[1:31:52] mean
[1:31:54] that I see him in the prayer line he'd
[1:31:57] always bring the people from this side
[1:32:00] and I'd bring the people up and set them
[1:32:01] in a
[1:32:02] chair and he'd say watch
[1:32:05] me watch me and I see him he' go like
[1:32:09] this you seen him on the film and I knew
[1:32:13] then he was getting numb he didn't know
[1:32:15] what he was where he was at and I'd have
[1:32:18] the prayer line well I'd stop the prayer
[1:32:20] line cuz I knew it was time to go get
[1:32:22] him and I'll tell you some testimonies
[1:32:24] that I
[1:32:25] saw but I'm talking about my job now
[1:32:30] okay my job was to get him in and out to
[1:32:33] get you up there to be prayed
[1:32:35] for just to stand before
[1:32:38] him and I've seen him I se him start
[1:32:41] doing this be getting a little weak and
[1:32:44] I'd stop the prayer line and he knew
[1:32:47] when he didn't see no one in that chair
[1:32:50] he might not even see me but when no one
[1:32:52] was in that chair then he knew it was
[1:32:54] time to to quit because sometimes didn't
[1:32:57] know worri is at and I'd leave and come
[1:32:59] over and I touch him on his side put my
[1:33:02] arms around him what
[1:33:05] privileg that anointing was so
[1:33:07] strong it didn't make any difference if
[1:33:10] I had a headache a
[1:33:13] toothache in that presence everything
[1:33:16] left
[1:33:18] amen and I touch him on his side like
[1:33:21] his brother
[1:33:23] Paul and if he was talking to you maybe
[1:33:26] calling people out in the audience and I
[1:33:28] touch him like that if he didn't answer
[1:33:31] me back I'd pick him up and take him off
[1:33:33] the
[1:33:34] platform but he sometimes he'd touch me
[1:33:37] back the people didn't know but he'd be
[1:33:40] saying Paul leave me alone I know what
[1:33:43] I'm doing yeah then he'd make an ALT to
[1:33:46] call whatever you say well that's no
[1:33:48] it's not because one time time I take
[1:33:52] him out too
[1:33:54] early I thought it was time to take
[1:33:57] him I thought I was doing my job
[1:34:00] right and I take him too quick and he'd
[1:34:03] say Paul if you just left me a little
[1:34:05] longer I could have prayed for some more
[1:34:08] oh as a kid 14 years
[1:34:12] old so I took him too quick then maybe
[1:34:15] the next night I take him too
[1:34:18] early next night I take let him stay too
[1:34:23] long then he said Paul you let me stay
[1:34:26] too long he said don't give my prayer CS
[1:34:29] tomorrow night because I don't have
[1:34:30] strength to pray for the
[1:34:34] people don't feel sorry for me but it's
[1:34:36] a hard life yeah it was a wonderful
[1:34:42] life I said Daddy why why did the Lord

[2:25:28] in Christ Jesus amen we are perfected
[2:25:31] with our
[2:25:32] sacrifice thank you Lord he
[2:25:37] makes no

[2:34:48] brother Chuck calls me up to pray at the
[2:34:50] end I guess I'll say it but the uh the
[2:34:54] day brother really passed my dad called
[2:34:57] me up at 6 o00 in the morning tells me a
[2:34:59] little testimony and I'll share that
[2:35:02] with you here uh now but my dad had just
[2:35:06] started
[2:35:07] preaching and had some really good
[2:35:10] services and was feeling really good
[2:35:13] about himself you know and
[2:35:17] you know had some really really really
[2:35:18] just special services there and um even
[2:35:21] I think probably at the tuon Tabernacle
[2:35:23] as well and so he got a little you know
[2:35:25] full of Pride he said and and then he
[2:35:28] preached some more sermons after that
[2:35:30] and he just said it was just you know
[2:35:31] you could hear a pin drop sometimes
[2:35:33] there's no amens and this that and it
[2:35:36] like I said this is at the beginning of
[2:35:37] his ministry so kind of Hur his
[2:35:40] confidence and he was feeling pretty
[2:35:42] pretty down
[2:35:44] and he uh brother Gustavo was a pastor
[2:35:48] there in no
[2:35:49] Galis and he had asked
[2:35:51] him to come back you know even after
[2:35:54] those services that maybe didn't go
[2:35:56] weren't as exciting
[2:35:58] or and uh my dad kept putting it off
[2:36:01] kept putting it off and brother Gustavo
[2:36:03] would ask him you know can you come now
[2:36:05] can you come now and he put him off for
[2:36:06] about three or four weeks dad said
[2:36:09] and finally dad just said okay you know

[2:36:13] so we go this you know that that one
[2:36:16] weekend we end up going to Nogales son
[2:36:19] there to preach and um Dad says you know

[2:37:30] prayed up in that back office you know
[2:37:32] he was and he he just he said he
[2:37:35] remembered like as he before he walked
