[3:56] Good evening. God bless you all. It's so
[3:58] good to see everyone this evening. like
[4:00] to welcome you all out to the house of
[4:02] the Lord. Like to ask if uh Uncle John
[4:05] could you come open the service up with
[4:06] a word of
[4:12] [Music]
[4:15] prayer. Let's bow our heads this
[4:17] evening. Thank you Lord for another
[4:19] opportunity to come into your house,
[4:21] worship you, lift up your name this
[4:22] evening.
[4:24] Lord, just thinking before the service,
[4:27] faith comes by hearing, hearing by the
[4:29] word of the Lord. So Lord, we come here
[4:32] tonight to have our faith
[4:34] increased. Lord, just that we can draw
[4:36] closer to you and may your word just
[4:38] take hold in our lives, Lord, that
[4:39] becomes a reality to us and not just
[4:42] words on paper, not
[4:44] just words that we've heard preached,
[4:46] but Lord, it sinks into our heart and
[4:49] and Lord, we just want to yield
[4:50] ourselves to you. Forgive us for for our
[4:53] unbelief, Lord. And we just ask, Lord,
[4:55] if there's anything in our lives that we
[4:58] haven't confessed, Lord, just bring it
[4:59] to our our memory, Lord, we just want to
[5:03] be clean before you this evening. And
[5:06] Lord, as
[5:09] we worship you and sing songs of praise
[5:13] and worship this evening, just ask Lord,
[5:15] just as when David played his harp and
[5:18] it drove the evil spirits away from
[5:20] Saul, Lord, that the worship and the
[5:23] playing would drive any unbelief out of
[5:26] this building tonight and out of our
[5:27] hearts, Lord Jesus. And we just want to
[5:30] redeem the time that you've given us
[5:32] this evening to draw closer to you. we
[5:34] commit it to your hands. We ask in
[5:35] Jesus' name.
[5:39] Amen. You know, there's a lot of times
[5:43] this week and this month where, you
[5:45] know, it's easy for me to like want to
[5:47] rush the Lord and not, you know, be
[5:50] patient and wait on him. But, you know,
[5:52] my prayer today and this week has just
[5:55] been, Lord, just have your will in my
[5:58] life. And I just want to just no matter
[6:01] how long it takes, I want to wait on
[6:02] your time. So let's sing about that and

[18:49] [Music]
[18:52] wounded and

[20:04] Absolute
[20:09] sway. Fill with thy
[20:17] spirit till all shall see.
[20:26] Christ
[20:28] [Music]
[20:33] only
[20:36] living in
[20:39] me. Amen. That's my prayer. As we
[20:43] prepare to change the order of the
[20:44] service, let's all stand and go to the
[20:47] key of C.
[20:52] In
[20:53] moments like
[20:56] these, I sing out a
[21:01] song. I sing out a love song to Jesus.
[21:13] In
[21:14] moments like
[21:17] these, I lift up my
[21:23] hands. I lift up my hands to the Lord.
[21:34] Singing
[21:37] high
[21:38] love you
[21:43] Lord.
[21:44] Singing
[21:47] I
[21:49] love you Lord.
[21:55] singing.
[21:57] I
[22:00] love
[22:03] you,
[22:05] Lord.
[22:08] I
[22:11] love
[22:15] you. In
[22:18] moments like
[22:21] these, sing out a
[22:26] song. I sing
[22:29] out a love song to
[22:37] Jesus in
[22:39] moments time. And we lift our hands. I
[22:43] lift
[22:45] up my
[22:48] hands. Lift
[22:50] up my hands to the
[22:57] Lord.
[22:58] Singing
[23:01] out I
[23:03] love you
[23:06] Lord. Hallelujah.
[23:09] singing.
[23:12] I
[23:13] love you,
[23:17] Lord. Amen.
[23:19] Say,
[23:22] "I
[23:25] love
[23:27] you,
[23:29] Lord. Lord,
[23:33] I
[23:36] love you.
[23:38] Amen. Praise the Lord, saints. So good
[23:40] to be in the house of the Lord. Tonight,
[23:43] we're going to hear the word of the Lord
[23:45] as we're going into the adoption series
[23:48] again, the church being placed by the
[23:52] teaching of the word. It's found in
[23:54] Ephesians chapter 1 if you'd like to
[23:56] turn
[23:57] there. And I know it'll be a blessing to
[24:00] you. Trust the Lord Jesus has blessed
[24:04] everyone tonight. and we come expecting
[24:07] to feed on the good things of God.
[24:10] There's always something good that he
[24:12] has for us and
[24:16] um we come expecting to hear from him.
[24:20] Ephesians chapter 1 as brother Vanom
[24:23] takes this old this New Testament book
[24:27] and he compares it against the
[24:29] Corinthians and he said the Corinthians
[24:31] were believers but they were immature
[24:34] believers. But he said that the
[24:37] Ephesians typed the book of
[24:40] Joshua, which those were the Hebrews or
[24:42] the Jews that have come out of Egypt.
[24:45] They come through the promised land and
[24:47] now they were conquering and taking over
[24:51] in Canaan land. And that types the true
[24:54] believer of our day. And so we'd like to
[24:58] read in Ephesians chapter 1 verse number
[25:01] three. Blessed be the God and Father of
[25:03] our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed
[25:06] us with all spiritual blessings in
[25:09] heavenly places in Christ, according as
[25:14] he hath chosen us in him before the
[25:18] foundation of the world, that which that
[25:21] we should be holy and without blame
[25:24] before him in love, having predestinated
[25:29] us unto the adoption ion of children by
[25:33] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[25:36] good pleasure of his will. Amen. That's
[25:39] a mouthful there. He called us in him
[25:43] before the world began. And I was raised
[25:46] in church my whole life and we never we
[25:49] read those scriptures. We never went
[25:51] into it. I never understood what
[25:54] predestination was. And here those
[25:56] scriptures are telling us that God chose
[25:59] us before the world began.
[26:01] That's so beautiful. So, let's go to the
[26:03] word tonight and hear what the prophet
[26:06] is going to say to us. Paragraph, I
[26:08] think 67 through 110. Right there, we're
[26:11] breaking it in three parts. This is part
[26:13] two out of three parts. So, God bless
[26:16] you. Let's sing Only
[26:19] Believe. Singing
[26:22] Only Believe.
[26:25] [Music]
[26:31] Believe that all things are
[26:37] possible.
[26:39] Only
[26:43] believe.
[26:44] Only
[26:48] believe.
[26:50] Only believe.
[26:53] [Music]
[26:55] All things are
[26:59] possible
[27:01] only. Can we sing Lord I believe. Let's
[27:04] lift our hands and confess. Lord I
[27:10] believe.
[27:12] Lord I
[27:15] believe that all things are possible.
[27:23] Lord, I
[27:27] believe. Oh Lord, that I
[27:32] believe. Oh
[27:35] Lord, I
[27:38] believe that all things are
[27:44] possible. Lord, I believe. God bless.
[27:50] You may be seated, Brother Brandham.
[27:59] How many's received the promise of the
[28:00] Holy Ghost? Aren't you glad that you're
[28:04] in the land? Amen. Over here now, eating
[28:07] the old corn,
[28:09] eating the strong things of God, got a
[28:12] clear understanding. Your your spiritual
[28:15] mind is all unmuddled up. You know
[28:19] exactly who he is. says, "You know
[28:21] exactly what he is. You know exactly
[28:23] where you're going. You know exactly all
[28:26] about it. You know in whom you have
[28:29] believed and persuaded he's able to keep
[28:30] that which you've committed to him
[28:32] against the day." Oh, that's the one.
[28:36] That's who Paul's talking to. Now listen
[28:40] close. Now watch. The faithful in Christ
[28:45] Jesus. Now let me have the church to
[28:47] repeat that. How do we get into Christ?
[28:51] By joining
[28:52] church?
[28:54] No. By putting our name on a book? No.
[28:59] By being baptized by immersing? No. How
[29:03] do we get into Christ? By one Holy
[29:08] Spirit. Amen. Are we all baptized into
[29:14] one promise, the body? Amen. and are
[29:18] partakers of all that belongs into the
[29:22] land. Amen.
[29:24] Amen.
[29:26] Oh, I I like that. If it wasn't a horse,
[29:28] I could shout.
[29:33] When I get in this land, it's mine. I'm
[29:36] home now. I'm in Canaan. Amen. I'm
[29:39] subject to anything God wants to use me
[29:42] for. I'm walking on holy ground.
[29:45] Hallelujah. A child of the king. Amen.
[29:50] All rope and ready.
[29:52] I've come out of Egypt, come up to the
[29:54] promised land. Stood the trials passed
[29:56] over Jordan into this blessed promise.
[29:59] Hallelujah. Oh, how did I get it? By one
[30:03] spirit.
[30:05] The same way Paul got it. Acted on me
[30:09] the same way it did on him. Same way it
[30:11] did on you. Amen. By one spirit we are
[30:16] all baptized.
[30:18] Hallelujah. Not sprinkled, just a little
[30:22] sprinkle of it feel pretty good, but
[30:24] immersed under. Praise God. Oh, make the
[30:29] swim under and the Holy Ghost.
[30:34] That's the
[30:35] promise. are
[30:39] Ephesians are Joshua which is the Holy
[30:44] Spirit. Joshua means Jesus savior.
[30:48] Joshua meaning the Holy Spirit
[30:50] representing it in the spiritual as that
[30:52] was in the natural that he is our great
[30:57] warrior. Amen. He's our great
[31:01] leader. As God was with Joshua, so is
[31:06] God in the Holy Spirit moving us about.
[31:10] And when sin comes in the camp, the Holy
[31:12] Spirit demands a halt.
[31:15] Amen. What's wrong here in this church?
[31:18] Something's
[31:19] wrong. Oh, can't you see how we got too
[31:22] many sons of Kishna?
[31:25] Too many Sauls
[31:28] coming from seminaries and theological
[31:30] schools and going out and teaching this
[31:33] perverse things as the Bible said they
[31:35] would do. Seemingly not having the
[31:38] faith, separating themselves from you,
[31:40] having no fellowship with you, so forth,
[31:44] having a form of godliness and denying
[31:46] the power thereof from such turn away.
[31:50] [Applause]
[31:51] They don't know where they come from.
[31:53] They can't give any
[31:54] reason. I say this from brother Booth
[31:57] Clifford and a friend of mine. If
[31:59] there's anything that's a ill,
[32:03] illegitimate, un God created anything in
[32:07] the world is a
[32:08] mule. A mule is the lowest of all
[32:12] things. He is a He don't know what he
[32:17] is. He cannot produce himself no more.
[32:21] A mule cannot be bred to another mule
[32:25] and become a mule. He's finished. He
[32:29] don't know where his papa come from.
[32:31] Neither does he know his
[32:33] mama. For he is a little a little donkey
[32:37] and a mare horse. God never did that.
[32:41] Don't you lay such as that onto God.
[32:45] God never done that. God said everything
[32:46] shall bring forth of its kind.
[32:50] Amen. Yes sir. But a mule is a um his
[32:56] papa was a donkey and his mama was a
[32:59] maror. So he don't know what he does
[33:02] belong to. He he he's a horse trying to
[33:04] be a mule or a mule or he's a horse
[33:06] trying to be a donkey. A donkey trying
[33:07] to be a horse. He don't know where he
[33:08] does
[33:09] belong. And he is a hardheadedest thing
[33:12] there is in the world.
[33:15] You can never put a bit of trust to him.
[33:18] And that's the way a lot of people are
[33:19] in church. That's right. They don't know
[33:22] who their papa is. They don't know who
[33:24] their mama is. Only thing they know,
[33:25] they're either Presbyterian, Methodist,
[33:27] Baptist, or Pentecostal or something.
[33:30] They don't know where they come from.
[33:34] And an old donkey, you can just holler
[33:36] at him as much as you want to holler at
[33:37] him. He'll stand there and stick them
[33:39] big ears out and look.
[33:41] You can preach to them all night long
[33:43] and they don't know a bit more when they
[33:45] left than what they did when they come
[33:46] in. Amen.
[33:49] Now, that's just right.
[33:51] I don't mean to be rude, but I want to
[33:54] tell you the truth. Amen. But there's
[33:57] one thing they can do. They're good
[34:00] workers. Oh, they just work, work, work,
[34:04] work. That puts me in the mind of a
[34:06] bunch of these Armenians that's always
[34:08] trying to work their way into heaven.
[34:10] That's right. A mule.
[34:12] All the ladies aid society and this
[34:15] chicken supper for the pay the preacher
[34:16] and we got to have this dance and this
[34:18] social. It's just work work work work
[34:21] work and they what are they working for?
[34:24] Ask them have you receive the Holy Ghost
[34:26] since you believe they stick out their
[34:29] ears and don't know where they belong.
[34:32] What do you
[34:34] mean? What did all this? What do you
[34:36] mean the Holy Ghost? I don't ever heard
[34:38] nothing about it. Oh, you must be some
[34:41] kind of fanatic. See, they don't know
[34:43] who Papa was or who mama was either.
[34:47] And you have to beat them on everything
[34:49] you do. Beat here and beat there and
[34:51] beat here and beat there. That's right.
[34:54] An old mule.
[34:56] But I tell you, you don't have to do
[34:59] that by a real thoroughbreed
[35:01] horse. Just crack the whip over him one
[35:04] time and brother, he's gone.
[35:07] He knows what he's doing. Oh, how fine
[35:10] it is to ride a thorbread.
[35:13] How nice is it? Come on, boy. Oh, man.
[35:17] You better hold tight. You'll leave the
[35:19] saddle in the
[35:21] air. That's the way it is with real
[35:24] thoroughb breaded Christians.
[35:27] Hallelujah.
[35:31] Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Amen. Repeat,
[35:34] everyone of you, be baptized in the name
[35:36] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[35:37] your sins. Gone.
[35:40] Just as quick as they can get to the
[35:42] water, they're gone. They can't rest day
[35:45] and night until they receive the Holy
[35:46] Ghost. Why? You know, a Christian knows
[35:50] who his papa was.
[35:52] See, it takes two to make a birth.
[35:55] That's right. Papa and mama.
[35:59] The mule don't know which was papa,
[36:01] which was mama.
[36:04] But we know who papa mama was.
[36:07] For we were born of the written word of
[36:11] God, confirmed by the spirit.
[36:15] Peter said on the day of Pentecost, "If
[36:17] you will repent and be baptized, every
[36:19] one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
[36:21] for the remission of your sins, you
[36:23] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[36:25] Ghost." And brother, a real bornagain
[36:28] Christian, oh my, he's spirited. As soon
[36:32] as he gets the word, he receives the
[36:34] Holy Ghost. Ask him something, man.
[36:38] He knows where he's standing.
[36:41] Do you believe in divine healing? Amen.
[36:45] You believe in the second coming? Amen.
[36:49] That's the mule
[36:50] thing. The mule religion. I don't know.
[36:54] Dr. Jones said one time, "Oh, they're
[36:56] going at your Saul." See, oh, they don't
[36:59] know. Well, I tell you, my church is not
[37:02] sure of it. Oh, brother, but a bornag
[37:05] again man and woman is just as sure of
[37:07] the coming of the Lord Jesus, they're
[37:10] just as sure they got the Holy Ghost as
[37:12] there is a Holy Ghost to be given.
[37:15] Jesus said the woman at the well, we
[37:17] worship in this mountain and the Jews
[37:20] worship at Jerusalem. He said,"Woman,
[37:22] hear my words. The hour is coming, and
[37:26] now is, when the Father seeketh those
[37:29] that'll worship him in the spirit and
[37:32] the truth. Thy word is the truth." Amen.
[37:36] And every man that'll read the Bible and
[37:38] believe every word that Bible says and
[37:41] follow its instructions and receive the
[37:43] same Holy Ghost that they received, the
[37:45] same way they received it, same results
[37:48] they received it, same power they got
[37:50] when they received it. He knows who his
[37:52] papa and mama was. He knows he's washed
[37:56] in the blood of Jesus Christ, born of
[37:59] the spirit, filled with God's uncction.
[38:02] He knows where he's standing.
[38:05] Sure, he's in
[38:07] Canaan. He knows where he come
[38:10] from. That's the way it is with a real
[38:12] Christian asking, "Have you received the
[38:15] Holy Ghost since you believed?" Amen,
[38:18] brother.
[38:20] Praise the Lord. Stand the other day by
[38:23] an old saint, 92 years old, talking to
[38:27] her 80year-old
[38:29] pastor. I said, "Grandma, just as bright
[38:32] as she could be." She said, "Yes, my
[38:35] son." I said, "How long has it been
[38:38] since you received the Holy Ghost?" She
[38:40] said, "Glory to God." About 60 years
[38:42] ago, I got it.
[38:49] Now she'd been a mule. She'd said, "Now
[38:51] wait a minute. I was confirmed in
[38:52] Sprinkle when I was well certain." And
[38:55] they take me into the church and I took
[38:56] my letter over to Oh, mercy. They don't
[39:00] even know where they belong.
[39:03] But she know where her birthright come
[39:05] from. She was there when it happened.
[39:09] She was born of the water and of the
[39:13] spirit.
[39:15] She know and the water through the
[39:16] washing of the water by the word takes
[39:19] the word. Now watch how this is
[39:22] addressed to those that are in Christ
[39:25] Jesus. Paul remember I'm taking a long
[39:28] time but I ain't going to get through
[39:29] this
[39:31] chapter. But I heard you like it.
[39:36] It tells us where we are. But we can't
[39:39] do it in just one night. We need a month
[39:42] or two of this. Yes. every night. Just
[39:44] go right to it word by word. Go back and
[39:47] bring it up in the histories and lay it
[39:49] right out word by word and show you that
[39:52] it's the truth. Yes.
[39:55] Now, let me read that verse quickly
[39:57] again. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ
[40:00] by the will of God, not the will of man,
[40:04] to the saints which are in
[40:08] Ephesus and conjunction to the faithful
[40:12] in Christ
[40:15] Jesus means they've been called out,
[40:18] separated, and have been baptized by the
[40:20] Holy Spirit and are in Christ Jesus. I'm
[40:24] addressing this epistle to you, my
[40:27] beloved ones.
[40:29] Oh, I think of Paul over there with him
[40:32] right
[40:33] now. Oh, how happy that little old
[40:36] apostle had his head chopped off down
[40:38] there. I stood by the place where they
[40:40] chopped his head off, but oh, his head's
[40:43] on and that new body can never be
[40:44] chopped off again.
[40:47] And he's standing over there with him
[40:48] this very minute. Amen. The same
[40:51] apostlate wrote this and said to you
[40:54] that are in Christ Jesus. By one spirit
[40:58] we're all baptized into this one body.
[41:00] Now
[41:01] watch. Grace be unto you and peace from
[41:05] God our father and the Lord Jesus
[41:08] Christ. Blessed be the God and father of
[41:10] our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[41:13] with all.
[41:18] Amen. Amen. Glory to God. Do you hear
[41:21] that? J
[41:23] has blessed us with all spiritual
[41:28] blessings. Not just some to the apostles
[41:31] and some to this, but he's blessed us
[41:33] with
[41:34] all spiritual blessings. Amen. The same
[41:38] Holy Ghost that fell on the day of
[41:39] Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost here
[41:41] tonight. Amen. The same Holy Ghost that
[41:44] made Mary shout and speak with tongues
[41:46] and have a wonderful time and rejoice
[41:49] and the things that she did is the same
[41:51] Holy Ghost here tonight. The same Holy
[41:54] Ghost that let Paul and that old ship
[41:56] where it looked like his water log and
[41:58] was gone and 14 days and nights, no moon
[42:00] and stars looked out there and every
[42:03] wave had a devil on it glancing and
[42:05] gleeding his teeth and said, "I'll sank
[42:07] you, old boy now. I got you now." While
[42:11] Paul went down to have a little prayer,
[42:12] there stood an angel and said, "Don't
[42:14] you fear, Paul."
[42:18] This old ship's going to be wrecked up
[42:20] on a certain island. Go ahead and eat
[42:22] your supper. It's all right. Now here he
[42:24] cometh in chains on his little arms
[42:27] dragging him on his feet and said be of
[42:29] a good courage man for the God the angel
[42:33] of God whose servant I am stood by me
[42:35] and said Paul don't you fear that same
[42:38] Holy Ghost is here tonight same spirit
[42:42] of God minister to us the same spiritual
[42:46] blessings
[42:49] bless us with all spiritual blessings
[42:53] In heavenly
[42:56] places. Oh, let's stop just one more
[42:59] minute here. In heavenly
[43:03] places. Not just not out anywhere, but
[43:06] in heavenly
[43:08] places. We are assembled in heavenly. It
[43:12] means that the position of the
[43:15] believer that if I'm prayed up, you're
[43:18] prayed up. The church is prayed up. and
[43:21] we're ready for the message. And we have
[43:24] assembled ourselves together as saints,
[43:26] called out, baptized with the Holy
[43:29] Ghost, filled with God's blessings,
[43:31] called elected, set together in heavenly
[43:34] places. Now we are heavenlies in our
[43:38] souls.
[43:39] Our spirits has brought us into a
[43:42] heavenly atmosphere. Oh, brother.
[43:46] There you are. A heavenly atmosphere.
[43:51] Oh, what could happen tonight?
[43:55] What could happen tonight if we would be
[43:58] sitting here in a heavenly atmosphere?
[44:03] Praise God. And the Holy Spirit moving
[44:06] over every heart that's been regenerated
[44:10] and become a new creature in Christ
[44:11] Jesus. All sins under the blood in
[44:16] perfect worship with our hands up to God
[44:18] and our hearts lifted sitting in
[44:21] heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[44:26] Worshiping together in the heavenly
[44:29] places. Did you ever set one?
[44:33] Oh, I have
[44:35] set weep for joy and say God never let
[44:39] me leave here. Amen. Just heavenly
[44:42] places in Christ
[44:45] Jesus blessing us with what? Divine
[44:49] healing,
[44:51] fornowledge,
[44:52] revelation, visions, powers, tongues,
[44:58] interpretations, wisdom, knowledge, all
[45:02] the heavenly blessings and joy
[45:05] unspeakable and full of glory.
[45:08] Every heart filled with the spirit
[45:11] walking together, sitting together in
[45:13] heavenly
[45:14] places. Not one evil thought among us.
[45:18] Not one cigarette smoke. Not one sharp
[45:22] dress. Not one this that or the other.
[45:25] Not one evil thought. Nobody got
[45:28] anything against one another. Everybody
[45:30] speaking in love and harmony. Everybody
[45:34] with one accord and one a place. Then
[45:36] suddenly there come from heaven a sound
[45:38] like a rushing mighty wind.
[45:41] There you are
[45:43] has blessed us with all spiritual
[45:48] blessings. Then the Holy Spirit might
[45:50] fall upon somebody and say, "Thus
[45:53] sayaeth the Lord, go to a certain place
[45:56] and do a certain thing." Watch it happen
[45:58] just like that. Amen.
[46:01] Thus sayeth the Lord, do a certain thing
[46:03] at a certain place. Watch it happen like
[46:05] that.
[46:06] blessed us together in all heavenly
[46:09] blessings and heavenly places.
[46:13] Watch according as he has chosen
[46:17] us. Did we choose him or he chose us?
[46:22] He chose
[46:23] us when the night that we accepted him.
[46:29] chosen according as he has chosen us in
[46:33] him
[46:35] before
[46:37] the foundations of the world that we
[46:42] should be holy without blame before him
[46:47] in
[46:51] denominations in love.
[46:55] When did God choose
[46:57] us? When did God choose you that's got
[47:00] the Holy Ghost? When did he choose you?
[47:04] Before the foundation of the
[47:07] [Music]
[47:08] world. By his fornowledge he foresaw you
[47:13] and know that you love him. And before
[47:16] there was a foundation of the world, he
[47:19] chose you. Amen. and sent Jesus that he
[47:24] might be the propitiation of your sins
[47:27] to call you to reconciliation to himself
[47:30] to love.
[47:32] Oh, wish we had just a few more minutes
[47:35] time. Let me before we go any further,
[47:38] go back Genesis 1:26. I'll pick it up
[47:41] Wednesday.
[47:43] When God made man, before he made man,
[47:46] he called himself l e l l e l h l eloh
[47:53] him. The word means in the Hebrew the
[47:59] selfexistence all by
[48:02] himself. Nothing existed before him. He
[48:05] was all the existence he ever was.
[48:08] Selfexistence one. Amen.
[48:11] L
[48:13] Elohim means all
[48:16] sufficient, all
[48:19] powerful,
[48:21] allmighty, self-existence
[48:24] one.
[48:27] Hallelujah. But in Genesis 2, when he
[48:29] made man, he said, "I
[48:32] am Y a hu J u v u h Yahwa Jehovah." What
[48:40] did it mean? I am the
[48:43] allexistence one who has created
[48:47] something all for myself to be a son of
[48:50] mine or a temporary or an amateur little
[48:54] one of mine. Amen.
[49:01] Why? He gave
[49:03] man. Jehovah means that he gave man to
[49:07] be an amateur god
[49:10] because he is father God and he made a
[49:14] man an amateur god. So he isn't
[49:16] self-existence anymore. He exists with
[49:19] his family.
[49:23] Hallelujah.
[49:25] El
[49:26] Elohim. Now, now he is Jehovah. Jehovah
[49:32] meaning the one who exists with his
[49:35] family. Now, God made man to be the
[49:40] predominant over all the earth. He had
[49:43] dominion and the earth was man's
[49:46] dominion. Is that scripture?
[49:49] Then if that's his domain, he was God
[49:51] over the earth. Yeah, he could speak and
[49:55] it would be so. He could speak this and
[49:57] it would be so.
[50:00] Amen. There he is. God,
[50:05] Jehovah, the one who once existed in
[50:08] self-existence, but now exists with his
[50:11] family and his little ones with him.
[50:16] Amen. There you are. Hallelujah.
[50:19] Now, read that. We'll get into it
[50:21] Wednesday night when we got more time.
[50:23] We just about 15 more minutes and we I
[50:25] thought I'd get to a certain spot here,
[50:27] but uh we won't till we're sealed by the
[50:31] Holy Spirit of promise. All
[50:33] right. Now, when was we called to be
[50:37] servants of God? When was Arville
[50:40] Neville called to be a servant of God?
[50:46] This staggers me. I tell you, let's get
[50:49] some scriptures. I want you to get First
[50:52] Peter uh 1:20 and uh Pat, get Revelation
[50:59] 17:8 and uh I'll get
[51:01] Revelations 13. Now, we want to listen
[51:06] here. You want to know when God called
[51:09] you to be a
[51:13] Christian? Oh, I love this. This is man
[51:17] shall not live by bread
[51:19] alone, but by every word that proceedth
[51:22] out of the mouth of God. All right,
[51:24] brother Neville, you got 1 Peter 120.
[51:28] 120. Read 119 and 120. Listen to
[51:33] this. 119 and 20. Yes. but with the
[51:37] precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb
[51:40] without blemish and without spot, who
[51:44] verily was for ordained before the
[51:46] foundation of the world, but was
[51:49] manifest in these last times for you.
[51:53] When was he for
[51:55] ordained? Before the foundation of the
[51:59] world. Brother Pat, read Revelation 17:8
[52:03] for me.
[52:05] The beast that thou sest was and is not,
[52:08] and shall ascend out of the bottomless
[52:11] pit, and go into predition, and they
[52:14] that dwell on the earth shall wonder,
[52:17] whose names were not written in the book
[52:19] of life from the foundation of the
[52:23] world, when they behold the beast that
[52:25] was and is not of yet.
[52:28] Who's going to be deceived?
[52:30] Who's going to be deceived by this
[52:32] religious person like Saul was that was
[52:36] just so cunning and so perfect to it
[52:39] would deceive thee what very e
[52:43] if possible if possible. All right.
[52:47] Revelations 13:8. Let me read it for
[52:49] you. And all that dwell upon the earth
[52:52] shall all that dwell upon the earth
[52:56] shall worship him whose names were not
[52:59] written in the book of life of the lamb
[53:03] slaying before the foundation of the
[53:06] world. Hallelujah. When was our names
[53:09] put in the lamb's book of life? When the
[53:11] lamb was slaying before the foundation
[53:13] of the world. When God was Jehovah El
[53:17] Elo Elohim, the self-existence one, just
[53:22] like one great big diamond, and he could
[53:25] not be nothing else. But inside of this
[53:28] diamond, his attributes was a savior.
[53:34] Amen. In this attributes on the inside
[53:37] of him was a healer.
[53:40] Hallelujah. Well, there was nothing to
[53:42] save and nothing to heal.
[53:45] But his attributes produced it.
[53:49] So then before the foundation of the
[53:51] world when he knowed that the great
[53:53] display in here of him that he would be
[53:56] a savior that he would come and be made
[53:58] flesh and dwelt among us and he knowed
[54:00] by his stripes would be healed. He
[54:03] slayed the lamb on his book before the
[54:06] foundation of the world and wrote your
[54:09] name on that book before the foundation
[54:12] of the world. Hallelujah.
[54:16] Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Listen to
[54:19] this.
[54:22] Predestination looks back to
[54:24] fornowledge. I mean
[54:26] election election looks back to
[54:29] fornowledge and predestination looks to
[54:33] destiny. Don't forget that that election
[54:37] looks back here is I was a cockleber. I
[54:41] was born in sin shaped in iniquity come
[54:44] to the world speaking lies born among
[54:46] sinners father and mother and all my
[54:48] whole family sinners. I was a
[54:51] cockleberg but all of a sudden I become
[54:53] a wheat grain.
[54:56] How did it happen? Uh that what is that
[54:59] election? God before the foundation of
[55:02] the world elected that the cockab was to
[55:06] become a grain of wheat. Now I know I'm
[55:08] a grain of wheat because I'm saved. How
[55:10] do I do it? Look back and see that he
[55:13] predestinated it long time ago by
[55:17] fornowledge. He seen that I would love
[55:19] him. So he made a propituation through
[55:21] his own son that through him I might
[55:23] become from a of bird to a grain of
[55:26] wheat. Now where am I at now? I'm saved.
[55:30] I'm walking in the grace of God. What
[55:33] does predestination look to destiny?
[55:36] Where will he take me to and where am I
[55:37] going?
[55:39] That's got you. There you are. Now let's
[55:43] read just a little farther and then
[55:45] we'll have to close pretty sharply.
[55:48] according as he chose us in him before
[55:50] the foundation of the world that we
[55:53] should be holy without blame before him
[55:55] in love
[55:58] having
[56:00] predestinated
[56:02] us unto the
[56:04] adoption predestinated unto the adoption
[56:08] of children by Jesus Christ to himself
[56:12] according to the good pleasure of his
[56:15] will. What did he do? He by forn
[56:20] knowledge forsaw
[56:23] us knowing that he was a
[56:26] savior
[56:28] self-existence. There was no angels, no
[56:31] nothing. Just God Elo Elohim, the
[56:35] self-existence one. Nothing but him
[56:38] alone. But in him
[56:41] was a savior.
[56:45] Amen. Well, what's he going to say?
[56:46] There's nothing
[56:48] lost. Knowing that, then he know that
[56:52] this great attribute in him would
[56:54] project something out down there that he
[56:57] could save. Then when it did that by
[57:00] forn knowledge, he looked down and he
[57:02] saw everyone that would accept it.
[57:08] And then by doing so, he said, "Thus say
[57:12] that the only way I can do it will be
[57:14] come down myself and be made flesh and
[57:17] take the sin of the man upon him and die
[57:19] for him that I might be the one that's
[57:22] worshiped because he is God, the object
[57:24] of worship." Amen. Then he came down and
[57:27] taken upon himself. And while he did
[57:30] that, he did that that he might save you
[57:34] who wants to be saved.
[57:38] Praise the Lord. Do you see what I mean?
[57:42] By forn knowledge. Amen. The infinite
[57:45] God who know all things saw the lamb and
[57:50] he slayed the lamb before the foundation
[57:53] of the world. and he put your name on
[57:56] the lamb's book of life and he seen the
[57:58] deceitfulness of Satan what he would do.
[58:00] So he put your name on there and he said
[58:03] that the Antichrist would be so
[58:05] religious, so good, such a fine fellow,
[58:09] such a smart man, such a religious man
[58:12] that he would deceive the very elected
[58:16] if it was possible. But it isn't
[58:18] impossible because their means were for
[58:22] orained before the foundation of the
[58:24] world. By election he chose them and by
[58:29] predestination they know where they are
[58:31] going. Amen. There you are.
[58:35] Now who could doubt that? That's what
[58:38] Paul said. That's Paul's scripture.
[58:43] That's Paul's writing. That's what he
[58:46] taught his church. The church
[58:49] positionally before the foundation of
[58:52] the world when God and his labor pain
[58:56] was bringing forth bringing forth you
[58:59] knowing what you would do he
[59:01] positionally placed you into his own
[59:04] body. Amen. Amen. To be a
[59:08] housewife, to be a farmer, to be a
[59:11] preacher, to be a prophet, to be this or
[59:14] to be that, he placed you positionally.
[59:17] Then when we have come from the garlic
[59:20] lands of Egypt through sanctification
[59:23] and baptized into the promised land, for
[59:27] the promise of God is the Holy Ghost.
[59:30] Amen. Ephesians 4:30 says, "Grieve not
[59:33] the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are
[59:36] sealed until the day of your
[59:38] redemption." Amen.
[59:41] Then God having predestinated the
[59:45] church, he said, "And all the peoples,
[59:48] there will be millions times millions
[59:51] that will walk very religious and be
[59:54] deceived."
[59:56] Yeah. The only ones that will not be
[59:58] deceived will be those that have come
[1:00:00] over into the promised land who before
[1:00:03] the foundation of the world had their
[1:00:05] names put on the lamb's book of life and
[1:00:08] come over into the promised land and
[1:00:10] enjoying
[1:00:20] it. Amen. Let's all stand. Help me thank
[1:00:24] God for the word
[1:00:25] tonight. Oh my, this nice deep
[1:00:29] teaching that we've heard it before, but
[1:00:32] we need to be reminded that our name was
[1:00:35] in
[1:00:36] Elohim before the foundation of the
[1:00:39] world. Amen. Let us take our prayer
[1:00:42] request tonight. If anyone has a prayer
[1:00:44] request to bring before the
[1:00:47] saints. Yes, brother Chris.
[1:00:56] Okay, Chris's niece Jen, pray for her
[1:01:00] touching her body. Was there someone
[1:01:02] else as a request tonight? Always pray
[1:01:06] for one
[1:01:07] another. Pray
[1:01:10] for the work of the Lord that's going
[1:01:13] around the world. missionary efforts,
[1:01:16] pastors, ministers, minist ministries,
[1:01:19] all the youth. Pray that the Lord will
[1:01:22] give us another outpouring of his Holy
[1:01:25] Spirit that we need, that he'll bless us
[1:01:29] to go into the adoption, not just be
[1:01:31] church members, but we're predestinated
[1:01:34] to the adoption. Amen. So, let's sing
[1:01:37] that hymn of the church. Let's sing that
[1:01:41] song, Have Faith in God. prepare to go
[1:01:44] to the Lord in
[1:01:46] prayer. Oh,
[1:01:49] have
[1:01:51] faith in
[1:01:57] God.
[1:01:59] Have
[1:02:01] faith in God.
[1:02:04] [Music]
[1:02:10] Have
[1:02:11] faith in God for the
[1:02:17] answer. Have
[1:02:20] faith
[1:02:23] in
[1:02:25] God. One more
[1:02:27] time. Oh,
[1:02:31] have
[1:02:33] faith in God.
[1:02:39] Hallelujah.
[1:02:41] Have
[1:02:43] faith in
[1:02:49] God.
[1:02:52] Have
[1:02:54] faith in God for the answer.
[1:03:00] have
[1:03:03] faith
[1:03:06] in
[1:03:08] God. We're going to continue to keep
[1:03:10] Sister Lorie Snow in prayer. She's not
[1:03:13] out of the um the woods yet. We're still
[1:03:17] claiming her healing, but she really
[1:03:19] needs a touch from the Lord, and she
[1:03:22] needs our prayers tonight. Sister Lorie
[1:03:25] Snow and also Brother McGraw and Sister
[1:03:29] McGraw that he's she's taking care of
[1:03:32] him and she really needs somebody to
[1:03:34] take care of her and they're just just
[1:03:38] precious old saints and they don't have
[1:03:40] a lot of confidence just strangers and
[1:03:43] new doctors and all of that. So they're
[1:03:45] really
[1:03:46] just kind of to themselves. And so I'm
[1:03:50] asking the Lord to touch them and
[1:03:51] strengthen them. The Lord will just give
[1:03:54] them what they have need of. And also
[1:03:57] for the little group of believers that
[1:03:59] gather there in Mesa, um keep them in
[1:04:02] prayer. Amen. And pray for one another.
[1:04:05] So you can pray right at your seat. You
[1:04:07] can come to the altar and pray. God
[1:04:09] bless you.

[1:30:35] Lord Jesus, we love you.
[1:30:37] Amen. Amen. I want you to really keep
[1:30:40] the little group in Mesa in prayer. It's
[1:30:44] always been my heart's desire to do a
[1:30:47] little outreach in that Phoenix area.
[1:30:50] And that door
[1:30:52] opened. I don't know how. I don't know
[1:30:54] why the Lord gave me favor with the
[1:30:57] carpenters, but he did open the door for
[1:31:01] that little work to be what it is. And
[1:31:04] it's unique. I don't know what the full
[1:31:10] um how far it goes, but I know that it's
[1:31:14] growing just a little bit. A few little
[1:31:17] different little saints are coming in
[1:31:19] there. And um of all of the places to
[1:31:23] for the Lord to open the door to open
[1:31:25] the door there in the Mesa church where
[1:31:28] brother Random preached, one of the
[1:31:30] first message churches there. And I
[1:31:32] didn't push myself there. The Lord
[1:31:34] opened that door. A little desire in my
[1:31:37] heart for it and he opened it and so
[1:31:40] it's there. So you pray for it. I know
[1:31:42] everyone doesn't understand it and
[1:31:44] that's okay. I don't fully understand
[1:31:46] it. But however the Lord wants to lead
[1:31:48] and bless it, that's what I want. So you
[1:31:52] pray for that group and the believers
[1:31:54] there and the saints that can be reached
[1:31:56] there in that little city. Amen. So God
[1:32:00] bless you richly. Brother Chuck, would
[1:32:02] you come and dismiss us in order of
[1:32:04] prayer? We'll bow our heads. Remember
[1:32:06] the Robson, they're traveling this this
[1:32:09] weekend. God bless them and all the
[1:32:12] others that may be traveling as well.
[1:32:14] God bless
[1:32:19] [Music]
[1:32:20] you. Lord Jesus, it's always so good to
[1:32:23] come together, Lord, to worship you,
[1:32:26] Lord. just to lay ourselves on the
[1:32:28] altar, Father, before you and Lord, ask
[1:32:32] for your will, Lord Jesus, in our lives
[1:32:34] and for these requests and needs of your
[1:32:38] children, Father. We know that you're a
[1:32:40] prayer answering God. Lord, we're a
[1:32:41] witness of it. We've experienced it,
[1:32:44] Lord. And we just absolutely believe and
[1:32:46] we just hold each of these up tonight
[1:32:48] that you've brought forward, Lord Jesus.
[1:32:51] Just ask for a touch from you one more
[1:32:53] time, Father.
[1:32:56] Bless each one who's brought their
[1:32:58] little lake of fire here tonight, Lord.
[1:33:00] And believe that we've all been
[1:33:02] refreshed, Father, as a result of
[1:33:04] hearing your word. Just bless us as we
[1:33:06] go our separate ways now. We pray that
[1:33:08] you'd watch over, protect, and keep each
[1:33:10] one. Jesus, grant these things we ask.
[1:33:13] Thank you in Jesus name for
[1:33:17] Amen. Amen. God bless you so much. Let's
