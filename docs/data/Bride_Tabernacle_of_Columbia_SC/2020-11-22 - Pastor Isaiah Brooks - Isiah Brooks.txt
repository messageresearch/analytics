as we stand let us turn to the book of revelation tell you what you better enjoy this time as much as possible things are not going to get better if you thought think the first lockdown was bad there's coming something else so you better enjoy this time so you won't think about how i should have been could have been you better do what you're going to do now amen amen you know i love the lord i love this message and i appreciate everything god is doing for us in this last days i'm excited now i had i haven't had any problem with my throat until now and so i know who that is and i'm binding him right now in the name of jesus christ you all know i don't get hoarse amen uh revelations 10. hallelujah we're going to read uh the 8th through the 11th verses thank you musicians for the accompaniment revelations 10 8-11 and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went in to the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take eat take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i looked and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many people and nations and tongues and kings you love the lord one more scripture psalm 62 psalm 62 this is the day and the hour that we have so looked forward to we're talking about the coming of the lord and we realize amen god as i said yesterday friday god interprets his own word in the way he choose to reveal himself and we're thankful that god is yet interpreting his word and it is important that you come to the knowledge in the revelation of who you are that you are the interpretation of the word for this hour psalm 62 6-8 he he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be moved and god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god trust in him at all times ye people not some of the time all times pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us salah that means meditate on it think on it let us pray our gracious father god we come before you lord it's homeless we know how we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us and oh god you have been more than enough more than enough and father my cup runs over hallelujah and we're so grateful we're so grateful to all that you're doing for us we are anticipating lord the changing of the body we're looking forward to it because lord we so long to see you come and we know lord god that you have appeared to us and we love your appearance and you said by god those of us who love your appearance that you will one day change us from mortal to immortality father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy and we pray lord god that you bless this service in a mighty mighty mighty way in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated at home i have to take it kind of slow because uh we have various languages in our church we have the french and we also have the swahili and so therefore we have sometimes two interpreters interpreting uh the the word and so therefore i have to take my time to to not only speak it but pronounce it so they can understand it because to them i still have that little southern accent and it's kind of difficult for them to understand me sometimes because they're used to hearing the british english and and so i told them i don't know that one [Laughter] the only english english that i know is the american english and so therefore i told them i said now if you think that uh my accent is is bad because i can't hear it anymore uh i said you need to you know let's go down to you know charleston and you know mullins and places like that and you know and let's see how much english english you will understand so we thank god for his grace we thank god for his mercy and i've been preaching on the rock he is my rock and you know i don't think you know i think sometime we when we say rock we don't go uh no further than the the very very physical makeup of what iraq is uh but a rock is something in the bible is it talks about something greater than just the physical aspect of sand being pressed together and and becoming hardened uh because of heat and pressure you know that's what really a rock is little pebbles of sand you know pressed together but you know i i want to also talk about uh a new a new message a message of of grace and it sounds like i'm coming with something new but i'm not uh because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever now we we read there in the in the book of revelation where god is speaking and um he's showing us amen that there is a book that has been opened and you and i understand that the book for hundreds of years was sealed so much so in the old testament they were asked men were asked to read it intelligent men uh men who uh are dumb men whatever nobody could read it or even understand it because the book was sealed and even you you've heard me say just on the other day about the bread you know the bread of which is jesus said i am the bread of life and we understand without the anointing uh you can't understand the bread you can't understand this book y'all understand that and so we understand that the bible or that shoe bread in the uh uh outer court uh let me put his way in the in the holy place so you understand uh uh it represents this bible the bread uh but sometimes uh people want to take the shoe bread and put it into the holies of holies uh but but you can't take the shoe bread and put it in the holies of holies because the holies of holies consisted of manna and that manner was in a a golden sensor type of vessel showing that the vessel that the manner in itself was deity now isn't amazing but still because not only was it god jesus said i am that bread but he also said i am that manner or that bread that fell in the wilderness so we understand by god's grace amen that bread that laid there on that that table there in in the holy place laid the top as i said the other day was was gold which represented deity uh uh something happens a change of some sort happens when you that same bread it doesn't change one bread was made on the earth and the other bread was made in heaven and that manner amen that comes down from heaven is now preserved there in the holies of holies and that's what we're talking about because remember as long as the veil was there nobody could really identify god like israel israel thought that god was in a box and you've heard us say that you can't just put god in a box god was beyond the ark that was in the what we call uh with moses and and joshua that was just a replica something symbolic to let them know that he was with them but god was way beyond that y'all understand me god was way beyond that because amen he was with them even when the ark wasn't with them you understand me so you and i must understand amen we must have a revelation of who god is you know god is the kind of a person you can worship him under a tree you can worship him sitting on a rock you can worship him in the desert wherever you are you can worship god and understand when we talk about worship we're not talking about just singing praises because worship involves more than just singing praises we think sometimes because of the music and and all of that and all that's good don't get me wrong but worship also includes reading the word whoo hello because amen you've got to understand and i'm kind of jumping a little bit but jesus met a woman at the well and he told this woman certain things about her life but he proceeded on to say that the father is looking for those who would worship me in spirit and in truth hallelujah where everybody says oh they got the holy ghost and worshiping in spirit is wonderful but the only way you can worship in truth is by the word hello because the word is truth hallelujah and so this is where things become can become unbalanced because christians say i love god and yet they won't read their word so when you don't read your word you come short of worshiping god in truth you can come in here and you can shout you can dance you can do all the religious things but when you don't read your word you don't study your word you don't meditate on your word you are leaving the truth part out of it so therefore your worship is in vain hello god says worship me in spirit and in truth hallelujah you understand what i'm saying because when we're here by god's grace what makes us different than what we call the pentecostals their anointing is the same anointing they're spirit hallelujah but what makes them air is because they failed to follow the word you understand me because when luther came he was the word expressed he preached the revelation of his day and in that small portion he had truth and he had spirit the portion that was allotted to him hallelujah but when wesley came he could no longer continue in luther's message because luther's message was for the lutheran in that day but he had to take what luther had and add to what god had given him which was sanctification so you can't even worship god in spirit and truth without justification and sanctification it don't stop there it doesn't stop there it went on to the pentecostals right and so we say okay uh uh we we're gonna worship in other words what i'm trying to say every church age messenger in order for him to be a true messenger had to bring something different from the old hello he you know wesley could not just preach luther's message and be truth he had to preach what god remember this is a restoration this is a restoring of the word and so you have to follow the pill of fire wherever he moves let me hurry up so we find out the pentecostals we preached it you know and and then we we we thought it we didn't know but we found out by god's grace amen that that there was more than just jumping and shouting and speaking in tongues now the spirit of god caused those things to happen but that wasn't the fullness of the word then god had to send a messenger in our day with a different message than pentecost he had to take us from the outer core i mean the holy place hello y'all understand what i'm saying see you can worship god in your your spirit but god wants truth in the holy place as i said you had the seven golden candlesticks you had the table of shoe bread you had all of those things and and they worshiped god in that place that was good for them but now god is calling us up higher he's calling for us to worship him in a place that no other age has worshipped him in you understand me because the message in which they received in pentecost from for the most part i'm not talking about election now i said for the most part that anointing struck their spirit that's why you could have people amen that could shout and dance and curse like sailors huh that's why you have people a man who can preach like angels and commit adultery hallelujah because they did not have the word that could take them beyond the veil see this is not just a message we're not here just to quote things hallelujah but god has called us the bride of jesus christ to live it and every age lived the life and or the message that was preached to them hallelujah y'all understand me and each messenger it means like luther that that bible that word that says to just shall live by faith you know what that was that was a rock that was their revelation and nobody could take that from them y'all understand what i'm saying we who have been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ what preacher what politician what pope can take that from you it is a revelation it's not something that you got in your head it's something that's in your heart but this message doesn't just allows you to remain there like i said the other day in the seven church ages because the seven church ages was based upon rules and laws and regulations remember even in the wesleyan age amen women couldn't even wear any jewelry because that's what they styled as sanctification look at us now we realize amen that that revelation as it were amen was good but we understood that god goes beyond the outward appearance and he looks at the heart you understand me i'm talking about god is my rock he's my revelation and he has come in this last day amen to show us who we are and what we came for here when like i said it was a changing of the message and that's what i try to tell people i'm not saying that if you you you know how many y'all know this see in in the in the in the uh holy place there were laws you know the candlesticks you know the shoe bread there were ceremonial things that you you did there and um you know like we do here like we do everywhere uh you know people think well it's my church it ain't your church this building is not holy unless the holy god is in it i could worship god anywhere and you you don't understand god he did god didn't die on the cross for this building god died on the cross for your building and the bible said ye are the temple of god you understand me see the the danger of this whole thing is you can be like the pharisees like i mentioned yes friday and you can do all the ritualistic things those things that look pleasant and pleasing to the eyes of men but when jesus came and he judged what the he was seeing he said i wouldn't let you look like white as supplica but inwardly you're dead men's bones now the reason why he said those things because jesus was not ignorant to the fact that the ark of the covenant was no longer there that's right when israel went into babylon the ark of the covenant was taken away so all of those hundreds of years they had church they had singers they had music they had all of those things and that whole religious act was a fake somebody help me here see that's why it's important that you have the holy ghost in your soul not just on your flesh not just on your spirit but in there where he makes you change when you got the holy ghost you don't have to practice righteousness righteousness is a part of the fruit it is something that the tree bears oh god help me you talking about a breaking of a new day we're talking about making a rapture and only those amen who have been born again truly born again amen got god on in on the inside god sitting on the throne of your heart you are the ones hello y'all don't remember let me tell y'all something i don't know how they did it at your church but at my church the one the apostolic church i went to they didn't care about you being sanctified you know what they wanted to hear you speak in tongues take you right off the street baptize you and take you into the tarrying room until you don't set jesus fast enough to your tongue status and you say oh you got it and they sang people go right out drinking smoking dancing why because they missed a step they missed the step of sanctification oh y'all looking at me like i'm crazy but that's what happens to a lot of the message people you come right into the message you understand some revelation and all of a sudden you got it oh you've got to be born again that's one sp aspect of the word that will never change and this is why i keep preaching to my own church we're not here amen to conform to a system that man has laid out here under the umbrella of the message we're here to know the messenger and i'm not talking about william branham i'm talking about jesus christ help me somebody [Applause] we're living in a time where it's urgent people need to examine themselves like the bible says to see whether they be in the faith help us jesus it is grace but because we have grace many people have made it a disgrace they were called christians at antioch because they act like christ they walk like christ they talk like christ jesus christ was always the message y'all hear me so what are you saying brother brooks are you moving no no no no no there was a time when jesus walked the earth right and they said come see a man hello but when jesus died and rose again it became the gospel of jesus christ the death burial and resurrection of jesus christ never from that point on did they say come see a man y'all hear what i'm saying i want you to understand that when when the prophet of god was here on the scene he always directed us to jesus christ and if you don't know who you serve you are blind still yet worship is something else you know worship means to prostrate about yourself but you know what we're doing we find ourselves bowing ourselves to our phones and our ipads hello and you don't even know the devil is tricking you and we find ourselves humbling ourselves is that right oh it's true jesus tried to connect with us and we'll say later let the phone beep gotta get it gotta answer it i ain't gonna preach on that y'all y'all looking at me like i'm crazy but the point is amen it must be this bible this word must become a revelation hallelujah i believe and i'm going to say it like this i was i'm working on a message from joshua the judges because remember one of the things that god told joshua he said moses is dead now if you say that in the message they say oh wait a minute brother is not dead no not in the way that god is saying the way god is saying he is he said bring that to the scripture jesus before he resurrect resurrected lazarus he said lazarus is asleep and his disciples says let's go wake him not understanding what jesus was saying then jesus had to bring it down to their term lazarus is dead because we know by god's grace that the message of those who are truly christians we never die we never we we sleep in christ but there are turns and there are times we must recognize the ending of a ministry and the beginning of something new so you say what do you mean brother brooks when the prophet of god went off the scene the holy spirit that was in him did not stop the ministry the ministry never stopped this is why the prophet god said the move is on for the bride wait a minute here what are you saying brother brooks there is a message do you mind if i take my jacket off now it's getting like the way i feel it i like feeling a little warm but the truth of the matter is the truth of the matter is amen he was saying i must decrease and he must increase now watch this because god told joshua and this is what i want you to understand don't you get away from the things that moses taught you i thought i'd get a bigger amen in other words in order to continue the ministry of joshua joshua had to be reminded of everything moses said he couldn't bear one eye order off of it he had to stay with that message but you see in moses day hallelujah in moses day the people were lazy dollatory and the whole time moses was trying to show them that they had the supernatural working with them too but you see everybody went down to jeffersonville just to see moses so that he could do the miracles and he says no i'm not the only one your pastor has the power by the word of god to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and the difference between moses ministry and joshua's ministry because when joshua came on the scene it was no longer a one-man ministry joshua said get everybody that's mature and we're gonna walk around jericho he involved everybody in the supernatural so is the spirit of god joshua jesus christ himself involving the whole body oh come on somebody a revelation you must understand in order for you to truly worship god it doesn't mean that you come to church and sit in your pews and do nothing everybody every piece of the body has a function i'm so tired of this nicholas appearance you know what i'm saying preacher come up and the people don't do nothing amen sometimes right and you say you're worshiping god and you're looking listen you can't even worship god here you understand what i'm saying with me from one building to another something changed but it ain't the building that building has done nothing for you it's your attitude it was your worship that made that building there oh come on somebody and if you take that same worship and bring it over here you would have the same effects don't blame it on the building you're the problem worship is worship it doesn't matter where you are to worship hallelujah you can worship in your bedroom you can worship in your kitchen you can worship wherever you are on the street this is why god said he's looking for those who would worship him in spirit and in truth that woman didn't say well i better stay here at the well and so i could worship you no sir when the truth struck her she ran to the city and said come see a man what was he doing she was worshiping oh god help us lord see we i'm so you know it just it's really sickening when we see amen how we have allowed a system to form us to something that is not this is not a collective revelation it's an individual y'all better hear what i'm saying we come here to hear the word we come here to say amen we come to uh you know be a witness to the word of this day and you say oh i'm in the message and you don't even read the open book you don't read the message for the day oh i need to you know i can't i can't discern which way to read whether i read the bible read the books or listen to the table folks you do them both you take a tape and you take your bible amen that's how you do it you don't make a sandwich normally out of one piece of bread what that's the truth when you read and study your bible that is worship why because when you hear the word you bow to it yes lord that's me how many times you read your bible and get excited because the bible speaks hallelujah what is it that is that a shekinah glory that is that anointing that is anointing that word feeding you and if the bible will do that so does the tapes oh somebody help me here god is real and when you understand what has taken place in this day hallelujah come out of her my people and be not partakers of her sin now we've done that but it's not just coming out you got to go into and look at all the people that came out of egypt that died following the prophet hallelujah you know why they were never able to humble themselves to the word hallelujah oh moses you think you're the only one long he was that's where the message came from that was god's choosing that was god's provided way and it was so important that god told joshua don't you forget what moses said why because moses is dead moses ministry has stopped but the word that moses preached was god am i making sense yes sir i'm going to say another thing we're different we have come out of systems of laws there's only one law left and that is the law of love and the bible said if you love me you'll keep my commandments so now he's bringing you out of uh uh uh the the bondage because i don't know whether you know it or not but the church i was in was a church of bondage and they had us so regulated we couldn't even visit other churches without telling the preacher the bishop or whoever where we were going we had to get permission even if it was in the same organization anybody know what i'm talking about i hope this is all right pastor but i i've got to preach what he wants me to preach because i haven't i'm trying my best to hurry and i'm not doing that but my point is let me move on you and i must understand we are in a law of love love is the only thing that god is looking for hello why because love never failing love was the thing that satan broke with eve hallelujah and they were kicked out of the garden because they reasoned where they fail to worship god listen when you reason is that the truth the bible says whosoever you yield your members to obey though that is the one you're worshiping hello so if you yield to the devil you becomes a worshipper of his whoo somebody help me here but if you stay within the shekinah you don't have to worry about that hallelujah why because in this kind of glory there is a covenant an unconditional covenant that no matter what you do you are covered and everybody ain't there he said don't look at yourself look at your sacrifice god don't look at you he looks at your sacrifice which is christ don't look at yourself i'm not worthy you're not worthy nobody's worthy but he is the one and i'm not counting on what i've done what i am never make it i'll never make it but i'm looking to what he's done there's where i'm trusting what he's done he's my sacrifice i'm not worthy of healing no sir lord i ought to have died long ago oh my i've never ever been born but i live i've got eternal life i'm going to heaven why because he done it for me hello see that's the problem that's why you can't come to church and really enjoy jesus because you come in here with these burdens lord look what i've done the devil said you ain't worthy you used to you ought to when he preached that to you you say amen you'll never be worthy but i take my lamb i take my sacrifice and because of my lamb because of my sacrifice i have been made worthy he became my sin that i might become the righteousness of god hallelujah so i'm free because he whom the son is set free is free indeed hallelujah oh people come in church and they're so worthy it feels so unworthy they can't worship that's a trick of the devil because he knows when you come in like that you're breaking the word into his gate with thanksgiving into his course with praise that's how you come in and when you come in with your head hung down amen the devil knows you're breaking the word and nine times out of ten you're not going to get from god what you deserve or what you need look at that woman amen who came in to see jesus in simon's house she was unworthy but she was standing right there at the ark of the covenant there was the mercy seat in human flesh hallelujah hallelujah she began to wash her she began to cry she took a little oil of alabasa and she broke it and she began to wash his feet and why oh my god can't you see the scene that's the way this message should affect you i've come into the presence of god hallelujah i come in unworthy maybe so but listen i will not leave out this way [Applause] hallelujah there are times amen you come in but when you come in with your head down you should go out with your head up hallelujah somehow church is that right if we produce the right atmosphere that's your kind of comes down and it annoys every one of us so much so if you come in dead you go out alive [Applause] it breaks the chains it destroys the works of the enemy hallelujah it changed your night in today oh come on somebody it rolls away the clouds and bring forth the sons of god hallelujah oh glory that's what this message came to do we supposed to be the happiest people on the face of the earth getting along with each other let me tell you something you got enough wine in you you get enough stimulation hallelujah you'll be hugging the chair telling the chair how much you love him huh you get enough oil in you right drunk people when they drop oh i just love you say get away from me hallelujah i don't want that anointing hallelujah but if you got some fire really lay your head on me hallelujah y'all see what i'm saying if you got fire lay your hands on me catch me a fire like i was saying when brother simmons prayed for me uh friday i could feel the fire of god just go through me like that hallelujah y'all understand me we ought to have a little virtue of something that if we lay hands it may not happen all the time but sometime at least sometimes hallelujah we ought to have something we can give a brother and a sister by way of a handshake or a hug y'all know what i'm saying hallelujah something brother sumter said at his wife's funeral he said it became a revelation that he had god living in his house say the say it was say it was veil hallelujah but now that the veil is gone he see that he he had god what was it not not mary the flesh but god in mary living the life of a virtuous woman that's god in you you cannot do it folks i can't do it but when god is on the inside and that anointing strikes the word y'all understand what i'm saying let's go let's say it like this william branham could be no great of a prophet if the anointing hadn't struck him if he was not the word for the day and the hour he would have never been able to do what he did but because he was the word god was all obligated to anoint the word in him for our day amen y'all believe that well what about the bride of jesus if you are the bride then god is obligated to anoint that seed in you to produce the bride of jesus christ not by power not by might but by my spirit said the lord you understand me hallelujah god is so real to us he said it's a wonderful to serve the lord and no it's thus says the lord how many of y'all know that christianity never gets boring to me oh we got to go to church again you know my church they know me i have church seven days a week if i could yeah i almost had it like that you know i noticed when i cut down the days nobody didn't tell me no brother brooks don't do it hallelujah and i might be the only one right now in the message still having an evening service on sundays but you can feel it some of the things like it ain't many of us coming you ought to not have service but i might have it till jesus tell me otherwise hallelujah y'all understand me amen i just can't go about their influence i must go if i'm the only one in that place in the evening i'm going to be there sometime i get there they're only about two or three of us and we're online and everybody think we had a church full hallelujah but one thing i was saying like this by god's grace the bible knew it was going to be this way because say where two or three are gathered in my name i'll be there in the midst so we steal scripture [Music] hallelujah and i'm telling you you know most of the time when you ain't got many oh my god he comes on the scene no resistance all the resistors stayed home free preaching y'all know what i'm saying she kind of comes down and we go up and all we can do is tell them y'all missed it but you see when they do come they stifle so sometimes you don't tell them nothing let them keep doing what they got to do y'all got quiet on that one but it's the truth it's the truth let me move on by god's grace now we realize amen god let me read this psalms 56 thou telleth my wonderings put thou my tears in thy bottle are they not in thy book when i cry unto thee then shall my enemies back turn back this i know for god is for me let me tell y'all something there is a time and my name has always been in the land book of life but let me tell you something there's a time that i was in the book of life because there was no blood i didn't know the lamb i didn't have the holy ghost hallelujah but when your name is in the lamb's book of life that revelation comes to you you are justified as though you never sin in the first place [Music] hallelujah see that's the difference between the foolish virgin and the wise the foolish virgin stayed in the in the the holy place they were sanctified they did everything right but they failed to go beyond the veil somebody help me here see and you can't have you came i tried to tell people i said understand you didn't hear the bells in the holy place you didn't hear the cry holy holy holy holy holy holy you you heard that behind the curtain that's where holiness is holiness is not your apparel holiness is when the holy god sits on your throne in your heart oh it's true because we've been taught and been dressed holy and that's right but it should be the end with man that holy ghost man that revealed to you that dressing holy is right and when you when you're influenced by the shekinah it's never a burden um i hope you're enjoying this because i am hallelujah in god will i praise this word in the lord will i praise this word that is worship oh my what time did we start hallelujah god is so good is that right listen i'm going to praise this word how many of us know enough scripture to praise him by his word some of us don't even know saint john 3 16. but i love his word you understand me it's more to worship than just the outward appearance god is looking for the heart is that right because the pharisees and the sadducees did not have god in his in their hearts and that's why god said you oh your worship is worshiping in me in vain you do all the rituals but i need your heart i'm not i'm not looking for a samson strength i'm looking for a conversion i'm looking for somebody who's been converted and i'm there with them oh help me jesus let me move on thou vows are upon me o god i will render praises unto thee don't you understand how can you praise god if you don't know him the way we praise god proves sometimes we don't know him like we think we do in all things give thanks hallelujah we should always be praising god even in the midst of our trials in the midst of our trial hey somebody help me here the lights only went out amen in the potential in the holy place but there is a kind of glory it never went out because it wasn't a man-made light hallelujah and when god let me tell you something i have gone through a lot of trials and a lot of temptations and a lot of failures but there's a place in my heart that satan can never put out hallelujah listen i don't ever worry about going to heaven i know heaven been made for me and i've been made for heaven hallelujah oh my god i realize amen that i don't have to worry about making a rapture because i'm in it already hallelujah i'm trying to quit listen the bible says but the people that walk in darkness have seen a great light i haven't even got where i wanted to go i'm sorry they that dwell in the land of the shadows of death upon them have the light shine and i used to worry about not word be concerned what is that light do you think he's talking about a light like that there's only one light real light and that's the light of god hallelujah and the light of god shines upon you where in the holies of holies the other lights of man-made made lights hallelujah but the light in the shekinah glory is god himself hallelujah if you walk in the light as he is in the light see that's the thing as he walking and i'm not trying to strip you of your salvation what i'm trying to say if you know you've got to go farther go further don't stop don't stop until you know that he's in you see that's the greatest revelation a man or woman could ever have to know that i am in i am in him and he is in me hallelujah glory to god hallelujah when aaron went into the there in the holy place in the holies of holies a man who lived in there lived in perfection all the time the manner was fresh it didn't dry up neither did it get contaminated and if you ever get into a place where you can be so hid away in god until the outside world is dead and the veils drops over you'll see what i mean if you can then you'll see what i mean when the veil says you uh uh from the outside world was you ever so lost in christ so so pray through unto the world you had no more to do with and all you walked humbly every day before christ loving him first that's what you need them on the inside eating manna hallelujah well i don't heard that message before that attitude you never heard it you never heard it it never grows old whoa somebody help me here i'm almost done i'm almost done i'ma cut it because i i didn't know i had gone so worse so long but i understand but if if we walk and that's why we can't walk just in the seventh age the light of the seventh days we got to go further and and this is what gets me people of god and and i'm going to close you know we're supposed to come to divine love that's something you cannot mimic you can't make it up it is only something that god can give you y'all understand me divine love is never puffed up never behave yourselves unseemly divine love never seek its own huh y'all know how it is in church somebody want to be seen that ain't divine love well i gotta give well you ain't the only one and my point is we put things in places where we shouldn't and you know what you got to die and rot people none of us know how to do that but god will lead you if you ask him to he will lead you you understand me so we're coming to a place and i'm telling you in order for the life i'm talking about and the way this message is preached in order for that to come into you you've got to die and rot because nothing can live until that seed die and rot that's that's that's nature even teaches us that is that hallelujah oh it's the truth ain't nobody gonna tell me how to dress i don't even know why i went there but i'ma tell you with that attitude you still lives because if you had the holy ghost nobody will have to tell you the holy ghost will show you what is holiness hallelujah y'all understand me that's why when people be on tv or wherever they are shaking and jumping and hallelujah speaking in tongues and everything and half naked they ain't got no holy ghost maybe on the flesh maybe on the spirit a little bit you know but not in the soul oh come on somebody yeah you know like i said this is worship if it's true speak to god this is communion y'all understand that church is a place of communion when you're fellowshipping and communion with god you don't sit there let him do all the talking you know just like say like they said to brother brother one time brother why don't you say you know brother said to a brother why don't you say something he said how can i in other words you're doing all the talking how can i get a word in sometimes you almost got to be rude break on in there right fellowshipping is not just with you alone telling all your stuff it's remember i said the other day amen we're talking about sitting at the table the table is before prepared for me in the face of my enemy this is where i want to bring i want to say this the other day and i forgot that's why we see what's happening we are face to face with our enemy and in that time being this is the first time where we can see the enemy coming we know it's coming we're face to face with it and even at that time he anoints us god ain't gonna let you face the enemy without him he's the one that's battling he's my battle axe he's the captain of the lord's host y'all understand me he's the one that's battling but he is that anointing amen oh come on somebody is that right i need he's a shekinah i need that anointing i need that revelation of who he is whatever i gotta go through to understand who he is so let it be lord i gotta have him not in my head but in my heart anoint me lord make me like david that no matter how big the giant is i know the giants got to fall hallelujah you understand me no matter how great amen the giants may be and that's what joshua and caleb saw and all the other ten spies came back we can't do it it looked like we can't do it it looked like we can't do it but we've got god he's my rock brother he's the same yesterday today and forever he is a god that changes not know this that the lord is on your side know this that he's made you more than a conqueror know this no evil shall come now your dwelling place when the devil comes in let's stand the bible says god lifts up a standard and he has adoring ordain you to be the standard right sisters don't be discouraged when you see these these girls all all walking and talking like jesse's you know what i mean you don't need to be dressed and all sexy keep your holiness if you really got holiness inside show it on the outside right oh you can't judge my heart i don't have to the sign tells me that's a liquor store huh that's the way it is let me tell you those of you who don't have the holy ghost you need to start confessing it you need to stop believing it well i'm not worthy you'll never be worthy the holy ghost is a gift but you got to at least know that the gift is for you you want the sealing of god you got to confess it you got to confess perfection i'm perfect in jesus i am the bride of christ you got to confess it you got to speak it that that's that's where you got to be and even if you're not there that angel has been ordained to take you there hallelujah lord look at this look at this even when they most faulty but they still claim they're yours you love the lord god is so good to us oh my amazing grace shall always be my song of praise for it was grace we can read it close that caught my liberty i'll never know just how he came to love me so he looked beyond all of my force and saw my knee i shall forever lift mine eyes to calvary to view the cross where jesus died [Music] [Music] soul he looked beyond all of my faults and saw my knee can y'all sing that with me as praise and grace shall always be my song do you feel the presence it was
