[34:29] bit about
[34:31] he saw you coming
[34:35] god saw you coming he saw you coming
[34:41] and because he saw you coming
[34:44] he prepared a way for you
[34:48] god saw you coming and because he saw
[34:51] you coming
[34:52] he prepared a way for you
[34:55] now
[34:59] in the book of hebrews 7.
[35:05] god saw you coming and he prepared a way
[35:08] for you
[35:10] maybe i'll just talk to you a little bit
[35:11] this morning i don't know
[35:14] if i preach or not but he saw you coming
[35:18] amen
[35:20] god knew your steps are numbered your
[35:22] bounds you cannot pass
[35:25] we like to thank the lord for all the
[35:27] graduates
[35:29] god bless you and we just thank god for
[35:32] you achieving your course amen and when
[35:36] you go on to do great things for
[35:38] the lord and accomplish the goals that
[35:41] you're set out to do
[35:42] amen god bless you
[35:48] he says hebrews 7
[35:51] and 9 it says and
[35:58] excuse me and i like to say um
[36:03] um i thank you all for reaching out to
[36:06] us
[36:07] concerning our brother robert passed
[36:10] away and it's
[36:12] brother from sumpter and he's they
[36:16] asked to have the funeral here so
[36:19] we're accommodating the family
[36:23] it's a possibility to be saturday at 11.
[36:26] so you should pray for the simmons
[36:29] family
[36:31] thank you for reaching out
[36:34] okay as we go a little further he says
[36:37] in the ninth verse
[36:38] he says as many
[36:43] and as i may say
[36:46] levi also who received tithes
[36:50] paid tithes in abraham
[36:55] now this is the catch to it for
[36:58] he was
[37:02] yet in the lungs of his father
[37:06] when metcasade met him
[37:10] now he hadn't been born yet but he paid
[37:13] tithes
[37:15] and this is just uh uh showing you that
[37:19] they meant what abraham did
[37:24] it was reckoned to levi
[37:28] levi did it
[37:31] and that takes me back to realize
[37:36] uh he saw you coming and because god saw
[37:40] you coming
[37:41] he prepared a way for you
[37:44] here in revelation 13
[37:48] 8 god saw you coming and because he saw
[37:52] you coming he prepared a way for you
[37:54] now it's not to everyone the bible says
[37:57] in revelation he that has an ear
[37:59] to hear let him hear what the spirit
[38:01] says to the church
[38:03] if you got an ear to hear you can hear
[38:06] but if you don't have an ear to hear
[38:08] it doesn't you cannot hear amen
[38:11] but he that has an ear to hear let him
[38:13] hear what the spirit says to the church
[38:16] i said he saw you coming and you must
[38:19] take it personal
[38:20] as they said it's a personal experience
[38:23] so you as an individual must take the
[38:26] word of god personally
[38:27] that god was able to see you coming

[38:47] him and already ordained him
[38:48] to be a prophet are you with me

[39:01] your head because of the numbers of your
[39:03] head

[51:18] so by the grace of god at
[51:22] first peter uh 1 and 18
[51:27] he says for as much as you
[51:31] know that ye were not redeemed
[51:34] with corruptable things as silver and
[51:36] gold from your vain
[51:38] conversation received by the tradition
[51:42] of your fathers
[51:43] it don't matter somebody told me just a
[51:45] while ago
[51:47] that uh my mama was a baptist my daddy
[51:51] was a baptist so
[51:54] i was inviting him out to church and he
[51:56] said well you know
[51:57] my mama was the baptist my daddy was a
[51:59] baptist i'm looking for
[52:01] a church but you know
[52:04] i ain't got nothing against the
[52:05] pentecostal people well uh my mama was
[52:08] about to daddy was the baptist that i
[52:09] reckon i'd be a baptist
[52:12] i said well you get an opportunity to
[52:13] come by and visit us anyhow
[52:15] praise god isn't that right i said i
[52:18] remember my mama said
[52:20] my mama was the baptist right mama was a
[52:22] baptist and i'd be a baptist
[52:24] well something got a hold to it one day
[52:26] she didn't worry about the baptist no
[52:28] more she just wanted
[52:29] god she wanted that baptism of the holy
[52:33] ghost
[52:34] so forget about who what mama was and
[52:36] grandmother was
[52:37] i need jesus i need the holy ghost
[52:46] she forgot about what my aunt was
[52:47] witnessing her about
[52:49] being baptized in water in the name of
[52:51] jesus christ and receiving the baptism
[52:53] of the holy ghost
[52:55] amen she had to forget about that
[52:59] grandmama and mama and all the latin
[53:02] she had to do what the word tradition
[53:04] vain traditions
[53:06] amen praise god we got to see what the
[53:09] words say about it
[53:11] even one day she came to grips with the
[53:13] word
[53:15] and obama followed the word praise god
[53:19] and after being praised god in a certain
[53:23] persuasion one day we came and showers
[53:26] so that god had to provide a way for
[53:28] this day
[53:30] and she said i have to leave even there
[53:32] to come
[53:33] for what god has provided for us in this
[53:36] day
[53:37] praise god at the evening time there
[53:39] shall be light
[53:40] and oh god so as you see the light you
[53:45] shouldn't walk in it
[53:46] for the path of the justice that the
[53:48] shining light was shining more and more
[53:50] to the perfect day
[53:51] as you see the word you begin to walk in
[53:54] the word
[53:55] amen you you just can't say well i'm
[53:57] gonna stop
[53:58] as you see the light keep walking in the
[54:00] light while you have the light walk in
[54:02] the light
[54:03] praise god uh mama what mama's going oh
[54:06] grandma
[54:07] uh-uh well you see the word walk in the
[54:10] word
[54:15] okay it says here okay
[54:18] but in the 19th verse but with the
[54:21] precious blood of christ
[54:22] as a lamb without blemish and without
[54:26] spot
[54:26] don't that sound like somebody else the
[54:30] church
[54:30] that without spot rank or blemish or any
[54:33] such thing
[54:34] but this lamb that was slain the reason
[54:38] why the church could be
[54:40] amen a church without spot without
[54:42] blemish
[54:43] without amen the reason why the church
[54:48] could be like that
[54:49] is because somebody prepared the way
[54:52] that the church could be like that
[54:56] are you with me the church could be not
[54:58] be without spot without blemish
[55:01] amen except somebody except the lamb
[55:05] was slain without the lamb being saved
[55:09] praise god there is no redemption
[55:15] without the shelling of blood there is
[55:17] no remission of sin
[55:20] except jesus had died we would
[55:23] not have a way to get to god
[55:27] but jesus said i am the way
[55:30] the truth and the life
[55:34] no man can come to the father but by me
[55:37] brother and sister that's a way to amen
[55:39] that god has provided
[55:41] for this day amen praise god
[55:45] and then he says here he says
[55:51] that the lamb without spot i mean
[55:54] without blemish and without spot
[55:56] who verily was what 20 verse who verily
[55:59] was what
[56:01] for ordain now god started all this
[56:05] in the mind of god slain before the
[56:08] foundation of the world
[56:10] so all of this was done now after it was
[56:14] done
[56:15] peter was speaking of it and he's trying
[56:17] to tell you
[56:18] amen this just didn't start when jesus
[56:21] came and died on the cross
[56:23] it was already done in the mind of god
[56:26] before the foundation of the world amen
[56:30] you just didn't know amen that you were
[56:32] sons and daughters of god
[56:34] you didn't know that then because you
[56:36] didn't come into
[56:38] beings amen you only thought
[56:41] you were only a seed leave i was only a
[56:44] gene
[56:45] seed amen in abraham but one day levi

[56:51] amen so god in abraham
[56:54] paying tithe to mecca deck amen wrecking
[56:58] it and to on
[56:59] leave our behalf and because what jesus
[57:03] did

[57:08] he reckoned it on your behalf your
[57:12] father took care of you
[57:15] he made proficient for you hey

[57:23] million dollars

[1:14:14] to go beyond the curtains of time
[1:14:17] he knew you need that amen so god made
[1:14:20] provision through
[1:14:21] the preaching of the word that we are
[1:14:23] are called to a higher standard than
[1:14:25] that of the world
[1:14:28] then that other system of the amen just
[1:14:30] going to church in tradition we're
[1:14:32] called to a higher standard

[1:14:35] father which is in heaven is perfect
[1:14:37] amen praise god you the love in spite of
[1:14:41] not because you say you love because

[1:15:03] them
[1:15:04] and they plan on doing nothing for them
[1:15:06] to let something happen to them
[1:15:09] man they go head over shoulder to do for
[1:15:11] them
[1:15:12] a lot of brother or sister that that uh
[1:15:15] that said something to them

[1:15:29] the devil working
[1:15:31] among the people trying to divide the
[1:15:33] people up
[1:15:35] oh you're a man so it's
[1:15:38] folks are so sensitive when it comes
[1:15:40] down to the church
[1:15:41] but it comes down to their natural
[1:15:43] family they
[1:15:44] all had over shoulder with that
[1:15:48] oh they don't see no fault
[1:15:56] the prophet god said if you're looking

[1:22:09] there
[1:22:10] he didn't make a mistake amen
[1:22:13] and you must recognize that amen
[1:22:17] that i god is my father and i i'm a son
[1:22:21] and i'm a daughter of god
[1:22:24] not because i heard my sheep hear my
[1:22:27] voice
[1:22:28] because i heard the voice of my god
[1:22:31] he said no man can come to me except the
[1:22:33] father was in heaven drawing
[1:22:35] and god draws you amen through a holy
[1:22:38] calling

[1:23:00] you heard his voice
[1:23:02] amen he told saul
[1:23:05] it is hard to kick against the priest
[1:23:08] isn't that right
[1:23:10] you all know what duckies do
[1:23:13] the muse i mean excuse the mules do
[1:23:16] a lot of dunking but a mew it's a hybrid
[1:23:19] thing
[1:23:20] it'll kick you you got to watch out for
[1:23:23] that mule
[1:23:25] come on amen a mule kick you
[1:23:29] amen i remember the man used to come and
[1:23:31] apply the garden he
[1:23:32] had a mule strong right
[1:23:36] they'll work in the church they'll work
[1:23:38] hard
[1:23:40] but once they crossed up between a
[1:23:42] dunking and a horse
[1:23:43] they meant they ain't a horse
[1:23:49] and they're not a donkey there's a mule
[1:23:51] there's a hybrid thing
[1:23:53] and they can't re they can't bring forth
[1:23:55] life
[1:23:56] are you with me so no matter how hard

[1:24:21] word and they got new religion they work
[1:24:23] hard
