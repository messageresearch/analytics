and tonight certainly appreciate everyone brother carl brother jeremiah brother earnest ministers of the gospel appreciate all of y'all let us just about father in jesus name thank you for the lord blessing us again to come together what a time when god children come together it's a blessing when two or three are gathered in his name sit there i'll be in the midst father we welcome your presence tonight father surely amen it's good for us to be here for where the lord the spirit of the lord is there's liberty so father god thank you for the liberty that you've given us in christ jesus lord may you bless those on the proudly slaughter touch lives touch hearts god supply needs father whatever oh god requests are god surely god you a god that answers and hears prayer bless your people tonight bless your word in jesus christ's name amen we want to continue from continuation from sunday morning and um i want to remind everybody prayer would be moved up the lord swelling from five o'clock to four o'clock on saturday so if you come to prayer and you used to come and it'd be from four to five instead of five to six okay on saturday god bless um romans 6 as we were reading there it says what shall we say then shall we continue and sin that grace from our bound god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin and living along with the end no you're not that so many of us as we're baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death therefore we'll bury him by baptism into death that life is christ has risen up rates raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his what knowing this that our old man is what crucified with him that the body of sin might be what destroyed and that henceforth we should not what for he that is is free from amen god bless the reading towards you may be seated i just want to you know what says um what does the resurrection mean to each and every one of us amen and we said the resurrection to us means that death has been defeated amen and that death has been defeated the bible says uh the day that they touch or eat of the tree of knowledge and good and evil that's the day that died so death entered in because of sin and sin amen death is a result of sin disobedience to god's word amen and we cannot get around amen and when we disobey god's word then death sets in are you with me so there are many people that are disobedient to god's word that are still walking around dead but they they don't have the knowledge that they're dead now ephesian i kind of quoted that but let's go to ephesians 2 and let's just look at that um death has been defeated tonight death has been defeated so we want to take it from a standpoint to slow it down and kind of let you look at it from a teaching standpoint death has been defeated now the world you know look at it and and the bible talks about the second death but the bible said blessing is he holy is he that has part in the first resurrection for in the second death there's no power are you with me so maybe we'll look there and let you see that there is another death cause of second death and the second death is the lake of fire so there's a lake of fire amen that will accomplish if we leave this world amen that's not the end that's just the beginning that's just the beginning of your trip even into eternity or your trip into um he said if we love the lord we should not perish but have everlasting life to appointed time that god will actually take those into judgment and they have to pay for their sins because they did not accept jesus christ payment for their sin so they have to pay for their sins because they did not receive amen jesus christ paying for their sins are you with me so we either choose to accept what jesus did for us are we are going to pay for everything that we've ever done are you with me so ephesians 2 he says here it says and he has and you now you that means me and you has he what quicken that means he's bought a lie amen you has he quickened he's made us alive are you with me now as we quote romans uh 8 and 11 he said if the spirit to raise jesus up from the dead y'all want to look at it and maybe y'all want to look at it because romans 8 and 11 as we look look at this uh and i was in um kentucky i was talking about quickening power so you has a quicken who was dead in trespass in sin okay now here in romans 8 11 he says what at the spirit of him that raised what jesus from the dead what dwell where see brother and sister it's it's a it's a point that if the spirit to raise jesus from the dead if it dwell in you it shall also what by his spirit that dwells in you so that that's your rapture in faith your rapture and power is going to alive what's inside of you if you don't have the quicken power a lot of people go to church and they're religious it's got a lot of religious people a lot of people pray and say their prayers are answered and all kind of things that go on in their lives and they and truly you know sometimes it looks like their prayers might be answered before yours and um they can claim you know and they can curse they can smoke they can drink they can lie they can steal they can cheat they can fornicate adultery and all of that and they pray and their prayers answered so you said brother how how can you explain that the bible tells us the range falls on the jets and the unjust amen and the bible says god here is not a sinner amen and god says because of your iniquities i won't hear your prayers and yet they praying and things happen for she said well explain that i'm not going to explain that i know the word of god is right what god said in his word amen is right because of our nickname because our sin god said he hide his face from us he said when he when we pray he won't answer but yet they tree for praying yet they say their prayers answered yet god has mercy on so what is it the bible said if you have faith and not doubt in your heart see faith caused god to move faith causes god to move when a person have faith in perhaps that god would hear their prayer and they have faith in what when they pray that god will move or never have just a person walking in faith that's part of the word that they that's what they claim and that's what they walk in that part of the world they believe they got faith and they believe amen if i pray god asks them yet look at their lives see because jesus said many don't come to me in that day so lord let me cast out devils you've done many wonderful works in your name you're going to set it apart from me your work is of what i don't even know you isn't that right so you know the word the word got an answer to all these different situations but we don't want to take time out trying to explain amen because people feel confident and feel so saved and and yet they they they don't see no reason to stop sinning amen because they've been blessing their sins are you with me but thank me to god he's he's he's given us conviction he's given us a heart amen that we want to live right we want to do right amen we don't want to take advantage of god's grace amen that's what he said what shall we uh uh say then should we continue in sin that what grace may abound god forbid how should we the dead to sin living and longer what they're in amen we don't want to keep on living in sin and taking advantage of god's grace amen you know you know uh mama and daddy might you know if if you keep on you know being bad and getting in trouble and then getting you out of trouble or paying your bills for you or doing this for you and then you and sometimes okay you gonna waste your money up mama mama damn my life's about to get caught up daddy daddy and they have a little grace keep on having grace on one of these times they said do i get tired coming to mama daddy you know the children ain't got no need and what mama might feel sorry for the children and you know daddy might feel children for children or something but it's a time where grace run out on you mama is not there for you that is not for that they're for you there's a time when god's grace may run out on you amen god tells you not to do that amen and mama might tell you don't don't don't spend your money foolish just don't do this don't do that daddy might tell you be wise son be wise daughter amen but we don't want to be wise so what happens when mama don't have it no more daddy don't have it no more then you in trouble then isn't that right so what happens if either we come to reality amen should we amen stop and and and do right and do the things that we know amen that's going to bless us and amen going to help us even be comfortable in this world amen but we're talking about eternal life we're talking about going to heaven amen okay now we i guess we got romans we're back in the ephesians it says when in time past you walk according to the course of this world amen it was dead in trespassing sin and in time past you walk according to the course of this world excuse me according to the go to this world cup according to the prince and power and i have the spirit that now worketh in the children disobedient now when we were there we were disobedient children you know what i'm saying disobedient to what this would reading to god's word we were disobedient to god's word now god always he tells us if we be disobedient children god's going to chastise us isn't that right see because if you belong to god god's going to bring chastisement so it's going to be a minute that are chastised because they're disobedient and there's going to be obedient children that god said thank you you know this is my beloved son in whom i'm well please i'm pleased to dwell in amen oftentimes god said i'll never leave you neither will i forsake you but many times folk leave god it's not that god left them they left god god cannot abide with you when you're doing wrong because god see and that's what people got to understand god can't stay with you if you're doing wrong well god you're whipped me with me in the nightclub what you're in adultery is like what you ain't listening with you no no amen god is with the righteous god is a holy god god is a righteous god god is a just god amen god is not with he's angry with the wicked every day okay so by the grace of god let us just um death has been defeated romans uh i mean let's go to um first corinthians 15 first corinthians 15 and 20. i think i left off there a little bit he says and now has christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept you know many times the people's quote the wave sheet often that was waved over the uh uh the people the first one to come to maturity was uh the prophet no the first one came to maturity with jesus christ are you with me and the one that was waving over the people amen it was jesus christ are you with me and you find about 90 80 and 90 percent of the people don't you know they give too much honor you know wait are you with me jesus was the first fruit of the resurrection are you with me so you got to listen closely because you'll be amen and you'll be shouting off the wrong stuff i see the people ah they're shouting off the wrong stuff the bible says studies show yourself or what approve it to god or what we need not to read what shame amen because the persons sound like they know what they're talking about you know i'm saying sometimes we get caught up but we need to be you know i'm not saying don't say amen don't say hallelujah amen but you got to be keen enough to know what when a person is telling you something wrong okay he said he was the first and become the first fruit of them to slap nobody else jesus christ are you what man it says for since by man came death and by man came also what the resurrection y'all see that 21st verse 15 15. for since my man came what death by man came also what resurrection jesus said i am the resurrection and what he delivered and believe in me should never never die isn't that right see that's what your confidence is in you know if if you believe in him and you really trust god amen he's your savior he's your heel but the devil every day he's trying to you know wiggle his stuff into your life and have you doing stuff that he meant ungodly stuff things that wrong things that but i said death has been amen the devil is defeated amen but you got to recognize you got to have enough faith to believe that you don't have to be a sinner you don't have to be doing all of this devilish stuff your flesh love it but you got the doctor of self he said reckon yourself to be dead under sin but alive unto righteousness amen you got to want to die amen for jesus sake amen because he's got something better for me amen the resurrection is for me the rapture is mine i want it praise god i need jesus praise god hallelujah it don't matter what the world gives you it won't satisfy your soul amen it'll only last for a little season but the word can't find place in some folk because they don't want the word amen they like amen they said away with him crucify him kill him amen that's what folks are saying to the word today i can't live it i don't want it i want sin they said give us barabbas we'll take the rabbits give me barabbas that's what i want don't give me jesus you want a murderer in his place amen crucify jesus and that's what we say to the word the word comes to give us peace joy and happiness but we don't want it we believe the devil will have pledge and sin for a season are you a man don't let the devil fool you don't let the green grass fool you don't let the devil lie to you and make you a sinner when salvation is free in whom the sun set free is free indeed there's a life right here for you amen where the spirit of the lord is there's a liberty praise god i'm so glad god saved me i don't feel that like i missed out on nothing some young folk think they're missing out on life but i'm missing out on death praise god because then nothing good no good thing that the devil could offer you amen all good and perfect gifts come from above are you with me that's why paul said that it in me that is in my flesh dwellings no good thing are you with me so i'm a no good thing how about you i'm a no good thing he said well uh and that's what's the matter we want to we want self glory that's why we're medicine or humble yourself you know it's got to be a cross before there got to be a death before there's the resurrection somebody got to die amen if you want a resurrection something got to be dead so you got to die to yourself not of your will not my will but let your will be done in my life you got to want it now you got to want it it just can't be something that i come and listen to the word and come to church but i got to amen it's got to come down in my soul it's got to be something bubbling amen that's why david said that word have i what i hear in my heart that i might not what oh god amen something that's real inside me something that's alive the word of god is quick it's powerful it's alive sharpening it is true as the sword i got something that's real amen i got god that even he started me he brought about a change in my life amen yes i was wicked yes i was a sinner yes i did wrong things but thank god he saved me i'm glad to be saved amen i'm glad i got seen when i was a young man amen he could have let me drown amen but love lifted me but he could have let me drown how about you brother sister do you feel like he could have let you cry amen but instead amen i'm so glad he picked me up see brother and sister we got to take advantage of god's grace for us and what he says suffering is dying and let it not be in vain amen but it can't register it can't ratchet to the because the lord have mercy i wish i could say it like i want to say it but i'm in the pulpit i can't say it amen but some kind of way not not no natural sense but spiritual understanding got to come in somebody because somebody amen has locked jesus out of their life and they won't listen to parents they won't listen to god and god trying to talk to them and they can't hear god's voice they're not listening to god i'm saying somebody ought to hear god by man came also the resurrection of dead 22 says for in what for in adam all died are you with me we were born like i said again we were born in sin shaping any nicotine sin that our mother conceded us amen so we all born sinners somebody said well you you wasn't born a liar yes she was you wasn't born this way that way i and i don't you know people say well oh they were born like that some folks are all kind of things people were born like that it was the nature that was in their parents came in them and then it might have skipped over it wasn't in their parents but it was in their grandparents and it skipped over somebody dropped on somebody you see certain spirits run through families those spirits run through families because those a generation generational curses and they run amen it might jump over somebody it might be a whole family and it might catch two or three and you know so a lot of times things happen and you say wonder why somebody's you know i tell people the things that you do it may not affect you but it could affect your children because they asked a blind man who in my parents who sinned this man or his parents are you with me so sometimes the things that we go through amen we're not going through because it's something we've done it's something somebody else done but we got to go through it that's why it's good for us to be saved and do the right thing and live the right way because our children might be suffering because of something we've done are you with me so the choices that you make you need to make the right choice if you want to be a blessing to your children don't say you you can say well i'm going to leave them so many thousands maybe a quarter of a million dollars but leave them leave them a life a life that you live where the blessings of god will be on abraham and his seed after him amen on his children children command blessings amen praise god command blessings uh amen i'm gonna bless abraham and i'm a blessed seed because i know he would teach his children he would guide his children right are you with me so i'm gonna bless him and i'm a blessed seed amen amen thank god for godly parents and godly amen grandmamas and granddads and people that would guide you in the right way amen amen so you might be living off somebody else's inheritance amen the only reason god having mercy on you because somebody else prayed somebody said my mama prayed for me had me on a mine took the time and prayed for me amen it says for an adam all died so i didn't have a choice it didn't do it no i didn't do it somebody said i wouldn't ate up that tree it was too late now amen you didn't need but you got to pay for it because you're born that way but god didn't leave us like that as he gave them free moral asian and they could choose life for death they chose death are you open then you can choose life or death you can choose whether you want to be a christian when you want to live for god or you you look out in the world look at these people killing one another all over the place uh people are you know look at them look at them tattooing itself all up they're sticking stuff in the ears the nose and oh god lord have mercy they're actually you know the lid is taken off of hell and coming on the earth and people are actually my cousin was telling me about a little place in philadelphia if you go down in that area the people are just like zombies the whole area people look like they're dead walking zombies an actual brother that gave his testimony the other week he's from philadelphia too he says they give out the free uh drugs in that area and the people just stuck down and you just see just hundreds and all the whole area people just walk around look like i said lord you were showing me around philadelphia but i ain't too much want to go there how many of you would like to go visit anybody want to visit there but if god mercy don't be on us in this world this whole world gonna look like that they're gonna be in such a terrible shape such bad shame that people gonna actually look like they're dead and they're gonna be spaced out but you can escape you can escape you don't have to be a victim like that and i tell you that that's that's going to be a place that you can see if you're so zoned out you could hear people probably ministering or doing it'll take god to zone you in again it's almost like they don't forgot about y'all the world has forgot about y'all y'all just here it's just like the untouchables like leprosy y'all y'all done gone in another dimension y'all already in that dimension for a person to escape that area it's it's the grace of god for anybody to get out and god's grace is here for you that you don't have to experience those things but you know sometimes we want to experience those things and think we're going to get back out of it god bless he said in adam all died even so in christ shall all be what in christ all shall be made alive see the harvest that we got i said death has been defeated death sin has been defeated sin should not have what dominion what over you sent you romans 6 says sin should not have dominion over sin shall not rule amen sin should not have you in bondage and slavery shall not have dominion over you are you a man you don't have to you don't have to do these things do you want to do right how many want to do right amen sin and none of those young people raised their hand how many they want to do right okay i see the hands now because they know they don't want to do right they say they don't want the other young person to see you if they lift it up too high because i don't see it's a will it's a wonder it's a little shame there i want to do right but i don't know i'm kind of confused i'm in a state of confusion i want to do right but i don't know how you know you know sometimes you've been a teenager too you want to do right but it's so much out here and so much pulling you so many things so you want to do right you want to go to heaven you want to live right you want to do right you don't want to get caught on drugs you don't want to go to jail you don't want to get your life all messed up you don't want it's a lot of things you don't want but do you know if you don't get god the devil got a trap set for you he's going he's going to cause bad things to happen to your life you said i'll never be like that what's going to keep you from being like that what's going to stop you what what what do you have that the others didn't it's a lot more intelligent people a lot more uh people that had good families good parents they meant daddies were sometimes pastors and preachers and they made good people raised right and all of that but because they didn't make the right choice when god was calling they didn't even warn him praise god well i see other folks you know they may they still you know dibbling dabbling and they steal this and that amen but you amen god gives you the opportunity to enjoy him to live for him to save you from a lot of the stuff he gives you that opportunity brother and sister you got to make the best you got to make a decision for your own self what's best for my life what's best for my soul i got to make my decision i can't base my decision off what others do i got to make my own decision that i want to live for god i love the lord i know he died for me and lord i appreciate what you've done lord you're good to me lord amen you woke me up i believe that's why i'm woke up that's why you keeping me lord you're watching over me i could have been sick my mind could have been gone amen all kinds of things could have been happening in my life but lord thank you for blessing my family blessing my home blessing my children lord you good to me you're good to me praise god i got no reason to hate the lord amen i got a reason to serve him amen i got a reason to serve him i got a reason to praise him i got a reason praise god because god is good i tasted it and i see that the lord is good he says in christ shall all be made alive amen so so by the grace of god i want to drop down uh too and adam all died and in christ should all be made alive and he says here in uh the 24th verse then 24th first then come at the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father and when he shall have put down all rules and all authority and all pop for he must reign till he has put all what all enemies where i'm gonna tell you something christ must reign he's reigning now he's reigning in my life until he has put all enemies under his feet amen then in the 26th verse he said do what i said the resurrection shows that death has been what the last enemy that shall be destroyed is what death spiritually amen you died spiritually amen and you made a lie by the baptism of the holy ghost isn't that right but this flesh here this last enemy because he still is a wall going on isn't that right your flesh amen there's a battle there's a wall going on the greatest battle ever fought you're still fighting am i right but the last enemy amen no more this flesh is going to fool you deceive you or try to come against you amen this flesh wants you to want to be pacified it won't be nourished it wants to feed on the things of the devil because why it was a disobedient spirit that brought this flesh into being amen that's why amen it only it's going to be around here for a season for a little while amen so this flesh here amen this body of flesh amen so it's going to be around here and it's going to as long as we have this this body amen as you know there's a natural man and there's a spiritual man amen he said put on the new man and put off oh man so there's spirits that goes that the old man lives off of amen their spirit what in the last days they'd be lovers of themselves they'd be truth breakers they'd be haters you know one another and they'll be oh god oh the works of the flesh of these i can get into galatians and so forth and deal with the works of the flesh but the works of the flesh it's all these things those things come with sin and come with the fall come with the old man people when you've got an old man on you're gonna you're gonna lie you're gonna steal you're gonna cheat you're gonna commit fornication you're gonna commit adultery you're gonna do all kind of unknowled stuff because that's the workshop of the flesh and when you walk in the flesh you're going to do the works of the flesh you're going to try to please the flesh but if you walk in the spirit you're going to try to please the things that be of god are you with me so when you when there's flesh die then you're no longer trying to please the flesh you're not trying to when the old man died and been crucified with christ then you want the new man to live are you with me then you want to please god is that simplified do we understand that but you it's got to come down in you as a will and i won't you got the will and want this you got to want god amen you got to realize the devil is your enemy he's your wife he's your enemy do you believe that shake somebody's hand asked me do you believe the devil is your enemy because i don't believe you that he you you call him friend amen but the devil is your enemy amen the last enemy what caused sin sin you can't love sinning if you love sin then you love you the devil because that's what eve amen she trusted in what the devil said and then versus what god had said he said yeah he has god said and then he said god know you're gonna know good and evil and the day you eat of you you won't die and that's what the devil tells you all the time you'll get right you're going to have your fun now you young you you this your dad and a lot of times he gets over on us i know he got over on me the devil the devil really fooled me until god opened my eyes and i i believe every young person in here want to be saved and want to go to heaven but the devil he'll talk your idea of this he talked eve in the yeah yeah you see you see she said yeah i see it it's good it's blessed to die oh yeah you know and that's what the devil does he gets you with the eyes he'll get you with you know facebook and instagram i don't know what i'm talking about but you know what i'm talking about y'all know what he'd get you with and he'll woo you and he'll grab you make you feel like you know you important what's the devil get through with you you know what i'm saying and mess your life up and then you say oh lord i'm sorry get sorry now don't wait till the devil doesn't mess you all up defeat and then all of a sudden lord help me jesus the lord already done died for your sins he's already gave you a way of escape so why why let the devil beat you up when you can serve god most of our troubles is we won't make the right decision most of our problems that we go through is that we won't make the right decision things will be so much easier and god will give you so much better understanding for life and for yourself and god would help you to be even standing together and be a witness once you free and once you love god then you want others to know the love of god and know the peace that you have and the joy that you have but when you when you kind of holding back and you can't tell others that amen that god jesus is the answer look at you know i i just believe if young people just really told people that you know the lord loved them that they wouldn't turn to gang violence they wouldn't turn to this they won't turn to that it's because they're winning satisfied with god if you're not excited to invite with god then how can you bring somebody else to the lord you can't bring them to the lord and lessen you because these oh but through the prize of of others sometimes you protect it but it's time when you wake up because if you keep just drifting drifting you drift too far after a while okay last enemy that shall be destroyed is death are you with me for he has put all things under his feet but when he says all things are put unto him it is manifested that he is what accepted which did put all things under him and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things unto him that god may be what all in all okay i'm gonna skip over some things let's go to the 51st verse it says behold i show you a mystery we should not all sleep and that means we all won't stay in the grave we should not all sleep but we shall be what change we should not all die we do not all sleep you said my our friend ladders is sleeping and and the disciples said if he sleep lord he do as well he said ladarius is dead and i'm going to awake him that's what jesus told him isn't that right and it got there it was four days and ladders was stinking in the grave but jesus said ladders is sleeping you re that's why he said whosoever believed in him should never die we don't die we just sleep and the thing is when so you may have a funeral and you know home going or whatever it's just because in this life here we won't see them we won't be able to fellowship with them right now but they sleeping and they'll be in a better place because they just went to sleep for a little while but you can join them amen you join them if they live for god and they trusted god and they gave jesus christ their life then you can see them again are you with me but if you don't you'll never see them again are you with me [Music] you know i wonder who said that to me i'm trying to think somebody says that okay let me go and i can't remember the story he says in in a moment in the twinkling of an eye that's how fast it's going to be but in order for god to change us in the moment in the twinkling of an eye we're going to have to have the holy ghost we're going to have to have the quickening power if you ain't got it you can't just also oh the lord coming i've got to get holy ghost quick no somebody come and they doing that uh shooting in the mall and you can say oh jesus i jesus no too late then any joy too late and they tell me joe was in the mall when they were shooting amen but they could have shot joy joey's all right i call your name because i want you to get mad at me but uh see what i'm saying you don't know when something can come your way amen you don't know what what can happen in life could it happen so quick so fast you know what i'm saying and i'm saying that's why we got to be ready that's why we gotta have the holy ghost that's why we gotta have the power of god that's why we gotta know god when you get up in the morning you gotta say thank you jesus from watching over his lord will you keep me this day let your blood cover letting the angels watch over keep me jesus amen keep me jesus walk with me lord amen watch over me jesus don't just jump in the car true i gotta go you know let's just okay it says the last trump for the trump should sign and the dead should be uh raised incorruptible and we shall be what change see we're not going to keep these same bodies here these are corruptable bodies these bodies here can decay and can rotten but the body that god got for us it's a it's a new body a theophany body body that jesus walks he walked through the door amen so but we have we'll look this you know we can look like we look now as a young man probably 19 years old or whatever 20. and nobody would be old everybody be young we got old because of sin brother fred because it's sin that's how you got greyhound your hair would have stayed black are you with me and foot gets you i mean your steps get shot and all kind of things start happening because why it's telling you that you're going to be here forever but now nobody a thousand years would be like what one day see that's what that's what that's what god had but see no if if everybody in this world every christian everybody say they love jesus believe that that that god has a better it has something in store for them if everybody believed that you know it's just like uh job says well i'm gonna pay you um a hundred dollars an hour one of the sister says she during the covet time she's nursing she was making a hundred dollars an hour and they was working 12 hours a day sometime more than that and it was making 100 an hour and she says and she was saying did you tell the sisters down your way you can make 100 an hour i said oh goodness hundred dollars that's a lot of money but 100 hours is nothing when the streets are paid to go but i can see when somebody says uh uh this is you know somebody's giving out blessings over here or giving out this free food freed us free that god gave himself freely for us to give us eternal life freely amen we can go to a better place and have better things and better life a better city you know what's in a better country amen you know we can be proud of american people proud of the country they was raised in and i mean born in and all that but god got a better country for us thank god for america but thank god god got a better country our citizenship is in heaven for which we're looking for our savior one day we going one day we're going home to our original home the one that god had made for us before the foundation of the world god had us in this mind so i'm saying to you brother and sister make the right choice amen death has been defeated the last enemy has been destroyed amen but this body is still here and we got to go through the emotions all day because why god knows the end from the one from the beginning so exactly you still got to go through it even though it's in god's mind event time is not an essence god don't deal time is not there it's eternity amen so brother and sister when you cross over out of this world here amen you enter into eternity and into another place some ram you crossing over into a place where it's just the prophet said he could not he couldn't explain it it was sublime and i'm saying that's what god has for us that wait on him i know i didn't get into it but death has been defeated the devil is defeated it's corruptable must put on incorruption and smaller muscular immortality you with me god taking us to a better place a better home brother and sister a better place if you hold out and wait a little while longer hallelujah precious promises don't let the devil talk you out of your blessings because god got better for you soul is so beautiful amen praise god when you have one of those beautiful dreams when you have one of those badminton you said no no no no but when you have one of those beautiful dreams amen it's far beyond what we can ask or think or we can imagine in our minds god got so many blessings across the bridge god bless you let us stand so many things i want to share and maybe i'll be on this message for a little while but so many things that i just want you to look at the scripture and understand that you can take advantage of god's grace for your life make the wrong moves don't turn the wrong way make the right choice now i decided to make jesus one choice will you sing that for me
