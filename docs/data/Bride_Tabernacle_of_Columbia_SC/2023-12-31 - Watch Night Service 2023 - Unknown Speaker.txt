this way I thank God for all things God is just good I was just sitting here just now thinking that this time last year we was sitting here and praising God and and what God have done for me personally I I share it with you tonight going on 50 years ago I was just in the same neighborhood here on Monella Road where a man witnessed to me and let me know where I was and that was on my way to hell I was a lost soul and knowing about Jesus Christ but did not know him as Lord and Savior and God blessed me that day that day not in his house there I was standing there he and I went to school together here in Columbia I was still fresh out of high school and attended college and he was going to college on the GI Bill was a veteran and he and I worked together at UPS part-time and went to school fulltime together and and parted as young people did as I did I'm confessing and God's been good to me and allowed me to come on along this way but that particular day I'll never forget God allowed this man who I had gone to school with and after graduating part of company and decided to come back and look him up and see what was going on and in that point of time that he and I was separated from each other we he had accepted Christ and he shared with me his testimony and in his talking he said to me de if you continue on living the way you're living you going to burn in hell one day talk on a while longer and remember him telling me if you continue on going like you're going you going to bust H wide open not in know ugly like way but no one kind of life that he and I lived when we were in school together The Parting and the drinking and just going about carousing and doing whatever we thought we were big enough to do I left out of his house convicted but hadn't made my made my mind but on my way back to something that afternoon I always remember that spot in the road where I came to accept Jesus Christ going across that Old Bridge some probably know about it it's down now they replaced it but but it had a gir of beam across the top I don't mean to take so much time but God has been good to me and I share this with you because it's real it's true and going across that river that afternoon I remember saying to Satan because he was saying to me if you make this Choice what the guys is going to think about that you party with and carry on with and all that but about you a Christian what what they going to think about you and I remember going down the road and making my mind up and saying let them think what they want I'm going to Christ I thank God 4 I never regretted that been 40 going on 50 years ago between 40 and 50 that was in 1970 1976 I remember because I graduating 76 and between graduation and my coming to Christ got married and things just R Roll Along kind of fast for me at that point in time in life but I didn't I do not regret that choice God has been good to me and I testify to that and I'll say it until the day I die God has been good to me has been real to me and he have proven himself unto me time and time again and I was just sitting here tonight thinking this is in the same area here because he I remember him he living on monell road that's near near here right yeah and God's been God have brought me so over so many roads and so many ways I drove truck for a for a career for 18 years for one company and or One industry because the company changed hands several times doing doing that 10 your but and and seven years for myself 25 years of commercial truck driving and I'm sure I rack up millions of miles in those 25 years and still drive song But nevertheless all those years God had brought me with no chargeable accidents no serious accidents I had one accident was not that wasn't chargeable to me but I've seen so many inst in where God have brought me out because it wasn't I was such a good driver now that because God kept me and I testify to his goodness and to his keeping Powers I just ask that you continue to pray my S the Lord good so much more I can say about what God have done for me I'm ask I'm going ask my sister L Willie to give us a testimony Church in C oh you going to you want to go

you for the love of God the peace of God that passes all knowledge and understanding we pray you strengthen your people we come to glorify you we come to thank you for your goodness and your mercy for Lord bless us for this few minutes and send your anointing upon your hearts of your people inspires by your word that the same ano anointing that raised Jesus from the dead might Quicken the hearts and the minds of your people and that the word may go forth with with the power and spirit of Jesus Christ we love you now amen as we stand the book of Colossians 12 3 and 12 I won't be long tonight put on therefore as the elect of God holy bows holy and beloved vowels of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind meekness and longsuffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another and if any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body and be ye thankful and let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom and teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your heart to the Lord the Lord add a blessing to the read where you may be seated I've been kind of dealing with communion with this mercy and just kind of working with it on last Thursday and a little bit this morning but I just want to read a few things to you that the Lord inspired me a call to prayer we can do a lot of things in the church but who want to pray who are you this morning and who is Jesus Christ Jesus he is in you as much as you will let him be he is pressing trying to get into you to moving to you today and you stand off and wonder and look and gaze and hold back a little don't do that we pressing into this new year don't do that don't hold back let him have his way in you not just in worship but in your life you live in your Praises move right in the middle mid of it oh Church rise and Shake Yourself pinch yourself wake yourself up in that this hour we must be desperate or perish there's coming forth something from the Lord and I know it is it was in the land there's it's between life and death it'll pass right through you and you'll miss it it'll pass right through you and you won't see it brother sister if Jesus had to pray earnestly how much more have we got to pray earnestly if Christ the god of Heaven made flesh has made to pray earnestly then you must pray earnestly Des desperately we must cry we always hear a desperation call when thou seekest me with thine whole heart I'll hear you let us pray in desperation watch the kingdom of God I'll come upon you and I'll love you well enough that you'll pray for you and pray for me and I will say with it and effecture will fervent prayer of the righteous availeth much so God is looking for us to put on as the elect of God he's already made you the elect so now he's telling you not just put it in your spirit but put on your flesh when your flesh don't want to praise God when it don't want to get along with the neighbor the the classmate or the coworker put on as the elect of God holy bows of mercy so you got to put on kindness when you don't feel like it you got to put on kindness when you don't want to as the elect of God put on holy vows of Mercy kindness humbleness of Mind see that's what's wrong with some of us we figure we somebody but when God begin to show you his Mercy in your life and where he brought you from you can be humble and say God I thank you God I can thank you for your mercy you could have left me on the pool table you could have left me at the rra but your Sovereign Grace tonight and your mercy brought me here and it's about love the prophet of God said The more one that just love you know they rais in the church they love little but God brought you out the streets he brought you from the deepest of the sins and the pits of hell then he said one one that lovees little worship little but the one that be brought him from a muck and a myir he said they got great Praise And now when we get in a atmosphere of desperation we can praise God and say Lord I come to thank you I come to create an atmosphere that I can set the whole church on fire amen and above all these things put on charity sometime we don't want to love our neighbors but God said love the ones that hate you love the one that Did You Wrong amen as I was telling the church on this morning I said my niece my sister's daughter I got on her pretty hard living shacking up like people doing these days and I got on her so bad on the phone Ste spot andberg she started crying and she called her mom and my mama said you your brother your uncle my brother is right and for all these years I've been trying to talk to her and she been shunning me away and the Holy Spirit said now it's time to check let's get it right and I called and apologized if I did anything wrong I love you niece except my apology I called and left a voice message and I text her and the Holy Spirit came and said that's what I'm talking about you've made it right with her I might have not been wrong and sometimes the devil say you ain't did nothing wrong so you don't have to apologize but I'm telling you now this is Harvest Time and God is looking for Perfection and he's looking for divine mercy he's looking for humbleness in your heart and you can't think you somebody you're proud who you are or what you are you got to get to the point where God can be glorified and he want that thing fixed and he want it fixed by you other than that you can't go no further prophet of God went to pray for a little girl angel of God said no you can't pray for her go back and make it right you told her lie he went back and made it right and went and prayed for the young girl if God won't let him buy he's not going to let you and I buy so Church to continue to be humbleness of Mind see we can't think we somebody GRE Paul was the greatest Apostle in the Bible but yet he said I count all that I've want or all that I've learned as nothing I counted as dong that I might win Christ so ain't nothing going to hold you if you've been predestinated seed as the prophet said nothing's going to keep you from repenting and getting closer to God why because you was ordained before the foundation of the world you was in the mind of God and all God's thoughts are Eternal so repent and let's go on with God in 2024 that the power of the Resurrection might be in your ministry God bless you [Applause] power power need your power power I ain't got pain here nobody gonna get me y'all feel all right God is good amen we need his power amen okay sister I said it's my oldest sister now Sister L Wily come on let's testify while I have a chance I believe I testify while I got a chance a long meeting see 74 years now I haven't been down on a bed Affliction and I can count that as a blessing I've been in five accidents with someone and hit me in the back and on the interstate they knocked me into another car and I'm and didn't have to go in the hospital or anything I just thank God for how he blessed me through everything that I've been through all my children had been at death do but God raised them all up when the doctors gave up I said God haven't given up and if God don't say no whatever the doctor say if God don't say no you put all your faith in God and God will work it out for you cuz if you got you can't have no doubt when you go to God you got to have you got to surrender it all to him and have faith and believe that he'll bring you through anything that you go through God will bring it through he woke me up 5:00 this morning and he I couldn't go back to sleep I said well I guess it's time for me to get down here and pray CU I don't know what's going on but I pray for everybody all the family members and all the thans God and the ones that's in in the

father and all those that desire a touch tonight may you bless them in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen God is good amen we just want to read a little scripture then we'll get out of the way I told Brother Carl Pastor days he went real went real quick but God is good amen I want to look at Isaiah 60 it's something that been on my heart the last uh couple of weeks I was preaching on warning signs and then I went to the anointing false anointings and then we went to hidden messages but it was back at the the anointing this morning amen just looking at the Spirit that's the spirits that we're dealing with today the the the anointing is and the things that's on this age you know that Jesus said if it were possible to deceive the very elect right that's how close it'll be so you know it causes each and every one of us to check ourselves up daily right because the only thing that's going to going to help us to escape the wrath to come will be God and His Spirit alone to lead us through amen Isaiah 60 by the grace of God you got it say amen and it reads arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the Earth and and gross Darkness to people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee and the Gentiles shall come to thy light and the Kings to the brightness of thy raising may God a bless the reading of his word I like here we'll talk about just a little bit about gross Darkness amen I like how he was saying arise and shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee cuz he was saying here he was saying and His glory shall be seen upon thee so you know I was thinking about the the the the hour that we live in the gross Darkness I was thinking what sister Tasha was saying about how you know you get cursed out and and then people say well how do you let that see the glory of the Lord is going to be seen upon you because the more you got to realize we live in we live in a real Dark Age real it's dark out there y'all I remember we was coming back from uh somewhere once me and uh charlot and I flickered the lights was on one of those back back back roads so what I did I just flicked the lights just to see when those lights go out man it's oo it's scary back there when those lights go out I said you imagine could you imagine car breakdown and brother jald you might know what I'm talking about especially if the sun the moon and stars ain't out man it's dark back there but I says but you know out of all out out of all that Darkness just the little the little lights from your headlights you flicker them on it lights up everything around you right so you can see your way and I begin to just look at spiritual aspect of thing I said it's it's dark you know and we approaching a new year I was saying this morning you know God brought us through this year brought us through some trials each and every one of us through trials some pain all but I was telling the church this morning I said but I still feel like going on I know that the new year come we say we we we wish the world will get better but the Bible declared that they was going to wax worse and worse but even in that we going to rise and shine because our light has come the darker the world gets that's the more that you're going to shine the those that are living in Christ why because you know Darkness and Light they don't mix they don't have no Fellowship right and God said let there be light you know and then he divided the two because they they can't mix can they but so the darker the world get the more you going to shine but and the world going to look at you like you're the Oddball you're crazy but in all reality they lost their minds y'all believe that I was I was telling uh Charlotte the other day I wasn't we was on a little taking a little vacation on her birthday so uh was in I was in the mall I went to go to the Bass Pro Shop but then went to uh use the restroom in the bathroom and uh somebody come in there with with black hood on all black on and they was listening to this rock music like heavy metal rock or whatever it was and they had it blasting and they must have been on the phone in their pocket but it was so demonic I mean it was like I told Charlotte they were saying in a song something about sacrific and I'm going make sa they was saying they were saying all kinds of stuff in the song I said Lord I started getting nervous guy had to hood on I told charet I was like man I had to hurry up get out that bathroom my spirit got all messed up but I says that I had to shake that thing off me you know that you know you you cuz what it is we dealing with Spirits ain't it gross Darkness I I thought about how I was preaching on hidden messages I was saying but in that music he was listening to that wasn't hidden they telling you what they what they about right but I says that I was telling charlat I got back in the car cuz it Vex you it Vex my spirit now and that's what it says you know things the way the world going it Vex you don't it and it's like the uh sister I think L Willie was saying our children got to live in this world so how can you not pray for them right when the things they got to contend with right the demons I mean just demonic right the the the spirits they got to contend with how can you not pray for them and cry out to them I mean cry out to God for them that that God will have mercy on them and protect them and keep them because you know the world the world is I was telling uh charlet you know she wanted to go to the a Jamaican restaurant so we we found one but I tell I don't think that was the best neighborhood and and but just while she was in there picking the food up I told her I was the the things I saw just while she was in I said you know we living in a dangerous world the things I seen taking place just why she was in there I don't know if it was just God dealing with us Opening Our Eyes just just so we we cry out to him more that God we need your protection it's it's borderline sometimes you know the Bible say Darkness was going to cover the Earth but gross Darkness to people it's dark out there ain't it it's dark but I thank God that he still give give us the light he still put it in our heart to want to serve him you know everybody going one way and they oh you should do this you that or there but it's still in your heart to want to live right it's still in your heart to want to be holy still in your heart to not want to cheat not want still in your heart to want to please God you know only God can put that in your heart because a lot lot of times you know we think you know oh we just God will understand but if he'll keep those that want to be kept do you want to be kept because God will keep you if you want to be kept you know I was sharing with um with uh the church this morning we was talking about uh Israel and the moabites I say you know they they went and up to the feast and they joined up with them didn't they and God didn't like that I says you know God calls us out to be separate I says we don't have to join up and and or make uh you know compromise and all that for strength I said because we already blessed God brought us out he brought us from a mighty long way too didn't he I said we already blessed I don't know about you but I said I'm already blessed I don't have to compromise to get blessings compromise that I'm already blessed and the trials and the things that God take us through we look at them as as as helping us to gain a um wisdom not only wisdom but also to gain more faith in him and also character it's a character building process you go through these trials say Lord you know I don't know what the trials that you've been through that we've been through this year you out to had come out stronger than you did then before you went in you came out you look at the things you've been through you say Lord I trust you now more than I did at the beginning of the year because you brought me through this and you brought me through that come on and even right now situations might look like they're still uh uh unfinished but nevertheless I know one thing god holds tomorrow now he does don't he I'm learning right now to put everything in God Hand I'm learning to trust in him and let him do the work come on all I I I was praying uh yesterday I said Lord what I want to do you know we don't make resolutions but I just want to get closer to you that's what I want to do the year coming I want to get closer to you I thought about how you he talking about repairing the altar the altar torn down you got to repair the altar come on you got to get down back down on your knees more go back to where you started at where did you start you if you was started right you was down on your knees somewhere crying out to God depending on him from everything I said God take us all back I I definitely want to go back to that because as the world is going one way God I want to draw closer and more nigh to you so what I want to do this this year coming I was I sharing you know as God been dealing with our hearts see what we got to do as individuals we got to we got to ask God to quit us like men right and not look so much to the carnal things and begin to allow allow God to allow you to look at spiritual things because you know Jesus when he was talking about the the parable of the sword soaring seeds the one I always that always stuck out to me was the one that was sown among thorns and thistles that's the one always stuck out to me because he says that they represented the cares of this life that when the seed begin to grow up the thorns and the represent the cares of his life choke the word out of them and they become unfruitful come on I said Lord that's that's what I what I want I don't want nothing to choke the word out of me I don't if I got to get something where I got to work twice as hard do all here and and miss out on you just to keep it I don't want it right I only want the the blessings that that that's going to bring me closer to God right but we find that I say one thing and I'm going to say this I'm going sit down tonight but God is God is bringing us to some things you know what was on my heart and I shared a little bit this morning I says you know uh cuz my dad was telling me about somebody that passed away and I was saying you know they lived a hard life man they lived a real hard life my dad say yeah they drunk their s to death that's what they did I said man that was hard but I it it it did something to my heart I said because what happens is don't people people are searching for something people have things they got something it all that all that drinking all the drugging all the the women the men all that stuff they doing they they trying to satisfy something that's missing now sometimes stuff happen to people and only God can take them back to help them deal with that situation but they use all these other substitutes to try to drown out to to to drown out what they really I I says that person I was sh I was sharing my wife I says people just be wanting rest sometimes they that's what they searching for they searching for rest or they searching for peace or they looking for Joy but they don't know where where the real peace is or where the real Joy is or where the real rest is so they use all these other things to substitute it right and it don't last long it's just a sub it's a quick fix it ain't going to last come on it's just going to bring more sorrows and more Sorrows upon you and tear you down in the end ain't it but like I was sharing with uh Charlotte and I was telling the church this morning I if if they would only know that Jesus is the answer if they would only know that all they searching the rest that they they trying uh to get the rest that they Desiring if they would only know that Jesus is that rest I was saying if they would only know that peace that they looking for God on God knows the hand you was dealt in life God knows what you're going through God know what you've been through God know you need peace but he said the peace I give you ain't like the peace the world can give you I said if they only knew that he was the real peace they was looking for if they only knew he was the real JY that they was looking for if they that's why I believe David said taste and see that the Lord is good if they only knew Hallelujah but I'm glad I found out one day you know I'm glad that in all of my carrying on Deon walk was saying I'll tell everybody I hit rock bottom at 19 years old searching but I'm glad in and at my rock bottom I found something I found a real rock is what I found come on but it wasn't that I found him but he found me and I'm glad that he did because that's where the real rest is you say you resting yes I'm resting because I'm not worried about what's going to happen tomorrow I Know Who Holds Tomorrow I know who's taking care of every situation I'm resting yes I'm resting on what his word said cuz that can't fail Hallelujah he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you but I'll be with you and I believe it too that's why I serve him the way I do because I believe what he said and I ain't afraid brother Caleb to remind God of his promises I ain't afraid to tell God that God I'm going to stand here and wait on you because this is what you promis I ain't afraid of it hallelujah oh Jesus come on you know we got we got teenagers too at the house three of them so we going through some changes but God is good anyhow ain't he come on God is all of us growing together ain't it we all learning together but I thank God for it because I believe God will take care of them amen that's what it is job he offered up sacrifices and he prayed just in the in the in the event that his children did get out the way I'm going to go ahead and pray for them anyhow go ahead make and that's what you and I as parents got to do come on we can fuss yell talk but we got to get down on our knees and pray God help them God change them come on you got to be parents do that but you got your praying going to be going to mean more than anything you we can't deal with all this all this stuff we we can't deal with all this stuff the darkness the the the internet the television the cell phone we can't deal with all that it's too much right it only take God getting on your knees praying pulling down strongholds God destroy the Yol imply the blood or let me Hallelujah do what I got to do and I believe God going to do the rest oh Jesus [Applause] amen praise to God we got to move a little faster now amen God bless you amen thank God for those encouraging words from pastor dve and Min Lee get now we going to try to finish this side over here that's his small side okay brother Gordon is sitting there I didn't hear him testify or nothing when

for me right now and I'm just overwhel thankful for him God bless you all I'm going to be real quick I want to thank the Lord for allowing me to see another year last year in October um I was having really bad chest pains so I ignored it which was the wrong thing to do um I was taking Molin and Tylenol just thinking it would go away um did not go away so I drove myself to the hospital and um I told them when I got there I said I need a CT scan with contrast cuz something's going on and I didn't know what it was and so they were like um no we can't do that and I told them no I know what I need so they did a d dier which is a blood test to look for blood clots and my D dier was elevated so they immediately um did a CT scan with contrast so they did that the results came back I had a Mass above my heart the size of a bar soap and the thickness of a bar soap so I had to go to um several um surgeons to try to see um how they were going to get this Mass out because I was having a lot of pain a lot of shortness of breath um just really tired just exhausted so I finally found a surgeon at Prisma health and I had to have open heart surgery in March of this year um I want to thank the Lord he brought me through that um also when my followup was in March no yeah it was the end of March when I had to go back to my surgeon um he told me he said well this when we took out that Mas it was a tumor and he said that they found cancer cells so um it say so you need to go to South Carolina on ecology um you know and get checked out for further testing so I went there and um my onocologist that I talked to she said well we don't have the results right now of your test and everything so she said we're just waiting and um and she began to talk about me having radiation done and um she was just talking about radiation she was talking about chemo possibly chemother therapy to kill these CS to kill the sales and so when she was talking I was paralyzed with fear I was I was I was cuz I began to think about everybody else you know the um brothers and sisters that were in church that may have passed away and I was thinking Lord is this the way I'm going to go um with chemo radiation and I heard a still Small Voice that said say how what you want done and so while the doctor was talking I said I will not have to have radiation I said you you guys will not find cancer cells I said you will not find cancer cells when the results come back and I said that's what I believe and she kind of just looked at me like yeah right so um I had to wait two weeks to get my results back and she didn't call me so she sent me an email and and she said um she said Miss red you we did not find any cancer cells she said you will not have to take radiation or chemo um we're just going to do just a six Monon followup um for year and then come back every other year um and I thank the Lord for that I thank the Lord that you know for that comfort and um you know in just for in listening to the voice of God and being bold enough to speak in that doctor's office you know and let the doctors know you know you're not going to find this you know is not going to be there and I believe that and I just want to let everybody know you know keep your promise to God whatever you say to God believe it separate yourself from anything contrary to his word and God will answer your prayer amen God bless [Applause] you praise God praise the Lord I believe I understand while I was brought here this evening because I'm not of your congregation yes but I thank him for his love grace and mercy he's allowed me to face challenges good and bad I have a mountain that I've got to conquer and I believe he's showing me how right here right now so I'm happy to be here in your midst praise the Lord Saints amen um God always moved in unexpected ways um a couple years ago maybe about about four or five years ago um I was what you call wild turkey hunting and um I was going to a certain area you know from the from the forest to the to this big power line and I kept asking myself say what's I said Lord why why aren't you like moving in my life like um supernaturally and whatnot so I kept asking them so um as I kept walking something said look down and when I took my when I took one of my four steps I stepped on a huge rattle snake and it was like about maybe about six seven feet long so when I stepped on it it was dead thank God so when I backed up I kind of like observed it and um found out that I think one of the hunt club members probably killed it a couple days prior so I took my knife out cut his rattles off and it was like eight rattles so meaning that that was a old very old snake so the Lord told me that um you ask me to move and I'm moving maybe not in the way that you wanted me to move but you know it just always expect God to move in unexpected ways and I'm looking forward to 2024 God moving in my life maybe not like that but um um expecting great things

Bishop Simmons Minister Legette all the other ministers I just thank God for his many blessings thank him for his Mercy for his grace for his kindness for his longsuffering just for salvation I thank him for his death on calvary's Cross I thank him because you know Salvation is something that we can't earn we're not good enough to get it there's nothing we can do to earn it we cannot work for it but it is a gift of God I thank him for the blood of Jesus Christ that washes away our sins that has washed away my sins I thank God just for all that he has done I thank him for through the year how he has blessed and I was a person who never got sick who was always well and I guess I kind of took a little bit of pride in that and then all of a sudden it's like Satan just started attacking my body it was this it was that it was some of everything but one thing that I found out is that God is faithful by his stripes we are healed by his stripes I stand here tonight to say that God's word is true that he is faithful that he will prove himself that he is who he is and as I was listening you know to the young people testify about college you know it kind of made me reminisce a little bit and I thought about it because you know when I was going to college that was when I really gave my life to Jesus Christ and at that particular time my family told me we don't want to go that way we don't want to choose you other way so you have to make a choice you either choose us or or you choose to serve the god that you're going to serve cuz we're not going to serve him but you know I got on my knees and I prayed and I said God you know I'm going to have to walk you know this road alone but one thing I found out is that I was never alone he proved he has proved himself faithful year after year after year after year and sometimes I look back and I look at the times that when I was in school that I didn't have a where to anywhere to go I didn't have any money anything but every time God provided every time he made a way there was always someone there to um provide you know what I needed and I found out that God is faithful he's a good God I just thank him for all that he has done Saints we serve a mighty God don't we amen I bless his name tonight and just continue to pray my strength in the Lord well I wasn't going to say anything tonight since I said something on Friday but I just want to thank the Lord for just bringing us through another year for just providing for my family and just being My All In All and I just pray going forward that he just continue to use me in a mighty way um I want to do more for his kingdom in 2024 and I just pray that he use me lead God and direct me I love God and I love all his people thank you I thank God for protecting me every day and I pray that he can help me to find a good college and to start my career I thank God for my family and for keeping me this year I thank God for my family and my friends and hope he bring me to another successful I thank God for my family and for protecting me this year I thank the Lord for bringing us through another year um this is my second year of teaching and I'm kind of trying to decide is that really what I want to do with my life at this point but I also remember that that's something I've always wanted to do and the Lord made a way that I did pass the test to be able to do what my heart desired so I'm just asking the Lord just to lead and guide me in that and just keep us through this another year Well I want to thank all my brother for Year brother Ernie and brother Carl and brother Palmer and my M brother chm and brother Simmons most of all well back here some time ago about eight years I've been here and uh it start studying about poost and Arenas and and in the last couple last couple months we're in the fifth seal and if we get those other things tied up right like everything open up to you and I was in the bed back there about a month or so ago something I made a one of my brothers was start preaching now and naked and I told him if you do it I'll do it and he did and something told me the other day it's time for you to keep your promise and and it could it'll be done one day this year and I'm getting my conductor getting everything lined up everything going with me is coming off the street and and most of all when I was younger I remember working on a old 55 o mobile and I had to stacked up on some blocks and I got cold and I went in the house and I come back in about 10 or 15 minutes it sitting flat down on the ground creete block done crush and I was working over there there General Electric and I pull a had 440 up there and the pull the bus had c a bus and one stayed in and I Tau her with my hand and I was in the hospital and I had Master blood Clon both long and I'm here I began to realize if God for you can't nothing be against you and I began to realize things and and it then actually it all come together when I got poost and arenus

mighty mighty good to us and Lord all we can say is thank you thank you for being so good and Lord we ask you move us out of the way and Lord may you get all the glory the honor and the praise in Jesus name we pray amen amen I just just if you have your Bible just read one scripture um James chapter 1 and verse 22 just the first part of the scripture James chapter 1 and verse 22 when you got it say amen amen and it says be ye doers of the words and not hear only deceiving your own self amen you may be seated hey man I was thinking about something that I felt come Lord was dealing with me with and asked asked a question asked a question um and I was thinking and praying about it and the Lord came down and said are you fulfilling your purpose and I said in this new year I said I want to take the time the Lord to make sure that even if I I know what you want me to do Lord how can I do your will better how can I go on and Lord do more for you this year then more than I did this year even though Lord you might have worked in my life but Lord I want you to do more Lord I want to see you in a greater way in my life I said I can't speak for anybody else I said but that takes that takes more of me getting with you Lord so the things that I need to do Lord I want to be a doer of your word not just a hearer I don't want to come to church and that's where I leave God I want to take them home and make sure that Lord you work with me each and every day each and every day Lord I want to get down on my knees and have that personal relationship with you that Lord you can speak to me you don't have I don't have to wait till Sunday or Wednesday or Friday or Tuesday the Lord to speak to me but Lord speak to me each and every day every day that I walk every day that I breathe Lord speak to me Lord I want to be in tune that I can hear what you're saying to me I said that's what I I want to be a doer of your word not just a hear Lord if you say go I want to go said the song writer said I'll go if I have to go all by myself and sometimes you have to go by yourself but then you say Lord Lead Me Guide Me all along the way Lord if you lead me I'll go wherever you may lead me Lord that's the way I want to go I said this year Lord I want you to Lead Me Lord I want you to guide me Lord I want to be a doer of your word not just a hear Lord I want to fulfill your purpose for my life and said that's all that matters when it comes down they said May the works that I've done speak for me said you may not know how much longer you got on this Earth You may not know how many more years you may get to see but may The Works that I done may they speak for me I said that these Lord I want to make sure that I'm doing your word if you say if you leave me Lord I want to make sure that I follow where you lead me to go Jesus even came to the point he said if this cup may pass but then he said Lord not my will but thy will be done says sometimes thy will be done may be a hard path may maybe going through some things that you didn't think you wanted to go through or you didn't foresee that you would go through but it said when he say thy will be done God will take you where you need to go God will take you and make you realize things that you never knew that you had in you that sometimes he got to bring out so that you can fix him and that he can work in you further say Lord I want that you may do this work inside of me said Lord I want to see you moving each and every day I don't want to go a day pass and I see the Lord do something for me I said Lord I want to go grow so closer to you that Lord when you speak and I read your word that I can be a doer of your word not just a hear and I was thinking I said Lord that that's you said may not make a resolution but that's my goal that's my goal is Lord to see you moving to see you moving everywhere I turn Lord I Want Your Presence to be with me that when I walk in the room that people know it's not me but it's the one that sent me it's the one one that that made me the one that created me gave me life health and strength the one that's there and will always be there cuz he said I'll never leave you nor I'll forsake you see that's the God that I serve and if he's the God that I serve and he's the god that said he'd always be with me so when I look over and I see things and maybe going through a test or a trial cuz this year I said everyone can attested you go through some ups and some Downs some hills and some valleys and some things where I found out this year there's some times where they say that people may talk about you I had that happen I had some people do some things in school that I thought I'd never I never experienced that but God brought me through that and I looked back and I said well if he if he's already done this even though the test may get harder he's the same God he's the same God that can bring you through and when you get done with it you can only say that was a testimony I can go and encourage somebody else that people make talk about you but God will work it out in the end people may go behind your back but God will work it out in the end you don't even have to go and defend yourself God will take other people to defend you for defend for you and I said that's the God that I serve said Lord I want to be a doer of your word and not just a hear and then this new year I said Lord we I think everyone Lord we want to see you work Lord we want to grow closer to you cuz we might not have that much more time when we look at the world and we see what's going on in the world and rumors of wars and Wars are breaking out you don't know if the economy is stable tomorrow or not all it takes is someone to do something out of the ordinary and that's it what you what your normal is no longer normal everything that you thought you would be able to do you may not be able to do but God is the god that said I I will provide for you he said I'll heal you I'll move things and you can ask what you will and I will do it and I said said sometimes you got to stand on and say as the sister said many people have said tonight you just got to believe God that's it you got to trust him and believe that Lord you said I asked you said ask and it shall be given and that's that's why I'm standing you said Lord I believe and I'm not wavering on this Lord I'm not leaving to Lord I know that you going to do it Lord I'm standing right here and I'm not moving cuz Lord I know that you will do it cuz you're the god that I serve and you said that your word can't come back to your Void and so you gave me this word that I can use it you gave it to me that Lord that I can go out and I can defeat the Devil I can go out and I can speak things and they shall return I can go claim things cuz you told me to claim them I wouldn't be able to do it if you didn't tell me to but since you told me to Lord I'm going to use it I'm going to use this word that you gave me come on use the things that you gave me Lord cuz this is the weapon that I need to defeat the Devil this is is the only weapon that I need to defeat him and if the devil is he's already defeated cuz you already did that 2,000 years ago and God you defeated I'm so all I got to do is walk in Victory I ain't even got to worry about him coming against me cuz I know that he's defeated he ain't nothing but a bluff so if he come at me I can walk go on and say Lord you already did this I ain't got to Struggle No More Lord I ain't got to worry about this no more Lord you took care of this and I ain't got to worry about it coming back at me cuz when you said that you throw it all into the sea of forgiveness and I know that you do a mighty and a wonderful work and I said Lord I I'm looking forward to what you going to do I'm looking forward for God moving in my life I'm looking forward to God moving in your life I'm looking forward to hearing the testimonies of how God has moved I'm looking forward to see God redeeming people and looking forward to hearing the testimony of how God went as the brother said and he brought him out and he delivered and he set free and he did a mighty work not because of anything we may do but because God is God and he changes not and he'll do exactly what he said do [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen praise God we thank God for all the testimonies and I said I spoke this morning and I spoke Friday and spoke Thursday and I said I won't speak tonight amen but we appreciate speakers tonight and appreciate each and everyone hope you got a chance to tell God thank you for taking me through another year you got a chance to tell him how much you appreciate him doing that so I'm going to read the scriptures I want to ask brother the M the ministers to get ready deck Walker and come with them and get ready for the communion tonight tonight the 1 Corinthians 11 and 23 it says for I have received of the Lord also for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had sck saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthy shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but he says here but let a man examine himself and so let him eat that bread bread and drank of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthy eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the what see it's very important that we take communion but it's very important that we take it worthy see we're identifying with his death and his barrier and we want to identify with him in that we have taken on a Christian Life by the grace of God that this is the life that I chose to live so I want to have when I take it I don't want to just take it and like people traditionally just take communion and they don't have no sense of Anam in themselves and see whether I'm taking it Worthy I'm taking it unworthy so by the grace of God we take it and we want to take it worthy people they go out and party and do all kind of stuff and they come and take communion and that's wrong this is communion you have communion with him fellowship with Jesus Christ so by the grace of God it says for this cause many when they he says let me read the 29th verse again for he that eateth and drinketh unworthy eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body 30 verse for this cause many are weak sickly among you and many sleep for if a man were judge for if we would judge ourselves we should not be condemned with we should not be judged excuse me but when we are judged we are chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat ter one for another If any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come God bless you the reading of his word and we're going to ask everyone to just stand if they come and um sure you don't have another brother help you amen but we God is good amen we're going to get ready for the communion and I want you if the Bible says if we confess our faults he's faithful and justif forgive us of all our sins so together we want to go to the Lord in prayer as anything we've done said or thought is not pleasing in his sight want to ask God to forgive us that when we come with our hearts and Minds Lord I want to I want to take it worthy I want to be in one Accord with the word and I want see what the blood did in the Old Testament the shoes didn't wear out they never got sick the blood of how much more the blood of Jesus and this represents his blood and his body he was the Lamb of God they did it and put the blood on the doorpost and Lin the blood has been applied to Our Lives we thank God for that let us bow father in the precious name of Jesus Christ we thank you today for this communion service Lord and for
