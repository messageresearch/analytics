[30:54] scripture 8 and 34 we want to talk about
[30:58] paying the price tonight
[30:59] amen paying the
[31:02] price Mark
[31:08] 8:34 you got it say
[31:11] amen and it reads and when he had called
[31:15] the people unto him with his disciples
[31:18] also he said unto them whosoever will
[31:21] come after me let him deny himself and
[31:25] take up his cross and follow me and for
[31:27] for whosoever will save his life shall
[31:30] lose it but whosoever shall lose his
[31:33] life for my sake and the gospels the
[31:36] same shall save it for what shall it
[31:39] profit a man he gain the whole world and
[31:43] lose his own soul what shall a man give
[31:46] in exchange for a soul whosoever
[31:49] therefore shall be ashamed of me and and
[31:52] of my words in the this adulterous and
[31:55] sinful generation of him also shall the
[31:59] son of man be ashamed when he cometh in
[32:02] the glory of his father with the Holy
[32:06] Angels May God had the blessed to
[32:07] reading of his word you may be seated he
[32:10] said whosoever be ashamed of him he
[32:12] going to be ashamed of you right he said
[32:15] and he said in back then in this
[32:16] adulterous and and evil you call it
[32:19] adulterous and sinful generation I can
[32:22] say we even the more tonight amen and
[32:26] God don't want you to be ashamed of him
[32:28] you know there's a lot of lot of
[32:30] different religions out there and the
[32:31] people ain't ashamed of their God
[32:33] neither but you find sometimes today
[32:36] that to to uhuh cuz you know everybody
[32:39] got got claims on Christianity but we
[32:42] know that a lot of times you can't tell
[32:44] them uh different from the world but to
[32:47] live a real Christian life amen to live
[32:50] a real Christian Life a lot of seems
[32:53] that the people sometimes are are
[32:54] ashamed of living that life right but he
[32:58] says in that in those in the scriptures
[33:00] he says if you be ashamed of me then I'm
[33:02] going to be ashamed of you so when I
[33:05] come he says when he comeing in glory So
[33:07] I says you know don't be ashamed of God
[33:09] tonight amen you know we want to talk
[33:11] about pray paying the price I says you
[33:14] know uh uh here I like how Jesus says if
[33:16] any man come after me let him first deny
[33:19] himself right take up his cross and
[33:22] follow me and I believe over in Luke 9
[33:24] it says follow uh follow take up your
[33:27] cross daily and follow him so this isn't
[33:30] just uh something we just uh uh get
[33:32] ourselves geared up for when we come to
[33:35] church or you know just on Sunday we're
[33:37] going to be on our best behavior then
[33:39] but it's a it's a daily Affair it's a
[33:42] it's a daily walk it's a you know um a
[33:45] hourly I would say it like an hourly
[33:47] walk you know with with God every second
[33:50] every moment you walking with God
[33:52] because you want to be pleasing in his
[33:54] sight I don't know about you but I was
[33:56] praying I says Lord
[33:58] you know sometimes you look at yourself
[34:01] and you look at what some of the price
[34:03] that was paid throughout all of of world
[34:06] history that the people had to pay the
[34:09] price they had to pay for the gospel's
[34:11] sake and you look at yourself sometimes
[34:13] and you you say Lord what am I doing or
[34:17] what have I done to even be considered
[34:20] you know uh uh in the ranks of being
[34:23] called a son or a daughter of God a Son
[34:26] of God you know the Bible says in in in
[34:30] uh Second Timothy uh 2 or 3 3:12 I
[34:34] believe it is he says all that live
[34:37] Godly shall suffer
[34:39] persecution all that live Godly you know
[34:42] it's not you know it's something about
[34:43] it if the devil ain't after you then
[34:46] it's something
[34:47] wrong amen y'all believe that tonight
[34:50] but you on a daily battle you but you
[34:53] know one thing even though the devil's
[34:54] after you God's got it all in control
[34:56] anyway you know we put it all in the
[34:58] Master's hands but I say it's Lord
[35:01] paying the price I look at you know you
[35:03] look at your life sometimes and you say
[35:05] you know the Bible talked about the evil
[35:08] men they was going to wax worse and
[35:10] worse right being they was going to not
[35:12] only deceive but they would be being
[35:14] deceived because so you know that as the
[35:17] time gets closer uh to the end there's a
[35:21] separation between good and evil there's
[35:23] a separation between light and dark
[35:25] separation between those who are and
[35:28] those who are who are professing uh uh
[35:30] the cause you know but when the squeeze
[35:32] come the squeeze going going we're going
[35:34] to find out then what what a person is
[35:37] really made up of then so now we look at
[35:39] ourselves now I was thinking that I've
[35:41] been looking at a lot of the uh stuff on
[35:44] the reformation and and and the Dark
[35:46] Ages and how you know a lot of a lot of
[35:49] people was professing and they were
[35:51] going and following wickcliff and hust
[35:53] and all those but when it came down to
[35:55] being burnt at the state you know a lot
[35:57] of them
[35:58] recanted a lot of people when it came
[36:00] down to the to the fire in the wood
[36:02] having to go up there and and die they
[36:04] they turned back and they recanted
[36:06] everything because they weren willing to
[36:08] die because the persecution uh uh you
[36:11] know they were willing to follow follow
[36:13] when but when it came down to giving
[36:15] their life so a lot of them turned
[36:17] around but I says that what it is you
[36:20] got to be so sold out to God that no
[36:22] matter what comes your way you willing
[36:24] to give it all come on it it shouldn't
[36:28] be a doubt in your mind whether you
[36:30] ready to go all the way or not you know
[36:33] you got to consider consider your walk
[36:36] you know paying the price I said it's
[36:38] what it is everybody everybody today
[36:41] wants stuff for
[36:42] free that's the way of of the of the
[36:44] world ain't it everybody wants stuff for
[36:47] free but the thing the the the the the
[36:49] most precious thing that they can
[36:51] receive without money without price they
[36:53] don't want that come on they think that
[36:56] it just sounds too too uh uh glorious
[37:00] too unbelievable or Paradox come on it's
[37:04] free salvation is free but the people
[37:06] still in their minds sometimes think
[37:09] that they can work to earn or achieve it
[37:12] come on but the to believe now salvation
[37:15] is free but there's still a price you
[37:17] got to pay come
[37:20] on with the life but they they they want
[37:25] everybody want stuff for free I say a
[37:27] lot of of times we work we work hard and
[37:30] we'll spend our hard work money on
[37:32] things that don't make don't make no
[37:34] sense don't mean a
[37:36] thing this guy was at work telling me
[37:39] about this new thing they got out called
[37:41] uh I think it's nfts or something like
[37:44] that you can buy it like you buy stocks
[37:46] or something he says but whatever you do
[37:49] don't get caught up in that he says cuz
[37:50] what people are do he picked up a poll
[37:53] he said like this poll people will put
[37:55] it online and say it's worth 500
[37:58] $ or I'm selling it for $500 it's just
[38:00] an aluminum pole broke off from a broom
[38:03] handle but he says you know somebody out
[38:06] of all the people looking at it cuz
[38:07] they'll say somebody out of all the
[38:09] people looking at it will spend $500 on
[38:11] it and he says now it wasn't worth
[38:15] nothing but now it's worth
[38:16] $500 to you because you spent $500 on
[38:20] it but the people spend they'll run work
[38:25] spend their hard work money on stuff
[38:27] that don't make no sense at all come on
[38:30] now it's worth something to you because
[38:31] you spent your hard work money on it but
[38:34] Salvation is free so we was talking you
[38:36] know I thought about how in the in the
[38:40] in the old days and how the church world
[38:42] was selling Indulgence and all these
[38:44] things people spending the work their
[38:46] hard work money to buy things to think
[38:49] that this way I can buy my way into
[38:51] heaven or this way I can work my way out
[38:53] of purgatory and all these things that
[38:55] didn't make no sense but God had
[38:59] somebody that was faithful somebody that
[39:02] that was seeking God and wanted to uh uh
[39:06] really uh give the people take the lies
[39:10] away from the people and give the people
[39:11] the truth that you can't buy your way
[39:14] into heaven come on you were born in the
[39:18] price was too high from the day you were
[39:20] born Hallelujah but it was one that was
[39:23] willing to pay that price come on and it
[39:26] was a high price price but he was
[39:29] willing to pay it and he says whosoever
[39:32] will let him come
[39:34] freely come on a lot of times the devil
[39:38] hold people back because they look at
[39:40] themselves and who they are and what
[39:41] they done and all this and God don't
[39:43] want me but don't you know God paid the
[39:46] price for you come
[39:48] on you got to get that out of your mind
[39:52] come on and realize that Calvary Jesus
[39:55] Paid the price for you and he said
[39:58] whosoever will let him come come on but
[40:01] you got to be willing I was I was
[40:03] sharing with the other day with my wife
[40:04] and those I think I was talking about
[40:06] wife knows I says you know the thing
[40:08] about it is you know when a person loves
[40:12] God they'll do anything God asked them
[40:14] to do if they genuinely love him a lot
[40:17] of people claim they have they love God
[40:19] and they want God they love him but the
[40:22] thing is you don't do things out of
[40:23] restraint because you have to or because
[40:26] you're bound
[40:27] but it comes freely because the love
[40:30] that you got for God you do because you
[40:33] love God we're here tonight we're here

[40:58] to press my way why because I'm so glad
[41:02] of way God brought me from and when I
[41:05] couldn't pay the price I
[41:08] realized that Christ did it for me
[41:11] freely he gave this thing
[41:13] Hallelujah the devil had you Bound in
[41:15] Chains and you know the thing about it
[41:17] is you know he paid the price not only

[41:26] your deliverance he paid the price for

[50:17] to stand before God
[50:21] hallelujah oh
[50:22] Jesus come on Hallelujah that's said
[50:26] it's a price you got to pay the price
[50:29] are you willing to pay the price
[50:31] tonight come on I said it's a high price
[50:35] it's it's a high price you I think about
[50:37] that I like I said I was looking at some
[50:39] things and I think about I thank God
[50:42] that that he had even in the in the
[50:44] Roman Catholic Church he had some some
[50:48] people that really was sincere in their
[50:51] heart and they was willing to give up
[50:54] everything to get the word out to the
[50:56] people but God did that God put that in
[51:00] man's heart you know one of the guys I
[51:03] was talking with at work about some
[51:04] things and he was saying you know he was
[51:06] saying that's that's what kind of uh uh
[51:10] confuses him about the Bible is he says
[51:13] that you know it's been translated from
[51:15] this from Hebrew to Greek and Greek and
[51:18] then uh to to this and everybody had
[51:21] their own translation their own mind he
[51:23] say so the original was lost and he
[51:25] don't think it can ever
[51:27] you can never have the original back
[51:29] because it's throughout all the ages
[51:31] been lost we can only have bits and
[51:33] pieces but not the original you know but
[51:37] I was saying you know the thing about it
[51:39] is I says to myself says you
[51:44] know God a God that that spoke from the
[51:49] beginning and said let there be light
[51:52] was the same God that separated the
[51:54] light from the darkness was the same God
[51:57] that created the moon and the stars and
[51:59] the Sun and all these things and from
[52:01] the time he created it they still hold
[52:03] true right now Hallelujah now if he can
[52:07] do that from then until now why can't he
[52:10] put it in the hearts of man to bring us
[52:11] back a perfect word come
[52:14] on to bring us back a word that when we
[52:17] hear it it'll be just like hearing it
[52:19] from the lips of God himself come on he
[52:23] can put it in the hearts of men yes I
[52:26] believe he can why because our God you
[52:29] got to quit thinking about God like he's
[52:32] a man quit limiting
[52:35] him to science of what you can see come
[52:40] on God isn't limited by
[52:43] nothing nothing limits God it'll be just
[52:48] as he
[52:49] said and it always will be Hallelujah
[52:53] it'll hold true y'all believe that
[52:55] tonight come on don't limit him
[52:57] now come on don't limit
[53:01] him somebody says I got
[53:04] faith but they seeing how the situation
[53:07] going to work out that ain't
[53:09] faith faith you don't know you don't God
[53:12] got
[53:13] create come on faith walks
[53:15] blindly come on but the only thing about
[53:18] it it's not an imagination it's material
[53:21] it's a substance it's the real thing
[53:24] come
[53:25] on oh Jes Jesus that's what it is you
[53:28] got to have faith like
[53:30] that to know that God is going to do
[53:33] exactly what he said he'll do come on I
[53:36] was looking at uh uh last this last week
[53:38] I was looking at uh um in the Book of
[53:41] Daniel and how you know 70 weeks and all
[53:44] and I was looking at how you know the
[53:47] the one told Daniel said come on I'm

[53:57] the Empire coming next but to bring in
[53:59] to show him all these things even until
[54:01] the end and it's my heart was just I
[54:03] done read it and studied it many times
[54:06] but my heart was so stirred because I
[54:08] says it was so direct come on it was so
[54:11] on on point that even until now
[54:15] everything has been just as he said
[54:17] it'll be so why want tomorrow the things
[54:20] are hold just as he said it would be
[54:22] come on God don't
[54:24] miss that's one thing about him he don't
[54:27] miss he don't give out something and
[54:30] then tomorrow change his mind about it
[54:33] that's why I'm so glad that God calls
[54:37] men men don't call God God calls men God
[54:41] does the
[54:42] choosing and he don't make no mistakes
[54:44] about who he chose am he said I he said

[56:08] common language you know those people
[56:10] were revived because it was something
[56:11] that was refreshing them from all the
[56:14] what they were taught and all the all
[56:16] the things they were taught they were
[56:18] forced into certain things forced into
[56:20] this religion forced and all this but
[56:22] then when the word started coming it was
[56:24] life to them it was rich it was doing
[56:26] something Reviving them they wern't
[56:29] forcing or nothing now they could they
[56:31] could become what they was reading
