[32:51] into your hands thank you Lord
[32:56] amen Genesis 25 and
[33:01] 21 I read the first you'll read the next
[33:06] and we read the latter verse
[33:08] together
[33:10] Genesis
[33:11] 25 and
[33:19] 21 and is it entreated the Lord for his
[33:24] wife because she was
[33:27] burn and the Lord was intreated of him
[33:32] and Rebecca his wife conceeded
[33:45] 22 and the Lord said un unto her two
[33:50] nations are in thy
[33:53] womb and two manner of people shall be
[33:58] separate from thy vow vows and the one
[34:03] people shall be stronger than the other
[34:07] people
[34:08] [Music]
[34:09] and the one people should be stronger
[34:12] than the other people and the Elder
[34:16] Shall Serve the younger
[34:25] 24 and the first came out red all over
[34:31] like in hary garment and they called his
[34:37] name Esau
[34:50] 26 and the boys grew and Esau was a
[34:55] conning Hunter a a man of the field and
[34:58] Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents
[35:09] 28 and Jacob saw partage and Esau came
[35:15] from the field and W and he was faint
[35:25] dir
[35:32] and Jacob said sell me this day thy
[35:37] Birthright
[35:46] 32 and Jacob said swear to me this day
[35:51] and he sweared unto him and he s sold
[35:56] his his Birthright un Jacob 34 together
[36:00] and Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage
[36:03] and lenon and he did eat and drank and
[36:07] Rose up and went his way thus Esau
[36:11] despised his Birthright God bless the
[36:13] reading this word you may be
[36:17] seated so this
[36:19] morning we want to talk concerning
[36:24] Birthright Birthright
[36:27] and then talking about Birthright we
[36:29] want to understand what the birthright
[36:33] meant because uh often
[36:36] times uh people despise their
[36:43] Birthright
[36:45] now the birthright because of the Elder
[36:49] son let's just go to Deuteronomy for a
[36:52] minute Deuteronomy
[36:54] 21 and 15
[37:00] Deuteronomy
[37:07] 21:15 the birthright gave
[37:13] them supreme
[37:17] authority mean preeminence and
[37:25] Authority
[37:30] 21 15 okay Caleb you got
[37:38] it okay if a man had two wives and
[37:43] one beloved and another hated and they
[37:48] have borne him children both the Beloved
[37:54] and the hated and if the firstborn son
[37:59] be her hers that was hated then if it
[38:04] shall be when he maketh his son to
[38:09] inherit that which he has that he may
[38:14] not make the son of the Beloved the
[38:22] firstborn before the son of the hated
[38:27] which is indeed the
[38:30] firstborn but he shall acknowledge the
[38:34] son of the hated for the
[38:38] firstborn by giving him a
[38:41] what a double portion of all that he has
[38:46] for he is the beginning of his strength
[38:51] and the right of the firstborn is his
[38:57] are you with me so the birth right in
[39:01] today we talking about the birthright uh
[39:05] and it's a type of the Holy Ghost
[39:09] baptism are y'all with
[39:11] me the the type of the Holy Ghost
[39:15] baptism
[39:16] Birthright and that birth right uh gives
[39:20] you preeminence and authority and also
[39:23] gives you a double
[39:25] portion are you with
[39:27] me now I might have to cut the Heats off
[39:31] I see people
[39:34] Fanning
[39:35] so the devil portion are you with
[39:39] me
[39:41] now if you know you was going to get
[39:44] inheritance and you can get a double
[39:47] portion then you perhaps will respect
[39:52] and not despise not re you would hold on
[39:55] to your
[39:57] Birthright because it means something to
[40:01] you not only did the birthright means
[40:04] that uh it's something that you can hold
[40:07] on to but it also has the
[40:11] tendency our spiritual
[40:15] inheritance also so by the grace of God
[40:19] that which is spiritual uh you get a
[40:22] chance but uh Romans 9 here for a moment
[40:25] Romans
[40:28] n Romans n a lot often times people
[40:32] don't want they don't they desp they
[40:36] reject the opportunity to have the
[40:38] birthright that God wants to give
[40:43] you Esau didn't care too much about
[40:46] it why because
[40:49] Esau was
[40:52] hungry and he
[40:54] wanted what he he wanted right
[40:58] then I want I'm hungry right now this
[41:03] Birthright don't mean
[41:05] nothing I'm hungry
[41:08] now and I might die right now to give me
[41:13] Jacob said okay I but I want you to give
[41:16] me your
[41:20] Birthright Jacob meant
[41:24] deceiver and I'm going to tell you
[41:26] something your Jacob your

[1:06:30] evil CU God intended for me to be
[1:06:34] evil that's that's your
[1:06:39] prerogative that's what you think about
[1:06:42] yourself think you meant to be evil some
[1:06:46] folks have taken the evil
[1:06:48] disposition theyve taken that I I was
[1:06:50] born to go to

[1:07:06] think
[1:07:07] it in his heart what so is
[1:07:13] he but I hope you're thinking better

[1:07:20] and God is just God is not evil
[1:07:24] am God know what he
[1:07:27] doing amen praise
