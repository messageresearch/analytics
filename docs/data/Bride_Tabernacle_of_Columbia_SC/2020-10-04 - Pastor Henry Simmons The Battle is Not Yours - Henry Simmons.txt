father we're trusting you down to heal the save and deliver in jesus name we pray amen as we stand this morning second chronicles 20 and 15. ii chronicles 20 and 15. and he said hawking ye or judah and yet inhabitants of jerusalem and thy king jehoshaphat thus said the lord unto you be not afraid nor dismissed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but god may god bless you reading of his word in jesus name you know said the president of the united states have corona we need to be praying god touch him amen the bible said pray for them that are in authority so folks are getting their political swain and they say well you know but christians understand in the gap amen pray for them that are in authority and be obedient to the word amen so we thank god for praise god allow us to be in a country where we can worship god amen well we can stand and say thank you jesus regardless of the political situation we still say thank you jesus because god is good and we appreciate him amen so by the grace of god today the battle is not yours but the lord are you with me he said the battle is not yours but it's god amen if you sit down by a family member you can just look at your family member and tell them the battle is not yours but god amen the battle is not yours but god but the lord isn't that right so i'm sure if you're living then you are challenged with obstacles and things that you know that are coming against you paul says in the romans that there's the war going on when i desire to do good evil is present with me so if you're not battered then you're not conscious that there is a war going on every christians are are in contact constantly there's a battle between good and evil there's a battle between right and wrong amen we have to fight amen because when we decide to do good evil is present all you got to do is just be born and just live and there's a wall going on but i'm saying to you that are saved this morning you that [Music] know the lord the battle is not yours but the lord are you with me now as we go further in this try to understand this message here uh we understand this judah was contending with the children of amen and moab and monsieur they had invade israel so it was an invasion you and i they look at the physical realm of the children of god being invaded by the enemy of other nations that have come up to destroy them you and i amen must look at the spiritual realm and the battle that wages war that goes on in our mind as the god servant said the greatest battle ever fought is fought within our mind so there's a war going on amen but the battle is not yours but the law yes i'm i'm confronted and i know that there has been an invasion amen and invades them that seeks to kill and to steal and to destroy there has been an invasion they meant on your christian rights amen and what god has given you there has been an invasion of demon powers that have come up against you brother and sister you're confronted with the attack of the enemy yes they are but thank god the battle is not yours it's the lord so in the 16th verse brother gordon you want to read for us he says second chronicles tomorrow go ye down against them and behold they come up by the cliff of zizen and you shall find them at the end of the brook before the wilderness of jereal ye shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand ye still and see the salvation of the lord with you o judah and jerusalem he says stand ye still you know sometimes we can't stand still long enough to see god fight out of that go ahead amen but he said stan ye still sometimes we panic when we're confronted with the enemy and it is difficult because sometimes folks get in the uh get nervous and get afraid and get this maze are you looking amen but he said stan ye still i heard the song said be still and know that i am god amen are you with me praise god i want you to be still this morning and i want you to know that i am god amen i am the lord that healeth all thy diseases be still and know that i'm god stand ye still praise god hallelujah i notice here uh lately there are enemies within and enemies without that folks that in the church that's amen same amen you are there any man they think that uh we're one another enemies they're folks that's uh outside that see you as a threat amen they're all types of enemies folks that don't know that they're controlled by demon power praise god they get in conversations within themselves and think came in amen we're just talking and holding a cage conversation but they don't know the enemy is controlling the conversation for they think that it's all right to think evil and to talk against one another they don't they don't take under consideration instead of talking i need to be lifting my brother up i need to be lifting my sister up for the battle is not yours sometimes brother was talking to me the other day and as he talked he was offering some type of la la land with some kind of erroneous doctrine and as he was trying to explain to me his revelation i like to hear that little voice it was the voice of god speaking how do i know it because it was the word of god that that voice said and i heard that little voice you know i was praying lord i want to be conscious of when you're speaking when i heard that little voice i said to brother i said brother stop for a minute and i believe somewhere along the line in the spiritual realm that that brother knew that something had happened and i gave him the word the scripture and he tried to explain the word away you know when you know that god has spoken you don't worry about a thing nobody can explain god away from you because you can stand assured on the word the word of god is right it doesn't matter how folks try to explain it i don't have to receive it if it's not according to scripture amen you've got to receive what the scripture says and if the word of god said you need to obey him are you with me sometimes i think we're so out of tune with the the word and out of tune with the voice of god that when god speak through his word sometimes i wonder do we hear you and i are constantly being battled the problem i have with the modern day church is that the discernment is off we cannot help one another when we don't have proper discernment that goes from the pulpit to the back door we need to be able to discern between right and wrong truth and arrow sometimes i said i said why is our discernment why can't we see amen that amen folk need help think of you if you're having trouble with discernment you all now have trouble getting on your knees and praying pray god help help your brother help your sister help you preach your heart if you're praying then be quiet i don't want to say that word shut up amen but sometimes it's fitting to say just shut up amen be quiet and just shut up and pray stop running your mouth and god might show you all your faults that you ain't got nothing to talk about nobody else because you got enough trouble just trying to save yourself are you with me since sometimes god show us what we need ourselves that's why we oh yes be still and know that i'm god are you a man amen every time you try the throw a stone at somebody you got to be careful that somebody's not writing on the ground on you are you up man so it's better just to be quiet and pray i've had a lot of problems in conditions that i uh amen folks sometimes said straighten this out strain that out do this do that amen but i said the batter is not brother simmons the battle is not broad tabernacle the blood is not yours but it's the law i believe god has assured me that the battle is not mine but it's the law amen you can have that assurance this morning that you're battling something [Music] a situation or condition then i'm saying to you be still and know that i'm god and the battle is not yours but it's the lord i said if the god can't handle you can't either amen if god cannot fight this battle you can't either are you with me so sometimes in our fight in the world we try to have our own tactical uh uh devices and we and strategize to our own hurt we begin to work a strategy how we gonna fight the battle but we actually are trying to fight the battle of our own accord so we are challenging the enemy but amen we think that we understand how to defeat the devil oh but the battle is not yours but it's the law i gotta curb a little bit he says here be still amen he said be still and see the salvation of the lord with you are you with me i want you to see the salvation of the lord with you amen hallelujah he says old judah and jerusalem fear not nor be what dismays tomorrow go out against them i'm saying to you tomorrow not next year not next week but tomorrow oh hallelujah can i hear somebody say tomorrow tomorrow amen praise god oh yes somebody said tomorrow amen tomorrow hallelujah praise god this is not me speaking it's the word amen as he said to them then so god is speaking to us now tomorrow amen oh yes tomorrow go out against them for the lord will what the lord will be with you hallelujah you believe that brother sister the lord gonna be with you amen you can go out now amen you i don't want you to be dismayed i don't want you to be afraid but go out the lord be with you praise god if y'all thinking that is brother simmons saying that amen then you might just go out tomorrow and you'll find nothing has changed but if you believe that it's the word of god speaking to you then you go out tomorrow and you see that the lord is with you god is with you amen praise god i i like it amen because amen i said lord what you want me to say amen i don't want to come and just say something but what you want your people to know amen hallelujah oh the battle is not yours it's the laws amen and jehoshaphat amen bow his head with his face to the ground and all judah in the inhabitants of jerusalem fell before the lord and what worshipping the law and the levites and the children of kohats and the children of the koat tight stood up praising what praising the lord god of israel with what some of y'all ain't never praise the lord with a loud voice like something wrong but when you believe the word of god and believe hallelujah amen what he's saying you open your mouth and say praise the lord hallelujah some of y'all don't know how good god is nobody you you don't know how wide your god is when the enemy didn't come and invade your life on every side when that seemed to be no escape when it seemed to be that the devil would take you out thank god hallelujah but i got a word from the lord amen i got a word from the lord hallelujah something bubbling up in my soul god in my spirit i hear the voice of the lord saying the battle is not yours what is the law hallelujah everything is all right hallelujah don't be this amazed amen don't be afraid stand still amen i said tomorrow amen hallelujah but what's going on and uh he said with a with a loud voice i think some of us ain't never got loud they think god is satisfied sometimes we just shake our hands and we presume brother and sister i wish i had a a couple thousand dollar bills and i can pass them out and say if you if you appreciate it just say hallelujah some of those folk that can't open their mouth to praise the lord you want to see some folks say hi thank you jesus don't let you just pass them out ten ten thousand then if they don't want to pray the law of the ten thousand you put add 10 more to that until you get it right where they can open their mouth loud enough are you with me you you know sometimes you can give the folks enough money to be happy amen you give them enough money say i'll pay your house off i'll pay your automobile off you give enough you give the people enough carnal blessings then they would praise the lord on high but brother sister amen don't wait until the battle's over shout now amen don't wait and praise the lord after it's all over praise him now are you with me oh yes i'm getting something from it ain't that because things are going to change amen things are going to change in your life something is going to happen to you this morning something's going to happen amen the holy ghost's going to get ahold hey something is going to happen praise god hallelujah praise god i know how good god is hey all those devils that's been holding you down ah look out devil i said look out devil you've been binding up god children but you're not gonna be able to hold them this morning hey hallelujah you're not going to be able to hold them no longer will they come and not praise the lord no longer will you blind them up hallelujah you jesus oh no longer amen enough is enough praise god god said that's enough amen that's enough you die don't touch my anointing through my prophecy no harm amen free or not little flock it is your father good pleasure to give you the kingdom amen god has given you the victory you already got it amen thank god i got it thank god amen i got to victory thank god that victory is mine i don't have to worry about it no no no hallelujah i don't have to worry about victory this morning but surely god has given me the victory how about you brother sister do you believe that victory is yours do you believe that god has given you the victory oh hallelujah what are we gonna do amen i know the devil got some on his hand this morning amen he got a people that know amen their god amen they that know their god shall do exploits oh hallelujah i believe you know god this morning amen i believe you shall do exploits amen oh hallelujah something's gonna happen amen to the demons that'll come up against your life the attack that the enemy has invaded your body and try to give you all types of diseases and afflictions something has been invaded your mind invaded your home invaded you on the child in every situation the invaders have come amen but god said the the battle is not yours but it's god's it's the lord are you with me praise god now he says amen they with a loud voice oh no come on somebody hallelujah i think if i get 100 praise in this building this morning that there'll be no fever person walk out the building this morning amen i believe that everybody will be here praise god every mental and uh uh depressed spirit amen will flee every spirit of field would go every spirit that's bound in you would get out of here amen i believe something to happen something got to happen if it happened then it'll happen now amen because i believe that he's the same if he did it for them why not me they may tell you brother sister why not you why not you wha why why wha what's holding praise god do you believe amen you believe it's for you you believe healing is for you you believe victory is yours you said it's mine amen why don't you just just have it why don't you just possess it possess the gates of the enemy just take it amen it's yours it's yours oh praise god devil amen hallelujah oh when you get a word from the lord and when god speaks amen the devil can do every everything he can to try to hold you back but he can't hold you the bible says in the 21st and they rose early in the morning come on somebody and went forth into the wilderness of tikko and as they went for jehoshaphat stood and said hear me o judah amen anybody listening he wanted to hear hear me oh jesus oh i wonder if you listen he that has an ear to hear let him hear what what the spirit says to the church hear me o judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem believe in the what believe in the lord your god so shall ye be what so shall you be established amen believe his what believe his prophets so shall ye praise god what's holding back your prosperity amen amen praise god what's holding back your prosperity amen do you believe god's report amen the prophet had come to jehoshaphat and the prophet had prophesied and told gave him the word of the lord so the prophet came and gave him the word of the lord and jehoshaphat was rehearsing what the prophet had said are you with me he was saying what the prophet had said and he was putting it in action are you with me he was acting upon he didn't go and said amen the prophet said so and so he was acting upon what the prophet is saying oh you would be he told them amen what to do if you if you know that the prophet had spoken god said the lord then i want you to respond to what the prophet said [Music] he gave him instruction that's mourning god is giving us instruction what we can do to prosper amen that he said and when he had consorted with the people he appointed what look at that he appointed singers amen i'm trying to get the singers to wake up oh they wish i wish i was one of the singers this morning well i'm not he appointed singers saying god's got any singers in here this morning then you've been called to an appointment with god that god has appointed you he's given you a voice and you can hold a tune and god uh he appointed singers you've been called and appointed by god that sang are you up there you don't sing because the preacher says sing you don't sing because mama says saying you don't sing because a daddy saying you don't sing because brother god says saying but you have been appointed by god to sing are you up there nobody called on me hey man nobody called on me if they called me they missed me i ain't gonna sing i'm just away till they call me amen god may never call you amen because when you appointed to do it by god nothing can't stop you are you up there because you got a commission from the holy ghost and when you sing you know what's going to happen amen you're singing you've got a purpose in mind you've been opponent to sing and you've got a purpose in mind you know if i sing i know what's going to happen amen you ought to expect something to happen you oughta anticipate something to happen not a pat on the back oh you so sound so good that's all right amen not somebody to lift you up amen and say you sound bad this morning bad or good it doesn't matter i'm singing to the law that i've been appointed by god praise god and i'm gonna give god my best decide the best that i can amen i give him my best and when my best fail god knows i'll try oh you would be but if i give him anything i know he's not well pleased with my sacrifice are you with me but if i give god my best yay hallelujah i believe god will perfect that which is lacking in us i believe that god will add to us i believe that he'll prosper amen when you get out of tune god of prospers some of the times when i think i failed sometimes when i prayed for somebody that was awfully sick and looked like i didn't get a breakthrough amen and i feel uh i i don't know then i heard a report that they were healed of cancer they meant that they were delivered amen that god spoke to and i walked away with my head down feeling sad but god had ministered to knees are you with me it ain't how you feel or what you think about it amen is what god vindicates and approve are you with me so brother and sister don't worry about whether you get a pat on the back or whether or not you think amen did you fail god god sometimes use your failure to be a blessing to somebody we all need a little encouragement sometime amen the preacher need encouragement amen the singers needing coverage the uh the congregation needs to be encouraged and i hope you encourage this morning amen when god give me certain messages it's for to encourage you amen and i may not say i'm trying to encourage you but i hope you read between the line that god won't encourage you are you with me so by the grace of god i want you to know that uh in the 21st verse and he said and when he had consulted with the people he appointed singles unto the lord and that they should what they say what praise the beauty of holiness are you with me hallelujah isn't holiness beautiful amen there's a difference between clean and unclean between holy and unholy are you with me so you got to know that there's a difference between those that sing out there for the money and those that sing for popularity and for uh glory of men and amen everybody trying to do this to get some glory and god to get some glory and to be famous and to be the sin be that amen that the glory of the flesh and that's the glory of god i'm talking about saying amen what beauty of holiness are you doing are you with me oh yes i believe amen we're singing because we got pretty bosses amen we're singing because they sound good brother and sister we don't want to sing because we sound good because we can't sing he said praise amen i don't know he got so quiet are you with me singers should praise the what is that sinking deep the beauty of what sometimes we're trying to be beautiful ourselves amen let your beauty be amen godly character are you with me and not trying to get all pretty but let it be godly character are you with me i don't i got to close y'all know i just got started i couldn't get started this morning but y'all y'all uh it's your beautiful congregation beauty of holiness let's praise the lord this morning let's get something from this that will take us through and tomorrow we can wake up and know that god has done a great work in our lives he said praise the beauty of holiness as they went out before the army and to say praise what praise the lord for his what oh lord don't you know we need mercy this morning the preacher said on friday night we need mercy are you up man mercy amen lord lord grant us mercy hallelujah not because we we think we're special but we know mercy thank you lord and he said and when they began to sing and what [Music] come on supposed to happen not when you sing and praise the lord oh man they showed up man they didn't they do good sometimes you need encouragement but you got to be careful how you pray you really let god use you today oh the anointing i really was blessed with your singing today i thank god for your sister brother and children i thank god for you y'all really yielded to the spirit of god amen and see that's encouragement that's encouragement when you're not trying to lift them up you're trying to tell them thank god for allowing god to use you you are a blessing to us healing went forward deliverance went forward you expect things to happen when you sing knowing that you are looking for results not a pat on the back but for real genuine results oh you look man he said and when they began to sing and praise the lord the lord set ambushment against the children of amen and the moab and mount seal which were come against judah and they were spitting y'all see what happens when cancer high blood pressure sugar diabetes arthritis mental all kind of things that happen demons you're fighting in your mind in your body god has sent ambushes these these singers start singing with the under expectation because they got a prayer life amen they got a prayer life they don't have a prayer life they ain't gonna be able to break no yokes but they know how to pray
