will be on Resurrection and Lord God that we're in the resurrection in Jesus Christ's name amen The Book of Ezekiel 37 1- 12 I'll read the first you'll read the next and we'll read the 12 ver together are you glad to be alive Amen in the land of the living we come to praise the Lord amen and worship Him amen so many people desire to be where you are today but because the circumstances they not they were not able to make it into a church they were not able to tell God thank you but you here and you can tell the Lord thank you Lord I appreciate you I believe that he's Arisen as he said he said the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of a valley which was full of Bones to and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and I and I answered oh Lord God thou knowest for thus say the Lord God unto these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live six will I am so I prophesies as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaken and the bones came together bone to his bone eight then said he unto me prophesied unto the wind prophesied son a man and say to the wind thus said the Lord God come from the fork winds oh breath and breathe upon the slain that they may live 10 IES then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel behold they say our bones are dried our hope is lost we are cut off for our part 12 together therefore prophesied and say unto them thus say the Lord God behold oh my people I will open your Graves and cause you to come up out of the your Graves and bring you into the land of Israel God bless you reading this word you may be seated then he says in the 13th verse he says and ye shall know that I I am the Lord when I have opened your Graves oh my people and bought you up out of your Graves and shall put my spirit in you and ye shall live and I shall place you in your own land that's what they're fighting over in Israel God promised and over there now they are fighting because of the land and the Palestinians they want their land but God gave this land to Israel and so the fight is on God says gave them a promise are you with me and they prophesies to the Four Winds for the four corners of the earth and I talked about a a a a threefold resurrection are you with me and he says place you in your own land so Israel said This is Our Land God gave it to us see one they were scattered abroad they were scattered throughout all nations because they had crucified the Messiah that came to them they killed him the Bible said he came into his own his own received them not they didn't receive him when he came because the Bible say say in Romans 11 Their Eyes Were blinded for our sakes for the Gentile sake God blinded their eyes that they could not see that was only because God was going to graft into the Olive Tree amen the Gentiles are you with me God was allowing them to be blind that we could be grafted in amen amen so the Gentiles could be partakers of the blessings of Abraham and he went on to say that in Romans that he's not a Jew that is one outwardly but is one inwardly in the circumcision of that not of the flesh but of the spirit amen and of the heart so God in his own way of saying to you and I amen that there is a a resurrection going to take place here and it won't be a resurrection of Simply uh amen ladis but a resurrection of a Nation so I I said a three-fold resurrection God is resurrect in a nation we have seen a nation that was off the map for almost 2,000 years over 2,000 years off the map no longer in existence but yet in 1948 Israel became a nation again so we look at history as we study history the Bible is real God is real history tells you that God is real sometimes folks don't want to believe that there is a God that knows it all but God knows the end from the beginning he was able to tell Ezekiel what's going to happen in the future amen amen now if God could do thousands of years before it happened yet we read the Bible and it almost like it's just another book no it's not the Bible is the word of God Amen the Bible says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God this is God's word he said Heaven and Earth a passway but the word of God it'll be here it's going to stand are you with me so he says here I place you in your own land then shall ye know that I the Lord have spoken it and performed it said the Lord Israel have not recognized Jesus as their Messiah as as a whole as of yet but it's going to happen and when that happens the Gentile time the church ages are over and it's the Rapture takes place and Revelation 11 with the two prophets Moses and Elijah comes on the scene during the Great Tribulation and the mark of the beast and all of that is that are taking place and if you don't make the Rapture and you're left here on the earth that means the spirit the Holy Ghost lifts off the Earth and you talking about you think it's bad now don't stick around stick around because it's close now Prophet God said Israel is our time piece and Israel tells us time is what time is winding up we are at the end time we don't have long ha the Earth is in her birth pains the world is going through birth pains the Bible tells we know we're there but yet we don't want to you know sometimes we don't want to face the fact that the world has come to its end but it did has now look what's happened to Israel we're talking about a three-fold resurrection now here Israel as a nation and a resurrection taking place for them are y'all with me so Israel comes up from nowhere God the wall Hitler hman and all musolini and all of them started killing the Jews isn't that right and the Jews was almost they had nowhere to go they had no help so after they began to gas him and kill him they got homesick they wanted to go back home so those walls drove them back to their Homeland and the Nations said we're going to give them this land so Israel was able the prophet God said in 1946 the angel of the Lord appeared to him and said Israel has become a nation in 1948 the world recognized Israel amen had become a nation it was saying to Israel to the Jews all over the world let's go home so they got on the airplanes they came out of Africa that came out America that came out of all over the world Israel the Jews went back home and you know what they say never again we'll never again get killed like they killed us under Hitler they gassed them they did all kind of horrible things to the Jews but they said never again so the nation says stop killing they said uh-uh they came and they killed us never again we're not going to let this happen again so they can't stop them so the world almost is turning against Israel are you with me I'm going to tell you something about the World Turning against Israel watch out little bride the natural types of spiritual watch out little bride because the squeeze is on the way if the world is itself is turning against Israel don't you know the world is telling you the church world is saying you must accept all type of immoral living women can marry women man can marry man and all kind of stuff you can't preach you can't say nothing about it if you say something about it then the the world is against the word of God and if you stand with the word of God you're going to be looked at as somebody despised and rejected me meaning only thing you doing is saying the word tells us what's right and what's wrong not because you hate anybody we telling them don't get caught up don't you allow amen your spirit to be caught up with the things of this world God's got a people that's going to trust him and go to stand with him no matter what the word does Israel said amen uh we going to stand never again there's going to be a church that's going to stand up and said never again praise God we're going to stand for the word we're not going to allow amen Satan Amen to come in because the Bible said the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against the church are you with me so you if you open the gates of your heart and allow all kind of chrash to come in you might become garbage are you with me your life becomes a mess your heart becomes corrupt your minds become defiled and rep probation sets in amen when you hear the word you can't even believe in anymore and the love of many going to watch cold so people are they don't they think they're doing God a service if they kill you people don't have any backbone they don't want to stand up for the word no more but there got to be a people that's going to say Amen it might be my mama my daddy my sister my brother I love them but I hate sin how can you love folks God so loved the world and he didn't come to the world to condemn the world and neither do we try to condemn anyone but because of the love of God we tell them that Jesus has come and Cav me means something the cross of Jesus means something it means that he died for our sin somebody said I was born a I was born a sinner I was born a certain way okay let's just look at uh Matthew 28 excuse me people are born all kind of ways born Liars some people born with one leg some people bone they can't see some people bone amen with all kind of things bone with different conditions because their parents had them and said the blind man was blind and they said Jesus amen why was this man blind who sin did this man sin or did his parent sin it shows you that what your mama or your granddaddy did you can be suffering from the effect of what they did are you with me he said neither the parents amen and neither this man but God had a purpose in allowing this to happen cuz one day Jesus came amen amen and he healed that man that was born blind brother sister I don't know how you got in the condition that you were in and I don't know what caused your condition but I know that Jesus is here to help you amen and he's not here to condemn you but to save you am amen amen and the purpose of my preaching is not to uh downplay anybody or make anybody feel uh it's just that you might hear the truth in the truth can make you free that's all because there's freedom in the truth everything else is going to it's going to cause after effects anything else is going to cost I don't care what you do young lady says she loves smoking her joints I said to her give me some of those Jones she said no no you we don't want you to have none I said why not it's good for you ought to be good for me she said uh no her preacher I wish she was here this morning she said she was coming she didn't want me to have none and her sister said no no you can't have I said good for y'all why y'all want me to have none I said what I got I want you to have some of this I'm high off with this Jesus so I want you to try this you don't want me to try your oh no no no no no no no ain't for you that ain't for you no see what I'm saying they they know what's right in the spirit they know what's right and they don't want you to have it but they want to say well she said I'm going be smoking throughout eternity I'm going to heav I be smoking throughout eternity I you believe that he said sure I said okay I'm going to heaven smoking my joint I said okay I know in in people heart they know what's right you know what I'm saying if they want to be honest they know what's right amen there's a left and a right and there's a wrong and a right are you with me how many you know that two plus 2 is six well 2+ 2 is 7 how many of y'all know that who's right and who's wrong two plus two is what four okay see that see that even the children know that right so if you tell a you tell a story I ain't going to say a lie cuz y'all might that's too hard for yall if you tell tell tell something wrong don't something tell you don't do it ain't that right some said don't do don't do that but why you do it anyhow because there's that there's a red light flashing telling you what's right and what's wrong if you never read your Bible there's something in you tell you when you're wrong are you with me you don't have to read the Bible to know that you're doing wrong your mom and dad yeah ain't got to tell you you doing wrong that's why you sneaking to do it you might be two years old sneaking one year old looking you know what I'm saying when mama said don't do that some of them real smart what you can't even walk you know what I'm saying but they know it's a right it's a it's a red light it's an alarm inside of you when you do wrong it's something telling you don't do it are you with me and if we keep running the red light after a while it'll stop flashing are you up me you just are ignor it so much so you just become wrong all the time just everything you just wrong why because God just done gave you over to it he he tried to stop you stop you stop you stop he said don't don't stop stop stop stop stop and you w't stop so God said okay I give you over to that what you want I give you over to your own desires if that's what you want have it but one day you're going to wish you to listen when I tried to stop you not that somebody tried to preach to you not that somebody tried to convince you but you your own self I I put in you something that tells you right and wrong are you with me okay so by the grace of God right and wrong is builtin it's it's a builtin mechanism he said All Souls is mine but he said the soul that sinth it shall die but Jesus didn't come he didn't come to express to you I'm coming to where y'all can stop doing this and stop doing that and and you better not do this and you better not do that that was the law the law showed you what's wrong but Jesus come to show you I love you I love you I love you I'm not coming to tell you amen stop doing this and stop doing that I I I come to show you the love of God Amen that he cares for you and I hope you see that now uh uh I said uh 28th chapter of Matthew amen I got to be short because we got a lot of folks here and I want you to come back I be you long you won't come back glad to see y'all yall look so pretty over there but I want y'all to come back amen five it said and the angel I 28 and5 it says and the angel answered and said unto the woman fear not for I know ye seek Jesus which was what y'all killed him they killed him I know you seeking that she's at the grave the woman coming to the grave site to anoint the body they coming Mary was coming to anoint the body of Jesus right say I I know you seek Jesus see what I'm saying people come to church and they coming to church they seeking Jesus but they they might be seeking a dead Jesus see sometime folk come to church they seeking a dead Jesus a historical Jesus a Jesus that died 2,000 years ago they're not seeking a Jesus that's are you with me so this woman that Jesus told him he told his disciples he told told him no man take my life a l time I got power to take it up again that he told him amen that I'm going to I'm going to die but after three days as as Jonah was in the uhh the belly of the whale amen three days three I'm going to get up again I'm getting up amen I talk about Israel as a nation being resurrected now I'm talking about Jesus said I'm getting up amen I got power to get up the Bible said that his flesh should not seek corruption neither was his soul left in hell you know he went to hell for you and me this is the good news of the Gospel that Jesus died and went to hell for you and me and what we should we should have went but Jesus went there for us the Bible said he was made sin he went to the Cross he died that we don't have to die that we can live and have eternal life are you with me so he says he he the angel answered I know you seek Jesus that was crucified amen and some people still that's as far that's as far as they get they seek a Jesus uh uh that's crucified but he said he's not the sixth verse said he's not what I'm going tell you you can go to most churches around the world and they going to tell you I know you seek Jesus but he's not here they might be talking about him but is he really there he's not here but I said you ought to go to a place where Jesus Jesus is here the angel said he's not here and I I I believe that you can go around the globe around Columbia and you can go to church and you can say huh what is this I'm looking for I went it said Church look more like a nightclub than me it said Church she look like Hollywood to me look like these people just playing these people just oh yeah they can sing good they preach good but this ain't something ain't right in here I'm looking for Jesus but somebody said why seek you to liveing among the dead why you going to seek to living among the dead why you going to go to the Grave when he told you that he wasn't going to be there then the Bible said it be rich increasing Goods said I have need of nothing and Jesus was on the outside of the door of the church knocking on the door and they wouldn't let him in are you with me Jesus on the outside of the church knocking on the door and nobody want to let him in why because they're too busy doing their own thing they done forgot all about Jesus and they're trying to entertain you and people so used to being entertained that they don't come to church looking for a resurrected a a living God a God that's alive Hallelujah they want to serve a dead Jesus but not a Jesus that's alive they want to serve a dead God not a God that's alive the woman went to anoint the body she want to she really loved Jesus but they going to anoint the body because they just don't believe he got her see first of all if she would have believe what she what he said she wouldn't have never went there are you with me but she didn't quite catch the Revelation that's why she went went she carried the first message but she wouldn't have never carried that message if she would have believe okay he's not here he's Arisen as he said come see the place where he where the Lord lay and then he says what go quickly seventh verse go quickly and tell his disciples that he is what he's what you know you got to you can't tell nobody except you know for yourself that he's risen see you got to know it amen and people ain't going to believe you anyhow she had met the angel seen the angel looked and saw the grave clothed knew that he wasn't there no more are you with me this woman had first hand she was there are you with me and I'm going tell you something you got to be there amen you got to recognize that there's a Jesus that's alive come on somebody somebody might not believe that he's alive amen but I am a living proof that he's alive he's not dead Hallelujah Jesus rose again I'm telling you we can entertain and have all types of of praise dances and all kind of going on in the church we can have all of that entertainment and you can go away and say I had a nice time this morning but amen we didn't come to entertain we come to preach the gospel and it's the good news of the death Buri and resurrection of Jesus Christ that he died and if if you can't get saved offer that kind of gospel Hallelujah I don't know what you come to do I tell you amen don't come looking for nothing else but a a Jesus that's alive amen amen somebody didn't see him but I thank God that I saw him after his resurrection amen praise God I saw him after he rose he appeared into deciples and showed him his hand and his feet he break bread and he ate with them and they told Thomas th you missed it amen Jesus came to the meeting we sat on and we ate with him Thomas said y'all think I'm going bleed something like that man and they Nails in his hand they pierced him in his side they put him in a tune and they put soldiers to garden and all of that you think I'mma believe I'm going tell you something you know that when you were dead come on somebody trespass in sin you are they any kind of crazy stuff Hallelujah all kind of ungodly filthy stuff are you with me things that you don't even want to say to nobody but God rich in Mercy love me I said he love me but he loves you too Hallelujah amen I'm so glad he loved me I said I'm so glad they say I'm so glad he loved me I'm so glad he died for me Hallelujah something happened yes sir brother Frank something happened to me praise God I couldn't change myself and I couldn't help myself but I know that God helped me hallelujah oh I'mma open their graves and I'm going cause them to come up out of the Grave I'm so glad amen praise God I was a dead I was a dead man amen and I thought I was a liar but I was a sinner amen and he said in Ephesians 2 I don't have time to read it right now and you you has he quickened you has him made alive I'm talking about a three-fold manifestation of a resurrection I know Jesus got up Hallelujah but I'm so glad that I got up Hallelujah I was in darkness I was in the grave but I got up why because I heard the master call he called Lou us one day and he said the L us after four days saken in the grave come forth he said I am the resurrection and I am the life he that liveth and believeth in me do you believe this morning he that liveth and believe in me shall are you with me shall never die I said do are you a Believer you shall never die amen praise God how many you want to live a thousand years as a sinner 10,000 years as a sinner and you know a a man that is born of a woman is a few days full of trouble praise God if there's no tomorrow there's no Hereafter I don't want to live in a world like this 10,000 years a world that's full of Amen praise God I you know I I like the the life that he gave me the life that I used to live I don't like that life no more because I find that Jesus life is way better than the life that I used to have I mean you can have a little Joy but it comes with a lot of Sorrows a lot of pains and a lot of disappointment but the
