Lord we are needy people Lord. Father, we need thee every morning, every day, every hour. We need your grace to run this race. Lord, you said, "But my God should supply all of your needs according to his riches and glory." Father, may you look upon these hands and hearts. Lord, may you meet every need, Father. Father, may you bless your word this morning. called your word to be fruitful and multiply. Oh God, because you know our needs, Lord, you know, oh God, our desires, oh God. And Lord God, you said if and when a man ways, please the Lord. Well Lord, you give him the desires of his heart. So Father God, we want to please you this morning. Oh God, we wanted you to have the preeminence. bless your word now. Save, heal, and deliver in Jesus Christ's wonderful name. Amen. [Music] The book of first Peter 1 and8. 1 Peter 1:18. God is good. Amen. Amen. For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as soul from your vain conversation received by the tradition from your fathers, but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, who verily was forained before the foundation of the world, but was manifested in these last times for you. Who by him do believe in God that raises him up from the dead, and gave him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God. Seeing ye have purified your soul in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfriend love of the brethren. See that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently, being born again, not of corruptible seed, but incorruptible, but by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever. For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man is as the flowers of the grass. The grass whether the flowers thereof fall away. But the word of the Lord endures forever. And this is the word which why the gospel is preached unto you. May God bless you. You may be seated. I was thinking on some things concerning being in the mind of God. But the subject this morning is born of incorruptible seed. Born of incorruptible seed. in being in the mind of God. We know that and I was saying what's what's God IQ? &gt;&gt; What is God IQ? Because sometimes people think that they are more intelligent and they uh they were they are smarter than God. So I asked the question uh what is God's IQ? Uh and sometimes in being in the mind of God I want to know we got to find ourselves in the word and just who are you? The Bible says that God's ways are not our ways and God thoughts are not our thoughts. as far as the heavens are away from the earth. So if God is so broad, he said, "How can I by search and find out God?" You know, it it's very very difficult to understand. For he said, "Eyes have not seen, ear, have not heard, neither have entered in the hearts of man the things that God has prepared for them to love him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he says that we have the mind of Christ. So I'm talking about being born again here in Peter, not of corruptible seed, but incorruptible. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; Born of corrupt incorruptible seed. Born of incorruptible seed. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What does that really in entail? Born of incorruptible seed. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know the Bible says in second says is uh and um the book of acts 2 chapter that his soul was not left in hell neither did his flesh seek corruption. Amen. When lad was in the grave for 4 days and so forth they said by and he said I go and I'm going to wake him up. And then uh his sister said, "Lord, by this time he's stinking." &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; That means that corruption has set in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I've seen people that had cancer and sometimes uh working in the hospital sometime the cancer, Amen. it begin to eat them alive. And sometime you could smell it if you walk on the on the on the floor in the hospital. You could soon you get off the elevator you could smell the cancer they're being eat and different people have different types of infections. So the worms began to uh to set in and corruption began to set in. &gt;&gt; The people begin to rot. Sometime you see a dog or or something on the side of the street a cat been run over and they stink because of eruption has set in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. But the Bible says here, a born of incorruptible seed. We You're born again, not of corruptible, but incorruptible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible tells us that a man that is born of a woman is few days and full of trouble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But here we talking about being born again. &gt;&gt; And that new birth is an incorruptible seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise God. It cannot corrupt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus was born not of the will of man, not the will of the flesh. Amen. But he was born of the will of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus being the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. being the word made flesh that the word itself amen is incorruptible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now here in Matthew 24 and 35, Matthew 24 and35 it tells us here Matthew 24 and35 it says heaven and earth shall what? &gt;&gt; But my words shall not what? pass away. &gt;&gt; Heaven and earth will pass away, but my word should not pass away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. It's better to be in the word. Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Because in the word of God, I got a hiding place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when the heaven and earth pass away, the word is going to be here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be in the word. &gt;&gt; Very important that you be in the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says the word of God is quick. It's powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And piercing even and divide the son even the soul and the spirit and is a discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The word is powerful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. If you Amen. The Jesus said, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word &gt;&gt; that proceedth out of the mouth of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that the word is the seed. The seed is the word. So the seed is the word, the good seed. Amen. &gt;&gt; God s the seed is the word of God. Are you up there? Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "How can he hear without a preacher? And how can he preach except he be sent?" Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith come by hearing and hearing by the what? &gt;&gt; Word of God. &gt;&gt; By the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Very important that you have the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And if you're going to live, if you're going to have life, life, Amen. you're going to have to have the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some people go to church and they got a church religion. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But we need a word birth. &gt;&gt; And God gives the Holy Ghost to give life to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. The latter without the spirit is what? &gt;&gt; Dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we just got the latter. Amen. Praise God. We need the spirit to give life to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the word can live and walk and talk. Come on, &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; So, you you ought to recognize that the word is alive and walking. &gt;&gt; You are the living word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Living epistols. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not written with ink. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But in the fleshest tables of your heart. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Y'all pray for me and I know God is with me. If no one else with you, God is with you. God said, "I never," he said, "I never do it. I never leave you nor I will forsake you." David said, "I once was young, now I'm more." He said, "I never seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed." &gt;&gt; Begging bread. God bless you, uh, preacher. It's good to be here. Thank you for your your love and your kindness. And I want to tell you this before I give you the mic. I'm back here because of your hospitality. Yeah. Preachers are supposed to be of good hospitality, not self-willed. I believe that's the Bible. &gt;&gt; Yes. And so, I thank the Lord for that cuz when I came here, I felt welcome. &gt;&gt; Thank you, everybody. I felt welcome here. I felt love. Bible say if we don't have love, we don't have God. So, thank you y'all. Keep praying for me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Thank you. Praise God. Thank God for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have any questions, we glad to get with you after service. Uh this this way is you got to continue on. He said, "After saving the people out of the land of Egypt, you have to destroy them because the Jews said because of what?" Unbelief, you got to keep on believing. You can't just say, "Well, I'm saved." And then you don't you stop after saving them because they didn't continue on going. Amen. God destroying them. Are you with me? So, you got to keep moving. You got to keep on believing. Keep going forward. Amen. Till you get everything that God has for you. God bless you. Let us stand. They came out of Egypt. They never made it to the promised land. Your promised land is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. If you don't have it, you need to get it. Praise God. Just being baptized, you need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us just bow again. Father, thank you. Thank you for Jesus. Thank you for the spirit of the living God. Thank you for oh God, our young brother D'Angelo and Shanda. Lord, thank you for Ella McCrae. Lord, thank you for moving here this morning. Thank you for all the visitors this morning. Pray God that you'll move in each and every life. We'll see the supernatural God. God take a hold of our lives. See the power and manifestation of the spirit. &gt;&gt; That's what we want. God supernatural respond. God, please be with every family, every home, and every individual. Give traveling mercies to each and everyone. Lord, why are we absent one from the other? God, may you be with each and everyone. In Jesus Christ's name, let us all say amen. [Music]
