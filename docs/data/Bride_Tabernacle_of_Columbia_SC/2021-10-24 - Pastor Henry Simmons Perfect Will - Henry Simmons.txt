your god you cannot fail your god it never fails bless us now bless your word give us so god that satisfying potion father in jesus christ wonderful name we pray amen as we stand this morning for the reading of the word romans 12 this morning was thinking on doing god's service without it being his will but we'll just make it short and we'll talk concerning perfect will perfect will so this morning we god is doing great things for us and in our lives but we just got to praise him like we understand that's what we ought to do amen we need to thank oh god thank him every day for his goodness amen for his mercy endureth forever hallelujah god is so good i'll read the first you read the next and we'll read the latter verse together i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to god which is your reasonable service too the perfect will of god amen for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god has dealt to every man the measure of faith for amen this many members don't think of himself higher than the author thing so many member body amen he says so we being many are one body in christ and every one members one of another six our ministry let us wait on our ministry are he that teaches on teaching eight let love be without dissimilation a that which is evil cleave to that which is good ten not slow for in business firming in spirit serving the lord 12. distributing to the necessity of the saints given to hospitality 14. rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep 16. recompense to no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men 18. dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath for it is written vineyards is mine i will repay said the lord to get 20. together be not overcome with evil but overcome evil with good god bless the religious world you may be seen i thought i would just read part of it but as i began to to read this particular chapter i said i believe that sometimes we have to be reminded how we ought to conduct our lives so i thought this whole chapter was needful that we are reminded of what god is requiring and what he's expecting of us because that latter part it really shows us that he said in the 14th verse says blessed bless them that what it's difficult to do that isn't that right to bless them how do i how do i bless them that persecute me you know it's not many people can perform that uh it takes a god pay love it takes god's love to bless them that persecute you it's usually he said you know don't do evil for evil but overcome evil with good there's so many things in there it says remember he says vengeance is mine i will what i will repay okay so by the grace of god there's so many things that we need to uh you know reacquaint ourselves with this particular chapter and just let us meditate a little bit in it and and let it sink down within our spirit that we allow the holy spirit with inside of us to conduct itself the way god wants to conduct himself and through us amen what i mean is how god wants to live inside of us and express his attributes to us but we must we must yield ourselves to his will and his word amen until we are able to yield ourselves in such a way that god can express his love and express himself through us amen that so much and so the people would say that when they see you they see jesus christ amen they see the love of god they see god expressed through you because your behavior your conduct is a reflection of the love of god amen and that's what we want out of each and every one of our lives we want to amen let people see jesus not us amen so he said let us not think of ourselves more highly than we but to think solely amen see sometimes you know i i was in prayer and i was writing down some things i think i got up to write some things and you know sometimes we believe that god owed us that he's indebted to us that god really owed us and not only the things that we do for god we think that god owe us sometimes the things that we do for god we thank the that the church owed us that the the the ministry owed us so the things that we do for god from our heart sometimes we feel indebted by the way we respond by the way we talk we feel like i've done this and i've done that you know we're talking about let me read that verse that we're talking about this morning the perfect will and trying to do god the service without it being its will and we're talking about the perfect will of god because many times we can walk in the permissive will of god because sometimes it's because amen we we regard so much to god says go ahead as he told balaam he said to balaam you know uh bayrack sent in numbers 22. you can read that sometime and i i i i would read it but it would take a little time to you know that are not familiar you write you know and you can go back to numbers 22 and you can recognize that when uh israel was coming out of egypt and on their way to the promised land that uh mor the king of moab saw them and it called for balaam to come and curse which was a prophet call him to come to curse the children israel because you know sometimes people see that you bless and see what god is doing with you and so people want to see you curse and that's what because of jealousy because they thought they were intimidated by uh by the children of israel and people sometimes are intimidated by your life that you live and because of how god is blessing you and how what god is doing in your life so folks sometimes they get jealous and they want to see you cursed they don't want to see you because they think that what they got is in jeopardy so they think that uh you know israel wanted just to pass on through and go into their promises what god the king of land but uh bayrack uh uh he said uh uh balaam he sent his princess and sent him down now and so you go down and tell um balaam the king sent his princes to tell balaam if you curse this people then i'll give you such and such addition and they came back balaam sought god and and he said well i cannot do it you know i can't go with i can't come with y'all i can't go and they sent again other prince and tell them that i'm gonna i'm gonna tell you i'm gonna give you this and that i'm gonna add to what i said i'll give you and i'm just gonna give you more if you just come and curse this people he said let me go to god and pray and seek god i think it's worth whatever we do in life and whatever we do from day to day we need to consult god we need to ask god is this your will your your perfect will is this what you want done and i believe so many times we believe that just because we are who we are we can do anything we big and bad enough to do you know sometimes you know the school that we attend we usually look at it and we don't pray about it we find out hey uh the reason why i'm gonna go to this school because i can get this the reason why i'm gonna do this this job because it's on but we need to consult god god i want your perfect will to be done see because you you recognize when you're trying to do god a servant without it being at the will are we trying let us not find ourselves out of god's will perfect will and in his permissive will because he permitted it so um he said now he i'm gonna send some more prints you perhaps he said well these princes what no you know i'm gonna send my my right hand man now these are next to me in the throne tell them to come whatever he won't i i'll give it to him if he just come and curse the people they said well tell him go back and tell the king i can't do it god told me you won't he won't let me go so god really knows see sometimes god know what's in our hearts you see god knows what's in our hearts so he said the bailout balance see sometimes you don't even have to listen to something that you know is not the will of god you don't even listen to it just say go on you know but each time i think he he he he considered oh if i could do it you know what i'm saying oh you know we get excited about blessings and we get all working you know and then you go talk talk to god about it god said no don't do it and when we talk to god about it god said it's not no matter how excited and what they're offering that's not my will are you with me i don't want you to do it okay but god seeing that you're entertaining you know god look at you and see how you really entertaining it and he knows your heart right god sees your heart and what you desire and what you want it doesn't matter what you say i can't go i can't go god said well i'm gonna come to bail him you want to go in in other words i know you want to go and the next time they come and they send another i want you to go you listen go wear them but you when you go i want you to you can't i want you to say only what i say see so he went with him and then you remember the donkey began to talk with a man voice [Music] and bail him with him and beat him because the angel was getting to take bail of life see god allowed him to go but yet the angel was right there with a sword drawn back to take balaam's life but actually the donkey saw the angel but balaam was so you know sometimes we can't see because we're so blind by promotion and what we want to go in life and well how how high and what's being offered for us sometimes we're so blind but the the the donkey even saw but the man couldn't even see the angel maybe if he was spiritual enough he could see the angel if he wasn't so caught up with this what how well he could think about all the wealth and all the promotion that he's gonna get probably going down the road and the duck is stopping man what you doing stopping me on my turn i'm going to get you know so he he actually would and the doctor talking to him he didn't even realize the donkey was talking you know sometimes we so caught up the donkey talking oh you know somebody said the dog was talking it meant the cat was talking everything the birds was talking everything's trying to tell you don't do this and don't do that and you're going children telling you husband telling your wife telling you everybody telling you don't do it you're gonna listen why because you're thinking about what promotion what's what what what i'm getting off of your eyes ain't on it's not the will of god god don't want you to do that but you will continuously you're thinking about your own selfish desire my this is what i want and and god knows what you want amen so by the grace of god y'all know the story amen when balaam got ready to try to curse the people he blessed them amen so he could do nothing but what god said he blessed him and bale balak said did not call you up here to catch the people and you turn around you bless you say what god has done i cannot turn it around i can't do nothing about that i don't know i can only say what the lord say oh you look man so don't worry about the thing when the enemy try to curse you the enemy can't do nothing but bless you are you with me amen no matter what they do to try to stop you on the job in the school wherever you're endeavored just keep your heart right amen praise god bless them that curse you bless them that persecute you amen don't render evil for evil but overcome evil with good are you what man now by the grace of god so as we look at that particular incident then we understand that there were many incidents in the bible where people were permitted you know israel was permitted a king because they was not satisfied with samuel uh so god permitted them to have a king but the king was going to take him through some hardships but they would rather go through the hardships because they wanted to be like the rest of the people you know sometimes we want to be like the rest of the world you see what the oh the rest of the teenagers doing what the rest of the children doing amen they doing this they doing that and i feel deprived i'm a christian and why i can't do that those other people are christian but yet they they got their boyfriend their girlfriend and they're going out to party and i can't party you know they're drinking they're smoking their you know they're having um relationships outside of marriage and they're doing all kind of stuff i'm missing out and you seem to be deprived and uh you're in a jailhouse and i'm in prison i need to be free amen so here it is you know we we feel so deprived we feel so miserable we feel so uncomfortable being a christian not realizing the amen as the young prodigal son didn't know like realized that his father house was better than the pig pen that he was going to end up in the slop that uh that the way the devil was going to take him he didn't know where he was going to end up in and some folks don't know that they end up in hell by making the wrong choice are you what man we need to consider what god a will and purpose is for our lives not what we want but what god wants with us and for our lives but sometimes we so caught up in the moment till all we want to do is what mine i want to live in my life i'm going to live it the way i want to live it and whoa you know it's like amen that god don't wake us up in the morning god don't give us health and strength it we we get it because we are privileged to give in god is indebted to us and you know like god owed us amen something are you with me i i said god oh god i i don't know sometimes we get a little high-minded we get to get a little lifted up in pride we get a little uh amnesia we don't recognize that god is such a good god the bible said know ye that that the lord he's god it is him that made us not we ourselves are you with me amen god is a maker amen god amen is the part of we are the clay amen praise god thank god let him mold us and make us a vessel of honor are you with me lord not my will but let your i want your will your perfect will and i don't want to try to do you a service without it being your will amen even though david with the ark of the covenant he wanted to uh you know it was in the hands of the enemy and and david wanted to come back to israel where the he wanted the presence of god was we know the presence of god with the ark and the ark of god and he sent them to go get the ark and bring it back home to its rightful place and all but you know and david wanted the ark to come back they went to get it but they put it on ox cots and when they went together they was bringing it back on oxcock and the ark was never to be carried on and when the ox cot uh when uh it stumbled because it was carried the oxen stomach and the looked like it was gonna fall one of the servants put forth his hand and he died you with me so what happened if he would have consulted the lord god wanted his presence to be with you but it was a way that god had ordained god provided way for that day are you with me and we're going to do it the way we want see sometimes we we just can't you know you know the art you know bring the presents back and the word back to the people and all that but it's a way that god want to do it you just can't do it because oh yes this is the will of god i know god said it i know god is with us and yeah all that is good but have you considered god have you prayed about it is it the will of god for you is it the will of god i know amen dustin did died and that one did this but what is the will of god for your life oh you look me you say well uh i've seen no no no what is the will of god for your life amen see here in romans it tells us there's a mini-member body and all don't have the same gifts amen but but god it gave some this and some that amen so you must recognize what god will and purpose is for you as an individual and mama cannot identify you what god wants to do in your life daddy can't do it the preacher can't do it it has to be you as an individual getting with god and god positionally placed you in the body god dealing with you as an individual and you say god what is your purpose for my life what is your will for my life what would please you lord because that's what i want i want to please you amen i want to know that amen you are pleased with well please with the way i live the way i conduct my life i want you to i want to know god that i'm in the prophet will of god that i'm not just going to come into church and going through the motion but lord i'm in your perfect will hey god let let god be glorified let god be glorified i think sometimes we're not conscious enough and we're not listening to him amen we we have to humble ourselves and allow god to speak to us and god to talk with us and minister us amen we're so busy asking god for what we want to god amen want to supply all your needs amen according to his riches in glory but we sometimes what we need amen we don't want and what we want we don't need are you with me so we we need to listen to god amen and allow god to speak to us amen and minister to us to bring us to that place where we need to be are you it's it's it's many things amen and uh i noticed uh as the ministry come forth people get excited when they see the supernatural when they see the holy ghost come and uh i feel folks and let's just go to acts eight uh for a moment i i won't be long i look like i've uh i i i i've gotten way ahead of myself and and expressing certain things and but by the grace of god i want you to know that amen god has a plan god has a purpose for each and every one of us as individuals amen and and i'm going to tell you something once you uh once you zero in and once you focus in on god's purpose and god's plan for your life nobody can steal your way because god amen has dealt with you as an individual god has filled you with his spirit amen he given you a vision amen because without a vision that people perish amen because god gives you a vision it gives you a plan that you can walk in it amen praise god and you know amen praise god that god has a gain amen desperate this way for your life amen and nobody can do anything to curse you or take that away what god has for me it is it is for me amen i don't care who amen tried to resist or try to stop you amen they cannot curse what god has a bless amen praise god i said touch not in my anointing and do my what prophet has no harm amen god has a way he should hurt not the oil not the wine are you with me god has a plan and a will and a purpose amen praise god once you get in that particular channel amen praise god once you begin to operate in that particular channel watch him at the holy ghost begin to flow praise god watch the blessings begin to flow watch god begin to move in your life praise god we need to see god move in us as individuals not as a group collectively but as individuals and when individuals begin to get in the channel of the spirit you'll find that the church is on fire because each an individual has his ordained purpose amen praise god i'm walking in praise god i'm walking in victory because i'm walking in god's plan for my life amen i'm walking in victory praise god we want to walk in victory praise god acts 8 and uh 16. i i started 15 first excuse me who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the holy ghost you know philip had a revival then samaritan and he baptized several folk but in miracles and signs and wonders went forth but the people still didn't have the holy ghost how many think sometimes miracles signed going forward people baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and yet they don't have the holy ghost as a whole philip baptized them miracles and so forth and but they didn't have the holy ghost yet see sometimes people because they got baptized they think i got the holy ghost see that don't mean you got the holy ghost don't you see miracles right around you and signs and oneness yeah they didn't have the holy ghost yet so he says here for if you read this eighth chapter you see uh i i look at the 13th verse and and simon himself believe also simon was a witchcraft witch doctor a software root doctor you all know what root doctors is in south carolina okay i know if he was in new york you wouldn't know oh they know i knew y'all too okay say and simon himself believe also and when he was baptized he continued with philip and one and behold in the what the miracles then signed which was what see sometimes that don't mean because of miracles and signs and wonders you know you can be around the holy ghost and you can see what the holy ghost does amen but to just to be around it and see what it does it doesn't mean that you got it because uh some uh the preacher got it uh a sister song song got it and mama got it that don't mean you got it oh i've seen the blind eyes open i seen the walking i even seen the dead raise but that you saw all of that but you that don't mean you got the holy ghost well i go to a church with the i know the uh count is here i heard sister betty give a testimony and i heard i saw brother frank and what god did for their lives oh i know god is moving but what about you you got to have your own fire amen you got to build your own fire you got to have the holy ghost for yourself are you with me now simon was a little bit he saw what was going on and he knew he was missing out on something though he had you know he could do some things with witchcraft but he knew that the holy ghost was doing things that he couldn't do amen so he got a little hey hey what's going on now the bible said simon bewitched the people i had the people all spelled by by his witchcraft but simon himself came and got back oh look i i better read on 14 verse 9 when the apostles which were jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god they sent unto them peter and john who when they were come down prayed for them that they might what receive the holy ghost are you with me we got to work this thing together we got to see amen the part that you play and the part that i play in part the sister so-and-so now you can't sing be a good prayer warrior don't don't try to say well she can sing unchained come on if you if you're a good league good type player don't you mess with the organ or don't you mess with the socks amen because god has to bless your fingers and you can play like god and somebody said well i can play the league gut talk too yeah you can but when you're trying to do god a servant without it being his will no you know god's will is his word and if you want to know whether or not it's the will of god for you you'll see whether or not god what blesses it and if god don't bless it don't try to bless it yourself you know folks will try to convince you i'm gonna tell you something how you know people out of the will of god they go around and try to convince everybody else that they're in the will of god i didn't say that that's just said [Laughter] okay so so you you understand y'all understand once folks are trying to convince you that it's the will of god for their life they're just trying to prove it to you and convince you nine out of ten is not the will of god because you don't have here to speak for itself god interprets his own word by what fulfilling it are you with me so uh by the grace of god i i i can't even finish this it's so good till i can't finish it brother fred but god undo what he said he'll do so we see here this man here he says for as yet for as yet he was falling upon none of them only they were baptized in what the father son holy ghost in the name of the what lord jesus where did they get that father son holy ghost from because they didn't know the name of the father son holy ghost they start repeating the title father son the holy ghost because they didn't know that jesus said i come in my father's name and you don't receive me but if another come in his own name him you would receive right jesus said and she should bring forth the son that i should call the name of jesus listen if he said baptized in the name of the father son holy ghost you would know the name of the son is jesus christ so you say well i know the name of the son and the confident which is the holy ghost the father's gonna send it in my name okay he's gonna send it in jesus name so you know the name of the holy ghost it's jesus because he said i'm walking with you and i shall be what the bible says without controversy the great is the mystery of god and this god was manifested in the flesh justified in the spirit scene of angels preaching to the gentiles believed only in the world see you up in the glory isn't that right same god amen god with us god in us amen the same god amen that was with us the same god god in us praise god emmanuel was which means interpreted god with us jesus was god with us are you with me so we are baptized in the name of the lord jesus because that's the way the book of acts had it are you with me and then laid their hands on them and they would receive what and when simon saw that through the land there on the apostles hands the holy ghost was given he offered them what let me tell you something a lot of folk think that amen that they can do that god is indebted to them because of the money they come to church and they put money in you see how people try to rule the church because of how much money they pay they think they i give so much money god owed me to church over me because i put so much money in there and and i i i don't have to put my money in there oh lord you think god care about your money do you think god is pope see people don't realize how rich god is amen god is if he was hungry he wouldn't ask you for nothing if he was thirsty he wouldn't even ask you for a drink amen that counts on a thousand heels down here amen i never saw what right oh lord isn't that right do y'all believe you would be all right doesn't matter amen god will take care of his children all you got to do is walk in his perfect will and god will take care of you he'll fight your battles he'll do whatever needs to be done if you walk in his perfect wheel oh yes god is a good god oh he wanted to bond with money i'm going to tell you something don't get your eyes on money praise god you get your eyes on money you get out the will of god because money don't perish what do you say he said saying give uh you know and peter said unto him thy money what not this 21st he said that money what prayer is with thee because thou had thought that the gift of god may be what some folks say i pay my tithes and my offering so i feel like the church old me when i get sick i'll leave the church out to pay my bills i lose a job i believe the church owed me are you what man yeah i don't mean that that but don't don't think that in your spirit amen i believe the it's enough a love of god around that i believe the saints will see about one another i believe that they meant the love of god is in the saints hard to love one another and to help one another amen they're not gonna let you down amen but i if you think that uh they owe you something then you got and my brother max said you think again that was one of his things you think again amen because god the church don't owe you because what you gave you gave it to god if you gave it to the church then church owe you everything are you with me what you do for the lord amen that's going to last but what you do to please men or for men that's why men are going to come in that day say lord lord then i cast out devils then i don't know he said it apart from me your word was of indicative why because their heart wasn't right they didn't do it amen amen because god gave them the gift and god gave them the money god gave them the blessings they did because amen somebody some folk payday tithes that god said i'll open the wonder to heaven and you won't have room enough to receive and not because he gonna bless you back praise god i i'm not serving god for because he's already given me enough when he died on the cross and saved me that was all right enough and nothing i can do to pay for that nothing i can do to replace that god already
