[34:43] from 2005
[34:45] and it had in there uh the New Poke
[34:50] and and that was 2005. And it says the
[34:54] New Poke. Then I had up on it. There has
[34:57] there was a Pharaoh that royal rose up
[34:59] that knew not Joseph.
[35:02] And then I had the new pope and I said,
[35:05] "Well, you know, this is 2005
[35:08] and here I got this." And so I let my
[35:10] wife look at I said, "You know, I wrote
[35:13] that in 2005. I probably hadn't seen
[35:16] this book in years." And you just just
[35:19] doing some cleaning and stuff and say,
[35:21] "Here's some some of your old books." I
[35:23] looked at that book. I said, "Lord, what
[35:25] are you saying?"
[35:27] and
[35:29] the a pharaoh that wanted to kill all
[35:34] the children that was male children that
[35:37] was 2 years and under.
[35:41] Pharaoh wasn't going to recognize
[35:43] Joseph.
[35:45] And I said, "Lord, maybe it's a Pharaoh
[35:47] that won't recognize the bride anymore.
[35:51] Won't recognize the bride."
[35:54] Amen.
[35:56] So I says, "Wait, maybe that's just
[35:58] something." I said, "It came into my
[35:59] spirit. Thought I'd just mention it to
[36:01] you." And because it was just laying
[36:04] there, I says, "You got a new pope?" And
[36:07] this is said new pope. Okay. I don't
[36:10] know whether we had one in 2005, but
[36:14] it it just sprung out to me. Amen. But
[36:16] by the grace of God, real power. When we
[36:19] think of power,
[36:21] you know, we think about the the power
[36:25] of the dollar,
[36:28] but we talking about real power. We know
[36:31] that with God is
[36:34] humbleness.
[36:36] So then we had, you know, let's go to
[36:40] Timothy here so you can kind of follow
[36:43] me.
[36:46] Second Timothy 3 there. Second Timothy
[36:48] 3.
[36:50] I told Caleb, "If something happened to
[36:53] me this morning, he can back me up." So
[36:56] he said, "Okay, Dad. I'll back you up
[36:59] cuz I have was having trouble with my
[37:01] voice and stuff." So by the grace of
[37:04] God, but God is good. Amen. Amen.
[37:19] Let's second Timothy 3
[37:22] and uh one. 2 Timothy 3 and1.
[37:27] Just know also that in the last days
[37:31] perilous times shall come. I think we're
[37:33] here.
[37:35] Dangerous times is coming. You believe
[37:37] that? Amen. For men shall be lovers of
[37:40] their what? Ownelves.
[37:43] coverages, boasters, what? Proud. Proud.
[37:48] We want to talk about
[37:51] uh humbling oursel and so forth. And the
[37:53] real power comes through humility.
[37:57] But we're going to find out the opposite
[37:59] of humility is being proud.
[38:03] And we got to deal with that every day
[38:07] because we got to deal with ourselves
[38:10] because
[38:12] you know it was I was thinking about in
[38:14] my childhood
[38:16] the teacher was always right. You
[38:19] couldn't tell your mama the teacher was
[38:20] wrong. I mean we couldn't. Y'all some of
[38:23] y'all probably could. I couldn't. I
[38:25] don't know about you, brother Pete. I
[38:27] don't think we could do that.
[38:29] And we could tell if if an elder person
[38:32] in neighborhood say something right and
[38:35] or wrong or indifferent.
[38:37] If they had age on them,
[38:40] see back then we thought 35, 40 was old.
[38:44] Don't let a person be 50 or 60 years
[38:46] old. Man, you better shut your mouth. If
[38:50] they say something, you ought to you had
[38:52] all the utmost respect because if they
[38:55] tell your mom or daddy on you, brother
[38:58] Fred, that's you know that meant some
[38:59] ain't it? Hey, you better not. So it was
[39:04] respect for the elders.
[39:07] You had respect for the elders. You had
[39:09] respect for the uh preachers. You had
[39:12] respect for, you know, those that were
[39:14] in public office. You It was just a a
[39:17] time of respect.
[39:20] And um people just Yes ma'am. Yes sir.
[39:24] Well when the people came from the north
[39:26] they said don't say yes ma'am yes sir.
[39:28] So that's slavery mentality.
[39:31] But
[39:33] you know they couldn't they couldn't
[39:35] knock that out of us. We still Yes. Yes
[39:38] ma'am. Somebody told me the other day I
[39:40] was in the gym and the guy said I said
[39:43] yes sir. And he probably is in his 50s
[39:46] late 50s or so. He He was white. He
[39:49] says, "No, no, no. I ain't like that.
[39:54] I ain't from Ryan." You know, don't say,
[39:56] "Oh, yes. Yes, sir." To me, I said, "I
[39:58] even tell children, yes, ma'am. Yes,
[40:00] sir." He said, he said, "Well, no, don't
[40:02] do me like that at all. Don't don't say
[40:05] that to me." You know, I you know, we we
[40:09] were just learning, you know, and you
[40:11] know, even selling newspaper around the
[40:13] military base. I don't even know what
[40:15] they say. Yes, ma'am. Yes, sir. in the
[40:18] military anymore, but it's Yes, sir.
[40:20] Sergeant. Yes, sir. So, you had that
[40:22] it's almost built in you and but people
[40:27] probably don't don't even respect the
[40:29] presidents and don't even the respect is
[40:33] going out to wonder for one another.
[40:37] But
[40:38] when you respect people, it shows us a
[40:41] deal of humility and humbleness. Respect
[40:44] your parents. Honor your parents and
[40:46] respect them. You know what I'm saying?
[40:48] But children don't respect their
[40:50] parents. They think,
[40:52] let a child get in a grown folk
[40:54] conversation, there a shoe coming your
[40:56] way or anything they can pick up. The
[40:58] grown folk talking you
[41:01] the way I was raised. I don't know how
[41:02] y'all raised with grown folk talking.
[41:04] You ain't got nothing to say.
[41:07] Are you with me?
[41:09] But children like they grown and they
[41:10] don't they have no so much to say just
[41:13] like you. We talking about harming
[41:14] yourself. Children are jumping your
[41:16] conversation like they know what they
[41:18] talking about and don't know they don't
[41:20] know a bit more what they talking about.
[41:23] Well, they think they do. They think
[41:24] they on your level. Amen. Are you with
[41:27] me? But they ain't they on the level
[41:30] they ought to keep your mouth closed. Do
[41:32] you want to find out?
[41:35] I ain't going to say that in the future,
[41:37] but
[41:39] but
[41:40] it you know when you find out that
[41:43] you're not on a personal level, I I I
[41:45] often times tell a story about my
[41:47] cousin. He was straight A student all
[41:49] the way through college and doctor so
[41:52] and so on and he was a professor in
[41:55] college and all. Uh, and I I I said
[41:59] something. I tried to say a little
[42:00] vocabulary
[42:02] for about 2 minutes or 3 minutes and he
[42:05] was saying all kind of word. I Oh, Lord.
[42:08] I never do that again. Let me stay on my
[42:10] level
[42:14] and he did it in a nice way. He was just
[42:17] talking and I said, "Oh, he done lost me
[42:19] all the way cuz he was very very
[42:22] intelligent." And and I'm I'm saying
[42:25] let's respect people, you know, on their
[42:28] level and um and then go and and stay in
[42:32] your lane.
[42:33] I can use it use it that way. Stay in
[42:35] your lane. Stay and you comfortable as
[42:38] you stay in your lane. No matter where
[42:39] you go in the world, if you stay in your
[42:41] lane, you you can get respect. Amen. But
[42:44] when you and you don't have to be you
[42:46] don't have to uh have a complex against
[42:49] somebody that know more than you or got
[42:52] more than you. You don't have to have
[42:54] that complex
[42:55] because you you are who you are. That's
[42:57] right. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. And they
[43:01] can't be you. Amen. Amen. They might
[43:04] have more money in the bank. They might
[43:06] have a bigger house and all of that, but
[43:08] don't you don't worry about that. Thank
[43:10] God for I'm saved. Amen. Amen. Thank God
[43:14] for being me. Amen. Oh, but some people
[43:18] are lifted up.
[43:20] That's why it's not real power because
[43:23] some people because of what they got
[43:25] lift them up in pride.
[43:28] Maybe I get there. Let me let me let me
[43:31] let me Some things that lift people up
[43:34] in pride. What they got, what kind of
[43:36] car they got, what kind of job they got,
[43:38] what kind of education they got. They
[43:40] cause them to be proud.
[43:43] It's a subtle pride
[43:46] because no one want to think of
[43:47] themselves as being that subtle.
[43:50] So the devil sneaks in and he have you
[43:53] to glorify yourself
[43:56] or to think you better than somebody
[43:58] else.
[43:59] So the devil, we all have sin and come
[44:01] shout to the Lord. Glory to God. And if
[44:04] we ever going to make it, it's going to
[44:05] be by the grace of God. Amen. Amen. So
[44:08] we don't have nobody that we can esteem
[44:10] greater than the other. Amen. Amen.
[44:16] If God let God lift you up. Don't try to
[44:19] lift yourself up. Amen.
[44:24] You know it's another thing. The more
[44:28] intelligence you got, the more demons
[44:31] you got to fight.
[44:33] The more money you got, the more demons
[44:36] you got to fight. You see what I'm
[44:38] saying? The brother who said, "Well, as
[44:42] much given as much required."
[44:45] That's what brother Fred said this
[44:46] morning. Uh uh but you're going to be
[44:50] responsible
[44:51] even for the message that I you have
[44:54] this message and you know going as much
[44:57] being given to you, it's going to be
[44:58] much required. Amen. Because you got a
[45:01] lot. You got more than just walking into
[45:03] a church and or whatever. You got more
[45:06] than that. Amen. It's the opening of the
[45:09] word. And as we were studying this
[45:11] morning and said we got way more. So we
[45:15] we're more responsible because God has
[45:17] given us much. We're more responsible.
[45:21] Brother Brooks would laugh at me
[45:23] sometime. I may say something, but
[45:25] that's where I'm at. I'm living where
[45:27] I'm at. He said, "You didn't know you
[45:28] hurt that person feeling. No, I didn't
[45:30] know it.
[45:31] I said, "If I have known it, I wouldn't
[45:32] have said it." You know what I'm saying?
[45:35] But I was calling it as I saw it.
[45:38] A fellow might have thought he preaching
[45:40] a little good sermon. I said, "Man, what
[45:42] in the world you were talking about?"
[45:46] And and brother Brook said, "You heard
[45:49] that man feeling?" I said, "I didn't
[45:52] know it. If I had known it, I wouldn't
[45:53] have said it." He said, "I know you
[45:54] didn't know it. I just found it." But
[45:57] see, he was very sensitive to that. I
[46:01] wasn't. But did I mean any harm? No. You
[46:05] see what I'm saying? So I'm saying, but
[46:08] if I knew better, I can do better. If I
[46:12] knew I was going to hurt you, I wouldn't
[46:13] have said it. Are you with me? So we're
[46:17] respecting one another. He said that.
[46:18] But I know you didn't know. Oh. I said,
[46:21] "Okay." Well, that person didn't know. I
[46:24] didn't know. You know what I'm saying?
[46:27] But he knew knowing me he know I didn't
[46:29] know.
[46:30] Are you with me? And sometimes do you
[46:33] think people know you and you say
[46:36] something they get all pumped up mad and
[46:39] all that and you even know you're
[46:40] offending them, right? Okay. Why am I
[46:44] working with hum I mean real power?
[46:47] Because we're trying to get into real
[46:48] power but we got to get in real power
[46:50] but understanding what's holding us up.
[46:54] Okay. So he says, "Um, goodness.
[47:00] Where you where I'm at, Caleb?"
[47:03] Huh?
[47:05] I'm still there. Lord have mercy. I'm
[47:07] slow. For men shall be lovers of their
[47:10] own self, covetous, boasters, proud.
[47:12] That's why I was blaspheing, disobedient
[47:15] to parents, unwhat
[47:18] and unholy without what? Natural.
[47:22] You know, people don't have natural Oh,
[47:24] I ain't getting none of that. That's
[47:25] that's a political subject. You know,
[47:27] that's not political correct to natural
[47:30] affection. Men don't men with men and
[47:32] women with women. Don't don't don't say
[47:34] nothing about that. That's just to you
[47:37] know, you get you're messing with the
[47:38] wrong stuff. Natural affection.
[47:42] Things that people ought not to do, they
[47:45] do it anyhow. And you better not say
[47:48] nothing about it because it's not
[47:50] political correct.
[47:52] But we got to tell say what the word of
[47:54] God say, right? Can't hold back because
[47:57] you're going to be responsible and
[47:58] you're going to stand before God one
[47:59] day. Amen.
[48:02] Women want to dress like men and men
[48:04] want to dress like women want to look
[48:06] like a woman and the woman want to look
[48:08] like a man.
[48:10] The man want to see how cute he can be
[48:13] and the woman want to see how manly she
[48:16] can be.
[48:17] Okay.
[48:22] Without national natural affection.
[48:24] Amen.
[48:32] God is good. Amen. Amen.
[48:36] Truth breakers. People won't tell the
[48:39] truth no more.
[48:41] False accusers. People will false accuse
[48:44] you in a minute.
[48:47] I mean, they just think, well, the Lord
[48:50] showed me that that falsely accusing,
[48:52] you know, the Lord ain't show them a
[48:54] thing,
[48:57] you know, but the Lord showed me this.
[49:00] Lord told me that and they accuse you
[49:03] because they said, "Lord,
[49:06] I saw it in a dream." Just keep the
[49:10] keep that to yourself. And sometimes,
[49:12] you know, just pray for your brother or
[49:14] sister even if the Lord showed it to you
[49:16] because you can be f you can be falsely
[49:18] wrong.
[49:20] Accusing a person or something. Oh, I
[49:23] know him. You come on.
[49:27] I know him. I know this one. I know
[49:29] that. When you think you know somebody,
[49:33] be careful
[49:35] cuz people change every day. Amen.
[49:38] People learn, they grow.
[49:41] They're not what they used to be. Amen.
[49:44] Amen. Amen. But you looking back over
[49:47] years, but the people grow up. Amen. You
[49:50] grow up.

[50:04] judgmental, but now I kind of understand
[50:07] life has made me understand people
[50:09] better. Amen. Things better. Amen.
[50:12] things that we used to do because we

[50:16] world that uh that has gotten so dark
[50:21] and and sometimes we just trying to be a
[50:23] little light because, you know, it was
[50:25] one time we we were we could just hammer
[50:29] and we can, you know, go all out with

[50:37] them back in. Amen. People have gone so
[50:40] far and the world is so dark till we

[50:45] and little by little we just realize we
[50:47] just can't just pile it all on them like
[50:49] we used to just stay just straight
[50:51] forward

[54:39] God. You see, they have a form of
[54:41] godliness, but they what?

[1:00:32] Isaiah 57
[1:00:34] and 15. Isaiah 57-15.
[1:00:38] But it's too much playing church,
[1:00:42] playing around, all this dancing in the
[1:00:45] church. Get your partner and all that. I
[1:00:48] ain't get no partner. I
[1:00:50] Lord have mercy. And that's dance for
[1:00:53] the Lord,
[1:00:55] man. I ain't Uhuh.
[1:00:57] Some of the most filthy looking dances.
[1:01:01] I ain't talking about them.
[1:01:03] You know what I'm saying? talking about
[1:01:05] right among so-called message people and
[1:01:10] they really having a good time they
[1:01:11] partying in the church
[1:01:14] but I'm talking about we got to get the
[1:01:15] real spirit and anointing of God we got
[1:01:18] to know there's a difference but it God
[1:01:23] the thousand rams or 10,000 of all we
[1:01:28] but we want God has required humility
[1:01:32] getting yourself out of real power comes
[1:01:34] you humbly yourself. Amen. That's where
[1:01:37] real power will come from. You got to
[1:01:39] get out the way. Amen.
[1:01:43] Uh-uh. You know, if Jesus was speaking
[1:01:46] here this morning, you know, when you
[1:01:47] tell Jesus, well, I don't know you out
[1:01:50] the way. I said, if it was Jesus
[1:01:52] speaking, you would do the same thing.
[1:01:55] Some people going to be criticized. And
[1:01:56] if Jesus himself was standing there
[1:01:58] before them, they criticize Jesus
[1:02:00] Christ. Because Jesus would be telling
[1:02:02] them the truth and they know so much
[1:02:04] about God that he'd be just like the
[1:02:06] Pharisees. They wouldn't pay him no
[1:02:08] attention. Why? Because they know more
[1:02:10] about it than Jesus knows.
[1:02:13] Are you with me? And that's what I saw,
[1:02:16] you know, in in in this message as I was
[1:02:19] praying. I said, you know, even if Jesus
[1:02:21] was talking to people, they wouldn't
[1:02:23] listen to Jesus because they already got
[1:02:25] everything they think they need.
[1:02:28] So, you couldn't your your your message
[1:02:30] is not is is not effective to them
[1:02:33] because all they want to do is what?
[1:02:36] Hear good things and go home and and
[1:02:38] talk about how good the message is even
[1:02:40] though they didn't even understand it
[1:02:43] because it didn't touch them. It was no
[1:02:46] change in their life. It was it was good
[1:02:49] message. It felt good. Amen. It was
[1:02:52] nice. It was it was articulated good. It
[1:02:55] was, you know, really inspirational. But
[1:02:58] I don't want I want something that's
[1:03:00] going to knock me out out of my I want
[1:03:04] something that's going to bring
[1:03:05] conviction into me and and going to
[1:03:07] cause me to go home and get on my knees
[1:03:09] and say, "God, I want more of you."
[1:03:11] Amen. Uh to bring me to the altar and
[1:03:14] say, "Lord, let me cry. I'll get
[1:03:16] something for you." Amen. Amen. Lord,
[1:03:18] how much is Where is the people that
[1:03:21] really want God? Amen. Really want to
[1:03:24] get a hold of God. Amen. Really want to
[1:03:26] see change in their life. Amen.
[1:03:30] It's got to be somebody want it. Amen.
[1:03:33] Amen. Sometimes I just want to preach on
[1:03:35] the corner.
[1:03:37] But I said, "God, give me my voice back.
[1:03:39] I want to preach."
[1:03:42] Amen.
[1:03:43] I said, "Lord, you know my desire." I
[1:03:46] said, "You know that devil know what's
[1:03:49] laying ahead, then he come throw all
[1:03:51] kind of affliction on you. You know when
[1:03:53] you trying to press your way through,
[1:03:54] trying to fast more, trying to do this
[1:03:56] more, the devil,
[1:03:58] man, he he come the prophet said he'll
[1:04:01] do that." He said, "Don't speak it cuz
[1:04:02] the devil come with everything
[1:04:05] to try to stop you, hinder you." Are you
[1:04:07] with me? And that's what's been
[1:04:10] happening. When you when you start going
[1:04:11] in the right direction, what the devil
[1:04:14] do? Man, he'll bombard you with
[1:04:16] everything. Why? Because you're going
[1:04:18] down the right path. Before then,
[1:04:20] you know, you free. But when you start
[1:04:23] getting right with God and begin to get
[1:04:25] somewhere with God, the devil come at
[1:04:27] you with everything he got because he's
[1:04:29] trying to stop you. Amen. And I thank
[1:04:32] God.
[1:04:36] Uh what what I say, Isaiah.
[1:04:41] Okay, Kevin, you got me. You going to
[1:04:42] start reading then I won't have to
[1:04:44] start. Maybe you get further than me.
[1:04:50] That's all right. Whereas thou has been
[1:04:55] forsaken and hated.
[1:04:58] I'm in the right place here.
[1:05:02] 57. I go ahead on. I was reading the
[1:05:05] wrong place. Go ahead. Leave your Puerto
[1:05:07] Rican
[1:05:08] 57-15. For thus sayith the high and
[1:05:11] lofty one, oh okay, that inhabited
[1:05:13] eternity, whose name is holy, I dwell in
[1:05:17] the high and the holy place with him
[1:05:19] also that is of a contrite and humble
[1:05:23] spirit to contrite and humble. We don't
[1:05:25] have enough humble people no more,
[1:05:29] especially in America.
[1:05:32] Enough humble people. You wonder why
[1:05:34] where's the power? because there's no
[1:05:35] humility there
[1:05:37] and and and we don't have the power of
[1:05:39] go brother came from Zam you're talking
[1:05:42] about the power of God and how the power
[1:05:43] moves and how the gifts operate how the
[1:05:46] they got prophets and people seeing
[1:05:48] visions dreams I what happened the
[1:05:52] humility having a form of godliness but
[1:05:55] denying the power I know we see it in
[1:05:57] here we see it over here and over there
[1:05:59] a little here a little there but we
[1:06:00] ought to be more
[1:06:03] we ought to have more than what we Amen.
[1:06:05] I thank God for what we got because I
[1:06:07] thank God for y'all. I appreciate y'all.
[1:06:10] Thank God for y'all. Amen. Amen. We
[1:06:12] might be a faithful few, but I thank God
[1:06:14] for the faithful few. Amen. Amen.
[1:06:18] So he says, "The high and lost one that
[1:06:21] dwelleth
[1:06:23] uh that with him that also that is of a
[1:06:27] contrite and a humble spirit to what?
[1:06:31] to revive the spirit of the humble to
[1:06:34] revive the heart of the contrite ones.
[1:06:37] To revive the hearts of the contrite
[1:06:39] ones, the humble ones. Have we Have we
[1:06:43] just said, "Lord, I want to walk humbly.
[1:06:47] Lord, I want to be humble." Because
[1:06:50] sometimes we have to tell the Lord,
[1:06:52] "Help me to help me to humble myself."
[1:06:57] Like I said, my old bishop, Bishop,
[1:06:58] Bishop Washington used always say, he
[1:07:00] said, you don't ever want God to humble
[1:07:03] you. He said, you ask God to help you
[1:07:07] humble yourself cuz he said, humble
[1:07:10] yourself before the mighty hand of God
[1:07:12] that he might exalt you, right? Humble
[1:07:15] yourself. Real power comes through
[1:07:17] humility. You know, when Jesus was given
[1:07:20] a name above every name, he the Bible
[1:07:22] said God has highly exalted him. Why?
[1:07:26] Because he humbled himself.
[1:07:29] Are you with me? And then his power came
[1:07:32] through his humility. He was given a
[1:07:34] name above every name. That at the name
[1:07:37] of Jesus, you know when uh Jacob name
[1:07:40] was changed to Israel. Amen. Is when he
[1:07:44] got on the back when he got grabbed a
[1:07:46] hold to the angel and he knew his
[1:07:47] condition and he said, "I'm not going to
[1:07:49] let you go till you what? Bless me."
[1:07:51] Amen. I know I know I'm not right. And I
[1:07:54] need to be changed. And I know I need
[1:07:56] God because I'm going to meet my enemy.
[1:08:00] Amen. I'm going to meet my brother. And
[1:08:02] I know my brother I did it wrong. But
[1:08:06] Lord help me because I'm in jeopardy of
[1:08:09] dying and kill me. But he wrestled with
[1:08:13] the angel till God says he's a prince
[1:08:15] with God and he had a name change. And
[1:08:18] I'm telling you, God want to God want to
[1:08:20] do a work. But you got to you got to
[1:08:23] wrestle. You got to wrestle for your
[1:08:25] name change. You got to wrestle for your
[1:08:28] position. And God want to give you
[1:08:30] power. God want to do things in your
[1:08:32] life. But you got to wrestle for it.
[1:08:34] Amen.
[1:08:36] You got to be willing to hold on to God
[1:08:38] do it for you. You can't do it for
[1:08:41] yourself. Let God do it for you. Okay.
[1:08:45] Proverbs 15 18 and 12.
[1:08:49] 15. Let's just go 15:33.
[1:08:52] Proverbs 15:33.
[1:08:54] Proverbs 15 and33.
[1:08:59] Go right ahead. And the fear of the Lord
[1:09:02] is the instruction of wisdom. And for
[1:09:04] and before honor is humility.
[1:09:08] Before honor is what? Humility. People
[1:09:11] want to get honor, but that where's your
[1:09:13] humility? Before honor is humility. We
[1:09:17] got to be, oh, I don't get enough honor.
[1:09:20] I don't get enough respect. Before honor
[1:09:23] is humility.
[1:09:26] People think I I I I deserve to have
[1:09:29] this. I deserve to be recognized. And I,
[1:09:32] you know, you can you can you can go
[1:09:34] away with people going to honor you. You
[1:09:37] know, if you got a lot of money, they
[1:09:40] honor you.
[1:09:42] If you got a lot of this or that, they
[1:09:44] they they
[1:09:46] want to honor you. But you ought to
[1:09:50] before honor is humility.
[1:09:53] I've seen people that had great status
[1:09:56] and physician and money, but they were
[1:09:58] real humble people. But that's very few,
[1:10:02] very few people can handle status. Very
[1:10:06] few people can handle money.
[1:10:09] and and it doesn't lift them up. Amen.
[1:10:13] Because he says having a form of
[1:10:14] godliness but denying the what? Power.
[1:10:17] Power. Amen. Sometime the power become
[1:10:19] the money. Sometime the power become
[1:10:22] your status, your social status. So we
[1:10:27] have to realize that we can have a form
[1:10:30] of godliness. We could be amen come
[1:10:32] before God with our sacrifices with
[1:10:35] 10,000 rams and I mean a thousand rams
[1:10:39] and 10,000 all but God required humility
[1:10:45] to walk in humility.
[1:10:47] Okay. Uh honor. Amen. I thank God people
[1:10:53] seeking honor of men but let God honor
[1:10:56] you with humility.
[1:10:59] 18 and 12. 18 and 12. Proverb 18:12.
[1:11:05] Thank the Lord. Amen.
[1:11:07] Proverbs 18. Before destruction, the
[1:11:10] heart of man is before honor is
[1:11:13] humility.
[1:11:15] Before honor is humility.
[1:11:18] before destruction. The heart of man is
[1:11:21] halty.
[1:11:23] You know, I sometimes I
[1:11:26] let's be Christians all the time. Let's
[1:11:30] not let harsh words come out of our
[1:11:33] mouth
[1:11:35] like we can take charge of our own
[1:11:37] selves and we're somebody special.
[1:11:41] Nobody going to mess over me. I got my
[1:11:43] 38 and my 45.
[1:11:46] Who cares about that? That's not
[1:11:49] Christian language,
[1:11:51] you know. Nobody got I mean it's be
[1:11:56] if you got it then, you know, don't
[1:11:59] trust in that.
[1:12:01] Trust in your humility.
[1:12:04] Trust in and the power of God. Are you
[1:12:08] with me? Amen. God wants to I mean
[1:12:14] having a form of godliness but not God
[1:12:17] wants complete control over your life.
[1:12:20] He He wants He wants He wants all of it.
[1:12:23] Let's go to Deuteronomy 8. Deuteronomy
[1:12:26] 8. But but God want all of you.
[1:12:30] Deuteronomy 8 and1. But and we got to
[1:12:32] see God wants the whole whole of you.
[1:12:35] Everything. He don't want just part of
[1:12:37] you. We want all. Amen. Are you with me?
[1:12:41] So sometimes we get out of character. We
[1:12:44] don't act like a Christian should act.
[1:12:46] And we'll become a go having a form of
[1:12:50] godliness. We can become uh the kind of
[1:12:53] Christians we think I'm all right with
[1:12:55] who I am. But that's not uh go. You
[1:12:58] might not be all right with God. You're
[1:13:00] all right with who you are. Amen. And
[1:13:03] you satisfied. And you've been satisfied
[1:13:05] a long time. But it's time for you to to
[1:13:07] get out of your comfort zone and stop
[1:13:10] being satisfied with being you. Amen.
[1:13:12] But you want to be Christ.
[1:13:15] Amen. Amen.
[1:13:17] Because sometime we get satisfied. You
[1:13:19] you say, "Oh, you turn around and say,
[1:13:21] you know, be who you are. No matter
[1:13:22] where you are." Now, come on, y'all. Are
[1:13:25] you with
[1:13:27] Because I'm saying something in one way
[1:13:30] and then I'm saying something in another
[1:13:32] way that you can understand what I'm
[1:13:33] saying hopefully. Amen. Let's be humble.
[1:13:39] Let's be humble.
[1:13:41] Amen. Whatever, whoever you are, be
[1:13:45] humble with it and be comfortable with
[1:13:47] whoever God made you. However God made
[1:13:50] you. That's what I'm saying on that end.
[1:13:52] But here I'm talking about where we have
[1:13:55] been formulated as having a form of
[1:13:58] godliness. Satisfied when I'm I'm a
[1:14:00] Christian of satisfied. I'm in the
[1:14:02] message satisfied this and that. But
[1:14:05] what is a real Christian if if it's not
[1:14:08] Christlike?
[1:14:10] Are you with me? What is a real message
[1:14:13] believer if it's not Christlike? Amen. I
[1:14:17] guess you might think it's being like
[1:14:18] brother Brian. I don't want to come on.
[1:14:23] Paul said, "Follow me as I follow what?"
[1:14:25] Christ. Cuz we're not trying to, you
[1:14:27] know, follow, you know, we trying to
[1:14:29] follow Christ. Amen. I thank God for I
[1:14:33] mean brother the pastor brother Simmons
[1:14:35] but I want you to be like Christ because
[1:14:38] I might have some insufficiencies in me.
[1:14:41] I might have some flaws but Jesus Christ
[1:14:44] don't have no what? No flaws. So why
[1:14:47] would I want to be like somebody that
[1:14:49] got flaws just like me? I want to be
[1:14:52] like the Bible say be perfect
[1:14:55] as your father in heaven is perfect.

[1:15:12] I make mistakes. But I want you to be
[1:15:15] like Christ. Amen. Are you with me? So
[1:15:19] walk with humility, humble.

[1:15:24] can be loose and forget who you are.
[1:15:27] Amen. Sometime we we all do that. We get
[1:15:30] loose sometime and we forget who we are.
[1:15:34] Look like we get a spirit of amnesia and
[1:15:37] we're back in the flesh.
[1:15:39] But he said walk in the what? Spirit and
[1:15:43] you will not fulfill the lust of the
[1:15:45] flesh.
[1:15:46] Amen. Amen. For any man be in Christ,
[1:15:50] he's a new creation.
[1:15:52] Are you with me? But sometimes we, you
[1:15:55] know, sometimes we we lose it. We all
[1:15:58] lose it sometime. But God is saying to
[1:16:01] us when you lose it, repent quickly.

[1:16:20] of I said some things. Oh Lord have
[1:16:23] mercy. I got to get the prayer. You know
[1:16:26] what I'm saying? Cuz sometime you
[1:16:28] examine yourself.
[1:16:33] I said, "Oh,
[1:16:35] shouldn't have said that."
[1:16:38] But sometime you can't correct it. But
[1:16:40] God understand and say, "God, I hope you
[1:16:43] got me today.
[1:16:45] Lord, I hope you took care of me today
[1:16:48] because I I did." And you know in in his
[1:16:51] flesh sometimes you you just somebody
[1:16:54] say you woke up on the wrong side of the
[1:16:56] bed or something but sometimes you just
[1:16:58] you know sometimes you just don't know
[1:17:01] what happened but God thank God for the
[1:17:04] Holy Ghost. Thank God for correction.
[1:17:06] Thank him for bringing you back to the
[1:17:09] place you need to be. Thank God for
[1:17:11] that. Amen. Because sometimes if he

[1:17:36] to do, that ye may live, and multiply,
[1:17:40] and go in and possess the land which the
[1:17:42] Lord swear unto your fathers. And thou
[1:17:45] shalt remember all the way which the
[1:17:48] Lord thy God led thee these 40 years in
[1:17:51] the wilderness to humble thee. See, God
[1:17:53] will lead you to what?

[1:17:58] wilderness. God led you as a church
[1:18:00] today to humble you, to bring you into
[1:18:03] the stature of a perfect man to humble
[1:18:05] you. God is doing these things in your
[1:18:08] life to bring you humility, to humble
[1:18:10] you. And then the homminist you'll
[1:18:13] recognize who is doing this for you.
[1:18:17] Okay. Go ahead.
[1:18:20] And to prove thee
[1:18:23] to know what was in thine heart whether
[1:18:26] thou wouldest keep his commandments or
[1:18:29] no. And he humbled thee and suffered
[1:18:32] thee to hunger and fed thee with mana
[1:18:35] which thou kneest not. Neither did thy
[1:18:38] fathers know that he might make thee
[1:18:41] know that man does not live by bread
[1:18:43] only, but by every word that proceeded
[1:18:46] out of the mouth of the Lord does man
[1:18:49] live. Thy reignment wax not old upon
[1:18:52] thee, neither did thy foot swell these
[1:18:55] 40 years. Thou shalt also consider in
[1:18:58] thine heart that as the man chastened
[1:19:01] his son, so the Lord thy God chastenth
[1:19:04] thee. You y'all understanding that
[1:19:08] God did these things to show you that
[1:19:10] man should not live by bread alone. I

[1:19:51] Therefore, thou shalt keep the
[1:19:53] commandments of the Lord thy God, to
[1:19:55] walk in his ways, and to fear him.
[1:20:00] For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into
[1:20:02] a good land, a land of brooks of water,
[1:20:05] of fountains and depths that spring out
[1:20:08] of the valleys and the hills, a land of
[1:20:10] wheat and barley and vines and fig trees
[1:20:13] and pomegranates. A land of olive oil
[1:20:16] and honey, a land wherein thou shalt eat
[1:20:19] bread without scarceness. Thou shalt not
[1:20:21] lack anything in it. A land whose stones
[1:20:24] is iron and out of whose hills thou made
[1:20:27] it mayest deal dig brass. When thou hast
[1:20:30] eaten and art full, then thou shalt
[1:20:33] bless the Lord thy God for the good land
[1:20:35] which he has given thee. And I'm telling
