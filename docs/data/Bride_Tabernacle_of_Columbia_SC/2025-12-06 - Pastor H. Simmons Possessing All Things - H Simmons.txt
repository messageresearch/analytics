Brother Nathan, brother and sister Paige and Diplace, Lord, continue to move in the life, Father. Father, we look to you now. We love you. We appreciate you. We thank you in Jesus Christ's wonderful name. Amen. God is good. Amen. &gt;&gt; The book of 2 Corinthians 6 and three. As you turn in there, I start reading. We then as workers together with him beseech you also that you receive not the grace of God in vain. For he said, I've heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I suckered thee. Behold, now is the accepted time. Behold, now is the day of salvation. Give no offense in anything that the ministry be not blamed, but in all things, approving ourselves as a what? &gt;&gt; Ministers of God. ministers of God in much patient in afflictions, in distress, and in I mean in necess necessities in distress. In what? &gt;&gt; And in prison and in what? &gt;&gt; And in labor and in what? &gt;&gt; And in fasting by puress and by what? knowledge &gt;&gt; by longsuffering and by what? &gt;&gt; By the Holy Ghost and by what? &gt;&gt; By the word of truth and by what? &gt;&gt; Power of God. by the arm of righteousness on the right hand and &gt;&gt; the left. &gt;&gt; By honor and &gt;&gt; dishonor &gt;&gt; by evil report and &gt;&gt; good report. As deceivers and yet &gt;&gt; true. &gt;&gt; As unknown yet. &gt;&gt; As dying and behold, we &gt;&gt; live. &gt;&gt; As chastened and &gt;&gt; not. &gt;&gt; As sorrowful yet, &gt;&gt; always rejoicing. &gt;&gt; As poor yet, &gt;&gt; making rich. &gt;&gt; As having nothing. &gt;&gt; God bless the word. You may be seated. Possessing all things tonight. Amen. Yet possessing all things and we I I was telling them down in Mullins on last night that we were just going to dwell with faith for a while and uh possessing all things. He says in the 10th verse, "And having what?" Nothing. And having nothing but yet what? &gt;&gt; Possessing all things. &gt;&gt; Possessing all things. You understand that you possess all things? &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't you say, "Well, I ain't got nothing as having nothing." But you got something. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you have something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say you have what? &gt;&gt; All things. &gt;&gt; Look at somebody. Tell them you got all. You have all things. &gt;&gt; You have all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have all things. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Don't feel sorry for yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes we go on pity trips and be feeling so bad. But you got to know who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You possess what? &gt;&gt; All things. &gt;&gt; All things. You possess all things. You possess all things. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's got to get over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And until this get over, then I might be here for the next 6 months. &gt;&gt; Possessing what? &gt;&gt; All things. &gt;&gt; You got to understand that you possess all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And then the book of Genesis 14, possessing all things. Having nothing but possessing all things. Isn't that good? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have nothing but yet you possess all things. &gt;&gt; As poor, but you're making many rich. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. The reason why people as Christians are so down because they uh they're not comfortable with who they are. They their identity they have an in identity crisis. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because they cannot identify with who God say I am. Amen. &gt;&gt; But as long as your mind cannot comprehend it, as long as your heart cannot believe it, then you will always feel like down. You feel like, Amen. you don't possess all things. Amen. But when you know that you know that you possess all things &gt;&gt; it causes you to walk with a different kind of attitude. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you know you possess all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when you don't know that then you somewhat uh you know that's why Christians are so unhappy. Amen. because they don't know and have not really realized what God is saying about you and to you. Until you believe it, you cannot act upon it. &gt;&gt; You cannot manifest if you don't believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Until you believe, then it comes forth a manifestation. &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] You can sit in these chairs and can don't and you you don't believe you can walk. You never move. &gt;&gt; People have to toach you out of here until you believe I can stand up and walk. But you you said, "I I I can walk. I ain't got to believe that." Yes, you do. If your mind tell you you can't walk, you sure won't walk. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; But it's something about subconsciously you just take for granted and believe that you can walk &gt;&gt; and you get up and walk. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; But we don't want it. We want faith to be so much and so that you can act upon it without even thinking about it. &gt;&gt; You can say it with your mouth. You can believe it in your heart. It becomes so common to you. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you don't walk by sight. You walk by what? &gt;&gt; Faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. And every time the negativeivity comes upon you, you can say, "Amen. Yes, I can do all things." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Through Christ that strengthened me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With Christ, all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, I I begin to move into another realm. I begin to be a a a new creature in Christ. This is a new creation. I I I'm of a new creation. I've been born again. I've come into a faith realm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and I'm walking in a faith civilization and I'm sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. I'm no more of this world. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. But that's the right mental attitude. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Let this mind be in you." That was what? And Christ says, "I come from God and I go to God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He told him, "No man take my life. I lay it down. I got the power to take it up again." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. When the devil attack you, you got to attack. Uh, Amen. Let him know who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's written. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Man should not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; Don't look at what he says. Don't look at your condition. Don't look at your symptoms, but you look at the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was telling Sister Paige, I said, "Look at the word." Amen. Don't look at symptoms. Don't look at what the doctor say. Don't look back at what you feel. You say what the word say. That's what you're looking at. &gt;&gt; You looking at the word &gt;&gt; and what the word said about it. That's what you believe. &gt;&gt; And I say you walk out of here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Looking at the word, &gt;&gt; not looking at what they say. Oh, I told brother Pa, I said, "Look at the word." &gt;&gt; You look at Jesus. Look to Jesus. &gt;&gt; And we got to start looking at Jesus. When you go, Amen. Don't look at the condition of a person. Look at what the word say about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not walking by sight. &gt;&gt; You're walking by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can look down. Oh, I feel sorry for them. You what? That's a child of God. You speak the word. &gt;&gt; You possess of all things. What? Why? Why cry? Speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. You need to be shrieking faith in your brother, speaking faith in your sister. Speak in the word. &gt;&gt; We're workers together with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to work. This ministry is not just a one-man ministry. It's not just the 54. We're all ambassadors in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are a part of the ministry. You're just as much a part as the pastor, the teacher, or the pastor, or the prophet. You just as much a part of God's ministry as they are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might not have the same office, but your ministry is the same. These signs shall what? &gt;&gt; Follow them. &gt;&gt; them that believe. &gt;&gt; Are you a believer? &gt;&gt; Then you look for things to happen &gt;&gt; because you believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; You look for things to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I said I was saying I I said I don't want people to stop this move of faith because I I realize people are so hindered and so down till they got to be built back up in faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was telling Mullins and Jeremiah and Connie and different ones know there was a spirit of faith that people used to come from everywhere for prayer. They didn't had to be a part of us. They come to the church to get healing. Are you with me? Because it was a faith realm. And people could see the pillar of fire and the supernatural. It needs to be recreated. &gt;&gt; Faith. We need to be built back up. &gt;&gt; Praise God. If it never was a time in your life that you seen God move, Amen. you need to look to God to move in your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to know that God Amen. [laughter] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The power of God is here for to be activated. And you, Amen, want to be a part of this. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Just as much as you want to be a part of the rapture and you say you are in the rapture and you're a part of it, you are the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Then you got to have rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. As I said the other day, Amen. Enoch kept walking and he pleased God. He walked by faith &gt;&gt; till he walked out of here. &gt;&gt; You got to walk by faith. &gt;&gt; Walk out of here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Walk in the power of the Holy Ghost. Let Jesus have the preeminence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Um, Genesis 14. I got to be real short. We got communion tonight. So, God is good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God is good. uh 18th verse Genesis 14:18 it says and Melzdc king of Salem bought for bread and what &gt;&gt; so many people say bought forth bread and grape grape grape juice bread and grape juice &gt;&gt; was that what y'all read huh see people scared to do what the Bible say they scared that if they take communion they become an alcoholic. This ain't no alcohol. This is the blood. Take it. Praise God. This represent the blood. Praise God. Are you with me? Well, you take it as alcohol. Yeah. You get drunk. [snorts] Are you with me? Will you take it as This is the blood. This is his blood. Are you with me? This represent the blood of Jesus Christ to take away our sins. And we're looking to see God forgive us of all our sins. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And if we're sick, we know that the blood of Jesus Christ when it's applied to the toe pole and to the lint and the blood of a animal, the lamb, Amen. Praise God. The shoes didn't wear out. Amen. Their clothes didn't wear out and they were healed. They didn't get sick. &gt;&gt; And we take communion. Amen. Understanding that this is the blood that for of Jesus. This represent his blood. And God said, "You do this in remembrance of me." &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And it's for my forgiveness of my sin. &gt;&gt; That's what the blood did. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come with the attitude. I I I can't do that because it's come on. You got all kind of excuses why we don't do what the scripture say and we scared of it. &gt;&gt; So everybody just get the little round wafer. You know the little sun god. That's what the round wafer represent. The Catholic church sun god. Are you with me? And they they do that for communion. Are you with me? But he said, "This is my body which is broken for you." &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Unleavened bread. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Not the son of God. Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; See the Catholic church, they take the son God and they say they got the power to make [clears throat] this round wafer. They got the power when the priest spray it becomes the litter body of Jesus Christ and you eating his literally body. And that's why the Protestant broke away. He said this is represents his body but this is not his it represents but it's not the lit body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And they don't have the priests got the power to do that. Praise God. So by the grace of God and it caused the reformation. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So some of y'all might not understand what I'm saying but some of y'all know what I'm talking about. the litter. So, it represents the body and it represents the blood. Okay, y'all. All right, &gt;&gt; I got off my subject of faith. [laughter] But it must be something needed to be said here because people want to walk in darkness. Be it's no use in walking in darkness when the light has come. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? And we know most of the people, most of the world do it wrong. They do everything else wrong. They baptized wrong and they do all all kind of things wrong. So when they take communion, you need to be dedicated to the Lord. You need to say, "Well, I want to live for him." So I'm taking communion identifying with that I am a Christian and I'm I've dedicated my life to him. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Some say I can't take it cuz I ain't perfect yet. You perfect in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and the blood cover you. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you you say, "Well, I am a believer and I'm one that's, you know, I'm one of those crucified one. I'm dying daily." &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You ought to live a crucified life. &gt;&gt; And that that's that ought to be your heart &gt;&gt; where your heart is. You you you say, "Well, you know, I I really want to be honest. I really want to be straight. I'm not just going to take communion and I I don't want to live right and I ain't ready to do right. But I'm willing in my heart I want to do everything to please the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's my heart. &gt;&gt; Praise God. When I fall short, I confess my sins knowing that he's faithful and just to forgive me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But in my heart, I want to do the right thing. &gt;&gt; And praise God. And I I'm striving. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; But here go people taking come in don't know what they taking for just a ritual. &gt;&gt; They just come to children everybody you know the baptized or ain't baptized and ain't living right and they don't care. Just take it. You know what I'm saying? It becomes a ritual. Just something you do every first Sunday. Amen. &gt;&gt; But it ought not be a ritual.

God, I believe you'll save me after a while. &gt;&gt; No, he died 2,000 years ago. He He already died for your sin. &gt;&gt; You've been forgiven already. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. [laughter] That's That happened 2,000 years ago. And you still struggling. Anybody here want to be saved? Yeah, me. That's your mindset. You get saved every service. Why? Cuz the devil talk you out of it soon you leave. So, you got to get saved again. Anybody want to be saved? I want to be saved. Anybody want Anybody want to be healed? I want to be healed every service. You want to be saved every service? God, I want to I want this I want this monkey off my back. I I want this thing. I want to get over this thing. I want to get over it. I want to get over it. We rebuke it and say, "Devil, leave them." By the time you walk back to the seat, the devil say, "I ain't going nowhere." He said, "Yeah." He said, "You feel it? Do you feel anything?" He said, "I ain't felt a thing." You ain't felt nothing. I felt something when I was up there, but I He said, "You you feel it now?" He said, "No, I don't feel it now." See, the Bible didn't say walk by feeling, did it? &gt;&gt; She said, "Walk by what?" &gt;&gt; So, what the devil talk you in, you don't feel no better, do you? See, the devil just took you back. You done backslid that fast. Come up here and you know something lifted up off you and you felt like Amen. something moved. Sat in the service and all of a sudden the spirit just swept over you. Amen. Amen. You forgot about your burdens. You forgot about Amen. the things that were troubling you. All of a sudden you're saying, "Thank you, Lord." &gt;&gt; And the devil said, Mm- You ain't getting off that easy. You're not getting out of here that easy. Amen. Ain't nothing changed. You still the same. And then you accept him and you believe what he says. See, you can't even believe what you hear in your head that's negative. Because that's not you. And that's the devil speaking to you. You got to be able to distinguish when God is speaking. And when the devil is speaking, when you know God is speaking, he's speaking positive. He's speaking the word. Amen. He's building your faith. Uh it's telling you you can Amen. And you will &gt;&gt; praise God. &gt;&gt; Receive what God says is yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you doubt. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't I'm I said I'm I'm going be here for a while. Praise God. I don't know how to I don't know how to stop, but I know that the church need to be built in faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Faith workketh by love. &gt;&gt; Let me Can I read one more verse? Are y'all ready to go? Y'all got to go home and get some rest. Ephesians 4, a little bit different than the Mullins, but I think I talked about this. 4 and 32. I just skip over the rest so you can read the whole fourth chapter if you want to. It says, "And be ye what? &gt;&gt; Kind to one another." &gt;&gt; Kind one to another. I'm going tell you, I've seen a lot of Christians, a lot of people say, I believe the message. I'm Christian. I'm saved. [snorts] But they kind to some people, but they ain't kind to everybody. Some people can be mean, can't they? &gt;&gt; You think Jesus could switch on people and do that all kind? But he said, "Be you kind one to another." Can you be kind? Not only he wants you to be kind, but he wants you to be what? You know sometimes the men has to be showing they mity or whatever I put the word there. They got to be so macho but be kind one to another and be what? &gt;&gt; It's that's why you know see sisters can be closer and they more tender hearted. Men got to be I'm standing up to show you to prove that I'm a man. I'm the man of the house. I'm the man of the church. And here the preacher ought to be a man and ought to throw you kick them out and ought to tell them, "Oh Lord, I'm a man." Oh, they want a man. [snorts] Tell everybody they're going to hell if they don't do what I say. Oh no, please. They That's not being the man. Jesus Christ said, "And be you kind one to another." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Marriages don't work out. Relationships don't work because we forget to be what? &gt;&gt; Kind one to another. And be what? &gt;&gt; Tenderarted. &gt;&gt; Tenderhearted. Now, this is marriage counseling. Be tenderhearted. Amen. You can hear some positive, some mighty or psychology and dogmatic, but who's telling you to be kind and be tenderhearted one to another? Are you with me? Be sweet, be loving, be gentle. Are you with me, honey? I really appreciate this meal. It's nice. Amen. And thank you for doing it. Be nice. Be kind. Be tenderhearted. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Really love you. I want you to know that. I want you to know I love you and I appreciate you. Are you with me, &gt;&gt; mama? I love you. Appreciate you, daddy. I love you. appreciate you. Sometimes we forget to tell that you we appreciate everything you do. I appreciate your labor. I like to tell y'all I appreciate y'all labor love this year. You know your faithfulness. Amen. Appreciate it. Amen. I got to get off of this verse. Forgiven what? Your healing and your victory is in your forgiveness. &gt;&gt; If you can't forgive, you can't get healed. &gt;&gt; And you wonder why you struggle with things. You got to be able to forgive. &gt;&gt; I find out I, you know, I walked in the room. I I tell y'all that all the time. But I tell you, uh prayed for us. I was preaching on forgiveness down in Florida and big church. People had about 300 people. Lady had she was suffering migraines, headaches for years. And it was just nothing she could do to get rid of them. And I preached on forgiveness. Had to to do with your healing. She saw me at the camp meeting years later and she says, "I was one of the ones that's sitting in the audience when you preached that forgiveness. I forgave and I was healed that night." Next door naval, she was in intensive care and everybody almost gave up. I told her got there she had some tra I mean thing in her mouth and all and I told her if that's something that you hold in your heart and you hadn't forgiven somebody and the tears start rolling out her eyes. I said forgive now if you want to be healed forgive. And those tears rolled. A couple days later, she was out the hospital, not out intensive care. She was at the hospital because she forgave. I've had people that wanted to have a child or wanted this, that, and they had to forgive before they can have a child. Things that block you, stop you from having a victorious life, and that's unforgiveness. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so you know a lot of people um so a half of the times and about 75% of the time people haven't told the person that they have injured them in some way. They they never went to the brother or sister and and signify it. It it affects them more than it affects the other people. People leave the church, they get offended by me, but they'll leave the church and you could ask them, "Did you do anything? Did I do anything to you?" They said, "No, you ain't done a thing." But they leave and they are offended. They see you said something or you did this. You know, I wouldn't know you when you said if I did something, I want I want you to forgive me. I I I want to get it right and I want you to leave right. People walk, they won't get it right. They'll leave wrong and won't get it right. Do you know what happens when they get to the next destination? They're going to do the same thing because that spirit, the unforgiveness of whatever it was, you keep moving under the same anointing. But forgiveness is the secret. We take this communion tonight. We can't hold grudges something in our heart against anybody. The reason why we ought to forgive one another even as God for what &gt;&gt; has forgiven us. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; We weren't so good either. So why should we hold a grudge on somebody else? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. If Christ could forgive us, we ought to be able to what? &gt;&gt; Forgive one another. Will you do that? And watch the church grow. And you said, "Well, uh, the you want all the seats to be filled." I would like that, but I want you to grow in love. Praise God. That means more than every seat being filled. When the love of God is just, you know, filled in every heart and there's no grudges, there's no bitterness. There's no indifference, but everybody just love one another. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you have a church like that, it's a beautiful group of people. Amen. The devil can't get in in there. Amen. Because it's just full of love. Amen. Somebody do something wrong or say something wrong, you forgive them. Oh, they ain't mean that. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; But if you can hold hold on to it and say it mean that I don't. Uh-uh. Don't do that. Forgive. And if you done something and you know you done something to offend somebody, just ask them, "Please forgive me." Are you Is that hard to ask them, "Please forgive me. I didn't mean to do it. Even though they might think you meant to do it, you tell them, I did not mean to do it. If it it offend you, I didn't mean to hurt you. So many people I've told, I didn't mean to hurt you. I I ask you to forgive me. You know what I'm saying? Sometimes things come across the pull pit, it's not intended to hurt, but by the time it get to you, the devil can twist it. twist it that way, twist it this way. And then you think, you know, I did he said that he talking about me, you know, but it it wasn't intended to be that way. You see what I'm saying? And sometimes you can misunderstand one another. And when you're misunderstanding one another, then talk it over. Please. Please. The hour was late. Time is winding up. And you can easily misunderstand one another. Okay? Be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted. Amen. Even as [snorts] God for Christ's sake forgave us. Amen. God bless you tonight. I hope something is said. Hallelujah. I don't know something is missing. As our heads are bow, hearts are looking to him. Is brother Ernest get us ready for communion. [snorts] Father in Jesus name known or unknown sins that I've said or done or thought Lord I don't want to take communion unworthy it's a known or unknown sin that I've committed Lord I want to say, "Lord, forgive me tonight." How about you, brother, sister? Lord, I I need your forgiveness. If I said, thought somehow I've hindered somebody's walk, Father, I ask you to forgive me for Lord, you know my intention. You know my heart. didn't mean it, didn't intend to do it. So Lord, I ask you be merciful to us tonight. As we live and as we walk this walk, it's by your grace, Lord. And I thank you for your grace tonight. And may we all, oh God, as we partake of communion tonight, knowing, oh God, that we're walking by faith, trusting you, Lord. Let this night, oh God, be a night that, oh God, our sins have blotted out, a sanctifying night that you cleans us from all unrighteousness. And Lord, that you would take control of our lives. We give it to you now in Jesus name. Amen. Hallelujah. Ernest, we're going to pray over communion. Hallelujah. Let us stand. Uh Lord, we thank you for the this bread that represents your body.

God, may each heart &gt;&gt; know that with your stripes we were healed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This wine that represents your blood which was shed for the forgiveness of our sin. &gt;&gt; Lord, help us, oh God, as we partake of it. &gt;&gt; To know that our sins have been forgiven by the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So we, oh God, come in fellowship with you. When we we take partake of it, Lord, it's saying that we united as MZDC. Amen. And Abram, Amen. took wine and bread and blessed it, Lord. We bless this wine and this bread, Lord. And Lord, we partake of it. Amen. Oh God, you did it with your disciples before you left. Oh God, you took bread and you took wine and you commune with them. May you commune with us tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh God, fellowship knowing that the victory has been won on Calvar's cross. The blood of Jesus reshambaling in the body. &gt;&gt; Oh God, may restoration Lord take place. &gt;&gt; Oh God, may in the power of the Holy Ghost come forth. Oh God, as we protect Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord, let your spirit energize us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because we are obeying your word &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music]
