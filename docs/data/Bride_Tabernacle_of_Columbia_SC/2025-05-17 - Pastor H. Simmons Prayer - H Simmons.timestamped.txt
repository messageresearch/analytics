[16:56] Sometimes we think we're right. We think

[32:25] your way out this afternoon in Jesus
[32:27] Christ's name. We would uh I guess we'll
[32:31] start a little early this year, but
[32:33] we're just starting just for
[32:35] preliminary. We want to start fasting
[32:38] and praying next week.
[32:41] Um that God would just, you know,

[32:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost, please by all
[32:56] means, you know, let's just fast and
[32:59] pray that God would fill you with the
[33:01] Holy Ghost. And and if you want to walk
[33:04] with God, let's just fast and pray that
[33:06] God would save, heal, and just draw us
[33:09] closer to him. We need the Lord. So
[33:13] fasting and praying start next week.
[33:16] Let's just pray and seek God face. Amen.
[33:21] We appreciate you that are able to do
[33:23] it. Amen. You that are willing to do it.
[33:26] And let's just pray. It's got so many
[33:29] prayer requests that we want to pray for
[33:31] those prayer requests. But let's also
[33:33] pray for just a move of God in each and
[33:36] every one of our lives. Just a closer
[33:39] walk with him in Jesus Christ's
[33:42] name. Okay, let us just stand tonight.
[33:46] want to talk to you because it's
[33:49] important to have a church that prays.
[33:52] Amen.
[33:54] They say that a family that prays
[33:56] together stays
[34:00] together. 7 and uh
[34:04] 14. 2 Chronicles 7 and
[34:08] 14. Praise God. God is good. Amen.
[34:11] Appreciate the songs again. Appreciate
[34:14] everyone tonight. special
[34:17] way. It says, "If my people which are
[34:21] called by my
[34:24] name, I trust that it'll be
[34:27] you trust that is me, my people, God's
[34:32] people that are called by his name."
[34:36] Amen. Shall what?
[34:40] Humble themselves. It's
[34:43] very important to humble oneself. Will
[34:47] humble themselves and pray and what?
[34:50] And seek my face and turn from their
[34:53] what?
[34:55] Then will I what? Hear from heaven. I
[34:58] will hear from heaven and I will what? I
[35:01] will forgive their sins and I will what?
[35:04] Heal the land. Amen. God bless you.
[35:07] Word. You may be seated.
[35:14] The Bible says in the 12th verse, "And
[35:17] the Lord appeared to Solomon it by night
[35:20] and said unto him, I've heard thy
[35:23] prayer and I have
[35:27] chosen this
[35:29] place to
[35:31] myself for an house of sacrifice." You
[35:35] remember Jesus whipped them out of the
[35:36] temple. And he said, "My house shall be
[35:38] called the house of
[35:39] prayer." Now, that was a a physical
[35:42] house, but in a natural temple that
[35:46] Solomon had
[35:47] built, and that was a physical temple
[35:50] that they went in, too. The Bible tells
[35:53] us we ought to pray without ceasing. And
[35:56] that we ought to pray always.
[35:59] But we find
[36:00] that prayer has become a a thing of the
[36:05] past. people never really pressed their
[36:09] way in. I remember so we wanted to, you
[36:12] know, because of situations and
[36:15] condition a lot of times we uh I I I
[36:19] know in time past we'll call prayer week
[36:21] and people could come and and we'll
[36:24] teach a little bit on prayer and we get
[36:25] to praying. So by the grace of God, we
[36:28] want to you as families to get together
[36:33] and pray.
[36:36] And you choose an hour of prayer. Each
[36:39] individual choose an hour of prayer and
[36:43] pray. You choose your hour of prayer.
[36:45] And sometimes you know something might
[36:47] happen. But you know if something
[36:50] happened and you got emergency or
[36:52] something get in your way just say Lord
[36:55] I'm still going to pray my
[36:57] hour. Uh, and let's just pray and fast.
[37:01] And something happened to your body and
[37:03] something happened during the day and
[37:05] you get a little weak, but just get a
[37:08] little strength, but keep fasting. Keep
[37:10] praying. Keep seeking God. Amen. Amen.
[37:14] and you're on those jobs where you're
[37:16] out there in the sun, brother Josh, and
[37:18] all and you might need some uh water and
[37:22] and stuff like that and maybe something
[37:25] to keep yourself hydrated, but just go
[37:28] on keep fasting and keep
[37:31] praying. Praying that yolks might be
[37:33] broken, strongholds might be pulled
[37:36] down, cuz prayer changes things. Amen.
[37:39] Prayer cause things to happen. Amen. So,
[37:42] we want things to happen next week in
[37:46] your lives, in your homes, in your
[37:47] families. We want things to happen that
[37:50] you would recognize that God heard your
[37:53] prayer. Amen. Amen. Okay. So, by the
[37:56] grace of God, we want Amen to dedicate
[37:59] ourselves to prayer.
[38:02] Let us not just get caught up with
[38:04] things that's going to uh uh cause us
[38:07] not to be consecrated and and and not to
[38:10] be uh watchful and
[38:13] mindful because if we pray, we got to
[38:15] watch as well as pray. We can't be
[38:19] loose. Are you with me? You got to be
[38:23] consecrated.
[38:25] [Music]
[38:26] He
[38:29] says he said his
[38:32] house my
[38:35] house God
[38:38] sanctifi the the
[38:41] sacrifices are made in the house of God.
[38:43] God provided place for
[38:46] worship. If I shut up the
[38:50] heavens that there be no rain. if I
[38:55] command the locals to devour the land or
[38:58] if I send peasants among my
[39:01] people. Then he went on to say, if my
[39:04] people which are called by my name will
[39:06] humble themselves and pray and seek my
[39:09] face and turn from their wicked
[39:11] ways. Sometimes if we don't turn from
[39:16] wickedness, the Bible say if we confess
[39:18] our sins, he's faithful and just to
[39:21] forgive us of our sin.
[39:23] If we're not willing to repent, what
[39:25] good is us going to pray? What what good
[39:28] is prayer if we won't repent and we
[39:31] won't turn from our wicked ways?
[39:34] Some people will tell you they drink,
[39:36] they lie, cheat, do all kind of
[39:38] wickedness, but it's I pray every
[39:41] night, you know, and I like to use the
[39:44] scripture, God is not a sinner, but if
[39:47] any man be a worshiper of him, he would
[39:50] hear
[39:51] him. you know, and let us just look at
[39:54] Isaiah
[39:56] uh 59, excuse
[40:00] me. It's very important that you pray
[40:04] with the right kind of
[40:06] attitude and the right kind of
[40:09] spirit because a lot of times people
[40:11] praying and they think God has to hear
[40:14] them. They living in sin and they doing
[40:17] all kind of sinful stuff and they trying
[40:19] to pray to
[40:21] God. He said we got to turn from our
[40:24] wicked ways. Amen.
[40:26] We can't just keep on doing wicked stuff
[40:29] and expecting God to move on our behalf.
[40:33] You got to turn.
[40:37] He said,
[40:38] "Behold," Isaiah
[40:41] 59, he said, "Behold, the Lord hand is
[40:44] not what?"
[40:46] shortened that he cannot what?
[40:50] Save. Some people want to be
[40:53] saved. Uh, I want to be saved, Lord, but
[40:57] it it takes a turning from your wicked
[41:01] ways. See, this is You want a Bible
[41:04] salvation.
[41:06] You want a word
[41:08] salvation. You don't want to, you know,
[41:11] somebody to tell you a a church
[41:13] salvation or or or somebody some man.
[41:18] But we we want a Bible
[41:21] salvation. And that's only one savior
[41:24] and that's Jesus Christ.
[41:26] Without
[41:29] him, God got
[41:31] away. And Jesus said, "I am the way, the
[41:34] truth, and the life. You can't come up
[41:36] any other way. Somebody can shake your
[41:39] hand and tell you you're all right. And
[41:42] you might feel all right because they
[41:44] told you you all
[41:46] right. But we got to
[41:53] turn that he cannot save neither his ear
[41:56] heavy that he cannot what hear but your
[42:00] what? Your
[42:02] iniquities. Isaiah 59 and2 but your
[42:07] iniquities have what? Separated
[42:11] separated between you and what
[42:15] sin causes you to be separated from God.
[42:20] Amen. Sin cause you to be separated. And
[42:23] for when you're separated from God,
[42:25] that's
[42:26] death. You can't live.
[42:30] Amen. Sin cause separation.
[42:33] It don't matter how much you shout, how
[42:35] much you sing, how much you preach. But
[42:37] if you if you have iniquity, you
[42:40] sinning, it cause
[42:43] separation. So So Solomon said to my
[42:45] people, they must call my name with
[42:47] humble themselves and pray. Amen. Seek
[42:51] my face and turn. Amen. You got to turn.
[42:54] Amen. From your wicked ways. You got to
[42:57] turn. Yeah. If you won't turn, what good
[43:00] is prayer if you're not going to turn?
[43:03] Amen. You got to pray, "God, forgive me.
[43:06] Help me. Give me strength to turn."
[43:08] Amen. Give me strength to live what you
[43:11] Amen. this life. That's a a Christian
[43:14] life. Amen. God, give me the strength.
[43:18] Give me Amen. power over these uh
[43:21] things. I'm willing to Amen. I'm willing
[43:23] to forsake. Amen. I'm willing to forsake
[43:26] these things that are not right. Amen.
[43:29] Praise God. And I want God, Lord, I'm
[43:32] willing to forsake it in the name of
[43:34] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. You got to
[43:37] forsake the sin. You got to stop
[43:40] sinning. You can't keep on sinning and
[43:43] praying and and asking God, God have
[43:45] mercy. God is a merciful God. Amen.
[43:49] [Music]
[43:52] He
[43:55] said so much as so he says it separated
[43:58] you and your God and your sins have hid
[44:03] his face from you that he will what?
[44:08] Not hear you. You want God to hear
[44:12] you, then you got to stop. You got to
[44:15] stop doing the thing that you know
[44:18] iniquity. When you know to do right and
[44:21] you know it's wrong and you still do it.
[44:23] Oh,
[44:25] there too many people patting people on
[44:26] the back making them feel good. It's a
[44:29] disgrace to the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[44:31] Amen. Amen. It's almost like a uh it's
[44:35] no use in me preaching. Amen. For you to
[44:38] forsake sin and stop living unrighteous
[44:42] and you going to pat him on the back.
[44:44] Ah, come on. Come on. No, you No, no,
[44:46] no, no, no. It just it's just blaspheing
[44:49] almost. You pat somebody in the back and
[44:52] make them feel good and you know they
[44:54] sinning and you know they wrong and I'm
[44:57] you know it it makes the gospel make the
[45:00] the preaching of none effect. Why?
[45:04] Because you patting somebody on the back
[45:06] making them feel good and all they have
[45:09] to do is share some brownie tails and
[45:11] start crying and keep on being a sinner.
[45:17] Man,
[45:18] you you got to all that crying
[45:22] ain't doing no good. I remember one
[45:24] brother, you know, he was doing stuff.
[45:26] He had no business and and man, I was
[45:29] praying. That was probably about uh 40
[45:33] years ago, 35 maybe 35 years ago or so.
[45:37] I was fasting with that brother and
[45:39] praying with him. We stayed all night.
[45:41] We was I was struggling. And
[45:45] then something the Lord just showed me.
[45:48] You doing all this fasting and praying
[45:50] and this fell
[45:51] sinning. I said, "What? What good is it
[45:55] going to do
[45:56] here? He want you to uh have sympathy
[45:59] and pity." And some of y'all just pity
[46:02] people. You pity him instead of trying
[46:04] to tell them get right with God. The
[46:06] reason why things happening in your life
[46:09] and things that ain't right in your life
[46:11] because you're
[46:13] sinning. I can't I don't know why I all
[46:17] that sympathy. Yeah. It's some people
[46:19] need a little sympathetic and that but
[46:22] but some people are just reaching out to
[46:25] you to give them sympathy and you got
[46:27] that sympathetic. Oh baby, it's going to
[46:29] be all right. Baby, baby, it is going to
[46:32] be all right. But if you want it to be
[46:34] all right, you got to stop sinning.
[46:37] You got to live right.
[46:40] You got to do right.
[46:43] Amen. Mama pray for you. Grandmama pray
[46:46] for you. Granddaddy pray for you. We'll
[46:48] pray for you. But it ain't going to do
[46:50] us no good. It going to hit the wall and
[46:52] bounce back because you don't want to
[46:54] stop doing. See, he said turn from your
[46:57] what? Wicked ways. Turn from your wicked
[47:00] ways. He said, "Your
[47:03] iniquities has separated you and God."
[47:05] And he said, "I ain't going to hear
[47:07] you."
[47:10] But you think, "Well, God, you know, all
[47:13] all I go through, all I've been through
[47:15] for me been
[47:17] wrong." Folks ain't done you wrong. The
[47:19] devil did you wrong. And the devil is
[47:22] your worst enemy. Amen.
[47:25] And the devil Amen. I said, "Well, they
[47:28] say, I thought I was my worst enemy."
[47:30] Amen. Because you and the devil come
[47:32] become
[47:34] one. All unrighteousness is what? Sin.
[47:38] And when you if you yield yourself to
[47:41] the devil, you and the devil become one.
[47:44] Sometimes say, "Well, I'm innocent."
[47:46] What? How innocent are we? You say, "I
[47:50] don't deserve to be treated like I've
[47:52] been treated. I don't deserve the things
[47:54] that are happening to me in my life."
[47:57] No, no. Sometimes that is true. But
[48:00] nevertheless, what you've been through
[48:02] and what you go through in life, we got
[48:05] a God that is able to Amen. Amen. A able
[48:09] to heal all your hurt, take away all
[48:11] your pain. All you got to do is trust in
[48:15] him and believe in him. And he'll
[48:17] restore you. He'll make you new again.
[48:20] Amen. He'll take away your sorrows, your
[48:23] pain of the past. Oh, God will do things
[48:27] for you. You serving a God that can
[48:29] Amen. heal every hurt. Amen. And every
[48:33] pain. Amen. And everything you been
[48:36] through. Amen. Amen. You might have been
[48:38] done wrong. Yeah. Yeah. But I can't pat
[48:40] you on the back and tell you it's all
[48:42] right to continue in the stand. Amen.
[48:45] And your lifestyle is all right.
[48:48] Because you've been done wrong.
[48:51] You know, I I I sympathize with you and
[48:54] I pity you sometime, but at the same
[48:57] time, I got to stand on the word. Amen.
[49:00] Amen. If the word said it, I got to say,
[49:02] the Lord, I'm trusting in you. Somebody
[49:04] got to suffer for his name. Amen. But I
[49:08] said, well, in the heaven will be worthy
[49:10] to you. Amen. All your all your
[49:14] suffering and all you been through, all
[49:16] of
[49:17] Amen. The folks have done you wrong.
[49:19] things have happened in the wrong way to
[49:22] Amen. to a person and amen you said I
[49:25] was just a child when I went through
[49:26] certain things and there certain pains
[49:29] and certain
[49:30] hurts but that's all right. Don't blame
[49:33] God for that. Blame the
[49:36] devil. And when you let the devil know
[49:39] that there's a God that cares more about
[49:41] me. You tried to destroy me. You tried
[49:44] to kill me. You tried to, you know, make
[49:48] me feel like I couldn't get out. Amen.
[49:52] Out of this situation of agony and pain.
[49:55] I was always feeling like I was
[49:57] worthless, that I'm no
[49:59] good. But God is able. Amen. Amen. I
[50:03] start Why am I living? Why Why am I
[50:07] here? You're here for a purpose. That's
[50:09] to serve the Lord. Amen. And God can
[50:12] make the desert like
[50:15] a a ocean or river. Amen. God can Amen.
[50:20] He can make Amen. those little stickers
[50:23] and cactus like a
[50:26] rose. Amen. Praise God. And God can make
[50:30] Amen. in the mud and he can be he can
[50:34] make you a lily in your valley.
[50:38] Amen.
[50:40] God can change things. And I'm saying,
[50:42] but you got to pray. You got to pray
[50:45] until you say,
[50:47] "God, you understand
[50:50] everything. God, I'm talking it over
[50:53] with you.
[50:54] Cuz I didn't know why you let it happen
[50:56] to me. I don't know why you let me hurt
[51:00] like I'm hurting. I don't let I don't
[51:03] know why I had to go through the things
[51:05] I went through." Yes. God, why you don't
[51:09] don't start telling why you let this
[51:13] happen? And somehow the word is said now
[51:18] we know that all
[51:21] things will work together
[51:24] for what?
[51:26] I don't know how it's going to work to
[51:27] my good Lord, but because you said it.
[51:31] Amen. Amen. Here's your child here,
[51:34] Lord. Amen. Lord, I don't know what's
[51:38] going on now, but here's your child. But
[51:41] you said it'll work. Amen. So, if it's
[51:45] going to work to my good, then let me
[51:47] get ready for my blessing. Amen. Amen.
[51:51] Amen. Let me prepare myself for my
[51:54] blessing. Let me make room for my
[51:56] blessing because I can't be blessed
[51:59] while I'm in this condition. Amen. Amen.
[52:04] Amen. I need to turn. I I can't be
[52:07] blessed until I turn from my wicked
[52:09] ways. Amen. Amen. Praise God. You want
[52:12] God's blessing before you turn.
[52:16] Amen. Praise God.
[52:18] You want God to to help you before you
[52:22] turn. Your help is in
[52:25] turning. Your help is in in not blaming
[52:29] God. Amen. But let the God know I I
[52:33] don't know why. Amen. I had to go
[52:37] through this.
[52:38] But if heaven is my home,
[52:42] then I I I
[52:44] I this is the
[52:46] way that I'm going to get to heaven,
[52:49] then God, I want to go to heaven
[52:51] regardless of what I've been through.
[52:53] Amen. The devil did everything he could
[52:57] do to that you wouldn't serve the Lord.
[52:59] Amen. That you gave up on God. Amen. And
[53:04] wonder why God that you love me, if you
[53:07] care about why. Amen. Why so much pain?
[53:11] Go ahead.
[53:15] But he knows. Amen. Amen. Amen. We can't
[53:20] understand the the wise right now, but
[53:24] we can't understand, Amen. the pain and
[53:27] the struggle right now. Amen. But this
[53:30] the songwriter said it right. We
[53:33] understand it by. Amen. When the morning
[53:36] come. Amen. Amen. We'll understand it
[53:39] better by
[53:45] I've been in some places
[53:47] where I didn't know how I got there. And
[53:50] sometimes we think we don't deserve to
[53:52] be there.
[53:54] We think what have we done to deserve
[53:58] certain places that we get into. I'm
[54:01] talking about
[54:03] prayer and you're talking to
[54:06] God not understanding the
[54:09] wise and you're trying to explain to
[54:12] God.
[54:14] Lord, if you're
[54:16] here, if you c if you here, if you're
[54:20] God and you see, Amen. my struggle and
[54:24] you see what I'm going
[54:26] through. Then Lord, I I know you you
[54:30] know sometime you get there and you say,
[54:32] "God, I I I I need you to come on the
[54:35] scene. I need you to come see about me."
[54:39] Amen. I need you, Lord. Amen. Come see
[54:43] about me, Lord.
[54:47] You know, somebody said, "He never
[54:49] failed me yet." Amen. It's not a song to
[54:52] me. It's a reality.
[54:55] It's not a song. It's a reality. Amen.
[54:58] And he will never fail you. Amen. Amen.
[55:01] He won't.
[55:03] Amen.
[55:06] For he says in the third verse, for your
[55:10] hands are defiled with blood, your
[55:14] fingers with
[55:15] iniquity, and your lips have spoken
[55:18] what? Li.
[55:20] lies and your tongue
[55:23] has muttered perverseness.
[55:28] Some of you curse and swear and do all
[55:30] kind of
[55:32] stuff. Mama don't know it and daddy
[55:35] don't know it. It's just it come a time
[55:38] you got to turn.
[55:40] You got to
[55:43] turn
[55:46] perverseness, all kind of
[55:49] wickedness. You got to
[55:51] turn. It's time to turn from your wicked
[55:54] ways. Humble yourself and pray.
[55:59] Pray with an honest and sincere heart.
[56:03] You got to be earnest and sincere when
[56:06] you pray. Amen. You got to want God.
[56:09] Amen.
[56:11] Want God to move in your life. Want God
[56:13] to hear your cry. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[56:19] If God does not help us now, I don't
[56:23] know where we going to be. Amen. 6
[56:26] months from now, God needs the the
[56:29] nation need help. The city need help.
[56:32] The schools need help. You Amen. We need
[56:34] help. Amen. Amen.
[56:41] We need
[56:44] God. Let's just go to Matthew
[56:47] 6. Prayer changes
[56:52] things. Don't stop
[56:55] praying. Don't give up on God. He won't
[56:58] give up on
[57:01] you. He won't give up on you.
[57:07] You know Jesus said to the woman
[57:09] senician woman, "It's not meat for me to
[57:11] give the children bread to the dogs."
[57:14] She said, "Yay, Lord, but the dogs
[57:16] desire the crumb that fall from the
[57:18] master's table." She would knew how to
[57:20] be humble enough to realize even though
[57:23] I don't deserve it, God, will you just
[57:26] have grace for my daughter needs these
[57:30] devils out of her? Are you with me?
[57:34] So God, I'm here. I know I don't deserve
[57:38] it.
[57:40] Amen. I know I'm not a Jew. Amen. But I
[57:44] I I'm one here just asking for some
[57:47] crumbs to fall from the master's table.
[57:49] Amen.
[57:52] Sometimes we count ourselves so unworthy
[57:54] of his grace, so unworthy of his
[57:59] mercy. But God, if you
[58:02] will, Amen. and I hadn't been so holy
[58:05] and so
[58:07] righteous that I deserve your
[58:13] blessings. But God, will you have mercy
[58:15] on
[58:16] me? And that's what we got to get in a
[58:20] broken and a contrite spirit. He will
[58:22] not
[58:25] deny. We got to be
[58:27] broken. If we want God to move on our
[58:30] behalf, let it sometimes our heart is so
[58:33] hard. It's no
[58:37] brokenness. Sometimes when it comes down
[58:39] to seeking God for the baptism of the
[58:41] Holy Ghost, we got to be
[58:45] broken. We got to, you know, I say, "How
[58:48] can I be broken?" It's when when I mean
[58:51] it in sincerity and truth and that I I I
[58:54] really want God to move in my life. I'm
[58:57] [Music]
[58:59] broken. Amen. God, I I really need
[59:05] it. But when it comes down to
[59:08] God, people have not sought God
[59:13] enough to mean business with God.
[59:18] Maybe I'll skip that. Let's just go to
[59:24] James.
[59:27] I like for all
[59:29] the all the children that know the other
[59:32] Father prayer out of Matthew
[59:35] 60 this week. Make sure you know it. God
[59:39] might call on any one of
[59:42] y'all. Our father. Our father, which art
[59:46] in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy
[59:49] king,
[59:50] thy will be done.
[59:56] Okay. Thank the Lord. You're halfway
[59:59] there already. I thought you was saying,
[1:00:02] "That's all right. That's all right. We
[1:00:04] halfway there." James 5. Excuse
[1:00:09] me. Ain't God good? Amen.
[1:00:12] James
[1:00:19] 5, he said, "That's why people pray and
[1:00:22] they don't get nothing. Your approach
[1:00:24] could be
[1:00:28] wrong." The Pharisees prayed. He said,
[1:00:30] "I'm so glad I'm not like the
[1:00:33] publicans." But the
[1:00:36] publicans, he he couldn't hardly he
[1:00:38] didn't even hardly lift up his hand. He
[1:00:40] said, "Lord, be merciful to me a
[1:00:43] sinner." He had the right kind of
[1:00:47] attitude. When you pray, you got to have
[1:00:49] the right kind of attitude.
[1:00:51] But sometimes people
[1:00:54] just what you say. God said, "What you
[1:00:59] say? What you
[1:01:01] say?" Got to go to
[1:01:04] sleep, Lord. In the
[1:01:07] morning, got to go to sleep. I got to go
[1:01:09] to
[1:01:11] school. But when you pray,
[1:01:13] pray, "Our
[1:01:16] Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be
[1:01:20] thy
[1:01:21] name." Okay? Take your time and give God
[1:01:26] a more time.
[1:01:31] God can use a little bit more of your
[1:01:33] time if you can spare some
[1:01:37] time to pray
[1:01:42] and not to
[1:01:44] play. Look at somebody say pray and
[1:01:47] don't play.
[1:01:55] Okay. We want to play more than we want
[1:01:58] to
[1:01:59] pray, but we got to get down to business
[1:02:02] because the time is at hand. Amen.
[1:02:06] Things that are taking place in the
[1:02:08] world
[1:02:09] today, it ought to bring us to our
[1:02:15] knees. The things that are moving so
[1:02:17] swiftly and so
[1:02:19] fast and yet we don't stop long enough.
[1:02:24] Say,
[1:02:25] "God, if we ever needed you, we need you
[1:02:29] now.
[1:02:31] There's so much uncertainty in the
[1:02:34] world. The world is so
[1:02:37] unstable. So, we don't we're living in
[1:02:40] an unstable country. We got people in
[1:02:44] charge and un that's tossing us in
[1:02:47] unstable
[1:02:49] conditions. We don't know what to
[1:02:51] expect.
[1:02:53] The weather is so
[1:02:57] unstable. We got floods, we got
[1:03:00] hurricanes, we got earthquakes, we got
[1:03:02] fires, we got everything going.
[1:03:05] Everything is
[1:03:06] just all out of
[1:03:10] whack. So as you fast and as you
[1:03:14] pray, sometimes you got to stand in the
[1:03:18] gap and make up the hedge. He said, "Put
[1:03:20] a mark upon them that side and cry
[1:03:23] because of the abomination that are done
[1:03:25] in the
[1:03:26] city." All these abominations that are
[1:03:30] done. Everywhere you look, you're
[1:03:32] looking at perver and filth and
[1:03:36] ungodliness. And people don't even know.
[1:03:39] They don't even have a mind. It just
[1:03:41] normal. It's just the norm. People
[1:03:47] curse and they oh swear and they oh the
[1:03:52] whole
[1:03:53] thing is just gone in the schools on the
[1:03:57] on the highway on everywhere you look is
[1:04:01] just
[1:04:03] darkness. Darkness. This is just
[1:04:06] darkness. But it's time that you pray
[1:04:09] because the conditions are not getting
[1:04:12] any better. is getting
[1:04:14] worse and because of
[1:04:17] the the the conditions that are getting
[1:04:20] worse and
[1:04:23] worse, but you keep
[1:04:26] praying. God can turn things
[1:04:29] around. Y'all ask for help. He said in
[1:04:33] the 13th verse for James 5 and
[1:04:37] 13, if any of among you what? afflicted.
[1:04:42] Afflicted, let him what? Pray. Pray.
[1:04:46] If any marry, let him what?
[1:04:50] If any sick among you, let him what?
[1:04:52] Call of the elders of the church. You
[1:04:54] know, often times, you know, I like to
[1:04:58] for those that are sick,
[1:05:02] call. You know, sometimes you know way
[1:05:06] down the road and they almost upset with
[1:05:09] you because you didn't
[1:05:11] call. Some people are sick physically
[1:05:13] and some people are spiritually
[1:05:17] sick. They they feel like the preacher,
[1:05:22] he don't care about me. That's a
[1:05:24] spiritually sick
[1:05:26] person. Oh, he don't care. Nobody love
[1:05:29] me. Nobody cares. Spiritually, mentally
[1:05:31] sick.
[1:05:36] You know the baby when they cry and they
[1:05:38] holler and scream. We understand you got
[1:05:42] babies. But you got people that ought to
[1:05:45] be mature
[1:05:49] Christians that ought to when they
[1:05:52] afflicted they just
[1:05:54] pray. But if they sick they need to call
[1:05:58] for the elder of the church. Are you
[1:06:00] with me?
[1:06:03] But people don't call as they need to
[1:06:06] but expect you to be
[1:06:09] there. They call for who never will let
[1:06:14] him
[1:06:15] come but they don't call for the elders
[1:06:17] of the church. It used to be a time when
[1:06:21] people would call for the elder of the
[1:06:23] church and they have their faith
[1:06:27] elevated and they ready for their
[1:06:29] healing.
[1:06:31] Are you with me? You know, every now and
[1:06:34] then you got somebody that would call
[1:06:36] for the elder of the
[1:06:38] church. You got every now and then you
[1:06:41] got somebody say, "I'm sick. Pray for
[1:06:44] me." It may be 2:00 in the morning,
[1:06:47] maybe
[1:06:48] 3:00, you say, "Pray for me. I'm
[1:06:52] sick." And we
[1:06:55] pray. Are you with me? Amen.
[1:06:58] And then sometimes he said, "Want me to
[1:07:01] come?" And we'll get up and we'll make
[1:07:04] our way. No matter where it is, we try
[1:07:07] to get there. Are you with
[1:07:10] me? Somebody by the grace of
[1:07:13] God. Don't forget to do what the
[1:07:15] scriptures say. And when we get there,
[1:07:18] God will do what he say he'll do.
[1:07:22] That's because you obeying what? The
[1:07:24] word. Amen. Amen. Just obey the word and
[1:07:29] have confidence that God, your word said
[1:07:32] it and I'm going to obey you and what
[1:07:34] you say. Amen. Amen. Yes. Amen. Ain't
[1:07:38] that right? Amen. When you do what the
[1:07:41] word say, then it's it's that if this is
[1:07:43] God's word, then God is able to perform
[1:07:46] what he's saying. Amen. His word will
[1:07:49] not go out of void. Amen. But it shall
[1:07:53] accomplish that which you send it. Amen.
[1:07:56] Are you with me? Amen. So praying means
[1:08:00] something. Amen.
[1:08:04] Okay. Call for the elders of the church
[1:08:07] and let them what? Pray over him. Right.
[1:08:13] Let them pray over
[1:08:15] him, anointing him with oil in the name
[1:08:18] of the Lord. For the prayer of what?
[1:08:23] Prayer of
[1:08:24] faith shall save the sick. The prayer of
[1:08:28] faith will deliver the sick. It'll save
[1:08:30] the sick. And the Lord shall what? Raise
[1:08:33] them up. Raise him up. And if he hath
[1:08:36] committed sins, they shall be what?
[1:08:40] Now then he says in the 16th verse
[1:08:44] confess your what?
[1:08:47] You know a lot of times we
[1:08:50] pray for sick and uh and sometimes it
[1:08:54] look like you know God put it on my
[1:08:58] heart. You need everything clear. If a
[1:09:02] person is not being healed then we want
[1:09:04] to know what the problem is. And
[1:09:07] sometimes I pray and God what is the
[1:09:11] problem? And then sometime God will
[1:09:13] reveal to me what it
[1:09:15] is. Sometimes I can't tell folk what it
[1:09:19] is because they ought to know what it is
[1:09:23] but I just keep on
[1:09:25] praying but the Lord is
[1:09:28] not. Keep on praying. He hear your cry.
[1:09:31] Sometime God has to reveal to that
[1:09:33] person what they need to straighten out
[1:09:37] for them to be
[1:09:40] healed. You know I I was praying for
[1:09:42] somebody somebody you know for look like
[1:09:45] it's been a year or so. So if we pray
[1:09:48] call for the elders of the church let
[1:09:50] them anoint them with all pray the
[1:09:51] prayer of faith the prayer of faith you
[1:09:53] say sick and the Lord what raise them
[1:09:57] up. Are you with me? Yes. But you got to
[1:10:01] check and examine yourself when you're
[1:10:03] praying. You got to uh make sure you
[1:10:10] forgive a member of sister on her
[1:10:14] deathbed and they called for me and no
[1:10:16] she wasn't a sister. She wasn't even
[1:10:19] could consider herself
[1:10:21] saved. But the parents home asked me to
[1:10:25] go to the hospital and go in intensive
[1:10:27] care to pray for her. And I went there
[1:10:29] to
[1:10:31] pray. And as I got in the room, she had
[1:10:34] the tubes all in her and everything.
[1:10:38] And but she could hear me. I could tell
[1:10:40] she could hear me. She blinked the eyes.
[1:10:43] And I says to her,
[1:10:47] "Sister, if you holding anything in your
[1:10:50] heart against somebody, I want you to
[1:10:52] forgive him and let it go and God will
[1:10:55] heal
[1:10:56] you." In a couple of days, she was out
[1:10:59] in the hospital, out of intensive care
[1:11:01] and out the hospital, looking good,
[1:11:04] too.
[1:11:07] See, when you pray, you got to forgive.
[1:11:12] If you gonna fast and pray this week, I
[1:11:15] mean this week coming up,
[1:11:20] forgive. You know, some people say, "I
[1:11:22] forgive them." But you still don't want
[1:11:25] to see them. I don't want to see them. I
[1:11:27] want them around me. I don't want to
[1:11:30] hear them. I forgive them. But I I see
[1:11:34] there ain't no
[1:11:36] forgiveness. Are you with me? What if
[1:11:39] God uh say, "I forgive you, but I'mma
[1:11:42] still hold it against
[1:11:44] you. Oh, I I ain't going to bless you. I
[1:11:48] I forgive you, but you ain't going to
[1:11:50] get no more
[1:11:51] blessings." God forgives us. He shows us
[1:11:55] that I love you and I forgive you. He
[1:11:58] said,
[1:12:00] "Now, and and that's what happens often
[1:12:04] times. Folks hold on. They hold on to
[1:12:08] situations and they hold on to
[1:12:10] conditions. You know, I I I I I was
[1:12:14] appreciating this morning and as I was
[1:12:17] dealing with, you know, the songs and he
[1:12:20] says, "So far will I remove your
[1:12:23] iniquities as the east is from the
[1:12:26] west." You know what I'm saying? And
[1:12:28] then God, he removes them so far. He
[1:12:33] said, "Then he says, "Your sins and
[1:12:36] iniquities will I remember no
[1:12:40] more." God is able to heal and forgive
[1:12:45] and remove your sins. And I ain't going
[1:12:48] to remember them no more. I ain't going
[1:12:50] to hold it against you. But you got to
[1:12:53] realize when you
[1:12:55] pray, Amen. when you talk it over with
[1:12:58] God, God said, "I ain't going to
[1:13:00] remember it no more. I ain't going to
[1:13:01] bring it up to you no more. Amen. But
[1:13:05] see, when you forgive somebody and you
[1:13:07] keep bringing the same thing up over and
[1:13:10] over and over and telling your neighbor,
[1:13:12] your next door neighbor, down the street
[1:13:14] about it, everybody you think about it.
[1:13:19] Well, you remember you remember when
[1:13:26] forgiveness prophet God said we're not
[1:13:28] able to
[1:13:30] forget. God can
[1:13:33] forget but the devil make sure you
[1:13:37] remember but God he's able to not to
[1:13:41] remember it no
[1:13:44] more. and he had throw it in the sea of
[1:13:47] forgiveness and he won't bring it up
[1:13:50] again. Are you with me? Amen.
[1:13:55] But when you when you pray, don't hold
[1:13:58] on. Don't hold on
[1:14:01] to the
[1:14:03] past. Pray to God,
[1:14:06] God, I
[1:14:09] forgive. And then that your healing
[1:14:12] begin. Your healing begin when you
[1:14:16] forgive. You'll never be
[1:14:19] healed until you
[1:14:21] forgive. Once you
[1:14:23] forgive, then that sweetness can come
[1:14:26] back to your
[1:14:29] spirit. The healing can come back in
[1:14:31] your
[1:14:33] life. The joy can come back.
[1:14:40] But unforgiveness costs
[1:14:45] bitterness. You said what that has to do
[1:14:47] with
[1:14:48] praying. See, he said when you pray,
[1:14:52] forgive. Are you with me? Amen.
[1:14:56] That your heavenly father should also
[1:14:58] what? Forgive you your trespass. So, if
[1:15:03] we going to get ready to have fasting
[1:15:05] and prayer week, then I want you to be
[1:15:08] able to
[1:15:10] forgive. Are you with me?
[1:15:13] Now, if you don't forgive, you said,
[1:15:15] "Well, I I know I forgive. Don't be so
[1:15:18] sure cuz God can bring something up
[1:15:21] before you. Don't be so sure of
[1:15:23] yourself." Sometimes we overconfident.
[1:15:27] I I thought I was going to preach
[1:15:30] on re
[1:15:32] religious but not
[1:15:35] saved, not born
[1:15:38] again. The Pharisees, they had
[1:15:41] religion, but they needed to be
[1:15:43] saved. Are you with me? They needed they
[1:15:47] needed God, but they was churchgoers and
[1:15:50] they was religious and they went through
[1:15:52] all the formality and all the riches and
[1:15:54] outside they look good.
[1:15:58] Brother and sister, we got to be careful
[1:16:00] that we are just not
[1:16:03] religious, that we actually are
[1:16:05] delivered and we are saved. Amen. Not
[1:16:09] outward show, but inwardly in our
[1:16:13] hearts,
[1:16:15] genuinely love God. Amen.
[1:16:20] You
[1:16:22] know, a real Christian
[1:16:25] cannot speak evil like some folk can do.
[1:16:30] True. Amen. They can't speak evil. No
[1:16:33] matter what you do to them, they let it
[1:16:35] go. Listen, just let it go. But some
[1:16:39] folk can't let
[1:16:41] go. I I ain't no never let it go. I said
[1:16:45] some folk ain't going to let go. They
[1:16:47] can't let go cuz they got too much
[1:16:48] meanness in
[1:16:50] them. Instead of saved and delivered,
[1:16:54] they are
[1:16:55] actually amen
[1:16:57] religious. They got a religious spirit
[1:17:00] and they come to church because they're
[1:17:06] religious. And sometimes they hold on to
[1:17:08] the religious spirit and they won't let
[1:17:12] go of that religious spirit to get God's
[1:17:14] spirit.
[1:17:16] to get the Holy
[1:17:18] Spirit. I'm going tell you that's a
[1:17:20] dangerous
[1:17:21] spirit. And the prophet of God said
[1:17:23] that's the worst spirit to cast out. You
[1:17:25] can't cast that out. Know why? Cuz they
[1:17:28] more spiritual
[1:17:31] than than everybody
[1:17:34] else. And because they're so spiritual
[1:17:36] than everybody else, no, you can't get
[1:17:39] no help.
[1:17:41] He said, "Because you say you
[1:17:43] see, your sins remain." Are you with me?
[1:17:47] You're
[1:17:48] blind. Because he came to open the eyes
[1:17:50] of the what? The blind.
[1:17:54] Are you with me? But because people say,
[1:17:57] "Well, I I'm all right." How can he save
[1:17:59] you when you're all right?
[1:18:02] How can he deliver on you when you say
[1:18:04] you're all right? when you when when
[1:18:06] there's so much corruption, so much Oh,
[1:18:09] goodness.
[1:18:11] Well, I I don't drink, I don't smoke, I
[1:18:14] don't commit adultery, but you
[1:18:17] mean. You just mean as you can be. Not
[1:18:20] to everybody. You know how to be sweet
[1:18:21] and kind to the people you
[1:18:23] like. If you don't like them, you won't
[1:18:25] even speak to them. You can't shake the
[1:18:27] hand. You I'm going to tell you how you
[1:18:30] do. What's wrong? Let me
[1:18:34] see. And then when you say, you ever see
[1:18:36] this? Come here, Roger Gerald. You ever
[1:18:38] see somebody shake your hand and this
[1:18:40] how they do this? They all that mean
[1:18:44] devil. Look at that. They said they
[1:18:48] said, they can't shake. And when they
[1:18:51] shake, I'm going to tell you what they
[1:18:52] do. Let me show you how they do. You
[1:18:55] They don't feel into it. You know, they
[1:18:58] let it drop. They they ain't going to
[1:19:00] shake your hand like, "God bless you,
[1:19:02] bro." You know what I'm saying? They
[1:19:04] can't shake like
[1:19:05] that. Oh, they want Oh, no. They all in
[1:19:08] the They in the street. They in the
[1:19:10] street then. They got a worldly shake.
[1:19:12] That young people
[1:19:13] shake. They got to be cool, slick. And
[1:19:17] some preachers come doing me like that.
[1:19:18] I said, "You older than
[1:19:23] me." I said, "You old preacher." I can
[1:19:26] see these young people trying to, you
[1:19:29] know. I said, "Well, what y'all doing?
[1:19:31] Y'all don't even know what it mean." I
[1:19:33] don't know
[1:19:33] either. Just being cool.
[1:19:37] But it's it like you shaking a brick.
[1:19:41] You shake the hand and it'll
[1:19:43] drop. Ain't no feeling in it. No love in
[1:19:46] it. They can't even look at you. Come
[1:19:48] here, brother Ernest. They They You go
[1:19:52] to shake their hand,
[1:19:58] they ain't no love in it. They can't
[1:20:01] love cuz they're
[1:20:04] religious. You can't love when you're
[1:20:07] religious. But if someone
[1:20:11] say I see
[1:20:13] you that hypocrite in spirit, they only
[1:20:17] love who they want to
[1:20:19] love. Praise
[1:20:21] God. If they think you done them wrong,
[1:20:25] they ain't going to love
[1:20:27] you. Are you with me? They can't look at
[1:20:31] you. They can't shake your hand. They
[1:20:35] can't
[1:20:36] smile. Are you with me? They can smile
[1:20:40] with those that got the same
[1:20:43] spirit. They can smile with
[1:20:45] those because those are holy people,
[1:20:49] sanctified people. They so holy and
[1:20:53] sanctified. Oh, they so filled with the
[1:20:55] spirit. Oh, they so those are my kind of
[1:20:59] people. You see what I'm saying? But I'm
[1:21:02] going to tell you
[1:21:04] something. It can be the violence of
[1:21:06] sinners.
[1:21:08] [Music]
[1:21:11] I remember I used to bring a a lady to
[1:21:17] church and in my car and my other I I
[1:21:21] was all my my first little mission in
[1:21:26] Bennisville that's about 50 years
[1:21:29] ago and I was bringing the older people
[1:21:34] elderly people because those were the
[1:21:36] first people I was baptizing in the
[1:21:38] river up there in Bennettville in the
[1:21:40] lake or whatever. Anyway,
[1:21:44] uh one lady I was
[1:21:47] bringing, she say the doctor told her
[1:21:51] not to take a
[1:21:55] bath and I was bringing her
[1:21:59] faithfully and the other people in the
[1:22:02] car that I had to pick up, they said,
[1:22:04] "Don't don't pick up.
[1:22:06] Please don't let her come to
[1:22:09] church. Well, she jump in the church and
[1:22:14] she she like to be happy, you
[1:22:18] know. And I'm telling you something, but
[1:22:22] you
[1:22:23] know, they would talk all the way.
[1:22:26] Everybody was about 70, 80 years old and
[1:22:29] stuff like that. They always elderly
[1:22:31] people.
[1:22:32] But you
[1:22:34] know, I looked at that lady and I I was
[1:22:37] I was having sympathy with
[1:22:39] her even
[1:22:41] though she was in that condition. I
[1:22:44] don't know how she got
[1:22:47] there. But I learned not to look down on
[1:22:51] nobody, no matter what condition they
[1:22:54] was
[1:22:56] in. I thank God for working in the
[1:23:00] hospital. We've had patients that nobody
[1:23:03] wanted to
[1:23:07] touch and they said,
[1:23:10] "Simmons, you young. You ain't got no
[1:23:14] family or wife. You take care of
[1:23:17] them." Because it was contagious what
[1:23:20] they had sometimes. So they said, "You
[1:23:23] ain't you take
[1:23:26] care." I could have said, "That's not my
[1:23:29] patient. I ain't taking care.
[1:23:32] But you got to have you go through
[1:23:35] certain things cuz God knows. I wasn't a
[1:23:38] preaching then, but God knows what path
[1:23:40] he going through. You can't look down on
[1:23:45] [Music]
[1:23:47] nobody and and think that you going to
[1:23:50] be all right. Have a compassion heart
[1:23:54] cuz you never know what life will bring.
[1:23:59] So when you're praying this week, think
[1:24:01] about
[1:24:02] somebody. Maybe you despise. Maybe you
[1:24:05] rejected. Maybe that's somebody might be
[1:24:08] hindering your
[1:24:12] prayer. Somebody you might believe don't
[1:24:15] love you, don't care about you, but
[1:24:17] that's you. Pray for them that God would
[1:24:21] give them the love of God.
[1:24:23] Are you with me? Amen.
[1:24:26] And God will let you love
[1:24:28] them. Love them with a perfect heart.
[1:24:33] Care about them. Amen. Amen. And be
[1:24:35] concerned about their soul. Amen. So
[1:24:38] when you pray, you can pray, "God, be
[1:24:41] merciful." Amen. Be merciful to those
[1:24:44] people that don't even understand
[1:24:47] themselves. Amen. Have pity.
[1:24:53] I'd rather suffer with that
[1:24:57] woman. As long as she came, I'd rather
[1:24:59] suffer with her. And all of us in the
[1:25:02] church would
[1:25:04] suffer because she wanted to
[1:25:07] come. You
[1:25:10] see, God worked it out in due time, but
[1:25:14] sometimes you got to let God work things
[1:25:16] out. Amen. Amen. Sometimes the thing
[1:25:19] that you have to go through that God
[1:25:21] going to work out for you if you love.
[1:25:24] Amen. Amen. If you got an honest and
[1:25:26] sincere heart and you love the person
[1:25:29] despite of their condition. Amen. Amen.
[1:25:32] We talking about a smell when I'm
[1:25:34] talking about how stink your sin smell
[1:25:37] in God's sight. Amen. Amen. You're
[1:25:40] talking about a natural condition. Not
[1:25:42] how your bad attitude smells in God's
[1:25:46] sight. Amen. Your bad character, how it
[1:25:50] smells to God. I rather be
[1:25:53] physically smelling than natural
[1:25:56] spiritually stinking in God's nostril.
[1:25:59] Amen.
[1:26:01] Your spirit and your
[1:26:05] attitude towards the thing of the Lord
[1:26:08] things of the
[1:26:13] Lord. It causes a bad smell. It's not a
[1:26:17] sweet incense in in the go in
[1:26:22] God's sight. God bless you. I I talked
[1:26:26] to y'all because I was going to cut it
[1:26:29] short, but I had some people come in and
[1:26:32] I just
[1:26:33] [Music]
[1:26:36] lingered. God bless you. Thank y'all for
[1:26:40] coming. Let us stand.
[1:26:47] Sin will cause God not to hear your
[1:26:50] prayer. Be humble when you
[1:26:54] [Music]
[1:26:58] pray. Greet one another with a holy
[1:27:02] kiss. Remember young s got saved young
[1:27:07] and a fellow deacon in one of the
[1:27:09] churches we fellowship with? He was
[1:27:11] kissing people in the mouth. I said
[1:27:15] uhuh no no no no
[1:27:17] no. I He say greet him with a holy kiss.
[1:27:20] I said yeah but
[1:27:23] not you know greet one another with a
[1:27:26] holy kiss on the back of the neck
[1:27:29] somewhere if you want to do that.
[1:27:33] But I want you to greet one another with
[1:27:37] holiness in your heart. Our holiness
[1:27:41] kiss is not like the Jews in the foreign
[1:27:43] some foreign country. Our holy kiss is
[1:27:47] nice
[1:27:48] handshake, a nice hug and greet. You
[1:27:52] know what I'm saying? That's the
[1:27:54] American
[1:27:55] style. Are you with me? A good greeting
[1:27:59] with a pleasant spirit. Are you with me?
[1:28:02] Amen. I think that fell went a little
[1:28:05] too far.
[1:28:07] Are you with me? Amen. So by the grace
[1:28:10] of God, let us
[1:28:13] not go too far and but let us be nice,
[1:28:18] kind, gentle, sweet and loving one to
[1:28:22] another.
[1:28:26] Okay? Not bitter, indifferent, but sweet
[1:28:31] like Sister
[1:28:32] [Music]
[1:28:34] Patricia. Okay?
[1:28:37] He said, "Why don't you call her out?"
[1:28:39] She always smiling and just is nice and
[1:28:42] sweet. I know Brother Fred appreciate
[1:28:46] that.
[1:28:48] Amen. Thank the Lord. Amen. God bless
[1:28:51] you, y'all. I don't know how to close,
[1:28:53] but y'all All right tonight. Amen. We
