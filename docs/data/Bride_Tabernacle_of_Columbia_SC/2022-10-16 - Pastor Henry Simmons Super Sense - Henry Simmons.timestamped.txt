[33:48] and that we oh God just love you more
[33:51] God we want to serve you more in Jesus
[33:54] Christ's name we pray amen
[33:58] Hebrews 11 1-7
[34:02] I read the first you read the next and
[34:04] we read the latter verse together
[34:12] the song says oh I want to see him
[34:15] look upon his face
[34:18] there to sing forever I'll be saving
[34:20] grace on the streets of Glory
[34:27] praise God
[34:29] let me live a voice
[34:33] it says now Faith is the substance of
[34:36] things hoped for
[34:38] the evidence of things not seen too
[34:44] through faith we understand that the
[34:47] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[34:51] that the things which are seen were not
[34:53] made of the things which do appear for
[35:10] by faith in it was translated that he
[35:14] should not see there and was not found
[35:17] because God had translated him for
[35:21] before his translation he had this
[35:24] testimony that he pleads God six
[35:39] together by Faith Lord being warned of
[35:43] God of things not yet see
[35:47] yeah with the heart for the saving of
[35:50] his house by which he condemned the
[35:53] world and became ears of the
[35:55] righteousness which is by faith
[36:02] the baby seated God bless you
[36:05] amen God is good amen
[36:09] now we want to talk about the super
[36:11] sense of Faith to Sixth Sense amen
[36:16] so by the grace of God we understand
[36:18] that
[36:19] the we have five senses and those five
[36:23] senses contact the Earthly
[36:26] the Earthly man and thou Earthly
[36:29] environment
[36:31] by the grace of God
[36:34] it's
[36:35] but only to a Christian we have what we
[36:39] call the sixth sense of the super sense
[36:43] we have to be a Christian we have to be
[36:45] born again that means we have to be have
[36:48] the Holy Ghost
[36:51] Western remarkable
[36:55] in these last days as we look at the
[36:57] world
[36:58] it's very very dog settings
[37:03] the world is setting in a very dark time
[37:07] that we're living in
[37:09] and I'm gonna tell you everywhere you
[37:11] look it's just
[37:12] Darkness
[37:14] and um because the world is so dumb
[37:18] you know I
[37:21] I wrote down the other day let your
[37:24] lights shine
[37:26] let your light shine
[37:28] why because the world is so full of
[37:31] Darkness
[37:33] so in Isaiah 60 it says arise Shine for
[37:37] the light has come and the glory of the
[37:39] Lord is risen upon him
[37:40] thee for Behold The Darkness ship cover
[37:44] the Earth and grossed Darkness the
[37:46] people but the Lord shall rise
[37:49] upon thee and His glory shall be seen
[37:53] upon thee
[37:55] because we're living in such a dark time
[38:00] then it's almost like the people have
[38:03] lost the sense
[38:05] of
[38:07] what's right and what's wrong
[38:11] it seems like we're living in a world
[38:12] that we don't care anymore
[38:16] it's just about that
[38:18] Satan has just about taken over
[38:21] but in Hebrews talked about
[38:24] the days of Noah
[38:27] and I believe we have entered into
[38:30] the darkest time in world history we've
[38:34] entered into a place that
[38:36] is so dog to
[38:39] people or just
[38:41] giving themselves over to lasciviousness
[38:44] the things of the world the lust of this
[38:46] world they've just they're just in
[38:49] drafted it
[38:51] and I said boy if you were on the other
[38:53] side of the chasma and you look out and
[38:55] you see how dark it is
[38:58] then you say oh God
[39:01] have mercy
[39:03] but you know if
[39:05] to a person that lived in darkness all
[39:08] the time it's not really down to them
[39:11] because that's the way they live they
[39:13] lived in dog so you're accustomed to dog
[39:16] it's like the fish at the bottom of the
[39:18] ocean it's real deep it's real dark and
[39:21] they're pressurized to it
[39:23] so one that's you know living down in
[39:26] the depths of the ocean if he comes up
[39:29] and saw the lighting being another
[39:32] it'd be almost another world
[39:35] so it's like that
[39:38] we were sometimes in darkness
[39:41] we were so we lived in darkness it's
[39:45] like a blind man a blind man that never
[39:47] saw before he learned to adjust
[39:49] themselves to the darkness
[39:52] and we in time passed in the five cents
[39:56] room
[39:57] we walked
[39:59] in the flesh
[40:01] and remind the things of the flesh
[40:04] so by the grace of God you couldn't tell
[40:07] us that it was another dimension it was
[40:10] another place it was another kingdom
[40:13] the the Colossians says he's delivered
[40:16] us out of the power of Darkness
[40:19] and translated us into the kingdom of
[40:21] his dear son now we don't know if you
[40:25] never I could talk about a kingdom you
[40:28] know I could talk about you know you
[40:31] know over in South Africa I could talk
[40:33] about over in Romania but that's just
[40:36] talking you know what I'm saying maybe
[40:39] you can even look at it on
[40:41] you know to see the Lions and the
[40:44] elephants and different things but once
[40:47] you're there in the presence and it it
[40:50] it it sheds a Different Light you see it
[40:52] you write down
[40:54] So you you're in the Africa you're in
[40:57] these different countries
[40:59] and it's just like a word that you heard
[41:02] about but you don't know really you know
[41:06] you heard that it exists and you've seen
[41:08] pictures that exist but you really had
[41:11] not experienced that world
[41:13] and I'm saying there's certain things
[41:15] that we have not experienced
[41:18] it's a world of the Unseen realm and
[41:22] we're talking about the super sense only
[41:24] Christians are able to visualize and
[41:27] enter into that place
[41:29] only when we're born again do we
[41:32] understand that Kingdom that because
[41:35] heaven is a faith in the super sense is
[41:40] is higher than the heavens is away from
[41:43] the earth so that's how high
[41:46] Heaven I mean the supersets faith
[41:50] faith
[41:51] come by hearing and hear and come by the
[41:54] word of God
[41:56] so the light
[41:58] that we are talking about
[42:00] that we should let in I'm talking about
[42:03] this just start world and uh uh uh
[42:06] Proverbs uh 4 and 18. proverbs 4 and 18
[42:11] says
[42:21] 4 and 18.
[42:23] it says
[42:25] but the path of the just is as a what
[42:29] the path of the Justice as a Shining
[42:32] Light
[42:33] the path of the Justice as a Shining
[42:35] Light
[42:36] praise God the Bible said the just shall
[42:39] live by faith isn't that right
[42:42] but the path of the justice is as a
[42:45] Shining Light
[42:47] praise God and then I says you know
[42:50] let your light so shine I'm not trying
[42:52] to preach so much as I'm trying to talk
[42:55] to you a little bit because we're in a
[42:57] state
[42:58] amen that this world is going farther
[43:02] and further and deeper and deeper into
[43:04] the darkness
[43:06] demon powers
[43:08] satanic forces are planned in the world
[43:12] into deeper
[43:15] so they're being dumb
[43:17] you know it gets so dark
[43:19] you know that
[43:22] you won't be able to see light at all
[43:25] and that's why God has to come and get
[43:27] the little light
[43:29] that's left in this world he has to take
[43:31] us up and Rapture us
[43:33] because he said if it was possible
[43:37] here deceived the very leg
[43:41] so the world is getting so
[43:43] twist up and
[43:45] it's getting so dark
[43:47] that there's no hunger and thirst
[43:49] there's no desire for righteousness
[43:52] there's no desire for God
[43:55] people the Bible says
[43:57] in the days of Noah every imagination
[43:59] and thought of men heart was continually
[44:02] evil
[44:03] so it's getting to that point that he
[44:06] said as it was in the days of Noah and
[44:08] as it was in the days of Life thus shall
[44:10] it be in the day when the son of man is
[44:12] revealed this thing is getting so dark
[44:16] amen so every thought and every
[44:18] imagination
[44:21] and everything that's in the heart of
[44:23] men was going to be so evil and so
[44:26] corrupt
[44:27] so you wonder what's eating at you
[44:30] you wonder why things are just pulling
[44:33] in the forces of darkness is trying to
[44:36] suck us into a deep hole
[44:40] so that's it's almost like it's it's a
[44:44] pool it's a force that really pulling on
[44:47] us trying to
[44:49] a woo us into that dark place and you
[44:53] wonder why there's so many mass
[44:55] shootings all over the place
[44:57] people just go you know they're just
[45:00] losing it they're just look at all these
[45:03] hosts calling schools and all
[45:07] and people are again to the point that
[45:11] then it's not going to be hosts the
[45:14] people just gone they're just going to
[45:16] go chaoted
[45:18] and that's what's going on
[45:21] we have to break
[45:25] I think the President says we had to
[45:27] break we had a point a Tipping Point
[45:31] we're at an edge
[45:32] with Armageddon can break forth at any
[45:35] time
[45:36] the battle of Armageddon which is the
[45:38] last war
[45:40] the third world war it could go forth if
[45:42] a set of Russia release those nuclear
[45:45] bombs
[45:46] then that would start Armageddon
[45:50] and it tempted to do it you're right at
[45:53] the edge
[45:55] if they're pushed to do that
[45:57] then where are we going to be
[46:01] well we're in a world where
[46:03] what we're doing now
[46:07] That's How we'll continue with we want
[46:09] now we want everything now
[46:12] but what we're saying there's a super
[46:14] sense that the world
[46:17] that you can live in and you can be
[46:19] comfortable and you can have peace
[46:23] but this world here has nothing for
[46:26] tomorrow
[46:29] is not promising
[46:31] today is the day of salvation
[46:35] today if you will hear his voice he said
[46:37] heart not your heart
[46:39] so we're living in the now now Faith is
[46:43] the substance of things hopeful it's the
[46:45] evidence of Things Not Seen so I'm
[46:47] trying to tell you though you're not
[46:50] looking at it now it's real there is a
[46:54] real realm that is a place called the
[46:57] super sense that is a faith places a
[47:01] place of Faith a place where there's
[47:03] light he says here proverbs 4 and 18 but
[47:08] the path of the just
[47:10] is as a Shining Light and I said to just
[47:13] shall live by faith
[47:15] and we said in Matthew 5 it says let
[47:19] your lights shine
[47:23] amen that
[47:27] that's Shining Light that shineth more
[47:30] and more until the what
[47:32] perfect day
[47:34] are you whipping the path for the
[47:36] justice that The Shining Light was
[47:37] shining more and more to the perfect day
[47:40] that is a perfect day coming
[47:43] amen the day of redemption draws nine
[47:48] men hearts are failing because of fear
[47:52] but there is a day of where the redeem
[47:55] of the Lord will be caught up to meet
[47:58] him that redeemed us
[48:01] the Lord Jesus Christ we are near not
[48:04] our
[48:05] we're so close to that time
[48:09] we're so close to the hour where God
[48:12] will take his people out of here because
[48:15] it's so dull
[48:18] we can't stand too much more
[48:20] of what's going on let me just look at
[48:22] Matthew's what I was saying let your
[48:24] light shine because the
[48:28] we need Faith to get out of here
[48:31] Matthew 5.
[48:33] we need Faith to get out of here because
[48:37] if we don't get in a hurry for God
[48:41] the devil is going to
[48:43] take
[48:45] this world into a spin
[48:48] and to a place
[48:50] the Bible said the world is going to be
[48:52] turned upside down like a drunk man
[48:59] and I tell you this world has been
[49:01] turned upside down
[49:06] the devil is taking driving folks into
[49:09] insanity
[49:17] we were talking about how insane the
[49:19] world is
[49:21] the world is totally
[49:25] sometimes you look at the condition in
[49:27] the schoolhouse but they don't even know
[49:30] it
[49:31] the world has gone insane and don't
[49:33] don't have no understanding of it they
[49:35] they just out of it they they don't even
[49:38] know that they're insane why because
[49:40] everybody else is
[49:43] so if everybody else says only the ones
[49:46] that got a little light
[49:50] the little light shine and those are
[49:52] only ones that and they what they look
[49:54] like they look crazy
[49:57] the ones that trying to live for God and
[50:00] got a little light shine those are the
[50:02] ones that look crazy
[50:04] those are the ones that look uh where
[50:06] you come from another world you're on
[50:08] another planet you know come on be real
[50:12] so what happens the people don't know
[50:15] that they're living in Insanity that the
[50:18] devil has taken their minds
[50:21] but I was saying
[50:25] if I were gossipingly here this is the
[50:27] number of the loss whom the God of this
[50:29] world has what
[50:31] blinded to what
[50:33] the mind
[50:34] the devil has blinded people mind so bad
[50:38] but that's got to be somebody
[50:41] that said God I want God
[50:45] Lord Jesus I want to live for you
[50:49] there's got to be somebody that's
[50:51] hungering and thirsting other than that
[50:54] amen
[50:55] they're going to be pulled in that
[50:57] sankhole
[50:59] into that pit called hell
[51:03] they're gonna and then it's a chaotic
[51:06] life brother Nathan and I was talking he
[51:09] says God
[51:10] he was talking about a a nightclub which
[51:13] is saying call the atmosphere and how
[51:16] everybody you know the The Prestige
[51:19] people were there and the people that
[51:21] they thought was somebody in Colombia
[51:24] he said
[51:25] but
[51:26] everything in there was
[51:29] you know people had turned people that
[51:32] you thought was a man and thought was a
[51:34] woman it was all twisted up in there
[51:39] he said
[51:40] he said you know sometimes
[51:43] now if he was talking about
[51:46] 30 40 years ago
[51:48] how chaotic it is was I'm telling you
[51:51] what is the condition now
[51:55] what do you think how you think things
[51:58] look now if he was so scared it was so
[52:02] scary being how scary is it now
[52:09] I'm gonna tell you so
[52:10] you know I you know I was preaching uh
[52:14] mother English funeral and she was 102.
[52:18] I can say I I can imagine how things
[52:21] look
[52:22] you know
[52:25] when she was a girl and then passing
[52:28] through to over
[52:31] uh in the new century and all of that
[52:35] I said God she must say oh Lord
[52:39] what kind of world is those things
[52:41] beyond your imagination things that you
[52:44] thought you'll never see
[52:49] and myself being the 70 years old we
[52:52] didn't think this thing would get this
[52:54] bad
[52:55] the world will get in the condition it's
[52:57] in now
[52:59] and then where's the hope for our
[53:01] children
[53:02] where's the hope for our Grands
[53:07] they the only safe place the only place
[53:10] we can run to and find rest
[53:16] is in Jesus Christ
[53:19] that's the only safe place
[53:22] the only place we can point them to
[53:24] because they're gone
[53:27] The World Is Gone
[53:31] they gone and they don't even know
[53:33] they're gone
[53:36] they're gone to the road
[53:40] they can't return
[53:42] they cross that line
[53:45] of coming back
[53:46] [Music]
[53:47] brother and sister and you wonder where
[53:49] the pressure is coming from
[53:52] we'll look for help and we want to be
[53:55] helped we want we we want somebody to
[53:58] understand and we want to help Lord Lord
[54:01] I need help Lord I need something now
[54:03] but
[54:05] how can we get help
[54:06] that we're not coming to the one that
[54:09] can't help us
[54:11] we'll turn into every kind of resource
[54:13] we can but the one that really can help
[54:16] us we don't want his help
[54:21] the one that can really give us what
[54:24] we're looking for but we don't want it
[54:26] from him
[54:29] give it to us Lord I need help no we're
[54:33] not saying Lord
[54:34] we're trying to get every resource we
[54:37] can to help us but the only one that
[54:40] could really help us is the one that we
[54:42] don't want
[54:43] because we don't think that oh God it's
[54:48] not for me oh
[54:50] the love of God the one that loves you
[54:52] the best the one that cares more about
[54:54] your soul the one to care more about
[54:56] your life but we don't want him
[55:00] the one that can really give us
[55:03] that which our soul is thirsting for our
[55:06] heart needs but we don't want him
[55:12] it's just like a young lady
[55:16] a nice young man that
[55:19] it's got an education got a nice job
[55:23] trying to live a Christian Life she
[55:25] don't want him
[55:27] she wants a thug
[55:30] somebody that's gonna
[55:32] slap and beat on her
[55:35] she wants that kind of person she wants
[55:38] somebody with
[55:39] their pants hanging down and Chained and
[55:43] around the neck
[55:45] and you know stuff like that and you
[55:47] want somebody to look cool and slick but
[55:50] she don't want a young man that's going
[55:52] to take care of her be a husband to her
[55:54] father to the children she don't want
[55:56] that kind of man she want a cool slick
[55:59] dude
[56:01] you know and the kind of God we we we
[56:04] picture we don't want a God that's
[56:07] that's going to love us and go care for
[56:10] us and amen now died for us and give
[56:13] himself for us
[56:15] in a supply all of our needs we don't
[56:18] want that kind of God
[56:20] that really loves us really is concerned
[56:23] about us really care for us will it
[56:25] supply all your needs
[56:27] ah
[56:29] no
[56:30] say because the world that we've
[56:34] accustomed to that we're living in we're
[56:36] living in the five cents realm and and
[56:39] we're operating down we don't know
[56:41] nothing about amen this other world that
[56:43] we're talking about the faith the super
[56:45] sense we don't know nothing about that
[56:47] we don't understand that and when you
[56:50] talk about it it seems to be a fairy
[56:52] tale
[56:54] are you with me
[56:56] but it's real
[56:58] it's not a fairy tale it is another
[57:00] place that you can go and you can find
[57:04] so let's there
[57:06] the prophet said I say unto you shalom
[57:10] peace
[57:12] there's another place
[57:15] and brother and sister
[57:17] I trust that you and I
[57:19] would come to that place
[57:21] to what I really need
[57:24] amen I can't understand I'm I'm feeling
[57:28] this way and I'm designed to go in a way
[57:31] that the way I feel uh the way I
[57:34] understand but God is saying this Faith
[57:37] the super sense this place that I want
[57:40] to take you amen only where you can
[57:42] understand it is to be born again
[57:45] amen the only way you can get there amen
[57:48] you got to desire you got to hung in
[57:51] thirds you got to say God I want it
[57:53] he's not going to force himself
[57:56] [Music]
[57:58] they're not going to force himself on
[57:59] you
[58:00] he's not going to make you live right
[58:04] it ain't it ain't so much about living
[58:06] right as we thinking that I can't do
[58:09] this I can't do that I want you to God
[58:12] it's God ain't about that it may look
[58:14] that way it's just that God gives us
[58:17] another desire
[58:19] it's not that I can't do this and I I
[58:22] can't do that but it looks that way
[58:24] sometimes because sometimes we're saying
[58:26] don't do this and don't do that but it's
[58:28] not that
[58:30] it's that it's another life that wants
[58:33] to live itself through you
[58:35] it's another person that amen that God
[58:39] wants you to come and acquainted with
[58:41] amen that God says I want to release to
[58:44] you I want you to understand that that's
[58:48] something Beyond this one and this light
[58:50] here it's another life that exists it's
[58:53] called eternal life
[58:55] it's called Zoe it's called God's own
[58:58] life there is another one
[59:01] that I want you to come in contact I
[59:04] want you to know me
[59:07] the source of life
[59:09] God wants you to be in contact with the
[59:12] Creator
[59:13] the one that cares more about you than
[59:15] you care about yourself
[59:17] don't want to know more about you than
[59:19] you know about yourself
[59:22] God wants you to be acquainted with him
[59:25] in his love
[59:27] but yet we because of this flesh rim
[59:31] because we're so caught up and because
[59:34] we don't understand it and it looks like
[59:37] it looked to us in the flesh a Christian
[59:42] walk and a Christian Life look like a
[59:45] life that is gonna cause uh cause me to
[59:49] look like uh hey hey it's gonna cause me
[59:52] to look huh
[59:54] no and a lot of people have come in
[59:56] contact with their life and tried to
[59:59] live that kind of Christian Life and try
[1:00:02] to walk the Christian walk amen what
[1:00:05] amen they wasn't born again so to them
[1:00:09] it was bondage because they tried to do
[1:00:12] something without him being there
[1:00:15] so they called a Christian Life a life
[1:00:18] amen of do's and don'ts and laws and
[1:00:21] amen but they lived under the law amen
[1:00:24] but faith is not a law
[1:00:27] amen it's something that was brought up
[1:00:29] that Abraham paid tithes while he was
[1:00:32] yet in the arms of his father I mean
[1:00:34] Levi paid tithes while he was yet in the
[1:00:36] lungs of his father Abraham it was it
[1:00:39] was by faith that he did it it wasn't
[1:00:42] that uh you got to do it because if you
[1:00:44] don't do it you're going to be cursed no
[1:00:46] he if nobody talked about being cursed
[1:00:49] with Abraham he paid ties to Melchizedek
[1:00:52] it wasn't nothing to mention about amen
[1:00:56] if you don't do it you're gonna be he
[1:00:57] just did it because it was a revelation
[1:01:00] revealed to him he wanted to do it and
[1:01:03] I'll tell you something what you receive
[1:01:05] the Holy Ghost once you receive Jesus
[1:01:08] Christ by faith you want to live right
[1:01:11] it's not nothing that I I'm pressured in
[1:01:14] and mama said I can't do this and
[1:01:16] Daddy's saying the preachers say in the
[1:01:18] church say it's not about none of that
[1:01:20] stuff
[1:01:22] that all is about is uh I love him and I
[1:01:25] want to please him
[1:01:27] this is what I want because why I'm a
[1:01:30] new creature I'm a new creation I want
[1:01:33] my faith not by saying
[1:01:35] praise God I'm living in a place amen
[1:01:38] that I'm pleased to dwell in
[1:01:40] praise God I'm living I'm living a life
[1:01:43] that I love
[1:01:45] because I love him because he is alive
[1:01:48] amen and I come in contact with what
[1:01:51] life is really real and what it's all
[1:01:53] about because before I I thought I had
[1:01:56] it
[1:01:57] just because we come to church and we
[1:01:59] get a new spirit maybe we stop drinking
[1:02:02] and stop smoking and maybe we stop lying
[1:02:05] but never come all the way
[1:02:09] brother Nathan and myself was talking
[1:02:11] about you know starting off on the
[1:02:13] Christian Journey we had some ups and
[1:02:15] downs and twists in turn but
[1:02:18] I said I knew it within myself that I I
[1:02:21] didn't total surrender yet
[1:02:24] I said but when it came to that place
[1:02:25] when I told her surrender my life then I
[1:02:28] got to know Jesus
[1:02:30] then I was able to receive the Holy
[1:02:32] Ghost
[1:02:33] but before you know I was trying to live
[1:02:36] I wanted to live it I wanted to do right
[1:02:40] but I had battles
[1:02:42] and I didn't cross over yet
[1:02:44] are you with me and see some of the
[1:02:47] times we have those battles within
[1:02:49] ourselves that we know amen we haven't
[1:02:51] given up the world we haven't given up
[1:02:53] everything you know but when we realize
[1:02:56] is it worth it
[1:02:58] it's Jesus Christ is eternal life worth
[1:03:01] giving up everything for
[1:03:03] do you love him enough to give up
[1:03:05] everything
[1:03:07] do you love him enough to believe that
[1:03:10] he has a better place
[1:03:12] well he said in my father's Kingdom In
[1:03:14] My Father's House of many mentions do
[1:03:16] you love him enough to believe that he's
[1:03:18] do you believe his report do you believe
[1:03:20] what he's saying is right
[1:03:23] do you believe that God was faithful do
[1:03:26] you believe that he's not lying to you
[1:03:28] do you believe that he's telling you the
[1:03:30] truth do you believe that he's got
[1:03:32] something better for you that hey
[1:03:35] Hallelujah that the devil can ever offer
[1:03:37] you
[1:03:38] so he said eyes are not seen ear have
[1:03:41] not heard neither have entered into the
[1:03:43] heart of man the thing that God has
[1:03:45] prepared for them that would love him
[1:03:48] to them that I have faith in him to them
[1:03:51] that I have confidence in him God has
[1:03:54] something better for you but brothers
[1:03:56] and sisters up to you
[1:03:58] to take advantage of God's opportunity
[1:04:00] that he presents to you that he wants to
[1:04:03] give you you must take it's available to
[1:04:06] you but one day it won't be a failover
[1:04:08] no more
[1:04:09] so it's not about a lot of do's and
[1:04:12] don't say you you must do this and
[1:04:14] you've got to do that if you don't do
[1:04:16] this amen you're going to hell it ain't
[1:04:18] about amen you're going to hell if you
[1:04:20] don't and if I don't do this oh God
[1:04:26] the preacher's gonna be mad at me God
[1:04:29] don't be mad at you God don't want you
[1:04:31] to be scared of him God wants you to
[1:04:33] love him
[1:04:34] praise God Amen who wants to marry
[1:04:37] somebody that you're scared of
[1:04:40] who wants to be in love with somebody
[1:04:42] amen that that you're scared of that
[1:04:45] that
[1:04:46] if you do wrong it gonna punish you
[1:04:51] you got to be in love with God Amen get
[1:04:54] get over the fear I I know I'm gonna I'm
[1:04:58] gonna go to hell I know God don't get me
[1:05:00] if I
[1:05:02] feeling about God God gave me if I do
[1:05:05] wrong oh Lord no no no no
[1:05:09] it's not a scary place rather than
[1:05:12] sister it's not see sometimes we we live
[1:05:14] in the fear I better not do that because
[1:05:18] uh
[1:05:19] it's a it's another whole world we don't
[1:05:22] we don't even live like that amen as a
[1:05:25] young person I didn't live like I can't
[1:05:27] do this I can't do that no no no no no
[1:05:30] it wasn't that
[1:05:32] it's it was another whole it was a joy
[1:05:36] to know the Lord and to live for the
[1:05:38] Lord it was a joy it was a piece amen I
[1:05:41] didn't want to do it
[1:05:43] I didn't want to do it no more I didn't
[1:05:45] want to live that way no more no
[1:05:48] because why I found real life
[1:05:51] real purpose
[1:05:54] so I didn't want to do it no more
[1:05:57] wasn't the battle was it a fight
[1:06:01] I think
[1:06:03] the devil would always you're gonna have
[1:06:06] to fight for every inch of the ground
[1:06:09] you're gonna have to fight continually
[1:06:11] that's why Jude said I would let you
[1:06:14] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[1:06:17] once delivered to the Saints
[1:06:19] there's a constantly contending for the
[1:06:22] faith because there's a faith that God
[1:06:25] wants you to fight and I'm saying in
[1:06:28] such a dark world
[1:06:30] he said let your light so shine the men
[1:06:32] should see your good works
[1:06:34] and glorify your father which is heaven
[1:06:37] amen so it's a fight every day amen to
[1:06:41] let the light shine why because amen the
[1:06:46] devil will have you to back up or
[1:06:48] reverse amen where you at he wants you
[1:06:52] to go backwards instead of forward
[1:06:55] and so what happens you have to stand
[1:06:58] fast
[1:06:59] in the Liberty where will Christ have
[1:07:01] made you free
[1:07:02] and be not again entangled with the Yoke
[1:07:05] abundance
[1:07:06] amen God you know I I said you must have
[1:07:10] a a freedom about yourself
[1:07:13] Lord I own the sunset free is free
[1:07:17] indeed
[1:07:18] there's so many Christians walk around
[1:07:20] bound all up and that's why people and
[1:07:23] people can say well I tried it I tried
[1:07:25] to be a Christian I tried to live like
[1:07:27] that I tried to be one of those amen but
[1:07:30] I I found myself that
[1:07:33] it was a lot of bondage so what happens
[1:07:36] people have have made Christianity a
[1:07:40] disgrace instead of Grace
[1:07:43] because they can say well I'm still
[1:07:45] saved I'm still a Christian but I can
[1:07:47] live like I want I can do like I want to
[1:07:50] but I still know God I still love God I
[1:07:53] love him just as much as you do no doubt
[1:07:55] you do I believe the Cain loved God just
[1:07:58] as much as Ava loved God
[1:08:01] because he wouldn't offer sacrifice to
[1:08:04] God
[1:08:05] but he wanted to he loved God in his own
[1:08:08] way
[1:08:09] he wanted to do it his own way amen but
[1:08:12] Abel recognized that it was the blood it
[1:08:15] was a Redemption amen it was a price
[1:08:17] that God paid amen praise God
[1:08:20] it was I it was the blood it was a
[1:08:23] rejection it was all about redeeming me
[1:08:26] it was about oh
[1:08:28] I'm telling you God had a Redemption
[1:08:29] plan and God Amen redeemed us was his
[1:08:33] own blood he gave himself for us
[1:08:35] praise God Amen it was Redemption amen
[1:08:39] and sometimes we want to do it with
[1:08:41] bypassing Calvary but I'm saying if you
[1:08:44] get a good look at Calvary and what
[1:08:46] Jesus did for you amen you see amen
[1:08:49] there's nothing that we could do for
[1:08:51] ourselves but it was the blood of Jesus
[1:08:54] amen he loved us so much
[1:08:57] that he gave himself for us
[1:09:00] praise God he loved us so much that he
[1:09:02] lived on his life he was able to be
[1:09:05] mocked
[1:09:07] get on talk about
[1:09:11] Hallelujah God that cared so much about
[1:09:14] us didn't do no wrong
[1:09:17] all he did was good yeah they didn't
[1:09:20] want him Hallelujah that's all God want
[1:09:23] to do for you all he wants to do is heal
[1:09:26] your body is all he wants us to do amen
[1:09:29] praise God and Supply your needs all he
[1:09:31] wants to do is do your goods but yet we
[1:09:34] don't want him that will take up
[1:09:37] arrivals that will say crucify him
[1:09:40] all he wants to do is do good to us well
[1:09:43] do we believe it do we really believe
[1:09:45] that God wants to do us good and not
[1:09:48] evil
[1:09:49] amen he said the thief come to kill to
[1:09:51] steal and destroy but I'm come that they
[1:09:54] might have life
[1:09:55] and that they made Heaven more
[1:09:57] abundantly God comes to give your life
[1:10:00] that's what the thief wants to do the
[1:10:02] kill the steel and this draw you but
[1:10:05] whoa what we're believing we believe in
[1:10:08] the thief
[1:10:10] amen we believe in that life of the
[1:10:12] devil we believe in what we feel what we
[1:10:15] see what we think
[1:10:17] and not what our hearts really need
[1:10:20] not what our deep call into the deep The
[1:10:23] Thirst of our soul
[1:10:25] only God can supply that
[1:10:31] I can't make you see
[1:10:34] and I can't make you wanna
[1:10:37] praise God I Think Jesus has already
[1:10:39] done enough
[1:10:41] that he said whosoever will
[1:10:44] let him come
[1:10:46] are you with me
[1:10:49] seeing the world has gone its fault
[1:10:54] so they're taking the word and they just
[1:10:57] crucified
[1:11:03] maybe in time passed we
[1:11:06] we've had our mistakes
[1:11:08] as ministers we've had our mistakes
[1:11:13] amen but we're preaching a god of love
[1:11:17] a God that really cares about you
[1:11:20] maybe sometimes as parents we made our
[1:11:22] mistakes
[1:11:25] but God wants you to know
[1:11:27] it's not a dudes that don't it's not a
[1:11:29] law
[1:11:30] but it's the love that we want you to
[1:11:32] know
[1:11:34] we want you to love him with all your
[1:11:36] heart
[1:11:37] because we have come in contact with a
[1:11:39] loving God
[1:11:41] a god of love a God that cares about us
[1:11:45] maybe look from the outside
[1:11:47] I don't want you to do that I want you
[1:11:49] to go that way
[1:11:52] I don't want you to do this
[1:11:54] maybe we look like a lot of do's and
[1:11:56] don'ts and a lot of laws
[1:11:59] maybe we've been guilty
[1:12:02] but brother and sister we're being
[1:12:03] guilty please forgive us
[1:12:06] but this is a god of love
[1:12:08] and we want you to receive the love of
[1:12:10] God
[1:12:12] are you with me
[1:12:14] and we want you to because you're loving
[1:12:16] amen you want to hey
[1:12:19] yeah
[1:12:20] see
[1:12:23] is love the essence of God himself amen
[1:12:29] it's his life
[1:12:32] I gotta go from now
[1:12:34] and I might
[1:12:36] I might be real short here
[1:12:38] he says Paul says I'm crucified with
[1:12:42] Christ
[1:12:43] amen nevertheless he said I live
[1:12:47] amen but he says it's not me that's
[1:12:50] living
[1:12:51] amen
[1:12:53] yet
[1:12:55] not I
[1:12:57] but Christ liveth
[1:12:59] in me
[1:13:01] in the life that I now live
[1:13:04] in the flesh
[1:13:07] I live by the faith of the Son of God
[1:13:10] Who Loved Me
[1:13:13] and gave himself for me
[1:13:15] amen
[1:13:18] Who Loved Me
[1:13:19] and gave himself from me
[1:13:23] that's what's going on
[1:13:25] so this is not something that's hard
[1:13:27] it's difficult why because
[1:13:30] the one that I accept I receiveth my
[1:13:33] Lord my savior
[1:13:35] he not only I mean he came down
[1:13:41] and the old man is crucified
[1:13:44] the life that I used to live the things
[1:13:47] that I used to do it was crucified it
[1:13:50] died
[1:13:54] he said it
[1:13:57] it's not your spirit that died but it
[1:14:00] was the nature of your spirit
[1:14:03] that's what God died that old nature
[1:14:07] died
[1:14:09] are you with me and God gives you his
[1:14:12] divine nature
[1:14:14] and when you got that divine nature
[1:14:16] inside you amen praise God praise God if
[1:14:20] I had
[1:14:22] the Spirit uh
[1:14:25] a Beethoven
[1:14:28] are you a man
[1:14:31] if you had the spirit
[1:14:34] amen of
[1:14:36] some great philosopher
[1:14:40] Plato's
[1:14:44] you you'll be able to
[1:14:48] save some of those
[1:14:50] great things
[1:14:52] it's whatever spirit is in you if you've
[1:14:54] got a spirit of Christ
[1:14:56] in you
[1:14:58] there is not something that you're
[1:15:00] trying to be a Christian
[1:15:02] it's not a task it's not a work
[1:15:05] it's a life
[1:15:09] it's a life the life of the sheep is in
[1:15:12] the Sheep amen he has the nature of the
[1:15:15] Lamb
[1:15:17] are you a man
[1:15:18] in the nature of Wrath within us the
[1:15:22] centers we wanted to do wrong we desired
[1:15:25] to do wrong but when in the Christ came
[1:15:28] in our lives we had a new nature we had
[1:15:31] to do desires we wanted to live for God
[1:15:42] but
[1:15:44] we don't want to force Christ on you
[1:15:47] either
[1:15:50] because I said I keep on saying God told
[1:15:54] me I won't lose one
[1:15:57] I'm not going to lose not one of my
[1:15:59] children
[1:16:01] not one that God
[1:16:03] but I'm gonna tell you something
[1:16:05] you can take your time
[1:16:08] amen but God won't lose one
[1:16:12] but I'm glad I came when I came
[1:16:15] because he saved me from going through a
[1:16:17] lot of things
[1:16:19] God saved my life
[1:16:21] saved my soul
[1:16:23] and he let me not go through a lot of
[1:16:25] things the other people that waited went
[1:16:29] through
[1:16:30] so I'm glad I came when I came
[1:16:32] because it saved me from a lot of things
[1:16:35] you know you I can look at my brother
[1:16:37] and I can look at this one in that one
[1:16:39] and I said God you saved me from a lot
[1:16:41] of things
[1:16:42] so I'm glad I came when I came
[1:16:45] I'm glad when he called me amen I
[1:16:47] hesitated I didn't want to come but I'm
[1:16:49] glad I came when I came
[1:16:51] I didn't want to come here I I did I
[1:16:54] didn't want to come because I had too
[1:16:56] many other plans too many things I
[1:16:59] wanted to do I didn't want to come but
[1:17:01] I'm glad I came
[1:17:03] because I see God calling others and
[1:17:06] they didn't come but they had to go
[1:17:07] through some things because they didn't
[1:17:09] come when he called them
[1:17:12] are you a man
[1:17:13] praise God we made a choice to delay
[1:17:18] we read we made it we made our own
[1:17:20] choice to wait
[1:17:21] till we get some things that we wanted
[1:17:23] to do out of the way
[1:17:25] we made our own decision I made that
[1:17:28] decision but God just didn't let me just
[1:17:30] keep on making that decision
[1:17:32] God just kept talking at my heart and
[1:17:35] then I it opened my eyes and he let me
[1:17:37] see my mama prize was really answered
[1:17:41] she said Lord open that boy eyes
[1:17:44] and you know that's what I want I want
[1:17:46] somebody else to be open this morning
[1:17:49] if you can see how dark it is out there
[1:17:51] amen how our symphony is what the devil
[1:17:54] is where he's taking you
[1:17:58] and you're trying to hold on
[1:18:00] hold on to the world a little while
[1:18:02] longer
[1:18:03] to accomplish and achieve some things
[1:18:06] that you might want to achieve
[1:18:11] but we got to come just like we are
[1:18:15] we can't hold up no longer God bless you
[1:18:18] let us know
[1:18:20] didn't get to myself this morning

[1:18:31] it's a mean world
[1:18:34] it's a wicked world
[1:18:40] it's a deceived world
[1:18:43] and this is deceived Church by the world
[1:18:52] a church to think
[1:18:54] that they're going to heaven
[1:18:57] but this is an individual Journey
[1:19:00] it's not because you go to Bright
[1:19:02] Tabernacle not because you say I'm a
[1:19:05] message believer whatever says I'm a
[1:19:07] Christian
[1:19:09] it's an individual Journey
[1:19:11] you as individuals got to make up your
[1:19:13] choice do you do you believe he love you
[1:19:17] do you believe that he knows what's best
[1:19:20] do you believe that that life is
[1:19:22] available
[1:19:24] whether or not you want it or not
[1:19:27] that God cares enough about you
[1:19:32] to understand what you go through
[1:19:37] even when you think it's too late that I
[1:19:39] made them too many mistakes to get
[1:19:43] my life together the things that I want
[1:19:49] we may be young and we desire certain
[1:19:51] things
[1:19:52] and we think that I can't find it within
[1:19:55] the Realms of the being a Christian
[1:19:57] can't find it any Christian
[1:20:02] but I look outside
[1:20:10] you can't go out there in the world
[1:20:12] and actually Define
