[39:55] that he made of clay was
[40:03] maress to make it. Then the word of the
[40:07] Lord came to me saying six, "Oh house of
[40:11] Israel, can I do with you as this
[40:14] potter? Sayith the Lord, behold, as the
[40:17] clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye
[40:20] in my hand, oh house of Israel."
[40:23] At what instance I shall speak
[40:27] concerning a nation and concerning a
[40:29] kingdom to pluck up, to pull down, and
[40:34] to destroy. Eight. If that nation
[40:37] against I have pronounced, turn from
[40:40] their evil. I will repent of the evil
[40:42] that I thought to do unto them.
[40:45] And at that and at what instance I shall
[40:49] speak concerning a nation and concerning
[40:52] a kingdom to build and to plan it. 10 if
[40:57] they do evil in my sight that I not my
[41:01] voice then I will repent of the good
[41:04] where I say I will benefit them. Now
[41:08] therefore, go to
[41:11] speak to the men of Judah and to the
[41:14] inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus
[41:17] said the Lord, behold, I frame evil
[41:21] against you, and devise a device against
[41:24] you. Return ye now everyone from his
[41:29] evil way, and make your way and your
[41:34] doings good together. And they said
[41:37] there is no hope but we will walk after
[41:40] our own devices and we will everyone do
[41:45] the imagination of his evil heart. May
[41:48] God bless you read his word. You may be
[41:51] seated. We want to
[41:53] talk let's go to Romans 9. Want to talk
[41:57] about a vessel of
[41:59] honor. A vessel of honor.
[42:03] you
[42:06] know, in talking about a vessel,
[42:10] uh, we we understand that I remember
[42:14] back in high school, we were taking clay
[42:17] and we were making vessels and we put
[42:20] them in the oven and baked them and all.
[42:23] And we made vessels and little bowls or
[42:26] dishes or whatever. And um you know I
[42:31] guess mine I don't know how it came out
[42:33] back
[42:34] then. I wasn't so artistic you know I so
[42:39] good at those things but nevertheless it
[42:43] was an
[42:44] experience and
[42:46] you you shaped it and you mold it and
[42:51] then you you baked it. Amen.
[42:54] And sometimes it takes the heat
[42:57] to harden it and make it that real
[43:01] vessel. Other than that, it's just
[43:03] clay. But when it goes through the
[43:06] fire and it comes out, you know, a
[43:11] nice a nice vessel to drink or to eat
[43:15] out or whatever. So, we thank God for
[43:18] that.
[43:19] uh Romans 9
[43:21] and14 it
[43:23] says what what should we say then is
[43:27] there unrighteousness with God
[43:30] forbid you know up above let me just try
[43:33] to give you a a a better picture of this
[43:37] let's just go to the eth verse
[43:41] um he's talking about Abraham and his
[43:44] seed and Isaac and thy seed call then he
[43:48] says that that is they which are the
[43:51] children of the flesh, these are not the
[43:53] children of God, but the children of the
[43:56] promise are counted for the seed. For
[44:00] this is the word of promise. At this
[44:03] time will I come and Sarah shall have a
[44:07] son. And not only this, but when Rebecca
[44:12] also had conceived by one, even by our
[44:17] father Isaac, for the children being not
[44:20] yet what? Born, neither have done any
[44:24] good or evil, that the purpose of God
[44:29] according to what? Election. Election
[44:31] might stand, not of works, but of him
[44:36] that what? Call it. Call it. It's not
[44:39] what you do. Amen. It's because he
[44:42] called you.
[44:44] It was said unto her, the elders shall
[44:47] what? Serve the younger. Serve this
[44:50] younger. They didn't have nothing to do
[44:51] with it. God had something to do with
[44:53] it. As it is written, Jacob have I what?
[44:57] Love. Love. But Esau have I what? Hated.
[45:00] Hated. Amen. God knows the end from the
[45:03] beginning. Right. Amen. Because God's
[45:06] full knowledge, because he knows all
[45:07] things, he knew what each and every one
[45:11] of us was going to do before we had ever
[45:13] done it. Amen. He knew every how many
[45:16] has was going to be on our head, which
[45:19] one is going to be black, which one is
[45:20] going to be white. God knows everything.
[45:23] Amen. So because he knows all things, he
[45:26] know, amen, what what you're going to be
[45:29] before you even Oh, somebody says,
[45:31] "Well, I want to be a lawyer. I want to
[45:33] be a doctor. I want to be nourished. I
[45:35] want to be this. God already knew that.
[45:39] Amen. And we just come sometime we come
[45:41] into God's purpose for our
[45:43] lives. See, cuz sometimes we have
[45:46] purpose for our life, but God might have
[45:48] another purpose. Amen. And if God has a
[45:51] purpose for your life, then God will
[45:54] bring you into your purpose. But it's
[45:56] good that you identify with the purpose
[45:58] that God Amen. what he made you for. And
[46:01] then you can flow with ease. Amen. Then
[46:04] his yoke is easy and his burden is
[46:05] light. Amen. Amen. But the way of a
[46:08] transgressor, he says what? Hard. Amen.
[46:11] So God wants to bring you into his
[46:13] purpose. Amen. So let me pick back up. I
[46:18] didn't have my hand on it.
[46:23] 14. For what shall we say then? Is there
[46:26] unrighteousness with God? God forbid.
[46:30] For he said to Moses, I would have what?
[46:34] Mercy. I would have mercy on whom I
[46:37] would have mercy. And I will have
[46:40] compassion on whom I will have what?
[46:42] Compassion. So then is not him that
[46:45] what? Will it? Will it nor him that
[46:49] runth, but what? God that shows mercy.
[46:53] And brothers and sisters, it's because
[46:55] of the mercy of God we're here. Yes.
[46:58] Without his mercy, we wouldn't even be
[47:00] sitting here this morning. Wouldn't be
[47:02] able to hear his voice. But because of
[47:05] his mercy, we're here. Amen.
[47:08] Jesus. For the scripture says unto
[47:10] Pharaoh, even for this purpose have I
[47:14] raised thee up, that I might show my
[47:17] what? Power. Power in thee, and that my
[47:21] name might be declared throughout all
[47:24] the earth.
[47:26] Therefore has he mercy on whom he will
[47:30] have mercy and on and whom he will
[47:35] he harden. Amen. Ain't that right? Amen.
[47:40] Thou will say then unto me, why do he
[47:46] yet find fault? For who has resisted the
[47:49] what? His will. His will. Amen. But nay,
[47:53] oh
[47:54] man, you know, he he he
[47:59] says, "Who art thou that replies against
[48:03] what?" God. Shall the things formed,
[48:06] sayeth to him that formed it, why hast
[48:09] thou made me
[48:11] thus? Has not the what? Father
[48:16] to make the same vessel to a lump to
[48:21] make one vessel unto
[48:24] honor and another to what?
[48:27] And we're talking this morning about a
[48:29] vessel of honor.
[48:31] And that's what uh that's what you are.
[48:33] Vessels of honor. Amen.
[48:37] But if we don't want to receive it that
[48:40] I'm speaking uh to you and declaring
[48:43] that you are vessels of honor but to
[48:47] whom can accept it and received it then
[48:51] if you don't want to receive it then
[48:53] that must he must not be talking about
[48:55] you but if you can receive it God is
[48:58] saying you are a vessel of honor.
[49:01] Amen.
[49:05] Okay, it says in the 22nd verse, what if
[49:09] God willing to show his wrath and to
[49:13] make his power known endure with much
[49:18] long suffering the vessels of wrath
[49:21] fitted for what? Destruction.
[49:25] Destruction. See, Judas was the son of
[49:27] predition.
[49:30] Esau despised his
[49:32] birthright, you know, and it's it's just
[49:35] something about the nature. God knew.
[49:38] See, God could he can write your name
[49:40] and put it on the Lamb book of life
[49:42] before the foundation of the world
[49:43] because he knew Yes. what you would go
[49:47] through and he knew that you would obey
[49:50] him. Amen. He knew that you would take
[49:53] heed to the word. God already knew all
[49:55] those things. Yes. He He didn't have to
[49:58] rethink I I put your name here, you
[50:00] know. He knew he could put your name on
[50:03] the Lamb book of life and he knew he
[50:05] could trust you. Amen. Amen.
[50:09] Thank you, Jesus. The Bible says, "No,
[50:12] you're not.
[50:14] It God has made us and not we
[50:16] ourselves." Amen. I I think sometimes
[50:20] people think they made themselves. It is
[50:22] he that has made us and not we
[50:24] ourselves. Amen.
[50:29] Amen. Now maybe I got to close
[50:32] somewhere. I think I
[50:34] stop there. I mean stop
[50:39] reading. Sometimes I stop in the middle
[50:41] of a
[50:42] sermon. That's why everybody say, "Oh,
[50:44] you going to stop?" Yeah. But uh Vis of
[50:49] Esavana. Now I was just reading
[50:52] something the prophet was saying and and
[50:54] it caused me to uh uh uh mold it.
[51:01] Mold me and make me.
[51:05] I think we ought to have that kind of
[51:07] mindset. Mold me and make me
[51:12] after thy will. Yes.
[51:15] M and make me after thy will.
[51:19] Amen. Because
[51:22] I don't want him
[51:25] to I don't want to try to put
[51:30] myself in control of God's will. And I
[51:34] think that's the the the the norm thing
[51:38] is most people
[51:41] think this is what I
[51:45] believe. I want to give my
[51:49] opinion. Let me give you my
[51:51] opinion. Let me tell you what I believe.
[51:55] You know, when you're talking to God
[51:57] like
[51:58] that, you go to work and you're on a job
[52:02] and the supervisor say, "I'd like for
[52:04] you to do uh sew and sewing and
[52:07] whatever." And you said, "Well, let me
[52:09] give you my opinion about
[52:11] it. Now, you want me to do this and
[52:14] that, but let me tell you, I I I got
[52:18] something else in my mind. the
[52:20] date. Do you address the supervisor on
[52:23] the job or the teacher, you know, who's
[52:26] instructing and do you challenge their
[52:30] instruction or do you just follow the
[52:33] instruction and the guidance of those
[52:36] that have the that that are in
[52:39] authority? You know what I'm saying? You
[52:42] know, I had opportunity. I was coming
[52:45] from I think Michigan or somewhere. I
[52:48] was going down the highway and my the
[52:50] car that I had, it wasn't an old car,
[52:53] but one thing I knew about that
[52:54] Chrysler, if he went it went over 55, it
[52:58] start shaking. I said that was a bad
[53:00] car. I was glad to get rid of it. But I
[53:03] was coming through I think Knoxville and
[53:07] cars was flying by me and the cop pulled
[53:10] me over. He said, "You was going 70 or
[53:13] something." I said, "Not in this car." I
[53:16] knew better. I I seen but the car was in
[53:19] front of me was you know flying but he
[53:22] pulled me over and tell me what I was
[53:24] doing. But you think I I'm
[53:27] knock you know I ain't got no
[53:29] complaints. Okay. You say I'm
[53:32] going 70 I knew better because of the
[53:37] car. It would it was start shaking and I
[53:41] said okay. And I knew I I wasn't
[53:43] speeding, but I couldn't question
[53:45] because he he was the one in
[53:48] authority. So even though he was wrong,
[53:51] you think I'm going stand out there in
[53:53] Knoxville and argue with
[53:56] man that I was in the right and he was
[53:58] in the wrong. No. You know, but you
[54:02] know, some people have the mindset that
[54:04] I can tell God better
[54:07] cuz I I got a better way of thinking and
[54:10] that's not the way that's not the way I
[54:13] feel about
[54:14] it. You know, I can see him now arguing
[54:18] with the man, he'll pull you over and
[54:20] you go there fussing and arguing. You
[54:21] know where you going? You're going to
[54:24] jail. You're going to jail. You in
[54:26] right, but you're going to jail.
[54:30] And when you go through the process,
[54:31] most most of the time you're going to
[54:33] lose anyway. So it's better just
[54:36] what? Just just take it easy and and
[54:40] trust God to work it out for you. Amen.
[54:42] Are you with me? Amen. So sometimes in
[54:45] life, Amen. you can be
[54:48] right, but you have to take it and be
[54:52] wrong.
[54:54] Are you with me? Amen. See, sometimes
[54:57] what people say about you, what people
[54:58] think about you and different
[55:00] terminologies, you just have to know
[55:02] that you're right. But don't make a big
[55:05] issue of
[55:06] it. Amen. Don't fuss about it. Just go
[55:09] on do what you're supposed to do and
[55:11] just sit and thank the Lord. But you
[55:14] know where you stand with God. Amen. You
[55:17] know all is well with God. Amen. And but
[55:20] if you start making issue of it, it's
[55:22] only going to make things what? He's
[55:24] just blowing the matter up and making
[55:26] things worse. But it's better, amen, to
[55:29] be right with God and say, "Father, it's
[55:32] in your hand." Amen. Amen. And that's
[55:35] where your blessings come. When men say
[55:38] persecute you, speak all manner of evil
[55:40] against you falsely. Amen. Take your
[55:42] blessings. But you don't know how to
[55:45] receive blessings. Sometimes we'll take
[55:47] matters in our own way. Okay. I'm going
[55:50] to show you something. I will show them
[55:53] something, you know. Now, don't try to
[55:56] show that you that you you know, and as
[56:00] we said in Sunday school, what the devil
[56:03] tries to do is to pull you from behind
[56:06] the veil of the word, the fortification.
[56:09] You're fortified as long as you stay
[56:11] behind the word. That's right. That's
[56:12] right. The devil throw all kind of
[56:16] little arrows and all kind of things in
[56:17] your head and in your mind, but the main
[56:20] emphasis, he trying to get you to come
[56:23] from out from behind the word. He wants
[56:26] you to get in the flesh.
[56:28] Amen. Instead of loving your brother and
[56:32] Amen, he he wants you to start having a
[56:35] little funny feeling and a little issue
[56:37] with your brother. He wants you, you
[56:39] know, I got a little issue with the
[56:40] pastor. I got a little issue with this
[56:42] one. Got a little issue with that one.
[56:44] Next thing you know, you got issues with
[56:46] everybody but yourself.
[56:48] Are you with me? Amen. But the main
[56:51] individual, you need self-control. You
[56:54] need temperance. Amen. Amen. And God is
[56:58] trying to work that in you. Amen. You
[57:00] may be in the right, but God is trying
[57:02] to work temperance.
[57:04] He's trying to give you some patience.
[57:06] Amen. Tribulation work patience. You got
[57:08] to go through some. Oh, I forgot
[57:11] patience. But I didn't mean that.
[57:13] But but tribulation work is patience.
[57:17] Amen. You have to go through some
[57:18] things, you know. A a and sometimes we
[57:22] don't want to re receive where God is
[57:25] taking us and what God is doing for us
[57:27] in our lives. We can't receive it
[57:30] because, Amen. we don't understand the
[57:33] mind of God. Yes. And we don't know the
[57:36] will of God for our lives.
[57:38] But God is molding us and he's making
[57:40] us. Amen. He's trying to give us genuine
[57:44] faith. Amen. Genuine faith, you know,
[57:48] it's not your own faith. That's right.
[57:52] Amen. Genuine faith is not your own
[57:55] faith, but it's his faith.
[57:58] I said the just shall live by his faith.
[58:01] Amen. Not yours. His genuine faith.
[58:04] something that
[58:06] uh you don't
[58:07] control but he controls it. Yes. G. Are
[58:11] you with me? Amen. You don't control it
[58:14] but he controls it. So that's the faith
[58:17] that you want to have when you sometimes
[58:19] I I want to stay in control. God don't
[58:22] want you to be in control. He wants to
[58:24] be in control. Amen. God wants to be in
[58:28] control of you. Amen. Not you in control
[58:30] of God. Amen. You don't dictate to the
[58:33] Holy Ghost, the Holy Spirit, you know
[58:36] how you know your walk. Amen. He leads,
[58:40] you follow. Are you with me? So, it's
[58:44] very important that we hone in and we
[58:47] adjust to God's will for our lives and
[58:50] and stop trying to do it on our own.
[58:53] Let's let's just look at this Isaiah uh
[58:56] 58. I thought on that and it it's so
[59:00] much Isaiah
[59:02] 58 and
[59:05] 8. I was just thinking I you know
[59:08] sometimes there scriptures that go
[59:10] through my
[59:19] mind. Excuse me. I'm at a 55 and8.
[59:26] You know, I was I was studying in and I
[59:28] was trying to find the scripture and uh
[59:31] and I can hear that little voice says 55
[59:33] and 8. And I said, "58?" Okay. Cuz you
[59:37] know, you used to you're younger, you
[59:40] you you focus on your memory. When you
[59:43] get older, you say, "Lord, now where is
[59:45] that at?" And he just says, "58."
[59:49] I said, "Thank you, Lord." You know, cuz
[59:52] I was looking and, you know, scrambling.
[59:54] I'm going here going. I said, "Well, let
[59:56] me just see." So, I took a minute and
[59:59] Lord, where's that at? And I heard the
[1:00:02] little voice 55 and 8. I said, "Thank
[1:00:04] you." You know what I'm saying?
[1:00:08] And and and is the more you can yield to
[1:00:11] God, the more God can use you to make
[1:00:14] more God can speak to you, more God can
[1:00:17] lead you. But you got to yield. He's
[1:00:18] there all the time. But you just got to
[1:00:21] ask.
[1:00:22] Sometimes we we depend on our own
[1:00:24] ability. We got to depend on his
[1:00:27] ability. Amen. We just got to ask him,
[1:00:29] Lord. You know where is that scripture
[1:00:31] at?
[1:00:33] Okay. 55 and 8. It says for he says for
[1:00:38] my
[1:00:41] thoughts. Let let me go to seventh
[1:00:43] verse. He says, "Let the wicked forsake
[1:00:47] his what? Amen. And the unrighteous man
[1:00:50] his thoughts. Amen. And let him return
[1:00:54] to the Lord. And I will have what?
[1:00:58] Mercy. I would to have mercy upon
[1:01:00] him and to our God for he will
[1:01:04] abundantly what? All right.
[1:01:08] You
[1:01:08] know, sometimes you have people they
[1:01:11] they're faithful coming to church, but
[1:01:13] when they when they get when they get to
[1:01:15] a place that they have
[1:01:20] disagreement, they don't try to work it
[1:01:22] out.
[1:01:23] Sometimes they don't disagree directly
[1:01:26] with
[1:01:27] uh with
[1:01:30] the God, but
[1:01:34] they disagree with his
[1:01:38] word. They said, "Well, you
[1:01:41] know, I have my own opinion about that.
[1:01:45] I have my own thoughts on that. I
[1:01:48] believe a little different than what you
[1:01:51] were saying. So my
[1:01:57] interpretation my
[1:02:00] interpretation I said okay see we think
[1:02:03] that we got a
[1:02:04] right to interpret God's word according
[1:02:08] to our own feeling our own
[1:02:12] opinion but the Bible says no prophecy
[1:02:15] of the scripture is of any private
[1:02:17] interpretation this ain't a private
[1:02:20] thing are you with
[1:02:23] So when it comes down to the word of
[1:02:25] God, Amen. what he says, you got to take
[1:02:29] it just just like he said it. Amen.
[1:02:32] Amen. No
[1:02:34] opinion. And see, can you you know if
[1:02:37] you if you're in authority or supervisor
[1:02:39] position and and and people, you know,
[1:02:42] you tell individual, I want you to do it
[1:02:44] this way, and they say, well, I got a
[1:02:47] better way of doing it. And they do it
[1:02:50] their way. and you come back and tell
[1:02:51] him, "I I told you to do it this way. I
[1:02:54] got a better way."
[1:02:57] Okay, you take my place. You be the
[1:02:59] supervisor. Let me be the father. You
[1:03:02] know what I'm saying? And that's the way
[1:03:03] people handle God. You find that the
[1:03:05] people have the attitude in the church
[1:03:07] and attitude with the word. You find
[1:03:09] they got that same attitude in life.
[1:03:12] They take it on their job, they take it
[1:03:13] in school or wherever they are, they
[1:03:15] still got an
[1:03:17] attitude. You think, "Oh, they only do
[1:03:20] the pastor like that, only do the
[1:03:22] ministry like that, only do you know the
[1:03:24] word like." No, that's the that's their
[1:03:26] life attitude. And you find that person
[1:03:29] might be from job to job, situation to
[1:03:33] situation, church to church and all of
[1:03:36] that because
[1:03:38] why? They think everybody else is wrong
[1:03:41] in their
[1:03:42] life. You know, the Bible says he
[1:03:45] thinkketh in his heart, so is he. Amen.
[1:03:47] Amen. It's got to be some type of
[1:03:50] acquiring down and seeking. You know,
[1:03:53] one time I I looked and I was seeking
[1:03:55] for truth, seeking for direction and
[1:03:58] guidance. But when I found it, that was
[1:04:01] no more. I I wasn't seeking no more. You
[1:04:03] know what I'm saying? It's all over. I I
[1:04:06] mean, I found just what I was looking
[1:04:08] for. Thank God, brother. You're seeking
[1:04:10] for a wife, patient, desirable. I got
[1:04:13] one. Congratulations.
[1:04:15] Amen. Thank the
[1:04:18] Lord. And that's all
[1:04:21] right. And that's good. Ain't that
[1:04:23] right? But when you
[1:04:25] find, you know, that which you're
[1:04:27] seeking for, it gives you, you know, you
[1:04:30] know, purpose. It settle you down. So
[1:04:33] when you look for truth and you're
[1:04:34] searching for truth and you find the
[1:04:36] truth. Jesus said, "I'm the way, the
[1:04:38] truth, and the life." Amen. It's no
[1:04:39] church is the truth. Amen. Amen. No
[1:04:42] preacher is the truth, but Jesus Christ
[1:04:45] is the way, the truth, and the life.
[1:04:47] Find Jesus, and you'll settle. Amen.
[1:04:50] Praise God. Find the one. Don't fall in
[1:04:53] love with the church. Don't fall in love
[1:04:54] with the preacher, but fall in love with
[1:04:56] Jesus. For he is the word. Amen.
[1:05:00] Are you with me? Amen. Amen. It's very
[1:05:03] important that you fall in love with the
[1:05:05] word of God, not see because you you'll
[1:05:08] be in and out and
[1:05:12] You be puzzled, confused, because you're
[1:05:15] looking for something that's going to
[1:05:17] satisfy you. But Lord, I I'm not looking
[1:05:20] for something that's going but it's a
[1:05:21] thirst. It's a hunger. It's a thirst.
[1:05:23] It's a deep calling to the deep. It's a
[1:05:25] thirst in my life that I I know it can
[1:05:28] be quenched. But when I get to that
[1:05:31] water of life, Amen. The woman that the
[1:05:34] well, she didn't thirst no more. Amen.
[1:05:36] Amen. When you get Jesus, Amen. Praise
[1:05:39] God. He'll quench your thirst. Amen.
[1:05:41] It'll be all over with. Thank you, Lord.
[1:05:44] Hallelujah. Hey, God. I got to that
[1:05:47] place. Something has happened. Amen.
[1:05:50] Hallelujah. I have an absolute now.
[1:05:53] Amen. I have a top post now. I can Amen.
[1:05:56] I can trust. Amen. I'm not seeking no
[1:05:59] more. I found. Amen. That's what my
[1:06:02] heart longest for. Amen. And it was
[1:06:04] Jesus Christ. Amen. It wasn't in the
[1:06:06] nightclub and it wasn't in the ball
[1:06:08] game. It wasn't here and there, but it's
[1:06:10] in Jesus.
[1:06:12] I find a resting place. Amen. I find the
[1:06:14] peace that I needed, the joy that I
[1:06:17] everything I needed was in him.
[1:06:20] Hallelujah. I didn't all all together
[1:06:23] find it. He He found me. Jesus.
[1:06:28] Okay. And the Bible says when we find
[1:06:31] him, he would abundantly pardon.
[1:06:35] Amen.
[1:06:37] For he says, "For my thoughts are not
[1:06:39] your what?" "And neither are your ways."
[1:06:44] What? My ways,
[1:06:46] said the Lord. That's not the way I
[1:06:49] believe
[1:06:51] it.
[1:06:53] Some arrogant people.
[1:06:57] I don't know what I
[1:06:59] ever ever thought like that. If I did,
[1:07:03] God forgive me.
[1:07:06] I wasn't so such of a
[1:07:09] confident, you know, somebody with all
[1:07:11] that confident. I was always a little
[1:07:14] slow, you know. I wasn't all that about
[1:07:17] all of that confident thinking you this
[1:07:19] and that. Maybe in sports.
[1:07:23] Yeah. You know, in sports, I thought I
[1:07:28] was the fastest. Thought I was this and
[1:07:30] that. So I, you know, some of us got
[1:07:33] some areas that we feel confident in,
[1:07:36] you know, but when it comes down to
[1:07:37] intelligence and, you know, so smart and
[1:07:40] all that. No, I didn't have no
[1:07:42] confidence there, you know. I never
[1:07:44] thought I was intelligent. Never thought
[1:07:45] I was so smart. So So I I didn't have
[1:07:48] trouble with, you know, listening and
[1:07:51] following the instruction because I
[1:07:53] didn't think I was all of this and all
[1:07:55] of that. But you know, but some folks
[1:07:58] are arrogant because they know they're
[1:08:00] intelligent, they know they're smart,
[1:08:02] they know they this and that. But not
[1:08:04] me. I was say I wasn't about that. So,
[1:08:09] but those type people is hard because
[1:08:12] they they they're very
[1:08:14] opinionated. They they trust in their
[1:08:17] own intelligence. They always trying to
[1:08:19] reason and figure things out.
[1:08:23] But when you come to God, you got to
[1:08:25] take him by what? Faith. Faith. When it
[1:08:28] come down to God, you got to have faith
[1:08:29] in what he says.
[1:08:32] So it takes faith just to trust God and
[1:08:34] believe God and just walk by faith. You
[1:08:36] don't see it. You don't understand it.
[1:08:38] But one thing about it, it's the word of
[1:08:39] God and I believe it. Amen. It's God's
[1:08:41] word. I'm I'm following God by faith.
[1:08:44] Amen. And if I follow him by faith, I'll
[1:08:46] see. Amen. Amen. But if I try to see
[1:08:49] before I believe, Amen. And he said,
[1:08:51] "Blessed is him that have not seen, but
[1:08:53] yet what?" Believe. So, amen. We trust
[1:08:56] in God. He that cometh to God must first
[1:08:59] of all believe that he is and that he's
[1:09:00] a reweller. He He's a rewarder of them
[1:09:03] that what? Diligent. Seek him. Amen. You
[1:09:06] got to seek him. Amen. If you seek him,
[1:09:09] he you'll be found. Amen. Are you with
[1:09:11] me? Amen. But here, oh, Lord have
[1:09:15] mercy. God is good. Amen. You love him
[1:09:19] today. Amen. I love the Lord.
[1:09:22] Amen. You say, "For your thoughts are
[1:09:25] not my thoughts." You know, sometimes I
[1:09:29] look at people and and they're telling
[1:09:32] me their opinion and their thoughts. And
[1:09:34] sometimes I've had groups to leave the
[1:09:36] church just leave because they got one
[1:09:39] opinionated person. One small I
[1:09:42] intelligent person lead you know the
[1:09:44] whole flock. I'm going cuz we got
[1:09:49] one person that's so smart. They know
[1:09:52] more than the preaching. They know more
[1:09:54] than God and all that. And people just
[1:09:56] walk out because you got
[1:09:59] one smart
[1:10:01] duck. You know what I'm saying? And they
[1:10:04] know more than
[1:10:05] everybody. And you know
[1:10:08] sometimes if God did not ordain them to
[1:10:11] take you to
[1:10:13] Florida and you follow the wrong one,
[1:10:15] you might be in
[1:10:18] Alaska and all the flock dies in Alaska
[1:10:22] because they listen to that one duck
[1:10:24] that God did not divinely call to lead
[1:10:28] them out of the cold winter and to lead
[1:10:31] them down to Florida where it was hot
[1:10:34] where they can live. You see what I'm
[1:10:35] saying? So it's very important
[1:10:38] that that God gives you the hear ear to
[1:10:43] hear the right voice. Amen. Are you with
[1:10:46] me? Because if God does not give you the
[1:10:48] ear to hear the right voice, you'll
[1:10:51] listen to the wrong one. And they'll
[1:10:53] lead you into what? That the blind lead
[1:10:56] the blind.
[1:10:59] Ain't that right? So you got to be uh uh
[1:11:02] conscious and aware. Holy Spirit, lead
[1:11:06] me. Amen. Holy Ghost, guide me. Amen.
[1:11:09] God, you be in control of this cuz I'll
[1:11:13] make a mess and I
[1:11:15] You know, even if it's against my will,
[1:11:18] I want what? I want your will to be
[1:11:20] done. Amen. I'm I I'm looking to follow
[1:11:23] him. I don't want to get myself in the
[1:11:26] way. Amen. It's not what I accept. It's
[1:11:29] what God wants for me. Amen. I want to
[1:11:31] accept God's will for my life. That's
[1:11:35] what I want. I don't want I don't want
[1:11:37] to be all mixed up and hanging up just
[1:11:39] following cuz oo I like the way this
[1:11:42] just Oh, I like the way the preacher
[1:11:44] look. Oh, I like the way the church
[1:11:46] look. No, I want God. I want his word.
[1:11:50] The word means everything to me. Oh, you
[1:11:53] with me? Amen. I want I want I want
[1:11:55] Jesus to speak to my heart. I want Jesus
[1:11:57] to lead me. I want him to guide me. I'm
[1:12:00] trusting him to do it because I'll make
[1:12:02] a mess of myself. But if he if he leads
[1:12:06] me, I'll follow.
[1:12:12] I I made so many decisions that was bad
[1:12:15] decisions in
[1:12:17] life and you get tired of making wrong
[1:12:20] decisions.
[1:12:21] Now you got to a point where God, you
[1:12:23] take it easy, slow and easy and
[1:12:26] relaxing, trusting the Lord because I
[1:12:29] made decisions and it wasn't all it
[1:12:32] wasn't God fault. A lot of times it was
[1:12:35] my fault. Amen. Because I sometimes that
[1:12:38] little small still voice said, "No, no,
[1:12:41] no." And sometimes we just we just so
[1:12:45] caught up in doing doing that we don't
[1:12:47] even hear
[1:12:49] God. You know, David wanted to go get
[1:12:52] the ark of God,
[1:12:53] right? And trying to do God a service
[1:12:56] without it being his will. So, it was a
[1:12:58] good thing that he desired to bring the
[1:13:00] ark back. Amen. To his rightful place.
[1:13:04] And he went to get it. But what they did
[1:13:07] was they brought it back on the arch
[1:13:09] cart. It was the ark. And they started
[1:13:12] shouting and dancing cuz the ark of the
[1:13:14] Lord was coming back in the camp.
[1:13:17] It's good to be happy,
[1:13:21] but they got to a place
[1:13:24] and to a little rough place and it
[1:13:27] looked like the art was going to
[1:13:30] fall. The servant put his hand to it to
[1:13:32] try to keep it from
[1:13:34] falling and it died cuz he put his hand
[1:13:39] and and they had to stop the their
[1:13:42] revival. The revival's over.
[1:13:44] Stop. Why? Because somebody done died
[1:13:48] put now let's just paused this on our
[1:13:51] journey back bringing the word back to
[1:13:53] us okay everything is paused cut off
[1:13:57] why amen because we're trying to do God
[1:14:01] a service that is we we're bringing it
[1:14:04] back on oxc cut failure to consult the
[1:14:07] Lord
[1:14:09] we cons if we were to consult the Lord
[1:14:11] that would have never happened that's
[1:14:13] right are you with me so we want to do
[1:14:16] it because it's the right thing to do.
[1:14:17] But we need to consult God on our
[1:14:20] decisions. Amen. Amen. Because if we
[1:14:24] don't consult the Lord, the Lord would
[1:14:26] have told him the ark is be carried on
[1:14:30] the shoulder.
[1:14:32] Amen. So you supposed to to it on men's
[1:14:36] shoulders. You can't get around to
[1:14:38] bearing your cross. But Jesus bear the
[1:14:41] cross alone and the whole world go free.
[1:14:44] That's right. Amen. You want somebody
[1:14:46] else to carry your cross, the oxen to do
[1:14:49] it. Amen. But you got to carry it. You
[1:14:51] got to identify with your sacrifice. You
[1:14:54] got to put that cross on your shoulder
[1:14:55] and you got to carry it. Amen. Amen. It
[1:14:59] might be a little heavy, but carry it.
[1:15:01] Amen. Because that's the way God wants
[1:15:03] you. The word. Amen. Amen. It's got to
[1:15:05] it's got to be personal. You got to have
[1:15:07] contact with him. Amen. Amen. It's you
[1:15:10] and God. Amen. Okay.
[1:15:15] I got to
[1:15:17] close. Taking too much time to get where
[1:15:19] I'm
[1:15:21] going. A vessel of
[1:15:23] honor. What makes you and I a vessel of
[1:15:27] honor? Amen.
[1:15:31] So Jeremiah was shaping the vessel and
[1:15:36] it was in the hands of the Lord and he
[1:15:39] was making it and and it was
[1:15:43] because God was saying I I'm I'mma
[1:15:48] let I I'm going to do you. In other
[1:15:51] words, I'm I'mma bless you and prosper
[1:15:55] you and everything, but if you're doing
[1:15:58] evil,
[1:15:59] Amen.
[1:16:01] No, I'm I I I'mma devise evil to come
[1:16:06] upon you.
[1:16:08] I I can't bless you now. So God knew,
[1:16:12] Amen. from from the offset before the
[1:16:15] children ever was born, the kind of
[1:16:18] attitude Esau despise his birthright.
[1:16:20] what he was going to do. God already
[1:16:22] knew that. So, and sometimes as much as
[1:16:27] we love one another as much as we love
[1:16:29] family members, as much as we love all
[1:16:31] the I mean, sometimes, you know, we try
[1:16:35] all we can, we on our knees fasting and
[1:16:37] praying and we desire that they see the
[1:16:40] light and that they come to Jesus
[1:16:42] Christ. But some of them just they have
[1:16:44] an attitude, I don't I don't see it.
[1:16:48] They don't seem to understand that your
[1:16:50] blessings and your inheritance is in
[1:16:53] Christ. And God will bless you with all
[1:16:55] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[1:16:57] in Christ Jesus if you only allow him to
[1:17:00] have control of your life. Amen. Amen.
[1:17:06] Mold me Lord.
[1:17:08] Make me.
[1:17:12] You know sometimes we wonder why all the
[1:17:14] problems, all the complication. If God
[1:17:16] is a God of love, why is the walls? And
[1:17:19] why did God let this people be hungry?
[1:17:21] Why did God do this and why did God do
[1:17:24] that? You know what? I'm thanking God
[1:17:26] for having food to eat. Amen. Having a
[1:17:30] place to stay,
[1:17:32] instead of uh uh complaining, thank God
[1:17:35] for what he's given you.
[1:17:37] And all the other stuff we understanding
[1:17:39] better by and by, but I got something to
[1:17:42] thank God for. Amen. I got something to
[1:17:45] praise him for. I got to let the Lord in
[1:17:48] the Lord you're good. You're good to me
[1:17:50] anyhow.
[1:17:52] I I don't deserve your goodness and I
[1:17:54] don't deserve your blessing, but thank
[1:17:55] you for being so good. I know you're
[1:17:58] real, Lord.
[1:18:01] Hallelujah. So that that's what it's all
[1:18:03] about. Instead of thanking God, I don't
[1:18:05] know why this why. Thank God that you
[1:18:08] got feet. Thank God you got a right mind
[1:18:10] you can think. Amen. Instead of
[1:18:13] complaining, thank him. Amen. Lord, I
[1:18:16] love you. Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[1:18:20] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:18:22] Jesus.
[1:18:26] [Music]
[1:18:34] I made it this far. Amen.
[1:18:40] I made it this far.
[1:18:43] I told Caleb to be
[1:18:46] ready, but thank God I made it this far.
[1:18:57] Brother Ernest prayed for me and
[1:18:59] different ones. I said, "But I made it
[1:19:02] this far.
[1:19:08] I don't think nothing lingered this
[1:19:10] long, but I thank
[1:19:13] God. I feel good though.
[1:19:20] Amen. That's why I was thinking it get
[1:19:23] excited and
[1:19:25] emotional. Can't have it. That's a part
[1:19:28] of me.
[1:19:30] I was trying to teach but I'm so used to
[1:19:35] preaching but by the grace of God as I
[1:19:38] come to the
[1:19:40] conclusion and pastor of honor I go back
[1:19:42] to Romans
[1:19:44] nine I won't go back to
[1:19:48] Jeremiah maybe I can pick it up another
[1:19:51] time but by the grace of God it's very
[1:19:56] important that you recognize
[1:20:00] What? God made you a vessel of
[1:20:11] mine. As if Caleb was always whipping. I
[1:20:15] can let
[1:20:20] him. Sometimes you got to be able to
[1:20:22] catch
[1:20:25] it. re naked preach, she'll catch
[1:20:32] me, but she can't get up here and take
[1:20:37] over. Maybe kiss you or somebody and
[1:20:40] they can catch it and finish it
[1:20:43] off. But I got to try to do the best I
[1:20:46] can. God is good. Amen. Amen.
[1:20:54] Again, he looking at me like he going to
[1:20:55] catch it.
[1:20:58] God is good. I ain't going to put that
[1:21:00] pressure on him.
[1:21:04] Amen. A vessel of honor. What verse I'm
[1:21:07] looking
[1:21:08] for? Vessel of
[1:21:12] honor.
[1:21:14] Huh?
[1:21:22] 11. I want to go right to the
[1:21:27] verse 21.
[1:21:34] Okay. Okay. He said, "Has not the power
[1:21:37] of power over the
[1:21:39] clay of the same
[1:21:49] lump. to make one vessel to honor and
[1:21:53] another to what?
[1:21:56] So don't tell. You know what I'm saying?
[1:21:59] All those people that you hear
[1:22:00] complaining about God, complaining about
[1:22:02] this and complaining about
[1:22:05] that, all their complaints, all their
[1:22:08] thoughts and all their ideas about it,
[1:22:11] why they don't serve God, why they don't
[1:22:13] believe in God, why

[1:22:19] for that. You can trust him. You can
[1:22:22] believe him. And you can't explain to
[1:22:25] them why why you love God, why you thank
[1:22:29] God, and why God is good. You can't
[1:22:32] explain to them. You can't answer their
[1:22:34] questions, but just know that God has
[1:22:37] chosen you to be a vessel of honor.
[1:22:41] And God has blessed you to be in a
[1:22:45] family and a home that you can be guided
[1:22:49] in the right direction and that you can

[1:23:16] need to
[1:23:17] be, but you say, "God, I'm not where I
[1:23:20] need to be, but you know where I want to
[1:23:23] be. So I want you to help me Lord
[1:23:27] because you made me a vessel of honor
[1:23:30] and I want to walk in your pleasing and
[1:23:33] I want to be accepted in your sight.
[1:23:38] So by the grace of God, you put that in
[1:23:41] his forefront and you tell God that and
[1:23:44] you have something to be looking forward

[1:23:49] right now, but I want it all to be just
[1:23:52] right. Oh yes, I desire and I know you
[1:23:55] know how to fix me. Amen. Because I'm
[1:23:58] asking for your help and I'm asking for

[1:24:08] But I'm a vessel of honor. Amen. And and

[1:24:34] life. Everything the arrow the devil can
[1:24:37] shoot against me. And one thing I will
[1:24:41] be confident, one thing have I desired
[1:24:44] of the Lord, that will I seek after,
[1:24:47] that I may behold the beauty of the
[1:24:49] Lord, and acquire his temple. For in
[1:24:54] the time of trouble, he shall hide me
[1:24:58] and his prevailing.
[1:25:00] In the secrets of his tabernacle, he
[1:25:02] shall hide me. He said, "Set my head up
[1:25:05] up upon a rock, and I should be lifted
[1:25:07] up above my enemies round about me. For
[1:25:10] the Lord is my light and my
[1:25:14] salvation. Whom shall I fear?" The Lord
[1:25:17] is the strength of my life. Of whom
[1:25:20] shall I be afraid? Amen. Amen. When the
[1:25:23] wicked, even my enemies and my foes that

[1:26:15] Amen. I don't want to control my life. I
[1:26:18] want God to control it.

[1:26:28] align with our
[1:26:32] thoughts. We want God to
[1:26:34] agree with
[1:26:37] us. God might disagree with
[1:26:39] you and God might not line up the way
[1:26:43] you want him to line up.

[1:27:31] narrow. Amen. All the stuff that the
[1:27:34] world has to offer. Amen. But it leads
[1:27:38] to
[1:27:40] life. And that's what you ought to
[1:27:42] desire. I I desire life. I draw thy

[1:29:12] because I hadn't come into fullness of
[1:29:15] your purpose for my life. Keep spinning
[1:29:18] the wheel. Thank you for all the hands,
