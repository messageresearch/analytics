I got a feeling. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything going to be all right. Amen. Let us bow our heads in a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we just thank you tonight for your grace and your mercy. Oh God, thank you for making everything all right. Oh God, for clearing our pathway, &gt;&gt; oh Jesus, Lord, we thank you tonight, Lord, as we, oh God, come before your throne of grace, Lord. And oh God, we ask, oh God, that you continue granting mercy, Lord, to those that were in the storm's way, God. And think about our friends over in Jamaica, Lord, and brothers and sisters in Christ. Lord, I just pray, God, that you'd make ways for them. And oh God, so many that were affected, Lord. And oh God, we just thank you, Lord, tonight. Lord, we pray, oh God, by your grace, Lord, that you would speak to our hearts tonight, Lord, and that you would meet the needs of your children, Lord, if we said or did anything that ain't like you and if it would hinder the move of God. I just pray God that you would oh God forgive us tonight oh Lord and help us to get out the way Lord that your spirit might have the preeminence Lord that you would touch bodies Lord those that are battling with sicknesses God and but Lord we know that they're only demon powers Lord but you're still here oh God Lord to to bring about change we thank you Lord tonight bless your children oh God we pray move in a mighty way bless those that are here those that had a desire to come but couldn't make it. Pray God you would strengthen them somehow. In [music] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. God is good. Amen. We want to look at the book of Hebrews by the grace of God. Hebrews 3. Very familiar scripture. Amen. Tell we was looking at that that storm that come over and hit those islands. It looked to be pretty bad. So that one storm covered it looked the storm was so big it covered the whole island of Jamaica. I said Lord knows. I was praying. I says I pray that God had mercy on all the saints of God over there. Amen. But we know we living in the end time. Amen. So glad that we got a hiding place though. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrews 3 by the grace of God. Hebrews 3 and 7. Very familiar. If you got it, say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it reads, "Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, today if you if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts as in provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness, when your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works 40 years. Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, they do always er in their way in their heart, and they have not known my ways." So I swear in my wrath they should not enter into my rest. Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God. But exhort one another daily while it is called today, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. For we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast until the end. May God bless you to read of his word. You may be seated tonight. You know, tonight by the grace of God for a moment, I just want to to talk to you about departing from the living God. Amen. Departing from the living God. You know how like how here it says you know in the scriptures he's saying wherefore wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith today if you will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the day of temptation in the wilderness wherein your fathers tempted me and prove me not only did they prove him but they saw his works. Amen. But he says the day that you hear his voice don't harden your hearts. Right? You know, we find that, you know, I said throughout all the all the scriptures, you know, we find that that God does things to show himself alive and isn't uh long before people depart from the living God. Amen. Something about the for some reason the attraction that people they don't they feel comfortable serving a God that ain't living. Amen. Not necessarily that they're calling on a different God, but you know, he doesn't just to uh uh be intellectual. That isn't that isn't the living God. Amen. Because we know that the scripture said the letter will kill you, but it's the spirit, right, that gives life. But we find that, you know, many of times people get caught up in the we say the intellectualism or the or thing, but it's the it's the spirit that gives life. Amen. And that's what you know I was thinking I says a lot of times people when they when they just uh uh intellectual or or they just smart you know in that way then many of times they think that they can take the word and just handle it any kind of way they want right or that makes them qualified to be a a teacher or a leader or everybody becomes super spiritual right but the thing is is that you know God reveals his secrets in the word we know his word the word come to the prophets but you know it God God gives the gifts out to men right men don't you can't give a gift for yourself God's got to give you that gift right &gt;&gt; and many of times people cover covered those things because they want to be the person of the hour want to be the one that God use right but like I said the thing about it is is God's got to be be the one give you that gift right other than that you going to make a shipwreck of people lives us. How many believe that tonight? You'll take the word intellectually and mix it and make it and the devil will make everything sound good, right? But no matter how good it sounds like it says when you had to come before the urine thrum, no matter how real that dream sounded, no matter how real and and logical it might seem, but the supernatural had to flash across it, right, to prove that it was from God. How many believe that tonight? And that's what I always I've been saying here recently, you know, doing a lot of uh witnessing and you know at work and stuff and talking. I says one thing about it, everybody claims that they have the truth, right? That they have the the the truth and God is with them. I says, but I know one thing that I'm confident of is that God will back his word up, right? Whatever is the truth, God will back it up. No matter how good it looks or how good it sounds, God will back his word up. How many believe that tonight? You know, I was thinking I says one thing about it, you know, God God uh he he comes and and he'll do supernatural things, right? To show you that he's alive and well and he'll show you the way. But it what happens is many of times people even in that they still want to follow their own guidelines, right? Still want to follow their own rules, right? And think that, you know, uh uh God will just accept it. But you know, I thought about the a Cain and Abel and how when they were making their sacrifices, right? The thing about it is God, he came down and he confirmed which sacrifice that he loved, right? Which one was right? But even though he confirmed it and he even spoke to Cain and says, "Why you why you mad?" You know, he says, "If you do like your brother doing, come on, cuz that's the way that's what I'm accepting. You do what he doing." He says, "And I'll accept you." But Cain didn't want to do what God was accepting, did he? He wanted to do his own way. And we find that that what it is. It's a spirit, ain't it? You know, I thought about that, you know, when when I've been ministering on here lately about the awakening and how, you know, Moses uh uh God sent Moses down to deliver the to bring the children out of Israel, even though he was the one doing the delivering, but you had so many voices, right? So many voices am in the among in the camp amongst the people, right? I says, "But where were those voices when they were bound in Egypt? Come on. Where were those voices when they when Pharaoh had them bound? Right. But then now now when God brought them out, God did mighty works, great works and things among them. And now they get out there and they think that they was just going to be able to manhandle Moses, do what they want now. Right? Those voices rose up, didn't they? Come on. And they thought that we know the way we don't need uh uh uh Moses in that particular uh sense like that. But what it was, the one thing they didn't understand is that God is the one who set men up. Right? &gt;&gt; God is the one. And most of the time, the one that God choose, he never wanted to go from the beginning, right? &gt;&gt; He might just want to be a regular old common person, but nevertheless, like I say, it's God that chooses, right? And that's what blinds the people so many of times because of one thing. People got uh motives and objectives, right? They got ambitions and goals. But one of the things coming to Christ is that you have to learn to lay down all of what you all of your ambitions, all of your goals, right? &gt;&gt; I often say it's all right to have things that you want to achieve and all that. I says, but when you when you when one of the things come to Christ, even I had to realize that God, I I got certain things I desire, but Lord, don't let my desires take me outside of your will. Nevertheless, change my will. change my desires that they'll meet up to yours, God. Hallelujah. Because that's what it's all about. How many believe that tonight? Come on. But God does a a lot of things and and he shows himself like we says uh many of times, you know, uh uh uh uh uh what the he shows himself alive and well, but it ain't long for the people depart from him. You know, I says I says, you know, one thing about Satan, he don't mind he don't mind you quoting the Bible. He don't mind you quoting the the message or service, things like that. He don't mind you quoting to say any good things. But what he's keep what he wants you to stay away from is the life of it. &gt;&gt; Come on. How many believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; He says here in the scriptures, as the Holy Ghost says, see people don't want the Holy Ghost to lead them. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he he's a judge now, ain't he? But one thing about it, he want to keep you away from the life of it. But we know that I says I don't know about you, but I don't just want just to give me the letter that I can quote and do all these things, but I want the life of it. &gt;&gt; Come on. I want that when I'm when I speak or when I open my mouth that God will back it up. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; With signs and wonders following. That's what it is. He's not a dead God, but he's a living God, ain't he? &gt;&gt; Come on. When when Christ died and and went on, he be to tell them, "I want you to go and tarry and wait till you be endured with power from on high. I don't want you to slip back. Now, God is living, but I don't want you to slip back into day to worship, but I want you to continue on in the living God. Right? &gt;&gt; And that's why on the day of Pentecost, when Peter and those got up and begin to speak with tongues and do all kind of things in the in the in the uh in the name of Christ after the Holy Ghost fell, they begin to look at them certain way. They says, come on. They said, "These men ain't he said these men ain't drunk as ye supposed, but this is that." Come on. You know that scriptures y'all been reading? You know that. But this is the life of it. This is the very living. This is this is the life of what you've been reading. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. And that's what I say is what it is. God God spoke words, right? And God, he is a living God, ain't he? I believe how uh David says that my soul, he said uh uh uh panth for the living God, right? As the heart panth for the water, soul does my soul. It thirst for the living God. For the God, he said the living God. He had to make that uh uh uh very well known that not just for God now, but the living God, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. I said that's how you you ought to feel tonight. That's how I feel. God, I want the living God, right? &gt;&gt; Not just don't just give me anything, but God, I want to Why? Why do I want a living God? You see the struggles and the and the things that's coming on earth today. &gt;&gt; You see the trials and the tribulation. You see the storm after storm. Amen. &gt;&gt; I heard the other day an earthquake hit over in Oregon or somewhere like that. Big earthquake under the water on the news, right? You you see the thing that's coming, you going to need more than just, oh, quote this, quote that, say this, say that scripture like that. But you going to need the life of it, right? &gt;&gt; You going to need the life of it cuz when that storm come, hallelujah. He says that one thing about it, what people don't realize is that Jesus is not no more that he he's saying why you marveling. He says that if you can have faith, right? &gt;&gt; He says then all things are possible, right? &gt;&gt; It'll do as you say. What it is? He wants to put the word in your mouth, right? &gt;&gt; That you can speak and it'll be as you say. But people struggle with that, right? They struggle with that. But one thing about it, the Holy Ghost don't want you to struggle with that, right? He just want you to let go and let him have his way in your life. That it ain't you, but it's him speaking, ain't it? Come on. on that when the storm come, you'll be able to stand up and call peace to the storm, &gt;&gt; peace to the trial, right? Hallelujah. How many believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; But I says one thing about it. Come on. Departing. You know that they they departed from the living God. And that's what uh uh uh he's here speaking about tonight, right? He says what what caused them uh uh to depart from the living God was unbelief. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; Come on. In them they had a evil heart. The Bible says unbelief, right? He said they that they they they saw my works, right? It wasn't that they never saw the power, they saw the power, right? &gt;&gt; Wasn't that they never heard the voice, they heard the voice. They saw the power. But somewhere in the in the in the journey, they departed from the living God. Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Not that they didn't hear, they didn't see, but they saw, they heard, but they departed. Come on. I says what it is. Sometimes we get so comfortable, right? Because God has took the the the great look like the greatest thing that was bothering you. He looked like he moved it out the way. So you get comfortable, right? Thinking that now maybe we don't need God. But I want to tell you, you need God every day. &gt;&gt; Come on. You need God every hour. Just cuz the storm looked like it let up. Don't think you don't need God. &gt;&gt; Cuz tomorrow might your foot slip. Hallelujah. You'll find out then I need him every day. &gt;&gt; Come on. Because what the enemy is seeking whom he may devour, right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I was telling somebody the other day, I say it's one thing about the devil. He don't care about neither side. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The devil working on every side, ain't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. The devil don't care about he he he get you. He gets your family. The devil, what his thing? Divide and the devil don't care about neither side, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. Don't think that just you the devil just fighting them, but he ain't fighting you. Come on. then he already got you. The devil, he don't care about neither side, does he? &gt;&gt; But one thing about the love of God, it it it covers all. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. But we find that I says, you know, come on, they departing from the living God. What it is? What it is? Uh uh I says, you know, people can think that they with God but not necessarily be with God. Y'all believe that tonight? People can think they right where they need to be, but then God shows up and show them that you ain't nowhere near where you need to be at. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. I I I believe uh Paul, he might have thought that he was somebody, but then when he met that light, hallelujah, and it knocked him down, it showed him where he was at. He was fighting against the very thing that he thought that he was standing for. Right? &gt;&gt; Come on. But the light showed him, didn't it? Knocked him down, blind him, right? Hallelujah. brought about a humility in his life. And that's what I believe that the Holy Spirit has to do today. Come on, knock some of us down, right? Back to the place of that humility, right? &gt;&gt; The way we understand that it's God that gives us strength. &gt;&gt; It's God that set up. It ain't me, but it's the Lord. God know how to do that, don't he? &gt;&gt; But I says, God, I I pray you don't have to do that to me. I pray that I'll be able to walk all the time in humility. &gt;&gt; Oh, lest I forget. Yes, enemy. Hallelujah. Lest I forget. Hallelujah. The way that God made for me, this blood, his agony. I said, Lord, lead me to Calvary. Hallelujah. Take me back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. Somebody need to go back. &gt;&gt; The way they first believe. Hallelujah. When you first believe, you were in a place the way you didn't know whether you was going to make it tomorrow. Right? Come on. It's a simple thing. out of all that God was doing for them, the reason why they they they perished or they departed from the living God was because of unbelief. &gt;&gt; Out of all of the miracles and the things, they they they lacked one thing. They couldn't uh uh uh they never learned how to grasp what simple faith was. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. out of all the things they lack, they couldn't grasp what simple faith was, right? They couldn't grasp how to take just what God said and just believe him just what he said. You know, when they got to the land, you know, and now it looks like they going to get ready to go over those spies come back and they all, oh, we can't do it. We grasshoppers. Then they begin to be mad with Moses, right? One of the things is I was I was looking at I says one one of the thing about the people they couldn't never get Moses out of their minds could they out of all the signs and the wonders and the things that God was doing through Moses but the thing about it was I don't believe Moses never pointed nobody to himself right but he was trying to get your faith to know that hey God is with you hallelujah &gt;&gt; and God is among you right &gt;&gt; and he'll fight against those that fight against you. He'll be an enemy to those that be an enemy to you. God loves you. You are his people. Right? Whatever you ask him for, ask him. Prove him. He'll give it to you. &gt;&gt; But it was all [screaming] leading you up to where you come to that place to where you say, "God, I believe you can do anything." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I believe that all things are possible. &gt;&gt; But they couldn't get them out of their minds. That's why every time something went wrong, they went to blaming him and getting upset and mad with him. Right? But you had two, I believe. Hallelujah. That the Bible says they were of a different spirit. Right? &gt;&gt; Come on. They had, even though they were in the in the camp, they had another spirit, didn't they? &gt;&gt; What spirit did they have? They had the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Come on. They they was something and they were seeing, they was hearing, but it [screaming] went beyond what Moses was showing, right, or doing, but it went on to see the God that was back in Moses. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. Hallelujah. I like how God told Joshua, he said, "Moses, my servant is dead now." Right? He says, "But as I was was with Moses, so shall I be with thee." Right? &gt;&gt; Come on. I'll be with you. Signs and wonders, powers [screaming] through all the mistake, I'll be with you. But I want you to follow my word. And if you do, I'll be God to you. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. I thank God that we got a God like that, right? He don't forsake his people, but he says, "I'll be with you even in you." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. You'll prophesy again. Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. How many believe that tonight? Come on. But that's what I I'm I I I I looked that says that what it is, you know, uh uh God God is always Come on. I say that he's always uh uh when he sends his his man or or God does something among amongst the people, it most of the time is misunderstood. Right? Come on. They depart like we say from the living God. One thing about it, you know, when when when Jo, not with Joseph, but when Jesus came on the scene, right, for him, John the Baptist shows up and they begin to ask John the Baptist because they knew the scriptures. The Pharisees and the scribes, they knew they knew the scriptures or the scrolls or whatever that day, they begin to ask him, "Are you the Messiah?" He says, "No, I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness." Right? But even though they had the letter of the scriptures, they couldn't see it when it was living right there before them, could they? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why when Jesus uh begin to show up, right? When Jesus showed up, begin to do the signs and wonders, they called him be elabub. I like how the even the people of uh that day they testified they that when Jesus was speaking, he was saying some of the same things that the that the scribes and the Pharisees been saying, but he says, "But he's speaking different from them." Hallelujah. Cuz he ain't just quoting it, but he's speaking like he got authority [screaming] behind it. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. What were they saying? He was making the word live. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's saying the same thing. But when he he speaks living something in my heart move. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. And I said that that's what it is today. You and I come on. As believers, what do you want? Come on. I want I want when when when I hear the word like they say something in my heart gets stirred. Something move on the inside. Right. You know that's why the devil don't want you to get near to life, right? He trembles at those things because he want to shake you. keep doing things, keep confusing, keep moving things among you. Keep your mind on this, keep your mind on that. Because if they ever get locked in, Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; If they ever get in prayer, Hallelujah. and begin to hear God's voice, something to wake [screaming] up on the inside of them. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. So what does he want to do? Keep noise about, don't he? Come on. Keep things, you know, uh, shaking, moving like that. What, whatever. But I says, "Lord, no matter what, you know, it's a lot of noise out there." Come on. There's a lot of things out there to contend with, right? But I says, "Right now, Lord, I got to be locked in." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. I got to be marking a perfect man, which is Christ, right? &gt;&gt; Keeping my eyes. How many want to keep their eyes on Christ tonight? But I says that what it is a lot of times we find that that I says that that you know uh through that through unbelief that's what it is. I says you know all of that what God was building them up to uh or was it was it get them just to grasp simple faith but they never could get it right. Come on. They never could get it. They always looked and to think things were way harder than what they were. Right. But I was thinking I says what it is. That's simple faith. One thing about Jesus, he he began to when he went down to uh Lazarus tomb and talking to Martha, he was saying that, you know, he that liveth and believeth in me, he'll never die. Right? But one of the things he he he said to her, he says, "Believest thou this?" Asking her, "Did she believe?" She said, "Yay, Lord, I believe." Hallelujah. Come on. I believe it. He said, "Then you'll see." You'll see the greater things. Right? &gt;&gt; Come on, God. That's what he wants. Do you believe? Hallelujah. Come on. If you believe it. I like how Mary says, she says, "How's it going to be? No man ever touched me." Right? But the angel begin to tell her the Holy Ghost was going to do it, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. It ain't in you. When you thinking about it, yes, you going to think you ain't able to do it, right? But one thing about it, you got to let the Holy Ghost do it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It ain't in [screaming] me, but it's in him. God, he'll do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh, Jesus. She said, "Be it unto me according to thy word." Hallelujah. When you looking at the sick being healed, come on. Signs and wonders. What it is, it ain't you, but you looking to God to do it &gt;&gt; because [screaming] God told you he'll do it. &gt;&gt; And then it's ain't in us, but it's in me saying, "Yes, Lord, I believe. Be it unto me." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. And God will confirm it. One thing about it, God will confirm his word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, I was I was sharing uh I think yesterday, one thing about God, you can't be God-given. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. You think that what you do God going to forget. Hallelujah. Come on. But when you when you do it out in the open and everybody know it. Come on. Then you already receive. God got no got no way to bless you. Right. &gt;&gt; Because you already got it. Self glorification. But when you do things in secret. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said in the word that I'll bless you what? Openly. Right. &gt;&gt; Come on. God's word can't fall to the ground. So many people want to be out like it said out there. But remember they got their reward. Hallelujah. But it's that one that's in secret praying, bringing down strongholds, standing in the gap. Hallelujah. God making a way. They might never get no recognition in this life, but they serve the purpose [screaming] that God put them here for. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. And a lot of times they praying for you. How many believe that tonight? Somebody give the Lord a hand clap of praise. [applause] Amen. I said, what it is, you know, all those things what God God brings us to those places, right? Come on. to get us to believe, but it ain't far. And that's what the devil does. He comes with all kinds of things, right? When the when God, you know, probably God was talking about one time that when the Lord reveals something, come on. When the re real revelation comes, then here come the devil. He sends something too. Come on. To try to combat it, a spiritual war break out. Come on. And what it is want to get everybody. And the worst thing can be everybody now get super religious, don't they? Everybody got a word. Everybody. Come on. But one thing about it, like I said, no matter what what it is, God going to back it up, right? Ain't it? You wait around long enough. That's why I said, Lord, that I I don't have you don't have to go around proving this and that, but God God going to back it up. He going to do what he said. &gt;&gt; Come on. I believe that with all of my heart. That's why you you can have confidence not in yourself, but in Christ, right? When you out doing witnessing to those that all over the place, right? You can stand fast in faith. They can tell you all this and that or there, but it won't never shake you. Won't never move you because you know what your relationship is with Christ. You know what he did for you. Hallelujah. And you're standing solid as a rock. Nothing can't shake you. You know what the voice of God is, right? You heard that voice and you'll know it when you hear it again. Hallelujah. It might sound This might sound real, might sound, come on. But just something in your spirit say, "Mm, come on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Uh-uh. That ain't right." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. or something ain't right. But when the real when the voice comes, you'll stand up and you'll cover your face. Hallelujah. Go out and meet God because you know that's God right there. Hallelujah. The fire won't shake [screaming] you. The quakes won't shake you. But when that still small voice come, you'll know that voice. Hallelujah. I heard it once and I hear it again. Come on. How many believe that tonight? Oh Jesus. But what it is, come on. I said many times people did that. They departed. Come on. From the living God. God. Not not not that God didn't come down and do things. He did. But what what happens? What caused him? Come on. I says I says we got to get back to the living God, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to get back. Hallelujah. To the to the real power, right? Real the life of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The life of it. The way you might not even understand all things, but you know one thing. You believe all things, right? &gt;&gt; You believe it and God will confirm it, right? &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't fully understand it, but to whom shall we go? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't fully understand, but to whom shall we go? I know that you got the answer to my problems right now. &gt;&gt; I know that you can solve my situation that I'm in right now. &gt;&gt; I don't have all the Come on. But I know one [screaming] thing that you're able to solve my situation. &gt;&gt; I know that you're able to intervene right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. on that woman that had that issue. She spent all her money from doctors. You got backed up in a corner to where she ain't had no other choice but to have simple faith. Right? That if I can touch the hem of his garment, right? Then I know what it is. God put her in that place the way she had no other choice but to believe. &gt;&gt; And God does the same thing today. How many believe that backs us in corners? Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. What he wants to show? He wants to show you that I'm alive and well. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm still living today. I ain't dead. I ain't I'm not just the God of old, but I'm I am that I am. I'm right now. Come on. He Most time people take God, they put them on a shelf. Oh, he do this, he that. When they look at it and then then they put it so far away from them that they can't even reach out to it theirel, right? Because it's so many things in their way. But I want to say the word is even he's not you. Come on. God is not even. He's in your mouth. He ain't that far away. I said, "Don't put him on a shelf." Come on. But let him be in your heart. Hallelujah. That when all these things try to block your way. He's right there sitting in your heart. Hallelujah. Trying to block your way from your victory. Block your way from your peace. Block your way from your joy or your healing. Nevertheless, God [screaming] is in my heart. Where I walk, he's walking with me, directing my paths, [screaming] making a way. Oh, there's big mountains, but I got the mountain moving within me. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. mountains in the way, &gt;&gt; but he is here living inside of me. &gt;&gt; Wake up, brothers. &gt;&gt; Wake up, sisters. Come on. It's a living God on your hands, right? [screaming] Believe us how it is. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Do you believe he's alive and well? &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh Jesus. When you know you serving a living God, you always have joy. &gt;&gt; Come on. Things catch you unaware, but then the joy joy bells ringing in my soul. Hallelujah. Why you got joy? Because I know that God is going to make a way. Though he slay me, yet I'll trust him. Right? And even if he don't show up, I still got faith to believe that God is going to make a way. He'll raise up the dead, won't he? Oh, Jesus. Come on. But that's what it's got to be. Come on. In your heart. How many believe that tonight? Come on. I'm stirred. I said what it is. Departing from the living God. One thing about Joshua and Caleb, different from the rest of them, they had a different spirit, didn't they? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. And you can see that today, it's a difference, right? &gt;&gt; How many believe that? &gt;&gt; I know it to be the truth. It's a difference. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise God. He said in the last days many are going to depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils or demons. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But be thou steadfast unreovable always abounding in the work of the Lord. For as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. It doesn't matter. Amen. If you know where you stand and you know whom you believe. Amen. You can trust in his unfailing word of promise that what God promised he's able to perform. So you can trust in that unfailing word of promise. Leaning on the everlasting arms. God. I know you do what you say. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I've already decided. Amen. I already made my choice. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. So, thank God we made our choice. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God that we know that Jesus is the answer. &gt;&gt; No matter what the problem is, no matter what we're going through, he is the answer. &gt;&gt; So, we thank God for Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise God.
