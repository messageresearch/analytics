[41:52] i went i
[41:54] died twice they told me
[41:56] but look at god
[41:58] what he does he brought me back
[42:03] and i thank god for the prayers
[42:06] of my family church
[42:08] how they pray
[42:10] and they tell me people praying all over
[42:13] and i one night
[42:14] i heard one of the churches i take out
[42:18] of maryland somewhere and they would
[42:20] call my name
[42:22] now i heard them praying for me
[42:25] but
[42:26] i want to say
[42:27] i thank the lord because i really
[42:31] really thought i was dead
[42:34] and i saw
[42:36] marilyn
[42:38] she had came
[42:39] and dressed me
[42:41] i was in a white casket
[42:44] and i prayed
[42:46] and prayed
[42:48] that they'll let me die
[42:50] because i kept
[42:52] hearing forces
[42:53] you know
[42:55] i was so sick
[42:58] until i wanted to die
[43:01] and i
[43:03] heard my brother
[43:05] pass a hearing
[43:07] and i thought him and sierra
[43:10] was doing something that was strange
[43:13] and i said
[43:15] why
[43:16] is he keep on praying
[43:18] and saying to the lord
[43:20] i can hear things
[43:23] that i may not hurt when i was dead
[43:26] but i could hear
[43:28] must be
[43:29] i don't know but i could hear things and
[43:31] hear voices
[43:32] and i heard him say
[43:35] lord
[43:36] let betty live and not die
[43:40] and i say what's wrong with you
[43:43] what are they doing they know i'm dead
[43:46] so why is he doing that
[43:49] i said things would be to change in the
[43:52] church because he keep on saying that
[43:56] i try to figure out why he's saying that
[44:00] and i'm so tired i said where is that
[44:02] willing and shouting the lord
[44:05] because they need to talk to sierra
[44:07] because i hear it doing something
[44:10] and i say i don't know what they do but
[44:12] they need to let me go ahead because i'm
[44:15] tired because i just keep on
[44:18] keep on trying and trying
[44:20] so today she knew what that mess they
[44:23] had on me and i was
[44:25] breathing so hard she said
[44:28] but uh
[44:30] i kept on praying about
[44:33] here it came again
[44:36] and he said lord
[44:38] let better live and not die
[44:41] i said let me live and not die
[44:44] i said maybe i did
[44:47] maybe i am leaving
[44:50] so
[44:51] i stopped praying
[44:53] lord
[44:54] let me live and not die
[44:57] and i kept on saying
[44:59] lord let me live and not die and that's
[45:02] the
[45:03] different scriptures
[45:05] and i started saying lord
[45:07] can you please let me touch
[45:09] to him on your garments
[45:12] so i because we made
[45:13] whole
[45:15] i thought about the woman with the issue
[45:17] of blood
[45:18] and how she wanted to touch to him or to
[45:21] come
[45:22] i didn't realize
[45:24] that i've been through so much
[45:26] i just know i kept praying and prayed i
[45:30] saw my nephew josh maryland saw
[45:33] and he came to me with that big spout
[45:37] and he said i bet it you're going to be
[45:39] all right
[45:41] and that's
[45:42] i didn't see him no more
[45:44] then i saw my brother larry
[45:47] larry
[45:48] he stayed with me
[45:50] the whole time
[45:52] i was going through
[45:53] and i could not understand i tried to
[45:56] shake him off
[45:57] but i couldn't shake him
[45:59] and he was still there
[46:01] with me
[46:03] i could feel freight
[46:04] going through my husband's right
[46:07] going through
[46:08] and i started
[46:10] getting upset
[46:12] and i was shaking
[46:14] and now
[46:16] i didn't know what was going on but i
[46:19] said lord
[46:20] let me not worry
[46:22] let me not stress over frame
[46:25] and i
[46:26] ask god to give me comfort and peace
[46:30] so i could not worry about him
[46:33] but later they told me the stories
[46:36] of what frank was going through
[46:38] and how he was so sick and he had left
[46:41] also
[46:42] and how god brought him back
[46:45] you know
[46:46] i could hear the nurses and different
[46:49] ones talking
[46:51] but they didn't know i could hear them
[46:53] because they told stories
[46:55] to each other that i don't think they
[46:56] wanted me to hear
[46:59] but i could hear
[47:01] i had one two friends
[47:03] they were best friends
[47:05] and one of them would say her husband
[47:07] want a car
[47:09] a truck for forty five thousand dollars
[47:13] and um
[47:14] the other friend said
[47:16] well
[47:17] you're gonna let him put it in his name
[47:19] does that
[47:20] and she said
[47:22] no
[47:23] i've been thinking about it but i'm not
[47:25] gonna do that to him she said you need
[47:28] to do it
[47:29] because
[47:31] he already left you one time
[47:34] and you had to catch up on all the bills
[47:37] and
[47:38] she said
[47:39] well
[47:40] i love my husband i'm gonna do it she
[47:43] said well you told me
[47:44] i didn't want talking to you about it
[47:47] and she said i don't think that's good
[47:49] for you to do
[47:50] and she said well i'm gonna do it anyway
[47:54] so that story
[47:55] [Music]
[47:57] and i
[47:58] remember a lady a nurse irene
[48:02] she stayed with me while i was going
[48:04] through and lately what sierra had told
[48:08] me about her and tasha just told me
[48:11] about i said that's that same lady that
[48:14] was in critical care with me
[48:17] she was so sweet to me
[48:19] they were so sweet that they were
[48:21] fussing over me
[48:23] why they fussing over person i couldn't
[48:25] talk
[48:27] i couldn't see
[48:29] but i could hear
[48:31] and how they were so lovely to me
[48:35] and the doctors there you remember dr
[48:37] chicago
[48:40] i called him dr chicago i could
[48:42] pronounce his name
[48:44] but i realized i wasn't the only one
[48:46] calling dr chicago
[48:48] the rest of them would call them that
[48:49] too
[48:51] the nurses said i would call them dutch
[48:53] but sugar cargo was so good to me i got
[48:57] one on paulo
[48:58] because polo he wore a polo shirt all
[49:01] the time
[49:03] that's what i don't came through y'all
[49:05] when i had good for
[49:07] my brother burnout he'll come and stay

[49:13] all my nieces and my daughter they stay
[49:16] at night
[49:18] i mean not all of them it's too many of
[49:20] them
[49:22] but
[49:23] they had
[49:24] boss lady she's not here today but boss
[49:27] lady charlene
[49:29] she had him coming
[49:31] she came when you was a girl boy
[49:34] you had to stay there
[49:36] because she tell you
[49:38] this your day
[49:40] that mean you go
[49:42] and she was so good to me
[49:45] and i remember
[49:46] hell willie
[49:48] she i was trying to be bad one day
[49:51] because i was trying to get that thing
[49:52] out of my throat
[49:54] that um
[49:56] ventilator
[49:57] i would i was trying to get what's
[49:59] called it
[50:00] the reality i was trying to get that out
[50:02] of my throat
[50:04] so i hit the nurse
[50:06] she said no miss betty that's not you
[50:10] but she said i'm gonna tell you
[50:12] something
[50:13] i couldn't see her
[50:14] but i could hear a voice
[50:16] she said
[50:17] miss betty
[50:19] if you take that out of your throat
[50:22] you'll die
[50:23] i bet i ain't tried no more
[50:27] i understood
[50:29] i might have been out of it
[50:31] but i sure understood
[50:33] that you would die

[51:06] but my brother brother now told me they
[51:08] weren't gonna let me down

[1:01:21] the evidence of things not seen to
[1:01:27] through faith we understand
[1:01:30] that the worlds were framed by the word
[1:01:33] of god so that the things which are seen
[1:01:36] were not made of the things which do
[1:01:38] appear for
[1:01:54] by faith enoch was translated that he
[1:01:57] should not see there and was not found
[1:02:01] because god had translated him for

[1:02:10] that he pleased god 6.
[1:02:24] together by faith noah being warned of
[1:02:28] god of things not seen yet
[1:02:31] move with fear preparing an ark for the

[1:03:02] and that's uh sight smell hear taste and
[1:03:06] touch
[1:03:07] praise god
[1:03:08] with those five senses we contact our
[1:03:11] earthly home
[1:03:13] we we are able to be to communicate with
[1:03:17] the earthly
[1:03:19] but we need faith to
[1:03:22] contact the heavenly
[1:03:24] and faith he says here faith is the
[1:03:27] substance of things hoped for it's the
[1:03:29] supersense

[1:03:32] and uh it sometimes folks interchanging
[1:03:36] in ministering they talk about
[1:03:40] the body the soul and the spirit
[1:03:43] amen man is made up body soul and spirit
[1:03:46] animal made up a body and
[1:03:50] spirit but they don't have a soul
[1:03:52] so the difference between animal
[1:03:55] and man
[1:03:56] man has a soul and with the soul we we
[1:04:00] can
[1:04:01] choose
[1:04:03] to serve god or not
[1:04:06] so we have uh
[1:04:08] free will
[1:04:10] amen we if we wanna we can serve the
[1:04:12] lord if we don't wanna we don't have to
[1:04:16] amen
[1:04:17] so we have a will
[1:04:19] and uh we find that
[1:04:22] by nature
[1:04:24] we were born amen
[1:04:27] the earthly the carnal
[1:04:30] we were counterminded
[1:04:33] and the bible teaches us that counter
[1:04:35] mind is enmity against god is not
[1:04:37] subject to the lords of god and neither
[1:04:39] indeed can it be
[1:04:42] so we were conquered by nature we know
[1:04:45] we actually live by what we hear amen
[1:04:49] what we feel what we see
[1:04:51] amen
[1:04:52] and you know a lot of times
[1:04:54] uh
[1:04:55] those senses those five senses
[1:04:58] they dominate and they control our lives
[1:05:02] now in the spirit realm uh some people
[1:05:05] change spirit some people say so but in
[1:05:07] the spirit realm we have imagination
[1:05:09] conscious memory
[1:05:11] reasoning and affection
[1:05:13] those five inlets
[1:05:15] can i say it again
[1:05:17] we have imagination conscious memory
[1:05:19] reason and affection amen
[1:05:23] and the greatest battle ever fought is
[1:05:25] fought within our minds
[1:05:27] are you with me
[1:05:29] so you have a mind a mind battle we're
[1:05:32] living in an age amen now amen that
[1:05:35] people are losing their minds
[1:05:38] amen everywhere we look because the
[1:05:40] pressure is so great
[1:05:42] amen everything is moving so fast
[1:05:46] it's moving super super fast
[1:05:49] and because we have everything has
[1:05:51] speeded up they meant so amen uh
[1:05:55] man amen cannot grasp everything that's
[1:05:58] going on
[1:05:59] so our minds are not capable of grasping
[1:06:02] all that's going on
[1:06:04] and so people are having amen
[1:06:07] their battles they meant they're putting
[1:06:09] so much pressure on the children in
[1:06:11] school to the children in school just
[1:06:13] give up
[1:06:15] amen so we're living in a chaotic age
[1:06:17] we're living in an age where
[1:06:19] a new rotted age a nervous age and
[1:06:22] nervous tension people are losing it
[1:06:25] everywhere
[1:06:26] amen
[1:06:28] praise god the only place there's sanity
[1:06:30] and there's peace is in christ
[1:06:33] are you with me
[1:06:34] if we're not in christ we don't have any
[1:06:36] sanity we don't have any peace
[1:06:39] because jesus said my peace i give you
[1:06:42] not as the world give give our you
[1:06:44] amen so we are talking about
[1:06:47] the the spirit realm amen imagination
[1:06:50] consciousness and memory and affection
[1:06:52] and so forth amen but we
[1:06:55] we faith is the depths and we're talking
[1:06:59] about the soul realm it operates through
[1:07:01] faith or unbelief
[1:07:04] down in the soul now which if you have
[1:07:07] faith
[1:07:08] amen in order to have the kind of faith
[1:07:10] that you need you have to be a christian
[1:07:12] you have to be born again
[1:07:15] you know sometimes folks that i and back
[1:07:17] in our day with young people they said
[1:07:19] you got to have a strong constitution
[1:07:22] and you got to have a strong mind you
[1:07:24] got to have strong will and sometimes if
[1:07:26] that's all you got
[1:07:29] amen
[1:07:30] amen the world is gonna amen praise god
[1:07:33] give you some difficult times
[1:07:35] you're gonna need more than a strong
[1:07:37] constitution and and a strong mind
[1:07:40] you're gonna need god
[1:07:42] praise god because the things that
[1:07:44] you're facing in situations and
[1:07:46] conditions that you
[1:07:48] come into amen praise god
[1:07:52] you're going to need god to fight your
[1:07:54] battles
[1:07:55] you're going to need god to have victory
[1:07:57] and overcoming power
[1:07:59] without god you're going to fall you're
[1:08:01] going to fail
[1:08:03] praise god you're going to need god when
[1:08:05] the waters are troubled
[1:08:08] praise god when everything coming
[1:08:09] against you
[1:08:11] praise god things are not going the way
[1:08:13] you think they ought to go and things
[1:08:15] are not going like you wanted to go
[1:08:18] praise god the pressure get great
[1:08:20] sometimes even on young people amen
[1:08:22] teenagers they're just blowing their
[1:08:24] brains out they're doing all kind of
[1:08:26] they're just uh just committing suicide
[1:08:28] left and right they met because the
[1:08:30] pressure is so great
[1:08:32] praise god they have nothing to live for
[1:08:35] praise god they don't they don't know
[1:08:36] why they're here they don't know where
[1:08:38] they're going and they don't know what
[1:08:40] the purpose of life is
[1:08:42] the answers are only found in the word
[1:08:44] of god
[1:08:45] they admit jesus is the answer for all
[1:08:48] that you go to and all that you're going
[1:08:50] through for you said i'm the beginning
[1:08:51] and i'm the end i'm the first and i'm
[1:08:53] the last
[1:08:54] praise god
[1:08:56] said by faith we understand that the
[1:08:58] words were framed by the word of god
[1:09:01] so the word of god is the thing the
[1:09:02] bible says in john 1 1 in the beginning
[1:09:05] was the word the word was with god and
[1:09:07] the word was god
[1:09:09] praise god i i i say all the time don't
[1:09:12] let nobody
[1:09:13] fool you
[1:09:15] don't let nobody deceive you
[1:09:17] the bible said the fool says in his
[1:09:19] heart that there is no god
[1:09:22] praise god but there's somebody that
[1:09:23] made the world
[1:09:25] the bible said he was in the world the
[1:09:26] world was made by him
[1:09:29] and the bible said know ye that
[1:09:31] the lord he's god
[1:09:33] it is he that made us and not
[1:09:36] not we ourselves
[1:09:38] they meant somebody made you
[1:09:41] and it got to
[1:09:42] he meant somebody bigger than you or not
[1:09:45] so the word of god you know i want you
[1:09:48] to know that this word is the word of
[1:09:51] god
[1:09:52] and it's now listen to what he says in
[1:09:55] the beginning was the word
[1:09:58] and the word was with god
[1:10:00] and the word
[1:10:02] was god
[1:10:04] now your bible is just not another
[1:10:06] history book
[1:10:09] this bible is god
[1:10:11] in letter form
[1:10:14] are you with me
[1:10:15] but if you look at it as just another
[1:10:18] book
[1:10:19] amen praise god and
[1:10:21] and some folk
[1:10:23] amen they'll try to add to the book
[1:10:26] and they'll try to take away from the
[1:10:28] book sometimes folks try to make the
[1:10:30] bible better
[1:10:31] so they call it the living bible they
[1:10:34] call it a
[1:10:35] new world translation they call it all
[1:10:37] kind of names to make the bible suit
[1:10:40] their tastes and where they can
[1:10:42] understand it and interpret it in their
[1:10:44] own way
[1:10:46] so you got so many bibles that it costs
[1:10:49] a massive confusion
[1:10:51] among the people so the people don't
[1:10:53] know amen but it was a time when amen
[1:10:57] the king james virgin was good enough
[1:11:00] now people are getting so intelligent
[1:11:02] said we can't understand that amen but
[1:11:06] when you got all kind of you come to
[1:11:08] church and you don't know which bible
[1:11:10] they're preaching now
[1:11:12] are you with me
[1:11:13] but it was once amen everybody
[1:11:16] understood that i believe god would
[1:11:18] watch over his word to perform and i
[1:11:21] believe god a keep this word i believe
[1:11:23] god is evil amen i believe god's people
[1:11:26] want something amen that is it is good
[1:11:30] to testify
[1:11:32] praise god if it's good enough for the
[1:11:34] saints of all it's good enough for us
[1:11:36] now
[1:11:37] are you with me
[1:11:39] but uh we find that people amen have to
[1:11:43] be school and learn and they need so
[1:11:46] much education to be trying to
[1:11:48] understand or be a preacher or minister
[1:11:51] of the word but i want you to know amen
[1:11:54] a holy man suspect that they were moved
[1:11:57] by the holy ghost
[1:11:58] amen it took god sometimes chose
[1:12:02] men that were ignorant and already
[1:12:04] learned and he chose them they meant to
[1:12:07] be his apostles and his followers amen
[1:12:10] sometimes he didn't say amen uh luke
[1:12:14] because you were a physician i'm gonna
[1:12:16] give you the keys to the kingdom he
[1:12:18] didn't say amen praise god to uh some of
[1:12:22] those that were uh
[1:12:24] of the most intelligent that you know
[1:12:27] the world amen will set one of above
[1:12:30] another by amen the intellect but god
[1:12:33] amen looks at the heart amen he he
[1:12:36] didn't look at the statue of saul and so
[1:12:39] it's all amen but the people looked at
[1:12:42] saul and then and they saw a man a man
[1:12:45] that could represent them as king amen
[1:12:48] but they overlooked samuel the prophet
[1:12:50] that god was using
[1:12:52] amen i want you to know amen god amen
[1:12:56] looks at his word and he sees that my
[1:12:59] word is good enough
[1:13:02] amen my word amen can do the job if you
[1:13:05] only have faith in it
[1:13:08] amen praise god i believe god's word
[1:13:11] amen i thank god for sister bearded
[1:13:13] testimony i believe god's word is what
[1:13:15] kept her
[1:13:17] i believe god's word is what delivered
[1:13:19] her
[1:13:20] amen it's the word amen that they
[1:13:23] mention your hands down in the heart
[1:13:25] it was the word that brought out
[1:13:28] and it's a word now
[1:13:30] god still lives
[1:13:32] i i i said he's still the same god
[1:13:36] amen he's the same god today as he was
[1:13:38] yesterday he's doing the same things
[1:13:42] oh yes he is
[1:13:44] thank god amen that we can see and we
[1:13:47] can say i'm a witness
[1:13:49] i'm a living witness
[1:13:51] that god does amen the same things today
[1:13:55] amen he's still a miracle worker amen he
[1:13:58] still raises the dead he still calls the
[1:14:01] lane to walk to come to talk the blind
[1:14:04] to see he's still god
[1:14:07] hallelujah
[1:14:09] praise god hallelujah
[1:14:13] praise god i want you to amen
[1:14:15] the bible tells us we walk by faith not
[1:14:18] by sight
[1:14:19] amen don't don't amen your eyes will
[1:14:22] deceive you
[1:14:24] amen because the eyes will tell you that
[1:14:26] saul ought to be king
[1:14:29] praise god
[1:14:30] and uh when they went down to david's
[1:14:32] house eli ab and all of them brothers
[1:14:35] come out and they forgot all about
[1:14:38] david because he was just so little and
[1:14:40] so small he probably didn't look like a
[1:14:43] king
[1:14:44] but god said
[1:14:46] to samuel don't leave here because i
[1:14:48] sent you the jester house on the king
[1:14:50] and
[1:14:52] they they had to go find david
[1:14:54] amen keeping the sheep are you a man
[1:14:58] praise god but they probably knew within
[1:15:00] themselves no usually calling that boy
[1:15:02] and that's what folk counts you out
[1:15:04] sometimes
[1:15:05] they might count you out amen on in the
[1:15:08] job and the little clicks and everything
[1:15:10] folks have they count you out
[1:15:13] amen but don't worry about it you might
[1:15:15] be an oddball count it out but amen god
[1:15:18] sees you
[1:15:19] god sees your every effort god sees amen
[1:15:22] to heart
[1:15:23] god knows what's inside of you
[1:15:26] amen god knows them that are his
[1:15:29] amen he knows you amen
[1:15:32] praise god
[1:15:34] the word of god means nothing
[1:15:36] amen to us
[1:15:38] a sinner
[1:15:40] you tell a senator the word
[1:15:42] amen they they said well
[1:15:46] what what's that to me
[1:15:48] that don't mean a thing
[1:15:50] but you tell somebody that was
[1:15:52] amen in the mind of god before the
[1:15:55] foundation of the world
[1:15:57] you tell somebody that was a gene seed
[1:16:00] of god that they were attributing the
[1:16:02] mind of god somebody that god amen saw
[1:16:05] before the foundation of the world
[1:16:07] i'm so glad he saw me
[1:16:09] i'm so glad that god chose us in him
[1:16:12] before the foundation of the world
[1:16:14] god saw you there he met in his mind he
[1:16:17] took a picture of you and he knew
[1:16:19] exactly where you'll be
[1:16:21] he knew exactly that one day you hear
[1:16:23] the voice of god and you'll know it was
[1:16:26] god calling you
[1:16:27] amen you'll recognize that when jesus
[1:16:30] died on the cross he said whosoever will
[1:16:32] let him come
[1:16:34] amen but he said if i'll be lifted up
[1:16:36] i'll draw all men i i'm so glad it drew
[1:16:39] me
[1:16:40] i'm so glad that the blood of jesus amen
[1:16:43] it was not in vain
[1:16:44] i'm so glad when jesus shattered
[1:16:46] expressive blood it was for the
[1:16:48] remission of my sin
[1:16:50] i'm so glad that i can look at the cross
[1:16:52] and say god thank you
[1:16:54] i'm so glad that the blood of jesus was
[1:16:57] shared for me
[1:16:59] it means something to me it may not mean
[1:17:02] anything to you but the blood means
[1:17:04] something to me jesus god meant
[1:17:07] something to me and it means everything
[1:17:09] to me
[1:17:11] oh yes he saved me
[1:17:13] wash me in his blood amen because i
[1:17:16] believe that he died in my place
[1:17:19] ain't that the bible teaches us that he
[1:17:21] didn't knew no sin but made sin for us
[1:17:23] that we might be made the righteousness
[1:17:24] of god in him
[1:17:26] praise god i thank god that he calls you
[1:17:29] and i his righteousness
[1:17:31] because he was made what we were
[1:17:33] he became flesh
[1:17:35] amen praise god that you and i might
[1:17:37] become worried
[1:17:39] are you with me
[1:17:40] hallelujah
[1:17:42] it takes faith to believe it
[1:17:44] i didn't want to be too long
[1:17:47] i just want that testimony to sink down
[1:17:50] praise god i wanted to live with you
[1:17:52] but i want to tell you
[1:17:54] it takes faith to please god
[1:17:56] if you're going to please god the bible
[1:17:59] teaches us in galatians
[1:18:01] 3 he says we are children of god by
[1:18:03] faith in christ jesus for many of us has
[1:18:05] baptized into christ have put on christ
[1:18:08] are you with me
[1:18:09] oh we need the bond the free you need a
[1:18:11] jew no gentile
[1:18:13] amen praise god but we are all one in
[1:18:15] christ
[1:18:16] amen
[1:18:18] god made a way for you and i
[1:18:20] by faith
[1:18:22] faith means nothing to
[1:18:24] some folk but faith is a revelation and
[1:18:27] faith is the amen the kind of faith i'm
[1:18:29] talking about is the baptism of the holy
[1:18:31] ghost he said except a man be born again
[1:18:34] he cannot see amen not with these five
[1:18:38] senses but i'm talking about the sixth
[1:18:40] sense with his faith
[1:18:42] amen you see with not with your natural
[1:18:44] eyes what you see by faith and your what
[1:18:47] you do you see you see the bible says oh
[1:18:50] taste and see
[1:18:52] that the lord he's good so what are you
[1:18:54] seeing in that praise god you're tasting
[1:18:57] of the word of god and you see that god
[1:19:00] is good amen
[1:19:01] so i see amen what my eyes cannot see
[1:19:05] they make
[1:19:06] my heart believe amen praise god your
[1:19:09] heart believes that the amen god is and
[1:19:12] god is a rewarder of them that dealing
[1:19:15] to seek him i'm so glad that his
[1:19:17] supersenses here somebody amen a super
[1:19:21] race amen of people that amen that's
[1:19:23] born of the supernatural the bone of the
[1:19:26] spirit

[1:19:29] sister amen god is raising up a people
[1:19:32] that's going to walk by faith and not by
[1:19:34] sight god is raising up a super race
[1:19:37] amen there are people that's gonna
[1:19:39] operate in supernatural power praise god
[1:19:42] they're not gonna they meant to look to
[1:19:44] these five says i'm telling you amen we
[1:19:46] have called those things to be not as
[1:19:48] though they are you'll look at it and

[1:20:33] and
[1:20:34] you

[1:20:37] a force
[1:20:39] that comes from the pits of hell you got
[1:20:41] to cast it down
[1:20:44] you cast down reasoning
[1:20:46] you cast on anything that

[1:21:14] said with the stripes i'm healed

[1:35:13] in my room
[1:35:17] [Music]
[1:35:34] i want to thank the lord this morning
[1:35:35] and i was sitting here
[1:35:37] while the service was going on i was
[1:35:39] thinking how god gave us the power to
[1:35:41] feel other infirmities and he said the
[1:35:44] works that i do we shall do also lord
[1:35:46] and i just thank the lord for the word
[1:35:48] lord and i ask lord that you would just
[1:35:50] come lord and be in our midst lord and
[1:35:52] oh god you said lord we
[1:35:54] oh god that
[1:35:56] you're living within us lord at one time
[1:35:59] god was above us but now god is generous
[1:36:01] lord i ask the lord that you will
[1:36:02] glorify yourself
[1:36:04] and else lord actually you know i
[1:36:06] realized sometime when jesus christ died
[1:36:08] he went to the cross he glorified god
[1:36:10] but god glorified himself again and
[1:36:13] again and he still glorifying himself as
[1:36:16] we do the word of god and live and god
[1:36:19] shows itself in you he is glorifying
[1:36:21] himself help us to glorify god and
[1:36:24] glorify him in a big way because now
[1:36:27] this virus and stuff is coming around on
[1:36:29] the world and oh god and i realized that
[1:36:33] man ain't got nothing for it but god has
[1:36:35] already given to us
[1:36:37] love we love if we can love one another
[1:36:40] and show the world that we love one
[1:36:42] another
[1:36:43] then
[1:36:44] we are in
[1:36:47] the presence of god and the devil can't
[1:36:49] come there
[1:36:50] i thought that we would just bless this
[1:36:52] lord and go with each and every one of
[1:36:54] us lord and oh god you said that you're
[1:36:56] the inner lord just just protect us and
[1:36:58] lead us basically and keep us safe and
[1:37:01] lead us back to this place again in the
[1:37:03] name of jesus christ our lord savior
[1:37:05] amen
[1:37:17] [Music]
[1:37:30] you
