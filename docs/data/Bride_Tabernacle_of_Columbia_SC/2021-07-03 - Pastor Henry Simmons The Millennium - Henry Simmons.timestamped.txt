[33:49] god would help them in their time
[33:52] troubles and be with them in jesus name
[34:11] revelation 20 1
[34:14] and i saw an angel come down from heaven
[34:18] having the keys at the bottom of this
[34:20] pit and a great
[34:22] chain in his hand and he laid hold on
[34:26] the dragon
[34:27] that old servant which is the devil
[34:31] and satan bound him a thousand years
[34:36] and cast him in the bottomless pit
[34:39] and shut him up and set a seal upon him
[34:43] that
[34:44] he should deceive the nations no more
[34:47] to the thousand years should be
[34:49] fulfilled
[34:51] and after that he must be loose
[34:54] a little season and i saw
[34:58] thrones and they just set upon them
[35:02] and judgment was given unto them and i
[35:05] saw the souls
[35:06] of them that were beheaded for the
[35:09] witness of jesus
[35:11] and for the word of god
[35:14] and which had not worshipped the beast
[35:18] neither his image neither had received
[35:23] his
[35:23] mark upon their forehead
[35:26] or in their and they
[35:30] lived and reigned with christ
[35:33] a thousand years
[35:36] but the rest of the dead lived not again
[35:39] until the thousand years were finished
[35:43] this is the first resurrection
[35:47] blessed and holy is he that has
[35:51] part in the first resurrection on such
[35:54] the second death has no power
[35:57] but they shall be priests of god
[36:00] and of christ and shall reign
[36:04] with him a thousand years
[36:08] may god bless the reader towards you may
[36:10] be seated
[36:12] tonight as we talk
[36:15] concerning the millennium
[36:19] reign the millennium
[36:22] and parallel and
[36:25] the millennium are the same as we're
[36:29] talking about
[36:30] the feasts of tabernacle
[36:33] the fisa tabernacle and then again we
[36:36] want to style it
[36:38] as we're talking about the kingdom age
[36:42] the kingdom age remember
[36:45] he comes as jesus comes his three son
[36:50] son a man son of god and son of david
[36:57] so as you look at
[37:01] the son a man
[37:05] that's prophet and son of god
[37:08] holy ghost throughout the church ages
[37:12] back to son of man in this age
[37:17] prophetic ministry
[37:20] back to son of david
[37:24] are y'all with me son of david
[37:30] and that is that's king
[37:34] pilot put a king of the jews
[37:39] in other words he was
[37:42] the jews were in anticipating the
[37:45] kingdom age
[37:48] so in acts 1
[37:52] it says here in acts 1
[37:56] and 4 and being a symbol i'm going to
[37:59] try to take it slow
[38:01] i know i said a subject like this
[38:04] i would just have to take a day or
[38:06] saturday or something and teach for
[38:08] three or four hours take a break
[38:10] and come back and teach some more where
[38:13] i can
[38:13] put all the pieces together and all but
[38:16] i'm going to try to give y'all a little
[38:17] synopsy
[38:19] and hopefully praise god you can kind of
[38:23] look into things on your own
[38:26] and if you need if you have
[38:29] questions we'll be glad to answer those
[38:31] questions for you
[38:33] are you with me now when i said the
[38:36] feast of tabernacle
[38:38] remember you have the feast
[38:41] the passover you have the feast
[38:44] of unleavened bread you have the feast
[38:46] of first fruits
[38:47] and you have the feast of pentecost
[38:53] so jesus he said when i see the blood i
[38:56] pass over you
[38:58] are you with me the feasts are passed
[39:01] over the face of unleavened bread this
[39:02] is the bread
[39:03] that was broken for you are you with me
[39:08] feast of the first fruits first one to
[39:11] raise from the dead
[39:12] resurrection
[39:15] feasts of pentecost the seven
[39:19] ages seven times seven
[39:22] and then on the fifth it was jubilee
[39:29] so the day of pentecost was fully come
[39:32] amen
[39:35] then you had the feasts of trumpets
[39:38] called an israel by
[39:42] to her homeland so
[39:46] dealing with the jews and so forth
[39:49] then we have the feast of atonement
[39:51] where where israel
[39:52] recognizes the messiah the one
[39:56] where did you get those wounds in your
[39:57] hand
[39:59] and then after the feast of atonement
[40:03] you have the feast of tabernacle so
[40:06] during the time of moses and elijah god
[40:09] reveals himself
[40:11] to the israel
[40:14] so there'll be a return in great
[40:16] revelation period god have those two
[40:18] prophets
[40:18] revelation 11. are you with me
[40:21] so by the grace of god that's why i said
[40:24] to take time
[40:25] just just to bring you up to the feast
[40:28] the millennium and fisa tabernacle and
[40:30] so forth
[40:31] to bring you there then you can see
[40:33] where you come from till you get there
[40:36] are you with me so that'll take
[40:39] but i don't style myself as a teacher
[40:43] but if i taught i would teach so slow
[40:46] so to take hours and hours and i see why
[40:49] teachers take so long so by the grace of
[40:52] god because it certainly would take me
[40:54] long
[40:55] so by the grace of god now i said acts 1
[40:58] and 4 it says
[41:01] being assembled together with them
[41:05] commanded them that they should not
[41:07] depart from jerusalem
[41:09] but wait for the promise of the father
[41:12] which he
[41:13] says ye have heard of me
[41:16] for john truly baptized with water
[41:19] but ye shall be baptized with the holy
[41:22] ghost not many days
[41:23] hints and when they
[41:27] therefore were come together the
[41:30] acts of him saying lord
[41:34] without at what with i
[41:37] at what do what
[41:41] restore amen
[41:45] again see once they had it
[41:49] will die at this time restore again the
[41:52] kingdom to israel
[41:53] isn't that right so jesus after his
[41:56] resurrection
[41:58] and talking about almost sending promise
[42:00] they said
[42:01] lord will not this time restore the
[42:04] kingdom
[42:04] to israel so israel was anticipating the
[42:08] king
[42:09] he said my kingdom is not of this world
[42:11] but they thought he
[42:13] and you remember blind bartimaeus said
[42:15] jesus that son of david have mercy upon
[42:18] us
[42:19] they would recognize him as the son of
[42:20] david as that king that was supposed to
[42:22] come
[42:23] and subdue their enemies and
[42:26] establish his of his kingdom and love
[42:28] his government there shall be no end
[42:30] he had arrived but yet
[42:34] that portion of his ministry he was only
[42:38] displaying
[42:40] amen a portion he's coming as savior
[42:43] amen
[42:45] but they they didn't miss they miss him
[42:47] coming as savior
[42:49] they wanted him to come as king and he
[42:52] come
[42:53] amen as to sacrifice his life and to die
[42:57] wounded father transgress bruised fire
[42:59] he come to fulfill that portion
[43:01] of scripture
[43:02] but they were looking for him to restore
[43:05] the kingdom
[43:06] they were going you know sometimes we
[43:08] look for the physical
[43:09] amen and god want to restore the
[43:11] spiritual
[43:13] and when god come to restore the
[43:16] spiritual they were looking for the
[43:17] physical
[43:18] restoration and it was being fulfilled
[43:21] in the spiritual which far
[43:23] exceeded the natural
[43:26] so what they were looking for in the
[43:28] natural and in the physical
[43:29] they meant god would restore it in
[43:33] amid the spirit he said
[43:36] amen he said the kingdom of god coming
[43:39] not without the
[43:40] observation neither shall they say low
[43:43] here lord there
[43:44] for the kingdom of heaven is within him
[43:48] he said the kingdom of heaven is not
[43:49] meat and drink but righteousness peace
[43:51] and what
[43:53] joy in the holy ghost he was giving them
[43:55] the spiritual
[43:57] before they received the natural and
[44:00] physical
[44:01] god was going to give them the spiritual
[44:04] you see what i'm saying sometimes we
[44:06] want the natural
[44:08] first before we get the spiritual
[44:11] amen but if we get the natural first we
[44:14] may not
[44:15] think we need the spiritual so god gives
[44:19] you
[44:19] the the spiritual kingdom they meant
[44:22] that amen you might be worthy when he
[44:25] gives you the physical
[44:28] are you open sometimes we want the
[44:30] physical manifestation
[44:32] but god wants you to be saved first
[44:36] and have eternal life before it gives
[44:40] you
[44:40] just physical healing and supply your
[44:43] needs
[44:45] are you with me because your soul needs
[44:47] it more
[44:49] and if you never got it in the physical
[44:51] realm it's good that you got it
[44:53] in the inner man hallelujah
[44:57] that if this after house were dissolved
[45:01] if this house healed amen praise god
[45:05] oh job wasn't worried about it he said
[45:06] naked came under this world neck and i
[45:08] shall return
[45:09] the lord give the lord take it away
[45:11] blessed be the name of the lord
[45:14] but sometimes folks are focusing on the
[45:16] outer
[45:17] thing and they need to be focusing on
[45:20] the inward man
[45:22] he said though our outward man perish
[45:24] our ignorant man
[45:26] is renewed that all day by day
[45:29] didn't i tell you it's hard for me to
[45:30] teach
[45:35] so god will do something for you
[45:39] and see though that's what it is
[45:41] difficult when people are setting
[45:44] amen in the physical realm and they're
[45:47] uh
[45:47] they're caught up amen see that's why he
[45:50] said except a man
[45:51] is born again he cannot see in other
[45:53] words he cannot understand
[45:56] the kingdom of god except a man be born
[45:59] a warning spirit he cannot
[46:01] what error
[46:04] oh you look man that's why the prophet
[46:07] said amen
[46:08] uh this is spiritual food and new season
[46:12] he said this is bride food
[46:16] amen it's too rich
[46:19] for the rest of the world
[46:22] i'm not gonna say you know it's just too
[46:24] rich wrong
[46:25] they wouldn't know what to do with it
[46:28] they couldn't they couldn't hold these
[46:30] mystery truths brother friend they
[46:33] couldn't hold it they spit it back up
[46:35] because it's too rich for them but this
[46:38] is bright food amen
[46:41] god opened the word to you amen because
[46:44] it's
[46:44] bright food it's for you it's for you
[46:48] amen hallelujah that's why blessed are
[46:51] you he is because you hear
[46:53] amen not just him but you're able to eat
[46:56] this
[46:58] amen because you know it's spiritual
[47:00] food in due season
[47:02] amen god is good amen
[47:08] you can go back over to future home and
[47:10] spiritual food and due season and stuff
[47:12] like that
[47:13] and and see what i'm feasting on and get
[47:15] me excited amen
[47:18] sometimes i tell you sometimes i don't
[47:19] say nothing you just have to search it
[47:22] out
[47:23] okay so he says
[47:27] will you at this time restore the
[47:28] kingdom to israel
[47:30] and i you know it it's very real that
[47:32] people are
[47:33] so busy looking amen for the rapture
[47:37] the physical rapture and then not being
[47:40] caught up
[47:43] now for he says come up hither
[47:47] amen he's calling the bride out of the
[47:50] church
[47:52] amen is calling you up
[47:55] praise god out of the seventh into the
[47:57] broad age
[47:59] are you with me so god is trying to get
[48:02] you
[48:02] out amen in translation
[48:06] he's rapturing you he's calling you out
[48:08] and calling you up
[48:10] with a high calling amen while all the
[48:14] spewing and going on and all the plane
[48:17] crashes and wrecks
[48:19] he's calling you to be astronauts are
[48:22] you with me to fly higher amen
[48:24] to break the sound barrier amen what all
[48:27] of these
[48:28] fussing and going on you up there
[48:32] amen praise god hallelujah it's not
[48:35] something we're talking about
[48:36] it's something we got to manifest as a
[48:39] lot of folk can talk it
[48:41] but let's manifest it praise god that we
[48:45] actually have taken off into another
[48:48] spear
[48:51] oh hallelujah that you are living in
[48:54] another dimension
[48:56] praise god you're locked in you've
[48:59] taken off praise god
[49:03] hallelujah praise god you were
[49:06] astronauts

[49:10] how to fly a plane but
[49:12] this is not plain this is astronaut
[49:14] praise god
[49:19] but by the grace of god he says and he's
[49:22] sending
[49:23] them in the seventh verse he said unto
[49:25] them
[49:26] it's not for you to what are you with me
[49:31] it's not for you to what
[49:37] the time are the way
[49:41] yo yo y'all watching it's not for you to
[49:43] know the time

[49:48] i can see i'm not gonna get nowhere
[49:50] tonight
[49:52] i might as well stop
[49:56] it's not for you to know what
[49:59] you know if you miss this you missing
[50:02] your day of visitation
[50:04] and because it's because you
[50:07] sometimes the ministry might think
[50:10] people understand what they're saying
[50:12] and they don't understand not a thing
[50:15] yet they are right there
[50:16] and said i never heard that before
[50:20] but i want you to listen make sure you
[50:24] understand what is being said
[50:28] where you can be raptured and you can be
[50:30] caught up
[50:32] because faith come by what here and by
[50:35] faith in it was what now if you want to
[50:38] be

[50:59] so the word amen become materialized in
[51:02] you
[51:03] you become the word you become the
[51:04] rapture
[51:06] the rapture is made up of who
[51:08] individuals right

[51:14] to me what and the word rapture being
[51:17] caught up who's going
[51:19] you caught up so what happened
[51:22] the word has taken on what flesh
[51:26] manifestation so amen
[51:30] it's in motion it's an action amen so
[51:34] what happens
[51:36] remember i started off the spiritual
[51:38] first
[51:41] the event is going to take place the
[51:43] rapture event

[56:44] and uh the time no man knows
[56:47] the time of the season i'll get back

[56:58] god is you know setting a little
[57:02] a stage here that you can understand
[57:04] that
[57:06] it's not just the time of the season
[57:11] but he want to zero in on a little bit
[57:13] more
[57:15] than that and remember when the
[57:18] disciples asked jesus
[57:22] as he said in the mount of olives and
[57:24] disciples came to him privately saying
[57:27] tell us when shall these things be
[57:30] what shall be the sign of thy coming and
[57:33] of the end of the world
[57:36] amen and he wanted he wanted to say take
[57:39] heed and no man deceive you man he
[57:41] should come in my name
[57:42] said i'm christ and shall deceive many
[57:45] and that's your
[57:46] here or walls and rumors of walls see
[57:49] that you be not troubled
[57:51] and then he said all these things amen
[57:55] should come to pass but the end is not
[57:57] yet nation should rise against nation
[57:59] and kingdom against kingdoms and
[58:00] he went on to say many things amen but i
[58:02] want to skip down to the 32.
[58:05] amen sometimes you can read the whole
[58:07] chapter amen
[58:09] it's a lot to be said as probably god
[58:11] opened up the seals and
[58:13] took this chapter and amen so by the
[58:16] grace of god
[58:16] you can look into those things it causes
[58:19] you to
[58:20] see if you if you don't uh you know if
[58:23] you want to pass
[58:24] some exam if you're going to be a nurse
[58:26] you're going to be a lawyer you're going
[58:27] to be a doctor you're going to be
[58:28] whatever
[58:29] you got exams you got to pass
[58:32] you got to be the bible says search the
[58:35] scriptures foreign you what
[58:38] you think you have eternal life a day or
[58:40] day to what
[58:41] he didn't hung him thirsty after writing
[58:43] to share what
[58:44] amen if you ain't got time for god then
[58:47] god don't have time to show you
[58:51] if you ain't got if you don't seek you
[58:53] you can't you can't find
[58:55] but he said he that seek
[58:59] amen knock and what
[59:02] but what happened if we just come to
[59:04] church and want somebody else to seek
[59:05] for you
[59:08] you want somebody else to study to show
[59:10] themselves to prove for you
[59:13] the bible says studies show not self
[59:15] approve
[59:17] unto god a word who needed not to be
[59:19] ashamed
[59:21] study amen so amen
[59:25] that you might be able to give an answer
[59:27] to every man concerning the hope that's
[59:29] in you
[59:30] are you with me see what happens to
[59:33] people they get too lazy
[59:35] in the spirit they got time for
[59:37] everything but they ain't got time
[59:39] to look into the word and and start lord

[59:49] you reveal yourself in your own word
[59:51] and lord reveal the word to me because
[59:54] that's where i'm gonna find you
[59:56] because god is hidden and simplicity
[59:59] revealed himself in the same
[1:00:01] amen with whom is the arm of the lord
[1:00:03] revealed
[1:00:06] amen for he should grow up as a tender
[1:00:09] plant and let the root out
[1:00:10] dry ground amen somebody got to seek
[1:00:14] amen somebody got a knock somebody got
[1:00:16] to stop all of
[1:00:17] this nonsense stuff and being caught up
[1:00:20] in everything but the word of god
[1:00:23] brother and sister it's time to get
[1:00:24] about our father business

[1:00:32] game who did this who did that
[1:00:34] and you know but when it come down our
[1:00:36] soul amen
[1:00:38] we seem to think somebody else gonna see
[1:00:40] about it
[1:00:47] he said martha martha you're in trouble
[1:00:49] about many things but mary
[1:00:51] cares about that thing amen it means the
[1:00:55] most
[1:00:57] amen she was that jesus feeding she was

[1:09:34] when israel they said israel had become
[1:09:37] a nation
[1:09:40] the prophet god said in 1946 the angel
[1:09:42] of the lord appeared to him
[1:09:45] they said israel back in their homeland
[1:09:48] gave him a ministry of a healing revival
[1:09:54] he went around the world praying for
[1:09:56] sick folk
[1:09:58] massive healing revivals all over the
[1:10:00] place
[1:10:02] god used him powerfully
[1:10:08] 1948 israel was declared a nation
[1:10:12] by the u.n the fig
[1:10:16] tree began to come forth israel had to
[1:10:19] come back
[1:10:20] the dry bones that ezekiel saw in
[1:10:22] ezekiel 37.
[1:10:23] son of man can these moans live he said
[1:10:26] lord god don't know it
[1:10:28] here he said the spirit of the lord
[1:10:32] took me up into a valley and it's full
[1:10:34] of bones
[1:10:36] and he said son of man kenny's bone live
[1:10:38] he said lord god died notice he said
[1:10:39] prophesy to the bones
[1:10:42] are you with me i said oh you dry bones
[1:10:45] hear the word of the lord that was
[1:10:46] israel
[1:10:48] became a seed in the green army are you
[1:10:50] with me
[1:10:51] he prophesied to the bones amen
[1:10:57] then he had to breathe on those wounds
[1:10:59] and breath had to come into him
[1:11:02] amen illegal become a nation again are
[1:11:04] you with me
[1:11:06] i don't have time see i told you i'll
[1:11:08] take hours hours
[1:11:10] because i got to do all of this to bring
[1:11:12] you up where you understand where you're
[1:11:13] at
[1:11:14] and how you're going to get from where
[1:11:16] you are now
[1:11:17] in the millennium ring praise god what
[1:11:20] you got to overcome in this day
[1:11:23] by understanding the word of god
[1:11:25] bringing you up to that time
[1:11:27] are you with me let's see where you at
[1:11:29] in the word i want you to see where
[1:11:31] you're at
[1:11:32] scripturally because most people read
[1:11:35] the bible
[1:11:36] it's written 2 000 years ago and they
[1:11:38] talk about
[1:11:39] 2 000 years ago but they don't know that
[1:11:42] things that pertaining to here and now
[1:11:48] when you see your place in you your name
[1:11:51] in the book
[1:11:52] then that amen causes you to be
[1:11:54] quickened
[1:11:55] mary saw her name in the book all she
[1:11:57] had it was the old testament
[1:11:59] and what isaiah said but her name was
[1:12:02] there
[1:12:02] in the book it meant nobody could read
[1:12:05] her name but she could read her own name
[1:12:10] are you with me because she knew who the
[1:12:12] virgin was
[1:12:15] amen why how did she know it was
[1:12:17] revealed to her
[1:12:19] by the angel gabriel amen
[1:12:23] and she believed what the angel said
[1:12:26] and that's what happens when the word
[1:12:28] begins to open to you as an individual
[1:12:31] it reveals your name
[1:12:34] are you up man and then you see your
[1:12:38] name and you see your day and you see
[1:12:39] what you are to
[1:12:40] manifest that's what peter stood up on
[1:12:43] the day of pentecost said this
[1:12:45] is that so he saw he meant
[1:12:48] joel and what he was prophesied of and
[1:12:51] he saw the action that took place on
[1:12:53] that day
[1:12:54] he said this is that which is spoken of
[1:12:56] by the prophet joe here
[1:12:59] and this is what he promised and in the
[1:13:00] last days i poured my spirit
[1:13:03] amen and this is dice oh you look man
[1:13:07] see he recognized that peter peter saw
[1:13:10] himself in the book
[1:13:12] are you with me now his name wasn't
[1:13:14] there in joel
[1:13:15] 2 30 but he saw his name there that he
[1:13:18] knew who
[1:13:19] it was pertaining to him so he said
[1:13:22] peter
[1:13:24] now the rest of the world russell folk
[1:13:26] couldn't see peter but peter saw peter
[1:13:29] amen and that's what you got to see you
[1:13:31] got to see this is a personal revelation
[1:13:33] to you
[1:13:34] as an individual you must see
[1:13:38] who you are for yourself and the bride
[1:13:42] recognize who she
[1:13:42] is then the rapture will take place now
[1:13:46] you can be caught up now or you can wait
[1:13:48] around and thinking that
[1:13:49] amen when the lord's cracked the sky
[1:13:52] that you're going to go
[1:13:54] how are you going to go when you don't
[1:13:55] know who you are
[1:13:59] are you with me but when you recognize
[1:14:02] who you
[1:14:02] are amen then god amen you know that it
[1:14:05] pertaining to you
[1:14:08] are you with me
[1:14:16] you know i feel like just taking on a
[1:14:18] saturday
[1:14:20] and let's just teach on this you all eat
[1:14:23] lunch and
[1:14:24] come on back another couple hours but
[1:14:28] maybe another time but let me
[1:14:31] let me go down here he says
[1:14:37] you know that some are not even at the
[1:14:38] door and so forth
[1:14:41] the summit
[1:14:44] is nine 33rd verse says and likewise ye
[1:14:48] when you see the
[1:14:49] all these things know that it is near
[1:14:52] even at the door
[1:14:53] verily verily i say unto you this what
[1:14:58] the generation that's why it says
[1:15:00] generations 40 years that's why
[1:15:01] everybody looked for the coming of the
[1:15:03] lord in 88.
[1:15:04] the jews everybody over in the church
[1:15:06] world and all the people that
[1:15:08] study bible prophecy was looking for a
[1:15:11] generation supposed to be 40 years
[1:15:13] in 88 everybody was looking for the
[1:15:14] rapture or the coming of the lord in the
[1:15:17] millennium
[1:15:18] in the coming of the tribulation period
[1:15:20] ushering in and so forth
[1:15:22] the whole nine yards amen
[1:15:25] but what happened
[1:15:28] somebody you were you were you hadn't
[1:15:31] got in yet
[1:15:33] it was because of you it was because of
[1:15:36] praise god hallelujah maybe i wasn't
[1:15:40] ready
[1:15:41] are you with me god had to you know
[1:15:44] he had to he had to get some rough hands
[1:15:46] out of your life
[1:15:48] he had to get some wrinkles some spots
[1:15:50] and some blemishes out
[1:15:52] he had that last predestinated seed to
[1:15:54] get in and he had to wait on that one
[1:15:57] was he waiting on you amen you said i
[1:16:00] wasn't born that's why he waited he
[1:16:02] waited till you got
[1:16:03] born you said i wanted to say that he
[1:16:05] waited for you
[1:16:08] praise god aren't you glad he waited
[1:16:11] because he could have came in 88 and you
[1:16:13] could have been out
[1:16:16] but he waited
[1:16:20] are you with me
[1:16:23] so he says this generation should not
[1:16:27] uh pass to all these things be fulfilled
[1:16:30] heaven and earth shall pass away but my
[1:16:33] words shall not what
[1:16:38] but uh john this is where i want to get
