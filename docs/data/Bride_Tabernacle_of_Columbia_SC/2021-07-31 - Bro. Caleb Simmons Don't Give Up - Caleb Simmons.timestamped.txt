[28:45] chapter
[28:54] we'll start at the fifth verse
[29:07] that's exodus chapter 14 and we'll begin
[29:09] reading that the fifth verse
[29:13] when you gotta say amen amen
[29:17] exodus chapter 14 the fifth starting at
[29:19] the fifth verse
[29:21] and it was told the king of egypt that
[29:22] the people fled
[29:24] and the heart of pharaoh and of his
[29:26] servants was turned against the people
[29:28] and they said why have we done this
[29:32] that we have let israel go from serving
[29:34] us
[29:35] and he made ready his cherry and took
[29:37] his people
[29:38] with him and he took 600 chosen chariots
[29:42] and all the chariots of egypt and
[29:45] captains over every one of them
[29:47] and the lord hardened the heart of
[29:48] pharaoh king of egypt
[29:50] and he pursued after the children of
[29:52] israel
[29:53] and the children of israel went out with
[29:55] a high hand
[29:57] but the egyptians pursued after them all
[30:00] the horses
[30:00] and chariots of pharaoh and his horsemen
[30:03] in his army
[30:04] and overtook them and camping by the sea
[30:07] besides
[30:12] before bow zephan
[30:15] bill zephan and when pharaoh drew not
[30:17] the children of israel lifted up their
[30:18] eyes
[30:19] and behold the egyptians marched after
[30:21] them and they were so afraid
[30:24] and the children of israel cried out
[30:26] unto the lord
[30:27] and they said unto moses because there
[30:30] were no grace in egypt
[30:31] has thou taken us away to die in the
[30:33] wilderness
[30:34] wherefore has thou dealt with us to
[30:37] carry us forth out of egypt
[30:40] is not the is not this the word that we
[30:44] did tell thee
[30:45] in egypt saying let us alone that we may
[30:47] serve the egyptians
[30:49] for it has been better for us to serve
[30:51] the egyptian than that we shall die in
[30:53] the wilderness
[30:54] and moses said unto the people fear ye
[30:56] not
[30:57] stand still and see the salvation of the
[30:59] lord which he will show
[31:02] to you today for the egyptians whom you
[31:05] have seen today
[31:06] you shall see them again no again no
[31:09] more forever
[31:11] the lord shall fight for you and ye
[31:13] shall hold your peace
[31:14] amen god bless to read another word you
[31:17] may be seated
[31:20] amen on tonight we'd like to take a
[31:22] little topic
[31:25] don't give up amen don't give up
[31:29] in this story the prelude to the story
[31:32] the children of issue where
[31:34] children of israel had been in bondage
[31:36] in egypt for over 400 years and they
[31:38] were serving pharaoh
[31:40] but one day god sent them a deliverer
[31:43] he sent moses back to his people to
[31:45] deliver his people
[31:47] and after many plagues that god had
[31:49] dealt on the egyptians
[31:51] the pharaoh finally let god's people go
[31:55] but on the way going he he realized what
[31:59] a mistake he had made
[32:01] and so he went after the children of
[32:02] israel and he found them by
[32:06] mountains on ones mountains on the right
[32:08] mountains on the left
[32:10] and the sea in front of them he said i
[32:11] got him boxed in now and so he went uh
[32:14] he went up and he thought he was going
[32:17] he was going to overtake him and put him
[32:18] back in slavery but god came
[32:21] before reading the scripture of his
[32:24] moses
[32:25] moses went to the lord and the lord said
[32:27] why cry to me he said speak
[32:29] and he went to the he went to he went to
[32:32] deliver his people
[32:33] but god had a plan but the people was
[32:35] ready to give up
[32:37] they was ready they came to that point
[32:38] they said you should have left me in
[32:40] egypt
[32:41] where i could have just served pharaoh
[32:42] to the end of my days and died
[32:44] in egypt in peace but god wanted
[32:47] something better
[32:49] and they but they was at that point they
[32:51] said we could have just we should have
[32:52] just gave up
[32:53] but they couldn't see that god never
[32:55] gave up on them
[32:56] and so they they got to that point they
[32:58] said we sh we could have
[33:00] but moses said fear not stand still and
[33:03] see the salvation of the lord
[33:05] because the egyptians that you see this
[33:07] day you'll never see them again
[33:09] amen and it goes on in verse 14 it said
[33:11] the lord
[33:12] shall fight for you so they didn't even
[33:15] have to fight they never lifted a hand a
[33:17] sword
[33:18] no instrument or weapon against the
[33:20] egyptians
[33:22] god went on this story progressed that
[33:24] god drowned them all in the red sea
[33:26] while they walked away on dry
[33:28] ground and they said they would take
[33:29] that testament to
[33:31] with them for generations and
[33:33] generations until this time
[33:35] but the moral that i wanted to come to
[33:37] is that
[33:38] that no matter what the circumstances
[33:40] look like you can't give up
[33:42] no matter how bad it looks mountains on
[33:45] the right mountains on the left
[33:47] and the sea in front of you and the
[33:48] pharaoh behind you you can't give up
[33:50] because god always has that plan for you
[33:53] amen and when we look at the different
[33:56] instances in the
[33:57] in the bible that the lord drew me to
[33:59] that show me
[34:00] uh what happens if you don't give up
[34:04] if you go to second let's turn to second
[34:06] kings
[34:07] chapter two
[34:12] second kings chapter two
[34:15] and we'll start at verse one
[34:21] when you gotta say amen
[34:26] amen second kings chapter two
[34:30] and it came to pass when the lord would
[34:32] take up elijah into heaven
[34:34] by a whirlwind that that elijah went
[34:36] with elisha from gilgal
[34:39] and elijah said unto elisha terry here i
[34:42] pray thee for the lord hath sent me
[34:44] to bethel and elisha said unto him as
[34:46] the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth
[34:49] i will not legally leave thee so they
[34:51] went down the bethel
[34:53] and the sons of the prophets that were
[34:54] at bethel came forth to elisha and said
[34:57] unto him knowest thou that the lord will
[34:59] take away thy master from thee from thy
[35:02] head today
[35:03] he said yes i know it hold ye your peace
[35:06] and elijah said unto him elisha terry
[35:09] here i pray thee for the lord has sent
[35:11] me to
[35:12] has sent me to jericho and he said as
[35:14] the lord liveth
[35:16] and as my and as thy soul live it i will
[35:18] not
[35:19] leave thee so they came to so they came
[35:21] to jericho
[35:22] and the sons of the prophet that were at
[35:24] jericho came to elisha and said unto him
[35:26] noah style that the lord will take away
[35:29] thy master
[35:30] from thy head today and he answered yea
[35:32] i know it
[35:33] hold ye your peace and elijah said unto
[35:36] him
[35:37] terry i pray thee here for the lord has
[35:40] said unto
[35:41] sent me to jordan and he said as the
[35:43] lord liveth and as thy soul liveth
[35:45] i will not lead thee and they went to
[35:48] and they too went on and fifty men of
[35:51] the soul
[35:53] of the sons of the prophets went and
[35:55] stood to view afar
[35:56] off and they too stood by jordan and
[35:59] elijah took his mantle and wrapped it
[36:01] together and smoked the waters
[36:04] and they were divided hither and thinner
[36:06] so that they
[36:07] too went over on dry ground and it came
[36:10] to pass when they were going over that
[36:12] elijah
[36:13] said unto elisha ask what i shall do for
[36:16] thee
[36:17] before i be taken away from thee and
[36:19] elijah
[36:20] and elisha said i pray thee let a double
[36:23] portion of thy spirit
[36:25] be upon me he said thou has asked a hard
[36:28] thing nevertheless
[36:29] if thou see me when i am taken away from
[36:32] thee
[36:32] it shall be so unto thee but if not it
[36:35] shall not be so
[36:36] amen in the scripture if you look at it
[36:40] elijah knew that he was going home it
[36:42] was his time his
[36:43] his ministry at india elijah knew not
[36:46] only him but the prophets that every
[36:48] time they went to a city
[36:49] or a place they knew and they asked
[36:51] elijah like why are you going on you
[36:53] know he's going to die
[36:55] why you keep following him if you know
[36:56] that he's going to die but elijah
[36:59] he never gave up because he wanted
[37:00] something he wanted something from
[37:03] he knew that he had a desire and he
[37:05] wanted something
[37:06] if he would have gave up the first time
[37:08] he would have never got what he wanted
[37:10] well he had other people trying to
[37:11] convince him say why
[37:13] why why you keep going with him why you
[37:15] keep pressing on
[37:16] don't you know he going to die and he
[37:18] said
[37:19] hold your peace yes i know but hold your
[37:22] peace
[37:23] because elijah knew elisha knew that he
[37:26] wanted something
[37:27] he had a desire that he wanted to
[37:29] fulfill and it wasn't finished yet
[37:31] so he kept going the next city he came
[37:33] to and elijah said stay there elisha
[37:36] even
[37:37] elijah even told elisha to stay there
[37:40] and elijah said i'll tear you on as your
[37:42] soul living
[37:43] i'll keep moving on with you wherever
[37:45] you go i'm going
[37:46] and a lot and elisha kept following them
[37:48] until
[37:49] elijah finally got to the place where he
[37:51] was to go home
[37:53] and he said basically he paraphrasing he
[37:56] was basically like what do you desire
[37:59] and elisha told him i want a double
[38:01] portion so
[38:02] many times we get to the point the
[38:05] prophet of god said and anytime we get
[38:07] to the point
[38:08] where we have we have our deliverance or
[38:11] our healing
[38:11] but we give up we give up believing we
[38:14] give up
[38:15] trusting that we have it we give up with
[38:18] having that faith that is there that we
[38:20] have that god has given it to us
[38:23] all we have to do is believe he said if
[38:25] you can only get the people to delete
[38:27] to believe that all things are possible
[38:29] so if you had the faith of a mustard
[38:31] seed it can move mountains
[38:33] so you can't give up for what you want
[38:35] and what you ask god for
[38:37] because if it's his will nothing can
[38:39] stop can stop it from happening amen
[38:42] and elijah in this elijah he pressed on
[38:45] because he wanted he had that desire if
[38:47] you go to the book of genesis chapter 32
[38:50] you read about jacob and his brother
[38:52] esau jacob had wronged his brother esau
[38:55] and
[38:55] he was finally going to meet him for for
[38:58] for a
[38:58] final time for another time and he
[39:01] hadn't seen him in years and
[39:02] jacob was afraid jacob was afraid but
[39:05] one night the angel the lord visited him
[39:08] and a lot and jacob realized he said i'm
[39:11] not
[39:11] i'm not letting go of this uh of this
[39:14] angel
[39:14] i'm not letting go until till something
[39:16] happen so elijah wrestling elijah
[39:19] wrestle
[39:21] jacob russell my bad jacob wrestler and
[39:24] he wrestled
[39:25] with the angel and he kept wrestling
[39:27] with him but he wouldn't let him go in
[39:29] there
[39:29] and the angel implored him he said he
[39:32] said let me go so
[39:33] the day is coming the sun is getting
[39:35] ready to rise the day is coming
[39:37] and a lot and jacob said i'm not letting
[39:40] go until you bless me
[39:43] he said you can hurt me he smote him on
[39:45] the thigh but he said i'm not letting go
[39:47] until you bless me
[39:48] no matter what you do what come my way
[39:50] i'm not letting it go
[39:52] until you bless me and sometimes you
[39:54] have to take that to the lord lord
[39:56] i can't let go until something happened
[39:58] in these situations and these things
[40:00] that are rising in my life
[40:02] lord i can't let go until something
[40:03] happened if i let go too early it's not
[40:06] going to happen anyways
[40:07] so what do i have to lose i have nothing
[40:10] to lose but i continue to fight
[40:12] i have nothing to lose but i continue to
[40:14] pray i had nothing to lose but i
[40:15] continue to say thank you
[40:17] nothing to lose to give you glory and
[40:19] give you praise because
[40:21] what i've seen you already do i know
[40:23] that you the same yesterday
[40:25] today and forever and he's able and more
[40:28] more than able to do exceedingly
[40:30] abundantly than water we can ask the
[40:32] thing
[40:33] so if you go on in the scriptures
[40:35] there's even more
[40:37] where in first corinthian paul urges us
[40:39] to be steadfast
[40:40] unmovable always abiding in the word of
[40:43] the lord
[40:45] amen and just holding on to
[40:48] what god has promised us there's so much
[40:51] so many things that sometimes we miss
[40:54] all the benefits
[40:55] we miss some of them because we don't
[40:58] hold on long enough to
[40:59] to trust god to do it we don't hold on
[41:02] and we don't stay there and stay
[41:03] steadfast
[41:04] on our knees and say lord till you get
[41:06] that breakthrough
[41:07] you stay steadfast there until god start
[41:10] moving and you see the changes
[41:12] you start seeing things happen before
[41:15] you you start seeing those people come
[41:17] back and turn
[41:18] fr and turn back and you see god start
[41:21] to do things
[41:22] and you said lord i can't give up
[41:24] because what you've done
[41:25] for me i know you can do it for someone
[41:27] else i what you what you've already
[41:30] displayed
[41:31] and people around me and people in the
[41:33] in the midst of
[41:34] in the midst in the sanctuary with the
[41:37] church of god i know that you can do it
[41:38] for someone else
[41:40] so i i put my faith i put my trust in
[41:42] you
[41:43] because i know that you are you are able
[41:45] god you never failed
[41:46] and you said that your word can't turn
[41:48] return to your void
[41:51] abraham in the bible he had to wait 25
[41:53] years on his promise
[41:56] with people coming against him and
[41:57] saying why you believe in that
[41:59] that's just a figment of your
[42:01] imagination that ain't happening
[42:02] i can imagine the things the many things
[42:04] that people tried to tell him and
[42:06] convince him
[42:08] that it wasn't gonna happen that it
[42:11] wasn't he wasn't gonna have that
[42:12] promised son
[42:14] abraham had to wait 25 years
[42:18] sometimes it's hard for us to wait 10
[42:20] minutes that's 25 years
[42:23] of something that you know that god has
[42:25] told you
[42:26] and people coming around everywhere you
[42:28] move they saying you show
[42:30] you sure i don't see it happening yet
[42:32] you said you're going to be the father
[42:33] of many nations
[42:35] how how are you going to be that one and
[42:38] you don't have a c
[42:39] you don't have a child but yet abraham
[42:42] stayed
[42:43] fast he held on to the to the word
[42:46] that the lord gave him and he said and
[42:49] he proved it and he said i'm going to
[42:51] hold on
[42:52] until it happened come what may come say
[42:55] whatever you want
[42:57] i believe that god has placed me here
[42:59] and he chose me
[43:00] to do this he chose me it wasn't nobody
[43:03] else that he came and gave that word to
[43:05] it was only meant for abraham so god so
[43:09] god knew that abraham was going gonna be
[43:11] able
[43:12] to to hold on to that word and even
[43:15] god tested him later when when isaac was
[43:18] born
[43:20] he he tells him to go take him up and to
[43:22] offer him as a sacrifice
[43:24] and abraham almost came close to
[43:27] to to sacrifice knowledge but god put a
[43:30] ram in the bush
[43:31] he never gave up on that promise that
[43:33] lord you said that i was going to be the
[43:36] the father of many nations and he kept
[43:39] holding on to that
[43:40] he kept believing that that no matter
[43:43] what i'm not going to give up
[43:45] i can't give up because god has given
[43:47] this to me
[43:48] and he has positioned me for this each
[43:51] and every one of us i think that god
[43:53] could have put us in any time
[43:55] in any age in any space but he put us
[43:58] here now
[44:00] because god knew that we'd be able to to
[44:02] stand this test that god has given to us
[44:04] in this age
[44:05] and i think that sometimes you wonder
[44:08] and
[44:09] then sometimes you look around and say
[44:11] lord why me
[44:13] but i can't study on that because god
[44:15] placed me here
[44:17] if you know that that you're standing on
[44:19] him and he
[44:20] and you talking to him and he's talking
[44:22] to you and god has placed you here
[44:24] then you can't give up on the journey
[44:26] the journey gets rough sometimes
[44:28] the journey gets hard and sometimes the
[44:31] devil all he does
[44:32] is he doesn't have to do big things he
[44:34] just has to place a seed of doubt
[44:37] just one small seed of doubt where you
[44:40] doubt one thing and then it becomes
[44:42] infinitely easier
[44:44] it becomes a whole lot easier to doubt
[44:45] something else
[44:47] but in in you have to stay with the word
[44:49] of god stay with the bible
[44:51] and take everything back through the
[44:53] bible if it ain't in there then then
[44:55] leave it alone
[44:56] if if there's nothing but the word of
[44:59] god i can say yes and amen to it
[45:02] amen because i can't give up on god and
[45:05] what he has sent for me
[45:06] it may not be for everybody but i know
[45:09] that the lord has
[45:10] positionally emplaced us in this in this
[45:12] age that we can
[45:14] continue to hold on and not give up
[45:16] he'll continue to
[45:17] give us the word of god that encourage
[45:19] us and
[45:20] push us forward and allow us to see more
[45:23] and more lord
[45:24] what you're doing for us and bringing
[45:27] forth the signs and the wonders
[45:29] so lord we can see you moving in our
[45:30] midst we can see that you working
[45:33] and you're doing great things not small
[45:35] things
[45:36] so sometimes we we get small-minded
[45:40] we we limit god not god limited us we
[45:43] limit god and say
[45:44] well lord i only want this and it'd be a
[45:47] small
[45:48] when we we should ask for the big things
[45:51] we should ask for the big things and
[45:53] hold them
[45:53] and hold on to it and ask god lord
[45:56] i know that you've done it before so why
[45:58] not me
[46:00] why not me why can't i why can't i i
[46:03] receive
[46:04] what what you've given because you
[46:06] promised it
[46:07] if you promised blessings they there
[46:10] they there they sitting up there and
[46:12] they just waiting on me
[46:13] to get ready to receive it i got to be
[46:15] in the place in the space that god has
[46:17] put me in so that i can receive it i got
[46:19] to be positionally placed
[46:21] in in the in the will for my life for
[46:24] that god has planned
[46:25] so that i can receive what god has given
[46:27] but i can't give up
[46:29] i can't give up yeah you may not be
[46:31] where you want to be but
[46:32] sometimes you look back and say i i'm
[46:34] not where i was
[46:36] but god if i keep continue to following
[46:38] you and not giving up on you
[46:40] you continue to push me forward you
[46:43] continue to place me where you want me
[46:45] to be
[46:45] so that i can receive what you've chosen
[46:48] for me in this life
[46:49] because god you're the same yesterday
[46:52] today
[46:52] and forever and i can hold on to that
[46:55] till eternity
[46:56] that you guide you the same yesterday
[46:59] today and forever
[47:00] and there's nothing that i can do
[47:02] nothing that anybody can say
[47:04] because when you know that god is real
[47:06] for yourself you
[47:07] you know that god has has done some
[47:09] things for you you can look forward to
[47:11] what he's going to do
[47:13] what he's going to be able to do in
[47:14] other people's lives even around you
[47:17] says sometimes i've seen it even in my
[47:20] life even recently
[47:21] while i've seen god bless me but bless
[47:24] everyone around me
[47:25] you want to be in a position where god
[47:28] not only bless you he blesses everyone
[47:31] they said the many kings that said
[47:34] abraham lot got blessed because of
[47:36] abraham by being under his bosom he got
[47:39] blessed because of him
[47:40] he said i if i don't give up maybe
[47:43] that'll encourage someone else not to
[47:45] give up
[47:46] maybe god has me sometimes all it takes
[47:48] is a small light
[47:50] to shine in the darkness it only takes a
[47:52] spark to light up to light up a whole
[47:54] room
[47:55] sometimes that's what you got you got to
[47:58] keep that in mind when you're walking in
[47:59] places walking into work walking in the
[48:01] store
[48:02] lord shine the light in the darkness
[48:04] because the world is dark
[48:06] there's a lot there's a lot of darkness
[48:08] everywhere you go
[48:09] it's darkness but lord if i can bring a
[48:11] little little bit of light
[48:13] shine a little bit of light encourage
[48:15] somebody push somebody forward
[48:17] lord sometimes it's not all about going
[48:20] and
[48:21] getting and forcing the word down to
[48:24] somebody
[48:25] sometimes it's just showing them
[48:26] kindness showing them some love showing
[48:29] them that somebody care
[48:31] somebody is out there somebody actually
[48:34] god placed me on your heart i just
[48:36] wanted to see how you were doing
[48:38] and sometimes i said all the time people
[48:41] may not remember
[48:42] what you buy them people may not
[48:44] remember all the things that they do but
[48:46] they will remember
[48:47] how you treated them they always will
[48:49] remember how you treated them
[48:51] and it caused me to look back and say
[48:53] lord i want every interaction that i had
[48:56] to reflect you every single interaction
[49:00] sometimes you know you look back and you
[49:02] say lord i'm sorry i didn't respond
[49:04] right
[49:05] lord i'm sorry i didn't i didn't do that
[49:07] right but lord
[49:08] let me allow me to to show
[49:11] that that you are inside of me and that
[49:13] you're working
[49:14] and that if i don't give up and you
[49:17] continue to work
[49:18] you'll mold me and make me to everything
[49:20] that you want me to be
[49:28] amen
[49:42] okay
[49:47] praise god god is good amen
[49:53] we thank the lord we manage not to give
[49:57] up
[49:57] amen no matter what comes to what goes
[50:01] where
[50:02] not to give up on god amen
[50:05] we're in a day where so many of the
[50:07] bible says in the
[50:09] that there'll be a a great fall in the
[50:12] way
[50:14] so many people will give up he said
[50:16] times
[50:17] would come amen
[50:20] men would love the world more than they
[50:21] would love god
[50:23] and he says in second thessalonians
[50:27] he's talked about the great fall in the
[50:30] way amen
[50:33] and um that's what is happening you know
[50:36] so many people
[50:37] they don't want to they don't want to
[50:38] come to church no more
[50:40] and people are struggling to come to
[50:42] church the god that they say they love
[50:46] the god that they say they love but
[50:50] other things are getting in in people's
[50:52] way they just
[50:53] seem as though the devil is so crafty
[50:56] he's so tricky that he's deceiving so
[51:00] many people
[51:01] by letting other things get in front of
[51:04] god
[51:04] you know god actually do small things
[51:08] like forsake not to simulate ourselves
[51:10] together a little small thing
[51:12] but you know when it comes down to the
[51:14] end of the road
[51:16] god knew if he accessed to do that he
[51:18] said that i'll be in the midst
[51:20] that's what he that's where he wants to
[51:21] bless us amen when we come together
[51:24] you know what you know people you know
[51:26] when they got out
[51:28] when everybody shut in and they couldn't
[51:30] go to the beach and they couldn't go to
[51:32] the
[51:32] nightclub and they couldn't go party
[51:34] like they used to
[51:36] see that it's in a human being
[51:40] to want you know fellowship
[51:43] so even those four folks out there in
[51:46] the world they want to go to the ball
[51:48] game and they want to be together
[51:50] they just don't want to you know be shut
[51:52] up in the house and
[51:54] watching the ball game they want a
[51:56] fellowship
[51:57] amen so it's in us to do that but god
[52:01] satan meets them there give them the
[52:04] joy that the pledges of the world they
[52:07] do things
[52:08] they meant to get in the spirit of the
[52:10] world and
[52:12] but that's all they have the pledges of
[52:15] sin for
[52:16] season but god amen when the people of
[52:19] god come together
[52:21] they make god promise our being to miss
[52:24] so it's very important that we not give
[52:26] up on god
[52:30] he says he says that um
[52:38] now we beseech your brethren by the
[52:40] coming of the lord
[52:42] and by our gathering together unto him
[52:46] that you be not soon that second
[52:49] thessalonians two
[52:50] and two that you may not soon shaken in
[52:53] mind
[52:55] or be troubled neither by spirit nor by
[52:59] word
[53:01] not by letter as from us as that day
[53:05] of christ is at hand
[53:09] let no man deceive you by any means
[53:12] for except for that day
[53:15] shall not come except there be a what
[53:20] falling away first it's not only a
[53:23] falling away from
[53:25] coming to church it's a falling away
[53:28] from the word of god
[53:31] people don't want to live the word they
[53:33] don't want to obey the word anymore
[53:36] so they're some folks that come to
[53:38] church but they won't obey
[53:40] when god said come and be glad when you
[53:43] come they don't come glad
[53:45] they come saying so that's a you know
[53:48] when we come and do what god says
[53:50] then that's where the blessings fall but
[53:53] we when we battle and we're doing
[53:55] everything we can do to get there
[53:57] and when we get there we about wow after
[53:59] we get there
[54:00] but when he says you know coming for
[54:05] his uh courts with praises and with
[54:08] thanksgiving
[54:09] energy scopes with you know praise
[54:12] and when we come with that kind of mind
[54:15] the whole atmosphere is illuminated by
[54:17] your but
[54:18] by your attitude you know the atmosphere
[54:22] is so illuminated so things begin to
[54:24] happen for you
[54:26] amen not happening over there you know
[54:30] you know the the crowd can get
[54:33] electrified
[54:34] if one person is enthused you know what
[54:37] i'm saying
[54:38] the whole the whole audience gets
[54:41] electrified by one person
[54:43] being excited about jesus one person
[54:45] just happy to be saved
[54:48] then it left the whole crowd
[54:51] it don't take a whole lot of people to
[54:53] be glad
[54:54] to be in the house of the lord just take
[54:56] one when you got one that's glad to be
[54:59] there
[54:59] amen it can be a hundred the struggling
[55:03] but when one is glad it can strengthen
[55:05] everybody
[55:06] and that's what i was dealing with i
[55:08] might well i didn't want to get into it
[55:11] the day when i was out and just praying
[55:13] and meditating on the lord
[55:15] and i and i said you know
[55:18] when all israel was afraid
[55:21] everybody was afraid in israel
[55:25] it didn't take but one little young boy
[55:28] when they were faced with the the giant
[55:32] that got everybody scared
[55:36] it didn't take but one little boy
[55:39] that didn't even know how to fight
[55:43] like all those trained soldiers one
[55:46] little boy just
[55:47] heard goliath and heard his threats
[55:52] but this one little boy
[55:56] all he had was a slain and five stones
[56:01] but he wasn't you know it's something
