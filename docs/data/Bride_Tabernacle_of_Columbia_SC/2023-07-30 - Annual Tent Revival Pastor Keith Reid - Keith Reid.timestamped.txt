[0:00] and God bless you
[0:03] I'm glad to be in the presence of God
[0:07] amen
[0:09] praise God
[0:12] and may I also
[0:14] greet you on behalf of my family
[0:17] and the church back home
[0:20] who are listening to us this evening
[0:23] the spoken word Tabernacle and to you I
[0:26] said God bless you
[0:28] thank you for praying for me
[0:31] in Saint Luke chapter 4
[0:34] and verse 18.
[0:38] let me read from verse 16.
[0:41] and he came to Nazareth
[0:44] where he had been brought up
[0:46] and as his custom was he went into the
[0:49] synagogue on the Sabbath day
[0:53] and so stood up for to read
[0:56] and there was delivered unto him the
[0:59] book of the prophet azzar
[1:01] and when he had opened the book
[1:04] he found the place
[1:06] where it was written
[1:09] the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:13] because he has anointed me to preach
[1:19] the gospel to the poor
[1:22] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[1:26] to preach Deliverance to the captives
[1:30] the recovering of the sight of the blind
[1:34] and to set at Liberty
[1:36] them
[1:37] there are bruise
[1:39] to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:44] Lord says and he closed the book
[1:48] and he gave it again to the minister
[1:51] and sat down
[1:53] and the eyes of all them that were in
[1:56] the synagogue were fastened on him
[1:59] and he began to say unto them this day
[2:04] is this scripture fulfilled
[2:07] in your years
[2:09] then over in Saint Luke Chapter 7
[2:21] and verse 36
[2:25] and one of the Pharisees desire him
[2:30] that he would eat with them
[2:33] and he went into the Pharisees house and
[2:36] sat down to meet
[2:39] and behold a woman in the city
[2:43] which was a sinner
[2:46] when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in
[2:50] the Pharisees also
[2:52] brought in an alabaster box of ointment
[2:56] and stood At His Feet behind him
[3:00] weeping and begin to wash his feet with
[3:03] her tears
[3:04] and it wiped them with the hair of her
[3:07] head and kiss his feet and anoint them
[3:11] with the ointment
[3:13] now when the Pharisee which
[3:16] had been him saw it
[3:20] he spoke within himself I want you to
[3:23] know that he speak within himself
[3:28] saying this man
[3:31] if he were a prophet
[3:34] he would have known who and what manner
[3:38] of woman this is
[3:40] that touch him
[3:42] for she is a sinner may the Lord that is
[3:46] blessing to the reading of the word you
[3:48] may be seated
[3:54] you know I'd like to speak on
[3:57] setting the captive free
[4:00] setting the captive free
[4:05] you know there's
[4:07] passage of scripture is
[4:10] it's there and said Matthew
[4:12] it's also there in Mark and here Dr Luke
[4:16] also write about it
[4:19] and I'd like to say it's not a parable
[4:22] it is something that actually happened
[4:24] to the Lord Jesus
[4:27] that is something that they're known
[4:30] and the the gospel amen It Was Written
[4:34] there
[4:36] and here it was this woman amen as Luke
[4:40] said for she was a woman of the city
[4:43] and she was a sinner
[4:47] and here it is we talk about her and him
[4:51] in that day when she met Jesus
[4:54] but I'd like to go amen before this day
[4:58] when she meet Jesus
[5:01] you see I'd like to they may get down to
[5:03] the point
[5:05] because what is happening to us today it
[5:08] never started today
[5:12] I would like to look back at him and the
[5:16] kind of upbringing she could have had
[5:18] amen the kind of young girl him and she
[5:22] was
[5:23] amen you know I'd like to him and pray
[5:26] to pray to this evening and see if we
[5:29] can see ourselves in the light of the
[5:32] scripture
[5:33] remember the Bible said that women here
[5:36] she bought the assignment amen that was
[5:39] very costly and she came and she brought
[5:41] it to Jesus remember she was a sinner
[5:45] woman then we said what kind of woman
[5:47] she was amen what I brought her to this
[5:50] point they may not like to say that
[5:53] might be him and this young girl had
[5:55] grown up in a Christian home
[6:17] amen made a commitment but we were not
[6:20] committed
[6:23] amen is sad to say but it's just the
[6:27] truth maybe that many times they mean
[6:30] what we see on the street they mean it
[6:32] never started I'm in there on the skin
[6:34] row remember in many Christian homes in
[6:38] the refiner Hallelujah little children
[6:40] remember parents are amen somehow might
[6:44] be not knowing later they may be let
[6:46] down the bars
[6:53] we need to be careful
[6:56] how about the entrance and the great
[6:58] ways amen that we have set amen that sin
[7:03] amen and
[7:05] Spirits can enter into homes
[7:08] [Music]
[7:16] that we can and about many times I think
[7:19] they mean that we miss her spiritual
[7:22] discernment
[7:24] aiming our life they may never started
[7:28] where you saw it
[7:30] remembered from a guru bringing her
[7:32] remember something began to happen they
[7:35] made something Hallelujah begin to
[7:37] change within the framework of the home
[7:41] amen amen might be this girl maybe you
[7:46] look at a woman today and you said ah
[7:48] what a prostitute remember if you find
[7:51] out I'm an exact way that started they
[7:55] may not be the framework of the church
[7:57] they mean she was molested amen I've
[8:01] talked I'm sitting there in the office
[8:03] hey man I've talked to many young people
[8:05] amen many mothers today they meant
[8:08] somewhere within their lives amen they
[8:11] were torture inappropriately they mean
[8:14] something has happened they may have
[8:16] lost confidence they mean in the pastor
[8:19] they met many times women new parents
[8:22] are they mean the way you speak in your
[8:25] homes about the ministry name it about
[8:27] the preacher amen you criticize her and
[8:30] you condemn her even the children are
[8:33] picking up that spirit
[8:38] and tomorrow you can flip over like an
[8:41] hippocrator remember what you're saying
[8:44] they made us Edge in their mind living
[8:47] in US carve their consensus amen and
[8:50] it's gonna come to something tomorrow
[8:55] Hallelujah
[8:57] and we wonder sometimes anymore people
[9:00] hallelujah who are one sir hey man hold
[9:03] going and him and jovial and joyful amen
[9:07] they've come to a stage with her it
[9:09] seemed like they've lost the joy of
[9:12] their salvation they may have lost their
[9:15] days amen when they used to have joy in
[9:19] the word of God and then when they could
[9:21] trust one another they remember all that
[9:23] is gone amen why because something
[9:26] happened
[9:28] a young man a young girl who has turned
[9:32] to homosexuality
[9:34] then you trace that back somewhere amen
[9:38] and something happened amen that was a
[9:41] very nuclear of where they are today are
[9:45] you there with me
[9:46] not many things are going to be taboo
[9:49] amen but you might as well say Amen
[9:51] because I'm going to preach tonight
[9:54] Hallelujah and I'm gonna preach what God
[9:57] puts on my heart aiming to preacher amen
[10:01] it is sad to say and in that many who
[10:04] claim the Holy Ghost they may have
[10:06] walked out of the way of the word
[10:08] hallelujah and I've done things they may
[10:11] just power the Next Generation now they
[10:13] may not tell you I'm encourage her then
[10:15] when I see young people they may begin
[10:17] to testify you amen today of the
[10:20] goodness of God Amen many today maybe
[10:24] they're right there in church they can't
[10:26] praise the Lord they may they can't say
[10:29] amen amen because there's a conscience
[10:32] amen that is nearby sinner amen and
[10:35] every time they would have rise up amen
[10:37] the devil is right there to tell them
[10:39] and you can't praise the Lord you've got
[10:42] nothing to praise about her even because
[10:45] of what is in your life
[10:52] you'll find out today
[10:54] many young girls who have been scarred
[10:58] it's because of a Hunker
[11:01] a father
[11:03] and I'm sick with young people
[11:06] whose parents are our ministers
[11:09] Hallelujah but men Hallelujah follow
[11:12] their children
[11:15] and that power is right there
[11:18] and they saw Glory but he come to Center
[11:22] the captain free
[11:25] Hallelujah and then somebody would look
[11:28] at this young girl aiming that she began
[11:30] to change and said a no long time there
[11:34] was nothing in her but nobody tried to
[11:37] go back and to find out the cause nor
[11:41] may I say this to you women are young a
[11:44] woman standing aiming on the platform
[11:46] before the propheter amen she had a
[11:49] condition and then when you look at her
[11:52] he said I saw it I see you moving from
[11:55] me
[11:56] Hallelujah she was a little girl you're
[11:59] in a yellow dresser and there's a dog
[12:01] that is chasing you
[12:04] and the cause of that there's a spirit
[12:07] amen that is now on her that cause
[12:10] nervousness
[12:12] and heart trouble
[12:14] Hallelujah
[12:15] amen but now we look at the sins of men
[12:20] when a man molest a child
[12:23] the spirit of the Molester him and gets
[12:26] on that child
[12:28] and president I tell you no she becomes
[12:31] a captive to that spirit
[12:35] and it sees not delivered
[12:38] she's an agent of hell
[12:41] but yet this woman
[12:43] Hallelujah can I talk about her
[12:46] she came from the mind of God
[12:49] she was a Seed of Abraham the receiver
[12:53] of life amen that was inside of her then
[12:57] yet oh it's not God cause it to happen
[13:00] they remember the mere reflection amen
[13:04] of her life amen singing to the picture
[13:07] [Music]
[13:09] but I thank God that Jesus said he said
[13:12] none that the father gave to me shall be
[13:16] lost
[13:24] the way of the world today
[13:27] you you know in our country we're
[13:29] battling
[13:30] Amen to a great Crossroad
[13:32] Jamaica was always came in a great
[13:36] friend of the USA
[13:38] but now the government of the USA is
[13:42] setting a new ambassador to Jamaica
[13:45] and the government has got to approve
[13:48] the Ambassador with his spouse
[13:51] but his spouse is of the same sex
[13:54] and it's against our law
[13:57] and the government
[13:59] have failed they need to approve it and
[14:03] so the three ambassadors from Jamaica in
[14:07] the USA the government is sending them
[14:09] back home
[14:11] because as a nation we will not accept
[14:15] it
[14:18] said
[14:21] righteousness with its alternation but
[14:25] sin is a reporter to any people
[14:33] where did it start
[14:35] this young man
[14:37] who was coming up he was strong
[14:40] they remember he went around the wrong
[14:42] crowd and he was molested somehow no
[14:46] pressure let me say this to you when
[14:49] your children start to payment change
[14:51] character
[14:53] something happened somewhere
[14:57] it is a shame that's in a church
[15:00] people become hypocritical I know there
[15:04] was nothing good in them all along
[15:07] and your love
[15:09] that to flourish
[15:12] Hallelujah but Jesus came to set your
[15:16] captain free
[15:21] she will come of age
[15:24] no matter what happened she will never
[15:27] be the same again she might marry a
[15:30] husband but she cannot serve him right
[15:32] because there's a spirit in her life
[15:35] that is motivating her and the blindness
[15:40] of the ministry that led these things
[15:43] gone in the church
[15:48] Hallelujah remember I pray that we're
[15:52] going to see a church again we're gonna
[15:54] get back to a place where the Holy Ghost
[15:57] and the power of God is going to reign
[16:00] in our church and When sin come through
[16:03] the door amen somebody he's gonna stand
[16:07] up against it Hallelujah whole Church of
[16:10] the Living God it is time we take the
[16:14] holy ghost out of the back room and
[16:17] bring him back in the front room
[16:23] Hallelujah
[16:25] Glory
[16:27] Jesus
[16:29] and so it was
[16:32] Amen to begin to try
[16:34] to find a place in society
[16:37] and maybe you know deep inside of her
[16:40] heart may I say if you're a seed of God
[16:44] it doesn't matter what the devil does
[16:46] there's something in you that is called
[16:49] your back to the cross of Jesus there's
[16:53] a deep calling and for deep but by
[16:57] yourself the only way you can respond
[17:00] baby you've got to be delivered you've
[17:03] got to be released amen that stronghold
[17:06] of the devil amen is going to lose on
[17:08] you remember the preacher preacher amen
[17:11] they take all the quotes but there is no
[17:14] power
[17:18] so we get to the stage where
[17:20] what we want to hear is a favorite quote
[17:26] oh we all know them
[17:28] or favorite rhetoric and people die in
[17:33] their experience and the young people
[17:35] begin to move away they mean from the
[17:38] church they mean they don't trust
[17:40] anybody Hallelujah trust is lost and
[17:44] when trust is lost everything is gone am
[17:48] I talking to you am I preaching to you

[18:16] life may I say he come to Center the
[18:21] captain free
[18:26] the Pharisees never wanted her around
[18:30] because she was a woman of the city and
[18:35] she was a sinner
[18:37] you know we've got so much Prejudice
[18:40] today
[18:41] Hallelujah
[18:43] we don't want the double married
[18:46] because it put pressure on our church

[19:06] socialization they are tattooed all over
[19:09] we cast them as a child of Hell amen
[19:12] because their peers are all over we have
[19:15] nothing to do with them but Jesus he
[19:19] never come to call the righteous but
[19:21] Sinners to repentance
[19:24] [Music]

[19:30] amen may I say you would want this woman
[19:35] in your church

[22:20] but when you try to reach them
[22:22] and to go back to the source
[22:25] of where their problem lies
[22:27] it was because daddy did something
[22:31] and Mama cover it up
[22:33] because had it been known he would have
[22:36] destroyed the entire family
[22:38] or something happened in a church and

[48:46] of many seeds that are not in this hole
[48:52] I still believe
[48:54] that might just be me but wake me up
[48:57] but I believe that there's still some in

[49:02] Church
[49:05] hello
[49:10] there's still some in the denomination
[49:13] Hallelujah but if they ever know the
[49:16] truth all because of the syndrome of God
[49:20] Amen that is in the heart and they would
[49:23] believe it and they are waiting on you
[49:25] who have already received it they made
[49:28] the hop on the door and let them hear
[49:31] amen that God has sent her a senate
[49:34] Angel Messenger on the face of the earth

[49:47] feature that's
[49:49] something hey man
[49:51] Hallelujah
[49:53] glory to God
[49:55] but I'll tell you we come through many
[49:56] systems
[49:58] it was one time Brother Joseph when what
[50:01] we heard was the acts of the prophet
[50:03] and neglect the message
[50:06] and now we said ah we've gotten into the
[50:08] message the opening of the word here's
[50:10] the rod but we build another camp
[50:14] it's all right
[50:15] Hollywood would shut the door to others
[50:18] amen I was very encouraged for me to go
[50:23] to a church amen that is not a message
[50:25] or it's the first time I did that in
[50:27] America him and preached the gospel
[50:29] here's a rod amen but I believe that
[50:32] there are some seeds aiming among the
[50:35] Jehovah's Witness I believe there are
[50:37] some seeds in The Seventh-Day Adventists
[50:40] I believe there are some seeds in the
[50:43] Church of God of Prophecy hallelujah
[50:45] amen that never know that God sent a
[50:48] prophet remember when we speak to them
[50:50] we sell them they mean about a prophet
[50:52] that they don't know about her remember
[50:54] I challenge you Minister stanata if you
[50:57] can't preach this messenger out of the
[50:59] Bible the doctrine amen of what we
[51:01] believe Amy you've never met the pillar
[51:04] of fire are you throwing me here because
[51:06] brother Branham is not the essential
[51:08] woman of what we believe it is Jesus
[51:11] Christ
[51:19] amen
[51:21] what the message did to me is turn my
[51:24] heart back to the word of God and shine
[51:27] a light on the word of God hallelujah
[51:30] that the word that's on the page step
[51:33] out of the page and live into a body
[51:36] [Music]
[51:41] he was not the Christ
[51:45] he was not this son of man but he is a
[51:48] cinnamon revealing this other man Jesus
[51:52] Christ
[51:57] but I thank God for the Lord
[52:00] amen like Abraham call elieza and said I
[52:05] want you to promise me
[52:06] don't take away from Isaac among these
[52:10] whom I live but I want you to go back to
[52:12] my homeland I'll even get a wife for
[52:15] isaka I mean I believe that brother
[52:17] Branham is my elieza Hallelujah
[52:29] he was not the one but he was sent to
[52:32] Hallelujah a lighter the characteristic
[52:35] of Jesus
[52:39] I don't want to ask for this evening
[52:41] where are we
[52:44] are we still on the journey
[52:46] with our elieza or have we met or Isaac
[52:51] have we gone into the tent Have We
[52:54] Become his wife
[52:56] talk to me somebody tell me where are we
[53:00] tell me
[53:01] if we are still on the journey
[53:04] then elieza is our greatest attraction
[53:08] because we don't know Isaac we're only
[53:11] hearing about him but if we have seen
[53:14] him in the field if he has taken us into
[53:17] the tent
[53:18] Oh Glory to God if there's a conception
[53:22] amen then elieza must go again that
[53:27] Jesus Christ might arise
[53:33] are you there with me
[53:35] are you for with me
[53:37] Hallelujah
[53:41] we never know this Bible
[53:45] we never understand
[53:48] what's in the book
[53:51] until all elieza
[53:54] open the word
[53:56] [Music]
[53:57] there's a rock
[53:59] Hallelujah
[54:01] and that don't make me any better than
[54:03] you
[54:07] because the seed of God that is a
[54:10] Baptist today you're not better than
[54:13] them
[54:14] they haven't come yet but they've got to
[54:18] come
[54:20] and what's going to bring them in
[54:23] if we shut the door and so the time of
[54:26] Grace is over but I'll tell you people
[54:29] it's not over
