[38:27] when we should see him there's no beauty
[38:30] that we should desire him he was
[38:33] despised and rejected a men a man of
[38:35] sorrow and acquainted with grief and we
[38:36] hear as it were our faces from him he
[38:39] was
[38:40] despised and we esteemed him not surely
[38:44] he has bored our grief and carried our
[38:46] sours yet we esteemed him stricken
[38:49] spitten of God and
[38:51] Afflicted but he was what for you

[39:28] God for if we have any visitors thank
[39:30] God for you in Jesus name
[39:33] amen God is good
[39:35] amen want to talk about the revealed
[39:38] word not only the revealed word of this
[39:41] hour but the reveal word amen Prophet
[39:45] God said Revelation means more than any
[39:48] everything to us it means
[39:51] everything because without Revelation
[39:53] amen you just can't see
[39:57] amen but we need revelation we need God
[40:00] to reveal himself to us as individuals
[40:03] amen so if you go to galti uh
[40:07] one galatian
[40:10] 1 the reveal word God has to reveal his
[40:14] word to you if God does not reveal his
[40:17] word to you you'll never see
[40:19] it but God is it's God working on you to
[40:23] reveal himself to you as an individual
[40:27] praise God when something inside of you
[40:29] begin to say Amen to the word that means
[40:32] that God is revealing himself to you
[40:35] amen when there's no amen then you can't
[40:38] see that means you can't even hear you
[40:40] you're blind amen but when there's an
[40:42] amen inside of you and you don't open
[40:44] your mouth and say Amen to the word then
[40:47] that means you can't
[40:49] see amen but when you open your mouth
[40:52] and you said amen to the word that means
[40:55] amen God I understand I
[40:57] see amen that I'm a witness amen that
[41:01] you speaking to me Lord I understand I
[41:04] see
[41:05] amen somebody give you something and you
[41:08] don't say thank you then something is
[41:10] wrong I I I doubt they want to keep on
[41:12] giving you something because you never
[41:14] tell them thank you you just look at it
[41:17] and you just uh begin to enjoy what they
[41:20] give you but you don't never say thank
[41:22] you sometimes you take for granted when
[41:24] Mama fix your food or Grandma fix your
[41:26] fool lay it that for you you don't never
[41:28] say oh this is good compliment oh I
[41:31] really that's very tasty thank you for
[41:34] doing it sometime you take for granted
[41:37] you just sat out and just eat you never
[41:39] tell a thank
[41:40] you amen you got to learn to to be
[41:44] thankful amen see but when when
[41:47] something is revealed to you you begin
[41:49] to tell God thank you Lord I appreciate
[41:53] you amen you know for showing me these
[41:56] things amen from revealing yourself to
[41:59] me Lord thank you but sometimes we don't
[42:02] tell God Amen we don't give him nothing
[42:05] back from what he's given to us amen we
[42:08] need to give God back amen then that's
[42:12] the reason why we serve the Lord because
[42:14] we understand God has been good to us
[42:16] and God is good to us so we tell God
[42:19] thank you amen because of how good he is

[43:01] amen so here it is uh Revelation I mean
[43:05] galatian uh 1 and 11 galatian 1 Paul was
[43:10] talking about uh Angel come from Heaven
[43:13] preaching in the gospel and all of that
[43:15] he said though we an angel come from
[43:17] Heaven preaching in the gospel and that
[43:18] which we preach he said let them be a
[43:20] curse isn't that right but he had to he
[43:23] was dealing with gations that
[43:26] he he he said in the third chapter he
[43:29] said oh foolish galatian who has be with
[43:33] you amen see because the Galatians was
[43:37] Jews that wanted to go back and practice
[43:40] Judaism he said receive you the Spirit
[43:43] by The Works of the law by the hearing
[43:44] of
[43:45] Faith amen it's faith that saved us and
[43:49] faith that bought us from Judy under the
[43:52] law into Grace amen and we received the
[43:56] Spirit by not by what we work for but by
[43:59] the hearing of Faith amen God fill you
[44:02] with the Holy Ghost when you heard the
[44:04] gospel of your salvation preached to you
[44:07] you receive the spirit amen by faith you
[44:11] receive the Holy Ghost it was nothing
[44:14] that you done that you deserve it no
[44:17] work but by the hearing of Faith amen
[44:20] the Holy Ghost begin to amen anoint the
[44:23] word amen and you begin to receive that
[44:25] word when that word was revealed to you
[44:28] and Jesus revealed himself amen the Holy
[44:32] Ghost came in so I'm talking about the
[44:35] revealed word he says Paul was talking
[44:39] about he said uh uh for here he says but
[44:43] I certify you Brethren that the gospel
[44:47] which was preached up me is not after
[44:52] what see you know Paul had a challenge
[44:55] there
[44:56] because they were uh they they were
[44:59] contending with the gospel that he was
[45:02] preaching see because they had the law
[45:04] and they had amen Judaism and whatever
[45:07] but here the gospel of the kingdom was
[45:09] being preached but the people were
[45:12] struggling with it amen even though they
[45:14] were supposed to be church and Believers
[45:17] of the message of the hour that Christ
[45:19] had come amen delivered them out of the
[45:22] Captivity and that he was the lamb that
[45:25] was slain but yet they had a problem
[45:27] with it amen they didn't have a problem
[45:30] with all of it but some of it they were
[45:32] struggling with because they were
[45:34] struggling because they were circumcised
[45:36] and there were others amen that was not
[45:38] circumcised so we were amen struggling
[45:41] look is what we learn by Moses and this
[45:44] is what we learn under the law and some
[45:46] of us are struggling with the message of
[45:48] the hour because we have learned this
[45:51] and we learned that from our
[45:53] denominational belief amen it was all
[45:56] right for that particular time and for
[45:58] that particular space of your life it
[46:01] worked out all right but it came a time
[46:04] when God was taking to the father
[46:07] Revelation revealing himself in a deeper
[46:10] depth but yet we wanted to stay back
[46:13] there are you with me so God reveals to
[46:17] you the word uh of the hour that relates
[46:21] to you for the day and hour you live in
[46:25] amen and he said well I want to hold on
[46:28] to he said no no amen we walk by faith
[46:33] not by
[46:34] sight amen we don't want to amen praise
[46:37] God take and try to eat the Mana amen
[46:41] that fell on
[46:42] yesterday amen yet that manner was good
[46:45] yesterday it's no good for us today
[46:48] because it's got worms in
[46:50] it are you with me so don't try to Amen
[46:55] to live on yesterday NE in your
[46:57] Christian walk should you try to look
[46:59] back to your past and base your present
[47:02] off of your
[47:04] past are you with me amen you you you

[47:11] you die
[47:13] daily amen don't let your past amen
[47:17] govern your future and neither your
[47:20] present are you with me so what God is
[47:23] trying to bring you into is trying to
[47:26] bring you out from the past and bring
[47:28] you into the present tense
[47:31] word are you with me but we want to hold

[55:15] God don't let nothing shake your faith
[55:18] in God are you with me but if somebody
[55:22] can shake your faith that means amen you
[55:25] need to go back and get a deeper
[55:27] Revelation because Jesus blood has never
[55:32] lost has never lost its

[56:29] this this Paul why is he struggling with
[56:32] these people these this saved Church
[56:35] these people that supposed to be saved
[56:37] why am I struggling with
[56:39] them okay he he's trying to he's
[56:42] convincing them he's saying neither
[56:45] receive I a man neither was I taught
[56:48] it amen he went to the Seminary and
[56:51] learned under gomea he was a bright
[56:55] student some people say he spoke seven
[56:58] different languages and all of that and
[57:00] things like that they talk about Paul
[57:02] you know is a great scholar of the of
[57:05] the word of God and all of that but yet
[57:08] he
[57:09] said he was well taught and well learned
[57:11] but he said I wasn't taught what I'm
[57:13] preaching
[57:14] now he said I I wasn't taught it a
[57:17] man amen the church that I came from and
[57:20] the synagogue that I used to and the
[57:22] school I went to I wasn't taught this a

[1:19:11] what I just just
[1:19:14] quote I'm I'm gonna tell you
[1:19:16] something the Pharisees and Sadducees
[1:19:19] and looking right at the word and they
[1:19:21] couldn't see it
[1:19:23] he said I didn't confer with flesh and
[1:19:26] blood Matthew uh 16 tells us about he
[1:19:30] said who the men say I the son of man
[1:19:33] am are you with me and see some people
[1:19:37] don't know who he is
[1:19:39] today they think they know because they
[1:19:41] just heard that Jesus
[1:19:43] saved but by Revelation he he hasn't
[1:19:46] been revealed to
[1:19:48] them
[1:19:50] amen and even Peter that said thou the
[1:19:54] Christ the son of the Living God even
[1:19:58] Peter even when he said that later only
[1:20:01] in his journey he Deni Jesus three times
[1:20:05] that's why he needed something on the
[1:20:07] inside to back up the Revelation that
[1:20:10] Jesus God had given him he needed an
[1:20:13] inside experience he needed conversion
[1:20:15] on the inside he needed the Holy Ghost
[1:20:18] are you with me because even though he
[1:20:21] said thou the Christ the son of the
[1:20:23] Living God he said blessed are thou
[1:20:25] Simon vagina for what Flesh and Blood ha
[1:20:28] not
