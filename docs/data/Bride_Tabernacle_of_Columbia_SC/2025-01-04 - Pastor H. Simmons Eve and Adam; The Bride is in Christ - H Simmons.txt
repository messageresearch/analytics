bless and confid them our brother Jackson Lord in Jesus Christ's name father thank you for the word tonight in Jesus name amen the Book of Genesis 1 and 26 Genesis 1:26 appreciate brother Carl being here tonight amen 1 and 26 let's just start at 25 and it says and God made the beasts of the Earth at after his kind and the cattle after their kind and everything that creepeth upon the Earth after his kind and God saw that it was good and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowls of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his what own image in his own image in the image of God created he him male then what fale created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be [Music] fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and to do it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowls of the air and over the every living thing that moveth upon the Earth may God bless the read word you may be seated amen we know that when God made Adam and Eve he made them to have the menion he gave them the Earth and God was in heaven in a sense as we look at it and he had Angels there to worship him but when God made man he said have dominion over the Earth so by the grace of God man was God Amen on the earth he was an amag of God he had Dominion he could speak what he said would come to pass we know that the spoken word is the Original Seed so we want to talk about in the 20 uh in the 2 and seven and God and the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground and breath in his nostril the breath of life and Man became a Liv living Soul so here we are again the first God made man Spirit man then God made man of the Dust of the ground so now people don't know how long Adam and Eve existed in spirit form but we know that when God made him amen he made him in spirit amen now in the 21st verse it says and the Lord God calls let's just read the 20th verse and Adam gave name to all the cattle and all the fouls of the air and every beast of the field but for Adam there was what there was not found a what help help meat for him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his what ribs ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a what woman a woman and bought her unto Adam and Adam said this is this is now what bone of my bone and what she shall be called what because she was taken out of man so we see I says tonight Eve was in Adam and the bride was in Christ I is in Christ amen the bride is in Christ so now we realize if the bride is in Christ she's not of this world and she's we're in we're in this world but we're not of this world the bride is in Christ now as we did that let's just go to First Corinthians [Music] 13 12 and 13 excuse me 1 Corinthians 12 and 13 God is good amen you love him amen we in a a a place that in the 12th verse he said for as the body is one and has many members and all members of the that one body being many are one body so also is Christ so by one what by one Spirit are we all what baptized baptized into what one body one body whether we be jew or Gentile whether we be born or free whether we and have been all made to drink into one spirit amen so by the grace of God you Adam and Eve was one in the beginning But as God servant said a Eve was not in the original creation she was a byproduct of Adam so it wasn't that he created Eve and Adam but Eve was Adam because Eve was taken out of Adam are you with me amen so Eve and Adam was one you see that so as that as it we and Christ the bride and Christ are one okay but because people don't come into the realization of that and because we don't really uh we can't uh comprehend it sometimes within our mind that you and Christ are won and perhaps you know uh Eve coming out of Adam amen maybe you know we got to recognize who we are before the Rapture can take place and we recognize who we are where we came from amen so we came from God amen amen we were in the genes or in the mind of God before the foundation of the world amen amen but we didn't know that but when we heard the eagle scream we heard the gospel amen we recognize who our father was amen we recognize that we amen were not of this world Amen that we were pris and strangers just passing through here amen amen this world is not our home I'm talking about the cosmos the world order as we say amen amen but the Bible said the Earth is the Lord in the fullness there of the world and all that dwell there in amen so what we're talking about the cosmos the the this evil age amen this uh Satan eat amen we're not of this this is not what Adam had in the beginning this is all been deformed amen uh Satan has deformed everything he tried to make a see Satan was in Heaven he tried to imitate and try to make a better amen he saw Eden in his glory he saw how amen it was when God had everything and said it was good the devil saw that but so he tried he tries to give you something Amen to take your hearts and Minds away from what God has given everything God made was good but he had one thing that he said not to do eat of the tree and not touch it amen Elicia die amen and when uh Eve listen you know and that's what happens sometimes amen we pay attention to the uh the evil one the devil we listen we listen to the wrong voice you know to the bride we have a certain sound but the world Listen to an uncertain sound amen and the Bible said God is not the author of confusion but a peace amen Jesus said my peace I give you not as the world give I the devil amen can't give you this peace amen because God says he gives them perfect peace whose mind is stad on him amen the devil will in in infiltrate I I want to talk about the infiltration pray of the church uh perhaps Sunday but uh the devil would infiltrate your mind amen and the devil has infiltrated your mind he has entered into your thought pattern Amen to get you to think like he thinks and that's what he did to Eve he he wanted to get her away from thinking amen like God Amen amen he wanted to make her feel like she needed what he had amen and he didn't have anything cuz he lost it all he was a fallen creature a fallen angel he had no more amen uh the glory that God gave him in heaven amen as a a co- Pastor in heaven amen he was next to God but because he wanted to take over and take God's place are you with me he fell amen and the minute amen God Amen puts you in a position and gives you things in this life and when God gives it to you amen then amen man can't take it from you amen amen amen but when you try to achieve things outside of the word and the will of God it would all crumble amen it'll come to not am amen but what you want is Jesus said Lord not my will but let what will now we understand that God was in Christ amen and the Bride of Jesus Christ amen is in Christ amen as God was in Christ Christ was in God he said my word is in you you abide in my word and my word abide in you are you with me so you got to be in him and he got and he said he'll be in you amen are you with me so that Union amen that desire God I want to amen I want to be one with you amen I don't want my will to be done I want yours to be done because as long as God Amen is with us all things are possible with them to them that believe we think God will never lead you astray amen he will never fail you amen you will never be disappointed with him amen he tells you the thief cometh to kill to steal and destroy but he said I come that you might have life and life and life more abundantly amen he wants you to live okay so here he says for by one Spirit we all baptized into one body amen and so it's the spirit I'm going to tell you a person can be from Africa they can be from Spain they can be from Germany they can be from um China they can be from Russia amen it doesn't make a difference by one spirit it's the mystical Body of Christ amen amen you have things common because you have the same spirit amen are you with me so it doesn't matter what country what language amen there's a Heavenly language you speak and there's a Heavenly Union because you're one in Christ amen that's your brother that's your sister amen no matter where they are you one and that so by the grace of God and that's and it it's a kenich spirit we have the same father amen so it was it was just some things I I joted down here uh we have to be as God's servant say as the word was in Mary so the word is in the bride amen true amen okay so it's very important Eve and Adam Adam amen and Eve being one so let's go to Ephesian uh five Ephesians [Music] 5 God had a reason from choosing you in him he had a I I mean he made the right decision did did God make a wrong decision when he chose you you said well I don't why did you choose me God did you make a mistake when he chose you when he let you be born in America in a certain family and had certain parents and you might say well I I don't know why I'm no God didn't make a a mistake when he chose you amen but you got to recognize you've been chosen of God and until you recognize that amen God had a purpose in choosing you amen he had a reason why he did it amen he didn't make a mistake the devil will have you amen uh think that amen God has forgotten about you and God don't know your troubles don't know your needs and don't understand amen your what you go through and amen the things that you are confronted with in this world God understands it all but he must not when you understand who you are then God Gave You Dominion God has G God has given you dominion over these things one may make next by one Spirit you're baptized into one body amen as God gave Eve and Adam dominion over everything then God am gave the last Adam which was Christ dominion over everything it was redeemed you've been redeemed you've been restored back unto Dominion amen you have the same power and authority that God gave to them in the beginning Jesus expressed that Authority and that power when he walked on the earth he showed you what the new creation and what the new creature was all about and he said I'll make you a new creature amen If any man being in Christ he is a new creation amen so you are a new creation you are different from the rest of the world they don't recognize amen who you are because they didn't recognize who he was but you must know by faith in God's word and by accepting Jesus Christ as your lord and your God amen amen amen Thomas said my Lord and my God Amen you you must recognize that fact and when you recognize that you understand that God has chosen you for a reason and for a purpose amen amen and you say well it does not resonate with me I cannot comprehend what you're saying but I want you to I don't want you to try by your own intellect to comprehend I want you to just believe what God said about you and to you and you receive Jesus Christ and by amen by faith amen I can't see it amen praise God I can't comprehend it in my finite mind Amen in my little mind that I have but by the grace of God I know that with God something inside of me telling me that I am amen I'm a child of the king something inside of me me that he's my God something ins tired of me telling me that he's my father amen I don't care what the devil say I don't care what I have to go through now I know my God is real amen hallu the world might look at you as they looked at the children of Israel and called the mud do sleeves and everything else amen you might have to be ridiculed and persecuted but that's all right you got to know who your father is I I know whom I am and I know who I believe I know my God Amen he knows it all he see every one of my pains he see my suffering he see what I go through he see my weakness and my fires but thank God that he didn't leave me amen even when I failed him even when he was disappointed with me but yeah that God still love [Applause] me amen he didn't never forsake sake Israel no matter how bad they got when they turned back to God and they cried out to him God Amen he amen he just uh came and he delivered them praise God and we find out in the Book of Judges amen when uh they got all right they forgot God and then God had to send the enemy to come amen and uh send plagues and the enemy to come and conquer them and uh amen but then they when they saw amen the troubles and the things that they were going through they cried out to God again and God sent a judge or sent Deliverance for him and that's what God does for you every time uh amen you look like you failed uh and the devil have beaten you up uh amen and look like you can't get out of the mess that you got in God comes and send a Word of Deliverance uh somehow God oh Hallelujah he'll do something about it he won't let you stay there amen because you're blown to him uh and because he loves you uh and he won't forget you amen he won't leave you in the hands of the enemy the enemy right try to take your life and take you on but God said not so this is my son this is my daughter you can't have ch belong to [Music] me and I'll never forget you I'll never forget [Music] you Hallelujah Ephesians here 5 glory to God that's all the devil just takes a moment to get you out of get your mind away from the things of Christ and thank God don't care and God don't love you that's all he has to do just sew that little evil seed in that little then he thinks you're not good enough just tell me who's good enough the Bible tells me he such the heavens and the Earth and he looked beneath the Earth and no man can even look on the book of redemption nobody even can take the book nobody can look on it nobody in heaven nobody in Earth nobody beneath the Earth amen but Jesus Christ became our King and Redeemer amen and he said he saw a bloody lamb come out from the Throne of God Amen and the voice says amen the lion have of the tribe of Judah has prevailed for he's worthy to take the book amen I'm glad that he was worthy to take the book Hallelujah I'm saying none of us don't look around and say well brother Simmons or or brother so and so and sister so and so amen they uhuh no no just believe that if anyone is going to make it Lord I'm one I'm the one through all your failures all your disappointment all your troubles and all that you've been through all that you're going through just say Lord hallelujah I just believe somehow somewh amen Lord I'll make it amen I'm going to make it because I'm determined I'm I'm determined to hold on to God's unchanging hand even in not chain I'm holding on cuz the chains are going to break the children of Israel had chains of slavery on them but they held to God's word even in their bondage to Hell amen and somehow the chains broke because God sent deliverance and God won't let you stay that way he'll the never his children didn't forget him God had a provided time when the fullness of time came amen God knows the fullness of your time amen the child could not be delivered to the amen sometimes you know I was thinking as I was praying before service I said you know being in the room with my wife sometimes the pains have to get closer and closer and sometimes before the baby come forth those pains get severe so much and so that they feel like kind I don't know what they feel like Ain never had one I know it must be some pain though but you know I I F to say the wrong thing it can go through some pain and I'm going to tell you before your breakthrough before you get a solid breakthrough things might get difficult thing pain might get severe but that that's just showing you how mad the devil is amen Pharaoh did everything he could do to try to hold him but he couldn't hold them why cuz God sent his word amen through a prophet down there in Egypt amen and tell Pharaoh let my people go amen praise God God has sent a word in our day he said come out of here amen isn't that right he called you in our out and he call you hey come to me and something about that amen once you can identify with it once you can hear the voice of God you can identify with it I I I you know cuz other people don't hear what you hear amen he said he that has an ear to hear Let Him hear what the spirit says everybody got ears what they can't hear everybody got Hearts but they can't receive so by the grace of God blessed are your ears because you he amen so let me just get back here U I would never read galatian 5 and make it Ephesians 5 okay so right the grace of God and I'm I'm G skip all the way down to where I want to be almost and it says the 27th verse Ephesians 527 26 says that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it unto himself a what glorious Church a glorious church sints when you recognize that the church should be I'm going tell you something I there's people in the world they put on the best outfits but they don't do that no more I don't know

some of that oldtime religion where people you have some decency where you come into the house of the Lord and it's a difference where it's Holiness where it's godliness we some some folks all they had that's what they came because that's all they had that's why they came like that that's all they had that was the best that they had and they came before God because but sometimes we got we can do

ain't cool and trying to be like the world he trying to be like Jesus look at him ain't that right you got to remember you don't belong to this world here you don't conform to this world the bride is in Christ are you with me Eve was in Adam as long as she was in Adam she could not sin are you with me as long as you in Christ you cannot sin because his seed what remains in you and amen he that is born of God does not commit sin because his seed what is in you amen Thy word have I what hid in my heart that I might not against amen the bride is in Christ amen as Eve was in Adam are you with me your desires change when the Holy Ghost come the nature change but that be a devil there telling you that they ain't not change you ain't change but if you listen to the devil for a little while but God will never leave you amen once he come and he gives you the Holy Ghost and he touches your life amen that voice would never leave you amen the devil come and he he he he Wes you away he he tempt you amen but it's something inside of you know that I've had an experience with God amen amen and and no no no matter how far I try to run I know God has done something in my [Music] life you can't make me doubt him I know what he done for me I know it was him that delivered me now I I got I got excited and got away from my topic I don't know how I got on all those things but think on this see because sometimes the devil have you he had Eve looking at the world reasoning with the word and that's what he has people people to do and have them to look at the world and reason with the word you got to look at Jesus Jesus I'm going to keep my eyes on you you the word the word was made flesh amen God was in Christ Christ was in God Amen they were one that's what he says here this says concerning the 30th verse he says for we are members of his body and of his flesh and of his bone for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined into his wife and the two shall be what one one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning what chur Christ in the church amen you got to be you're one it's not you're no more Twain but you're one you in Christ one so don't try to I I don't feel like get out the way you ain't got nothing to do with this now you got to realize Christ is your head you're one you don't make your own decisions you are led by What Spirit the spirit of God so you stop thinking like I got control of my life you don't you're in Christ now and you got to be led by him Lord I I I want to be led by your spirit so all of this I I

brother Jeremiah I think they forgot it as a whole people forgot to put God first because then they they've been artificial so long artificial Christians ain't connected with with the baptism and the Holy Ghost they're not Union they're not United with him they're not one with him the spirit but God first some Christians do some stuff I could never do never even think about doing but they do it I said Lord have mercy how can people do you know the kind of close people way I love Jesus how can you be connected and can do certain things if you connected and you got the Holy Ghost you can't do certain things the Holy Ghost will condemn you true are you with me amen and if you did it then you have to confess right quick brothers and sister don't let the church amen Be Your Leader or the

Things become easy my yoke is easy my burom is light the living a Christian life becomes an easy life Eve was in Adam and the bride is in Christ for a purpose God had a reason for choosing you he
