there's wars and there's fightings praise god but thank god hallelujah that we on the lord's side this morning i'll read the first you read the next and we'll go through the 10th verse read the 10th verse together from whence cometh walls and fighting among you come they not hints even of your lusts the war in your members too and receive not because you act some miss that you may consume it upon your lust for do you think that the scripture says in vain the spirit that dwelt in us lusts to envy 6. submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he would flee from you eight be afflicted and moan and weak let your laughter be turned in the morning and your joy to heavenness together humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up may god bless you in his word you may be seated praise god they said there's a battle between humility and pride praise god god resists the proud but he gives grace to the humble so there's always a battle where he met the flesh don't have no humility in it it don't they don't desire humility and to be humble amen but in order to be humble you must you must resist the devil amen and sometimes we're looking for an outside devil but our greatest enemy adversary is self amen so we must look at the walls and fighting where they come from what causes the walls and fighting now i i want you to be mindful this morning that a lot of times we think that amen he says now here he said from whence cometh walls and fighting we want to talk about wars where did it come from for which commented james had to deal with it i i want you to know that he was not talking to the world but he was talking to the church and he met in the jews at that time they had a lot of schisms and isms in the body and so they had internal fighting and he said but where did it come from i want you to understand for where it comes from whence cometh wars and fighting among you amen see because a lot of times uh people don't understand why they're warned and why they are fighting you know he says come they not hints even of your what the first verse is james 4 1. he says from whence cometh wars and fighting among you coming they not hints even of your what not somebody else's now he said who's yo lust you see what i'm saying now we don't want to put it on an exterior somebody else he said it comes among you but where did it come from are you are you with me god is not the author of confusion but of what peace god says my peace i what now but where did walls and fighting come among you you know i i i was saying ernest you know he said you're going to consumption this morning and i says it's a possibility that i said let me pray on it and everything i prayed for is i said i got to come here because i got to speak to the church and uh it's it's a matter of i believe that it's an urgency that the church grow up fast and growing up that means we come to maturity he says when i was a child i was i speak as a child i understood as a child but when i became a when i became a man i put away what i put away childish things isn't that right see it's time to grow up and and the only way we're going to grow up amen into the statue of a perfect man is that we be no longer babes drinking milk we gotta start eating meat amen and you got to have your senses exercised and being able to return good and evil are you with me so there must be a spirit of discernment and that spirit of discernment shows you who your real enemy is are you with me because if you can't discern the devil and how he works are you with me then you would be looking at friendly fire as i said another week friendly fire a lot of folk get killed from their own people that's on their side and they call it friendly fire jesus said to judas friend betrayed thou me what the what kiss he said uh it was a men of my own company my own acquaintance those are the ones you know the foes of my own house see jesus amen was facing what those that he came to save was the one that thought he was against them so they sought to kill him and jesus said well i seek you to kill me he they said we know he said well you got a devil ain't nobody trying to kill you are you with me they said you know the jews amen did not know they meant the spirit that was operating in their lives they couldn't understand it that jesus was even peter at one time he said a master don't all deny you i would never do it and jesus said to peter get me behind me satan amen why because the devil was so crafty that he could slip in and you be unconscious unaware amen so paul even addressed the galatians he said he said i i'm marvel that you're so soon removed from him that i call you until another gospel are you are you with me he said which is not another he said but don't we on an angel come from heaven and preach any other gospel than that which we preach he said let let him be a curse ain't that right see what happens amen sometimes we forgot we forget and we get amnesia quickly amen and and sometimes uh we're looking at the wrong adversary and then if we think that uh wars and fighting come from within but it comes from a spirit and you know the bible said take here at least you'll be consumed one of another are you whooping the devil can sit on the outside and just sit looking in because he's caused all the trouble then he let you are you with me the devil caused all the trouble and then he just set back and like he ain't done nothing he doesn't cause all the trouble amen and then all of a sudden people are uh focusing their attention on one another instead of on the devil that calls it all it a lot of times a misunderstanding amen can cause a lot of division a lot of trouble just some misunderstanding are you with me the devil will cause you to be thrown off in just a minute it'll corrupt your spirit it'll cause amen from whence com it'll cause marriages to break up homes should be destroyed everything why a misunderstanding instead of uh you know trying to uh uh stay amen together we'll divide ourselves and the devil know if he can get you to divide yourself amen then he can conquer you amen he can conquer the family he can conquer the home if he gets the husband and wife divided then he conquers the children are you with me the devil seek to kill to steal and what destroy but he wants you to divide you he wants you to be up against one another amen and then we try to prove who's right and who's wrong it's what when we come to maturity it's not who's right and who's wrong we don't want to even bother with that we're talking about a church coming into maturity amen because we got to come into maturity to get out of here amen we got to grow up to get out of here and and growing up amen we're talking about let's go to first corinthians 13 for a moment coming into that statue of a perfect man and coming in to perfect love is something that we must strive to do amen in in striving for that um perfect love status it's some things that we got to forget those things which are behind us are you with me we got to deal with amen from whence coming walls and fighting among you it don't come from without the lust that was in our members it's things that inside of us that god wants to take out of us you know i was telling brother nate and he was telling me about the situation i said brother nathan you know we almost 70 years old stuff that used to bother us 20 years 30 years ago don't bother us now are you with me how many of you know the stuff that bothered you in first grade when you getting in junior high school you know it don't even bother you are you with me that first great stuff and elementary stuff you get on up junior high you said i'm past that you listening to the first and second graders talk about their little uh little things that they're going through you look at them and kind of smile well you don't become a teenager and you look at a teenager when you become a young adult and this little stuff they're going through as a teenager you look at them the parents look at the teenagers and stuff they get trying to get over and uh you know parents don't understand this and they don't know this and you know and the parents just look at them like you've never been a teenager they think you've never been a teenager and then it gets on up to a place where your grandparents your grandparents and and your children trying to rare their children and stuff like that and grandparents looked at him and said you know they already been that way and they know certain things there's a certain level of maturity and i'm saying the somebody trying to you know learn uh uh how to add and subtract and you're up there in algebra and you're going on in trigonometry and all of that stuff and they said they have trouble with you know four and four ah and they're happy it's eight dealing with algebra trigonometry geometry and they happen because they just find out that two plus two is four and all of that and adding subtraction but you don't pass all of that and in the spirit realm amen we got to get to a place that amen we're no longer in elementary school we're no longer in junior high school and we're no longer in high school but we going on up amen and we've graduated from college now and we you should we're supposed to know how to navigate and how to be successful in this because all of our preparation all over growing up is to know how to be successful in life so uh in coming to church amen it's preparing you how to handle yourself where you can be successful in the kingdom of god and how to resist the devil and how to defeat the enemy that you can live in the spirit walk in the spirit amen so by the grace of god god is you know taking you to those places where you can come to maturity and i i'm afraid that uh oftentimes we all fail we all fail to be matured christians and failing to become mature christians is because we we don't know where it's coming from amen and i don't care how many times we say what the prophet said our greatest enemy is our ourselves amen i don't care how it cannot be over emphasized because until it gets over to us we always gonna think that our enemies walls and fighting who among you are you with me until we can look at ourselves amen knowing if things that god allows it to he allows it for purpose and things that we go through it is allowed and intended for a purpose that god can bring us into maturity you know joseph brothers i'm talking about friendly fire joseph brothers uh sold him into uh uh slavery and so forth and and and they kept on people kept on doing stuff to joseph but joseph in the process he was getting into maturity are you with me it was all about maturing what kind of what's coming walls and fights and so i'm talking about coming into maturity sometimes you have to go through some troubling things you know i was talking to this um a group yesterday and i was talking about you know certain things you you you learn certain things you experience and so you'll know how amen to encourage others you'll know how to help others amen certain things you learn as parents that you might be able to help your children but while you was going through you was in the learning process but you know now because you've already learned certain things you can tell a young couple what they can go through because you've experienced certain things are you with me so certain things amen that are one that has completed courses sometimes you can uh tutor somebody caleb because you you've already you know went through the math and all that so and rachel and so different ones you you can do help people after after you've gotten help yourself are you with me so there's certain things that you can do amen as a as grandparents brother friends certain things you can do amen that experience what it's like to be a grandparent what it's like amen that you can help people with amen so but by the grace of god if you've never been there you just uh you know because you know you your spiritual god might help you to give a little good advice but it's nothing like you know experiences amen nothing like you know you're experiencing certain things and once you experience certain things you can say well you know i've been there amen once you've been through the battle you've been through the walls then you can speak on it some people are speaking because they learned about it and they read about it but some people have experienced it amen none of us have experienced what uh brother franken sister betty experienced uh we can't speak we can talk about god is a healer and god can bring you back from death doing uh you know all of that but we ain't experiencing so they can you know you know let me tell you what god can do they can speak for me from an experienced standpoint so what i'm saying is is is coming into maturity and coming into uh a church that god can accept amen that you said the bride his wife has made herself ready amen i'm talking about ready to get out of here ready for rapture so we gotta have the mind it says the 11th verse when i was a child i what i'm going to tell you something sometimes we all are victims of still being children and still speaking as children do unto others as they do unto us that's not what jesus says amen that sometimes we still you know using the word to allow advantage for what purpose to consume it upon our own lust amen we use it because we want the bible says not your what yourself for it is written vengeance i will say the lord isn't that right i will repay but sometimes amen when we're children you know we all sometimes respond react out of haste and hurry and we all respond and not even knowing our own response sometimes we cannot love uh uh those that you know really uh have said something or done something to us in past we can't just let it go and said i forgive and it's all over with sometimes we always holding on to it are you with me but when we were children we did that when we were children it was an eye for an eye you know two foot two isn't that right but when we when we grow up in the maturity we become more christ-like he said let this mind be in you that was also in christ what did he do amen how did he do amen they had friendly fire he said father forgive them because they what no not what they do amen it's something about us coming into maturity they meant that the devil does not want a mature church he don't want a mature church that's going to behave and conduct their lives like jesus conducted himself when he was on earth he don't want us to conduct our lives that way so the devil would have us holding on to things that we need to let go amen he knows that you i i'm talking my brother and sister i'm still learning and i'm still growing amen but i'm i'm learning to let go certain things and release them and say it doesn't matter amen we're too close to heaven now i told brother nathan we too close i mean we we we oh no amen what what folk do to us and say about us well man they didn't mean it you know i i said in mueller's the other night i said that that didn't mean what uh they said well what brother branham that said song so he said that didn't mean it it's oh no no we're gonna let it go and i'm gonna tell you something they didn't want bro the brother to let it go but he said that was a trial a name before the foundation in the world i let it go [Music] let it go it don't mean nothing don't hold all this stuff let it go it don't mean nothing what is going to do for you they ain't gonna do a thing to hold on to something somebody said or done to you it ain't gonna do a thing but keep you hurt and keep you feeling bad keep you looking at them strange keep your acting straight no let it go if that did that didn't mean it how about if god just hold something against you and say you've done it yeah i'm not in that and i'm in it no no no no no that's the way the proud i've done it i meant what i didn't know i said it no no no no no no no that's the way the proud god resists the proud he gives grace to the world we don't you know we don't want you to flesh your eyes up god uh does certain things to see what kind of response you're gonna do you're gonna give because he allows certain things to operate now he allows certain things to happen and we give the response sometimes as children not as mature christians i'm not talking about you i'm my media i'm talking about all of us we give responses sometimes and you know god look at us you ain't grown up yet you're not able to handle the swole amen you're not able to handle spoken word you're not able to you know you're not able to come to adoptionism yet you cannot really i cannot give amen full authority and power in your hands as of yet because you need maturity to handle the swole but this is the king sword are you with me so he says here uh when i was a child because you got to my when i was a child i spoke as a child i understood as a child and i and he said i thought as a child you know even you know even our thinking i mean sometimes it's it's childish but we got to elevate we got to be elevated we got to grow i i'm gonna tell you something if your children are teenagers and you're giving them a color book in in church to try to keep them you know give them a little cram and color book okay aaron be good here go some people here to work with i know what renee would give him not a culling book you know what i'm saying but but at the same time we got they got to you got to teach them that we're expecting certain things of you you know and when a child gets to a certain stage you you spiritually we can come to certain levels that the prophet talked about a a nickel a dime a penny a 50 cent piece uh a full dollar you know some people now you can't make 50 cents a dollar and you can't make a nickel a dime are you with me you guys just got to see what what god is placing you and you must amen all that god gave you amen you must use it to its full protection everything god gave to you use it to its full potential and then it may not never equal up to what you might think of somebody else has because god has given you your potion and that he's gonna require that which he gave you in that day amen what god has given to you god gonna come back to you then what do you do with the life that i gave you are you with me god what is required of you as an individual and that's why sometimes what sometimes pastors and preachers we can try to push you to to to a place that we want everybody to be on the same level but everybody would never be on the same level you got to recognize with your children some uh might be straight a student some might be a b student and some might just make it but thank the lord but you try to push them to be a because so-and-so on his a and plus on his b but uh something might have a nice skill a nice trade and might make more money and some more successfully in life with that when they got all the intellectual knowledge and all but yet that don't mean they won't be successful in life so you got to recognize amen how amen i'm pushing you this way and i'm trying to make you go to see in in the spirit realm there's certain levels and certain things that you might desire you might look at your own self and think that you should be on the level so and so on and sometimes people put people up amen in church because they've been there the longest amen because they've been doing this and that for a long time but if god can uh uh you might be max out but amen and something amen somebody might could come and pass your level somebody can come and just you know do something on that organ and make caleb look like amen you're in elementary school and you and caleb can say now i've been here longer nobody was here i mean i mean you know you don't just come messing with my uh this is my heart don't don't don't don't don't cover yours don't be covetous don't be areas don't be jealous don't think that god cannot you know and as a pastor you know uh well you know i have been the pastor here and i need no no no no let the spirit of god have preeminence let the holy ghost move the way he wants to move use he wants to use don't don't don't just come and dominate nothing amen god is in control of the church the holy ghost knows what is needed we got to be open to let the spirit have preeminence no no no no well we won't you know we go by a little long jeopardy and go by what we see and all of that oh no no no no no nobody can take your place and what god allows we got to move out of the way say god you allah let us go are you with me let's not let's not just say what god i i don't see see the bible said to be carnal mind in this enmity against god and not subject to the laws of god neither indeed can it be but to be spiritual minded is life and it's peace are you look man so when we when we spiritual minded you know that nobody can take your place are you a man but to be called the mind that ah you can do it i ain't gonna touch it no more don't ever ask me to do nothing i ain't gonna do nothing that's all right well what come out of you child when i was a child i'm taking my ball and going home i ain't playing with you no more because they lost y'all see how they how you're acting and little children i'm taking my ball and go go home i ain't know what we're playing no more yo your team lost it it's time for the next team up the play but the ball belonged to me i'm telling my ball going home now nobody playing if i can't play you you see what i'm saying our children do that kind of stuff amen but when they get up to a certain age don't try to take that ball home cause you'll be in a lot of trouble you got to leave that ball you can go home but you better leave that ball down brother frank could tell you about that we know about that by the grace of god uh are you up man but y'all understand i'm telling you things in life and in the spirit realm that you can understand the natural but and i want you to understand the spirit that god is going to require i don't care if you're bald i don't care how long you you you've been playing ball god can let a little somebody come out there and join your high school not play the college fellas oh you're a man this is why you come from that don't make no difference where you come from one thing about it you better get him on your team that you want to win are you with me so what what i'm i'm saying the gifts and calling of god are without repentance and who god blessed can't no man curse and who god curses everybody can bless him but we but we got to be mindful how god works in the spirit realm and we got to sit back and say god you're walking you're moving let god move don't put brakes on god let the holy ghost move let god use you amen as much as he wants him when he don't need you say well let me be here and let me push the other fellow are you what man god let me let me be spiritual enough amen just to push you off the fella you know what god uh elect you he began to advance you he began to take you to levels because you got the right attitude are you look man when you got the right attitude god might let you become the coach are you with me then you're still at a place that you on another level why because you had the right attitude and look at god begin to impart some things amen that you didn't know was in you because you had the right attitude god is going to continually bless you amen you wouldn't have never discovered certain things that certain things wouldn't have happened are you with me but if you'd have had a bad attitude god could not give you what he wanted to give you in that particular instance are you up man it's your attitude the right attitude amen that god can give you amen things that you never thought you could have blessing that you couldn't have room enough to receive because you kept the right attitude not take your ball and go home okay so uh by the grace of god we're going places in christ the church is a need that the church moved quickly into maturity amen the church moved quickly into maturity there has to be a a quick move into maturity to understand that god is calling the church into perfection amen calling them to capstone ministry headstones god is calling us to a place in christ amen that we must attain we must reach and it's an urgent it's an urgent time it's a time to pray it's a time to seek god because god is doing something in the spirit realm as much as the urgency is one virus after another and stuff is coming up on the natural that is it it's causing a shake up in the world and shake up and and from all angles the economy everything shook up amen was because god is saying when the enemy come in like a flood the spirit of the lord will live of a standing are you with me so god has got a standard amen that he's going to give you and i and so the bride must quickly advance in maturity quickly grow up don't let things amen shake you up no more grow up fast amen because god is requiring certain things now he says uh i thought as a child i understood as a child and what brother caleb but when i became a but when i became a man i put away childish things when we become now now we don't we never come a man we're not gonna never put away childish things now you might understand that david before he could get to the throne that you know he he killed goliath and all of that was good but that didn't last but a little while sometimes certain victories in your wall amen where god want to take you certain victories don't end it amen when everybody's you know patting you on the back because amen you just killed the giant and amen everybody loves you but it won't be long but for somebody to get jealous of you are you with me and the one that got jealous of him was the one that amen david was anointed king and he didn't know it and i'm going to tell you brother and sister if god has ordained you before the foundation of the world as known as you as kings and priests before him it meant the world is going to get jealous of you and then amen now god had given uh saul the position as king and and why he's going to be jealous of david amen which david loved him and david respected him and david was gonna you know he was all right but the women you know this outside forces the women began to sing that saul has killed his thousand but david has killed his ten thousand so they and saul said uh um you see what they doing they they're disrespecting my leadership and their exalting david which uh yeah uh huh uh i'm not gonna put up with that are you with me see what happens is amen when there's a position they'll change where god is doing something and bringing somebody instead of us being glad for them we get jealous of them are you with me that's a lack of that's immaturity instead of getting jealous we ought to be glad for him and thank god well he thank you so much she thinks she's up i can sing together well i don't know why they don't call on me yeah they be calling on me i've been doing that years before they started who they think they are you know it's all kind of spirits get on people all kind of attitudes come out of people and saul got his little attitude i i why did why didn't it say saul had killed his ten thousand david killed his thousand what what's going on in here you know the church having an uh uh uh we're having revival a move of god and the enemy's being destroyed we have a victory out the victory and they're gonna exalt somebody over me i'm the king who they think they are i'm the pastor you know what i'm saying don't let us not be mindful amen god amen has already foresaw david and the kind of heart he had and god was giving respect amen but he's on our side let's not have friendly fire and when saul got disturbed by evil spirit from the law trouble him and david come and play and give him peace all of that david was displaying and that was the man that wanted to kill him he took a javelin and he quoted that david tried to you know what i'm saying and david had to run for his life because saul was seeking to kill him the man that fought in his army and fought the battles for him and always you know what i'm saying with the people you try to help the people you stand in the gap for the people you lean on your life for sometimes the ma oh our enemies are the foes of our own house friendly fire are you a man because they don't understand he came into his own but his own received them not they didn't understand him brother and sister when when when you're being misunderstood just was taken like jesus took in amen when you're being misunderstood take it like uh uh you know i'm telling you i i god said you know i told brother ernest i felt like i need to speak to y'all because the message is to y'all and i said i won't go to something i'll stay here you know it's it it's something that god said i'm calling the people to an urgency of becoming mature amen stop acting quit you like me and stop acting like babies stop acting like children but amen let's let's grow up let's become matured amen because god want to use you god want to bless you god want to take your higher amen and we got to amen recognize that this is what god is focusing on getting our attention where he can take his way we need to be where he wants us to be oh you look man so by the grace of god read that again kill but when i became a what a man i put away childish things see that that's what i'm saying when i became a man i put away childish things now i'm not going to put over the way see god dealt with the correcting the church because they were calling them he said i could not forget you with meat because you ain't able to bad i got to stay with milk because you're calling the money are you with me see god he's waiting on the opportunity to advance the bride to take her into his arms and say i love you and let's go to the marriage supper of the lamb are you with me but he cannot do it to the bride grow up the church got to grow up amen until the statue of a perfect man and when she grows up and realizes that she's matured now amen she's no more acting like babes and acting like children amen she no longer thinking like a child she's she's understanding what the will of god go ahead on keller read the next verse for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part that then shall i know even as also i am known and now abide as i also am known see god knows you he foreknew you as i'm known god knows the bible said john jesus said i lost none all that the father has given me i kept through your word amen i've lost none say one that's the son of perdition he was a nine from the beginning and i'm saying god knows how to keep knows them that are his even as i'm known god knew you and and you got to know amen that i i i'm looking for a reflection in the mirror of god and i'm looking to see jesus in me the very attitude the very divine nature of god i'm looking for it to be his own display amen i'm looking for a bride that has amen the divine nature amen but she must allow amen from the attributes of the seed amen to express amen faith uh virtue knowledge and so forth and let it come to full fruition amen let it come to full maturity till we'll walk and not just in uh uh uh a godliness a brotherly kindness but we're going on to a perfect love are you with me what we can love amen you know love in spite of amen love freely amen sometimes it's going to hurt a little bit but when you become a man shake it off amen shake yourself amen just shake things off oh uh-uh i got one thing i got heaven on my mind i'm on my way to heaven and amen and the kingdom of heaven is not meat and drink but righteousness peace and what joy in the holy ghost and i'm not going to let nobody take this joy they meant away from me amen because god hallelujah gave me this joy i can give it away but nobody can take it from me amen praise god look at the last version okay and now about it faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity yeah god is love are you with me amen whosoever bodies in god about it in love amen if you're gonna abide in god you're going to abide in love are you with me and and that's what i i i said it's a lack of love let's go back to james where we can close james 4. and i'll try to complete it okay james 4 and one let's let's just y'all all right this morning god is good i i need to stop and come back for another day are y'all all right can i go a little further y'all with me okay okay go ahead on caleb when from whence from whence cometh wars and fighting among you come thee not hence even of your lusts the war is in your members see as paul says there's a wall going on in my mind when i desire to do good what he was present with me amen so he says but the weapon though we walk in the flesh we do not walk after the flesh at second corinthians 10 and 3. amen for the weapons of our wall found not karma are you with me so but they are modded through god to the pulling down of strongholds so we must come to maturity and realize amen though we walk amen this flesh don't let it don't get caught up in this amen this flesh won't yo you to protect the flesh but this flesh got to die and the only way it's going to die amen you got to allow amen it to be destroyed mortified therefore your members upon the earth are you with me you got to die out to yourself as paul said i die daily are you with me so you got to realize that even the enemy that i got that's the greatest one amen how am i gonna kill it how god gonna kill it amen because you're gonna overcome evil with what good you're gonna love your enemies you're gonna forgive those no matter what they do or say about you you're gonna have forgiveness in your heart and the love for them you're not gonna hold it against them are you with me go head on you lust and have not you kill and desire to have and cannot attain you fight you you kill the desire to have but go ahead you fight in war yet ye have not because you ask not yes yet you have not because you ask not you know it was said a lot of people praying and they're acting but they're not receiving the reason why they're not receiving it's because what they're asking for it it's for a purpose they want to consume it you know people pray and cry to god nice for and it's not going to present humility it's going to make them oh i know the lord heard my prayers and i prayed for this one and they got well and i literally died you know all about them a lot of times i've been accused the president said i think he's just talking think he can do this and all can use him and i'll use me too i said so i know god god keep us humble keep us watchful you see because sometimes what folks think about you and what folks say about you it doesn't matter it doesn't matter but what does matter when you come up against the enemy that god comes and vindicate who you are are you with me sometimes god will let things happen and he'll say hey this my daughter that's my son and folks will keep on talking they might talk more but god will vindicate who you are it doesn't matter god approve it don't worry about it amen god approve who you are if you just keep on loving and don't let the outside world bother you stay humble don't try to prove your right and them wrong because that's charlie's stuff i didn't know i don't want to tell you i'm right and you're wrong no no no no that's all right you can be right then finally ain't got time who right who wrote who said this who said that ain't got time for that it's time for maturity let's go to heaven are you with me because that don't matter anyway it ain't no it ain't nothing we're falling up but when you're a child you think oh no no no mommy hey mommy you saying something about me the teacher go go to school tell that teacher mama you say something about my child got to stay in prayer and make sure you go in the right spirit if you got to go but a lot of times you you might not have to go until you get a word from the law see you got to get a word from the law sometimes we get overprotective uh are you with me sometimes we're in a hurry before we pray and see what god has to say about it because we can get we can get we can fight for somebody that god ain't fighting for god trying to get him a good uh lesson a good weapon and we don't took off in front of god and god honoring you because he honors you are you a man god honors you because of who you are with him but sometimes we need to let sometimes folk go through certain things because god is trying to bring them as individuals into maturity but sometimes we ain't gonna let them get their weapons are you with me are y'all with me sometimes we stop god from chastising somebody because we think that god don't know what he's doing if we'd only prayed about it god would say hold your peace be still because i'm god are you with me i was in prayer yesterday and i started praying for a child and i started praying and i just i was shocked i just prayed and kept praying for the child because i was you know closing out praying with the family and i'm praying i started praying for the child because the child standing there holding hands with us and i just what they were praying and calling their child's name and just praying and the grandmama said you know something you didn't know what happened the other day this child just got beat up pushed his head down teeth broken being bullied at school and you started in a scene praying that god would send his angels to camp about him and to do this to that so you didn't know that did you you didn't know why he was calling his name how you start zeroing in on the prayer as we're getting ready to dismiss from here and you're going to praying like that i said well you know i didn't know but god knew isn't that right see that's what i'm saying god will fight for you if you just let god do it amen but some are parents that child did my child like that i'm going to school now i'm alright let me see that child you know but god will take care of things for you just be still and know that i'm god are you with me god is good he'll take care of things for you you know i'm looking for you know greater results for that child in his life okay go ahead hold on i got to i got to close i better close nine i just i'm closing in the middle of this lesson god is good amen but i wanted to show you some things amen i wanted to show you the friendship of the work pride maybe it's just a little lesson how what caused war in heaven what caused lucifer to act up it was the battle of the wheels and there's a battle right now of the wheels god will and your will are you wiping lucifer said i will amen so his will to do what he want because of pride his heart was lifted up if he can help cause war in heaven what about wall going on among us which comes as walls and fire it's because of pride and if you read on nine and james he said god resisted the what pride and giving grace to the world and that's what we're dealing with people god is trying to let us recognize he's expecting matured christians to be be humble people it's not the proud he resists the pride but give lord you know all things will work together to the good to them to love you it's going to work to my good anyhow i'm not worried about it you know i'm not worried about it's going to work it's working to my good if god allows it it's going to work to my good but if i get myself in the way as thought saul said i touch not god's anointed amen they say david had a chance to take saul ahead the kill song and he said he told us he told his uh the ones that was with him don't touch god's anointing i don't care what you're able to do to sign don't you touch him are you with me and i'm saying to you amen god amen don't won't you fight in one among another thinking evil one or another god wants you to love one another with in spite of what's said or done just love and do good for one another amen praise god we all gonna make mistakes whether in word or we don't make mistake in the world we would be a perfect man am i right but we all gonna make mistakes we all guilty of the fact that we all make mistakes amen sometimes we act black children sometimes we conduct ourselves like children so what we need to grow up we all need some growth paul said as a department departure going he said i fought a good fight what's coming to wars and fighting in the monk he said i fought a good fight i finished my amen i finished my course amen you have a course i have a course each and every one of us got to fight the good fight of faith that we might lay hold on eternal life faith is holding on to the thing that means more and dear to us in this hour that is to walk in love to walk in love and walk amen knowing that god will take care of all i mean don't try to avenge yourself don't try to worry about you as an individual because that is that part of you got to die we got to be crucified we got to die out to self and let god will be done i don't know where he taken me i don't know what he's doing in my life but i know god is in control of it all god bless you let us stand he's in control are you with me praise god let us just bow father in jesus name lord i thank you this morning because you're in control you knows it all and father that's what we want we want to come to maturity hallelujah with no more children
