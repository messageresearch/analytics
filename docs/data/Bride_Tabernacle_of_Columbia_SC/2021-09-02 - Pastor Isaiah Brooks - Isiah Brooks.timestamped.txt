[43:12] i started walking backwards and forth
[43:15] and down the highways i said my house
[43:17] for jesus don't you people see what's
[43:19] going on the is walking now
[43:23] [Applause]
[43:26] but so far down here i never got to tell
[43:29] you all what i saw
[43:32] while i was in glory
[43:37] you ever heard of the colored lights and
[43:39] aaron's breastplate in in revelations 4.
[43:45] now i've been in god's blessings and we
[43:47] clap our hands and we scream and run the
[43:49] hallways and things like that i've been
[43:51] there
[43:53] i've been into god's
[43:55] presence under the anointing of the holy
[43:57] ghost preaching i've been there
[44:00] but i never felt or seen anything like
[44:03] this
[44:04] to enter into god's
[44:06] glory and i saw all these lights
[44:09] flashing
[44:11] all these colored lights as i was being
[44:13] lifted up and
[44:15] i tell everybody in this tent i don't
[44:16] care what you have to give up who you
[44:18] have to bypass what you ever have to do
[44:20] don't you miss that place called glory
[44:25] and so there was two questions had been
[44:27] on my mind for 20 years and i by god i
[44:29] said lord
[44:31] where is he at where can i find it at
[44:35] he said go to revelations 4 for part 1
[44:39] and i used this in a
[44:42] church of god a prophecy funeral the
[44:44] other night and
[44:46] the pastor asked me to preach his
[44:47] daddy's funeral i didn't know the
[44:49] general overseer or the state of
[44:50] tennessee was sitting there but
[44:53] i said first thing god said he said now
[44:55] look closely there's one that sits on
[44:58] the throne
[45:00] and the only thing in the bible that men
[45:02] the devil agrees on is this only one god
[45:06] and so
[45:08] i got a chance to tell them i said
[45:09] there's only one that sits on the throne
[45:12] i said now god said that second part you
[45:14] want to see look over
[45:16] revelations five and five
[45:20] i looked over and that one that said on
[45:22] the throne the first time in all the
[45:24] history of mankind that lamb stood up
[45:28] and i see that lamb open that book of
[45:30] redemption and guess what i saw
[45:33] a name on the lounge book of life named
[45:35] bill yachts
[45:38] i said take me on back you don't have to
[45:39] tell me anything else that's all i want
[45:42] but i i don't think i'd ever mentioned
[45:44] that here before but
[45:46] that started
[45:48] miraculous things happen in my life
[45:51] and since that time i had another mini
[45:53] stroke
[45:54] two months ago i stand in the pulpit my
[45:56] hand started being numb and my face was
[45:59] numb
[46:00] the nurse said
[46:01] and the church chair said you better get
[46:03] to the emergency room quickly you're
[46:04] having a mini stroke
[46:06] so that's what i had mini stroke
[46:09] so that's two strokes i had three heart
[46:12] attacks
[46:13] i had three times in the hospital with
[46:15] pneumonia i had double hernia surgery
[46:19] and even before i went into the surgery
[46:21] uh they put that cap on me you know like
[46:23] when they take you in the surgery room
[46:25] and
[46:26] my doctor said he was in there and all
[46:28] the doctors and nurses was in the
[46:29] surgery room he said hey everybody come
[46:31] over here
[46:34] and so all the doctors and nurses here
[46:35] they come over to my bed he said i want
[46:38] to introduce you all to a real
[46:40] international missionary
[46:42] and he gave me his own personal
[46:44] testimony telephone number he said now
[46:46] anytime you need me
[46:48] you call me on this number
[46:51] make friends
[46:53] but that ain't
[46:54] all god this just keeps raising me up
[46:59] i was in the pulpit preaching like
[47:00] sunday morning i was telling some of
[47:01] them before service i looked back and i
[47:03] said hey devil
[47:05] let me tell you something
[47:08] when i get done with you you'll rust
[47:10] that you'd have never heard my name in
[47:12] the earth
[47:15] is everybody in your love the devil i
[47:17] thought i'd get a lot of amens on that
[47:19] you don't feel like that too
[47:22] but i'm slower and i'm older than i've
[47:24] ever been
[47:26] but i'm still going
[47:33] does anybody believe in prophecy
[47:37] there was a man stood in a chair right
[47:38] behind my pulpit after he preached
[47:42] he stood up and prophesied he said god
[47:44] is going to restore this pastor 100
[47:47] percent
[47:51] last sunday morning i got up and
[47:54] i cough all the time i have been for 15
[47:56] years
[47:58] so i got up and and i vomit something
[48:00] black
[48:02] and fell in the commode
[48:04] i heard the voice say you are healed
[48:10] and brother larry the devil has fought
[48:11] me all week long trying to stop me but i
[48:14] keep telling everybody i'm healed
[48:16] [Music]
[48:17] you just watch and see
[48:20] and if god has to wait till i get a
[48:22] brand new 18 year old body at 77 years
[48:25] old i'll take it
[48:33] would you like to hear 1500 more
[48:34] testimonies
[48:39] well i better tell you
[48:40] where i've been for the last year i have
[48:43] not been outside of my church door
[48:46] god spoke to me seven years ago and he
[48:48] said go home and stay with your church
[48:52] i kept seeing all these miraculous
[48:54] things
[48:55] taking place
[48:56] i said surely god you're with me if all
[48:59] this is happening
[49:02] he gave me a stroke
[49:04] you know what as quick as i got feeling
[49:06] better i took off again
[49:08] i was down in smithfield tennessee
[49:11] and i had a major heart attack
[49:13] i drove four and a half hours home
[49:16] but from smithfield to knoxville
[49:18] tennessee was the longest trip i ever
[49:20] made in my life
[49:22] god just kept telling me brother simmons
[49:24] did not i tell you to go home and stay
[49:25] at your church
[49:27] here i was gone
[49:28] again and just uh different places
[49:31] people call me and i'd go and i'd say
[49:33] god do all the miraculous thing
[49:35] so brother david farmer called me up in
[49:37] virginia and said brother bill come
[49:40] i said brother farmer this will be the
[49:41] last meeting i ever preached on the road
[49:44] i'm going home and i'm going to stay
[49:46] with my church like god is trying to
[49:48] kill me to get me to do
[49:50] and so i cried i come down the
[49:52] interstate crying and the altars were
[49:54] filled and god's power was moving
[49:56] it's it's just i'm not bragging but it's
[49:58] just when he sadly this happens
[50:01] and i was crying i said now god
[50:04] you've told me to go back to my church
[50:06] now for me to stay there and be
[50:08] encouraged these things that have been
[50:09] happening has to happen in my church too
[50:13] so you know what
[50:14] i've got testimony after testimony after
[50:16] testimony of god
[50:18] doing things for people in my church
[50:21] and we're those good there ain't many
[50:22] people left but you know what i got to
[50:24] looking at some words of jesus
[50:28] they uh there was a man one time in the
[50:30] bible that
[50:32] while hurried and get down here
[50:34] there was a man in the bible that had a
[50:35] son that had epileptic seizures and
[50:38] this boy was driving his daddy out of
[50:40] his mind and he said one minute he's in
[50:42] the fire next minute he's in the water
[50:44] and i can just imagine what this voice
[50:46] looked like but it got so desperate that
[50:48] daddy screamed jesus have mercy on me
[50:52] he said i brought my son unto the
[50:54] ministers of the hour
[50:56] which were the apostles of that time and
[50:59] oh you ministered around here to listen
[51:00] what i'm saying
[51:02] he said i brought him to the ministers
[51:04] of the iron they couldn't help him
[51:06] he said now brothers come aside i want
[51:08] to talk to you all a little bit
[51:10] now these things come he said by fasting
[51:13] in prayer
[51:15] but first of all this man told jesus he
[51:17] said i'm not worthy that you can even
[51:19] come by my house he said just speak the
[51:21] word
[51:22] and he talked to jesus a few things but
[51:24] i tell this and do this and this and he
[51:26] said you know what i have not found
[51:29] so great of faith no not in all israel
[51:33] now you might fuss at me but when i pray
[51:35] for the sick i i don't even take a
[51:38] bottle of water no more
[51:40] that's in the bible
[51:42] but my prophet said it was a jewish
[51:43] tradition
[51:45] and that's what we're all getting for
[51:46] come to where the great faith is at in
[51:50] the power of the holy ghost of god speak
[51:52] what you ask for
[51:53] and don't be afraid that watch it happen
[51:56] if you don't think it's going to happen
[51:58] there ain't no use for you to speak it
[52:01] and then another place jesus looked
[52:03] turned around looked at him he said now
[52:04] what's harder
[52:06] now you all have grandchildren and
[52:08] children like i do and seem like it you
[52:10] could bag and plead and try to get them
[52:12] into the house of god
[52:14] but jesus said what's harder
[52:17] than to say take up thy bed and walk or
[52:19] say thy seems to be forgiven thee
[52:23] and if we we are supposed to possess a
[52:27] power
[52:28] that comes from our lips
[52:30] that actually limbs will be restored on
[52:33] people's body
[52:35] now if we can do that what's better what
[52:37] about the rest of it
[52:40] i'm sorry brother simmons i'm going to
[52:41] quit without about 1200 more
[52:43] testimonials keeps coming
[52:45] i get excited but i want you to know
[52:48] my fight is not over yet
[52:53] my fight against the enemy's not yet he
[52:55] thinks he's going to whoop us i'm sorry
[52:57] he's got the wrong chicken
[53:00] because i'm going to fight him because
[53:01] he ain't nothing but a stupid lyra

[53:06] and when you read isaiah 14 and 12
[53:08] is this the man
[53:10] that calls nation to him
[53:14] is that really him he ain't he's a
[53:16] nothing he's a nobody hey brother isaiah

[1:09:07] tonight i know this is a thursday night
[1:09:10] some of us have to go to work in the
[1:09:11] morning
[1:09:14] so it's okay if

[1:09:23] i believe this message that the lord has
[1:09:25] given me tonight
[1:09:27] really doesn't take long shouldn't take
[1:09:29] long
[1:09:32] but it depends upon your attitude toward
[1:09:34] the word
[1:09:37] i really believe that all things are
[1:09:39] possible to them that believe
[1:09:42] talking about miracles
[1:09:45] i'm the greatest miracle i have ever
[1:09:48] seen
[1:09:48] [Music]
[1:09:51] because when god changed me he changed
[1:09:54] me
[1:09:56] philippians 2 4
[1:10:01] we've come a long ways people
[1:10:04] and i'm excited because i see the
[1:10:07] finishing line
[1:10:09] [Music]
[1:10:11] this is not a time to
[1:10:13] fight
[1:10:16] each other
[1:10:18] you won't make it that way
[1:10:22] because this age is calling for perfect
[1:10:25] love
[1:10:27] when satan can get us to fight
[1:10:31] to backbite
[1:10:33] or to criticize
[1:10:36] first of all you're fallen
[1:10:38] when you do that
[1:10:41] you defeat it
[1:10:43] when you do that
[1:10:45] because all of us have saved we're saved
[1:10:49] by the grace of god
[1:10:52] the same blood that saves a rich man
[1:10:55] is the same blood that saves a poor man
[1:11:01] the blood that saves
[1:11:04] a well man
[1:11:06] is the same blood that heals and save a
[1:11:08] crippled man
[1:11:10] one blood
[1:11:13] and by the grace of god i trust that we
[1:11:15] have
[1:11:16] the love of god in our hearts to
[1:11:18] understand the hour that we're living in
[1:11:22] philippians 2 4.
[1:11:29] let this mind be in you
[1:11:33] which was also in christ jesus
[1:11:40] let's pray
[1:11:42] heavenly father we thank you for your
[1:11:45] grace
[1:11:47] we thank you for your mercy
[1:11:50] we thank you for everything you have
[1:11:52] done thus far
[1:11:55] i know this is the beginning of the
[1:11:57] services and
[1:12:00] but lord
[1:12:02] you have no respect to person
[1:12:05] we didn't come
[1:12:06] to do a hollywood thing
[1:12:11] we've only come to hear from you
[1:12:14] give us the grace to move complete
[1:12:17] hallelujah out of your way
[1:12:22] to our hearts
[1:12:24] and we'll be careful to give you the
[1:12:25] praise
[1:12:27] the glory and honor
[1:12:29] in your lovely name jesus christ we pray
[1:12:32] amen you may be seated
[1:12:40] every time i
[1:12:43] think about
[1:12:44] what god has done
[1:12:50] which are wretch like me
[1:12:56] when i see how
[1:12:58] in these last days
[1:13:01] that he's actually calling for a people
[1:13:06] that he himself
[1:13:08] has created
[1:13:12] when we look at philippians we think
[1:13:14] that paul is you know that's the way it
[1:13:16] was with me
[1:13:18] i thought it was something you know your
[1:13:20] mind is just something you know just a
[1:13:22] piece of part of you
[1:13:26] but i find out that the mind
[1:13:29] is actually your character
[1:13:33] because the bible says as a man thinketh
[1:13:36] in his heart
[1:13:40] so is he
[1:13:42] and just to think
[1:13:45] that god
[1:13:46] has given us
[1:13:48] an opportunity
[1:13:51] to allow his mind
[1:13:54] to be in us
[1:13:57] it does something for me
[1:14:01] because i realize amen that you cannot
[1:14:04] have the mind of god in you
[1:14:07] along with your own mind
[1:14:11] there's something that i feel that in
[1:14:13] this message or in this way of living we
[1:14:16] have missed
[1:14:19] there's nothing wrong with the shouting
[1:14:22] in the dancing
[1:14:23] there's nothing wrong with healings and
[1:14:26] deliverances
[1:14:28] but i want you to understand
[1:14:31] it's not everything
[1:14:35] because the very thing that god came to
[1:14:37] do
[1:14:39] for us
[1:14:40] in this generation
[1:14:43] is to restore
[1:14:44] his life
[1:14:47] the very thing that adam lost
[1:14:50] was the very mind of god
[1:14:54] he lost his character
[1:14:57] and listen people
[1:14:59] i believe in shouting
[1:15:01] i believe in dancing
[1:15:03] i believe in running around the altar
[1:15:06] whatever y'all know that to be true you
[1:15:10] see me do it
[1:15:12] but i've come to find out
[1:15:14] that the greatest thing a man or woman
[1:15:17] could have would be the life of god
[1:15:21] hallelujah
[1:15:23] we know by god's grace
[1:15:26] when you and i get can get into the
[1:15:28] channel of christ do you know what that
[1:15:30] means
[1:15:32] even jesus himself said that i can do
[1:15:35] nothing except the father show me
[1:15:38] hallelujah it's more than a feeling
[1:15:42] somebody help me here
[1:15:44] it's more than a feeling somebody it's
[1:15:47] more than your church that you associate
[1:15:49] with
[1:15:50] god don't care about your system of
[1:15:53] worship
[1:15:54] god wants somebody who's free
[1:15:58] the bible said where where he who the
[1:16:00] son is set free is free indeed
[1:16:04] i feel that so many people
[1:16:07] have literally married a system
[1:16:10] instead of jesus christ
[1:16:13] somebody help me here
[1:16:15] we learn how to shout we learn how to
[1:16:18] dance and some of us even learn how to
[1:16:21] speak in tongues but that's not it
[1:16:25] that may be a part of it but that's not
[1:16:28] all of it and i don't know about you
[1:16:30] tonight i don't want a part of god i
[1:16:33] don't want a peace of god i want all of
[1:16:37] him
[1:16:41] hallelujah
[1:16:43] god is real
[1:16:46] hallelujah
[1:16:48] you and i must understand
[1:16:50] by god's grace
[1:16:53] we are unworthy creatures
[1:16:56] mortal men
[1:16:58] that god has invited
[1:17:00] to become immortal
[1:17:03] hallelujah
[1:17:04] come on somebody
[1:17:07] it doesn't matter i know some of y'all
[1:17:08] have those masks on but i can still hear
[1:17:10] you
[1:17:14] when we look at it
[1:17:17] and we see by god's grace
[1:17:20] that in this hour we're no longer called
[1:17:23] church
[1:17:25] we're called bride
[1:17:28] hallelujah now you must understand
[1:17:32] because we said well brother brooks
[1:17:35] what are you saying
[1:17:36] i'm saying
[1:17:38] in 1963
[1:17:41] god
[1:17:42] changed and he moved in a way that so
[1:17:46] many people missed it
[1:17:49] but those who ordained
[1:17:52] to be the bride of jesus christ
[1:17:55] they caught it
[1:17:57] what was he doing calling us avalia
[1:18:00] deceil
[1:18:02] hallelujah
[1:18:04] into an eternal place
[1:18:07] hallelujah
[1:18:08] and there is only one internal place and
[1:18:11] that's christ himself
[1:18:13] hallelujah
[1:18:15] but you don't get there by being a
[1:18:17] church member
[1:18:20] hallelujah
[1:18:21] we fail to see and you know i'm telling
[1:18:24] you the truth
[1:18:26] there have been many people who when
[1:18:27] they got the holy ghost they thought
[1:18:29] that was it
[1:18:31] hallelujah
[1:18:33] but that's just the beginning of it
[1:18:36] hallelujah you've got to grow
[1:18:39] you've got to mature
[1:18:41] you've got to allow the characteristics
[1:18:44] of christ to be formed in you
[1:18:48] hallelujah
[1:18:50] ask peter about it
[1:18:52] peter said add to your faith virtue
[1:18:54] virtual knowledge it goes all the way up
[1:18:58] into the full statue of christ
[1:19:01] hallelujah do you think
[1:19:04] god is going to take you higher
[1:19:08] when he's already said
[1:19:10] power
[1:19:11] without character is satanic
[1:19:16] hallelujah so it doesn't make any
[1:19:19] difference you can you can raise the
[1:19:21] dead
[1:19:22] hallelujah pray that the eyes of the
[1:19:25] blind is open
[1:19:26] but all those things are to no avail
[1:19:33] until christ
[1:19:35] be formed in you
[1:19:38] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:19:40] see because when you really got to
[1:19:42] genuine
[1:19:44] there's no turning back
[1:19:46] hallelujah when you really got the
[1:19:48] genuine there's no thirsting for the
[1:19:51] world
[1:19:53] when you really got the genuine wine
[1:19:56] you'll leave mother father sister
[1:19:59] brother whoever you lose leave everybody
[1:20:03] to follow jesus
[1:20:04] [Applause]
[1:20:07] hallelujah
[1:20:09] oh glory to god
[1:20:13] when you realize
[1:20:16] jesus even said to the overcomer
[1:20:20] i would grant you to sit with me in my
[1:20:22] throne
[1:20:24] even as i have sat in my father's throne
[1:20:27] maybe we just don't understand what that
[1:20:29] means
[1:20:31] but that's more than i would say
[1:20:32] authority
[1:20:34] hallelujah
[1:20:35] you see my brother brooks
[1:20:37] is it is the word open there was a time
[1:20:41] when the word was closed
[1:20:43] even in daniel's time is that right
[1:20:46] the book was sealed
[1:20:48] but in our day
[1:20:51] this bible is open
[1:20:53] it has become an open book
[1:20:56] why god has broken the seal
[1:20:58] hallelujah y'all understand what that
[1:21:01] means
[1:21:02] that means the whole book
[1:21:04] [Music]
[1:21:06] has been given to you
[1:21:10] hallelujah
[1:21:12] the bible is right
[1:21:14] jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:21:17] today and forever
[1:21:19] don't get me wrong
[1:21:21] i love the word
[1:21:23] hallelujah you say what do you mean i
[1:21:25] love the word
[1:21:27] worry about who's preaching
[1:21:30] if you think i'm preaching you missing
[1:21:32] the boat already
[1:21:33] but let me say it like this
[1:21:36] amen this book
[1:21:39] has always been the message
[1:21:45] hello somebody
[1:21:47] you can't separate god
[1:21:49] neither can you divide him up
[1:21:53] hallelujah is that right he said i am
[1:21:55] the alpha and the omega the beginning
[1:21:58] and the end and if you read this book
[1:22:01] and can't see christ read it again
[1:22:10] hallelujah
[1:22:13] glory to god
[1:22:15] what we fail to see
[1:22:17] is what we call the message
[1:22:19] was just a restoration
[1:22:24] of that which was
[1:22:26] is that right
[1:22:28] he's a which was which is and which now
[1:22:32] god don't change
[1:22:34] hallelujah
[1:22:36] glory to god
[1:22:38] he said well go ahead on brother books i
[1:22:40] will
[1:22:41] so we understand by god's grace
[1:22:45] that often times can i say this without
[1:22:47] anybody getting mad
[1:22:49] when those seals were opened
[1:22:52] god if i could say it like this changed
[1:22:55] his throne room
[1:22:59] hallelujah
[1:23:01] see a lot of us think the throne room is
[1:23:03] in heaven
[1:23:06] but when god listen is that the truth
[1:23:09] even paul said
[1:23:11] behold
[1:23:14] i saw the lord
[1:23:16] descending
[1:23:18] in a cloud
[1:23:20] is that right
[1:23:22] so you understand amen what god
[1:23:24] ascending in the cloud i'm sorry
[1:23:26] ascending in the cloud
[1:23:28] but what john says i saw a mighty angel
[1:23:32] descending
[1:23:34] so the same one that ascended in paul's
[1:23:37] day
[1:23:38] is the same one john saw descending
[1:23:42] and he's here tonight
[1:23:46] hallelujah
[1:23:48] you say oh praise god
[1:23:51] we thought the holy ghost was just a
[1:23:52] shout out
[1:23:54] we thought the holy ghost was just a
[1:23:56] dance
[1:23:57] hallelujah praise god we spoke in
[1:23:59] tongues
[1:24:00] like like like pouring peas on a cow
[1:24:03] hide
[1:24:04] hallelujah
[1:24:06] and we found ourselves
[1:24:08] powerless
[1:24:13] and the reason being
[1:24:15] because you failed to move on
[1:24:18] somebody taught you
[1:24:21] because they taught me
[1:24:23] that this was the ultimate
[1:24:27] until this message came
[1:24:30] justification makes room for
[1:24:32] sanctification
[1:24:33] sanctification makes room for the holy
[1:24:36] ghost
[1:24:37] and holy ghost make rooms for what the
[1:24:40] person himself
[1:24:42] hallelujah i did not know
[1:24:46] that i was to have the whole person
[1:24:51] hallelujah
[1:24:52] the whole character
[1:24:55] come on somebody
[1:24:56] the whole character
[1:24:58] christ in you the hope of glory
[1:25:02] the bible says know ye not that you are
[1:25:05] the temple of the holy ghost
[1:25:08] hallelujah it is you who god
[1:25:12] has made the throne room
[1:25:18] hallelujah you say they ain't the bible
[1:25:19] yes it is
[1:25:21] the bible say don't even think he's up
[1:25:23] there
[1:25:24] on some long journey
[1:25:27] he says he's 90
[1:25:29] even in your mouth
[1:25:31] hallelujah
[1:25:33] and for those of us
[1:25:35] who think you can be spewing out of
[1:25:37] god's mouth
[1:25:38] it's impossible
[1:25:42] you never was in his mouth
[1:25:44] that was the layout to see you
[1:25:49] you say prove it
[1:25:51] can we go to esther just for a moment
[1:25:52] i'm gonna leave my notes right over
[1:25:54] there
[1:25:56] because he said i've engraved you
[1:25:58] in the palms of my hands
[1:26:00] that's not his mouth
[1:26:02] hallelujah god can't get rid of you
[1:26:05] no more than adam could get rid of eve
[1:26:08] somebody help me here
[1:26:09] because remember
[1:26:11] this thing with me and you just didn't
[1:26:14] happen
[1:26:15] come on somebody i wasn't saved amen in
[1:26:18] 1974
[1:26:21] i was saved before the foundation of the
[1:26:24] world
[1:26:28] hallelujah let me tell you something
[1:26:31] god don't take chances
[1:26:37] i want to say to those who are not
[1:26:39] saved yet or you may not understand what
[1:26:41] i'm trying to say but i'm telling you
[1:26:44] there's a greater god there's more of
[1:26:46] him
[1:26:48] hallelujah there's more of him and when
[1:26:52] you are in a system
[1:26:54] systems always make you miss god
[1:26:58] amen
[1:27:01] hallelujah
[1:27:02] oh yes
[1:27:04] there's a lot of people that's in a
[1:27:05] message system
[1:27:09] hallelujah y'all better hear what i'm
[1:27:11] saying
[1:27:12] it didn't stop at the pentecost
[1:27:14] it moved right on up here
[1:27:17] that's why people are not happy anymore
[1:27:20] that's why they don't have the joy they
[1:27:22] used to have that's why they don't pray
[1:27:25] and fast hallelujah because they have
[1:27:27] allowed themselves to be married to a
[1:27:30] system
[1:27:34] hallelujah
[1:27:36] but he whom the son is set free
[1:27:39] he's free indeed
[1:27:41] that means i can love those who don't
[1:27:43] love me
[1:27:44] hallelujah that means i can fellowship
[1:27:47] with those who don't agree with me
[1:27:49] hallelujah let me say it like this
[1:27:53] we were there
[1:27:55] just not long ago at a church
[1:27:57] whose doctrine is totally different from
[1:27:59] mine pretty much
[1:28:01] but you know what we concentrated on
[1:28:03] getting the people
[1:28:05] to the holy ghost
[1:28:07] hallelujah you see because if we can get
[1:28:10] them to the holy ghost the holy ghost
[1:28:13] will correct all era
[1:28:15] hallelujah is that right the bible says
[1:28:19] that the holy ghost will lead you and
[1:28:21] guide you into all truth
[1:28:29] but the truth of the matter is
[1:28:32] people don't want to work with people no
[1:28:34] more
[1:28:36] huh
[1:28:38] oh we want the baptist doctrine
[1:28:42] you receive it when you believe it
[1:28:44] that is not the truth
[1:28:50] paul said have you received the holy
[1:28:52] ghost
[1:28:53] since you believe
[1:28:56] hallelujah
[1:28:57] y'all hear me
[1:28:59] the holy ghost is not a thing
[1:29:01] the holy ghost is a person it is the
[1:29:04] person of jesus christ
[1:29:06] hallelujah and it's not enough to say i
[1:29:09] got it
[1:29:10] and your tree is showing something
[1:29:12] different
[1:29:13] because the bible says you'll know the
[1:29:15] tree by the fruit it pay hallelujah
[1:29:19] oh glory to god
[1:29:22] you love the lord
[1:29:24] i'm just going to let god have his way
[1:29:27] tonight
[1:29:29] hallelujah
[1:29:30] because we must understand
[1:29:32] we must have the mind of christ
[1:29:35] hallelujah
[1:29:37] jesus christ himself
[1:29:39] now let me tell you something
[1:29:41] until you die in rot
[1:29:45] hallelujah
[1:29:47] you say lord more of you and less of me
[1:29:50] none of me
[1:29:52] i don't want none of me
[1:29:55] until you get to that place you have not
[1:29:57] made
[1:29:58] 100.
[1:30:01] 99 and i have won't do
[1:30:07] this is what
[1:30:09] i feel that people have allowed satan to
[1:30:11] do
[1:30:13] just like he did israel
[1:30:15] hallelujah they got it at ease
[1:30:19] and they rose up to play
[1:30:23] and this is not a time to play
[1:30:26] this time is a serious time
[1:30:30] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:30:33] we're right at the end of this thing
[1:30:36] when your body and my body if you're
[1:30:38] made right will bring a translation
[1:30:42] hallelujah we'll step from this
[1:30:44] dimension into the other one he's old
[1:30:48] brother brooks
[1:30:50] you see
[1:30:52] what people don't understand is that
[1:30:54] when things are quiet
[1:30:57] when things are silent
[1:31:00] that's when things go on
[1:31:04] hallelujah
[1:31:05] have you ever had babysitted or kept any
[1:31:09] children
[1:31:11] and all of a sudden they got quiet
[1:31:16] you say you better go in there and check
[1:31:17] it
[1:31:20] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:31:22] silence and quiet doesn't mean it ain't
[1:31:24] nothing going on
[1:31:26] most of the time that's when the things
[1:31:29] are happening
[1:31:32] oh help me jesus
[1:31:35] i said all of that to say
[1:31:38] when those seals were broken
[1:31:40] and there was a half hour of silence
[1:31:44] everybody's still trying to see what
[1:31:46] that means
[1:31:48] what it meant
[1:31:51] and even though the man of god couldn't
[1:31:53] see it at that appointed time it doesn't
[1:31:55] mean he didn't see it later
[1:31:59] don't you know
[1:32:01] nothing could be added
[1:32:03] nor taken away
[1:32:05] so everything that was brought had to be
[1:32:08] found in the book
[1:32:12] has to be found in the book

[1:32:57] and when he woke up
[1:32:59] he saw her

[1:38:23] now understand
[1:38:25] when it comes to business
[1:38:28] you don't interrupt the king
[1:38:33] but she understood her position
[1:38:36] and most of all
[1:38:38] she knew how much he loved her
[1:38:41] see that's the thing
[1:38:43] we don't realize
[1:38:45] how much
[1:38:46] he loves you
[1:38:49] hallelujah
[1:38:50] but think about this for a moment the
[1:38:52] king of glory
[1:38:54] god himself
[1:38:57] wrapped himself up into a flesh
[1:39:00] became the son of god
[1:39:02] went to calvary for you
[1:39:06] y'all understand me they spat in his
[1:39:08] face
[1:39:10] they whipped him like they say all night
[1:39:12] long
[1:39:13] he blessed and died for you
[1:39:16] they pierced him
[1:39:18] they crowned him
[1:39:20] with thorns
[1:39:22] hallelujah y'all better help me
[1:39:25] because you realize
[1:39:27] those thorns represented you
[1:39:33] but he wore them for you
[1:39:35] so this old cockapoo
[1:39:38] could be saved hallelujah
[1:39:41] we didn't know it
[1:39:43] we came here as a cockapoo but on the
[1:39:45] inside was a wheat germ
[1:39:48] help me somebody
[1:39:50] he bled he died for you
[1:39:53] you've got to come to know how much he
[1:39:55] loves you
[1:39:57] hallelujah is that right
[1:39:59] he said listen
[1:40:01] if you believe in me
[1:40:04] he said you'll never die
[1:40:08] y'all believe that
[1:40:09] if you truly believe in me
[1:40:13] you'll never die
[1:40:15] i believe that
[1:40:17] i believe that
[1:40:20] she knew how much
[1:40:21] he loved her
[1:40:24] but when she walked up
[1:40:28] she caught his eyes
[1:40:31] can i say it like this
[1:40:33] she was looking in the face of god
[1:40:37] hello
[1:40:38] you say it wasn't no but in type he was
[1:40:41] you understand me he was king
[1:40:44] he understood
[1:40:47] in those days kings were
[1:40:49] but nevertheless she caught his eye
[1:40:51] that's what you got to do
[1:40:52] you got to catch his eyes
[1:40:55] have you ever caught his eyes
[1:40:57] hallelujah you know what i'm saying
[1:41:01] you know when you're in love
[1:41:03] how you catch each other's eyes
[1:41:05] and all of a sudden you're frozen for a
[1:41:07] moment
[1:41:10] let me move on by the grace of god
[1:41:12] but the truth of the matter is nobody
[1:41:16] can explain that moment to you
[1:41:20] in silence
[1:41:22] you communicated a love
[1:41:24] that was so spiritual
[1:41:27] that only you and your partner knew and
[1:41:30] felt what it was
[1:41:33] oh god help me jesus
[1:41:35] so what happens
[1:41:38] she re he reached when when she reached
[1:41:40] him
[1:41:41] he handed out the scepter
[1:41:44] do you all know what that means
[1:41:46] it was just a shadow and a type
[1:41:49] when jesus the lamb of god
[1:41:52] took the book
[1:41:54] and he reached out
[1:41:56] to john
[1:41:57] and said take the book oh see you're
[1:42:00] missing it
[1:42:02] what was it it was a shadowing type of
[1:42:04] what god was doing what was he doing you
[1:42:07] say that's not scripture yes it is
[1:42:10] because the king himself after giving
[1:42:13] esther the chapter he said i give you
[1:42:16] half of the kingdom
[1:42:19] and when you become joiners with christ
[1:42:25] hallelujah

[1:42:30] when you you understand me that was the
[1:42:32] king's authority
[1:42:36] but in heaven the word
[1:42:40] is the king's authority oh come on
[1:42:42] somebody when god give the man of god
[1:42:45] the sword hallelujah
[1:42:48] it was his authority
[1:42:56] you got to recognize
[1:42:58] that we're not called
[1:43:00] to be just little christians
[1:43:06] barely making it
[1:43:09] oh lord restore my joy
[1:43:12] you're still living in that time
[1:43:15] where god has to restore your joy
[1:43:18] you should have never gave it up
[1:43:23] the devil didn't take it
[1:43:25] you gave it up
[1:43:29] take back what the devil stole he ain't
[1:43:31] stole nothing
[1:43:33] you gave it to him
[1:43:36] is that the bible

[2:07:49] it's later than you think
[2:07:51] i don't know if we have visitors here
[2:07:53] but
[2:07:54] i hope i didn't run you away if you
[2:07:56] and i trust that something was said that
[2:07:58] strikes you
[2:08:00] see let me tell you something because i
[2:08:02] came up
[2:08:03] my mother raised me as a baptist
[2:08:06] from the baptist
[2:08:07] i went from the baptist to the methodist
[2:08:10] from the methodist to the catholic now
[2:08:11] that's bad isn't it
[2:08:15] i was going backwards for sure
[2:08:17] from the catholic to the apostolics
[2:08:20] and when i got there whoo my god
[2:08:23] i remember
[2:08:24] when the holy ghost got a hold on me
[2:08:26] don't tell me it wasn't it was the holy
[2:08:27] ghost when the holy ghost got a hold on
[2:08:30] me oh
[2:08:31] oh my god i think i was walking that
[2:08:34] much
[2:08:35] that far off the ground
[2:08:38] hallelujah
[2:08:40] but the system got a hold of me
[2:08:43] because they told me if i hadn't spoken
[2:08:44] tongues
[2:08:45] i didn't have it
[2:08:47] i said what
[2:08:51] you mean to tell me i can feel this good
[2:08:54] you don't mean to tell me my life has
[2:08:56] changed like this and i don't have it
[2:08:57] yet no you ain't got it
[2:09:02] i had it but the system got to me
[2:09:06] somebody help me
[2:09:08] i'm not saying you don't speak in
[2:09:10] tongues because i did
[2:09:13] and it brought some more joy
[2:09:16] y'all better hear me
[2:09:18] but that was just the beginning
[2:09:24] that was just the beginning
[2:09:27] higher heights deeper depths
[2:09:30] is that right
[2:09:31] the scripture tells us amen how wide it
[2:09:34] is how deep it is and so he said it's a
[2:09:36] it surpasses our knowledge so how we
[2:09:39] gonna get it
[2:09:40] how we gonna get it
[2:09:42] it must come by revelation
[2:09:45] upon this rock
[2:09:46] i'll build my church
[2:09:48] and the gates of hell should not prevail
[2:09:50] against it
[2:09:51] is there anyone
[2:09:54] who want to go farther with the lord
[2:09:57] say brother brooks i haven't been doing
[2:10:00] just right
[2:10:02] i believe the message i really believe
[2:10:04] what you're saying
[2:10:05] but i haven't been living the standard
[2:10:08] it ain't my standard
[2:10:10] it's the word standard
[2:10:12] and one thing i know about this like i
[2:10:14] was telling him
[2:10:17] when the book was open
[2:10:20] john said i looked
[2:10:22] i looked to see a lion
[2:10:25] but when i
[2:10:26] turned i saw a lamb
[2:10:30] now watch this
[2:10:32] because a wedding
[2:10:33] ceremony was getting ready to take place
[2:10:36] it wasn't a lion
[2:10:38] it was a lamb that was getting married
[2:10:46] and lambs only mate with lambs
[2:10:50] they don't mate with lions
[2:10:54] they don't mate with goats
[2:10:57] somebody help me
[2:10:59] so i'm gonna tell you the key what i'm
[2:11:01] trying to tell you
[2:11:03] when it changed
[2:11:08] from no four living creatures
[2:11:13] into the lamb
[2:11:16] god was saying
[2:11:18] the only way you will make it
[2:11:21] you must become a lamb
[2:11:24] hello somebody
[2:11:26] the nature of the lamb must be there
[2:11:30] it ain't your religion it's your nature
[2:11:32] change
[2:11:34] somebody help me
[2:11:36] you understand me the prophet god said
[2:11:40] jesus christ
[2:11:43] defeated the devil at calvary
[2:11:46] with sweetness
[2:11:49] and meekness
[2:11:54] go look it
[2:11:56] go find it
[2:11:57] sweetness
[2:11:59] and meekness
[2:12:03] you understand me
[2:12:04] there's got to be a nature change
[2:12:07] let's stand by the grace of god
[2:12:09] didn't mean to go so long
[2:12:13] but i want to say this by the grace of
[2:12:14] god
[2:12:18] i just let him use me i just let him
[2:12:20] talk speak
[2:12:24] my notes perhaps would have directed me
[2:12:25] in a different way
[2:12:28] but i feel like it's
[2:12:30] it's a need
[2:12:32] because what good is all of this
[2:12:36] all of this
[2:12:38] all of this i love you lord
[2:12:41] i love you lord
[2:12:42] everybody say they love him lord
[2:12:45] i love you lord
[2:12:46] but it's more than words
[2:12:51] hallelujah
[2:12:53] in order to love the lord the way you
[2:12:55] should love him there's got to be a
[2:12:56] nature change
[2:12:59] his nature must come into you and that
[2:13:01] nature is the holy ghost
[2:13:03] and like i was saying earlier before the
[2:13:06] enemy took that thought from me
[2:13:08] people don't want to pray with folks no
[2:13:10] more
[2:13:11] but i went up there
[2:13:14] in
[2:13:14] michigan it was a brother
[2:13:17] and i knew that they'd differ
