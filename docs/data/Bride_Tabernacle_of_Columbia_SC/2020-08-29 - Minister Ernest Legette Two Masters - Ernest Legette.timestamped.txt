[27:03] thank you in the name of jesus christ we
[27:06] pray
[27:07] amen
[27:12] amen we want to look at the book of
[27:14] romans by god's grace
[27:18] god is good amen
[27:26] romans 6 and
[27:30] we'll begin at the 11th verse
[27:44] if you got it say amen
[27:47] i ain't got it myself
[27:51] romans 6 and 11 and it reads
[27:55] likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be
[27:59] dead indeed to sin
[28:01] but alive unto god through jesus christ
[28:04] our lord
[28:05] let not sin therefore reign in your
[28:06] mortal body
[28:08] that ye shall obey it in the lust
[28:10] thereof
[28:11] neither heal yours your neither yield
[28:13] your ye
[28:15] your members as instruments of
[28:17] unrighteousness unto sin
[28:19] but yield ye yourselves unto god as
[28:22] though
[28:23] that as as those that are alive from the
[28:26] dead
[28:27] and your members as instruments of
[28:30] righteousness
[28:31] unto god for sin shall not have dominion
[28:34] over you
[28:34] for ye are not under the law but under
[28:37] grace
[28:38] what shall what then shall we send
[28:42] because we are not under the law but
[28:44] under grace
[28:45] god forbid know ye not that to whom you
[28:48] yield your
[28:49] self your self servants to obey
[28:53] his servants ye are to him you obey
[28:57] whether of sin unto death or of
[29:00] obedience unto righteousness
[29:02] but god be think that we were that ye
[29:05] were
[29:06] the servants of sin but ye have obeyed
[29:09] from the heart
[29:10] that form of doctrine which was
[29:12] delivered you
[29:13] being then made free from sin you become
[29:16] the servants of righteousness
[29:18] i speak after the manner of men because
[29:20] of the infirmity of your flesh
[29:22] for as ye have yielded your members
[29:24] servants to uncleanness
[29:26] and to iniquity unto iniquity
[29:29] even so now yield your members
[29:33] servants to righteousness unto holiness
[29:36] for when ye were the servants of sin you
[29:39] were
[29:40] you were free from righteousness what
[29:42] fruit
[29:43] had ye then in those things whereof ye
[29:46] are now shamed
[29:47] for the end of those things is death but
[29:50] now being made free from sin and become
[29:52] servants to god you have your fruit unto
[29:55] holiness
[29:56] in the end everlasting life for the
[29:59] wages of sin
[30:00] is death but the gift of god is eternal
[30:04] life
[30:04] through jesus christ our lord may god
[30:08] bless to the reading of his word
[30:10] tonight by god's grace uh for a moment
[30:13] i just want to talk to you and i i
[30:16] entitled it i'm still working with
[30:18] with our two masters but the sub topic
[30:21] will be the
[30:22] servant to sin amen so we still
[30:25] kind of talking about two masters but
[30:27] you know sub-topic like we said is to be
[30:29] servants
[30:30] uh to sin you know and like
[30:33] you know just reading here in the
[30:34] scriptures is just listen to what
[30:37] paul is saying about how you yield
[30:40] yourselves
[30:41] he was saying you know giving it out as
[30:44] as though
[30:45] you have a choice and that's what he
[30:47] says to whom you yield yourselves
[30:50] that's who you're going to become the
[30:51] servants of so
[30:53] as we know that jesus says that no man
[30:55] can serve two masters
[30:57] so you can't you can't yield yourself to
[31:00] god and the devil at the same time
[31:02] so he says to whom you yield yourself to
[31:05] or what you decide to yield yourself to
[31:08] you're going to become a servant of it
[31:10] and a lot of times we thinking that or
[31:14] you know sometimes we can feel as though
[31:16] i'm in control i know what i'm doing
[31:18] i got control of my life but that's not
[31:21] that's not the case you end up you you
[31:24] either you're going to be
[31:25] like paul says i'm a prisoner of the
[31:28] christ
[31:29] or you're going to be a prisoner to the
[31:30] devil one or the other
[31:32] it's not that you're in control it's
[31:34] only it's only two powers
[31:36] in this earth and we know that they're
[31:38] battling for control and those two
[31:40] powers that's battling for control is
[31:42] either god or satan
[31:43] and it's up to you and i like like we
[31:46] know he makes us a free moral agent
[31:48] it's up to you and i to choose whose
[31:49] side you're going to be on
[31:51] you know that's the thing it says that
[31:53] you know you got to choose
[31:55] he makes us a free moral agent you know
[31:57] you can serve me
[31:59] or you know if you don't serve me you
[32:01] get no in between there's
[32:02] no purgatory so we find that so tonight
[32:05] we want to like we say is we want to say
[32:08] uh a servants to sin
[32:11] you know i i was thinking about hero
[32:12] says you know one thing about adam and
[32:15] eve
[32:15] they didn't they didn't know um they
[32:18] didn't have no knowledge
[32:20] of what sin was or no knowledge of what
[32:22] it was
[32:23] to be a servant to sin or anything like
[32:25] that because they were they were serving
[32:28] you know god the living god and they
[32:30] were enjoying themselves
[32:31] i believe in the garden of eden but they
[32:34] didn't realize that you know here come
[32:37] uh satan and and the serpent comes
[32:40] you know and begin to begin to talking
[32:42] with them the first thing he
[32:44] did he attacked uh do we know he
[32:46] attacked the word of god
[32:48] begin to attack and say i know god said
[32:50] this but
[32:51] you know bringing it that before them
[32:53] but i said the thing is you can't have
[32:55] two masters
[32:56] you can't serve you can't serve god and
[32:59] you can't have two masters
[33:01] what they what what the devil done in
[33:03] that time i believe he became a voice
[33:06] to them so not only did they have the
[33:08] voice of god now you know the voice of
[33:11] satan
[33:12] was in the air and that's what it is you
[33:14] know uh
[33:15] we got to try the spirit by the spirit
[33:17] there's so many voices that are in the
[33:19] air today
[33:20] so many so many voices and a lot of
[33:22] times those voices might sound true
[33:24] but it takes the holy ghost it takes the
[33:27] spirit of god
[33:28] to be able to recognize the true voice
[33:30] of god and where that voice is coming
[33:33] from that's why
[33:34] you know it is so the devil himself
[33:38] he's so crafty i believe it says that
[33:40] he's wiser than daniel
[33:41] and if it were possible you know the
[33:43] bible says that he
[33:45] in the end he would deceive the very
[33:47] elect if it was possible
[33:49] because that's how close the spirits
[33:51] would be and you know when you even sit
[33:53] back
[33:54] and and meditate on that it makes you
[33:57] just want to draw and get that much
[33:59] closer to god
[34:00] because you want to be able to recognize
[34:02] that hey
[34:03] this is this isn't god or hey this is
[34:06] the voice of god
[34:07] because you can be uh wound up and uh i
[34:09] say
[34:10] and caught in in deception and that's
[34:12] why i believe in the scriptures
[34:14] how it says men ought to pray always
[34:17] come on
[34:17] you ought to always pray always have
[34:20] that communion
[34:21] and fellowship with god if you don't do
[34:22] nothing else you ought to always
[34:24] have some type of fellowship and
[34:26] communion with god that way you'll be
[34:28] able to
[34:28] distinguish his voice from any other
[34:31] voice how many believe that tonight but
[34:34] we find that like i said they didn't
[34:36] know they they didn't know
[34:38] uh uh they didn't know what sin was
[34:41] they didn't have you know no idea what
[34:44] bondage wasn't like or what real bondage
[34:46] was but they was about to find out
[34:48] i believe that they didn't know that by
[34:51] their actions
[34:52] uh just we know that the bible says that
[34:55] he was deceived and adam wasn't
[34:57] but just to know that the actions that
[35:00] we
[35:01] we get ready to take these things are
[35:03] going to separate us from the tree of
[35:05] life
[35:06] they're going to separate us from god
[35:08] and many times
[35:09] even we we come to crossroads i believe
[35:12] in our lives we come to decisions in our
[35:15] lives
[35:15] and sometimes we let we listen to the
[35:18] flesh and let the flesh overcome us
[35:20] but not knowing that that decision that
[35:23] you make that action that you take
[35:25] might be what separates you from that
[35:26] presence separate you you know
[35:29] god has had so much grace on us because
[35:32] the bible says even when you were dead
[35:35] in trespassing sin that he says that
[35:38] that christ
[35:39] he still died for the ungodly he still
[35:41] loved us he still made a way
[35:43] to reconcile you back to him because he
[35:46] didn't want you to be separated from him
[35:48] he wanted you to be in that presence so
[35:51] if he's done that for you and i
[35:53] i say why not take advantage of what the
[35:55] grace of god has done for you and i
[35:57] you know sometimes we know that people
[36:00] can get caught up in
[36:02] situations and they don't get second
[36:04] chances from it
[36:05] some people are are dead in their grave
[36:08] and they didn't get a second chance from
[36:09] the decision they made
[36:10] some people are locked up in jail due in
[36:13] life some people
[36:14] are are caught up had got all kind of
[36:16] lives
[36:17] messed up because they didn't get a
[36:19] second chance from the decision that
[36:20] they made
[36:21] but i want to say when god when you the
[36:24] day you hear his voice the bible say
[36:26] heart not your heart come on because
[36:27] when you hear in his voice
[36:29] god has given you a second chance some
[36:31] of us god has given a third and fourth
[36:33] and fifth chance
[36:34] and yet we keep playing with that grace
[36:36] but i want to say we don't want to play
[36:38] with that grace
[36:39] but we want to seize that that
[36:40] opportunity come on how many want to do
[36:42] that tonight
[36:43] but we find that like we said i said
[36:46] they didn't understand the actions
[36:48] that they were that they that they made
[36:51] the action they made
[36:52] was gonna um was going to separate them
[36:55] from the presence of god and a lot of
[36:58] times we don't understand that
[37:00] we we ain't going to know how much you
[37:02] you're going to need or miss that
[37:04] presence until it ain't there
[37:06] how much you know uh um i i like how
[37:09] i was listening to something the other
[37:11] day and it reminded me of a song
[37:13] it says after all that i've been through
[37:15] i still got joy come on
[37:17] and you know what gives you that joy the
[37:19] presence of god
[37:21] you know what gives you that joy of the
[37:22] spirit of god that after all you've been
[37:25] through you still got joy
[37:27] because there's something on the inside
[37:28] of you that's still reminding you of a
[37:30] hope
[37:31] that god ain't dead and he's still alive
[37:33] i don't care what the situation
[37:35] looks like i'm reminded of of jesus at
[37:38] the tomb of lazarus
[37:39] been dead four days but even in there he
[37:42] said roll away the stone come on
[37:44] because over though even though he'd
[37:45] been dead four days there was still a
[37:47] hope
[37:47] that he was gonna rise even martha said
[37:51] he said i know that in the last days you
[37:53] know
[37:54] you'll raise them up and jesus began to
[37:56] talk to her about i am the resurrection
[37:58] in life but
[37:59] even her statement was even now lord
[38:01] because
[38:02] you know long as god was still there it
[38:04] was still a hope
[38:05] and that's what it is so we're finding
[38:08] that uh uh even
[38:09] like it says today you won't miss that
[38:12] presence until that presence is gone
[38:14] you won't miss it until all the hope is
[38:16] gone until you you
[38:18] crossed over to a place the way you
[38:20] don't you don't know for sure whether
[38:21] god gonna deliver you or not
[38:23] you don't know of god because you knew
[38:25] better but you didn't you didn't do
[38:26] right you
[38:27] you willfully went out there and did it
[38:29] anyway but i said the thing about it is
[38:31] why be on that side why not
[38:33] be enjoying you know god's got blessings
[38:36] he wants you to enjoy those blessings
[38:38] god wants to to put you up in a place
[38:41] the way he can show you off come on
[38:43] i believe that god's got people he
[38:45] wanted to show off that
[38:46] hey even though they was oppressed even
[38:48] though there was
[38:49] a uh a burden on every side even though
[38:53] the whole world
[38:54] was against me they still stood they
[38:56] made it through the tests of the storms
[38:58] and the rain
[38:58] why because they had faith in me they
[39:01] kept their confidence in me and i
[39:03] delivered just as i promised i would
[39:05] come on god got somebody he want to show
[39:07] off even in the midst of
[39:08] what we're going through right now faced
[39:10] with the um
[39:12] the world as i was i was uh on my knees
[39:15] thinking about i said you know the world
[39:17] right now is shaking up
[39:19] not only is we dealing you know with the
[39:21] with the uh
[39:22] civil things that's going on in the
[39:24] world today with race
[39:25] you're dealing with corona you're
[39:27] dealing with a hurricane that is tearing
[39:29] up
[39:30] in the country and sometimes they don't
[39:31] even consider that more than the other
[39:33] politics and things
[39:34] that they got going on in the world
[39:36] today you see what it is a lot of times
[39:39] we think and we put our trust in men and
[39:41] put our trust and money and put our
[39:43] trust in all these things
[39:44] that don't care nothing about you but
[39:46] it's something about jesus jesus cares
[39:48] he even cares about the shoes you got on
[39:50] your feet he cares about the next meal
[39:52] he cares about
[39:53] everything about you your every wick
[39:55] your every well-being
[39:56] why not serve the living god come on why
[39:59] not put your confidence
[40:00] and your trust in him he'll never leave
[40:03] you
[40:03] nor forsake you but he'll be with you he
[40:06] said even in you until the end of the
[40:07] world
[40:08] i like how he says in the scriptures
[40:10] though your mother and father forsake
[40:12] your god will take you up
[40:13] that's the kind of god that we serve
[40:15] that when everybody else give up on your
[40:17] god ain't gonna never give up on you
[40:19] hallelujah when people don't recognize
[40:21] your god they'll still recognize you
[40:24] how many believe that but we find that
[40:27] like it says here you know they they
[40:30] didn't know recognize
[40:31] you know uh they didn't even know what
[40:33] real bondage was like come on we're
[40:35] talking about two masters they didn't
[40:37] know what
[40:37] and the servant to send they didn't know
[40:39] what real bondage was like
[40:41] they they didn't know what all these
[40:42] things were like but they was about to
[40:44] find
[40:44] find out and what it is the actions
[40:48] that they took there in the garden of
[40:50] eden they throw the whole
[40:51] you not only the human race but the
[40:53] whole world out of cater it throwed
[40:55] everything out now
[40:56] you know uh we was the world was about
[40:59] to experience and know
[41:00] what sin was like what what killing and
[41:03] what death and
[41:04] all these things was life but one thing
[41:06] about god
[41:07] garden still in all of that he made a
[41:10] way of escape
[41:11] and all of that he had a plan to
[41:14] reconcile
[41:15] us back you know in god's mind even
[41:18] though he know these things was gonna
[41:19] happen
[41:20] he had a plan to get you and i back to
[41:22] him
[41:23] he had a plan that that i'm gonna i'm
[41:25] gonna bring them
[41:26] i'm gonna bring them back into
[41:28] fellowship with me because i don't want
[41:30] them
[41:30] to be separated me from that way but i
[41:32] got a plan i got a way i'm gonna make
[41:34] them
[41:35] to be able to bring them back but the
[41:37] thing is he ain't gonna force you to
[41:39] take that way back
[41:40] that way that he made uh uh uh for you
[41:43] to come back
[41:44] it's about it it's by choice now we know
[41:46] that you know things are
[41:48] predestinated they say this is your lot
[41:50] this is your destiny but still yet
[41:52] god placed in you in man a choice
[41:55] that hey i made a way of escape for you
[41:57] you don't have to
[41:59] stay in that condition you win you don't
[42:01] have to and and it doesn't matter
[42:03] what what uh uh uh things that you were
[42:06] born with in your family that might have
[42:07] flicked you from the womb
[42:09] that might afflict you from your life
[42:11] you might have things that was passed
[42:12] down
[42:13] from generation to generation but god
[42:15] had a way
[42:16] had a way of escape to get you out of
[42:18] those generational curses
[42:20] he had a way that i'm gonna break that
[42:22] even though your father your grandfather
[42:25] this one might have seen
[42:26] if you come my provided way i'ma break
[42:28] that curse off you
[42:30] and i'mma get you back how is that
[42:32] through the baptism of the holy ghost he
[42:33] said if you repent
[42:35] and be baptized every one of you in the
[42:37] name of jesus christ
[42:38] for the remission of your sins you shall
[42:40] receive the gift of the holy ghost come
[42:42] on
[42:42] we ain't got to beg for it all we got to
[42:45] do is obey god and god is going to do
[42:47] what he said
[42:48] he said and the promise is unto you i
[42:50] know your children curse but the promise
[42:52] is to your children too
[42:53] i know your children's children are
[42:55] cursed but the promise is to them as
[42:57] well
[42:57] god has made a way of escape to bring us
[43:00] back hallelujah
[43:01] to the tree of life bring us back to
[43:03] fellowship with him how many believe
[43:05] that tonight
[43:06] i don't know about you but i said you
[43:08] know as they sing the song god is
[43:11] god what he says god has done delivered
[43:13] me why should i be bound come on
[43:16] i don't know how the song exactly i said
[43:17] but it's something like that he said the
[43:18] lord has delivered me
[43:20] why should i be bound when you think
[43:22] about what the lord has done for you
[43:24] why are you bound to the sin why are you
[43:26] bound to generation of curses why are
[43:27] you bound to heal and come on god does
[43:29] not deliver you
[43:31] why should you be bound hallelujah i say
[43:33] get up and praise god
[43:34] i say shout your way out i say give god
[43:37] to glory for all that he's done for you
[43:39] he don't deliver you
[43:41] you don't have to be bound how many
[43:43] believe that
[43:45] glory to god you know i telling my wife
[43:48] i said i became a different person
[43:50] sometimes looking in the scriptures
[43:52] that's what it takes
[43:54] you you got to indulge in the word come
[43:56] on somebody
[43:57] some people they don't like to look in
[43:59] the word come on you got to get in the
[44:01] word
[44:01] and meditate in it come on and let it do
[44:04] something
[44:04] in your life because what next thing you
[44:06] know you start just
[44:08] quoting it you start just and something
[44:10] you just start believing it come on and
[44:12] when you start believing as
[44:13] things start to happen you start walking
[44:15] different you start talking different
[44:17] your bodies start feeling different why
[44:19] because it's power in that word it's
[44:22] life you don't you know
[44:23] in the word of god you know it says that
[44:25] that that uh
[44:27] god said let there be light come on let
[44:30] there be he spoke
[44:31] and it was so much power in that word
[44:33] that things begin to move
[44:35] because of what the word of god spoke
[44:37] and if it had that power then it's got
[44:39] that same power now
[44:41] only thing you got to do is speak that
[44:43] word let that hear that word
[44:44] you know faith coming by hearing and
[44:46] hearing the word of god it ain't just
[44:48] sermons it ain't just letters it ain't
[44:50] just a book or a story that we're
[44:52] reading but it's
[44:53] life taking place it's something moving
[44:55] when you hear that word
[44:56] it's something moving when you speak
[44:58] that word you might can't see it but
[45:00] it's moving why because it's the power
[45:02] of god
[45:03] making it move how many believe that
[45:05] hallelujah
[45:07] but we find that it says god is you know
[45:10] uh he's he's so good to us
[45:14] and he made a way even that out of all
[45:16] of that
[45:17] that we can be reconciled you know come
[45:19] on we find
[45:20] ourselves born into a dark world come on
[45:24] born into chaos born into a mess
[45:27] born in the sin but yet when we look up
[45:30] we see the light
[45:32] all we got to do is make it to that
[45:33] light all we got to do is run like let's
[45:36] say i'm running for my life
[45:37] run to that light i don't know about you
[45:39] but when god
[45:40] began dealing with my heart it wasn't it
[45:43] wasn't an easing in
[45:44] it was running in it was a place it was
[45:46] a point in my life that i realized
[45:48] hey i got to run for my life i got to
[45:51] get away from the things
[45:52] god has set me free if i don't run and
[45:55] make it to that safe place
[45:56] if i don't make it to that place of
[45:58] refuge then i'm gonna get bound again
[46:00] come on then i'm gonna get destroyed the
[46:01] destroyer is out there you got to run
[46:03] for your life
[46:04] you got to make it to that safe place
[46:07] hallelujah
[46:09] but we find that like it says you know
[46:12] uh uh
[46:14] they were separated but god you know
[46:16] made a way
[46:17] for them to get back but like we were
[46:19] saying on on the other week we was
[46:21] talking about
[46:22] the the two masters saying you know the
[46:25] biggest problem is is that people they
[46:27] want to serve god
[46:29] they want to live just enough to like we
[46:31] said to get the blessings of god because
[46:32] they know they're going to need his
[46:33] blessings and his power
[46:34] but yet they still want to indulge in
[46:36] the in the things of the world
[46:38] but you can't serve two masters he said
[46:41] you're gonna either you're gonna either
[46:42] love one
[46:43] or hate the other but these what it is
[46:45] these masters
[46:47] you know what are they doing they they
[46:48] battling for control
[46:50] you know you know the greatest battle we
[46:52] know
[46:53] that ever fought is in your mind says
[46:55] why is it in your mind because that's
[46:57] where the decisions are made come on
[46:59] and the thing is what are they doing you
[47:02] know some say
[47:02] call it the battle of the wheels they're
[47:04] battling they're battling for control
[47:06] that same battle
[47:07] that raised in heaven you know michael
[47:10] and his
[47:10] angels fought against the dragon and his
[47:12] angels but you know what happened the
[47:14] dragon was cast out
[47:16] but that same battle that raised in
[47:18] heaven it now fell to earth and became
[47:20] battle of men
[47:21] where is the war where's the
[47:22] battleground we say the battleground is
[47:25] in your mind
[47:26] come on you got a decision to make the
[47:28] night oh you're going to serve the
[47:29] living god
[47:30] oh you're going to are you going to
[47:32] become a servant
[47:33] to sin as we were saying here in the
[47:35] scriptures and we'll
[47:36] hopefully we'll get into that you'll be
[47:38] a servant to sin
[47:39] and once you become you know a servant
[47:42] of sin
[47:42] all these things whatever they do they
[47:45] bring about death come on
[47:46] not only do they bring about natural
[47:48] death but in the end it brings about a
[47:50] spiritual death an
[47:52] eternal we look at a separation from god
[47:55] the bible says the wages of sin is death
[47:58] come on you paying to die
[48:00] you're paying for it come on the wages
[48:02] of sin is death
[48:03] but the gift of god god is freely giving
[48:06] it to you
[48:07] god is freely giving you a gift come on
[48:10] of eternal life do you want that gift
[48:12] you know i've been i've been uh uh
[48:15] finding myself
[48:16] just trying to encourage i says you know
[48:19] do you want that gift come on it didn't
[48:21] cost it didn't cost me nothing
[48:23] to give my life to the lord the only
[48:25] thing i did i just came freely lord
[48:27] here i am i want to accept what you've
[48:29] done for me
[48:30] and you serve god because you serve god
[48:34] you give god your all because you love
[48:36] him
[48:36] because you're thankful for what he's
[48:38] done for you you re
[48:39] you now got a revelation of the plan of
[48:42] salvation he opened your eyes
[48:44] to where you could have been matter of
[48:46] fact the way you should have been that's
[48:47] what god
[48:48] opened your eyes to and then you're more
[48:50] you love them and the more you say god
[48:53] come on i don't want you to ever let
[48:54] your hands off of me
[48:56] god i thank god that we can't that we're
[48:58] not
[48:59] asked to keep ourselves the bible says
[49:01] we are kept by the power of god
[49:03] you ain't asked to keep yourself god is
[49:05] keeping you
[49:06] god is the one holding on to you how
[49:08] many believe that tonight
[49:10] god is so good but i find out
[49:13] that what it is it's a battle even in a
[49:16] lot of lives today
[49:17] it took me back to you know a testimony
[49:20] of
[49:20] how me and brother carl were down in in
[49:22] orangeburg and
[49:23] and just to make a story short there was
[49:25] a man you know he was at the crack house
[49:27] and
[49:27] had a full suit on come on he had a full
[49:30] suit on at the crack house
[49:31] and the man tears started coming down at
[49:34] his eyes
[49:35] and he said he told me brother carly
[49:37] says
[49:38] you know he says i got dressed to go to
[49:40] church this morning
[49:41] he says but i never made it come on i
[49:44] could see that
[49:45] inside of this it did something to us
[49:47] that we begin to pray in for this man
[49:49] right there
[49:49] in front of the crack house with all our
[49:51] hearts because what it is it's a battle
[49:53] going on
[49:54] the man i believe is something inside of
[49:56] that man he wanted to serve god he made
[49:58] the effort
[49:59] to go but what it is the crack demon had
[50:02] him bound come on
[50:03] the master or the crack demon had him
[50:05] even though he wanted to serve god
[50:07] the other the master had him and i said
[50:10] the thing about
[50:11] it is i know someone that can set you
[50:13] free from that master
[50:14] i know someone that can set you free
[50:17] from that but sometimes
[50:18] you know and we don't understand uh uh
[50:21] just like we said the decisions that we
[50:23] made i heard it
[50:25] told to me many times don't ever try
[50:28] you know crack cocaine and say that's a
[50:30] one-time addiction it'll do something
[50:33] to you and from that time point you'll
[50:35] be chasing
[50:36] after that high or something and it says
[50:38] a lot of times
[50:39] people that do certain drugs they never
[50:42] fully get deliverance from it
[50:43] but it can be 20 or 30 years they'll
[50:46] find themselves go back to it
[50:48] now i said that might be true but if
[50:50] they ever get hold to the holy ghost
[50:52] or the holy ghost ever comes inside of
[50:54] them then that master can't have no more
[50:56] control over them or dominion
[50:58] i don't care how he raises his ugly head
[51:01] because the real master is here now
[51:03] the same one that throw them out of
[51:05] heaven is now dwelling on the inside of
[51:06] them
[51:07] they can still have deliverance
[51:09] hallelujah
[51:10] i won't tell them there ain't no hope
[51:12] there is hope
[51:14] i don't mean to yell but there is hope
[51:16] come on
[51:17] i can't say that there ain't no hope
[51:19] don't be scared come on be glad come on
[51:22] run to god with all
[51:23] your heart give god your life then you
[51:26] can dance all over the devil ahead
[51:27] then you can go out and testify then you
[51:30] can be a true witness
[51:31] of the power of god hallelujah
[51:35] oh he's the real master come on but we
[51:38] find that like we said it's a struggle
[51:40] sometimes it's a battle that people you
[51:43] know
[51:43] say they want to serve god but the devil
[51:46] you know uh
[51:47] got them bound and how it says here it
[51:50] says
[51:51] he said he was that's why he was a
[51:54] begging or pleading
[51:55] i believe with the people he was saying
[51:57] you know
[51:58] not to yield your members as instruments
[52:01] and unrighteousness
[52:02] to sin but he was saying you know yield
[52:05] yourself to god
[52:06] don't yield yourself to sin because he
[52:08] talked about when you
[52:09] yielded yourself he says you know you're
[52:12] in bondage to those things
[52:13] your drugs might have not been your
[52:15] bondage but it was something
[52:17] you know that had you in bondage had you
[52:19] in in captivity you might have said it
[52:21] didn't but you couldn't
[52:22] you couldn't get free from it you
[52:24] couldn't uh uh be delivered from it
[52:27] but he says is it come a time when he
[52:30] keeps saying thanks be to god because it
[52:33] come a time
[52:34] when god came in come on and the battle
[52:36] was over the struggle was over
[52:38] i like how in the scriptures he says
[52:40] that i come to
[52:41] uh set the captive free come on i've
[52:44] come to preach deliverance
[52:45] to the captive to set free them that
[52:47] abound
[52:48] because jesus knew that you know the
[52:51] people were bound
[52:52] he knew that they were in bondage so he
[52:54] says i come to i come to set him free
[52:56] come on
[52:57] but when he's when he sets you free um
[53:00] that's what uh
[53:01] paul was saying just as you yield
[53:03] yourselves
[53:04] and you were servants to sin come on
[53:07] when
[53:07] you yield when god sets you free yield
[53:10] yourself to god that way come on
[53:12] be like paul many times he talks about
[53:16] in his testimony
[53:17] uh how he says that uh i murdered the
[53:20] church of god
[53:21] i i was a pharisee of the pharisee i did
[53:24] this he talked about all the things
[53:26] that he did and how yeah he was he was
[53:28] just so disruptive in
[53:30] in the sin that he was in but then he
[53:32] began to talk about
[53:34] how christ set him free come on and how
[53:37] he says now as i was a servant to those
[53:40] things
[53:40] now i serve the living god he even
[53:44] called himself sometimes i'm a prisoner
[53:46] for the lord come on
[53:48] i'm serving the lord and that's i'm
[53:50] serving the lord i'm a prisoner for him
[53:52] i'm giving him
[53:53] all just as i gave it my all when i was
[53:55] on the other side
[53:56] i'm going to give it my all to them
[53:58] that's what it is
[53:59] yielding yourself to god don't hold
[54:01] nothing back here i am lord use me god
[54:04] use use my hands use my feet god use
[54:08] if you want whatever you want to get out
[54:09] of me lord i like how it says consume me
[54:12] lord with the fire of your spirit god
[54:14] used me
[54:14] when i was used by the devil i let him
[54:16] have his way and god i want to let you
[54:18] have your way now that i'm free as i
[54:21] yielded myself to that god i want to
[54:22] yield
[54:23] myself to you completely because you
[54:25] find out that if you don't sell out to
[54:27] god
[54:28] that other master will come back come on
[54:30] he'll find a way
[54:32] to start speaking to your mind again
[54:35] he'll find a way to start speaking and
[54:37] remember
[54:38] you can't serve both of them now you're
[54:40] gonna love one and hate the other
[54:42] it'll bring you it'll bring you
[54:44] sometimes back into bondage
[54:46] i said you got to silence that voice
[54:48] tonight how do you silence that voice do
[54:50] the word of god come on
[54:52] you know the prophet of god talked about
[54:53] eve greatest mistake was when she
[54:55] stopped to listen
[54:56] you shouldn't stop and listen when those
[54:58] things come into your mind
[55:00] come on begin praising god tell the
[55:02] devil get behind me
[55:03] i'm going on to serve the living god you
[55:05] i was telling my wife
[55:06] last night and certain things we don't
[55:08] have to do you don't have to argue with
[55:10] with people or argue
[55:12] with certain things or spirits and all
[55:13] those things just go on come on
[55:15] and serve the lord because when you stop
[55:17] to argue when you stop the debate
[55:19] what it does it messes your spirit all
[55:21] up it gets all of your spirits
[55:23] get you all entangled with things and
[55:25] then what happens
[55:26] you find yourself separated from the
[55:28] presence of god the anointing
[55:30] leaves your life and all those things i
[55:32] said come on let's not do those things
[55:34] let's get to the place where our mind is
[55:36] solely on christ and christ himself
[55:38] come on that's the only way we're going
[55:40] to stay with god we got to stay with
[55:42] love
[55:42] lord no matter what god i'm going to
[55:44] serve you no matter what god i'ma go on
[55:46] with you
[55:46] because nothing else matters anyway lord
[55:49] but giving you all
[55:50] nothing else matters lord but pleasing
[55:52] you right now
[55:53] come on let my body be burned let me be
[55:55] thrown in jail let me be talked about
[55:57] long as i can be pleasing to god
[56:00] hallelujah that's what it's about
[56:03] pleasing the lord how many believe that
[56:07] but we find that like he says servants
[56:10] paul used that terminology he said you
[56:13] were servants to sin come on
[56:15] you were servants you were in bondage he
[56:18] says but now
[56:19] look what god has done now that that
[56:21] crisis
[56:22] has set you free he says don't you he
[56:25] says
[56:25] yield your members to god come on yield
[56:28] yourself to god
[56:30] i want to say whatever gift god has
[56:32] given you yield it to god
[56:33] give it back to god be glad to be
[56:36] whatever it is god
[56:38] ordained out of your life give it back
[56:40] to god come on
[56:41] that's when your blessings that that's
[56:43] where you're gonna see the spirit of god
[56:44] flowing your life that's when you're
[56:46] gonna be blessed and and god is gonna
[56:48] bless you
[56:48] when you learn how to give it back to
[56:50] god whatever it is
[56:52] whatever god give you give it back to
[56:54] him and watch the blessings
[56:55] flow on your life i didn't want to be
[56:58] long tonight what i'd say is
[56:59] come on we're still talking about two
[57:02] masters come on
[57:03] the servant like it says service to sin
[57:05] don't be service to sin
[57:06] he says but be servants as he was saying
[57:09] i want to read here and
[57:10] he said to me the righteousness he says
[57:12] i speak out to the manner of men
[57:14] because of in the 19th verse the
[57:16] infirmity of your flesh for as you have
[57:18] yielded your members service to
[57:19] uncleanness
[57:20] and iniquity until iniquity even so now
[57:24] yield your members servants to
[57:26] righteousness
[57:27] unto holiness for when you were servants
[57:30] of sin
[57:31] uh you were free from unrighteousness
[57:33] what fruit had ye then in those things
[57:35] whereof
[57:36] ye are now ashamed i don't know about
[57:38] you but i was ashamed
[57:40] i was ashamed when i was a servant of
[57:42] sin those fruits that came out i'm
[57:44] ashamed of them come on
[57:46] i was ashamed of them he says but for
[57:49] the end of those things are death
[57:51] but now being made free come on the
[57:54] master has made you free tonight
[57:56] free from sin and become he says but now
[57:58] being made free from sin and become the
[58:00] servants of god
[58:02] you have fruits unto holiness and the
[58:05] end
[58:05] everlasting life come on yield
[58:08] yourselves to guard
[58:09] i says i says a lot of times
[58:12] what it is as individuals you can have
[58:16] you can have claims on something that
[58:18] that's not true
[58:20] you can say that hey i serve the lord
[58:22] and maybe
[58:23] people might think so from the outside
[58:25] and and and you could
[58:27] we as individuals sometimes can fool
[58:29] each other fool me and all that
[58:31] but it's something about it you can't we
[58:33] can't uh deceive the
[58:35] spirit of god you know the bible says
[58:36] the word of god is more quick it's quick
[58:38] and powerful sharpen any two-edged sword
[58:41] it'll divide those things it can go down
[58:43] and see the real you
[58:44] come on but that's why i like how in the
[58:47] scriptures it says
[58:48] you know the tree is known by the
[58:50] fruited bear
[58:52] you know i always was saying that and
[58:55] one thing i said the tree ain't
[58:56] the tree is to say that's what make the
[58:59] tree
[59:00] i mean the fruit of the tree ain't what
[59:01] make sometimes to say
[59:03] it's it's a tree bad or good but it just
[59:06] identifies what type of tree it is
[59:09] so we can have we can profess
[59:13] things but we gonna look at the fruits
[59:15] come on
[59:16] because the fruits is going to identify
[59:19] the life
[59:20] that's in that tree the fruits is going
[59:22] to identify the life they're saying you
[59:24] say we talk about fruits
[59:25] a lot of times we might think about just
[59:27] miracles and powers come on
[59:29] but we know that gifts and callings are
[59:30] without repentance but we're talking
[59:32] about a life
[59:34] he says that you would bring forth the
[59:36] fruits of holiness
[59:37] you know it's a lifestyle it's a way
[59:40] it's it's fruits that
[59:41] that that comes out of you that the
[59:44] world can't duplicate that satan himself
[59:46] can't duplicate it's certain
[59:48] fruits that come out and that's what i
[59:49] says lord what it is
[59:51] with that life come out god let it be
[59:53] the right fruit god
[59:55] come on let it be the right fruit god
[59:57] bless you
[1:00:19] so i get praise god i get joy when i
[1:00:23] think about
[1:00:24] what he's done for me amen
[1:00:28] all you got to do is think about what
[1:00:30] god has done for you

[1:00:36] what he's done for me amen
[1:00:40] you know i i i look around and i said we
[1:00:43] ought to be the most happiest people on
[1:00:44] the face of the earth
[1:00:46] amen when we don't even feel like being
[1:00:49] happy we ought to be happy
[1:00:51] amen why because amen god set us three
[1:00:56] we're free from sin we're free from
[1:00:59] shame
[1:01:01] god has bought us from a mighty long way
[1:01:04] amen when we look around and see where
[1:01:06] we could have been
