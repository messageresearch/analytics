daughter took him up and nourished him for her own son and Moses would learn in all the wisdom of the Egyptian and was mighty in word and in deed and when he was full 40 years old it came into his heart to visit his Brethren the children of Israel and seeing one of them suffered wrong he defended him and Avenged him that was oppressed and smoke the Egyptian for he supposed his Brethren would have understood how that they how that God by his hand would what Del them but they what understood not and the next day he showed himself unto them as they stro and would have set them at one against saying sir ye are what why do you wrong one to another but he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away saying who made thee a What ruler and a judge over us will thou kill me as thou did the what Egyptian yesterday and then fled Moses at this sand and was a stranger in the land of Midian where he what he got two sons and when he was and when 40 years were expired there appeared unto him in the
