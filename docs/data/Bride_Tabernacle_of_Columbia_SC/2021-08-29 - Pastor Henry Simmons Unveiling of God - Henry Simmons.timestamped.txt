[43:27] three
[43:28] second corinthians three amen we were
[43:31] talking on friday night concerning the
[43:33] rejected king and
[43:34] sort of how
[43:36] israel rejected uh the messiah i mean it
[43:39] was rejected not samuel
[43:41] and they wanted a king like the other
[43:43] nations amen
[43:46] and
[43:47] god told samuel that they didn't reject
[43:50] samuel but they rejected him
[43:53] from ruling over reigning over them
[43:56] so they had a king but they didn't know
[43:58] it was an invisible king amen
[44:01] so this morning we have a king king
[44:04] jesus amen
[44:06] praise god he's visible to the believer
[44:09] turn it down
[44:11] he's invisible to the believer but to
[44:13] the unbelievable they cannot see this
[44:16] god that we serve amen
[44:18] because
[44:20] it takes faith to sin amen
[44:24] second corinthians three
[44:26] and one it says
[44:28] do we begin to command ourselves or need
[44:32] we
[44:33] as some other
[44:35] episcopal's accommodation to you
[44:39] are letters
[44:42] of accommodation
[44:44] from you
[44:46] ye are our epistles
[44:48] written
[44:49] in our hearts
[44:51] known and read of all men
[44:54] for as much as
[44:57] ye are manifestedly
[45:01] declared to be the epistles of christ
[45:03] ministered by
[45:05] us
[45:06] written not with ink
[45:08] but with the spirit of the living god
[45:11] not in tables of stone but in the flesh
[45:13] the tables of the heart
[45:17] and such trust
[45:20] we have through christ
[45:22] to godward
[45:24] not that we are sufficient of ourselves
[45:26] to think anything as of ourselves but
[45:29] our sufficiency is of a god who also has
[45:33] made us evil ministers of the new
[45:35] testament
[45:37] not in le in
[45:38] not of the letter
[45:40] but of the spirit
[45:42] for the letter killing
[45:44] but the spirit giveth life
[45:47] but if the ministration of death written
[45:50] and engraved in stones was glorious
[45:53] so that the children of israel
[45:55] could not steadfastly behold the face of
[45:58] moses
[45:59] for the glory
[46:00] of his countenance which glory
[46:03] was to be done away
[46:05] how shall not the ministration of the
[46:08] spirit be rather glorious
[46:11] for if
[46:13] the administration of condemnation be
[46:15] glory
[46:18] much
[46:20] more
[46:22] do the ministration of righteousness
[46:24] exceeding glory
[46:25] for even
[46:27] that which was made glorious had no
[46:30] glory in
[46:31] disrespect
[46:33] by reason
[46:35] of the glory that excellent
[46:37] for if
[46:39] that which is done away was glorious
[46:42] much more that which remains is glorious
[46:45] saying then that we have such hope
[46:49] we use great plainies of speech
[46:52] and not its moses which put a veil over
[46:55] his face
[46:57] and that that the children of israel
[47:00] could not
[47:01] steadfastly look to the end
[47:04] that which is abolished
[47:07] but their minds were blinded for until
[47:10] this day remained at the same veil
[47:13] untaken away in the reading of the old
[47:16] testament which veil is done away in
[47:19] christ
[47:20] but
[47:21] even unto this state when moses is read
[47:24] the veil is upon their heart
[47:27] nevertheless
[47:28] when it shall turn to the lord the veil
[47:31] shall be taken away
[47:33] now
[47:35] the lord is that
[47:37] spirit
[47:38] and where the spirit of the lord is
[47:40] there's liberty
[47:42] god bless doing this word you may be
[47:44] seated
[47:46] glory to jesus
[47:48] god is good
[47:50] amen uh
[47:53] he said where that spirit of the lord is
[47:55] there's liberty he says here
[47:57] in the um
[47:59] 18th verse
[48:00] but we all
[48:01] with open faces beholding us in a glass
[48:04] the glory of the lord
[48:07] a change
[48:10] unto the same image
[48:12] from glory to glory even by the spirit
[48:15] of the lord
[48:17] now
[48:18] in ii corinthians 4 he says therefore
[48:22] sin we have
[48:24] this ministry as we receive mercy we
[48:26] faint not but have renounced the hidden
[48:29] things of dishonesty and not walking and
[48:31] crafting this nor handling the word of
[48:32] god deceitfully but by manifestation of
[48:36] the truth committing ourselves to every
[48:37] man's conscience in the sight of god
[48:40] but if our gospel be here it is here to
[48:42] them that are what
[48:44] lost
[48:45] amen
[48:46] we want to talk about the unveiling of
[48:48] god this morning amen god no
[48:51] and you know somebody might say the
[48:53] mighty god is unveiled before us amen
[48:56] the unveiling of god god
[48:58] we if we look back at the tabernacle in
[49:01] the old testament it was the outer
[49:04] courts and then we had
[49:06] the holy place and then we had the most
[49:08] holy place
[49:09] so by the grace of god that was
[49:12] and then we look at it as being
[49:14] justification
[49:16] when we give god
[49:18] come to god by faith
[49:20] and god justified us forgive us of our
[49:23] sins and we are baptized in the name of
[49:25] the lord jesus christ amen
[49:28] then we're sanctified we come into the
[49:30] holy place amen
[49:32] our our lives get cleaned up god
[49:34] washington of the world by the word god
[49:36] began to sanctify us clean our lives
[49:39] take things out
[49:40] he sanctifies us amen
[49:43] all the time we say the glass that was
[49:44] in the mud it's picked up out of the mud
[49:47] are you with me
[49:49] you're picking up out the mood amen
[49:51] justification you've been picked up out
[49:53] of the mud
[49:54] amen we're in our sins and god picked us
[49:57] up out of our sins now after he pictures
[50:00] the glasses of glass up he began to
[50:02] clean it up and wash it
[50:04] amen
[50:06] then we come into the holy place where
[50:09] we're sanctified
[50:11] then we
[50:12] there's another veil there
[50:14] and that's the most holy place
[50:17] and that's where the chicano glory is
[50:19] amen
[50:21] so
[50:22] in the inner veil it's where we want to
[50:24] be amen we want to be in the most holy
[50:27] place amen
[50:29] so the unveiling of god nobody could go
[50:31] back there but the high priest he went
[50:33] once a year are you with me
[50:37] so
[50:38] here we go and that's
[50:40] we're talking about going into the
[50:41] baptism of the holy ghost
[50:43] now before god can fill us up he's got
[50:46] to clean us up
[50:48] amen if you're not cleaned up
[50:51] amen
[50:52] you know oftentimes we hear this saying
[50:54] god will not dwell in an unclean place
[50:57] amen so god has to clean this up in
[50:59] order to fill us up
[51:01] who wants to drink out of a dirty glass
[51:04] are you with me
[51:06] you see the glass is all filthy and
[51:07] dirty and you put your substance in you
[51:10] don't want to fill it up with the water
[51:11] or or some type of
[51:14] drink
[51:15] you got to clean it up before you drink
[51:17] out it right
[51:18] so we all was
[51:20] you know we were filthy all of us was we
[51:23] were sinners amen
[51:25] but god saved us one day he even we
[51:27] heard the gospel we heard that jesus
[51:30] died for our sins and we accepted jesus
[51:32] christ as our savior lord and savior
[51:34] right well after after receiving jesus
[51:37] christ after he
[51:40] we accepted him as our savior amen still
[51:43] it had to be a working
[51:45] god had to work on us amen the spirit
[51:47] had to get some things out of our lives
[51:49] amen we were amen though god has called
[51:52] us and though we accepted him now god
[51:55] want to clean us up amen
[51:57] you know some folks never pass the first
[51:59] stage that's as far as they go and a lot
[52:02] of times they say they're born again
[52:03] we're born again you've been born again
[52:06] you accepted jesus christ now you're
[52:07] born again
[52:09] you know
[52:10] the bible says
[52:12] now to be born again according to jesus
[52:14] jesus so nicodemus except a man be born
[52:17] again he cannot enter into the kingdom
[52:18] of god nicodemus said how can a man be
[52:20] born when he's old can he earn a second
[52:22] time into his mother's womb i'm going
[52:24] too fast
[52:26] are y'all with me
[52:27] you know some of y'all is just
[52:29] rehearsing amen
[52:30] praise god we're going to get to heaven
[52:33] we're going to sing a shout out
[52:35] amen
[52:36] so by the grace of god not it's a stage
[52:40] okay so by the grace of god god wants to
[52:43] do more for us than we think we have you
[52:46] know sometimes things have become so
[52:49] common to us and we've heard it so much
[52:51] till we think we got it
[52:53] and a lot of times amen god wants to
[52:55] amen he said he he told them to write
[52:58] the commandments in their forehead read
[53:00] them day and night he wanted them to
[53:02] continually remember what god had done
[53:04] for them and and though they thought
[53:06] well
[53:07] what's use because he wants you amen uh
[53:10] they're meditating and day and night
[53:12] amen that's why david said that word
[53:14] have i hid in my heart that i might not
[53:16] sin against you i want that word to be
[53:19] so engraved down inside of you because i
[53:21] want that word to be a part of you
[53:23] are you with me
[53:25] that when the enemy come in like a flood
[53:27] then you've got something aim at the lip
[53:28] of a standard against him amen so you
[53:31] got to have something to drive that
[53:33] devil back when he can begin to attack
[53:35] you
[53:35] jesus amen when satan amen began to
[53:39] say
[53:40] tempt him he said man it is written amen
[53:44] so you got to say what's written
[53:47] praise god but
[53:48] it's one thing to know that it's written
[53:52] amen
[53:53] you you said i i believe the word but
[53:56] believing and not living it is saying
[53:58] that you don't believe it
[54:01] are you with me
[54:02] see because if you say you believe it
[54:04] then you
[54:05] amen you live it
[54:08] what you believe you live
[54:10] and if you don't live it and you say you
[54:12] believe it then you don't believe it
[54:15] are you with me
[54:17] so as many people go to church and they
[54:19] said i believe jesus christ as my lord
[54:21] and my savior amen and i believe that
[54:24] i'm a christian you believe it but amen
[54:27] it's one thing
[54:28] to believe in another things amen to
[54:32] live it
[54:34] if that
[54:35] if what you believe
[54:37] can't be brought to light manifestation
[54:39] you know i says uh uh uh
[54:42] i preached a sermon some time ago i said
[54:45] read me
[54:47] read me and
[54:49] where did i get that from he says uh
[54:53] this uh three and uh two he said ye are
[54:56] epistles written
[54:58] in our hearts known and what
[55:02] read of all men amen see
[55:05] if god has been
[55:07] amen revealed to you and god it has come
[55:11] into you
[55:13] amen then yo your flesh veil may hide he
[55:18] meant the
[55:19] the god that's in the inside
[55:22] i i heard him say we have this tragedy
[55:24] in the earthly vessels that the
[55:27] excellency of the power may be of god
[55:29] and not of us
[55:31] see amen
[55:32] it's god amen kid in christ amen it was
[55:37] god veiled in a man called jesus
[55:41] but it was god that was in christ
[55:44] so jesus was able to say when you see me
[55:47] you see my father why they were looking
[55:50] at a man but amen god was in the man
[55:53] called jesus
[55:55] amen people look at you but amen it's
[55:58] the unveiling it's a veil there that
[56:00] they're looking at a flesh field but
[56:02] they don't know that god is in you
[56:06] and he's the hope of glory
[56:08] and the god that's in you make the
[56:10] difference
[56:11] amen because you become a part of god
[56:15] are you with me
[56:16] and all that god was amen praise god the
[56:20] works that i do shall you do
[56:23] amen amen because greater works oh
[56:26] hallelujah
[56:27] amen you want to be able to recognize
[56:30] who's in you and if he's in you then
[56:33] amen
[56:34] amen he said not the letter
[56:37] the letter killed him not just because
[56:39] you said i believe the word he said the
[56:41] letter killing but the spirit give what
[56:44] give life amen and if you got that in
[56:46] life then you got that power to manifest
[56:49] what you believe
[56:51] amen the holy ghost come to demonstrate
[56:53] what you believe
[56:55] praise god amen the letter just said i
[56:57] got it i got it i got it but amen except
[57:00] the water comes on the seed the water
[57:03] the seed and bring the seed to life
[57:06] praise god the spirit comes to quicken
[57:08] the word amen and to bring it to life
[57:11] that it might manifest itself
[57:14] are you with me
[57:15] so
[57:16] amen
[57:17] god amen not only is veiled in christ
[57:21] but in that christ is veiled in the
[57:24] bride in amen in you
[57:28] and when and when christ is unveiled in
[57:31] you amen then it's no more
[57:34] paul said there's no more i to live
[57:37] but it's christ that liveth in me jesus
[57:40] died
[57:42] for us that
[57:44] we might live
[57:47] amen the purpose of his death
[57:51] amen that he can
[57:53] descend and come down and dwell in you
[57:56] and i
[57:58] a sin
[58:00] he accepted that he might be sin
[58:03] amen
[58:05] praise god and i thank god for him dying
[58:08] he went down and he died and the reason
[58:11] we die to ourselves
[58:14] we have to die amen that we can a maybe
[58:18] live
[58:19] amen for others
[58:22] once you die to yourself you can live
[58:25] and other folk can read

[58:31] read the way you talk they read the way

[1:00:14] just skip down here in the fourth
[1:00:16] chapter amen of second corinthians it
[1:00:19] says
[1:00:20] he says for we preach not ourselves fear
[1:00:23] first for we preaching on ourselves but
[1:00:25] christ jesus our lord and ourselves your
[1:00:28] servant for jesus sake for god who
[1:00:31] commanded the light to shine out of
[1:00:32] darkness has shined in our hearts to
[1:00:34] give the light of the knowledge of the
[1:00:36] glory of god in the face of jesus christ
[1:00:40] but we have this trade and earthly
[1:00:43] vessels that the excellency of the power
[1:00:45] may be
[1:00:46] of god and not of us
[1:00:48] we're trouble on what
[1:00:51] trouble on every side yet not what
[1:00:54] we're perplexed but not what
[1:00:58] persecuted but not what
[1:01:00] cast down
[1:01:02] but not what
[1:01:05] always burned about in our body to what
[1:01:10] see you're burying your body the dying
[1:01:12] of the lord jesus
[1:01:13] i i die daily i'm crucified with christ
[1:01:16] nevertheless i live amen it's a dying
[1:01:20] out you got to die to yourself doctor
[1:01:23] what you will and what you want you got
[1:01:25] to say lord amen i want your will to be
[1:01:28] done in my life amen and i said you know
[1:01:31] on friday to reject
[1:01:34] reject the word is to reject the king
[1:01:37] amen the king that
[1:01:39] amen paula said uh put an inscription
[1:01:43] amen the king of the jews you said i
[1:01:45] don't want him but those were the people
[1:01:47] that he came to save those are the
[1:01:49] people that he came to die for those
[1:01:52] were the people he came to reveal god
[1:01:55] and let them see their god amen but
[1:01:57] because he had a veil on it because the
[1:02:00] bible said who has believed our report
[1:02:02] and to whom is the arm of the lord
[1:02:04] revealed for he should grow up as a
[1:02:06] tender plant and as a root out of dry
[1:02:08] ground
[1:02:09] amen praise god but we hear this is
[1:02:12] where our face is from him amen and when
[1:02:14] we saw him there was no beauty that we
[1:02:16] should desire of him
[1:02:18] amen and that's what it is the word of
[1:02:21] god amen has come to you and i and
[1:02:24] christ is revealed in his own word and
[1:02:27] yet the people seem to be looking amen
[1:02:31] amen
[1:02:33] it's just like god's servants say god
[1:02:36] was in moses it was not moses that
[1:02:38] brought the children of israel out of
[1:02:40] egypt it was god amen praise god when
[1:02:43] the people disrespected moses they was
[1:02:46] disrespecting god when the people
[1:02:48] rejected samuel they rejected god when
[1:02:50] the people reject you they're rejecting
[1:02:53] god
[1:02:55] are you with me
[1:02:57] praise god because you are representing
[1:02:59] him you are an ambassador amen we pray
[1:03:01] you in christ said be you reconciled to
[1:03:03] god
[1:03:05] are you with me
[1:03:06] praise god but when you reject the word
[1:03:08] amen see that's what wrong amen
[1:03:12] when
[1:03:13] when somebody's singing the the word of
[1:03:15] god amen it's god amen trying to talk to
[1:03:19] you amen you say well i uh
[1:03:21] this is that when somebody's preaching
[1:03:23] amen it's god amen it's talking to you
[1:03:26] it's the word of god coming to you amen
[1:03:29] and what and don't let
[1:03:30] when the anointing in the power of god
[1:03:33] amen do amen the holy ghost is being
[1:03:36] ministered to you and you reject the
[1:03:38] holy ghost you're rejecting god
[1:03:41] praise god when you say this is the
[1:03:43] devil it meant then you amen become a
[1:03:46] black streamer of the holy ghost
[1:03:48] praise god when they said he casted out
[1:03:51] devils invincible
[1:03:53] praise god when they said the amen and
[1:03:56] true folks are so quick amen to judge
[1:03:59] that when the holy ghost is moving and
[1:04:01] when the holy ghost is not moving and
[1:04:02] when it's man is when it's you know
[1:04:05] be careful amen because if you make a
[1:04:07] mistake you can be condemning jesus
[1:04:10] again
[1:04:11] and crucifying the flesh the same god
[1:04:14] god can be inside of an individual you
[1:04:17] can think amen praise god it's just
[1:04:20] it's a song song it's just brother so
[1:04:22] and so but that's god veiled inside of
[1:04:25] them amen praise god he said touch not
[1:04:28] my anointing through my prophets no harm
[1:04:30] saul when he's on the way down to the
[1:04:32] masses to persecute the church he was
[1:04:34] persecuting god why because god was
[1:04:37] veiled in his people
[1:04:38] are you with me
[1:04:40] and he said who are you lord the lord
[1:04:42] said i'm jesus whom you what
[1:04:44] you perceive you name it touch not
[1:04:46] minority to my prophets no heart be
[1:04:49] careful amen
[1:04:51] that's why we above all things love one
[1:04:53] another
[1:04:54] amen praise god show love amen be
[1:04:57] merciful be kind be tenderhearted one
[1:05:00] towards another
[1:05:02] praise god some folks you got to get a
[1:05:04] crowbar and try to apply some love out
[1:05:06] of them and some loving kindness they
[1:05:08] don't know how to be nice they said this
[1:05:10] is the way god made me amen god made you
[1:05:13] god is a god of love and with loving
[1:05:15] kindness have i drawn you
[1:05:18] are you a man
[1:05:19] praise god you'll find amen that god is
[1:05:22] a merciful god god is not a god he said
[1:05:24] i didn't come to church to condemn the
[1:05:26] world but i come to save and i believe
[1:05:28] some of us come to condemn amen and not
[1:05:31] to save
[1:05:33] praise god i believe that we got to come
[1:05:35] amen to a place where amen we'll see a
[1:05:38] saint a loving savior that cares about
[1:05:40] us and cares about our lives cares about
[1:05:42] our everything about us

[1:08:25] places
[1:08:27] and they could read your forehead and
[1:08:29] read your poem and they said how you you
[1:08:31] know did anybody read your palm no no no
[1:08:34] no no no

[1:08:39] read you
[1:08:41] i re i read your forehead

[1:08:50] man told me he says you so and so and so
[1:08:53] and so on
[1:08:54] i said oh okay
[1:08:56] you know if god would just put
[1:09:00] his eyes or somebody with focus and look
[1:09:02] at what do you want people to see
[1:09:05] if somebody was reading you what do you
[1:09:07] wanted to see
[1:09:08] how kind and how loving you are
[1:09:11] he said you know some folks get the idea
[1:09:13] i don't care what folks think about me
[1:09:19] jesus wanted to show the compassion of
[1:09:21] god and the love of god
[1:09:23] and any christian that's truly saved
[1:09:26] he don't they don't want to present
[1:09:29] a personality that is a negative
[1:09:32] personality they don't want to present
[1:09:34] themselves as
[1:09:36] uh
[1:09:38] they want to show the compassionate of
[1:09:40] god
[1:09:41] they want to be easily to be entreated
[1:09:44] they want to show compassion and loved
[1:09:47] and look at the attributes of god
[1:09:50] he's jehovah jiren he's the lord the
[1:09:52] prophet he's jehovah shalom he's our
[1:09:54] peace
[1:09:55] amen
[1:09:57] the thing that god
[1:09:59] the bible calling wonderful counts the
[1:10:01] prince of peace
[1:10:04] see it's different characteristics look
[1:10:07] at what the spirit the attributes of the
[1:10:09] spirit love joy meekness kindness
[1:10:12] all of those attributes of the spirit
[1:10:15] if they were looking at you would they
[1:10:16] see those attributes
[1:10:18] would they see jesus
[1:10:20] the kind of person jesus was is that the
[1:10:22] kind of person is god
[1:10:25] veiled in you
[1:10:26] is is god being veiled in your flesh is
[1:10:30] god hidden
[1:10:32] this is what he said in colossians three
[1:10:34] and one
[1:10:37] colossians
[1:10:42] are you all right this morning
[1:10:44] you love the lord
[1:10:46] amen and because we love him amen we
[1:10:50] yield ourselves and to renounce us
[1:10:53] it's very understanding we we come to a
[1:10:55] place where christians have gotten so
[1:10:58] cold and lukewarm that they don't even
[1:11:00] care how they present themselves
[1:11:05] they don't seem to care
[1:11:07] as he said i would that you were hot or
[1:11:09] cold because lukewarm i spew you out of
[1:11:11] my mouth
[1:11:12] people don't seem to care about how they
[1:11:15] present themselves and they'll they'll
[1:11:17] be so nice and irritated
[1:11:20] right in your face
[1:11:23] almost like you
[1:11:25] something wrong
[1:11:26] so why
[1:11:28] should we always just check yourself
[1:11:30] when you find the depression
[1:11:32] is on you you got to find a place you
[1:11:34] can let off the pressure
[1:11:36] where you can reflect jesus christ
[1:11:38] because we all can get a little worked
[1:11:41] up and
[1:11:42] get a little you know
[1:11:44] pressure on us and that we're not in the
[1:11:46] right place at the time
[1:11:48] but when we find ourselves not in the
[1:11:49] right place
[1:11:51] then we got to go
[1:11:53] to the altar and just find that upper
[1:11:55] room experience
[1:11:57] lord i need a refilling of your spirit
[1:12:00] and i know when you get the holy ghost
[1:12:03] you're going to reflect the love of god
[1:12:05] when you
[1:12:06] well when folk are scared to approach
[1:12:09] you
[1:12:10] then you got
[1:12:12] you know you ought to be easily to being
[1:12:14] treated
[1:12:16] a folk or you know i don't know what i
[1:12:20] i'm gonna tell you something the devil
[1:12:22] he's difficult to reapproach jesus
[1:12:26] jesus i know who you are why you come to
[1:12:28] term
[1:12:29] you know so it's it's a two it's a
[1:12:32] two-edged sword it's two ways now
[1:12:34] praise god people when they know that
[1:12:37] you're a christian
[1:12:39] and they you know they they you know
[1:12:41] they're cursing and smoking and drinking
[1:12:45] they're doing all kind of crazy stuff
[1:12:47] and
[1:12:48] they don't want to
[1:12:49] approach you
[1:12:51] because they know you might smell the
[1:12:55] cigarettes or the alcohol
[1:12:58] all of that stuff and
[1:13:00] so
[1:13:01] now it's not that you are difficult to
[1:13:04] approach
[1:13:06] it's that
[1:13:07] the holiness of god the people can look
[1:13:09] at you
[1:13:11] i tell the story about
[1:13:13] elijah young preacher

[1:13:17] they had the bong man and nicholson he
[1:13:19] was on television and everybody saw the

[1:14:41] paper
[1:14:42] he put some dirt on it
[1:14:44] and he did it like that
[1:14:46] and three crosses showed up
[1:14:49] and then i later on i found out
[1:14:51] that was one of the main route doctors
[1:14:54] in the area
