In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. The book of Hebrews 10th chapter. Amen. [Music] Hebrews 10. [Music] I want to start at the 19th verse. Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiness, holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, excuse me, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh, and having in high priest over the House of God, let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us pray. Father, we thank you, oh God, for your word, Lord. May you bless it in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Appreciate the Lord tonight. I want to try this for a few minutes tonight to talk to you on a little thought of a consecrated life Jesus. A consecrated life. If you notice here in the scripture, it says 20th verse, by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us. In other words, he made it possible that we also can have a consecrated life. What does a consecrated life means? It says here to to live a consecrated life means to dedicate oneself to God and just the point I real and live in a way that glorifies him. Amen. Not just to dedicate yourself, but it's a setting yourself apart. We have so much to contend with in this generation, so many pulls. And everything is really out just to pull you away from what's the real thing. Amen. And brother Ernest a lot of time distractions. Not that what we are doing is not important but it's not important than God. We say a lot of time that you know we want God to be first. But in our everyday living and our action, we can see that he's not really first. [Music] And the Bible plenty teller, he says, "Seek ye first." The kingdom of God. In other words, nothing else shall be before God to you, not as individual. Now I notice this that when God is calling for this kind of life, I guess I can probably say it like it did in Revelation. He who hath a ear, let him hear what the spirit is saying to the churches. God have to do something in me and your life. Yes, Jesus. And sister sing song. I feel the pull. I believe that as late as it is, we all ought to be feeling the pull that Lord, I got to get close to you. Amen. Bless. We looking and seeing current events mean clear through prophecy. We are seeing the very Bible unfolding man. uh declaring the thing that was broke. Now we living in a day that we seen it coming to pass. And I believe that to us as belie as as Christians, it ought to make us tighten up. It ought to be a pull on us that hey, we see that, you know, it's nearer than we ever thought. We already talked about it's soon and soon, but soon and very soon we're going to see the king. But it ought to cause us now to really get more serious about our own life. Each individual ought to be a little more concerned about your walk with God. Where are we at? Amen. Go ahead. And we see in our lives, we see things ling. We see that the world seem to be consuming us. I mean, the Bible say one place say that cares of this life will choke the very life of God out of you. Amen. But it all depends on whom you yield yourself to. The Bible said another place says set your affections on things where that's what our mind ought to be sinning. Now whatever we doing we going to keep doing that but my affection is on things above. I'm not looking for this here here. No, I'm looking up. what I have here and what I don't have here. Okay, it's all right. But I don't want to miss the song said, "Whatever you're doing, Lord, in this season, don't do it without me." Amen. Amen. I don't want to get so wrapped up into what this world has going on to where I miss what God is doing in our season. Lord help us. We are in we say a crucial hour a hour where we ought to be desperate. We got enough just in our own lives, in our own family that ought to throw us on the altar. Amen. Hallelujah. It ought to keep us on our knees and on our faces and fastening and crying out because you know physically there are thing going on around us and with us that we can't do nothing about. Go ahead. It's going to take God to do these things. Amen. But we must begin to cry out, "Lord, here I am." Amen. It's not just enough anymore for us just to come to church and sing a song and those things look good and whatever we do. But it got to be something we doing at home cuz whatever we're doing home, we bringing it here. And if you ain't doing nothing out there, you ain't going to be doing nothing in here. Come on now. I don't know about you, but you our hearts ought to be stirred. A lot of time you know we look for uh a group you know to that we can do it as a group but God is calling individuals and you must hear that call. Every individual that's a Christian ought to hear the urgency that it's later than you think. Amen. Amen. So God said, "We done played the church and we done played religious, but we have got to get a hold of God. It's urgent." Amen. Zab is telling me, man, it's going to take more than just what we have been doing. We up against some demonic powers, even when it come to the church world, demonic influences. I like that definition because it said that we ought to be living in such a way that it pleases God. That's true. Amen. Not just talking about the things you know that brother Brandham taught us, but there ought to be a life that we are living before the people and they see that that life is on display. Amen. They see that there's somebody that is getting along somewhere with God and they they're turning down all the worldly thing, but they realize that, you know, I have got to do it. And I'll say this, if you ain't doing nothing, you ain't going to get nothing. Amen. A lot of time we always we always put it on well it ought to be the pastor doing it and we don't have to consecrate it. That's not true because if he's consecrated and you are not you can't even receive what he is saying. Amen. But if we all, you know, if we can just get our minds in a place that this and whatever we doing, let's take care of it. But I must get a hold of God. We can't wait around anymore for this picture to come or that to happen or this. No, you have your own personal meeting with God in your own closet. You meet with God in that closet. Bless him. in a personal relationship. The problem we having is the life that we are living is not matching what we are talking about. the terminologies that we didn't know them so well, you know, because they are quotations that the prophet of God spoke about and everybody's always talking about, you know, and reading. Nothing wrong with those thing to read those thing and talk about it but there ought to be some kind of manifestation in our lives because see you are talking about something that has been and it's like God ain't doing nothing now with nobody replaced on what brother Bon said brother Bon did yes but he said now he said after I'm gone he said that the ministry is going to take these things that I've spoken to you and they by inspir they're going to preach these things to the people. In other words, the very things he has given us and when the ministers get it by inspiration, he gives it to the people and it ought to cause a change in us. The word being preached ought to have a change uh in effect. Amen. that when we see God speaking to our condition, then we'll understand, hey, I got to really get a hold of God in this area. And as a whole, I'm talking about worldwide basically or how you want to put it. We did get a little excited for a little while, but then after a few days, we right back to the same corner. We need something to happen. Amen. And let me tell you something. If you don't cry out for God, if you don't have a hunger and a thirst, you know, to uh get closer to God yourself. One place he said he said that we shouldn't be in the predicament that we in the laidback and the unconcerned that we have gotten to that the lay of the seal of spirit doesn't captivate us and now it's molding us to to take it easy. You're going to be all right. You will catch up. Let me tell you something. Don't you believe that? I believe we ought to be pinching ourselves. The Bible say, "Examine your own selves." You ought to know where you at in your experience with God. You ought to be seeing spiritual growth. We ought to be seeing dynamics. The power of God ought to be so activated in our lives. Samson said, "Lord, once more, Lord, help us. Help us to get more consecrated. Help us to be more dedicated. Help me not to be so loose. We just do anything nowadays. We're not even conscious that God wants to deal with you. When he called you, he didn't call you just to be calling you. When he called Samson, he calls it as a Nazerite vow. Amen. And what Samson did? He started playing around and he played around and played around with women type of the church. Play around with churches. Lord help until he met Dealila and she was commissioned to find out where Samson scrimp is at. And I mean that's what the devil done to, you know, I'm not saying I say us on top of all over. He found out where a script is at. We are glad just to be in a message, but that message ought to be producing a powerhouse life. Amen. Agree. We've gotten to the place we don't even think about witnessing no more. I tell her be married. I said God didn't save us just to be confined to buildings. Everybody want a pull pit. Everybody want a spotlight position. Everybody want to do this. But nobody want to get yourself in a place that you can go out into the hedges. Go ahead. that God can begin to lead to you. Go there and God will put people in your pathway. But we got to have something that they want. And the people know when you got something. That's true. Amen. your very life, that presence, you know, that you living in and you bathing in, they know that you got something. Mom, me and Peter was going to the prayer. That man at the gate begging and Peter told him, "Look on us." They know they had something. He wanted money, but they had something greater that money couldn't buy. Amen. You see the Bible say the man was expecting to receive something and the people are expecting to receive something. They wonder where are the people at you know I was thinking I said you know when much has been given to us and then there's much required true amen don't you know that when God gives us we these thing this word he gave us you know then he requiring more out of us because we have something that the world basically don't know anything about. I'm not just talking about a a letter form, but I'm talking about, you know, a very manifestation of God in our lives. Come on now. Where is the power and manifestation of God in this hour? Sometime you wondering things people think God weak that the thing that he said he'll do that he don't do it no more and I hear people say that God don't do these things no more God don't you when when did he stop so God said God takes his man but not the spirit and that was the spirit of Christ. And so if Christ is here, then those same thing ought to be going on. Amen. They ought to be going on in our local assemblies. They ought to be going in your everyday life. Amen. But because that we not consecrated enough. Amen. People are losing their minds and done something gave up hope because they don't see any demonstration of the power of God. And it's like that we done taught it away or we done g people so much intellectual speakers and we done took the power of God away from the people. They don't no longer see the supernatural but yet it's still here. But until we as people of God by now we ought to understand what the ministry really is all about. It's not to just make us uh intellectual giant or smart people. But God want to produce a life in us a consecrated life. a life that God can be well pleased with. Amen. And if God isn't pleased, then what are we doing? Lord, help us. They had us say, "Lord, take me back." Because there, you know, it used to be I don't even want to talk like that cuz I know God is still doing those things. Yes, sir. But it takes a people that is understanding what the ministry is all about and they have caught the vision cuz he could without a vision the people are perish. We ought to know what God want done with this word that he gave us. True. Amen. We are supposed to be the people that is supposed to be taking this gospel to everyone that we come in contact with and telling them, "Come see a man." I'm talking about Jesus Christ. Come see a man that can tell you all your things. Come see a man that that can change your very life. Even at your lowest state that you in, God can turn it all around. Amen. A lot of what he said is it won't rain until I call for it. Let me tell you something. You ain't going to get nothing from God until you call for it. You got the call for it. The pastor's calling for it, but you got to call for it. It must be personal. It must be a a a individual affair between you and your God. Amen. Cuz we don't know what's going to happen next. I'm not supposed to worry about that. But I know what God is doing. I know the place that he has been taking us and trying to get us to. Amen. Amen. That's why he sent this word to prepare us for what's coming. Amen. Amen. But you can't be prepared if you ain't studying. We not praying. We not consecrating our life. We have to wait till somebody tell us to do it. when it ought to be the Holy Ghost put you on a fast. Amen. The Holy Ghost ought to be leading you. Hey, separate yourself. Come on now. Amen. Spend some time with me. That's what God want. You give everybody else their time, but you won't give me my time. Amen. You give your job. You give your shopping. You give your children. You get your wife, but you won't give God the time. Amen. And he ought to be the most important thing to you. Cuz without him, you can't do nothing. That's right. He's the one that wake you up. He's the one that gives you the strength in that body to be able to go and do those things you do. It's because of him. Maybe we not aware of that yet. It's all because of him. Nothing of your good effort. Not that you so good, not that he got to do it, but that's God grace. Amen. And if God have enough grace on us to allow us to do this thing, how much more we ought to be on fire for him. Amen. What happened to our time? Something has consumed it. Yes, something has as I say something have consumed the time that the people is too busy now. They have increased with goods. They liking nothing. Gain gain gain. Get get nothing wrong with that. As long as God is first. Amen. The top of your chart ought to be everything you do, God first. Amen. Career, God first. Amen. Your job, God first. And if he's not first, there's a reason a lot of time that the results we get don't come out correctly. And we have sparks, but we need fire. Amen. Spark is a sign that fire, you know, can happen. But you can't have sparks all the time and no fire never come from it. I'm going to read one thing. I'm going to close. And God through his mercy has washed us and separated us by the washing of the word by the waters and separate his church from the things of the world unto a separated consecrated life to live for him walking in his present world without condemnation. There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ through Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but been separated by the water through the word. That's what he's calling his church for to separate them from the world. They got to be a difference. Amen. Amen. They got to be between us and the world. Amen. And I told me man I tell I'm not talking about our long dresses either. I talking about our hair not being cut and those things are all right to do but that's not what I'm talking it must be more than clothes. It ought to be a manifestation. Amen. That we are so anointed by the spirit of God that when the devil even see you that he has to run. Come on now. Amen. He can't stay in your presence. Amen. I mean was they Peter them name that they said the shadow Peter don't shadow casting out devil. Why? Because it was the presence of God with them. Amen. And so God always he said if you want to know what our church ought to be like he said read the book of acts cuz we ought to be a duplicate in some. Amen. He didn't have the fullness of the word like we got it. The more the word God released then the power of God come with it. Amen. If we preach it and teach it in the right context, we'll get the right results, not mixing it with some man-made idea and upholding some other person in Jesus Christ. If we preach Jesus Christ to the person, we're getting Jesus Christ on the scene. Amen. Amen. But you preach a man, you get a man. Amen. Sir, we would see Jesus. Amen. That's what we ought to be seeing. Amen. When you come to church, you ought to not leave until Jesus come in your presence. Cuz we got needs. Amen. Right now, all of us got need things in our lives, things that nobody else can do but God. Amen. Amen. And if God is the only one can do it, then let's cry out Lord here I am tonight. Amen. Amen. Come on. God know the deep things in your heart. Those thing that nobody else know about. God said I I heard your prayer. I know what's in your heart and here I am to do it. What are we pulling for? We ought to be pulling for God. Come on, brother S. That's my desire. Lord, give us that consecrated life. Not just on Sunday, not just on Friday, but Lord, let me just live in your presence, God. that you know it's time you know you wake up I don't know about you you wake up in the morning time and even before you open your mouth just that presence of God just be so imminent to you and but when that present isn't there you feel bad you feel dry you start feeling that am I say what happen. You need a consecration. You need to call for it. Lord, anoint me aresh again. Amen. Rededicate my life, Lord. Amen. Amen. God bless you. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Praise God. Amen. How many you want it? Amen. A consecrated life. Amen. Consecrate me, Lord, for thy service, Lord. That's what we want, a consecrated life. We know Israel just bombed Iran and it could be we we're inching and getting closer and closer to the third world war. And if it's a world war, that means it affect every country in the world. And if it does, we should be out of here. The rapture should have taken place before the bombs hit America. The bride ought to be gone. [Music] Are you looking to be gone? Are you looking to still be around here? Because the way things are going, it won't be long. Amen. And we'll be leaving here. Okay, sister. It won't be long. It won't be long here. It won't be long.

We'll be going home. will be going home. [Music] Let's get ready and consecrate ourselves vessels, vessels of honor that we'll be ready, Amen, to go to the place that God has for you and I. So, let's consecrate ourselves. We thank God for the word tonight. Appreciate Brother Palmer. Amen. Amen. Let us just bow our heads. Gracious kind heavenly father, what hour that we live in. Something ought to throw us into desperation because of the signs of the time. Hallelujah. Father, we know we are getting it closer, closer to this world. Oh God, the atomic power, the nuclear powers raging. Father, they're just waiting on that moment, that instant as you have the angels holding back the four winds. [Music] Lord, one day, oh God, they won't hold it back any longer. Servants of God will be sealed in their forehead. And Lord, you lift up your bride out of here. So, Father, I pray tonight, Lord, that somebody would take heed to the things we heard. He said any time we should let them slip. What an hour we live in.
