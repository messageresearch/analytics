[33:00] it's not the chemistry of the blood but
[33:02] it's the life that was in the blood

[33:07] and I believe it's that same life that
[33:09] was in the blood then it's the same life
[33:12] now
[33:13] I believe the Holy Ghost is the evidence
[33:16] that the blood has been applied

[33:21] that the blood of Jesus had been applied
[33:23] to our lives

[48:06] our weakness tell him about our fails
