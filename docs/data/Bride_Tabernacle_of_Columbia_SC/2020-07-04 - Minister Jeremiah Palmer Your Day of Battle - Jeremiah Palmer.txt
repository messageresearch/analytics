to the book of ephesians the sixth chapter very familiar six and ten through twelve and then i'm gonna let you be seated and i'm gonna turn to the book of deuteronomy 20. ephesians 6 and 10 through 12 it reads finally my brethren be strong in the lord amen and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wows of the devil before we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places let us pray lord we thank you for your word tonight god and may you quicken it lord and let the holy spirit take control in jesus name amen booker deuteronomy the 20th chapter i'm reminded of paul admonishing the people to be strong in the lord let me be seated notice he letting them know that it's not your script but it's the lord's script and he said in the power of his might deuteronomy 21 through 4. when thou goes out to battle against their enemies how many you know you got an enemy and the sea is horses and cherished in other words powers and a people more than thou be not afraid of them i like that amen in other words whatever you may see going on around you and with you don't be afraid of it for the lord thy god is with thee amen you know it's good to know god with you amen sometimes we feel that we are all alone but god is with us which brought thee up out of the land of egypt and it shall be when ye are come nigh unto the battle that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people and shall say unto them heal israel ye approach this day until battle against your enemies let not your hearts faint fear not and do not tremble neither be ye terrified because of them for the lord your god is he that goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to save you amen i like that amen god giving consolation giving courage that when you go out against your enemies don't be afraid of them though you may be outnumbered though you may be uh uh uh surrounded by a host of trouble in your life don't be afraid cause i'm with you jesus said i believe saint john said that i'll be with you even in you unto the end of the world i'm telling you i'm tell you something it's good you know you got somebody that got you back and god got you he is god that's mighty in battle and i want to speak to you a little bit tonight on your day of battle your day of battle i'm reminding something the servant of god spoke to us and he said that every inch of ground you get you're going to fight for it he also said that we are not on a picnic but we are on a battlefield i believe by now we we should understand be should understand that we have got to be ready to fight you have to know that your enemy my enemy is coming for battle are you ready for the battle when a battle is about to be arranged there must be a preparation even in the natural army they bring the soldiers in to basic training and they carried them through some rugged courses some very treacherous obstacles why because they'll realize that you're gonna need this they are trying to prepare them for anything that may happen because they may be going to war no doubt as their natural army trains uh their soldiers i believe that's what god is doing i believe for over 6 000 years that god has been arming us and equipping us with our weapons i believe one place i believe is corinthian uh corinthians said our weapons are not carnal but they are mighty through god amen pulling down strongholds in the imagination i'm i'm aware as i was sharing this you know a little bible study studying uh supposed to be been uh uh teaching but i got a little caught up you know because of what i was seeing and my wife said you are you kind of lost it didn't you and so i was trying just to show that uh you and i are in a battle there ain't no need for you to sit and cry about it or or to worry yourself with it you must understand for this purpose you were chosen see god chose us to be in the worst age there is in history who are facing some of the most uh uh treacherous things that uh the human has never had to deal with everything that we have and all around us is testifying that we're in a battle and you and i must understand that uh when god chose us he didn't choose us to lose he gave us the the greatest and a powerful weapon that you could ever have to fight the enemy with we know that weapon is the word amen that's what jesus used on the devil in the book of matthew that's the only weapon that can defeat the devil that word that's why i think one of the reasons why david said that i hear thy word in their heart that i may not sinned against thee but also that when you need the weapon of the word that if it's in you it'll come out yes sir i i like that how he said in deuteronomy he said and it should be when you're come not into the battle to preach your approach and speak unto the people and say unto them heal israel ye approach this day until battle against your enemies let not your heart faint don't faint because of the battle don't fear because of the battle come on god is more than able our god uh in this age especially has equipped us with something supernatural and these weapons that we have i'm afraid sometimes that we don't understand what the word is and what it came to do but it came to cut the devil in every situation but you have to know what is in your hand look at moses i think about him moses after god trained him on the back side of the desert 40 years moses had lost all human confidence that he could do anything and i realized that's what god wanted to get us at he wants you to lose all of your humanistic confidence that you young and you strong and you smart no no no no god can't use that and god has to carry us alone somewhere uh and give us a personal experience because you're gonna need it you won't be able to fight with fleshly things or carnal thing but because this is a spiritual warfare so god understanding that the real battle really started in heaven and then it came to earth satan lost up there and he's surely going to lose down here the silver god spoke of message one in a million there's gonna be a people that's going to stand against the wiles of the devil and they're not gonna be losers they're gonna be victorious why because greater is he that is in you and he that is in the world yes it doesn't matter what comes it doesn't matter what happens around you and with you yeah you might even get sick but you got a god who is a healer not even death can hold you down paul said oh death where is thy stain oh grave where is thy victory paul understood that nothing could separate him from the love of god i like to tell you today the bible say one place that no weapon form against you shall prosper he didn't say it won't come but he said it shall not prosper see because things may come at you and things may happen to you but it won't prosper why because god has given you something amen i believe you say one place that when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord are raised up a standard against it amen i know for example you know just battling you know in your body another day i had another incident you know with my legs again twisted swole up real big and i said lord look at this devil here you back again and then i got one feeling well and then the other one go to hurt i said lord jesus this devil don't stop and i said that's all right i'm not looking at the symptoms i'm not looking at how i feel i'm not looking even at what my legs are even doing though they swell i'm calling those things as though they are not i believe your sister wanted me to sing a song satan you may stare you may fight but you're going to lose this battle tonight you can't cross the bloodline no matter what you do devil you can't win yes weeping man endure for a night but joy come in the morning you know you look at your body and look at what's going on around you you ain't careful your heart will start fretting fear a start want to start gripping you then your mind get the wandering off you start thinking all kinds of things but come on that's not the way we ought to be you got to know regardless of what comes i got the victory anyhow yes i may be feeling it in my body but in my spirit i feel the joy of the lord battle from one state to the next you turn to the left there's a battle you get over one hurdle there's another one you get over one sickness another sickness when does it stop i tell them another night i i said you might as well arm yourself i said because it's not going to stop we're living in the closing of time now i was going to speak on one time the end of all things we are living in the end of all things now that this battle is going to rage even more so you and i have to understand that uh you didn't just come to church to be coming to church but you come to church amen to get ready for your day of battle someone might say well brother i'm all right and nothing is going on keep on living i used to wonder and heal the old people said you know you keep on living a little while then you'll understand what we are saying and now i see in this physical body in this satanic demonic world that we are living in we're up against principalities powers spiritual wickedness demons that out to kill steal and destroy you he doesn't care how or or when or what he uses he's out to take us out of here he's out to make you uh like joke cursed your god and die but god had confidence in job i like to say god got confidence in you god begin to tell satan uh have you considered my servant a perfect and upright man oh i imagine satan didn't like that god called job perfect and upright and he said oh he he served you because of what you're blessing him with he said you take all those natural blessings he said he'll curse you to your face see but god knew better than that god know better than you also god got more confidence in you than you got in your own self knows that you can't stand the testes he'll deign you for it he's here to prepare us because we're living in one of the worstest time there ever was i was saying one time to someone i said that we are actually making history we are writing the continuation of the bible it's been spoken of us that god will have himself a bride that won't defile herself she won't uh uh turn back on god but she'll go forward regardless of what's going on the bible says one place fear not little flock he said but it's your father good pleasure they give you the kingdom let's turn also to the book of uh second chronicles yes 20. hopefully that i can try to talk a little bit about david but ii chronicles 20 and 15. and he said hearkening y'all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem and thou king jehoshaphat thus saith the lord unto you be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but gods i like that word of comfort that your battle in my battle is not mine but it's god's we must understand that it's not my might not by power but by his spirit we overcame by the blood of the lamb in the word of his testimony the battle that is set before us is already won we must understand that we have have not chosen this way but god chose us for it god knew that this generation this very hour would come and he would have some people that that that had been trained by god to be steadfast unremovable not fearful but will walk by faith and not by sight they will not look at their circumstances or their condition they're looking up for which cometh all their help that's what you got to look to especially in this hour especially in this cycle of time as we hear so many things transpiring country after country the political economically spiritually everything seemed to be chaotic nothing is certain anymore everything has been shooken of course nothing that you can put your hopes in that can give you comfort the doctors have done all they could do thank god for them medically they have done all they could do yet in all of the good effort they are laboring like they're laboring they still can't find the answer where is the answer to what we need is there no bomb in gideon is there no physician here that can handle cover 19. is that a god in america that sits high and looks low and understand that oh if my people that are called by my name all if they are humble themselves and pray turn from their wicked ways there is a bomb there is a physician his name is jesus christ the one that specializes in everything nothing you have nothing going on that god can handle god is saying i am the answer turn to me look unto me i am the way the truth in the life i'm the creator i'm the one that was and is and shall be again what are you looking for your answers right here oh just imagine the very answer that everybody is looking for is right here they're trying to get an antidote something that may work and may not i pray that it does but the answer is so simple and they're looking all over it the world is just looking all over the real answer people are hoping this you know the healed commercials they always like to say we are in this together we are in this together yeah partially you are right but what are you looking to what are you looking to to give us to get everybody to answer because some medicine may help some may they might kill another but god gave us a pill and if you take this gospel it will heal everything not only your sickness but it'll heal broken hearts it'll deliver you from any habits it can give you new life again oh if the people only will try him i'm not talking about just going to a church and getting a religion that's not what i'm talking about because the bible said they have a form of godliness but denying the power thereof we have enough forms we've had enough reforms yet the people are not even saved there's a song my sister used to sing jesus is the answer for the world today why won't as brother earnest you say that you know what is it about jesus they don't like what's the matter with him a man who uh or can be touched by the feeling of your infirmity a man that came only to do that which was right and good yet they didn't want to have nothing to do with it they want to barabbas they wanted to kill somebody that had no sin and there still is a situation even today let me talk a little bit for our clothes in first samuel your day of battle is here wait no longer you are right in the midst of it who knew that this day will come like this that left us in a crisis life has never been on earth in a long time be just saying in a hundred years as we have had disaster before the hugo and uh you know the storms and all kind of other uh disease that that ever hit you know but never like this country in a recession we know that we're living off of borrowed money yet they are giving out trillions nobody even asking the question well where is it coming from they're just enjoying the stimulus but there is something behind it we're really going to feel the effect and we are gonna uh have to deal with what is gonna happen here on this earth i was telling the family of the night that we were saying one time about this world system that has been orchestrated set up by the devil himself i'm not calling no man or the devil but satan himself if you notice in the bible when he took jesus on this high temple he told him that all this i'll give you he showed him all the kingdoms of the world and he was tipped into i'll give it to you if you would just only bow down and worship me so he is the mastermind behind this system he is the mastermind behind what you see going on see because from the very beginning he already has said that how he was going to exalt his throne above the most high god in other words he was going to be a god and he has anointed people that have took on this very image that we can create we don't even know whether there is a god where is the act and they begin to boast that we are the gods we are the intelligent people of this earth that's why we can control it like we are failing to realize that's the same spirit that was on lucifer i will exalt my throne i will be like the most high god i or i not even know that god is the only creator without god you can't do nothing that's why it behooves you and i i was just saying the night too that you know i believe that what we uh uh have done is we have been looking somewhere else and still looking to the real source we've been going to church and we've been hearing good sermons and we have some of the best preachers ever there is in the world nowadays i was telling somebody that we pretty much were have done preach preach preach out and the harder we preach the worse of the people lives get we got more churches than anything we got more preachers than anything but then where is deliverance where is god at surely if that if we are preaching what jesus preached surely the word jesus preached people got delivered but look at us churches have failed because they can't produce the real god they've sent them to the seminary and they've got big degrees and no lord have earth they are more eloquent than ever better bible students than we ever had before but look what it is producing it's only giving the people a false security they are not getting to the real source door they go into a building structure but that's not the real source the servant of god said i i believe he believed what happened was that we getting them to come to church that's good but we are not getting them to jesus christ i believe sometime that we need to back up i believe that even as ministers we have to re-examine ourselves and take note of the people lies and let's be honest with ourselves are the people really getting the substance that they need from god or their life being really converted or are they being reformed god's not looking for reformers god look for transformers he wants to transform your life he wants to root out that old nature that we've been born with and give you a nature like his until the church until the preachers come back to that kind of gospel we only gonna have reforms we have rehabilitation centers like they have in the natural we rehabilitate they do good for a season they do good they get dry for a couple of months i heard they make they confess you know i've been driving down for so many months that's good but have you got anything in you because the bible said when that spirit leaves for a season he comes back and says oh this my house i used to live in see it's good to get dried out but you got to get something in you something that's gonna keep you even when that spirit tried to come back he recognized somebody else living in my house now and it got to be the holy ghost let's not i've been saying let's not fool ourselves let's stop playing church let's stop acting like we got it let's be honest and say lord here am i i thought i had this lord but i want to be certain of god i don't want to just wonder about it i don't want to feel like it but i want to know that you are here you've got to know david i'm reminded i'm closing david when he was fighting getting ready to go to battle with goliath and he heard that philistine make a statement against god's people david couldn't take that sup mean david start bubbling i can understand you know when you hear the devil boasting what he gonna do you ain't gonna make it and you're gonna die and making these bold statements david said you mean to tell me you let this uncircumcised philistine defile the armies of god david said no no no no i can't take this david say let me fight him daddy was a little rudy little boy didn't look like nothing he was a giant nine foot that giant could have picked david up with one of his through his finger shoot kill him but david giant i like in uh you say durham daddy was not afraid david didn't look at the size of the giant david said i'm gonna take your head off oh what what kind of faith david had see that's real faith saying david just had faith because david had had experiences on the backside of the mountain that's what we need we need people that had experience with god trained by the holy ghost david kept the sheep and david knew that he was responsible for those sheep and they would say no that would bear come and took him david said i went out and i slew him so when david saw this giant himself here's another bear a god that did this god can take him too that god that destroyed those devils in your life 10 15 years ago is the same god that's with you tonight that sickness you had you know i said you had because it got to go when you understand who you are the problem i believe to serve god's saying that what happened is that people haven't had an experience yet seeker your experience gives you faith and they say it put hair on your chest it makes your muscles come on when things happen you say oh another devil you say i saw you somewhere else too but you read another phone but i'm gonna take your head off david on brothers had no confidence in him saul tried to put all kind of ecclesiastical things on david you know a shield and david said come on so i can't fight like this come on david laid aside every week you can't fight the devil with sin in your life you got to lay aside every week then you ready to fight goliath david stood there and that goliath made his voice and david just sat there listening to him and david had those five smooth stones in his bag oh church what is in your bag what is in your heart see the word got to be in us because we are in the day of battle you've been giving the most powerful thing that god ever could give his soldiers and that's the revealed word for your hour no ecclesiastical denominational word can stand up against goliath you need a supernatural word you need more than just uh or educational standards and morals teaching that they're teaching these largest you need the voice of god pray tonight as we close arm yourself with the word telling the saints there nothing else you do is going to be able to stand against the wiles of the devil but the word take the word by faith cut your way through cut that depressing demon cut that nicotine and uh draw a demon away from you i challenge you tonight take the word apply it to your life and watch what god will do don't be afraid don't faint because you outnumbered don't think because the giant might be nine foot tall don't look at the size of the giant look at the word that god gave you god bless you tonight [Music] that is not yours but it's the lord amen we thank the lord for the word tonight amen because the battle is being fought within our minds the greatest battle ever fought was fought within our minds but he said let this mind be in you that was also in christ amen who thought it not robbery to be equal with god made of himself no reputation same god that did it for david and did it for the sex of old the same god do it for you hebrews 13 8 of jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever so he's the same god amen if we got the same faith the same faith that the woman used with the issue of blood she didn't have a scripture for what she said she just said if i can just touch to him of his garment amen she spoke amen she spoke a healing into existence amen when we get a revelation and something that will get down in our hearts amen that we get desperate enough and god will speak to give us inspiration and inspire us they meant to say something that would move god they meant that god knows they meant that we'll share the right word praise god just like how to write you said the right word and we can set the right word we can see god move for us but we got to get in the spirit we got to get in the spirit and get back doctrine lord i know you can help me all i got to lose touch you got to know it's god that can't be touched but a feeling of unfortunate he's god and he can touch it just like he touched that woman he said who touched me amen so the word the battle is not yours but it's the lord that's my hands father we thank you for the word tonight thank you for our brother palmer lord father i pray you bless your people that are listening and these are here what helped them to realize amen they don't have to fight the battle you already fought for us well god we got to stand fast in the faith that was once delivered to the saints let us hold fast to your word god and trust that you've already defeated everything in every devil every situation every sickness the other infirmity the lord and your people will grab ahold of faith and declare with your strikes we have the victory with your spirits will be healed we have the victory all right lord you defeated every devil every demon and god we go forth and faith claim in the picture right now oh yes lord victory is mine i got it god i got the picture for my whole victory for my family right now in jesus name lord let us lay hold on lord we thank you today lord god we thank you for these that are together thank you for those that are listening may you bless every heart but we are trusting you now in jesus wonderful name amen the bible says repent be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ what a remission of sin you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost the promise is unto you to your children tell them that are fall even as many as the lord i haven't got you called thank god for you [Music] thank god for sister david amen appreciate all of you amen i know it's working amen faith give us a song tonight since
