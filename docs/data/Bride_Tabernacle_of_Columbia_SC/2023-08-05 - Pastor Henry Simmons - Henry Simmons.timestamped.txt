[29:38] God you can speak to the needs of your
[29:42] people
[29:43] in Jesus name we pray
[29:45] amen
[29:48] the book of Exodus the third chapter
[29:51] again we thank God for each and every
[29:53] one of you that came out we are glad for
[29:56] our visiting friends we do welcome you
[29:58] tonight in Jesus Christ's name Glad You
[30:01] Came trusted you'll be a blessing
[30:05] for you to be here amen
[30:08] amen be those that are listening to him
[30:10] we thank God for you listening in in
[30:12] Jesus Christ's name
[30:14] so Genesis I mean Exodus 3 and 14. I'm
[30:19] just gonna
[30:20] cut it short and just go straight to the
[30:22] verse and God said unto Moses
[30:25] I am that I am
[30:28] and
[30:29] he said
[30:31] thus shall thou say unto the children of
[30:35] Israel I am
[30:37] has sent me unto you
[30:41] may God bless the reason word you may be
[30:43] seated
[30:47] he said I am
[30:50] has sent me unto you
[30:54] he knew that
[30:56] the children of Israel would have a
[30:58] difficult time receiving Moses
[31:02] and the message that Moses had
[31:06] was one that
[31:10] one that the people were crying and
[31:13] pleading to God to deliver them because
[31:16] they had been in bondage for over 400
[31:19] years
[31:20] in captivity and in bondage as slaves in
[31:23] the Egypt
[31:26] and they cried to the Lord
[31:29] and God
[31:31] raised up a Prophet by the name of Moses
[31:34] when he was born it was a decree to kill
[31:38] all the male children
[31:41] and I believe that
[31:42] the devil has a decree
[31:45] in this generation in this day
[31:49] yeah we find that
[31:51] the males are getting thin
[31:55] and the devil is trying to kill them off
[32:00] so by the grace of God and sometimes
[32:03] just wonder who can find a good man
[32:06] because there's not many to be found
[32:09] so the devil has a decree not to kill
[32:12] all the male children because
[32:15] they thought that if they're male
[32:18] children would be a threat
[32:21] until
[32:23] the Egyptian Empire
[32:26] so they wanted to kill him
[32:28] and as a Christian's
[32:31] if you see a Christian walking
[32:34] today
[32:35] the devil you are a threat to Satan
[32:38] Kingdom
[32:40] whether you're male or female you are a
[32:42] threat to the kingdom of darkness
[32:46] so God chose you
[32:49] to be lights in the world
[32:52] in the midst of a dog evil
[32:55] world
[32:57] the Bible tells us in Isaiah 60 gross
[33:01] Darkness should cover the Earth
[33:03] and we realize that gross Darkness has
[33:06] covered the Earth
[33:08] the Bible tells us in the last days
[33:10] prayerless times should come
[33:12] for men to be lovers of pleasure lovers
[33:15] of themselves more than lovers of God
[33:18] so we're living in a A Dangerous Time
[33:20] perilous time dangerous amen it's danger
[33:24] to just go out your house it's dangerous
[33:27] just to go to school dangers all around
[33:30] us
[33:31] so we are living in a time where amen
[33:34] the world has gone mad
[33:37] you don't know when the next mass murder
[33:40] you don't know what's going to happen
[33:43] from day to day
[33:46] so
[33:47] by the grace of God
[33:50] in the midst of
[33:52] uncertainty
[33:55] and insecurity
[33:58] we must find a safe place
[34:00] that we feel safe and secure
[34:04] and there's only one place that we can
[34:06] find that we can feel safe
[34:08] and we can feel secure
[34:10] it's only one place that I know of
[34:13] and that's in the Lord Jesus Christ
[34:16] without him
[34:19] somebody said I'll be like a ship
[34:21] without a sale
[34:23] I'll be drifting
[34:25] like a ship
[34:27] without a sale
[34:30] life
[34:32] has its many problems
[34:34] but
[34:36] to every problem
[34:38] there's an answer
[34:40] and Jesus is dead
[34:43] if we only
[34:45] allow him to have the preeminence in our
[34:48] lives
[34:50] so tonight
[34:55] I thought
[34:57] I just talk about I am I had prepared
[35:01] this to speak when I was in Florida
[35:05] a week before last and
[35:08] I went another Direction
[35:10] and I said I talked to the church maybe
[35:13] I am that I am
[35:17] see
[35:19] it's many times we know God that was and
[35:23] a lot of a lot of people have confidence
[35:25] in the God that was because they heard
[35:28] about
[35:30] what he was and who he was
[35:34] and they know about the God of the
[35:37] future that's supposed to be coming back
[35:40] to receive his people
[35:43] but the present tense that I am
[35:47] refined many
[35:51] don't know that God
[35:54] so he says the present tense God as I am
[35:58] that I am
[36:00] in Hebrews 13 8 said Jesus Christ
[36:03] is the same yesterday
[36:06] and today
[36:07] and forever
[36:10] so we're not
[36:12] we're
[36:13] we have to bring God up out of history
[36:15] and bring him to present tense
[36:18] so he says he's the same God today
[36:23] and if he is the same God today then
[36:25] where is he
[36:28] where can I find that God
[36:31] I hope you know where to find him
[36:37] because if you look up in heaven
[36:40] and you think that he's there
[36:47] you look around and you said swear to
[36:49] God
[36:52] Jesus said
[36:54] let not your heart be troubled
[36:58] don't you be afraid
[37:00] let out your heart be trouble if you
[37:02] believe in God believe also in me amen
[37:05] for in my father's Kingdom if my
[37:07] father's house of many mansions
[37:10] if it were not so I would have told you
[37:13] he said I go away to prepare a place for
[37:15] you than where I am there you may be
[37:17] also
[37:18] and whether I go you know in the way you
[37:21] know Thomas said Lord we know not
[37:23] whether or not Gordon how can we know
[37:24] the way
[37:26] Jesus said I am
[37:29] there it is again I am what
[37:32] I am the way
[37:35] amen there's no other way outside of
[37:38] Jesus I don't care if they say this is
[37:41] the way that's the way but Jesus said I
[37:44] am the way
[37:48] because if you trust in anything other
[37:50] than Jesus Christ it won't help you
[37:53] the preacher is not the way the church
[37:56] is not the way
[37:57] but Jesus said I am the way
[38:00] the truth in the life no man can come to
[38:03] the father except he come
[38:05] by me
[38:07] if we want God then we got to come by
[38:10] Jesus he said I'm the door by me if any
[38:14] man enter
[38:16] he can go in and out and find pasture
[38:19] so if the way is Jesus Christ I am
[38:24] the way
[38:26] so if we were looking for him
[38:30] where can I find him today
[38:33] because people are looking for God but
[38:36] they don't know where to find him and
[38:38] many people go to church looking for God
[38:40] they're hoping to find God sometimes
[38:43] they get a pacify
[38:46] sometimes they're not they don't get the
[38:48] real thing they get a pacifier and
[38:50] sometimes it soothes them for a season
[38:53] in a while
[38:54] but they find out the pacifier would
[38:57] never uh quench The Thirst
[38:59] that the soul has
[39:03] so they began to search again and then
[39:07] somebody else gives them another
[39:08] pacifier
[39:11] and they was getting to suck on that
[39:13] pacified thinking that I have something
[39:15] that's real
[39:17] but they find that the hunger and thirst
[39:21] is still there
[39:23] so I'm still searching for that God
[39:26] that's real
[39:29] the God that I need I'm searching for
[39:32] him
[39:33] that's who I need
[39:35] I don't need a pacifier I need God
[39:41] let people come to the church
[39:44] sometimes they will come to listen to
[39:46] the music Sometimes they come to listen
[39:48] to sing and sometimes they listen for
[39:51] something just should make it through
[39:54] another day another week
[39:57] give me some words of encouragement just
[40:00] something to give me some consolation

[40:42] want help from our distress and from our
[40:45] perplexities we want help to uh for our
[40:49] problems and and we want somebody to
[40:52] help us because we have needs we want
[40:54] our needs Supply but dude I want God
[40:58] because our needs become another need
[41:01] later
[41:04] the troubles that we have in life it's
[41:06] going to come
[41:11] you're going to go through trouble times
[41:13] you're going to go through difficult
[41:14] times it I mean it may
[41:21] the sun might shine but the rain comes
[41:23] sometime
[41:24] the storms of life come come

[41:52] I want this God I want to meet him
[41:55] where is he
[41:58] so Moses come down to
[42:00] each
[42:04] because they've been praying 400 years
[42:06] they they prayed and things was getting
[42:09] tough and it's getting dark outside how
[42:11] many of you believe it's getting dark
[42:12] outside in this world
[42:15] trouble
[42:17] praise God
[42:19] can
[42:20] the political Circle can they solve the
[42:23] problems
[42:25] can the church be the answer to our
[42:27] problems
[42:29] well this is what God did
[42:32] the Bible said the name is three and
[42:34] seven surely the Lord God would do
[42:35] nothing
[42:36] but he Reveals His secrets to his
[42:38] serving the prophet
[42:41] are you with me
[42:43] before God can do any major thing God
[42:46] always sends a prophet
[42:49] in the days of Noah God sent Noah a
[42:54] prophet to mourn the people
[42:56] and the Bible says in Luke as it was in
[42:59] the days of Noah and as it was in the
[43:01] days of Sodom
[43:02] God shall it be in the day when the son
[43:04] of man is revealed
[43:06] before Jesus came the first time
[43:09] he always sinned warning before judgment
[43:12] before he can introduce a major
[43:14] happening in the earth he sends John the
[43:17] Baptist a prophet
[43:18] he said repent and father what the
[43:21] Kingdom of Heaven is what
[43:23] he let you know what he was doing
[43:26] present tense
[43:28] amen not it was back in Isaiah said the
[43:32] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[43:34] said Isaiah the prophet but that voice
[43:37] was prophecy but when prophecy is being
[43:40] fulfilled it seems like it passed
[43:42] through and over the hands of people
[43:45] because when it becomes I am people say
[43:48] where is it
[43:51] amen so God is unrecognized so many
[43:54] times amen when he is he met people
[43:58] wondered who is this
[44:02] who is he
[44:05] because uh the god that I've been taught
[44:10] about
[44:11] and has been preached to me
[44:14] I thought I thought he was going to be a
[44:16] Pharisee and the sad you see that said I
[44:19] thought he was going to be a sign you
[44:20] see any herodian said uh oh a Samaritan
[44:24] oh what did you think
[44:28] so
[44:30] Jesus asked his disciples after he's
[44:33] been with them and they had experienced
[44:35] a supernatural said who the men say that
[44:38] I the son of man am
[44:53] who do you say
[44:57] who do you say I am
[45:00] see ya nah okay he was bringing you back
[45:04] tonight I am who do you say I am
[45:08] are you a man
[45:09] and Simon Peter has to say thou art the
[45:12] Christ the son of the Living God he said
[45:14] blessed that thou Simon vagina
[45:17] for flesh and blood has not revealed
[45:20] this unto thee but my Father which is in
[45:22] heaven and he said Upon This Rock
[45:26] upon the revelation of who I am I'll
[45:30] build my church
[45:32] Upon This Rock I've been my church and
[45:35] the gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[45:38] against us
[45:39] once you get a revelation of where who
[45:42] God is then the Gates of Hell shall not
[45:45] Prevail against it
[45:46] the reason why people amen act the way
[45:49] they act and live the way they live
[45:50] because they don't know who he is
[45:53] but if you ever find him
[45:56] praise God I heard somebody said never
[45:59] heard a man speak like this man
[46:02] amen once you come to know Jesus praise
[46:06] God nothing else can satisfy you
[46:10] praise God I was telling some people
[46:12] that were drinking and drugging and I
[46:14] says praise God what's the problem is
[46:17] you never taste this wine
[46:19] praise God you can get drunk off that
[46:21] other one watch you taste this wine you
[46:23] don't want that one no more
[46:25] praise God you never even experienced
[46:28] this God
[46:29] but if you experience this God you'll
[46:32] find out nothing can
[46:35] come close
[46:37] can't nobody
[46:39] somebody said can't nobody
[46:41] Do Me Like Jesus
[46:43] amen
[46:45] praise God
[46:47] and I I believe amen it's the Revelation
[46:52] that you must understand amen that God
[46:55] reveals himself to whom he will he said
[46:59] no man has come unto uh the father and
[47:03] no man have come to me except the father
[47:05] drawing
[47:06] he said you've not chosen me but I've
[47:09] chosen you and I've ordained you that
[47:12] you should go forth and bring forth
[47:14] fruit and that your fruit should remain
[47:17] so God chooses us
[47:20] amen praise God so what oh Hallelujah it
[47:24] takes God to come down and reveal
[47:26] himself to you as an individual
[47:33] I am sent you
[47:36] yeah
[47:38] oh can't you imagine
[47:40] somebody coming
[47:42] and saying
[47:44] God sent me to you
[47:48] and God told me to tell you
[47:53] that you need to give your life to Jesus
[47:59] you're having trouble you're having
[48:00] problems you're having difficulties
[48:02] you're going through things
[48:05] but God told me to tell you
[48:10] God sent me to you
[48:14] and he said
[48:18] it wasn't important who I am
[48:21] I'm not important
[48:25] but I want you to know who sent me to
[48:27] tell you
[48:31] see sometimes people get mixed up it was
[48:34] the flesh that hid God that people
[48:37] didn't know who Jesus was the Bible said
[48:40] he was in the world the world was made
[48:41] by him but the world did not know who he
[48:44] was
[48:47] but the Bible said in the beginning what
[48:49] the word the word was with God and the
[48:51] Word was God but when the word was made
[48:53] flesh it dwells Among Us
[48:56] are you with me and when they saw the
[48:59] flesh they could not see God because the
[49:01] flesh covered God
[49:03] it looked like a man but God was in the
[49:06] man the witness God was in Christ to
[49:08] reconcile the world to himself
[49:10] even though God was in in a veil amen
[49:13] they couldn't see God because they
[49:16] recognized him as a man and they
[49:18] couldn't receive him because he was a
[49:19] man
[49:22] so he
[49:24] he had trouble so do we have trouble
[49:26] today
[49:28] we come amen with the word from the Lord
[49:31] to tell the people that Jesus loves them
[49:34] and Jesus died for their sin but they
[49:36] don't want the Jesus that died for their
[49:38] sin to deliver them out of their chaos
[49:40] and out of their trouble and out of the
[49:45] the things that their lives would have
[49:48] to go through amen without God on their
[49:50] side
[49:53] you come to him and you tell them that
[49:56] you need God
[49:58] and they said they're not looking at God
[50:00] what your message that you're giving
[50:02] them they're looking at the veil that's
[50:04] giving them the message
[50:07] oftentimes they're not looking at
[50:10] he said the watch that I do it's not me
[50:14] that's doing the work it's the father
[50:16] that was in me he's the one that's doing
[50:19] the word
[50:20] you really tell me about looking for God
[50:22] you tell me he's in Christ
[50:24] yes he is in Christ
[50:27] but that same God
[50:30] that was in Christ that people had
[50:31] trouble believing that he was
[50:36] Jesus said I am the light of the world
[50:39] isn't that right if you want to know who
[50:42] I am he said I am the light of the world
[50:44] but he said men love Darkness rather
[50:47] than life because they're what
[50:49] the Deeds are evil
[50:52] people can't seem to grasp God
[50:56] amen when God is speaking to him amen
[50:59] they're too busy looking at the Flesh of
[51:01] the man
[51:04] until they can't hear the message that
[51:06] God sent to them as individuals
[51:09] and God sent you messages as individuals
[51:13] I begin to speak to your heart
[51:15] I was telling somebody simplifying you
[51:18] know some of the things that they heard
[51:20] when the preacher was preaching on
[51:22] Sunday
[51:22] and I said I'm going to simplify it
[51:25] I said
[51:28] you know
[51:30] the voice that tells you
[51:33] all of your life don't do this
[51:37] and you do it anyway
[51:39] and it's a voice it says
[51:42] do it
[51:43] and you know it's wrong
[51:47] I see you how do you know when God's
[51:49] speaking to you
[51:51] I said to God when the God is speaking
[51:53] to you he tells you to do the right
[51:55] thing
[51:56] but when the devil is speaking to you he
[51:59] tells you to do the wrong thing
[52:01] I said it's just like the red light the
[52:03] red light says Scott
[52:06] and when the real lights just stop and
[52:09] you don't stop
[52:10] you know one day after a while the red
[52:15] light become the green light
[52:17] are you with me
[52:19] so they
[52:21] that Wicked one the evil one that you
[52:24] listen to
[52:26] instead of listening to the right one
[52:29] you listen to the evil one
[52:32] that told you to do the wrong thing
[52:34] then you believe that the evil one
[52:38] is the one that you ought to obey
[52:41] he becomes your master
[52:44] he becomes your God
[52:47] for he says of Our Gospel to hear this
[52:50] hit to them that are lost
[52:51] whom the God of this world has blinded
[52:54] the mind of them that believe not
[52:56] at least the light of the Glorious
[52:57] gospel who is the image of God to shine
[53:01] into them
[53:02] are you with me
[53:04] so once they began to look and run the
[53:08] light so much
[53:11] they began to get a strong delusion
[53:15] until they think that's right is wrong
[53:19] and wrong is right
[53:22] so you see how far people go
[53:25] they do things that
[53:28] and you can't tell him if you told them
[53:31] that this is wrong to do they say you
[53:34] don't have love
[53:38] because we ought to love Rome
[53:42] we love the individual but if we don't
[53:44] love the sin
[53:46] are you with me
[53:48] God have mercy on the individual but God
[53:52] has to call Sin Sin
[53:55] are you
[53:56] and because we love you we tell you the
[53:59] what tell you the truth
[54:01] but people don't want to
[54:03] it's not a thing that's wrong or right
[54:07] you just do what you feel in your heart
[54:10] to do is right
[54:13] Jeremiah's a heart is deceitful above
[54:16] all things and desperately a wicked who
[54:19] knows God
[54:21] are you with me
[54:23] praise God
[54:25] oh God I gotta close
[54:28] I don't want to be too long
[54:30] but I am that I am
[54:33] I am that I am
[54:35] where is it I'm looking for so when it
[54:39] came down
[54:41] I am come down to deliver them don't you
[54:44] know that I am came down to deliver them
[54:46] and they saw Moses
[54:50] are you with me
[54:51] and when they saw Moses
[54:55] they saw mine but I am
[54:58] they didn't know the god that sent Moses
[55:01] god in Moses
[55:02] are you with me that Jesus that said I
[55:06] go and prepare a place for you he said I
[55:08] won't leave your confidence but I'm
[55:10] gonna come again and I'm gonna receive
[55:12] you to myself
[55:13] he said I'm with you but I shall be in
[55:15] you
[55:16] and great is he that swear
[55:19] in you than he that's
[55:21] in the world isn't that right so the God
[55:24] Amen the Savior amen praise God when he
[55:28] comes into your life
[55:30] praise God he's there in the form of the
[55:33] Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost amen doing
[55:36] what to let you shine reflect his
[55:41] attributes
[55:43] until a Dying World so your life ought
[55:46] to be a real reflection of Jesus Christ
[55:50] in the Earth today
[55:52] how he lived how he walked how he talked
[55:54] then you become he became
[55:58] sin
[56:00] in second Corinthians 5 21 he became sin
[56:04] for us
[56:06] that we might become
[56:08] the righteousness of God in him so what
[56:11] he does he takes on your sin
[56:14] and he gives you his righteousness
[56:18] amen
[56:19] but if you don't want
[56:22] somebody said he took away my old filthy
[56:24] garment
[56:25] and gave me a robe of your life
[56:28] are you with me so God takes away amen
[56:31] praise God all your sins and all you
[56:35] ever done and he laid it on Jesus
[56:39] on the cross
[56:42] somebody said at the cross at the cross
[56:44] where I first saw the light and the
[56:46] burdens of my heart rolled away it was
[56:49] of our faith I received my
[56:51] and now I'm happy all today
[56:54] you're the reason why we have sad people
[56:56] because they have not come to see what
[56:59] Jesus did for them on the cross
[57:01] reason why we have trouble people
[57:03] because they go to church amen but they
[57:06] don't know the value of the cross
[57:09] they don't know what the blood of Jesus
[57:11] has done for them
[57:13] has washed away your sins he has
[57:17] forgiven you
[57:18] and he's given you eternal life if you
[57:21] want it
[57:22] have you received him
[57:24] praise God hallelujah it's yours
[57:27] amen you don't have to beg for it all
[57:29] you got to do is
[57:30] receive
[57:32] D amen
[57:35] he's already paid in the debt he already
[57:38] paid the price all you got to do is to
[57:40] receive Jesus Christ
[57:44] is that easy
[57:46] praise God we couldn't do nothing to get
[57:47] ourselves to save ourselves
[57:51] so God comes down to a people
[57:54] a people that's troubled people that
[57:58] it's no way
[58:00] they was going to get out of their
[58:02] troubles their chaos the chains and the
[58:06] whips and the beating that they were
[58:07] going through no way for them to get out
[58:11] but I am God
[58:13] that I am
[58:15] praise God in this dark generation in
[58:19] this dark day
[58:21] God does the same thing
[58:24] at evening time it shall be light
[58:27] God shines a light
[58:30] Jesus came at midnight
[58:32] of the Jewish dispensation
[58:35] and at midnight
[58:37] Jesus came at their midnight just before
[58:41] God turned the lights out
[58:44] on the Jews and move to the Gentiles the
[58:47] midnight Jesus came in the middle of the
[58:51] book and stepped down on the scene
[58:54] and said I'm the lights
[58:56] in such a dark time of religious
[58:58] confusion
[58:59] but I am the lion
[59:01] I believe we in amen a deeper Darkness
[59:06] of the Gentiles dispensation and God is
[59:08] getting ready to turn back to Israel
[59:11] are you with me
[59:12] and when flow God turns back to Israel
[59:15] God sends amen of Moses in our day and
[59:18] sent a prophet on the scene to tell us
[59:21] get back to God
[59:23] get back to the word
[59:25] amen
[59:27] and he leads us back to the book
[59:29] that's been sealed to the time of the
[59:31] end
[59:32] the book The
[59:34] Shield book
[59:36] you told Daniel set up the book to the
[59:38] time of the end
[59:40] he told uh uh John amen seal of the book
[59:45] he said I heard seven Thunders out of
[59:47] their voices and I was about to write
[59:49] and he said seal the book
[59:52] but in the days of the voice of the
[59:54] seven Angel when he shall begin to sound
[59:56] then the mysteries of God shall be
[59:58] finished
[59:59] there Comes A Time to see a book becomes
[1:00:01] an open book
[1:00:03] are you a man the Bible amen the sincere
[1:00:07] becomes open
[1:00:09] power began to break the seals off the
[1:00:11] Old Testament and began to tell them
[1:00:14] amen that what's in touch and shadows in
[1:00:18] time past has become reality in Jesus
[1:00:20] Christ
[1:00:22] are you a man the one they met the Lamb
[1:00:25] of the Old Testament we don't need that
[1:00:27] anymore work out the Lamb of God to come
[1:00:29] to take away the sins of the world so
[1:00:31] all that you've been doing back there
[1:00:33] won't do now
[1:00:34] you got to recognize the true Lamb of
[1:00:36] God and that's Jesus Christ
[1:00:39] are you a man so at the end of the
[1:00:42] church dispensation God comes back again
[1:00:44] and reveals himself in the word
[1:00:47] and tell us again
[1:00:49] get away from your thoughts and ideas
[1:00:52] come back to the Bible
[1:00:55] amen
[1:00:58] you know we listen to the voice of the
[1:01:00] church and the preacher more than we
[1:01:01] listen to the voice of the word
[1:01:05] what the Bible says it means nothing to
[1:01:09] most folks
[1:01:10] the Bible the word of God
[1:01:12] means nothing
[1:01:15] they don't value it
[1:01:17] you show people what the Bible says but
[1:01:19] they said but my church says but my
[1:01:22] preacher says but this is the way I see
[1:01:25] it
[1:01:25] oh Lord
[1:01:27] does the bible mean anything
[1:01:31] yeah I believe the Bible but
[1:01:35] um
[1:01:36] you believe the Bible that's our
[1:01:38] absolute
[1:01:40] the word of God man should not live by
[1:01:43] bread alone but by what
[1:01:45] every word that proceeded out of the
[1:01:47] what my for God if you want to see God
[1:01:50] God is revealed in his word
[1:01:53] amen and if you want to see God the
[1:01:55] comforter is the holy spirit Holy Ghost
[1:01:58] and it comes down in you
[1:02:01] God should be in his people he should be
[1:02:04] there but we got a lot of what
[1:02:08] we got a lot of impersonators of
[1:02:10] Christianity
[1:02:13] a lot of people say they are Christians
[1:02:17] a lot of people say I am saved
[1:02:24] I am saved to sin not saved from sin
[1:02:32] are you with me
[1:02:34] because all have sinned have sinned not
[1:02:37] still sinning
[1:02:40] and come short of the glory of God
[1:02:42] amen but God glory has come
[1:02:45] and because his glory has come praise
[1:02:48] God he said my little children are
[1:02:49] writing to you that you what sin not but
[1:02:52] if any man sin he has a what Advocate
[1:02:55] with the father Jesus Christ the
[1:02:57] righteous he's the perpetuation for our
[1:02:59] sins are not for hours only but for the
