[30:13] just pray that it'd be a blessing
[30:20] matthew 27 we got it saved man
[30:26] we'll begin at the 27th verse
[30:31] and it reads then the soldiers
[30:34] of the governor took jesus into the
[30:37] common hall
[30:38] and gathered unto him the whole man of
[30:40] soldiers and they stripped him
[30:42] and they put on him a scarlet robe you
[30:44] may be seated
[30:46] continue reading and when they had
[30:48] plated a crown
[30:50] of thorns they put it on his head
[30:53] and a reed in his right hand and they
[30:56] bowed the knee
[30:57] before him and mocked him saying
[31:00] hell king of the jews and they spit on
[31:03] him spit upon him
[31:04] and took the reed and smote him on the
[31:06] head and after that
[31:08] they had mocked him they took the robe
[31:11] off him
[31:12] from off off from him and put
[31:15] his own raymond on him and led him away
[31:18] to crucify him
[31:20] and as they came out they found a man of
[31:22] siren simon
[31:23] by name him they compelled to bear his
[31:26] cross
[31:27] and when they were coming to a place
[31:30] called golgotha
[31:31] that is to say a place of a skull they
[31:34] gave him vinegar
[31:35] to drink mingled with gall and when he
[31:38] had test
[31:39] tasted thereof he would not drink
[31:42] and they crucified him and parted his
[31:45] garments casting
[31:46] lots that it might be fulfilled which
[31:48] was spoken by the prophet
[31:50] they parted my garments among them and
[31:52] upon my vested they cast lots
[31:55] and sitting down they watched him there
[31:57] and set
[31:58] up over his head his accusation written
[32:02] this is jesus king of the jews
[32:05] then were there are two thieves
[32:07] crucified with him one on the right hand
[32:09] and one on the left
[32:11] on and another on the left and they
[32:14] passed
[32:14] and they that passed by reviled him
[32:16] wagging their heads and saying
[32:18] thou has thou that destroys the temple
[32:21] and builds
[32:22] it in three days save thyself if thou
[32:25] be the son of god come down from the
[32:27] cross
[32:28] likewise also the chief priests mocking
[32:31] him
[32:32] and scribes and elders said he saved
[32:35] others
[32:36] himself he cannot save if he be the king
[32:39] if he be the king of israel let him now
[32:43] come down from the cross
[32:44] he will and we will believe him he
[32:47] trusted in god
[32:48] let him deliver him now if he will have
[32:51] him
[32:52] for he said i am the son of god the
[32:54] thieves also which were crucified with
[32:56] him
[32:57] cast the same in his teeth
[33:00] may god had a blessed reading of his
[33:02] word and just we'll just
[33:04] stop right there tonight but by the
[33:06] grace of god
[33:07] tonight i want to minister and and just
[33:10] for a moment
[33:11] just talk about calvary and
[33:15] what calvary meant what it wrought
[33:18] in our lives you know it's
[33:21] it's a lot of we say it's a lot of great
[33:23] days
[33:24] throughout all world history we can go
[33:26] over a lot of them that things that took
[33:27] place
[33:28] throughout all history but there never
[33:31] was
[33:32] a greater day that we can look to
[33:35] or look back to or to say that
[33:38] ever took place in history like that day
[33:41] on calvary
[33:43] though the majority of the world didn't
[33:45] know what was taking place
[33:48] god was doing something uh great
[33:51] in the earth from where man
[33:54] had fallen and needed
[33:57] a savior needed to be redeemed
[34:00] because of disobedience and him doing
[34:04] what god asked him not to do
[34:05] separated him from god separated him
[34:09] from
[34:10] uh the tree of life where he could eat
[34:12] and live forever
[34:14] and you know sin when sin
[34:17] came about you know it did something
[34:20] like we said to separate us
[34:22] and the only way that we could be
[34:25] united back to god would be by
[34:29] the shedding of blood innocent blood
[34:32] and we know how we had shadows and types
[34:34] of bulls and goats but
[34:36] they could only cover your sin from year
[34:39] to year
[34:40] you know i was saying the other day how
[34:42] you know when
[34:43] when you sin or every year once a year
[34:45] the people would have to bring a lamb
[34:47] or or a dove if you were in a poor class
[34:50] and
[34:50] whatever they bring it up and you know
[34:54] before the priest would slay it they
[34:56] would you would
[34:57] put your hands on it or however they
[34:59] would do it and
[35:01] they would let you know that this
[35:03] innocent subject
[35:05] is dying because of the sins that you
[35:08] committed
[35:09] you were the one that was supposed to be
[35:13] uh paying this penalty but
[35:17] you know god is accepting uh innocent
[35:20] subject to take your place
[35:23] but it could only do it from year to
[35:24] year
[35:26] but it was going to come a time where it
[35:29] would no longer
[35:30] you would have to do it from year to
[35:32] year but god was going to do something
[35:33] great
[35:34] even in himself where he come and give
[35:37] his life
[35:39] for mankind to unite us back with him
[35:43] so as we look at what god done for us
[35:46] it's so many benefits and things that
[35:49] we benefited from calvary that yet we
[35:53] we lack sometimes to to receive the
[35:56] benefits
[35:57] that god has given uh us here at calvary
[36:01] you know i was thinking about a song
[36:03] that i heard once
[36:04] a few years ago and in that song they
[36:07] were saying
[36:07] he took my place and
[36:10] you know it brought tears to my eyes
[36:13] just
[36:14] when you think about you think about
[36:17] how you know we were born in sin
[36:20] we were born into a mess we were born
[36:24] until a nature that desire
[36:27] to please the flesh that desire to
[36:31] to yield or to reach out to the things
[36:33] of the world
[36:34] that was only temporary that would only
[36:37] bring forth death that's how we were
[36:39] born
[36:40] into the world but christ when he died
[36:44] you know and shed his blood i know the
[36:47] prophet god said that that release god
[36:51] how did it release god through the
[36:53] shedding of his blood he says that
[36:55] it's it must go away that if i go away
[36:58] then the comforter he'll come
[37:00] in my name and he says that he'll teach
[37:02] you all things
[37:03] he says that i won't be with you but
[37:06] i'll be in you
[37:07] so what it is calvary done not only did
[37:11] the shedding of the blood
[37:12] uh uh uh take away our sins but it
[37:16] gave us the ability now to all of those
[37:20] who would desire and receive it
[37:23] to be one with god how can you be one
[37:27] with god by this
[37:28] by his spirit by the holy ghost living
[37:30] in you
[37:31] i was sharing i mean coming in you i was
[37:33] sharing with someone the other night
[37:35] i said the thing is i says it's
[37:38] it's you know it's a walk
[37:41] with god that you got to have i said the
[37:44] thing is
[37:45] i said you got to understand that that
[37:48] god ain't asking you
[37:49] to walk it on your own because he took
[37:52] your place
[37:54] he knew that you weren't able to do it
[37:56] so he was going to do something
[37:58] and that no longer would you be asked
[38:02] even to keep the laws in that way but he
[38:05] was gonna do
[38:06] something that he would cause you to
[38:08] walk in his statues
[38:10] and i said that's what you you got to
[38:12] learn
[38:13] yearn for you can't just say that
[38:17] i said the lord is calling you but you
[38:19] you can't just want to just be
[38:21] just come to church and just be church
[38:24] like that i said it might last for so
[38:26] long but you got to come on the other
[38:28] side
[38:29] you got to experience the riches so what
[38:32] calvary brought
[38:33] i said you got to go up to the to the
[38:36] upper room
[38:37] you got to go up to that place and then
[38:40] you'll see what what what what he's
[38:42] saying that two can't walk together
[38:44] except there'll be an agreement
[38:46] you'll see what he's saying about you
[38:49] know
[38:50] uh uh uh born again nature it's no
[38:52] longer that
[38:53] you know those desires and those things
[38:56] god has it did something a
[38:59] transformation
[39:00] as we say is taking place and you know
[39:03] that's what happens that's what lacks a
[39:06] lot of times
[39:07] in individuals lives because they they
[39:10] walk
[39:10] a long time they come to church a long
[39:13] time
[39:14] but they never go over to the other side
[39:16] you know
[39:17] he says that you know if you love god
[39:20] you'll hate the world
[39:21] come on and the things that are in it
[39:23] sometimes we look at our experience
[39:26] and we says you know i says the thing is
[39:29] you know jesus when when they was
[39:31] crucified him
[39:33] jesus even though he was there we could
[39:35] stay in the physical
[39:37] realm with them but yet he was in
[39:38] another place
[39:40] spiritually he can look at them and know
[39:43] that
[39:43] this wasn't a flesh and blood a battle
[39:47] or fight but this was a battle between
[39:50] god and satan
[39:51] he could look at them and say father
[39:54] forgive them
[39:54] because they don't know what they doing
[39:56] even though they looked at him and they
[39:58] says that
[39:59] he saved others but yet he can't save
[40:01] himself
[40:02] but the revelation of it was he didn't
[40:04] come to save himself he could have saved
[40:06] himself
[40:07] but i thank god his whole mission was to
[40:10] come and save you and i
[40:12] his mission was not to come and prove
[40:15] that he was
[40:16] god in that sense but he came on a
[40:17] mission that
[40:19] it's some souls that that's mine they
[40:22] were mine from the beginning
[40:24] come on god he says all the fathers
[40:27] giving me will come i ain't lost one
[40:29] they are mine i come to save them
[40:31] hallelujah so when he hung on that cross
[40:34] they said you say
[40:35] he saved others they mocking him come
[40:37] down he had a mission to save you and i
[40:40] and i thank god that he accomplished the
[40:43] mission
[40:44] to save us now it's up to us
[40:47] to freely receive what god has done
[40:50] hallelujah
[40:53] but i said that day you know god
[40:56] he done some great great things from
[40:58] where sin
[40:59] as we says had had paralyzed the world
[41:03] you know i was sharing with someone and
[41:05] and then they was
[41:06] talking to me the other day about some
[41:07] things was going on with them
[41:09] and they said you know what you think it
[41:11] could be and i says you know
[41:13] god it could be god warning you i said
[41:16] but i
[41:17] i can guarantee you one thing god don't
[41:20] bluff
[41:21] i said the devil bluff the devil will
[41:24] bluff
[41:25] but god won't bluff god said what he
[41:28] said
[41:29] he sent his word and it's going to
[41:30] accomplish what he sent it to do
[41:32] the thing that god intend to do no man
[41:35] can't stop it
[41:37] no man can't put forth hand nor foot
[41:40] unless god allowed
[41:42] god don't bluff i said so when god is
[41:44] calling
[41:45] he to call come on i thought about
[41:48] pharaoh
[41:49] i said i said you know moses those came
[41:51] down
[41:52] you know he might have thought that when
[41:54] moses was speaking
[41:56] the word of the lord him and aaron he
[41:58] might have thought that
[41:59] god was bluffing but god wasn't bluffing
[42:02] he found that out after egypt was
[42:03] destroyed
[42:04] come on i says that you know we got the
[42:08] we got to take guard take it when i say
[42:10] god don't bluff
[42:12] you know he doesn't bluff from either
[42:14] side
[42:15] i looked at it in malachi and how he
[42:18] says that
[42:19] you know my altar is polluted he started
[42:23] talking about the pollution and things
[42:24] on his altar
[42:25] wonder why sometimes you know things
[42:28] ain't happening for us
[42:30] things are lopsided or or you know
[42:33] things are taking place
[42:35] but let's stop for a moment and examine
[42:37] ourselves
[42:39] examine your walk come on god or open
[42:42] the gates of
[42:44] windows of heaven and pour out blessings
[42:46] but
[42:47] when we do things to separate ourselves
[42:49] from him because he promised
[42:51] that he said i'll never leave you nor
[42:54] forsake you
[42:55] but when we backslide in our spirit
[42:59] come on and walk away from him maybe he
[43:02] stops the windows of heaven come on but
[43:05] yet
[43:06] when we reunite back up with him it's
[43:08] nobody else's fault but your own come on
[43:11] reunite back up with him say lord that's
[43:14] why i was
[43:15] sharing with the person the other night
[43:17] i said
[43:18] you get down on your knees don't blame
[43:20] nobody else
[43:21] say lord it's me i said tell god you
[43:23] need his help
[43:25] tell god god i need your help
[43:28] lord i can't make it without you i say
[43:31] if you don't know how to pray just just
[43:33] tell god how much you need him tell god
[43:36] how much you need his help
[43:38] and i said he wants to help you you know
[43:41] he liking us to be lambs
[43:43] some creatures that have no kind of
[43:46] defense
[43:47] about themselves but they need a
[43:48] shepherd they need somebody to lead them
[43:51] and god knows that we helpless a lot of
[43:54] times we think that
[43:55] we can handle situations and do things
[43:58] on our own but god knows all he sets
[44:00] back
[44:01] sometimes and he waits because he knows
[44:03] that we can't do nothing
[44:04] without him but to recognize
[44:08] that and to recognize that i can't do
[44:10] nothing without you lord
[44:12] and god you did everything for me god
[44:15] the way it's already been made you know
[44:17] i was reading the other day of
[44:19] uh uh quoting from isaiah 53
[44:22] you know and and just how god he handled
[44:26] every situation he settled every quest
[44:30] he on calvary he handled everything come
[44:33] on
[44:33] all of everything from every aspect
[44:36] god handle it all we got to do is freely
[44:39] receive it
[44:40] but you got to want it how many want it
[44:42] tonight
[44:43] but i says the thing is you know looking
[44:46] at
[44:48] looking at what god done for us
[44:51] how he settled the same question
[44:54] come on forever how god
[44:58] done that here on calvary i said look at
[45:00] what they
[45:01] done to him but he did it all he did it
[45:04] all
[45:05] because uh he did it all to take our
[45:08] place
[45:09] now to the world that's nonsense
[45:12] sometimes you try to explain to people
[45:16] uh uh that that they don't understand
[45:19] where you are what you're saying come on
[45:22] they think it's nonsense no man
[45:24] could live a certain way and true that
[45:27] no man can't
[45:28] but the holy ghost come on
[45:31] he's all in all when he comes down in
[45:35] you
[45:36] takes complete control lives his life
[45:40] through you that's what it is i said you
[45:42] know this world
[45:44] is i was in prayer the other day i said
[45:46] this world is in such bad shape
[45:50] it's in messed up shape i said lord
[45:53] i'll say it like this to be honest i
[45:56] said lord
[45:57] if you should tarry and all the older
[46:01] saints were to leave off the scene i
[46:04] said god
[46:05] we're going to need something we're
[46:07] going to need something more than what
[46:08] we got
[46:10] i said god we going to need a double
[46:12] triple portion
[46:14] because the world ain't getting no
[46:15] better it's getting more wicked
[46:18] and i said god we need another outporn
[46:21] to do what to carry on
[46:24] because though even men die god's spirit
[46:27] is still in the earth
[46:29] and if something happened you know that
[46:33] i could see that you know when they
[46:36] talked about the image and all the
[46:38] kingdoms but in the end there was a
[46:40] stone here
[46:41] out of the mountain that smote the image
[46:44] on the foot come on
[46:45] busted into pieces and the wind
[46:48] scattered it and that stone grew into a
[46:50] great mountain and
[46:51] talked about how you know the kingdom of
[46:54] god when it was established
[46:56] that would be it that would be the last
[46:58] kingdom i say lord
[47:00] i want to be in the kingdom lord i want
[47:02] to be
[47:03] a part of that kingdom oh hallelujah
[47:06] the world is in his condition going down
[47:09] but yet
[47:10] lord i'm still looking to you like we're
[47:12] saying the world is going down but lord
[47:14] i know you're taking us up
[47:16] how you know because you can feel
[47:18] something happening in your spirit
[47:20] you got faith like no other because you
[47:23] know
[47:23] that when these things are happening you
[47:25] beginning to look up
[47:26] hallelujah you're starting to lose
[47:30] like we say control because you're
[47:32] giving it all over to god
[47:34] you to the point the way you say lord
[47:37] here it is god
[47:39] oh god we know this has come to a
[47:41] showdown and god you're gonna have to
[47:43] take
[47:43] complete control you're gonna i'm gonna
[47:46] have to
[47:46] learn how to let go how many want to
[47:49] learn that tonight
[47:51] but i said that you know it's something
[47:53] about
[47:54] a calvary and and what it and what it
[47:58] wrought
[47:58] how like we say is how sin uh
[48:02] paralyzed the earth come on
[48:06] how you look at man's desires
[48:09] man's wants all the time all the things
[48:11] he ever want to do
[48:13] sin sin more come on never mention god
[48:16] now god never comes into his mind but he
[48:19] gets further and further
[48:21] away but then yet you have those you
[48:24] have
[48:24] something down on the inside of you
[48:27] still
[48:28] crying out for that old-time religion
[48:31] still crying out for that old fashioned
[48:33] outpouring of the holy ghost
[48:36] something that's going to make you walk
[48:37] right something that's going to make you
[48:39] talk right
[48:40] something that's going to make you let
[48:42] go of all the world and the world desire
[48:44] to get your mind
[48:45] back on that hey this isn't i'm just a
[48:48] stranger a pilgrim
[48:49] passing through i'm not from here i'm
[48:51] here on a mission and that's to do what
[48:53] to get back to where i came from
[48:56] something to get you
[48:57] your mind back in tune with god how many
[49:00] want that tonight
[49:01] i didn't intend to be long i mighta was
[49:03] real short but i said calvary
[49:06] what calvary brought come on i just
[49:08] wanted to get your mind
[49:10] back to thinking about you know what god
[49:13] done for you
[49:15] like i said he took my place he took
[49:18] your place but he even though he freely
[49:22] give it
[49:22] he don't force himself on you you got to
[49:25] freely come
[49:26] come on and once you come learn how to
[49:30] yield and let go
[49:31] and let god do the rest amen
[49:56] the private talk about that day on
[49:58] calvary amen
[50:00] praise god that day on calvary
[50:03] amen i often times talk about
[50:06] if the devil knew what he was doing he
[50:08] would have never did it
[50:11] the bible said had he known
[50:15] he would not have crucified
[50:19] the lord of glory but the devil didn't
[50:22] know
[50:24] what killing jesus amen would do
[50:29] jesus
[50:33] he knew the bible said with
[50:37] the joy that set before him
[50:40] he endured the cross despised the shame
[50:45] oh yeah that's some shame they stripped
[50:48] them naked they put a cloth on the
[50:50] crucifix but they stripped him naked
[50:54] no clothes shame
[50:58] but he did it all for you and i
[51:01] just think if you were strong enough
[51:04] powerful enough to call 12
[51:05] legions of angels and all you needed was
[51:08] just one
[51:12] called 12 legion of angels to come to
[51:14] his rescue
[51:15] but because he loved us enough
[51:20] if we can only love like god loved us
[51:25] if we can only forgive
[51:28] proves our love it's a proof
[51:32] that we love because jesus
[51:35] in forgiving our sins and dive our sins
[51:40] he proved how much he cared about us
[51:45] you know we can't forgive somebody that
[51:48] just do just a little something to us
[51:52] we won't forgive them we won't give them
[51:54] a second chance
[51:56] we won't even hear them when they say
[51:58] i'm sorry
[52:01] but jesus that there on calvary he
[52:03] proved
[52:05] that uh uh brother ernie said he spit on
[52:08] him
[52:11] some said if you be the christ
[52:14] why don't you save yourself
[52:18] come down from the cross you know
[52:21] that he had the power to do it
[52:25] brother
[52:30] character is not a gift it's a victory
[52:36] god you we must
[52:40] in order to have character we must
[52:42] overcome some things it's a victory
[52:47] the very heart of god was on display on
[52:50] calvary
[52:52] the very love of god was on display on
[52:55] calvary
[52:58] brothers see how far we are away
[53:01] from the expression and from god
[53:04] using us in such a way
[53:09] you think about the next time
[53:13] somebody do you wrong
[53:17] you know i i today even the day i was
[53:21] just praying just praying praying
[53:23] praying
[53:24] i said god i don't want nothing to
[53:28] hinder
[53:30] me in my walk with you
[53:33] if there's anything lord touch me try me
[53:39] lord make i want to make certain
[53:42] brother and sister on this journey you
[53:44] must make you must be certain of god
[53:48] you must be certain that amen it's not
[53:51] how you feel about yourself that
[53:54] you are approved of god
[53:58] but the very manifestation of the living
[54:01] god
[54:02] is expressing himself through you
[54:06] it's not what you can do or what you
[54:08] have achieved or
[54:10] done it's god in you
[54:13] getting his glory back
[54:16] are you with me the only thing you can
[54:20] give
[54:20] god is what he gave to you
[54:23] are you with me and if he gave it to you
[54:26] then you tell me
[54:28] what are you doing for god
[54:31] or what are you giving god
[54:36] i can hear that song i give back to you
[54:41] all you gave to me i i forgot i
[54:44] go to the it was a sister in detroit we
[54:47] had a little mission going
[54:48] in detroit and i heard it for the first
[54:50] time and
[54:52] boy i i i look like it
[54:55] rains and i never can forget latune
[54:59] she sung so beautifully it was all
[55:02] executive
[55:04] people from the corporation world and
[55:07] and i was just probably
[55:12] out of place all these executive people
[55:16] but by the grace of god they will come
[55:17] to hear the gospel
[55:20] but by the grace of god i'm going to say
[55:22] to you
[55:24] what god gave to you give it back to him
[55:28] amen and when you give it back you got
[55:30] to realize it don't belong to you anyway
[55:33] some brother gordon tells me all the
[55:34] time about paying tithes
[55:36] he said brad i ain't got no problem with
[55:39] that don't belong to me anyway
[55:42] you see what i'm saying and i said thank
[55:44] the lord
[55:46] see what we give to god we got to
[55:47] realize it don't belong to us anyway
[55:51] all that we have god gave it to us it
[55:53] don't belong to us
[55:56] it belongs to god
[56:00] jesus amen knew that
[56:03] he came from god and he was going back
[56:05] to god
[56:06] he realized on calvary i got to express
[56:11] how to love amen
[56:14] i i i i i i i'm a show
[56:17] and i'm a manifest to you the love of
[56:20] god
[56:23] brother and sister every christian ought
[56:26] to
[56:26] reexamine their cells and look to
[56:30] calvary
[56:31] and see what calvary means to each and
[56:34] every one of us
[56:36] every time i look at calvary and as
[56:39] brother ernest was sharing with us the
[56:43] night minister league
[56:45] let's look at calvary let's take a good
[56:47] look at it
[56:49] and let's examine our faith let's
[56:52] examine do we love him
[56:54] for what he's done for us do we
[56:58] truly love god
[57:01] and if we love him we got no problem
[57:04] with doing what he asked us to do for
[57:06] him
[57:07] because we realize what he's done for us
[57:10] we can never repay
[57:14] are you with me we can never
[57:18] repay all that god has
[57:21] done for us we can never give enough we
[57:24] can never do enough
[57:28] all of our services all that we do
[57:32] don't you think about man when you do it
[57:36] do it as
[57:37] unto the lord and god will bless you
[57:41] hey god your blessings will come
[57:45] abundantly
[57:46] because that the song said you cannot
[57:49] beat god-given
[57:51] no matter how hard you try
[57:54] you'll never even be god-given
[57:58] are you with me so brothers and sisters
[58:03] give and god will give back to you
[58:08] amen i'm not talking about how
[58:11] these prosperity preachers i can't i
[58:14] wonder why i can't never quote that
[58:16] scripture i can quote
[58:17] uh chapters and all kind and i never
[58:20] could quote that you're to give and god
[58:22] would give to you
[58:24] press down and run it over you know
[58:27] i i i ca see because i think they made a
[58:31] mockery of it
[58:32] to just get money out of people but
[58:34] people be blessed now
[58:36] but nevertheless they just don't
[58:40] rip people awesome but i i i like to say
[58:43] it in the
[58:44] way of your life what you do for god and
[58:47] your your service and what you do for
[58:49] god amen
[58:51] god will give it back to you
[58:54] amen press down running over
[58:58] are you with me you usually just do all
[59:02] you can do
