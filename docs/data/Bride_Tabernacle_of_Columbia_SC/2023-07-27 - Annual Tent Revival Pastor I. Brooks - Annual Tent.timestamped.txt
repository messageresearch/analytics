[27:43] to talk to him but Elisha did not come
[27:46] out he just said gehazi his servant to
[27:50] speak to him
[27:51] you know gehazi was someone that was
[27:54] inner in the Inner Circle
[27:57] the message come from God from the angel
[28:00] to the prophet and from the prophet
[28:04] gehazi was a commissioned to distribute
[28:08] it to the people
[28:10] and hazis thought that he doesn't need

[28:24] told them what the prophet had said he
[28:27] says this is the word of the prophet
[28:31] gehazi
[28:32] represent somebody some kind of
[28:35] organization who is close to the prophet
[28:38] who has the ability to distribute the
[28:42] message worldwide
[28:44] but you see when he came he said we
[28:47] don't need any Minister little did he
[28:49] know that uh nahaman was not going to
[28:53] believe his message
[28:55] the bride was going to resist and become
[28:58] reticent

[29:24] them I'm gonna go back home and uh bathe
[29:28] in those rivers and wash myself over
[29:30] there but the life was not there the
[29:34] life was in obedience to the word of God
[29:38] and the servant said listen if you had
[29:41] asked you to do something difficult you
[29:43] would have obeyed him that's a type of
[29:45] the five full ministry the other one
[29:48] ministering to that rebellious men you

[42:17] [Music]
[42:22] I'm in that mysterious place
[42:26] where the Bible said Enoch walk with God
[42:31] and right now I can save by God's grace
[42:34] I'm walking with God
[42:38] I'm walking with a word
[42:41] that I know is going to translate me
[42:46] absolutely
[42:49] not prolonging the time I thank God for
[42:53] a precious brother
[42:55] Simmons and pastor of the church here
[42:59] all the ministers and their wives
[43:02] I've gotten my wife with me tonight
[43:05] amen so I thank God for her traveling
[43:08] with us
[43:10] God gave us a good trip
[43:13] I must say so myself
[43:17] my wife and I have been married 46 years
[43:21] yes
[43:22] and uh
[43:26] we were we were looking at some of those
[43:28] younger younger pictures
[43:31] of ourselves
[43:35] I won't tell you what I thought about me
[43:39] but I'll say this
[43:41] one thing for certain
[43:44] it won't be long now
[43:47] I'm looking for a body change
[43:52] let us go by the grace of God to Joshua
[43:56] 24 13-16 I hope I didn't leave anyone
[43:58] out we appreciate the musicians I know
[44:01] it's hot so I've been already told you
[44:04] know don't don't don't preach to
[44:06] midnight
[44:10] I appreciate that I I can be long-winded
[44:13] but I just trust by the grace of God
[44:15] that God would give us Grace I really
[44:18] wasn't supposed to be here
[44:20] uh on this weekend we we were to have a
[44:24] wedding in the church uh there in Iowa
[44:27] City
[44:28] but some changes were made we we did the
[44:31] wedding last weekend
[44:33] and so I thank God for that because at
[44:36] first it was canceled or postponed and
[44:38] then they changed it again and then it
[44:40] worked out all right
[44:41] so I appreciate brother Simmons for
[44:44] sticking me in here
[44:45] amen I would have come anyhow
[44:48] yeah so by the grace of God
[44:52] um we love the Lord some of you know me
[44:55] some of you do not and I trust by God's
[44:58] grace that somehow the Lord will bless
[45:00] you
[45:01] we're living in the last days and we've
[45:03] heard that so many times
[45:06] we've heard it we've heard it we've
[45:09] heard it and we've heard it all over
[45:11] again
[45:12] but for some reason I I don't think it's
[45:15] getting to the people
[45:17] uh the urgency
[45:19] of this message
[45:21] it is an Urgent Message it's a it's a
[45:25] message we should never allow to become
[45:28] common
[45:30] and uh it's it's a it's a matter of life
[45:33] and death
[45:35] uh it's it's not religion
[45:38] we've had that for 2 000 years it's it's
[45:41] beyond uh organization or
[45:44] denominationalism
[45:45] it's not enough to be a member of a
[45:48] church or or to be a part of a
[45:50] congregation
[45:52] but the question is
[45:54] have you received the Holy Ghost
[45:57] since you believed
[46:00] right
[46:03] we're moving to perfection
[46:07] and the god of
[46:10] Moses Elijah you name it that same God
[46:13] is here today
[46:16] yeah
[46:18] let's go on
[46:20] Joshua
[46:22] 24
[46:24] so I appreciate the
[46:27] Church of God brother Simmons his wife
[46:29] and family they have always been
[46:31] very kind to me
[46:34] to be honest with you he's been
[46:37] more than a brother
[46:40] uh
[46:41] all I can say is that I truly love
[46:44] him
[46:46] and his wife and family
[46:49] as a special place in my heart
[46:53] I don't say that to be saying it it's
[46:55] really what it really is
[46:57] but let's go on with the word of God
[47:00] Joshua 24
[47:02] 13-16
[47:05] like our brother uh
[47:09] was saying you know we want to see God
[47:11] in action
[47:14] I've seen Miracles I've seen signs and
[47:17] wonder some things I don't tell because
[47:19] I just figured people won't believe in
[47:20] any way
[47:22] but you know I know that the God I serve
[47:25] is alive and well
[47:27] amen Joshua
[47:30] 24 13 and I have given you a land for
[47:34] which ye did not labor
[47:37] and cities which ye Bill not
[47:40] ye dwell in them of The Vineyards and of
[47:44] the olive yards which ye Planet not do
[47:47] you eat
[47:48] now therefore fear the lord
[47:51] and serve him in sincerity and in truth
[47:55] put away the gods which your fathers
[47:58] served on the other side of the flood
[48:02] and in Egypt
[48:03] and serve ye the Lord
[48:07] and if it seem evil unto you to serve
[48:10] the Lord choose you this day
[48:13] whom ye will serve
[48:15] whether the gods which your father
[48:18] served that were on the other side of
[48:21] the flood
[48:22] or the gods of the amorites and whose
[48:25] land ye dwell
[48:26] but as for me
[48:28] in my house
[48:30] we will serve the Lord
[48:32] and the people answered and said God
[48:36] forbid
[48:37] that we should forsake the Lord
[48:39] to serve other gods
[48:43] one more scripture Joshua still Joshua
[48:47] 2.
[48:52] beginning at the 18th verse
[48:56] but when we come into the land
[48:59] thou shall bind this line of scarlet
[49:02] thread in the window
[49:05] which thou did let us down by
[49:08] and thou shall bring thy father and thy
[49:11] mother and thy brethren in all thy
[49:14] father's household come unto thee
[49:18] and if it shall be that whosoever
[49:23] shall go out of the doors of thine house
[49:27] into the street
[49:29] his blood shall be upon his head
[49:33] and he will be Guiltless
[49:36] and whosoever shall be with thee in
[49:39] thine house his blood shall be on our
[49:42] head if any
[49:44] hand be upon him
[49:48] let us pray our heavenly father we come
[49:51] before you Lord we thank you for your
[49:53] grace we thank you for your mercy we
[49:56] thank you for being so good to us Lord
[49:59] you have been better to us than we've
[50:01] been to ourselves and Lord what can we
[50:04] say we thank you for your election we
[50:08] thank you for your predestination we
[50:11] thank you for the sight in which you
[50:13] have given unto us God there are so many
[50:16] that desire to see what we see and
[50:19] father we praise you because you have
[50:22] given us eyes to see the day and the
[50:25] time that we're living in I pray tonight
[50:28] Lord that you would break and destroy
[50:31] the Yokes of the enemy I pray father God
[50:34] that you go beyond the minds of the
[50:36] people and go down into the depths of
[50:38] their hearts that they may seal God and
[50:41] understand what is required of us in
[50:45] these last days in your lovely name
[50:47] Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be
[50:51] seated
[50:52] Hallelujah
[50:54] when we think about what God is doing
[50:58] I don't know whether everybody can see
[51:01] it and maybe I'm just late a late Comer
[51:03] but I can see
[51:05] and I can understand what God is doing
[51:08] in this day
[51:09] and the thing that excites me more than
[51:12] anything else
[51:13] is because it's personal
[51:16] I don't have to wait on a group
[51:18] I don't have to wait on my neighbor or
[51:20] my uncle or brother
[51:23] it's something that God is doing in me
[51:27] now the Bible said in that day
[51:30] you'll know that I am in the Father the
[51:33] father's in me and I am in you
[51:37] is that right so we know that there's a
[51:40] relationship that's happening right now
[51:43] and this relationship amen has a purpose
[51:47] we are there as I said to my church the
[51:50] other night this is the last episode
[51:55] for the Gentile
[51:57] y'all better hear what I'm saying
[51:58] because a lot of us know what episodes
[52:01] are right when we watch all those
[52:04] stories on YouTube and all these things
[52:06] they always bring it in episodes
[52:10] and every time you say well I know I'm
[52:13] spending too much time on this thing
[52:15] I'm not going to do it again
[52:18] but then that last episode that you look
[52:21] and listen to makes it more exciting
[52:25] and then you say oh God one more time
[52:29] y'all hear what I'm saying
[52:31] but at the end of it all it comes to an
[52:35] end
[52:37] and sometimes the end
[52:39] it's not what you expecting it to be
[52:42] you're disappointed because you was
[52:45] expecting something some kind of
[52:48] excitement some kind of explosion
[52:51] but then at the end of the whole thing
[52:54] it leads you null and void
[52:59] hmm
[53:00] now I want to tell you about my God
[53:04] and when my God wrote This Book
[53:08] he not only wrote the book
[53:11] but he was able to step into the book
[53:16] he's the author he's the finisher
[53:21] of this book
[53:24] and so we know by the grace of God when
[53:27] God talks about
[53:29] book
[53:30] a book
[53:32] or door
[53:36] those things are symbolic
[53:39] and every time you hear that
[53:42] he's speaking of himself
[53:45] Hallelujah for an example in the church
[53:49] age when God said there was an Open Door
[53:53] what was it God had was revealing
[53:56] himself
[53:57] in a measure to those people of that age
[54:02] is that right
[54:03] so you must understand those people of
[54:06] that age would never have gotten what
[54:09] God was to say to that age unless they
[54:13] had the ability
[54:15] to see it
[54:16] and to receive it
[54:20] y'all hear what I'm saying because
[54:22] though they preached in that day
[54:24] everybody heard
[54:28] but because you hear it
[54:30] doesn't mean you understand it
[54:33] and doesn't even mean that you receives
[54:35] it
[54:36] because the word of God is only given to
[54:40] the elected of God
[54:42] they're the only ones that has ears to
[54:45] hear eyes the sea and a heart to
[54:49] perceive
[54:50] y'all hear what I'm saying and God don't
[54:53] care if you are prostitute
[54:56] if you're a whoremonger if a dolphin
[55:00] if you are a true Son of God
[55:04] when the word of the Lord comes to you
[55:07] it somehow turns the light on
[55:11] somebody know what I'm talking about
[55:13] see we are not worthy
[55:16] to hear this word we're not worthy for
[55:21] God to even call us by name
[55:24] but God In His Infinite Wisdom
[55:28] Hallelujah before the foundation of the
[55:32] world
[55:33] the Bible said he put my name
[55:36] in the Lamb's Book of Life
[55:39] Hallelujah that's why I'm here today
[55:43] not because I chose God but because God
[55:47] chose me Hallelujah God chose you
[55:51] Hallelujah we come to worship him we
[55:55] come to praise him we come to let God
[55:58] know how much we've appreciate him
[56:02] Hallelujah
[56:06] like I say
[56:08] I'm just going to help my brother
[56:11] we ought to make the devil nervous
[56:14] we ought to worship so hard tonight
[56:17] because you know he got all his heat
[56:19] here he figure you're not going to
[56:21] worship
[56:22] so if you faint
[56:24] at least you faint in Jesus name
[56:28] huh it's worth it
[56:32] Hallelujah
[56:33] glory to God
[56:35] now we're looking at this thing
[56:37] you say oh brother before he was saying
[56:40] we find out that in the beginning
[56:43] the word was closed according to Daniel
[56:46] is that right
[56:48] seal up the book then you all of us know
[56:50] that
[56:51] but at the end time
[56:53] then you say it's going to speak
[56:57] have you ever seen a book speak
[57:01] let me say it like this the Bible says
[57:04] in the Book of Genesis that the voice of
[57:07] God walked in the cool of the evening
[57:09] have you seen a voice walk
[57:15] it was always God
[57:17] and it always will be God
[57:20] Hallelujah nobody understands this book
[57:24] like God understands it
[57:27] and in order for you to understand it he
[57:31] must reveal it
[57:34] is that right this is why he said Upon
[57:38] This Rock I'll build my church
[57:41] and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[57:45] against it Hallelujah is that all right
[57:49] so we look at this thing and
[57:51] I'm gonna get to my message in just a
[57:53] minute
[57:54] but we find out when I was in school
[57:56] there at the University of South
[57:58] Carolina
[57:59] I actually and and that makes me nothing
[58:01] if you listen to me talk you find out it
[58:03] sounds like I've never had an English
[58:05] course in my life but the truth of the
[58:07] matter is
[58:08] we had composition
[58:11] and the first composition I wrote
[58:13] I did bad on it
[58:16] right so I had to learn
[58:19] what was in the mind
[58:22] of my professor
[58:24] now God gave me that wisdom
[58:27] so I went to his office
[58:30] in a subtle way
[58:32] I said sir
[58:34] could you please teach me
[58:36] and show me how you would write this
[58:42] I'm about to help me
[58:43] so I watched him how he corrected my
[58:47] paper and from that time on
[58:50] I wrote
[58:52] with his mind
[58:55] and not my mind
[58:57] and I aced the course
[58:59] somebody help me here see this is why
[59:03] the Bible is here
[59:05] this is why the Bible says let this mind
[59:09] be in you that was also in Christ Jesus
[59:12] because if you have the mind of Christ
[59:15] you'll understand the book
[59:20] Hallelujah and the Bible says what we
[59:25] have the mind of Christ
[59:28] now I'm coming
[59:30] because we come in the last day
[59:33] we've gone beyond the church ages
[59:36] hello
[59:37] now I don't know about you some of y'all
[59:39] might be in later this year
[59:41] but God been I've been smitten
[59:43] I've been brought out
[59:45] I've been immune out
[59:48] Hallelujah
[59:49] and I'm in another age
[59:51] I'm in a call it what you want to I'm
[59:54] not here to agree theology
[59:56] but I know I'm not in laodicea
[1:00:00] so if I'm not in there to see where are
[1:00:02] you brother I'm in Christ
[1:00:05] Hallelujah and when you are in Christ
[1:00:08] you are in the Capstone
[1:00:14] oh y'all
[1:00:17] Hallelujah
[1:00:19] see what I'm saying
[1:00:20] but I'm coming to something and I'm
[1:00:22] going to be long it may seem like I am
[1:00:24] but I'm I'm bringing you something
[1:00:27] because I'm gonna tell y'all something
[1:00:29] I'm giving you the honey now
[1:00:31] this is honey
[1:00:33] the bit of Power is coming
[1:00:36] right so you know by God's grace we're
[1:00:39] in an age where you have
[1:00:41] that they're Where We Are
[1:00:44] love
[1:00:46] Divine love
[1:00:48] is your goal
[1:00:50] y'all hear me
[1:00:52] not brotherly kindness which many of us
[1:00:55] stumble with all the time
[1:00:57] but Divine love
[1:01:00] and this Divine love as our brother said
[1:01:03] is a creative love
[1:01:06] a love that you that that's moved by God
[1:01:10] to create things
[1:01:12] is that right now you say I'm in the
[1:01:15] message well this is the message
[1:01:19] Hallelujah and I'm gonna tell you your
[1:01:22] will will never make it happen
[1:01:27] Hallelujah and not even your own voice
[1:01:31] will make it happen
[1:01:33] this has to be inspired
[1:01:36] by the Holy Ghost
[1:01:40] Hallelujah but if you're not in the Holy
[1:01:43] Ghost
[1:01:44] how can God talk to you
[1:01:48] or somebody help me here see because I
[1:01:51] want you to understand
[1:01:53] that the holy ghost or what we call the
[1:01:56] token
[1:01:57] is above every one of yours Covenant
[1:02:01] what
[1:02:03] yes
[1:02:04] because you belong to us
[1:02:08] doesn't mean anything
[1:02:11] it could be the group you could have the
[1:02:12] greatest Pastor ever
[1:02:15] but that doesn't mean anything
[1:02:18] token must be applied
[1:02:21] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:02:23] I read by the grace of God
[1:02:26] Israel
[1:02:27] had to have a blood sacrifice
[1:02:31] y'all hear me
[1:02:33] and that blood had to be put on the
[1:02:36] doorpost and the little
[1:02:38] in in other words it had to be placed on
[1:02:41] the heart
[1:02:44] it didn't matter
[1:02:47] whether they were Israelites
[1:02:50] circumcised on the eighth day
[1:02:52] it didn't matter whether they were the
[1:02:56] tribe of Judah or The Tribe of Benjamin
[1:02:59] whatever the tribe would have been would
[1:03:02] have been another fact
[1:03:03] if the blood wasn't on the doorpost
[1:03:07] God don't care whether you're Baptist he
[1:03:10] don't care whether you're Methodist he
[1:03:12] don't care whether your Pentecostals he
[1:03:15] don't care whether you're Apostolic he
[1:03:17] don't care whether you message the blood
[1:03:20] must be applied
[1:03:22] Hallelujah
[1:03:24] I'm talking about the blood of the Lamb
[1:03:26] yes sir it has always been the blood
[1:03:30] somebody help me here it's always been
[1:03:33] the blood but now people get so
[1:03:36] sophisticated they said well it's not
[1:03:38] the blood not literally you're right
[1:03:42] but it's the life of the blood
[1:03:44] Hallelujah
[1:03:46] is that right
[1:03:48] you see
[1:03:50] if the devil had only understood who
[1:03:52] Jesus was
[1:03:54] Hallelujah he's never would have
[1:03:56] crucified him
[1:03:57] oh my God if he had only understood
[1:04:02] the Redemption plan
[1:04:04] he never would have crucified him
[1:04:07] he says understood
[1:04:09] his position in the scripture
[1:04:12] somebody help me here he knew what he
[1:04:15] was sent for
[1:04:17] come on somebody this is I'm coming to
[1:04:20] you because if you call yourself the
[1:04:23] bride and you don't know what you come
[1:04:25] for
[1:04:27] what are you here for
[1:04:31] you're not here just to dress holy
[1:04:35] or to come to church like everybody else
[1:04:38] does
[1:04:41] Hallelujah you've been chosen
[1:04:45] a god
[1:04:49] to be a reflection
[1:04:52] God
[1:04:53] somebody help me here so when God saw
[1:04:56] when somebody see you they supposed to
[1:04:59] be seeing Jesus
[1:05:01] Hallelujah
[1:05:02] is that right when you're walking down
[1:05:05] the street the world must know that you
[1:05:09] are a light
[1:05:10] somebody help me here glory to God you
[1:05:14] say well what do you mean brother Brooks
[1:05:17] listen
[1:05:21] it wasn't even the lamb
[1:05:25] I knew I was going to get your attention
[1:05:28] it was the blood
[1:05:30] of the Lamb
[1:05:32] because the lamb just packed the life
[1:05:36] of God
[1:05:38] y'all hear what I'm saying but that body
[1:05:40] could die
[1:05:42] but the god in him could never die
[1:05:45] somebody help me here that was God's own
[1:05:48] life in Jesus do y'all hear what I'm
[1:05:51] saying and then Jesus said it's good for
[1:05:55] me to go away because when I go away the
[1:05:58] father will send what the conference who
[1:06:01] is the comforter
[1:06:04] oh come on somebody the Holy Ghost and
[1:06:07] who is the Holy Ghost
[1:06:09] that's God so if God is in you you're
[1:06:14] supposed to bring forth God fruits
[1:06:20] Hallelujah
[1:06:21] like I was telling my church The Day of
[1:06:25] the tree of knowledge and good of Good
[1:06:26] and Evil is over
[1:06:29] Jesus said you make the tree good
[1:06:32] or you make it evil
[1:06:36] right
[1:06:37] God don't want no mixed Christianity
[1:06:40] makes part Christianity and part of the
[1:06:43] world
[1:06:44] oh God don't want that
[1:06:48] kind
[1:06:48] a bloodline his bloodline is pure
[1:06:52] is that right just like the man of God
[1:06:55] says when we receive the Holy Ghost
[1:06:58] God gives us another DNA he gives us a
[1:07:03] blood transfusion
[1:07:06] okay
[1:07:09] I wish I would have brought my papers
[1:07:11] here too brother
[1:07:12] y'all didn't heard me testify how God
[1:07:14] healed me from cancer
[1:07:16] Hallelujah so I had to get some more
[1:07:18] insurance
[1:07:19] and now so they still had that on my
[1:07:21] record
[1:07:22] and I'm like
[1:07:23] I'll take the test
[1:07:26] I'll take whatever you want me to take
[1:07:28] I don't have cancer
[1:07:30] hello
[1:07:31] they took all the tests
[1:07:34] there was no cancer
[1:07:36] oh wait a minute I'm not talking about
[1:07:38] cancer in remission I'm talking about no
[1:07:41] cancer at all
[1:07:44] [Applause]
[1:07:46] I got my papers I wish I would have
[1:07:48] brought them with me see the same Jesus
[1:07:51] that was with Elijah is the same Jesus
[1:07:55] that's in Elisha
[1:07:57] Hallelujah
[1:08:00] but I'm not concentrating on that
[1:08:02] I said we've got so many people
[1:08:05] who are Christians
[1:08:07] but don't live the life
[1:08:11] y'all better hear what I'm saying
[1:08:13] I'm trying to get you to see we at the
[1:08:16] end of this thing this is the last
[1:08:19] episode
[1:08:20] for the Gentiles hallelujah what this is
[1:08:24] over God don't revisit the Gentiles no
[1:08:27] more he goes back to the Jews
[1:08:30] y'all better hear what I'm saying
[1:08:35] many heard this message
[1:08:37] many heard this word
[1:08:40] but they've been so dollary
[1:08:42] so lazy
[1:08:44] so distracted
[1:08:47] come on somebody I know what I'm talking
[1:08:49] about you know what many of us have
[1:08:52] married a system
[1:08:56] that's what it is
[1:08:58] we have become a system we sang the same
[1:09:02] songs we shout off the same songs we
[1:09:05] y'all hear what I'm saying but when it's
[1:09:07] all over where is Jesus where is Christ
[1:09:12] Hallelujah because when God is in the
[1:09:16] house everybody have love one to one
[1:09:20] another don't tell me that you are a
[1:09:24] Christian and you can't forgive
[1:09:27] Hallelujah the very Foundation of
[1:09:30] Christianity was based upon forgiveness
[1:09:34] Hallelujah when Jesus died on the cross
[1:09:39] what did he say
[1:09:40] he was birthing the bride
[1:09:42] father forgive them
[1:09:44] for they know not what they do you say
[1:09:47] prove that because when Stephen
[1:09:50] was being being stoned the same
[1:09:53] inspiration that was in Jesus was in the
[1:09:57] inspiration of Stephen and he says Lord
[1:10:00] oh not these things to their charge what
[1:10:03] was it it was he was in Christ and
[1:10:07] Christ was in him Hallelujah
[1:10:15] Hallelujah
[1:10:18] there's so many people out there you
[1:10:19] don't even understand it's benefits from
[1:10:22] for serving the lord
[1:10:24] [Laughter]
[1:10:29] it's benefits
[1:10:30] my wife and I was coming down the road I
[1:10:33] think it was 321
[1:10:35] and they had a big poster sign
[1:10:37] up talking about something about
[1:10:38] gonorrhea
[1:10:43] well
[1:10:44] they weren't talking about me
[1:10:49] that's the benefit of a Christian
[1:10:52] we live a holy life
[1:10:54] we live a Sanctified life
[1:10:57] I was telling some friends of that my I
[1:11:00] said you know what if you look at my
[1:11:01] life it looked like a real boring life
[1:11:05] but I'm not bored
[1:11:09] I come home I go to church I go to the
[1:11:12] store I do a little activity and I'm
[1:11:14] back home
[1:11:18] y'all hear what I'm saying and I don't
[1:11:20] have a big old screen in my house
[1:11:25] oh yeah
[1:11:27] that's what what we we we we're going to
[1:11:29] watch the message or we're gonna y'all
[1:11:31] get real
[1:11:33] how long does that last
[1:11:36] is that all right
[1:11:38] what what I'm bringing this today
[1:11:41] that he said listen
[1:11:44] if you go out into the street
[1:11:49] he's not responsible
[1:11:52] and I'm gonna tell you something what
[1:11:53] I've been seeing or what I'm seeing even
[1:11:56] in the message churches people are
[1:11:59] literally dying spiritually
[1:12:04] just dying
[1:12:09] like it they dress like it but there is
[1:12:13] no life
[1:12:15] where's the old Saints y'all remember
[1:12:18] the time even in the Pentecostal church
[1:12:21] we serve God so well that there were
[1:12:24] times a glow would come over your face
[1:12:27] when the last you see the glow
[1:12:29] [Music]
[1:12:31] somebody help me here that's the truth
[1:12:35] when God is in your life
[1:12:38] and you are in God it manifests itself
[1:12:42] yes sir the Bible says that when when
[1:12:46] Moses came down off the mountain the
[1:12:50] glory of God was so over him he had to
[1:12:53] cover his face somebody help me here see
[1:12:57] because you got to realize this is not
[1:12:59] some joke
[1:13:01] it's real
[1:13:06] [Music]
[1:13:07] when I see the blood
[1:13:10] and the token can't be put on your shelf
[1:13:12] either
[1:13:15] you don't you say oh I got the Holy
[1:13:16] Ghost but you don't even have a prayer
[1:13:18] life
[1:13:20] oh I got the Holy Ghost and I don't even
[1:13:22] read my Bible
[1:13:23] oh I got the Holy Ghost but I don't even
[1:13:26] listen to message tapes no more
[1:13:29] oh lordy
[1:13:31] Hallelujah you've been deceived
[1:13:34] huh
[1:13:35] because I'm gonna tell you something
[1:13:37] when you listen to the word
[1:13:39] you feed the Holy Ghost
[1:13:43] Hallelujah and some says Lord Give Me
[1:13:48] Back My Joy
[1:13:50] be real Joy
[1:13:52] it can jump Hallelujah
[1:13:54] but real Joy is when it comes from the
[1:13:58] heart
[1:14:00] in the time of sorrow in the time of
[1:14:04] adversity you can still scream it is
[1:14:08] wild it is well it is well all is well
[1:14:13] Hallelujah you better make sure you got
[1:14:18] the real Holy Ghost
[1:14:22] Hallelujah
[1:14:23] you got to get the real one not the
[1:14:26] Baptist one
[1:14:28] not the Methodist one
[1:14:30] ah not the Pentecostal one not the
[1:14:33] message one
[1:14:36] y'all know what I'm talking about
[1:14:38] because the message people got their own
[1:14:40] too now
[1:14:42] Hallelujah
[1:14:45] they got their own
[1:14:47] I don't know but I know one thing about
[1:14:49] it
[1:14:50] seem like all sheep act the same
[1:14:55] it's the truth
[1:14:56] and you know the nature of the sheep
[1:14:58] never changes
[1:15:01] the Holy Ghost never changed
[1:15:05] and we've gotten to the place that
[1:15:07] I got a lot I could be quoting and all
[1:15:09] that but I'm being led this way
[1:15:12] you know we we got to the place
[1:15:14] till we let people dictate
[1:15:18] how you worship
[1:15:22] and you let them do it
[1:15:27] where is the anointing of David
[1:15:29] [Music]
[1:15:31] when Saul's daughter
[1:15:34] stoned him
[1:15:36] he said no no no no this is not going to
[1:15:39] happen let me tell you something if I'm
[1:15:42] shouting and you grab me that's the
[1:15:45] worst thing you could do
[1:15:47] because when I'm done you're gonna think
[1:15:50] I had a real demon
[1:15:56] trying to hold me back so we don't do
[1:15:58] that in here
[1:16:00] what are you talking about
[1:16:02] the god in me got me jumping the god in
[1:16:06] me got me running
[1:16:07] the god in me got me rejoicing
[1:16:10] Hallelujah
[1:16:12] when the Bible said when the Lord is in
[1:16:15] his Temple let all the Earth be silent
[1:16:18] y'all hear me so when he's in this
[1:16:21] Temple you have no right to criticize
[1:16:27] but we don't do it that way in the
[1:16:28] message
[1:16:30] keep that
[1:16:33] this old quiet religious method of stuff
[1:16:38] now I
[1:16:41] yes I'm sorry this
[1:16:42] but nevertheless
[1:16:45] you know how people do
[1:16:46] Hallelujah
[1:16:53] oh God been to you
[1:16:56] and then when a sister get up there
[1:16:58] Hallelujah
[1:17:00] you're trying to determine whether she
[1:17:02] got a devil or not
[1:17:04] what if that's the devil let him praise
[1:17:06] God
[1:17:11] [Music]
[1:17:15] the token is something
[1:17:18] the token is not some third person or
[1:17:21] second person it is the person it's God
[1:17:26] and God acts in a peculiar way
[1:17:31] he'll make you do things that you
[1:17:32] thought you'd never do
[1:17:35] every time I read Ezekiel I think about
[1:17:37] how God's Ezekiel said God took me by
[1:17:40] the heads of my hair
[1:17:44] and lifted me up
[1:17:46] y'all believe that I believe it
[1:17:50] now he was translated
[1:17:54] see sometimes we think see that's what
[1:17:56] people don't understand
[1:17:57] I'm looking and I'm expecting
[1:18:00] this translation
[1:18:02] translation a man can take you from one
[1:18:05] place to another on the Earth
[1:18:08] and also translation can take you from
[1:18:10] Earth to heaven
[1:18:12] y'all hear what I'm saying so for an
[1:18:15] example explain to me when Philip
[1:18:18] baptized the eunuch
[1:18:21] and after he baptized the eunuch Philip
[1:18:24] was caught up
[1:18:26] can you imagine
[1:18:28] what that unit must have felt when he
[1:18:31] saw the man who was with him disappeared
[1:18:36] that's not Old Testament
[1:18:39] that's New Testament
[1:18:42] that's not
[1:18:43] denominational food that's fried food
[1:18:48] because the Bible says all things are
[1:18:51] possible to them that believe
[1:18:55] Hallelujah choose you this day Who you
[1:18:58] gonna serve
[1:19:01] let me tell you something the devil on
[1:19:03] the steel kill and destroy you
[1:19:06] y'all playing those games with him
[1:19:09] I'm gonna tell you something he's
[1:19:10] smarter than you
[1:19:13] we've heard that so many times you give
[1:19:15] him an inch he'll take a mile
[1:19:17] hallelujah oh you backslaughters don't
[1:19:21] you know when you thought to leave God
[1:19:23] you thought I'd come back at a certain
[1:19:25] time it ain't that easy
[1:19:29] the devil just don't let you go
[1:19:35] it takes the mercy and grace of God to
[1:19:38] loose you from the Devil what she was
[1:19:40] once with God and now what
[1:19:43] the devil will take you right on down to
[1:19:45] the pig swine
[1:19:47] have you slopping up with the pigs
[1:19:49] Hallelujah until you come to a
[1:19:52] realization this is not who I am
[1:19:56] y'all hear me
[1:19:57] that's what this message made me know
[1:20:01] that when I was a sinner
[1:20:03] I thought that was me
[1:20:08] oh come on y'all
[1:20:10] I know you did
[1:20:12] some of us he used to have that say I'm
[1:20:13] trying to find myself
[1:20:15] not not even realizing you're saying I'm
[1:20:17] lost
[1:20:20] huh
[1:20:21] but that yeah you look at me and see
[1:20:24] some of y'all don't know where I come
[1:20:26] from and you know what you don't need to
[1:20:28] know
[1:20:29] but I'll tell you why I was a wretched
[1:20:33] right and I was one of those sneaky kind
[1:20:37] hey
[1:20:38] those are the worst kind
[1:20:42] somebody know what I'm talking about
[1:20:45] those are the worst kind
[1:20:47] because even when you when you get saved
[1:20:50] God has to take all of that out of you
[1:20:54] he must purify you he's got to sanctify
[1:20:59] you
[1:21:02] Hallelujah
[1:21:04] glory to God you love the Lord
[1:21:06] y'all pulling me this way dude amen
[1:21:10] but see you we we look at this thing
[1:21:14] and I love Joshua because Joshua is a
[1:21:17] type of Jesus right
[1:21:19] Hallelujah and I love Joshua because
[1:21:22] what did Joshua do
[1:21:25] different
[1:21:26] than Moses
[1:21:29] Moses did everything
[1:21:32] and people came all from all over the
[1:21:35] world just to see Moses perform
[1:21:39] but when Moses died
[1:21:42] something happened
[1:21:44] the commission changed
[1:21:47] it was now given to Joshua
[1:21:50] and Joshua included the people
[1:21:53] y'all hear me it wasn't just Joshua
[1:21:56] alone it was Joshua and the host of
[1:21:59] Israel Hallelujah so let me say it like
[1:22:03] this it's not just Jesus alone it's
[1:22:06] Jesus and the host of Jesus which is his
[1:22:09] bride we are here to conquer
[1:22:14] how the world is going to know you
[1:22:16] different if we're going to mingle with
[1:22:18] them
[1:22:21] Hallelujah
[1:22:23] you love the Lord
[1:22:25] see
[1:22:26] I believe my eternal destiny
[1:22:30] is to be a full grown son of God
[1:22:36] a son that is now being trained a son
[1:22:41] that is now amen going through the
[1:22:44] process because you understand the word
[1:22:46] right
[1:22:47] if you don't eat the word then your body
[1:22:50] can't materialize around it
[1:22:54] right is that right you say I'm in the
[1:22:57] Rapture well let me say it like this or
[1:22:59] translation however you want to say it
[1:23:01] when Sarah and Abraham they had a word
[1:23:05] promise
[1:23:06] right and so they believed it
[1:23:10] they didn't do anything to turn Young
[1:23:13] it was the word
[1:23:17] y'all hear me and who is the word Jesus
[1:23:21] Christ
[1:23:21] it was Christ in them
[1:23:24] changing the elements of their bodies
[1:23:28] as they walked with the promise somebody
[1:23:31] help me
[1:23:32] that's what's happening now we're
[1:23:35] walking with the promise and the promise
[1:23:38] in that promise he's changing us I don't
[1:23:42] care how my body may look but on the
[1:23:46] inside
[1:23:47] there's a change going on and one of
[1:23:51] these old days
[1:23:53] that Change is Gonna drop this whole
[1:23:56] nasty body and take on the theophany and
[1:24:01] change the amen with a glorified body I
[1:24:04] believe that
[1:24:07] Hallelujah
[1:24:09] but let me get back to one thought
[1:24:15] because some of us still believe
[1:24:19] or denominational Grace
[1:24:23] they couldn't give you all of it
[1:24:27] you didn't even have to you didn't know
[1:24:28] what Grace was until you understood what
[1:24:30] the election was
[1:24:33] an election is a higher calling than
[1:24:35] Grace
[1:24:37] I can give Grace to anybody
[1:24:39] right
[1:24:41] but that don't mean they're elected
[1:24:44] somebody help me here
[1:24:46] but because I'm elected
[1:24:49] my grace
[1:24:51] is greater than other Grace
[1:24:55] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:24:57] my grace
[1:24:59] is unfailing Grace
[1:25:02] oh my God
[1:25:04] you gotta understand
[1:25:06] talking about
[1:25:09] [Music]
[1:25:11] now you don't know what I'm talking
[1:25:13] about but let me tell you
[1:25:14] a week or so ago
[1:25:17] I took a week to myself
[1:25:19] fasting praying I'm not boasting
[1:25:23] but I had gotten into a slump
[1:25:25] very tired and weary
[1:25:29] still studying still praying
[1:25:31] but something was going on that I didn't
[1:25:33] like here here
[1:25:35] so I my wife allowed me to go
[1:25:38] the church allowed me to go follow me a
[1:25:40] place to go I went to that place
[1:25:42] fasted prayed sought the Lord and the
[1:25:46] Lord said to me
[1:25:47] you forgot
[1:25:49] you forgot this is why you responded and
[1:25:52] you've acted in the way that you've been
[1:25:54] acting because you forgot I said I'll
[1:25:57] never leave you
[1:25:59] nor will I forsake you
[1:26:04] and he goes on to tell me I drew you
[1:26:07] with the Everlasting Love
[1:26:12] you know what God did for me he took me
[1:26:15] back to my childhood
[1:26:17] way before I knew anything about God
[1:26:21] and began to show me how he protected me
[1:26:24] here protected me there protecting me
[1:26:26] here protected me there protect he said
[1:26:29] that was me
[1:26:33] Hallelujah and nothing
[1:26:37] I love toward you
[1:26:40] my love is a perfect love
[1:26:43] Hallelujah
[1:26:45] my love I give to you you don't earn it
[1:26:49] you don't deserve it but I gave it to
[1:26:52] you it's an unfailing love
[1:26:57] that's why we can't move on
[1:27:00] look at it
[1:27:02] Peter denied Jesus three times Judas
[1:27:05] once and Peter still hold held his
[1:27:08] position
[1:27:09] oh
[1:27:11] let me say it like this and I'm almost I
[1:27:13] I just feel like I gotta say this
[1:27:18] one thing I love
[1:27:20] about the Book of Esther no I'm not
[1:27:22] going to preach on Esther
[1:27:25] but uh
[1:27:27] the king's word
[1:27:29] could not come back boy
[1:27:39] oh
[1:27:42] see once the word goes out
[1:27:45] he can't change his law
[1:27:51] that's powerful
[1:27:54] because God before the time
[1:27:58] made a law
[1:28:01] and Vindicated that law
[1:28:04] by writing your name
[1:28:07] in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:28:09] nothing
[1:28:12] the King has decreed it
[1:28:15] nothing can change it
[1:28:17] nothing can vorted out
[1:28:20] somebody help me here
[1:28:22] right nothing convert it
[1:28:26] but see we still under that kind of
[1:28:28] Grace Lord if I do this if I do that the
[1:28:31] Bible said in that while we're here yet
[1:28:34] sinners
[1:28:35] could die for us
[1:28:37] Hallelujah even when he gave you the
[1:28:41] Holy Ghost he knew the mistakes you were
[1:28:44] going to make
[1:28:45] Hallelujah like I tell people I said I'm
[1:28:48] gonna tell you he's a friend that stick
[1:28:50] closer than a brother
[1:28:53] Hallelujah
[1:28:55] there were times
[1:28:56] there was no friends around
[1:28:59] but then a song come to my heart
[1:29:02] yes Jesus Loves
[1:29:05] Hallelujah do you think that was the
[1:29:08] devil
[1:29:09] that was God
[1:29:13] Hallelujah
[1:29:15] when I looked on place and you made a
[1:29:18] mistake then all of a sudden God starts
[1:29:21] ringing that song in your heart there's
[1:29:24] power in the blood
[1:29:26] Wonder working Power in the Blood
[1:29:30] he's always
[1:29:32] ways before me
[1:29:34] somebody help me here because you're
[1:29:36] going to have to know who you are
[1:29:39] I don't know about you
[1:29:41] but I'll say it like this
[1:29:43] God has made me his son
[1:29:46] and he can't even change his mind about
[1:29:48] it
[1:29:51] God has made you his son and daughter
[1:29:54] and he can't make he can't even change
[1:29:56] his mind about it
[1:29:58] Hallelujah you love the Lord
[1:30:01] Hallelujah let me read this
[1:30:04] Eternal Destiny is a choice
[1:30:06] maybe tonight somebody or some of you
[1:30:09] will make that your choice
[1:30:12] of where you expand eternity
[1:30:15] right
[1:30:16] hello
[1:30:18] but he knows your choice
[1:30:22] I can remember when the word of God came
[1:30:24] to me through my friends I said oh
[1:30:27] that's for you and not for me
[1:30:29] I didn't come right off to the Lord I
[1:30:32] read from him
[1:30:33] but he chased me
[1:30:37] Hallelujah
[1:30:38] and guess what
[1:30:42] I had to come to a near-death experience
[1:30:46] in order for God to wake me up
[1:30:49] I was in a club
[1:30:51] and I said Lord
[1:30:53] don't let me die like this
[1:30:56] if you spare my life I'll be in church
[1:31:00] the next week I give my life to you
[1:31:06] Hallelujah he spared my life
[1:31:11] Hallelujah
[1:31:13] that next week
[1:31:14] I would go up to the church day
[1:31:18] Progressive I hope that don't offend
[1:31:20] nobody
[1:31:21] I come in the back door
[1:31:23] promised a friend I was gonna come have
[1:31:26] my little afro and all that you know
[1:31:28] when you got a nice afro you don't want
[1:31:30] to get wet
[1:31:33] I go in there
[1:31:35] and who I see with brother Simmons
[1:31:38] now y'all don't I I thought I knew him
[1:31:41] I really thought brother Simmons was a
[1:31:43] rough character
[1:31:45] anybody that come to school amen dressed
[1:31:48] in a three-piece suit white
[1:31:51] with a hat on and all that stuff you
[1:31:53] know they're dealing something
[1:31:55] [Music]
[1:31:58] that was the way I looked at
[1:32:01] even he told me he didn't do it
[1:32:05] but in my mind
[1:32:07] he said he don't remember this part
[1:32:10] but when I walked in that door and I saw
[1:32:12] him
[1:32:12] I said if God can save you
[1:32:17] he can save me
[1:32:22] and I'm gonna tell you this if you
[1:32:24] hadn't known the kind of Life I Lived
[1:32:26] you would have said the same thing if
[1:32:28] God can save you
[1:32:30] he can save me
[1:32:32] Hallelujah
[1:32:34] let me move on
[1:32:36] too long yet
[1:32:39] Hallelujah
[1:32:40] so we we it's a matter of life and death
[1:32:44] and you and I must know for certain
[1:32:47] what and who we are this is not time to
[1:32:51] be guessing you can't guess this thing
[1:32:54] it's got to be real
[1:32:57] it's not in a song it's got to be in
[1:33:00] your soul
[1:33:03] if that makes sense you understand me
[1:33:06] Hallelujah now we understand when they
[1:33:08] were making that's why it's so important
[1:33:11] because the Covenant like I said
[1:33:14] Israel was under Covenant
[1:33:16] and they said okay I'm circumcised on
[1:33:19] Eighth Day
[1:33:20] you know I'm circumcised and so I'm
[1:33:24] truly truly an Israelite that meant
[1:33:27] nothing to God
[1:33:28] when God turned the corner
[1:33:31] and began to talk to Moses
[1:33:33] and said Moses this is the new ordinance
[1:33:37] slay a lamb
[1:33:39] put the blood on the doorpost and the
[1:33:41] lentil and the Death Angel is passing
[1:33:45] oh come on somebody
[1:33:49] you know what we mess up
[1:33:51] because we see a lot of people dancing
[1:33:52] and shouting
[1:33:54] and praising God supposedly
[1:33:57] but let me tell you something you can do
[1:33:59] all of that and still be dead
[1:34:04] is that the truth you know when if you
[1:34:08] don't obey the word the death angel is
[1:34:11] going to get you
[1:34:14] I hope this is all right
[1:34:16] this is what he told me to preach and
[1:34:18] here I am
[1:34:19] because it is a serious time you've got
[1:34:23] to have more than speaking in tongues
[1:34:25] you got to have more than shouting you
[1:34:28] got to have more than running up and
[1:34:29] down the aisle and you know I love that
[1:34:32] all
[1:34:33] but you gotta have a life
[1:34:35] and that life has to be Christ
[1:34:43] we we're Beyond
[1:34:46] touch not taste not handle not
[1:34:49] we shouldn't even have to tell you how
[1:34:51] to dress
[1:34:53] we shouldn't even how to tell you not
[1:34:54] how to what not to work or look at all
[1:34:58] that nonsense
[1:34:59] that's baby stuff
[1:35:03] stuff
[1:35:05] y'all hear what I'm saying we won't
[1:35:08] Revival in order for Revival to come you
[1:35:13] must be sanctified
[1:35:16] you can't expect God to give you a
[1:35:19] Revival if your life isn't clean
[1:35:25] oh come on somebody
[1:35:27] I want the real deal
[1:35:29] Hallelujah I don't see Miracle after
[1:35:32] Miracle after Miracle but that don't
[1:35:35] save me when I see the blood when I see
[1:35:38] the token when I see Christ that's when
[1:35:42] I'll pass over you
[1:35:45] Hallelujah
[1:35:49] Lord have mercy
[1:35:51] I'm not interested in her name
[1:35:54] one of the reasons why I moved up to
[1:35:56] Iowa
[1:35:57] it's a it's to escape
[1:36:00] some of the stuff people in the message
[1:36:02] put on you
[1:36:03] you know they they classify you as a one
[1:36:07] as uh you know in the top ten what kind
[1:36:09] of nonsense is that
[1:36:13] Hallelujah you know they they you know
[1:36:15] they put you in this category that you
[1:36:17] know if you ain't a part of this that
[1:36:19] and the other you know you're not
[1:36:20] invited to preach I got a church
[1:36:24] matter of fact God then gave me two
[1:36:27] y'all understand what I'm saying
[1:36:29] so what happens how how
[1:36:32] I'm so concerned right we all I thank
[1:36:35] God for being here don't get me wrong
[1:36:36] but what I'm trying to say is I'm not
[1:36:39] looking for a name
[1:36:40] The Only Name I care about is Jesus
[1:36:43] Christ
[1:36:43] [Music]
[1:36:48] if I would have paid attention to what
[1:36:50] people say to me I wouldn't be dancing
[1:36:52] in the spirit no more
[1:36:55] I wouldn't be raising my voice and
[1:36:57] shouting
[1:36:59] huh
[1:37:01] oh God it's not about you it's about me
[1:37:04] and him
[1:37:05] oh Lord help me Jesus I got to move on
[1:37:08] by the grace of God
[1:37:10] see the thing about this is the greatest
[1:37:12] mystery ever
[1:37:15] and we must understand
[1:37:17] I don't know about you maybe I'm I'm
[1:37:19] crazy
[1:37:20] but I don't want the stuff I see
[1:37:24] the message is right
[1:37:27] but what people have done with it
[1:37:30] I don't want all of that
[1:37:33] no no no no I'm sorry but no I'm not I
[1:37:36] don't want it
[1:37:40] until I see the very life that was in
[1:37:42] the Elijah of our day
[1:37:44] living in US
[1:37:46] now I know we're not prophets but what
[1:37:48] I'm saying the same God
[1:37:51] must live in US
[1:37:56] Hallelujah that's the way I see it
[1:38:00] my wife and I
[1:38:02] a sister from Africa she speak French
[1:38:06] got real sick the other day a couple of
[1:38:08] weeks ago
[1:38:09] they found a mask in her
[1:38:12] they didn't know what it was they didn't
[1:38:15] want to cut on it because they said it
[1:38:16] might explode or whatever the case may
[1:38:18] be
[1:38:19] my wife had a book called the healing
[1:38:21] thoughts where prayers are there
[1:38:23] and and we went to the hospital
[1:38:25] and we had her repeat her son repeated
[1:38:28] to her in French what we were saying in
[1:38:30] English
[1:38:31] don't you know
[1:38:33] God healed that woman
[1:38:40] she was so healed
[1:38:43] they wanted to take her to Mayo Clinic
[1:38:46] to find out what happened
[1:38:51] they don't want to believe in a miracle
[1:38:53] not only did they God healed her but
[1:38:56] cleansed her blood completely
[1:38:59] every test they made on her came up
[1:39:03] clear and clean
[1:39:05] [Music]
[1:39:09] that's the God I serve
[1:39:14] dead
[1:39:18] dead but you don't heard me say that a
[1:39:20] lot
[1:39:21] you know God can be no greater than your
[1:39:24] revelation
[1:39:25] and the Bible said he that cometh to God
[1:39:27] must believe he's he's God he's first
[1:39:29] he's God
[1:39:32] he's God do y'all understand me
[1:39:35] everything is moving by the power of God
[1:39:40] Hallelujah right now you breathe by the
[1:39:45] power of God
[1:39:46] now you got to understand this mystery
[1:39:49] now it's no great it is a mystery
[1:39:52] that God in his creation becomes one
[1:39:56] now let me ask you a question
[1:39:59] how many of you
[1:40:01] have been working on that
[1:40:04] Lord
[1:40:06] make me one with you
[1:40:10] no matter what the cost
[1:40:13] no matter what I must go through
[1:40:16] I want to be like Jesus it's not enough
[1:40:19] to sing it it's got you got to mean this
[1:40:22] thing
[1:40:23] because when you meet it you're going to
[1:40:25] do some suffering
[1:40:27] hello
[1:40:28] you gonna do some suffering but look
[1:40:31] what the suffering is
[1:40:37] I don't care what I gotta suffer
[1:40:40] I told the Lord I don't care what I must
[1:40:42] go through as long as I know you there
[1:40:46] I know that you're there I don't care if
[1:40:48] it's a fiery furnace I don't care if
[1:40:51] it's a lion's den I don't care if this
[1:40:54] is chopping block as long as I know
[1:40:56] you're there I'm all right
[1:40:59] one day I was in my kitchen just
[1:41:01] thinking on the Lord and the Lord spoke
[1:41:04] to me now I hope he speaks to y'all but
[1:41:06] he spoke to me and you know what he said
[1:41:09] I'll never leave you nor will I forsake
[1:41:12] you
[1:41:15] my something happened in that kitchen
[1:41:18] I don't need no music to dance
[1:41:21] I don't need nothing to praise God I
[1:41:23] mean we praise God in that house that's
[1:41:26] why he told me you forgot
[1:41:31] when you worry
[1:41:33] you forget
[1:41:35] that God promised you
[1:41:37] he'll never leave you
[1:41:39] nor forsake you
[1:41:41] right when the bills get so high and you
[1:41:45] can't pay
[1:41:46] and you just worried worried worried
[1:41:49] first of all you done forgot who Daddy
[1:41:51] is
[1:41:52] he owns everything
[1:41:56] y'all hear what I'm saying I'm just
[1:41:58] going to share something with you I I'm
[1:42:01] off my nose but let me share this you
[1:42:04] know people have a bad habit of not
[1:42:05] praying tithing
[1:42:08] I'm sure y'all pastors don't have to
[1:42:09] deal with that
[1:42:15] and most of the time those non-payers
[1:42:19] always want you to pray for them
[1:42:25] and you know what I'm saying
[1:42:27] sometimes you want to say pray for
[1:42:28] yourself
[1:42:35] thank God you don't give me the
[1:42:37] authority to kick him out
[1:42:39] y'all look at me like y'all laughing but
[1:42:41] I'm serious I want my church to be
[1:42:43] blessed
[1:42:44] and the Bible said you're cursed with a
[1:42:46] curse
[1:42:48] Hallelujah okay
[1:42:50] now
[1:42:54] God has never left me nor forsaken me
[1:42:58] and here on on my YouTube
[1:43:02] and a sister from Illinois
[1:43:05] caught the word and from then on she's
[1:43:07] been kind listening to the word from
[1:43:10] Chicago
[1:43:12] and she wrote me and she said brother
[1:43:14] brother uh Pastor Brooks I want to bless
[1:43:17] you
[1:43:19] like you know I'm a little sheepish you
[1:43:21] know about that and she says no no this
[1:43:23] is what God wants me she said but listen
[1:43:25] all glory be to God
[1:43:29] she sent me a check of fifteen thousand
[1:43:31] dollars
[1:43:36] that was the first one
[1:43:40] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:43:42] see when these folks who claim to be
[1:43:45] Christians
[1:43:46] don't know how to pay to I tried some
[1:43:49] one of my brothers say well how can I be
[1:43:51] uh how can I become successful and
[1:43:54] prosperous I'll say pay your tithing
[1:44:00] huh if you really want God to bless you
[1:44:03] believe the word
[1:44:06] you don't worry about bills God will
[1:44:10] come at a moment you expect him not to
[1:44:13] come
[1:44:15] oh my old grandma my own mama and I
[1:44:18] don't mean to go that way but no I'm not
[1:44:20] somebody's pulling me this way my old
[1:44:22] mama I love her she was a Godly woman
[1:44:25] couldn't read nor write
[1:44:27] but I think she was a prophetess or
[1:44:29] something because she had visions
[1:44:31] no she did and she tell me things and I
[1:44:33] was like how in the world she knew that
[1:44:35] but nevertheless
[1:44:37] my mama used to tell me Junior she know
[1:44:40] back in the day I still like to eat but
[1:44:43] back in the day I would love to eat I
[1:44:44] loved eating
[1:44:47] everybody knew they could get me with
[1:44:48] the food
[1:44:55] and uh yeah it's a sad story to that too
[1:44:59] I used to love so eat to eat so much my
[1:45:01] mom would give me her food
[1:45:03] that wasn't good but I didn't know that
[1:45:05] right
[1:45:07] but uh my mom said Junior
[1:45:12] the Lord then showed me
[1:45:14] y'all going to bring some food by this
[1:45:16] house because we were poor very poor
[1:45:19] y'all talking about my bathroom and my
[1:45:22] my change I want we didn't have none of
[1:45:25] that
[1:45:26] one pair of shoe and if that wore out
[1:45:29] you just was
[1:45:30] wore with the socks and everything
[1:45:31] hanging
[1:45:33] but my mom would say
[1:45:36] and this is how I learned
[1:45:38] I didn't see a real Christian until I
[1:45:40] saw my mama
[1:45:41] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:45:43] she was Holy Ghost Field I saw it
[1:45:47] and you know
[1:45:49] sure enough I opened the back door going
[1:45:51] out and there were bags of groceries
[1:45:55] and to this day I don't know who put it
[1:45:57] there
[1:45:58] neither did my mama know
[1:46:00] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:46:02] every time she
[1:46:05] and I'm talking to the young people when
[1:46:08] you got a Holy Ghost Field mama
[1:46:10] or Daddy they know your crowd
[1:46:14] and when they tell you that boy or that
[1:46:17] girl is not your friend you better
[1:46:20] listen
[1:46:20] [Music]
[1:46:22] you better listen because they're going
[1:46:26] to lead you into chaos
[1:46:30] I know what I'm talking about sometimes
[1:46:32] it took a period of years for my mama
[1:46:35] saying to come to pass but every time it
[1:46:39] happened
[1:46:45] I'm talking about the Holy Ghost now
[1:46:49] and don't you squint don't you quench it
[1:46:53] sometime we let church services quench
[1:46:55] us we come to church and we feel it all
[1:46:58] good
[1:46:59] and you get in there and they're singing
[1:47:00] near my God to thee
[1:47:04] because the song leader
[1:47:06] hasn't laid before the Lord
[1:47:10] get up there singing songs and ain't
[1:47:12] even an anointed
[1:47:14] I don't need that
[1:47:17] everybody that comes to church supposed
[1:47:20] to be anointed
[1:47:22] not just a song leader
[1:47:25] you supposed to be anointed bring in
[1:47:28] your lick of Fire
[1:47:31] Hallelujah I guess this is the first
[1:47:34] service always I guess it's all right
[1:47:35] for a foundation
[1:47:38] you know I'm looking at the people of
[1:47:40] God and I know how hot it is and I'm hot
[1:47:42] too and I'm sweating every
[1:47:44] but you know what I'd rather be here
[1:47:46] than in a club
[1:47:53] in Des Moines Iowa they just had this
[1:47:55] bicycle thing
[1:47:57] over 50 000 people
[1:47:59] riding bicycles In the Heat of the day
[1:48:03] half naked some of them
[1:48:06] y'all hear me but they believed in that
[1:48:09] and you can't even get a Christian
[1:48:12] to stand on a corner with you no more
[1:48:15] to preach the gospel
[1:48:18] that's why I learned to preach it wasn't
[1:48:20] in a Pulpit
[1:48:22] it was on the streets
[1:48:25] now
[1:48:27] you tell people about witnessing they
[1:48:29] look like they lost
[1:48:31] they don't know what to do
[1:48:33] when you witness for Jesus let me tell
[1:48:36] you what you do
[1:48:37] open your mouth
[1:48:43] if you open your mouth God will speak
[1:48:46] for you
[1:48:49] I'm almost done I'm almost done I'm
[1:48:51] sorry
[1:48:52] uh you keep pulling like that we'll be
[1:48:55] doing what I was told not to do
[1:48:58] see
[1:48:59] in my nose the whole thing is God and
[1:49:02] man one
[1:49:04] God and man
[1:49:06] that's what God wants one
[1:49:09] a wonders with man
[1:49:12] a Oneness
[1:49:14] and he the only way that could ever
[1:49:16] happen is that we must be filled with
[1:49:19] this spirit
[1:49:21] so I'm gonna say something
[1:49:24] because remember
[1:49:27] that Covenant changed with Moses
[1:49:32] and so we had the seven Church ages
[1:49:35] and God did a new thing
[1:49:38] so where is the blood now
[1:49:42] you hear me
[1:49:44] and the reason why I'm saying what I'm
[1:49:46] saying
[1:49:47] because if you don't follow the pillar
[1:49:49] fire
[1:49:50] you'll miss it
[1:49:52] Hallelujah
[1:49:54] because they're going to be a lot of
[1:49:57] people Mr rapture
[1:49:59] because they think they're under the
[1:50:01] blood
[1:50:03] Hallelujah
[1:50:05] see but the blood speaks
[1:50:09] better things than Abel y'all hear me
[1:50:12] and when you get people who say I'm
[1:50:14] under the blood and all they want is
[1:50:17] Revenge
[1:50:18] talk about people
[1:50:21] backbiting all these negative things
[1:50:24] well you're not under the blood of Jesus
[1:50:29] Christ
[1:50:31] oh come on somebody
[1:50:33] check your yo yo your salvation look
[1:50:36] into your soul look into your heart it's
[1:50:40] later than you think
[1:50:43] it's the truth
[1:50:45] and you and I must know who we are if I
[1:50:49] die right now I know where I'm going
[1:50:56] you got to know
[1:50:58] and because you young Don't Mean a Thing
[1:51:01] young graves are out there too all
[1:51:04] graves are out there too right religion
[1:51:07] won't do it oh I follow Prophet it
[1:51:10] doesn't matter
[1:51:12] Millions followed
[1:51:15] and we're dead
[1:51:19] Hallelujah
[1:51:21] you love the Lord
[1:51:22] I'm trying to get her somewhere I know
[1:51:24] this sound Elementary but that's what he
[1:51:25] wants me to say
[1:51:27] because we've got to come to a
[1:51:28] realization
[1:51:30] we can't fool ourselves no longer
[1:51:35] your education Ain't Gonna Save You
[1:51:38] because you know all Mysteries won't
[1:51:40] save you either
[1:51:41] if you don't have love or charity for
[1:51:43] your brothers and sisters forget it
[1:51:45] what are you talking about
[1:51:47] well see they go over to that church
[1:51:50] what do you say
[1:51:52] when that church became the church
[1:51:57] you know who the church is you are
[1:52:01] Blood Washed Holy Ghost filled
[1:52:04] there are no walls
[1:52:07] with the New Testament Church
[1:52:10] the draw the True Church of God don't
[1:52:12] care where you assemble
[1:52:15] Hallelujah if you name the name of Jesus
[1:52:19] Christ we are on the same side
[1:52:23] see I knew I wasn't going to get too
[1:52:24] many from the preachers but that's the
[1:52:26] truth
[1:52:31] there were things in Corinthians that
[1:52:32] that Ephesus didn't agree with
[1:52:35] right throughout the church two men
[1:52:38] ain't gonna believe and see the same
[1:52:39] thing but we do have one thing in common
[1:52:42] that is the calvary that is the blood of
[1:52:45] Jesus
[1:52:46] right and that organization that
[1:52:49] denominational Spirit if you're not
[1:52:51] careful of it will send you straight to
[1:52:52] hell
[1:52:54] now I don't care who you are the truth
[1:52:57] is the truth
[1:52:58] you got to even love the unlovable
[1:53:04] this got to be different
[1:53:06] it cannot be the same
[1:53:12] see it's the truth
[1:53:15] like the word of God said think on these
[1:53:18] things
[1:53:20] because the truth of the matter is we're
[1:53:23] too
[1:53:25] united we must be United it's a system
[1:53:30] it's a system we develop
[1:53:32] and your system better than mine
[1:53:35] when they are wrong
[1:53:36] when Israel developed a system God said
[1:53:39] you stink in my nostrils you even listen
[1:53:42] let me ask you a question when the last
[1:53:44] time you had communion how many times
[1:53:47] you where were the weepers
[1:53:49] were anybody crying and broken
[1:53:52] you understand me communion ain't just
[1:53:54] taking wine and eating bread
[1:53:57] it's sacred
[1:54:01] and there's supposed to be some
[1:54:02] heartfelt something in that
[1:54:06] and if you're not feeling it you just
[1:54:09] systematically doing it
[1:54:12] that's the same with worship I should
[1:54:14] never have to say oh raise your hand
[1:54:18] you know what I'm saying I should never
[1:54:20] have to say oh y'all stand up and clap
[1:54:23] that's insanity
[1:54:26] that's not the Holy Ghost
[1:54:29] when the Holy Ghost came they were
[1:54:31] jumping out of Windows running up and
[1:54:34] down the streets saying he's alive he's
[1:54:37] alive he's alive nobody
[1:54:40] you can never be a real Christian and a
[1:54:43] shame of the Holy Ghost
[1:54:48] you got to let go God let go and let God
[1:54:51] have his way we don't got so starchy
[1:54:56] I love music
[1:54:58] but music is not what turns me on
[1:55:03] Jesus
[1:55:05] the name of Jesus
[1:55:07] oh my God how sweet is the name of Jesus
[1:55:13] you love the Lord
[1:55:15] and it's the truth
[1:55:17] it's the truth
[1:55:19] nobody has no preeminence over here
[1:55:22] we're all one body we
[1:55:24] think about it if we would all unite
[1:55:27] under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost
[1:55:29] what we could do
[1:55:34] I tell my own church that I've got two
[1:55:37] churches most of them are Congolese
[1:55:39] people
[1:55:40] the saddest thing about that party is
[1:55:42] they all tribals different tribes
[1:55:47] hello I'm almost done because I can see
[1:55:49] you drying but my my my my point is this
[1:55:54] I told him I said it's a shame
[1:55:56] that y'all are prejudiced against each
[1:55:58] other
[1:56:01] that tried One Tribe better than the
[1:56:04] other tribe
[1:56:06] this tribe came Mario tribe
[1:56:09] hey I don't mean no harm y'all all black
[1:56:18] I can't tell no difference
[1:56:22] you know what I'm saying
[1:56:26] that makes no sense
[1:56:29] it makes no sense
[1:56:34] I get in trouble
[1:56:37] because I'm like Paul
[1:56:40] I preach against all that traditional
[1:56:43] things
[1:56:44] who don't mess with my tradition I said
[1:56:46] I don't care if you've got Traditions
[1:56:47] but don't make that tradition like it's
[1:56:50] the word
[1:56:52] yeah as long as it's your tradition keep
[1:56:55] it
[1:56:57] oh y'all y'all getting quiet on me but
[1:56:59] what I'm trying to say
[1:57:01] if you're not careful you'll pick up a
[1:57:04] church spirit and that church spin will
[1:57:07] become your tradition
[1:57:09] we don't need Church Spirits we need the
[1:57:13] Holy Ghost
[1:57:14] we need the Holy Ghost in fire
[1:57:18] Hallelujah the kind that don't care
[1:57:21] about what everybody else says but if
[1:57:24] God says I'm going to praise I'm going
[1:57:26] to praise you give him the praise
[1:57:31] Hallelujah
[1:57:34] Hallelujah
[1:57:36] people say oh I love the message and you
[1:57:39] don't even listen to the tapes and all
[1:57:40] that no more but you listen to your
[1:57:42] preacher how do you know he preaching
[1:57:44] you the right thing
[1:57:45] you don't read your Bible anyway
[1:57:48] oh come on somebody
[1:57:50] it becomes a tradition
[1:57:52] oh Lord help me Jesus
[1:57:55] you love the Lord
[1:57:57] I'm almost done
[1:57:59] look like God had me anyway
[1:58:03] when
[1:58:07] how many of y'all understand what I'm
[1:58:08] trying to say
[1:58:13] breaking through the system is not easy
[1:58:16] it's something I had to do
[1:58:19] I refuse to be a part of this system
[1:58:25] I'm gonna love everybody
[1:58:28] I'm gonna Fellowship where God wants me
[1:58:31] to Fellowship
[1:58:32] you're not going to have no walls around
[1:58:34] me
[1:58:37] I experienced that in that
[1:58:38] denominational Church you go over there
[1:58:40] you're going to be sat down well Set Me
[1:58:43] Down
[1:58:44] because if God tells me to go over there
[1:58:46] I'm going over there y'all hear me my my
[1:58:50] birth wasn't given to me by a man
[1:58:55] somebody help me here my birth was given
[1:58:58] to me by Christ Jesus himself
[1:59:07] maybe I'm out of line but
[1:59:10] I got to preach it like you tell me
[1:59:13] I look at this thing and I said hey we
[1:59:15] got to come up out of this
[1:59:17] people are dying
[1:59:21] what y'all gonna do with these young
[1:59:23] people that need God
[1:59:26] oh don't you know they they acting save
[1:59:29] many of them
[1:59:31] they act like it
[1:59:34] most of them are not
[1:59:36] and y'all know it
[1:59:38] but as parents what are you doing
[1:59:41] you better get them to the Holy Ghost
[1:59:48] oh they're fake speaking in tongues on
[1:59:50] you
[1:59:52] they know how to do it because it's a
[1:59:54] system
[1:59:58] and listen people
[1:59:59] I know what I'm talking about because I
[2:00:00] had daughters to do me that way I
[2:00:03] literally thought they had the Holy
[2:00:04] Ghost when they didn't have it
[2:00:07] y'all understand me
[2:00:11] this is a serious time
[2:00:14] a very serious time and and I'm like
[2:00:18] Abraham I don't want to leave nobody
[2:00:20] behind
[2:00:23] but I'm gonna tell you this and I'm
[2:00:25] gonna close
[2:00:27] if you want a Revival
[2:00:30] you got to have a Revival in your home
[2:00:32] first
[2:00:36] then you bring your Revival from home to
[2:00:39] church
[2:00:41] right how do you know you get all out
[2:00:44] all the wicked stuff out of your house
[2:00:47] that's hard
[2:00:49] get all that wicked stuff
[2:00:52] all that Hollywood influence out of your
[2:00:54] house
[2:00:55] oh Jesus let me tell you something it's
[2:00:58] going to burn up anyway so you might as
[2:01:01] well get it out while you have a chance
[2:01:03] get all that Wicked y'all know what
[2:01:05] y'all know what you got
[2:01:08] it's the truth
[2:01:11] and and it's bad it's so bad
[2:01:16] that our children can be doing all kinds
[2:01:18] of evil stuff
[2:01:20] in the Holy Ghost Field House and you
[2:01:23] don't even know it
[2:01:27] where is your Holy Ghost
[2:01:30] your holy ghost sounds the alarm
[2:01:33] is that right when my children was
[2:01:36] coming up I could walk in the house and
[2:01:38] know it was a change
[2:01:40] I'm like oh what's that
[2:01:42] when something went wrong my wife would
[2:01:44] tell you I I looked at me first what did
[2:01:47] I do then I talk to her right and if
[2:01:51] we're both cleaned in what's going on
[2:01:54] Hallelujah
[2:01:56] we go hunting
[2:01:59] and I went hunting
[2:02:03] I opened the closet door and I found a
[2:02:07] bad book
[2:02:09] yeah reading looking at it whatever they
[2:02:12] doing
[2:02:15] and you know what my son told me
[2:02:18] he got it from a message believer's
[2:02:20] house
[2:02:25] y'all hear what I'm saying
[2:02:27] I don't took too long
[2:02:29] but my heart I poured into it
[2:02:32] I love the people of God
[2:02:34] I don't care how bad you are
[2:02:37] I still love you
[2:02:39] because God loved me when I was bad
[2:02:42] you all hear what I'm saying
[2:02:44] I tell my church I know some of y'all
[2:02:46] ain't doing right but I still love you
[2:02:48] right I'm not gonna have a bad attitude
[2:02:52] I still love you and I'm going to treat
[2:02:55] you like you you you're not doing
[2:02:57] anything wrong
[2:02:58] I'm gonna love you to death
[2:03:03] huh y'all hear what I'm saying
[2:03:06] how many times your mama did that
[2:03:08] or your daddy let's let's stand I'm
[2:03:11] sorry
[2:03:12] I just feel like uh
[2:03:14] I I just felt I can't explain it
[2:03:18] but I trust that that something was said
[2:03:20] tonight
[2:03:22] I tried to get to my notes and I just
[2:03:24] couldn't get to my notes
[2:03:27] but I say this to you we
[2:03:29] we're not indebted to the flesh
[2:03:33] but one thing for certain
[2:03:35] like that song say how much do I owe
[2:03:39] I cannot tell
[2:03:41] how much I owe
[2:03:43] God has been so good to us
[2:03:46] those of you who have traveled
[2:03:49] you come and God has blessed you with
[2:03:52] your strength your health
[2:03:55] do me do me a favor if if possible
[2:03:59] we got other ministers coming
[2:04:02] tonight make it your night
[2:04:06] rededicate yourself
[2:04:09] sincerely get before God
[2:04:12] we talk about seeing milkers I believe
[2:04:14] we will be able to see God move in that
[2:04:17] way
[2:04:18] if we can just clean up and and and get
[2:04:21] before God and come back tomorrow night
[2:04:23] or where you can do it tonight but I'm
[2:04:25] saying when you do come back tomorrow
[2:04:26] night come back with a clean slate
[2:04:29] you've confessed your sins you've done
[2:04:31] all you can do before the Lord so that
[2:04:33] when God comes through
[2:04:36] Hallelujah you'll be blessed
[2:04:39] I don't know what tomorrow is going to
[2:04:41] bring but I I just believe that this is
[2:04:44] going to be perhaps the greatest of all
[2:04:46] the meetings
[2:04:48] I believe that
[2:04:50] and and I'm hoping that
[2:04:52] and I'm not talking about the singing
[2:04:54] and shouting we done had some good times
[2:04:55] in that
[2:04:56] but I mean change
[2:05:00] this is what I teach my church I said
[2:05:02] you come to church for change
[2:05:06] [Music]
[2:05:08] don't leave without the change
[2:05:12] that's what you come for
[2:05:15] that's what I go for
[2:05:18] ah I come here to be changed even more
[2:05:21] so
[2:05:22] you love the Lord
[2:05:25] Hallelujah God is good to us I
[2:05:28] appreciate our brother Simmons
[2:05:31] I appreciate the men of God
[2:05:34] I know some of y'all so can't I won't
[2:05:37] say it like that you're going to
[2:05:38] misunderstand what I was saying
[2:05:41] you give honor to your pastor
[2:05:44] your pastor is
[2:05:46] your spiritual leader
[2:05:49] the Holy Ghost is his
[2:05:53] ah I'm not trying to tell you to run
[2:05:55] here and there
[2:05:57] but they that are led by the spirit
[2:06:00] they are the sons of God
[2:06:03] and I believe that if I was under a
[2:06:05] Ministry and I felt like God was leading
[2:06:07] me to do something I would go to my
[2:06:09] pastor and let him know what I was going
[2:06:11] to do
[2:06:12] because if God is doing it
[2:06:15] he will agree
[2:06:16] if it's a Spirit-filled man
