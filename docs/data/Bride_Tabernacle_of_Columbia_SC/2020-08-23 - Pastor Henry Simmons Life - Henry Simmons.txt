oh god thou art my god early will i seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longest for thee in a dry and a thirsty land where no water is to see thou power in thy glory so as i have seen thee in the sanctuary because thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thus will i bless thee while i live i will lift up my hands in thy name god bless you reading the word you may be seated amen hallelujah somebody said i bless the lord at all times his praise shall be continually in my lips so we thank god that we can praise him in the midst of this pandemic in the midst of this crooked and perverse generation amen there's somebody that would praise the lord in spite of what they've been through in spite of what they're going through there'll be somebody that would tell god i thank you for being in the number one more time so i'm glad to be in the number one more time amen somebody said i could have been cut off and gone but i'm in the number one more time lord i'm glad to be in the number one more time so david here talks about thy loving kindness is better than life amen so he went to take a love to amen uh uh deeper than just the human aspect of life yesterday i had a i said a young man in his 40s we were ministering his sermon and talking about life and i said i thought i'd continue to talk about life because life could be fleeing it's very short for the many young men twin boys just got killed on fire road they were just 29. amen right down the street so we don't know amen your time amen but god that uh he's appointed to man amen wants to die and after that the judgment you have an appointed time you have an appointment to be with god and one day amen you gonna have to make that appointment so by the grace of god if you're not ready at that time ready or not amen it's not high and gold seed but here i come death will meet you somewhere amen amen and you got to be ready ain't meant to face it amen but there's no fear in love want to talk about life and life intertwines with love but there's no fear in love for perfect love cast out fear amen one of the components of of death is is the fear of death but there's no fear in love for perfect love cast out fear but perfect love don't come from beneath but perfect love come from above so when we talked this morning about life i said you know what is a life amen and do you have life because we want to just because you're sitting here uh you know in in the medical terminology we were learning how to take pulse and how to take your blood pressure and how to amend no uh by the heartbeat about it breathing whether or not so we look at the chest and how they're responding and we'll tell how many times you breathe in and out and will determine amen uh you know if you're living the first thing they do is they try to find out whether you got any pulse or not so we think life is having pulse and breathing and so forth and uh a lot of times when your hearts stop they meant then folks say well you're dead and sometimes when your brain stops functioning we call it brain dead so uh there's many appointed amen that determines whether or not in the nature what are you living or what do you do amen but well i i i'm saying this morning are you dead or are you alive do you have life or are you dead so i want to talk about life and eternal life the greek word for life is zoe that means god's own life amen and then that that that's a love they meant that we call feeling your love and that's a love for one's uh uh a wife and feeling your love and that's the love that only god can give and that is a god pay love that's god's love feeling your love that love that you have for your wife of somebody treats her wrong you might amen uh uh uh uh try to abuse your wife you might kill him whether god pay love that you have you'll forgive that person that insults your wife are you with me you pray for their soul that god will have mercy on them are you with me but uh uh feeling your lover calls you amen uh uh it's a jealousy amen it can produce that's human love amen and you can be jealous and so forth whether god paid love you passed the stage of jealousy and all of that amen so by the grace of god god wants to take you to a higher form amen uh of life uh zoe it's god's own life it's eternal life amen eternal life means you have no beginning and you have no end amen but that's that's the kind of life that's only god can give you that kind of life amen but we find that that was a a a separate let's go to john 5 and 24 amen john 5 and 24. so by the grace of god we we come to stages with with uh man we we're talking about life and we're talking about when we talk about life and we talk about uh love amen because you can't talk about life and not intertwine it with love because amen because when we talk about real genuine life that's only god it comes from god and god is love are you with me so as we think on that amen we think on love that's like like i say there's a video and there's a god pain and then there's another type of what we call love and that's what most people and young people especially are caught up in lust and they call us a form of love i love you because i love how you look and not love amen uh uh because a person does not have their god pay love then there's another kind of love that takes over it meant because a man thirsts for the living god and not in the inside it's a it's a thirst for god amen and and if you don't uh have god's love there then there's another type of love amen that takes the place that we try to fill that void and we're trying to fill that thirst with lust and not because uh the love of god is not in you amen and then there's an emptiness there amen then we try to feel that desire amen that thirst amen with the pornography and all kind of stuff because of the empty place because agape love is not there and god's love is not there amen so we began to engage in all kind of uh essential things and lust for things and amen we got to begin to try to fill they met the void and the thirst that's in the inside of us because amen we won't let god take his right place a position in our lives and if god is not taking that place then it gotta amen you gotta try to feel that thirst and that desire with some kind of event a love but it's only imitation it will not last it will not hold up it will not satisfy you are you with me the soul will never the thirst and the soul will never be satisfied amen just what feeling yo amen just with a lust for tight love it would not be satisfied so it will fill amen with that god paid love and amen with the life that only comes from zoe god's own life if we have that kind of life down inside of us amen then amen brothers and sisters we can go forth amen but we got to have that zoy tight life the life of god down in his side and jesus said amen i won't quote saint john 14 but jesus said i am the way the truth and the life and that is eternal life that's god's own life amen i am the life amen so jesus offered us amen i go to prepare a place for you there is a place for you in that place that god has prepared he said i will not amen let not your hearts be troubled amen don't be troubled amen we're trouble and be perplexed about many things amen but god said don't let your heart be troubled amen because we're troubled amen and we'll burn them and and we're trying to understand life and they're trying they meant to we'll make it through life and and life has its ups and downs and it's disappointments amen but amen but this life you'll never be disappointed with jesus christ in who is our life golovkin said christ who is our life when he shall appear amen and i want the love of god the life of jesus christ to appear to you and i that's what took away that voidness that emptiness that thirst that life even jesus christ in our life has appeared to us we have seen his love for us amen so by the grace of god it says here in uh saint john 5 and 24 he says verily verily i say unto you he that hears my word and believing on him that sent me has everlasting life are you with me if you believe the word of god amen i i want you to know that you have everlasting life amen and that life amen produces a character the way you know that you have that eternal life inside of you amen it's identified by its own characteristics it's action your emotion prove that there's something inside of you that can forgive those that uh persecute your speak all manner even against you falsely you can have something down in the inside that would say father forgive them because they don't understand what they do amen because you got something that proves they meant that you have another nature another character you don't have your own life you have his life amen believe on him shall not come into condemnation on judgment but his past from what your past from death to life amen we were all dead and trespassing our sin as i said on yesterday the bible says in adam all died amen every one of us that we're in adam amen all died in adam amen and we find in romans uh five it says that uh for by one man disobedient many were made sinners they met because adam and eve amen because when adam ate up the tree of knowledge and good and even he ate up the tree amen they died because jesus god said the day you eat of the tree they meant that day you'll die they made they didn't physically die that same physical day but that same spiritual day with god for one day with god is that a thousand years and a thousand years there's one day no man has never lived one day in god's sight they meant but look methuselah lived 969 years but he died amen so no man lived a thousand years what god promised amen that there will be a day amen that the children of god will be reconciled back to god and there'll be a day amen called the millennium rain the 1 000 years rain that will reign with him a thousand years they meant we'll live a thousand years amen so here god is gonna renew amen because amen when adam and eve sinned amen god put cherubim to amend to keep them from the tree of life amen he said at least they come and eat of the tree of life and live forever so he put them out of the garden amen and god he meant put amen his divine for living creatures amen and he put uh matthew mark luke and john he put the amen the lion amen he put he met the ox he put the man and he put the eagle there he meant to protect the way to the tree of life and that tree of life was the book of acts amen where the holy ghost fell and where the power was so that we can eat of the tree of life amen the tree of life is the gospel of jesus christ amen jesus said i am the bread that came down from heaven if a man eat of this bread he'll never die amen he said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life whatever you eat amen he said now amen i don't want you to think he meant this physical thing the amen but i want you to know uh amen the word is spirit and the word is life amen eat the word of god amen and you live forever amen you don't have to die if you eat this bread you'll never die if you eat the flesh of the son of man amen you never die amen hallelujah we're not feeding on a man amen but we're feeding no none by the word of the son of man it's the word of god that we're feeding on and where the is is that where the eagles be gathered amen this is fresh manner for you and i this is the eagle age amen and this eagle age is to come back the pale horse rider of death and hell are you with me oh you eagles amen that you mine up your wings amen and realize amen that you have an obligation and a job to do amen this amen when death is riding through the land amen now also there's an eagle anointing and that eagle anointing has given life to the bride of the anointing that's on the people of god and not anointing or the holy ghost caused the eagle so do they fly above all the winds and stones of life amen and to be able to exemplify and to manifest amen what a son or daughter god is we are the overcomers in the sage we can walk in victory we can conquer our doubts we can conquer our field we can walk and be holy holy unto the lord are you with me god is calling amen holy ghost filled people i want you to see your past from death to life so as that separation and many times in terminology we said death is to be separated from god and man by sin was separated from god and because of sin we were separated from god and we needed to be united back to god amen uh sin separates but love amen unites amen the love of god jesus came amen to the chasma and the separating amen that we couldn't get back to god we couldn't eat of the tree of a life eternal life amen but god made a way through his son through jesus christ that we could get back to the tree of life and amen so jesus christ said amen if a man believe on him for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son the whosoever believe in him should not perish but have eternal life have everlasting life are you with me so god made a way that you can get back to uh amen that what separated us amen would not keep us separated from him amen sin will keep you separated sin will keep avoid there but love in that praise god the love of god would bring us back bring us back into fellowship bring us back into unity bring us back into oneness in god amen and rachel put up that we can rest in peace amen in god amen we can have the peace of god we don't have to worry about getting up out of the grave amen but we can rest in peace then the resurrection morning when death prison bars are broken we shall rise hallelujah we shall rise amen there's gonna come a time amen when the chains of death we don't have to fear anymore we don't have to be afraid anymore amen because why amen but he said in revelation 21 and 8 but the fearful and abominable amen and adulterers and fornicators and all liars going to be thrown in the lake of fire amen which is the second death are you with me praise god amen but here god amen through jesus christ amen came amen what death calls sin calls the death amen and because of what that called amen god came he meant to die amen for our sins he met the bridge the cap he met he come to amen uh abolished enmity it meant oh he come to take care amen and to be that lamb that sacrifice amen to bring us back to god to pay the price amen uh amen that adam amen lost amen holy god became a flesh they meant to die on the cross he that knew no sin was made sin for us that we might be made the righteousness of god in him amen god has made you righteous god has sanctified you holy god has took taking your place he took our place oh yes it is oh hallelujah what uh what a people we ought to be so as we look at the aspect amen the agape love the different types of of love and life i want to say life is what controls uh life is what controls our emotions life is what gives you your emotions because then you are known amen everybody know you by your emotion by the way you act the way you act the people say i know you amen what what your life is manifesting that and what they see you what what and what you saying amen people begin to know you by your emotions not only that but your emotions make up what you are and is your life and what kind of character should be we be if we claim to have eternal life what kind of character should we have if we claim we got eternal life what kind of character should we have now there's only one type of eternal life and that is god life that was the great spirit in the beginning the seven spirits of god like seven rainbow colors each spirit comes off of it perverts and come down are you with me so that great fountain of love that seven i i wonder why some folk want to use the rainbow knowing that that's god covenant knowing that that great fountain of love you know sometimes the devil would pervert what god has but god nevertheless the foundation of god's standards issue having the seal the lord knows them that are his god knows his own children as i conclude this morning it's very short so as i conclude i want to go to romans 8. romans 8 and um life and i want to say that first corinthians tells us 15 and 21 right around there says for in adam all died even so in christ shall all be made alive are you with me so brothers and sisters if you're not in christ you're dead i was dead but what makes me alive is jesus christ in the inside everybody that's born of a woman was born in sin shaped it in the nicotine and the bible said the wages of sin is death so you were born still born you're born dead that's why you needed life and jesus come to resurrect us from the dead that's why in ephesians said you has he quickened you had been made alive which was dead and trespassed in sin david said i was born in sin i was shaping an iniquity and then saying that my mother conceived me that's why he said a man that is born of a woman that's why he said in me paul says it mean that is in my flesh dwelling no good thing i was corrupt but through jesus christ he wants to give us make us incorruptable formulating immortality are you with me but we got to let him feel that void in that place but are we still lusting after evil things and after the world he said if any man loved the world amen there's a lot of pledge out if any man love the world the love of the father is what not in him so if god is not in you because you love the world you love pornography you love all kind of filth and all kind of fornication and adultery the love of god is not in you don't fool yourself are you with me the love of god is not in you you still need god in you amen the devil knows amen amen if the house is filled it meant you got to blind the strong man and no devil no demon in hell i don't care what seven demons he come with he can't bind jesus amen he can come back seven times worse amen but if jesus is down look out there amen when the enemy come in like a flood the bible said the spirit of the lord but what lift up a standing against him isn't that right so don't you come to my i tried you know you tried but don't let don't you can't you couldn't save yourself you couldn't make yourself a saint amen you nothing that you and i could do they meant to bridge the gap to bring us back to god to give us eternal life is what jesus done for us then you got to trust god and you got to say greater is he that's in me than he that is in the world love not the world neither the things of the world amen don't get satisfied with this world and it's images pleasures and these things because the world's going to pass away and the lust thereof are you with me but god loves our god pay love i'm waiting on my change i know my change is coming i know one day this mortal must put on immortality and this corruptible must put on incorrection i know one day the grave won't be able to hold me hallelujah i know god is moving now amen he's quickening us by his spirit his power is real his love is real amen he's real in my soul amen so many people doubt him i can't live without him that is why i love him so he's so real to me hallelujah i love the lord i love the lord he heard my cry amen i was sick and deep in sin fought from the peaceful shores but the master loved the sea heard my despair and cry and from the water lifting me not safe am i so glad to be saved so glad that he lifted me so glad that he got me out of the mocking mario so glad that he came to see about me i'm glad he saw about me i'm so glad that he jesus is dancing he's the answer amen i don't have to stumble in darkness no more i asked upon was to get ready as i come to my clothes romans 8 and 35. 33 says who shall lay anything to the charge of god delay it is god that justifies who is he that condemn it is christ the god yay brother that is risen again who's even at the right hand of god are also making the intercession for us who shall separate us from what from the love of god love of christ who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation come on just think about when you leave god what you're leaving him for he said i'll never leave you neither will i forsake you when you leave god there's a weapon is it worth it for what you settling our god for is your 30 pieces of civil warfare amen what what is the devil offering you that seems to be so enticing that seem to be so good that you give up eternal life for it oh lord amen as the prophet said that you're going to be questioned what did you do with the life that god gave you he's going to ask you one day what did you do with the life that i gave you you sold it to the devil you you sold it for a monster of meat he saw solid birth right for a monster meat amen he turned life don't mean much to you the holy ghost don't mean much to you amen but i want you to know amen you need the token life of god you need the holy ghost amen this is the whole lord god doesn't he's done too much for us in this age god sent us a pill of fire a cloud and god sent a messenger angel the supernatural has come and visited us in this generation what what what we settling out for love of christ just revelation or distress or persecution fame and enactness of pearls or swords as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long for we are counted as sheep for the slaughter amen that's all right kill me if you wanna amen we're counting the sheep to the slaughter but nothing
