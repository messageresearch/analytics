[39:49] the manifestation in the Vindication of
[39:51] the promise
[39:53] what God promised you in this hour that
[39:56] we're living in then you need to be
[39:58] looking forward he told them when Jesus
[40:01] rose from the dead he said carry you in
[40:03] the city of Jerusalem and wait there
[40:05] until you're being due with power from
[40:08] on high
[40:09] praise God they waited there amen under
[40:12] expectation we must be waiting on the
[40:15] expectation looking for God to fulfill
[40:18] what he said
[40:20] praise God and then when the day of
[40:22] Pentecost was fully come they were
[40:24] always one Accord in one place and
[40:26] suddenly there came a sign from Heaven
[40:28] as of a Russian Mighty Wind and it
[40:30] filled all the house where they were
[40:32] setting and they appeared unto them
[40:34] clothes and tongues locked out the fire
[40:36] in a shot upon each of them and they
[40:39] were filled with the Holy Ghost and
[40:40] began to speak with tongues and they
[40:43] heard them speak in their own language
[40:45] they were Jews about men out of every
[40:47] nation they met there were medes and
[40:49] Pastor lights and elamites and dwellers
[40:51] in Mesopotamian Cappadocia opponents and
[40:54] phrase and plant philia it was from all
[40:57] over amen they came together they heard
[41:00] them speak in their own language
[41:03] amen and then somebody said amen because
[41:07] they were starting and they looked like
[41:09] they were drunk but they heard them
[41:11] speak in their own language and they
[41:13] said not all these that speak Godly and
[41:16] how here we have a man in our own
[41:18] language
[41:19] there's something about the way they
[41:22] spoke they met because they knew that
[41:24] they didn't understand
[41:26] amen our language but yet we can hear
[41:29] them speak in our own language
[41:32] they knew that it was a great happening
[41:34] and there was a miracle in their mission
[41:37] but they could not understand the
[41:40] fullness of what was going on
[41:42] and they said they must be full of new
[41:46] wine but Peter's standing up with 11
[41:49] said these men are not drunk as ye
[41:52] supposed a sin it is but the third hour
[41:55] of the day but he said this is that
[41:59] which was spoken of by the prophet Joel
[42:02] that in the last days said God that I
[42:06] apart my spirit upon All Flesh
[42:11] they had a promise
[42:14] amen and God Amen was fulfilling his
[42:19] promised word
[42:20] and I said we have a promise amen the

[1:26:54] God is good
[1:26:56] okay take your five minutes and close
[1:26:58] them
[1:27:09] I said didn't turn me off said Karen get
[1:27:12] through your time up
[1:27:15] thank you
[1:27:22] Lord have mercy
[1:27:24] God is good
[1:27:26] amen
[1:27:28] may we thank the Lord for the service
[1:27:30] this morning and thank the Lord for what
[1:27:32] he spoke this morning and really just
[1:27:34] understanding that that he really cares
[1:27:37] and that he really is trying to tell you
[1:27:39] the truth many of the lessons that he
[1:27:41] tells you this morning he told me he
[1:27:44] tells me every day I go back and I ask
[1:27:46] him ask him how to do certain things
[1:27:48] because people before you they have
[1:27:50] wisdom
[1:27:51] because they've experienced it they've
[1:27:54] been through it they don't understood
[1:27:55] what you trying to go through and what
[1:27:57] you're trying to do they've already been
[1:27:59] through it or they've seen someone that
[1:28:00] went through it and they've seen the end
[1:28:02] of it they see where it ends up and now
[1:28:04] you look back and they can tell you
[1:28:06] about it before you get there so you
[1:28:07] don't have to go that way you don't have
[1:28:09] to go down those Pathways and those
[1:28:11] roads and figure out where it's going to
[1:28:12] end up because they can tell you about
[1:28:14] it so sometimes you got to open your
[1:28:16] ears and just listen
[1:28:17] there's some advice that I didn't
[1:28:19] believe was true
[1:28:21] but I listened I didn't find out till
[1:28:23] years later and had the experience that
[1:28:26] what he said was true
[1:28:27] and sometimes you may not see it in the
[1:28:30] immediate but you should listen now so
[1:28:31] you don't have to go through it you
[1:28:33] don't have to experience it because
[1:28:34] they're telling you the truth they only
[1:28:36] tell you that because they care about
[1:28:38] you they only tell you that is because
[1:28:40] they want to see the best thing for you
[1:28:42] but you looking around and say I'm gonna
[1:28:43] listen to my friends your friends don't
[1:28:46] know much they haven't lived long enough
[1:28:48] to experience enough to know what
[1:28:50] they're talking about so you listen to
[1:28:52] people that's older than you you listen
[1:28:54] to your parents you might not you might
[1:28:56] look at them and say well they ain't got
[1:28:57] everything together that's okay they
[1:29:00] still working and God's still working on
[1:29:01] them God's still developing them and all
[1:29:04] you got to do is pray for them that God
[1:29:05] will lead them so that they can lead you
[1:29:07] you don't know what they may be going
[1:29:09] through and everything that life is
[1:29:11] brought forth to them but you listen to
[1:29:13] them and say Lord God you lead them so
[1:29:15] that they can lead me
[1:29:17] see there's things that you should
[1:29:18] listen to you should go back and you
[1:29:20] should ask questions because you don't
[1:29:22] know everything even though you may look
[1:29:24] up on the Internet Because the Internet
[1:29:26] is available now and you can look up
[1:29:28] things that still ain't gonna give you
[1:29:30] everything that you want to know that's
[1:29:32] still not going to give you the real
[1:29:33] life experience that someone can tell
[1:29:35] you because they've done seen it they
[1:29:38] don't experience it and they can come
[1:29:39] back and tell you see that's why we go
[1:29:41] back and we ask those that are above us
[1:29:43] we go talk to people we ask them we say
[1:29:46] what do you think about this how can you
[1:29:48] how should I go about this because they
[1:29:50] have that wisdom and God has given it to
[1:29:52] them God has allowed you to be around
[1:29:54] people that can give you sound advice
[1:29:57] God has allowed you to be around people
[1:29:59] and bless you with people that have
[1:30:01] things and care about you enough to tell
[1:30:03] you there's some people that don't have
[1:30:05] that in their life they don't have no
[1:30:07] one around you to tell you they don't
[1:30:09] have no one around you to say hey don't
[1:30:10] do this this is where you're gonna end
[1:30:12] up you're gonna end up in jail you're
[1:30:14] gonna end up in prison you're gonna end
[1:30:15] up dead
[1:30:17] but you if you keep going the way that
[1:30:19] you're going
[1:30:20] but there's people around you that care
[1:30:21] about you and say don't go that way
[1:30:23] don't hang around those people you said
[1:30:25] they're my friends I grew up with those
[1:30:27] people but those people got to pass but
[1:30:29] that might not be your path that might
[1:30:31] not be where you headed this morning but
[1:30:34] you got to make your own decision
[1:30:35] because at the end of the day nobody can
[1:30:38] make that choice for you nobody can make
[1:30:40] the choice of what you want to do with
[1:30:42] your life
[1:30:43] but we can tell you that if you choose
[1:30:45] Jesus it's the best thing for you I can
[1:30:48] tell you from my own experience that if
[1:30:50] you choose the Lord he'll always watch
[1:30:52] out for you he'll always lead you in the
[1:30:54] right path in the right direction he'll
[1:30:56] always make sure that he'll supply all
[1:30:58] your needs even when you're down and out
[1:31:01] and you're struggling with things he'll
[1:31:02] still be there and say I'm watching over
[1:31:04] you I'm keeping you I'm making sure that
[1:31:07] every path is straight before you I'm
[1:31:09] making sure that you walk through the
[1:31:10] right doors make sure you're around the
[1:31:12] right people even when you're going
[1:31:14] through you say Lord I know that you can
[1:31:16] keep me because I gave my life to you I
[1:31:19] know that you're the god that's able to
[1:31:20] keep me more than I can keep myself and
[1:31:23] you may not understand why you go
[1:31:25] through certain things but sometimes God
[1:31:27] said I'm proving to you that I can keep
[1:31:29] you I'm proving to you that I can help
[1:31:31] you I'm proving to you that God is the
[1:31:34] god that can do everything that you want
[1:31:36] him to do for you and he'll Lead You In
[1:31:38] the right path amen amen at this time we
[1:31:41] asked everyone a dead stand this morning

[1:36:39] or or you know they 25 years old and got
[1:36:42] 35 years and and you can really see the

[1:36:52] that took their own lives because the
[1:36:54] depression of it you know it's sad
[1:36:57] because
[1:36:58] you know the devil try to set these
[1:37:00] traps and in the end they find out that
[1:37:03] they don't have no friends in the end
[1:37:05] you know they family they gave up on
[1:37:07] them and and you could just see the
