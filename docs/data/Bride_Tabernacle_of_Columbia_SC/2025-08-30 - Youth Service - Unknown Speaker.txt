Amen. &gt;&gt; So, at this time, we're going to open the floor. We like to do this. open the floor for anybody that want to give God praise, a testimony, something on their heart that could be a blessing to others or a blessing to themselves. Cuz sometime when you tell a testimony, they said, "Oh, I'm I'm talking to everybody. I don't want to talk to everybody." Sometimes just for you, right? &gt;&gt; So, open the floor at this time. Anybody in your heart want to say, "God is good. God is great." We thank him. I ain't going to finish that sentence. Y'all know what it says. We thank him for this plate because we eating spiritual food. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. But at this time, anybody want to come up? The floor is open. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God bless y'all. My daughter say she wanted to give a testimony, but she might be shamed. I do it for her. Hey, God. Any who all know me in here? I'm Sister Nene. Um y'all back yesterday made a year last year I was we were having our big corporate meeting for my job and um well I I was coming to church been coming to church 31 years but sometimes you know you don't be walking circumspectingly sometimes and and that don't do you no good. But anyway y'all, we were having our corporate meeting at the um SIMT building in Florence and we was at the auditorium and so dress the dress I had on wasn't quite too good but God had he warned me. He had warned me over and over. But y'all, there's a guy that worked with me and y'all he is HIV positive and um but that don't mean anything. You know, we you know that's your coworker whatever. But anyway, and I work in the medical field. So I walked in the auditorium y'all, but I had saw him and I seen a a demon. I did and I said that don't look right. He wasn't moving right. And so y'all, I walked in the auditorium and he was talking to another man. It's kind of dark in there. And I threw up my hand like that and waved and y'all, he stuck me in my arm with something. He stuck me, y'all. My whole left arm was in pain. I waved this one. I don't know what happened with this one, but he stuck me y'all. That's all I y'all. Okay. I've been in medical field about 25 years. I know what to do. My boss is a doctor. My I got a panel of nurses in nurse practitioners all around me. I know what to do. I knew what to do. I did nothing. I did nothing, y'all. Nothing. Okay. So, about two weeks passed. Two weeks, y'all. I was supposed to leave there, go straight to the hospital and get prep, get the medicine to come back if anything was transmitted. And um I did nothing. Two weeks passed, I got sick. I got sick. My appetite was gone. Um I felt very nauseous, y'all. It's like something even happened with my eyesight. Um, I mean, a lot of things I couldn't even So, what I did, y'all, I text about 20 sisters and I was like, "Y'all pray for me. This this this this is deep. This something." And um, y'all, when I tell y'all, and guess what? He was the man that if a patient come in and get tested for HIV and they found to be positive, you have to call him so he can come and do the work up. You know what I'm saying? If y'all anybody in here know about nurses, any doctors in here or whatever. He was the guy. So if I needed to I didn't get a HIV test done at my job because I was like, "Oh no, if he gave me HIV, um, he ain't seeing me." Uh-uh. I do the eye exams at my job. Well, my pre, it's not my job anymore. I just got a brand new job with a bigger corporation. And so, um, but anyway, I had done that job almost 3 years. And so, um, I'm like, "No." And, um, so finally I talked to one of the nurse practitioners. She said, "Why you ain't tell?" I talked to my boss and nurse. "Why you ain't tell?" I talked the the big supervisor over me, a doctor. Why? Why you ain't say nothing? So, they had to have this big meeting and um finally I went to the health department, y'all, and got tested and they told me say, "We going to do a fast track on you." Man, that was no fast track. That thing took almost two weeks to come back. But anyway, it came back nonreactive. If anybody in here in the medical field know what that mean, that means negative. But anyway, y'all, what I wanted to say was my prayers for two weeks turned into all night prayers. All night. And I had to get up at 5:00 in the morning, go to work, but they turned into all night prayers and fasting and seeking the Lord. Like brother Brooke said last night or well not before last, sorry. when I David the prophet said when I was seeking the Lord and um it ch it was God it was God changed me I y'all I was in such a bad state mentally my daughter told me y'all I live with her she said I'm going to leave my house I'm going to leave you in the house and me too going to move out because I was so depressed I was I was messed up I mean I went to my My pastor was in the hospital and I had to go up there and tell my pastor what happened. I called brother Simmons and sister Renee. I had to I had y'all I had to have a panel. I had to have God cuz let me tell you when when God come and and let me say it like I want to say it. When he bust you up, let me tell you, the devil can't bust you up like God can bust you up. And so, um, they was praying for me, praying everybody. And God delivered me. And one night, my my baby daughter, Malaysia, y'all know her. She stayed down the street from us in a townhouse. And she said, "I think a rat got in the house and I can't stay there." And I'm like, "Girl, ain't no rat in that house. That house, I almost knew how a rat get in that house." And I was just praying all night, y'all. Reading my Bible all night, praying, praising her. And she said, "What?" She asked my oldest daughter, "What's going on with my mama?" And she said, "The spirit of the Lord had told her something about HIV." And she said, "Mama, what are what's going on?" And y'all know my husband passed away about four years ago. So, ain't nothing going on here. So, you know, and um she said, "Mama, no." She said, "What what's going on? You supposed to be Christian. You supposed to be a prayer boy. You supposed to be believing. Why are you going through like this? I said, Lia, I had to be honest. I had to confess. I said, I wasn't quite walking circumspectly. No, I don't deal with, you know, sexual activity. No, but I I wasn't walking right in my dressing and different things like that. She said, "But mama, that ain't even symptoms what you have." And I said, "Let me tell you something. I've been in the medical field at that time, 24 years." I said, "You ain't going to tell me." Yes, I Yes, I am. I guess I um I know that was symptoms, but y'all the panel was praying for me, the saints of God. And I was praying my whole life totally changed, right? It changed, right? You can go to church. That don't mean you saved and filled with the Holy Ghost. But um it was negative, y'all. And I found out I had fibroids on my uterus and I had to have surgery this year. I had surgery in January and um of course I had to get tested different tests all over again negative or non-reactive as y'all know of um praise the Lord and I stand here before you as sister Nini Tanil that's my real name I'm Holy Ghost filing and I just want to say don't let God bust you up if you ain't been busted up cuz he will and you will forever be changed or you'll be just don't you just don't want God to be cast into out of darkness. But that's my full testimony cuz I know a lot of people always wondered what went on with me. So that's it. Praise the Lord Jesus. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Bless. [Music] Okay. Um [Music] I kept telling them I was like, "Guys, every time I think about it, I just start crying." [Music] &gt;&gt; But my testimony is about mental health. You know, you hear you hear all these testimonies about um people getting healed from the actions that they do. You know, maybe you're in the world and you're not living right or you got you got um hurt and God healed you. But I was kind of confused about my testimony because it didn't come from that angle. Mine was in my head. Mine was mental. It was the thoughts that I that I had. But um then you know um Josh asked if anybody had a testimony and I had text him. I was I was really scared and I had text. I was like yeah I have one. So for for years, you know, low self-esteem is a is a demon. It's it's really hard to have and I struggle with it. Not physically, not cuz how I looked, but cuz what I how thought or how strong I or how weak I thought I was. If you think you're not enough physically, put that in the context of you're not enough for God. For years, for years, I thought, why would God want me? You know, you hear that saying of um even the weakest Christian can um um or the devil's scared of even the weakest Christian. I was already claiming that as myself. I was like, "Oh, that's me. I'm the weakest way here." when um when I would see people raise their hands and and shout and cry out, you know, I would be sitting or standing and I would feel something in my chest and I'm like, well, why aren't I doing that? You know, you know, why isn't God touching me? And then, you know, as you grow up, as you grow up as um people already in the church, you know, you grow up in God, your your family, you're blessed with a family that'll uh raise you in this in this walk of life. Then you see people start to stray away and you know, like they do things that you were told was bad as kids. I would hate myself because I did not have the strength enough to do the things that they were doing. You know, as even as girls, you know, we wear skirts and dresses. I would hate myself that, oh, you know, I could do other things, but I saw myself as too weak to do it. So, I was like, "Dang, I'm really dumb right now." You know, but I guess it's good. But, um, seeing that, I was like, man, I'm not good enough for God. I'm not even strong enough to try other things that I want to try. Like, where am I right now? You know, and so I went I went around like that for for years. I would just hate myself. And it's those it's your own thoughts that you think. It's not what people tell you. They can tell you stuff or whatever, but it's how you receive it and if it actually is if actually means anything to you. So um honestly a year um from today on or no I don't know last tent meeting Saturday morning service. So yeah, um I don't remember who was preaching but afterwards they had done an altar call and a you know God just started moving you know a lot of my friends were just crying out and stuff and I was like here I am again and God's not touching me. So I sat over there and God started moving on grace and grace was crying out and Joy was on the altar and the other grace and it was just hitting everybody and I just sat there and I and I thought about going to the bathroom or something. But then I couldn't move. I thought, "Oh, I'm getting weak. I didn't eat this morning or something." But then I literally could not move. And I just sat there and I was nothing was happening to me until Joy that at the time I didn't know it was Joy. She started singing I want to be a willing vessel. And I heard those words and I was like God that's all I want to be. I've wanted to be not just a willing vessel. You know, in the Bible, you're told to be bold and you're told to be strong. &gt;&gt; God, I want to be that for you. &gt;&gt; So, Joyce started singing that. And I just started singing that along with her. And every word I said, I was crying cuz it was true. I was like, "God, make me into the vessel you want me to be. I'm tired of being in I'm tired of hating myself." Cuz it takes a lot to hate yourself if y'all ever go through it. It takes a lot to see yourself as not good enough that to someone that supposedly created you, you know? It just goes on deeper levels that way. And I just started crying and singing that. And there are moments in your Christian walk when you know God has heard you. You know, you poured your heart and your soul into every word that you have cried out. And that was that moment for me. It meant everything to me. I put my all into those words and God touched me and filled me with the Holy Ghost that day. And [Music] and I just think, you know, it's a blessing that even though my testimony isn't, I guess, physical actions, it's it's still just as powerful because because God did still deliver me from myself. [Applause] And I I want to say if anybody um if anybody does struggle with mental health or low self-esteem, God can heal you. It's &gt;&gt; it's not a mental health is a real thing &gt;&gt; and God cares about you enough &gt;&gt; to help you through it. &gt;&gt; That's it. [Music] [Applause] Anybody else? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. To &gt;&gt; God be the glory. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I just couldn't sit down on God &gt;&gt; because he been too good to me. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but he's been good to me. &gt;&gt; And I make it personal. &gt;&gt; I said, "Anytime you want me to speak for you, I'll speak for you." Amen. &gt;&gt; I was praying this morning before I came and I tell you, God is so good. &gt;&gt; And I was on my knees and I said, "God, what do you want me to do?" Let him leave. And I sit in in the passenger seat. And the Lord said, "When you get there, I want you to give me a high praise." &gt;&gt; So I came in the sanctuary and I sat there and I said, "God, this is not the right time." He said, "Do you love me?" Amen. &gt;&gt; I said, "I love you, Lord." He said, "Well, then give me the high praise." &gt;&gt; And I wouldn't open my mouth. And I said, "God, I don't feel comfortable doing this." He said, "Do you love me?" I said, "I love you, Lord." So, as I began to yield, hey, hey, come on. &gt;&gt; And I allow God to have his holy and mighty way. &gt;&gt; See, I learned years ago I fell in love with his presence. See, it's something about the presence of God that when he come upon you, you don't have no other choice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Next thing I know, it came up out of my shop, out of my belly, a high praise to the most high God. &gt;&gt; Well, I loved the Lord because he knows how to do everything. &gt;&gt; And I heard the heavenly host say, "I just restored the joy of your salvation." See, God made it so simple that he wanted me to tell it so that you can open up while he moves by his spirit. &gt;&gt; I see sometimes God's glory movement. I just stand in awe. Said they don't even know you're here. They can't even recognize they are standing in the midst of your glory. &gt;&gt; That's how powerful God is. We forgive his spirit and we get so comfortable in who we are, what we want to do, what we want to think, how we want to act that he watches us. Just watch us. Can you imagine the glory in the place and you not even know it? &gt;&gt; To God be the glory. [Music] [Applause] [Music] I just want to st share a quick little testimony about a time that God saved me for myself. Also about 4 years ago when I I'm 18 now. When I was like 12, nope, math wrong. When I was about 14 in the eighth grade about to graduate from there, I was going through a lot of different mental struggles. My entire life it had been back and forth from different things with my mom, my dad, and this is like to me it felt like everybody left. So, at one point in time, it was something inside of my brain telling me it's my time to leave. I didn't need to be here anymore. I didn't feel like I wanted to be here anymore. And God saved me for myself. At one point in time, I had grabbed a bunch of different pills and I just went and I took them. And then I was ready to go and I was prepared until something just came to my mind and they told me, "You're not ready. It's not your time yet. Call 911." I called 911. I called my mom. I called my godmom. I called everybody and they came there quick. They rushed me to the hospital and they said it was close. It was like it was a chance that I could have been going today. I wasn't going. They started to pump me. I went into the hospital for a week or so and I stayed. And it's been these past four years has been a struggle with my own mental health with different things telling me you don't need to be here. it's not you're not ready to be here. And then it's been different fights with God telling me you should be here. This is your world. This is the time that you're supposed to be here. You're here for good things. You're here to do good things. And I never believed that myself until I just started to realize they're telling you different messages. It's different things that you have to listen to. God is showing you different ways. You're trying to take this path and that's not the path that he wants you to go on. So, I've been continuing to struggle with my mental health, and I'm just glad that I got to be here, to see myself walk across the stage, to see my nephew born, to see my family continue, to see my brothers grow. And I just thank God because without him, I wouldn't have been here today. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; So, how many months it was? Uh my dad passed and um I think it's like two weeks after he passed I prayed I prayed to God asked him to send me a message to God send me basically I was praying on my knees and asked God can he send my dad can can basically I can't explain it I just had it in my head uh can I was on my knees on my like on my knees on my bed praying to God like I do every night. But I was praying. I asked God, "Can he send me a message to let my let me know my dad's okay." That night, I went to sleep. I had a I had a dream. And the dream I had was everything was like everything was just weird. And I was in my old apartment and I was in my old apartment. And I act I saw my dad and he came up to me and said, "Everything's going to be all right, so everything's going to be all right." But at first, like I think a year after that, I didn't really I questioned myself about God. I told my mom, I don't know if God's real, but he he basically showed up in my life &gt;&gt; through time through time. And I had to realize that. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So when I realized God's real, that that showed me that was the example right there that God was real. &gt;&gt; So when he showed me, I was I wasn't crying, but I was happy to let cuz he let me know my dad's okay. He He's in heaven. He's going to be okay. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] At this time, it's good to see that God is still moving in the young people. I'm young myself, but it's good to see that he's moving in our lives. A lot of us deal with different things and a lot of time we grow up in church like she said we hear all the things over and over and over again but we don't really understand or it's not real to us but I'm glad today we get to see that it is real to us. &gt;&gt; It's real to us. &gt;&gt; I mean we grow up on the shoulders of the old saints that been there and they tell you don't go this way, don't go that way. Don't go this way. Do we listen? No, we don't listen. But God, he got to bring us back. &gt;&gt; I forgot the phrase you said. He got to beat us up. &gt;&gt; Bust us up. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I'm glad God is here. He listens to our prayer. Amen. At this time, we want to sing one more song and turn it over to the uh ministers this morning. This song is the words say nobody but God. &gt;&gt; It was nobody but God who saved you, who filled me with the Holy Ghost. He gave me joy. Amen. We just want to sing that song and give God honor and praise this morning. Amen. Amen. [Music] Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was nobody but God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, this one of them church songs, so you're welcome to stand up, clap your hands, get into it. Amen. [Music] Amen. Ready?

I tell you, this has been a week. &gt;&gt; Uh for brother Matias, I tell you, the devil has fought me hard this week. I was talking to brother Brian and just &gt;&gt; amen. How it seems like every day was getting worse the closer it got to this moment. [Music] &gt;&gt; And sometimes God gets you to the place. See, God wants people, church, to not just demonstrate &gt;&gt; what it's like to praise him when you come out. &gt;&gt; He needs some people to demonstrate how to praise him while you're in it. &gt;&gt; I just want to sing a little bit of the song. With my hands lifted up [Music] and my mouth filled with praise [Music] with a heart of thanksgiving. I will bless thee, oh Lord. Y'all got it. One more time. Oh, with my hands with my hands lifted up and my mouth filled with praise. Yeah. With a heart of thanksgiving. What will you do? I will bless thee, oh Lord, when I don't have all the answers. I will bless thee. I will bless thee, oh Lord, you. I will bless thee, oh Lord, with the heart with the heart of thanksgiving. Come on, church. What will you do [Music] when I don't understand it? With my hands lifted up. Come on. You telling him right now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And my mouth filled with praise. Yeah. Yeah. With a heart of thanks. Ging. What will you do? I will bless thee, oh Lord. One more time. Oh, and I will bless thee, oh Lord, when I don't understand thee. Jesus, I will. Oh, with the heart, with the heart of thanks. What will you do? I will bless thee, oh time with no music. Yes, I will bless thee. I will bless thee, oh Lord. Come on, tell them, I will bless thee. &gt;&gt; Yay, do I walk through the valleys of the shadow of death. I'll still bless you. Why? Oh, with the heart of thanks. Cuz you're right there with me, God. I will bless the other. So, while I'm going through the storms of life with my hands lifted up and my mouth filled with praise. Yeah. Yeah. with the heart of thank. Lord, I'll stand right here and I will bless thee, oh Lord. One more time. Oh, and I will bless thee, oh Lord. Your praise shall continually be in my mouth. I will bless thee, oh Lord, [Music] with the heart of thanksgiving. Come on, church. What will you do? I will bless thee, oh Lord. Amen. Is that your prayer this morning? Now, he going to test you out on that now. Are you going to be able to give him praise when your flesh says you should not? Amen. So, we thank God for his presence on this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I need to sing that to get to help me deal with the nerves. And I feel a I'm still nervous, but I feel a little bit better. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to just man take a few minutes this morning and then I'm going to turn it over to our brother Caleb. Man, we going to kind of tag team here. I'm going to do about 15 20 minutes and and turn it over to him to close us out. Uh but I didn't not really going to preach this morning. I kind of just want to tell my testimony. &gt;&gt; Um I'm going have to leave some parts out cuz my mama and dad is sitting in here. So, [Laughter] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, hope it can be an encouragement to you because I think we all should have a testimony. &gt;&gt; Uh, we all should have a a a walk with Christ that we can have learned from, that we can share with other people and be of encouragement. And this is the first time I've ever done this. I've never really told my testimony and the things God has brought me through in my life for about 15 20 minutes. Amen. Hopefully I want to not to prolong the time. Let's turn straight to the word here in Mark chapter 10. Very familiar passage of scripture. Uh but how many know it's a blessing when you can see yourself in the text? &gt;&gt; This thought came to me a few uh few uh weeks ago actually. And uh when Caleb texted me and said, "Hey, you got about, you know, 15 20 minutes. I'm not going to preach the whole sermon, but maybe share a few points here &gt;&gt; like it be of encouragement to you. Very familiar passage of scripture. It says, "And when he was uh verse 17 says, "And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running and kneel to him and asked him, good master, what shall I do that I may inherit &gt;&gt; eternal life?" That's a very good question to ask, is it not? And Jesus said unto him, why callst thou me good? There is none good but one and that is God. Thou knowest the commandments. Do not commit adultery. Do not kill. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness. Defraud not. Honor thy father and mother. And he answered and said unto him, Master, all of the thing all of these things I've observed from my youth. Then Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing that thou lackest, &gt;&gt; go thy way, said whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shall have treasure in heaven, and come take up your cross and follow me. May the Lord add blessing to the reading of his word, you may be seated. Amen. Caleb, keep me honest on my time. Just tug on my code if I'll play some notes on the keyboard. Amen. Um I want to use for a uh thought um maximize your potential. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Uh the prophet of God said in the message investments he said when Jesus saw the rich the rich young ruler he said Jesus knowed that there was a much potential to this young man. &gt;&gt; Oh my right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So Jesus saw his potential but we know how the story ends. So clearly potential just ain't going to cut it. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Here's the spiritual definition of the word &gt;&gt; potential. It is the God-given capacity, gifts, and purpose placed inside of you that has not yet been fully revealed, &gt;&gt; developed, or manifested, &gt;&gt; but can be if surrendered to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come on. &gt;&gt; It is the difference between where you are right now, &gt;&gt; okay? &gt;&gt; And where God created you to be. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We were born on purpose for a purpose. &gt;&gt; So when Jesus is looking at this rich young ruler, he's not looking at where he was at that moment. &gt;&gt; Okay? That's why you you you you can't be afraid and say, "Man, I've people tell me all the time, brother, I got to get my life right. I got to clean this up." You can't clean yourself up. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; I got to stop. I got to I got to fix this up. God wants you to come as you are because he sees your potential. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Thank Jean said yesterday, whom he forneew, he predestinated to be conformed in his image. That's your potential. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. &gt;&gt; So, as I look at my life as a believer growing up, uh uh most of us in here, like me, grew up in the church. &gt;&gt; Growing up in the church my whole life. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Born in the church, raised in the church. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Watch my parents come out of denominational church into the message of this hour. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; I seen a lot as a kid. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. growing up hearing the word preached, going to Mullins, going to Marian, driving up down the road in church in Sunday school, Sunday morning, in church, Sunday morning worship service, Sunday evening service, Tuesday night prayer, Wednesday night Bible study, Friday night. Do I have any witnesses out there? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Ain't got time to do nothing? &gt;&gt; My God. My God. My God. church all week. &gt;&gt; And you thought you had your Saturday. No, we going to choir rehearsal. &gt;&gt; But still, church, I still needed an experience. &gt;&gt; Brother, &gt;&gt; see, all of that was just exposure. &gt;&gt; And exposure ain't experience. &gt;&gt; You can't live off your exposure. &gt;&gt; Your exposure will get you to church, but your experience will change you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your exposure would cause you to cry out, but your experience will keep you in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, as we look at the rich young ruler here, the Bible says Jesus responded says, "Go thy way and sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and came and come and take up the cross and follow me." So, as I got older in my walk with Christ, seeing the power of God move, demons being cast out, miracles, signs, and wonders, I'm seeing all of this with my own two eyes. &gt;&gt; But as I got older and made it to high school and I dealt with something called peer pressure, &gt;&gt; the pressure to fit in. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They say in those ages when you're in your teenage years to about 22, the pressure to be in a community. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; See, when I was in my and they say you're a a product of your environment, when my environment was church, it was easy to fit in if all I knew and was around was church people. &gt;&gt; That's right. Good, brother. &gt;&gt; But when I got in high school and they were asking me questions like, uh, did you hear that new song by Outcast that came out last week? And I was like, what? Outcast &gt;&gt; when all I knew was the Nikes that mama bought me. But when I went to high school and seen the Jordans and I there was a conflict. I want to be like them. &gt;&gt; I want to fit in. &gt;&gt; I want to be identified. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Then initially it was uncomfortable. But how many know if you let sin linger, &gt;&gt; it would make you comfortable wasting time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You get comfortable with wasting time. Oh, I got time. I got time to get right. I got time to make this right. No, you don't. God is soon to come. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Get you comfortable wasting time coming to church, leaving, doing all this other stuff, &gt;&gt; no results. So I and I'm speeding up here. So I went through my my years of high school and I got good at being an actor. &gt;&gt; When I came to church, &gt;&gt; I pulled my pants up. &gt;&gt; When I got to school, &gt;&gt; I pulled them down cuz the devil told me nobody in church here. &gt;&gt; Yeah, your sisters go to the school, but they not in your class. You can please the world and please church church at the same time. &gt;&gt; And as long as you do that, God's okay with it. &gt;&gt; Expose the devil, brother. &gt;&gt; Sorry, mama and daddy. It's It's okay. &gt;&gt; I'm not where I used to be. &gt;&gt; So, I got real good at it. &gt;&gt; I I was a great actor, but how many know God don't want actors and actresses? He wants puppets. That gives him the strength. &gt;&gt; That's what he want. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But I I found myself as I got older coming to the altar slain in the spirit, crying out to God because I realized that where I was wasn't where I was supposed to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; You church, here's the thing. When you genuinely and authentically get in God's presence, you cannot leave the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's impossible to leave the same when you authentically and genuinely enter into his presence. &gt;&gt; So I'm coming up to the altar crying out authentically and genuinely want this pro. See, here's the mistake we make. We allow sin in our lives &gt;&gt; to linger. &gt;&gt; The Bible says the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, &gt;&gt; but they are mighty through God by how? Tearing down of strongholds. So when you allow one thing to linger, guess what? You give the devil a brick. &gt;&gt; And then he adds to that brick. And then he adds to that brick. And see, what I was wanting is to come up to the altar, the preacher, pray for me, and God sends a bulldozer and just wipe the whole fortress down. &gt;&gt; You got to deal with how you got there. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You got to process. How did I get to this point? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. How did I go from a Sunday school boy playing the drums, happy, singing songs to now I'm cussing like a sailor? &gt;&gt; How did I get to this point to where I'm having bitterness in my heart? &gt;&gt; It didn't happen overnight, but we expect God just to get a bulldozer and fix it in one prayer line. &gt;&gt; You got to deal with how did I get here? &gt;&gt; What have I allowed in my life? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Who have I been hanging around with? Because God can deliver you right here on this altar. But you can literally walk right out that door and put the chains back on. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Save me from my cursing spirit. And you walk around and hang with the same people who curse. &gt;&gt; You go watch the same movies with cursing in it. &gt;&gt; God is saying, "What are you doing?" Come on now. &gt;&gt; Who the son is set free is free indeed. &gt;&gt; God don't do he don't take no two step. Bring it back. We'll try to. He's not a mechanic that says try it again. &gt;&gt; When he fixes it the first time, you ain't got to come back. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Get me a mechanic that's going to get down to the nitty-gritty. &gt;&gt; I don't want no quick fix. &gt;&gt; A lot of times that's church. That's what we want. We want a quick fix &gt;&gt; when we've got to deal with how we got there. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Teach him, brother. &gt;&gt; How much time I got? &gt;&gt; Good. All right. &gt;&gt; So, I found myself in this vicious cycle coming to church, feeling the spirit of God move in a mighty way, crying my eyes out, playing the drums, and I was comfortable with walking back out with no results. &gt;&gt; Cuz the devil had lied to me and said, "Brother Matias, this is what it's supposed to be like. How you going to save the world and you talking and acting like the world? I completely I had it all messed up. &gt;&gt; And if you look at the rich young ruler here, Jesus says one thing that thou lackest. And here's the here is the conflict when I when I read this passage of scripture that I tied it back to brother Matias's life. It's that the rich young ruler did not want to suffer. &gt;&gt; My lord, &gt;&gt; he did not want to be in the place. You mean to tell me I got to be broke? [Music] &gt;&gt; Because this whole time there was no suffering. &gt;&gt; There was no pain. &gt;&gt; When the way you are identified with Christ, the Bible say all that live godly will suffer. &gt;&gt; But what I wanted to do was not suffer and still be identified with Christ. &gt;&gt; It don't work like that. You have to go through some stuff. And I'm not talking about, oh, I had a flat tire today and uh I had to been stuck. I'm talking about suffering for his name. &gt;&gt; Why you don't know about rap music? Cuz brother, I don't listen to it. &gt;&gt; Why you don't do these things? Because that's not what I believe. Suffering, ridicule. &gt;&gt; I didn't want to deal with that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it put me in a vicious cycle to where I was way. See, the God saw the rich young rulers potential, church. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Everybody in here has potential to be formed in God's image, his purpose for your life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But potential enough alone won't get you there. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; No cross, no crown. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, I was exposed to a lot. I I knew God was real, but how many know he has to be real in your life? Amen. &gt;&gt; You you you can't go off nobody else's testimony. That's why the Bible says, "Taste and see &gt;&gt; that the Lord is good." A I just want to smell the cake. &gt;&gt; Smelling the cake just gives me exposure to the cake. Put it in my mouth. &gt;&gt; Let me taste our taste. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we want to rob God of &gt;&gt; of us experiencing. Think about a book somebody gives you. I give you this book and I say, "Man, this is a good book. You're going to like it." And you get all excited. Then I tell you what the book is about. &gt;&gt; Your excitement is gone. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we want God to give us the answers as to why. &gt;&gt; And God is saying, "Why would I rob you of your experience?" &gt;&gt; That's why he don't give us answers to why. Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; So, I I I had exposure in church. I I was exposed to uh God. But but brother Matias just wanted to cut corners. The prophet of God said in seeking after Jesus that every son that cometh to God &gt;&gt; must first first &gt;&gt; be tried &gt;&gt; and chasened of God. &gt;&gt; But I wanted to I wanted to skip that part. I don't like that. I still want to be a child of God, but I don't want to be chasened of God. I don't want to be tried by God. So, you got to prove who you are. &gt;&gt; And in that moment, that was the Rick Jones ruler's opportunity to prove what he valued most. Because I believe he loved God, but he didn't love God first. coming to church, getting convicted, word coming forth, and see the word of God, prophet God puts, is like a looking glass. &gt;&gt; It's going to tell the truth on you each and every time. &gt;&gt; That's why keep coming to church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't let nobody discourage you. Keep coming to church. &gt;&gt; It's like a scale. You go to the doctor, man. Doctor says you need to lose some weight. You got high blood pressure. Brother Matias, this is your this is your diet. You need to stop eating this. You need to stop eating this. And if you do that, you lose the mount of weight and you'll be healthy. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you three weeks. You cut corners if you want to. &gt;&gt; Here's one thing that will always tell the truth. When you step on that scale, &gt;&gt; it's going to look right back up at you and say, "You Don't care nothing about how you feel. &gt;&gt; Don't care nothing about how bad you want it. &gt;&gt; You ain't been following the plan. &gt;&gt; Know how bad you want it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; You lying. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen, brother. &gt;&gt; And nobody else can get on that scale but you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The doctor can't get on that. The pastor can't. &gt;&gt; You got to stand on that scale. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's like you looking in the mirror. I was telling the church in Marian this last week. You don't get mad when you look in the mirror and they tell you you have messed up. &gt;&gt; All right, brother. &gt;&gt; You say, "Thank you, mirror. &gt;&gt; I didn't see that." &gt;&gt; You take your time. Put your uniform on. Put your work clothes on. You think you look good, but every time you don't trust your own two eyes, you go right to that mirror &gt;&gt; because the mirror is what other people see. [Music] You don't see your shoes on the wrong feet and walk out and say, "No big deal." &gt;&gt; You fix it. &gt;&gt; And God will show you through his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wear you off. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Because in in order to really change, church, we have to allow God to deal with the errors of our life that we have closed off to him. &gt;&gt; Revelations 3 says he's standing at the door knocking. He's not going to force himself in. He's not gonna squeeze himself in through the crack. You got to rip the door off the hinges. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, deal with &gt;&gt; with what I'm with what I'm going through. So, I'm I'mma sum this up. So, I came my my my my I guess you my moment of reckoning. I went through many many years uh going through this cycle of lying to myself. &gt;&gt; Uh we were at a meeting one night in Aken. I'll never forget it. It was at brother Jackson's church. Brother Kyle Kelly was preaching and I was at the altar again. &gt;&gt; All right, &gt;&gt; crying. Same thing every year. See, we got to stop and ask, if we're not seeing results, what am I doing wrong? &gt;&gt; Church, we in this mess. We supposed to see results. &gt;&gt; And if you're not, you need to take a step back. Lord, what is going on? &gt;&gt; That's what Joshua did. He said, Lord, you said we had the victory. Come on. &gt;&gt; Hold up. We ain't supposed to be like this. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Said, "Lord, you said in your word, we supposed to be victorious." Something something off. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, I'm at the altar boohooing. Brother Kao preached a powerful sermon, convicted my heart, came up here, cry, and said, "Lord, I want you to fix this. I'm sorry, Lord. I I'm going to do better." And I was sitting on the front row and it was a brother right next to me. And as I was wiping the tears off my eyes, coming down, I heard him in the side view. He was crying out to God and he said, "Lord, please let it be real this time." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I mean, he's crying to didn't care who was hearing him. Screaming to the L. He says, "Lord, I'm tired of playing church. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother." &gt;&gt; And then he start going into detail things that I'm like, "Bro, what you saying?" But he was in that moment identifying the root of his problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I like listening to rap music, but help me with that. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I like doing this and I like help. That's what Paul was in chapter Romans chapter 7. He was honest to God about himself. &gt;&gt; But one of the sisters just said that God delivered them from their self. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In order for there to be no condemnation, you have to be honest with God with where you are. Amen. &gt;&gt; That Canaanite woman, she comes to Jesus with a need. &gt;&gt; But Jesus already knew she was a gentile. She comes, "Lord, savior, I got I got a need." The Bible says he did not even respond to her. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Why? Because she was trying to be something that she was not. Prophet of God said that if you want God to fix you and to help you, you got to be first honest with yourself. &gt;&gt; You got to evaluate your own self to make sure you're in the faith. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. &gt;&gt; So, in that moment, you can get ready, brother Caleb. In that moment, I'm listening to this brother cry out and I realized like the prodical son, this ain't supposed to be like this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there is a purpose for my life. And my purpose cannot be manifested by going in a vicious cycle, &gt;&gt; asking God for deliverance, but walking out, coming back to church, same time, same place, defeated. &gt;&gt; No growth, &gt;&gt; no results. But church, my walk with Christ did not officially start until I became honest with myself and how I got to this point. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, if you want me to deliver, I promise you when I leave, I'm going to take those friends away. &gt;&gt; See, that's why the Bible says, "If any man come after me, the first person you got to deal with is yourself." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How you going to deny yourself when you're lying to yourself? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can't do it. &gt;&gt; You got to be honest. Because anytime you come to Christ Church, I promise you, he's going to ask you for something. He &gt;&gt; sure is. And if he ain't ask you for something, you ain't met him yet. &gt;&gt; Any man come after me, he has to deny himself. &gt;&gt; That's why when my sister said that, she said, "God delivered me from myself." &gt;&gt; You got to figure out what areas in your life you've given the devil permission to operate. &gt;&gt; That's how you tear down strongholds. What area has I reasoned with? What area has I allowed? Amen. &gt;&gt; To where I have moments of victory, &gt;&gt; but I never truly overcome. &gt;&gt; That's good, bro. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; That's where it starts being honest with yourself. &gt;&gt; Talk to God. He already knows you. &gt;&gt; He knew that woman was a gentile. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm not going to respond to you till you be honest with who you are." Right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Songwriter says, "I came to Jesus just as I was." &gt;&gt; Come to him like you are. Don't put on a show. Don't put on a front. &gt;&gt; Tell him how you feel. And I promise you, church, that's when your journey starts. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand clap of praise. Turn it back over to Brother Caleb. &gt;&gt; That's good, brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, the good thing that I'm going to tell you this morning is you don't have to read another scripture. Because as soon as he opened up the Bible and he said Mark chapter 10, &gt;&gt; I turned to them over there and I said he took my scripture &gt;&gt; because it was the same scripture that I was going to read this morning. &gt;&gt; And the tricky thing when you're speaking behind someone is Lord, you want to be in the same channel. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And so I was praying. And I said, "Lord, I don't want to say something and have the people one way and take them another way." And the Lord got me here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, the topic that I have this morning that I want to take you in, I'm going to ask you a question. And it follows and it ties right in because the question that I want to ask you is, are you satisfied with your relationship with God? &gt;&gt; Because he was just testifying and telling you at one point in time, he had to realize that he wasn't satisfied where he was. He wasn't satisfied with going to church and going outside and doing something different. He wasn't satisfied with coming and seeing God move and something not changing his life. &gt;&gt; But one day, you got to get to the point where you say, "Lord, I expect you to do something for me that when I leave this place, I'm forever changed." &gt;&gt; But sometimes we get to the point like this young rich ruler and I wrote some things down and I said one day he got satisfied. say he wanted more. He wanted he wanted more than what he had at the moment. He came to God because he wanted more. &gt;&gt; When he came to him, he said, "Lord, what must I do to obtain eternal life? &gt;&gt; But when he when God gave him the answer, see, he didn't want to sacrifice what he had achieved &gt;&gt; to get what God had for him." &gt;&gt; Many of times in life, we get to the point that we're always going for what we want to achieve. We want this new job. We want this new car. We want this new house. We want this family. We want all these things. But when God comes to you and say, "Will you give it up for me?" &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; That's the moment that we choose that we want it more. &gt;&gt; What we got planned for ourselves, we want that more. &gt;&gt; We said, "You know what, Lord? I'm satisfied with where I am with you. &gt;&gt; I want this more than what you can give me." But you see the young rich ruler, he didn't realize that if he would have gave it up, &gt;&gt; gave it up. &gt;&gt; If he would have gave up those riches, &gt;&gt; he cannot get what God had prepared for him. &gt;&gt; He all the stuff that he had built, all the stuff that he had achieved was not greater than what God was going to give to him. &gt;&gt; He might have had the biggest house and acres and everything, but it wasn't better than the mansion that God had prepared for him. It wasn't better than the cattle on a thousand hills. It wasn't better than all those things. &gt;&gt; But one day he said, he said, "I'm going to settle with just being a good churchgoer." &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; I'm going to settle with going to church and going to church on See, he was a good church goer. &gt;&gt; Unlike some people, he didn't just show up on Sunday. &gt;&gt; He didn't just show up on Sunday and Wednesday &gt;&gt; or Sunday and Tuesday or Friday or whenever your church has service. He was one that a he he he lived right. &gt;&gt; He lived right. Amen. &gt;&gt; I said he lived right. &gt;&gt; Cuz some people in church but don't live right. &gt;&gt; He lived right. He obeyed the commandments. He did everything that he knew to do. &gt;&gt; But there was something missing. &gt;&gt; There was something missing. &gt;&gt; And he had to realize that he wasn't satisfied with his relationship with God. And when he came to the this this this this cruc this moment this intersection he had to make a choice. &gt;&gt; And every when you come to God sometime God allow you to make a choice. &gt;&gt; If he knocks on the door some of us we get up and we answer the door. We let God in the living room. &gt;&gt; We invite God that you know what Lord you can come on. You can have something to eat. But when God goes over there to that one door, &gt;&gt; that one door, that that thing that nobody else knows about but you, &gt;&gt; nobody can see it but you. &gt;&gt; But you see, God is the God of the light and the dark. &gt;&gt; So what you done in the dark, sometimes it comes to the light. &gt;&gt; I was talking to one of my friends and sometimes I get the realization. I said, you know, if God was to one day lift the cover off of your life for 10 seconds, for 10 seconds. &gt;&gt; Now, mind 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. &gt;&gt; If God was to lift that cover off &gt;&gt; and we were to see what was behind that cover, &gt;&gt; all of us would be thanking God right now. &gt;&gt; We'd be shouting all around the room that God don't lift the cover. &gt;&gt; Because if God was to lift the cover, we would understand what God sees. &gt;&gt; He don't see everything that people can put up the front. He doesn't see the good Christian person. He sees the person that you are, &gt;&gt; the person that's deep down inside. But see, God allows us to one day go down on our knees &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, wash me. &gt;&gt; Lord, wash me in that blood." &gt;&gt; Oh my God. And when he washes you in that blood, &gt;&gt; he said you can come up white as snow. &gt;&gt; And see, if you haven't had that experience, you might not understand what I'm talking about. You might not understand the joy that I have that the world didn't give to me. Cuz when I look back over my life and realize what God has done for me, &gt;&gt; hey, I don't have to shout off of your testimony. I don't have to look at your testimony. I can go down and shout for myself. &gt;&gt; Because God has been real to me. &gt;&gt; Some people shouting off of other people testimony and don't have a testimony of their own. But you see that that it became different. Sometimes you'll hear people like they said to my brother was saying and I'm glad for the young people to come forward and I might not be that old as he said but listen I'm glad to see God being real to you &gt;&gt; because it's not till you have a real experience with God that you understand what's being talked about &gt;&gt; that you understand what actually everybody is so happy about what people come to church for and they shout all over the place. It's not a show. It's something that's real. &gt;&gt; But if it's never been real to you, you might just look at it and say, "They just doing that." &gt;&gt; But realizing that someday, sometime it's got to get real to you. &gt;&gt; If it don't, you going to miss it. &gt;&gt; It's that simple. &gt;&gt; If you don't decide to give up what you want, you going to miss God. &gt;&gt; When God comes knocking on your door, you need to answer. &gt;&gt; We don't have that much time to go. If you don't answer, you might miss it. &gt;&gt; And when and if you miss it, hey, you just here. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; And that's not something you want to be. &gt;&gt; That's not somewhere that you want to be when those bombs fall, when desolation and all these things come come on the earth. The prophet of God said that cancer would be like a toothache. &gt;&gt; If cancer is the worst thing on that we have right now, just imagine if that's like a toothache. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the pain that that takes people through. &gt;&gt; But you see, if it's like that, that's not something I want to be here for. &gt;&gt; That's not something that I want to experience. &gt;&gt; I I don't know about you, I don't want to exper unimaginable pain, &gt;&gt; unimaginable suffering. &gt;&gt; Like the things that are coming on this earth is not things that we can even imagine. &gt;&gt; So why would I want to go through that? Amen. &gt;&gt; But see, but are you satisfied with your relationship with God? &gt;&gt; Sometimes we get to the point that you know what, we just going through life. &gt;&gt; We go through our day and we come home and we do the same thing tomorrow and we do the same thing tomorrow. And then I don't know about you, but sometimes if you do something too much, it gets you a little depressed &gt;&gt; because you just get into this routine like is this all the life? Yeah, true. &gt;&gt; Is this is this what it is? &gt;&gt; I just work and I get money and then I use the money to pay a bill and then I never see this money bill because I'm always it's just a cycle that we're going through and we wake up and it's his cycle. And the only thing to break that cycle is having God in your life. And when God gets in your life, the it changes the cycle. You can go to work happy. You can go to work excited because you got something to tell somebody about. You got something to testify about how good God is. &gt;&gt; Wonder why you can't tell people a story or something? You can't come to work with something fresh on your mind because you you just got satisfied with where you was &gt;&gt; and that was all you want. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But sometimes you have to grow and not always be a baby. Amen. &gt;&gt; What I mean by that is sometimes that little experience that you have, it has to grow into something else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some people get a little experience and that's all the experience. Well, I know that God saved me. &gt;&gt; Well, God saved me. And that's the testimony. God saved me. God saved me. &gt;&gt; But at some point in time, do you do you grow from that? &gt;&gt; Do you grow from that? Is there another experience that you can point to where I know where God saved me and he healed me? &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the testimony. &gt;&gt; But sometimes you got to come to Lord, I know the experience that I had with you. &gt;&gt; And this ain't a far off experience. This was the experience yesterday. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I can talk about something that wasn't years ago that happened, but something that's real to me right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And said, I I thank God for the for the testimonies I heard today, especially the one about mental health, cuz that's a real thing. The devil is really attacking people's mind. The prophet of God said, "The greatest battle ever fought is in your mind." &gt;&gt; And I tell people all the time, some people, you know, they ask you that that that question. You, what superpower do you want? &gt;&gt; And some people like, I want to read minds. &gt;&gt; I I want to know exactly what people thinking about me. They even made a movie about it. And I said, you know what? I said, I would never want that &gt;&gt; because if I had to experience what you go through in your mind, Oh, Jesus. No. Mm- &gt;&gt; No, no, no. I had to see them demons that come attacking you. &gt;&gt; Oh, no. No, no, no. I had to see the devil try to take you out and bring you back. No, some people want that. But I said that ain't something that I want cuz the worst place to ever be is inside of someone's head &gt;&gt; because you never see you. Some people go through physical things. But I tell you that mental thing is a real thing &gt;&gt; because nobody sees what you going through. &gt;&gt; The people on the outside when you look at them, you don't see it. &gt;&gt; They might have a smile on their face. They say some people they be happy one day and gone the next. &gt;&gt; Why? Because there's things that they're battling in their mind. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to tell you, there's a God &gt;&gt; that can deliver you. Come on. &gt;&gt; See, if you didn't hear it today, God sent someone to tell you a testimony how he can deliver you from the mind battles that God is that you may be facing. &gt;&gt; I said, "And nobody is immune from it." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's the difference. Nobody is immune from it. &gt;&gt; Because the devil, if he can plant that seed and let it to grow, &gt;&gt; he knows that he can eventually get you. He knows if God don't come by and step in and God don't have someone interceding for you, &gt;&gt; God don't tell somebody, "Hey, pray for that someone in the middle of the night &gt;&gt; or in the middle of the day, God place them on your heart." If he don't do that, sometimes it's just that quick. &gt;&gt; And some people they do a thing and then be like, "It was a mistake." &gt;&gt; But you can't sometimes change it. &gt;&gt; And see, nobody knows the time, the day, or the hour. And I never profess that I would know what you going through. &gt;&gt; Some people like, "Yeah, you may understand, but sometimes if God if you ain't been through it, you truly don't understand. &gt;&gt; If you don't if you ain't faced it, you truly don't understand. &gt;&gt; See, sometimes it takes you coming up to a higher level in God for God to do the thing for you. It takes you not being satisfied and you actually don't care." And like the brother said today, he got down and the brother was on the altar. He didn't care who listened. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't care because in that moment he needed something that was real. &gt;&gt; And sometimes you got to get past my my my who going to look at me, who going to see me, who going who going to look at this? And you got to get past that and say, "Lord, today &gt;&gt; to right here in this moment, I need something from you. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm not satisfied. I don't want to go one more moment. I don't want to go one more step. I don't want to leave this place until you do something for me. [Applause] I said and I and because it was so crazy that he read the scripture there and I got down see the young rich ruler he was in the first half of the scripture but in the second half in verse down there in verse 32 there was another man &gt;&gt; no actually in verse let me write um 46 there's another man that got to the place that he wanted something &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; that man was blind Barnameus &gt;&gt; and when heard heard that Jesus was passing by that way. &gt;&gt; Heard, &gt;&gt; you know, he heard it. Somebody said, "Jesus coming by." &gt;&gt; Just like he is this morning. He's right here. &gt;&gt; He heard Jesus coming by. And you know what he said? He said, "Son of David, have mercy on me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, he sometimes you ain't got you can't care who's around you. See, while he was testifying and and Lord have mercy on me, there was people sh be quiet. &gt;&gt; You're making too much noise. &gt;&gt; Sh. No, you don't need all that right now. &gt;&gt; Sh, you know, just just go ahead. It's okay if you get on up. It's okay. The service is over. &gt;&gt; It's okay. Yeah, that's that's that's enough. But sometimes you got to supersede that and say, "Lord, I need something." &gt;&gt; I need something. &gt;&gt; And where other others may lead, this one may go, but I need something. &gt;&gt; And said Ron Barius, he got to the point that he got louder when they told him to be quiet. &gt;&gt; Because he knew in that moment, he said, "I'm not going to let Jesus go past me and not do something for me. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to let Jesus go walk past me and touch this one and touch that one and not touch me. I might be on the ground. I might be sitting here, but I'm not going to let him pass me by. &gt;&gt; That's good, brother. &gt;&gt; And and I want to read something um in verse 49. And he said, "And Jesus stood still &gt;&gt; and commanded him to be called." See, out of all the crowd of people, Jesus might couldn't see him, but he stood still. See, he he cried loud enough and cried hard enough that it got Jesus attention. &gt;&gt; And sometimes you got to get to the point that Lord, I got to get your attention. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm just a poor weak sinner, but Lord, I'm crying because I've given all up &gt;&gt; because I want something for you. &gt;&gt; You can't fill a half filled cup and expecting to feel everything to go into it. &gt;&gt; You got to empty out. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I like to tell people if you want to get the Holy Ghost, the simplest way is to give everything up. &gt;&gt; That's all you got to do. &gt;&gt; Give up your plans. Give up your dreams. Give up this girl. Give up this guy. Give up this money. Give up this people. Give up the things that you created in your mind as a vision for what I want my future to look like. &gt;&gt; You got to give all that up. Good, brother. &gt;&gt; You got to give all that up &gt;&gt; in order for God to fill you up. &gt;&gt; And when God fills you up, he'll give you He'll say, "I might not or I might not tell you your steps like they said this morning, but I will order your steps." &gt;&gt; You don't have to see what the staircase looks like, but as long as you Jesus is with you, he'll say, "Take this step." &gt;&gt; And when you take that step, you realize, "Oh, Lord, I thank you cuz I was going that way, but there you Oh, hallelujah." And see, when you understand that he orders your steps, &gt;&gt; my my my it moves you in a different direction. &gt;&gt; And and it reads, "And they called to my man, saying, be of good comfort. Rise he calleth thee." And then I verse 50 is where I got it. And he, this is the most pivotal thing. He cast away his garments. &gt;&gt; See, he realized in order for me to get to Jesus, I got to leave something. Amen. &gt;&gt; I got to leave something here because when Jesus does the work for me, I don't need that no more. &gt;&gt; When I when I leave this here today, I'm not picking it up no more. That's not important to me anymore because I met someone that has done something for me that has changed my life. &gt;&gt; Says sometime many of times we get like the young rich ruler. We get satisfied. So we we comfortable in what we have. We get comfortable in what God has blessed us with thus far. &gt;&gt; But but if we want if we understand that sometimes God asks for your most precious thing, &gt;&gt; whatever that is, &gt;&gt; he'll ask for your most precious thing. &gt;&gt; Whether that might be your girlfriend, &gt;&gt; your boyfriend, &gt;&gt; whatever is your most precious thing. See, for the young rich ruler, it was his possessions. But yours might be um it might be your career. &gt;&gt; It might be the the thing that you have envisioned or you thought about that this is where I want to head in life. &gt;&gt; But God asks for your most precious thing sometimes. Not because he's not going to give it to you. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. Preach. It's because he wants you to realize that the path that you might be taking might not be the path that I want you to go. But if you go the way I want you to go, you may end up greater &gt;&gt; than the path that you wanted to go on. &gt;&gt; But if you don't realize that, Lord, I got to surrender this &gt;&gt; because it's not greater than you. I got to give this up because it's not greater than you. Cuz Lord, I'm not satisfied with where I am with you. I'm not satisfied with the relationship I got with you right now. But in order for me to grow closer to you, I got to give something up. &gt;&gt; I got to let this go because when I get closer to you, Lord, you I want nothing to hinder me from going all the way. I want nothing to stop me from going all the way. Lord, I want nothing to hinder me from going to heaven. I want nothing to stop me from getting over there. &gt;&gt; So when God calls you, you got to let some things go. Even though you might not want to, but if you let it go, God will give you exactly what you need and exceedingly abundantly more than you asked or thought &gt;&gt; because that's the God that we serve. &gt;&gt; But I ask the question to you, are you satisfied? &gt;&gt; Are you satisfied or are you just settling? Good brother. &gt;&gt; Are you settling &gt;&gt; and saying this is all that I want and this is all that I need. &gt;&gt; Then I question to ask you, are you just like the people that he said they're rich, increase with good, have need of nothing? &gt;&gt; Is that you? That's the question that I asked you this morning. &gt;&gt; All heads bowed and eyes closed. Lord, we've heard the word this morning. Lord, you spoke about maximizing our potential. And then Lord, you ask us, are we satisfied with our relationship with you, Lord? We don't want to settle, Lord. We don't want to get to that place where, Lord, we say, Lord, you know, I don't need more of you. But Lord, this morning, I ask that you would do something. that you would change a heart, a mind, a life that when they leave this place, your presence goes with them. And Lord, when they leave this place, they're forever changed. Lord, we ask that you just move in a mighty and a special way. [Music] Oh hallelujah Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes Jesus. &gt;&gt; God is calling somebody this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah Jesus. &gt;&gt; In that still small voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You could come to Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; You can make your way to the altar this morning. &gt;&gt; If you haven't repented and been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Why not do it today? While the master is calling, somebody come home this morning. Somebody come to Jesus. &gt;&gt; He wants to give you life and peace. &gt;&gt; He wants to give you joy unspeakable and full of glory. &gt;&gt; But it takes courage sometimes. Takes a willing heart to say, "Jesus, &gt;&gt; tired of the way that I am. &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; help me, God. &gt;&gt; I need your help. &gt;&gt; Can't make it without you. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, &gt;&gt; hallelujah." &gt;&gt; Somebody cry out this morning. &gt;&gt; Somebody, &gt;&gt; oh Jesus, &gt;&gt; make that confession today. Yes, &gt;&gt; you're back and you want to come back to God. &gt;&gt; Why not do it today? &gt;&gt; While the blood is running warm in your veins, &gt;&gt; the master is calling. &gt;&gt; Come to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Do it for somebody.

Set him free. &gt;&gt; Oh God. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed this morning to come to the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said if you deny me, I deny you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God wants to set you free. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You don't have to leave and be the same. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You heard the word. &gt;&gt; Don't let it be played back one day.

Come to Jesus right now. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Yes God. Do it for right now. While on the other side calling Jesus do will not pass me by. &gt;&gt; The altar is always open. &gt;&gt; You want to come this morning? &gt;&gt; Come on. He said no wise turn you down. &gt;&gt; Come on. We got time to pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; We got time to get in the presence of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See what God can do in your life. &gt;&gt; Come on. He wants to change you this morning. He wants to do something real like that saying. It don't have to be the same. &gt;&gt; Come on. Just going in and going out. But God wants to do something real in your life. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Thank you.

I said, "But one thing about it, sir." &gt;&gt; We started going down the line of so many that's dead and gone. I said, "If you would only listen when God was calling, you didn't have to go through all the life heartaches and pains, but falling in love with Jesus &gt;&gt; was the best thing that I ever done. Save me from a lot of heartache. &gt;&gt; Save me from a lot of pain. &gt;&gt; Save me from a lot of struggles and battles. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Don't make that mistake. Come on. Oh, Jesus.
