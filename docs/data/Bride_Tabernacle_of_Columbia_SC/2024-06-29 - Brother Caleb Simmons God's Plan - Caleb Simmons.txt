three are gathered in my name there I would be in the midst Lord Lord we ask you to come down and touch every need Lord touch every heart and every desire Lord bless those that are sick and shut in and Lord those that are on the prayer list Lord we ask you come down and move in such a mighty and a special way in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen if you have your Bibles tonight ask you to turn to Genesis chap 37 very familiar scripture and a very familiar Story chapter 37 and we'll start in the 28th verse and there passed by the midianites merchant men and they drew and they lifted up Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to the ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver and they brought Joseph into in into Egypt and Reuben return and Reuben returned unto the pit and behold Joseph was not in the pit and rent his clothes and he returned unto his brother and said the child is not and I whether shall I go God bless the readings of his word and you may be seated amen if you read down and you read more into the story you find out that Joseph ends up in Egypt amen how many know the story tonight amen amen Joseph end UPS in Egypt and I entitled a little topic that I I call God's plan God's plan and if you talk about the story of Joseph he realized that when Joseph got into the midst of many things he didn't understand the reason but it was all part of God's plan and realizing that God took him through things to show for that he had a reason for why he went through he had a reason for what he was going through even though Joseph didn't understand and Joseph didn't even understand the plan but he trusted him he trusted God throughout all that he was going through and if you go to chapter 39 and verse 20 Joseph ended up working for This Man Called Piper and because of the gift that God had given Joseph the Lord allowed him to be elevated no matter where he went no matter what he was doing God allowed him to be elevated and he gave him favor he gave him favor in the sight of men and then in this story it says that Joseph wife she came and she tempted well Piper's wife she came and she tempted Joseph and she tempted him and ended up telling a lie on him and ended up in verse 20 it says and Joseph's Master took him and put him into the prison a place where the king's prisoners were bound and he was there in prison see one day Joseph got bound but it was just part of his journey it wasn't the end of his journey it was part of his journey because God had a plan for his life and when he was going through the Journey people lied on them people mistreated them but Joseph had to go to prison to end up on the throne am Joseph had to go to prison he had to be lied on to end up in in front of pharaoh and it was a purpose in the plan that God had for him even though Joseph might not have understood there was a purpose in God to his brothers throwing him in the pit and being jealous and sometimes we look at life and we go through things and why this person don't like me Joseph own family didn't like him and they threw him in a pit and sold him away and that was their own flesh and blood and just imagine just and you look at yourself and say why I have to go through these things but if Joseph hadn't been sold he wouldn't end up in potier house if he wouldn't end up in potera house and ptera wife lying on him he would have end up in prison and if you read down in the story some more it you realize that when he got to prison he ran into a couple of people that worked in Pharaoh's house and they both had dreams and God gave Joseph the the ability to interpret dreams it was a gift that God had given him and God used those gifts see see that when God gives you something it's a reason for him giving it to you it's all a part of his purpose and his plan Joseph had this disability when he was a child but he didn't know the things that it was going to turn into later on down in life he didn't realize the benefit of what it was the gift that he had as a child where was going to benefit him in the end and he ended up interpreting the dream and he said I got one request when you go back and you see Pharaoh remember me amen and sometimes you may be in a low Place may be in a dark place but wherever you find yourself in that's what Paul said no matter what place of space I find myself in I found out there with to be content cuz he realized that even though no matter how bad it got God always had a plan it wasn't just something that was willy-nilly happening to him it was something that God had planned out and ordered his steps and he had a way for him to go and when he was going to get there he would realize why God had took him that way so you might not understand the purpose or the plan but all you have to do is trust him and God will show you eventually it might not be tomorrow but he'll show you why he took you that way why he let this happen why he let that trial happen it was only to give him glory see God had a plan and see God has a way that he might not show you I originally entitled I said God's hidden plan cuz sometime God knows the plan but it's hidden from you it's not plain to you you don't always know where the end of the steps going to lead you but if you keep going up eventually you will land you won't be traveling far it's not a stair step where keep going in a circle but even if it's going in a circle God don't let it continue to go on the circle eventually you'll be able to walk straight and walk plain cuz God allows that to happen and sometimes he leads you through it to make you stronger amen you get on the stair step when you do it and many of times if you ever on one if you haven't let me tell you about it it'll get you sweating it'll get you tired and your legs might be hurting and when you get off you start to wobble and see when you go through certain things it's such a burden on you sometimes that it'll cause you to wobble but if you keep doing it you get stronger if you keep going through it and realize Lord even throughing my test and trial I found a way to thank you yall find a way to thank you cuz even though I don't understand you have a I was going through something and I got to the space and I was I transitioned to working on a job and you know what when I first got there you know sometimes we have these things in our mind of how we think or things should go so we sitting in and sometimes I was sitting in a meeting and I was like I don't know why they up there talking about stuff we already know cuz sometimes you go you you sitting in the class and you be like I don't know why the teacher teaching me something that I already know so I got there and I started thinking these things in my mind and I started thinking and then something came to me and said you know what God put you here he had a reason for putting you here so thank him because you didn't have to be here he didn't have to place you here and while I was going through it I started changing my I said Lord thank you I'm just grateful to be here and then they start telling us how many people applied for the position and didn't get it and they said yeah you was one of 1500 I said oh cuz I I I didn't look at it like that cuz I didn't know I looked at it I just just happen chance to be here and sometimes we go through life and we just happen chance to be here and that's how we take it for granted and don't realize that God had a reason and a plan and he specifically put you there and put the people around you so that you could be there for a reason amen cuz he had a plan even though you might not have understood it but he had a plan for why he took you through it and so I started to changeing my attitude it's like you know what how can I be a benefit how can I be a blessing how can I cuz God put me here for a reason and I don't even understand to the point I started thinking we was having another meeting and I I thought sometimes your mouth can get ahead of you before before you before you actually do a thing so you start talking and I said oops I might have done overs spoke but even in my what I was thinking was over speaking God allowed that to be a testimony of what he was doing and I started and I'm starting to even seeing the blessing said you know what God was even I prayed Lord let your will be done I prayed Lord give me wisdom and even in those moments that I'm looking back I said you know what I didn't over speak there were some people that didn't speak up enough and they ended up doing something that they didn't necessarily think that they wanted to do but I was speaking and I was just asking questions as the Lord was leading me and I was like asking this and asking that and I ended up in a place that I was using things that I've already learned and it's a benefit and I started saying you know what maybe that was God's plan for me to just open he gave me the mouth for a reason he he ordered your lips sometimes and you speak and God will bless it and move in a way that you don't even understand you don't can't see what the things that you are speaking but sometimes you got to be careful what you speak you got to be careful because Pastor was saying something the other day he said I'm going to hold it cuz the devil listening and said sometimes you speaking the thing and the devil listening he said oh mhm and he make sure that he come down and and bother you just in that moment of what you speaking about so some things you got to hold but some things you can make plain in faith amen it's not about what you thinking or what you're going through it's about what you're speaking in faith and you speaking this thing in faith that you know that God honors his word cuz you'll never go wrong speaking God's word you'll never go wrong calling out his promises cuz he's still God and he said if I put it in my word it's for you to speak it so it can be made may come to come plain before you I said Jesus had a reason that I thought about in Joshua what talks about Rahab and said that he sent those two spies into the land those spies didn't know that Rahab was in that City they didn't know that somebody was going to spread the words that spy was in the city and they was going to be stuck in that City but God had a plan through all the time even all Rahab might not have what we call the best life she might not have had the best testimony and if you get a chance to read it in Joshua chapter 2 you'll read about her story and what she was and those men she she just had something in her that nobody understood but she had that heart I said sometimes you don't see the heart of a person you just see their actions you just hear what they say but you don't see their heart I said many a times you don't know who may make it just because of what God has placed in them that you cannot see amen and I said that Rahab she had the heart heart she said I heard about y'all and I know that these things that that y'all saying is true so I'm going to hide you and she hit him and then you look down and you read the story and you go to Matthew and you realize that God used her even with her life God came and took her and she he put her in the lineage of Jesus amen amen see God had a plan amen it was something that we didn't understand and we probably wouldn't have chose to because we she did this and he did that and all these things that had happened to her but God even used her to save her whole family amen see God had a purpose and God had a plan and she wasn't afraid to go tell them come into my house because this city is going to fall she wasn't afraid to go tell somebody that there was destruction that was on the way you need to get in and you need to get in now because God has provided me a way of escape and as long as you was in these doors with that cord hanging out that window God will protect you and keep you too see they might not have knew the god that she knew but you know what they said I'm going to listen that was the difference some of them realize you know what you know it was something might have been deep in inside you know what she telling the truth and and they came and they came into her house and they were saved with her amen see sometimes you never know what you speaking and who's listening you never know what words are going to touch somebody life that because God has a plan in using you to reach somebody my mentor used to say he said don't ever get afraid of other people no matter what the level or anything cuz he said what God got who God got for them to reach and who he got you to reach and who he got you to reach he ain't got them to reach that's why God he used in the word where he gave the many different gifts he wouldn't have gave all the gifts and one could reach everybody amen but he did that for a reason to show he's a god of variety he knew that there was going to be somebody that was going to be that was going to hear him when he preached some is going to hear him when he teach somebody wasn't going to hear him until he prophesy amen but that was God gave them so that he could reach him because he has a plan he knows that one day he he won't lose him so he had to give away to reach everyone and said that I thought about and I read in the scripture about Samson I said you know that even though Samson he fell but God had a purpose in him amen amen Samson it might have been that Samson had gotten lifted up and said you know what it's just me I know what it is it's my hair but maybe he wanted to see what it was like to not have it we don't know but he fell and he allowed Rahab to trick him but he knew Delilah yep that's the one see all of us make mistakes and you know sometimes most people all they hear is the mistake well maybe it was for somebody to wake up so so de Delilah he allowed Delilah to trick him but when when Delilah he got down and he was they imprisoned him and and Samson had to pay for his mistak they took his eyes but one day he might have been he had maybe God allowed him to go there to get along I said don't don't let let don't have a fall and someone to take your eyes for you to get along with God cuz then he started to remember all the things that God had done and he got to that point he said and they got to having a great feast and they remember oh Samson here let's go pick at him but they didn't realize his hair was coming back they didn't realize they might have did it once but you got to keep that they had to always keep maintaining it and his hair had grew back and Samson got to the point he said once more Lord he realized that no matter what all the things he said he had got right with God by there he said if I die that's fine with me but Lord while I'm dying take all the rest of them with me and they and they said during this time there was more he said let me die with the Philistines and he bowed himself with all his might and the house fell upon the Lord and upon the people that were therein so so the death which he slew at his dead the dead so the dead which he slew at his death were more than which he slew in his life amen see he got to the end and realized you know even if I die Lord let me take them all with me he he he he wasn't leaving none of those demons to terrorize none of the people of God that was left he said I want to take all of them when I go I want to make sure that these Devils don't don't don't bother them no more that these demons don't go around that these people are not going to torment your people anymore because if that's the that can be the greatest part of my testimony it was a story of redemption see God had a plan he redeemed Samson and he brought him and lot him to slew more in his death than he did in his entire life some people just look at the moment and they look at they look at what's done in a lifetime but in that death sometimes you can reach the greatest amount of people just from the life that he live and they said I think they said he slew 3,000 in his death and and and I remember one time they said with a I think with a Jawbone he slew a thousand but see that that life that he had realized and got back with God and God used him in a mighty way because he had a plan and said even in Samson's fall God had a plan Samson might not have understood it or knew it and said and he had a plan in it said God has a way of turning every situation and Circumstance around for his glory if that's his will God has a way of doing that and and I thought about it um in Isaiah he said for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayth the Lord see God has a way that he knows what he wants and he knows his will and he has a way for your life to go but God put us on Earth to give us a choice amen he allowed you to say yes and no but even in that sometimes he'll take you around like he did the children of Israel 40 years into the Wilderness before he allowed them to enter their Promised Land because he had a reason for it because some of them they didn't believe I said much more if we just believe we can go on we can mature we can get all the promises of God by just believeing see but God has a plan and he has a way of sometimes he got to take you through it for you to understand that he's still God and he's still the one that heals he's still the one that delivers he's still the one that sets free because he has a plan in all of it and even though you might not understand it he still got that plan for you all you got to do is trust him believe in him and completely Surrender Your Life to him that's it and that's all he wants from you because his and that's his way I said brother brandom he he told a story about one day having a plane and that plane being delayed many of us know the story but if you don't there was somebody that was praying amen that got down on their knees and brother brandom didn't understand why he he had to go this way but and I asked the question I said but he felt something leading him and he listened and I thought about it I asked the question are we tuned in enough to hear when God speaks to us are we tuned in enough to hear when God speaks to us and if we are do we listen cuz it's something to hear it but it's another thing to listen and do it that's totally different remember many times I thought about it sometimes your parents can tell you to do a thing and you listen you heard it and they say go in one year and come out the other and sometimes we do God the same way we hear them we listen but but sometimes he ask us to do a hard thing just like he asked he asked that Young Rich truler it might have been something that seemed hard to him but if he would have known where his end was going to be he would have done it I think if you could go back and ask him right now if he would have known what his end was going to be do you think he would have done it he probably would tell you yes if he known that he was going to end up where he ended up he would have done it in a heartbeat but he couldn't go back sometimes you got to listen when that knock come to your door because you never know when it's that's the last one that's that last knock that's coming through your coming to you cuz God got a purpose and he got a plan that's why he comes and knocks at your door that's why he comes because he has a way of getting your attention of getting your attention getting my attention and each one he deals with us individually it's not the way that he reaches out to me he might reach out to you but God still does it because he got a plan and he has a purpose and he has a way that seems unseemly to man but it's his way and that's the one that he wants to lead you and guide you but when he comes you got to answer amen God Don't Force us way through the door amen he come there he knocking he wants you to open it because he gave you the choice even though he has a purpose in a plan he still wants you to say Lord I Surrender Lord I Surrender and you never get too high that you can't get down and say Lord I Surrender never forget that you can you are not Mighty enough and strong enough and high enough to get get lifted up in yourself that you can't say Lord I Surrender and if you ain't done it in a while maybe you have to go back to it and say Lord I'm sorry Lord I got lifted up in myself Lord I thought I can do it because what you don't want to do is let God humble you because God has a way of humbling you that you don't know how it's going to end up but let you you get down on your knees and say Lord I come before you as humble as I know how because I don't know what I'm doing Lord I don't know the way I don't know the plan that you have for me but Lord I'm coming and I'm searching it out I'm getting on my knees and said Lord I need you to make it plain to me Lord I need you to lead me I need you to guide me cuz I don't know the way but sometimes you get a little lifted up cuz others will do that to you they'll put you in position that you you forget that it's just by grace and mercy that you even there it's just by grace and mercy that God has given you the ability to be there and you listening to them and you start well I did this and I did that and I did this but that's just a trap of the enemy cuz he wants you to start thinking that you did it all but if you start realizing you know it's just a blessing that I'm here it's just a blessing that God plac me here and Lord if it wasn't for the ones that were around me I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for you touching their heart giving them to see me in a good light Lord if it wasn't for you being trained up in the right way being brought up in the right house and learn that good man is in different things I wouldn't be where I am today see but you don't think about those small things because you done under maiden and you have arrived Jesus thank you Lord but God has a plan and see that plan it's not how you thought it was that's why sometimes God got to let you be relieved of certain things so you can get clear and realize it's only by him that you made it where you was it's only by him that you are where you are because it's by the grace of God see that's part of his plan too that's why he went to Calvary and died so that you could understand what Mercy was so that you could understand what Grace was and so that you could take advantage of it he didn't just do it so no one would take advantage of it but he wanted you to go there and lay down and realize that it's only by his grace and mercy it's only because he loved you Lord and see I'm learning more and more day and day as you go through things that you know lord it's all because of you it's only because of you that I'm here it's only because of you that I'm even going through what I'm going through because if it wasn't for you and you start looking at it and thinking about say Lord is for your glory Lord Is For Your Glory and then you start looking at it and even though you might have some hard moments because you're human even though you might have some down moments because you're human but if you look sometimes God will bring somebody just to say a word to touch your KNE to touch you in that moment so you can be uplifted and remember that it's only because of God that you can even have pain there are some people that are dead and gone they can't feel nothing sometimes you say Lord want it no more but I don't want to feel it no more but there there's a reason why God gives you the pain there's some people that I remember I was in a in a in an instruction um Taekwondo class and they was said you had to do a certain thing said how people use their body is they deaden the nerves in them so they don't feel pain but there's a reason why God gives you pain so that you'll know something is wrong say some of those people they go and they break their leg and never feel it but God has a reason for everything that he built he put these things there so that you would understand you would feel this thing and said it's a blessing to feel pain sometimes because when you feel when when you come through the pain you more grateful and thankful for not feeling pain you more grateful and thankful that you don't have to feel pain no more when you have a good day versus a bad day when you don't feel like the world is crashing down on you cuz sometimes you do feel that that if you're human and you live long enough you experience that sometimes and but it's something when God lifts you up it's something when you go to him and you lead those burdens on him and you can feel the burdens be lifted because he has a plan for allowing you he just want to show you that I'm a heavy I'm a heavy lifter that I can lift all your burdens I can deliver you from everything that you're going through all you got to do is come to me and lay it down all you got to do is come to me and trust me all you got to do is realize that I have a plan for you that I have something and a purpose that I want you to fulfill but all you got to do is trust me yes Lord if you don't trust him you'll never figure out what his plan is you will never get down humble enough to realize that it's not what you want but it's what he wants for your life it's not what you want to do it's what he wants you to do with your life because he has a plan for you am said I can think about and I read the prophet of God he talks about he talks about the geese and how that God gives him what he called instinct to move from one place to another but he realized that they wouldn't survive if he didn't give it to him see God put put this in him because he had a plan that he had a way of allowing them to move from place to place he put it inside of them that they would know that when a certain temperature or a certain time it said when you can tell with like the horses and the animals they can tell when the storm's coming a long way before you see that storm it's something that he placed in them see he has a plan that he warns you they said many of times when an earthquake comes all the animals they they disappear from the place because they God had a plan before them that they know so sometimes all you have to do is listen and watch and many times we don't watch and ask God lord what's your plan Lord what you have me to do Lord what would you have me to go and others may even see it before you do the people that don't go to church sometimes they see a thing before you do cuz they recognize hey this ain't natural hey this ain't normal um you can't see this and and you sitting there and sometimes it it gets you sometimes because when you when when you finally on see it it's like man I was sitting in here the whole time and I didn't see this but God has a reason that sometimes it's just to wake you up that you got to get closer to him to hear and see and search out what his plan is for you what he wants you to do and how he wants you to do it because God has a way that we may not understand but it's all a part of his plan it's all in what he wants us to do it's all in how he's leading us and guiding us but if you never ask him Lord what would you have me to do Lord what is your plan for my life you'll never find it out you will never understand or you will never see it because you're not looking for it and many of times we get well we don't want to look for it because we got our idea for what we want and how we want it to go go but we realize that if you one of God's children you can go in that Circle if you want to but you'll end the right back where you where God wants you to be you can go in that Circle but you can miss all that hurt and that pain going in that Circle to get back right exactly where God wants you to be so that he can do what he wants with your life amen see everybody don't have to be like Caleb where he said even though I'm old I'm still able to go conquer my Mountain God want to use people when they used sometimes God doesn't matter what age and phase you are if he wants to use you let him use you amen let him use you because he has a purpose and what he wants to do with your life amen and you never know when the moment may come that you might not be able to do what he wants you to do amen you never know because you go through and say I got plenty of time there's many people that say I got plenty of time that I a't here no more amen amen there's many people that say I I do it next year when I get a certain age but God ain't looking for when you get a certain age God ain't looking for when a certain time come he not looking for when when I feel like it he looking for you to move right now when he call you he not looking for you to say when I get this and this and this lined up then I'll do it he he if he calls you now move amen move because there's so many people that don't move and you see the thing that happen to them but you don't understand maybe you're not looking cuz you don't want to see it amen amen but God has a way of calling you that you know is God that you know deep down in the inside that is God it's not anybody else that could call you and tell you and something like the woman at the well it wasn't no one that could come and tell her her story but God and she said we've learned that when he come he would do these things said you might not know but you know it's God calling you listen to him cuz he has a plan for you he got something that he wants you to do and he's knocking at your door and sometimes he knocks as some people's door for a while but don't let it be a while go go and answer that door because it's the best thing that could ever happen to you it's the best thing that you could ever do with your life I've never heard someone that gave their life to God that their life didn't improve it wasn't better I never heard someone that gave the life to God that things didn't turn out better for him that the living a Christian life wasn't better for them than where they could have been and they would have been and all they had to do is look at somebody that was where they was in that time of life and they can see what happened to them and realize that the life that I live is much better it's much better it's filled with blessing even with my struggles my test and my trial it's still much better than living where they might have lived and done what I might have done and I'm still here only by the grace of God because he had a plan for my life he had something that he wanted me to do and it's only by God God's grace that I'm still here that I'm living that I can go on and I can testify that God is good that he's a Wonder workking Mighty God that he's a Healer he's a deliver he's a savior he's someone that I can go to in my time of need and say Lord I need help he's someone I can go to when I'm down and out and say Lord Lift Me Up Lord give me joy give me happiness give me peace Lord and sometimes you got to go to them cuz you need it it's something that you need it's above all and there's no one you can turn to it's not friends it's not family but you can go to him and say Lord I need you I need you to show me what you want me to do Lord I need you to show me your plan cuz Lord if I keep going I'm going to fumble and I'm going to stumble but when you show it to me I can walk down with joy and happiness I can take the test in the trial I can go through because Lord I realize that it's turning around for me I realize that what I'm going through I got a different Outlook because I know that I'm in your plan I know that I'm in your promise Lord I know I'm doing what you want me to do and as long as I'm there Lord you got me covered Lord you got a hedge around me Lord you got me and you going to deliver me out of it all see David did wasn't worried about Saul cuz he knew that God had already anointed him and he said don't touch Saul cuz he's still God's anointing but as long as he's there I'm going to leave him alone and even though he might chase me see God got a plan in all that see God had a plan and a reason say it's all there for a purpose and when God get through with you you'll realize why he took you through why he brought you through and you can give him more glory and more honor and more praise because God is just that good said Lord we want
