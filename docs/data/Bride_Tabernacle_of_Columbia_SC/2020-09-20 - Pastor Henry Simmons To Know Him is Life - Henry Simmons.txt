said make a joyful noise unto the lord all your land serve the lord with gladness come before his presence with singing know ye that the lord he is god it is he that has made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the sheep of his patch and into his gates with thanksgiving and to its courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name for the lord is good his mercy is everlasting and his truth endure to all generation may god bless you reading this word you may be seated psalm 63. the bible says old taste and see that the lord he's good we're serving a god that's so good and his mercy endured forever psalm 63 says oh god thou art my god early will i seek thee my soul thirsts for thee my flesh long for thee in a dry and a thirsty land where no water is to see thy power and thy glory so as i have seen thee in the sanctuary because thy lovingkindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thus will i bless thee while i live i will lift up my hands in thy name we thank the lord for the word again we thank the lord this morning because to know him is life to not to know him is another thing to think that we know him is trouble because we're living in america and most people that we see and we meet you go to the grocery store you get something they say god bless you the restaurant or anywhere you go the people will say god bless you so they may be um saying something vulgar or cursing or whatever but they come out their mouth and they say god bless you and if you relax the average person no matter what their condition is and how they live their lives they said i know god somebody was just telling me the experience that they had with god and because they had certain experience with god they said i know the law and i know god to know him is to love him are you with me to know him is to love him you know we presume and we venture without authority we think we know one another but do we really know one another somebody said well i live with my wife or my husband and i know him i know her and sometimes we find ourselves in a learning experience we find ourselves that life itself is evolving and going from day to day and things change some things that come out of us we didn't know was in us some of the twists and turns that we do in life we find out that we never thought we'll take those twisters in those turns sometimes it's something things that come out of our mouth or we never thought we'd say sometimes it's thing that folks do in life that they said they never do but you know somebody said just keep on living just keep on living and you'll find out life life has his ups and his downs and sometimes even individuals that you think you know sometimes the ones that you think you're so close attached to sometimes your best friend can be your worst enemy you could not tell judas that he didn't know the law because judas had that personal contact with the lord and he was able to you know be a friend jesus when judas had betrayed him and kissed him and he said friend you betray me with a kiss so he can get close enough to him that he could kiss him he can feel that kind of way that he perhaps said i love him but he denied it peter probably thought he had such a relationship with god that he really knew he really knew the lord to know him as life peter said i i i don't deny you i would never deny you why because he thought that his relationship with jesus was so tight that he wouldn't let anything separate him from the jesus that he knew the messiah that he confessed but yet he cursed and swear that i don't even know the man are you with me so even in our christian walking and in our life we might think and presume that we know god because we come to church maybe because we pay our tithes and our offering or maybe because we are faithful to church we can say i know him but remember i said to know him is life are you with me so he says that loving kindness is better than life because because sometimes we look at this perverted life that came through sin and uh that we're traveling through amen it's not god's life it's not zoe it's not god's life this is a temporary life that you might see in the physical realm and you're able to contact with your five senses and maybe with your affection your imagination and content and memory but down in the soul do you know it in your soul do you know him in the depths of your heart do you know the law because to know him is life sometimes the way we conduct ourselves amen your response to his word how you respond to you to the word of god it determines whether you know him or not see because our response amen to his word seem as though that we are so far from you lord because we are not in contact with the one that we say we know and that we love many times the ones that say they know the law i wanted to go to the script of the scripture but i'll tell you some stories about the different ones that knew said they know the law nevertheless i think apostle paul he was called saul of tarshish i believe he can say i know the lord he probably could quote most of the bible that was in the old testament and he probably amen had exceeded amen education and intelligent wise he was very intelligent and he amen he knew the law in other words the bible said the letter killed it but the spirit gave it life but he knew the law he was so very versed in the word are you with me it reminded me of paul amen he said i didn't come to you they met with excellency of speech uh enticing words of man's wisdom amen but he realized that uh all of this uh uh intellectual amen ism uh uh it didn't amen it didn't cause me to uh know or to understand god i i thought i i knew him because i was taught the word and i i i i i i was zealous for god and amen i i i i i i i what i knew i put it in action amen i would fight and i would amen i was able to stand up for what i believe i believed that in the jewish religion that there was only one god amen he said know ye that the lord he's god and he probably was very versed in isaiah amen and he knew that he said amen god should have no other god before men and know ye amen that besides me there was no god form neither shall i be after me he knew that there was only one god here oh israel for the lord our god is one lord but here there's one called jesus in acts 9 this one called jesus amen that folks are going out worshiping the one that called jesus as it was in that day in the early churches so it is in dusty paul says had they known him they would not have crucified the lord of glory amen he said which none of the princes of this world knew if they would have known who he was they would not have killed him are you with me i believe that he's been crucified today in many of the churches today the very word that they say they believe the very god they say they trust brother and sister let's not put it on the church let's put it on yo let's look deep within us and let's examine ourselves do we really know the lord the father said no yes that the lord he is god amen for many people don't know that the lord is god so paul on his way down to the masters amen a light shine from heaven he's going to persecute the church a lot of times folk came in and they they prosecute the very word in the very bible they say they believe the very god that is supposed to be starving they prosecute them very wide the very masses that is supposed to be they've prosecuted there's an impersonation of christianity amen people they meant say they love god amen that's why they meant jesus was saying the same tombs that they meant that you amen acknowledged and they met in the same tunes they meant that you were honoring abraham odds and jacob and the prophets of old amen you're the one that put them in there [Music] same ones you killed your father you of your father the devil could they take that no because the very god of the prophets were there standing there the very god that they're supposed to were trusting to come in and to be with them they're very they meant messiah that they were praying that he would come they didn't know it to know him is life he come to give them life but they they they they wanted something physical and tangible and something that they can relate to because their minds had been already uh indoctrinated and they thought that even because of the teachings they meant without them knowing in their subconscious they were looking for god of their particular persuasion and he did not come according to their persuasion brother and sister what are we looking for i said to know him is life what are we searching what do i do what do we want what kind of god are we looking for to know him is a life praise god are we looking for a god of our own choosing our own imagination nevertheless subconsciously paul a saul of tasha's on his way to the masters this god that he was looking for would be amen a pharisee because he was a pharisee of the failures pharisee and the god that they were looking for would be a pharisee and because amen jesus was not amen exalting the pharisees religion and he was not amen a part of their particular persuasion paul says that it must be wrong it must be amen ah this man need this that's this heresies need to be stopped amen because he believed what he believed anything different from that he thought he knew the law he knew him amen according to what he read about he knew him for what he was brought up in sometimes subconsciously amen we only know the god amen because we've been taught somebody taught you amen and you rested upon and you stood upon what you've been taught amen but paul one day he had an experience when the light shines from heaven and he fell to the earth amen he realized this wasn't amen uh the sunlight because it was brighter than the noonday sun he knew that this was a supernatural light and he knew amanda that it was the law something down inside of him said this light amen is god and he said to the light he said who are you lord when he fell he said it's hard for thee to kick against debris amen brother and sister amen you need to shut down in do i know him do i know him come on let's wake up let's get serious about our journey don't wait till it's too late and find out i never knew the lord i never got serious enough about my soul never got down to business i never prayed till i got my breakthrough amen i prayed long enough but i wasn't hungry and thurston amen for righteousness i i i was thirsting amen for a minute a better life to live in this life amen but i i i was just trusted for a way of escape out of out of my family situation out of my domestic situation i i was searching for a social type gospel i was searching for a church that i can relate to but we don't want something that you can relate to i touch for the living god oh yes lord oh that i might know him in the power of his resurrection paul says and in the fellowship of his suffering i want to know god god i want to know that you're real i want to know that you god oh yes i want to annoy him brother sister amen i don't want to thank amen praise god this is jesus identifying himself in his own word this is christ again in word form amen this is the word made flesh again jesus christ jesus coming down to you and i speaking to us and amen praise god this is the word made life amen this is the living epistle written and read of all men this is christ jesus in word form amen praise god jesus was amen the word made flesh and now we see the amen the flesh being made word amen now he's going back to what he was before he became flesh he was the word in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god are you with me in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shining in the darkness and the darkness comprehended it not are you with me it was the pirate god the god that was above us became the god that was with us and the god that was with us became the god to join us do you know him to know him his life amen i know him praise god i know him oh hallelujah i don't care how or how much of abraham seed jacob was jacob had to have an experience with god when he got desperate enough amen he amen he wrestled with the angels until daybreak he said i won't let you go till you bless me amen jacob amanda means deceiver amen but he wraps it up and he prevailed and became a prince with god amen his name was changed from jacob to israel amen god gave him a new name amen with that new name came a new jacob amen he was no more a deceiver but he was a prince with god brother sister we need amen to take up experience where god can do something with all yours said i met him and i know that i know that

oh yes it's real amen nobody can talk you out of it to know him is life there's no more eye to live but it's christ that's living in me hey i know it's not me but i know it's him that worketh in me both the will and the dew of his good pleasure it's not me to live it no more i died in christ all that i gained he said i kind of lost amen i i want to lose everything that i might win christ hallelujah that i might be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law amen i don't want my own but amen that i might have the righteousness which is of christ by faith amen i thank the lord amen because his righteousness amen is loving kindness is more than life to me god has given me his righteousness he that knew no sin was made sin for us that we might be made the righteousness of god in him and sister we on a journey amen i love the lord because he heard my cry amen i love him this morning you know so many people down here i can't live without him that is why
