[46:05] in into reality form because all those
[46:08] Sands and all those little quotes is not
[46:11] going to make us or what we uh are
[46:14] supposed to be
[46:15] it is not because we say them we are
[46:18] what we are saying
[46:20] amen but there must be a manifestation
[46:24] amen of the sons of God that is a
[46:27] reality and an in manifested form
[46:31] amen it can't just be words that are
[46:34] quoted it can't be something that we say
[46:37] we believe it must be something amen
[46:39] when he said let there be light and that
[46:42] was like
[46:43] amen so it says
[46:46] it should be a manifestation of the sons
[46:49] of God and he said we're in the bright
[46:52] age but if we are actually amen don't
[46:55] have understanding of of of where we are
[46:59] amen then we are still in that
[47:02] particular layout of Steel spirit amen
[47:05] and we'll still fight against those
[47:07] spirits now you know sometimes you you
[47:11] must stay with scripture amen praise God
[47:14] you stay with scripture and let the
[47:16] scripture amen because heaven and earth
[47:18] will pass away amen but the word of God
[47:21] is going to stand
[47:23] are you up man
[47:24] so you stay with the word amen
[47:27] and you build your faith and your
[47:29] confidence off the word of God
[47:32] amen and the Gates of Hell shall not
[47:34] Prevail against the Revelation amen of
[47:38] the word of God are you with me
[47:40] is to worry
[47:42] don't let nothing else amen move you
[47:45] away from the word
[47:47] so we said war in heaven amen
[47:50] now we know that we're in the end time
[47:53] the end of time or the end time amen the
[47:57] world is coming to his end and we are
[47:59] fighting for survival on every end a
[48:03] brother was telling about the
[48:04] Mississippi River drying up and amen
[48:07] food is about to go Sky High and
[48:10] everything is going uh I mean Haywire
[48:12] all over the world Amen people don't
[48:15] know what to do I know amen if the
[48:19] reality was told amen the world of being
[48:22] a great Panic state if they really knew
[48:25] the condition of the world Amen men
[48:27] would just lose it amen but we don't
[48:31] want to let it go and you know the
[48:34] political world and those that are in
[48:36] charge of the world system they don't
[48:38] want the world Amen the individuals to
[48:41] know what's going on because we are in a
[48:44] hopeless situation the world Amen is
[48:47] about to amen burn as an oven they're
[48:49] doing everything to try to spearhead
[48:52] global warming in this and the
[48:54] earthquake they can't stop the Earth
[48:56] from quaking they can't stop the uh
[48:59] painters from erupting they can't stop
[49:02] the things that are happening Amen in
[49:04] the world Amen they cannot stop it it's
[49:07] on a a a a course amen and it's it they
[49:11] can't turn this thing around
[49:14] so we'll fight in for Survivor
[49:17] amen they're fighting for survival amen
[49:20] it's it's a con it's a constant thing in
[49:25] the world we're fighting for the
[49:26] survival of a Christian's uh are
[49:30] fighting for survival because Christians
[49:32] are amen that are true believers in
[49:36] Christ Jesus are fighting for survival
[49:39] we find that other religions amen look
[49:43] like it's compassion what they call
[49:44] Christianity and the people are so care
[49:47] are so confused you know in the in the
[49:50] black community they're talking about
[49:52] the Hebrews uh you know what's black and
[49:56] and so forth and people will got a a
[50:00] chance to lift their head up and to look
[50:03] up because the Jews were black people or
[50:06] they're saying but uh you know is that
[50:08] reality what does that mean the Jews are
[50:11] black people amen what we're talking
[50:13] about the wall that we're fighting the
[50:15] battle that we're in whether the Jews
[50:18] were black whether they were blue or
[50:20] green you know whatever the reality form
[50:23] is that this battle that we're fighting
[50:26] this wall that we're in amen is a
[50:30] spiritual wall there's wall in heaven
[50:32] and and there's a wall in the earth so
[50:35] we'll find in a spiritual battle
[50:37] amen and and the wall that is going on
[50:40] in the war in heaven is the war in the
[50:44] mind
[50:45] we have Wall in heaven and the wall on
[50:49] the Earth
[50:50] amen the wall is in your mind
[50:54] amen it doesn't matter whether the Jews
[50:57] were uh uh black and the Negro in their
[51:01] plight and what they had to go through
[51:03] amen it model you know look like what
[51:06] the Jews went through but what is it
[51:08] what is that now
[51:10] what is that to us what it's going to do
[51:12] oh but does it give us eternal life
[51:18] do we have eternal life because we know
[51:21] that
[51:22] the thing that gives us eternal life to
[51:24] know that Jesus died on the cross
[51:27] are you with me and know that if we
[51:30] believe in him we should not perish but
[51:32] have everlasting life amen
[51:34] amen isn't that right
[51:36] but if we don't if we put anything above
[51:39] that then uh we're gonna shake his
[51:42] ground
[51:44] amen but when we've taken uh taking
[51:46] emphasis off of Jesus Christ then we're
[51:49] in bad shape
[51:51] amen praise God
[51:53] that's some said Jesus was you know
[51:56] discolored that that don't mean nothing
[51:58] right now
[51:59] let all those folks that fight about
[52:01] that be caught up in that what I want
[52:04] you to know is the character and the
[52:06] life of Jesus Christ amen I want you to
[52:10] know the day is a life that amen has a
[52:13] new birth that is available to you and I
[52:15] and that new birth means everything
[52:19] are you up man amen and God wants to
[52:22] give you amen of his divine nature now
[52:25] as we said there's one Heaven there's a
[52:28] war between the battles of the adamant
[52:31] nature which is the uh came from Adam
[52:34] through sin that was a nature we call
[52:37] the sinful nature amen we call the
[52:41] counter nature amen and there's a wall
[52:43] against the spiritual and the divine
[52:46] nature of God and that battle is taking
[52:49] place in the mind
[52:51] so there's a war going on
[52:54] and we're in a battle
[52:56] so as
[52:58] we're fighting for survival the the the
[53:01] the the truth of the word amen he said
[53:05] when I come shall I find faith on the
[53:07] earth amen what would that means would
[53:10] that be any believers amen and you know
[53:13] the prophet talk about one in a million
[53:16] are you with me so here we are we are
[53:19] we're at the point amen that if he did
[53:22] not shout in the days no flesh would be
[53:25] saved
[53:26] so we're at that at that Crossroad and
[53:29] at that time and at that hour amen that
[53:32] amen everything is going out of course
[53:36] we're fighting for family because amen
[53:39] if family is survived then amen then
[53:44] when men marry men they cannot produce
[53:49] and women admire women that cannot
[53:51] reproduce
[53:52] so we're fighting for the family
[53:55] everything is is at a at a boiling point
[54:00] if we had a place where amen we're
[54:03] threatened
[54:04] for the very existence
[54:08] amen because of
[54:10] the plant and the food and the shortage
[54:13] of every water and everything we're
[54:16] fighting for that and they're trying to
[54:18] survive they're trying to keep where we
[54:20] can have water to drink where we can
[54:22] have food to eat it's a fight for
[54:25] survival
[54:27] so as we come to the end of all these
[54:31] things brother and sister if we look to
[54:34] what the reality of the scientific world
[54:36] and for those that are in the authority
[54:39] will say it's no home
[54:42] but to you and I our hope is in Jesus
[54:46] Christ
[54:47] that he's the keeper of our soul
[54:50] that through it all we can depend on
[54:53] Jesus
[54:54] we can look to him to carry us through
[54:57] these violence in these situations amen
[55:00] God will be with us and he'll never
[55:03] leave us
[55:04] so as we said that we're fighting for
[55:07] survival of the marriage amen because
[55:10] marriage seems to be a thing of the past
[55:13] so amen they can you know you can just
[55:15] shock and just live with anybody you
[55:17] want to live with and amen then what
[55:20] what is going on the institution of
[55:22] marriage is being just messed all up we
[55:26] don't even know what it means anymore we
[55:29] don't know care amen about it no more in
[55:32] that people amen have given up a hope
[55:34] amen of having a decent marriage in life
[55:37] and amen the reign of children and so
[55:40] forth it's almost that we're hopeless
[55:42] we've given up on it the world is saying
[55:45] there's no use amen because amen
[55:49] let's just live together
[55:52] let's just do this let's just do that so
[55:55] what is it if we if we go over the
[55:58] course that we're going in amen then the
[56:02] world is going to be in such a bad shape
[56:05] the Bible says in the days of no every
[56:07] imagination the thought of men Hearts
[56:09] what's continually evil
[56:11] amen have we come to that place where
[56:14] every imagination their thoughts of men
[56:16] Hearts have become continually Eve off
[56:18] amen have we could accepted the evil of
[56:22] this evil age the God of this evil age
[56:26] amen have we accepted the world Amen in
[56:29] this world and listen and we accepted it
[56:32] war in heaven there's war in the church
[56:36] praise God the devil is fighting against
[56:39] Heavenly places
[56:41] amen there's a war going on in Heavenly
[56:43] places the Bible said he's made us to
[56:45] set together in Heavenly places in
[56:47] Christ Jesus as that wall took place in
[56:50] heaven Michael and his angels fought
[56:52] against the dragon and the dragon fought
[56:53] in his angels amen I want you to know
[56:55] amen the wall that's going on within you
[56:58] amen praise God now if God has delivered
[57:02] us from the power of darkness and he's
[57:04] translated us into the kingdom of his
[57:07] dear son then you are actually amen he
[57:10] said the Kingdom of Heaven is not meat
[57:12] and drink but it's righteousness peace
[57:13] and joy in the Holy Ghost
[57:16] are you with me so if amen the heaven in
[57:20] which I'm talking about I'm not talking
[57:22] about going into the seventh Dimension
[57:24] but I'm talking about in this Dimension
[57:26] that you live in right now amen praise
[57:29] God Amen God has placed you amen as
[57:33] children of the light in the kingdom of
[57:35] God
[57:36] are you with me now there'll be one time
[57:38] if they amen will move from the sixth to
[57:41] the seventh Dimension and we'll be in
[57:43] the place called Heaven amen but amen

[58:09] for a thousand years and a thousand
[58:11] years to finish then John said I saw a
[58:13] new Heaven and a new Earth come down
[58:15] from God out of Heaven prepared is a
[58:17] bride and known for her husband
[58:18] are you with me
