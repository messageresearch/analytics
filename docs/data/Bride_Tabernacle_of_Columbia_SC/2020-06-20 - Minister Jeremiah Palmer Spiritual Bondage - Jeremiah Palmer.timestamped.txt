[19:49] Christ amen and amen have your Bibles if
[20:00] you turn with me to the book of Exodus
[20:04] the first chapter
[20:17] and a lot of readings I'm going to try
[20:19] to cut it short by God's grace XS one
[20:27] eight through 14 then return to the book
[20:33] of Galatians five now there rolls up a
[20:39] new king over Egypt which knew not
[20:43] Joseph and he said unto his people
[20:46] behold are people of the children of
[20:49] Israel are more and mightier than we
[20:53] come let us deal wisely with them least
[20:57] they be multiplied and it come to pass
[20:59] that when their forth out any war they
[21:03] join also until our enemies and fight
[21:06] against us and so get them up out of the
[21:10] land therefore they did set over them
[21:15] taskmasters to afflict them with their
[21:19] burdens and they built for pharaoh
[21:22] australia cities Pitman and ramasees but
[21:26] the more they afflicted them the more
[21:28] they multiplied and grew and they were
[21:31] grieved because of the children of
[21:33] Israel and Egyptian made the children
[21:36] either to serve with rigor and he made
[21:40] their lives bitter with hard bondage in
[21:43] mortar and in brick in all men of
[21:46] service in the field all their service
[21:50] wherein they made and serve was with
[21:54] regal lo reactional bless the reading of
[21:56] your word sanctified in Jesus name Amen
[21:59] may be seated a maternity book of
[22:02] Galatians also the fifth chapter
[22:12] Galatians
[22:15] five
[22:25] time to cut a short but he's five and
[22:28] one
[22:32] stand fast therefore in the Liberty
[22:35] wherewith Christ had made us free and be
[22:41] not entangled again with the yoke of
[22:45] bondage tonight I want to speak to you a
[22:50] little thought spiritual bondage
[22:57] spiritual bonds return back to the book
[23:00] of Exodus as I was thinking about
[23:07] bondage and bondage comes in many
[23:13] different forms voluntary and
[23:17] involuntary and we all in some way or
[23:24] another have been in some type of
[23:30] bondage or another I believe the most of
[23:35] all because of the Bible said man born
[23:41] of a woman of a few days and full of
[23:43] trouble we realize that our natural
[23:49] birth brought us into a natural bondage
[23:58] even when I'm thinking about bondage I'm
[24:01] thinking more spiritually but the
[24:04] natural does type the spiritual when we
[24:11] as people are conformed with different
[24:17] habits and different things that in our
[24:25] own very lives things that we know that
[24:32] it's not right but it's seemingly we
[24:37] don't know how to get out of the
[24:41] particular situation
[24:45] but I want you to understand that it is
[24:48] more of a spiritual thing than a natural
[24:51] thing one of the reasons sin had capture
[25:01] of eight the human lives
[25:07] where the first man in the first woman
[25:10] got made they were free they had
[25:16] everything in harmony they could go in
[25:22] and come out even with the animals there
[25:26] were nose killing there was no
[25:28] frustration there was no death or no
[25:30] sickness or anything everything was
[25:33] perfect
[25:36] but because that would happen in a
[25:39] garden it threw everything into bondage
[25:49] the human life the animal life
[25:52] everything B came to be subject to
[25:57] sickness and death disasters failures
[26:05] heart broke
[26:07] heart attacks everything begin to
[26:10] transpire these things fell on us God
[26:17] never meant for his people to be in
[26:21] bondage
[26:24] we often time you know you know talk
[26:28] about slavery but more spiritual and
[26:32] slavery we realize even now today that
[26:39] we have laws that govern certain things
[26:44] but in yet in all the laws that we have
[26:49] except there be in word our experience
[26:55] that calls you to leave
[26:59] beyond your sinful nature lives you
[27:05] remain in bondage and this is you know
[27:11] the system bearing Old Testament with
[27:14] Israel this was a system that had arise
[27:20] in in Egypt which is a type of the world
[27:26] in Israel who were the people of God at
[27:31] that time they found themselves in a
[27:36] place that they were like workhorses and
[27:44] the people of Egypt I'll begin to put
[27:50] more he said heavy burdens I believe
[27:56] there's still a system like that in
[28:01] another form yet it's the same spirit
[28:07] working in another way dance is cunning
[28:11] is it's very subtle but the purpose of
[28:16] it is they keep you in are in bondage we
[28:23] were made God purpose and he he created
[28:27] us for us to worship Him I realize even
[28:38] even in church you can be in bondage
[28:42] some time is the church that put people
[28:45] in bondage people become work hawlings
[28:51] if they they are working for the church
[28:53] or they're working for the preacher or
[28:56] whatever but no no no remember no man
[29:00] owns you
[29:02] God created us in His image so if we
[29:09] were created
[29:10] in that image of God we've got to get
[29:13] back to the image that image of of a son
[29:20] in a daughter of God that you are are
[29:23] free to to live a life that's pleasing
[29:28] under God talking about you know know
[29:38] the laws of the land we need them but no
[29:43] matter how much the laws might change
[29:45] the chain has to happen in us it has to
[29:53] be something that you understand that
[29:58] you are made in God's image and if we
[30:04] were made in that image we have to find
[30:09] a way to get back to where we fall from
[30:14] fail from scuse me we the whole earth
[30:21] was struck with a spiritual amnesia
[30:26] we lost our did it we lost whatever
[30:29] purpose was but in this hour God has
[30:35] made known to us who we really are
[30:40] that's one of the reason why the people
[30:43] are doing what they're doing because
[30:44] they understand understanding who they
[30:48] really are we are supposed to be free we
[30:55] are supposed to be equal in let God
[31:00] equal now but as Israel with Indians our
[31:06] Egyptian system and they had a king who
[31:11] who wanted to rule over them and and he
[31:15] wanted to bring Israel but it must be
[31:19] was something about them that he
[31:23] he won't be afraid of and I believe that
[31:28] even now does the devil know that our
[31:32] he's afraid of you realize who you
[31:36] really are and what your purpose is for
[31:41] being here and lo is he keep us with the
[31:45] fussing and fighting and you're the big
[31:48] one about this you missing the real
[31:51] picture this world he is not I'm a home
[32:01] we came from another world a world
[32:07] beyond what we see here but a spiritual
[32:13] Kingdom but I like it angulations v shop
[32:22] they said how Christ came let's go to
[32:30] that Galatian we i'ma go also back to
[32:34] X's blood school there's a Galatians the
[32:37] fifth chapter you know is sad that we
[32:46] even see spiritually speaking that
[32:53] people as Christians seems to have so
[33:01] much difficulties are getting free from
[33:08] ungodly habits in ungodly ways they go
[33:17] to church and the reason why they go
[33:21] which is a good thing because they
[33:24] believe that there's help that they can
[33:28] get from the church but it's not so much
[33:33] on the church but it got to be gone
[33:36] who you come to look for you've got to
[33:40] understand no man can can give you that
[33:43] kind of freedom it comes from God and
[33:46] God alone but I believe that as as the
[33:53] people go there they have some kind of
[33:57] confidence that what they're going to
[34:00] hear are they they're gonna benefit from
[34:03] it it will help them to get away from
[34:08] the state that they're presently in and
[34:12] come to a reality that they don't have
[34:15] to be in bondage anymore you know real
[34:22] freedom of the price that was paid one
[34:30] of the reasons that Jesus came and to be
[34:37] tempted on earth like as we are is to
[34:45] break all of the are the the bondage in
[34:49] the things that been holding a human
[34:52] race see God and the spirit couldn't go
[34:58] through that but he took all our body
[35:00] called Jesus and got in it to be tempted
[35:04] to be tried to be persecuted to be
[35:08] talked about and ridiculed to be laughed
[35:14] at and spit on to be called a devil yet
[35:21] he became our way out
[35:25] I thought about scapegoat he became our
[35:32] scapegoat he came to take upon him what
[35:40] we were in bondage to and I'm afraid
[35:47] that that
[35:49] that's world is missing the real reality
[35:52] of what he really came to do the policy
[35:58] Lula Sun has set free they are free
[36:02] indeed dumb he did this yet even he went
[36:13] even to the reading of the lost and he
[36:17] script the devil of every power that he
[36:21] had he came to break every deimata yoke
[36:28] that was holding the people hell was his
[36:33] strongest grip and when he script the
[36:37] devil others of his powers he rose again
[36:41] and he cared all power is given unto me
[36:46] he became the mighty conqueror
[36:50] he conquered everything for you and I
[36:56] he conquered sickness he conquered
[37:00] depression he conquered death he
[37:04] conquered every bondage that was a
[37:07] partner he would race he conquered it oh
[37:14] my element I understand a little bit
[37:19] about freedom when you have your evil
[37:25] natural freedom taken away from you they
[37:30] don't make you feel like a human being
[37:34] but it makes you feel like a real slave
[37:40] we don't really cherish you know what
[37:42] we're freedom really is until you lose
[37:46] it and I believe too many times
[37:50] spiritually speaking we have been living
[37:53] below our god-given privileges but God
[38:00] came to restore
[38:03] for us and the only way that he can do
[38:07] it now it has to be according to the way
[38:11] God and PIN for it to happen
[38:14] man can are organized a system and make
[38:18] declaration and make this and that but
[38:21] real freedom come from God it's like
[38:30] having a peace of mind and you know how
[38:35] it is sometime there in your mind you've
[38:39] seen that can't find peace in this life
[38:45] you can't find real freedom comes no
[38:49] matter what you even may achieve
[38:51] naturally it doesn't set you free like
[38:56] you really need to be having a lot of
[38:59] money don't set your free I know in the
[39:03] natural since yesterday
[39:07] but at the end of the day when you have
[39:11] to lay down there and you have to think
[39:15] on your very life you have to wonder
[39:20] what's gonna happen to me if I don't
[39:23] wake up you're very conscious brings you
[39:29] into bondage because they evil that you
[39:33] do in a corrupted things that you do i
[39:36] guilt come upon you you begin to look
[39:40] back in wonder ever anybody gonna ever
[39:43] catch any what you're doing but a
[39:48] balancing whosoever cover their sin
[39:50] shall not prosper everything that's been
[39:55] done in the dark it will come to light
[40:03] let's go back to the Exodus
[40:09] six
[40:14] I'm understanding clearly more and more
[40:20] this system that has been set up and
[40:25] it's still working even down today it's
[40:29] still having the same effect upon the
[40:32] people eyes because truly there are
[40:36] people that really wants to be free they
[40:41] want to be free from their habits they
[40:45] won't to have a peaceful life but
[40:48] they're looking forward in all the wrong
[40:51] places
[40:54] tonight if you're listening I pray that
[40:57] you understand if you ever meet the
[41:02] person of Jesus Christ and invite him
[41:08] into your life and truly repent see God
[41:15] don't hold you callable for your sins he
[41:20] know by nature you've been born into
[41:23] that but the problem is that he made a
[41:29] way of escape
[41:31] that way you don't have to live like
[41:34] that God don't want you to live in
[41:38] shackles and and any bondage you know I
[41:42] I was double now you know it that you
[41:46] can sometimes feel the bondage that
[41:49] people are in and then sometime you hear
[41:53] that cried a because I don't want to be
[41:56] like this I can't help it there was a
[42:02] man in the Bible who who used to cut
[42:04] himself and bail and he was so bad even
[42:09] change couldn't even hold him that's why
[42:14] I will mentor institution I like they
[42:16] are fooling people or mines have left
[42:20] and they seem they don't know what to do
[42:23] and they begin to be schizophrenic and
[42:26] diff
[42:27] things of that nature you know but God
[42:30] wants to bring you to your right mind
[42:35] I'll be out hurtful in seven say one
[42:38] time and I look at the definition but
[42:43] the word bonded it means servitude of
[42:47] subjection to a controlling force or
[42:51] person but he was saying that the devil
[42:55] want to control your mind not only he
[43:00] wants your mind but he want to control
[43:02] your whole body and accept God do
[43:08] something supernaturally in you you will
[43:12] follow him sometimes not even knowing it
[43:18] all cuz sometimes you know how we are we
[43:22] always think we are better than act but
[43:27] I want you to understand that as long as
[43:30] you are in sin and having give your life
[43:34] to God you in a form of slavery because
[43:40] there's a force that's that's telling
[43:43] you what to do you say well no I'll make
[43:47] up my own mind where do you get your
[43:50] mind from see there's something
[43:54] controlling you there's something that
[43:57] telling you you know things that maybe
[44:00] you know we do good things then we do
[44:03] bad things right and we think a lot of
[44:06] times the good things are out wherever
[44:09] bad things but see that's just like it
[44:13] wasn't in the garden God told them
[44:16] specifically do not touch the tree
[44:20] another good and evil or debt the day
[44:22] you die and God put you and I on a free
[44:29] more agent now you can choose it's your
[44:34] choice but remember this this choice you
[44:38] make
[44:39] now to determine away your spin eternity
[44:45] you know but I think God for His grace
[44:48] and mercy because sometimes especially
[44:51] as being in sin we make bad choices we
[44:56] do some time thinking that whether just
[44:58] the way to do it why because it's the
[45:00] system we want to be like everybody else
[45:06] but God did immediate you to be like
[45:09] everybody else God made you to be like
[45:12] him see we've got to wake up out of
[45:17] sleep and come back to reality Who am I
[45:23] what is my purpose what did I came here
[45:29] for just the doing this natural working
[45:33] and eating and sleeping and growing then
[45:36] die it got to be more to life in that it
[45:42] is the Bible saying he came to give us
[45:47] life and give us more abundantly extra
[45:54] six
[46:06] excuse me let's drop that excuse I'm
[46:08] sorry X is the second chapter I got to
[46:12] get this in
[46:15] XS - and 23 connecting from Genesis 1
[46:24] and they said and it came to pass in
[46:28] process of time that the king of Egypt
[46:32] died inaccurate of Israel side by reason
[46:37] of bondage and they cried and they crowd
[46:42] came up unto God by reason of bondage
[46:50] they got so heavy burden one king after
[46:56] the next rise up and he began to put war
[47:00] on a more bondage see the devil never
[47:05] stops you go from one thing to the next
[47:10] hoping that it'll get better after a
[47:13] while but if you understand here what
[47:16] the of Ezra did they begin to cry
[47:19] out to who to the preacher to the church
[47:25] no they cried out to God I believe that
[47:30] is a very good example if you want to be
[47:33] free cry out to God tell God I'm tired
[47:39] because they got tired of it and until
[47:43] you get tired of your condition and your
[47:48] situation and you begin to acknowledge
[47:50] that if anybody can do it I know God can
[47:55] do it somebody saying there anything too
[48:03] hard for the Lord no nothing is too hard
[48:10] for God to do but when you cry out
[48:16] I believe you like that one time said he
[48:19] said it won't rain too hot call for it
[48:23] see God is is waiting and warning us to
[48:29] begin to cry out when we are in bondage
[48:32] Lord set me free break these yolks these
[48:39] heavy burdens that is getting worse and
[48:42] worse and it gets so heavy the way you
[48:45] don't even think you want to live
[48:46] anymore
[48:47] but when you cry out Lord I realized
[48:53] that I made a mistake Lord and I'm sorry
[48:56] but Lord I heard that you can deliver in
[49:05] this church God can do it I believe
[49:08] somebody tonight and you crying out if
[49:12] you were looking for God to do it come
[49:15] on he's here to do it yes not tomorrow
[49:19] right now sometimes we put it off to
[49:24] this input of that know when you want to
[49:27] be free tonight I want to be free now no
[49:33] matter what it is
[49:35] god I know you a table there's never
[49:39] been nothing too hard for you to do you
[49:46] know sometime you're listening to people
[49:52] that talk to you and you hear cry and I
[49:58] know all of us get to a point I know I
[50:00] did that sometimes we go have things
[50:03] that you know allies and and we never
[50:06] getting to say Lord I'm tired of this
[50:09] decision with this condition may be
[50:13] something that aren't that you need God
[50:18] you know to break yokes you need
[50:22] deliverance from the things of the world
[50:28] maybe from your flesh
[50:31] our own flesh puts us in bondage the
[50:36] very thing we take care of everything we
[50:40] grew the very thing we cherish it's your
[50:45] worst enemy you got your own body
[50:52] this thing here see you know it's not
[50:55] what God intended that's why it's out of
[51:00] control that's why the world is out of
[51:04] control
[51:06] whatever seemed right to them they do it
[51:10] why because they're in bondage the
[51:14] masters they kill they kill whatever
[51:18] their master tell them it's a force it's
[51:22] a spirit that's controlling even the
[51:26] whole world it's a system that Satan is
[51:32] ruling how many of you remember the
[51:36] story when Jesus on his fast and Satan
[51:40] took Jesus to the highest temple and
[51:43] begin to tell him he showed him all the
[51:47] kingdoms of the world
[51:50] he began listening the China bribe Jesus
[51:55] say now if you bow down and worship me
[51:59] I'll give you all these wait a minute
[52:03] how can you give something unless you
[52:06] control it and he's shorting all the
[52:12] king of the whole world you know he was
[52:14] saying that this whole world system is
[52:17] under my influence the influence is a
[52:21] powerful thing see the Bible say that
[52:25] he's the prince in parity the powers of
[52:29] the air Satan controls it in this system
[52:33] that the world system that we're in it
[52:37] is really under the influence of Satan
[52:43] in the RET the people don't even
[52:45] understand what they're dealing with
[52:48] they think it's just man and if they
[52:51] could just know it's a higher force than
[52:54] that it's a controlling force he wants
[53:02] to control you what for remember he
[53:08] wanted to be like God so in order be
[53:12] like God then he has to have a gospel he
[53:17] has to have a church he had to have
[53:19] people that you know gonna worship but
[53:24] yet don't know they can actually be
[53:27] worshiping the sainted and not God that
[53:32] was the purpose to be like the Most High
[53:38] remember about us that he calls a third
[53:40] of God angels I wonder what was his
[53:45] sermon he preached in heaven he preached
[53:49] 2/3 of God angel and caused them to
[53:53] believe his right now notice now if he
[53:56] did that in heaven what do you think
[53:59] he's doing on earth we think we are mad
[54:03] should we think we're smarter and
[54:06] because we got scientifically and we
[54:08] haven't got more advancing oh we know a
[54:12] lot of things but you don't know what
[54:14] you're dealing with you have somebody to
[54:19] get over 2,000 years of experience one
[54:23] day I've been in heaven with God now
[54:29] let's go next to this
[54:35] six God never meant for us to be in
[54:43] bondage under nothing even though we do
[54:48] things in our people's lives but God
[54:52] came to set you free
[54:55] yes you can be free from drugs from
[55:01] pornography doesn't matter from sickness
[55:04] yes you can help freedom real freedom
[55:10] but it only comes through accepting
[55:14] Jesus Christ as your personal Savior and
[55:17] give him your whole life coz I want to
[55:24] tell you this if you don't give it to
[55:25] God a devil gonna take it
[55:30] bondage a controlling force X is six
[55:46] and I'm closing
[55:56] five and six remember we've read earlier
[56:00] in Nexus two and 23 how to shoot reveals
[56:04] are beginning to cry out to God because
[56:08] their bonnets had gotten worse I like to
[56:12] tell you something until you understand
[56:16] that you need God more than you need
[56:19] anything
[56:20] he's the only one who can give you real
[56:23] freedom X is 6 5 & 6 you sit down and I
[56:31] have also heard the groaning of the
[56:34] children of Israel whom the Egyptian
[56:37] keep in bondage and I have remembered my
[56:42] covenant where force into the treat of
[56:46] Israel I am the Lord and I will bring
[56:51] you out I like that from under the
[56:56] burdens of the Egyptian and I will read
[57:00] you out of their bondage and I will
[57:05] redeem you with a scratch our arm and
[57:09] with great judgments and I would take
[57:13] you to me for people and I would be to
[57:16] you a God he should know that I am the
[57:19] Lord your God was bringing you out from
[57:23] under the burden of the Egyptian sea
[57:28] because they trusted and cried out to
[57:32] God God remembered his covenant and I
[57:42] want you to know that God have not
[57:45] forgotten about his covenant with you
[57:49] the purpose he gave His only begotten
[57:54] Son is to rid us to rid the sin problem
[58:01] not to all cover it but to take it away
[58:08] in other words to take it from you
[58:14] through the very life that he lived he
[58:21] gave his life for you that you can have
[58:24] his life in other words he took your
[58:29] place that way you don't have to be in
[58:33] bondage anymore why good I did it
