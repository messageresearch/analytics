god of righteousness and holiness father we love you today we ask you o god that you take complete control of the service and that the spirit of the living god would have the preeminence forgive us if we said or done anything that would not please you for father we are trusting in you now that you just send your anointing and anoint your word that it might have power in jesus name amen [Music] the book of genesis 4 praise god genesis 4 and 9. it says and the lord said unto a cain where is abel thy brother and he said i know not am i my brother's keeper and he said what has now done the voice of thy brother blood cries unto me from the ground may god bless you read this word you may be seated this morning we want to share with you the voice of the blood the voice of the blood the blood speaks amen and in hebrews here hebrews 11 hebrews 11 the voice of the blood he said here now faith is the substance of things hoped for it is the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders attain a good report through faith we understand that the words were framed by the word of god so that the things which are seen were not made by the things which do appear by faith ava offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain and by which he attained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his guilt and by it he being dead listen to this he being what but yet i said the blood speaks he said i heard i heard the voice see it's something about the blood that it can speak we know leviticus tell us the life of the flesh is in the blood are you with me so we realize that the body without the spirit is dead amen but we understand that there's a chemistry blood but there was uh a a light that was in that blood and we when we speak of the blood of jesus we're talking about the that god created himself a body when god created that body amen that he was able to get in to that body in the virgin the seed in the egg it was created and that's why amen in action talks about the blood of god so that blood without it you know some folks say the blood of two thousand years ago is not for us today but the blood has never lost its power he said when doctors shed in the blood there is no forgiveness of sin are you with man see i you know i don't understand how folks amen can amen uh account the blood of jesus amen that it does not it's not affected for us today but i believe that the blood still speaks the book of hebrews 12. the blood still speaks it speaks on our behalf amen the bible tells us how he offered himself to god through the eternal spirit praise god see without the spirit the same blood that jesus said that life that was in that blood could come back on the believer are you with me the spirit that was in jesus that same spirit that same god can come back and tabernacle in us that's why we are sons and daughters of god that's our connection amen we cannot be connected with god without the blood how can you be a son or daughter of god if you're not his seed amen because we are his gene seed amen by the word of god we've been born again not of corruptible seed but by the word of god with liberty and abideth forever you're word bone your spirit bone praise god born of the spirit born of the word praise god he said the words that are speaking to you their spirit in their life praise god so god word gives you life what the word of god you have no life without the blood of jesus there's no forgiveness of sin that's why he said repent be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost the holy ghost comes to obedience to the word amen praise god he that believeth on me as the structure has said then out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water man can't give you the holy ghost the church can't give you the holy ghost the bishop can't give you the holy ghost but jesus because of his blood he gives us the holy ghost you know sometimes folks say i got i i have the spirit and sometimes i think it's just a defense sometimes i think they they got to put up a god to convince somebody that i i really got it then sometimes they have to speak in tongues a little bit and jump a little bit and try to prove that you got it praise god but jesus didn't have to prove anything to anybody amen he was the son of god amen praise god and he said if you don't believe that i'm here you're dying in sin are you up man praise god folks are condemned already because they believe not are you with me but if they believe amen they can be saved amen they can be delivered folks amen in this hour the people of mindset look like they're in another world amen just preach the funeral yesterday 18 year old and you can see all the young people he got shot four times and to see all the young people from the high school and every thing there was hundreds there and hundreds online and i said the young people today believe that they are just spiritual they are their own god they are able to speak what they want they don't want to come under suggestion that the bible is the word of god man should not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of god amen see sometimes folk amen will have you to think that their word is more effective than the bible than the word of god but i tell you the word of god it's gone out of his mouth and it shall accomplish that which he sent it to do brother and sister i find no fault in the word what about you pilar said i found no fault in the man but yet he had to crucify him because he had to do what the people wanted the people wanted it so he gave he he wanted to please the people and sometimes we're interested in pleasing people but you got to understand that the blood of jesus speaks for you are you up there amen now every devil in hell can come against you amen but jesus through the blood that he shined through the crowds the bible said he's trampling over them in it praise god he rose dropping victoriously over that hell in the grave pray amen when he said it was finished that means your sins and mine you know there's something wrong somewhere when a person can be forgiven and can be set free and can have eternal life and they turn it down something wrong somewhere but yet if you offer them a million dollars they'll run and jump in and get it and be happy as can be but you give them eternal life and they they don't want it the devil offered them a quick fix of something out there in the world and they they're running for it they're enjoying that amen and they won't give jesus left everything to come down and shed his blood he left heaven to come down and take on sinful flesh in the likeness of sinful flesh come down to die on the cross and be spit on and to be rejected despised and rejected of men a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief he came down to do all of that for us and we sat around and though god had done anything and you know i it's something wrong with the love that the people have for god i believe that they don't really love him even christian folk unsaved folk they don't love god like the altar you know i i find out you can preach on folk how to dress and how to do this and stop doing this and stop doing that but if you're all if they only love god you wouldn't have no problem you have no problem when they really love god but the the problem is that folk have not they men caught a revelation they don't really love god they don't realize how what god has done for them hey god because they don't realize i said you know sometimes you're trying to get people to stop doing this and live this live for god and all of that and you're wasting your time if they don't love god you know it's something that a man gonna be faithful to his wife he don't love her it's something that that a father gon amen uh work hard and try to uh provide for the children if you don't love them you know i i i i it it's difficult for people to come to church if they don't love god they struggle oh it's so hard to do he said my yoke is easy my burden is life amen it should not be a difficult thing for somebody that's in love amen to give to life i just don't want us to just say well i'm willing to die i want you to do something amen to show that you love god amen praise god hey what is it amen people look like it's man preachers preaching and folk can yell amen if if you make them yell if you insist that you say amen god give me a hand clap god somebody say amen oh lord they gonna do it man let's play play church people all want to praise god people ought to come with their mind on lord you've been so good to me lord i love you so much i i was glad when they said unto me come into the house of the lord lord i'm glad to be in the number one more time but that might be old time in church brother friend amen but i thought i'll tell you jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever amen this is the same god amen so amen i believe sons and daughters ought to be the same praise god if they worship god in the book of acts like their worship then they ought to be the same book of acts the same power the same anointing amen the same blind eyes open the same death is unstoppable same god that raised the dead praise god that ought to be the same god and the believer these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they should cast out devil not talk about it but manifested praise god not talking about what god can do amen praise god let me show you that our god is a god amen that has power in deliverance praise god do you want to be delivered then god still delivers praise god we're not talking about something that i think and imagine praise god you got to know your god praise god and you know him it makes a difference you talk to talk but you got to walk the walk [Music] come on somebody talk about it but you can't live nothing praise god we want a people that you know i can see the devil holding people down because he got them all bound up because they can't live nothing so they can't praise god but you see some of the biggest hypocrites are the ones that shot all over the place so you can't always go by that but because the hypocrites shout you're going to set back and say well that's a hypocrite or john i ain't going to praise god amen you let the hypocrite out do you are you with me you are not let a devil out praise you amen praise god the world out there amen praise god they worship they know not what but we know what we who we worship amen he said to the woman the hour will come in nine years that the true worshippers are gonna washing me in spirit and truth lord have mercy praise god what you're afraid of praise god folks seem to be afraid to let god have his way praise god you know everybody says i have the spirit i got the holy ghost and when it comes down to the word they say well let me check with my church let me check with my bishop let me check with my pastor if you got the word are you with me and the word is in you amen you ought to be able to stand on what you believe are you with me you ought to stand up for jesus amen not be ashamed amen praise god i got the the blood speaks brother sister the blood speaks i tell you god's not dead isn't it if you got blood and running warm in your veins god not dead so you ought not to be around uh having trouble praising god are you with me you know i looked at the book i was looking through the book of songs again i said uh uh the old testament church and looking at them you know what they did they stood without preaching in africa just about to they walk miles and miles to church you know what they do when they get there my wife will tell you they stand up they stand up and they still praising god the word come forth they're singing praising god are you with me and you we ride in an air conditioned come sit down in our condition and still can't praise god oh you what man those folk go through some stuff and they still praise him are you what man and i said what's the matter is that is this a god of africa and it's not a god of america is the same god here is that are we serving the same god and if we are we ought to be able i'm telling you god is not pleased sometimes with how we treat him see i i believe our our focus is on other things that the devil have us focus on oh somebody said this and somebody did that and preaching i don't know about what he was what he's speaking to me about that you know we're trying to figure out reason with the word and all that we ought to just come and with our hearts praying that god would give us something that would help us through our journey in our life praise god you've been battling and struggling and going through different difficulties and you come to church you want a word from the lord and you don't want to just listen you want that word to become a part of you amen that word have i hid in my heart that i might not send it you want that word to go down inside of you and you want that word to live in you amen you want that word to take on amen life you want the word to live praise god when the word can live you can you're going to see mountains move you're gonna see things happen praise god you're gonna see demons cast out you know that devil can't stay in you if you believe the word amen that devil can't hold you in sin if you believe that jesus already paid the price when he shattered the blood and he said it's finished praise god how can the devil hold you in sin when you know that your sins are forgiven praise god the price has already been paid why should i sit here until i die praise god but i can rise up oh god and go to the enemy camp praise god amen god is good uh hebrews 12 21 it says and so terrible was the sight that moses said i exceedingly fear and quake but ye are come unto what see we can read the bible until we believe the bible then we just we just come i made it again it was a struggle and it was difficult and i had a battle to get here today but i made it amen but it was something about coming together and knowing why you're coming together knowing why you're in the church knowing why amen what you come for you're coming to expectation that i received something from the lord amen and when you get here it's you know you you know amen god you got a word for me he says but you'll come to mount zion and until the city of the living god until the heavenly jerusalem and to the innumerable company of angels if we only knew if we can look into the unseen and look into that other dimension and see that the angels of god are here as elijah said to i don't don't mind the syrian army don't mind what's around you amen no matter all the devils and all that that that amen all that stuff that comes to your mind and all that stuff you've been through this week amen don't never mind that look into the unseen rim and see an innumerable company of angels amen all your problems and all that you've been through and all that you're going through don't look at that look until the unseen look into the word that they that's with us are more than them that is against us amen you come to amen an innumerable a company of angels amen praise god when you're looking at that amen it takes a revelation it takes faith to look into the unseen amen what faith is all about faith is something that things hope for and it's the evidence of things what not seeing you don't have to see it to believe it why because you believe it and you see it are you with me praise god that's what it's all about brother you're coming to an enumerable company of angels but if you don't believe the angels of god i hear you would conduct yourself as that servant you'll be a fearful you what what are your feet known you're feeding on your fear amen and and you won't be able to defeat the devil until you amen look beyond praise god your fears and looking to the unseen and see amen that he's a present help in the time of trouble are you with me that god is here it said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you but i'll be with you always knowing that you have a god that's god praise god hallelujah he's with us if god be with us then what who can be what what are you worried about who can lay anything to charge of god's election amen amen if god is here oh lord i'm running for my life amen amen it says here and the 23rd verse it says until the general assembly and the what church of the what praise god isn't that good the church of the first born amen which are written in heaven don't you know your name was written on the lamb book of life before when before the foundation of the world if god wrote your name on the lamb book of life before the foundation of the world that means he foreknew you and god saw you amen why because the lamb was slain in the mind of god before the foundation of the world isn't that right so he's showing you that there was a bloody lamb in the mind of god so jesus had come and john said behold the lamb of god that take away what amen so if that happened then there was a reason why the lamb was slain he was slain for you are you what man and god can he can put your name there amen on that lamb book of life because he foreknew you he knew that one day you would believe that god so you would believe that he bled and died for you and believing you will receive eternal life only because you had it in the mind of god before the foundation of the world that's the reason why you could believe because god saw you coming [Music] he saw you coming before you ever got here amen he saw you there and he said i could write down brother fred and sister patricia i saw you there i can put your name there praise god i don't make no mistakes he know the end from the beginning are you up man oh hallelujah through all your struggles through all your difficult times do all you're going through god sees and he knows your struggles amen and he's a present help all you got to do is realize amen god you say you'll be with me always and because you're with me why should i fear why should i you know why should we you know it's difficult sometimes when we're going through tough times to really release and give it to god so god you you can carry my burdens sometimes you get a little difficult a little hard to bear i looked at that family that mother that lost son murdered and so forth and i looked at the young people and my heart just old yarn always hundreds and hundreds of young people i say god see they and you know that they they're so out there and somebody said i think my wife or somebody's my sister-in-law those these young people don't have nobody nobody to guard them show them away for most of them mothers were teenagers when they had these children and i think brother gardner somebody said 60 percent of the black children are born out of weight loss back then statistically so what is what is going on when you're speaking you know they're killing one another they're selling drugs to one another are you with me what makes it what makes you not a victim as a young person this morning somebody loves you enough to tell you the truth love you enough to say don't go that way don't go down that road but what what is it but 90 of the youth are going down that road maybe 95 what's going to keep you what's going to hold you only the mercy of god in the love of god if you only receive it if you only recognize that he loves me amen god loves me i i got friends and i and they'll pull it on me but oh lord what the blood of jesus i'll tell you the truth i don't care who don't believe that that he shed his blood for them but i'm so glad he shed it for me because i know where i was and i know where i could have been and i would have been if jesus didn't save me but i'm so glad he did praise god you know i i you know it's been 40 something years you know i i never wanted to go back you know a young young boy i never wanted to go back now i'm an old man but i never wanted to go back i don't know what's going on with people well it's so hard it went hard it was not hard i would tell you yeah we could go through some difficult times and battles and all that but it wasn't hard like the bible said the wages of sin i mean the way of a transgression is what hard you know and sin if man when the devil gets to beating you i said we gonna have some testimonies in here because the devil doesn't whip up on some people you think you big and you bad and you know what you want and you know what you can do the devil said yeah tell him he'll push you up that you big and bad and tough and you ain't gonna do this and you ain't gonna do that tell them you ain't gonna never do it yet without god the devil make you do it are you with me you got you no match for the devil he'll make you do what you said you'll never do but i'm so glad that god's mercy and the love of god he came and got me as a young man he came and got me i was telling you know as a young man he came and had mercy on my life you know i love him because of what he's done for me and as a young man in the early 20s i'm dealing with demons and devils and witchcraft and all kind of spirits and all kind of power but i said oh lord look what i'm dealing with i got to cast out devils i got to see people like snakes and like dogs and rallying and women growling like men and all i said oh i'm in another world is this real it's real if the devil can get a hold of you he'll possess you and he'll take you so far to you you'll be out of this world you'll be in another world i tell you that devil can take you farther than where you want to go are you with me so you when you have a chance to accept jesus christ and to live for god you need to do that you need it with all your mighty lord maybe i i under appreciate it i undervalue your love and i under appreciated what your blood means to me but yet your blood speaks the voice of the blood the life that was in the blood yet you wanted to give your life that i can have life amen that i can live brother how precious sister how precious is that somebody to care more about you than you kept then you could ever care about yourself enough to share eternity with you said i share eternity with you i want you to be my bride i want you to be amen i want you to be the lamb's wife amen are you with me so he extends his grace towards us it says here it says and god written in heaven and god the judge of all and to the spirit of just men made what just being made perfect and to jesus to what the mediator of the what the new covenant and the blood of what that speaketh what the blood speaks better things than i want revenge i eye for an eye and two foot two because if jesus would have his blood would have spoke like that he said i hear the voice of your brother blood speaking those are done under the altar they cried out how long they cried out will you avenge us see what i'm saying but the blood of jesus didn't speak concerning vengeance are you with me but he spoke concerning forgiveness amen i forgive you that's what the blood of jesus does it forgives and if that life that was in that blood comes down in you then you would have that same one same spirit that you're able to forgive are you with me but if you don't have that spirit you can't forgive people you know some of the things i've been through as a christian and people say why didn't you retaliate because the blood wouldn't let me amen and because it wasn't in me to do it i could not retaliate when you know somebody's lying on you and you know somebody's doing you wrong but yet you can take it why because of the blood are you with me you know most folk can't take it because the blood has not been applied if the blood has not been applied then you're gonna go somebody do you wrong oh not me i'll fight oh lord but when the blood speaks if you have the holy ghost and you have the the life of jesus inside of you if you've been forgiven then you know how to forgive are you with me forgiveness make a difference you forgive them because what they know not amen brother if
