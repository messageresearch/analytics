your spirit have preeminence lord we pray god that you will keep our pastor lord strengthen him lord we pray for the power god of your word oh god give him god the things that he need lord lord bless all the pastors lord bless all the ministers of the gospel of the earnest mother called by the nathan lord we pray god lord for your people everywhere that are sick continue to touch oh god the bodies of their sister mary brother frank lord god we pray for your mercy and your grace pray god for the power of the holy ghost god strengthen each and every one of us lord look upon god the country and our leaders and the pandemic god and the things that are going on lord we pray for your mercy and for your grace tonight lord we ask you god to direct us lead us in the name of jesus christ amen amen have your bibles tonight to your turn with us to the book of james [Music] first james one i mean you're glad to be in the house of the lord tonight amen start at the second verse down to the 12th my brethren counting all joy when you fall into a diver's temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith work is patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect an entire warning nothing if any of you like wisdom let him ask of god that give it to all men liberally in up braideth not and it shall be given but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the lord a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways let the brother low degree rejoice in that he is exalted but the rich in that he is made low because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away for the son is no sooner risen with their burning heat but it withered the grass and the flower thereof fallen in the grace of the fashion of it perished so also shall the rich man fade away in his way blessed is the man that endureth temptation but when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord had promised through them that love him let us pray father we thank you for your word tonight lord that we pray oh god for your spirit god sanctify it in jesus name amen may be seated i want us just for a few minutes tonight speak on this i remember sharing something like it but not in this aspect but and i entitled it enduring time our time of enduring we'll realize that now especially you know i'm understanding something that for every season god has a word and that word that god sends is to give the people uh another hope that what they are going through we realize that we are living in one of the most treacherous times ever somebody sing a song there never was a day like this day and it's a true song servant of god said one place that this last day of bride will take the worst beating of any why because she has so many things to contend with life in general who would ever thought who would ever imagine that what we are dealing with in this hour we would be here to go through this we had no idea what was going to take place but god did and i believe god always has something to come back the spirit that we are dealing with in his hour god never left himself without a witness he never leaves the people without some kind of hope i heard the servant of god say one time that there is nothing out of order everything is just the way god intended for it to be i know it seems difficult i i know it her i feel your infirmity i know what i'm dealing with and all of us there's no nobody at exempt has something that we're dealing with but what makes the problem is that we don't know how to handle it yes it catches us unaware it catches us by surprise sometimes it's very difficult it's very hard we wonder how are we going to make it but i want to tell you god has already made it for you the word endure as i looked at it and i said what a time it means to remain firm under suffering or misfortune to continue in the same state holding out in the face of opposition oh my holding out that's where it's at many are called by the field chosen the bible says one place that there's gonna be a great falling away you see the love of many gonna wax coal because the nicotine shall abound he said men's heart failing them for what they are seeing for what's going on on the earth the whole world is just shook up they wondering what can they do to make it better what can i do to overcome what i'm dealing with trust in the lord many have gotten to a place that they feel they'd rather just die that seemed to be the easy way out but that's just the beginning of a minute but to remain firm in other words ah the song said do our hell assail me i shall not be moved though the tempt is raging though everything around me seem to be going wow i shall not be moved what's holding you what's keeping you from not giving up someone say it's going to take a strong win in this it's gonna take more than just talking about how good god is and what god has done in time past i'm talking about a god right now [Music] so many people a song came to my mind so many people talk about me but i i'm holding on what are you holding on to you got to have an anchor in this hour you got to have something that even when you want to let go it'll hold you because in this flesh it gets weak it gets weary it gets sick and get tired but oh i'm so glad that the bible said that when the enemy comes in like a flood that the spirit of the lord will raise oh my we're gonna find out that nobody young or old you can't keep yourself that's why he sent the holy ghost to be a keeper he knew what we're going to have to be dealing with in this hour and god wanted to give us something that we can depend on sometimes we depend on our own physical script our knowledge and our ability but you'll find out it won't even stand i want to read something to you this is just a footnote [Music] i like the definition because it means remaining firm i saw something the other day and i thought about you know we have this thing uh nothing but they have this little singing you know to say what he's saying and i saw something and i said i wonder whether they saw this because he did say this but he said no matter who you are you are not exempt from being sick he said i am not even exempt no matter who what your title is you are not exempt from trouble he said even if you do get sick then god is a healer he said we are subject we're not immune from these things we're not exempt from what's going on but we are writing this thing together we realize and we understand that if god don't keep us lord i hope we can say thank you i got nothing to boss i'm not strong i'm not good no matter what your title is it's because of the grace of god if god moved his grace off you who be able to stand if god take the mercy but god knows how to do things i i i'm looking at this here so real because this is reality [Music] sometimes people under don't understand why why am i going through and why i'm dealing with this you got to go through it god have to allow he he does it why because god wants to prove you god wants to sometimes he know that something he want to build character he want to tell all of your self our righteous and yourself are script that you boasted about and show you that listen it's all about me it's not about how much you know about the message it's not about what you can quote but do you know him in other words do you really have a personal life experience with the god you serve and see you're going to need that you might hear mama you might hear the preacher you might hear brother branham but do you know him for yourself have you met god do you know him not about him see a lot of us know about him one of the great things around us we know a lot about the message but we forgot the author of the message which is jesus christ you know the man that he used but you don't know the man that god had used them with to remain firm in the face let me say it like this of your opposition every one of us are going to have an opposition every one of us are gonna see rather not you know faith on the mountain is good but how about when you get in the valley how about in a time when things get low and you can't see your way out you don't know how to get out can you still say god is good well yeah he good everything going good but if he's still good when things go wrong i want to tell you tonight he is still good when you're broke when you're sick when you're frustrated whatever it is god is still good he's not limited by your opposition i like that somebody said don't wait till the battle is over shout now huh how about let's shout in the midst of the storm see everybody can praise god when things go well oh my everybody can sing thunders everybody can praise god and everything but when things are going wrong can you still say hallelujah anyhow oh yes i'm learning something about to say you got to learn to encourage your own self don't wait for nobody else to encourage you you got to sing a song you got to find a praise you got to find something to be able to lift god up because god wants you to know that i am still good in the valley as i is on the mountain though you are going through trouble though you are going through a trial but god is still good let me read that little little footnote i thought it was good and i hope it he said trials i have a demeans through which god's blessing can come wow blessings and trials but we don't want to go through nothing we don't want to suffer we don't want nothing to happen to upset our plans but god allow it to go wrong see in the trial of what you're dealing with there's a blessing in it but when we lose that we start complaining and god hates that spirit did not the bible say in all things cry pout he said all things give what thanks [Music] give thanks in whatsoever is going on in your life why because god is working out something many people right here they they always asking for you know spiritual growth and in order to move on with god but when god begin to uh try him see before he can give you more you got to be proven that you can handle the next step or whatever it is that god has for you people say promotion comes from the lord and before god promotes you he let you go through something because our power without character and satanic we have to know how to conduct ourselves even in the midst of the fire enduring time abraham endured 25 years you could imagine what he had to deal with in his generation then even after god gave him the promise then god told him to go and take it up and sacrifice it my let me tell you something those old patriarchs what they had to deal with under the covenant of the law under a sacrifice of of animals they they held on they never really saw what we see yet their faith was able to take them through and they remain firm bible say abraham staggered not in other words abraham didn't let the opposition discourage him he didn't let his age he didn't let sarah age he didn't let what the people were saying discourage him abraham let not even serve his own wife but abraham believed in hope where there wasn't no hope see church you got to believe in hope where there isn't no hope it doesn't matter what they say it doesn't matter how it looks i'm gonna hold on to god in changing hands you know uh off the tower across that quote the servant of god said you know it's usually in the darkest hours when the supernatural takes place and i said lord wouldn't it be a good time for the supernatural breakout how wouldn't it be in darkness in in the most corruptible the most with everybody all you hate is negative negative negative name no matter where you go it's a negative negative we can't afford to get into the spirit of it we got to understand that the earth is the lord's see all belongs to him and he is the controller chief and the chief can let things happen without your permission he don't need the president he don't need the doctors no he is the commander in chief what do we do we said thank you lord i knew that song crazy i could tell you something some experiences god is always on time we always in a hurry but god is always on time brother god i'll let you get low and then god will bring you back up whatever god allows whatever god permits thank you lord i know that you know what you're doing and god is in or control reading it trials are however the means to which god's blessings can come one's endurance in in and victory over trials brings god's blessing christian therefore are not instructed to seek avenues of escape in other words don't look for your way out take guard avenue and god will work everything out don't try to run from your trials no don't stay in the house and say i no no no it's god doing something god has a blessing with your name on it sister patricia say how does it come through trials if you suffer with me you'll reign with me no suffering no reigning yes i know the devil is busy but i want to tell you god is busy too i say god is busy too god god is on the move church i know we we we don't see it uh in big conglomeration but god is still on the move he's still a miracle-working god he's a god that still provides okay christians therefore are not too instructed to seek avenues of escape god desires that they mature in this situation in other words grow up don't run from it god is wanna want you to spiritual mature he wants you to be overcomers or whatever you deal with fussing is not the answer you've got to learn how to let things go stop trying to handle god business we've got to grow up we can't remain babies all the time god is looking for a church that has spiritually grown and they know how to handle themselves how do you handle it by the word see god left specific instructions and these are some of the things that we are growing into i was doing a little a series like on the statue of a perfect man and that statue is to bring us all to the unity of other words mature a mature church a church that's not uh always disturbed and fussing and stewing about this and about that a church that is able to take something sometimes you take the wrong when you're right and that hurts because this flesh don't want to take nothing no i'm not going to take that but then look at jesus who is your example he took our penalty he took the slap he took the b he took them scripting him a man that did nothing someone said he could have called 10 legion of angels to come to his rescue his rescue but he didn't say a mumbling word why who did he do it for what was the purpose it wasn't for his good it was for our good to let us know you may be spit on and talked about and beat on like even stephanie when he was being stoned to death you know stephanie said lord forgive him in the midst of being stoned he was still willing to say lord forgive them how about us tonight how about us when we do wrong or when we be wrong somebody can we still say lord forgive them can we still love them the same way before that happen you know how we get you know we get this self thing about us that we don't want to deal with people anymore but i started to tell you you're going to have to deal with somebody how are you going to spend eternity with people forever and we can't get along here it's shown that we must grow up we must learn that we all are different but guess what we got the same god we say we're serving and if you serving the same god and if you got the same spirit oh that's the problem do we really have that same spirit of christ that you can love in spite of no early funny feelings running down your back uh no funny feelings about this no no no no but love our servant of god says something he said you know he said uh you ought to be able to bitterly disagree with a person yet you can feel the same way about them before you had a disagreement that's going up will you let them take advantage of you why because the battle ain't yours god said i your battle he said if you hold your peace and let the lord fight your battle because the battle isn't yours i'm telling people i said you know when you going through things and uh around you and with people and dealing with issues you got to understand it's a bigger picture it's not about you see you got that's why you got to be in control of what you were dealing with you got wait a minute here is the devil and he's a good adversary he he does his job well but we have got to grow i'm going to close on this servant of god was talking about job you see the oldest book in the bible the patriarch job noted for his patience his endurance he that endures to the end shall be saved it's not how fast you run it's not how long you've been in the message but can you endure can you remain firm can you remain uh as you when you first got saved do you still have that joy i'm not just talking about sometimes when a revival comes i'm talking about joy down in your soul job noted for his endurance holding out in the face of opposition his neighbors coming around saying see you got some sickness some secret sinning joe said no i haven't i've confessed all my sins and made i've been offering i haven't sinned secretly oh yes you have you sin secretly but god was dealing with the saint there he said every son and daughter that coming to god must first be child raised spank the little let things go contrary you never have it all that cannot bear those things are illegitimate children and not the children of god if a man ever saw him in his heart knowing jesus raised for his justification except the same on the basis of the blood in the word put trials upon him nothing can separate you us from the love of god saying even on sunday i said you know if god before us then tell who can be against us if god is for us tonight tell me who can separate you from the love of god church tonight as we close we understand that we all have something to deal with we understand that we are our worst enemy we got i know we always blamed it on this and all that and all this and on that but you are your worst the enemy we've got to grow up and understand whatever god has for you is for you and god got a way to get you to it but you got to let god work it out stop fighting for yourself understand what the will of the lord is you're going to have trials but it's not the end of the world like i say weeping me endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning when is the morning then brother jeremiah when you can look up and understand where your help come from when is the morning when you can understand that lord whatever state i find myself i'm gonna be content we always want god to take us out of the fire but god will give you grace to go through it you take us out of everything we're going through you haven't learned a lesson here but we just stay there for a while it tears your character down it breaks things pride and it tears the flesh down god knows how to work it that's why nobody's going to be able to boast we are going to understand that that song said if it wasn't for the mercy of the good lord where would i be tonight saint we got the press god bless you [Applause] praise god amen god is good amen the bible said count it all joy when we fall into the diver's temptation amen so by the grace of god amen the same that it does to the end the same shall be saved we got to keep pressing the battle amen i thank god for amen when we heard tonight you got to endure hardness as a good soldier amen we're in a battle we're in a war and we got an endure hardness amen as a good soldier of the cross praise god you go through amen in this life amen so in this life we're going to go through trials and tribulation but he said be of good cheer because i've overcome the world so by the grace of god we thank god for everyone we thank god for pastor wolf being with us tonight amen appreciate a friend or brother amen we're glad to see him tonight he said i'll be dropping in sometime sometimes go ahead and say a word or two while you're there i know you just come in just to drop in just greet us uh and all three children succeed in life but who leads them but being lowered up and what the ones who said is their friend you only have one friend that's the lord jesus christ you're gonna have another friend you may have some association you don't have a friend unless i just thank you all for being here brother children we just foreign [Applause] i was in
