[40:16] believe I believe it you know the
[40:18] prophet said don't stand behind this
[40:20] desk unless you have a back side of the

[40:54] kidding but we're thankful to be here
[40:57] amen amen you know I I believe that this
[41:00] is the portion where the greatest
[41:02] drawing power the prophet said the
[41:04] greatest drawing power is the gospel not
[41:07] just the gospel of a man or Gospel of
[41:10] some great Doctrine or idea but it's the
[41:12] Gospel of Jesus Christ amen amen it's
[41:16] the only name under Heaven that all men
[41:18] must be saved amen amen it's the name of
[41:21] Jesus amen amen now if you would get

[43:57] thank
[43:58] you we ask all these things in your
[44:01] name
[44:05] amen 1 Chronicles the 15th chapter Thank
[44:10] You For The
[44:11] Music 15th chapter in the first
[44:15] verse when you're there say
[44:21] Amen the Bible says and David made him
[44:26] houses in the city of
[44:29] David and prepared a
[44:31] place for the Ark of
[44:35] God and pitched for
[44:38] it a
[44:41] tent let's look at that one more time
[44:44] and David made him
[44:47] houses in the city of David and
[44:51] prepared a
[44:53] place this morning I'd like to focus on
[44:56] that prepared a
[45:01] place I'd like to give you a title this
[45:03] morning on a prepared place for a
[45:07] prepared
[45:09] people a prepared place for prepared
[45:14] people you may be seated in the presence
[45:16] of the
[45:20] Lord now we see here in this
[45:23] scripture where
[45:25] David made the house
[45:28] in this city and he prepared a
[45:33] place now we're reminded that every day
[45:37] we have to make a place we always make a
[45:41] place everything that we do we make a
[45:44] place in our
[45:45] schedule we make a place at our
[45:48] job we make a place in everything that
[45:51] we do and David he made this place not
[45:54] just for some thought
[45:58] or some
[46:00] belief but he made it for an
[46:02] ark and this was the ark of God he made
[46:06] it he made a place for the God that he
[46:09] served he made a place that God can come
[46:12] and meet him he made a place but notice
[46:14] within this tent there was three
[46:18] places there was an outer Court an inner
[46:21] court and the Sha shakina
[46:24] Glory there was these places now the
[46:27] shika Glory was within the inner Court
[46:32] it was deeper it was a deeper level this
[46:36] is where that Ark was
[46:37] found no other person can enter this
[46:40] place except for a selected
[46:43] person the
[46:46] Levites there is only a certain people
[46:49] that can enter this place David would
[46:52] set it before us as he built the tent
[46:56] then David said said none ought to carry
[46:58] the Ark of God but the
[47:02] Levites and for them hath the Lord
[47:05] chosen to carry the Ark of God so it
[47:08] wasn't even David's choosing it wasn't
[47:10] even David's what he thought would be
[47:13] right it was what God wanted so God
[47:17] desired a place and a people that would
[47:21] make a place for
[47:22] him he desired a certain people to put
[47:27] their thoughts and their Ambitions and
[47:28] their ideas
[47:30] away to make a place they made a place
[47:35] where God can be able to meet
[47:39] them and God would meet these Levites in
[47:42] other words the preacher he met the
[47:45] preacher in this holy of holy he met him
[47:48] in there so that preacher can get in
[47:51] tune and get the shikina glory presence
[47:55] on him to be able to give the
[47:57] word he went into this place where God
[48:01] can be able to meet them and they
[48:04] prepared this place so now we know that
[48:07] we prepare this place and it's every day
[48:09] it's not just right now on a Sunday it's
[48:11] a place that we go to we go to this
[48:14] place now we don't need to come here and
[48:18] maybe walk and just you know say well
[48:20] this is our where we find you know peace
[48:24] no you can find peace at your house amen
[48:26] you could find peace on the job you
[48:29] could find peace you know I I get where
[48:31] the scripture says forsake not the
[48:32] assembling of the Saints even more so as
[48:35] the day approaches
[48:37] but this doesn't have to be the only
[48:40] place this doesn't have to be the only
[48:43] place where this is your only safety
[48:46] place no your safety place can be at
[48:48] your
[48:49] house it's wherever you're willing to
[48:51] make that place but the most you know
[48:55] that place isn't a building it's
[48:58] yourself it's you making yourself
[49:00] available now we know that the altar is
[49:03] your
[49:05] heart you are made up of an outer being
[49:09] an inner being and then a
[49:12] soul your heart is your shika
[49:16] glory and your heart is where God can
[49:19] meet you but in order for it to happen
[49:22] you have to be able to open yourself up
[49:24] you have to move some of yourself out
[49:26] you have to move some of yourself out so
[49:29] you can be able to be fed so you can be
[49:32] able to be met and God longs to meet his
[49:36] people God longs to meet his people do
[49:40] you believe
[49:43] that and there was a certain people and
[49:45] these were the Levites that were the
[49:47] only ones that were able to enter that
[49:49] tent but this presence this tent you're
[49:53] able to meet amen you're able to make
[49:55] this place you're able to go into this
[49:58] place you're able to get into this
[49:59] presence get shut in with God you are
[50:03] able to today it doesn't have to be
[50:05] tomorrow it doesn't have to be next week
[50:07] but it could be right now at this moment
[50:11] it could be right now it doesn't have to
[50:14] wait amen cuz God is not a god of he he
[50:18] is a god of tomorrow he's a god of
[50:20] yesterday he's a god of today but he
[50:21] doesn't he doesn't long for you to wait
[50:24] he can meet you right now if you don't
[50:26] allow
[50:28] him he can meet you at any circumstance
[50:31] at any time now I'd like to give you the
[50:33] definition of what prepared would
[50:36] mean prepared would mean made ready for
[50:42] use ready to do or deal with
[50:48] something ready to do or deal with
[50:55] something many times times we make a
[50:58] place in our agenda so we can deal with
[51:01] something a problem at the house let's
[51:05] all gather as a family we got to get
[51:08] this thing set in order we got to do
[51:10] this now am sometimes it can't wait
[51:14] sometimes it has to happen right
[51:16] now sometimes God might tell you
[51:18] something and you got to do it right
[51:19] then just the other day the Lord laid on
[51:21] my heart to go pray for
[51:23] someone I didn't I knew they were at
[51:26] with cancer they just got this doctor's
[51:28] report but no one else
[51:31] knew the Lord told me go I didn't
[51:36] listen I went to church put a prayer
[51:40] request in that burden never never left
[51:44] me well what am I supposed to do I went
[51:48] I drove two hours up the road to go pray
[51:51] for
[51:53] some their testimony after it was the
[51:57] Lord done something in my
[52:00] body obedience to the
[52:04] Lord it will bring a
[52:08] blessing obedience to the Lord will
[52:10] bring a blessing amen when you obey the
[52:14] Lord when he tells you to do something
[52:16] he can move amen if you'll
[52:19] listen but so many times we let our
[52:22] stubborn nature and all of our
[52:25] ideas get in our
[52:27] way so many times we let our work
[52:30] schedules get in our
[52:31] way you know there's a time of
[52:35] preparation you know as I was sitting
[52:36] there brother Henry had we were on the
[52:38] phone and he said
[52:41] uh brother would you uh would you be
[52:44] able to come on Sunday and I said well
[52:47] uh well we just had a baby
[52:49] and maybe you
[52:52] know I said uh I'll be there
[52:58] I left my family just to come over here
[53:01] because the Lord laid this on my heart
[53:03] now during this pregnancy I found out
[53:06] what preparation would
[53:08] be but I still wasn't
[53:13] prepared preparation you know there was
[53:16] times and months where we were getting
[53:18] ready we were getting ready for a little
[53:21] promise we were getting ready for
[53:23] something and now this preparation we
[53:26] had to go buy diapers we had to go buy
[53:28] Wet Wipes we had to go buy all these
[53:30] different things get the house prepared
[53:32] we had to buy the the the groceries and
[53:35] get the uh fridge stocked up and we had
[53:38] to go and get the baby bed and all you
[53:41] know all these different things and
[53:42] we're getting the room prepared we're
[53:45] getting the place prepared am we're
[53:48] getting it all ready but yet we don't
[53:50] have our
[53:52] promise we're getting it ready because
[53:55] we're being ready amen now God he has
[53:59] made and desired a place to meet you
[54:04] amen and he's prepared this
[54:07] place he's gone and he's created a place
[54:11] many
[54:12] mansions prepared them just for you
[54:15] they're ex they're right to
[54:18] your I don't know how to say it your
[54:20] level or whatever you know they're made
[54:23] just for you amen they're personal amen
[54:26] am he made it just for
[54:28] you
[54:30] and but he can't give you that place if
[54:35] you won't
[54:37] worship if you won't sell
[54:39] out if you won't give him your
[54:44] all it takes your sacrifice to make it
[54:48] there and so this is he made it ready
[54:52] for your
[54:53] use he made it ready now now this baby
[54:56] you know I'm going to get back to the
[54:57] baby I'm jumping all over the place I'm

[55:04] getting ready for this
[55:06] baby and we have the room
[55:10] prepared and we're like man we're so
[55:12] prepared but then that last minute my
[55:15] wife goes I don't know do we have enough

[56:00] closet wherever it is and you go and get
[56:03] serious with God and he'll come and meet
[56:07] you there he's not worried about if you
[56:10] have enough quotes or enough scriptures
[56:12] or
[56:14] enough experience in the Christian faith
[56:17] he's not worried about that he's worried
[56:20] about a heart he's worried about a heart
[56:23] that can get humbled out and come into
[56:25] that Pres
[56:27] and come into that s glory and watch him
[56:30] just move and and mend your hearts the
[56:32] Brokenness and the hurts and the and the

[56:37] get serious with God and come into that
[56:40] presence and that unfailing presence
[56:42] that failing that that never failing
[56:44] presence of God if you just get into
[56:46] that presence and just forget about
[56:48] yourself forget about your feelings

[56:52] forget about how hard it was when you
[56:54] got up to go to church how hard it was
[56:55] to get that baby dressed how hard it was
[56:58] he's not worried about all the all the
[57:00] problems he's just worried about someone
[57:02] that's willing to go he's worried about
[57:04] someone that's willing to just sell out
[57:05] sell all that they are remember that one
[57:07] boy the rich the Rich Young Ruler he
[57:10] would go up to Jesus said how can I
[57:12] receive eternal
[57:14] life Jesus
[57:16] said keep my
[57:20] Commandments that's
[57:22] it keep my
[57:25] Commandments says well I've done that

[58:08] instructions that Jesus gave
[58:10] them and then give
[58:13] all give all to who the people that
[58:17] don't got nothing the
[58:20] poor give it all he was looking for
[58:23] someone to be willing you see
[58:26] he was seeing is this boy I know he came
[58:29] up to me with this question but is he
[58:31] willing to go all the
[58:34] way you follow me is he willing to give
[58:38] it all is he willing to surrender is he
[58:41] willing to die out and become a new is
[58:46] he willing to completely go through the
[58:48] whole process is he willing for me to
[58:51] not just stop at the outer court and go
[58:54] into the inner Court and into the Sha
[58:58] Glory or is he going to hold off and be
[59:00] like
[59:01] hey stepping on my toes there I want to
[59:05] go to the club on
[59:09] Monday I want to go over here on
[59:12] Tuesday I want to drink my alcohol on
[59:15] Thursday I'll go to church on Wednesday
[59:22] though he was not looking for that he
[59:25] was looking for something someone who
[59:26] would
[59:27] dedicate and sell
[59:29] out all of his Ambitions his thoughts
[59:32] his ideas his hurts everything he wanted
[59:35] it all he wanted him to just say all
[59:37] right
[59:38] Lord here I give it all it's just as
[59:42] simple as giving him the keys to your
[59:46] house you just pull the keys he's just
[59:49] looking for some
[59:50] keys he wants your
[59:54] place but it's just he's waiting for
[59:57] someone to take the
[59:58] key and give it back to
[1:00:03] him he wants the key but we're so
[1:00:06] stubborn because we're afraid that he's
[1:00:09] going to come in our house and find
[1:00:10] something that we don't want him to
[1:00:15] find we're afraid that this key that
[1:00:19] goes into the bedroom might find
[1:00:22] something he don't want to find
[1:00:27] that key to your
[1:00:30] heart he's waiting on someone to give
[1:00:33] him that last
[1:00:35] key but you want to hold on to that
[1:00:41] lust you want to hold on to that
[1:00:44] hurt that
[1:00:49] Brokenness feeling like nobody loves
[1:00:53] you feeling like nobody cares about
[1:00:58] you he's looking for someone to give him
[1:01:02] that
[1:01:07] place prophet of God says here it
[1:01:10] is I just happened to come up or come to
[1:01:15] it happened to come to me then brother
[1:01:17] if you're only wearing a church garment
[1:01:20] you better get rid of that thing you
[1:01:23] can't go behind the holiest of holies
[1:01:27] the Garment that the high priest wore in
[1:01:30] there had to be made out of by the holy
[1:01:34] land a selected Goods amen ordained of
[1:01:38] God there it
[1:01:40] is so if you join church and you think
[1:01:43] it's all right you're
[1:01:46] wrong see it has to be God select it has
[1:01:50] to be a god selected
[1:01:52] robe and our self-righteous rags won't
[1:01:56] stand in his
[1:01:58] presence it takes the Holy Spirit which
[1:02:01] is the robe of God that dresses the
[1:02:03] believer behind the holiest of holy oh
[1:02:06] that's good I like that that was a new
[1:02:09] one never swallowed one like that
[1:02:12] before but that is or that's it just
[1:02:17] that kind it's that real vitamin see it
[1:02:21] takes the holy spirit so that Holy
[1:02:23] Spirit is your garment it should be your
[1:02:24] garment it should be what follows you it
[1:02:26] should be with what's on you it should

[1:14:25] there's a certain time and there's a
[1:14:27] certain
[1:14:28] place where God will deal with
[1:14:32] you
[1:14:34] amen it's not it's not always in the
[1:14:37] times that you feel
[1:14:38] comfortable he wants you to get
[1:14:41] uncomfortable so he can do
[1:14:43] something he doesn't want you to be
[1:14:46] comfortable in your nice little
[1:14:50] habitat where you feel good and you have
[1:14:52] all the friends in the world and you
[1:14:53] have everyone that seemed to before you
[1:14:57] hey don't trust your friends more than
[1:15:01] God the Bible says in Jeremiah he said
[1:15:04] cursed is the man that trusteth in a man
[1:15:07] and maketh flesh his arm that's
[1:15:11] right but blessed is the man whose hope
[1:15:15] the Lord
[1:15:16] is
[1:15:19] am what was Jeremiah
[1:15:22] saying he was saying don't trust trust
[1:15:25] in the friends don't trust in your
[1:15:27] rulers don't trust in these people but
[1:15:30] trust
[1:15:31] God trust God in the good and in the bad
[1:15:36] because he'll be there for you Paul said
[1:15:38] I've never nor never seen the righteous
[1:15:41] forsaken never seen it have you ever
[1:15:44] seen anyone forsaken never seen it I've
[1:15:47] never seen anyone forsaken because Jesus
[1:15:49] said I will never leave you nor will I
[1:15:51] forsake you but I'll be with you always
[1:15:54] even until the end of the world Amen
[1:15:56] it's a promise friends it's a promise
[1:15:58] that he'll be with you in the good and
[1:16:00] in the bad he'll be there for you in
[1:16:02] your hurts and your Brokenness because
[1:16:04] he loves you and there's a place of
[1:16:05] safety he's a refuge he's a strong tower
[1:16:10] the righteous run into it they shall be
[1:16:11] saved they run into that Tower they'll
[1:16:14] be saved because that God that you serve
[1:16:16] he's there with his wings he's ready to
[1:16:18] take you into his Embrace he wants to
[1:16:21] hold you he wants to care for you but so
[1:16:24] many times we we are
[1:16:26] scared we're scared of that
[1:16:29] presence we're scared of God to
[1:16:32] move we're scared to
[1:16:35] surrender we're scared that God
[1:16:38] might have us act out of order
[1:16:47] maybe he might make you dance a little
[1:16:53] bit some people are scared of the
[1:16:58] gifts they're scared of discernment
[1:17:02] because they're fine with their little
[1:17:05] secret
[1:17:10] sins they're fine with nobody knowing
[1:17:14] about their
[1:17:16] Brokenness just the other day I was
[1:17:19] speaking on a little thought broken but
[1:17:22] not forsaken
[1:17:25] so many times our trial breaks
[1:17:31] us but really the trial if you look back
[1:17:35] wasn't the trial that really broke
[1:17:37] you you broke
[1:17:41] yourself the prophet of God said the
[1:17:44] greatest your greatest enemy is
[1:17:50] yourself because this
[1:17:52] flesh can't be sa
[1:17:56] saved can't be
[1:17:59] forgiven but your soul
[1:18:03] can your greatest enemy is
[1:18:06] yourself those things that you've
[1:18:10] done in your life you beat yourself
[1:18:15] up I if I could have done
[1:18:18] this or if I could have done
[1:18:21] that or if I could have said this or you
[1:18:24] know preachers we do it when we
[1:18:29] preach man if I could have read that
[1:18:31] scripture or if I could have read that
[1:18:34] quote or if I could have if I could have
[1:18:36] I could have could
[1:18:38] have we play it all that time man I man
[1:18:42] I had that on the tip of my tongue and I
[1:18:43] couldn't say man can I go back and say
[1:18:46] you know we play that game all
[1:18:49] along
[1:18:51] we we battle
[1:18:54] we battle our flesh because our flesh
[1:18:57] men speak man if we could have made the
[1:18:59] Lord move but you can't make the Lord do
[1:19:06] nothing he's looking for someone to
[1:19:09] surrender you feel
[1:19:13] me he's looking for
[1:19:16] someone that will love
[1:19:19] him how do you show your love to him
[1:19:24] by
[1:19:27] worshiping in spirit and in
[1:19:32] truth that's how you show
[1:19:36] love
[1:19:39] God loves you so
[1:19:43] much you know why often times do we have
[1:19:48] troubled
[1:19:49] hearts and wonder if God loves
[1:19:52] us you know because Jesus said in the
[1:19:55] Bible he said let not your heart be
[1:19:58] troubled ye believe in
[1:20:03] God if you believe in God why are you
[1:20:11] troubled believe also in
[1:20:15] me like you know we I'm saying we
[1:20:19] because I know how it is man if I hate
[1:20:22] how the guys at work treat us you know
[1:20:25] and we play this
[1:20:28] man work is I don't want to go back
[1:20:32] nobody
[1:20:34] does just like I didn't want to go to
[1:20:37] school I played that sick card a
[1:20:40] lot you ever done
[1:20:46] that I'd like to play that card at work
[1:20:48] too but you know doesn't
[1:20:51] work boss catches on a little bit
[1:20:55] I'm just messing
[1:20:57] around but in my father's house are many
[1:21:01] mansions if it were not so I would have
[1:21:03] told
[1:21:05] you he's not a man that he should lie
[1:21:08] David
[1:21:10] said I go and prepare a place for
[1:21:16] you are you thankful that he prepared a
[1:21:19] place for
[1:21:21] you a place
[1:21:25] where moth nor
[1:21:27] rust nor thieves can break
[1:21:30] in but a place of
[1:21:34] safety he went and prepared that place
[1:21:37] you know the Bible would tell you that
[1:21:39] where your heart is there is where your
[1:21:40] treasure is
[1:21:42] also where's your heart at this
[1:21:45] morning can I get personal for a little
[1:21:50] bit do you love the pleasures of world
[1:21:53] More Than Love of
[1:21:55] God because I'm reminded as my Bible
[1:21:58] would tell me lovers of
[1:22:01] Pleasures if they love the pleasures
[1:22:03] more than the love of God the love of
[1:22:05] God's not even in
[1:22:14] them and if I go and prepare a place for
[1:22:17] you I will come again that was a promise
[1:22:20] he's coming
[1:22:23] back not just for one of you I want to
[1:22:26] trust and believe it's for all of
[1:22:31] us and receive you unto
[1:22:37] myself you see that's a great love
[1:22:40] story he's going to come back for you
[1:22:44] and for me and receive
[1:22:48] you to
[1:22:50] himself the greatest love story
[1:23:02] and receive you unto myself that where I
[1:23:05] am ye may be
[1:23:08] also that's into our celestial
[1:23:12] bodies over
[1:23:14] there that you will be with
[1:23:18] him and whether I
[1:23:21] go ye go in the way ye know now Thomas
[1:23:27] would say unto him Lord we know not
[1:23:29] whether thou goest and how can we
[1:23:34] know he was always doubting wasn't he
[1:23:38] like I mean it seems like I heard him
[1:23:40] you know be told of doubting
[1:23:44] Thomas doubting Thomas he was
[1:23:50] doubting Jesus said unto him I am the
[1:23:53] way the truth and the life no man cometh
[1:23:59] unto me or unto the father but by
[1:24:04] me and if you had known me ye should
[1:24:08] have known that my f or known my father
[1:24:10] also and from henceforth ye know him and
[1:24:14] have seen
[1:24:17] him it's a promise
[1:24:20] friends it's a promise of love
[1:24:26] friends if I in closing it as musicians
[1:24:30] would
[1:24:31] come held you in captivity long
[1:24:41] enough I'd like
[1:24:44] to
[1:24:47] maybe for a few moments just in
[1:24:51] closing give you a little thought
[1:25:05] How Great Is Our God splend of the
[1:25:08] king cloth
[1:25:20] inest you see friends so many times
[1:25:28] we
[1:25:30] wonder what would my friend say if I
[1:25:32] make a
[1:25:35] [Music]
[1:25:39] place what
[1:25:41] would what would my mama say if I
[1:25:45] completely
[1:25:47] surrendered we're always
[1:25:52] fighting friends I can I give you a
[1:25:54] little bit of my
[1:25:59] background for
[1:26:03] years I was raised under a
[1:26:08] doctrine of return
[1:26:13] Ministry now all I ever knew was a
[1:26:17] prophet all I ever knew was a tent
[1:26:20] Vision Tent
[1:26:22] Revival but I never knew the god
[1:26:29] you see friends I I had went off a
[1:26:32] mama's experience off a daddy's
[1:26:34] experience now they wouldn't never claim
[1:26:36] that but that's what they
[1:26:41] believed and all I ever knew was this
[1:26:43] and that and quotes and you know a few
[1:26:46] scriptures here and there but I knew
[1:26:48] more stories about a man's
[1:26:50] life than I did a god of the Bible
[1:26:58] Bible all I ever knew was a
[1:27:03] prophet but you see friends it's deeper
[1:27:05] than a
[1:27:07] man it's deeper than a
[1:27:11] vessel God can use Joshua can use
[1:27:14] brother Henry he can use anyone in this
[1:27:18] room they have to be
[1:27:21] willing but you see if brother Henry
[1:27:24] would preach this sermon that I'm
[1:27:26] preaching right
[1:27:27] now God can use him to meet someone I
[1:27:31] maybe
[1:27:33] can't but notice it's not he or I it's
[1:27:35] the gift that's in him it's the gift
[1:27:37] that's in
[1:27:38] me but it's the God who gave that gift
[1:27:43] that works that gift now notice you
[1:27:45] operate this gift I can't operate this
[1:27:48] he can't operate it you operate it how
[1:27:52] do you operate it by saying amen
[1:27:56] you know I come from that background of
[1:27:57] door dead than a
[1:28:01] doornail it was a sin almost to say
[1:28:06] Amen everybody stand up when the tape
[1:28:09] gets played everybody sits down you know
[1:28:13] I'm I'm not talking
[1:28:16] bad I'm just saying you
[1:28:18] know we worship of man I I knew a man
[1:28:24] I knew some thought some idea I can tell
[1:28:26] you the scriptures that he preached
[1:28:29] for for uh
[1:28:34] Rapture his background scripture for
[1:28:36] that was psalms
[1:28:39] 27 for in the times of
[1:28:46] trouble you see all I ever knew was
[1:28:49] scriptures or thoughts or
[1:28:52] quotes but friends it's not that way
[1:28:55] doesn't have to be that way he can't
[1:28:58] make the place for
[1:28:59] you you have to make the place for
[1:29:03] yourself so that the God that
[1:29:06] he had in him can come and meet you and
[1:29:10] be in you
[1:29:13] also friends I I didn't know that for a
[1:29:16] long
[1:29:17] time about 15 years old I completely
[1:29:21] surrendered and was baptized
[1:29:28] but all I ever knew was that background
[1:29:30] until that experience hit
[1:29:34] me I was almost dumbfounded when I found
[1:29:37] out man are you telling me that there
[1:29:39] was more to this
[1:29:44] story I'm not saying I didn't know what
[1:29:46] God I knew of
[1:29:48] him but it seemed like this man was more
[1:29:52] of the responsibility
[1:29:58] than what he should have
[1:30:00] been I'm not discrediting him
[1:30:07] now but you see friends I when I came in
[1:30:10] contact with
[1:30:11] God God completely changed my
[1:30:16] life it couldn't be my mama tell me that
[1:30:19] that was wrong it couldn't be my daddy
[1:30:20] telling me that it was wrong
[1:30:24] or to do this or to do
[1:30:26] that but it was
[1:30:29] now my daddy
[1:30:32] God tell me hey get your life in
[1:30:38] order he brought order into my life as
[1:30:41] many quotes as I knew telling me that
[1:30:43] this is wrong you can't chew gum in the
[1:30:45] church and you
[1:30:46] can't you know that that wasn't going to
[1:30:48] cut it that's not my
[1:30:51] salvation but when God got a hold of my
[1:30:53] life
[1:30:56] life he changed
[1:30:59] me he told me what the way should be he
[1:31:03] told me how to go that way he showed me
[1:31:06] how to walk showed me how to talk showed
[1:31:10] me how to act it wasn't based off a
[1:31:13] religion
[1:31:14] anymore you know what a religion is
[1:31:17] Prophet God told us it's a
[1:31:20] covering it's a covering it's so that
[1:31:23] people if they want to know more they
[1:31:25] have to pry for
[1:31:27] it hey uncover that thing let me see
[1:31:30] what do you
[1:31:42] believe I remember 15 years old I
[1:31:46] was I had gotten contact with God and
[1:31:49] you know in the Christian faith you have
[1:31:52] ups and downs
[1:31:55] well I learned how it is to get
[1:31:59] distant and I got distant within that
[1:32:02] few months period about 16 and a half I
[1:32:07] was a little Wayward and running from a
[1:32:10] call I knew the Lord was calling me to
[1:32:13] preach I didn't want to do it I didn't
[1:32:16] want nothing to do with
[1:32:19] it I
[1:32:21] ran hung out with the wrong crowd
[1:32:30] cussed I'm just being
[1:32:35] transparent you see friends I as I was
[1:32:38] out with these
[1:32:41] people I remember the Lord working
[1:32:44] through my grandma cuz all my daddy
[1:32:47] would do would tell me hey you're wrong
[1:32:49] you're wrong you know you're doing wrong
[1:32:51] hey this is that you know you need to do
[1:32:54] this and I was like Dad be
[1:32:58] quiet know I
[1:33:01] mean and as I started to do my own thing
[1:33:06] my grandma called me one day and says
[1:33:07] hey we have some church
[1:33:10] meetings now I knew if there was one
[1:33:12] person in the world my Grandma loved
[1:33:16] me and uh she called me and asked me if
[1:33:20] I'd
[1:33:21] come so I went to those meetings
[1:33:25] and I remember a preacher he uh he was
[1:33:29] preaching
[1:33:31] and he uh I think he was preaching on
[1:33:34] this is the sound of your
[1:33:38] freedom and he looks at me and he says
[1:33:41] Dylan how long are you going to
[1:33:45] run I never told him a
[1:33:49] thing and I looked at him and I tried to
[1:33:52] pretend like I didn't hear him
[1:33:55] and he says how long are you going to
[1:33:57] run and he come down right to my
[1:34:00] level he stepped off the stage and he
[1:34:04] came right over to
[1:34:06] me and he said God called
[1:34:12] you and he says why don't you get your
[1:34:15] life back in
[1:34:16] order and he walked away just him saying
[1:34:20] that impacted me so much
[1:34:24] I was at an altar within two
[1:34:30] seconds and as I was at that altar the
[1:34:33] Lord completely changed my
[1:34:35] life filled me with the Holy
[1:34:40] Spirit you know I I didn't ask for a
[1:34:43] gift I didn't ask for a
[1:34:45] call but it was placed in you from
[1:34:48] birth from
[1:34:50] birth you can't send away that gift amen
[1:34:54] cuz it's in you you can misplace that
[1:34:57] gift but you can't send it
[1:35:01] away and so the Lord completely changed
[1:35:04] my life over this course of time and
[1:35:06] about 17 and a half I started
[1:35:11] preaching I didn't start in a
[1:35:14] church I started on the
[1:35:18] streets I was preaching to people on the
[1:35:20] sidewalks
[1:35:24] preaching to people at the
[1:35:28] parks preaching to people doing some
[1:35:31] missionary work on the Indian
[1:35:37] reservations I remember one
[1:35:40] time I was in Phoenix Arizona staying
[1:35:44] with my
[1:35:48] aunt and I heard a woman
[1:35:52] screaming and this woman she was
[1:35:54] screaming with such a high pitch I'm in
[1:35:56] trouble kind of
[1:36:00] sound my first instinct is I'm going to
[1:36:03] go out and see if she's
[1:36:05] okay I went out and this woman she's
[1:36:08] pounding on this door let me in let me
[1:36:12] in let me
[1:36:14] in I I said ma'am are you okay I didn't
[1:36:17] know what to do she didn't hear me and
[1:36:20] she kept screaming louder and louder and
[1:36:22] louder I said said ma'am are you
[1:36:27] okay and she
[1:36:29] says it's just so hard I said what's
[1:36:33] going
[1:36:34] on what it was was her her dad had left
[1:36:37] her and the
[1:36:39] family it was around Christmas
[1:36:43] time she didn't have nobody she felt
[1:36:46] like she didn't have
[1:36:48] nobody she said my daddy left us and
[1:36:51] it's just so different not having him
[1:36:53] here for
[1:36:55] Christmas he won't have nothing to do
[1:36:57] with us no contact nothing he just
[1:36:59] completely left the face of the
[1:37:02] Earth she said I don't know what to do I
[1:37:05] said I know a man that can help
[1:37:08] you I started telling her about
[1:37:11] Jesus within a two-minute period of me
[1:37:14] talking to
[1:37:16] her her frantic her being frantic
[1:37:21] stopped and now she she walks back
[1:37:25] inside her brother noticed a
[1:37:30] change her brother comes out walks up to
[1:37:33] me and gets face to face with me and he
[1:37:35] says was that you that just talked to my

[1:55:15] if I can I'd like to share one more
[1:55:21] testimony maybe two there's just a
[1:55:23] wonderful
[1:55:28] presence for about a year and a half I
[1:55:32] had a sister-in-law that
[1:55:33] would run with a homosexual
[1:55:39] spirit I don't know why I feel led to
[1:55:41] share this but she ran with the spirit
[1:55:44] and it was battling her she didn't want
[1:55:46] nothing to do with
[1:55:50] church because she knew the church would
[1:55:54] tell her that she was
[1:55:55] [Music]
[1:55:59] wrong
[1:56:01] friends she didn't want nothing to do
[1:56:03] with a preacher she didn't want nothing
[1:56:06] to do with her mama didn't want nothing
[1:56:09] to do with her brother-in-law nothing to
[1:56:10] do with her sister she didn't want
[1:56:13] nothing to do with us because she knew
[1:56:14] that we were church
[1:56:17] members so she ran she moved to another
[1:56:21] state
[1:56:24] lived this life for a year and a
[1:56:29] half but then one day the Lord started
[1:56:31] dealing on our
[1:56:35] heart
[1:56:36] friends it wasn't how many sermons I
[1:56:39] could preach wasn't how many sermons her
[1:56:41] daddy could
[1:56:46] preach but it was because the Lord is
[1:56:49] real
[1:56:54] he came by and told her go to
[1:56:58] church she went to a church and this
[1:57:02] church the people ex uh had accepted her
[1:57:07] but the pastor
[1:57:09] didn't says I don't want to see you back
[1:57:12] because of the way you
[1:57:16] look she left church didn't want to go
[1:57:20] back but she still had this burden on
[1:57:23] her heart this tug on her
[1:57:26] soul she couldn't let it
[1:57:28] go she called me and
[1:57:31] said Dylan can I go to church with
[1:57:36] you I said
[1:57:39] absolutely I knew the pastor that turned
[1:57:41] her
[1:57:42] away know him very
[1:57:45] well I wondered for a
[1:57:49] moment if he won't let a sinner in his
[1:57:53] church what's he
[1:57:56] preaching is he preaching about the
[1:57:58] grace of
[1:58:00] God is he preaching about the love of
[1:58:05] God or is he just preaching some thought
[1:58:09] or some idea
[1:58:11] friends I told the Lord I said
[1:58:15] Lord I don't want to preach a sermon
[1:58:17] just to preach A good sermon
[1:58:22] I'm not a
[1:58:24] preacher I've I've been around way
[1:58:26] better
[1:58:28] preachers but I'm a
[1:58:34] minister because I told the Lord I said
[1:58:36] Lord I don't want to preach A good
[1:58:39] sermon I want to preach a sermon that
[1:58:42] will minister to the
[1:58:44] hearts and if it's not doing
[1:58:47] that then why are we preaching
[1:58:52] it's it's not a good sermon that will
[1:58:54] get you
[1:58:55] saved but it's a sermon that can deep go
[1:58:58] deep down into your
[1:59:00] soul and make you want to
[1:59:04] change it will answer questions to your
[1:59:07] needs it'll answer your problems your
[1:59:10] family problems your
[1:59:13] hurts if you'd allow
[1:59:16] him and this sister-in-law she came to
[1:59:20] church with me and good friend of mine
[1:59:23] was preaching
[1:59:25] and I can't remember what he was
[1:59:30] preaching but through discernment he
[1:59:33] looked at her out of the whole
[1:59:36] crowd he said young
[1:59:38] sister says you've been walking down a
[1:59:41] dark dark road for the past year and a
[1:59:45] half and he says and you want to go
[1:59:50] free she knew he was talking to her she
[1:59:54] began to kind of cry he says come
[2:00:00] forward and she came forward to about
[2:00:03] right
[2:00:05] here and he looked at her and he got
[2:00:07] down on her level and he said
[2:00:12] sister he
[2:00:15] says I love
[2:00:20] you why did he tell her that he loved
[2:00:23] her cuz my Bible reads that love
[2:00:27] conquers a multitude of
[2:00:31] sin I love
[2:00:35] you she looked at him and she just began
[2:00:38] to
[2:00:40] cry it wasn't him telling her that he
[2:00:42] loved her but it was because the
[2:00:44] realization struck I'm
[2:00:48] loved you're loved and highly favored
[2:00:51] this morning for
[2:00:55] and she looked at him and he said sister
[2:00:58] do you believe that you could go
[2:01:01] free if I could show you all the love
[2:01:04] that I
[2:01:05] have how much
[2:01:08] more does God love
[2:01:12] you and she just
[2:01:14] broke and right there at my
[2:01:20] church she made the profession that God
[2:01:23] I leave my Wicked
[2:01:25] way and I completely sell out to
[2:01:29] you and I give you my all I want to
[2:01:32] serve you I want to worship you I want
[2:01:35] to love on you I want to be with
[2:01:38] you it wasn't
[2:01:41] anymore about walking a sinful life she
[2:01:44] wanted to leave that Wicked way because
[2:01:46] she stepped into a
[2:01:48] place and found a presence an unfailing
[2:01:53] presence and it took complete control of
[2:01:59] her and it broke the way that she was
[2:02:03] changed her you look at her today

[2:02:10] be that's what the gospel will do amen
