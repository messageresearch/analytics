Amen. &gt;&gt; The book of 1 Corinthians 6 and 14. [Music] Even in a day like this day, &gt;&gt; God still makes a way. [Music] He's still making a way for us. I was just reading that message. He making a way. Amen. God making making a way. Amen. He's making a way for us. And God the 14th verse. And God has both raised up the Lord and will raise us and will also raise up us by his own what? &gt;&gt; Power. &gt;&gt; His own power. Glory to God. Knowing know ye not that your bodies are what? &gt;&gt; Members. &gt;&gt; Are the members of Christ. Thank God &gt;&gt; that we know that. &gt;&gt; Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them a member of a what? &gt;&gt; Harl. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know that a great hollow the denominational system. You know what I'm saying? Not the people but the system. God forbid. What know ye not &gt;&gt; that which is joined to an hollow is what? &gt;&gt; One body. is one body. For two, says he shall be one flesh. But he that is joined unto what? &gt;&gt; To the Lord is &gt;&gt; one spirit. Flee what? &gt;&gt; Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body. But he that committeth fornication sinth against what? &gt;&gt; His own body. &gt;&gt; His own body. What? Know ye not that your body is what? &gt;&gt; The temple of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; which is where &gt;&gt; in you. &gt;&gt; It's in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; God gives you the contra the confident in knowing that your body belong to God. It's the temple of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; which is which you have of God and you are what? &gt;&gt; Not your own. &gt;&gt; Oh God. Thank you. For ye are what? &gt;&gt; Bought with a price. &gt;&gt; You're bought with a price. Therefore, glorify God in your body and in your what? &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Thank God for the word. Um, I thought this morning, you know, I had many things to say, but you're bought with a price. You're bought with a price. of us looking at God in simplicity and we were you know looking at those things but you bought with a price that this gospel that God is is giving us the word that God gives us is in simplicity. It's not something that you know way above us or way beneath us is God hiding himself in simplicity. And and and when you hear things that seem to be so intellectual that only the intelligence can understand it, God amen. He takes the wisdom of the world and he call it foolishness. You know, sometimes we think that we got to be able to speak the Greek and the Hebrew, you know, and we got to be able to understand those terminologies and sometimes we have to understand, you know, the the mysteries in such a complicated way that it's no more simple. But the the God mystery was that uh uh the the mystery of God was Christ coming in a manger. A little baby. A little baby coming down in a manger. God hiding himself in simplicity. Now, who would believe that the the God that's above us, the creator of heaven and earth, could come down and humble himself and come in a little baby? That was a mystery. That was a a great revelation. That was God kind. Amen. Praise God. Changing from Amen. God above us to come with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. But amen. Now uh somebody says well you know it's so above the intelligent folks that they could not comprehend. Amen. God coming down in such a simple way. &gt;&gt; Amen. uh uh the mighty God, the everlasting father and the prince of peace coming down in the form of a little little little baby. He was in the world and the world was made by him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God coming in such a simple manner but it was so simple that who would believe such a thing? Amen. &gt;&gt; The spirit God, the creator of heaven and earth, yet came down in in a virgin and come down as a little baby. &gt;&gt; Wrapped in swollen clothes, born in a manger. &gt;&gt; But who would believe that? That's the creator. Somebody, amen, that was able to create the universe, the stars and the moon and the sun. Yet he can come down in the form of a little baby. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lana, you talk about a deep mystery. You talk about being deep. That is deep. Amen. Because the intelligent mind or the individual would not be able to comprehend that God can that this this one that was standing among them, Jesus was the one that created the heavens and earth. that he was God. Amen. In flesh form. Who would believe that? Uh-uh. The people could not comprehend that God has condescended and come down in the body of human flesh. The Bible says, "In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; and the word was made flesh." Amen. &gt;&gt; And dwelt among us. &gt;&gt; God coming down and making himself a body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And gets in that body to reconcile the world. So this morning we're talking about bought with a price in first Corinthians here uh as we talk at six 1 Corinthians 6 here bought with the price. It says in the 20 verse for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify. Amen. God in your bodies and in your spirit which is of God. [Music] Let me back up to the 19th verse and read that again. What know ye not that your body is what? &gt;&gt; Temple of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now in time past when we were not saved and we were in the world and we were you little you know just living any kind of life we wanted to live. But when Christ came into us and he had to remind the church because the church was doing things that were against the body. They were doing things that they shouldn't have been done doing as believers and as Christians folk were doing what they used to do before they got saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I'm saying he said you're not your own. Now, when it comes down to Christians having a choice, the bornag again believer does not have a choice. Now, you might say, uh, now there's no choice that we have. We the choice has already been made. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We realize that uh we didn't choose him, but he chose us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and because he chose us, I'm glad he did. &gt;&gt; I'm glad that God Amen. I didn't come seeking for God. God sought after me. &gt;&gt; When Adam said he was hiding &gt;&gt; and God said, "Where are you, Adam?" Adam said, "I'm hiding." He said, "Why?" He said, "Because I'm naked." &gt;&gt; See, Adam realized that sin, amen, couldn't come in God's presence no more. So, he hid from God. God went and found Adam. &gt;&gt; Praise God. He said, "What you done?" And God is saying to you, "Amen. When we are running from God, what have you done, man?" In his in in in a sinful state, amen, he runs from God. But God seeks you out. The Bible says, "The step of a good man ordered by the Lord." The Bible tells us, amen, God forneew us and and and for knowing us, he predestinated us to be conformed into the image of him. So God, he he comes after us. Doesn't matter where you are. &gt;&gt; No matter how old you are, how young you are, God comes after you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knows how to find you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he found me when I was young. When I was a teenager trying ripping and running, I didn't want God, but God wanted me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't want him cuz I I I was too busy with the worldly things. I didn't want him, but he wanted me. &gt;&gt; Often you as humans and as fleshly beings, we don't want God. But God, Amen. He seeks out to him you because he knows what you need. He knows that you need him. &gt;&gt; So God knows how to get you &gt;&gt; when you don't want him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; As I say often times, the Bible says God should supply all of our needs. &gt;&gt; He said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. But we want what we don't need. &gt;&gt; And what we need, we don't want it. Amen. So, and and that seems to be the attitude of man. He's always trying to run away from God, not run to God. Because the Amen. And the the the things of God, this flesh don't we were born in sin, shaping, and iniquity. And we're by nature, Amen. the children of wrath. And we were enemies in our minds. Amen. And that's why God had to come to us to get us. Amen. Because we were covered by a spirit of disobedience. &gt;&gt; Our spirit was we disobeyed God. We didn't want God, &gt;&gt; but God knew we needed him. It's something about &gt;&gt; the favor of God being with you &gt;&gt; and he comes. You know, I I I said for a subtopic this morning, I am redeemed. And and it goes back to the the subject this morning, bought with a price. And in uh Acts 2028, Acts 20 and 28, I'm bought with the price. It was a You are valuable. See, somewhat we don't realize how valuable we are to God. To God, you are you you you are valuable. You you mean something. You know, we don't value ourselves. We don't value our life. But God values you. &gt;&gt; He values you so much. He shows and proves to you that I love you and I value you. &gt;&gt; Sometimes people say nobody cares about me. Nobody, you know, God cares about you. &gt;&gt; He values you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was not by uh something that you will or you wanted. But God wanted you. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God ordain your steps and God have you here or have you under the sound of a voice to show Amen. You said why I sometimes we sometimes we don't even want to listen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But God knows that we Amen. He puts us in a in a place that that you hear. Amen. When you don't want to hear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes you you you you're in a family or you have parents or you have individuals that that witness to you that you sometime you want to close up your ears and I don't want to hear it. But God has a way of saying, "Amen. Amen. You belong to me and I'm not going to let you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not going to let you get away because you belong to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you said, "Well," and that's that's the way it is. You you can run, but you can't hide. &gt;&gt; If you belong to God, God got a way of finding you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And because he loves you and he cares about you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Acts 20 and 28, he says here, I'm talking about bought with a price more uh excuse me, he says, Take heed therefore unto who? He talking to the preachers. He says Paul getting ready to go off the scene and he just getting ready to die. And um before he died, he was talking about he had shown to declare the whole all the council of God. And he's talking to the preacher. He's telling them what to do. He said, "Take heed therefore unto yourselves." I'm talking about bought with the price.

Overseer and a bishop and an elder and all of that. One one thing. The Holy Ghost got to make you overseer. Man can make you a bishop. Man can make you overseer. Man can make you a pastor. But God got to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If the Holy Ghost don't do it, you got man-made religion. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if the Holy Ghost does it, Amen. you didn't have nothing to do with it. Amen. When God comes into you, it's a gift. Amen. The Holy Ghost is the gift of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You didn't pay for it. &gt;&gt; You didn't do nothing. Amen. All you had to do is receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And the Holy Ghost is not a thing. It's a person. &gt;&gt; It's Christ in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he comes down in you, you're no more your own. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're no more your own. And you're bought with a price. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. You're no more your own. You don't want to be your own. &gt;&gt; Because you look back what you was and what you are now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was a sinner. I was wretched and undone. &gt;&gt; I was no good. I was a liar. I was a thief. I was everything. &gt;&gt; Praise God. But God saved me one day. &gt;&gt; I was a ho. I was this. I was that. Yes. But God save us one day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank God for saving me one day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, I'm glad I'm glad he chose me. &gt;&gt; I'm I I I've been bought with a price. I didn't know it now. &gt;&gt; I I I was bought with a price. Amen. And I didn't even know it. &gt;&gt; But I'm so glad I know it now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. I didn't know it. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen, James. I didn't know it. I was bought with the price. I I didn't know it. That's why I did all kind of crazy stuff. I didn't know I was bought with a price. &gt;&gt; But when I recognize I'm I'm bought with a price, &gt;&gt; it was valuable. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. One of you were locked up. Amen.

You know how she used those nice words. And I thought about the children. I thought about the children. And I thought about, you know, I'm knocking doors in here and I'm trying to get the people into a better life, but you know, sometimes we don't want a better. &gt;&gt; We think what we doing is cool. What we doing is all right. We don't want better. We we we're satisfied. We're just Oh, God. Can you see this? I can't be satisfied with that. Some people just adjust to it. They think that this is the way it is and it's all right with me. But I couldn't adjust to it. I It wasn't all right. I could not adopt to it. I didn't want to because I didn't want that. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You can make your adjustment. You can relax and say it's all right. But I couldn't do it. &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad that God saw me as a young person and saved me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't want to be a preacher, but he saved me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Didn't think I was intelligent enough or good enough and and didn't think I was I was too I was too afraid to be a preacher, but by the grace of God against my own will. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. God Amen. Amen. Uh did something in my life that I just had to testify. Amen. &gt;&gt; I had to tell somebody that God saved me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he got me out of that pit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What I should have been, what I could have been. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God loved me enough to care about me &gt;&gt; and to come get me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I had nothing on nobody else. &gt;&gt; I was no good. I was no better than them. But thank God for his grace and mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's just a God's grace and mercy on my life. &gt;&gt; And I and I thank him. I don't want to get up here and cry like a baby, but I thank him. &gt;&gt; I thank God for his grace and mercy. &gt;&gt; Cuz he came to get me. &gt;&gt; Praise God. It means so much to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I want to tell it. Don't mind testifying. Amen. All my family said, "You were never so bad. You was a good boy." But I know how rich I was. I don't care what they say. Amen. Because they went a little further and a little longer than I did. But I thank God I was wretched to me. I was just as wretch as anybody. Might be more cuz I was more sneaky. Praise God. when I was rich. Let me go back to the 28th verse. God, y'all, y'all bear with me. Get get me shook up because I recognize that I'm bold with the price. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and I've been I am redeemed. I I I really recognize the value of it. Lord have mercy. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you for loving me. &gt;&gt; Thank you for caring. Thank you, Lord. Means so much to me now. Come too far. Thank you. Never thought I'd live to be the age I am. [Music] Sometimes you don't care if you live or die. [Music] went to join the military and got to the last doctor. He said, "You can't come in. You're 4F. You got a knee operation." At that time, I would have went to Vietnam. That didn't mind going. But God saw mercy. Didn't even let me get in because I probably wouldn't have made it back home. That's just that. didn't care. How many young people don't care this morning? How many people taking their lives and just really they don't even value living? They don't care. But I'm glad that God gave me something to care about, a purpose for living. Because sometimes we don't understand our purpose for living. We have no no purpose. When you don't have purpose, you might do anything because you don't have purpose. You don't know how valuable your life is or how valuable you are, but you you're very much valuable to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; He He saw how valuable you were to him. He cared so much about you and loved you so he said God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. Okay. Take heed to the flock there. Take heed therefore unto the unto yourselves and to all the flock over to which the Holy Ghost has made you overseer to feed the church of God which he has &gt;&gt; which he is what &gt;&gt; I said you bought with what? &gt;&gt; Which he has purchased with what? &gt;&gt; Now God God is a spirit right? &gt;&gt; We all we with that. But he said the church of God, the church belong to who? It it don't belong to the Baptist, the Methodists, the Pentecost, the apostolic. The church belong to who? &gt;&gt; God. And he purchased it what? &gt;&gt; With his own blood. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; The valuable. You're so valuable that God purchased you with his own blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; Anytime a bishop, a preacher, a church, a group, sometime the church think they they save you cuz they say come and join the church. You can join the church, you can join the lodge, but you can't join God's church. You got to be born in it. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Except a man be born again, he cannot enter the kingdom of God." Are you with me? How did I be born? He said, "You must be born of water and the spirit." Are you with me? You must repent of your sin, be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin, and the promise is you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Okay. So, by the grace of God, I I got to get to my last part for I ought to stop here, but I'm going to try to get to the last part. First Peter 1 and 18. First Peter 1. I I am redeemed. To redeem means to be bought back. It's like putting something in the pawn shop and you're coming back and you're getting it back out. Amen. What you put in, you get out. &gt;&gt; Amen. We were sold to sin and we needed to be redeemed. We need to be bought back to God. We lost fellowship with God. We couldn't get to God, but God came and got He came to us. We couldn't get to him. He put angels to block the way to the tree of life. Cherobims, you couldn't get back to God. You were blocked. If you can get back to God, you can eat of the tree of life and live forever. &gt;&gt; But because we couldn't get to God, God came to us. &gt;&gt; And because you and your sins can't get to God, God comes to the center. Are you with me? And he makes a way an at torment. He makes a a a sacrifice. He says here in the of 18th verse he says 1 Peter uh 1:18 for as much as ye know that ye were redeemed that you're not redeemed with corruptible things as what? &gt;&gt; Silver and gold. &gt;&gt; That's where people are caught up with silver and gold. Come to church, they taking up all that money. Give more. Give more. You get blessed. Give more. Get blessed. Oh man. Come on. You know, I think about when I was a little boy going up to what they call the block and looking at, you know, those guys that call yourself pimps and hustlers and all, you know, and I looked at them how they do, you know, and saying how they do, the young ladies and all. And I look at some of the preachers in the pull pit and remind me of those guys. Those guys are smooth talkers. Smooth talkers. I often time tell about fella pull my little group over to the side, open up a little briefcase and it was full of big bills. He said to us, he said to me, you know, you dropped this off. &gt;&gt; I gave you a package to drop off. In other words, this is yours. Drop the package off. &gt;&gt; Some of my friends looked &gt;&gt; and they stared at all those all that money and I told them, "Come on here. Get yourself on, man. We ain't going for that. I think one of the fellas with me, he became one of a big time drug dealer later in life. But at that time, I says, "Come on." Wouldn't because I didn't I didn't play that. And I'm saying, you'll be tempted plenty of times. silver and gold, money. What we wouldn't redeem was things as silver and gold. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; If you want the things of this world, silver and gold, and that those things mean something. You know, a lot of people, they take the gospel and they sell it. They get in the pull pit and they sell they make merchandise of the congregation, make merchandise of the people. And a lot of people get in the mind that what they give they giving to the church or giving to the preacher. But what you give you give to God. If you're giving it and you give it with a cheerful heart and you don't expect nothing in return because God blesses the what? &gt;&gt; Cheer forgiver. Yeah. But people believe that because of what they give that they gonna get special treatment. Amen. God don't care if you don't give but a penny. Are you with me? God going to bless you. Amen. Because he knows you gave what you could. Are you with me? But oh, I ain't getting on to that. But you wasn't redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold. Okay. From your vain conversation lifestyle received by the the tradition from your fathers, but with the what? &gt;&gt; See, it's the precious blood. You know, I I I when I was looking at that, I said it's precious. &gt;&gt; The blood's so precious that it could redeem us. It could buy us back. Only the blood of God can do that. Because every man that was born of a woman was born in sin. But Jesus was not born in sin. Amen. He was born of a virgin. Not by sex act. But God created egg and sperm. And Jesus was born of a virgin. Are you with me? [Music] The precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without what? &gt;&gt; Who verily was what? &gt;&gt; For ordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifested in these last times. What? for you whom by him do believe in God that raised him from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be where? &gt;&gt; In God. &gt;&gt; In God. &gt;&gt; I got to stop. His blood is precious. His blood is valuable. You have been redeemed. your your sins have been paid for. You live a life once you have been born again. And once you have been redeemed, because you have been born again, you've been washed in the blood of the lamb, you don't make choices no more. When you're born again, you become a new creation, a new creature. Any man being in Christ, he's a new creature. Old things are passed away. Behold, all things are new. Amen. You're here now. Amen. You have his divine nature. You don't Hey, if I want if I want to do sin, I can sin. But because of my nature change, I don't have the desire to sin no more. I don't have a desire to do the things I used to do. Why? because I'm born again, because he's changed me. Amen. Because he's come in, and because he abide, I don't have that same desire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Well, well, how come people Amen. that's born again end up doing things, Amen, that's out there in the world." Amen. Because they get spiritual amnesia. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. They take their eyes off of Amen. the prize of what Jesus done for them. uh uh uh sometimes they don't go deep enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when they go deep enough in the love of God, &gt;&gt; Amen. and understand the value of the blood. &gt;&gt; And understand that you bought with a price and you're not your own. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Understand that God has Amen. done something special in your life. &gt;&gt; The rest of the world don't know about it. &gt;&gt; They they they don't they don't know. Amen. the power of the blood. &gt;&gt; They don't know what God done for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I didn't know one day that I've been bought with a price. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I didn't know. Amen. The value of the blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what God cared about me like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I didn't know. But once I was I recognized it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some people, Amen, has taken it for faith. that they they're taking it and say, "Lord, I accept you as my savior and I accept you, oh God, and Lord, I need your spirit." And they get, Amen. They get such an overwhelming power to surge inside of them. Sometime they're broken in tears and sometimes they even go in tongues and Amen. But sometimes God says, "I want you to go a little deeper." &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to go a little farther. that that that's higher heights and there's a deeper depths of my love and I want to show you amen how much I love you. I want you to go deeper into my love because my love is deeper. Amen. I want you to love me so Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's just like a relationship. Amen. You can love that person. Amen. But you can get married and your love become greater and greater and greater. Amen. On down the road. Amen. See, when I said once you're born again, once you marry somebody, you are not looking for nobody else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Because the two have become one. And once you're born again, you and Christ become one. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you just experience the love of God. Praise God. And as you experience the love of God, it begin to get greater. And I'm saying you hadn't experienced the depths of the love. And once the love of God begin to be amen unveil unto you, the mighty God unveil, Amen. God begin to release, Amen. Amen. Show you, Amen. the value of the blood. How much you mean to you, him and how much he cares for you. You begin to say, "Lord, I love you even more. your trials and tribulations and the things that the world has offered you to say no thank you. Amen. I love him too much. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I love him too much. Amen. When you love God in such a way, it gets sweeter and sweeter as a day goes by. Amen. Sometimes I think, amen, people, amen, have experienced a certain level of the love of God, but they haven't experienced the depths of his love. Amen. And I said God wants to, amen, take you into the depths, amen, of the love of God and show you the value, Amen, that he bought you with a price, amen, and the value of that price. Praise God. And and you know, somebody said, "When I think about the goodness of Jesus and all that he's done for me, my soul cries out, hallelujah, and I thank God for saving me." &gt;&gt; See, uh, him saving you is wrapped up with bought with a price. &gt;&gt; Amen. The value of what he done for me. Praise God. The value I cannot explain the depths of his love. Amen. My eyes have not seen, ears have not heard, neither have entered into the hearts of man. Amen. What God has in store and what he's prepared for them that love him. I love him because he first loved me. And because he loved me, I said, "Lord, thank you for loving me the way that you do." Amen. Thank you for the love. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God, what about you? Praise God. Amen. Do you value the love of God? &gt;&gt; Do you thank him for loving you? &gt;&gt; Do you thank him for dying for your sin? Do you thank him for being whipped and beat and spit on and said, "God, thank you. Thank you." What a God that we serve. What a God that cared about me. Cared about me when I was sick. God cared about me when I was dying. He cares. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let us stand this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] Except God open your ears and let and cause you to understand his love. You'll miss him. You'll miss him. But as he opens your understanding to how much he cares about you and the devil don't care about you. The thief come to kill, to steal, and destroy. But he said, "I come that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly. Look and live, my brother, my sister. Look to Jesus and live." As our heads are bound, hearts are looking to him. If you've not experienced in your heart of accepted the love of God and you want to say, "God, I am the purchase of your blood. I'm the reason you died. [Music] For you died cuz you know I would be here one day. And you know, my life would be full of confusion. You know, I would be like a lost sheep in a land, a world of corruption and darkness. But somehow the shepherd cared enough about this lost sheep to come down and make known yourself to me for my sheep know my voice. I wonder this morning as our heads are bow, you didn't hear the voice of the preacher, but something in your heart says, "Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. I'm your sheep. I'm the one that went astray, but I want to I hear you calling me and I want to come home." As I had the bow, Brother Simmons, pray for me. I want to I'm the sheep that went astray. Thank you. Thank you, Lord. I want you to come into my life as our heads are bowed, hearts are looking through. Thank you, God. Come into my life. I want your love. I I need it. I want your joy, your peace. Lord, I know the world can't give it and the world can't take it away. Lord, you see the hands, the hearts are open. those that say yes to you. I'm born with a price, but I'm not born. Lord, you made me your choice. I've been chosen by you and I welcome you. Let the church say, Lord Jesus, thank you for your love. &gt;&gt; Thank you for caring about me. I am &gt;&gt; I am &gt;&gt; I'm redeemed. &gt;&gt; I'm redeemed. &gt;&gt; I'm washed. &gt;&gt; I'm &gt;&gt; in the blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; For paying such a great price &gt;&gt; for my sins. &gt;&gt; And thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
