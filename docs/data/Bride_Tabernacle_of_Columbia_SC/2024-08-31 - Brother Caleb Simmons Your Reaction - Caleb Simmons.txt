word from you and Lord we ask you touch those that are here touch those that are on their way and those that could not make it Lord move in a mighty and a special way tonight Amen in Jesus name we pray [Music] amen amen if you have your Bibles we ask that you turn to Daniel chapter 6 very familiar scripture tonight [Music] when you got it say amen amen Daniel chapter 6 and we'll start at verse three then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and the princes because an excellent Spirit was with him and the King thought and the King thought to set him over the whole realm then the presidents and the princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom but they could find none occasion nor fault for as much as he was he was faithful neither was there any error or fault found in him then said these men we shall not find any occasion against this Daniel except we find it against him concerning the law of his God and we'll skip down to verse 16 and the King commanded and they brought Daniel and cast him into the Den of Lions now the king spake and said unto Daniel thy God whom thou servest continually he he will deliver thee and the stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den and the King seal sealed it with his own signant and with the signant of his Lords that the purpose might be not might not be Chang concerning Daniel then the king went to his Palace and passed a night fasting neither were instruments of Music brought before him and his sleep went from him then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste unto the den of lions and when he came to the den he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel and the King SP spake and said to Daniel oh Daniel servant of the living of the Living God is thy God whom thou servest continually able to deliver thee from the Lions then Daniel said unto the king oh King live forever my God has sent his Angel and has shut the lion's mouth that ye that they have not hurt me for as much as before him innocency was found in me and also before thee Oh King have done no heard then was the king exceedingly glad for him and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den So Daniel was taken up out of the den and no M no man of hurt was found upon him because he believed in his God Amen God bless to reading out this word you may be seated and tonight I I'd like to speak on a little topic that the Lord been dealing with me with I I entitled it your reaction your reaction in the subtitle topic that I I had tonight I said he will bring you through amen he will bring you through and I was thinking about this and was kind of torn on where to go and where to start because so many instances where you can look and see where it was all about the reaction that you have it's all about the reaction and you see that when when they made this decree and they came against Daniel they were Daniel didn't get mad at them D Daniel didn't get upset with them and Daniel knew what they were doing Daniel knew that they were con conspiring behind his back to go against him but that didn't stop him from doing what he needed to do that didn't stop him from going forward and doing what he always did because it was life that Daniel was living that had nothing to do with them it had nothing to do with them but it's all about how you react and how you respond and sometimes God will send a test to see how you going to respond God has send that trial to see how you going to respond and that don't mean the trial is going to be easy that don't mean that the trial is going to be something that you hear today and it's gone tomorrow sometimes it takes a while for it to go that doesn't mean that that it's going to be over just like that but it's when you come to the realization that Lord no matter what you going to bring me through it changes your understanding of what you're going through it changes how you reacting to what you're going through it changes the how you even think about what you're going through cuz you said Lord I know that you're going to bring me through and I know that what you're going to do to take me through it's only going to be a blessing for me to go through this I know that when you bring me through it's going to be lessons in this trial it's going to be lessons and when I look back I can say God brought me through it I can understand it in a deeper level because I understand what God has done see Daniel wasn't afraid to go to the Lion's Den because he knew that the God that I served was going to keep keep him he was going to bring him through that Lion's then no matter how hungry the lions were they said in that time the way that they do with the Lions they would starve them they would starve them so when someone get thrown in there it would almost be instantaneous if you read in the next verse in the chapter verse 24 it said and the King commanded and they brought those men which had accused Daniel and they cast him into the Den of Lions them their children and their wives and the Lions had the Mastery of them and break all their bones in pieces orever they came to the bottom of the den before they even hit the bottom of the den the Lions broke all the bones in pieces now imagine how many people that was imagine how many lions there were and so you thinking about and they didn't it just wasn't just one bone was broken maybe they broke the last they said it broke all the bones in their body see sometimes God be protecting you from things that you don't even understand and you think that it's a trial and a tribulation and you upset you mad at what God is doing but he's doing the work and sometimes the work is what you ask God to do sometimes it's not even something that's out of the ordin and out of the realm but it was what you ask but you might not like how God is doing it you might not even understand how God is doing it but when you look back and realize that Lord no matter what is going on you're going to bring me through you start to change how you react you start to change your speech about it you start to change your story about it you start to telling people you know what through it all God is good through it all God is going to bring me through through it all I know God is real through it all I know God is the same yesterday today and forever see I understand that now if I didn't know it yesterday I know it today and say to take you through some things to prove to you that he is God Amen and it might not be what you thought it was maybe you thought it was going to be this big Grand blessing that God say here I'm going to give you this so much money to pay off all your bills or someone to give you a new car but you didn't know that God decided in your life in order to get your attention he was going to take you through a trial because God was still the same God that can bless and give trials and said it's not even your fault sometimes sometimes it's a conversation between God and the devil and the pro and I I said the prophet God I was reading and he said isn't it isn't it strange how God does things he will let us get right down to the last the last mile away you know he likes to do that he did that with the Hebrew children he knew who he could trust amen so the question is can God trust you amen amen say he knew who he could trust amen and I think about the scripture that says he'll put no more on me than than than I can bear and sometimes scriptures aren't just words sometimes they got to become a reality to youen they got to become a life to you they got to be something that's just not something that's here but it's something that's deep down in the inside that you know beyond the shout of a doubt that is real because when it becomes real to you you can live it you can speak it you can walk forth in Authority because you know that it's the truth amen something that's not true you won't believe in you won't step with authority in it if somebody said that's your car if you don't believe it you'll never walk to that car open the doors and figure out the keys is inition because you don't believe it but when you believe it you stepping in a quick haste say that's my car ain't nobody got to tell me twice but see that's how sometimes God will do a thing he'll tell you something and I I want to skip now cuz this was key and read this oh Lord and read this because it Stu it stuck out to me the prophet of God he was saying saying something yes I'll come back but but let me finish this verse and he said he said he knew who he could trust so he let them boys walk right up to the fiery furnace till they could almost smell the fire and he never moved sometimes God will let you get almost to the door almost to the fire before he ever moves and in their case he didn't move until they got in the fire amen amen sometimes you said Lord save me from this save me from this trial but what if that's what you need for it to be your testimony so that you know that God can deliver so that you know that God can save so that you know that God can heal so that you know that God can can do miraculous Works what if that's what you need am amen but yet you praying Lord save me from it amen but sometimes the only way to know is to go through it is to keep going through it amen even when it get hard you keep going through it but it's all about your reaction when you're going through it sometimes you had the wrong reaction so God let it come back around to you and said you know what you let me see if you learn this time and every time you might go through it you learn a little bit something else and a little bit something else but see God in all his wisdom and all his knowing he allows you to go through it CU he's working on you he's building that character in you so that he knows that he can trust you he knows that if I put you in this situation no matter how Bleak it is I know that you going to say Lord I I know it's all well I said something that was going on and I realized I said sometimes you got to ask God for peace amen and you don't realize it until you go through something that you realize is out of your control amen and then when you go through it long enough you realize Lord I need peace I said then you realize that all those promises was given to me and it's really when you come to that point that that you get that understanding that Lord I need you to give me what you said that you would give me Lord I need you to do the things that you said that you would do in my life Lord I need not for anybody else but I need it for myself and see God he's able to move when you have when you get the faith when you elevate your faith to the point that that God can God can meet what you said and meet what you believe and he'll do the work see God is able to do the things that you ask him to doen He's Able said the prophet of God he said we speak faith we talk of Faith but I wonder sometimes if we know what we're talking about he said I wonder if it isn't hope instead of faith and sometimes I realize we get to quoting God's word and we get to quoting but sometimes do you really have faith in it amen or are you just hoping that God does what he says cuz there's a difference he said he said Faith doesn't move when you have faith in something there's nothing that can deter you from that being true there's nothing from you believing that it's going to happen there's nothing that can stop no nobody telling you nobody discouraging you no demon from hell can stop you from believing that it's going to happen amen amen that's what faith does it don't move to the right or to the left it stays right on that rock that Revelation that you have in the deep inside of you and you can stand on it no matter what people say he said I wonder if it isn't hope instead of Faith amen so the question are you hoping or do you have faith are you hoping that you make it or do you believe that you going to make it cuz there's a difference he said no matter how contrary it look Faith stays right there it never moves see when you have faith you won't move you'll stand right firm on it amen if you believe that God has saved you from your sin nobody can ever take you convince you that God didn't save you am nobody can cuz you believe it you had faith in it and there was nothing anybody could say that could move you see that's Faith amen that's faith when you go and you do things in life sometimes you got to have faith you got to move with an understanding that God has spoke to me and this is what I'm supposed to do and when you have faith in what God has told you to do you're not worried about anything anybody else say cuz you know that's where God has placed you but are you hoping this is where God placed you or do you have faith that this is where God has me see that thing stood out to me cuz it's like you can hear the word of God but are you hoping or do you have faith amen go ahead I said but it's it's about your reaction because when you have faith to believe believe then God can do the impossible God can do what you ask him to do and he will do it he said but when real real faith is caught a vision it can keep silent and rest calmly because it knows it's going to happen amen faith will rest with perfect Assurance no matter what the storms are saying how contrary it look Faith rest with Assurance faith can take a stand upon a walk a rock look into a grave or into the waters where a lovely chunk of our lovely loving heart has been buried and faith can look across the sea the the sea to him that said I am the resurrection in the Life see that's what faith is I said do you believe that God can bring you through amen yes do you believe that God can bring you through what whatever it may be whatever you may go through do you believe that God will bring you through do you have faith in it amen do you truly have faith in it because if you do then you don't have to worry about it brother Brown was speaking later on he said and it doesn't matter what level your faith is to paraphrase it he said some of us have faith of a mustard seed just because it's a mustard seed fi don't mean it ain't going to happen amen but when you have that faith of the mustard seed you can't be moved so if you believe that God is going to do something some people have great faith so things happen faster things happen great because their faith has been built up to a level that something can happen just like that when they believe but that doesn't mean your faith is any smaller than theirs it just means that God is doing something to grow your faith said a mustard seed can grow into a great tree but when you see the seed it's very small it's very small but see there's nothing that you he said you can't mix anything with that Mustard Seed there's nothing that can be mixed with it it is what it is that doesn't change it because this comes or that comes or anything comes to mix with it it is what it is when you taste the mustard mustard you know what the mustard is it is what it is and see when you have that Faith to the level that you can believe God in such a way that nothing can take away from you you can have the right reaction amen go ahead when the test come you can have the right reaction amen cuz your reaction is Lord I believe amen amen that's why the prophet of God said the angel of the Lord he loved that song only believe amen only believe cuz he said when their faith raises to a certain level with my faith things can happen see but is your faith has to elevate there the reason why things don't happen is cuz you don't have the faith yet the reason why things don't happen is cuz you don't have the faith or when God is trying to build the faith you say Lord I don't want it when God is trying to build your faith he taking you through something you say Lord deliver me and think that's the way to get through it but sometime God got to take you through it in order to build your faith to increase your faith so that you can overcome amen he wasn't doing this for a quick fix he was doing this so that you can be a victorious in the rest of your life amen amen he was doing this he made you go through this so that you could be victorious in the rest of your life am but you say Lord deliver me I don't want to go through this well when is it time for you to go through something when is it time for you to you to actually go through something otherwise all your life you going to be saying Lord deliver me from this Lord deliver me from this and wonder why you ain't move forward in God everybody there Ain nobody in the Bible that that didn't go through something something even Jesus did so what makes you think that you higher than him he's the one that came down and went through these things just for you just for me so that he could save you he he even showed you that sometimes you got to suffer amen sometimes you got to go through anch sometimes you got to go through things he said if this cup could pass let let it pass but then he said not my will but thy will be done amen even God tested him but yet you want you don't want to go through nothing but in order for God to give you Victory you got to go through something amen come on in order for God to to deliver he got to take you through something but when you come through it you could shout you can scream you can thank God because you made it through amen you can thank God because you seen God do work in your life amen you seen God do something for you that you can't tell nobody else but you know that God is real am and see you going to need situation and things that you've been through for you to hold on to something you to hold on when times get tough and times get rough you can turn back and say God I seen you God I know that you real cuz some may try to talk you out of it cuz they don't have an experience am Jesus amen they don't have an experience with God but yet you listen you listen to ones that don't have an experience with God and think that they high because they can do these things and they're intelligent but when you meet someone with an experience with God they only going to tell you what's real they only going to tell you the truth and they not going to tell you because they want to get on you but it's because they love you am go ahead see that's what God does but you might come up to them and react the wrong way and you reacting a different way to somebody else but the one that's there trying to help you trying to help you understand that God is real and trying to get you over and be there and pray for you you reacting the wrong way to them come on but see God is trying to do something and tell you no you got to change your reaction amen sometime you got to be still and be silent and listen go amen cuz God trying to tell you something that you trying to overlook and trying to push by the side uh I don't want to hear it so you see but that's the wrong reaction cuz God may be trying to do something to get you to spare you some life headaches some life burdens and some life trials and tribulation but if you keep in your your ears [Music] stopped that face that you have where you got that bling and you do that see God see all of that God's watching you and he's watching your reactions and he's watching and seeing how you react and he's paying attention and he's looking who can I trust can I trust you can I trust you can I trust you because there's going to be a time and place and a point that you going to need God and it might be sooner than you think it might be sooner than you think that God is trying to do these things cuz it might be a short quick work but right now he's preparing you he's allowing you to go through things so that you can understand that God is doing these things it's not anything that you're doing God is taking you through these things and he's using them to prepare you he's using them to change your life he's using them so that you can come and say Lord I know that you're real for myself I'm not leaning on this person or that person Lord I know you real for myself cuz you going to need God for yourself you ain't going to be able to lean on the left for the right you got to have God for yourself you got to have your own experience with God you got to know that when I get on my knees God hears me I don't need extenuating person I don't need the pastor mom or daddy to pray I got to pray amen I got to have that relationship with God I got when I come and see God I know that he knows me and I know him it's not an unfamiliar voice amen see God knows this that's why he might take you through a thing or two so that you can I was just speaking last week and and I was saying that sometimes we look at every storm and we think it's a bad thing but some storms are good things cuz they can put things into place amen we always looking you might look at the Thunder you looking at the lightning but you can't see what the storm is doing for you see sometime God will bring test and trial and you looking at the test you looking at the trial but you ain't seeing how it's making you pray you ain't seeing how it's making you call on the Lord you ain't looking how it's making you get on your knees you ain't looking how it's making you read your Bible you ain't looking how it's making you study the word of God you ain't looking at all that all you seeing is your test in your trial but sometimes you got to look outside and say Lord thank you for the blessing amen you never thought you would say your trial was your blessing but it can be amen you never thought that what I'm going through is actually a blessing but sometimes that's the thing that get you down on your knees amen God and say you know I tried this I tried this I tried to come across the pull pit to get your attention but you didn't want to listen so now I got to send the trial to get you exactly what I've been telling you to do all along but God is able to do it and it's just a reminder that he going to bring you right on through it you just got to trust him you got to believe them you got to get down and in faith and say Lord I I I don't understand it but I know that you going to bring me through Lord I don't understand why and sometimes it's not for your understanding but it's for God to say you know what now you trust me amen now I can do greater work works now you trust me now I can do what you asked now you trust me now when I tell you to go right you going to go right and you ain't going to ask no questions when I tell you to go left you going to go left and you ain't going to ask no questions cuz now you trust me cuz you understand that it's out of your purpose and out of your plan but it's his will amen you understand that it's greater than you amen it's for him to do his good work inside of you that's for him to do and when you understand that you start looking at things different in life said whether this happened or this happened I'm not worried about it happening because Lord you got a purpose and you got a plan so whether I want it to go this way or that way that don't really matter because Lord I want you to have your perfect will in my life see I don't want to just be doing something to do cuz it's too late it's too late in the evening for us to be doing stuff that ain't got no qualms about nothing but when you get to the point to say Lord I want your will to be done Life Changes because you come to the point of Ultimate Surrender you come to the point that Lord I lay everything down Lord I give you everything and when you do that you can empty up before God and God will do some things in your life that you never thought or never even consider because that's what God wants he wants that willing vessel he wants that person to come to him and say Lord I surrender all amen Lord I give you everything even my dreams my vision and my plans the things that I thought I was going to accomplish Lord I give that to you too amen even the things that I see that I think that you leading me towards Lord I give that to you too and when you come to that place you willing and willing to say Lord whatever you ask of me I'll do amen see sometimes you might not want that because it's going to take you to some places and things that you ain't want to go it was going to take you through some things that you that you can already see that's why you trying to be like Jonah you hopping on the ship to run away because it's places and things that you don't want to face but in order for you to get to where God wants you to go you got to face face it you got to face it and you got to face it head on ain't noing to trying to Sid step it cuz you got to face that cuz God wants to do something and he got to he got to take you through it in order for him to work he got to take you through it see it's about your reaction in this trial it's about your reaction when the test comes it's about your reaction and just know that God will bring you through it he hears every prayer that you pray he hears every tear he sees every tear that you cry he here and he knows what you going through he knows it and he's able to bring you through it and always know that it's going to work together for the good for the good and see I I can't tell you that it's got to become a revelation to you it's got to be something that you believe so deep down in your heart that nobody can push you to the right or push you to the left because you believe it it's a faith thing that has matched and that scripture done become so real to you it done become like that amen and you can stand on it so firm that when others come and things come and the devil hits your mind you can still believe Lord all things work together to the good I'm not just quoting this no more and the devil can't convince me that it's not true amen amen amen the devil can't convince me that I'm just hoping maybe might be I hope it's a faith there that has elevated to a certain point and to a certain level that I know that God is real that that might be the only scripture that I may know but I'm holding on to that one amen that might be the only scripture that I heard but I'm holding on to that one amen amen and I can hold on and I tell you if you hold on to that one he going to send another one and you going to be able to hold on to that one he going to send another one you going to be able to hold next thing you know you got a whole bunch of ones that when the testing trial come you say uhuh cuz I got a revelation that God has done what he said he was going to do so if he done it before he can do it again amen and I know that he going to bring me through no matter how hard and how how perilous it may seem God will do it amen if I trust him and I believe he'll do it amen and I can stand on it and it might not be easy but can stand on it see I got faith that I can stand on it I got faith that I know God is real that I know his word is true and I can stand on it I don't care who says it's not and who says it isn't but I can stand on it cuz I can't give them a revelation that God gave to me amen I can't convince you what I know to be true cuz it might be by Revelation and some will see it and some will not but I can't convince you of it but if I know know that it's true it's because God has showed me am and see you got to have those experience for yourself because things may come that try to shake your faith things may come that try to get you to swing left or right but you know that when God is real he'll show you all thing all true he'll show it to you and you can ask him he said those that seek after after righteousness they shall be filled and see God will do the do the things that you asked him to do all you got to do is have the right reaction you got to believe that God can bring you through and he will do what he said he will [Applause] do man you appreciate the word tonight amen amen God is good amen you know I was thinking about your reaction I was thinking when brother Caleb was preaching ton night I was sitting there talking with the children last night was kind of having a little bible study went on for a little while but I I was telling them I said you know it's something about Israel and after God brought them out in such a mighty way and uh it they could have he could have brought him another way other than the Red Sea but geographically speaking but he brought him that way and and he took him through so much and it was that should have built a trust in him that God you know you can do all things I says but the thing is every time things got a little hard out there in in the wilderness every time situations got a little bit hard their reaction was we want to go back to Egypt they didn't want to go through nothing but I says after all God did for them when the thing when it seems to get a little hard that's what their reaction was but I says the thing is you know I was telling Moses last night I said you know it's something happened to me before when I when the Lord saved me and I said and from then I know that when I hear that voice I know what that voice is I says when when when this I feel that presence I know what that is I said sometimes I might think was that God or was this God I says but it's something that from the first time even until this day when I hear that voice I know without the shadow of a doubt that that's God I said and you as an individual I was talking to Moses last night cuz he was asking me you know will everybody speak in tongues and things like that and I share sharing what I think I said the biggest thing is even above the gifts of the Spirit you got to know God's voice you got to have an experience with God that from that time all of your life you'll know it when you when you hear it again and I said that's what's going to make the difference and that's what a lot of people don't never EXP experiened then when the when the hard Trials come just like our brother Kell was saying they don't know that voice they don't know that as I was praying the other day certain one thing I said Lord these these trials and these things that we're going through we look at them as being great and major I said but they small in your sight reason I said that is because God can do anything amen and everything he owns every cattle on the hill he's got all power in his hands but I said that to myself I said Lord these things are small in your sight I said what what can I do to just be pleasing in your sight at all times that was my prayer the other morning I said you know cuz cuz the thing is we forget that sometimes but I I said Lord what these things are small in your sight I said what can I do to be pleasing in in your eyes at all times that's what I want is that what you want tonight so God takes you through those things but remember those things are small and your trials just like Daniel and and he went down the Lion's then God kept them that was small in God's sight well I say small when I say small I'm looking at it that these trials and these tests if you know who God is they'll be they'll become small to you too reason being God is teaching moving us you know and changing us from glory to glory from level to level but your faith is solidified in him knowing I know the God on whom I'm serve amen I met him one day for myself and that's what's been keeping me through the ups through the downs through what you go through sometimes we bring upon ourself inflicted wounds it ain't all that is God fault sometimes we do things to ourselves but yet God will be there many of times to help get us through it but I just say tonight your reaction what is your reaction when you face with a present day tribe what is your reaction right now what is your reaction have you met God for yourself s cuz that's what it's going to take you know a personal experience and once you met that voice as I was talking with them last night in the in the home I says the thing is once you go on there you'll never be the same I said Moses had a wife and children all but when he went into that presence his whole life was changed and from that time he stepped into that presence for until his life was over over with he never could get away from that experience that he had with God and that's how God wants to meet you today God wants to be in your life that same way to where your life is changed in such a way that you'll never be the same no matter who goes back no matter who walks away no matter who says what through the ups through the Downs something happened to you one day from that time you never were the same and you'll never be the same because God has came back to redeem that part of you amen [Applause] am praise God let's stand amen we appreciate
