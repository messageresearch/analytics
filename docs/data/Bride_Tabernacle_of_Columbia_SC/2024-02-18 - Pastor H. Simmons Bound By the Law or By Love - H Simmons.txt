home Lord knowing that God spoke to them and Lord that we can be better Christians Lord father in Jesus name we thank you amen The Book of Romans 7 we thank the lord it's late in the evening the sun going down and very important that we know who we are and and our position in Christ amen you don't it's not just that we come to church that we we come to Mount Zion we come to the New Jerusalem and innumerable company of Angels the Church of the firstborn is written in heaven uh are you with me because you are here we can testify of that know ye not Brethren speak to them that know the law how that the law has dominion over man so long as he what for the woman which has a husband is bound by what Bound by law to her husband so long as he what live but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of a husband so then if why her husband liveth she be married to another man she is called a what but if her husband be dead she is free from the law so that she is no or what though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that ye should be married to another even to him that is raised from the dead that ye should bring forth fruit unto who God bless read this word you may be seated it's good Bound By The Law of our love I trust that you you're not serving God because amen it's the law and we know that law without some means of enforcement then it's not you know people don't have to respect it because it's not in force but when you got the police the Army and all of that to enforce the law and we know if we break the law then it's punishment there's a penalty that we must pay if we break the law the penalty in the Garden of Eden because God word says you may freely eat of every tree of the garden except the tree of knowledge and good and evil if you eat a that tree if you touch it the day you do that you're going to what die so the day that Adam and Eve ate of the tree of knowledge good and evil it brought death upon everyone that means all all creation had a death penalty before then nothing died there was no such thing as as they KN knew what death felt like Not only was death but the attributes of death which is sickness and pain and sorrow those attributes we never felt Adam never felt what it like to have a toothache a headache a heartache never had anything to worry about because he had eternal life there was no such thing as death there was no such thing as lust there's no such thing as you know sin as we know it in attributes of sin and all we didn't have to go through all these emotional things because didn't exist the only thing that Adam and Eve had that was different they had perfect love see because God himself is the Fountain of love Jesus expressed it if you love me keep my what Commandments are we in love with him or are we Bound by the law I was just teaching up in Tennessee the other day about Bound By The Law of love talking to marriage couples are you Bound by the law or you Bound by love thought i' just share some of those things with you because many marriages people would get out of it if they had an opportunity because they no longer in love they they fell into the lust fail they thought how how hon he is and how beautiful she is and it was a it was an emotional attraction that when they after they got married they didn't know what they were marrying or who they were marrying so it was a lot of disappointment because I didn't really know this particular individual I was more uh I was more into it because of the outside looks I didn't know what kind of person this was I never knew the person I knew she looked good I know he looked good I was I was emotionally attracted so my emotions was running away with me you know what I'm saying so I got emotionally involved and that didn't mean that I really I I love I I I like what I saw but I didn't know that it was only outside thing the beauty that's in the heart the beauty that's on the inside is what we supposed to be looking for character and not outside Beauty but we want we're so blind by the outside that we don't see the inside we when we must ask God to show us the inward side with this person the prophet was talking about invisible Union the man was buying cattle or whatever and he looked at the cow and he looked at the eyes and he wonder what what what is he doing he looking in the carow he is buying stock you know buying cows no I don't want that one on W you wonder why you don't want that one say I can look in the eyes you know she got wild eyes and those wild eyes mean she'll never make a mother are you with me so he was looking at the eyes and realized that she would never make a mother she'll run away and won't take care of her babies and all you know so you understand sometimes if you don't know how to Des discern you might be Discerning from the outside it might be looking nice and healthy but you didn't know to look into the eyes and see but he had a revelation that she had those wild eyes you better leave alone so by the grace of God um often times we got to have the spirit of discerning and the word of God is a discern of thoughts in the tense of the heart you got to see whether or not an individual love God whether that person is a true born again Christian I've seen a lot of things happen in church I've seen good people good intention and I've seen people that were looking for something on the outward appearance and missing what God had for them because they was all called up on the outside and so I see I seen people make major mistakes in their companionship because they were all about outside Beauty and never was looking for character so young people look for character not outside Beauty cuz that outside are fool you in a minute but you need somebody who respects God who got a revelation of Jesus Christ who have the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh yes beauty is vain you know it it it would deceive you the devil got caught up in how he was looking because he was Lucifer the covered Cher of him he's so beautiful you know what I'm saying but he got lifted up in his Beauty are you with me so what happens is it's difficult to be a very hon and goodlooking a very beautiful outwardly and not get lifted up and think oh how handsome I am how cute I am we spend they said that people spend billions of dollars try working on the outside and they might not spend $10 working on the inside not knowing that no matter how much you spend on the outside it ain't nothing but dirt it's going to perish but instead of spending time on the inside they spend more time on the outside Beauty how I look on the outside and they fall in love with the outside but have no idea what they Maring what's on the inside okay Bound By The Law of our love people come to church there a lot of people say I believe the message of the hour I come to church and you know I believe M 4 I do this I I believe Jesus died for my sins and all do you really understand the magnitude of what you're saying I believe Jesus died for my sin the Bible tells us we love him because he first loved us he first loved us so we love him because he first loved us but do we understand the magnitude of his love how much he cared about us to love us did he love us because of how we look did he love us because of how good we were all because of you know I'm so so beautiful I'm so you know I do I'm just perfect and God all loved me you know what I'm saying or did he love us unconditionally you know it wasn't it wasn't how good we were amen God so loved the world that he gave what only his only begotten son and you know as I was saying the devil did not know but do you know are you with me do you know the love of God do you know amen the love of God do you know what it means to have the love of God in your heart see because the Bible teaches us that the Holy Ghost is a love of God sheded abroad in our heart amen now we can have a love for our kin folks and our relatives and our friends and our neighbors for our wives and our husband our children and our family but can we have the kind of love that God had for us which we call Agape Love God's love which is not attainable about what we can do or what we did not do or what we done God saved us the Bible say while we were yet sin Christ what he died for the what ungodly he died for us when we were look like unworthy yet he still loved us uh in spite of our unworthiness he cared enough about us to die for us when we were yet sinners Christ died for the ungodly often times we tell a story and we might think it is a good time the the prophet said he said you know he goes out over the different parts of the world he says I could be unfaithful to my wife he said I could be unfaithful to her and I can go out and live with another woman come home and ask her to forgive me and he said I believe she would I believe she loved me enough to forgive me but he says I couldn't hurt her like that I love her too and see a lot of us don't have that kind of love not even for our companion if something like that happen you're gone forever God you think I am G to put up with that gone I ain't G to forget uh I never shall forget what you done to me you know what I'm saying yet we take for granted that God understand when when we are unfaithful to him and that he puts up with our unfaithfulness to him and we can go to him and say Lord forgive me here I am again you know what I'm saying but to have the type of love that God had for us and the way we should love him but we cannot love him like we ought to love him and we cannot love one another who we see like we ought to love one another except amen God gives us the Holy Ghost are you with me other than that it's a eye for an eye and a two for a two you did it to me and I'm going to what I'mma do it to you you know what I'm saying so but are we Bound by the law are we Bound by love you see love will cover a multitude of sin the love would say I forgive them because they don't understand what they're doing but law says if you did it you ought to be punished bring judgment quickly and speedily for it said touch not my know do my Propet know better for a mstone to be about your neck cast into the sea you quick to pull a trigger or the sto throw the stone stone I'm trying to say today I got trouble saying that word Stone did I say it okay you're quick to throw it but you don't want nobody to throw it back but Jesus Took the one them that was attempted to throw one and somebody said he roll on the grind he exposed them and it writing and then he asked them okay he that without sin what that's why the Bible says we ought to forgive one another for Christ what forgave us and if we can't forgive one another neither do will our what Father which is in heaven what forgive us isn't that right so but a lot of times we don't mind forgiving those that we want to forgive but some folk just a't going too far I I I you know Stephen says when he was being stoned and saw was there he said lay not this to their what charge don't charge them for that and God was able to look back and see that one Saul that was standing by consenting to step's St and one day Saul became but Saul probably couldn't never forget amen what he done to stepen so Saul wanted to he wanted to die Paul wanted to die you know I want to die for this Jesus that I've come to know amen I I want to go appear before Caesar take me to Rome I'm ready to die I don't mind being bound because why I'm Bound by love not by the law I love him so let me die for it because my love for him I saw Stephen and I saw how he loved God I want to be inspired by your love for God I want your love for God one day and and I can see your love as Christians as as a child of God your light is shining so bright that men can see amen not you but your father they can see God in you and they want that God that's in you that's what I want Bound by love and not by the law not coming to church because simply I don't want to be punished I don't want to I don't want to be burned in the Lake of Fire I don't want to go to hell I I'm not coming to church because I fear going to hell the Bible tells us there's no fear in what there's no fear in love for perfect love castes out what castes out fear for fear has tormented is of the devil a't that right so I want to come to the church because not because amen I I don't want to go to hell I want to come to church and serve God because I love him but how can I love him when I I I I I I I I haven't I I haven't seen I haven't experienced whom have not seen yet huh that you're loveing amen and and because amen because you have that kind of love how can you love God whom you're not what and hate your what brother who you see are you with me you got to you know you got to P byass all of this uh you know all of this stuff that the devil try to bring to keep you from having perfect love because perfect faith and perfect love is what's going to get us out of here in the Rapture amen a love a a faith that worketh by love amen God see your faith amen because you love amen you can pray for somebody when you love them amen when you're touched by the feeling of their infirmities you can care about them even when they don't care about themselves you can love them Des spite of all their faults and all their imperfection you still can love them amen because often times folks don't do things to you they do things to themselves and you get upset with them because of the things that they do to themselves amen but just look at them it's a because a like of the love of God in their heart the reason why they do things as much as the prophet said he wouldn't want to hurt his wife you and I ought not want to hurt our husband you know who our husband is right I espouse you to one husband even who Christ Paul said I spouse you to one husband and that's Christ and because you recognize that you love him when you you made a commitment to him let's just go to Ephesian before I close I I want you to be short because I wanted to stick and if it give you too much you might forget all this passionate type love is full of passion it it'll dingling just get married a few years some of these old Saints can tell you about that that'll go way after a year or two the Tony probably news one in here but he getting used to it you get used to one another after a while then you got to really see do I really love you know what I'm saying cuz you done got used to one another now we got this something I'm B by the law do that you know I really love this person my mama used to say you don't get to know them till you Mar then you learn to love one another over the years see you work on that thing you're working on it amen because right right now you you can you know be uh attached Mo emotionally but you got it's some things that you didn't know existed oh I didn't know you this is my that my sandwich right there your sandwich I I I cook the food but I I specifically said this my sandwich even in the little thing you know all of that makes to learn one another are you with me you're learning one another you learning What She Likes you're learning what he like and what we're doing God is taking us through the Holy Spirit teaching us and training us for the marriage supper of the Lamb he's teaching us training us amen that you know how to treat one another and you know what God wants from you so we we're coming to maturity that we can handle things no use in putting children out some people that never grow up they always need a mom and a daddy but they don't know that you give them $10,000 they we have 50 Cent tomorrow why cuz they're not matured enough to have money are you with me so God gives some people a Measure of Faith and some people dism because he knows what I give you amen you wouldn't know how to handle it that why God give this that why God bless this one that bless that why he bless me like that I don't know about this God I know he know how he know what he know how to bless and who to bless with what and how to bless with what he know that's not going to cause them to get bigheaded and think they better than everybody else walk around you know with their head up you know T no head up above everybody else you know what I'm saying the more God bless you you you just say Lord I don't know why but thank you Jesus thank you Jesus now God only bless you to be a what uhhuh now let me see who I can be a blessing too God blessed me but can I be a blessing to somebody else not bless me and you want to be selfish and holy to yourself but let's let's be Distributors God you gave it to me I want to be able to be blessing to others and the most the thing that is more valuable to be blessed with is the love of God and you want to show that love and give that love out see the Apostle says silver and gold but such as our what I give unto you can you see it's more precious than silver and gold the love of God is more precious they had that love of God and the power of God was demonstrated and they were able to take the land Man by the hand and he could walk again isn't that beautiful that you can take somebody by the hand that's really strung out on drugs they may be in terrible condition but yet you can look on them and says I such as I have I don't have money I don't have this or that but I have Jesus you can have it too it's more precious than gold am this is what you the love of God God seeing that these carnal things and this carnal outside attraction you're not emotionally attached to this world you know this this world is not our home I'm not going to let those things blind me from what's real amen I want to look into the Unseen because the real things are the things that are not seen the the things that are seen is temporal but the things that are not seen are what they are Eternal let me look to the Unseen are you with Meen and and don't be deceived amen because all that is in this world is the what lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the what pride of this life the Bible said love not love not the world neither the what in the world Amen but I want you to fall in love with God a God that concerned about you that cares about you I want you to fall in love with this God you know as I was talking to them in Tennessee amen about you know Bound by the love of God not by the law this is the grace of God upon us we are the most gracious people on the face of the Earth it's just that we walk in Grace we walk in undeserving merited love of God we walk understand that that love we did not Merit it we we couldn't do nothing to get it amen it's nothing that we done that we deserve this kind of love the grace of God Amen so we want to walk in hum knowing that God was so gracious and kind to us that he gave himself for us let us give ourselves to back to him and said Lord Lord you gave it to me and I give it back how can I give it back by the Gratitude I I distributed to we distributed one another to one another we Distributing the love that God gave us you Distributing you're showing one another kindness meekness gentleness we're showing one another longsuffering patient we are showing one another because of the fruits and the attributes of love amen it comes out of us the gentleness and the kindness and the meekness of God it comes out of that that Fountain and it's expressed amen through our character so we want to have Godly character in our Godly character we don't want to hurt anyone amen we don't want to walk as though we don't don't have faults or imperfections amen we know that amen it's only by the grace of God that we stand it's only by the grace of God that we in the house of the Lord It's Only by his grace and I'm saved amen so by God's grace I'm saved amen I don't have nothing to boast about brag about it's the grace of God the car drive the house I live in amen the money I have everything that I got God gave it to me so why can I lift my head up thank you Lord thank you for your grace my knowledge my education everything belong to Jesus God gave it to me thank you I didn't deserve it I didn't do nothing for it amen thank you Lord my health my strength amen every everything I got it was because of the grace of God Amen nothing that I've done to deserve it but it's only the grace of God that I have it are you with me well I am the Bride of Jesus Christ and I am a child of God come on will you want to belittle others think you better than others well I ain't no chicken I'm a eagle but you're not an eagle because it's something mared of your you you're not the bride because you know something that you've done it's by election and by the grace of God you are are you with me so don't don't don't be boasting like you somebody special that you deserve God's grace and they don't God gives them an opportunity to receive the same Grace that you have they just turned it down the kind of love that God G gave us he's giving it to each and every individual some don't want it some wanted it can't get it I can't have it some want this kind of love the love that I can be faithful to God and I can live for God some want that kind of love but it's just some that would uh lay on their face and seek God for the Holy Ghost and the power of God in their life they they they they want that faith that I don't want to sin against you Lord I don't want to do the wrong thing I don't want to live I don't want to misrepresent you I don't want people to look at me and say that's supposed to be a Christian and then and and they're not living a life I want people to see Jesus I want them to see the love of God I want them to see that I love him them to be aspired not that you know I'm just a church go and I'm just a message Bel but I love God I love him not trying to uh prove it to anybody love is a mystery love is a mystery
