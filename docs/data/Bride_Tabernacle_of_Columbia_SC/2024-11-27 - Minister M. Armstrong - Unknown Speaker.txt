service a hand clap of Praise amen man it's definitely a blessing to be here on tonight amen on this Tuesday night bible study no better place to be than in the house of God right man let's give God a hand clap of Praise this is Thanksgiving week you know this is just not a time to give God thanks we should give God thanks every day amen not just for the turkey we we going to eat on Thursday amen hey man I'm not going to stand before you long I want to go straight into the word here we start at uh 2 Corinthians chapter 12 amen I appreciate the church family those who were able to come out tonight and show up amen think I see a few of them out there amen amen appreciate Pastor Simmons he was back there in the in the back just filling me up with some good old wisdom I need to spend a whole day with him amen I really appreciate him and God using him I was telling him he's a he's a pillar in in the message man and I I have a lot of respect for him and his ministry and what he's the vision that God has given him for his people amen man second Corinthians chapter 12 we start at verse one very familiar text um we've all seen heard before whether that be in Sunday school whether that be on Sunday morning Wednesday night but it is one that is still very impactful today so we'll start at verse one it says it is it is not expedient for me doubtless to Glory I would come to visions and revelation ations of the Lord verse two I knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago whether in the body I cannot tell or whether they out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth such and one caught up to the third heaven verse three and I knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth Paul is completely clueless as to what's going on he's been to a place and he can't even talk about what he's seen okay verse four says how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable Words which is not lawful for for a man to utter verse 5 of such an one will I Glory yet of myself I would not Glory but in mine what infirmities verse six for though I would desire to Glory I shall not be a what fool for I would say the truth but now I forbear lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me and this is where I want to get my text from tonight and L I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was giving to me a thorn in the flesh now the key word that you got to take for your Victory is given it was given to me now you may ask who was it given to we going to talk about that on tonight amen so my topic tonight church is a thorn in the flesh let us bow Heavenly Father God lord we ask you tonight Lord to come down and move me out of the way that you may have your way and that you may speak a word Lord to encourage your people on tonight Lord we thank you for this opportunity Lord we do not take it for granted and treat it as a checking the box type of service Lord you have given us this opportunity you've woken us up this morning Lord to get better to do better to draw closer to you Lord and for that we thank you so Lord as I as I move myself out of the way oh God I ask you share a word for your people on tonight we ask these things in your name we pray amen amen amen so I won't be I me before you long I want to just kind of share a quick thought here and get out of get out your way um like I said very familiar text here a thorn in the flesh and to kind of give you some context of what is what Paul is talking about if you study the the book of Corinthians first uh Corinthians and 2 Corinthians the leaders of the Church of Corinth uh have been launching attacks on Paul's Ministry um with their goal is to uh uh undermine his I guess Apostolic Authority in the church um but Paul in second Corinthians he he's he he he's defending himself if you go back and start reading through it he's in a place to where he's trying to defend why God chose him why he's the you know the messenger for that day so he's he's in this chapter here and he makes his biggest argument in chapter 12 what we just read um these people they were coming against Paul they were boasting about their accomplishment ments and their Revelations and they claimed that Paul uh wasn't the real deal because he didn't have anything to boast about they were saying that he had they had all these dreams and Paul didn't have what they had but Paul was not an advocate of boasting if you go back and he says that in verse one uh but he breaks down uh now we know who Paul is today right we know God showed him a lot of things he was the first Messenger to the uh the Ephesian Church age but Paul here in chapter 12 does not go and explain all these visions that God has given him he doesn't go into detail he spends his time in chapter 12 explaining why he can't go into these visions and what God did to ensure that he didn't and this chapter stamps his approval with the Corinthian Church of who he is it wasn't him revealing this is what I know look what God showed me it was he was doing the opposite I can't show you these things God won't allow me and this is why that's right so if we go back to verse 7 here and lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the Greek word for thorn is scallops it is a a a sharp steak or splinter something pointed that can cause discomfort or pain that is driving you crazy come on now you think about a thorn you know the the rose is uh titled the most beautiful flower in the world but here's the thing about this most beautiful flower in the world you don't get the rose without the Thorns you cannot enjoy the fragrance of God's blessings his Joy his peace his understanding uh uh without getting pricked sometimes Times by The Thorns you may be thinking right now what are some thorns in my life I know every time I go back to the scripture I think about things in my life that I've been praying for God to take away and you get discouraged and say why is it still there I've been praying night after night to take this person this place this thing out of my life [Laughter] physical mental emotional doesn't matter what it is every believer will experience getting pricked oh yeah something that is agitating you the St you ever had a splinter in your hand it aggravates you you try to get it out you try needle nose you try to get a pen it is bothering you but you can't get it out so it's stuck there so Paul is going to tell them I got these Revelations but I can't reveal them and here is why I can't reveal them and here is how God is keeping me from revealing them to you yeah so what was this thorn of the Flesh in verse 7 there's a whole lot of different Scholars who went back and forth about what this particular thorn of the flesh was was Paul okay uh in Acts n some have said that this this Thorn was the bright light when he was on his way to Damascus you know he he he he was blinded others said he had glaucoma other was said that he had some type of physical infirmity the prophet of God even said that uh it was a disease um that Paul wanted to get healing for but he would get healed for a season and it would come back so they were going back somebody even said that it was Paul's wife that was the thorn just a bunch of different uh viewpoints and and and perspectives of what the thorn was now I I don't think it really matters what the thorn was I think God In His Infinite Wisdom intentionally made Paul not to give specifics of what that thorn was because I can go straight to this scripture and I can identify with it and I think we all can there are thorns in our life things in our life that we want to take away and sometimes we get distracted we don't we lose focus of why it's there sometimes we can get too caught on specifics I need to specific I need the Bible to tell me specifically what I'm supposed to do in this situation I need to know specifically how long my dress should be it should tell me specifically how this should be that should be if you needed specifics you wouldn't need the Holy Spirit to lead and guide you some things you got to seek God for that's what's wrong with things today people oh he said this this place and that that place that's wrong you need to let God the holy you got to have space to where you don't have the answer because in order for the Holy Spirit to lead you you can't know where you going Lord I need to know exactly from point A to point B what this entails what that entails that robs you of your experience you ever been with somebody who uh you watching a movie or reading a book and they trying to tell you what's happening next what's happening next you get upset not because what they're saying but they're robbing you of the experience and sometimes we want God to just tell us everything God said why would I do that and Rob you of my experience I want you to experience not knowing so when I show up you'll know it's me I'm not going to rob you of the experience because I need you to grow closer to me if I give you all the answers that's not an experience so I ain't going to rob you of that Lord I need to know why sir if I told you why you won't draw closer to me thank you Lord so the Greek word here for scallops is a sharp steak or splinter something pointed that can cause discomfort or pain something that is driving you crazy so all we need to know about a thorn in the flesh is that it don't feel good it hurts it's aggravating it gets on your nerves think about in your life right now people person place or thing that you've been praying and I know we all got them and if you don't got them you will get them that person that you can't stand but you can't get rid of because God is trying to teach you maybe brotherly kindness maybe God is trying to teach you Temperance you know it it it's funny because the world today the natural we're taught that as long as you do everything right right you pay your bills your lights stay on right you you you pay your bills on time your credit score goes up you keep gas in your car you can keep driving you keep the maintenance up so we're we're trained and Infused that as long as I do everything I'm supposed to good things is supposed to happen to me but that promise ain't in the Bible in this life you shall that's right brother Caleb he talked about that that peace I was telling brother Ernest this I think one of the reasons why the disciples were was so floored when that storm came is when Jesus told them get on the boat they did exactly what he told them to do in the will of God right dab smack in the me we did what you said Lord so we got to be good but when that storm hit they were confused Lord how is this happening I'm in your wheel you told us to get on the boat we right here why this storm is here it causes you to get confused and blindsided when you read the Scripture it says in this world you shall have tribulation what is tribulation Thorns Thorns Thorns pressure Affliction distress he says but be of ker because I dealt with the Thorns [Applause] too nobody is exempt you can be serving God with every ounce of your being 120% coming to church praying and reading your Bible and when the storms come who that's right why do you pay your insurance premiums it's not to stop the accidents it's when the accidents come you have coverage that's why you pay your premiums you can't stop the accidents but Lord if something happens to me I know I'm without a shadow of a doubt that you're covering me that's why I come to church that's why I pray and read my Bible that's why I keep pressing cuz when something comes up when that storm comes I need you to be my [Applause] shelter same logic the insurance company can't stop the accidents but if I getting one you better be ready to pay up nobody's exempt that's why first Peter tells us don't be shocked yeah when these fiery Trials come upon you don't think it as something strange it's part of the program amen amen so we can go back there 2 Corinthians 12:7 it says unless I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations that was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me now there is a victory In this passage of scripture because in order to overcome you have to understand where the root of the problem is coming from Paul identifies it was a thorn and the devil was doing it it was a physical pain but Paul understood that the root of the problem or the equation it was spiritual see a lot of times we we lose track and see if you understand that go the church that this we not any a carnal battle the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal but they are what Mighty through God through the tearing down a stronghold so as long as you understand that people are not your problem amen you'll treat them different amen you won't talk to them like they the devil you'll realize it is Satan using them for we wrestle not against flesh and blood people ain't your problem that boss on your job he ain't your problem when you come to work and you're in a good mood and somebody just gets on your nerves take a minute and say that ain't nothing but the devil lord let take a minute and pray about this but you go to them like they the problem you'll find yourself out of the will of God now you got to repent right so Paul realizes that this problem the root of it was not spiritual so we have to understand when we when we're going against the enemy we have to address the root not the fruit you don't kill an apple tree by taking all the apples off the tree oh the tree is dead guess what going to happen next season them apples going to come right back you got to get to the root of the problem so when you're dealing with life situations figure out Lord where is this coming from amen is this you is it Satan take a few steps like a doctor you've been taking Tylenol for five years for a headache it's the bigger problem that talk to Dr Jesus he'll tell you what the problem is amen so we understand that Paul here has identify where it's coming from and he says lest I should be exal aled above measure through the abundance of Revelations that was given to me we talked about that earlier given to me a thorn of the flesh now who gave Paul this Thorn it wasn't the devil cuz he says lest I should be exalted above measure now you would think Satan will probably want him to be messed up in the will of God right cuz he understands all satan knows is that Pride goeth Before Destruction and a heart of spirit before fault so Satan in this situation was given permission to place and whatever the thorn was to come and attack Paul so this Thorn was given by God and he used Satan to do it but here's the thing the devil can be giving all he got but the whole time God is still in control working hard to take you out don't realize God is just moving and controlling the pieces thinkk he got you oh yeah Prophet God says this he says in the message possessing the enemy Gates he permits all these things and turns the devil loose to tempt you and he'll do all but take your life he could throw you on a bed of Affliction he could turn your neighbors against you he could turn the church against you he can do most anything and it's God's will for him to do it now that's tough to digest you got God using bad for good I find myself come on and I do this a lot that ain't nothing but the devil that's right giving the devil credit where he don't have any see when you in the will of God the devil don't have no power to do anything now if you out there I think it's first Peter says when you're out there H H uh murdering and and stealing and you a thief don't suffer as those do if you going to suffer suffer for Christ because when you're in his will you're what protected the prophet of God taught us that as long as you're in the will of God there's no safer place that you can be amen so we have to stop giving Satan credit for stuff that he ain't got nothing to do with that ain't nothing but the devil the devil messed with job the devil came with God gave permission for the devil to come and and attack job and I thought about this when the man came and told job you've lost everything he didn't say oh that ain't nothing but the devil that ain't nothing but the devil he got on his knees and says the lord giveth he knew as long as Lord I'm in your will you've got to be in control of this situation brother that's your Victory that's where you stand on now when you outside of the will of God God bless you I'll be praying for you but as long as you slap that that's why the disciples lost track of that they did did exactly what Jesus said he says take me on the boat I want to get on the other side they should have stood on that y Lord we in your will you told us to do this and we're doing it so we ain't got nothing to worry about but they lost track because sometimes we can get to a place as we're doing everything right that everything is going to be all right we're not going to come across trials we're not going to deal with things we don't understand when it's not the promise the promise is is I can help you overcome the promise is I'll be with you the promise is that you're Victorious amen amen amen so when things are out of control God is still in control amen amen it's tough to swallow but that's the truth anyhow amen amen so it it says here that he he desired um Paul desires to take this thing The Thorn away if we can pull that back up amen it says verse 7 and lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above the heavens amen so what are the reasons uh God places these thorns in our life if you look at a rose uh the reason rose thorns are placed on roses is for protection that's right protection from who in this situation God was protecting Paul from himself we all know that that's can be our biggest enemy sometimes mother brandom said that the greatest enemy our God is William brandham he is the one that gets in God's way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it and when he does that shoves God right out the picture oh yeah amen here's Paul one that was on the road to Damascus the first Messenger to the Ephesian Church age wrote 50% of the New Testament went to the third heavens and God still couldn't trust them with himself all God was going to do for Paul had done through Paul God still could not trust Paul with himself so if you get to a point to where you think you got it I'm in control that's room for Satan to come in and operate amen amen that's right so we think about the thorns in our life it is it is something that I I'm I'm I'm everybody struggles with it we all have thorns things in our life that we want God to take away but when you come to the realization that if you in his and that's not saying we going to fall short but when your desire is to get up and make it right that's in the will of God this Paul escorted to the third Heavens he's seen things that he can't even utter so a Paul either had a problem of Pride or he had the potential for Pride why cuz he says lest I be exalted above measure so here's God being reactive and proactive he placed this Thorn to either correct a sin in Paul's life or the potential for a sin why to protect Paul from himself right because Paul God had a greater work for Paul up ahead God saw that Paul was the only one on Earth that had been to the third Heavens he saw things God just wasn't focused on that he was looking ahead yeah amen you look at Jo um Joseph Joseph uh uh multiple times throughout his life Thorn after Thorn he's in Piper's house but he had no idea what was ahead of him but God knew so God is organizing all these situations in Joseph's life for preparation for one moment and God knew that brother Randon would preach exactly what Paul preached so he says Paul I don't want you to mess this up because my will is more important than what you want that's tough to swallow because sometimes our will uh we sang that song I'm I'm I'm uh the evidence of goodness running after me our good ain't always God's definition of good am so if we go back to verse 7 here lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above uh measure so God placed this this thorn in Paul's life so when when he was tempted to exalt himself it would bring him back down to earth now here is the good part we've talked about the Thorns the pain but here's Paul's Victory verse 8 now what should we do brother maias should we just deal with these Thorns should we just be okay with them here's what Paul said not just as Paul the man of prayer says pray without sissing he says for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart Me Lord I need you to get this out my life this person place a thing it is driving me crazy here's God's response and he said unto me now if you're reading this in your Bible this next passage is red letter so God's answer wasn't yes but Paul did get a response he says unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in what weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glorify in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me amen Lord I come before you right now this this brother this man this person plac her thing I need you to take it away you said in your word that if I ask anything in your name that's usually our prayer sometimes Lord I need it gone it's uncomfortable I don't want to be going through this I've made that prayer most my probably about 90% of the time when I'm coming for prayer Lord I need you to fix something I need you to move something I need you to change something right Paul says three times so how long should you pray until he got an answer and he said to me see we've got to give God the freedom to give us an answer and it has to be the freedom to give him the answer that he wants to give see when you come to God and your answer is you want it to be yes you'll tune out the nose you cut you you put the earbuds in because the nose are are glaring right it's there but no that can't be you Lord that can't be you cuz I want you to say yes but Paul says and he said to me not yes not no but my grace is sufficient for thee I'm all you need I'm not going to take the thorn away it's going to stay there because you know why Paul for my strength is made perfect and weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glorify in my infirmities he got a response but it wasn't the answer he was looking for I want to go to a passage of scripture here just came up uh when I was in the back Genesis chter 20 see sometimes you know I I see why now the scripture says your righteousness is as filthy rags because sometimes we can think as long as we're doing the right thing acting the right way that that gives us to power to to not do things like the world does let me let me let's go to it's a very familiar passage of scripture Genesis 20 we start at verse um verse one uh this is a very familiar passage it is uh the story of Abraham and ailec AMC is a was the king of eev I believe back then and we don't have to go through the whole passage but just to kind of give you some context so ailec was the king and Sarah and Abraham comes and Abraham tells Sarah to lie and says I'm your sister um so we familiar with the story right all right so let's go down to um uh verse 6 this is God coming to ailec and God said unto him in they dream yeah I know that thou didst in the Integrity of thy heart for I also withheld from thee sinning let's go up to um verse three let's go to verse three it says verse three but God came to ailec in a Dream by night and said to him behold Thou Art but a dead man can you imagine in your sleep you wake up and God telling you you're a dead man okay he says Thou Art a dead man for the woman which thou Hast taken for she is a man's wife here's A's response but AMC had not come near her and he said Lord with thou slay also a righteous man Lord I ain't do nothing I didn't touch her I didn't mess with the Lord so will you slay a righteous man said he not unto me she is my sister and she even herself he is my brother in the Integrity of my heart and the innocency of my hands I have done this now here's something I never caught before In this passage of scripture he says and God said unto him in a dream yay I know that thou didn't do this in the Integrity of thy heart but catch this I also withheld thee from sinning against me let me be clear AMC the only reason you didn't touch her was because I ca you not to had nothing to do with you because I have a greater plan for Abraham and Sarah and I will not allow you to mess that up amen that's why we can't boast in our own goodness no matter how good you are it is God's grace that's keeping you you can be in the situation you be like man I I I want to do this I want to do that but something on the inside God has a greater plan and he says no not today that's why we are sinners saved by grace amen amen God's mercy kept him from doing that he says AB like you that that wasn't you you had nothing to do with that that was me causing you not to do that we all are sinners saved we a't that's why Works can't get you saved Works can't keep you God has to keep you and as long as you understand God's grace is sufficient for you that's all you need church amen God has to protect us from ourselves sometimes so he says my grace is sufficient for thee translation God please take this Thorn away and the answer was no I'm not going to take away your Thorn but I'm going to give you something to handle it how many times have God said no in our lives he told Jesus no In The Garden of Gethsemane Lord take this cup from me no but here's Jesus response Lord let not my will but let thy will be done if it's not his will we have to kind of be under the expectation Lord if I'm coming to you for something if it's not your will we have to be okay with the nose if it's not his timing we have to be okay with not yet if we're not ready we have to be okay with that because what happens is we're trying to manifest things and we get outside of the will of God Amen Paul's prayer was I'm tired of it God take it away and God's response was my grace is sufficient for thee verse 8 2 Corinthians nine says and God is able to make all grace abound toward you that ye always having all sufficiency in all things make abound to every good work now here is what should I be doing in my season of thorns verse 10 we go back to verse 9 and 2 Corinthians 12 he says and he said to me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore with I rather glorify so Paul is saying I have a choice to complain to make excuses or I can let the joy of the Lord be my strength those are your two options he says most gladly therefore will I rather glorify in my infirmities that the power check the order there so when I glorify in my infirmities then God's power starts to work his power starts to rest on me when I'm going through my Thorns and I say Lord I thank you anyway God's power begins to rest upon me amen therefore I take pleasure in my infirmities in reproaches in Necessities in persecutions and distresses for whose sake Christ for when I am weak then I am strong amen so when I'm going through my stuff and I don't have the answers when I begin to praise God in the midst of it amen amen he's made strong amen so there's an order there that's just not saying Lord I'm going to deal with the thorns and sit here and just wait he's saying most gladly therefore I'm going to glory in my infirmities fat the power of Christ fat the power of Christ those two go together when you glorify in your infirmities God's power that's why he says uh uh he shall renew your strength you shall M up on wings as Eagles when you start to glorify God in the midst of it that's where your power comes amen so my strength is made perfect in weakness so I'm going to use the devil Paul to make you weaker so you can see my power amen and that's the thing God would never be more real to us then when you have something in your life you can't fix that's when he wants to show up and show out sir so what am I supposed to do we just talked about it we've got to understand that God's praise gives us the victory over the enemy amen let's get Lord hand clap of praise cuz this unnatural right it's unnatural to jump and Shout around when you're still sick in your body when you going through things but Paul is telling you that's what you have to do amen that's how you get the victory amen so another reason God uses thorns in our life is for our development you know if you go to the hospital and you're dehydrated uh and they say hey we got to give you some uh we got to give you an IV you dehydrated Mr Armstrong and we've got to rejuvenate your uh your dehydration you can say no I don't want that needle in my arm because it hurts but most people would say yes why because you know in the pain of that needle is your Restoration in the pain of that needle is your strength so yes stick me doctor I'll endure the pain because I know at the end of the day when I walk out of here I'll be back to 100% so the Thorns that are placed in our life God sometimes uses it to develop us it's like a jean seed that's on the inside of us God wants us to grow so a lot of times he put thorns in our life to develop that growth I want to go to a passage of scripture here um let's go to Job chapter 42 everybody good amen amen when a child is born and the seed is planted all that that child will ever be is inside of that seed the only thing that prevents us me you everybody else from seeing it is one word and that's development so here is Job chapter 42 uh we all know the the story of job but we typically only care about like two main pieces that's the beginning and the end he lost everything and God gave it all back but there's a lot in the Book of Job so job finds himself uh where he he's I would say uh confused about this thorn in his life he's confused about Lord why is this there what's going on I know I've been dealing with for this for too long but come on now I need an answer help me understand so he's questioning God and God takes him on a journey uh he takes him to the cosmos and tells him job did you do this job were you here when I did that job's response is no I wasn't and then he finds himself in job the last chapter here 42 this is the development then job answered the Lord and said after he gets through all of this job answered the Lord and said I know that thou can't do everything now cat now you got to in order to cat the revelation of this you have to figure out where job started he had everything righteous man then God said that about him but he finds himself in this situation after he has lost everything to job answered the Lord and said I know that thou can't do everything you didn't know that before job and that no thought can be withholden from thee who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore have I uttered that I understood not things too wonderful for me which I knew not so hold a minute the victory of job was just not about him getting his stuff back uhhuh it was about this point right here job I want you to know that there is more to me than you realized which I knew not job said Lord I didn't know all this about you I didn't know that this and that he says your plans cannot be thwarted who is that that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore I have uttered that I understood not things too wonderful which I knew not so you want to say Lord why am I going through this situation in my life God is saying I want you to draw closer to me there is see when everything's going right everything's going good God still wants you to draw closer he still wants you to be as the deer panted for the water brick so does my soul thirst for thee Oh God he still wants that connection so it took him taking everything from job for job to get to this point Lord there's more to you than I realized when he got to this point then the restoration happened all of that happened for job he had to lose everything to realize Lord I didn't have everything when I had everything sometimes these Thorns these things in our life that God places it is because yeah you're doing good yeah you're going to church and I love you for that but I need you to draw just a little bit closer I need you to love me a little bit more not saying you're doing anything wrong I love you keep coming to church church but there is more to me than you realize amen so whatever I got to do to get you to that point yeah amen as the prophet of God said he allowed the devil to go loose and he says he'll put bits in Satan's mouth and he'll control it controlling every aspect he can't take you out but God's objective is to use that so you can get to this point to say Lord there is more love that I know about there is more Grace that I knew about there is more joy that I knew about more peace in this understanding Lord that I don't know why I'm going through this but realizing you're the one who's keeping me you're the one who kept [Applause] me I didn't know that about you God Lord I Thank you for the Thorns amen amen there is more to you than I realized and as I look through my life when I go to this passage of scripture and I go through situ cuz like I said before when we walk outside those doors if you've never experienced a thorn in your life something that is stuck there that God placed there and he won't move you will as long as you keep drawing closer to God there will be things that God will place in your life to protect you to keep you because he has a plan for everybody in this church and there's nothing you can do Satan can do can change that so what whatever God has to do he'll put precautionary methods in place to protect you from yourself but he also has a hedge of protection around you Satan can't do nothing without his permission so as long as you in the will of God church that is your protection look that so so we we've got to keep pressing towards the mark because as long as you're pressing that's your protection so when things come up in your life you can say Lord I know this is you because I've been serving you I've been doing everything I can Lord yes I fall short but I come to church the next day and I say Lord I'm sorry amen amen that's your strength that is Paul Paul said he said to me and that's all Paul needed I don't need nothing El as long as you give me an answer am he said to me directly that's a RMA word directly to me amen as musicians come let's give a little hand clap of Praise so my prayer as I continue down this path that I'm in this chapter that I in said Lord when I go through things in my life Lord help me to see you in it amen amen help me not to lose focus of you in this situation In This Storm amen as a song writer says Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord I want to see you let's sing a little bit of that

as we sing holy holy holy holy amen appreciate the Lord tonight get a lot of hands PR amen God is good amen thorn in our flesh amen you know I was thinking as he was uh ministering tonight and sometimes we want things to leave but you know I always been saying here for the last longest now I says I'm just going to start accepting what the will of God is it' be hard sometime especially early in the Christian Journey but I said one thing about it our goal is to make Heaven our home amen you know I was talking to the church down other week and I was riding down there I said as I was riding down there I was thinking it'll be December in a couple of weeks this whole year just flew past amen and I says that time is going so fast but I says that's why we living this life so we can get to that new kingdom and so I said from now on you know I was I was going to do a whole sermon on variation and what it does to the body naturally and spiritually so I was praying about it praying one day and that came to me I said you know I ain't worrying no more I said God if it's your will things might catch you by surprise but I said just if I can just shake myself like Samson did I said God if it's your will that's what I'm that's what I'm going with because I know one thing God can't fail and everything he does is right it might look wrong it might look like why but everything God does is right he can't fail right and I I saying you know one thing about it things sometimes in life happen and we say how in the world good going to come out of it but I know one thing God can't break not one of his promises not one his words will ever fall to the ground and the Bible says that all things work together to the good of them that love the Lord am so one one thing I'm holding on to amen right now is the word of God Amen I'm learning to hold on to that now with all I got yes sir because that's the only thing that that's faithful in all things that's the only only thing that's going to be standing in the end is the word of God I say a lot of times that's all I got right because I've been failed on every hand come on I don't know about you but I've been failed on every hand come on but it's one that never felt me from the beginning when he started leading and guiding me he always been there he never failed me and never will I don't believe he ever will because he's God Amen So I says when you oh that thorn that's in your flesh like Paul says God Jesus told him my grace is sufficient for you he says so I glory in my infirmities right that the power of God might rest on me come on God is saving you from yourself amen amen amen praise God just appreciate the word tonight amen thanin God good amen hallelujah let us just bow our heads for a moment father in the precious name of
