something i shared now in the marlins last night and hoping that it'd be a blessing for y'all tonight amen it says if there'll be therefore any consolation in christ if any conflict of love with any fellowship of the spirit if any vows and mercy fulfill ye my joy that ye be like mine that having the same love being the one accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vain glory but in the loneliness of mind let each what let each esteem what let's read that again in loneliness of mine let what look like every man on his own thing but every man also on the things of others let what amen god bless the reason towards you may be seated i want you to think about it let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus we're still dealing with for the last few weeks is humbly humble yourselves humble yourselves amen so it's very important that we humble ourselves and and i said every time i minister just about the lesson it's room for improvement in me and i trust that we'll see room for improvement in each and every one of our lives that we can be more humble amen and god will give us more grace to be more humble amen so we're living in in a day that we're looking for god will be looking for rapture material and looking for a people that are ready for rapture and if we're a raptured material then it takes people that's going to be humble for god resistance to proud but he gives grace to the humble amen and to be humble is is very important that we arm ourselves with humility because without uh if we don't harm ourselves with humility then pride was going to take over our lives are you with me so it's very important um it's something i want to find and just keep on coming to my spirit so i got to try to find it let me try to find it amen god is good somebody get your read from me brother ernie to somebody okay let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus you got that philippians 2 next verse but made of himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient the bible says he thought it not robbery you know i when as i was looking at the lesson and even today i looked at look who god is and maybe i was talking to renee or somebody i'd say look who god is how great he is god almighty the creator of heaven and earth the bible said he thought it not robert eureka with god but the bible said that he was god in the beginning was the word the words with god and the word was god he said without controversy great is the mystery of god and his god was manifested in the flesh he was a god with all that great power you know as jesus when he tried to take him he said he had power to call 12 legion of the angels you didn't need 12 leads you know he needed was one are you with me but all that power he had but look what he did he humbled himself you give give lord have mercy i'll be scared if you give some folk a little bit of power lord have mercy look what they do with the little that they think they have now so i must examine myself am i you know how do i get god's power to be manifested in my life you know as we read about you know as the prophet god was talking about the real power he says conquer yourself and submit yourself to christ to humble yourself before him that's really power are you with me you know you got to resist yourself conquer yourself if you want the real power of god amen but people you know they look you know unless we see room for for improvement unless we really uh examine ourselves and look at ourselves we really say lord i i i'm a failure i fail all the time and i need you i need your grace and mercy to help me help me to humble myself i didn't ask him to humble me i asked him to help me amen that i might humble myself are you with me but you know most people amen don't want help because they're already humble there's no room for improvement you know but as as i look at jesus who thought that not robbery to be equal with god who was god and the power who he was and who he is and yet he he he humbled himself to what helping himself pick it back up we go see when you humble you're obedient are you with me when you're humble you're obedient when you find folks that won't be obedient when you find a child that's not obedient you don't find a humble child are you with me you cannot if a child is not obedient that child is not humble are you with me you don't have a problem with the humble child your problems come in with a rebellious child he told saul saul he said who is thy lord he said he said i'm jesus it is hard for deed to what kick against the priest paul what had too much pride in him his own ability and his authority and who he was he had self-confidence but god had to the light had to shine he fell to the earth and he realized that that light that that one that caused him to fall to the ground that was god and he said who are you lord the lord said i'm jesus you know sometimes we think that as individuals sometimes we think that it's one another that we'll persecute i i'm saying take for example you know god he was showing me in these lessons he said you know a lot of times you know if you're not if you stay humble because sometimes you can be kicking against debris you know and you know it's not i'm not talking about you i'm talking about what i'm learning through these lessons that i have to be humble amen and then god can show us something god will show us what he wants us to see and what he wants us to know if we're humble amen it's a it's another thing that i'm i want read but a little bit i need another reader we got that two readers okay caleb you must read too y'all ain't got no money you don't have a mic you gotta have one how they gonna hear you on the air y'all here but you're also talking to another audience okay you're talking to two audience and when y'all hear clear i don't know whether they hear and not because i want god knows god knows that too i'm not gonna try to explain he said okay the prophet god says show me a church that's humble real humble not an arrogant church you know and some of y'all know you got children that you got to explain to them what you you you tell them something and they giving you word for word and back you know it's something wrong you know that child gonna have a troubled life that child gonna suffer some stuff if you you said something to him you know back in the old days you get slapped down quick right you may not be humble but you should you know you're not going to get word for word and and because a lack of humility and see when we don't have respect for those that are in authority then we'll never humble ourselves you know when you come before the church you say oh judge genre because you know he's got authority you got to respect his office are you with me and as parents children should respect their parents office if they're in the lord are you with me and trying to tell you the right things are you with me then you need to humble yourself because if you don't you're headed for a lot of trouble are you with me and when troubles start coming your way lord have mercy you don't want it are you so it takes humility you need to uh know that if i be humble you know my mom used to say you never get too whole i'm still your mama you know what my brother's or someone acting up and she might get the broom boom you're never too old are you with me or whatever she can find and she gonna you know you're gonna get straight now you're not gonna disrespect mama at no time are you with me and you're not gonna disrespect daddy in no time so those are the things that we got to learn how to conduct our lives in humility humility amen is respecting one another are you with me now anytime you have to demand respect then you're in trouble when you demand respect then a christian attitude i'm not god don't demand you to obey him he wants you to understand who he is and how much he loves you and all that he's done for you see because your parents they take care of you they took care of you when you couldn't take care of yourself you see what i'm saying to disrespect them is to say i don't care what you did for me are you with me you always give them respect are you with me now if you can give your natural parents then you also have those that watch over you as spiritual leaders then you have to respect them even if you don't want to and if you were to disrespect them you disrespected the word he said obey them that have rule over you for they what watch for your soul you say well nobody watching for my soul but they do and that's why it's a very serious thing i i was telling one group that i was working with i says i have to get to know y'all because i got to give a count for y'all if i stand in this position i have to give account to god so if i don't know and something like somebody have to die and pass away and i'm up there saying oh they'd have made it all you made the way about i don't even know your name see what i'm saying so i'm not telling a lie i got to stand before god and give an answer to god for what i say are you with me now i can say well i believe and i think that's all we can do believe it too because that's even on the best the most faithful child of god only thing you can do is to believe by the grace of god that they made it you know and and and you want to believe that with your heart and you got a joy and a peace about it but when you ain't got that peace you know god knows whether or not you got that peace about whether you give an account for this soul you need to help and you want to do it willingly and you want to do it with peace amen so it's a very difficult task that a a pastor has because he and and that's why my bishop used to always say i don't want nobody blood on my hand he said that's why i'm telling y'all the truth because the blood would be on my hand if i didn't tell you the truth and i'm gonna tell you something as parents the blood will be on your hand if you don't really if you don't raise these children right just as the blood on the path to hand the blood don't be on your hand and you look at that child and you say well you know the same word that i preach insane bible that you read amen it tells you what your responsibilities are and how you ought to conduct yourself as a parent are you with me it tells me how to i should conduct myself as a parent and as a pastor are you a friend now if i conduct myself otherwise then i got somebody that's over me are you with me and that's god are you with me the same way in the house amen it's got a the husband is the head of the wife and the children are subject to their parents are you with me so that's a now we disrespect and we just we disrespect that order we're disrespecting not the person you're disrespecting god's word and you're going to be accountable not to that person you're going to be accountable to god for disrespecting his word so when we overstep the word then we're telling god i don't care what you say you know you you know just just say to the husband i don't care what you say uh i i i it's disrespectable you got to respect with humility and in love amen even when one is wrong you still got to give that you know suppose the police jack you up thinking you somebody else and you said you jacking me up huh no you got to get respect he got the wrong person but you give him respect i need to believe and hopefully we can work this thing out and find out you know what i'm saying so what happens amen i don't say everything going to be straight up right all the time some things it's going to be misunderstood something's going to be uh wrong sometimes but you have to you you have to be able to bear what if the least little thing came up in a marriage you run off i can't take no more i'm gone leave the children leave the family you know i'm gone i ain't taking nothing that's no more i'm tired of it just walk off children everything how many times we've seen that people got tired quick the children left without a father or maybe left without a mother because somebody got tired are you with me so what we got to do we have to bear one another burdens amen when one is down that one's picking up you know because every day amen one person might be up to date the other one might be down tomorrow so we have to lift one another up sometimes the church got to encourage the preaching sometimes the preachers encourage the church it should be vice versa you know what i'm saying sometimes i i need your help i need your that the encouragement from you and sometimes you're looking for encouragement for me and we have one another we all need one another are you what man so so by the grace of god we bow one another but we got to be humbled enough to realize amen that god has placed us in the body amen to work in your particular position are you with me the failure to do that is to overlook the word of god okay now uh caleb you wanna no i was reading you show me you show me a church that's humble real humble not arrogant church just sweet humble church and i'll show you a church that has favor and power of god that's right that's that's the thing it takes humility humbling ourselves before god and letting god just work through us don't have to make a lot of noise you know just humbling ourselves oh you're with me maybe i'll uh i want to have ernest i mean caleb durie but it's very important that when we when we're humble the prophet of god said people can come through that door if everybody just be humble and just love one another forgiving one another people walk through that door and you wouldn't have to pray for the sick they would be healed you miracles signs and wonders you never have to touch them it just be just a glorious place to be in his presence it's it's just that you got a a group of humble people people that love one another concern and care about one another he said the power of god to be so great and that's what we are i think we in order to be rapture ready we got to move into that cycle brothers fred that's what we're moving into i believe that's you know when i started with these lessons you know i i i usually don't really greet the saints but shake the you know you know pop them on the hand or whatever and then last night something happened different i got out a little early and uh going to the car and then i was shaking on another hand and then i was hearing the testimonies i said oh oh and then i realized but but i already knew that god was doing something special he's getting us ready for rapture and the only way we're going to get ready for rapture we're going to have to i ain't talking about y'all i'm talking about all of us i'm talking about me too we gotta it takes we gotta improve on our attitudes and how we conduct ourselves and how we speak amen it's gotta take it's got to be a lot of grace season with soul amen we're going to have to have a lot of humility amen the thing is when we get to the point that we say i ain't taking nothing off that's the wrong kind of attitude to have and somebody did me this and somebody did me that somebody's gonna do you that till you die there's always somebody gonna do something wrong do you wrong and we're gonna do even uh unconsciously we'll do one another wrong and not even know it unless somebody tell us you know what i'm saying you'll never know what's going on in a person's mind listen they speak it out you know y'all you know i'm always marrying counseling and all but if you don't if the hug if you don't communicate one with another the marriage won't work you got to be able to tell that wife what's on your what you're going through what you thinking what's on your mind and vice versa and y'all got to sit down y'all got to listen and my wife was just bringing it out she said you know she was just sharing with me and some of the children i don't know who i was there and she said you know this open door here we can sit down around the table and you know with our little bible study and we can talk about things whatever you're going through let's talk about it are you with me she said you know everybody grown but we still doing the same thing you get around the table you have your body let's talk about not just the you know bible but what you're going to what you know and you know you can't live in a house and not hurt one another feeling you know i'm saying everybody hurt one another feeling one time or another but we learn how to what work through it because we're going to what communicate we're going to talk about it we're going to work other than that we want i'm going i'm getting out of here you know what i'm saying but because we communicate we can work through it and because we love one another we gonna work through it amen and it takes time i don't y'all got me the night i ain't supposed to be talking i just want to be on this lesson okay let me go back y'all all right ain't god good communication is is a key are you with me so ernest now where we were obedience and become obedient unto death even the death of the cross now you know the bible you know they sing the song you didn't have to do it but he did you know he had to fulfill what was written of him you know what i'm saying but he said i got power to call 12 legion of angels you know i can do that i want to if you had a little bit of that power that you can call one angel man i don't know what kind of condition the world would be in if you can call one angel and all the craziness and all the filth and all the ungodly stuff going on what would you do if you can call one angel to hamlet or will you look beyond the people faults and say mercy mercy mercy and you know that's what jesus did with all the power that he had i i i think it was killed i said you know he uses he didn't use his power to destroy he didn't use his power to to to low rate or down somebody or think he was better than them when somebody was down and low the woman caught in the very act of adultery the woman with five husband and the one she had wasn't her he didn't use his power to say you know what i have to do with you no but you know the pharisees did if he had known who that woman was that was wiping his feet with her hair and all of that she was you know this is a faint woman what's she doing down there that's a holy man supposed to be you know what i'm saying and that's what uh but jesus never made he meant probably you know the lords of sinners he never showed them ah he was sent out he showed compassion and love you know and see once he said let this mind be in you with all the power and all authority he had he could have said stone her and go get the man too and stone both of them because that's what the scripture said but he came with the love and humility not to shame or embarrass anybody but to love him are you with me so it took it took a a humble god to be so merciful and so kind and so loving to us in each and every day because we live we got to thank god for just living day by day it's the bible said he became obedient to death go head on even the cross where wherefore god also has highly exalted him now see sometimes i you know people want to be famous they want to be great you know oftentimes i just want to get off the air don't want to get on because i'm not interested in people hearing me or seeing me or knowing who i am or whatever but i know some people that you know i i stay because of the encouraging words of different ones that encourage me this is brett simmons thank you and i said okay thank uh i was about to get off i was about to tell them forget about that but because it encouraged somebody then i just hold out a little while longer are you with me and sometimes people have conditions and things in their life but brother and sister it's we're here but sometimes we're not listening to the word at all because our minds and our intention is our focus is always it's somewhere else you know why somewhere else a lack of humility we are self-confident it's almost like leosia said we have needed nothing you know and god is trying to get us in a condition that we could be ready for rapture but how can we be ready for rapture and we can't even deal with ourselves are you with me we're not willing to humble ourselves how can we deal with god you know sometimes we think well you know you know i'm so i i i i'm so holy i'm so righteous and i'm so just and i'm so glad that when i get to heaven i say it ain't it's a pleasure one brother told me you know i took took care of him and did everything for him and he said you know you know take care whatever i can do everything i could do for him and when i did it all he said oh yeah yeah y'all it's a blessing for y'all to do that y'all get a blessing for doing that for me or something like that he was arrogant i said man you eric and something and i sure wouldn't want no woman to marry you you know you know because he thought this is the way you're supposed to do you know y'all supposed to do this for me you know i'm saying no no no no no that's the wrong kind of attitude god don't have to die for he didn't have to die for us he died because he loved us he was trying to show us how he wanted us to conduct our lives the kind of person or get the kind of sons and daughters he wanted are you with me you want your children to be like you you know what i'm saying but you got to if you want them to be like you then you got to be like christ are you with me don't want your children to be like you if you know what i'm saying i ain't gonna say it let's go no wherefore god hath god also have highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father wherefore my beloved that's good that's good that's good god has all exhorted him and given him a name which is above every name now let's go to um colossians 2. and uh one colossians two and one for i would that you knew what great conflict i have for you yes and for them at laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgement of the mysteries of god let's go to colossians 3 and 1. go ahead if you've even if you then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god set your affection on the things above and not on the things of earth for ye are dead and your life is hid with christ and god when christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory mortified therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness that's what we got to do mortify our members upon this earth fornication you got to get rid of you got to fight it you got to it's got to die it's got to rot now you can't just let it just that spirit that spirit that come against you that spirit that attitude young people have to fight that spirit that demon got to die are you with me go ahead and read on fornication uncleanness in order to reflection evil in order to confession doing things that pornography can show you how to do all kind of stuff filled from out of the pits of hell most of the time these children get caught up sin and they get hooked on that stuff sometimes they ain't 10 years old when they hook they got a telephone and they hooked parents don't even know they hooked next thing you know they got in inaudible affection they ought to be a man like to talk to a woman it's all kind of crazy felt ungodly stuff demon powers that people young people get addicted to at an early age and say take god almighty to drive those demons away that's a strong powerful spirit if you get the inaudible ghost the holy ghost will teach you it'll guide you these powerful spirits out here you can't give place to the devil you got to resist the devil the only way you're going to resist the devil you got to be humble if you're not humble you're going to do what you want to do but when you're humble jesus amen thought of not wrong to be equal with god but he made himself no reputation took upon in the form of servant servant and humbled himself this is going to be obedient to god are you going to be obedient to god if you're going to be obedient to god it takes understanding that i'm not you know joseph said you know we realized we were just dust who are we anyway entity that has made us not we are we got to humble ourselves realize how frail we are and how short time a man has to live and why can't we live for god the one that made us and created us if we give it back to god look at oh how blessed we'll be but if we don't get read on i gotta go evil concupisces and covertness which is idolatry for which things which for which things say the wrath of god cometh upon the children of disobedience the wrath of god comes on the children of disobedience now jesus was obedient unto death even the death of the cross and see we got to be obedient to mortify our members upon the earth but it takes humility to do it jesus the bible said he humbled himself to do it amen the captain of our salvation be made perfect through suffering he suffered for a reason amen because he was going to be victorious even in his suffering he's going to show us the way to victory amen he's going to lead us how we going to defeat death by defeating self the problem is that folks look at other folk and look at other folk and they want to be like other folk you got to look at jesus and be like jesus humility joseph never got what he got except he was humble are you with me and many times amen in order to be king it takes humility are you with me so god wants to take us to higher hikes and deeper depths but he cannot do it if you think that because i fast and i pray and i seek god oh that's the attitude that's oh i pray all the time i fast all the time that's just you it's almost like that sinner that just couldn't lift up his head and just said lord he didn't you know tell the lord i do this should i do that he said he give me a sinner you know what i'm saying i'm just a sinner lord forgive me that other fellow done done all of this and all of that he thought he you know yeah i'm blessed you know what i'm saying sometimes we just ought to just you know look at god and say god i need your merch and grace every day i can't never do enough good enough for your lord i ain't i did nothing for you anyway because all i ever done he meant you did it i give you the glory you did it i couldn't do it myself anyway because if it's ever done for god it was done for his glory praise god but if if you had done it you know sometimes you know i think sometimes we think the lord owed us we did so much for god that god owed us something you know this disciples said lord we left all to follow you you know what i'm saying and he said no man is left father mother sister and not in this world receive what a wonderful in the word to come eternal life that's why you cannot you know the person that know all the words you can't help them you know why because they know more than you you'll never help them you know a teacher have struggled with a student that you know sometimes they know more than the teacher but the teacher is in in that condition but a student just is just smarter with but that student that might be smarter than the teacher knows how to subject themselves because that teacher got the power to give them my a of f no matter what they know you see what i'm saying it takes a humility due respect amen i might know that i almost failed one time teacher would be half sleep and she'd wake up giving the people the wrong answer and i said no i missed someone's son the answer is someone's son in all the classes they laugh and she get upset and she'll come again about lunch time we get up she didn't eat you go to sleep mm-hmm and she gave her the wrong answer i said no miss on and you know what she did flunk all my little chin section and i made it out with a d [Music] so and all of them went to summer school you see what i'm saying it's because you know we would have you know i'm uh you know you're just having fun you know but but you understand you you you you in school you got to get respect you got to give respect to that teacher are you with me when you disrespect that t but all of that little chill texting could have you know we could have aced the class probably but because we were young you know i might as well say young and dumb you know think we being smart playing around instead of being humble you know what i'm saying and you know i look back at it i said you know shouldn't have done that you know but when you got confidence in your little flesh you know a little something you know it's hard to know a little something and not you know get puffed up the bible said knowledge what puffs up but charity what when you know a little something it's kind of hard that's why you can't give certain people certain things you know what i'm saying i got it i'm going to try to skip see because i miss you know what happened to me i was looking for a scripture in my head i know what book is in and i thought i knew exactly where it was and i you just see that's sometimes that that's that humbled me and that's what y'all wonder why i was a film you know what i'm trying to do that's what happened i was trying to find that scripture because i wanted to read it i could have asked y'all for it and i know somebody out there would would know it but by the grace of i find it when i when service is over and just to get that sweat off me because i was sweating up here trying to remember that exactly where that scripture was and you know when you get whipped like that you you remember that strip to the next time by the grace of god it'll be in you amen y'all y'all ever been like that you know you know what but i thank god y'all y'all pray for me you see i'm getting a little older but pray for me amen god bless you go ahead um let's let's just go down to uh um the 10th verse and have put on the new man yeah put on the new man i'll just read and put on a new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him see what happened we got to take off the old man and what that see he says in that ninth verse he said lie not one to another sin that you have put off the what oh man you see you got to put off the old man put on the new man as long as you got the old man on you're going to put the new man on amen see what i'm saying jesus said you cannot put new wine in what old bottles and you can't put the humility in humbleness of mind you cannot put amet the gifts of the spirit and you cannot put the power of god in these old in the old man praise god you got to crucify mortified the old man amen he's got to die out amen and you got to put on the new man amen it's something about that brother fred the new man amen this new man the bible said we are we're a new creature we're you know new creation amen that's what god is saying this new creation how does the new creation look amen this is how we ought to look at christians okay he says put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him that's what i said amen where there's neither greek nor jew circumcision or in search kentucky is there your barbarian scythe in is cycling bond not free but christ is all and in and all it says but put on therefore as the what as the elect of god you know you are the elect the chosen amen the elect ones holy and what beloved bowels or what kindness you know some folk can be kind of some folk they can't be kind to everybody you ain't got no kind spirit you got a hypocrite spirit you got to be kind to everybody you got to be kind to your enemy people that you think don't love you don't like you you still got to be kind but some people you know you know you have to pray you know you have to pray to god some sometimes you don't know how to handle your your spirit you know how to release amen your cares you don't know how to you know you don't you you're not used to being humble you you used to me me what i want what i need of me mine my children me and my mind and all you know we're all about self and we our world revolves around us so we cannot see others are you with me so we kind to who we want to be kind to and who we don't want you know what i'm saying so but uh if if if it's the right if the new man you put on the new man amen kindness is a is who you are you can't help yourself amen people just you know they want to get around you because you got a such a loving and a kind spirit of meekness about your gentleness you say well i don't care what you think yeah you ought to care what i think because you got to think that it's one of deadest looking i'm not trying to please myself and i'm not trying to please the preacher i'm not trying to please my the church but i'm trying to please him am i like jesus is that that kind of attitude is that the kind is that's what he would say brother and sister that's what i'm saying god wants to change us all away as individuals amen you want us to put on the new man now and that takes work that takes work how are you going to work work out your soul salvation with fear and trembling that you got god got to work on you but you got to humble what yourself until you're willing to be subject to the word and humbling yourself then the word ain't going to do you no good the word can help you if you don't want no help are you with me the only way the word can help you you're going you're gonna have to look at yourself and see what you need improvements i said we all need improvement and i want an improvement in me amen i want i want y'all to see amen on the ministry and i want you to say hey brother simon's going to improve just listening to him in the ministry i want oh yeah god didn't help that brother and i said thank the lord god help me but you got to look at ourselves and say hey did god help me see what i'm saying because when god helped me it it it's me that he helped but we got to know whether it reached you that didn't rub off on you and it caused you to be helped also are you with me so as we see ourselves uh nearing the rapture and then the coming of the lord we all amen uh you know let's let's put on the new man okay so let's let's this is kindness harmonies of what mine i'm gonna tell you something you get a good good job and making a little money and driving a little car a little house and all that now you're gonna have to oh you something to fool you're something to mess with you can't tell them they ain't got it made lord have mercy you're gonna have to humble yourself are you with me now it doesn't matter how humble we can say ourselves i'm already humble you know i'm humble i'm just as humble as can be i get along with everybody everybody that you want to get along with the other people they just don't like me they don't don't like me because i straighten them out i mean you want to get along with those that you have to straighten out you understand they ought to feel the humility in you the kindness in you the love of god that's in you and that's what we want we want the radiance of the love of god to be flowing from you in such a way that a person can tell oh god yeah even though it's correction that you have to correct amen but it must be correcting in love are you with me because if there's no love in your correction then it's not going to receive well brother i want to tell you so and so on about yourself oh okay thank you but is it received it's not what you say like i said the other day it's not what i said to my wife it's how i said it and it hurt i said it hurt me it hurt her because i said it and i i could hear it come back and hit me hard i said that's the lord the lord doesn't hit me i said i'm sorry you know what i'm saying see because i know i said it the wrong way you see what i'm saying and and that that's what that's what happens you've got to have some humility you got to respect one another if you love one another you don't want to hurt one another are you with me so if it takes a change in the you say it ain't too late it ain't too late to change it's time not just to pray and lord let me be humble you got to be humble but take your stand for the word but how can i take a stand for the word because i don't know how to take a stand for the word and not be who i am not who you are who christ is see because we got to get you out the picture and we got to see god give me wisdom give me you're going to use this old vessel but you're going to use it where amen you know how to operate me amen if i can just yield and let you operate are you with me see what i'm saying god amen knows how amen how he wants to use you are you with me but you got to allow him by yielding to him it takes some praying on you lord help me amen help me amen to be more compassionate and more humble amen help me lord because that's that's the way i want to be i want to be rapture ready i want him to say well done praise god because we overcome this flesh we got to overcome something amen well you can say well done good and faithful servant amen you've been oh god look at all these demons we had to fight not outside not our brother not our sister not the navals not the people on the job but a knee see everything else is in control amen if i can bring this body under subjection and if i can bring this flesh on this ejection then all the outside world can get in oh god they can't get in here praise god they can't get to you are you with me the devil can never cross the bloodline are you with me so you're covered by the blood you in that inner veil you you're down it's an invisible realm but you're there praise god and that's what it's all about god wants to you'll fortify behind the word as long as you stay in that word amen in the spirit of the loving god would protect you it will shield you it'll keep you but when we step from behind the word then the devil got a right that's what eve she came from behind the word she wasn't fortified no more and when you step out from behind the word the devil have a place and we have trouble trouble all around us trouble every way you look why because we're walking in the flesh and we're not walking in the spirit praise god how do you know you're walking in the flesh how are we not how do i know when i'm walking in the flesh and when i'm walking in the spirit of you abiding me my word about in you are you with me if you stay walking amen in the word walk in the light as he's in the light amen that word is a what laughing to my feet light to my path amen so you're walking in the light amen so i got to close here but let me just try to hominess of mine meekness you know people oh brothers the same means oh brothers then he got earthen you know try to be the prophet precious brother oh come on somebody just be who you are what how god made you all that phoniness let's be real god knows if you be real amen you all right it's all right to be you you don't have to put on nothing for nobody else just be who you are it's something you can go marry somebody all the time he gets [Music] no if you who you are don't put on nothing for to try to catch you somebody are you with me just be real are you with me yeah then caught somebody lord have mercy okay forbearing one another for what and what can we do that for ban one another one can we do that i can't hear y'all amen y'all if i have i done your own forgive me are you with me i tell the whole church to forgive me i'm not ashamed i know i know i can say something wrong you know and i know that it's impossible james said the man don't offend the word the same as a perfect man are you with me and i'm striving for perfection but while i'm striving for it i make mistakes just like you are you with me so i ask for i ask for forgiveness all the time but y'all might see him well he asking for forgiveness yeah because sometimes i might have said something unintentionally to offend somebody didn't mean it all right and he said well that's that's a word as long as you're preaching no sometimes you can preach it and you can get a little bit in yourself y'all understand that don't you that's why you have to pray for the man of god that he don't get in his flesh that god be in control are you with me it says if any man have a quarrel against any even as christ forgave you so also what well i tell you the truth i just i know what you did and i know you did that 10 years ago or five months ago six years ago and i just don't trust you that ain't good to say even if you're thinking don't say it please ask god to give you some mercy where you can trust them amen because they might do it 70 times a day and you still have to forgive them i ain't going to let them do it again lord i'm i'm gonna tell you what if they don't do it again somebody else gonna do it the thing that you say i ain't gonna let that person do it again you better let that you at least you see them because god is trying to perfect you and so if god let that thing come against you in a certain way then god is saying this is what it takes to perfect you whatever god allows then all things will work together to what the good what i ain't that nah no no no no it's things in life that you ain't gonna get around because if god allowed and you know you walking in god's path that god has led you in then you stay there in the path that god led you but when we try to avoid the things that god chastised uh i mean so what baby david said and he's throwing that jobbling at me boom he almost killed me and i had to run for my life and he did i got a chance to kill him you know but david just cut a little thing off a song you know and said let's all know i could have he could have killed saul right but he didn't do it he said he touched not god's anointing and do his prophet no i can't touch god's anointed they said david we got a chance to kill saul now get you can get vengeance back no don't touch god's anointing you see david wouldn't have never been the kind of man after god's own heart except in the midst of his trial in the midst of his test he was able to show amen that he had respect for who saul was he was god's anointed god had anointed him to be king are you with me and that's what it is and each and every one of you and i look kings priests and kings under god are you with me so look at it from that life and then you always take the attitude let's let's be quick to forgive are you with me slow to wrath slow the anger amen and let's be quick to love and meekness and kindness and gents and patience amen and god will bless each and every one of our lives i know i messed that lesson up i wish y'all can get the tape from last night but we didn't tape it god bless you let us stand but nevertheless the lord knows then the lord knows it's got to be some major changes in each and every one of our lives if this that's happening in ukraine i'm telling you it's uniting the nations the world is coming together they have to come together to survive you and i got to come together to survive are you with me we're gonna need one another more than we ever needed one another before in this whole world we're gonna need to stick together and we're gonna show that we we need the love of god we need your prayers we need to pray for one another we need to draw closer together with one another because we're going to need one another these trouble days coming up i can see you do you understand all of those people say we're ukrainians right and because we got to stand together in the midst of this battle amen and we're soldiers we're christians we're children of god we got to stand together are you with me because surely that's what's happening in the natural is showing that the world is uniting and don't you think the devil is not attacking look at all these uh you know gay rights just that and all the stuff that's going on what's going on in the school the school has been bombarded and and we need to pray for our children you need prayer for everything i mean it's just everything we got to come together and realize that we are not attacked spiritually speaking we're on the great attack from the enemy that's trying to destroy the bride of jesus christ and we got to stand together more fervently than we ever did before praise god god bless every one of you brother ernest come and pray for me i need your prayer praise god time is winding up you need god to do something for you tonight if you want prayer tonight you can come i'm gonna let brother ernest pray for me and if you need prayer tonight we'll be glad to pray with you for you amen i'ma tell you something somebody might need god today and tomorrow you won't need him the reason why because you'll have a setback in the spirit the devil would do something that would actually penetrate and fortify himself in your life if you don't do something about your condition tonight you can do it tonight or you can allow the devil to be stronger and your resistance of the word will get stronger the thing that's you better now you can get rid of it tonight and put on the new man heavenly father god we thank you lord god god we desire that you will [Music] [Music] god i pray that you regret [Music] [Music] jesus god we thank you [Music] oh

[Music] hey man you appreciate the word tonight amen humbleness amen humility i know that's all i've our desire that's my desire amen i've been praying a lot lately that god would just give us direction in the ministry because i said lord you know with the things we see and going on the signs of the time i said that you know we ever don't want to miss the time that we're living in that's the hour right now i said god the ministry need help we need your leadership and direction i said god we need you to open up the word when i'm asking god i said lord we just need the holy ghost to take over because god we don't know what to speak we don't know what to say i said god give us a word in season no matter what the whole the rest of the world is going after the church world i said god give us a word in season something that we know we in tune with you and what you want your people to hear in the hour that they live in how many desire that today to be in tune with what god is doing i know that's my heart's desire but the only way we gonna uh fulfill that desire is we're gonna have to let go and let god have his way and get rid of our desires our own will and say god i want your will and that's my desire even here tonight i thank god for the word i was telling my wife the other day on the job one of the guys he he was telling me he's like did you know what they said to me and just telling me a remark that was made in a meeting and i said i was picking at him i said that hurt your feelings i said because you you expect them to be somebody i said when you when you want to be somebody when they make those remarks that hurt your feelings and i got one of the other guys and we started laughing i said see we don't expect to be nobody so they can say all kinds of things that it won't bother us but that's what it is even in the in the kingdom of god even though we are the bride of christ we realize that we're only his bride because of election we're only here because of his election and his grace the last couple days it's the word men in my mouth lord you've been so gracious to me because that's what it is all it is recognizing that you only where you are in life you only can achieve whatever you may have achieved is only be by the grace of god when you look back over your life god could have dealt you a hand that he dealt somebody else but he didn't desire to do that but he thought about you when he was hanging on that cross he thought about you when he was taking those whips when they let him spit on them when he could have called a legion of angels but he thought about you he said i gotta go the distance because i know that they gonna need me without the shedding of blood there wouldn't be no remission of sins so he had to go that way for you and i and i'm so glad that he did that's all that's my whole testimony i can only rejoice and tell you about what he's done and the grace that he's given over my life and i pray that that's your testimony even here today let us buy our heads in a word of prayer heavenly father lord we thank you for the word that we heard tonight god was a word in season lord god something that'll help us because lord i believe that that's where your power is when we can forget about ourselves let go and let you have your way in our lives when we can get rid of our wills desires who we think we are realizing that you are the vine lord and we're just the branches we need the life of the vine every day [Music] every day in our homes every day in our lives garden we need the life of the vine god we can't do nothing without you we ask you today lord that you will continue to bless your children continue blessing all god to pastor lord giving him a word to pour out in his heart lord god i thank you now lord i pray as we depart this place but never your presence god the word that we heard we can take it lord and don't let it slip god let somebody ponder on it god as mary did and god let it be born into life god we might see the fruits of the ministry lord we thank you we love you and we appreciate you for all your grace towards us in the name of jesus christ we pray amen [Music]
