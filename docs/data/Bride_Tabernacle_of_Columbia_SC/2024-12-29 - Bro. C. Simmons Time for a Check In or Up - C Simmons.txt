our mission Lord we need need you this morning like we never needed you before and Lord we thank you for your blessings and your anointing and your power and Lord Jesus just move in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen if you have your Bibles this morning you want to turn to the book of First Kings chapter 19 might be a familiar scripture to some but let's start reading at the first verse and Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done and with all how he had slain all the prophets with the sword then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if I make not thy life as the life of one of those by tomorrow about this time and when he saw that arose and went for his life and came to BBA which belongeth to Judah and let his Serv and left his servant there but he himself went a Day's Journey Into the Wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die and he said it is enough now oh Lord take away my life for I am not better than my fathers as and as he lay and slept under juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat and he looked and behold there was a cake making on the co and a cruise of water at his head and he did eat and drink and laid down again and the angel of the Lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee and he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of that meat 40 days and 40 nights unto horb Mount of God and he came thither unto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the Lord came unto him and said unto him what does thou hear Elijah amen God bless the reading of this word you might you may be seated amen I like to speak on a little topic that I in time I entitled it's time for a check it's time for a checkin and we see that Elijah had gotten to the point that he was discouraged he had gotten to the point that he was so low that he asked the Lord to take his life but I don't want to stay on that part I wanted to get to the point where in verse 9 he says what Dost thou hear Elijah and Elijah had gotten to a place that he was just sitting in in this one spot like he was hiding and God had to come and get him and said Elijah you have a purpose to do you have a plan that I have purpose for you to do so what Dost thou hear why are you sitting here it was time for Elijah to have a checkin with God it was time for him to have a checkin with God or a checkup with God where God had to come and he had to tell Elijah what are you doing here why are you sitting still in this cave hiding when I called you to go forth and to do what I told you to do see God has to sometimes we got to have check-ins with God we got to come to come to our senses and come to him and said Lord I I need a tune up I need a check up with you Lord I want you to examine my walk examine my life so that you can so that I may understand where I am and what I need to do cuz my whole goal is to make it and if I ain't going to make it then I need to figure out why I'm not going to make it see if it's something small or something great it's time for me to have a checkin with God see it's time for me to have a checkup with God so that he can tell me what's wrong amen and and he can tell me how to fix it and if I can't fix it I know the one that can fix it see I but first of all I got to have a moment where I can check in with God Amen yes I said back when I was working we had these things that we call checkins with our managers so like we had them what we scheduled them we had weekly checkins and it was basically a progress report what did you do this week and what do you plan to do next week and is there any way that they could help you well sometimes I I would think back to those times when I when I was there working on that job and and sometimes you didn't want to have your check in and people and people was like why won't you cuz sometimes you ain't do a whole lot that week so you was like I don't want to talk to you cuz I ain't got no reason to report to you to tell you what I did I have no reasons and sometimes we get with God cuz we be like I didn't do nothing for the Lord this week I don't want to have a check with God this week cuz I didn't do nothing you know I you know it was a struggle this week so I don't want to have this check in but that doesn't mean you shouldn't have the check in that doesn't mean that you should postpone the calendar invite on your calendar said let's move it to Monday because I'm going to try to do something on Friday when it's scheduled on Friday you sometimes we do that because we trying to and that's what you sometimes we do to God lord don't come near me this week um wait till next week I'll be better next week and then by the time you know it it's a week it's two weeks cuz sometime they cancel on Monday cuz they out of work on Monday so you say thank you Jesus and and that and that's how we do God sometimes we oh he too busy for me right now he didn't see it so we going to go on and we going to clean this up next week but when when does the check-in become too late when does the checkin become too late where where where it's like the next thing you know they laying you off your job because you done postponed postponed when you could have went ain't got help in the first place when you could have had that slight check in and corrected a small mistake versus having a big mistake down the road but sometimes we we in the process of delaying of delaying and say you know what I'm going to fix it in the future I'm going to fix it in the future but not all the time do you have a future to fix it in amen amen and sometimes you don't have a future to fix it in if the job crashed tomorrow then you got to go find another job you can't fix it no more at that job amen it's just a lesson learned and sometimes you got to understand that God be trying to work on you so you don't have to go through that lesson somewhere else you don't have to go through there and build and try to build a new Equity with someone else God has a way of making sure that you have those checkins and sometimes when you don't want to have a checkin God come knocking on your door to find you like he did Adam and Eve he said Adam Eve Where Art Thou it wasn't that God didn't know where where they were he wanted them to come have a checkin with them he knew what they had done he could all he knew all things but he wanted them to come have a checkin with him he wanted them to decide you know what it's time for us to go get right with God it's time for us to go do what he asked us to do it's time for us to come but God wants he gave us a choice he gave us a choice that we can look at it and say you know what I want to have my check-in with God Amen man and each and every day that you have breath in your body you can have a check in with God you can have you can say Lord check on me I was thinking about it and I thought about it when when they if you ever watched a a car race if you ever watched a NASCAR race and when they're racing many of times they have this thing that they call a pit stop and in the pit stop what is the pit stop for the pit stop is where you can go and tune up your car as quick as as possible so if you need new tires if you need more fuel if if you need these minor things they can do it and and they do it and they try to do it as quick as possible and I said sometimes we're running the race but we never making no pit stops and we wondering why the car breaking down we wondering why the car ain't running as smooth as it used to we wondering why hey the fuel tank getting low but we not we don't want to have a pit stop we don't want to pause for a second and take time and go there and get tuned up we don't want to stop what we doing to to to allow God to work on us mold us and make us and build us so that we can go around this track faster we don't want to have those moments because those are hard moments those are not moments that are easy for us those are moments that take time out of our regular scheduled plan of what we have going on in our lives see but God wants you to say you know what sometimes you got to take this moment to pause amen because if you don't take this moment to pause the wheels going to fall off and you going to be in the middle of a race with things zooming all around you and your wheels fall off and now you are a hazard on the track amen you are Hazard on the track because you don't want to take a time to pause and say Lord tune Me Up Lord I want to have my check in with you Lord I need a check up in my life Lord I need to examine my walk can see where I am the prophet of God said he said If any man can watch your own life and and any man can watch your own life and about tell what you are if you just check up on yourself whether you're really a Christian or not watch the things you do watch what you say and your Associates and so forth and you'll find out whether you really got anything or not see sometimes that's why some people are afraid to have a checkup with God cuz they don't want to see themselves in the in in the mirror they don't want God to put the mirror in front of them and show them exactly who they are and show them exactly what you are and and sometimes when when you have those moments you realize you can do like David and go down on your knees and say Lord forgive me amen Lord forgive me because sometime you can may think that you going along and you just coasting and the Lord trying to tell you your wheels about to fall off he trying to tell you that you're about to run out of fuel he trying to tell you that you know what if you don't go into this pit stop now is you might not make this last laugh see sometimes you got to take that pause and say Lord I want to have a checkin with you I want to have a check-in with you Lord I want your presence with me Lord I want you to come near me and show me who I am cuz then when you show me then I can work on me I can do the things that I need to do the Lord to make sure that I'm ready for whatever is coming on the last lap Lord that I'm ready for whatever is going to be fall me on this last lap see some people don't want to have it but I said Lord it it they can keep running but I don't want to stop amen I want to take this pause now so that I can run I can run this last lap as fast as I need to yes Lord say you never know how how quickly the last lap is amen but if if you don't get a tune up you may never make the last lap see th those pit stops are important to make sure the car can continue to run continue to run continue to run that don't mean the car don't have Nicks and bruises on it that don't mean the car ain't got too close to the wall and and got a couple scrapes and scratches on it sometimes the car barely make it to the pit stop sometime they barely make it into the pit stop and and when they make it in but when they get done it's like a new car on the road and sometimes you got to ask Lord Lord I need your strength to make this last lap Lord I need you your your overcoming power to make this last lap Lord I need you to do something in my life to remind me and to show me that you're still here and that you're still with me and that you'll be with me until the end like you said you would Lord I got to come to the moment to hold you to your promises to make sure that even when it get dark outside and it get dark in the room with me Lord I know that you're still here even though I may not can see or feel you I know that you're still here cuz Lord you promised that you'll never leave me and you'll never forsake me and you'll be there to the end but see you won't get that until you have your check in amen see you got to take those moments and pause and say Lord I need you to continue to do a work Lord I need you to continue to do a work in my life Lord I need to get along with you so that I know that Lord what you want me to do there was something God wanted Elijah to do that's why he came and said Elijah why sest thou here he said what does TH hear Elijah cuz he had something that he wanted wanted us to do I was talking to a friend about this and they was like and they ma made a great analogy and they said sometimes it's like when you when you're graduating and you're going from high school to college you know some people want to stay in high school with all they friends with all their Associates and where it's easy sometimes we get to places in life where we just decide you know what I'm okay here I'm okay I can settle here this this is good for me you know the Lord the Lord has done enough for me in my life I'm good right here and we get afraid to take the next step cuz we don't know what that might be it might be harder on the next step you might not know what to do on the next step there's less guidance on the next step cuz when when you in middle school from K12 to to about high school you know that you're going on if you pass your classes and go to you're going to the next grade you're going to the next grade all you got to do is sure do your work and it's pre-planned the school bus come you get on the bus you go to school or some or you drive to school once you get old enough to drive to school but you know where you going it's the same place every day and you're going to see these teachers and you got your school friends that you might have been friends with for a long time and they right there with you but when you go off the college is different cuz what's familiar is gone what's familiar is no longer there that safety net that was there around you is no longer there and now you got to make your own decisions now you got to make some of your own choices not all of them but you get to make your own choices some time you get to make of what I want to eat even though you might get a meal plan some people or you might eat at home depending on what you do but you get to decide what you want to do sometimes you get to decide what you want to major in what school you want to go to sometime that's a choice sometimes that's a choice what school you want to go to what you want to major in what classes you want to take when you want to take them and ain't nobody unless you're getting guidance going to tell you what you what what you going to do it's up to you and see God puts us in situations sometimes that allow us to make choices like that decide what we want to do but he already has it all in the plan and he knows what you going to do before you do it but he allows you to make you think that you making a choice but many of times our choices are influenced about who we around it's influenced about what our friends are doing sometimes is influenced about okay um let's see this was easy for me so therefore I think it's going to be easy for me on the next level that ain't always necessarily true amen just cuz you think it's easy and this but when you go to that next level woo Lord Jesus it can be a whole lot harder I know from experience and so and sometimes you have to go to God and say Lord what would you have me to do amen yes and when God speak to you and give you that Revelation for yourself it's like standing on a solid rock amen because no matter how hard you struggle no matter how much you may almost fail and maybe sometimes fa you know that's what you supposed to do you know that's what you're supposed to do and no matter how many people discourage you and talk down to you it don't matter who it is family friends and others you you stand on it because that's what the Lord told you to do amen and see that's what sometimes God want you to stand alone by yourself so that you can get a word from him so that you know what you supposed to do he wants you to take that pit stop so that he going to tell you Hey listen don't go to the the inside of the track ride on the outside and you may say that's the longest way to get there to the Finish Line riding on the outside that's the but he he didn't tell you that there was going to be a crash on the inside he didn't tell you that there was going to be a couple people that's going to be fighting back and forth and weaving in and out on the inside he didn't tell you all that he just said ride on the outside and you wondering why you riding out there take the longest way to get to the finish line but there was a reason there was a reason but you would have never known if you didn't take the pit stop and said Lord I want you to show me what I'm supposed to do amen Lord I want you to show me how I'm supposed to act Lord I want you to show me how I'm supposed to respond see but it's taking that pit stop where God to show you exactly what you supposed to do he might not tell you all the steps and what how you supposed to do it but he might not tell you what's ahead but he give you leadership and Direction but it takes a time for you to pause and say it's time for me to have a checkup with God Amen it's time for him to show me Hey listen my wheels about to fall off I need him to replace the wheels Lord I need you to replace the fuel in the tank cuz Lord sometimes it's getting kind of low sometimes it's getting kind of discouraging sometimes the battles are getting harder the battles are getting tougher but Lord I need you to refuel the tank give give me some more Joy Lord give me some more happiness Lord give me some more Praises Lord let let let me enjoy you more Lord Lord let me let me get down and say Lord I Thank you more and let me get down and say Lord I lift my hands to give you more glory to give you more praise J see you got to go to him and say Lord I need you to refuel the tank amen cuz sometimes the tank ain't getting fueled while you while you going through life you got to go to them and take a pause Lord I need a special feeling Lord I don't need just to I need a special I need some special fuel for this for these trials and tribulations Lord I need a special v v Vindication from you amen yes yes Lord see that's what you got to go to cuz it's going to take more than what you what you had before sometime they put Nitro in the fuel and boy your your tank justoo it just take off it's it's something special in that fuel and when you flip that switch you you didn't realize how fast the car could go you didn't even realize that this car had this capability but when they put the put that fuel in there oh my God the car run to a whole new level and sometimes you got to ask God lord I need my car to run on a whole new level amen Lord I need you to elevate the car that I'm driving so that you know what I I can finish this race Lord Lord like this this ain't a regular race this a this a different type of race cuz all the devils in Hell done got loose on on the this a different typee of race that I got to run but when I run this race I know where the finish line going to be see I know what the finish line is that's why I can't give up on the race that's why I can't lay down the race some may lay ass to the side and you say no I'm a I'm going to quit the race some might decide to quit but I can't quit the race cuz I'm looking forward to the Finish Line I'm looking forward to where God is going to place me when I get to that Finish Line it don't matter how the race has been run before but Lord as I run this lab of this race as I ended this year and going to next year Lord I want to run faster than I did last year and whatever was befalling in this year I'm not taking to next year amen see that's the that's the type of pit stop that I want to have amen yes every some people just going in there and say and they telling God what they want they come to the pit stop and say all I need is fuel but it's not to your it's not your decision see see when you come to the pit stop there's a Pit Boss that's up there and telling exactly what they want under the car there's a Pit Boss is that has the complete control when you come to the pit stop and is guiding you around the track see sometimes you we go to God and say Lord this is what I want this this this this we don't go to him like Jesus got to his time for his checkin In The Garden of Gethsemane and when he had that check-in with God he said not my will but thy will be done amen yes when you have one of those checkins it can change the complexity of your entire decisions in life amen because you come to the moment that you say Lord I don't want what I want I want what you want for me amen and don't realize that if if you do what what he wants for you you get exceedingly abundantly more than you ever thought or imagine was possible for you amen you'll get more than you ever thought just by saying Lord I want your will to be done didn't mean it's going to be easy but it's just mean that he going to be there in the moments when it's not easy it doesn't mean that it's going it's going to be something that you going to lolly gag on through it's going to be something that that God will take you through things so he can mold you and make you into what he wants you to be am that's why he takes you through things so that you can say cuz all he wanted to do was be a savior amen so he had to take somebody and say Hey listen I need to be saved amen and he takes you through things that he wanted to be a Healer so he allows people to get sick just so you can go to him and say if I have faith to believe that by his stripes SE I'm Healed I'm healed amen and and it doesn't matter whether it happens today or happens tomorrow it's going to happen because I believe and even if it don't happen like the like the Hebrew boy said we still believe that he's still the same God if he don't deliver us from we not careful with what we're saying if he don't Deliver Us from the fiery furnace that don't mean he not God that just mean that that was the that was his plan for us that's where he wanted us to go and that's how he wanted to end it for us amen yes amen see that's what it is you get to that point that you said Lord thy will be done and that's it amen and and and I like to tell people I said that's a scary prayer to pray cuz you have no outcome you have no there there's nothing on the end of that prayer there's nothing to say hey do it this way there's nothing to say hey I wanted to come this way because God's will is totally different from how we would ever think amen when God has his will is totally different than how we think cuz God is say you know what instead of going straight I'm going to take you around the corner and around here and go this way and around that curve that you can't see what's around that curve and allow you to get to where exactly where you thought you could see down the road but he didn't tell you that there was a sink hole in the middle of that road if you had keep going straight that nobody could see it was just discovered but see that's how God does a thing because he knows exactly what's coming ahead he knows exactly what's on the road in the pathway and if you keep going then you might fall in that hole and nobody ever know because because that by that time they don't put up the detour sign they go around see God has a way of just leading you into what he wants you to do he leads you into how he wants you to live he leads you and he put a great God book in front of you that if you read it he'll tell you exactly what he wants you to do and he'll lead you so that in such a way that you'll say Lord I know it's nothing but you amen yes when it gets done and you look back you say I know that was nothing but the Lord amen when you look back and you say this ain't how I thought it was going to happen but you know what God thank you Lord because it was better than I thought it would be when he got done it was like it was more miraculous than I thought it would be see when he leads and guides you and you have that check in with him he'll take you to and allow and show you things that you may have never seen before that you may have never experienced before that you can turn around and to my friends and they can say hey that was God they Marvel at what happens to you they Marvel at what goes on for you and they just said that person just blessed and they Marvel at how God blessed you no it's because you turn and you put your faith and trust in him and you say Lord I want you to do the work not me do the work and when you turn and you put your trust in him God will do things that you didn't think was possible God can do the things that you thought were were just some sideline no those were the main things that God wanted done and say Lord I don't want to this one to put me here or that one to put me there but I Lord I want to do exactly what you purpos for me to do and Lord I don't want to be afraid to do what you asked me to do Am Lord so you got to be like Paul Lord I want I I want to be bold for you like Peter Lord I I want to do exactly what you call me to be see in that pit stop you'll have those conversations with God Amen and when you have have your check in and your your check up with God you examine yourself because the whole goal is is is to get better and to get stronger each and every time that you that you go to God and every time you come in the door you should leave different than the way that you came in amen cuz you never know how many more times did you get to come in the door and see God has a way of of allowing us to say you know what I'm coming to you today I'm coming to you today I want I want you to to get something and and and so it seeps down in the deep inside of you that even if you can't come in the door you can still talk to me that you can still reach me but it's according to your relationship with him and see that's what God wants you he wants you to have a check in with him he wants you to have a check up with him so that he can come to you and so that you can come to him and said Lord I want you to do what you want to do in my life yes Jes Lord Lord I I I wrote down something that I was going to um speak on it sometime but I I wrote it down and I said running from your responsibilities so many of times you can get into places where you run from your responsibilities well you you decide that I don't want to do this no more so you go somewhere else I don't want to do and it can be anything it could be something small so so someone ask you to take out the trash you go to ask somebody else to do it it's something really simple but God has a way that he got something that he wants you to do and as long as you running from it God allow you to go through things until you do exactly what he wants you to do and see God has a way if you have your check in you can avoid all that in between stuff going in the the belly of the well like Jonah did you can avoid all that by just having to check in with God and say Yes Lord and just go ahead and do it see that's what God wants to show you and he wants to do for your life this morning [Applause] amen praise God amen amen thank the Lord amen I appreciate the Lord I was thinking about the young man I was ask me to come and pray for a young man he's senior high school and uh they gave him up the doctor gave him up and I just went down to murle beach the another day to pray with him talk with him concerning his soul and as I was talking to Young nurses came in the room and they was standing inside that they came to do something for him and uh and I looked at them and say excuse me can I you know you you need me to stop they said no no you go ahead home and I was telling the young man about you know his soul and ask him way he stood with God to see a young man that's a senior in high school it says he's taking special classes so he was very intelligent young man but lying there with the tra in and I says I'm going to talk to you and tell you so do you know the Lord do you are you saved shook his hand and yeah I've accepted the Lord he couldn't talk that well because of the tra being the end he just says you've accepted Jesus I say he said yeah yes yes I say I'm going to ask you I'mma go through the scriptures anyway and I want you to I went through the scriptures concerning confessing with the mouth the Lord Jesus and believing in your heart that God raised him from the dead and thou shall be saved and the young man looked and he I said I want you just with all of your heart I want to make this I want to make this thing sure what's going on with you I want to make it sure I want to make sure because you know you done as say God Is A Healer and he's a miracle worker but I said the most important thing is your [Music] soul I said God has a place prepared for them who believe and he loves you and he died for you this life healing is just for a moment just for a little while but your soul can spend eternity I said eternal life means more than healing right now yes God is a miracle worker God Is A Healer but eternal life means more so as I was talking to the young man and the two young ladies I looked at them again they said go ahead go ahead and uh we began to talk to him about after talking to him concerning his soul and confessing the Lord and making sure that that's right I start telling him testimonies of how God healed others I don't think he knew the gravity of his situation he didn't know how I don't think nobody told him I don't know whether anybody told him that he don't have long to live that whatever is wrong with is incurable it'll take God and God Alone to Healing other than that the doctors is all gave up they bought him from chareston and bought him closer to home cuz everybody's giving up and I says well I need to go and so I went in and this young man what got me I say after talking to him a while getting ready to pray I said tell me something what do you want what do you want I I say he said I want he couldn't talk I mean I could understand what he said I said he said I want to be healed I want to be healed laying there in that situation I said I'm going believe God and y'all believe God if you think about what I'm telling you his name is [Music] Crawford I can tell you his first name Zia think about it maybe God would hear one of y'all prayer think about it because my heart was broken my you know I just didn't you don't want to see that but I want you to think about your life what if it was your life is God unfair do we deserve more than we have how do we treat what are we doing with this life so at the end of my conversation I says if God would heal you young man if God will heal you would you live for him would you give your life as a witness and a testimony to the Lord Jesus Christ he shook his head and he say yes I will live for him and I'll give my life as a testimony you see yes that's what I want you know I've seen a lot of [Music] Miracles but I always try to stress the greatest [Music] Miracle is that our soul is Sav because this life here is it's only here for a moment went to murder beach and B and then yes yesterday uh I went to Florence and by the funeral home to with Tanya Grace there she told me called me and told me she had many operations I guess God done raised her up and worked so many miracles in her life this time is sound a little different I've heard Supernatural things are happening in her life so many times she says brother Simmons I'm having this operation is very serious she had a lot of serious operations she says brother Simmons if they saying that it's a great possibility that I might not make it she said but I want you to know one thing I'm going to take the operation if I don't make it I'm all right she made it out operation made it back to rehab and everything and the other day brother Nathan called me said she was on her way to recovery on the way home she had a heart attack and she died she had a heart attack and we went in prayer for her but she went I'm telling you life is very short you don't know when your number is call and when your day is coming I'm saying it to the young Youth and send it to the ones that think they got time you don't know when your time is up Caleb said you need to have a check in with God you need to have a check up where do you stand where's your life what are you doing do you want eternal life do you want to be a Christian do you want to be saved would you offer this the life that you living would you would you be able to stand before God and say God I hope you accept this because one day your life is going to be a sacrifice a Living Sacrifice a testimony and you're going to present you you're going to stand before God and you're going to say to God this is my life this is what I give you by for what you gave me I give it this with the master will God be pleased if he calls you you want him to accept your your life the life that you're living the thing you want him to accept that are you willing to make that check of take your time and say Lord examine me Lord I want your will to be done in my life all your goals and all your achievement but one day when you stand before him that won't mean nothing I told a young man you can be healed today but the greatest Miracle is your soul the greatest miracle for you and I is not hitting the lottery and getting a billion dollars and becoming a billionaire your greatest Miracle is your soul because one soul is worth more than 10,000 wordss are you with me and do you value your own soul that's worth more than 10,000 [Music] Worlds the prophet said one soul is worth more than 10,000 worlds just think about it how valuable your soul is eternal life that you can live and be with him forever [Music] no more misery no more as Caleb said you don't have to make decisions and this and that go to college and this and that and and and be bother with all these things when you got eternal life everything else becomes secondary first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all other things he said I'll take care for you it'll be added but let me have Jesus first God bless you let us [Music] stand some people the tornado it was very windy very stormy but I'm glad you made it you didn't made it I'm glad you made it it was I almost says oh boy I
