But Father we trust you now. Look to you now in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. The book of Romans 12. Guess we'll do double hitter 12 and one. It says, "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. and be not conformed to this world, but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you might prove may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. God bless you in this word. You may be seated. We talking on Sunday is something on sacrifice. Amen. Uh a sacrifice. Now often times people and and in in this Christian walk it's not many people that's willing to make sacrifices. You know I used to brag on sister Michelle. She used to drive up here all through the week through the week and and on Sundays and that wasund and something miles I mean about 100 miles. And then the carols used to for years they drove up from Dollarton three or four uh car loads and that was a you know a sacrifice coming 70 something miles by 80 miles and coming being on time and everything. So a lot of times people make sacrifices to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. Back in the prophet day, people drove from New York. They drove from Ohio. Uh, one brother told me he should drive from Louisiana. Back then, you didn't have this, uh, interstates. It took them uh, a couple of days to get there and a couple days to get back home to be in service on Sunday because and that was a sacrifice. So a lot of times people, you know, when they when they believe that they uh are getting what they need for their soul, then they make sacrifices for it. Amen. So it's it's very important. But I was telling Caleb a while ago, I was just looking at some things in the Foxy book of Malta. And I said, "Caleb, you ready?" He said, "It's it's hard to read. There's some graphic stuff in there." He says, "I read some, but so, you know, the book was on my desk." And I says, and I was just looking back over some things, the sacrifice the saints of old made. He was just telling one story about a man, you know, sitting uh I think on a board or something with the with the priest and he didn't recognize who he was and the priest got upset with him because he wasn't giving him honor and he made some you know probably some sarcastic remarks and stuff and pre and asked him what his name was. Few days later they came and got him and took him and uh put him in prison and in a few days they was going to burn him at the state as a heretic. So it didn't take much to be a heretic just you know because the priest went and told the archbishop this you know this man is a heretic. you had to give the most uh utmost respect to the religious leaders, the priests and folks and and so forth. So by the grace of God, the church itself, I get burned at state and um sometime we see it that as we have these religious walls where people are fighting, they're fighting because they're Muslim. They're fighting because they're Jews. They're fighting because they're this and that. So people will fight for their religion and um but here it says I beseech you therefore brethren that you present your bodies as a what? Living sacrifice living and then h a sacrifice the sacrifice that we sacrifice our bodies we sacrifice our ourselves as a sacrifice. So the if we ask people to make a sacrifice today, it is it it's it's difficult for people to make sacrifices for God. We sacrifice for schooling. We sacrifice for job. We sacrifice for the things that we really want. But the things we really need, we make no sacrifices. We need God. Amen. And it takes a sacrifice. We must be willing to sacrifice. And then if our sacrifice that we're making, is it enough? Is this all I have to offer God? Is just what you know, is it is it acceptable? Will God accept what you giving him right now as your sacrifice? You know, sometimes the little that we do, we get comfortable. We get comfortable just the same old same old and um we get so comfortable in it that we think God is regarding it and God is blessing what we're giving. And I and and and I I'm dealing with yourselves and your life and is God well pleasing with what we're giving him? And I I told him, you know, I I feel like I I need to do more. I feel like I need to give more. I need to do more as a sacrifice to God. See, because the little that we do, we do it because we want to do it. You know, I was battling uh some weather. I'm glad to see Josh here. I battling in a dream last night and I and I said, "Thank God." And it's the sacrifices that we make. Will you make sacrifices for God? Will you make sacrifices for God? Sometimes we battle within ourselves. There's a war going on within ourselves. It was something that we were in such a great revival in my dreams. Great revival. But something had taken over. is taking over my life that we were just moving and it wasn't what I was doing and the way I wanted to go and what I wanted to do is that the spirit just took over and it was just it just revival after revival and the move of God just moving and I know I wasn't in control of where I was going and what I was doing no more. It was just God taking over. And I said, "Oh goodness, what's going on?" I couldn't bring myself out of it because I was just caught up in it. You know, we do this and do that, move here, move that, go this, go that, do that. And it was just God taking over. So, I was it was it was exciting, but I realized I wasn't controlling God. I wasn't doing what I felt like I wanted to do. It wasn't what I was praying to do. It wasn't that I was wanting to do. It was just that the something had taken over and and he was doing it. Amen. You see, he was doing it. And then I I understood they that are led by the spirit of God. Amen. Amen. Not them that leads the spirit of God, but they that are led by the spirit of God. Amen. When the spirit of God is in control of your life, and I said, "Lord, I I want you in control." I want you in the control of my life that I can move and know that you're in the will of God. Amen. Amen. Amen. God coming vindicating what you're doing and where you at. Amen. See, I I I was telling uh Brother Shipman today, I said, you know, you you know, it's a lot of things going on within the framework of the message of the hour. It's a shame. Amen. And he was talking about it's a shame. And that is it is a shame all the stuff that goes on. Amen. Sometimes you will you think, "Oh Lord, this is this is this is it's critical the things that go on." But it's an individual thing. Amen. It's an individual journey. Amen. And we can't get satisfied because we think we got it. But what are we doing with what God gave us? Amen. Amen. What are you doing for God to show God that God I I'm doing something a a and God I believe that you in what I'm doing. Amen. But sometimes we trying to do God a service without it being his will. Amen. Are you with me? Amen. See, if God is not vindicating what you're doing, there's no vindication. Amen. There's no supernatural happening. Amen. See, we we we're moving into a supernatural realm. Amen. We have to have vindication. We I I said, "Brother brother Shipman," I used to call him Major Shipman because when I baptized him over in England, he was Major Shipman. And uh and and brother Shipman, I said I said, "Brother Shipman, what we need is that the the it's time for talk is over. Don't try to explain that to me. All the talk is over." Amen. Because people are talking the talk, but they're not walking the walk. That's right. Amen. Are you with me? Amen. It's time to live. He said, "Present your bodies a what?" living sacrifice. Yeah. Yeah. A living sacrifice and holy. And if God is accept your sacrifice, then he'll come down and consume your offering. Amen. He'll send the fire to consume it. Amen. Amen. Because he's accepted it. Amen. Amen. And and that's what it is. He'll send the fire, the anointing. Amen. He'll send the vindication. Amen. He'll let you know you're walking and I'm pleased with what you're doing. Amen. Praise God. Amen. You don't have to Amen. testify of it. God will testify of himself. Amen. Are you with me? Just keep on walking. Don't worry about what men say. Just keep on Amen. following the leadership of the Holy Ghost. And the Holy Ghost won't act opposite from the word. Praise God. If he leading you up in a way contrary to the word, then that's not the Holy Ghost. Amen. The Holy Ghost are always being in step with the word. Amen. Amen. Are you with me? Sometimes people do things and I just sit back and I'll just okay because I I got to wait on God. Amen. See, if God does not vindicate you your office as a minister and as evangelist, as a teacher or whatever, God has to vindicate uh whatever you are in the in in the body of Christ. God has to vindicate by one spirit. We are baptized into what? One body. One body. Amen. And if you're not looking for God vindication, you're going through the motion and and that won't work. Amen. You want God to be a what you do. You wanted to be approved by God. Amen. Amen. And you want God to accept, Amen, your worship. Whether you're singing, whether you uh uh on instrument or whatever, you want God to accept it because you're not doing it to please men. Amen. And you're not doing it to please yourself. Amen. You want to please God. Amen. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. God come down and he said, "This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased. Whom I'm pleased to dwell in." And God ought to say, "I'm pleased." Amen. With you. Amen. Amen. And then God comes down and anoint what you're doing. Amen. And God come down and quicken it. And you see people, Amen, that are delivered. Amen. Amen. Praise God. They're delivered because, Amen, there's an anointing on you. Praise God. When that anointing, it destroyed the yoke. Amen. G sacrifice. See, we we went back to forsaking all. You have to give up everything. Amen. Your will, your ideals, your thoughts to please God. Amen. He said, "Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy." It's got to be holy. I I believe the word holy is I it's not even respected at all. We're not resp it's not respected. Holy holiness follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man should see the Lord. Are you with me? The holy New Jerusalem, the holy city, heaven, amen, is holy. But the word holy is seem like it's a bad word even among believers. Cuz folks don't want to be holy. They want to look like the world, dress like the world, act like the world, talk like the world. Everybody is into can I can I can I fit in? Uh how am I going to look to my friends, my neighbors, my uh uh fellow uh co-workers or whatever is how you going to look before God? Amen. Because God must accept amen. The way I dress, the way I walk, the way I talk, the way I live, God has to accept it. I don't Oh, excuse me. Amen. It's not the world being accepted by the world. Amen. It you are living sacrifices. Amen. You to live a a sacrificial life. Amen. You must live that you are sacrificing. And and that's what you you you want your life to be a a living sacrifice. Amen. You want folks to look at you and and and they might say all kind of odd things about you and all kind of nonsense about you, but you're not they're not you're not going to be accepted by the world. Amen. If the world accept you, then you are you you're of the world. The world love his own. Are you with me? But uh you know you just you know we just want to dibble and dabble a little bit and we want to you know we want to be cute and we want to be uh hand we want to you know sometimes we have to just say Lord God I want to please you. I want to be accepted by you. I don't care what the modern trend is. I don't care what they are doing. Lord I want to please you. Amen. Amen. Amen. Said, "Whatever you do in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus." Isn't that right? See, if you doing the Somebody says, "How do I know if you cannot do it in the name of Jesus?" Amen. You ought not to be doing it. Amen. Are you with me? So, if you're doing it in the name of Jesus, then you must recognize, is Jesus pleased with what I'm doing? Amen. And if he's not pleased with what you're doing, then who you trying to please? Yourselfh, some spirit out of the bottomless pit or something. Who you trying to please? Amen. You crying because folks are I ain't got no friends. Jesus sacrifice. He made a He made a the greatest sacrifice could ever been made. We couldn't even we we didn't have what he had. Amen. He was God. He was in heaven. He had angels worshiping him. But he can't sin. He came down. He came down from heaven. He humbled himself. Amen. Are you with me? Let's just see Philippians 2 for a minute. He humbled himself and and and and um it takes a a a humility. It takes humbling oneself to come and condescend come down. Amen. I think Caleb talk about high what your huh high and lifted up. Lift it up. Lift it up. lifted up. Come down off your high horses, they say. Amen. He says here in the fifth verse, let this mind be in you which is also in Christ who being in the form of what? Thought not robbery to be what? Equal with God. Equal with God. He I I mean which you and I the Bible said we join with Christ. Are you with me? Amen. So in other words, he's saying if you join us, you equal. Amen. But he thought of not robbery. We know who we are. Praise God. But are you really who you say you are? Amen. Go ahead. Are you really who you think you are? Are you with me? Amen. So often time we say we are and we think we are, but we ought not. He said that you have a name that you live but you days. Amen. See, sometimes we have the name of Christ, but he said, "Let everyone to name the name of Christ, let him depart from what? Iniquity." So he said, "Nevertheless, the foundation of God standing sure, having the seal the Lord what?" He knows them that are his. Are you with me? God knows them that are his. You must walk circumspectly. Amen. Not as fools redeeming the time because you know the days are evil. Evil. So there must be Amen. a a a humility that strikes you, that overcomes you, that uh uh woos you into a place of humility. A place that you become humble. Amen. Amen. Humbling yourself not to men but to God. Amen. Praise God. And when you can humble yourself before God, Amen. you have no trouble with men. Amen. Praise God. Because we must realize, Amen. If I uh my life is a living sacrifice and I'm sacrif the effort that I make to come to church, the effort that I make to pray, the effort that I make to study the word. Amen. Uh, you know, do I have time? I can take time for everything else, but I can't take time for God. Bless. I got time for everything but the Lord. Bless. I'll pay extra money to fly and do this and do that, but I won't something that has to do with the spirit of the Lord might tell you go do so and so and witness to so and so. Can't be the spirit of the Lord cuz that going to cost me $1,000 to do that. So, I know that ain't the Lord. But we'll we we'll to please ourel, we'll put it on the credit card and we'll go with no money. Well, we going to do something to please ourselves. But it comes down to sacrificing for the Lord. Uh-uh. I ain't doing it. Not for not for the Lord. For for myself or for something I want or something I want to do, something that's going to please me. I I'll go overboard because I ain't got but I ain't got I ain't got but what? One life to live and I'mma live it. I'm going to tell you something. Praise God. If you going to live this life, you need to live it to live again. And I just caught up. I'm going to go through life and I'mma miss out. You better make sure you miss hell. Are you with me? Miss going now. Are you with me? You might miss out on a lot of things in this world, but don't worry about it. Amen. God going to Amen. give you 100fold. Amen. He give you eternal life. Amen. Are you with me? Amen. Oh, we want to grab everything we can because we conned. We got to die out. Abraham sacrificed Isaac. Are you with me? Oh, I better leave that alone. I got Sunday morning. Oh, okay. So, so by the grace of God, we we you got to be willing to sacrifice yourself. You got to be be able to come to God and says, God, I want to sacrifice. I want to be a living sacrifice. I'm willing, Lord. I got to die to myself. I want to crucify this old flesh. Let it mortify. Lord, not my will, but let your will be done in my life, God. That's what I want. I want your power. I want your spirit. I want you, God, more than anything. That's what I want. Amen. I want God. Hallelujah. Get the mind of Christ. He always said, "I come to do the will of my father." And you're here to do the will of God. That's why he chose you. That's why you're saved because you want to do his will. Amen. And if you're not saved, you ought to want to be saved. Amen. There's nothing stopping you but your stubbornness. Amen. Amen. Praise God. And the stubbornness is a sin of what? Witchcraft. So you got a witchcraft spirit on you. Are you with me? When you're stubborn. Amen. Praise God. That's what Saul, he didn't want to obey God. He didn't want to obey what the prophet told him. Amen. He was stubborn, disobedient. Obedience is better than what? Sacrifice. Better than sacrifice. Are you with me? You sacrifice something that God told you not to do. And you want God to accept it. Are you with me? That's what Saul did. He he he he did something God told him to do this and he did opposite and say God accept it. That's what folks are doing now. Amen. Oh yeah. Amen. The word say don't do it. We'll do it. Oh yeah. Amen. And we say God uh accept it. God tell you. Amen. One husband, one wife. Ain't that right? You're bound by the law. to your husband till he's dead or to your wife. Amen.

I did it because of that." Amen. Didn't I tell you not kill everything? Don't bring nothing back. But you had an excuse. Folks have an excuse for their sin. And they trying to explain their way out from what the word say. There's no explaining. Amen. The word said it. I believe the word. Amen. And the heaven and earth will pass away. God word going to stand. Amen. Amen. I said I was fussing Sunday from the time I got up till I sit down. I'm fussing again. Y'all y'all with me? Y'all all right? Amen. It says, he says in the sixth verse, who being in the form of God thought not robbery to be equal with God, but made of himself no reputation. We're not trying to get a reputation here. People looking for fame and fortune and reputation and all of that. We're not looking for that. Not looking for money and glory and glamour. Amen. Yes, sir. Praise God. I I be flying all over the world looking for fame and glory. And people say, "Oh, Brother Simmons or Bishop Simmons or whatever they want to call me." You know what I'm saying? Apostle Simmons or whatever. But I ain't looking for none of that. You know, Prophet say, "If you love me, call me brother." Amen. Amen. I'm all right with that. Are you with me? Amen. Praise God. But sometimes some folk want to give you some respect and I let them do it and people get upset cuz you let them do it. They say bishop. They say apostle they say brother still giving you respect. And some people just call you Henry. Some folk just call you Hen. I'm all right with that. Are you with me? Amen. What should I call you? Reverend. Should I call you doctor? No, you can just call me here and I'm all right. You know, you see what I'm saying? Henry's all right. Amen. All of that is good because I'm not seeking a reputation. Amen. I don't I don't worry about that. You ought not to worry about reputation. Are you with me? Amen. Amen. You ought to worry about whether or not you're going to be acceptable before God. Amen. What is that good, acceptable, and perfect will of God. Amen. Amen. Because you're going to be held accountable. Amen. For the sacrifices that you ought to be a sacrifice. right now. But made of himself no repetition, but took upon him the form of a what? And was made in the what? Likeness of men. Made in the likeness of men. He was God. God is a spirit. The word in the beginning was the word. The word was with God. And the word was God. And the word was made flesh. Amen. Amen. The Bible say he became sin. And he left everything he had heaven. He come down, amen, to make be a a living a sacrifice for you and I. Amen. The lamb of God to take away the sins of the world. He did all this for you and you can't do nothing. Nothing but look sad. But you ought to be glad he did. Lord, I'm so glad you sacrificed your life for me. For me, you died. For my sins, you shed your blood. God, you bought. Hallelujah. I bought with a price and I'm not my own. I'm glad that I'm not my own. I belong to him. Praise God. I'm glad to be a child of God. I'm glad to have eternal life. Are you with me? Yeah. Some people don't believe it, so they don't have it. If you don't believe it, you won't receive it. Amen. If you don't believe that God is good and that God got your best in mind. Amen.

Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Praise God. Yes, I'll serve him. Yes, I'll live for him. Yes, I want to please him. Talk about me. Amen. Criticize me. But yet I'll still praise him. Yet I still love him. Yet I'll still trust him. Thank you. Praise God. Thank you, Lord. Glory. Thank you, Lord, Jesus. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Praise God. Thank you, Jesus. And being found in the fashion of a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death. He said, "If any man come after me, let him first of all deny himself and take up his what?" Cross. Are you willing to deny yourself and take up your cross and what? Follow him. And follow him. Are you willing to do that as a sacrifice? Because you realize the sacrifice that he made for you and the sacrifice he made for me. Am I willing to sacrifice for him? Everything you do, you ought to think about God, how do you see it? Amen. How do you see me? Amen. Because I I I know how I see myself. Am I so caught up in myself that I don't try to please God in everything I do or say? Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Or do I am I trying to please God in all? Thank you, Jesus. Are you with me? Because in the little things, the little foxes fall the vine and the little leaven what? Hold on. Are you with me? Amen. It's the little things that we're going to come before God. He says, "Apart from me, your work was of iniquity. I don't know your wife. You didn't you missed the little things. Amen. Praise God. But little becomes much. Are you with me? Yes. I I got to stop. I don't want to fuss too bad. Come on, brother. And this is closes out. This closes out in your own way. Amen. God is good. Amen.

Yes, Jesus. Yes, Jesus. Something that'll push us. Yes, Jesus. Into that realm. Yes, Jesus. That realm of sacrifice that realm faithfulness where our eyes can get off of the world. Get off of the carnal things and get back to you. That's what we need. Hallelujah. Thank you. Oh Jesus. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. Thank you. It feels so good to worship God. Amen. I feel all right worshiping the Lord. Amen. I feel all right. As the brother pastor was saying tonight, he's been so good. Amen. [Music] In the times when we our faith wasn't enough. Yes, Lord. He still showed up. He made ways. Yes, Lord. I was telling Moses the night, me and him was talking on way coming to church and I was telling him about some things. I said, "Now, no way was that supposed to happen." I said, "But God did that." God in his infinite mercy did that. And I said, "That's what he does." I said God wants to bless you. But he won't force you to serve him now. Amen. He ain't going to force you. One day every knee will bow and every tongue will confess. But he ain't in the forcing business. Amen. Right now, but he's saying you could freely come. And I said, "God God did this. God did that." I was telling him tonight, God did so many great things. Yes, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Amen. He did so much that it sealed my faith throughout all eternity. Amen. Amen. The highs and the lows that I might have, it won't cause me to turn around. Because I know where God has brought me from. Amen. I know how good God has already been. What he's already done. Hallelujah. He done enough already. Come on. He did enough. Come on. Don't take him through no more. He did enough already. Come on. Hallelujah. Do you believe that tonight? I believe that. I thank God. I I just love the presence of God. Amen. I thank God for the word tonight. You know, I was thinking that today I says a lot of times I says people just move off of excitement cuz they everybody excited. They think they get excited but when the excitement is gone then they they fall off. I says those coming out of Egypt with Moses, they was excited even dancing on the other side of the Red Sea. But that excitement turned in tears after a while because even though they was following the prophet Moses, they never got a relationship with the God that Moses had. And I said, "The thing is what's important, you know, it's not just excitement, but when you got a relationship, that makes a difference. Cuz when you got that relationship, Yes. it's like sunshine in my soul." Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Every day is a good day when God is in my life. Amen. Through my highs and through my lows is it's more than just excitement. It's a relationship now. Come on. God is talking to me. He's teaching me something. He's showing me something day by day. And I said, that's what I I fell in love with with God, with the relationship with him. Cuz when everybody else the excitement is gone, God is still there. And I still communing with him. Hallelujah. He's still taking me through some things, bringing me here, bringing me there. And I just love that fellowship with God. That that that's what never gets old. Hallelujah. How many believe that tonight? And that's what the ministers of God preach to the people to get a relationship with Christ. Come on. That's what it's about. It'll never get old. It'll be new. Be fresh every day. Come on. I can't I can't tell you. You got to experience that for yourself. Sometimes you you say, "Oh, I understand." But if you really understood, Hallelujah. If a person really understood, they'd lay all their burdens down. Amen. Come on. Nothing wouldn't shake him, not even death itself. Hallelujah. I believe that and I thank God because it was him all the way. How many believe that tonight? You know, I want to say one more thing. You know, he was talking about the sacrifice tonight and uh I said it was the year before last, I think it was. They hired and it was quite a few Muslims at the job and they all the time would go wash their hands and their feet, I guess, and they'd kneel down and pray wherever they could. They'd be outside in the cold sometimes or in the heat kneeling down doing their prayers in front of everybody. And they did it in such a way we had a meeting and in the meeting they says we done cleaned a certain room out at the job and we making that a prayer room. And I thought I says that ought to put the Christians to shame. They made a prayer room for the Muslims that you want to go in there and pray because why? They saw that these people were real. The women, they wore their long skirts, hot as it was, the black skirts all the way to the ground, arms covered all the way up, face covered all the way up. It'd be 110 degrees in the plant, but they was faithful. And they went in that room, they'd have their little prayer room. I said, "That made me jealous." I said, "Because with the God we serve." Amen. Well, it's a rebuke. Amen. The sacrifices that we make versus the sacrifices that they make, they made such a sacrifice it caused the company to establish a prayer room. Even on the clock, don't clock out. Go in there and pray. I said, "God, what what more what what can we do?" Hallelujah. Come on. I said, I pray that even tonight we start making more of a sacrifice. Amen. Because the devil is ramped up. He's ramp this power up. But and I know as I was saying Sunday, it's going to take more than what we got right now. It's going to take more than the Holy Ghost is enough, but it's going to take more than what we doing. God going to have to swoop down and give us something. I believe that. How many believe that tonight? the pushers, all the excitement, people saying, "Oh, we" But like you said, you walk the walk, you talk the talk, but you can't walk the walk. The difference between Israel and all everybody else was a supernatural among them. You could be wherever, whatever church, whatever, whatever you want to be, but that God going to make the difference. I believe that God is so good. Amen. Let us bow our heads in a word of prayer. Lord, we thank you tonight for your grace, Lord, and all of your mercy towards us. Hallelujah. Thank you for your love and kindness. Lord, thank you for the word, oh God, that we heard tonight. It was such a blessing to our hearts. Oh God, the sacrifice, presenting your bodies as a living sacrifice, that's what we want tonight, Lord. God, I pray Lord as we depart this place but never your presence. I pray that the word as is a seed God, it went out and it landed on good ground. Those that are here and those that are listening in that their minds might get in tune with you, oh God, their hearts might be drawn back, oh God, to want to serve you. Do it, Lord, I pray. Move in a mighty way. Father, we love you. We appreciate you for all of your grace and your mercy. Thank you, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. [Music]
