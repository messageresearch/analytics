[35:58] we got to say amen and it reads
[36:02] the elders which are among you i exhort
[36:06] whom am also an elder and witness
[36:09] of the sufferings of christ and also a
[36:13] partaker of the glory
[36:15] that shall be revealed you may be seated
[36:17] this morning
[36:18] we'll read a little further down
[36:22] feed the flock of god which is among you
[36:25] taking the oversight thereof
[36:28] not by constraint but willingly not for
[36:31] filthy lucr
[36:32] but of a ready mind neither has been
[36:34] lords over god's heritage
[36:37] but in samples to the flock and when the
[36:40] chief shepherd shall appear
[36:42] ye shall receive a crown of glory that
[36:45] fade if not away
[36:46] likewise your youngest submit yourselves
[36:48] until the elder yea
[36:50] all used to be subject one to another
[36:52] and be clothed with humility
[36:55] and god for god resists the proud and
[36:58] give
[36:58] grace unto the humble humble yourselves
[37:02] therefore
[37:02] under the mighty hand of god that
[37:05] he may exalt you in due time casting all
[37:09] your care
[37:10] upon him for he careth for you be sober
[37:14] be viligent because your adversary the
[37:17] devil
[37:17] as a roaring lion walketh about seeking
[37:21] whom he may devour how many know the
[37:23] devil is out to destroy you this morning
[37:25] he says your adversary the devil he
[37:28] ain't playing games with you come on
[37:30] but he's he's a roaring lichen lion i
[37:33] mean
[37:34] seeking whom he may devour you know
[37:37] i always says if it ain't for the grace
[37:39] of god the devil would have been
[37:40] knocking many of us out wouldn't he you
[37:43] know i was ministering i said a lot of
[37:45] times
[37:46] you know we be careful of how we look at
[37:49] others because i says you know
[37:53] was i i made an example once we were at
[37:55] the the job
[37:57] and over across the street you know it's
[37:59] a lot of homeless and drug addicts and
[38:01] things and
[38:02] you know some of the guys were saying
[38:04] some things and i said you know
[38:06] with me i can't look at people a certain
[38:08] way
[38:09] no matter what condition they are right
[38:12] i said
[38:12] because that could have been me come on
[38:16] that could have been you i said i
[38:17] remember my parents one day
[38:19] i says that you know god is it's
[38:22] only a measure of grace that god has
[38:25] given us
[38:26] through what through election and you
[38:28] don't know who god who's god's seed amen
[38:31] you don't know the one that you count
[38:33] out remember that might be god's chosen
[38:35] one
[38:36] that might be the one that god take come
[38:39] on man
[38:39] many times they said saul come on do you
[38:42] know he even questioned
[38:44] god once he uh i believe they questioned
[38:46] god he said you know this man got
[38:48] letters come on
[38:49] to destroy the church of god are you
[38:51] sure he said come on god is sure
[38:53] god knows god knows them that are he is
[38:56] how many believe that
[38:57] but it's a measure i believe that
[39:00] of grace so we're only here this morning
[39:03] by the grace of god
[39:05] we're only here in church praising god
[39:08] being able to lift
[39:09] our hands and say thank you jesus by the
[39:11] grace of god
[39:12] because our adversary as a as a roaring
[39:16] lion come on he's walking
[39:18] seeking whom he may devour but when he
[39:20] would devour you the angels of god was
[39:22] there come on
[39:23] when he would devour you god kept you
[39:26] through the night
[39:27] when he would devour you god kept you

[51:31] first verse
[51:32] who am also an elder and a witness
[51:35] of the sufferings of christ come on he
[51:38] talked about
[51:38] he was an elder but he says he was also
[51:41] a witness
[51:42] of the sufferings of christ not only did
[51:45] he physically walk with jesus
[51:47] and witness the sufferings that jesus
[51:49] went through but he went through
[51:50] suffering his own self come on
[51:52] he says i'm a witness of the suffering
[51:55] but he didn't leave it there
[51:56] he says not only am i a witness of the
[51:59] suffering
[52:00] he says and also a partaker of the glory
[52:04] that shall be revealed come on
[52:06] i said that's what we're talking about
[52:08] this morning being a partaker of the
[52:10] glory

[52:24] at
[52:24] uh great statues of people like like i
[52:28] was making an example one time
[52:30] we look at a sometimes an oak tree
[52:33] and a big oak tree and how it might be
[52:35] great and mighty
[52:36] and the roots of it it's stretched out
[52:39] and the limbs are so big and
[52:41] maybe that tree being around sometimes
[52:43] they'll say those oak trees may have
[52:44] been around hundreds of years
[52:46] come on and we marvel at the statue of
[52:49] that tree
[52:50] come on but we don't never take into
[52:52] account the seasons that that tree been
[52:55] through come on
[52:56] to get to the statue to where it is we
[52:59] don't
[53:00] take an account sometimes on the storms
[53:02] hallelujah
[53:03] i made a statement i said one time if
[53:05] trees could talk
[53:07] maybe they can tell you about some
[53:08] hurricanes that they've been through
[53:10] hallelujah
[53:11] maybe they'll tell you about some
[53:12] droughts that they made it through
[53:15] maybe they'll tell you about some cold
[53:17] winters that they made it through
[53:19] but they looked like sometimes they died
[53:22] but nevertheless
[53:23] they didn't die because the roots still
[53:26] had life in it
[53:27] you marveling at the tree but you didn't
[53:29] take an account of what the tree been
[53:31] through
[53:32] i've been through some storms i've been
[53:34] through some rains but nevertheless
[53:36] i'm still standing tall today hallelujah
[53:39] oh jesus so what it is it says what
[53:43] we go through things come on and then
[53:46] but you know god
[53:47] bringing you through these things to do
[53:49] what he want to show you all
[53:51] come on i said being partakers of his
[53:53] glory come on
[53:54] we want the glory but do we want to go
[53:56] through the afflictions
[53:58] do we want to go through the suffering i
[54:00] got many examples we wanted to go to
[54:01] this morning
[54:02] i wanted to talk about daniel come on we
[54:04] like oh i want to be like daniel come on
[54:07] but daniel had to go through something
[54:09] to get to that glory didn't he come on
[54:11] to get to that glory daniel had to go
[54:13] through the lions then didn't he
[54:15] he had to go through being bondage and
[54:17] all those things but in
[54:18] all of that brought out the glory didn't
[54:20] it come on
[54:21] because god never left them but god
[54:24] wanted to show that in the midst of a
[54:26] mess
[54:27] hallelujah then in the midst of you know
[54:29] in your worst condition
[54:31] when you had to look like the worst
[54:33] state when all hope is gone
[54:35] god wanted to show forth glory out of
[54:37] that hallelujah but how did he get the
[54:40] glory he had to go through
[54:41] didn't he those hebrew boys come on
[54:44] partakers of his glory

[54:47] that glory didn't they joseph
[54:49] went through something come on to get
[54:51] through that glory come on let me get to
[54:53] that glory it says

[56:11] goods ain't that what he said
[56:13] and how they said they'll say they have
[56:15] need of nothing
[56:16] come on but he says they didn't know
[56:20] what kind of condition they would be in
[56:22] they would be wretched
[56:23] miserable blind and naked come on
[56:27] just paraphrasing it in the world lost
[56:30] without god hallelujah they'd be in that
[56:33] condition
[56:34] and they wouldn't know it ain't that
[56:36] what he said he says but
[56:38] he says behold i'm standing at the door
[56:41] knocking
[56:42] any man that would hear me come on open
[56:45] the door
[56:46] let me and i'll come suck with him he
