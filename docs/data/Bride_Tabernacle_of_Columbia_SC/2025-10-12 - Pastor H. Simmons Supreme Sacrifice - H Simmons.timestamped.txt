[18:50] God bless you, saints.
[18:51] &gt;&gt; God bless you. I'm feeling kind of
[18:52] nervous. So, just pray for me on this
[18:54] one because I've been practicing this
[18:56] song and you know, I sang it once at our
[18:59] church, but um I think that I'll sing it
[19:01] today, too. I pray it will be a
[19:02] blessing. Sometimes when I'm learning
[19:05] songs, sometimes I just like the way it
[19:07] sounds, but when you're listening to it,
[19:09] it will minister to you. So, I'm just
[19:11] the instrument in God's hand. So, just
[19:13] pray for me.
[19:15] Is that good?
[19:18] [Music]
[19:31] I pray into the atmosphere.
[19:35] Spirit of God, you're here. You have
[19:40] full authority.
[19:44] I speak weak over my heart and mind.
[19:49] I am healed by your strife. Your blood,
[19:54] your blood
[19:56] declares that I am free. It's in the
[19:59] mighty name of Jesus
[20:03] I pray.
[20:05] Calling on the power of heaven.
[20:09] I proclaim
[20:12] every weapon formed against me
[20:16] must break
[20:18] in the mighty name of Jesus.
[20:27] I draw a permanent boundary line.
[20:31] The enemy has no right to come
[20:35] near our family.
[20:40] No scheme can ever undo God's plan. No
[20:44] matter the circumstance, the cross has
[20:49] sealed our destiny.
[20:52] In the mighty name of Jesus,
[20:56] I pray,
[20:58] calling on the power of heaven,
[21:02] I proclaim.

[21:09] must break
[21:11] in the mighty name of Jesus.
[21:18] In the mighty name of Jesus,
[21:23] I know
[21:25] every power of fear and darkness
[21:29] must go.
[21:31] And every key to every victory
[21:36] I hold is in the mighty name of Jesus.
[21:46] I will not fear. I will not fear.
[21:51] The enemy comes near on the doorpost of
[21:54] my life is the blood of Jesus Christ. I
[21:59] will appear. I will not fear. There's an
[22:03] army of angels here. I'm protected on
[22:07] all sides by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[22:14] It's in the mighty name of Jesus.
[22:19] I pray
[22:21] calling on the power of heaven.
[22:25] I proclaim
[22:27] everywhere performing
[22:32] must pray
[22:34] in the mighty name of Jesus.
[22:40] In the mighty name of Jesus,
[22:44] I know
[22:46] every power of fear and darkness
[22:50] must go.
[22:53] Every
[22:55] victory
[22:57] my hope is in the mighty name of Jesus.

[34:11] and all of them
[34:15] that pressure your way out this morning.
[34:17] Amen.
[34:23] Therefore, if any man be in Christ,
[34:27] he is a new creature.
[34:30] Old things have passed away, and behold,
[34:32] all things become new.
[34:35] And all things are of God, who has
[34:39] reconciled us to himself by Jesus
[34:42] Christ,
[34:44] and has given us to given to us the
[34:47] ministry of reconciliation,
[34:50] to the wit that God was in Christ,
[34:53] reconciling the world unto himself,
[34:56] not imputing their trespass
[34:59] unto them, and has committed unto us
[35:04] the word of reconciliation.
[35:07] Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ
[35:12] as though God did beseech you by us. We
[35:18] pray you in Christ instead. Be ye
[35:21] reconciled to God.
[35:23] For he has made him to be sin for us,
[35:28] who knew no sin, that we might be made
[35:32] the righteousness of God in him. God
[35:35] bless you. Reading his word. You may be
[35:37] seated.
[35:41] We want to talk about supreme sacrifice.
[35:47] Supreme sacrifice.
[35:50] And when we talk about sacrifice this
[35:53] morning, we often times we associate
[35:57] sacrifice with an offering
[35:59] with an offering
[36:02] to offer up something.
[36:05] And usually
[36:09] we offer up something that will mean
[36:15] that it means something to us.
[36:20] And it's usually we're making a
[36:22] sacrifice for a cause.
[36:27] If you want something,
[36:29] sometimes you make sacrifices to get it.
[36:32] If you want a car,
[36:35] then you want to work and labor and you
[36:38] want to save towards that car.
[36:42] So in order to save towards that car,
[36:44] some of the things that you wanted to
[36:46] do, some of the things you wanted to
[36:48] have, you may have to avoid having those
[36:52] things because you're making a sacrifice
[36:55] to get what you want.
[36:58] And uh you make sacrifices if you want
[37:02] something, you sacrifice for what you
[37:05] want. Are you with me
[37:09] &gt;&gt; now?
[37:12] the sacrifices
[37:15] that Christ made for you and I. I want
[37:20] you to think about that
[37:23] uh as we go to first Corinthians 5.
[37:26] 1 Corinthians 5
[37:29] sacrifices. I I want to just talk to you
[37:33] this morning about sacrifices. Giving up
[37:36] something.
[37:38] Are what are what
[37:42] are you making the sacrifices
[37:45] you living? The Bible says we should
[37:47] present our bodies as a living
[37:49] sacrifice.
[37:53] Sacrifice unto God.
[37:56] Okay,
[37:58] we should do that. But what are you
[38:01] sacrificing? What what are you willing
[38:03] to sacrifice
[38:05] for God?
[38:07] I find that what's missing in the church
[38:10] today and what's missing in the
[38:13] Christians today
[38:16] that they have no
[38:19] sense of sacrifice
[38:22] as a whole.
[38:25] Not everyone but as a whole.
[38:29] We come out of tradition,
[38:33] but we don't come to offer sacrifice.
[38:38] I remember
[38:41] uh Sister Michelle used to drive from
[38:44] Spartanberg and sometimes alone in the
[38:46] night through the week, don't miss no
[38:49] service and all. and being a medical
[38:51] doctor, she made a I said, "Boy, she's
[38:54] making a great sacrifice,
[38:57] you know, just to get in church."
[38:59] And then I remember over the years the
[39:02] carols used to come from Donald
[39:04] and they would be on time and they made
[39:06] a sacrifice to get here and they did it
[39:09] for years up and down the highway you
[39:12] know driving you know
[39:15] hour 15 minutes hour and a half coming
[39:18] to church from Dollarton.
[39:22] Okay. So the I look at those as you know
[39:25] a little bit farther than coming two
[39:27] miles or maybe 10 miles. those that come
[39:30] from Sister Michelle was coming, you
[39:32] know, about a 100 miles to get here on
[39:36] Friday and uh on Tuesdays, on Fridays
[39:38] and on Sunday mornings, I said, "Oh,
[39:41] that was a that's a sacrifice."
[39:44] And uh most of the people, you know, a
[39:47] lot of people that within 20 minutes
[39:52] uh they, you know, they have a difficult
[39:55] time. And I remember the cows, they
[39:57] always like to be on time. You know what
[40:00] I'm saying? And the most of the people
[40:02] come dragging in.
[40:05] They come in and they late
[40:08] 10 minutes away, 15 minutes away, 20
[40:11] minutes away, but they're late.
[40:14] Okay. What are you willing to sacrifice?
[40:17] And what we do
[40:20] now, the Bible says God so loved the
[40:23] world that he gave his only begotten son
[40:25] that whosoever believe in him should not
[40:27] perish but have everlasting life. Isn't
[40:29] that right? Now here in sec in second
[40:32] Corinthians the Bible said he made him
[40:36] to be sin for us. He made him to be sin
[40:39] for us who knew no sin. Amen. But for us
[40:43] he sacrificed his life. The supreme
[40:46] sacrifice his life for you and me.
[40:51] Jesus sacrificed his life for us. Are
[40:54] you with me?
[40:56] &gt;&gt; He gave he was killed. He was crucified.
[40:59] He was killed for you and I.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:03] So here in 1 Corinthians uh 5 it says
[41:09] in the seventh verse he says he said
[41:12] purge out therefore the old leaven that
[41:15] ye may be made a new lump
[41:18] as
[41:20] ye are unleavened
[41:23] for Christ our what
[41:27] &gt;&gt; our passover
[41:29] is what
[41:30] &gt;&gt; sacrifice sacri sacrifice us. When we
[41:33] think about the Passover, we look back
[41:35] to Egypt and and and the children of
[41:39] Israel coming out of Egypt. They had to
[41:41] kill a lamb, put blood on the doorpost
[41:43] and on the lint. And he said, "When I
[41:45] see the blood, I will what?"
[41:48] &gt;&gt; So Christ is our Passover. So his blood,
[41:52] the blood of Jesus Christ, when I see
[41:54] the blood, I will pass over you. So what
[41:58] happens when Jesus shed his blood? He
[42:01] said that we might be made the
[42:04] righteousness of God in him. He died
[42:07] that he he he wants to make you
[42:08] righteous. Can you look at somebody like
[42:11] you and me and all the sins that we have
[42:14] committed, all the things that we've
[42:16] done wrong? But Christ, our sacrifice,
[42:20] it's a supreme sacrifice gave his life.
[42:23] Amen. That we could be made righteous.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[42:29] He didn't want you to be a sinner
[42:31] anymore. Amen. But you could be
[42:34] righteous. Your sins could be forgiven.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; He died that for that your sins could be
[42:42] forgiven.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; That you don't have to you be judged.
[42:45] You don't He said that if any man be in
[42:48] Christ, he's a new creature.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Old things are passed away. Behold, all
[42:53] things become new. So God is willing to
[42:57] make you new in Christ to take away your
[43:01] past and bring you into the presence and
[43:03] making you a new person.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; You can go on you can walk out of here
[43:09] being new. Are you satisfied and
[43:11] comfortable in being a sinner
[43:15] and you can be a saint? You can be you
[43:17] can have eternal life. You can have a
[43:20] new nature. You can h be a new
[43:23] individual. Amen.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; The the desires and the appetite of the
[43:27] world, the things that you've been
[43:29] feeding on, the things that you've been
[43:31] eating spiritually, you don't have to
[43:33] eat those things anymore because God can
[43:36] change, amen, your inside that you don't
[43:39] have the appetite.
[43:42] It's just like uh you know uh uh we
[43:45] often times talk about a a a buzzard can
[43:48] eat any kind of dead rotten stuff. Ain't
[43:50] that right? But a dove cannot do that.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[43:56] &gt;&gt; But God, he the sacrifice that he made.
[44:00] Amen. To give you a nature like a dove.
[44:03] The Holy Ghost is like a dove. God gives
[44:06] you his spirit and his love and his
[44:10] that's what he sacrificed that you can
[44:12] have that. You don't have to be mean,
[44:15] nasty, cursing, smoking, drinking,
[44:18] running around, doing all kind of filth
[44:20] and ungodly stuff. Amen. He comes to
[44:23] change that.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; To give you, Amen. the love of God, the
[44:28] Christlike nature. But if you love that,
[44:31] then you know, you can't love God and
[44:34] mammo. You can't you if you if you want
[44:36] to be like that. I thank God that
[44:40] brother said he said I'm tired of the
[44:42] way I'm living. He said
[44:45] I made up my mind today.
[44:49] I ain't go I don't want to go that way
[44:51] no more.
[44:52] He said I want to be baptized in the
[44:55] name of Jesus Christ
[44:57] and I want to give my life totally to
[44:59] him. I'm not I'm made up.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; So it it is when you come to that place
[45:09] that I I I want to give my life to God.
[45:13] So Christ is our Passover. When I look
[45:17] at the the death angel was passing
[45:19] through the land of Egypt and he was
[45:21] killing all the firstborn. But if the
[45:24] blood was on the doorpost and on lint,
[45:26] he passed over you. Amen. So when we
[45:31] take communion
[45:33] and uh
[45:35] the bread and the wine and all is to
[45:38] remember that Jesus
[45:40] Amen died for our sins. He was crucified
[45:44] that we might become amen the
[45:46] righteousness of God in him.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. We become holy, sinful, wretched
[45:52] and undone people like us. God makes us
[45:56] righteous.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[45:59] Now in Ephesians 5
[46:04] and 1, Ephesians 5 and1,
[46:11] it says, "Be ye therefore followers of
[46:15] God as dear children."
[46:19] Amen.
[46:20] Be ye followers of God as dear children
[46:24] and walk in what? and walk in love as
[46:28] Christ also has what?
[46:31] &gt;&gt; As Christ he loves us.
[46:34] If it does not if it does not sink deep
[46:37] down inside of us that Christ love you
[46:40] and I.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; It's because of his love for us. He died
[46:46] for us.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Because he just simply why why why Lord?
[46:52] Why you want to love me? Why you want to
[46:54] die from me?
[46:56] Am I worthy of that? No.
[47:00] Are you worthy of somebody? I mean, God
[47:03] that didn't do no wrong.
[47:07] Amen.
[47:09] But he wants to he wants to die for the
[47:13] Bible said even when we were yet enemies
[47:15] in our mind by wicked works, Christ died
[47:18] for the what?
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Ungodly.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:23] We were ungodly people. But he made a
[47:26] sacrifice.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; He God sacrificed
[47:31] his life for you and me.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; He he he he gave it for you and me, if
[47:38] it does not anchor with inside of you,
[47:41] you know, out of all the things we can
[47:44] do for one another and all the things
[47:46] that we want out of life.
[47:50] Amen.
[47:52] Sometimes I I I thought about a good
[47:54] parent, father and mother. They
[47:56] sacrifice for their children because
[47:58] they want the children to have shoes, to
[48:00] have clothes, to have food to eat. And
[48:03] they sacrifice for them.
[48:06] Amen. To make provision that they can
[48:08] have a home, a house to live in. And
[48:11] see, you know, sometimes the children
[48:14] because they think this is all in the
[48:16] norm and they they think everything is
[48:19] cool, everything is all right, they
[48:22] don't even take the time to understand
[48:25] that the reason why you have food to
[48:27] eat, reason why you have a place to stay
[48:30] is somebody is paying, they're
[48:33] sacrificing that you can have that.
[48:37] But it don't come in their mind because
[48:39] if the parents says, "I want you to cut
[48:41] the grass." They got a problem. Say, "I
[48:44] want you to wash the dishes. You ate the
[48:46] food, but I I got a problem."
[48:49] You know, there's always problems, you
[48:51] know. And now they think, "Amen. If I if
[48:56] I wash these dishes, even though I ate
[48:58] the food, that I'm doing a favor for
[49:01] mama."
[49:03] You know what I'm saying? Mama, you look
[49:05] at me. I'm washing these dishes and for
[49:08] you,
[49:11] you know, ate up all the food, but they
[49:12] washing the dishes for mama.
[49:16] Amen. You got a a nice house with air
[49:19] condition and and and heat and
[49:23] everything and and said, "Clean your
[49:25] room up."
[49:28] Uh and and cleaning the room up. We
[49:32] think we doing uh mama a favor uh uh to
[49:36] clean the room up. Make your bed. You
[49:40] know that not knowing that the bed that
[49:43] I'm sleeping in that somebody sacrificed
[49:46] that I can have a bed to lay in.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, somebody's sacrificing
[49:53] that you got air conditioning when it's
[49:56] 100° outside and you got in the heat
[50:00] when it's uh 32° and freezing outside.
[50:04] You got heat and you warm.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; You got shoes on your feet when somebody
[50:12] ain't got shoes on their feet.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got clothes to wear when other
[50:17] folks, amen, don't have a one garment
[50:21] &gt;&gt; and they glad to have that one.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; But you got two, three, four, five pair
[50:28] of shoes and you got tennis shoes, you
[50:31] got walking dress shoes, you got, you
[50:34] know, you got all kind of stuff.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; But somebody sacrificed that for you.
[50:39] Now, when it comes to God, Amen. the
[50:44] sacrifice he made that you can have
[50:45] peace.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; You can have joy.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can Amen. You can have love.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. The sacrifice that he made, he
[50:57] said, "Oh yes, I'm going to give you my
[50:59] peace.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to give you joy
[51:03] unspeakable, full of glory.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you so many wonderful
[51:08] things."
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you righteousness.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. for your sins and for your wicked
[51:15] way you live. I'm going to make you
[51:18] righteous.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to make you holy for all
[51:23] your uncleanness. I'm going to make you
[51:26] holy.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; I'm going to clean you up.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Sacrifice that he made
[51:34] &gt;&gt; that he made it possible for you to have
[51:36] all of these wonderful blessings.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. all these wonderful blessings. But
[51:43] you know something?
[51:45] Some folk, Amen. You can provide all of
[51:49] that, a house for them, this for them.
[51:52] You know what they say, I'd rather be
[51:54] homeless.
[51:56] I can go home tomorrow. Young lady, she
[51:59] came late on the steps. She said, "I
[52:00] want to uh uh uh" We saw in the camera,
[52:04] talked to her. She says,
[52:07] we asked her, "What you need?" cuz we
[52:10] went out to the church. She says, "I
[52:11] need a blanket."
[52:15] I said, "Where you from?"
[52:19] She said, "Oh," she wanted a blanket to,
[52:22] you know, she said, you know, she was
[52:24] kind of homeless. She wanted a blanket.
[52:27] And I said, "Well,
[52:29] where you where you from?" She said,
[52:32] "I'm from South Carolina." I said, "What
[52:33] about?" She said, "I'm from Orangeburg."
[52:37] I said, "Okay." I said, "You got people
[52:38] in?" She said, "Uh, yeah. You know, I I
[52:42] wanted to, you know, see about her, take
[52:44] her home and see what I can do for her."
[52:48] But, you know, I said, "But you got that
[52:50] cigarette on my on these steps."
[52:56] She said, "Okay."
[52:58] And so, so we telling her what you know
[53:00] what we want. I felt sorry for
[53:04] but you know I I I I I was hoping she'll
[53:07] stay there. We'll try to accommodate her
[53:09] and try to help her. Take her home. Take
[53:11] take her to Orangeburg. See if she got
[53:13] some relatives, somebody to care about
[53:15] her. she didn't have nobody to care
[53:18] about her then I you know I don't know
[53:20] what I'm going to do because I you know
[53:23] sometimes uh but
[53:28] you know you look at it and you say
[53:30] people you know sometimes and I I
[53:33] noticed that when long she done walked
[53:36] away and gone before I could get out
[53:38] here to see about her she gone
[53:42] because I asked her who your people
[53:46] where you live? What's your name? You
[53:50] know what I'm saying? Because I I I want
[53:53] to know like, do I know you? Do I know
[53:56] your people? You know what I'm saying?
[53:59] So, a lot of times people are in
[54:02] terrible shape. But sometimes people are
[54:05] in the condition that they in because
[54:07] they think that that's what's good for
[54:10] them and that's what the best that they
[54:13] can have.
[54:16] Sometimes they feel like I'm comfortable
[54:19] and I I'm happy.
[54:22] You know, I look at people that are in
[54:25] bad shape and they, you know, it's a a
[54:29] little girl, you know, she think she'd
[54:30] be getting over on me, you know, she
[54:33] she's a prostitute, you know, and she
[54:36] think she'll be getting on.
[54:39] You got $5 on you. I can catch the bus
[54:41] or something. I said, "Okay."
[54:44] Next time I said, "Yes, brother." So
[54:47] when I don't feel like giving her no
[54:48] money, I won't give her nothing. But I
[54:50] said, "You know, don't you want to go
[54:53] back to Winssboro where you from?" And
[54:57] she say she got children and all. Don't
[54:59] you want to go back? But look like she
[55:02] want, you know, we folks are want to
[55:04] help people, but sometime people just
[55:07] feel like, you know, I like doing what
[55:09] I'm doing. I like living what I how I'm
[55:12] living. I'm satisfied. I'm happy.
[55:16] Because this it the flesh, Amen, don't
[55:19] want to do right.
[55:22] We were born in sin, shaped in iniquity,
[55:25] and sin that our mother conceiveed. And
[55:27] the flesh don't want to do right.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even though others are making
[55:33] sacrifices that you can have have a
[55:36] better lifestyle, a better way. Amen.
[55:39] That you can do better. But yet
[55:42] we sat down. God had made heaven
[55:44] available.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. God. Amen. Amen. He wants to open
[55:50] your blind eyes and bring you out of
[55:53] darkness into the marvelous light.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; That this is a this is just a a
[55:58] wonderful life to live.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; This is a a the beauty of holiness.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is a Amen. This is a Oh, God.
[56:08] It's far beyond anything I could uh I I
[56:11] can't even express to you what what
[56:14] being a Christian mean to me
[56:16] &gt;&gt; and where I was and what I had to go
[56:19] through.
[56:21] You know,
[56:22] but thank God,
[56:25] you know, you know, sometimes people
[56:27] said, "I tried to to live a Christian
[56:29] life and I tried to do the right thing,
[56:32] but
[56:35] seemed like God didn't meet me."
[56:38] In other words, and I'm saying, you
[56:40] know, it looked like God can't do what
[56:42] he said
[56:45] when he sacrificed his life and he made
[56:47] the decision to die for you and he said,
[56:50] "I give you eternal life and I I'm not
[56:53] going to charge you anything for it. All
[56:56] I want you to do accept it and receive
[56:58] it. And if he gives it to you, Amen."
[57:02] And he gives you of his spirit. He gives
[57:04] you of his life. He gives it to you and
[57:07] you say, "Well,
[57:10] something wrong. I ain't got I ain't got
[57:13] what you said." It remind me of the
[57:16] blind man that the prophet prayed for
[57:19] and he said, "Uh, receive your sight,
[57:23] John Ryan or whatever." And the man, you
[57:25] know, walked away. He came back and got
[57:28] back in the prayer line. He said, "You
[57:30] told me I was I can see and I'm healed."
[57:34] He said, "Do you believe it?"
[57:38] He said, "Yeah." He said, "Go on, you
[57:40] heal. You can see."
[57:43] But the man was still blind. Ain't that
[57:45] right? And that's the way some folks
[57:47] are. That, you know, God said, "Your
[57:50] sins are forgiven."
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. You you you you're forgiven. Your
[57:56] sins are forgiven. I'll give you eternal
[57:58] life. But the you said, well, I don't
[58:02] feel like I got eternal life. Ain't
[58:04] nothing changed.
[58:07] The way eternal life at my hair getting
[58:10] gray,
[58:13] I'm still, you know, I I I still ain't
[58:17] got much money. But he said, I give you
[58:20] eternal life. What's going on? I ain't I
[58:22] don't feel like I got it. I don't see
[58:24] it. I don't see it. He didn't say see
[58:28] it. He said believe it. You have faith
[58:31] by faith. You receive your sight. Ain't
[58:33] that right?
[58:34] &gt;&gt; By faith. Amen. You receive your healing
[58:37] by faith. Amen. You accept what Jesus
[58:41] did for you by faith.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Not by sight, not by feeling.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; He died for your sin. Do you believe
[58:47] that?
[58:48] &gt;&gt; And if you believe that, then receive
[58:51] eternal life.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Accepted.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. your pass from death to life.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; And if you believe that, you can hold
[59:01] fast to that.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Let me see read this St. John 5 and uh
[59:11] 24.
[59:25] Okay. It says, "Verily, verily I say
[59:28] unto you, he that hears my word and
[59:30] believeth on him that sent me," what?
[59:36] How many believe?
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; If you believe, then you can have what?
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Everlasting life.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Everlasting life. You believe that?
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Somebody say
[59:48] I don't feel like I got everlasting
[59:49] life.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; He didn't say feel it. He said believe.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:54] He said, "Verily, verily, I say unto
[59:57] you, he that hears my word and believeth
[1:00:00] on him that sent me have everlasting
[1:00:03] life and shall not come into what?
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Condemnation."
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Condemnation. The devil. There's no
[1:00:09] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:00:12] Jesus.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Who walk not after the flesh, but after
[1:00:15] the spirit. For the law of the spirit
[1:00:18] and Christ Jesus have made me free from
[1:00:20] the law of sin and death.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; God has made you free.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; If you can believe, you can receive.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; If you don't believe it, you'll never
[1:00:34] have it.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; And if you believe it for a day and the
[1:00:38] next day you doubt it, then you
[1:00:42] you lose it.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. The just shall walk and shall live
[1:00:47] by what?
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Faith. If you believe it today and
[1:00:50] tomorrow, you go back and say, "Well, I
[1:00:53] I thought I was healed." John Ryan
[1:00:55] thought he was he could he to be able to
[1:00:57] see, but his eyes were still blind. But
[1:01:00] he kept on confess that you're healed.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. He kept on saying, "I'm I can see.
[1:01:06] I can see. I can see." And one day while
[1:01:09] he's in the Bible, Amen. his eyes popped
[1:01:13] open.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. His Bible was convinced. Everybody
[1:01:17] was cuz his eyes popped open because he
[1:01:19] confessed it.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; And you must be continually confess
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; what the word saying.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; God, your word said it.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; If your word said it, I believe
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; that my God cannot lie.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; It's impossible for him to lie.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; He told me, Amen. Amen. That if I
[1:01:41] believe that what he said, Amen. in his
[1:01:45] word that I'm I have eternal life.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; I have everlasting life and I pass from
[1:01:53] death.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Unto life.
[1:01:58] But what happens once you get to
[1:02:01] thinking that once the devil get you to
[1:02:04] doubting, your healing is gone.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; What about can I stay saved when I begin
[1:02:11] to doubt? You know, I can see some of
[1:02:14] the worst sinners, man. They doing all
[1:02:17] kind of ungodly stuff, but I believe in
[1:02:20] Jesus and I accepted him as my personal
[1:02:24] savior.
[1:02:26] And they continually thank the Lord. I
[1:02:29] believe in God. The Bible said the devil
[1:02:32] believe there's one God in tremor.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe in Almighty. I know what
[1:02:38] God done for me. Amen.
[1:02:42] But the Bible says he has made us the
[1:02:46] righteousness of God in him.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we look at other folks that
[1:02:51] Amen. They
[1:02:53] they are false representatives
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; of Christianity. Amen. They they
[1:02:59] actually not Amen. They're not a They're
[1:03:03] not living what they are speaking.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; If we speak it, then let us Amen. Let
[1:03:09] God Amen. work to work in our lives. Let
[1:03:14] God do what is needed in our lives.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let God, Amen. clean us up.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; The word, the same word that saves us is
[1:03:24] the same word that heals us is the same
[1:03:27] word that cleans our lives up.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; If we allow the word to have
[1:03:32] preeminence.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Lord, you said it.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I couldn't save myself. I couldn't
[1:03:40] die for my sin.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; But Jesus died for my sin.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; He sacrificed his life for me.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; You know when mama say wash the dishes,
[1:03:55] you wash those dishes not because
[1:03:58] you doing mama a favor. It because you
[1:04:01] ate the food.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And she said, "Clean your room."
[1:04:10] You cleaning your room cuz I got a room
[1:04:13] to stay in.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; And in this Christian life,
[1:04:21] Amen. We thanking God for what he done.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you for giving me this new life.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you for blessing me to be
[1:04:38] saved.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you for the love that you have for
[1:04:43] me.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; I'm saying every day, thank you, Jesus.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; I don't feel like I'm in bondage. I
[1:04:51] don't feel like Amen. I'm doing God a
[1:04:53] favor. Only thing I want to do is thank
[1:04:56] him.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. If I'm not Amen. If I don't go and
[1:05:01] do the things that I used to do and live
[1:05:03] the way I used to live, I said, "God, I
[1:05:05] thank you for a better life."
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you for a better way.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; I'm saying, "God, I appreciate."
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm saying you got to have
[1:05:23] something to thank the Lord over.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, I thank you.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, it's so many people don't
[1:05:30] want to stop sinning. Amen. A sinner
[1:05:33] don't need to stop sinning. A sinner is
[1:05:36] a sinner.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; And that's where they get all their
[1:05:38] pleasures for sinning.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when a sinner, Amen. recognize
[1:05:43] that there is a better life. Amen. A
[1:05:46] Christian life is a better life.

[1:08:09] borderline Christians that have come so
[1:08:12] far, but they stopped before they got

[1:08:23] but before you really got what God
[1:08:26] promised for you, you look at it and you
[1:08:29] said, "Ah, these giants are in the land.

[1:10:41] The sacrifice.
[1:10:45] God has a provided way
[1:10:48] for you to receive what he says.
[1:10:51] He said, "If you repent of your sins,
[1:10:54] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:10:56] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[1:10:59] sin,
[1:11:01] then
[1:11:03] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:11:05] Ghost."

[1:11:31] Romans 12.
[1:11:33] God is good. Amen.

[1:11:54] the you're looking at the wrong thing.
[1:11:57] Look at the cross and look what he did
[1:11:59] for you
[1:12:02] and you receive that. But you're looking

[1:12:25] ready to go to hell?
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Do you want to go there?
[1:12:33] No. But I I believe I'm going to get
[1:12:35] right someday.
[1:12:39] I believe I'm going to get it together.
[1:12:41] When you get it together, God don't want
[1:12:43] it.
[1:12:45] You know, God, you can never get
[1:12:48] yourself right enough or you can't get
[1:12:50] yourself together. He said the day you

[1:14:35] Rachel had to take me to the funeral
[1:14:36] yesterday. The boys is too busy. She
[1:14:40] said, "Daddy, I'll take you." You know
[1:14:42] what I'm saying? But
[1:14:46] it it's something. I said, you know, and

[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; And I love him for keeping me.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Romans 12. And I said I was closing.
[1:16:46] He said, 'I beseech you therefore,
[1:16:47] brethren, by the mercies of God,
[1:16:51] Amen. That you what?
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Present your bodies
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; a what?
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Living sacrifice.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; You know
[1:17:02] it. He said a living sacrifice.
[1:17:07] I tell you the truth.
[1:17:11] If I was God and people did me like
[1:17:13] that, like they do me,
[1:17:16] you think God I ain't God.
[1:17:21] They come to church when they want to.
[1:17:23] They do like they want to
[1:17:26] do God any kind of way.
[1:17:31] You know, faithful
[1:17:34] people ain't faithful like they used to
[1:17:36] be, brother Bo. They ain't faithful to
[1:17:39] God,
[1:17:40] man. It used to be people were faithful.
[1:17:44] It meant they almost had to be dead to
[1:17:46] miss church.
[1:17:50] There was something about brother Ike.
[1:17:52] He said he missed Sister Patricia and
[1:17:54] brother Fred. He said, "Where that
[1:17:59] gentleman over there, the elder of the
[1:18:01] gentleman?" I said, "Oh, Sister Patricia
[1:18:04] had a little accident." I said, "Well,
[1:18:06] they would they they here. They here.
[1:18:08] They don't miss."
[1:18:10] Amen. But you know, it's something about
[1:18:13] that. It's not that they don't miss
[1:18:14] because I'mma fuss at them.
[1:18:18] I wish I can fuss enough, make people
[1:18:20] love God more. But fussing ain't going
[1:18:23] to do no good. Ain't right. God God told
[1:18:26] me a long time ago, you can't make
[1:18:28] people live right. You can't make people
[1:18:30] do right. So, you might as well forget
[1:18:32] about all that fussing.
[1:18:34] If they love me, they gonna do right.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; If they love me, they ain't gonna have
[1:18:39] no problem.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And And that's what happens. If
[1:18:44] you love somebody, you make sacrifices
[1:18:47] to show them that you love them.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Daddy say, "I love my children." And you
[1:18:52] want you're too lazy to get out and
[1:18:53] work.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; To to make provision for the you know,
[1:18:59] if you love me, you going to do
[1:19:00] something.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Okay. Mama say, "I love you."
[1:19:06] Amen. The love that you have, you
[1:19:08] nurtured and you care for him.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; You You show your love. Amen. Jesus
[1:19:16] showed his love cuz he what? He died for
[1:19:20] our sin.

[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; He proved his love. Amen.
[1:19:25] He said,
[1:19:28] "I beseech you therefore, brethren, that
[1:19:31] you present your bodies of what?" By the
[1:19:33] mercies of God. That you present your
[1:19:35] bodies of what?
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Living sacrifice.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Your body don't belong to you.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; You bought with a price.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; And that's the precious blood of Jesus.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Your body does not belong to you.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:51] I you I remember one of some of the
[1:19:53] first sermons I preached, it's not your
[1:19:55] thing and you can't do what you want to
[1:19:56] do with it.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; I don't know who was saying it's your
[1:20:01] thing.
[1:20:04] I said that that's a lie
[1:20:09] and you can do what you want. The Bible
[1:20:11] said know you not the Lord. He is God.
[1:20:13] It is he that what?
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Made us. Oh yeah. I used to preach like
[1:20:18] that when I was young. I knew what they
[1:20:21] were saying out there. And I said, "It
[1:20:23] ain't your thing." And church is full up
[1:20:25] with young people, too. I can say that
[1:20:28] all I want. They don't know what I'm
[1:20:30] talking about. Young people,
[1:20:34] young people, they they don't know
[1:20:35] nothing about it's your thing. How many
[1:20:37] young people know what I'm talking
[1:20:38] about? It's your thing.
[1:20:41] They don't know. They ain't never heard
[1:20:42] it.
[1:20:44] Do what you want. Amen. And that was
[1:20:47] that was just the singing. They were
[1:20:49] singing and dancing in the club. It's
[1:20:51] your thing. You do what you want to do.
[1:20:54] And and and that's what people believe.
[1:20:55] It's your thing. You can do what you
[1:20:57] want.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; But the Bible tells us we bought with
[1:21:00] the price.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that he paid the price
[1:21:03] for you.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; He paid the price. You bought with a
[1:21:06] price and you're not your own.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't tell God. Amen. When
[1:21:12] you're a Christian, you you you you
[1:21:14] thank him for paying the price.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; He paid the price. Amen. And now I'm a
[1:21:20] debtor.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. I owe him my life.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. He paid a debt. He did not owe. He
[1:21:30] ow we owed a debt we could not pay.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:36] A living sacrifice, holy,
[1:21:38] acceptable to God, which is your what?
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Reasonable service.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Reasonable service. Right? And he said,
[1:21:45] "Be not conformed to this world, but be
[1:21:48] ye transformed by the renewing of your
[1:21:50] mind that you may prove what is that
[1:21:52] good, acceptable, and what?
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Perfect will of God."
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you willing to make a
[1:21:58] sacrifice for what you want?
[1:22:01] You want a car?
[1:22:05] Amen.
[1:22:07] If you wanted a car and and it cost you
[1:22:10] $2,000 and I reach in my wallet
[1:22:15] and I said, "You want how much it cost?"
[1:22:17] 2,000. He said, "Yeah, 2,000." And I
[1:22:20] reach in my wallet and say, "Here, here
[1:22:21] it is 2,000.
[1:22:26] Would you take it?"
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:33] Amen.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Now, I had to get that $2,000. You
[1:22:38] didn't get it. I got it that you can
[1:22:42] have that what
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; car cuz you wanted the car. Isn't that
[1:22:46] right?
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Now, it's something more valuable than a
[1:22:49] car.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about eternal life.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; And that Jesus said, "I paid for it."
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; And you can have it. Do you want it?
[1:22:59] Amen.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; You want that car. You ain't thinking
[1:23:01] about that eternal life. You want a car
[1:23:05] and God going to give you eternal life.
[1:23:07] For about Can you understand? They want
[1:23:09] the car. You stay with that $2,000. I
[1:23:13] want that $2,000 the morning. I take the
[1:23:15] $2,000. But eternal life, you can you
[1:23:18] can keep that.
[1:23:20] You see what I'm saying? Do they
[1:23:22] understand the value that car break down
[1:23:25] on you?
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord have mercy.
[1:23:33] Oh God, I wish I could see those things.
[1:23:36] I wish that when I was a teenager I
[1:23:38] could see like Amen. I wish somebody
[1:23:41] would have told me that.
[1:23:43] I think I I I think I couldn't stay in
[1:23:46] my seat.
[1:23:48] I think Oh Lord.
[1:23:52] But you know folks that turn Jesus down
[1:23:55] and they hold to their sins.
[1:23:58] and they walk out of here still a sinner
[1:24:01] and all they have to do accept Jesus
[1:24:03] Christ.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. I hope you
[1:24:08] are willing to make the sacrifice.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Amen
[1:24:13] to present yourself,
[1:24:15] a living sacrifice.
[1:24:18] And that sacrifice that you're making,
