[35:40] bread the devil was saying
[35:45] if meaning he wasn't
[35:49] show prop God was bringing that out but

[36:01] what every word that proceeded out the
[36:04] mouth of God then the devil taketh him
[36:08] up unto the holy
[36:11] city and sth him on a pinnacle of the

[37:58] the devil give it to you but you got to
[37:59] worship
[38:00] him all this I give to you but you got
[38:03] to worship
[38:05] Him are you with
[38:10] me then said Jesus unto
[38:13] him get the hint Satan for
[38:18] what it is written thou shall Worship
[38:22] the Lord what th God Jesus knew who he
[38:26] was
[38:27] the Lord thy God in him

[39:54] wrong one isn't that right
[39:57] even though the devil could come back at
[39:58] him with the word Jesus could come back
[40:00] at him with the
[40:02] word it's
[40:04] written that's why the Bible says study
[40:06] to show thyself approved unto God of
[40:08] work needed not to be ashamed ain't that
[40:11] right some people just come to church
[40:13] they don't
[40:15] study some people want the preacher to
[40:18] do all the study for Mama to do all the
[40:19] study Daddy to do all the study wife to
[40:22] do all the studyy but they ain't going
[40:23] to do nothing they just come to church
[40:28] they just come to church don't even read
[40:31] their Bible leave it at church I read
[40:33] mine on my phone that just
[40:38] Alibi did I say

[40:49] corner re about every
[40:52] day God so love the word
[40:55] gave I read my Bible
[40:59] today pray every day Lord bless me
[41:04] today thank you for
[41:07] Lord you know really
[41:10] having uh a desire to please
[41:13] God the
[41:15] devil wasn't
[41:18] sure
[41:19] now I want to talk about creating an
[41:22] atmosphere of perfect
[41:23] love creating an atmosphere of a perfect
[41:27] love the devil didn't know and devil
[41:31] doesn't know
[41:34] now and my question
[41:37] is do you
[41:39] know I said the devil didn't know but do
[41:42] you
[41:46] know do you know what the devil didn't
[41:50] know are you with
[41:52] me I said the devil didn't know he said
[41:55] if
[41:58] if you be
[42:00] what if you
[42:02] be if you if you're God how many of
[42:06] y'all say God if you if you're real if
[42:09] you're this if you're
[42:12] that then Lord I want you to prove it to
[42:16] me prove it to me you sound
[42:22] like come
[42:25] on
[42:27] prove it to me Lord if if you does he
[42:30] have
[42:31] to does he need
[42:34] to God I want to know if you're real I
[42:36] want to know if
[42:40] you if you are then I want to
[42:44] know if you are God then tell
[42:48] me CU I want to know whether I need to
[42:51] serve you or whether I need to worship
[42:52] you or not but if you if you're real
[42:57] if it is if if it is a God then
[43:02] God the devil didn't
[43:06] know the Bible said the devil believed
[43:08] and his he trembles right and Legion
[43:11] said to Jesus I know who you are that's
[43:16] Son of God right but he turn here
[43:20] and you don't
[43:22] know then he said Paul I know Jesus I
[43:25] know
[43:27] son of Ste scha but who are
[43:32] you but I said the devil didn't know but
[43:36] I said do you know what the devil don't
[43:44] know I said creating an atmosphere of
[43:47] perfect love propably God said if we had
[43:50] perfect love then there would be a sick
[43:52] person can come through that door that
[43:54] wouldn't be healed
[43:58] are you with
[44:00] me now I was saying to Mar last night
[44:04] you might think that uh how can I have
[44:08] perfect love how how can I get
[44:12] it how do I how how can I be assured
[44:16] that I have perfect
[44:24] love I was telling them about a a
[44:28] minister down in Florida years
[44:30] ago and I was ministering on
[44:36] forgiving and I there's about 300 people
[44:40] there and years
[44:43] later a little white sister came up to
[44:46] me in a meeting years later and she says
[44:50] you are brother Simmons aren't you I
[44:53] said yes she says
[44:56] the meeting you spoke down in
[45:00] Florida at sister and sister a church
[45:03] years
[45:04] ago I knew it was a few hundred people
[45:06] there maybe two or 300 she says when you
[45:10] spoke that
[45:12] sermon on
[45:14] forgiveness she said I was suffering
[45:17] with migrain headaches for
[45:20] years and she
[45:23] said when you spoke it and you explain
[45:27] about
[45:29] forgiveness she said immediately I
[45:31] forgave and I didn't have my migrain
[45:35] headaches after that I was
[45:41] healed sometimes we are carrying sin
[45:45] around or
[45:49] unforgiveness
[45:51] around thinking that we were walking in
[45:54] Victory thinking that you you know
[45:56] things are just happening to us in our
[45:57] lives just happening so
[46:03] so but some things amen the devil can
[46:06] have access to you and bring things upon
[46:09] your body a lot of folk have hard
[46:12] trouble and different things because
[46:14] amen sometimes it we're dealing with
[46:18] forgiveness
[46:21] sometime people uh uh have the the Bible
[46:26] said men Hearts to fail because of
[46:30] fear but he says perfect love
[46:33] what cast out fear because fear has
[46:36] tormented fears of the what of the devil
[46:39] isn't that
[46:40] right so uh how can I have perfect love
[46:46] he's saying don't
[46:48] fear don't
[46:50] fear but how can I not fear when I I
[46:55] become a ustom to
[46:59] fear I get afraid
[47:02] easy but you telling me if I'm going to
[47:05] have perfect love then I can cast out
[47:11] fear
[47:13] okay so by the grace of
[47:16] God we we want to be lifted up and we
[47:19] want to walk out of hear not that the
[47:21] preacher got to lay his hands on us not
[47:23] that the preacher got to pray for us but
[47:26] we want to know what the devil don't
[47:31] know because if the devil
[47:34] knew what you
[47:40] know then he wouldn't be the
[47:46] devil
[47:48] okay but the devil is an adversary the
[47:51] Bible said the devil believe that
[47:52] there's one God but he
[47:54] trembles are you with
[48:00] me so often times people are going
[48:02] through certain problems certain
[48:05] conditions because they've been held
[48:08] captive in their minds and bondage in
[48:10] their
[48:12] minds they slaves in their
[48:17] minds something could happen to them in
[48:19] their childhood and they it they they
[48:22] build amen they build a a character
[48:26] surounding it becomes a stronghold in
[48:29] their life because they don't know how
[48:32] Amen to defeat uh uh get uh get rid of
[48:36] the pain get rid of the thing that
[48:38] happened to them in their childhood they
[48:41] don't know how to deal with
[48:44] it so they create amen a stronghold in
[48:49] their lives because amen they they don't
[48:52] know how to deal with the
[48:54] hurt
[48:58] and the pain that they go through so
[49:01] they relieve the pain over and over and
[49:03] over and over it's a
[49:08] recycle so they can't have perfect love
[49:10] because they only amen going through the
[49:14] hurt and pain and then sometimes they're
[49:16] able Amen to
[49:21] spread by talking amen h about the
[49:26] situation amen not that they got victory
[49:30] over it but they just constantly
[49:32] constantly talking about
[49:37] it it won't leave them
[49:41] alone neither will they leave it
[49:45] alone so it's a
[49:47] [Music]
[49:48] constantly I'm dealing with
[49:51] things that nobody knows about
[49:56] and nobody seems to understand what I'm
[49:59] dealing
[50:02] with I'm not going to tell anybody about
[50:05] it amen but it's deep down inside me and
[50:08] I can't get rid of the sting that keeps
[50:10] coming at
[50:14] me and I want to get victory over
[50:18] it we'll being H Le captain in our
[50:24] mind and with in bondage and we're
[50:27] slaves Amen to something that has
[50:29] happened to us in past
[50:34] tense and we become a
[50:37] victim in our minds we become the
[50:42] victim and we want everybody to see that
[50:46] I'm being
[50:49] victimized but it didn't start amen when
[50:54] you got 20 it didn't start when you got
[50:57] amen 30 it didn't start when you were 40
[51:00] it started in your
[51:05] childhood and it just grew up till it
[51:08] became mature enough to you think amen
[51:11] that everybody's against
[51:16] you and you don't know why I can't
[51:19] s Amen to have the things that I think I
[51:24] deserve
[51:26] are the things that I think I
[51:29] want why can't I have what others have
[51:33] and why can't I have the things that I
[51:36] know I
[51:38] deserve why am I
[51:41] being why am I going through what I'm
[51:43] going
[51:44] through why do I have to be the one to
[51:47] suffer the things I
[51:50] suffer when others seem to make it all
[51:53] right and I'm suffering
[51:58] why am I
[52:00] suffering why am I a victim of
[52:03] circumstances why what can anybody feel
[52:06] my pain can any anybody understand my
[52:13] hurt but we got to go back as the
[52:15] prophet said he had to go back to where
[52:18] it started
[52:21] it and see we don't want to relive it
[52:24] but we relive it all the time but
[52:26] because it has taken on another form it
[52:29] became M mature is not in his infant
[52:32] state but it's in its mature state it
[52:34] doesn't look like the same thing but it
[52:37] is the same thing it just
[52:42] grew because we didn't know how to deal
[52:44] with it then neither do we know how to
[52:47] deal with it now so the EAS way of
[52:50] dealing with it we passing on to
[52:52] somebody
[52:53] else my problem problem is uh everybody
[52:59] else everybody seem to be
[53:02] against a family against
[53:05] me amen I'm the job people against me
[53:09] everywhere I go to church against me
[53:12] everybody's against
[53:15] me how can I deal with
[53:19] that seem like I ought to be encouraged
[53:23] somebody ought to come by and Pat me on
[53:25] shoulder and understand my pain and
[53:28] understand my
[53:33] hurt sometimes when I'm sister came up
[53:36] to me last night she saids brother
[53:39] Simmons after you
[53:43] ministered about going through it over
[53:46] and over and relieving our
[53:50] pain she said I was so full she said I
[53:54] look good on the out side but inside
[53:57] I've been going over and
[53:59] over the same
[54:04] thing she said thank you thank you thank
[54:08] you I don't have to carry this no
[54:15] more I appreciate
[54:19] it
[54:22] so dealing with
[54:26] that you know something the devil does
[54:28] not
[54:29] know or didn't
[54:31] know he might have find out by
[54:36] now
[54:39] but he tried it on
[54:42] Jesus and the things that he tried on
[54:45] Jesus how many know he'll try the same
[54:48] thing on
[54:51] you but you got to see what Jesus did
[54:55] when he was tempted and
[54:57] tried and you got to turn around and say
[55:02] Amen that I amen can do what Jesus
[55:07] did because I got the same tube I got
[55:11] the same weapon that he
[55:13] got if he can handle the devil so can
[55:22] I hopefully I get to
[55:26] knowing creating an atmosphere of
[55:28] perfect
[55:33] love I hope you're going to be able to
[55:36] see what
[55:39] you when you can see you can learn how
[55:43] to conduct your
[55:45] lives in a different
[55:47] way because sometimes we conduct our
[55:50] lives in a
[55:52] manner that we think that we're
[55:54] conducting our Our Lives
[55:56] properly but understanding what we're
[56:02] doing the
[56:05] principle of the law of
[56:07] faith and understanding that if I use
[56:10] this law of faith it
[56:18] works so by the grace of
[56:22] God in Matthew 16
[56:31] 13 I went a whole lot faster there and I
[56:33] went 30 minutes and I
[56:35] quit I told him to stay tuned for next
[56:41] week so by the grace of God y'all be be
[56:44] careful because I'll be to go 30 minutes
[56:46] and I'll be in the middle of it and
[56:49] y'all going to have to catch me next
[56:50] week
[56:52] too okay so he said
[56:56] here when Jesus came to the course of
[56:58] CIS Philippi he asked his disciples
[57:04] whom saying whom do men say that
[57:08] what I the son of man am and they said
[57:12] some say that thou who John the Baptist
[57:16] and Eli and and
[57:20] others or
[57:22] what but he said unto them but
[57:27] whom say
[57:30] what see
[57:32] uh See even the disciples wasn't
[57:38] certain so he said let me let me wait a
[57:40] minute wait a minute I'm walking with
[57:43] you and you were following me and all of
[57:45] that but who who you who do you think I
[57:48] am so you coming to church and you're
[57:51] here and you're faithful you pray and
[57:53] all that but who do you say
[57:58] D I said the devil didn't
[58:02] know the disciples seem to be puzzled
[58:05] telling them what some
[58:07] say they say this and they say that
[58:13] huh mama said that Daddy said that
[58:16] preacher said this and that church said
[58:20] that but let me get a little
[58:23] person who do you say I
[58:28] am the devil said if
[58:31] you
[58:35] be so all of them look like they were
[58:38] just astonished why you going to get
[58:41] personal with
[58:44] us because seemed like if anybody should
[58:46] have known him they should have known
[58:48] who he
[58:49] was if anybody ought to know who Jesus
[58:53] is
[58:58] y'all understand if anybody ought to
[59:00] know who Jesus
[59:02] is
[59:04] huh who ought to
[59:07] know huh come on brother Fred what you
[59:10] say you ought to know he said I ought to
[59:16] know y'all
[59:18] scared if anybody ought to know who
[59:21] ought to
[59:23] know that's all said we I'm going get
[59:27] this thing person but he said whom do
[59:30] what who do you who do you say I
[59:36] am amen the devil wouldn't show who he
[59:41] was but he said who do you who do ye say
[59:45] that I
[59:50] am you know the reason why we in such a
[59:53] a spiritual mess
[59:57] and we can't get up and praise the Lord
[59:59] and be
[1:00:00] happy CU we ain't
[1:00:05] certain reason why we can't get the
[1:00:07] victory in our lives because we are
[1:00:11] ain't certain they walked with him they
[1:00:14] did miracles signs and wonders seen all
[1:00:17] of
[1:00:18] it but he said who do men say I am then
[1:00:23] he said who do you say I am
[1:00:32] huh I said uh 2 + 2 is three
[1:00:41] Josiah 2 + 2 is
[1:00:49] three 2+
[1:00:53] two you
[1:01:00] sure he said he positive how many agree
[1:01:02] with
[1:01:03] that y'all agree with him
[1:01:06] okay see what I'm saying when you
[1:01:09] show amen you got to be
[1:01:13] certain are you with me I just said it
[1:01:17] awake the children
[1:01:20] up they was with me the rest of the
[1:01:22] night down there
[1:01:25] okay so by the grace of God what
[1:01:28] happened here see except something
[1:01:32] happened in a supernatural realm they
[1:01:35] all would have
[1:01:36] been but they say this and they say that
[1:01:41] uhhuh we following him they one of them
[1:01:45] comes to Lord we found the
[1:01:49] Messiah you know what I'm saying and
[1:01:51] some dropped the necks and they left the
[1:01:54] ship and they followed him they left the
[1:01:56] tax elect they were fed him but it came
[1:01:59] the time amen even with all you
[1:02:03] left or you gave
[1:02:08] up still you're not able to discern
[1:02:12] enough to answer my
[1:02:15] question who do you say that I
[1:02:19] am going to church is not enough sing is
[1:02:24] not

[1:02:51] years know the scripture
[1:02:55] even tell and Jesus in the
[1:02:57] scripture are you with
[1:03:00] me but he didn't

[1:07:59] Factor one on the right hand and the
[1:08:02] other on the
[1:08:03] what then said Jesus
[1:08:07] father
[1:08:11] what
[1:08:13] see forgive them because
[1:08:18] what I said the devil didn't
[1:08:21] know oh yeah he he know what he did yeah
[1:08:25] they know they

[1:08:40] know somebody told brother simens and he
[1:08:43] was telling my business and he he told
[1:08:46] it over the P yet I know somebody told
[1:08:50] him brother erest told
[1:08:52] him

[1:09:07] the devil didn't know what make you
[1:09:09] think and they didn't

[1:09:26] this perfect
[1:09:30] love Crea out feere perfect
[1:09:33] love if you can't forgive you can't have
[1:09:37] this kind of
[1:09:41] love Jesus was our example how he said
[1:09:45] forgive them
[1:09:47] [Music]
[1:09:50] because I'mma I'm going get a little
[1:09:53] closer be a little bit more
[1:09:54] straightforward with y'all get take
[1:09:56] y'all a little further than I took m in
[1:09:59] this in the
[1:10:00] scripture so by the grace of God the
[1:10:04] reason people hold on to their pain and
[1:10:07] their hurt because they don't forgive
[1:10:10] because they think people meant to do
[1:10:12] what they did to
[1:10:17] them they meant to do it I know they did
[1:10:20] it they're always doing something to me
[1:10:27] you you know that and we are got enough
[1:10:32] people to gather around us and Pat you
[1:10:34] on the back you Pat that little boy on
[1:10:37] the back doing all that bad stuff and
[1:10:40] Mama come to schoolbody messing with my
[1:10:43] child the teacher Tak advantage of him
[1:10:46] Mama sat
[1:10:49] down go home and
[1:10:52] pray
[1:10:56] spare the rod Spa the
[1:10:58] tow is't that right no
[1:11:05] discipline are you with
[1:11:07] me taking up for them when they're
[1:11:11] wrong cuz it's your
[1:11:15] baby that's my
[1:11:21] baby are you with me
[1:11:24] some folk
[1:11:27] be you ha to see him cry yeah they did
[1:11:30] you wrong baby they did you wrong
[1:11:33] baby no forgive
[1:11:37] them cuz
[1:11:41] what can you hold them uh chargeable for
[1:11:45] doing something that they didn't know
[1:11:47] what they were
[1:11:50] doing are you with me when I look little
[1:11:53] child amen do something that you know uh
[1:11:58] that they shouldn't have done as a child
[1:12:00] they did it and you
[1:12:02] say goodness you spank them and said
[1:12:05] don't do that no more the spanking
[1:12:08] wasn't to hurt them it was to help
[1:12:12] them because they did something that was
[1:12:15] going to hurt them
[1:12:17] worse are you with
[1:12:20] me so you
[1:12:22] didn't tap them you
[1:12:25] know I a talking about doing like some
[1:12:28] of you
[1:12:35] crazy come on some of them cursing I I
[1:12:38] seen those Mama come in the sto cursing
[1:12:41] a little child little child about three
[1:12:43] years old you're talking oh boy they
[1:12:45] cursing and going on I said Lord have
[1:12:48] mercy what in the world don't take all
[1:12:50] of that so the child grow up trying
[1:12:55] traumatized and you send them to school
[1:12:57] all
[1:12:57] traumatized mama don't cuss them out
[1:13:00] daddy don't cuss them out you know what
[1:13:02] I'm
[1:13:05] saying I told you to
[1:13:10] stop get to school and teacher talking
[1:13:13] nice see they used to somebody holling
[1:13:16] and screaming and yelling and cussing
[1:13:19] and all so somebody said nice um
[1:13:22] students we like
[1:13:27] they they
[1:13:29] traumatized they're all messed
[1:13:32] up are you with
[1:13:34] me so by the grace of God I I mean that
[1:13:38] y'all understand where I'm
[1:13:39] at so what what goes on he said forgive
[1:13:44] them because they don't
[1:13:48] understand what they're
[1:13:51] doing but we can't have perfect love
[1:13:53] till we get the mindset of the one that
[1:13:56] God is what
[1:13:59] love
[1:14:01] amen God is love isn't that
[1:14:04] right and if you got God you got
[1:14:09] love are you with me the Holy Ghost is
[1:14:12] the love of God shed abroad in our
[1:14:14] hearts are you with
[1:14:17] me so what happens is that we got to
[1:14:21] learn that when somebody uh you know
[1:14:25] when something happens we got to learn
[1:14:28] how to deal with forgiving instead of
[1:14:33] in I'm I'mma get
[1:14:36] them I'mma tell everybody what they'
[1:14:38] done to
[1:14:40] me let everybody
[1:14:43] know that they did it to
[1:14:46] me I'mma get them
[1:14:50] back I remember and
[1:14:55] 19 come on
[1:14:58] somebody it's 2000 and something
[1:15:01] now but I got
[1:15:04] it I got it all in my memory
[1:15:10] bank are you with me some you got to let
[1:15:14] it
[1:15:15] go the folks dead and gone and you still
[1:15:19] holding on to
[1:15:21] it are you with me
[1:15:24] but they did me like that see you
[1:15:26] Carrying Your Pain
[1:15:28] still you still carrying your hurt and
[1:15:31] your pain because you letting it live on
[1:15:34] live
[1:15:35] on and it's going and you're passing it
[1:15:38] down the
[1:15:42] line somebody instead of saying give it
[1:15:47] up
[1:15:49] forgive and understand they wouldn't
[1:15:52] have done it if they knew what they were
[1:15:56] doing if they didn't know what they were
[1:15:58] doing why you holding against
[1:16:02] them they know what they were
[1:16:05] doing the devil didn't
[1:16:08] know they didn't
[1:16:11] know you think Jesus telling a
[1:16:14] lie
[1:16:16] huh what did he
[1:16:20] say read it again what did he say
[1:16:25] is he
[1:16:27] lying somebody lying in here you better
[1:16:31] go straight out all those lies you told
[1:16:33] on
[1:16:35] somebody brother brandom said people
[1:16:38] said the devil made me do it and they
[1:16:41] brother BR said the devil didn't make
[1:16:42] they do it they did it because they
[1:16:44] wanted to do
[1:16:45] it it was down desire that's why they
[1:16:47] did it you talking about the devil made
[1:16:50] me do it and Calvin said they said on
[1:16:52] the steps
[1:16:53] cry the devil said on steps outside
[1:16:56] crying so the people in the church lying
[1:16:58] on
[1:17:03] him and Prophet say the same
[1:17:06] thing he ain't said it like he said
[1:17:10] it but but by the grace of God y'all
[1:17:14] better stop and come on be
[1:17:17] real come on and see that God is
[1:17:19] requiring us to have perfect love but
[1:17:22] you'll never get
[1:17:24] it until you'll be willing to get rid of
[1:17:28] all those bad situations that you've
[1:17:30] been holding on to all your
[1:17:34] life but the Bible said whom the sun set
[1:17:37] free is what but you can't be free when
[1:17:40] you've been captive in your
[1:17:44] mind are you with
[1:17:46] me I got into some areas that I won't
[1:17:49] get into right here down the m
[1:17:54] see
[1:17:56] because but let me let me go one more
[1:18:00] um first excuse
[1:18:05] me the
[1:18:08] devil First Corinthians 2 chapter and
[1:18:11] then I'll just probably close the night
[1:18:14] I I probably almost went over my
[1:18:21] time and a verse I believe it
[1:18:25] is but let me let me see seventh
[1:18:29] verse second First Corinthians 2 chapter
[1:18:32] 7th
[1:18:33] verse everybody all
[1:18:36] right the devil didn't
[1:18:40] know but you
[1:18:42] still scared to shake hand with somebody
[1:18:45] scared to look him in the face cuz they
[1:18:47] done done you
[1:18:51] wrong I want nothing to do with
[1:18:56] them they better not said nothing to
[1:19:04] me I wonder if Jesus would have done us
[1:19:07] like
[1:19:10] that I'll slap
[1:19:15] him I'll slap him
[1:19:19] down you got some mean Christians in it
[1:19:24] they just be like
[1:19:27] Jesus

[1:19:57] God in a what mystery even the hidden
[1:20:01] wisdom which God ordained before what
