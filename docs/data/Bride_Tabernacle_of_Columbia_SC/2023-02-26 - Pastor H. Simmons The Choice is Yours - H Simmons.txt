Jesus Christ we pray amen Deuteronomy 30. time is winding up and it was old Brethren and well it's just the same his name was Grover Smith he said your time in my time he had a outstanding voice he was an elderly brother he said time is winding up people don't you feel like time is winding up that was 45 years ago when he used to sing that song well maybe your 40s a good 40 years or more ago time is winding up seriousness of the hour he said if thou on Deuteronomy 30 and 10 if thou shall hearken to The Voice of the Lord thy God to keep his Commandments and the statues which are written in the book of the law if thou turn unto the Lord thy God with what and with what the 19 I call Heaven and Earth to record this day against you that I have set before you what blessing and what therefore that both thou and what God bless the reasons words you may be seated and I was just praying I kind of change what I was going to bring and and his it's your choice this morning it's a lot of things as I was standing over needs and it's your choice it's something simple and may not be very long this morning but it's your choice thought about many uh mistaken and Confused we looked at God versus Satan that's true powers on the Earth but we seemed like we avoided of understanding we don't want to even think that there are two powers on the earth God and Satan we don't want to even acknowledge and sit down and just really consider the matter the day is good and that's evil but when it comes down to people they just take for granted I wake up and I do my thing today whatever I said in my heart to do I just do it not realizing that there's just something that controls us the days to whom you year your members to who you want to serve this morning and you got up and you made your mind up that you wanted to come to the house of the Lord maybe that's the routine maybe we didn't think that the thing that caused you to want to come to the house of the Lord was the spirit of the Lord you could have resist mom and dad you could have resist a husband a wife or any kind of influence but something cause you to come to the house of the Lord and I believe that that was the spirit of the Lord you made a choice you could have said I don't feel good I'm tired I'm weak you could have said you know not today but you made a choice and a decision that I'm gonna go I'm gonna go to God's house and I trust that you would know that that was the right decision that you may be the devil had put all kind of thoughts in your mind and all kind of things are set there for you but you made a choice but I said we ignore oh we don't want to come to grips that we make a choice and a decision whether we're going to serve the Lord or what are we gonna sir the devil some of us feel like that I'm not going to make a decision I'm just going to be in the middle of the road but look at somebody and tell them there's no middle ground there's no middle of the road you either on one side or the other you eat the servant the Lord oh you're serving the devil you're either on the Lord's Side or you're on the devil's side there's no middle of the road but we don't want to face when we look at the Devil he's the prince and the power of the air and he's the spirit did not worketh in the children of disobedience are you with me this morning it's a Powers two Powers which power controls your life which power do you want to control your life what is your desire what is your choice what is your decision have you made a decision are you just sitting around taking and performing and we just don't want to really face the fact we don't want to believe that this is a real that the children saying that one they're fighting they had a wall is that just a song that they sang you just sound good words or do they really realize the impact of what they're saying because nevertheless there's a devil that heard you and that Devil he's saying uh-huh but really whose side are we on whose side are we on brother and sister we got to make a decision in our mind and that to see the Lord if I'm on your side did I know you'll protect me I know you'll bless me he said I sat before you blessing and what mm-hmm your decision that you make will cause you to be blessed or they cause you to be curious yes that's good and there's evil for he said it was a tree in the garden was tree of knowledge of what so he there's something inside of us you know that wants to do the right thing that's the good sign but there's an evil sign that you have to fight that war that goes on within your mind that battle that we are constantly facing that we'll constantly in tune with this battle a will the will of God and the will of man or the will amen said there's a will then us there's a a deep call into the deep there's a will to do the right thing and there's a will to do the wrong thing that's a decision that I might want to Will you know I I want to please do I want to please myself or do I want to please God there's a there's something inside me to make that decision to make that choice who am I trying to please who do I want to please do I want to please in myself uh do I want to please God I have a decision to make a choice to make who who am I trying to please who am I do I want to impress man do I want to impress individuals or do I want the will of God to be done in my life see it's very easy to uh to impress folks but I want you to know that's a real adversary there's a real adversary the Bible calls the devil the average Siri Satan is our adversary he's our foe he's our enemy but is it is it your enemy is he really the your adversary is he really your enemy is that uh uh are you on his side have you yield yourself to that you are actually taking sides not with Jesus but taking sides with Satan because you fail to make a decision in your mind you fail to choose and make the right choice you just sat around and says well I'm gonna be neutral in this there's no neutrality you can't be neutral you just can't be in the middle amen you cannot serve two masters you either loved one and hate the other you have to make a decision and your decision that you make is determine whether you live or you die whether you're blessed or whether you curse whether you're in bondage or whether you're going to be free see because the devil will cause you to be in bondage everything the devil do for you is to hurt you if the devil make you feel good at the end it's gonna hurt if the devil seemed like he's causing things to go wonderful and lovely at the at the end of the road it's a crook in the road are you with me it's something that's going to come out and it ain't gonna come out so pleasant the Devil is a deceiver isn't that right and he's he he's very deceptive but you as a Believer you're not ignorant of Satan devices the devil will wow you he will trick you he will deceive you you must be aware of the Wiles of the devil but savings go in our little mind we don't want to come and contact in the reality of the thing we don't want to sat down and invigilize and realize that we have a real adversary we have two forces in the world and I must make a decision which force or which power or which one I'm going to believe you know he said behold I set before your life and death you choose set before you good and evil you choose as they were they had they made a choice in the Garden of Eden so you make your decision now what are you gonna what kind of decision have you made in Joshua 24 it came down to Israel approach to the promised land and they had to make a decision see sometimes we have to check up it comes down to a time that we have to check ourselves and we have to re-establish our faith in Christ Jesus and we have to confirm reaffirm our faith we have to take notice that amen where do I stand with God would I stand this morning have I evaluated my situation have I surveyed and have I uh gave overview did I look and what do I see in my life am I pleasing God is the will of God being wrought in my life am I just you know living now just wake up in the morning and I'm just going through my routine now I'm not really taking it serious I'm not really even worried about a thing because same as though um I I I got food I got a job I got this I got health and I got strength I'm not worried about a thing I'm not even considering I'm just taking everything for granted and that is the trick of the enemy the devil will have you to take life for granted my wife's little cousin died she was 16 years old I think she was battling cats and all kind of things she just died but you see what I'm saying you don't know when death's gonna meet you and then when her her cousin's uh I said Keisha was Monica is a name and my wife cousins her grandma died and uh she was probably by 80 or so anyway so that was two deaths in the family but you don't know he comes to get the old comes to get the you know you don't know when your time Gonna Come but one thing you could know where you're going if you happen to leave here where you going now you're going to make that decision now when I leave him where where am I going to end up whether I'm 16 or whether I'm 80. where am I going if God called me today where am I headed oh I mean we don't want to face that we don't want to make a decision we we just want to just wake up in the morning go through our routines and just live life but we don't want to evaluate hey God what is the will of God for me God said I sat before you this day good and evil I set before your life and death I said it before you okay so here in um Deuteronomy 24 and 15. uh Joshua excuse me Joshua 24. let's just do the 14. it says now therefore fill the Lord and serve him in what that's what a lot of people are not sincere a lot of Christians preachers deacons trustees musicians singers just members loyalty not to sincere see when you can when you're sincere you're giving that extra consideration you're giving that carefulness about things you know you you take it more to Heart but when you're not sincere about your Christian Journey the angel of the Lord told the property he got to be more sincere with all the miracle signs and Oneness that was done in this ministry yet he had to be more sincere if God uses a vessel like that and yet he had to be more sincere what about you and I when it comes down to our journey in this life and where we want to go into the promise of a rapture don't you think that God is one more sincerity out of us that we need to be more sincere about our Christian walk consider it brother he said that you fear the lord now he just didn't leave it there he said sir the Lord in sincerity and in what and in truth sincerity sometimes you hear people just just talking and just taking for granted just Christians you know like the daisy Christian you know I'm a Christian and it's just you know sometimes we just you know Christian by mouth but by action what is action is that in all thy ways what acknowledge Him sometimes we're forget you know forget to pray you know forget to bless our food get together Pray when we get in the car we get to pray whether you know um you know go before we go to work forget to pray and forget you know but when you're sincere and you checked up and you prayed up it just seemed like you you're more watchful you're more careful of what is saying how you conduct your life but if you're not sincere you're kind of loose you're saying things that you didn't know you said because the devil got your mouth do things that you you know you were doing you didn't even know you did it you just did it but when you're sincere about it you're trying to Be watchful and trying to be prayerful see a lot of times the part of being watched for the part of being prideful about your walk you remember the times of your walk and your spiritual walk you you always said if the Lord's will somebody said can you do this can you do that you said yes if it's the Lord's will but you said well yeah I'm gonna do so and so on if it's the Lord's will you know what I'm saying you almost didn't even open your mouth unless you said if the Lord's will you know what I'm saying there's always if it's the will of the Lord because you knew that you could you don't control things are you with me so you always dependent on whether it be the will of the Lord or not but if it wasn't the will of the Lord you didn't want to do it are you a man but sometimes we ignore whether or not it's the will of the Lord or not we just think if if it looked good if it tastes good if it feel good then it's good you know he said it tastes good it felt good and it was good good enough that I want Adam to have some are you with me you look good it tastes good you know what I'm saying So Adam you know and they and all I mean y'all see what I'm saying a lot of things that look good feel good and look like a blessing might not be the God will as God's servant said we try to do God a service without it being his will would it please God I know to please us sometime but is it going to please God it's just God's plan for you I I mean it might be for somebody else but it is it for you that God is just what you want me to have I don't care what they got is whether or not what God wants you to have are you with me and if God wants you to have it you say God let your will be done are you a bear and then if you pray Earnest and sincerely about the will of God now if it's the will of God then it's going to be to the what glory of God it's going to glorify not you it's going to glorify him so in everything God blesses you with it's uh it's a testimony it's a testament that I want to tell amen I'm going to lift it up and say God you know I thank the Lord for Joshua said Daddy did you know that most of the Saints a lot of the young people had honors and then in the Urban League was calling their names did you know all of these people a little bright Tabernacles really represented I said well no they didn't tell me Well thank the Lord that they were well represented with all these honors are you up now so uh but it's a testament that they could be honored you know what I'm saying and it's a blessing that they could you know represent Jesus Christ and this little assembly amen so by the grace of God I'm glad for each and every one of them you know what I'm saying and uh so a body grace of God and that just shows you you know God if you just you do what God says God will bless you are you with me but you use it not to just that an Urban League can recognize you but that you can represent Jesus Christ to the public are you with me so I want you to use everything that God blesses you with as a a way and a means of letting the light shine on Jesus Christ Let Jesus get the glory out of all the blessings that he gives to you give God the glory are you with me but don't use it you know I I I'm gonna make more money you know this is me and this is mine no no no no it's what God bless you with is to give him glory are you with me choices sincerely in truth and he said and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt are you with me and Sir ye what serve you the Lord the 15th verse and if it seemed what even to you Lord serve the Lord choose what I said the choice is yours and today I said I was going to be shocked now I might cut off in a minute the choice is yours are you with me the decision you make today you know I thank God for these young people representing but the choice is yours are you with me the choice is yours whether or not you're going to represent Jesus Christ in the light of a Christian wall I had some testimonies in some young people and some of the young sisters never wore uh uh uh pants always will address the school the young man came to church one night and he says I'm looking for a certain young sister and it's probably five or six years out of school he said a girl that wrote a dress all the time didn't know she was wearing pants now you know and he but he was looking for her see the light had shined she represented oh you're a man now she might have been going through her struggles but by the grace of God she represented then and the young man you know years after people remember that your light shine oh you're whipping what you what you what kind of light or what kind of influence you want to have on young people in your school what kind of influence have you with everybody else is rocking and rolling and they're doing things that against the Lord Jesus Christ what choice would you make when you face somebody said face the music when you're faced with it what choice would you make are you with me I'm glad that here Joshua said choose you to say who whom you would serve whether the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood other God are the gods of the amorites and whose land you dwell but as for what we were what you made a decision I'm gonna serve the Lord and I'm gonna tell you something it is sometimes it don't look like it's gonna it's gonna be easy matter of fact the devil make you look real real real real difficult it's easy to you know to do the things that's going to please the devil and make it easy for you to do the things that's wrong and nobody gonna give you a hard time and you know they call you all kind of names you know some of the things uh I remember my Sons used to go through young people calling them all kind of stuff and you know I'm gonna tell you people will pick at you call y'all kind of names as a young Christian young girl you go through things people are despise you and put pressure on you you go through things then you got to make a decision Lord if I suffer as a Christian as a Christian then he said happy are you are you with me but you got to make that decision do you want to do it see if you don't want to do it it makes it 10 times harder when you don't want to do it and one day you're gonna break the cycle One Day You're Gonna you're gonna uh-uh when it becomes so hard sometimes it's gonna be unbearable for you to do but he said my yoke is easy and my bird of his life see God once you make a decision for the Lord then God will take the load that heavy logo the burdens he said cast all your what your burden your cares upon me because I care for you I'ma tell you God said greater is he that's what see your decision that you make calls an inward power to be inside you to give you the ability to walk to Walk and to live the life see it's because of the decision that you make calls the spirit of God to come down in The Believer to give them amen that you don't walk by your own might or your own strength or your own ability because you made a decision Lord I want to please you and because you want to please God and not yourself and not the world not the devil amen God gives you the strength whatever your face or whatever your battle is he said I'll never leave you and I'll never I'm gonna tell you when you get in some tough places the devil sure will leave you now he sure will forsake you I I'm gonna tell you some friends to leave you friends will forsake you amen praise God sometimes mama will do it and daddy will do it and sister and brother would do it but God said I was I never leave you and I won't forsake you but I'll be with you praise God Amen when you're going through trouble I'll be there you go through sickness I'll be there when you look like you're all alone I I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you know anytime you need me call me I'll be there come on I know y'all know I'll be there amen praise God now don't don't don't let them tell you that you know they ain't gonna be there now now you know y'all didn't know that you know I heard that gotta be there are you with me the right one gonna be there not the other one but God would be there for you are you with me so as I close in this last verse uh 11 and 25 Hebrews 11 25. it talks about Moses in the 24th verse he said by faith Moses when he was coming to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's
