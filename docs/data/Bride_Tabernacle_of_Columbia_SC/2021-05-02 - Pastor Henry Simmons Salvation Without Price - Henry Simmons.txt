good he he's been to us then we would be super excited about the goodness of the lord i believe david had experienced his goodness [Music] but he said surely goodness and mercy should follow me all the days of my life [Music] and he said old taste and see that the lord he is good isaiah 55 says oh everyone hold everyone that thirsts come ye to the water he that has no money come ye buy eat yay come buy wine milk without money without price wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfied not heart and diligent to me and eat ye that which is good and let your soul delight itself in fatness incline your ear and come unto me here and what here and what are you listening here and your what and i will make an everlasting covenant with you even the sure mercies of david god bless you read this word you may be seated by the grace of god we thank god for his grace this morning i heard god's servant speak on salvation without price salvation without price so we like to share because you know even the folks that said they saved seem as though they have a lack of understanding a lack of love for god and we have those that choose not to be saved as the prophet god says they reject salvation they're rejected they don't want it don't want to be saved and those that supposedly understand and supposed to be saved their very life is an evident and a proof that they're not so you got those that are uh don't want to be saved those that claim to be saved then you've got those that are really truly saved as he said they're three kind of believers you have to make believers you have the unbelievers and you have the true believers are you with me well we find that seemed like in a lukewarm age as layout of syria is that you have more make-believers a individual don't mind cursing you out and at the same time when they finish say god bless you brother seems like there's a lack of understanding of concerning salvation it seems like folk don't get it no more oh how we long to see individuals that would really give their life to the lord jesus christ and accept salvation that without price and free salvation how we long to see that hunger and thirsty soul oh those that thirst they meant come and buy but it got it's got to be that thirst and i'm going to tell you brother and sister amen jesus said no man can come to me except the father my father drawing and i'm saying that thirst that thirsty soul that individual that really desire amen not church amen you know sometimes folks just looking for uh a nice place to worship uh they're looking for friendship on the different things that folks are looking for but salvation i'll tell you i long to see people that'll want god now i long to see people that want to let god know they appreciate him you know it's coming so cold outside they mean the pandemic has taken its effect on the event church well and so people look like they're lost enthusiasts you know when you don't have face to face and you know and get a chance to fellowship like we used to but it seemed like people have the bible said the love of many gonna watch coal people have cooled off so much so there's no lord it's jar to have true worship anymore people don't decide or you know you know come together because they can i can make it without it the bible says we see the evil day and we see uh approaching we ought to come together even more well we know the pandemic that put the brakes on a lot of folks a lot of folks know or amen they want to come or they they they've being hindered some folks are scared i mean i i'm not dealing with that but i i feel as though that it's not just that i believe there that there there are uh uh millions of demons that's trying to hinder the bride for fulfilling what the word said she would be that you know as as those spirits was let loose on the jews to kill six million those spirits are let loose on the bride and if if those demons could do the jews like they did them what about in the spiritual realm the attack that those demons are having on the church on the bride of jesus christ because many folks the devil already got he don't mind you singing you don't mind you're dancing he don't mind you or he may preaching but amen but when it's for real when they see your relationship and amen that you really got god amen the devil knows the difference amen if you really love god the devil knows the difference yes amen amen there's something about all that lip service amen all the lip service but your heart is far from me amen god understand that you can talk about amen hallelujah i was saying you know don't count to chickens before they hatch on friday night a lot of people amen they they're actually talking about something that they don't know nothing of they're talking about a god that they have not had now i'm not going to mind you you remember goliath and you remember saul and the whole army of israel amen all them with the same church they watching the same god but they didn't have there was no match for goliath but goliath was saying to david i'm gonna you know what he was gonna do today that david said they're gonna i'm gonna have your head amen i'm gonna tell you something it's many folk trying to go up against goliath but they are shaking in their shoes oh i know god i know i i'm a warrior i'm decked down with all the armor that i need but amen but there was an invisible army armor that david had that they could not see because they tried to put on david the things that they will use to fight men i'ma tell you what even david fought with it was not what the rest of israel was fighting with amen and what you are the bride of christ fighting with is not what the rest of the church world is fighting with praise god amen david had just said the lord amen and he he had an experience you know i was uh praying and i said i you know in my spirit i said we got to be battle tested amen you gotta you gotta go through some things before you start talking too much amen you gotta you may have experienced something before you start bragging so much oh bragging about god can't live nothing amen think that god is their god and they don't live nothing praise god the devil laughing at him oh yes they can pray brother i pray you and live like the devil brother and sister you know you get tired of that salvation is without price it is not lord have mercy you know it's something to get in your spirit to see that amen when we when we think we we know what we're doing and have no idea i remember a demon possessed person came and i i i i i i had brothers that could tell you all the abc's about the devil i said go and cast them out then i said to myself i'm i'm tired of all that talk i know you don't know what you're talking about but it sounds good because you can really lay it out scripturally oh yes you know all about it oh it's marvelous what you're saying but when it comes down to battle testing when the devil's standing there in your face what a practice need deliverance and you can't produce [Applause] that's right see what happens amen there's so many people confessing and not possessing confessing to be real christian real soldiers in the army of the lord and they can talk to talk but they can't walk the walk when they're faced with the enemy they run brother and sister you got to get down to where you know god in a real way when you're truly saved and and you know you're saved 94 ninety-five percent of the people questioning their salvation ain't shown preachers they ain't sure ah no no and they use the schools none of us are perfect i'm talking about what you say but now salvation is without price what are you saying if you're not saved why aren't you saying it's free you don't have to pay for it why don't you want to be saved i don't know come on the devil got all kind of things he offering you that you even got to pay for amen that's right and it won't satisfy your soul amen amen all our money out of my pocket even for the pledges of the world for a season we'll break the bank the salvation is free and all we got is to thank we got i think we say think we got the holy ghost think that we know god [Music] but truly do you really know him do you really love him amen your very life is a proof of your love for him are you with me your very action manifests how much you love god are you with me because [Music] is rotten to the core praise god let me skip over some of these things because i i i i i i i long to see folk that hunger for god folk that are thirsty oh this is ghosting for the living god folk that i want that water of life i want the spirit of god amen i want i want the love of god i want the joy that the world can't take away praise god amen there's no use in slipping and sliding amen you got to come on and be real and let your life be an open book for all things are naked and open before the eyes of him of whom we have to do praise god it's no use in playing games we got to get down to blindness lord i know the wages of sin is death amen but i'm not worried about death what i'm saying salvation is without price but the gift of god that's what i want amen praise god because i know there'll be a wrecking time there'll be a time when you're going to collect you're going to reap and amen the chat the final check your paycheck amen that's the prophet saying you'll find a paycheck at the end of the road would it be eternal damnation is that what you want because of your sin that's the kind of life you live okay by the grace of god let's go to luke 16. salvation is without christ brother and sister we're coming down to this in the end of the road brother and sister i got to give a count to god one day for what i preach amen whether i gave it all i got was i played games with you amen praise god whether i looked at amen praise god you know it's an individual journey and i got to make sure amen that i'll tell you the truth amen because if i don't tell you the truth i'm going to be accountable to god amen i don't want you to think that you've got something that you don't have i don't want you to play this ain't no play play church where people come and play play we're not running games all that hooping and hiding and ain't living nothing praise god we gotta get more serious about this we gotta get more serious about god praise god it's got to be serious yes amen some things we pity pat with the devil we play around with the devil we play around with life itself amen and not knowing that you're in a war and the devil is scheming all the time and folks that are calling it [Music] can two walk together say they agree please amen come on my standards for you i can't come down where you are out of a harbor pit look at the wreck of my life that i was in the ditch that i was in he pulled me out of that ditch he pulled me out of that pin of sin brother and sister amen i'm glad i'm uh i'm not letting folk take me back down that road amen amen oh yes if you want to be in the ditch you're going to stand [Applause] [Music] [Applause] are with jesus [Music] [Music] i don't know when my time comes but i want to be ready amen i i want to be like paul i want to fight a good fight amen i want to finish my course and i want to say i'm not sure to decline to you the whole council of god amen i want to tell you what god's saying praise god you may not like me you may not love me you may want me to stop but i can't stop raises not to the swim battle not to the strong amen [Music] sometimes we think amen because you're strong amen that you're all right but you got to be able to hold out to the end you got to endure all the way to the and end you can't stop in the middle you got to go all the way 99 and a half won't do you got to make 100. 16. luke 16 19. there was a certain man rich i'm gonna tell you that's all rich but salvation is without price doesn't

free you can't buy amen amen don't mind how i support the church no they got nothing to do with god salvation is free what you give amen there's no blessing to give them to receive god we're going to give back to you isn't is that right so you're not giving god something that god ain't giving back to you and you got nothing to give and said god gave it to you are you with me so what you give amen salvation is what with that price it's free you can't pay for it amen oh lord so he said a rich man certain rich man now i'm going to tell you something you might put a certain rich man some of these

they they really are fair presumptuous they really got it going on brother and some of people are wooed to amen that eye contact they want to style and file and they want to look good there's nothing wrong with god beautifying the meek with salvation but they want the beauty and the oh attachment of the world they want to look like the world they want to act like the world they want to live like
