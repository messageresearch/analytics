[35:59] god is so good to us
[36:05] exodus 14 and
[36:08] we'll begin at the first verse
[36:12] we can go down to let's let's just start
[36:15] at the fifth verse
[36:17] by the grace of god you got it say amen
[36:21] and it reads and it was told the king of
[36:23] egypt that the people fled in the heart
[36:25] of pharaoh and of his servants was
[36:27] turned again was turned against the
[36:28] people and they said
[36:30] why why have we done this that we have
[36:34] let israel go from serving us and he
[36:36] made ready his chariot and took his
[36:38] people with him and he took 600 chosen
[36:42] chariots and all the chariots of egypt
[36:45] and captains over every one of them you
[36:46] may be seated
[36:48] we'll read down a little further
[36:51] and a verse says and the lord hardened
[36:54] the heart of pharaoh king of egypt and
[36:56] he pursued after the children of israel
[36:58] and the children of israel went out and
[37:00] with a high hand but the egyptians
[37:02] pursued after them
[37:04] all the horses and chariots and pharaoh
[37:07] and his horsemen and and his army and
[37:10] overtook them came camping by the sea
[37:13] beside
[37:14] pirates
[37:16] before base upon
[37:18] and when pharaoh drew now the children
[37:20] of israel lifted up their eyes and
[37:22] behold the egyptians marched after them
[37:24] and they were so afraid and the children
[37:27] of israel cried unto the
[37:29] unto the lord and they said unto moses
[37:32] because there were no graves in egypt
[37:35] thou has taken us away to die in the
[37:37] wilderness wherefore thou has dealt thus
[37:40] with us to carry forth out of egypt it's
[37:42] not just a word that we did tell thee
[37:44] saying let us alone we may serve the
[37:46] egyptians for it had been better for us
[37:48] to serve the egyptians than
[37:52] that we should die in the wilderness and
[37:54] moses said unto the people fear ye not
[37:58] stand still and see the salvation of the
[38:00] lord which he shall show to you today
[38:03] for the egyptians whom you have seen
[38:05] today you shall see them again no more
[38:07] forever the lord shall fight for you and
[38:11] ye shall hold your peace
[38:13] and the lord said unto moses wherefore
[38:15] christ die unto me speak to the children
[38:17] of israel that they go forth lift up the
[38:20] rod and stretch out thine hand over the
[38:22] sea and divide it and the children of
[38:24] israel shall go on dry ground through
[38:25] the midst of the sea
[38:27] and i behold and i behold our heart in
[38:30] the hearts of the egyptians and they
[38:32] shall follow them and i will get my
[38:33] honor upon pharaoh and upon all his
[38:35] hosts upon his chariots and his horsemen
[38:38] and egyptians shall know that i am the
[38:40] lord when i have gotten
[38:41] me honor upon pharaoh and his chariots
[38:43] and upon his horsemen an angel of god
[38:46] which went before the camp of israel
[38:48] moved and went behind them and the
[38:50] pillar of cloud went before their face
[38:53] and and stood behind them and it came
[38:55] between
[38:56] the camp of the egyptians in the camp of
[38:58] israel and there was a cloud of darkness
[39:00] to them but it was it gave light by
[39:03] night to these so that one
[39:06] uh came not near the other
[39:09] all night and moses stretched out his
[39:10] hand over the sea and the lord calls the
[39:12] sea to go back by strong east wind all
[39:16] that night and made the sea dry land and
[39:18] the waters were divided may god bless
[39:21] you reading of his word again
[39:22] well it's kind of lengthy reading
[39:24] but i just wanted to just read that part
[39:27] and tonight by the grace of god i just
[39:29] want to speak to you for a moment on on
[39:32] be still amen
[39:34] a little something how moses was here
[39:37] here and
[39:38] and you know how the people were
[39:39] frightened and they were afraid but you
[39:42] know i want to say that you know we've
[39:43] been blessed this week amen
[39:46] i want to say that because i'm still
[39:48] kind of in that framework i was telling
[39:51] my in-laws last night that
[39:53] you know it was such a blessing i would
[39:55] say that to me i i know i caused me to
[39:58] repent myself
[40:00] and go over my life and look at gave me
[40:03] a whole new outlook on on things amen
[40:06] and i pray that it did the same thing
[40:07] for you as well
[40:09] because that's what it is you know i
[40:11] believe god is about a god of change
[40:14] and wants you to change your ways the
[40:16] thing is the word when it come out
[40:18] sometimes we look at it for others but
[40:20] the word comes to you
[40:23] you know god sends the word to you
[40:25] so you can examine yourself
[40:27] and change your ways i thank god because
[40:30] god what he does he loves to critique us
[40:33] don't he
[40:34] and not not just just to be a super
[40:36] critic but he does those things because
[40:38] he wants to perfect us
[40:40] he wants you to be able to walk in in
[40:43] perfect uh peace he wants you to be at a
[40:45] walkman when he see he says you know be
[40:48] thou perfect as your father in heaven is
[40:50] also perfect well that we can't get in
[40:52] that perfection within ourselves but
[40:55] what it is our perfection will come
[40:57] uh
[40:58] by spirit coming in you but it'll be the
[41:00] word
[41:01] the word manifesting
[41:03] itself through you will bring about that
[41:06] perfection do you believe that tonight
[41:08] but you got to let the word work on you
[41:10] you got to let the word have its way in
[41:13] your life
[41:14] you can't shun this part in that part
[41:16] come on but no matter when the word
[41:18] comes you got to let you got to let the
[41:20] word have its way in your life
[41:22] you got to take that word and let it
[41:24] live in you how many feel like doing
[41:26] that tonight
[41:27] but i says that you know we we've been
[41:29] blessed and i thank the lord just for
[41:32] spirit and the power sometimes like say
[41:34] it ain't all in the deepness of things
[41:37] but it's in the simplicity of the gospel
[41:40] you know the prophet god talked about
[41:41] that about one's place he was saying
[41:44] about the holy ghost and how when you
[41:47] preach the gospel and simplicity that's
[41:49] when the holy ghost will fall
[41:51] when the gospel is preached until that
[41:53] is in that way and that's what jesus did
[41:56] when he walked the earth what he did he
[41:58] didn't come as many as would think is
[42:01] now to the scribes in the pharisees he
[42:02] might have said certain things to them
[42:05] but he preached it until such a simple
[42:07] way that the children could understand
[42:09] it and they can reach out and it gave
[42:10] them a hope to do something in their
[42:12] lives and i said god that's how the
[42:14] gospel should come the gospel comes
[42:17] hallelujah to correct don't it
[42:20] i thank god for that tonight don't you
[42:21] thank god for that tonight
[42:23] come on i pray that something i pray
[42:26] that i didn't want to say that tonight i
[42:27] pray that something changed you
[42:31] changed your your whole outlook
[42:34] on on your christian journey
[42:36] hallelujah but we find that i said here
[42:39] tonight about being still you know it's
[42:42] something about here israel at the red
[42:44] sea and and you know i read all that to
[42:47] just show how you know how in uproar
[42:49] they were and how you know it must have
[42:52] been a frightening place
[42:54] that they were in i'd say probably a
[42:56] place like the world is in today a
[42:59] frightening place a place where they're
[43:01] afraid
[43:03] afraid of what's going to happen
[43:04] tomorrow afraid of the sicknesses afraid
[43:06] of the earthquakes afraid of the wars
[43:08] you know stuff stirring up all over the
[43:10] world ain't it looked at the world
[43:12] leaders and everybody's is in a
[43:14] frightening state you know and that's
[43:16] what it is you know when you frightened
[43:19] and when fear comes upon you sometimes
[43:21] you'll say and do things that you don't
[43:23] really mean
[43:24] you say you don't really mean them but
[43:25] that's what was in your heart that what
[43:27] was in you the whole time and it came
[43:28] out through fear didn't it so we find
[43:31] that i says you know you know we see
[43:33] that these people uh of that day they
[43:36] were frightened and all those things and
[43:39] uh you know but the one thing first
[43:41] thing moses began to do after all the
[43:44] miracles they had seen after all the
[43:46] mighty works and how god had brought
[43:48] them out and yet they in this point of
[43:51] time when it looked like the whole world
[43:54] was coming down on them and looked like
[43:55] it might have been the end then fear
[43:58] began to grip them and all these things
[44:00] and i wanted to read something that you
[44:02] know i was looking up something on
[44:04] worriation
[44:05] because and i said it i found something
[44:08] in interesting it says you know
[44:10] variation is an exceedingly amount of
[44:12] worries that are now worsened because
[44:15] you are in a situation that is only
[44:17] getting worse
[44:18] that it originally
[44:20] was because you failed
[44:22] to let a grudge of some kind go
[44:26] and i thought about that
[44:28] i said how can somebody put those two
[44:30] together
[44:31] but they said a lot of times that's
[44:32] where a lot of your worriation and stuff
[44:34] come from it's something working down on
[44:37] the inside of you he says it started
[44:39] from a grudge of some kind that you
[44:40] failed to let go
[44:42] and that person began to talk about you
[44:44] got to go and make that thing go and get
[44:46] that thing right come on and that's what
[44:48] it is i was speaking with someone today
[44:51] you know they're going through heavy and
[44:52] i was saying you know our faith is in
[44:55] god
[44:56] and we know that god is the deliverer
[44:58] and i says but sometimes what we got to
[45:00] do within ourselves is is check
[45:02] ourselves up you know look we're deep
[45:05] within ourselves and make sure that
[45:07] everything is clear all your channels is
[45:08] clear
[45:09] make sure everything is right with god
[45:11] and if it ain't right make those things
[45:13] right
[45:14] then you gotta advocate with the father
[45:16] then you'll be able to stand out there
[45:18] on faith and watch god move amen
[45:21] so we find that i says that you know
[45:23] they were at that state of worriation
[45:24] you know frightened all these things but
[45:27] moses began to tell them you know like
[45:29] we said moses began to say to him stand
[45:32] still
[45:33] and that's what we want to talk about
[45:34] like we said tonight being still
[45:36] it's something about that stillness
[45:39] it's something about that quiet place
[45:41] like i was sharing with the church the
[45:42] other day i said sometimes you know we
[45:45] love the jumping and shouting but you
[45:47] get your major breakthroughs in those
[45:49] that quiet place
[45:51] i said sometimes when you find yourself
[45:53] in a lot of trouble or a lot of
[45:55] worriation a lot of things going on i
[45:57] said sometimes you got to get your key
[45:59] to the church and come out to the church
[46:01] sometimes you got to get in your prayer
[46:03] closet when ain't nobody else around
[46:05] sometimes you might can't get that so
[46:07] you got to get up two or three o'clock
[46:09] in the morning
[46:10] when it's real quiet i said sometimes
[46:12] you got to get in your car and ride down
[46:14] to the laker to the river come on uh why
[46:17] you say that because i've done it before
[46:19] and just go out there and get quiet
[46:21] somewhere
[46:22] and talk it over with god it ain't that
[46:24] you just going just to get away but
[46:26] you're going for a purpose because you
[46:27] want to talk it over with god
[46:29] you know i believe jacob had to do that
[46:32] didn't he he separated himself from all
[46:34] his family and all that because he was
[46:36] at a frightening place at his life
[46:38] all of his troubles was coming down on
[46:40] him wasn't he so he had to get to a
[46:42] place by himself i believe he had to get
[46:44] to that quiet place that place when he
[46:46] separated himself on the other side of
[46:49] the roof hallelujah then he began to
[46:51] wrestle with the angel but it says you
[46:53] got to get to that quiet place what is
[46:55] that quiet place is about standing still
[46:58] and letting god move
[47:00] standing still and letting god work in
[47:02] your life
[47:03] and you know i find that i says you know
[47:06] i was thinking about you know some
[47:08] things that that that um
[47:10] that uh you know i was faced with last
[47:13] month was kind of a rough month last
[47:15] month
[47:16] you know with the face infections i was
[47:19] having and
[47:20] had it twice and then right in the midst
[47:23] of all that got sick got covered they
[47:26] told me you had covered and all that and
[47:27] the doctor told me that this is what's
[47:29] most likely wrong with you but when i
[47:31] left out of the doctor's office the
[47:33] second time i got the infection
[47:35] i began to say to myself lord they don't
[47:38] know what's wrong with me
[47:40] they said we don't know why your body
[47:41] seemed like you ain't trying to fight it
[47:43] off i said god they don't know what's
[47:44] wrong
[47:45] i said but god we know that what it is
[47:48] is demons
[47:49] you know the devil is a tormentor and
[47:51] that's what he come to do to torment you
[47:53] come on
[47:54] but god come to give you peace don't he
[47:57] so no matter what name it's like the
[47:59] prophet god's saying about it being a
[48:00] germ no matter what name or what all
[48:02] they give it remember it ain't nothing
[48:04] but a demon
[48:06] it's a devil that come to torment you
[48:08] so when the doctors i said to myself
[48:11] when i got in the car they don't know
[48:12] what's wrong with me
[48:13] but i began to say lord it's all in your
[48:16] hands
[48:17] and god i'm trusting you this is where
[48:21] this is where god uh
[48:23] getting us that's where he got us and
[48:25] that's where you know i said lord i
[48:27] don't have they don't when they don't
[48:28] they don't know what god i say lord what
[48:31] else can i do
[48:32] i believe it scripture said it like this
[48:34] to whom shall we go
[48:37] where where else we gonna go lord
[48:39] hallelujah but the trust in you
[48:42] so i thought about that and i was home
[48:44] by myself and i thought about this the
[48:46] whole little sermon about being still
[48:48] come on quiet time with god home whole
[48:51] week by yourself time to do what talk it
[48:53] over
[48:54] think it over with god going through
[48:56] pain
[48:57] remember laying in the bed and all i
[48:59] could say was jesus i need your help god
[49:02] i need your help
[49:03] i like how moses began to tell him he
[49:06] said stand still
[49:08] and see the salvation of the lord he
[49:10] goes on to tell him god gonna fight for
[49:12] you
[49:13] come on i begin to say lord i need your
[49:15] help come on god i need you to fight for
[49:17] me how many need god to fight for on the
[49:20] night and that's what it's about
[49:22] come on
[49:23] you all in a word frightening worried
[49:25] about it come on what's gonna happen
[49:27] next what's gonna happen tomorrow god
[49:28] gonna fight for you
[49:31] sometimes he got to tell us stand still
[49:34] sometimes he got to let something happen
[49:36] to you to get you still
[49:38] get you to that place the way you can't
[49:40] you can't get up out of bed you can't go
[49:42] here you can't do that all you can do is
[49:44] lay there and call on the name of jesus
[49:46] you say how do you know it just happened
[49:48] to me hallelujah but i got there and i
[49:51] thank god because god settle you down
[49:54] and let you know i'm gonna take care of
[49:55] the infections i'm gonna take care of
[49:57] this come on be still i'ma fight for you
[50:01] these things that's tormenting you
[50:03] come on
[50:04] some people got stuff tormenting them
[50:07] tormenting them

[50:11] tormenting them
[50:12] where they can't smile hallelujah
[50:15] but god want to fight for you
[50:17] he said be still hallelujah
[50:20] but we find that i says what it is

[51:03] let's bind this devil up hallelujah and
[51:06] let god fight for us how many want to do
[51:09] that tonight
[51:10] but i i says you know what it is we find
[51:12] that i says about being still getting to
[51:14] that uh
[51:15] to that quiet place you know i thought
[51:17] about this little song
[51:19] and it says
[51:20] in a little song and i know many of you
[51:22] probably heard it i wrote down says this
[51:24] time
[51:26] i will be still and the mountain has to
[51:28] move
[51:29] said the mountain
[51:31] must obey the words that you speak and
[51:34] give away to your faith
[51:36] because
[51:38] it says that that you've got a job to do
[51:41] god give you a job to do and you got to
[51:43] see it through come on god showed you
[51:45] the way and you need to choose it today
[51:49] what's the way that god chose shows you
[51:51] come on god showed you the way he said i
[51:53] am the way hallelujah the truth and the
[51:56] life didn't he say that
[51:57] no man coming to the father but by me
[52:00] god showed you the way come on choose it

[52:04] we choose everything else but the way
[52:06] that god has given us
[52:08] come on i said god when you're in pain
[52:12] when you're hurting
[52:13] hallelujah and nobody can't help you
[52:17] you got no other options
[52:18] hallelujah you'll choose god then
[52:21] you'll choose to let it go
[52:24] that thing
[52:25] like they said that grudge you'll choose
[52:26] to let it go in hallelujah because you
[52:29] need help
[52:30] hallelujah pharaoh's army's behind you
[52:33] see in front of you crying out for fear
[52:36] but be still god is going to fight for
[52:38] you
[52:39] hallelujah i'm so glad tonight
[52:42] that god fought for me and he's still
[52:44] fighting for me right now
[52:46] [Music]
[52:47] i say if god fighting for you come on
[52:49] i know i'm yelling but i said be still
[52:52] come on quietness
[52:54] because something rang out in your soul
[52:57] you know when god when god does
[52:59] something when that real peace comes
[53:02] you might still be in the midst of the
[53:03] storm
[53:04] but you know it's over with
[53:07] you might still be in the midst of your
[53:08] trial what you faced with but when that
[53:11] real peace comes
[53:12] you don't even worry about it
[53:14] i believe just like joel said though he
[53:16] slayed me yet i'll trust him what it is
[53:19] real peace down came
[53:20] and that's what we want we want real
[53:23] peace you know one thing i like i didn't
[53:25] want to be long tonight but one thing i
[53:27] liked and hearing the scriptures while
[53:29] you know
[53:30] they were going through i like how it
[53:32] says that the cloud that led them by day
[53:35] you know and it was a fire at night it
[53:37] said it came in between them and
[53:39] pharaoh's army
[53:40] i like that
[53:42] i begin to just meditating on it says
[53:45] that that it came in between them and it
[53:47] was a darkness to the enemy but it was a
[53:50] light a fire light to them but it came
[53:53] in between them that they couldn't come
[53:55] near each other all night
[53:57] i began to be stirred in my spirit i
[54:00] said because you know what don't the
[54:01] devil attack you at night
[54:04] there'll be some long nights right
[54:06] frightening nights
[54:08] because you know the enemy is out there
[54:10] but how much of a blessing it is to know
[54:13] that god is between you and the enemy
[54:16] the blood is there and he can't cross
[54:18] the bloodline
[54:20] all night long hallelujah that god won't
[54:22] let the devil come near you
[54:25] he might bluff he might do all those
[54:27] things hallelujah but remember and i
[54:29] says that even in in that and all the
[54:32] night
[54:33] when the fire was between them
[54:35] and the enemy and the pharaoh's army
[54:37] couldn't come near him
[54:39] don't you know god was working something
[54:40] out
[54:42] the wind was blowing making a way for
[54:43] him wasn't it
[54:44] in the midst of the night the wind
[54:47] was blowing i could see them
[54:50] you know maybe in that morning time
[54:52] when they looked up hallelujah that
[54:54] might have been a long night might have
[54:56] been one of the longest nights of their
[54:58] life
[54:59] but when the morning came
[55:01] and they saw hallelujah the dry land
[55:04] before them just dramatizing maybe
[55:07] hallelujah and they can walk over they
[55:09] might have didn't know what was taking
[55:11] place in the night
[55:13] but when the morning came
[55:15] then they could see the significance in
[55:16] it that while we were going through our
[55:19] frightening part a horrible terrible
[55:21] part god was still working hallelujah
[55:25] i like let's say
[55:26] even when i don't see him he's still
[55:28] working
[55:29] even when i don't feel him he's still
[55:31] working in the midst of the night god is
[55:34] still working when the morning come
[55:36] you'll see then hallelujah how many
[55:39] believe that tonight come on but i said
[55:41] be still don't you know god god wants to
[55:44] show us god wants to show us a lot of
[55:46] things don't he what what is all those
[55:48] trials and all those things about god
[55:50] want to show you he want to fight for
[55:52] you come on
[55:54] god don't you know don't you know that
[55:56] god want to take care of you
[55:59] and we would learn that long time ago
[56:01] hallelujah
[56:02] then we wouldn't had to go through some
[56:04] of the things that we went through
[56:06] because we to realize hallelujah that
[56:09] god
[56:10] he had he knows what was best for your
[56:11] interests he knowed he knows how to take
[56:13] care of you
[56:15] god knows if we would have learned that
[56:17] long time ago
[56:19] that god it's all in his hands
[56:22] we wouldn't had to go through those
[56:23] sleepless nights
[56:25] we wouldn't have been kicking against a
[56:27] prick we would have let go long time ago
[56:30] and gave it over to god and let god deal
[56:32] with it and we don't know what we know
[56:34] now
[56:35] hallelujah but god takes us through
[56:37] those things hallelujah that the next
[56:39] time around
[56:42] i don't care how hard the situation is
[56:45] how bad it gets
[56:47] hallelujah
[56:49] you know who fighting for you
[56:52] you know hallelujah
[56:54] god brought you to this but he says that
[56:57] the enemy that afflicts you you ain't
[56:59] gonna see him no more again forever god
[57:01] was gonna annihilate him
[57:03] i thank god for that hallelujah don't

[57:09] don't come back come on when real
[57:11] deliverance come god take care of that
[57:13] thing you don't have to deal with it no
[57:15] more because real deliverances came
[57:18] the reason why people battle over and
[57:20] over with the same things because they
[57:22] never got real deliverance
[57:24] they got partial deliverance but i said
[57:26] god i want real deliverance
[57:29] i want to stay on the altar long enough
[57:32] till i die lord till it's over with

[57:44] against me many are there to save my
