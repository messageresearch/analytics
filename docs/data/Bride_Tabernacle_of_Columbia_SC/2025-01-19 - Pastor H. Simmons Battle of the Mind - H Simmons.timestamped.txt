[41:40] the fruit of it
[41:43] nevertheless the people be strong that
[41:46] dwell in the land and the cities are
[41:50] wall and very great and moreover we saw
[41:56] the children of Ang

[42:01] land of the South and the Hittites and
[42:05] the jedu sites and the amorites dwelt in

[42:12] by the Sea and by the coast of
[42:17] Jordan and Caleb steal the people before
[42:21] Moses and said let us go up at once and
[42:27] possess it for we are well able to
[42:31] overcome it may God bless you read you
[42:34] may be
[42:37] seen and 31st verse it says it's Caleb
[42:42] said we were will well able to overcome
[42:45] it 31 says but the men that went up with
[42:50] him said we be not
[42:53] what we may not able to go up against
[42:56] this people the people for they are what
[42:59] stronger than I'm talking about this
[43:02] morning mind
[43:05] battles we know that the greatest battle
[43:07] ever fought is fought within our minds
[43:09] but I'm finding that people uh they're
[43:13] losing they're losing their minds really
[43:16] amen and um the Mind battles that folk
[43:21] have is secret
[43:24] battles people have a lot of Secrets B
[43:27] battles that they're
[43:29] fighting and sometimes uh the secret
[43:32] battles that they're
[43:34] fighting you don't know amen until they
[43:37] lost to battle blessing amen you don't
[43:40] know about their battles their secret
[43:42] battles they in with battles you don't
[43:45] know until they have really really lost
[43:48] a battle amen see sometimes when they're
[43:51] battling and they're warn amen see you
[43:54] can lose a battle but you don't have to
[43:56] lose the wall am but I'm afraid people
[44:00] have given up and saying that the uh
[44:04] that they've already lost the
[44:06] wall amen there's no hope there's no way
[44:10] I'm going to be able to to overcome
[44:13] this and so people have given up in
[44:17] defeat and they've given up in their
[44:19] minds so amen they cannot win they
[44:23] cannot go any
[44:24] further because their minds were not
[44:26] allow them to go any further because
[44:29] amen they're defeated within their
[44:33] minds and when you defeated within your
[44:36] mind you have no desire to press forward
[44:39] amen see if your mind tell you you can't
[44:42] get up out the bed then you'll never get
[44:44] up out the bed amen amen Jesus if your
[44:47] mind tell you you can't stop drinking
[44:50] you'll never stop drinking amen if your
[44:53] mind tell you you can't stop you can't
[44:56] do without smoking smoking you'll never
[44:58] stop
[44:59] smoking see it's all in your mind if
[45:02] your mind tell you I can do all
[45:05] things through Christ has strengthen
[45:08] me amen I can't overcome amen we find
[45:13] that people amen think they have strong
[45:16] minds but they have inward
[45:20] Secrets amen they have secrets outwardly
[45:23] they they appear to be strong but
[45:26] inwardly they're weak yes and the Bible
[45:30] says the strong are about the
[45:32] infirmities of the weak amen amen then
[45:35] we ought to be you know we ought to ask
[45:37] for help amen amen but but but because
[45:41] we have this P Persona that we're so
[45:45] strong and outwardly we have folks that
[45:48] look up to us but yet inwardly amen we
[45:51] know amen that we are going through
[45:54] things that amen we seem to amen can't
[45:57] conquer we're going through mind
[46:01] battles we're going through things amen
[46:04] get that somewhat disturbs us and the
[46:08] things that we're going through in our
[46:10] mind we seem like we cannot overcome
[46:13] these mind
[46:15] battles Jesus the secrets that we hold
[46:18] within our
[46:20] mind amen sometimes we have secret
[46:24] faults sometimes we have things that are
[46:26] HIIT hidden from the public and hidden
[46:28] from the eyes but yet they were in with
[46:32] battles and we want to deal with the
[46:35] inward battles because I find that I
[46:38] when I see Christians that are on the
[46:41] sideline and they're not in church
[46:43] anymore and they're not pressing anymore
[46:46] it's because amen they have seen the
[46:48] lost the
[46:50] battle
[46:53] Jesus and I'm trusting this morning
[46:56] those that have lost the battle amen can
[46:59] say Amen that there's still uh there's
[47:03] still a god that is able for me to win
[47:06] the war I've lost some battles but amen
