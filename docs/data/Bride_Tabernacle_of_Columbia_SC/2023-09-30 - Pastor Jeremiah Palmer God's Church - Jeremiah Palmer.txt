really a blessing to us and I appreciate each and every one of you for the efforts that you made Amen to come amen Matthew the 16th chapter very familiar text so I'm not going to read all of it I want to just go straight down to the 16 excuse me the 17th verse and we all know this talking about uh Jesus talking to Simon Peter after he asked him who the men say aye the son of man am but I'm going to take apart from another angle tonight not So Much from the angle that he usually but the 17th verse and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed are thou Simon Bojana for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say um I say also unto thee that thou on Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church in the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever thou shall bind on Earth shall be bind in heaven and whatsoever thou shall loose on Earth shall be loose in heaven then chart he his disciples that they should tell no man and he was Jesus the Christ father we thank you for your word now Lord I pray you blessed Lord and Quicken it in Jesus name amen amen let me be seated I want to just just for a few minutes and not mean to be long at all tonight I want to speak to you in a little thought of God's Church in God's Church and As We Know that there are many claims that people make of being God's Church for a long time now no matter who you talk to basically and what form of religious practices they have they want to believe that they are God's Church but I believe that the Bible identifies that God's church has never been a building structure of a natural building I believe it was David one time that wanted to build God a house but he told no you have too much blood on your hand David you said one place I went from 10th to tent and he never had a building that he had Associated that this is my building structure have you noticed the evening of Old Testament when God was dealing with Israel they were a people of God as long as they were in Egypt and Egypt was a type of the world always like to say that God is not a mixer he's a separator from the beginning he separate light from Darkness he separates and as long as Israel stayed in Egypt they were mixed up with the things of the world they uh were associated with the things of the world until they begin to stop crying out for God to deliver them and you know when God begins to move upon the people in such a way it causes them to uh leave out from what they were doing to come to something that God was doing and when they came out of Egypt and going to the promised land away from the Taskmaster the way from the Egyptians because God wanted his people to be a peculiar separated people and God always wanted his people to be peculiar not so much because of how they dress or or things like that no that's not what God was interested in but God was going to do our work with his people God people were going to be led by his spirit and his Spirit only not ruled by a man not ruled by a hypocrisy of Cardinals and uh headquarters systems that was never God's system God's spirit don't he work through men but those men were led by the spirit of God they did not do what they want you they were under the influence in the inspiration of God they had no Creed but Christ they had no law but the word they had no psychology of theology or methodology whatever you want to know no they had one thing that was God's word and as long as the people stayed with that word see as long as they stayed with God were now it must be written I'll be the Bible said one place said that all scriptures are given by inspiration of who the bishop headquarters no man can lay any claims on what God is doing this church that God is called his church they were a peculiar set aside for the word church means called out and separated for the use of God and God always wanted to be the one to lead his people and when Satan came in and begin to start the falling in scattering the flock bringing in false teaching bringing in man-made ideas bringing in customs of of witches and voodles and all kind of satanic teaching and they Institute it and then mix it in with church and what it did it called the hybrid it caused a a false Union that God no longer could be in that because God is a separator the word of God see the Bible the very word of God for your hour for your day when God still as he still are using men using people of God with his word that he gives them and they are so under the influence of the Holy Ghost that they must know that I'm staying with what's written in the Bible and if that word is God's word like it's written then that word will then produce Christ again it'll produce that very life of God in the people that hears it and believe and act on it but they must know that it's God's word one deviation one little mispiece that you put in that word is like this it's like if you go to the doctor you know in this medicine that they give us if they want water it down it'll have the right kind of effect but because they don't actually give us you know that the real antidote then we can't get the right kind of effect and it was supposed to produce so is it with God's word God want the word of God to have an effect on the people God's word that he gives us always lead us to him nobody else no no other man no we don't live no other body out but Jesus Christ he must and he alone must be the center of what we are preaching what we are believing and who we are putting the people to when you put the people to anybody else it becomes Antichrist got to stay with the word it's important that's why Jesus said if I be lifted up see he nobody if I be lifted then I'll draw see we need to know that we need to lift Jesus up above anything I thank God we got good pictures good people good Minister but my focus is Jesus Christ great men oh Dynamite that don't make any difference Jesus Christ the center must be in order for the word to have the right kind of effect I'm learning this and I'm teaching this back at Marion that we must have the right Focus and when the people of God begin to follow to see the people in these days are almost been following anything all I gotta do is have a little religious background Boop a little religious custom Boop people follow I mean sir God say that and people hungry they eat out of the trash can they they're looking for something that real and when they hear all of these things they said maybe this it or maybe that's it and they begin to follow especially something new everybody wants something that nobody ever heard before but let me tell you something this Bible was been here it's the only book if you ever heard of that's been the most debatable book there is on the Earth why is one of the biggest tricks the devil ever did they get the people away from this write your own Bible put another interpretation to it they'll make it so that people can really understand what the Bible is talking about they will evicted the Holy Ghost see in all the good uh ideas that may be even good maybe but God has one way and Jesus said I am no way ah not us not them he said I am the way the truth and the what so no matter what you think about it or a better way system that's what we always are so smart in that what a better way are easier you know I'm more appealing way or we do it so we can draw the people no no no if the Gospel of Jesus Christ don't draw see we're not looking for appealings that's why the Bible said there's a way that seemeth right to a man there's a way that seemeth right to a lot of preachers but if it's not the way Jesus said I am the way see he was is the way even now today the word is the way that's why when coming to Christ and if he is the head in the center of your life you're always check with him because the church or the preachers might get off but you always can go back to this Bible did not the Bible say prove all things how do you prove it this is the blueprint y'all and if you try to change the blueprint you won't get there like you want to because you went another Direction see that's why even Jesus said this he said now I'm gonna go away he said it's expedient that I do because if I don't then the comforter who I send in my name won't come see one comfort of the Holy Ghost there remember one Holy Ghost and it's the same Holy Ghost they had in the Bible ought to be the same Holy Ghost me you God if there's another Holy Ghost it's the wrong ghost if your Holy Ghost don't lead you to the truth of God's word for you hour your day that's the wrong Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will lead you to some particular place where men say they established I believe Paul said that he said now I have laid the foundation see Paul said I laid it he said be careful how you build it you said because if any man think that he's spiritual you will say even if an angel would come and preach anything different I know a lot of people don't like Paul but Paul wrote the New Testament basically Church and he established it upon not upon himself remember you remember Paul before we came home he was Saul he actually was persecuting the Church of God until God got a hold of him he was one of the main ones that were threatening had Stefan and those killed because he was a part of a system that they thought that they were changing that custom a religious practices Paul had letters to persecute them throw me in prison kill them had them killed but when God got a hold of Saul he had to struck him blind could God I'd like to say this too God's church is chosen by him if some man call you or some woman to call you it's not the right one God calls God chosen let me read that the book of Ephesus or Ephesians let me say it like this God people are hand-picked by him that's why a lot of times so many people they healed a call but they're hearing the wrong voice and I can't never forget I I honestly believe it was all in my heart I know I said over and over I honestly believe this that every Christian that God calls you must hear his voice it got to be his for now God works through people but I've always said that voice will always carry you back to the god of the word and if that voice is taking you anywhere else then back to God it's the wrong voice because he said my sheep will heal my eye no my music my tongues on my shout I'm a praise dancers no my sheep healed my voice I honestly believe it I say it again that you must hear the voice of God for yourself a lot of times you know we raised our children and we ought to do that in the admonition of the Lord but it come to a place then that they must have a personalized experience with God themselves we'll need to do this now until they get to must something must happen somewhere in their life that the Holy Spirit began to deal with them because if it don't when Mom and Dad is gone I turned it back they'll do other things but if they ever can get uh to a place that God deal with them one-on-one and they get convicted by the Holy Ghost then Mom and they don't have to worry no more I believe I heard somebody said until you get the Holy Ghost your parents your Holy Ghost if they have it themselves because they only want to instruct you to the things of God the owner owner trying to lead you to that person I'm gonna tell you something the Holy Ghost is a person and that person of Jesus Christ wants to get in US so many people claim that because they're the church because they feel the spirit let me tell you something then someday you don't feel nothing you feel sick you feel so bad in fact he gonna die so it got to be more Than A Feeling it's okay to feel it but you know you got it because if you got it even you ain't feeling good he'll keep you even when you get weak in yourself he is a keeper and he just gonna keep you when things go good he give you a battling thing going bad yeah about the longer they up on the mountain Hallelujah praise praise praise but when the time to go in the valley I don't know or whether I'm saved I thought I was no no no no no if you got like the Bible said regardless of what you're going through regardless of what you're dealing with you'll still know God is a keeper I'm gonna tell you something young and old people you need a keeper somebody to keep you when you can't keep you you need somebody else to keep you amen see do you have some death in your life that you get vulnerable you get a little weakly and discouraged at that time you will need to know my keeper kept me there come a time you don't have no friends nobody seem like they care or understand what you going through let me tell you something he cares and he'll be a real fan at all times not when you good you know how buddies do you know you stick with me we Blood Brothers we blood a sister oh yeah we good to go and something come up I don't know about that one see but God will even stick with you in the tough times I believe even doing them tough times you really know whether you got it there comes sometimes sometimes you say well I don't know how I made it then you say oh yeah God took me through do they see him alone but you are not alone did not Jesus say I'll be with you even in you I'll never leave you never forsake you oh yeah God's Church also in the church with power when I talk about God Church a church a people see God just and raise us up with nothing but God give you something fight the devil with because he knows you're going to ever serve that you're gonna have to deal with situations and conditions he know you'll get sick he know you have trials and tribulations that's why he told the disciple me before they went out and preach he said now go to Jerusalem first he said entirely there because I got to give you something you see that and when I give you that promise of the father then you can go and be my Witnesses see because he knew how already Peter already acted before the Holy Ghost came the very one he gave the keys to but notice this now God let me read it first you think God gave Peter the keys to lose Peter I don't think so Ephesians 1 and 3. he said blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in who before when so you were chosen by God before the foundation of the world you just didn't know it God already knew you that's why I hear people say a lot of time oh I come to God when I get ready hmm I don't think so you might come that'll mean God would accept you you can't come to God when you that must God must call and honestly many are called but a few a trolling in the elect May the people can come and hear it but they can't endure see it those that can endure to the end that's why the Bible said they'll be such a great Falling Away because they can't endure they couldn't take or they wasn't chosen by God before they they come to join a church they shake the hand and I put the name on but that's not God's Church I read the Bible say one place if you have not the spirit of Christ you are never his you see how God identify his church with his spirit only with God don't get the church Spirit don't get the Pastoral Spirit don't get nobody else Spirit but get the Holy Spirit [Music] I found out to be sober in time when you're talking to people they're more excited because of of what they church say or what their Bishop tell them that's all right in a way but I got to hear from God you must know your call and chosen by him and him alone it must be a one welfare you and God have a relationship and sometimes you can't explain it but you know that something is calling you something is telling you get your life right all of us the Bible say one place that all of us in time past had our conversation according to the world requested parents of the air you know going after the lust of the flesh we were born by Nature to do those things we couldn't help that God don't hold you accountable for that but when he hold you accountable for and when he has made a way for you to get out of it and then you reject the way that God Made For You see now I have to say it again there is a way that seemeth right it must be God's way Brother John what's God's way the word if it ain't the word way it's not God's way that's what one of the reasons why God sent us you know what he did in this hour to bring us back to him again because if you know us the religious word had drifted so far in the history of the church we saw how they came in and and the people begin to just backslide they begin to mix things with the word they begin to bring in all kind of custom they're going to bring in all kind of days they begin to bring in all kind of man-made difficult to bring in all kind of things and put it in a Christian format and say oh this is our church and it probably is your church but I'm talking about God's Church God's Church believe the word they act on the word they live the word they just don't talk it they walk it they're living not this Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday it's a daily life living that God's people walking in that life in the spirit of God May the Bible said Christ he came to reconcile us back to God to bring us back so we all have one of stray and just as God called Egypt Israel Egypt he called us out of the system organized religion system Book of Revelation 17 and 18 he told us because mystery Babylon Has Fallen he began to make a call and begin to tell his people come out of her because God's people is in every Church but they must come out they must come out but they must go in so they can go up come out come in go up come out of the thing the world be separated say it the Lord and I receive you don't be contaminated with the world's system let me kind of read something just out of our footnote this is you said the New Testament is usually referred to as a local group of Christians in this sense a church is an assembly of baptized Believers under the discipline of the word of God baptized not by water on them but by spirit under the discipline of the word and that's why God had to restore the truth of the word back to the Believers in this hour if that don't don't happen the people that never can come back to what's right because every man got an idea that they're right that this is right you know that this is how I believe it and this is how and no doubt they're sincere people but let me tell you something we can't go on what I think is right we need we need an absolute we need certain something that's certain of God the son of God because if not we guessing we're pursuing without Authority don't know whether it's for sure or or maybe uh um because um it just we did it for a long time and all of that kind of stuff or my mama my great grandparents them did it that was good for them but we're living in the light of another age we notice the difficult revelation that church there that lasts layout and see a church they have got sold to a place so prosperous with materialistic things that they put God out the church look at the condition they put God out because they couldn't tell him we are rich we are increased with goods and we have need of nothing wow that's what they were telling God obviously he was on the outside knocking would y'all let me back in I want to do something in your life no we are rich we building our own Tower to heaven in other words they're saying something like this baby the way the Bible it says the old way and they said that way don't work no more wow that way don't give the young people nothing to do it's not appealing to because the world see has a lot of appealing that their young people appeals to in a sense that it's true but the Bible said the ways of sin is death the gift of God is eternal life all you're gonna follow in the world is misery pleasure for a season when the season over you get tired of doing anything over and over next day you gotta do the same thing I want to be happy you found something else wrong to do sinful that don't make you keep on doing it you get tired gotta find something else to do you gotta find something else to do gotta find something you're trying to find peace and happiness in all the wrong places young and old Pleasures listen we'll never ever take the place of the joy of God and the love of God in your heart what you're really looking for is God he really really really loves you he prove it he took your place he took your sin upon him that way you don't have to live like that living like animals like dogs going to spray all about no no no you're a God child you God Sons you God daughters God said I got a better life oh I know it don't look popular because even you know everybody is telling us oh you don't have to do all that you can still do that and you can still do that because that's what we always did that don't make it right see to love God but first to understand he love you yeah it ain't no fake when God tell you he love you he love you and he proved that he went to the lowest he left his throne in heaven to come to Earth even as a child they'll grow up as a child so he even know what the children is going through obviously he could be touched with the feeling of our infirmities he know what it's like to be poor homeless talking about spit on ridicued and by the way he never owned the house hmm never owned apartment never owned a horse in a buggy never on none of those things why did he do it to let you know those things don't make you what you are I do cars and houses and clothes and prestiges and and don't they don't make you who you are God makes you who you are good after all who is the one that wakes you up who is the one give you health in the script and yet we want to acknowledge that God is real that's why I serve him he didn't prove it to me yes sir he doesn't prove it to me he's real I heard but now I see a lot of time we hear but you need to see you need you probably say old taste and see that the Lord he's what have you tried him yet have you tested to see oh this is good here so you think oh I'm having fun as a young person that guy always told me when I was uh incarcerated he told me he said real he said you sure you want to go all the way like that he said I hate to see you you backslide you know because you are confounded and you get out then you want to go back in the world and I said no Mike I say I am convinced I haven't been on the other side of the fence and I know I said by the way that's why I'm doing this predicament because the other side I chose was the wrong way I said what God was rich and don't you know that young man when I even left he came by my house to check me out in order to proceed whether you that I'm going back real no Mike I love God even more so he was a Jehovah Witness God you see I'm glad to see that because so many he said so many people picked that up when they're away but when they get out they go back to where I said Mike I said I have been on both sides of the road I said I'm gonna tell you something even before I got this other side I was raised to do that which is right I chose the wrong way I want to tell you young people tonight don't choose the wrong way choose the right way Jesus is the way Jesus is your answer to your happiness young sisters please please young sisters young Brothers my younger sister please don't allow the devil to destroy you because he don't love you now he don't love you he all he want to do yeah give you this or give it and then at the end of it he want to make your life so miserable that when you think God don't even care about you but I want to tell you in event God cares God cares God's Church I see why the servant of God said God ought to be happy people after all what you got to be sad about we let these things in this world condition us our happiness they don't predict my happiness God doesn't die they gave me happiness yes even in the midst of what you're going through I still got joy I'm attending the church make another night I said let me say something I don't need even music to praise God I said because this Joy I got is go beyond music I just think about the goodness of God and all that he's done for me and when you get your own testimony of what God done for you regardless of how you feel I thank God for his Mercy how many you think of his Mercy yeah that's why God gave us rain and sunshine you must have the both that way you can appreciate the Sun when the rain is gone but a smile is but Ernest father we give you honor because you deserve it we don't even deserve God to think that you have done for us but oh God these young people tonight young children young sisters young Brothers tonight how many of you want to serve God tonight young people you see brother Jeremy brother Ernest I want to serve God I don't want my life to be messed up I don't want my life to be destituted Lord Jesus look upon us look upon your church father I pray God for your Holy Spirit as you continue God to bless the ministry God In The Name of Jesus Christ amen I appreciate the word tonight amen God is good amen that's our brother killed give us a song Amen y'all feel all right today God's church amen God is in joy and strengthened my life say he moves all pain misery is right he promised to keep me never to leave me and never ever fall short of his word I've had to fast and pray [Music] and keep my life each and every day promise [Music] oh yes God is Warrior [Music] God Is Right [Music] what would I say now God is [Music] amen God's church amen you know it's a couple things well Jeremiah Was preaching tonight I was thinking about you know one of the things he was saying about how you know young and and people say you waste your life you know I remember when I first started walking with Lord and somebody older way older they told me they says you ain't got to live that way they told me that says you're gonna waste your whole youth and then it says then you're gonna get older you're gonna wish you hadn't wasted your whole youth you're gonna find out you didn't have to do all that that's what they told me but the thing was it wasn't it wasn't a burden to live that way it was a joy because God had did something for me now if it's a burden to live that way it's a difference but like brother Jeremiah was saying the night you don't been on both sides you saw the pleasure of sitting for a season That season was over with you saw both sides but when God did something in your life it wasn't a struggle you wasn't living that way just struggling to live that way but it was easy like they sang that little song is so easy to love you Jesus because you're wonderful and it was easy through the dark times it was easy all those lonely nights and all those lonely prayers and all those things sometimes seem like you walking alone but it was all right because God was there with you the whole time and every time he brought you through this and he brought you through that you realize that you were moving somewhere in God that you weren't the same to where you were that where you used to be so then as the trials came you were getting better you were getting deeper in God and then you came to the place now that you can't turn back because he did so much for you you ain't got nothing to go back to you don't cut so much off your life you know he doesn't brought you so far you can't turn back now Hallelujah only thing you can do is just keep going and God how many thank God for that tonight so I want
