[36:58] it says for then shall there be Great
[37:01] Tribulation such as not since the
[37:06] beginning of the world to this time
[37:10] no nor ever shall
[37:13] be and except those days should be
[37:20] shortened there should
[37:23] what no flesh be saved
[37:27] but for the
[37:29] what for the elect sake those days shall
[37:33] be
[37:35] shortened then if any man shall say unto
[37:39] you Lo his Christ are there believe it
[37:43] not for there shall be there shall arise
[37:47] false christs and false
[37:50] prophets and shall show great signs and
[37:53] wonders in so much that if it were
[37:56] possible they shall deceive the
[38:00] what very elect may God bless the
[38:03] reading this word you may be
[38:07] seated and we want to go back here to
[38:11] the 22nd verse except those days be
[38:17] shorten there shall no flesh be
[38:22] saved I believe those days are here
[38:27] I believe we have come to those
[38:32] days that we are the world is in such a
[38:36] turmoil and such a
[38:39] condition that we can come to the time
[38:42] where it can get so
[38:46] bad that if God didn't have mercy there
[38:49] would be no
[38:51] flesh save are you with
[38:53] me but he
[38:56] says but
[38:58] for the
[39:00] what that's what I want to talk about
[39:02] this morning
[39:04] for the
[39:06] elect
[39:08] sake and I want to say for your
[39:12] sake for your sake for the elect
[39:17] sake I want to speak to each and every
[39:19] one of us that
[39:21] you and I that are here this morning and
[39:25] those that are listening father the
[39:27] elect
[39:31] s when I speak of the
[39:35] elect it means those that were picked
[39:40] out in other words those that are
[39:46] chosen we like to elaborate father upon
[39:50] those that are elect those that are
[39:52] chosen not just because we go to church
[39:57] not what because we identify with a
[40:00] certain
[40:04] persuasion but we must identify with the
[40:07] word and what the word has identified as
[40:13] those that are
[40:15] elect we must look and see whether or
[40:18] not we can identify ourselves with the
[40:24] word when he speaks of elect
[40:28] you can say is he talking about
[40:33] me just as much as Mary knew that Isaiah
[40:38] 17 Isaiah 7:14 was talking about
[40:43] her and John knew that Isaiah 40 was
[40:46] talking about
[40:48] him the voice of one crying in the
[40:52] wilderness and those on the day of
[40:54] Pentecost could identify with
[40:58] said this is that which is spoken of by
[41:01] the prophet
[41:03] Joel then the elect must also be clearly
[41:08] identified those that was picked out
[41:10] those that were
[41:13] chosen because we're talking about the
[41:16] shortening of the days for the elect
[41:22] sake so interchanging that word elect
[41:25] and chosen because elect means to be
[41:28] chosen we know that John tells us that
[41:31] Jesus said you have not chosen me but
[41:33] I've chosen you and ordain you that you
[41:35] should go forth and that you should
[41:36] bring forth fruit and that your fruit
[41:38] should
[41:41] remain so for the elect sake amen I'm so
[41:46] glad that God chose me how about
[41:49] you you know when I was uh praying and
[41:53] God taking me through this the scripture
[41:56] First Peter 1
[41:58] 1 and four I might start at the third
[42:02] verse 1 Peter
[42:06] 1 I was thinking about how blessed I
[42:09] am and how blessed we
[42:13] are I mean we have nothing to hold our
[42:16] heads down
[42:18] for we must walk with the
[42:21] uh I might use the word pride but I a
[42:25] word bless
[42:28] how blessed we
[42:29] are we can walk with our heads up
[42:32] knowing that God has truly blessed
[42:36] us and that we are the elect of
[42:40] God and God I I it doesn't matter if
[42:44] you're going through sickness you're
[42:45] going through crisis it doesn't
[42:49] matter but Paul testify I let nothing
[42:52] separate me from the love of God that I
[42:55] found in Christ
[42:57] amen I know what it's all about amen I I
[43:01] I'm
[43:02] elect so I I'll let nothing separate me
[43:06] because I know that I'm
[43:09] elect see I know what God has done for
[43:12] me and I know what he's doing for me
[43:14] even
[43:16] now amen so many Christian when they
[43:19] even face death they were not
[43:22] afraid because they had already passed
[43:25] from Death To Life
[43:27] amen they knew that death could not harm
[43:30] them death was already taken care
[43:33] of are you with me so a Christian
[43:37] knowing that they are are the elect of
[43:40] God chosen of God Amen not only just
[43:43] identifying as a Christian because we
[43:45] know that the church consists of five
[43:48] wise and five foolish amen but to be
[43:51] amen the elect of God and be the bride
[43:54] that call out of the church amen not
[43:57] just to be in the church where God calls
[43:59] a bride out the
[44:01] church amen as my own Bishop used to say
[44:03] he called the church out of the
[44:06] church so he calls the bride out of the
[44:09] church
[44:10] amen and many people amen going to
[44:13] identify amen as being amen the uh uh
[44:18] the bridegroom Comet and there's a
[44:20] Midnight Cry amen and many people going
[44:24] to rise up and try to come but they'll
[44:26] find out they don't have
[44:29] all there's no translation
