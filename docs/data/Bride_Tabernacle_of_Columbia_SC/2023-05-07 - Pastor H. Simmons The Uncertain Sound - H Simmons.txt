in God bless you this morning let us just bow in the word of Prayer I will lift my eyes into the heels for which cometh my help for my help coming from the Lord made the heavens and the Earth surely God would not suffer our foot to be moved dotted keeping the Israel shall need to Slumber not sleep the Lord is our help father we look to you now Lord there are many needs Lord and we know that use promise in your word but my God shall supply all of your needs according to your riches in glory so far that we look now to you Lord may you bless your word may you bless your people may you continue to bless your service Lord we thank you for the service that's for God as we look to you in Jesus Christ's name amen the book of First Corinthians 14. you know it's a wonderful thing to be saved many people may have a desire to be saved and may want to be saved but they find struggles and battles they go through very difficult times that not in their hearts they want to be saved and they want to be a Christian they want to live for God but yet there's a struggle and that it was struggled and end with battle just to release and give up and give God they find the inability they can't seem to make up their minds whether they want to let go and give God their all but I trust this morning that that would be a certainty inside of you that you want God to have all of you and you want to give them your all First Corinthians 14 and 1 it says fall after charity and desired spiritual gifts but rather that ye may prophesize for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaking not unto men but unto God for no man understands him I did in spirit he speaks mystery but he just prophesied speaketh unto men to edification and exaltation and comfort he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifies himself but he that prophesy identifies the church a word that you all speak with tongues but rather that ye prophesies for greater is he that prophesied then he that speaketh with tongues except he interprets that the church may be receive edifying now Brethren if I come unto you speaking with tongues what shall I profit you except I shall speak to you either by Revelation or by knowledge or by prophecy saying or by Doctrine and even things without life given sound eat whether pipe or heart except they give a distinction in the sound how shall it be known what is pipe or heart for if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound who should prepare himself to battle may God bless the reason's words you may be seen you want to talk this morning about the uncertain sound said if this trumpet gives an uncertain sound who should prepare themselves for battle you know I was just in prayer yesterday and I've started writing down some things about me you know it's it's a possibility that and I know that sometimes we need to be in tune with God and as I was thinking about being in tune and thought about the musical aspect of tune it and then thought it was a difference between to be in tune and and I thought about tone you know the tone that we're in sometimes when a tone setting it says it's the tone in which we speak in could be um harsh could be loud or I could be soothing he said a tone is sound especially as one is Pleasant uh Musical one that of a serious or such sound of Rage so we can have different tones then I thought about tune a lot of people don't know whether they're into an auto tune because sometimes people saying people are tone deaf you know they don't know um some people when they listen and I've seen the musicians work with voices and sometimes seeing musicians who work with voices I find they try to get The Sopranos to sing soprano and they sing at Otto they're trying to get the hassles to sing out to when they're singing soprano and sometimes you know musicians get together and you know they wanted drums to be in time and they want um the mute the organ and the musician all of them to be in time and to work together and um sometimes if one has a better ear to hear and then the other have a sort of a hearing impairment and they came here as well so they have to lean on the one next to them who can hear better and so that one that can't hear too good so when the Rhythm changed and they need to stay in key you know stay in tune and now a particular place if they're singing soprano they need to stay in that soprano place and if the one that can't quite handle their position so they listen to that one that's more gifted and they just need to die and I you know I see them in practice and then trying to you know get it together amen so it's a lot of things that people work on you know some people they you know they everybody believes that everybody can be the tambourine just give them one two years old one year old and they're still in the crib it sound good a bunch of noise don't it but it doesn't matter because you know I can just put one in your hand you're supposed to be able to do it but I don't care how chaotic it sounds to a person like me you know he said hey I don't know God I I can't hear that well so I don't know where you're into it or not but somebody that's very sensitive to Tunes they can say hey it's a lot of noise we're walking and not me I can't hear it sounds like you know that's because I can't distinguish so I I want us to understand after Trump who gives an uncertain sound who can prepare himself for battle it's very we can become very sensitive spiritually sensitive in the spirit and when your sensitive spiritually wise some people are insensitive to the spirit to happen and they'll tune into the world and what the world you know was going on and they have a worldly Spirit they'll tune into a worldly spirit and they don't even know it they're unconscious of that I could cater more to something that would be worldly of fleshly uh all about the flesh than all about God you know sometimes the church want to get in the spirit of the world sometimes people because of because of not uh having a sincere prayer life and not being a consecrated to God then you just don't you just don't be spiritual because you come to church you don't just be spiritual because you know I I'm spiritual you know but it takes consecration it takes dedication to God for God to for you to be in tune with God is very possible the possibility of you not living a consecrated life and thinking that what we're doing hey you know this is all about God it's it can't be about God when you're not taking that time to spend time with God and consecrate in your life and dedicating yourself and spending time when you communing with God if you're not in income communion with God then you don't understand just like the musicians they they take time and they practice and they listen and they see how they sound and they see whether or not I'm sounding whether or not I'm keeping time so they get a tuna you know uh a minister used to work with me he should tune pianos way before they got all this electronic stuff and these gadgets and he would take a little hammering the thing and he was King see what this ends see you know what this is you know a or whatever and he's a thing he listens and I said okay he's tuning but to me CEO a or whatever all of them the same to me because I don't know what he's doing and that's the same thing what man knows the things of man saved the spirit on demand see we have to have the spirit of the Lord to know whether we are in tune with the Lord without the spirit of the lord we cannot please God without the spirit of the lord we are actually out of tune with the spiritual things of God because who has known the mind of God you can't know the mind of God except you have the spirit of God and you know you can't understand the things of God you have to have a spirit see because without his Spirit you'll just presuming that you know God and you know what what what is you know what church is and you know how church goes but do you know what God is requiring of you spiritually because God can communes with you daily to bring you up into things that you need to perfect in your life things that you need to work on to make you more in tune with God and bring your life in order you know what I'm saying so you need an order you need to order your life but it doesn't matter because you know if we take God lightly and we don't care about you know being in tune we don't we just do because hey this is what we do and this is what you know we're not really into but you know you take uh an orchestra's teacher you know she comes and you know she knows you know my niece she she worked with Orchestra so she knows hey that violin you just wait a minute y'all this section your violins you all need to do this over here do it again y'all ain't got it you know what I'm saying and they'll keep going but that's what the Holy Ghost does it makes us in tune with God the Holy Ghost will let you know when you're out of tune with God it'll begin to say hey hey hey come on come on you know you're in church you you're going through the motion but are you into no no no no it's trying to tune you up the Holy Ghost began to speak to you and try to get you you know in tune to God where you can amen where you can flow in the spirit see God wants you to be able to flow in the spirit where where you're not trying to work it up and you're trying to make it up but you're flowing amen everything is in harmony you want the the church to be in harmony amen we want to you know that we don't want the trumpet to give uncertain want to be in harmony with with the Holy Spirit when we are in harmony with the Holy Spirit then there's a flow amen there's a pleasant Spirit that's a sweet spirit amen that goes along with you in tune with God it's so sweet it's not about I'm trying to reflect even my voice I'm not trying to show you my talent I'm not trying we got to we got to be in tune in Harmony One with another amen and when we're not in harmony with God we may be in harmony with the Devil you know what I'm saying we may be more in harmony with the devil because amen and nobody gonna tell me how you know I I can see the the the the awkwardness teaching this one on Earth you know I want to do my solo but this ain't solo time if you can read the music you'll know amen that it's not solo time right now are you with me we are all playing here in harmony together but you know some folks that can't read the music that you know that you know they don't mind because I can play so it doesn't matter whether I'm in tune with y'all Or Not amen so the church is you know one body and one spirit and everybody got to be in harmony harmonizing together and when it's harmonizing together it goes up as a sweet smell before God and God can hear amen he can hear your spirit on everybody experienced uh in harmony you see I'm not talking about so much and So you you're being in harmony with brother Simmons or with Brian Tabernacle but I'm talking about being in harmony with God even being tuned in with God and you know everything else to take care itself amen we don't have to teach on how to dress and how to live and all of that because when you're in tune with God Amen the Holy Spirit gonna teach you all of that isn't that right amen but when you're out of tune with God Amen folks come by and say hey you need to do this you need to do that that dress is too tight those shoes are too hot you know what we doing it it becomes a law like somebody's beating you up somebody trying to make you do something you don't want to do but when you're in tune with God it's not about somebody's trying to straighten you out trying to beat you up because you in tune the Holy Spirit already brought conviction now if the Trump will give us an uncertain time who's going to prepare themselves for battle now what happens we find that things can be all unstable unbalanced because the world itself is in bad shame amen the church world is in bad shape and people in their lives in the home our community our school everything is in terrible shame condition amen they're trying to get it straightened out but lord they're trying to get it straightened out look like you're getting worse are you with me so what happens amen we got we know that there are uncertain sounds out there amen they're trying to make it better but they're making it worse amen the homes are getting worse so school is getting worse the jobs everything is given uncertainty there's uncertainty and you said uncertain sound that means you can't trust it and when a thing is uncertain that means you cannot trust you can't put your confidence in you cannot trust your job you cannot depend you know sometimes it said you don't know whether to build a house you don't know what put your money in the bank you don't know what what you know to do this or that you don't know what to do because everything is uncertainty you don't you don't know uh you know Russian says uh United States and uh Ukraine just shot down something or playing a chrome and try to bomb the Obama kill Putin or whatever and it's in the United States and Ukraine did it they said we didn't do it so anybody can get mad and said boom I'm gonna push a button y'all try to kill me I'm gonna kill all y'all see what I'm saying and that's how uncertain things is everything is on the edge and good and the United States and we didn't do it Ukraine said we didn't do it why because we know if they want to retaliate amen we'll be gone the United States is going tomorrow the world is in chaos total chaos tomorrow I mean it can help me anytime but everything is uncertain now we're living in uncertain times everything this is an uncertain sound we don't know folks the young people don't know what to believe they look they're hearing all kind of voices they're hearing a different voice the voice that comes from Mama and the voice that come from that is not saying the same thing the voice that comes from the poor fit and the voice that comes from the school house or they're saying something different everybody it's got a voice but that must be a certain sound amen that's how all these uncertain sounds then what what can be certain what can I trust what can I depend on a human being so what happens amen because we got all these voices that we're listening to we had all these sounds what we're finding out that these things are so unstable amen we're in a a world Amen that's unstable you know the servant of God says you know you find out the one country but that you know that the Earth is pushing it out and it's getting bigger it's pushing up and in the center it's it's just pushing up and stretching out the the Earth is budging like it's going to explode and that's been a long time ago if it's pushing up like that and budging and then he was talking about the uncertainty in the season you don't know one season for another you know you don't know when to plant you don't know when to do this when uncertainty I said it was like that right there what is what is it like now it's uncertainty now if you go plan on something it might have a a a freeze and kill everything because this is supposed to be a season the plan and then another season you you come in and you're preparing for winter and it's summer you know it's 80 degrees 90 degrees in the winter time okay so who's going to prepare themselves when everything is so uncertain you don't know how to prepare for what's going on because all of this is uncertain so if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound who's going to prepare themselves for battle now what I'm saying to is very important that you and I are tuned in to God yeah you see what I'm saying because what what makes it difficult because if we have the don't count spirit if we have I I'm just I'm just religious I'm just a church member I'm just a Church Girl I don't you know I don't I don't even care what the preacher say I don't even care what you know you know and sometimes we don't even care what God say you know what I'm saying because we you know we got that little high-minded spirit that lifted up attitude and we don't care about God's word calls for humility to be humble and then you wonder why we got so much trouble in the land so why so chaotic you know we wonder why you know because everything is shaking let's go to Hebrews 12 excuse me everything is shaking brother sister I hope you see that the world is falling apart and everything is shaking and uh I'm trying to get us back to where we can hear God you know if you can hear God I may can't hear whether you're singing soprano or making it here sometimes uh kill up those you know they're playing something and I'm trying to make article and not call out don't know what they playing over there I call her thinking I'm calling oh thank the lord they're saying so-and-so we ain't saying that we say I mean it was playing so and so on I said oh you see how I I I'm trying to be complimentary and I done said thank the Lord didn't play so-and-so and they played something all together daddy we believe somewhere and this is what we played I said oh I said I better stop this is Daddy we know you can't hear you know and that's the way it is and some people spiritually just like me in the natural they can't hear they can't hear God they just can't hear God and they think you know see I know I can't hear right what about those people that came here and think they can and that's the way it is spiritually speaking folk that tone death spiritually death but think they know God they need to hear God they they're in tune with God and all kind of static going on in their life or whatever [Music] you can't hardly hear what they talking you know but you ain't then you should keep on until you get the station is that right you got to tune in right so some some folks have been out of tune so long until they take the in tune they are because you can holler because you can hoop you know if you just tell me we know you can sing because look how you preach yeah you know you know wrong you know yeah you can sing I said yeah if you think that just let me try you know people can pump your head up and tell you you sound good and you you can't hold it too you see what I'm saying but somebody who is who can't hear they can help you they can help me they didn't help me out a lot they let me know I can and so that helped me a lot so I'm convinced that they writing them wrong because I you know I I sound good to my what you know I sound good you know and all right as long as I'm singing to my wife that sound good to myself I'm in tune you know I said when somebody Rejoice singing up something even write me some songs and I might try to you know write and give this daddy we don't know what you're saying oh yeah you know you you're right ain't too good either issues but in me if I could just Express to them what I was feeling and what I was see what I'm saying what what is happening is spiritually I'm back to consecration dedication and being in tune with God I'm back there I'm saying you know whether or not you're out of tune with God how much time do you spend amen trying to find the mind of God and trying to find the will of God for your life how much time do you spend on that I come to church I go through my religious duties and I'm just religious as I can be you know I'm saying I'm faithful you know what I'm saying faithful playing my tithes I'm faithful coming to church I'm faithful you know this and that but am I spiritual can I hear what the spirit is saying to me am I mean you know a spraying this morning on my knees they say God I don't want to just come out and just say reach a sermon but I want I I want you to give the people what you want them to know and what you what the people need so Lord I I want you to you to do that Lord I I said because you know what we need and you know how to you know bring it because I I know I don't know so you know in talking to the Lord then the Lord thought you know he's got the minister you know he ministers to the preacher before I can minister to you I tell her you know the the people that do music and people that sing I said if you can't feel it if if God don't touch you first then don't expect it to touch nobody else old folks used to say if it don't touch you it ain't gonna trust nobody else are you with me and if it ain't coming from the heart all it is because you can sing because you can do this it ain't gonna touch you see being in tune with God the spirit same thing with preaching you gotta you know you gotta know whether you're in tune with God I mean sometimes to some folks you're gonna never sound like nothing you know what I'm saying some folks don't want to hear you from the start before you get up you say why what because they're out of tune with the spirit sometimes and sometimes you know sometimes I can be out of tune as a preacher you say well oh you mean sometimes the preach again but if you could be praying you can pray and when you begin to pray what happens God brings everything in in tune as you're afraid are you are you with me as you pray and say God we need you to speak God we need something from you God when you begin to pray then the preacher's been ah thank you Jesus and all of a sudden he's speaking you said why because you know amen the preacher's Getting Out Of Tune let me tune him back up are you with me not criticizing but what praying God we need something from you we need to be blessed we need somebody in here need God somebody need to touch somebody needs Deliverance God help him the Lord why because you're praying Lord I want you to help somebody I want you to deliver somebody I want you to save somebody Lord let the preacher say something that's going to edify the church that's going to deliver somebody we've got to preach Out Of Tune are you with me so we all gotta you know but when we when we see that whatever what is back the one that's Out Of Tune know that the one that next to him you might yeah you're close enough to them you hit them and let them know be quiet a little bit you soften up well you can get listen because you can get them back in tune in that right so we can all harmonize what gather this is one body and one Spirit one chair you know what I'm saying that we all can be what in tune in harmony with with the holy spirit with God isn't that right that's what it's like it's harmonizing together in tune with God on one Accord in one place and selling there came a sound from Heaven as a what Russian Mighty Wind isn't that right where the where the presence of God can be ushered in because everybody is in Harmony in Union with God one Spirit one body one purpose in mind and that is to lift Jesus up that is to praise Him amen that is to let him get Glory let him get praise amen that's not for anyone anybody but Jesus are you with me so by the grace of God as we look at Hebrews here uh 12. and 22 amen God is good just wanted to talk to you a little bit this morning because it's very important that God calls us to be in tune with his spirit but it's going to take us recognizing what is needed because we can do a lot of work a lot of work a lot of work a lot of effort but God says You Out Of Tune I can't be pleased with what you're doing I can't accept you your worship I can't I don't want it because you're out of tune you're out of tune you got to get in tune with the spirit you gotta get your prayer life back together you got to consecrate yourself whatever it takes if we tell you to fast fast if I tell you I want you to just I want you to pray here night and day I want you to consecrate yourself I want you to get in tune with me not in tune with the preacher not in tune with the church I wanted you to get into me YouTubers are looking at other folks you gotta look at me your attention is being drifted for away from me you see everybody has a problem do you see yours you see everybody else weekends do you see yours you see everybody else's fault do you see yours God is saying you I want you until me with a strong can bear the what infirmities of the what weak amen but you're the to be strong is to be humble-minded to be merciful to be so much grace in your life to understand Lord help them that'll weak in the faith amen but the end of phase they're weak but they're in the faith but they're strong not to criticize them but the bad to lift them up to comfort them to strengthen them to tell them they can make it tell them to come on don't let the devil deceive you don't let the devil fool you don't let the devil tell you his lies keep on pressing I know it's difficult sometimes but keep on God loves you God cares about you he's concerned about you keep pressing brother sister don't never give up on God he won't give up on you just keep on encouraging but you got to be strong other than that you become a Critic look at her look at him look at him and when you become a credit you don't happen to nobody you're not even helping yourself you're just a criticizer a skeptic are you with me that's not being a Critic amen because what if God would criticize us look at us and say hey you you you you no it's about the blood of Jesus Christ by the grace of God we're making it we're standing not criticizing thank God for his grace on our lives an opportunity he gives us to live right amen but this is Grace I'm trying to get there I got to get there 22. but ye uh come unto Mount Zion you're coming to the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to the innumerable company of angels to the generation to the general assembly and Church of the first born which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the what the spirit of just being made perfect amen that's what it is and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood sprinkling that speaks better things than that of evil see that she what refuse not him that what for if they escape not who refuse him that speaketh on Earth much more shall not we what Escape if we want the holy spirit is speaking from Heaven to you each and every one of us don't refuse the Holy Spirit when God speak to you because he's speaking from heaven and you won't Escape when God speak to your heart you know it's God he's speaking to you don't do this don't do that don't get life right get back with God get you you don't listen how did you you're not going to escape the Judgment of God is going to come things gonna happen it ain't gonna be nice things gonna happen it ain't gonna be nice what happens don't you say president mom or Daddy hey assistant brother husband wife nope when God speak to you you might as well be in tune with God and go and get things right with God listen to that certain sound the holy spirit that tells you what the word is required of your life and you don't get into with God I can help you when judgments strike I can't help you the church can't help your mama can't help your daddy can't nobody can help you because when God give you a time and he spoke to you from Heaven the Holy Spirit spoke to you and you didn't listen to God how are you going to expect to listen to anybody else you wouldn't listen to the spirit of God you knew which God's speaking to you knew you knew perfectly God was speaking to you and then you wouldn't listen to him wouldn't obey him when he spoke to you you know and that's what happened people you know it's a certain sound God holy spirit is a certain sound you know it's the sound of the word are you with me it's speaking to you because the word is speaking to you and you know it's the word when you know it's God you know it's the word you know it's God speaking to you and you don't listen to it huh and you say bless them and pray for my child pray for my son pray for my daughter sometimes we wasting our time praying we're praying but sometimes we're wasting our time know why because they were they refused him to speak it from heaven when God spoke to them from Heaven they refused the Bible said how should we escape because judgment hit when judgments strike you know it's the hand of God striking who knows judgments striking this happening he said why a lot of happened to my child it happens because the refuses to hear them they're speaking from heaven how should we escape when God speak to you from heaven and you gonna Escape no I can't I mean I throw my hand up I I can hear the Holy Spirit speaking to me what you trying to do what are you trying to do I know you you want to see everybody help but what are you trying to do you're trying to come against me when I'm bringing judgment you trying to you move up my way in other words you take your hand off of these situations that I'm bringing judgment on you leave them alone say God yeah you know sometimes we we we want that that love that you know but but God said hold my love I chase him whom I love I chasing oh you will be now God is bringing judgment because he loved him he's chastising them because of his love and you leave it alone don't you uh that it might give the child a little spanking and mama said leave that child alone leave alone Daddy go down with his head huh next thing you know that child is a rude oh that gonna make that Mama that Mama gonna go through something you know because you told that Daddy not to straighten out that child that child said I'm gonna get away with everything now all I can do is and mama said come on leave your child alone and sometimes God get a hold of somebody and God is bringing correction chastisement and we get in the way of God you got to leave that alone leave it alone because wow you're gonna make that child in worse shape are you with me you're gonna put them in worse shape than they ever been in Shoulda let Daddy correct should have let Mama correct uh one thing though I thank God for the grace of God me and my wife didn't have that problem are you with me well a lot of houses got that kind of problem and the fruits of that division the fruits of that division don't work out and how those children respond to life are you with me the child is in chaos because why we wasn't on one according how we real your children instead of getting counseling and selling out and talk we can get on one Accord I don't need to get no counseling I know what I'm doing yeah you don't need no counselor go ahead on who's going to be at fault the child who's gonna shop with the child why if we're in tune with God it wouldn't happen it wouldn't happen because we in tune with God but if the trumpet gives away uncertain times who gonna what who gonna prepare themselves for what battle amen it's all about harmonizing being in Harmony and one with another The Church Must Be In Harmony and tune together uh I remember when 10 years ago so-and-so happened and Pastor didn't do nothing about it 10 years ago when you learn better you were are you with me when you learn better you do better you know if I stay in the same shape it don't never grow get all this gray and hair in my head and then grow none are you a man but sometimes it takes a great half to give you some what wisdom are you with me then you get a little bit more wisdom you know how to handle things better than you did when you were 40. are you with me so by the grace of God but sometimes the gray hair is not respected anymore that's why the gray hair I don't want to be Gray they don't want to go through that wisdom it's not respected now those that went through the storms and went through the trials of life Harmony I ain't gonna get to the last part but one thing that is certain do all the uncertain things in life one thing is certain it says here in Hebrew with everything that can be shaken will be shaken are you with me I'm not trying to preach to you everything that can be shaken will be shaken before we get out of here we're going to see everything shakes every the world has Shook Up they're in a place that they don't know what to do and everything that can be shaken Gonna Be Shaken it's gonna come with time when those things that cannot be shaken you know it'll come a time when those things that cannot be shaken gonna remain he said those things that cannot move and it talks about in Hebrews here we have received a kingdom that cannot be moved oh you have been we have received a kingdom that cannot be moved everything is shaken you know it's hard for God to get your attention if you don't want if you're not attentive are you with me see you got to be in tune for God to get your attention he can't get your attention you know the teacher teaches and you ain't listening and all everything else got your attention you know when it's time to take the test you know what you're gonna do why because you went in tune with what the teacher was saying you weren't even listening to her are you with me but if you want to get what the teacher is saying then you will be attentive to what she's saying you're making sure you don't miss what nothing because if I miss something I might fail the class are you with me so I want to stay in tune with what the teacher is saying that's what I'm talking about being in tune with God when I'm in tune with God Amen I'm going to catch what God is saying and it's going to benefit me amen when the tests and trials of Life begin to come I'm going to be able to withstand are you a fan I won't be moved amen let the winds blow let the storms come I'm not going to be moved Heaven and Earth have passed away but my word is certain word of God is certain it will stand when everything else fail the word will stand by confidence and I'm trusted in God's word so trust in the Lord with all thou art and lean not that I won't understand in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He will want direct your path if you trust him are you I want to be in tune with the word the prophet says stay in line amen don't get out of line praise God don't get out of risen you ain't real sympathy amen praise God if you get out of written you're going to throw the whole subject they are we're on our way to heaven and Glory we're going to march on Aubrey Christian Soldier in the glory into the rapture we're getting out of here brother sister but we gotta heal amen the same sound and that's the sound of the word Amen to get us ready for rapture to get us out of here we're in tune with the bridegroom the bride in the bridegroom of one are you a man let's get ready to get

alley Natalia to tell you isn't that right whatever you need it it's just gonna let you know but old time of college is usually have to find if you ain't got nobody to tell you you have to learn on your own isn't that right but thank God that he got the Holy Spirit here he's working he's working in the end time getting us ready amen keeping us in tune with God amen he's still the same God as he was yesterday he's the same God today praise God to keep us in tune with the spirit praise God in this the spirit of Jesus Christ look at his Spirit look how he's conducted his life look at him and see what's in your life is in harmony with him how do you know amen you know sometimes we have a question should I do this should I why do should I do this prophet of God said if there's a question then don't do it another questioning in it he said don't do it because it the word of God is what it's not questionable it's a certain sign are you with me what the word says certain but if there's a question in your mind don't do it see I got a question about whether or not I should get this car can you get to marry this girl you pretty much you're gonna you're gonna make a a drastic mistake do you mind anyway there's a question in your mind little fella come up to you I would like to talk to you and to question your mind saying you better not talk to him you go ahead on talk that thing you

be the voice of the word isn't that right it's gonna be one Accord with the word brother and sister listen to God if if anything I want to tell you listen to God's word when God speak to you amen now

and you go on and just ignore God Bible said how should we just Escape and we elect so greater salvation if we don't humble ourselves now when we're going to Humble ourselves and we don't listen to
