[20:23] i have seen the travail

[20:27] to the sons of men to be exercised in it
[20:31] he has made everything beautiful in his
[20:34] time
[20:36] also he has set the world in their heart
[20:39] so that no man
[20:41] can find out the work
[20:44] that god make it
[20:47] from the beginning to the end
[20:50] i know that there is no good in them
[20:54] but for a man to rejoice
[20:57] and to do good
[20:59] in his life
[21:02] and also that every man
[21:04] shall eat
[21:07] and drink
[21:09] and enjoy the good of all his labor
[21:13] it is the gift of god
[21:16] i know

[21:22] it shall be forever
[21:25] nothing can be put to it
[21:27] nor anything taken from it
[21:30] and god doeth it
[21:33] that man should fear before him

[21:37] that which has been is now
[21:40] that which
[21:42] is to be has already been
[21:45] and god required
[21:47] that which is passed
[21:50] the lord is my light
[21:54] and my salvation
[21:58] whom shall i fear

[22:04] of whom shall i be afraid
[22:08] when the wicked
[22:10] even mine enemies and my foes
[22:14] came upon me to eat up my flesh
[22:18] they stumbled and failed
[22:22] throwing hosts shouldn't camp against me
[22:26] my heart shall not fear
[22:29] though war shall rise against me
[22:32] and this will i be comforted
[22:37] one thing have i desired of the lord
[22:41] and that will i seek out there
[22:45] that i might dwell in the house of the

[51:47] she would tell the problems you
[51:50] that they were going through i want you
[51:52] to pray
[51:53] and
[51:54] i said the prize we're going to miss
[51:56] that

[52:01] my mama passed but her prayers god still
[52:04] heard her prayers
[52:06] she might have been gone a long time but
[52:08] god still was answering prayer

[53:18] into the word for a few moments and try
[53:21] to encourage you amen

[53:24] wonderful said because payday is coming
[53:27] after a while
[53:28] amen and i want you to put your time in
[53:31] because payday is coming out the world
[53:34] whatever you're doing is not worth
[53:36] losing your soul
[53:38] amen
[53:39] because if you put she believed that's
[53:41] why she it didn't matter cove it didn't
[53:43] matter what i'm going to church
[53:47] she was putting her time in i'm coming
[53:50] it doesn't matter if she wasn't feeling
[53:52] good or whatever i'm coming to church
[53:55] amen she put a time in i believe god
[53:58] recognized faithfulness
[54:01] it's how you feel about god you want god
[54:03] to feel good about you but how do you
[54:05] feel about god
[54:08] you you i don't care or the biggest
[54:10] sinners or or whatever they do amen when
[54:13] it comes down to dying and having a
[54:15] funeral everybody going to heaven you
[54:17] know that ain't right
[54:18] the bible said broad is the way that
[54:20] leading to destruction there's going to
[54:21] be many straight and narrow to get the
[54:24] leader to righteousness everybody that
[54:26] died don't go to heaven
[54:28] matter of fact i told them
[54:30] amen the heaven i was talking about the
[54:33] seven dimensions
[54:34] and and
[54:36] and jesus amen god is up in the seventh
[54:40] when when a saint die he goes into the
[54:42] sixth dimension that's why the bible
[54:44] said
[54:46] the dead in christ shall rise first and
[54:48] we that alive and remain shall be caught
[54:50] up together to meet the lord in the air
[54:53] amen there's going to be a rapture and
[54:54] then we go into the seventh dimension
[54:57] but right now they go into a resting
[54:59] place amen
[55:01] somewhat like a paradise someone like
[55:03] abraham bosom but it become a time where
[55:05] we can go and sit at the marriage supper
[55:07] of the lamb and sit down and amen
[55:11] and i'm gonna say welcome home
[55:13] amen
[55:15] so here in uh
[55:16] first corinthians 15 and 50
[55:19] it reads
[55:24] let's just bow for a moment father in
[55:27] jesus name may you bless this family
[55:29] comfort their hearts strengthen each and
[55:31] every one
[55:32] lord bless your word now in jesus name
[55:35] amen
[55:37] now this i say brethren the flesh and
[55:40] blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god
[55:44] neither does corruption inherit
[55:45] incorruption behold i show you a mystery
[55:49] we should not all sleep but we shall be
[55:51] changed
[55:52] in the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[55:54] at the last trump for the trump shall
[55:56] sound and the dead shall be raised
[55:58] incorruptible
[56:00] and we shall be what
[56:02] change oh ain't got bobolda well we
[56:05] shall be changed isn't that right
[56:07] we shall be changed
[56:09] i'm talking about
[56:11] that's what i want to talk to you about
[56:13] being changed amen we shall be changed
[56:16] remember
[56:17] you know the old timers would say in the
[56:19] bible says as a tree fall that's the way
[56:22] it's gonna lie
[56:23] don't don't
[56:25] don't die in your sin
[56:27] and actually want to go to heaven
[56:30] because jesus made a way for you
[56:33] to get out of sin
[56:35] when he died on the cross and shedded
[56:37] his precious blood he had made provision
[56:40] for you to
[56:42] accept him and as your savior and that
[56:45] he died in your place
[56:47] so you don't have to die and
[56:50] be lost
[56:52] uh uh can i say that word you don't have
[56:54] to die and go to hell
[56:56] are you up man
[56:59] are you with me but you can die right
[57:01] you can amen you can fall right when you
[57:04] go down right you can rise right
[57:06] but you go down wrong don't expect to
[57:08] come up right
[57:10] but you know the story that folks tell
[57:12] you like you can die wrong and lit and
[57:16] rise and you're gonna be a saint all of
[57:18] a sudden
[57:19] uh hi you know and we're looking at all
[57:22] these great people that's dying and uh
[57:25] maybe movie stars and maybe football
[57:28] basketball or all these great people
[57:31] that folks admire but when no folk die
[57:34] amen they they wasn't serving the lord
[57:37] they wasn't trying to get to church and
[57:38] getting god's house
[57:40] amen but they died and everybody said
[57:43] well thank the lord they're going to
[57:45] heaven now
[57:47] you know what i'm saying if you don't
[57:48] enjoy god right now on this side how you
[57:51] think you would get into heaven all of a
[57:53] sudden you're going to enjoy jesus
[57:55] you got to enjoy somebody say i want to
[57:57] go with jesus here no you don't
[58:00] if you want to go where jesus is you
[58:02] will go now why are you here why are you
[58:05] living
[58:06] amen what i mean
[58:08] because remember the attitude that you
[58:11] have now that's the attitude that you
[58:13] have when you wake up in the morning
[58:16] if you don't want him now you wouldn't
[58:17] want him then
[58:19] because you're not gonna wake up
[58:21] all of a sudden i want to live for you
[58:22] god no you didn't want to live for him
[58:24] then when you get up you ain't getting
[58:26] up another whole another new person
[58:28] you're getting up just like you went
[58:30] down
[58:31] amen and when you get up you're gonna
[58:34] have to face god and
[58:37] and folks said well i thought
[58:39] everybody no everybody don't go to
[58:41] heaven i know what happened lord you
[58:43] asked god to forgive you of your sin
[58:44] you're going to help oh come on
[58:47] amen that is right but it's got to be
[58:50] something that's coming from the heart
[58:53] and
[58:53] and god recognizing that and you meaning
[58:57] it with your heart that you want to
[58:59] change and god will give you that
[59:00] ability to change
[59:04] god will give you the ability amen for
[59:06] what you really want god to do for you
[59:09] if you believe god will do it for you
[59:11] then why ask god to do something you
[59:13] don't want him to do
[59:15] a lot of people ask god god i want you
[59:18] to save me but you don't want to be
[59:20] saved you want to live like a devil and
[59:22] you want god to save you
[59:24] and live like you won't say i'm saved
[59:26] yeah you're saved from what
[59:29] see when we're saved we're saved from
[59:31] sin
[59:32] are you with me that's what he saved you
[59:34] for the life that we used to live that's
[59:37] what he saves us from
[59:39] he don't save us to keep on doing the
[59:41] same thing and talking about we saved
[59:44] god gives us a new life
[59:48] i said we shall be
[59:50] changed that's what i'm talking we shall
[59:52] be changed and and
[59:55] if we're going to be changed in the
[59:57] future we got to want to be changing now
[1:00:00] if we don't want to be changed now
[1:00:03] i mean you know
[1:00:05] how can we believe the devil and all he
[1:00:08] takes us through we're going to believe
[1:00:10] his lie that i that he can give us
[1:00:12] something better than god got for us
[1:00:15] the one that made us amen he knows
[1:00:17] what's best for us but
[1:00:19] but
[1:00:20] sometimes we just
[1:00:22] we're just convinced that the devil oh
[1:00:24] i'm having a good time i'm having a ball
[1:00:26] amen i need a drink i need a
[1:00:30] you know i need this i need god
[1:00:32] you know
[1:00:34] oftentimes i say
[1:00:36] god promises to apply all of our needs
[1:00:39] not all of our wants
[1:00:41] and what we want we don't need and what
[1:00:43] we need we don't want them
[1:00:45] are you with me
[1:00:47] so uh oftentimes we miss the blessings
[1:00:50] of god because we think amen what we
[1:00:53] have is so good that we don't want to
[1:00:55] give it up
[1:00:57] amen and that's what the problem is what
[1:01:00] uh jesus said on one occasion what
[1:01:02] prophet a man to gain the whole world
[1:01:04] and to lose his soul
[1:01:06] are you up there so you don't want to
[1:01:09] amen engage in this life in sin and in
[1:01:13] the things of this world amen and lose
[1:01:16] out on heaven
[1:01:18] praise god if you want to go to heaven
[1:01:21] jesus i go to prepare a place for you
[1:01:24] that where i am you may be also
[1:01:27] and then if you're going to prepare a
[1:01:29] place you've got to get prepared to go
[1:01:31] to that place
[1:01:33] amen if you get prepared this is your
[1:01:35] dressing room as my old bishop used to
[1:01:38] say this is your dressing room you're
[1:01:40] dressing up for where you want to go
[1:01:43] are you a man
[1:01:44] so
[1:01:46] if you dress up amen and put on the
[1:01:48] right put on
[1:01:50] the whole arm of god put on
[1:01:52] righteousness put on holiness put on
[1:01:54] sanctification put on this new man
[1:01:58] this new man amen
[1:02:00] and and god wants you
[1:02:02] to see
[1:02:03] you recreated in christ jesus unto good
[1:02:06] works
[1:02:07] where you can live in peace
[1:02:10] and in the love of god radiates from you
[1:02:12] and you can feel that love that he
[1:02:14] really cares for you amen and he's done
[1:02:17] a work in your life amen gives you the
[1:02:20] peace and the love amen because some
[1:02:22] folks are scared of god as a little
[1:02:24] guard don't do them on some crazy
[1:02:27] something you know people are scared to
[1:02:28] come to church they're scared amen they
[1:02:31] let jesus in he knocks on the door of
[1:02:33] their heart they say oh no why because
[1:02:36] they're scared that they might change
[1:02:40] and we shall be
[1:02:42] changed but they're scared of change
[1:02:45] amen because they're so used to the life
[1:02:47] that they're living until they're
[1:02:49] fearful because they don't know what to
[1:02:50] expect
[1:02:52] amen but if we
[1:02:54] oh are you with me but you can expect
[1:02:57] god to do you good amen and god to bless
[1:03:00] your life and give you more than you
[1:03:03] could ever imagine
[1:03:05] amen the bible said he he do for us more
[1:03:08] than we can actually think
[1:03:10] god will bless us in such a mighty way
[1:03:12] you wish that i would have gave jesus my
[1:03:15] life a long time ago
[1:03:17] amen i gave him my life a long time ago
[1:03:20] and i'm not disappointed
[1:03:23] amen praise god i thank god as a young
[1:03:26] man that god came by and i was willing
[1:03:28] to say yes lord
[1:03:30] and god is giving you this opportunity
[1:03:32] amen the change has to be made now it
[1:03:36] don't make it's no change you're going
[1:03:38] to make when you go in the grave
[1:03:41] and when you die you ain't ain't no
[1:03:43] changing now
[1:03:44] amen you've already made your decision
[1:03:48] and i'm saying you can make your
[1:03:49] decision what amen that you're gonna
[1:03:51] believe jesus or you're gonna keep on
[1:03:54] believing the devil lie that i you know
[1:03:57] i'm this and i'm that don't let the
[1:03:59] devil fool you and don't let these lion
[1:04:01] preachers tell you lies
[1:04:04] there's so many lion preachers
[1:04:06] people go to a church of convenience go
[1:04:08] to a preacher that's gonna tell them
[1:04:10] lies and they're gonna feel good
[1:04:12] and it won't make no changes in their
[1:04:14] life because they don't have to change
[1:04:16] because the preacher is the lion
[1:04:17] preacher
[1:04:18] are you a man
[1:04:20] so they go to the church where the
[1:04:22] preacher telling lies
[1:04:24] nobody got ain't nobody good nobody
[1:04:27] writing nobody
[1:04:29] perfect
[1:04:30] they want to they want to hear that
[1:04:31] nobody perfect god will forgive you
[1:04:34] y'all god will but god is expecting
[1:04:37] amen
[1:04:38] if he didn't say be holy as i'm holy and
[1:04:41] he said be your perfect as your father
[1:04:42] which is in heavenly spirit then god
[1:04:44] must make revision for you to be like
[1:04:47] that
[1:04:48] amen god can sanctify you he can clean
[1:04:51] your life up if you want to be clean are
[1:04:54] you with me
[1:04:55] i can't uh
[1:04:56] i got to stop
[1:04:58] ain't got good
[1:05:00] that's the kind of preaching
[1:05:02] that
[1:05:04] sister may say
[1:05:06] that's the kind of preaching she
[1:05:07] listened to
[1:05:08] i said god loves every one of y'all
[1:05:11] grandchildren god love you
[1:05:14] great grands god love you
[1:05:16] glad to see y'all beautiful faces
[1:05:19] amen
[1:05:21] but she stood in the gap
[1:05:23] that you can make a honest decision that
[1:05:26] god loves you better than she loves you
[1:05:30] and she would want
[1:05:32] you to give jesus christ your life
[1:05:35] but i'm not just saying that because i'm
[1:05:37] trying to work with your emotion
[1:05:39] i believe it with my heart that she
[1:05:41] would want you
[1:05:42] to serve the lord
[1:05:44] because he knew she knows the results
[1:05:47] that payday is coming after a while and
[1:05:50] one day
[1:05:51] we
[1:05:52] you know i thought it's three o'clock
[1:05:54] the other mornings before sister may say
[1:05:57] passed away
[1:05:58] i got up and
[1:05:59] i started writing this message we shall
[1:06:02] be changed
[1:06:04] i told my wife
[1:06:06] i said
[1:06:08] somebody's getting ready to die
[1:06:10] and she said
[1:06:12] i just didn't know at the time who it
[1:06:14] was
[1:06:16] and i says well this is the message
[1:06:19] and i held it back
[1:06:21] for a few days and then
[1:06:23] we got the sister may shack pass
[1:06:27] and i said well
[1:06:28] i thought about many things three
[1:06:30] o'clock that morning i got up sat at the
[1:06:32] table and i started writing
[1:06:35] the things that i was thinking about
[1:06:38] i said
[1:06:39] mustard was
[1:06:40] god was just getting me ready
[1:06:43] to talk to y'all and tell y'all amen
[1:06:48] since the may check at the end of the
[1:06:49] road she
[1:06:51] steps got shot she got weak
[1:06:57] but she knew that
[1:06:58] god promised
[1:07:01] if our earthly house of this tabernacle
[1:07:03] were to be done
[1:07:05] that we have another building not made
[1:07:07] with hand
[1:07:09] god got a better place a better house to
[1:07:11] live in
[1:07:12] she trusted that god
[1:07:14] had something better
[1:07:17] god would give her a new body
[1:07:20] a body with no more pain no more
[1:07:22] sickness no more sorrow
[1:07:24] no more disappointments
[1:07:26] a lot of times we have to go through
[1:07:28] those things
[1:07:29] brother and sister i trust the same god
[1:07:31] that she trusted
[1:07:33] that god got a better place that he
[1:07:35] prepared for us
[1:07:37] that's why john said i saw a new heaven
[1:07:40] and a newer for the first heaven and
[1:07:42] first effort passed away and there was
[1:07:44] no mercy
[1:07:46] and as john saw the new jerusalem
[1:07:49] i believe that it's in view brother and
[1:07:51] sister god has a home
[1:07:53] and one day he said welcome home amen to
[1:07:57] those that prepared themselves
[1:07:59] to go to this place
[1:08:01] where the streets are paid with gold
[1:08:04] praise god
[1:08:06] so all the money that you get don't mean
[1:08:08] nothing
[1:08:09] god got a mansion waiting on you
[1:08:12] if you can only believe it
[1:08:14] and receive
[1:08:16] god's peace
[1:08:17] god's love
[1:08:19] the one that shed his precious blood and
[1:08:21] died for your sins god bless you let us
[1:08:24] by his
[1:08:29] father in jesus name
[1:08:31] [Music]
[1:08:32] jesus you said that i am the way the
[1:08:34] truth and the life
[1:08:36] no man can come to the father except he
[1:08:38] come by me
[1:08:40] father you prepared a place
[1:08:43] for those that would believe you and
[1:08:45] trust you
[1:08:47] i trusted somebody here
[1:08:49] today
[1:08:53] would say that one day i want to hear
[1:08:54] you say well done
[1:08:57] good and faithful servant

[1:09:03] brother and sister

[1:09:10] i believe our sister may shack made a
[1:09:12] decision one day
[1:09:14] and when she made that decision nothing
[1:09:16] could stop her
[1:09:18] she was gonna serve the lord
[1:09:21] in spite of all that goes on around her
[1:09:24] and all that goes on
[1:09:26] she made a decision
[1:09:29] i choose jesus
