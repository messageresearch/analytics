[32:58] The Book of Romans 7 we thank the lord
[33:02] it's late in the evening the sun going
[33:04] down and very important that we know who
[33:08] we are and and our position in
[33:13] Christ
[33:15] amen you
[33:19] don't it's not just that we come to
[33:21] church that
[33:25] we we come to Mount Zion we come to the
[33:29] New Jerusalem and innumerable company of
[33:32] Angels the Church of the firstborn is
[33:35] written in
[33:36] heaven uh are you with
[33:40] me because you are here we can testify
[33:43] of
[33:45] that know ye not Brethren speak to them
[33:49] that know the law how that the law has
[33:53] dominion over man so long as he what for
[33:57] the woman which has a husband is bound
[33:59] by what Bound by law to her husband so
[34:03] long as he what live but if the husband
[34:08] be dead she is loose from the law of a
[34:14] husband so then if why her husband
[34:17] liveth she be married to another man she
[34:20] is called a
[34:22] what but if her husband be dead she is
[34:26] free from the
[34:28] law so that she is no or what though she
[34:33] be married to another
[34:36] man wherefore my brethren you also are
[34:40] become dead to the law by the body of
[34:44] Christ that ye should be married to
[34:47] another even to him that is raised from
[34:50] the dead that ye should bring forth
[34:52] fruit unto
[34:55] who
[34:57] God bless read this word you may be
[35:06] seated it's
[35:08] good Bound By The Law of our
[35:13] love I trust that you you're not serving
[35:17] God
[35:20] because
[35:21] amen it's the
[35:24] law and we know that law
[35:27] without some means of
[35:31] enforcement then it's
[35:34] not you know people don't have to
[35:37] respect it because it's not in
[35:40] force but when you got the police the
[35:45] Army and all of that to enforce the law
[35:48] and we know if we break the law
[35:51] then it's
[35:54] punishment there's a penalty that we
[35:57] must
[35:58] pay if we break the
[36:01] law the penalty in the Garden of
[36:05] Eden because God word says you may
[36:09] freely eat of every tree of the garden
[36:10] except the tree of knowledge and good
[36:12] and
[36:12] evil if you eat a that tree if you touch
[36:16] it the day you do that you're going to
[36:20] what
[36:22] die
[36:25] so
[36:28] the day that Adam and Eve ate of the
[36:31] tree of knowledge good and evil it
[36:33] brought death upon
[36:38] everyone that means all all
[36:41] creation had a death penalty before then
[36:45] nothing
[36:47] died there was no such thing as as they
[36:51] KN knew what death felt like Not only
[36:54] was death but the attributes of death
[36:58] which is sickness and pain and
[37:01] sorrow those attributes we never felt
[37:05] Adam never felt what it like to have a
[37:07] toothache a headache a
[37:10] heartache never had anything to worry
[37:14] about because he had eternal
[37:18] life there was no such thing as death
[37:20] there was no such thing as lust there's
[37:23] no such thing as you know sin as we know
[37:27] it in attributes of sin and all we
[37:30] didn't have to go through all these
[37:32] emotional things because didn't
[37:37] exist the only thing that Adam and Eve
[37:39] had that was
[37:42] different they
[37:44] had perfect
[37:48] love see because God himself is the
[37:52] Fountain of
[37:55] love Jesus expressed it if you love me
[37:58] keep my what
[38:01] Commandments are we in love with him or
[38:04] are we Bound by the
[38:08] law I was just teaching up in Tennessee
[38:11] the other day about Bound By The Law of
[38:14] love talking to marriage couples are you
[38:17] Bound by the law or you Bound by
[38:19] love thought i' just share some of those
[38:22] things with you because many
[38:25] marriages people would get out of it if
[38:28] they had an
[38:30] opportunity
[38:32] because they no longer in
[38:36] love they they fell into the lust fail
[38:40] they thought how how hon he is and how
[38:43] beautiful she is and it was a it was an
[38:49] emotional
[38:52] attraction that when they after they got
[38:55] married they didn't know
[38:57] what they were marrying or who they were
[39:00] marrying so it was a lot of
[39:02] disappointment because I didn't really
[39:04] know this particular
[39:07] individual I was
[39:09] more uh I was more into it because of
[39:13] the outside
[39:14] looks I didn't know what kind of person
[39:18] this was I never knew the person I knew
[39:21] she looked good I know he looked good I
[39:26] was
[39:27] I was
[39:28] emotionally
[39:30] attracted so my emotions was running
[39:33] away with
[39:35] me you know what I'm saying so I got
[39:38] emotionally involved and that didn't
[39:41] mean that I
[39:43] really I I love I I I like what I
[39:48] saw but I didn't
[39:50] know that it was only outside
[39:54] thing the beauty that's in the heart the
[39:58] beauty that's on the
[39:59] inside is what we supposed to be looking
[40:03] for character and not
[40:06] outside
[40:08] Beauty but we want we're so blind by the
[40:12] outside that we don't see the inside we
[40:16] when we must ask God to show us the
[40:19] inward
[40:20] side with this
[40:23] person the prophet was talking about
[40:25] invisible Union
[40:27] the man was buying cattle or whatever
[40:31] and he looked at the
[40:33] cow and he looked at the eyes and he
[40:36] wonder what what what is he doing he
[40:38] looking in the carow he is buying stock
[40:43] you know buying
[40:46] cows no I don't want that one on W you
[40:49] wonder why you don't want that one say I
[40:52] can look in the
[40:55] eyes you
[40:57] know she got wild
[41:01] eyes and those wild eyes mean she'll
[41:03] never make a
[41:05] mother are you with me so he was looking
[41:09] at the eyes and realized that she would
[41:12] never make a mother she'll run away and
[41:15] won't take care of her babies and
[41:18] all you know so you understand
[41:23] sometimes if you don't know how to Des
[41:27] discern you might be Discerning from the
[41:30] outside it might be looking nice and
[41:31] healthy but you didn't know to look into
[41:33] the eyes and
[41:35] see but he had a revelation that she had
[41:39] those wild eyes you better leave alone
[41:43] so by the grace of
[41:45] God um often
[41:48] times we got to have the spirit of
[41:52] discerning and the word of God is a
[41:55] discern of thoughts in the tense of the
[41:58] heart you got to see whether or not an
[42:00] individual love
[42:02] God whether that person is a true born
[42:05] again Christian I've seen a lot of
[42:08] things happen in
[42:11] church I've seen good
[42:14] people good
[42:16] intention and I've seen people that were
[42:19] looking for something on the outward
[42:20] appearance and missing what God had for
[42:23] them because they was all called up on
[42:26] the
[42:27] outside and so I see I seen people make
[42:30] major
[42:33] mistakes in their
[42:35] companionship because they were all
[42:37] about outside
[42:39] Beauty and never was looking for
[42:42] character so young people look for
[42:45] character not outside Beauty cuz that
[42:49] outside are fool you in a
[42:51] minute but you need somebody who
[42:54] respects God who got a revelation of
[42:57] Jesus Christ who have the baptism of the
[42:59] Holy
[43:01] Ghost oh
[43:03] yes beauty is
[43:06] vain you know it it it would deceive
[43:10] you the devil got caught up in how he
[43:12] was looking because he was Lucifer the
[43:15] covered Cher of him he's so beautiful
[43:17] you know what I'm saying but he got
[43:19] lifted up in his Beauty are you with me
[43:23] so what happens is it's difficult to
[43:26] be a very hon and goodlooking a very
[43:31] beautiful
[43:33] outwardly and not get lifted
[43:36] up and think
[43:38] oh how handsome I am how cute I am we
[43:42] spend they said that people spend
[43:45] billions of
[43:46] dollars try working on the
[43:50] outside and they might not spend $10
[43:53] working on the
[43:55] inside
[43:57] not knowing that no matter how much you
[43:58] spend on the outside it ain't nothing
[44:00] but
[44:02] dirt it's going to
[44:05] perish but instead of spending time on
[44:08] the inside they spend more time on the
[44:11] outside Beauty how I look on the outside
[44:16] and they fall in love with the outside
[44:18] but have no
[44:20] idea what they
[44:22] Maring what's on the
[44:25] inside
[44:30] okay Bound By The Law of our love people
[44:35] come to
[44:36] church there a lot of people say I
[44:39] believe the message of the hour I come
[44:41] to church and you know I believe M 4 I
[44:45] do this I I believe Jesus died for my
[44:48] sins and all do you really understand
[44:51] the magnitude of what you're saying I
[44:53] believe Jesus died for my sin
[44:56] the Bible tells
[44:58] us we love him
[45:01] because he first loved us he first loved
[45:05] us so we love him because he first loved
[45:08] us but do we understand the magnitude of
[45:11] his
[45:13] love how much he cared about us to love
[45:16] us did he love us because of how we
[45:21] look did he love us because of how good
[45:24] we were all
[45:27] because of you know I'm so so beautiful
[45:31] I'm so you know I do I'm just perfect
[45:34] and God all loved me you know what I'm
[45:37] saying or did he love
[45:40] us unconditionally you know it wasn't it
[45:44] wasn't how good we
[45:46] were
[45:48] amen God so loved the world that he gave
[45:52] what only his only begotten son
[45:57] and you know as I was
[45:59] saying the devil did not know but do you
[46:02] know are you with me do you know the
[46:06] love of
[46:07] God do you know amen the love of
[46:12] God do you know what it means to have
[46:14] the love of God in your
[46:17] heart see because the Bible teaches us
[46:20] that the Holy Ghost is a love of God
[46:24] sheded abroad in our heart amen now we
[46:27] can have a love for our kin folks and
[46:32] our
[46:33] relatives and our friends and our
[46:36] neighbors for our wives and our husband
[46:39] our children and our family but can we
[46:42] have the kind of love that God had for
[46:45] us which we call Agape Love God's
[46:51] love which is not attainable about what
[46:55] we can do
[46:57] or what we did not do or what we
[47:01] done God saved us the Bible say while we
[47:05] were yet sin Christ what he died for the
[47:09] what
[47:11] ungodly he died for us when we were look
[47:15] like
[47:17] unworthy yet he still loved us uh in
[47:21] spite of our
[47:23] unworthiness he cared enough about us to
[47:26] die for us when we were yet
[47:29] sinners Christ died for the
[47:36] ungodly often times we tell a story and
[47:39] we might think it is a good
[47:42] time the the prophet said he said you
[47:46] know he goes out over the different
[47:48] parts of the world he says I could be
[47:51] unfaithful to my
[47:53] wife he said I could be unfaithful to
[47:56] her and I can go out and live with
[47:59] another woman come
[48:01] home and ask her to forgive me and he
[48:05] said I believe she
[48:06] would I believe she loved me enough to
[48:09] forgive
[48:10] me but he
[48:12] says I couldn't hurt her like
[48:15] that I love her
[48:19] too and see a lot of us don't have that
[48:22] kind of love not even for our companion
[48:25] if something like that
[48:29] happen you're gone
[48:34] forever God you think I am G to put up
[48:37] with
[48:38] that gone I ain't G to forget uh I never
[48:42] shall forget what you done to
[48:45] me you know what I'm
[48:47] saying yet we take for granted that God
[48:53] understand when when we are unfaithful
[48:56] to
[48:57] him and that he puts up with our
[49:00] unfaithfulness to
[49:02] him and we can go to him and say Lord
[49:04] forgive me here I am
[49:07] again you know what I'm saying but to
[49:10] have the type of
[49:12] love that God had for us and the way we
[49:16] should love him but we cannot love him
[49:19] like we ought to love him and we cannot
[49:23] love one
[49:24] another who we see like we ought to love
[49:28] one another except amen God gives us the
[49:32] Holy
[49:33] Ghost are you with me other than
[49:38] that it's a eye for an
[49:40] eye and a two for a two you did it to me
[49:46] and I'm going to what I'mma do it to
[49:50] you you know what I'm saying so but are
[49:54] we Bound by the law
[49:56] are we Bound by
[49:58] love you see love will cover a
[50:03] multitude of
[50:06] sin the love would say I forgive them
[50:11] because they don't understand what
[50:13] they're
[50:14] doing but law
[50:18] says if you did it you ought to be
[50:23] punished bring judgment quickly and
[50:28] speedily for it said touch not my
[50:31] know do my Propet know better for a
[50:34] mstone to be about your neck cast into
[50:37] the
[50:40] sea you quick to pull a
[50:43] trigger or the sto throw the
[50:47] stone
[50:50] stone I'm trying to say today I got
[50:53] trouble saying that word
[51:01] Stone did I say it okay you're quick to
[51:06] throw
[51:08] it but you don't want nobody to throw it
[51:12] back but Jesus Took the one them that
[51:15] was attempted to throw one and somebody
[51:18] said he roll on the grind he exposed
[51:20] them and it
[51:24] writing and then he asked them
[51:27] okay he that without sin
[51:32] what that's why the Bible says we ought
[51:35] to forgive one another for
[51:39] Christ
[51:40] what forgave us and if we can't forgive
[51:43] one another neither do will our what
[51:46] Father which is in heaven what forgive
[51:49] us isn't that right so but a lot of
[51:53] times we don't mind forgiving those that
[51:56] we want to forgive but some folk just
[51:59] a't going too far I I
[52:03] I you
[52:05] know Stephen says when he was being
[52:08] stoned and saw was there he said lay not
[52:11] this to their what charge don't charge
[52:15] them for that and God was able to look
[52:18] back and see that one Saul that was
[52:20] standing by consenting to step's St and
[52:23] one day Saul became
[52:26] but Saul probably couldn't never
[52:29] forget amen what he done to stepen so
[52:34] Saul wanted to he wanted to die Paul
[52:36] wanted to die you know I want to die for
[52:40] this Jesus that I've come to
[52:42] know amen I I want to go appear before
[52:47] Caesar take me to Rome I'm ready to die
[52:51] I don't mind being bound because why I'm
[52:55] Bound by love not by the law I love him
[52:59] so let me die for it because my love for
[53:04] him I saw Stephen and I saw how he loved
[53:09] God I want to be inspired by your love
[53:12] for God I want your love for God one day
[53:16] and and I can see your love as
[53:18] Christians as as a child of God your
[53:21] light is shining so
[53:23] bright that men can see amen not you but
[53:27] your
[53:29] father they can see God in you and they
[53:33] want that God that's in you that's what
[53:37] I want Bound by love and not by the law
[53:42] not coming to church because simply I
[53:44] don't want to be punished I don't want
[53:47] to I don't want to be burned in the Lake
[53:48] of Fire I don't want to go to hell I I'm
[53:51] not coming to church because I fear
[53:53] going to hell
[53:57] the Bible tells us there's no fear in
[53:59] what there's no fear in love for perfect
[54:03] love castes out
[54:05] what castes out fear for fear has
[54:08] tormented is of the devil a't that right
[54:12] so I want to come to the church because
[54:15] not because amen I I don't want to go to
[54:17] hell I want to come to church and serve
[54:20] God because I love him but how can I
[54:23] love him when I I I I I I I I haven't I
[54:29] I haven't seen I haven't experienced
[54:31] whom have not seen
[54:34] yet
[54:37] huh that you're
[54:39] loveing
[54:41] amen and and
[54:44] because amen because you have that kind
[54:47] of
[54:49] love how can you love God whom you're
[54:53] not what and hate your what brother who
[54:57] you
[54:58] see are you with me you got to you know
[55:02] you got to P byass all of this uh you
[55:08] know all of this stuff that the devil
[55:10] try to bring to keep you from having
[55:13] perfect
[55:15] love because perfect faith and perfect
[55:18] love is what's going to get us out of
[55:20] here in the
[55:21] Rapture
[55:23] amen a love
[55:25] a a faith that worketh by
[55:29] love amen God see your faith amen
[55:32] because you love amen you can pray for
[55:35] somebody when you love
[55:38] them amen when you're touched by the
[55:41] feeling of their infirmities you can
[55:43] care about them even when they don't
[55:45] care about
[55:47] themselves you can love them Des spite
[55:50] of all their faults and all their
[55:52] imperfection you still can love them
[55:58] amen because often times folks don't do
[56:01] things to you they do things to
[56:04] themselves and you get upset with them
[56:08] because
[56:10] of the things that they do to
[56:14] themselves amen but just look at them
[56:17] it's a because a like of the love of God
[56:21] in their heart the reason why they do
[56:24] things
[56:26] as much as the prophet said he wouldn't
[56:30] want to hurt his
[56:31] wife you and I ought not want to hurt
[56:35] our
[56:36] husband you know who our husband is
[56:40] right I espouse you to one husband even
[56:43] who Christ Paul said I spouse you to one
[56:47] husband and that's
[56:49] Christ and because you recognize that
[56:53] you love him when you you made a
[56:55] commitment to
[56:57] him let's just go to Ephesian before I
[57:01] close I I want you to be short because I
[57:03] wanted to stick and if it give you too
[57:06] much you might
[57:11] forget all this passionate type love is
[57:15] full of passion it it'll
[57:18] dingling just get married a few years
[57:22] some of these old Saints can tell you
[57:24] about that
[57:26] that'll go way after a year or
[57:29] two the Tony probably news one in here
[57:34] but he getting used to it you get used
[57:37] to one another after a while then you
[57:40] got to really see do I really
[57:42] love you know what I'm saying cuz you
[57:45] done got used to one another now we got
[57:47] this
[57:47] something I'm B by the law do that you
[57:50] know I really love this
[57:52] person my mama used to say
[57:55] you don't get to know them till you
[57:58] Mar then you learn to love one another
[58:01] over the
[58:02] years see you work on that thing you're
[58:06] working on
[58:07] it
[58:09] amen because right right now you you can
[58:13] you know be uh attached Mo emotionally
[58:18] but you got it's some things that you
[58:20] didn't know
[58:22] existed oh I didn't know you
[58:29] this is my that my sandwich right
[58:34] there your sandwich I I I cook the
[58:39] food but I I
[58:42] specifically
[58:44] said this my
[58:46] sandwich even in the little thing you
[58:49] know all of that makes to learn one
[58:53] another are you with me
[58:55] you're learning one
[58:57] another you learning What She Likes
[59:01] you're learning what he like and what
[59:03] we're doing God is taking us through the
[59:05] Holy Spirit teaching us and training us
[59:09] for the marriage supper of the
[59:12] Lamb he's teaching us training us amen
[59:17] that you know how to
[59:19] treat one
[59:21] another and you know what God wants from
[59:24] you
[59:25] so we we're coming to
[59:28] maturity that we can handle
[59:31] things no use in putting children out
[59:34] some people that never grow
[59:36] up they always need a mom and a daddy
[59:39] but they don't know
[59:43] that you give them $10,000 they we have
[59:47] 50 Cent
[59:50] tomorrow
[59:51] why cuz they're not matured enough to
[59:54] have
[59:57] money are you with me so God gives some
[1:00:01] people a Measure of Faith and some
[1:00:03] people
[1:00:04] dism because he knows what I give
[1:00:08] you amen you wouldn't know how to handle
[1:00:11] it that why God give this that why God
[1:00:14] bless this one that bless that why he
[1:00:16] bless me like that I don't know about
[1:00:18] this
[1:00:19] God I know he know how he know what he
[1:00:22] know how to bless and who to bless with
[1:00:24] what and how to bless with what he know
[1:00:28] that's not going to cause them to get
[1:00:29] bigheaded and think they better than
[1:00:31] everybody else walk around you know with
[1:00:34] their head
[1:00:36] up you know T
[1:00:46] no head up above everybody else you know
[1:00:50] what I'm saying the more God bless you
[1:00:54] you you just say Lord I don't know why
[1:00:57] but thank you
[1:00:59] Jesus thank you Jesus now God only bless
[1:01:03] you to be a
[1:01:05] what uhhuh now let me see who I can be a
[1:01:09] blessing
[1:01:11] too God blessed me but can I be a
[1:01:14] blessing to somebody else not bless
[1:01:21] me and you want to be selfish and holy
[1:01:24] to
[1:01:26] yourself but
[1:01:28] let's let's be
[1:01:30] Distributors God you gave it to
[1:01:33] me I want to be able to be blessing to
[1:01:37] others and the most the thing that is
[1:01:41] more valuable to be blessed with is the
[1:01:43] love of God and you want to show that
[1:01:46] love and give that love
[1:01:48] out see the Apostle says silver and
[1:01:52] gold but such as our what
[1:01:55] I give unto you can you see it's more
[1:01:57] precious than silver and gold the love
[1:02:00] of God is more precious they had that
[1:02:04] love of God and the power of God was
[1:02:06] demonstrated and they were able to take
[1:02:08] the land Man by the hand and he could
[1:02:10] walk again isn't that beautiful that you
[1:02:13] can take somebody by the hand that's
[1:02:15] really strung out on drugs they may be
[1:02:18] in terrible condition but yet you can
[1:02:22] look on them and says I such as I have I
[1:02:26] don't have money I don't have this or
[1:02:28] that but I have Jesus you can have it
