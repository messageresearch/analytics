[31:34] the reading of the word we
[31:36] god is so wonderful amen
[31:39] 5 and 1 revelation 5 and 1.
[31:46] and i saw in the right hand of him that
[31:49] set
[31:50] on the throne a book written
[31:55] and within
[31:59] and on the backside seal with
[32:02] seven seals and i saw a strong
[32:05] angel proclaiming with with a loud voice
[32:09] who is worthy to open the book
[32:13] and to loose the seals thereof
[32:16] and no man in heaven
[32:20] nor in earth neither under the earth
[32:23] was able to open the book needle to look
[32:27] their own
[32:29] and i wept much because no man was found
[32:33] worthy
[32:34] to open and to read the book
[32:37] need them to look their own and one of
[32:41] the elders
[32:42] said unto me weep not behold the lion of
[32:45] the tribe of
[32:47] judah the root of david
[32:50] has prevailed to open the book
[32:54] and to loose the seven seals thereof
[32:57] and i beheld and low in the midst
[33:01] of the throne and all and of the four
[33:05] beasts and in the midst of the elders
[33:08] stood a lamb as it was slain
[33:11] had been slain having seven horns
[33:16] and seven eyes which are the seven
[33:19] spirits of god
[33:20] sent forth unto all the earth and he
[33:24] came
[33:24] and took the book out of the right hand
[33:27] of him
[33:28] that set it upon the throne and when he
[33:31] had taken the book
[33:32] the four beasts and the four and 20
[33:36] elders
[33:36] fell down before the lamb having
[33:40] every one of them hops of gold
[33:43] golden vowel full of the odors
[33:46] which are the prayers of the saints
[33:50] and they sung a new song
[33:54] saying thou are worthy to take the book
[33:58] and to open the seals thereof
[34:02] for thou was slain
[34:06] and has redeemed us to god
[34:10] by thy blood out of every
[34:13] kindreds tongues and people and nation
[34:17] and has made us unto our god
[34:21] kings and priests and we shall what
[34:25] and we shall reign well god bless you
[34:29] may you be seated it's very important we
[34:32] were
[34:34] uh dealing with the kingdom age we
[34:36] dealing with the millennium time
[34:39] and uh as we just
[34:42] continue to deal with the kingdom age we
[34:45] see how it's intertwined in here because
[34:48] he said he
[34:49] made us in the 10th verse he's made us
[34:54] unto our god kings and priests
[34:57] he's made us into our god kings and
[35:00] priests
[35:00] and in the millennium we talked about uh
[35:04] the kingdom age where the kingdom of god
[35:07] was set up amen and we
[35:10] realized that there is a period of time
[35:13] amen
[35:14] that god will uh jesus would reign
[35:18] as son of david and to set on
[35:21] the throne of david so this
[35:25] is the period of time after the great
[35:27] tribulation period
[35:28] that we call the millennium we call it
[35:33] and those feast days the feasts of
[35:35] tabernacle with god with tabernacle
[35:38] and we're talking about the the period
[35:42] of 1 000 years uh
[35:45] that would be we're still in time
[35:48] remember
[35:49] that we move from time to eternity
[35:52] but the thousand years is a time period
[35:56] so we're still dealing with time but
[35:59] that is the eternal age
[36:01] that's coming because time would be no
[36:04] more i mean we
[36:05] won't we would not be dealing with time
[36:09] amen but we're still dealing with time
[36:12] because
[36:12] and isaiah said a little child will die
[36:14] a hundred years old
[36:16] so you're still dealing with time but
[36:19] you and i
[36:20] he meant steps out of time we stepped
[36:22] into eternity
[36:24] because once you're born again and once
[36:27] you really receive the baptism the holy
[36:29] ghost
[36:29] amen then god says you
[36:33] within you you have within you the
[36:35] kingdom of god
[36:36] within you amen but i want you to see
[36:40] your position
[36:41] in christ your position this morning in
[36:44] christ
[36:45] who you are positionally placed in the
[36:48] earth today
[36:50] amen as god amen comes to claim his
[36:54] possession he comes to claim his
[36:57] amen church he came to claim that which
[37:01] he purchased with his blood
[37:03] so here we're talking about uh god
[37:06] the one that's worthy to claim amen
[37:10] he was worthy to claim and take the book
[37:14] because nobody was
[37:15] was worthy the only one was worthy amen
[37:18] it was he had to be a kinman redeemer
[37:22] the angels could not do it because they
[37:25] were not kin to the human family
[37:27] so he typed it out in boaz and ruth amen
[37:31] boaz was the nearest kinman to roof and
[37:34] he claimed the gentile bride
[37:36] are you with me amen so we understand
[37:40] that
[37:41] naomi amen which was the type of the
[37:43] jews
[37:44] when he claimed naomi he got roof also
[37:47] and have a gentile bride so in this
[37:50] age christ i mean boaz which was a type
[37:55] of christ
[37:56] has come amen to claim amen which is
[37:59] christ
[38:00] come to claim his bride are you with me
[38:04] but you had to be a ken business amen so
[38:07] he says here he said no man
[38:09] was able no man it was able to take
[38:13] man sin so man lost the title deed uh
[38:19] the abstract kind of deed went back into
[38:21] the hand of the original owner
[38:24] amen so what happens was
[38:27] man had lost his dominion he had
[38:30] dominion god gave him the earth
[38:32] and everything and he had dominion over
[38:35] everything
[38:36] so man was you know he had it blown to
[38:39] him
[38:39] but he lost it he forfeited it when he
[38:43] uh believed the lie of the devil are you
[38:45] with me so
[38:46] it was a loss amen so when man
[38:49] fell everything else fell amen the whole
[38:52] earth everything began to die
[38:55] the trees died animals everything began
[38:58] to get out of care uh it would
[39:00] get out of cater everything was just
[39:03] rapidly going down
[39:05] okay so uh here it says
[39:09] in the 10th verse he made us kings and
[39:12] priests
[39:13] and we shall reign on the earth
[39:17] see a lot of folk when they go to church
[39:20] they just looking
[39:22] to go to heaven they don't realize that
[39:24] the scripture said we shall reign where
[39:28] on the earth when is that going to take
[39:30] place
[39:31] see because the jews are very much
[39:33] interested
[39:34] master will die at this time restore the
[39:37] kingdom
[39:38] because one time they had the kingdom
[39:41] one time
[39:41] israel ruled over the nations amen
[39:44] they were in power and they they
[39:47] they fell they met when babylon came in
[39:51] and uh never canelza they came in and
[39:54] they always do
[39:55] the jews amen took over through
[39:57] jerusalem and so forth
[39:59] and they took them in captivity and
[40:01] daniel was over in captivity
[40:03] amen and uh the hebrew boys they were
[40:06] over in captivity
[40:07] and then we find out near mind and the
[40:10] loads went back
[40:11] and they began to build the walls and so
[40:13] forth so
[40:14] uh when we talk about the rubber ball
[40:17] and
[40:18] the seven horns and the seven eyes and
[40:20] so forth
[40:21] and the rebuilding of amen jerusalem in
[40:25] the natural
[40:26] amen restoration now we
[40:29] also talking about those seven eyes
[40:32] which is seven seals and
[40:34] they meant seven horns and that's a
[40:36] power
[40:37] to seven church ages are you with me so
[40:40] by the grace of god
[40:41] uh in the seven church ages amen
[40:45] god was restoring back amen that which
[40:49] adam had lost god promised that he would
[40:52] restore
[40:53] amen everything that adam lost so
[40:56] we're talking about you knowing your
[40:59] position as kings
[41:00] and priests and getting your redempted
[41:04] rights
[41:08] are you with me remember what i'm saying
[41:11] your redemptive rights
[41:16] amen what adam laws
[41:19] amen the redeemer has
[41:22] paid the price okay
[41:26] now let's just look at revelation 1 and
[41:29] 6.
[41:32] maybe i try to talk to you and
[41:36] i it it could get a little complicated
[41:39] caleb she always sitting in the right
[41:40] place he forgot all about what i told
[41:43] him
[41:45] you're sitting in the right place okay
[41:48] okay one and six it says
[41:52] and he has made who
[41:57] he's made we're talking about the
[41:58] kingdom eight he's made who
[42:01] you remember john came preaching to what
[42:03] the kingdom of what
[42:05] the kingdom of god the kingdom of heaven
[42:07] is at hand isn't that right
[42:09] john was preaching amen about a kingdom
[42:13] so if john is preaching amen and john
[42:16] was preaching the kingdom of heaven is
[42:18] at hand
[42:19] amen but the reason why
[42:22] the jews rejected the king
[42:26] other than that if they would receive
[42:28] jesus christ
[42:29] then the kingdom would have been
[42:31] restored then but they're rejecting them
[42:33] amen
[42:34] but that was all in the purpose and in
[42:35] the plain of god
[42:38] if they could have received and the
[42:39] bible said they were blind
[42:41] for our sakes isn't that right so the
[42:45] that the gentiles could come in
[42:48] but we as a wild olive tree amen
[42:51] in romans 11 we were grafted in amen
[42:55] praise god we were wild we were gentiles
[42:58] but god
[42:58] granted us in amen well we are not to
[43:02] boast against the root
[43:05] are you with me because they were the
[43:07] rule amen
[43:09] and we were grating in to the olive tree
[43:12] amen so by the grace of god god blinded
[43:16] israel for our sakes that they could
[43:19] reject him
[43:20] that the gentiles amen could be
[43:23] fellow and fellow citizens
[43:27] in the kingdom of god god made a way
[43:31] proficient he meant that you and i
[43:34] could be a part of his kingdom
[43:37] are you with me and
[43:40] so by the grace of god he's made us
[43:44] that that brings us to the elevated
[43:46] state we're not just
[43:47] coming to church and we're not just
[43:50] uh church goals or traditional believers
[43:54] amen we are somebody special we are king
[43:58] he made us he made us
[44:01] kings and priests amen
[44:04] i'm going to tell you something amen
[44:06] you're not going to conduct yourself
[44:08] properly
[44:09] if you don't know your position and who
[44:11] you are
[44:12] i i if you don't know who you are the
[44:14] devil can
[44:15] uh you know i i i you know i look at me
[44:19] you know it's something that you allow
[44:21] the devil
[44:22] to make you a subject to his old demonic
[44:26] those demon powers and and
[44:30] have sinned the bible says sin shall not
[44:32] have
[44:33] dominion over you
[44:36] amen god gave you dominion over
[44:39] sin over the devil amen
[44:43] amen god made you amen kings and priests
[44:47] sin shall not have dominion over you but
[44:50] look at
[44:50] us amen people why
[44:53] why do you let the devil lie to you and
[44:56] deceive you and trick you
[44:58] amen the bible said adam was not
[45:00] deceived but the woman being the seed
[45:02] was in the transgression isn't that
[45:03] right
[45:04] praise god now we know that being in
[45:07] adam being in christ which is the last
[45:09] adam
[45:10] being in christ we cannot be deceived
[45:12] because we're in him
[45:13] if you abide in me and my word abide in
[45:15] you you can ask what you will and i'll
[45:17] do it isn't that right
[45:18] so god amen in christ amen
[45:22] as long as you back in adam you're not
[45:25] separated from adam
[45:26] amen the twain become one
[45:30] are you with me so god places you back
[45:33] into christ for by one spirit we are
[45:36] baptized not in two bodies
[45:38] but by one spirit we are baptized into
[45:41] what
[45:42] one body that is christ so the the eve
[45:45] had come back
[45:46] into adam amen and amen
[45:50] you cannot be deceived because adam
[45:52] could not be deceived
[45:53] but the woman being the seed was in the
[45:55] transgression why because adam was the
[45:57] original seed
[45:59] eve was a byproduct of adam
[46:02] are you a man so brother and sister
[46:05] recognizing who you are amen you come
[46:08] back
[46:09] into your position headship has come to
[46:12] the body
[46:14] amen so you have your emit restored
[46:17] dominion
[46:19] god has given you restoration amen
[46:22] oh
[46:26] let me slow down because i want you to
[46:28] understand because
[46:30] you know i look at people i said why are
[46:32] you going people want to look like the
[46:34] devil
[46:34] act like the devil they want to be
[46:36] devils

[46:41] my eyes
[46:42] it makes me want to cry that hey
[46:45] all this is available to you all this
[46:49] word

[46:52] you want to
[46:53] sell it out for muscle meat

[46:59] you mean to tell me you ex you know
[47:02] all the devil is often used a little bit
[47:04] of time
[47:05] to have a little bit of fun a little bit
[47:07] of pleasure for just a little season
[47:11] amen
[47:14] a little season and then all of that
[47:18] wasted why because you listen to the
[47:20] devil's lie
[47:22] look
[47:25] the bible the prophet god said if we're
[47:28] deceived we willfully deceive
[47:32] god blinded is grown you know for his
[47:35] for our sakes but if we're blind we
[47:38] willfully blind
[47:40] amen lay out a seal is blind naked and
[47:44] don't know
[47:44] it amen
[47:49] you ought to know better amen because
[47:53] it's given you to you to know the
[47:54] mysteries of the kingdom isn't that

[59:18] kingman redeemer
[59:20] praise god he said i i i'm gonna pay the
[59:23] price

[59:29] was god
[59:30] but he was doing it to claim his bride
[59:34] god had a purpose and a plan in mind and
[59:37] he wasn't going to let you stay
[59:39] in sin so god wanted to claim
[59:43] you amen a spotless bride

[1:00:06] praise god the only reason you stay like
[1:00:08] that is you don't believe that you're
[1:00:10] sons and daughters of god but if you
[1:00:12] ever
[1:00:12] accept the fact amen you know the devil
[1:00:15] said you know the son of god
[1:00:17] you might as well forget it if and then
[1:00:19] the devil got a trick
[1:00:20] you know he throw a curveball you know
[1:00:22] he don't throw no fastball he throw a
[1:00:24] curve one

[1:00:27] he said
[1:00:28] hey if you if you're meant to be saved
[1:00:31] you're going to be saved anyhow
[1:00:37] so you know it's just like saying
[1:00:40] you know if i go out and commit a doctor
[1:00:42] on my wife
[1:00:43] my wife's gonna forgive me anyhow
[1:00:47] what kind of person is that if i go out
[1:00:51] and run around on them she gonna forgive
[1:00:52] me anyhow
[1:00:54] when we do our god like that uh
[1:00:57] the bible says my little children are
[1:01:00] writing to you that you sin not
[1:01:02] but if any man sinned he said i don't
[1:01:04] want you to go out and do wrong just to
[1:01:06] go out if you love the lord do you
[1:01:08] you're not you're not going to do the
[1:01:09] lord in any kind of way
[1:01:11] but you know the devil is very tricky
[1:01:13] and he's very sly
[1:01:15] he's very crafty and he he can woo
[1:01:18] you away and all he takes is about a
[1:01:20] moment amen to capture your
[1:01:22] attention and get your mind amen off
[1:01:26] of your position who you really are
[1:01:30] and then he'll twist you as fast as he
[1:01:33] can twist you
[1:01:34] and next thing you know you're doing
[1:01:36] something but
[1:01:37] when you come to yourself one thing
