[27:14] amen amen
[27:18] if you have your bibles
[27:25] the book of philippians
[27:35] philippians 2.
[27:50] i want to start
[27:52] from the 12th
[27:54] verse to the 15th
[28:05] wherefore my brethren wherefore my
[28:07] beloved
[28:10] have ye
[28:11] have always obeyed
[28:14] not as in my presence only
[28:18] but now much more in my absence
[28:22] work out
[28:24] your own salvation
[28:27] with fear and
[28:28] trembling for it is god which worketh in
[28:32] you
[28:34] both to will and to do of his good
[28:36] pleasure
[28:38] do all things without murmuring and
[28:40] disputing
[28:42] that you may be blameless and harmless
[28:45] the sons of god
[28:47] without rebuke in the midst of a crooked
[28:50] and perverse nation
[28:53] among whom you shine as lights
[28:55] in the world
[28:57] holding forth the word of life
[29:00] that i may rejoice in the day of christ
[29:03] that i have not run in vain
[29:06] neither labor
[29:08] in vain
[29:10] let us pray father we thank you god for
[29:13] the reading of your word god we pray
[29:15] that you just bless it in jesus name
[29:18] amen amen
[29:23] i
[29:27] i want to just use for
[29:32] a thought tonight
[29:36] work out your own salvation
[29:41] work out
[29:42] your own
[29:44] salvation
[29:47] and i want to if you don't mind i want
[29:49] to just read a little
[29:51] uh
[29:52] footnote in
[29:54] my bible that seemed to correspond to
[29:59] what i want to try to bring and i'm not
[30:02] mean to belong tonight but
[30:04] just a little thought that's where you
[30:06] can kind of see where
[30:08] i am heading and what i was really
[30:10] looking at
[30:12] and it says here now my thought remember
[30:15] coming from the
[30:16] uh
[30:18] 12th verse
[30:20] working out your own salvation
[30:24] and every one of us each one of us
[30:27] individually
[30:30] has to
[30:31] understand
[30:35] what am i doing
[30:37] and how am i going by to do it
[30:41] i would listen to something the servant
[30:43] of god was saying the other day he said
[30:47] it's the way we present it to the people
[30:52] the way we present the gospel to the
[30:55] people and how they
[30:58] receive it
[31:00] but it's basically our presentation how
[31:03] do you
[31:04] present it to him
[31:08] so tonight we want to look at working
[31:11] out
[31:12] your own salvation but
[31:16] you know and i know that
[31:18] it's not that you work to get salvation
[31:25] because salvation is already a finished
[31:28] work
[31:33] but i
[31:34] now am understanding that
[31:38] uh
[31:39] when you present it to the people
[31:45] then it's taking
[31:47] uh in a certain way that
[31:50] sometimes they don't really catch the
[31:53] essence of even just working out your
[31:57] own salvation
[32:00] now salvation is
[32:03] deliverance
[32:04] from the power
[32:07] and effect of sin
[32:11] that what
[32:12] salvation is really all about
[32:16] deliverance from the power
[32:20] and the effect
[32:21] of sin
[32:23] let me just read this here so i can get
[32:25] it out of the way the way i want it said
[32:28] god has already wrought
[32:32] salvation
[32:37] in them talk about the philippians
[32:39] carrying it to its logical conclusion
[32:43] god has granted
[32:45] us of them salvation
[32:48] not just for their own prophet
[32:51] but for the good of others as well
[32:56] if they work out
[32:58] and manifest i like that
[33:01] the new life divinely
[33:04] worked in them
[33:06] see
[33:08] they will live lives worthy
[33:11] of the gospel
[33:13] [Music]
[33:16] in harmony
[33:17] with each other
[33:19] seeking
[33:20] the progress
[33:22] of the gospel they will also regard one
[33:26] another
[33:27] as more important than their own self
[33:34] so in working out
[33:38] your salvation
[33:42] if it's presented right if it's taken
[33:46] by faith because the only way that you
[33:50] really are going to benefit is that it
[33:53] has to be
[33:54] uh taken by
[33:56] faith
[34:01] no church can give you salvation
[34:05] no preacher no
[34:07] a certain denomination or anything but
[34:10] it only comes through what jesus christ
[34:14] has already done
[34:19] a finished work
[34:21] and the bible state now there's south
[34:23] there's no other salvation given among
[34:26] men whereby we ought to be saved in
[34:29] through the name of jesus christ
[34:32] so no other name no other title no creed
[34:36] no doubt only through what jesus christ
[34:40] has already done for you and now
[34:48] and when it's believed by faith
[34:51] you must first believe it
[34:56] the bible says one place without faith
[34:59] it is impossible
[35:03] so it must be by
[35:06] faith
[35:09] that you're working out
[35:13] whatever jesus christ has done for you
[35:17] at calvary
[35:19] it belongs to you
[35:22] [Music]
[35:25] you become the bitter fishery
[35:29] [Music]
[35:30] of what jesus has done by your faith
[35:37] not the church faith or you know any
[35:40] preacher's faith but you alone
[35:46] and to believe that to to believe what
[35:49] he did and carry and give you an
[35:53] assurance
[35:57] it changes
[36:00] the way you conduct yourself
[36:03] [Music]
[36:06] you don't live yourself your life for
[36:08] yours but you're living it for others
[36:13] jesus whole life
[36:17] he came to live it for us
[36:22] for the whole world
[36:27] i want to say he was god's
[36:29] requirement
[36:33] for what mankind needed to be done
[36:40] everything that god wanted to do he did
[36:44] it through jesus christ
[36:48] through the life that he lived
[36:53] i want to stress that soul matter
[36:56] because only through the life that we
[36:59] live
[37:02] that reflects god amen
[37:06] and when their life is lived correctly
[37:10] it is
[37:11] manifesting god life through you and i
[37:17] jesus said if i be lifted up
[37:22] how is he going to be lift up
[37:25] if we are not living the correct life
[37:30] the god purpose was to manifest
[37:34] himself
[37:36] through jesus christ now through you and
[37:40] i am amen
[37:42] so you become the very manifestation
[37:46] of god again
[37:54] amen guarding flesh
[37:58] manifesting himself again
[38:03] in your own neighborhood
[38:06] on your job wherever you go
[38:10] your life is expressing
[38:14] god
[38:15] to this generation right here
[38:19] through all the corruption through all
[38:22] the ridicules and the
[38:25] criticism yet
[38:26] god has a people that will manifest him
[38:32] then we declare to the world that jesus
[38:36] of the bible is jesus right now
[38:44] but only through the life is is live
[38:47] correctly
[38:50] that's why it's so important for us to
[38:53] get the holy ghost
[38:56] you may be going to church and you may
[38:59] be doing all the good acts
[39:02] that christian does
[39:05] but if that life amen
[39:08] is not being manifested
[39:11] and people know
[39:23] they knew that when those people in the
[39:26] book of acts have got a hold of
[39:29] something
[39:30] they wasn't the same people amen
[39:33] amen
[39:37] they saw jesus again
[39:41] yet
[39:42] he died but he rose
[39:46] not only he rise again but he sent back
[39:50] the same
[39:52] not another jesus not another life but
[39:56] it was the same
[39:58] manifestation of god again
[40:02] that peter that was a coward and used to
[40:05] curse and did this and that now peter
[40:11] stood boldly
[40:14] begin to tell those people you men of
[40:17] israel
[40:20] and this same jesus
[40:23] see
[40:24] and the bible declared that 13 and 8
[40:27] hebrews
[40:29] jesus christ is
[40:32] when if he is the same where is he
[40:40] where is he at that's what the world
[40:43] wants to see amen amen
[40:46] we talk about him
[40:48] and we can quote things and and we can
[40:52] talk about things but
[40:54] can we actually bring god down
[40:58] amen
[41:00] because i heard
[41:01] the testimony
[41:03] that's what the people need
[41:07] we've had churches
[41:09] we've signed on the name of the book yet
[41:12] we still aren't saved
[41:17] this salvation that i'm talking about
[41:20] it's not a weak salvation
[41:23] but it is the power of god
[41:28] living in us
[41:32] to bring forth the very manifestation of
[41:36] god for this generation
[41:42] that's why we declare that we're not
[41:44] just talking about a historical events
[41:48] that what god used to do and how how he
[41:51] used peter and mary and a different one
[41:54] now god want to use you and i
[42:00] servant of god says some people the only
[42:03] jesus they'll see is through you
[42:07] and not for your talking i'm not talking
[42:09] about your talk
[42:11] but they're watching you
[42:15] they're watching you they hear you
[42:17] talking but they say now where's the
[42:19] goods
[42:22] y'all talk that y'all have a reveal word
[42:25] and god is doing the same thing but
[42:28] let's see it
[42:31] now i'm not talking about a show
[42:35] because you and i understand that this
[42:38] world is spiritually sick
[42:43] the church world
[42:45] is spiritually sick amen
[42:49] they can't produce
[42:52] the manifestation of god
[42:55] so they give the people traditions and
[42:58] entertainment amen but that won't
[43:01] satisfy a true seed of god they will god
[43:06] amen go ahead amen
[43:10] and i'll declare you
[43:12] there's only one way you're going to get
[43:14] it
[43:17] and it's not by singing
[43:20] you don't come by shouting and
[43:23] preaching those things it comes when we
[43:26] can get down on our knees and cry out
[43:32] that's what the early church did
[43:37] they came together to pray
[43:41] and when they did
[43:42] it shook the whole city
[43:47] they were turning the city upside down
[43:54] because they understood that the only
[43:57] way we're going to manifest god we got
[44:00] to get in contact with him
[44:05] how do we get in contact with god
[44:09] how do we see the very word of god
[44:12] through us
[44:15] how can i live such a life
[44:18] and i don't have the person
[44:23] then you got to go back
[44:28] sometime i heard the servant of god say
[44:30] what we need in this hour he said we
[44:33] need to get back to that all night
[44:35] prayer meeting
[44:40] but we the left
[44:44] our sermons become more important than
[44:47] prayer meetings
[44:50] we are so
[44:52] uh you're concerned we ought to be
[44:54] somewhat
[44:56] but the servant of god said there's
[44:58] nothing more powerful
[45:02] than prayer life
[45:08] what bring
[45:09] this salvation i'm talking about
[45:15] i won't go to another scripture
[45:21] second peter
[45:32] second peter one
[45:47] 5-10
[45:51] besides this
[45:54] giving our diligence add to your faith
[45:57] virtue
[45:59] into virtual knowledge
[46:01] into knowledge temperance
[46:04] and to tempers patience and to patience
[46:07] godliness
[46:09] and to godliness brotherly kindness
[46:12] to brotherly kindness charity
[46:15] for if these things be in you
[46:20] and abound mean they stay there
[46:23] they make you that ye neither shall be
[46:26] barren
[46:27] nor unfruitful
[46:29] in the knowledge of our lord jesus
[46:32] christ
[46:33] but he that locket these things is blind
[46:37] and cannot see a falloff
[46:39] and forgotten that he was purged from
[46:42] his old sin
[46:44] wherefore the rather brethren
[46:47] give our dealers
[46:49] to make your calling and your election
[46:53] sure
[46:54] but if you do these things
[46:57] you should never fall
[46:59] see
[47:02] making your calling
[47:06] working out your salvation
[47:11] i tell people all the time there we have
[47:14] no time to look around
[47:18] and to be wondering what i ought to do
[47:23] we've got to understand lord
[47:26] let me examine myself
[47:31] it's good to be concerned about others
[47:35] but that come to terms you got to get a
[47:37] checkup lord check me out
[47:43] examine me lord search my heart
[47:47] do i have the goods
[47:50] do i have oil
[47:53] i think no this is the hour you got to
[47:56] be certain of god
[48:00] and when you suck your life and you see
[48:04] unlikely it's time to get to the altar
[48:07] amen
[48:12] but why are we waiting on somebody to
[48:14] tell us
[48:17] remember
[48:18] you responsible for your own soul
[48:22] nobody else can feed that but you
[48:28] so the god said your soul is worth more
[48:30] than 10 000 worlds
[48:33] but how do you treat it
[48:37] what are you feeding it
[48:42] is it the right food
[48:47] we feed the natural body but our
[48:50] spiritual body says i'm hungry
[48:55] i'm thirsting for god
[49:02] they say i want to see the power of god
[49:06] in a sanctuary again amen
[49:09] but more so than that i want to see him
[49:11] in my tabernacle
[49:17] too many times and you hear people all
[49:19] the time and say that they'd like to
[49:21] tell you oh how god is in our church
[49:26] but i wonder is it is he in us
[49:31] because if he's there
[49:33] you'll be fruitful
[49:36] but if he's not there you'll be barren
[49:41] see every tree gonna bring forth
[49:44] of the kind that it is
[49:47] if it's the right seed in the right
[49:50] ground it got to produce the right fruit
[49:56] and in good form of you planting corn
[49:58] you don't want to say cabbage
[50:01] you expect to see corn
[50:04] and when god planned to see the word and
[50:07] he expect to see the very manifestation
[50:10] of what the word came to do
[50:17] if there's ever has been a season in a
[50:22] time
[50:24] that we need to work out our own
[50:30] lord
[50:33] let me examine
[50:36] where i'm at
[50:39] you know
[50:40] i think you take inventory
[50:42] of things you know i
[50:44] you know and i just had a birthday last
[50:46] month
[50:47] and i said lord here i am now 59.
[50:52] when i first came to mueller i was 27
[50:55] years old
[50:58] and i said lord
[51:00] help me
[51:04] not to just sit around
[51:08] and complain and
[51:10] look at other but lord help me to look
[51:12] at myself
[51:16] because it's nobody's fault
[51:20] it's nobody fought by mine
[51:23] if i don't get a hold of god
[51:26] a lot of times we always seem people
[51:30] always have a complaint that is always
[51:33] the pastor
[51:35] he is the one
[51:38] why i ain't growing
[51:40] no the son of god said
[51:42] nobody can stop you but you
[51:47] because even one person
[51:51] died for you
[51:53] one person that gave you your salvation
[51:57] and that's jesus christ
[52:01] every one of us see now is trying to
[52:03] work out our own salvation and saying
[52:06] lord what do i need to do
[52:10] what do i need to do lord but you got to
[52:13] be willing
[52:15] and honestly lord
[52:17] here i am help me
[52:21] help me to get out of the lazy zone lord
[52:26] stir up
[52:28] stir up in me lord
[52:31] yeah lord i know there's people that
[52:33] need help but lord i can't help nobody
[52:36] until i get some help
[52:44] a lot of times people try to help others
[52:45] and they need help themselves
[52:49] see first you get help i get help
[52:52] and then when we get help then we have
[52:55] something to give out
[52:56] you remember that man was that that
[52:58] temple the beautiful
[53:00] and peter we used to go out in that
[53:02] an hour to prayer
[53:04] he just now been there
[53:07] but he been there all the time but
[53:10] that day something happened to peter
[53:13] them
[53:14] that man was sitting there begging for
[53:16] all that
[53:17] peter them
[53:19] something must have struck them
[53:23] inspiration struck pity them and people
[53:26] say
[53:27] look on us
[53:29] but you notice where they were going
[53:31] prayer service
[53:37] you see what prayer is able to
[53:40] do somebody might come through our doors
[53:46] desperate
[53:47] broken
[53:48] in bondage
[53:51] that's why the prayer or the righteous
[53:55] or there is much
[54:01] if we are that church
[54:04] that god is looking for
[54:08] are we gonna just be like everybody else
[54:12] tell them people man i said let me tell
[54:14] you i said i just didn't come just to
[54:17] put a name on a piece or a bulletin
[54:19] board
[54:20] no no no that's not what what i even
[54:23] came for
[54:26] but i come for one thing one purpose the
[54:28] lord there are souls
[54:31] there's a lost soul somewhere in the
[54:34] city
[54:38] but the burden for lost souls done left
[54:40] us
[54:42] all we care about is us
[54:46] you know what that song says all about
[54:47] us
[54:49] no you all be willing to make a
[54:51] sacrifice
[54:54] and to do something for somebody else
[54:58] to be able to lay yourself aside and say
[55:01] look you know god wouldn't save you
[55:06] i know god that can deliver you
[55:09] let your testimony
[55:12] be a living reality your very life that
[55:16] you live
[55:17] before them
[55:21] more than anything it's not the good
[55:23] sermon that we preach but it's the life
[55:25] that we live before them
[55:29] when everybody now is saying dear
[55:31] christian
[55:33] what's the difference between you and
[55:35] them
[55:37] see that life gives off a certain radius
[55:42] if it's a real life i believe in one
[55:44] place in the bible it said
[55:46] peter those shadow
[55:50] healed the people
[55:53] they were so under the inspiration the
[55:55] note of god
[55:57] just their presence
[55:59] healed folks
[56:03] without saying anything i laid in a hand
[56:06] it was just their presence because it
[56:09] was jesus
[56:12] that life didn't live it wasn't theirs
[56:17] in the life that you and i live in
[56:19] tonight it ought not just to be for you
[56:22] but to be lord help me to be a light
[56:24] wherever i go
[56:30] me to be that example help me to be that
[56:32] one lord that i'm willing to fast or
[56:35] pray or whatever it takes god to get in
[56:38] my uh little secret closet somewhere and
[56:41] call on you lord
[56:45] servant god said what happened a lot of
[56:47] time is said we don't stay long enough
[56:49] for god to do it
[56:52] when we feel a thrill or we feel a chill
[56:55] but no no god wants you to stay right
[56:57] there until something happened
[57:00] and when it happened in you
[57:02] you don't have to tell nobody in a show
[57:07] it'll show that something about you that
[57:11] differently you know
[57:13] uh what's up tell me to say that you
[57:15] know that they went to work and um and
[57:18] uh this one young girl wanted somebody
[57:20] to pray for him and and um they greeted
[57:24] us how about me i'm a christian dude she
[57:26] said girl you got some issues
[57:31] but they saw something in somebody that
[57:35] seemed real
[57:38] and that's why your very conversations
[57:41] that that you talking
[57:43] right across that little cubicle
[57:44] wherever you at people are listening
[57:49] they watch you come in
[57:51] and they might not even say much to you
[57:53] at all
[57:55] but they'll watch it
[57:57] and when they really
[58:00] need prayer to go up guess who they come
[58:03] and do
[58:05] they say on my job i know
[58:08] this sister
[58:10] you know
[58:11] that she ain't like everybody else that
[58:14] called they called themself chris but
[58:16] she really lives
[58:18] what she's talking about
[58:20] and that's what we want to do
[58:23] we want to live what we're talking about
[58:28] let our life speak for us
[58:32] and god will testify
[58:34] who you are
[58:37] tonight
[58:38] work out your own salvation
[58:40] with fear
[58:42] and we're trembling
[58:44] god bless you
[58:55] praise god we appreciate
[58:58] appreciate the word tonight amen
[59:01] work out your own salvation
[59:03] our salvation is near and we're when we
[59:06] first believe
[59:07] we thank god that we it's at the
[59:10] funeral today and listen to the jib
[59:12] witness
[59:13] fella and
[59:16] you know
[59:18] and i was so glad that brother perry got
[59:20] up and said a little something
[59:22] after the dismissal of the service
[59:26] so
[59:28] and um
[59:30] i
[59:30] you know you can't work your way to
[59:32] heaven
[59:34] it's not about works at least any man
[59:35] should boast
[59:37] it's the gift of god
[59:39] the salvation that god has given us is
[59:41] precious
[59:43] what god has given you and i is precious
[59:46] and i'm saying it's so good to know
[59:48] better
[59:50] it's so good that your eyes
[59:53] of your understanding has been
[59:54] enlightened that you can see
[59:58] and see what the devil is out there he's
[1:00:01] blinding folks from the truth
[1:00:05] but by the grace of god
[1:00:09] the truth that god has given us we ought
[1:00:11] to cherish it
[1:00:13] and thank him every day
[1:00:16] that god is opening our eyes
[1:00:19] because people are hurt not now
[1:00:23] people think they're right
[1:00:25] and think they're doing the right thing
[1:00:28] working hard
[1:00:30] to try to get to heaven
[1:00:32] not knowing that price has already been
[1:00:34] paid
[1:00:36] praise god
[1:00:38] our work
[1:00:40] is not us working it's him that worketh
[1:00:42] in us
[1:00:44] amen
[1:00:45] both do we all and they do his good
[1:00:46] pleasure
[1:00:48] it's what god is doing in us
[1:00:50] that's why we're working on our own
[1:00:52] salvation
[1:00:53] why because we got somebody that working
[1:00:55] in us
[1:00:57] praise god it's the spirit of god
[1:00:58] working through you
[1:01:00] that's what you're working out your own
[1:01:02] salvation
[1:01:04] the holy ghost seeing you doing the work
[1:01:07] jesus said it's not me that working but
[1:01:09] my father that's in me he does the word
