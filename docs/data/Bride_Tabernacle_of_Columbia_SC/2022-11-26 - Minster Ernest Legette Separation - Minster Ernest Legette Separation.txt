just now Lord as we look to you Lord for all things in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God is good amen we want to look at the book of second Corinthians 6. by God's grace second Corinthians 6. we'll begin at the 11th first second Corinthians 6 and 11. you got to say Amen and it reads oh ye Corinthians our mouth is open unto you our heart is enlarged ye are not straightener in us but ye are straightening your own bowels now for a record pence in the same I speak as unto my children be also enlarged be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship have righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion have light with darkness and what Concord have Christ with Belial or what part have he that believeth with infinite within infidel and what agreement have the temple of God with Idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God has said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you and I will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the Lord God saith the Lord Almighty may God have bless the reading of his word maybe see you tonight tonight by God's grace just for a moment I want to minister on a little topic and I entitle this separation amen separation you know a lot of times you know like he says here to be separate you know saith the Lord we know what Paul was dealing with here and he's dealing with the Corinthian Church and how in that time you know that when he came to bring the gospel to them they were you know in a bad place and conditioned within their lives and everything so but he come to share with them the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God but he was wanted to break it down to them to explain to them in order to receive the full benefits or the or the blessings of God you got to come out from among them saying that come out from among them in in type coming out from you know the world and in the ways of the world so we know that and we talk about separation you know it's in a twofold part you know you know in separation from whatever is contrary to the word of God and also not only separation or whatever is contrary from to the word of God but separation from the desire and the motive to do that which is contrary uh to the word of God so we find that you know God a lot of times you know God is all-powerful you know we find ourselves many times in situations to where we need Deliverance and you know God is a god of Deliverance he is a God that can deliver you from any circumstance in any situation trial there's nothing that you face with tonight that God can't deliver you from but a lot of times what it is for God to give you a total Deliverance he's called he calls out for a total separation sometimes we find ourselves like we says in places in our lives and we want God to deliver us just for the moment because of the pain that we're in come on but God wants to do more for you then just for the moment God wants to give you an everlasting Deliverance he wants to give you something uh that that will totally like we said deliver you from now on all times and but we we find that you know many times I was thinking about a certain situation you know and and some years ago I I knew of a of a female and she was in a real bad relationship and the man was real abusive to her beating her up real bad putting her in the hospital and all kind of things but you know it's something how you know even after she get out the hospital one particular time he went and picked her up from the hospital and brought her home with him you know you know and a lot of times you know she'd call and people would go over there and police would show up or other people would go over there to bail her out certain situations but she would turn right back around and go right back into that same um situation so you say sometimes why would you do that why would you continue to go into a situation uh uh continue to go into a bad situation when you had multiple chances to get out but a lot of times you'll find that person they might say because I love him oh because I love her and that's why they keep going back to that situation but the thing is and that's how it is even with sin the same way God can come down and deliver you God can come down and and do something in your life but if you love that you're gonna go right back to it right so what it is we got to find uh I I said I used to pray all the time when the Lord first saved me I said Lord I said Lord I need you to help me because I'm afraid of myself I don't know what I'm capable of and even though God might have did something for you to turn a new lead for did something for you to uh put you on another page I was always in my heart was hungering and thirsting I said God I need more I need something God I need you to do something in my life that when I get up off my knees I know that it's over with I'm not afraid of of situations I'm not afraid of The Temptations and trial because I've got victory over that now come on and that's what I always had to pray that God would give me victory over myself over my own desires my own flesh my own will because you know you think about even Paul how he says when I desire to do good evil is present with me he talked about a war going on he says that you know I want to do right but you know I'm battling he's talking about you know the the battle that he was going through in his in his flesh but he says oh who can deliver me from the body of this death come on he needed Deliverance just as you and I tonight just as Paul needed Deliverance you and I tonight need Deliverance not just from service to service but something you know God wants to like he says come out he said I want you to be uh be separate saith the Lord that he says that come on you'll be my children I'll be your guard come on in other words I'll fight all your battles come on I'll be your Victor I'll be you know your leader and your God come on there's no there's no uh other person or no other one I know that never lost a battle in all the battles that he ever fought but God himself somebody can say you know I'm undefeated you know yes but sooner or later your defeat coming but it's only one that can remain undefeated and that's God himself y'all believe that tonight you know I I'm a wit I'm a living witness that it's never been a situation that I didn't put before God or give to God he might have didn't answer right away or it might have didn't even look like he came uh uh at that particular time but just I just been patient and let God have his way come on and God worked it out it might have didn't come the solution ain't come as as what I thought it might have came but it came the way God ordained for it to come and when it and when he finished it come on it was better than what I ever thought or dreamed all I had to do was wait on God come on how many believe that tonight but I said that that's what it is separation you know God for a total the uh Deliverance God is calling I believe that for a total separation a lot of times like it says God brings us out he does things in our lives but we got a lot of baggage that we bring with us come on we got a lot of things that we try to bring over that we say hey well I can bring these things over and maybe God will use them you know when God calls you he don't need nothing you got all he wants you to do is be obedient and say Lord thank you praise him along the way because God he knows what he wants out of your life and he knows how to get you where he wants you at to get it out your life you know God had turned everything around you upside down to get you into a place it's a way you can hear his voice get you to a place to where everything else surrounds you come on it's silent and then all you got the only influence in your life then is his is his Voice come on I said that tonight I thank God for doing that you know looking at your life and where you was headed but all in a moment God turn your life upside down come on everything you look like you put your hand to it goes south or or it doesn't work out but what it was you say why is all these things happening to me maybe God is trying to get your attention maybe God is trying to get you to settle down come on to a way you can yield to the voice say Lord I don't know where you're leading me God but here I am I'm here I want to hear your voice and God whatever you have for my life that's what I want to do come on but God and what it is he's calling you out separation how many believe that tonight let's look at one scripture Luke 14 by God's grace don't want to be long tonight but I said a separation come on God is calling for a total separation like I said not only uh just a separation we're looking at from the physical but even your motives and your desires you know God can physically deliver you but yet your spirit is still messed up your spirit is still uh in bondage locked down you know a lot of times people can be sitting in church but their heart ain't in it come on they desire ain't in it but their desire is still to be out in their streets or be out wherever doing you know whatever you know I was sharing my nephews yesterday we were all talking sitting down talking I was telling them I said you know I was sharing with them some testimonies of of when I was their age a little younger and the things we got involved in and and all of the hype that was around the family name and and all the popularity and all these things but then I started sharing with them after all I telling them about all that and you know the money that I saw even as a teenager from the from the boys selling drugs and all that but then I began to share with them it wasn't long for this one died this one got killed this one went to jail this one doing life this one and I said now you look at all of that I say you look at all of that and what seemed to be uh uh good or what seemed to be hip and all those things I said but what does it mean now so you look at all of that look at the end Story come on I said now what it is it's a whole nother group out there that don't even know you never even heard of you I says but what it is I said all of that you look at all that sometimes and you say what what does it mean what was it worth what does it even matter now come on doesn't even matter but I want to say you doing all of that all of that was done for the devil you know when the devil get done with you he done with you he don't care about you he gonna find somebody else to use but it's something about God with the things you do for God those are the things that'll last what you do for God God ain't gonna forget it come on I don't care how old you get God ain't gonna say I got a new group now I don't need you come on but God will never forget the things that you've done God will never forget the hours you spent in prayer come on your faithfulness your sacrifices God will never forget that come on but he'll reward you Hallelujah come on not only in this life but in the life to come he'll give you everlasting life eternal life y'all believe that come on and that's why I live in for God ain't in vain come on you're living for God is is worth it I said Lord all of the trials that I've been through all the separation all of the pick that all the hardship God it was worth it come on it was worth every tear it was worth every hour it was worth all this all of the being ridiculed God it was worth it I know it was worth it Hallelujah and it's still worth it now because God just just as real as he was at the beginning of the journey he's even more real now I thought I needed him at the beginning of the journey which I did but I need him even more right now come on I need him every day of my life that I get up I need God I need him to keep my mind you know those old Saints say Lord keep my mind I need them to keep my mind you know why because we living in a world that's neurotic going insane I was sharing the other night I said you don't know what the next man beside just thinking you don't know what the man in the grocery store is thinking you don't know what the people at the job are thinking in their minds somebody going through something at home and they just want to go out there and end it all you know my nephews is telling me how somebody just is open up fire in the Walmart on all employees just just doing I'll say that's the world that we're living in come on people are losing their minds having mental breakdowns and still walking around they don't know it so what what do we need we need God to keep our minds we need God to keep us stable I said Lord keep me stable keep my mind right God come on Evil all around you but Lord keep my mind right you know hate all around you but keep my mind right you know things come uh situations come to test and to try you come down there but it's so quick for you to get in your flesh come on and then God can't help you because you and yourself but that's why we say Lord even in those times help me when I don't know what to do that I won't be in the flesh but God I'll remain in the spirit God that I won't be caught unaware but when those things those trials and tribulations come Lord you'll take over how did you make it through it brother Ernest it was God that done it you think about these recent trials that we've been through oh you're so strong no it was God that done it it was God that kept me it was God that kept me faithful kept me strong kept me believing come on I like how Paul he says I fought a good fight come on I finished my course didn't it but I like that part at the end where you say I kept the faith come on you can fight a good fight run the race and all that even finish the race but did you keep the faith come on through hardships did you keep the faith through your trials did you keep the faith when everybody talked about you did you keep the faith when your family turned your back on you did you keep the faith come on when the church members wouldn't help you did you keep the faith come on I fought a good fight I finished the course I kept the faith not that I kept it but the faith kept me it was God Hallelujah the whole time it is God now y'all believe that Hallelujah you know in your Christian Journey you ought to get stronger every day come on I believe it was Caleb says that it was so many years ago when when Moses promised me and God because I was faithful he gave me this mountain he says but I'm just as strong today as I was back then come on I might be older I'm 85 now I believe it was he says and that was 45 years ago however long it was that God gave me the promise of the mountain come on he said and I ain't got it yet somebody says well you lived a good life just going to be with with the Lord but Caleb hey he still wanted what God promised him he wasn't going to stop till he got what God promised him like he said don't talk to me about how old I am yes that was so many years ago been through trials been through tribulations but I still ain't got the promise of God yet he promised it to me and I want it Hallelujah and that's what it is sometimes the devil wants you to be satisfied with just this or that no you don't be satisfied but with God promised you whatever God promises you you don't rest until you get it come on God promised you your home you don't rest until you get your home come on you don't be satisfied come on until you got all that God has promised you Hallelujah Lord I want my cup to run over oh Jesus do you want your cup to run over tonight come on you know we living in that hour now and I believe it where you you're going to really have to uh gain a strong hand of faith come on Faith's gonna have to be something you know it's the evidence of Things Not Seen The Hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen come on it's the evidence right come on faith brings the impossible possible come on faith is something that the world don't know about that the carnal the real mind came came reckoned with that faith is hallelujah when you don't know where it's coming from but you believe it's coming anyhow because God said it would be Hallelujah that I've never seen a righteous forsaken nor exceed begging for bread and my faith is going to bring it Hallelujah come on you look at your money how much is your money gonna be worth nothing right was talking about Charlotte the other day went in the grocery store and I was telling him to bring a jug of Grease home the one that usually 9.99 what is what 17.99 now something like that I said Lord have mercy food gas everything come on and your money is still just what it ain't moving along with it is it it's depletion ain't it so what are you going to do you're gonna have to have faith in God right that he'll supply all of your needs according to his riches and Glory that God will stretching I believe that you know God allowed those things and and had those things written and a lot of things to even happen in our life so we can see Hallelujah that when the world is in this depression state or whatever inflation or whatever you want to call it come on get your cruise of all ain't gonna run dry because you got to still put God first now come on don't think that hey we're running low so now I got to put this money here and that no you continue to put God first and watch what God do in your life I believe that what's all in my heart you got to put God first and let them be God in your life Hallelujah I think about that when they say Lord we ain't got enough to feed the people he said but what do you got come on two fish and Five Loaves Five Loaves that's enough come on just put it in the Master's Hand come on he gonna take care of it ain't it Hallelujah I believe it God is so good come on but like it says total separation well I mean God is calling for separation because he wants to bless you he ain't just saying come out and he ain't got nothing for you he's wanting you to come out because he got he want to bless you but he can't bless you come on in the midst of and and and we know we got to live in this world so it's not that you know you're saying how we gonna not have contact with the world but it's the compromise come on it's the compromising not just the compromise and but it's it's the the can't think of the word but you know engaging of it come on he says I want you to come out so I can bless you you know he told Abraham he said I want you to get me out of that country from amongst our Kindred and all these things he said in the blessing I'll bless you didn't you he could have blessed him right where he's at but he said I want us I want you to separate yourself so I can bless you come on sometimes we think being alone is is something bad but it ain't always bad God want to bless you come on Hallelujah I believe that uh Luke 14 by the grace of God Luke 14 and we'll begin at the 25th verse separation you got to say man Luke 14 and 25 and it reads and there went great multitudes with him and he turned and said unto them if any man come to me and hate not his father and his mother and mother and wife and children and brother and sisters yay and his own life also he cannot be my disciple and whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple for which of you intended to build a Tarot siteth not down first and counted the cost whether he has sufficient enough to finish it he lives happily after he had laid the foundation is not able to finish it and behold it began be and and all that behold it began to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish come on I said separation you know I was I was meditating on this the other day I said Jesus making a statement he says accept you hate your father and your mother children you gotta he said hate them except you hate him you won't be able to be my disciple I said now that scene hard don't it well he's not necessarily talking about natural hates I gotta hate my mom I hate my daddy not natural like that but the thing is he want to show you a contrast that when you coming out to God you can't have nothing before him you can't love nothing more than you love God come on if you love your mama more than you love God come on then you can't be his disciple if you love your daddy more than you love you can't be a disciple why because that thing will come between you and God he wants to get you and I to the place where nothing don't come in between come on to where you sold out to God and that's what it is your your uh individual journey is between you and God Alone come on not you in the church not you and uh the family of Mom and Daddy some people think they'll make it because Mom and Daddy saved no that's between you and God Alone come on God died for you you as an individual got to make it down that old path to that Old Rugged Cross you as an individual got to learn how to get down on your knees and cry out to the Savior come on because he died just for you that little song say he did it for me come on same way Grandma I got it you got to get it same way uh daddy or mama got it you got to get it come on he's that same God waiting on you Hallelujah come on to make your way down that Lonely Road of where repentance that Lonely Road Hallelujah he'll meet you there when you can't walk no more God I beat you there come on when you can't crawl no more God will meet you there come on just because you tried God will meet you there down that lonely road to let you know hey I'm your savior come on I called y'all you heard my voice now I'm here to pick you up take you on the way hallelujah oh Jesus come on he said so so you know unless you hate him come on God God God don't want nothing in between you and him nothing you know the boys at work told me once and I shared a testimony quite often they said one of the boys he said you know I don't respect a man that put the church before he put his family I told him I don't respect that man neither but God is a different story come on it's a difference between the church and God come on a lot of times you do stuff for the church or the church didn't die for you the church can't save you come on but it was Jesus Christ and his blood that was shed on Calvary come on so it's a difference I said that and then he began to say well I don't got no respect for you like that I said you want to know why I can put God first I said because God is the only reason why I got all these things God is the only reason why I got a family God is the only reason I got children I got I got life come on that I'm here today God is the only reason come on all the blessings that I have everything that I have is only because of God so what can I put before him he is the one that blessed me with all these things he give him he can take them away so I thank God for him I said that you know what I says while we at work tonight I said who do you think watching over my family God who you think keeping them that the thieves can't break through and steal God come on I said I said he didn't have he don't have to do it but he doing it he don't have to keep him but he keeping them come on I said so why not put him first he is the beginning come on he's the foundation he's everything you can have the house but he's the foundation of the house Hallelujah and if you don't have the right foundation anywhere it'll blow you down any trial any storm will knock you out but when the foundation is right come on when you started out right Hallelujah the wind might blow but the foundation is still there we can still build Hallelujah oh Jesus come on you rooted right come on the roots are there come on the tree looked like it died but it's still life in the roots don't you thank God for that come on you know it's trials in life that beat you all up come on it's things in life that tear you all up come on you don't even really think oh Lord this this is too hard to Bear but he said he won't put no more on you that you can't bear right so even when you thinking that you already gaining strength because you done gave up Hallelujah come on your strength is gone now he done took over Hallelujah give you different eyes to see to look at the situation a little bit different come on I don't know how I'm gonna make it but how did I make it through last night I made it somehow Hallelujah they sing that song somehow I made it oh Jesus somehow come on but it was God the whole time wasn't it oh Jesus come on separation but God like it says he calling he calls us out he won't separate it but he don't want nothing he don't want nothing in between you and him many of times we say Lord why haven't I received come on why haven't I oh oh got the full benefits Lord why come on but then you got to search yourself you got to search your relationship your life I remember Samuel coming up to Saul and Saul said blessed is him that coming he said I did all the Lord asked me Samuel told him what's this bleeding in my ears come on you didn't do it all you kept that what survived what violent refuse even the king brought it back come on thought that maybe hey I could do this but you didn't do all that God asked you come on sometimes we got to search ourselves Lord did I do all that you asked me come on not that you just want the blessings because you greedy but you need the blessings you need God to do something for you you need God to watch out for you need God to open that door for you come on you need God to make that way of Escape for you and God want to do it come on but he don't want nothing in between he calls you like we said he wants to give you a total Deliverance right but he calls for a total separation as well think about it I said remember it's a twofold not on just from the from the uh mind and all those other things but you realize you know I was thinking about those children of Israel I ain't want to be long tonight I was thinking about those children of Israel they was there at the Red Sea even Moses told them he says that you know the Egyptians that afflict you all these years after the day you ain't gonna see them no more come on cause I'm a strong he said the Lord gonna fight for you they with their own eyes watch the Egyptians drown in the sea didn't they so they were delivered you say for even in from the physical in a physical part but they were still spiritually bound wasn't it come on they still had things in their heart that they hadn't let go yet they left Egypt like they say physically but spiritually their hearts were still there so even though yes they looked like they were delivered they still hadn't totally separated come on because something in their hearts were still there so they kept going around and round and round until God got to the party he says all right none of your cross over ten times have you murmured you tried me and I proved to you I just want to show you that I want to bless you that I want to do for you more than you can do for yourself I want to show you I want to be your guard I want you to be my people but I want you to separate yourself you know the church world has forgotten that today come on they forgotten that that God's people should be separate than the world God's people he said you're peculiar people you should be different the church where I forgot that today but what it is a lack of the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost when he comes in come on he'll never let you forget that because it's him in you living the word manifesting his life through you do y'all believe that tonight amen [Applause] praise God Amen you appreciate the word tonight said you cannot serve two masters your loved one and you hate the other You Gotta Serve God if you're serving God Amen the devil don't mind if you serve two masters but God does Amen because he knows you can't do it so so he just smiling and laughing at the folks that's trying to serve God in you can't serve God and be a part of the world system so we thank God for the word tonight God's word calls for total separation from all unbelief if we're not going to be separate from the world then the Bible said If any man love the world to love the father is not in him so it's if we love God we love him with all our hearts he said if we love him he'll keep his Commandments amen praise God it's something that we want to do it's not something we're trying to do it's something that we enjoy doing amen but you can't get the joy of it except God be down inside of you amen except you have the spirit of the love of God down inside you praise God we love him because he first loved us praise God he cared about us amen praise God because he cares amen because he's shown his love towards us amen he showed us how much he cared about us by because he died for us amen so because of that amen people struggle to try to live for God still could struggle to try to live right amen they battle why because they don't allow the love of God to come in their hearts praise God once the it allow Jesus to come in that means a strong man amen that over Fletchling desire amen praise God the stronger one is Jesus Christ the love is stronger than death amen so if you allow Jesus to come in there's no struggle we're trying to do right and live right why because of the love that's in your heart praise God if you've got the struggle to love your husband to love your wife praise God then there's something wrong there amen you should not have any trouble with loving your children loving your family amen there shouldn't be a struggle there why praise God this is well I I I'm trying no no no no no it's something inside of you amen that causes you and that person to come together amen and then I don't that's a love amen how can you explain it can you explain it amen but one thing about our action shows that we care amen and how you treat God your
