how many love the Lord tonight how many love the Lord tonight come on that that's a beautiful name to say it's the sweetest name that can come off of our tongue and off our lips the name of Jesus Christ uh because that name includes so many things if you need a Healer Jesus Christ is your healer uh if you need a savior you have to recognize that you lost you need saving uh guess what Jesus Christ could be your savior um in a time where people's minds are scattered and they don't seem like they're on a firm foundation what I found is that the name of Jesus Christ is a very firm foundation for his people uh so Buddha can't do that for you uh confucious can't do that for you but it's something about the name of Jesus Christ and the whole reason we come out tonight is because we are believers in the name of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah we never lose focus of that how many love the Lord tonight oh God how many love the Lord tonight amen how many glad to be in the house of

tonight we might sing a little piece of this song and then we'll jump right into the word uh the enemy one of his tactics is to try to make you think that your God cannot overcome any challenge amen

to press the bell in this hour Hallelujah if you can just stand with me tonight amen we're going to look in the Book of Psalms the 37th Psalm I do want to read three portions of the scripture tonight by God's grace hallelujah amen amen Psalms 37 uh then we're going to look at the book of Romans then I want to draw my emphasis in the book of Acts tonight amen amen how many glad to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen praise God Amen Hallelujah that sister clapped her hands amen what you done batt all we lost it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen there's a lot of people that are a lot of places tonight amen amen but there's no place I rather be amen Lord the 37th Psalm and the 23rd verse amen then we'll look at Romans 8:28 amen Psalms 37 and 23 me the whole thing is good but I don't want to get too far ahead of myself and carry it away but what it's talking about is your position in Christ amen amen and it reads it says the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord amen not by man but by the Lord amen and guess what the Lord does with that and he delighteth in his way Romans 8:28 if we can read that together it's maybe one of the most powerful scriptures amen that Paul put together on a long list of powerful scriptures Romans 8:28 and I know you know it by heart amen but nevertheless we'll read it tonight and it says and we know amen oh let's just read that together and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose amen how many in here love God tonight amen praise God if you love God that means that part of your testimony is going to be that all things work together amen amen acts 27 amen and then we'll let you have your seats amen acts 27 and8 amen back home we was dealing with a A series at the beginning of the year on the book of Acts and just to show that the same God that operated in that church amen in the book of Acts amen by the power of the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ was Gone In the Flesh they wonder what they were going to do but God never leaves his people without an answer so he answered by the Holy Ghost and it was a lot of things that they had overcome and it goes into the story of Paul and Paul has his ups and downs but eventually Paul has a great trial where he has to go before Caesar because the Jews hated him and they had him arrested and in the midst of him going from Jerusalem all the way to Rome Italy he boards a ship and the ship runs into some trouble along the way man how many know that we're on a journey and sometimes on this journey we run into some trouble along the way I I want to deal with a little portion of of what Paul had to go through and maybe you could see some tipes within your own life tonight amen acts 27:18 amen what happened they ran up a storm and it was a very terrible storm and it says and we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest the next day they lighten the ship they started throwing stuff overboard cuz the storm was so bad and in the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship and when neither Sun not stars in many days appeared now this ain't no regular storm now they couldn't even see the sun of the storms but it said and many days appear and no small Tempest lay on us all hope that we should be saved was then taken away how many know the devil wants to take away your hope amen 21st verse and it says but after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them and said sir you should have hearkened unto me and should not have loose from CRE and to have gained this harm and lost Paul told him not to make that journey in the first place but it did it anyway but yeah some good news for them and now I exort you to be of good sheer for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you but of the ship for there stood by me this night the angel of God whose I am and whom I serve saying fear not Paul yes I'm going tell y'all tonight bride Tabernacle fear not amen thou must be brought before Cesar and lo God has given thee all them that s with thee wherefor s be of good cheer for I believe God how many believe God tonight that it shall be even as it was told me let's just skip down to the 42nd verse you can see what the summation of the story was amen hallelujah the Shipwrecked amen and the soldiers because there was some prisoners on board they wanted to kill those uh those prisoners in 42nd verse the reason the soldiers count was to kill the prisoners lest any of them should swim out and Escape but the Centurion willing to save Paul kept them from their purpose and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea and get to land and the rest some on boards and some on broken pieces of the ship and so it came to pass that they escaped all safe to land I was looking at the means of Escape that some was able to swim some was able to make it out on nice pretty boards but it was some that just had to hold on to some broken pieces of the ship and nevertheless if God ordained that way for them he was going to guarantee that they were going to be safe uh my title for tonight just for a few minutes of your time is going to be ordained broken pieces ordain broken pieces let's just bow our heads heavenly father in the name of Jesus Christ Lord is a wonderful experience Lord an honor Lord to gather before your people dear God and Lord you know that when we come together Lord we're not coming together on our own Lord but it is your spirit within us dear God so Lord I pray that you would speak to your people tonight Lord Lord you know what the people have need of Father God and Lord I pray that you would meet those needs tonight Lord Lord I desire and our expectation is that we will always leave this place different than how we came in and we know that through the power of your Holy Spirit Lord we will always leave this place different than how we came in we thank you Lord we thank you for each and every believer that's here the different ones that's listening Lord by the means of the internet Lord bless them all exceedingly and abundantly we thank you in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ May the Saints say Amen tonight hallelujah praise God you can be seated tonight you know one thing that we always have to remind ourselves about almighty God is that God is always in control amen and even when things seem like they're getting out of control amen the god that we serve is always in control am it it don't matter if your body is getting sick it it doesn't matter if your finances are going different ways it doesn't matter if things are going on within your family or going on within your church it doesn't matter if there's confusing situations going on we serve a god that is a mastermind and one thing that we've learned about that we see through experience that he is always in control he knows everything that is going on Amen and whether it's good things or bad things whether it's mountains that you're dealing with or valleys that you're dealing with those things can be rough sometimes Saints but I want to remind you that he uses those thanks for his Glory Hallelujah your life is a living manifestation of the glory of God when you get knocked down and you get back up again it's not giving glory to yourself but it's giving glory to there the god that is on the throne and greater is the god that is within you than he that is in the world amen amen amen glory to God Lord thank you Jesus Hallelujah Saints we have a lot of things that we go through on these footsteps of the path of life amen some of y'all deal with heartbreaking you deal with tragedies amen sometimes we deal with things that we don't understand but nevertheless the Bible lets us know that our footsteps are order hallelujah amen amen amen when you get the Revelation that your footsteps every step that your left foot and your right foot takes amen amen every step amen every opportunity when you get to understand that those footsteps are ordered of almighty God it changes your perspective Saints on any situation on any circumstance it brings you out to church on a Friday night even though you done worked all week long and then you'll come back out again on Sunday because you got a god that is on the throne taking care of you amen amen hallelujah amen says the footsteps of a righteous man amen are ordered amen not of President Biden not of President Trump amen not of the best person that you know but ordered by the Lord amen and whatever the Lord does is perfect and is perfect within his order so Saints what those things do is that they give us a certain amount of Peace within your trial amen what it does is it give you strength along your journey and the Bible says that almighty God he delighteth in those things amen amen sometimes it don't seem like there's any glory in those things but those things are a delight to almighty God Amen now Paul had to deal with something after all of the things that he did and all of the things that he overcome Paul had to deal with something called a shipwreck amen glory to God am amen Paul he had his experiences y all read his experiences with we know about his lifestyle as Saul but he was big time the scripture says that he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees he was of The Tribe of Benjamin of the stock of Israel amen Paul thought he was a big time man amen and in the midst of all of that when he had those religious demons on them cuz how many know the worst type of demon to get rid of is a religious demon am a self-righteous spirit that I got it all figured out I got it all under control and that's what SA have when he was still sof amen amen but God did something for him that he does for all of us amen he had a oneone face Toof face experience with the Lord Jesus Christ one day Hallelujah and anybody that comes in contact with the presence of Jesus Christ amen glory to God your Weight Watchers plan could change your life but it ain't going to change your life but so much a college degree can change your life but it can't change your life but so much but you come into the presence of almighty God amen amen it'll be the greatest thing that'll ever change your life amen amen amen amen hallelujah yes Lord Paul he came into the presence of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah and he moved on from them and almighty God fulfilled the promise unto him filled with the Holy Ghost amen and he goes all over the area preaching the gospel amen and preaching the Gentiles amen and trying to straighten out the Jews and and baptizing others amen amen he's straightening out the church left and right amen making them uh Christians instead of being Jews amen amen scripture even says that one day he with stood Peter to the face amen glory to God lord anointing him to write letters amen anoint him to write letters that we reading even to this day amen giving us strength to let us know what's going on letting us know about an adop let us know about a Rapture letting us know how to treat our wives and treat our families let us to this day that give us strength that was straighten out the God Head amen and in the midst of Paul doing all of these things Saints the Mighty God that sits on the throne let him get into a shipwreck now I would have thought a man that was doing more for God than almost any man up until that point amen I would think that that man would be a man that was taking care but nevertheless almighty God allowed him to get into a shipwreck sa the Shipwreck was so bad when you read the story in the book of Acts it lasted for 14 days the storm did uhh it blotted out the sun they couldn't even see the stars they had to throw everything overboard amen prophet of God brother brand he said even them salty Sailors that was on the ship and then seen a lot of Storms and a lot of challenges even then they got scared come on the Bible says look like all hope was gone hallelujah amen and the reason why I talk about those things tonight Saints is sometimes we get into shipwrecks amen amen amen sometimes we get into trouble sometimes we get into things that we don't understand and those things happen to try to shake your face am to make you think that God is giving up on you Hallelujah but I want to remind you tonight that your footsteps are ordered and every circumstance almighty God has an ordained way to bring you out Hallelujah glory to God sometimes we talk about an ordination like it's just for the ministry a ordain you to preach amen yes that's ordination but Jesus Christ has ordained all of you to be believer in this hour amen you got a commission you got a ministry as well and if God has the one that has ordained you that he has to be the one that's going to see you through amen amen amen amen sometimes we get in the shipwrecks amen amen sometimes Saints we have to remind ourselves that we are not on a cruise amen this is not a cruise amen this is a tedious Journey amen now we going to a cruise amen but right now on this Earth amen it's some bumps and there some ups and there some Downs there some scrapes there some some surprises amen even some rexs amen but through it all the scripture says this we know amen not this that we heard not this that I read in a book but this we know that all things work together for the good amen amen and when we get to the point where we really take a hold of that thing it it changes our entire walk as believer amen things that would have bother you when you had that short Temp and that short fuse it don't bother you anymore amen if you would have fussed at your wife over the smallest thing amen once you know that all things work together saints that have cut down on the fussing from the brothers it will help the sisters Amen to be patient with their husband and the father leadership that almighty God has given them amen and the divine order that God has given them because you know that all things work together if you got children that you worried about all things work together if the DCT that keeps giving you bad reports after bad report your testimony still should be that all things work together Hallelujah I'm not an English major but I know that the word all doesn't leave some things out amen the word all it does doesn't leave out the hard things it it doesn't leave out the confusing things but the word All Saints it means all and if God promised that it's going to work together I know nothing else than to tell you to trust him and believe in him when the Bible tells you that all things work together grab a hold of that promise amen amen let that be like Samson amen let that be your Jawbone of ass amen that you can use to beat down a thousand Devils amen and a thousand demons Hallelujah all things work together Lord amen to your name Jesus amen You Know The Enemy did not like what Paul and him was doing amen he never liked his ministry cuz his ministry was tearing his kingdom down amen he didn't like his ministry because his ministry was going to bring an impact to the Saints of this day amen and sometimes when people talk about the message of hour they try to treat it as this new thing amen all the message did was to bring us back to what Paul and them was doing amen all it did was turn our hearts back to that same Faith the same faith of the fathers amen and here the enemy is trying to attack this man by the name of Paul Accord to God and the enemy trying to drown him amen but what we have have to understand if there was a wreck that Paul was in Hallelujah that means that God had to cause the wreck and if God is the one that cause the wck saints that means that God is going to have to take care of you within the wreck he can't cause the wreck and then turn around and let you drown amen and let the enemy get the victory know if the wreck happened God allowed it to happen amen and he was going to allow a way to escape amen one thing you have to remember about the program of God is that God always Hallelujah not sometimes not maybe but he always make a way of escape from Genesis to Revelation he makes a way of Escape all the way back in the Garden of Eden when they got out of line God still made a way of Escape all the way in the Book of Revelation amen when the scripture starts to open up them Seven Seals amen and the enemy looking like he about to get victory over the people of God there was a way of Escape that was provided and the Plan of Redemption was laid out because God is always in the business of making a way hallelujah amen and the scripture says when this ship wrecked it was some that they was some strong sers amen glory to God that's a tongue twister they were strong swimmers amen and they could swim their way on out hallelujah praise God I thank God for the strong swimmers amen then it was some they had a fancy away it said that there was some boards there and they was able to find this nice piece of board that was cut out they could grab a hole to the board and the board provided their way of Escape now remember Paul was already told that not a one of them would be lost it was 276 people aboard this ship 14 days storm not a one was lost because they were pre-ordained amen amen some swam the way out some caught a whole of a board and the scripture says some just caught a hold of a broken piece and I read that and I start to think I said Lord a broken piece what what does that even mean on maybe a handle broke off somewhere somebody was just able to grab that amen maybe it was a piece of a door Flo by amen and somebody was able to drap themselves overneath that door amen may it was a piece of the MK or something and somebody was just about to sink and they looked up and as they saw that piece of MK going by they was able to put out a hand on it and it was able to carry them safely to their destination glory to God see Saints sometimes we can only catch a whole of a broken piece every now and then but what I want you to understand is that if God has ordained that broken piece even that broken piece will get you to the shore glory to God hallelujah God has blessed us with the greatest message to ever hit the face of the Earth amen It's Made Men good husbands it's made wives good wives it's cleaned up the lives of teenagers it took self-righteous people and by God's grace it made them humble amen it opened up Mysteries of the end time and now the Book of Revelation is not a sealed book to us anymore even though it's a book of symbols we got to understand of what those symbols mean God has blessed us with a lot of things to be able to swim to the shore but sometimes everybody can't grab a hold of everything but what I want you to be able to grab a hold of is a broken piece every now and then amen now a broken piece for you might be a scripture as simple as by his stripes I am healed you might not be able to quote the seals book amen you might not be able to name the church ages in order but if you are sick you can grab a hold to a piece and that peace might not look like much but Paul said even the smallest pieace was going to be enough to take them all the way to the shore GL to God this is a time where if you got a little bit of peace in your life the devil will come in and he'll try to take away all of your peace amen am soon as the job get going good boss start cutting up they trying to lay people off amen see like the wife doing good then the kids start cutting up then the kids doing good the husband start cutting up next thing you know everything long spoo then this brother get on your nerves in the church and that sister leave you out when it's time to invite people to this party and and it's always something that we're dealing withen enemy always trying to take your peace amen GL to God but in the midst of all that you can grab a whole of a piece of the word amen that say he will keep you in perfect peace if you keep your mind stayed on him amen amen amen for he trusteth in thee amen amen since all of this word that we've been getting and all this word that we've been feeding upon is not for any type of reason but it's to get you all the way to the shore amen you got a predestinated appointment amen hallelujah I like that word predestination amen glory to God Propet of God he broke that down Amen to let us know that your footsteps are order that your destination is already determined now we know you put that in the wrong hands my destination is determined that I'm going go flying down I77 as fast as I want to go Hallelujah we know that God don't put that type of spirit in the belief amen but what predestination should do for you is it shall remind you how much God loves you and it should remind you in the midst of every bow and every test and every trial that there is a God that is taking care of you amen and so when the enemy is trying to condemn you you can hold on to a piece of the word where it says there's therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus amen condemnation is a killer amongst the Saints amen the sisters feel condemned sometimes when they look at themselves the other sisters amen sometimes the brothers feel condemned a preacher can turn around and condemn himself but nevertheless the gospel says there's therefore now no Nation to them that are in Christ Jesus if you catch a hold of that Revelation hold on to that piece of the ship amen amen and it'll be more than enough to take you where you need to go amen amen amen amen bless him sa when Paul and them was out there in that water in the midst of the darkness it wasn't just no no no door handle that was holding them up the promise was that it was an anointing door handle amen it was an anointed way of Escape it it it wasn't just any regular piece of wood but God stepped in and did something amen oh yes there was something more that was holding him than what you could see with your natural eye amen what was holding him was that the word of God had already been spoken over him and it had been spoken over his life and We Know that heaven and earth can pass away but his word will never pass away so all he had to do was hold on to what the word said about him now if the word says about you that almighty God will have himself a BRI without spot or wrinkle that all you got to do is hold on to that word you might got wrinkles in your life that need to be ironed out just stay with the word you might have spots with in your life that need to be cleansed out by that great Clorox bleach all Mighty God just stick with the word the word is going to be the thing that carries you to whever you need to go Hallelujah and what Paul had he didn't just have man's word but he had a word that said thus sayith the Lord you going to stand before sees amen glory to God and I'm going tell y'all tonight thus sayth the Lord you'll be able to stand with him on that day because he has pre-ordained you to make it thank you Lord amen thank you you don't got a choice but to make it amen even them days where you feel like you don't want to make it guess what God said come on we coming to church anyhow amen amen them days you feel like quitting guess what God going to say sit down and go ahead and open up that scripture and start reading my word amen amen them days you feel like God ain't hearing a prayer that you trying to pray to him that's when he tell go Ahad and get back on your knees and tell me what you have need of amen amen God has ordained pieces that will get us all the way through amen thank you Father amen when Jesus Christ hold you Saints Hallelujah man can hold you and he can do all right but when Jesus Christ holds you it's a permanent work amen amen am when Jesus Christ is holding you it'll cause you to forgive one another Hallelujah cuz sometimes forgiveness binds people up if Jesus Christ is holding you amen and your pastor preached the other night on Friday night when I was here that God is love amen hallelujah the perfect love amen if Jesus Christ is holding you amen then you going to manifest some perfect agape love amen amen amen if he's holding you amen and you need your life stri to be more clean and more holy and more purified and set aside the almighty God Jesus Christ holding you he can take care of all those things Amen to God lord lord when Paul was out in that water it was more than just a piece of wood holding them up am but he was being held up by the word of God Amen and Saints no matter what test that you dealing with it's not your own willpower holding you up amen it's not just because brother Simmons is a good man that's holding you up what's holding you up is the word of almighty God Amen and he'll have to bankrupt Heaven and Earth before he lets one word slip amen before he lets one word not come to pass he has to see it all the way through amen thank you Jesus Lord Jesus one thing we have to remember amen I ain't going to keep y'all all night amen what gives us confidence in every situation is the same God that brought you through it before will be the same God that will do it again Hallelujah amen amen he he allows us to get into things because the same God that did it before will be the same God that'll do it again you know one of the things that you have to understand about this shipwreck for Paul was that this was not Paul's first shipwreck amen he had done been there he had done done that he knew what his God can do amen you know the the scripture Paul starts to break down some of the things that he went through I'm going to read it to you briefly in second Corinthians praise God the 11th chapter and the 25th verse amen praise God and what happens amen I'm back up to the 24th verse Paul is starting to detail all of the things that he's gone through for the sake of the Gospel he's not boasting but but he's just letting people know that he been through some things he wasn't a rookie he done fought some battles that overcame a couple of things amen but God saw him through everyone he said sometimes preaching to those stiff neck Jews they would get mad at him and they will whip him amen and the Old Testament law was that you can whip them but you couldn't whip them 40 times of that cuz that was considered to be improper so they would whip you 39 times and Paul said I had that punishment done to me five times amen five times received die 40 Stripes save one five times that I reive the 39 Stripes me y'all could do the math he took a lot of beatings amen it says Thrice was I beaten with rods this is a separate beating once I was stoned Hallelujah y'all know what stoning is Right praise God sometimes we get stoned for what we believe he said once I was stoned thce I suffered shipwreck Paul had already had three shipwrecks a night and a day I have been in the Deep now I used to always read second Corinthians thinking that Paul was describing part of his experiences from the book of Acts but I had to look it up a minut I'm not a Bible scholar but but I want to look I want to see what did Paul write out before he ran upon this shipwreck in the book of Acts and what did he write out after that shipwreck in the book of Acts and what I came to find out was that he had already written this before that story occurred in the book of Acts so what that lets me know Paul had done been through this show before and Paul had to understand of who Jesus Christ was and how Jesus Christ was going to take care of him exactly amen before Paul even got in this situation he had already written First Corinthians amen second Corinthians he had already written the book of Galatians he had already written The Book of Romans so imagine when Paul was out there in the water that night he started thinking about that letter that he wrote out to the Roman Church about this we know that all things work together for the good and what happened he got reminded of the word that almighty God had anointed him to write out to the people and imagine that gave him strength when he was out there floating on that board amen amen that even in the midst of this all all things will work together amen when Paul was out in that water he had already wrote out in the Book of Romans what could separate us from the love of God sometimes it feel like the enemy trying to separate you from the love of God Amen you might think that circumstances separated you from the love of God hallelujah but Paul let us know that nothing can separate us from the love of God amen amen Jesus Christ amen amen Paul had already rolled out nay in all things we are more than conquer us amen amen he was in the water already manifesting what he already rote out for the believer that he was more than a conqueror that nothing could separate him from the love of God that all things even in him being in the midst of that storm all things still have to work together Hallelujah he had a test testimony Saints before the first shipwreck even happened amen he had a testimony in the midst of this shipwreck amen that all things will have to work together Hallelujah I'm drawing to a close but even after his trial he had to look at amen what he went through and sometimes our trials what our trials should do Saints we don't just go through trials so we can be beat up and shed some tears and pray a long time and then go on about our business but trials should grow us up as Christians trials should change how we look at things and we should come out of trials with a testimony amen amen amen hallelujah amen we shall come out of trials with a testimony otherwise the Lord will repeat the test again and you have to go through the same battle again amen amen Paul he started to write some things after he came out out of the Shipwreck amen and it was half the Shipwreck when he wrote the book of Ephesians and the Book of Philippians and the book of Colossians and the Book of Timothy amen 1 and second Timothy it was after the Shipwreck when he rode in Philippians the fourth chapter and the 13th verse that I can do all things amen amen through Christ who strengthens me amen amen Saints sometimes we don't feel like we could do all things but Jesus Christ operates on a different type of power than what we operate on our own and if Jesus Christ says that you can do all things then you could do all things it was after the Shipwreck amen that Paul could write out about a god who's blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen and sometimes it feel like we living in Satan's Eden a literal hell on this Earth where the enemy seems like he's doing what he wants to do and Paul said that through your Revelation amen is a revelation that was lost Through the Ages but God restored it in the end time amen that you would be able to rest in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen it was after the Shipwreck amen that Paul could talk about that he has chosen us in him how longen probably God said was from the next Revival uh uh to the next service he CH us within him from before the foundation of the world and it reminds us that we were sealed that the Holy Ghost is a seal to the people of God yes it gives you strength yes it cleans up your life but it also a seal and the enemy cannot get into that seal because you're redeemed to the day of your Redemption amen amen amen s was after all these things amen Paul came out of this thing with a testimony he caught a hold of the right peace he trusted in almighty God and trust is something we've been working on back home trust is a beautiful thing trust means I don't always see the end of the story I don't see the answer but I still trust I believe that it's still going to take place anyhow amen amen amen Trust trust is actually an aspect of Faith amen we can trust God because we have faith in him amen amen amen amen one of my most favorite scriptures amen we trying to close amen Proverbs the thirr chapter and the 5ifth verse amen hallelujah she put it up before I can even get it all the way out I like that praise God that's an anointing amen you know I was dealing with this at the camp for Brother Anderson with the young people amen it's been a scripture it guided me through my teenager years it guided me in my 20s when I was in college amen it's guided me into my 30s amen even as a middle-aged man getting into my 40s now it still guided me and if Lord tering we get into our 50s it'll guide us then amen amen but when it says trust in the Lord amen yes think about all the things that people put their trust in a lot of people putting their trust into the next election they ain't going to get you but so far a lot of people putting their trust into the doctor but but you have to trust in the Lord amen and you being able to trust in the Lord if your footsteps are ordered by him the Lord is going to take care of you you can't trust everybody with certain things amen praise God Amen if I needed uh to get my kids something to eat right quick and I give brother Ernest $50 brother Ernest can you go down to the restaurant and get my bring my kids back something for my family give us a something to eat I spent enough time with brother Ernest that I trust him with that that $50 that he's going to bring back and mean he's going to bring back the things that I asked for or he's going to bring back the money to me amen I got trust in him but all of us know certain people that we would not hand them that $50 bill and ask them to do that for us amen because we don't have trust in them it could be things that they have shown us it could be that they have not come to a certain level of maturity yet but nevertheless what I'm trying to tell you is that you can't just put your trust in anything amen glory to God don't put your trust in man Hallelujah you can trust one another but you only trust even one another up to a certain extent by the power of Jesus Christ amen Saints when you trust in the Lord yes that can't be a halfway commitment amen I trust him up to a certain point but when it looks too difficult and I don't think that he can meet the challenge then I'll move my trust and I'll try to figure it out my own way the scripture says trust in the Lord with all of your heart amen amen trust me that I don't see it but I know that it's there yes Lord I don't see my truck outside but I know it's part right there if I was the duck behind here I can't see my wife right now but I trust that she's there amen because I've had enough experience to know it amen amen and trust in the Lord amen sometimes we can't see everything but nevertheless the scripture says trust in him with all of your heart Saints not with some of your heart with all of your heart amen and remember we in an age where God deals with the hearts amen true amen that's what Malachi 4 said I wouldn't turn your mind I wouldn't turn your ears but I will turn your heart in a time where you think that your heart going the right direction I will turn your heart back to something that'll get you on the right direction and Saints when your heart gets turned you don't have to worry about it amen amen amen sometimes people get upset cuz this person going this way and this person going that way what you'll find out maybe their mind got turned maybe their feelings got turned but their heart never got turned amen and when your heart gets fully turned to something GL to God Amen we got some teenagers in here when your heart as a young man gets fully turned towards a woman ain't no stop you amen we ain't rushing that before it's time amen but I'm just saying that heart is a powerful thing amen when you trust in him amen when you stop leaning to your own understanding when you stop trying to figure it out yes Lord God will bless you amen yes Lord Paul could rest on that broken piece because he know he didn't have to figure it out God had already said it about him amen and that settled it amen he didn't have to worry about it anymore amen musicians y'all can come on up amen hallelujah he didn't have to worry whether or not they were going to make it whether or not they were going to survive he knew what God had already said about him he knew that he had to appear before season amen amen God had gave him a path and it was up to God to take care of that path amen Saints God has given all of you a path amen and sometimes in our own feelings amen we don't feel like we adequate enough for the path amen sometimes we get that Gideon Spirit on us and the Lord says th Mighty Man of Valor I'm going have you take care of the enemy amen and take care of the battle for the people and Gideon looking around talking about boy who who Who's the Mighty Man of Valor here get in he talking about you me I'm out here hiding behind the house just to thres the wheat for my family but nevertheless the angel of the Lord saw something different in him amen even that Gideon could not see himself amen amen if God place you in a position Saints no matter what trial no matter what test amen your footsteps are ordered and all things have to work together amen sometimes it might not feel that you holding on to much but what God has us holding on to Saints is an anointed word a Vindicated word in this hour amen amen and that word has proven that it's more than enough for the people of God am the Lord shows so much that Paul's footsteps was ordered after they came out of the Shipwreck they landed on an island called M amen and the chating of the island amen his daddy was sick them being on that island they started to have a healing service on the island that they wasn't even supposed to be on in the first place but they were there because God had predetermined that somebody needs some help am amen what I want to let you know even in the midst of the Shipwreck that footsteps were on cuz they can have a healing service there were soldiers that got saved that was on the ship they would not have gotten saved except that shipwreck happen there was other people on the island that got healed they wouldn't have got that healing except that shipwreck happened amen and sometimes you overcoming these things you defeating these trials it's going to be a blessing to you and it's going to be a blessing to somebody's life amen am Saints I just want you to be encouraged to keep fighting amen amen I I I think about Paul when he wrote that letter to Timothy at the end of this journey and Paul was writing out I I fought a good fight amen Saints whatever we do fight a good foot amen the Lord had already told Paul all of them was going to make it not a soul would be lost all you got to do is stick with the ship man might have a negative opinion of your ship man might put up all kind of things on the internet about your ship but one thing you have to have a revelation of the ship that God has given you that is predestinated and predetermined because it's not based on man idea but it's based upon the word of God and the Bible lets us know that heaven and earth will pass away but his word will never pass away Saints we are an ordained people in an ordained hour and we're like es to call for such a time as this amen am and I want to assure you tonight that God will provide whatever you have need of bring you all the way
