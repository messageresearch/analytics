[44:42] the same one as the scripture says that

[45:18] same shall be saved and this gospel of
[45:21] the kingdom shall be preached in all the
[45:22] world for witness in all nations then
[45:25] shall the income when ye therefore see
[45:27] the abomination making desolation by
[45:29] daniel the prophet stand in the holy
[45:31] place whosoever read and let them
[45:33] understand then let them which are in
[45:35] judea flee to the mountains let him
[45:37] which is in the house top not come down
[45:39] to take anything out of the house
[45:40] neither let him but he's in the field
[45:42] return
[45:43] back to take his clothes and woe unto
[45:45] them that are with child and to them
[45:48] that gives suck in those days
[45:50] but pray ye that your flight be not in
[45:52] the winter neither on the sabbath day
[45:54] for then shall come great tribulation
[45:56] such as as was not since the beginning
[45:59] of the world to this time
[46:01] no nor ever shall be and except those
[46:04] days be shortened there should be no
[46:06] flesh
[46:07] there should no flesh be saved but for
[46:10] the elect's sake
[46:11] those days shall be shortened then if
[46:14] any man should say unto you lol here is
[46:16] christ or there believe it not for there
[46:19] shall rise false christs and false
[46:21] prophets and show great signs and
[46:23] wonders if
[46:24] in so much if it were possible they
[46:28] shall deceive the very elect behold i
[46:30] have told you before wherefore i shall
[46:32] say unto you
[46:34] behold he is in the desert go not behold
[46:36] he is in the secret chambers believe it
[46:38] not i'll just stop right there
[46:40] you know if you can read further on down
[46:42] later on in your own time
[46:45] jesus
[46:46] talking about you know well we just read
[46:48] no we want to talk about the elect this
[46:49] morning but jesus you know was asked a
[46:52] question because that that's been
[46:54] the the i believe one of the biggest
[46:56] questions of all time is when is the end
[46:59] gonna come will there be an end or when
[47:01] will it come come on well jesus began to
[47:04] declare to the disciples that you know
[47:06] he was saying that
[47:08] in one place you've read further down
[47:10] you're saying no man know that they know
[47:12] the hour not even the angels in heaven
[47:14] so he would he would say
[47:16] that no man would know the day of the
[47:18] hour but he would let us know what the
[47:20] season would be like
[47:24] what the atmosphere would be like when
[47:26] the end of the world was coming come on
[47:28] so
[47:29] as he declares to us what the world
[47:32] would be like when the end was coming
[47:33] come on i says that we ought to be
[47:36] spiritual enough to look around and see
[47:39] the signs of the time
[47:41] see that the conditions are right for
[47:43] the end come on
[47:45] do y'all believe that
[47:46] a lot of times people don't want to
[47:49] don't want to reckon with that but the
[47:50] conditions are right come on
[47:53] the fruit is right on the tree
[47:57] so jesus talking about these things and
[48:00] you know one thing i i said that what he
[48:03] did
[48:04] he described that before the world
[48:06] before the end of the world the world
[48:08] would be in the miss
[48:10] come on
[48:11] wars rumors of wars pestilence violence
[48:13] earthquakes people was going to be
[48:15] hating betraying one another all these
[48:18] things he said that's what the world was
[48:20] going to be like
[48:21] but in the midst of all of that chaos
[48:25] god was going to have an elect out there
[48:28] in the midst of all of the turmoil and
[48:30] the pestilence and all these things he's
[48:33] saying unto you this morning i don't
[48:34] want you to be troubled though come on
[48:37] i don't want you to fear you saying god
[48:39] how can we survive in all of that chaos
[48:41] that you said that's coming on the world
[48:43] come on
[48:44] but he says that if it wasn't for time
[48:46] being shortened no flesh should be saved
[48:48] that's how wicked it'll be he said but
[48:51] for the elect's sake
[48:52] even in the midst of all that darkness
[48:55] come on it's still a little light
[48:56] somewhere in the midst of all that
[48:58] darkness god is still looking out for
[49:01] you and i as individuals because we are
[49:03] the elect of god
[49:05] so you know we look at the media world
[49:07] today and how they bring in fear and
[49:09] fears gripping the world of the diseases
[49:12] and the pestilence and the and the
[49:13] things the desolation all that's coming
[49:16] on the world but you know in our hearts
[49:18] it's something that's in our hearts that
[49:20] we can't fear
[49:21] because we know that when the enemy
[49:23] comes in like a flood the spirit of god
[49:26] always lifted up a standard
[49:28] we ain't looking at uh what we see today
[49:30] but we're looking back at so many clouds
[49:32] of witnesses that's standing on the
[49:34] outskirts in the spirit that's
[49:36] testifying come on that all you've got
[49:39] to do is hold on to his unchanging hand
[49:42] he never failed me he will never fail
[49:44] you
[49:45] hallelujah oh jesus don't that excites
[49:49] you
[49:50] the doe that we can look at daniel come
[49:52] on
[49:53] that was stolen in the lion's den they
[49:55] told him not to pray he said i'ma still
[49:58] do what the will of god is
[50:00] hallelujah thrown in the lion's den we
[50:03] can call daniel up to testify and he can
[50:05] testify that in the mount in the face of
[50:08] lions god was still faithful the hebrew
[50:11] boys can testify that in the face of
[50:13] fire god is still faithful come on i
[50:16] said what you going through this morning
[50:18] let the saints testify that god is still
[50:20] faithful
[50:21] oh jesus
[50:23] hallelujah
[50:24] what is it about it's about the gods of
[50:26] light come on but we find that today i
[50:29] said that the world of being a mess come
[50:31] on we're living you know in the age
[50:34] where the people have put god out of his
[50:36] own house
[50:38] didn't they
[50:39] come on i said a lot of times go around
[50:41] and look and every year get worse don't
[50:43] it
[50:44] you start seeing things that you said it
[50:47] looked like in times past people would
[50:49] have felt dead maybe if they came in the
[50:51] house of god doing that but what it is
[50:54] it they don't put him out it ain't his
[50:56] house no more it's a house of devils
[50:58] ain't it
[50:59] come on
[51:00] you said if god ain't in there then who
[51:02] they worshiping
[51:03] let's be real come on singing on the
[51:06] choir playing music preaching the gospel
[51:10] so-called well they're living any kind
[51:12] of life come on the bible declared that
[51:15] in this hour they'd be lukewarm come on
[51:18] they wouldn't be cold nor hot
[51:20] in the church living hypocritical lives
[51:24] out there in the world living like the
[51:26] devil
[51:26] shouting on their way to heaven so they
[51:29] think come on but in that day they hear
[51:32] him say depart from me you workers of
[51:34] iniquity i ain't never knew you
[51:36] hallelujah but i say don't let that
[51:38] deter you this morning because
[51:40] somebody's real somewhere come on
[51:42] there's a real god somewhere that's
[51:44] somebody worship that's for real it's
[51:47] somebody that's living right
[51:49] do you believe that this morning
[51:51] hallelujah
[51:53] but i said that we live in that we be
[51:55] living in that day come on that they
[51:57] don't mind shouting
[51:59] and all these things you know that the
[52:01] spirit in the end time wouldn't would be
[52:03] a religious spirit wouldn't it
[52:05] come on
[52:07] the end time spirit wouldn't be
[52:08] something that would be easy to be
[52:10] pointed out
[52:11] jesus said that false christ was gonna
[52:13] rise come on prophets and all these
[52:15] things showing great signs and wonders
[52:18] in so much if it were possible either to
[52:20] see the very elect
[52:22] but the elect they don't look just for
[52:24] signs and wonders because they know the
[52:26] signs and the wonders they they follow
[52:28] those that believe come on but what is
[52:30] the elects the elect they love the word
[52:32] of god the elect they love god's word in
[52:36] season and out of season why because
[52:38] they see it as a gateway to the eternal
[52:40] life i believe that peter and them told
[52:43] jesus they said lord where are we going
[52:45] to go come on we know that what you're
[52:48] saying is hard but we ain't got nowhere
[52:50] else to go hallelujah and we know that
[52:52] thou has the keys to eternal life god
[52:55] give us the word
[52:57] that's what i want
[52:59] hallelujah
[53:00] people don't want the word today
[53:02] do they because of what does the word do
[53:04] the word gonna clean their life up the
[53:07] word's gonna make them quit fornicating
[53:09] and committing adultery we're gonna make
[53:11] them quit lying and cheating and
[53:13] stealing but the word is going to come
[53:15] in and clean up that heart clean up that
[53:17] life hallelujah and make you walk pure
[53:20] in front of god
[53:21] amen hallelujah he said straight is the
[53:24] gate now is the way that leaders to
[53:27] eternal life come on and this ain't a
[53:29] miserable way but it's righteousness
[53:31] peace and joy in the holy ghost if you
[53:34] say i'm walking that way and i can't do
[53:36] this and i can't do that you're just
[53:38] living by rules and regulation but those
[53:40] that's got a revelation
[53:43] hallelujah they ain't miserable but they
[53:45] walk in that straight in that narrow way
[53:47] and they enjoy the trip
[53:50] they thanking god because they got
[53:52] righteousness peace and joy in the holy
[53:54] ghost
[53:55] i don't know about you this morning but
[53:57] it's righteousness peace and joy
[53:59] you ought to be smiling this morning you
[54:02] have to be glad that god allows you to
[54:04] come in his house one more time come on
[54:06] i don't know what you come to do but i
[54:09] come to praise the lord hallelujah i
[54:11] don't know what y'all come to do
[54:14] what y'all come to do this morning
[54:17] hallelujah
[54:18] did you come to clap your hands
[54:20] come on
[54:22] did you come to hear god's word
[54:24] hallelujah oh jesus
[54:28] i'm just third this morning come on i'm
[54:31] only down here every once in a while
[54:33] but god is good it's good it's good to
[54:35] see everybody in the house of the lord
[54:36] this morning amen
[54:38] i says what it is
[54:39] you know we know that we're living in
[54:41] this in this hour and jesus declared how
[54:44] how the hour would be and you know we
[54:47] talking about the the the end time
[54:50] and the end time spirit would be just
[54:52] such a religious one come on but they
[54:54] would be showing great signs and wonders
[54:56] but jesus talked about deception too i
[54:58] don't want you to be deceived come on
[55:00] you know i was thinking about i know a
[55:03] certain woman preacher and how you know
[55:05] she's got a gift for healing and many
[55:07] times people are take taking their
[55:09] children and stuff or whatever from the
[55:12] hospital and where the doctors gave him
[55:14] up and they took him to this woman and
[55:15] she prayed for him come on and the lord
[55:18] healed him come on you say was it god
[55:20] come on
[55:21] god is the only healer right
[55:24] but what it is i said don't you be
[55:25] deceived sometimes many times people can
[55:28] look at that and they say well i know
[55:30] the lord called her to preach i know
[55:32] that the lord is she going to have a
[55:34] place in heaven that's between her and
[55:36] god but i know what the word of god says
[55:38] the word of god said i suffered not a
[55:40] woman to teach no use authority over a
[55:42] man come on no matter how much she's
[55:44] gifted remember gifts and callings are
[55:46] without repentance that don't override
[55:48] the word of god and that's why so many
[55:50] people are deceived today because of
[55:52] gifts come on and they let they give out
[55:55] i override what the word of god says but
[55:58] remember heaven and earth is going to
[55:59] pass away but the word of god is going
[56:01] to stand forever
[56:03] come on when the books were opened every
[56:05] man was judged by it what was it it
[56:07] wasn't by the book of your church or
[56:08] what people wrote and said about your
[56:10] life but you was judged by the bible
[56:12] come on
[56:13] and that's what it is even if i never
[56:15] been able to work one miracle and all
[56:17] these things right there lord when i'm
[56:18] george let let it be known that i live
[56:21] by the word of god
[56:23] and i stood by the word of god
[56:25] i did the best i could do
[56:27] to live according to what you asked me
[56:29] to live god
[56:31] hallelujah
[56:32] that's what i'm standing on is that what
[56:34] you're standing on this morning come on
[56:36] but we know that that the hour will be
[56:38] that way come on false christ and all
[56:40] these things showing signs and wonders
[56:42] he says but i want you to be deceived he
[56:44] said if it were possible it would
[56:46] deceive what the very elect didn't it
[56:49] look how close this thing would be
[56:52] if it were possible it'll deceive the
[56:54] very elect but he says that if it were
[56:57] possible but it's not possible
[56:59] what something something's got to happen
[57:02] the the separate you come on to open
[57:05] your eyes

[57:09] of the holy ghost is the most important
[57:11] thing out all your shouting your dancing
[57:13] and singing come on you got to get the
[57:15] baptism of the holy ghost not just on
[57:17] your flesh come on the way you shout
[57:19] every now and then not in your spirit to
[57:21] speak in tongues and prophesy but it's
[57:23] got to go down into the soul
[57:25] come on because that's what the battle
[57:27] is over don't you know that these
[57:28] fleshly desires are warned against your
[57:31] soul come on it's trying to destroy your
[57:34] soul so what it is god and i don't want
[57:35] to just show my flesh and in my spirit

[57:40] because that's the place that's the
[57:42] anchor come on
[57:44] in that place god takes over
[57:46] in that place god is on sitting in the
[57:48] control tower he's he's guiding the ship
[57:51] in that place then the devil can't
[57:53] deceive you why because god is taking
[57:56] over come on god is guiding you to the
[57:58] left and to the right
[58:00] come on ways open up you say that might
[58:02] look like a good way to go but the holy
[58:04] spirit is in control down in the bottom
[58:07] come on and he's guiding you saying oh
[58:09] that way might look prosperous but this
[58:12] is a hard way over here but this is my
[58:14] way hallelujah
[58:16] hallelujah
[58:17] oh jesus i said lead me lord i'll follow
[58:21] wherever you want me to go at god
[58:24] david said through the valley and the
[58:26] shadow of death i will fear no evil why

[58:31] me the rod and i stabbed that covered me
[58:33] come on do you believe that this morning

[58:44] god will be in there with you in the
[58:46] fire
[58:47] don't be afraid to walk through all
[58:48] these things why because he said i'll
[58:50] never leave you nor forsake you do you
[58:53] believe that this morning come on so i
[58:55] say is it here you know talking about
[58:58] the elect how it would be and all these
[59:01] things and you know in this hour like it
[59:04] says it would be such a mess come on
[59:06] that they put him out his own church but
[59:09] even in that he says behold i stand at
[59:12] the door not come on
[59:14] god has still got an elect out there
[59:16] he's not necessarily looking for whole
[59:19] churches come on people get that
[59:21] confused
[59:22] that
[59:23] or or either that they can ride off a
[59:25] ground my religion
[59:26] or
[59:27] a mama or daddy religion come on i heard
[59:30] saying once at a funeral that the sister
[59:33] was such a great sister and all these
[59:35] things at a funeral i was at and let it
[59:37] be known let her name be put on the
[59:39] books that god would would bless her
[59:42] family all these things like that come
[59:43] on but it don't work like that come on
[59:46] when you get to stand before that judge
[59:48] it ain't gonna be that mama stand for me
[59:51] come on
[59:52] you're gonna need to have god for
[59:54] yourself

[59:56] to be applied to yourself you're gonna
[59:58] have to accept the lamb for yourself
[1:00:01] hallelujah i think about so many great
[1:00:03] people even mary the mother of jesus
[1:00:06] hallelujah but on the day of pentecost
[1:00:09] the scriptures mentioned that she was up
[1:00:11] in the upper room with him why because
[1:00:13] even though she might have been his
[1:00:15] natural mother she needed a savior
[1:00:17] herself she needed to get down on her
[1:00:20] knees and repent herself she needed the
[1:00:22] holy ghost too hallelujah
[1:00:25] how much more do you and i today need
[1:00:27] that new birth need god to do something
[1:00:30] deep down in our soul
[1:00:32] hallelujah

[1:00:37] something something got to happen in
[1:00:39] your spirit
[1:00:40] amen i believe that something gotta
[1:00:42] happen down on on the inside
[1:00:45] come on he says there to be miserable
[1:00:47] blind naked all these things he says but
[1:00:49] they and they wouldn't even know it come
[1:00:51] on but what happens when the holy ghost
[1:00:53] comes he opens your eyes to how
[1:00:55] miserable you are how wretched and how
[1:00:58] naked you are how you need god to clothe
[1:01:00] you he opened your eyes to the condition
[1:01:02] that you're in and then you cry out oh
[1:01:04] god help me oh lord save me oh god get
[1:01:08] me away from my flesh and my desire oh
[1:01:10] god save me from my own self deliver me
[1:01:13] from my own will oh god help me
[1:01:16] god knows you need help
[1:01:18] come on
[1:01:20] if you don't think you need help then
[1:01:21] you already deceived god knows you need
[1:01:24] help
[1:01:25] god knows you can't deliver yourself god
[1:01:27] knows you can't walk on your own he said
[1:01:29] if it were possible it'll deceive even a
[1:01:32] very elect god knows that
[1:01:34] but he's saying let me come in come on
[1:01:37] i said he says behold i stand at the
[1:01:39] door and knock come on
[1:01:41] if any man would open up the door i said
[1:01:45] i was praying the other day and i said
[1:01:47] it ain't sometimes people don't have a
[1:01:49] problem with opening up the door
[1:01:51] but when he come in you got to let him
[1:01:53] feel welcome
[1:01:55] you got to make him welcome when he come
[1:01:57] in come on
[1:01:58] you can't just open up the door and
[1:02:00] don't invite him in every room
[1:02:02] come on
[1:02:03] sometimes we invite him in every room
[1:02:05] but in our personal space
[1:02:07] because in that place we don't want
[1:02:09] nobody to touch
[1:02:10] we don't want the man of god to deal
[1:02:12] with that place but i tell you what
[1:02:14] don't let that place be the reason you
[1:02:17] lose your soul
[1:02:18] come on i said when you come to god let
[1:02:21] god come in every room let the word deal
[1:02:24] with every space god come in my personal
[1:02:26] space

[1:02:30] for me

[1:02:33] i said a lot of times people don't have
[1:02:35] problems opening the door come on
[1:02:38] letting them in but the only way
[1:02:40] the only way that god can help you
[1:02:44] effectively help you come on you got to
[1:02:46] let him in every room
[1:02:49] you got to let him in that place that
[1:02:51] you don't want nobody to touch
[1:02:53] come on
[1:02:54] that place in your life
[1:02:56] where you know that struggling battles
[1:02:58] you got to let god in there
[1:03:00] you got to say here god you're welcome
[1:03:02] in my come on god knows you in bad shape
[1:03:06] come on because you were born that way
[1:03:08] do you believe that
[1:03:10] i don't know about you but like i said
[1:03:12] always say i like that song it says i
[1:03:14] came to jesus just like i was weary come
[1:03:17] on

[1:03:20] resting place come on god knows you in
[1:03:23] bad shape when you come to him come on
[1:03:25] so don't be ashamed to open up and let
[1:03:27] god here i am god standing before you
[1:03:31] disarmed and naked lord i need your help
[1:03:34] come on don't be afraid to let god in
[1:03:37] god he knows your barrels he knows your
[1:03:40] struggles he knows where you're
[1:03:43] he going to help you
[1:03:45] come on but you got to let them help you
[1:03:47] how many want to let the lord
[1:03:48] help them this morning
[1:03:50] amen but i see say you know we find that
[1:03:54] he's saying that you know i stand at the
[1:03:56] door knocking all these things talking
[1:03:58] about the late come on even and all that
[1:04:00] even in all that guard has still got an
[1:04:03] elect out there you know you know what
[1:04:05] happens
[1:04:07] and i say this
[1:04:08] you know i says a lot of times as
[1:04:10] individuals we play with the devil
[1:04:13] come on
[1:04:14] but you know what the devil the devil
[1:04:16] got three things
[1:04:17] he he come to do
[1:04:19] kill
[1:04:20] steal and destroy
[1:04:22] come on but yet we play with such a one
[1:04:25] as that
[1:04:26] i thought about sampson
[1:04:29] and how
[1:04:30] you know the bible
[1:04:31] talked about how
[1:04:33] delilah and how she asked him plainly
[1:04:37] not even cutting corners she asked him
[1:04:39] plainly what do i got to do
[1:04:41] the afflict you come on
[1:04:44] what do i have to do to take all your
[1:04:46] strength that you'll be like any other
[1:04:47] man
[1:04:48] she didn't use no deception she asked
[1:04:50] him plainly what i got to do come on
[1:04:52] and what it is playing with the devil
[1:04:55] he again said all you got to do that's
[1:04:57] got to do that the bible says that that
[1:04:59] she had men in the chamber lying in
[1:05:02] weight that at the time she called that
[1:05:04] they can come up and bind him
[1:05:06] and afflict them come on what it is the
[1:05:09] devil playing with the devil a lot of
[1:05:11] times come on he ain't playing with you
[1:05:15] he got demons come on sitting in the
[1:05:17] outskirt waiting on a time when you at
[1:05:20] your weakest waiting on a time with god
[1:05:24] come on it's walked away from you
[1:05:27] then what call this little demons come
[1:05:29] up and afflict you
[1:05:31] you get up thinking maybe i can go and
[1:05:34] repent as i did as other times not
[1:05:36] knowing that god has left you
[1:05:39] hallelujah demons got a hold of your
[1:05:42] life
[1:05:42] now to take the mercy of god hallelujah
[1:05:46] it gets you away
[1:05:48] but yet the whole time we were playing
[1:05:50] with the devil
[1:05:52] come on
[1:05:54] and that goes to the young and the old
[1:05:56] playing with the devil come on
[1:05:59] but god was merciful come on
[1:06:02] what me
[1:06:03] you know we start like they say we serve
[1:06:05] our awesome god we serve a merciful god
[1:06:08] come on maybe we need to add that verse
[1:06:09] into the song
[1:06:11] we serve a merciful god don't we come on
[1:06:14] a god of mercy
[1:06:16] a god that forgave you over and over and
[1:06:18] over again a god that a god of patience
[1:06:21] come on that's patient a god of long
[1:06:24] suffering that's long suffering waiting
[1:06:26] on you hallelujah i'm so glad that god
[1:06:29] had patience with me i'm so glad that

[1:06:34] glad that he's still being patient with
[1:06:36] me right now come on i'm so glad because

[1:09:32] have not chosen me but i've chosen you
[1:09:34] come on

[1:09:38] know sought god at any time come on by
[1:09:41] your choosing you didn't seek god
[1:09:43] but god chose you it was always in the
[1:09:45] nature of man to run from god do you
[1:09:47] believe that
[1:09:49] god man's nature when he failed it was
[1:09:52] just the garden of eden it's telling him
[1:09:54] running to god what did he do he ran
[1:09:56] from god
[1:09:57] but nevertheless him being
[1:10:00] made in the image of god god's elected
[1:10:03] what did god do god sought after him
[1:10:05] hallelujah he wouldn't let him stay in
[1:10:07] that condition for so long but what he
[1:10:10] did he sought after him he might have
[1:10:11] had to go through something but
[1:10:13] nevertheless god made a way of escape
[1:10:15] god made a way for for uh adam and those
[1:10:19] when they failed to get back come on it
[1:10:22] was going to be a hard way but
[1:10:23] nevertheless he made a way for them to
[1:10:25] get back and that's what it is with you
[1:10:27] and i you and i are the elect of god
[1:10:29] chosen come on we didn't seek out the
[1:10:31] god come on in no time did we seek out
[1:10:34] to him but it was him that sought after
[1:10:36] us
[1:10:36] because remember we were born in sin and
[1:10:38] all these things in times past we walked
[1:10:41] according to the lust of the flesh and
[1:10:42] all these things in the in in life
[1:10:45] that's the way we walk that was by
[1:10:47] nature who we were come on
[1:10:49] but nevertheless god come on
[1:10:52] god had elected you before the
[1:10:55] foundation of the world god had already
[1:10:57] chosen you
[1:10:58] you said you yes god has chosen you and
[1:11:01] he put something in you that the world
[1:11:03] don't know nothing about and all it was
[1:11:05] one day he began drawing on that seed
[1:11:07] that he put in you he began drawing on
[1:11:10] that life that he placed in youth before
[1:11:11] the foundation of the world you didn't
[1:11:13] go seeking after him but he began
[1:11:15] calling that deep began calling out to
[1:11:18] the deep you didn't know what it was but
[1:11:20] up under all of the mess up under all of
[1:11:22] the darkness and all these things
[1:11:24] something began to happen come on life
[1:11:26] began to grow things began to take place
[1:11:29] down on the inside something began
[1:11:31] drawing on you and you didn't know what
[1:11:33] it was but what it was it was by
[1:11:35] election that elect you were the light
[1:11:37] of god and god began calling you out
[1:11:41] hallelujah
[1:11:43] oh i'm so glad
[1:11:44] all the demons and devils they couldn't
[1:11:46] hold you down
[1:11:48] come on
[1:11:49] all of the things that were on your life
[1:11:51] they couldn't hold you back
[1:11:53] why because
[1:11:54] it was a greater he that was in you was
[1:11:56] greater than he that was in the world
[1:11:58] that see that life that was in you god
[1:12:01] was drawing on it
[1:12:02] all you had to do was quit fighting and
[1:12:05] let go and let god have his way how i'm
[1:12:07] gonna get out of it lord i don't know
[1:12:09] but god you're drawing on me draw me out

[1:12:14] didn't he hallelujah
[1:12:17] hallelujah come on
[1:12:20] and i'm so glad that the lord brought me
[1:12:22] up

[1:13:44] hairs
[1:13:47] i said they taken over
[1:13:49] he said well you know
[1:13:51] i said i got more than my brothers he
[1:13:54] said well you got more children than
[1:13:55] they
[1:13:57] but nevertheless i said what it is god
[1:13:59] is so good come on
[1:14:01] you know i walk with many they ain't had
[1:14:03] a chance to see gray hairs in the head
[1:14:05] come on but what is it god has kept me i
[1:14:08] can look back at those things i was in
[1:14:10] the midst of all of that with the same
[1:14:12] mind
[1:14:13] frame but what's the difference come on
[1:14:14] and i ain't saying god done with nobody
[1:14:16] yet but what's the difference the
[1:14:18] election come on
[1:14:20] god has called you out come on
[1:14:23] god has elected you

[1:14:29] come on
[1:14:30] he called you out
[1:14:32] he he recognized you as the prophet of
[1:14:34] god saying one place and when you came
[1:14:36] about he said he recognized you come on
[1:14:39] why because you were in his mind and no
[1:14:41] you didn't know who you were
[1:14:43] god was getting ready to start something
[1:14:45] come on
[1:14:46] on on the inside to start bringing back
[1:14:49] your remembrance come on
[1:14:50] that hey you in the world but you're not
[1:14:53] of the world and that's why you were
[1:14:55] never satisfied while you was out there
[1:14:57] because the only way you was going to be
[1:14:59] satisfied
[1:15:00] is that you give in to the thirst that
[1:15:02] was in your heart and the only one that
[1:15:05] could quit that thirst that was in your
[1:15:06] heart would be god and god alone why
[1:15:09] because god put it there and he made it
[1:15:12] the way it would only be quenched by him

[1:16:10] come on you are chosen by god
[1:16:12] come on
[1:16:13] you're the elect of god and it's
[1:16:15] something it's something about the elect
[1:16:17] come on
[1:16:19] that distinguishes them from the rest of
[1:16:21] the world
[1:16:22] the
[1:16:23] elect has has always learned to live by
[1:16:26] faith
[1:16:27] come on
[1:16:28] the elect of god
[1:16:31] i could say they mastered the art of
[1:16:32] faith right
[1:16:36] because
[1:16:37] you know i was saying the other night
[1:16:39] that israel they they could see their
[1:16:41] enemies come on in the natural
[1:16:44] but yet even though they could see their
[1:16:45] enemies in the natural they still had to
[1:16:47] live by faith
[1:16:49] didn't they
[1:16:50] they still they could see their enemies
[1:16:52] but even though they could see them when
[1:16:53] they went before they can go out to
[1:16:55] fight and all these things they still
[1:16:56] had to have faith in god
[1:16:58] they still had to believe that god was
[1:17:00] going to do something supernatural to
[1:17:01] give them the victory
[1:17:04] in the midst of that come on in the
[1:17:06] midst of them being able to see it they
[1:17:07] knew that they weren't even able to
[1:17:09] strategize enough we still need your
[1:17:11] help god
[1:17:12] so they had to learn to live by faith
[1:17:14] didn't they and so much as they had to
[1:17:17] learn to live by faith how about you and
[1:17:19] i today come on now we ain't wrestling
[1:17:21] against flesh and blood come on
