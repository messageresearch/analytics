[10:38] see if you believe that give the Lord a
[10:40] hand clap of
[10:50] Praise it's nothing that we could have
[10:53] done it was all about his
[10:56] grace isn't it sufficient for you
[11:00] amen unmar
[11:05] Grace asking nothing in return but your
[11:08] love amen
[11:11] amen man the grace of God yes
[11:16] Lord you know how many times I look at
[11:19] my past
[11:21] and things I used to
[11:25] do when the grace really sinks in amen
[11:30] amen you wouldn't be here without Grace
[11:33] amen you wouldn't be here without God
[11:36] Amen but it's because God saved you yes
[11:41] Lord that's what it
[11:43] is are you happy today
[11:47] amen you know I heard an orgon in the
[11:50] office and I was like man I'll tell you
[11:51] who that
[11:53] is there's
[11:56] Caleb I'm going to preach about Caleb
[11:58] today
[12:01] the lord gave me a little
[12:04] thought it's not a conviction message
[12:09] it's an encouraging message amen I I
[12:12] believe that we need to encourage one
[12:14] another amen you know and I I was
[12:18] sitting back there and I was like Lord I
[12:20] I don't know where to really
[12:23] go you know there's moments in a
[12:26] Minister's life you have so many mind
[12:28] battles
[12:29] [Music]
[12:31] and sometimes you're wondering is this
[12:34] the right thought is this what people
[12:36] need or is there something else and I
[12:40] battled all night and battled all
[12:45] morning I guess the only thing to do is
[12:47] just preach
[12:50] amen but I believe the
[12:52] Lord if there's some people that are
[12:55] here
[12:56] discouraged you can leave here
[12:58] encouraged amen amen amen and I believe
[13:01] that amen amen just keep playing that
[13:04] softly Amazing Grace let's go before the
[13:09] father gracious Heavenly Father
[13:13] Jes Lord
[13:17] Jesus father I'm already
[13:20] aware of how close you
[13:24] are father you're here in our midst this
[13:28] morning father you said in your word
[13:31] where two or three would Gather in your
[13:33] name yes Lord Jesus father there you
[13:37] would come down in their
[13:39] midst Lord and you'd begin to fellowship
[13:42] with us father and I'm
[13:45] reminded back in the very beginning of
[13:47] time when you
[13:49] created Adam father Yes Lord Jesus Lord
[13:53] and you from a part of him made his wife
[13:57] yes Lord father and you created them in
[14:01] your likeness the scripture tells us
[14:03] Lord because you desired
[14:06] something father you desired a
[14:09] fellowship yes Lord you desired somebody
[14:12] to walk with you yes Lord you desired
[14:15] someone to talk with you to know you as
[14:18] their
[14:19] friend Father and then a separation
[14:22] would happen we know the scripture
[14:24] father Yes Lord but you made a Plan of
[14:28] Redemption yes Lord to bring back a
[14:31] restored fellowship with you once again
[14:35] but father I often times have
[14:38] thought if
[14:41] Eve father as she had done what she done
[14:46] Lord father if there was one thing that
[14:49] if she could have looked back on her
[14:50] life she was missing something she was
[14:54] missing a fellowship with you she was
[14:57] missing as the prophet taught us is
[14:59] walking in the cool of the evening with
[15:02] you father and I I I believe that if she
[15:06] could have done it all over
[15:08] again that she would have never done
[15:10] what she had
[15:12] done and she would have wanted that
[15:14] Unity always father but we thank you for
[15:18] your
[15:19] grace we thank you for your
[15:22] mercy and we ask you just now father to
[15:25] come
[15:26] down father and speak lip to ear to
[15:31] every
[15:32] heart and every being that is in this
[15:35] building right now father if there's
[15:37] someone that doesn't know
[15:39] you I pray they'd come to know you yes
[15:42] Lord father and I pray Lord Jesus says
[15:47] there's things in people's lives yes
[15:50] Lord father there's things in my
[15:52] life I need you to move on
[15:56] Lord father and I'm honest enough to say
[15:59] it I need you yes
[16:02] Lord father more than ever before
[16:05] there's a people here that need you yes
[16:08] Lord father just come down and meet us
[16:11] this morning and we will be care careful
[16:14] to give you all the glory all the honor
[16:18] and the
[16:19] praise
[16:21] amen do you love the Lord this morning
[16:25] amen amen if you have your Bibles we're
[16:27] going to go right into the word thank
[16:28] you
[16:29] musicians done a wonderful job there's a
[16:32] wonderful
[16:33] atmosphere atmosphere
[16:36] here amen do you believe that amen amen
[16:40] if you have your Bibles we want to look
[16:43] in the
[16:44] scripture over at
[16:46] numbers the 13th
[16:49] chapter
[16:51] and we'll take our thought from the
[16:54] 30th verse
[17:01] amen and when you're there say
[17:06] Amen now the
[17:10] Bible the Bible would read in
[17:13] Caleb Ste the
[17:16] people Steed the people before Moses and
[17:19] said let us go up at once and possess
[17:24] it for we are well able
[17:28] to overcome
[17:31] it let's read that one more time and
[17:35] Caleb stealed the people before
[17:39] Moses and said let us go up at
[17:45] once and someone say this with me and
[17:49] possess it and possess
[17:53] it for we are
[17:57] well aable
[18:01] this morning I'd like to take a
[18:04] thought on listening to the voice of
[18:08] encouragement
[18:12] amen with a subtitle of we are well able
[18:18] amen amen do you believe that this
[18:21] morning
[18:22] amen
[18:26] amen now you may be seated
[18:32] sorry I was sitting here and looking at
[18:35] this scripture the other
[18:38] night and I better start my timer so I
[18:41] don't hold you 3
[18:44] hours you guys wouldn't have a problem
[18:46] with that I'm sure
[18:52] but
[18:54] amen now I was looking at this scripture
[18:56] and I seen how in the
[18:59] scripture here we look earlier on and
[19:04] Moses is telling or or calling out a
[19:10] people in the very beginning of the 13th
[19:12] chapter Moses the Lord had spoke to
[19:15] Moses and said there's going to be a
[19:16] certain people of every tribe that you
[19:19] will have and they're going to be the
[19:21] spies that will go into this land now we
[19:24] know that this is when they're at Kadesh
[19:26] and
[19:26] barnea now
[19:29] Moses sends every man and I'm not even
[19:33] going to attempt to say all the tribes
[19:35] names and all their names you know
[19:37] because it's
[19:40] hard but we know what the scripture says
[19:44] and so he calls out these people and
[19:47] sends 12 Spies as we find in the
[19:49] scripture that there are 12 Spies that
[19:52] would go and two of them would be Joshua
[19:55] and
[19:56] Caleb Joshua and Caleb would they'd go
[19:59] over to this uh place and spy out the
[20:03] land now this isn't unfamiliar to you
[20:05] you would know what I'm talking about
[20:07] but I'm trying to give you the natural
[20:10] side of it here right now because I'm
[20:12] going to type it back to where we are
[20:13] now now we see in in the 27th verse it
[20:18] says and they told him that we came unto
[20:22] the land with thou sentest sent us and
[20:25] surely it floweth cuz Moses when he told
[20:28] them go into this land you're going to
[20:30] see what's there is it good land or is
[20:32] it bad land is it able to be taken or is
[20:34] it not what what kind of uh um is there
[20:39] is there uh milk and honey or what's the
[20:42] fruit of that land he wanted to know and
[20:44] he wanted to report he wanted to hear
[20:47] the report from the from his spies that
[20:49] he would send and so they come and the
[20:53] the the the the 10 of them are saying we
[20:56] can't do this we can't do do this it's
[20:59] not able we're we're we're small in
[21:01] their sight we're not able to possess
[21:04] this land this is yeah there's good
[21:06] fruit there we brought you the fruit but
[21:08] we we can't do
[21:12] this and we find this here in the 27th
[21:16] chap or the 27th verse and it says and
[21:18] they told him and said we came unto the
[21:20] land with thou sent us and surely it
[21:23] floweth with milk and honey and it
[21:29] and this is the fruit of it nevertheless
[21:32] the people be strong that dwell in that
[21:35] land so what they're doing now as we
[21:37] find in this scripture is they're not
[21:39] looking at what God can do they're
[21:42] looking at their circumstances they're
[21:44] looking at what's around them they're
[21:46] looking at the hurts they're looking at
[21:48] different things and they're looking at
[21:50] the size of their enemy they're looking
[21:53] at the strength of their enemy they're
[21:54] looking at things that we shouldn't
[21:57] Focus on but because someone is on the
[22:01] Intercourse of this and they're he's
[22:04] he's battling them taking them off track
[22:07] and showing them hey I'm going to
[22:09] discourage you you can't do this you're
[22:12] not going to fight this battle you're
[22:14] not able to make it you aren't good
[22:16] enough and he will always tell you that
[22:18] you're not good enough and we find this
[22:20] here these 10 but there's two that will
[22:22] stand up amen out of the mouth of how
[22:25] many witnesses two or three Witnesses we
[22:29] find that Jose or Joshua and Caleb would
[22:31] stand up and say we are able we are able
[22:34] to take this land we are a no matter
[22:37] what would come against us what would go
[22:39] to us what what the hurt is or what the
[22:42] Brokenness is whatever it doesn't matter
[22:45] we can take this land am that's right we
[22:47] can fight for it we can make it amen and
[22:50] we find this how then Caleb would stand
[22:53] up and the Bible says he still now I'm
[22:57] going to give you the the definition of
[22:59] what stilled would mean stilled is an
[23:02] intransitive
[23:05] verb that means to become motionless or
[23:09] silent now we already know what the
[23:11] stilled would mean but I'm giving you
[23:13] the definition just so for the younger
[23:15] would know now motionless or silent to
[23:18] make something stop moving or become
[23:22] more calm so he's calming everyone's
[23:25] nerves he's telling people hey before we
[23:28] do anything we got to make sure our mind
[23:30] is Right amen we got to make sure that
[23:32] we're thinking things through we got to
[23:35] make sure that we stand on God's word
[23:38] about this because when God says that I
[23:41] will never leave you nor forsake you
[23:42] it's a promise amen and if and if he
[23:45] won't leave us on the battlefield he
[23:48] won't leave us at the house if he won't
[23:50] leave us at the house he won't leave us
[23:52] on the battlefield he's going to be with
[23:54] us everywhere that we go because he
[23:56] loves you and he desires that Fellowship
[23:58] with
[24:01] you and now the after Caleb would steal
[24:04] the people before Moses now brother
[24:07] Brandon would tell us that Moses was God
[24:10] to the
[24:11] people he was God to the people he was
[24:14] telling people what the word of the Lord
[24:17] was now Joshua we would find is a type
[24:20] of the Holy Ghost amen Joshua would be
[24:23] there guiding the people and telling
[24:26] them hey we're going to make this
[24:29] through Caleb was a
[24:32] spokesperson for Joshua and Moses
[24:36] amen
[24:38] now to possess the next thing that he
[24:41] would say is not only am I going to
[24:43] steal you but I'm going to possess we're
[24:46] going to possess this now to possess is
[24:49] to have belonging
[24:51] to one or to
[24:55] own having belonging to
[24:59] or to
[25:00] own now brother brandom would say in
[25:02] this
[25:03] message he says now cadish there this is
[25:06] the message um Israel and the
[25:10] church number
[25:13] four now
[25:15] [Music]
[25:17] Kadesh and there he said now you go out
[25:20] and spy out God sent them Moses Moses
[25:23] never so so Moses what had happened is
[25:27] God had told Moses these are the people
[25:29] and Moses just did what the Lord told
[25:31] him to do called out these people now
[25:34] God sent them over and said go over and
[25:37] spy out the land and come back and tell
[25:40] us whether it's a good land or a bad
[25:43] land whether we can take it or or what
[25:48] and that and the other you go over there
[25:52] find out and the 12 men went
[25:55] over they cut a great cluster of grape
[25:58] you know about the Harlot Rahab and so
[26:02] forth all right they went over and this
[26:06] cluster of grapes returned back but
[26:09] listened to the report of the 12 men or
[26:13] the the 10 brother brand would then
[26:15] correct it and say and the 10 of the 12
[26:17] said oh they are
[26:19] fearful look over there what a sight
[26:22] listen to this and now we turn over to
[26:25] the 17th verse or the 27th verse rather
[26:28] to read goes ahead and tells us the
[26:31] men that was sent out and there or and
[26:36] when he return when they returned back
[26:38] the hearts were fainting so now we find
[26:41] a scripture for this that man's hearts
[26:44] are failing for
[26:47] fear and it's as we look I'm going to
[26:50] drop that here and as we look now in
[26:53] today's society we have reports of
[26:56] different things going on in the nation
[26:58] we have different things that are
[26:59] happening and man if they don't know God
[27:03] their hearts are beginning to fail for
[27:05] fear they're beginning to look at
[27:07] circumstances of who's going to win the
[27:09] next election and who's going to be the
[27:12] next governor and who's going to be and
[27:14] they're looking at the circumstance and
[27:15] looking at their rulers they're looking
[27:17] at things of the natural of their uh uh
[27:20] of of right here right now and they're
[27:23] failing to look back to the author and
[27:26] the finisher of the faith the one who
[27:27] knows the beginning to the end and it's
[27:30] because there's a heart issue it's
[27:32] because there's people that don't know
[27:34] their God it's because there's people
[27:36] that need to know God but they don't
[27:38] know where to find him because it seems
[27:40] like the courthouse has taken God out of
[27:42] the church or toen him out of the system
[27:45] and took God out of the government when
[27:47] in the very beginning this nation was
[27:49] built on under God this is what this
[27:53] nation was built under is to have the
[27:56] faith it you know it was a part of this
[27:59] system that we should have God in the
[28:01] churches it's a part of the system that
[28:03] we should have God in our houses we
[28:05] should have a freedom of speech we
[28:07] should have a freedom of religion but we
[28:10] see how the government is slowing slowly
[28:13] taking it and man's hearts are failing
[28:15] for fear because they look so highly to
[28:18] their
[28:20] government and I'm not getting into the
[28:22] politics because I realized that brother
[28:24] brandham said that they are of the devil
[28:25] and that is the truth but I'm just
[28:28] saying that when man looks at the fear
[28:32] his heart is going to fear when he hears
[28:35] rumors of wars he's going to fear
[28:38] because there's something missing amen
[28:42] amen now I I'm just trying to bring this
[28:45] down right here
[28:48] how to know your
[28:52] God they need to know God and Caleb was
[28:58] trying to get them to listen to their
[29:00] God Amen he was stealing
[29:03] them making them be quiet
[29:07] listen because in order for God to speak
[29:10] there has to be silence
[29:14] amen he was bringing a silence so he can
[29:18] speak to the hearts
[29:21] amen because Caleb said we can take this
[29:25] land amen Caleb said that we can do
[29:29] this we are well able somebody say that
[29:34] we are well able are well aable we are
[29:38] well able to take the land amen we are
[29:42] well able to do
[29:45] it but it's so easy to get
[29:48] [Music]
[29:49] discouraged it's so easy to get broken
[29:52] it's so easy to get tried amen it's so
[29:55] easy to get
[29:56] hurt and and many times we dwell we
[29:59] dwell on our hurt and our Brokenness and
[30:02] our condition and and what the doctor's
[30:05] report is and we dwell on what things of
[30:08] the natural are and we know that the
[30:10] natural types of Supernatural but we are
[30:13] looking at how we hurt and we break and
[30:18] we need encouragement amen amen
[30:21] scripture tells us we need to encourage
[30:23] one another amen
[30:36] brother brandom continues on and says I
[30:38] like that my just a little
[30:42] further but the men that went up with
[30:45] him said we be not able to go against
[30:49] the people for they are stronger than we
[30:53] and they brought up an evil report
[30:55] listen to that so the people brought up
[30:58] an evil
[30:59] [Music]
[31:01] report and they had searched out the
[31:04] children of Israel saying the land which
[31:08] we have gone to search it is land that
[31:11] eateth up with inhabitants
[31:14] thereof and the people that we saw in it
[31:18] are men of great
[31:21] stature listen to that and it goes on to
[31:26] say we look like grasshoppers
[31:29] Hoppers imagine that you're looking out
[31:32] you're trying to find a report I would
[31:35] be scared too if I saw a man who was a
[31:38] giant and I'm looking at my size man I'm
[31:42] small I'm probably a grasshopper in his
[31:44] sight too you know and so I can see why
[31:46] they would get discouraged because it's
[31:48] so easy when you see that doctor's
[31:50] report says that you have stage four
[31:54] cancer and you look at it it's scary
[31:58] it's bigger than
[32:00] you because now you're looking at it in
[32:02] front of
[32:04] you and I'm speaking this from
[32:07] experience my wife's aunt she got
[32:11] diagnosed with
[32:13] cancer and I watched how at first they
[32:17] said it was stage
[32:20] five and I watched how she took it at
[32:24] first she was like well I'll just trust
[32:26] God now now the doctor being a Christian
[32:29] doctor he said don't claim
[32:33] it he said this is what the report says
[32:36] but don't claim
[32:37] it amen
[32:39] amen and she for a while didn't claim it
[32:44] but then she got
[32:46] discouraged because she began to pull
[32:48] out that
[32:49] report she went to the doctor's reports
[32:53] she went to the doctor's offices and she
[32:56] began to get fear ful even though she
[32:59] knows where she's
[33:01] going but she was looking at the
[33:04] circumstance she was looking at this
[33:10] thing now we know that this is a
[33:13] spirit this spirit is attacking
[33:19] her and the Lord told me to go over
[33:21] there and
[33:23] pray I went drove two hours to go pray
[33:27] for her
[33:30] and I prayed and two days later she
[33:32] tells me that she feels
[33:36] different she goes to the next doctor's
[33:40] office and the doctor would tell her we
[33:42] can't find a trace of
[33:48] [Music]
[33:51] cancer shortly after
[33:55] that then they look in another part of
[33:58] her body and they find cancer
[34:02] there and so this
[34:04] cancer had gone it went and then it came
[34:08] back and this doctor that's why the
[34:09] doctor again would say don't claim
[34:13] it don't claim it but now the doctor
[34:17] said medically I don't think we could do
[34:20] much for
[34:22] her so now she's at this place where she
[34:25] just wants to trust the Lord
[34:30] but you see and that's how crucial it is
[34:33] that we trust the Lord amen
[34:37] amen a
[34:40] circumstance can bring you
[34:44] astray it can hurt you
[34:47] amen if you're looking for a perfect
[34:50] Pastor or a perfect preacher you won't
[34:52] find it amen amen you won't find it you
[34:56] won't find a perfect song leader you
[34:58] won't find a perfect
[35:01] musician I'm a musician myself I know
[35:04] what it's like to mess
[35:07] up get a
[35:09] complex I don't want people to hear me
[35:15] play because when you mess up and some
[35:18] people they'll man you messed up on that
[35:20] song and there's those that are man you
[35:22] did so
[35:24] good we all know those two different
[35:26] types of people
[35:31] obviously want to hear the voice of
[35:36] encouragement amen do you love the Lord
[35:38] amen
[35:40] amen
[35:44] Amen brother Brandon would continue
[35:48] on man it seems like it's taking me
[35:51] forever to go through this quote doesn't
[35:53] it all right 10 of them now the church
[35:57] Church
[35:58] [Music]
[36:00] came and it's now to the place where
[36:03] we've come down through the Luther age
[36:06] the Methodist age and the Pentecostal
[36:09] age and on down to a
[36:13] place and now some of the Full Gospel
[36:17] turned family against Divine Healing are
[36:21] firmly against Divine Healing believe
[36:25] that it wasn't even in the
[36:28] atonement well it's got to a place
[36:32] friends where
[36:34] you it's getting horrible out here isn't
[36:38] that true it is getting horrible oldtime
[36:40] religion they say it's something that's
[36:43] passed long
[36:46] ago don't have it it's too much we're
[36:50] living in a modern day and we've got to
[36:53] get modern ideas we've got to have
[36:57] Shuffle boards in the church pingpong
[36:59] games and everything to hold our young
[37:01] people my if that if that's what it is
[37:04] you know brother Brandon would go on he
[37:06] might as well just stop preaching he
[37:09] said because if if if the gospel can't
[37:11] save them if the gospel can't change
[37:14] them then why why should we even preach
[37:17] it because if we're only going for an
[37:19] entertainment on a Sunday and we're
[37:21] going to go back to wherever we go on a
[37:23] Monday and a Tuesday and forget about
[37:26] you know I was listening to a preacher
[37:28] the other it was actually CT Townson and
[37:30] he was uh preaching
[37:32] on
[37:34] um owning you're wrong or some admitting
[37:38] you're wrong and he he made a statement
[37:41] he said his mom had told him years and
[37:44] years ago that sin will keep you from
[37:48] this
[37:49] Bible or this Bible will keep you from
[37:55] sin and man that's struck me because
[37:58] it's plain and it's
[38:01] true if you're a
[38:03] sinner why don't you want to read the
[38:07] Bible because it exposes you
[38:10] amen but when you are reading your
[38:15] Bible it will make you realize that sin
[38:19] stay away
[38:22] amen and it will make you separate from
[38:25] that old man it will make you separate
[38:26] from all those you know and I was just
[38:29] very it it really spoke to me when he
[38:32] said that that if you that sin will keep
[38:36] you from the
[38:37] Bible and your Bible will keep you from
[38:42] sin and then he goes on to saying that
[38:45] we don't need to be a part-time
[38:47] Christian
[38:49] amen we should read our Bible on a
[38:51] Monday and on a Tuesday and on a
[38:53] Wednesday and a Thursday and a Friday I
[38:56] I'm just saying this to say say that we
[38:57] need to be a Christian on a Sunday just
[39:00] as much as we need to be on a Monday we
[39:03] need to be a Christian on a Tuesday just
[39:04] as much as we need to be on a Wednesday
[39:07] we need to be a Christian all the time
[39:09] because we can't let the hurts and the
[39:11] Brokenness determine who we are we can't
[39:15] let our Brokenness develop who we are we
[39:18] need to get up out of our little moping
[39:21] stage we got to stand up and say we can
[39:24] take the land if you have a hurt you got
[39:27] to go and meet the problem if you got a
[39:30] Brokenness you got to go and speak to
[39:32] the Brokenness you got to go and and you
[39:35] got to claim your healing if you're sick
[39:37] in your body you need to go make it and
[39:40] you got to go and find an altar or
[39:41] something and you got to say Lord I mean
[39:44] business I need healing I need you like
[39:47] never before I need salv if you're not
[39:50] saved if you're an unsaved young person
[39:52] or older person whoever you might be if
[39:54] you don't know God and you need God in
[39:56] your soul
[39:57] you can just call on the Lord and he'll
[40:00] come down to you because he said you
[40:01] have not because you ask not and that's
[40:04] what he's Desiring is someone to ask if
[40:06] they want a relationship with him you
[40:08] just need to ask him for that
[40:09] relationship if you want to know him you
[40:12] got to ask him to know him if you want
[40:14] to be with him you got to ask to be with
[40:17] him you got to invite him I preached a
[40:19] sermon a few years ago on welcoming the
[40:22] unwelcomed Christ now brother Brandon
[40:24] would make this uh uh he would preach
[40:25] this sermon the unwelcomed Christ
[40:28] Christ but I took it and I said
[40:30] welcoming the unwelcomed Christ cuz
[40:33] brother brandom in that message showed
[40:34] us that Jesus was
[40:36] unwelcomed and he showed him what would
[40:39] make him
[40:41] welcomed it was a
[40:43] woman vile and ill and an ill- famed
[40:48] woman who would go down and cry tears at
[40:52] the Master's feet amen who would say God
[40:55] I'm a sinner amen I'm in need of a
[40:59] savior you know what she was doing
[41:01] brother brandham said that she was
[41:02] crying out tears of repentance they were
[41:06] tears of repentance all the tears that
[41:08] she washed his feet with she washed all
[41:10] the dirt off his feet just think about
[41:12] that for a few minutes she washed she
[41:14] got down on her knees in front of the
[41:16] Lord of
[41:18] lords and washed his feet with her tears
[41:22] not anybody else's notice this it wasn't
[41:26] anybody else's experience erience amen
[41:29] true amen amen it was her
[41:32] experience it was her time amen and when
[41:37] she meant business she got down on her
[41:40] knees nobody else had to do it for her
[41:43] she got down on her knees and washed his
[41:48] feet that's not all she did then she
[41:52] anointed him and kissed him continually
[41:56] amen
[42:01] she got down to business
[42:04] amen sometimes that's what we got to
[42:07] do we were all a
[42:10] type of that
[42:13] woman we were all that woman at one
[42:19] point and we needed to make stuff right
[42:23] amen now Caleb he tells him we can take
[42:26] this
[42:27] land and they go over to take the
[42:32] land we're well
[42:35] able friends what's holding you this
[42:40] morning we are well able amen amen if
[42:45] you need Deliverance you got to step out
[42:48] amen amen
[42:51] amen don't be that 10 that say we can't
[42:55] do this I can't get delivered I'm too
[43:05] filthy I've done too much in my
[43:09] life I'm
[43:11] too
[43:15] ungodly and you begin to sit in that
[43:18] corner and just remind yourself of what
[43:21] you used to
[43:22] do who you used to be
[43:28] and maybe all you need to
[43:30] do is seek Him amen amen amen friends
[43:35] this is ministering to me just as much
[43:37] as it is to you
[43:42] amen cuz I know what it's like to be
[43:46] hurt I know what it's like to be
[43:51] broken I know what it's like to be
[43:56] lost and I know what it's
[43:59] like to have
[44:02] things Stripped
[44:09] Away but we are well able
[44:13] amen we are well
[44:17] aable you don't have to be in that hurt
[44:21] any longer amen

[44:54] yours amen
[44:58] the promise of healing is yours
[45:01] amen the doctor's reports you can you
[45:04] can leave the stack of doctor's reports
[45:06] brother brandham talks about that woman
[45:08] with the issue of blood for 12
[45:10] years and showed us that she had stacks
[45:13] of doctor
[45:16] reports and she came to a place when she
[45:19] heard a man she heard of a man named
[45:22] Jesus amen and when she heard his name
[45:25] she stepped out amen she had been held
[45:29] up and just got out when she was going
[45:30] to doctor's
[45:32] reports and she heard about a man who
[45:35] can touch her she heard about a man that
[45:38] can save her she heard about a man that
[45:40] can deliver her she heard about a man
[45:43] that can take her lust she heard about a
[45:45] man and I'm saying this to say that when
[45:48] she stepped
[45:50] out he changed her story amen amen amen
[45:55] she didn't do it amen she just had to
[45:58] step out amen sometimes that's all we
[46:00] got to do we got to step out and we got
[46:04] to say God I mean business amen I need
[46:09] you like never before and when she steps
[46:12] out you know what she said she said if I
[46:15] could just
[46:16] touch she said if I could just Touch the
[46:20] Hem she didn't even have to touch him
[46:24] amen she had enough faith that if she
[46:26] could step out and just Touch the Hem of
[46:30] His Garment amen
[46:32] amen just this was enough to change her
[46:36] story amen amen just that was enough to
[46:40] deliver her amen just that was enough to
[46:42] save her just that was enough
[46:46] to to help her amen just that was enough
[46:52] to bless her just that was
[46:54] enough man maybe that's all we got to do
[46:57] amen if we got to have the Holy Ghost
[47:00] all we got to do is take a hold of His
[47:02] Garment am if we want to get some
[47:05] Deliverance all we got to do is take a
[47:08] hold of His Garment let's just take a
[47:10] hold of His Garment this morning the
[47:12] land is yours let's fight for it if you
[47:15] want a marriage fight for it if you want
[47:18] Deliverance fight for it if you want
[47:21] salvation you got to fight for it but
[47:23] how do you fight if you're if you're
[47:24] dwelling in your unbelief and how do you
[47:26] fight if you're sitting in your corner
[47:28] of unbelief and how do you fight if
[47:30] you're not going to get up and get out
[47:32] of that chair and get out of that hurt
[47:34] and get out of that Brokenness to step
[47:35] out he can't help you if you're not
[47:38] going to step out he can't help you if
[47:39] you don't want to make a move he can't
[47:42] help because it's up to you it's your
[47:44] choice amen amen it's your choice to
[47:48] step out if you want salvation it's your
[47:50] choice if you want healing it's your
[47:53] choice it's your choice it all comes
[47:55] down to what do you want
[47:57] do you want to walk with God or do you
[47:59] want to have a part-time relationship
[48:01] I'll only know him on a Sunday and I'll
[48:03] only know him on a Wednesday he wants to
[48:05] know you in a very personal and intimate
[48:08] way he wants to know you even more than
[48:10] what your wife wants to know you he
[48:12] wants to know you even more than what
[48:14] your girlfriend wants to know you he
[48:15] wants to know you so much closer amen he
[48:19] wants to have a deeper relationship with
[48:21] you he wants to have that same kind of
[48:23] unity that he used to have with Adam and
[48:26] Eve in the very beginning he wants to
[48:28] have that restored Fellowship he wants
[48:32] that which he used to have with
[48:37] you he wants
[48:41] that but we got to fight for it
[48:45] amen we got to stand up
[48:53] yes we got to take courage
[48:57] and stand up on the basis of
[49:14] Faith now brother brandham was saying
[49:17] would say in the power of
[49:19] [Music]
[49:20] decision he says
[49:22] now over in numbers the 13th chapter
[49:27] in the 30th verse we read this and Caleb
[49:29] stealed the people before Moses and said
[49:31] let us go up at once and possess it for
[49:33] we are well able to overcome
[49:36] it and then he would say may the Lord
[49:39] add His blessings to the reading of the
[49:40] word last evening the two or the last
[49:44] two evenings we've been teaching just a
[49:47] little short lesson or session of the
[49:50] book of Exodus the calling out of the
[49:54] people of God
[49:56] because we believe it is essential to
[50:00] this
[50:02] day brother brandwood then continue on
[50:04] to saying I remember there or I remember
[50:07] here a few years ago I was a year and
[50:11] six months in my church and teaching on
[50:15] the book of Exodus and I was two years
[50:18] one
[50:19] time one time on
[50:23] job and I remember I'd had job on the
[50:28] ash Heap for about four
[50:32] weeks every Sunday job on the ash Heap
[50:35] such a beautiful story it is it's a
[50:39] beautiful story such a beautiful story
[50:42] God dealing with his
[50:44] Saint and how that we get in those
[50:48] places and distress and don't know where
[50:52] to
[50:53] turn and I was working for a climax
[50:57] one dear sister bless her heart she
[51:00] didn't want to hurt my feelings said
[51:04] brother branam I enjoy every minute but
[51:07] where are you going to get job off the
[51:10] ash
[51:13] Heap oh
[51:15] my God brought him off all right to
[51:18] Victory amen amen amen
[51:22] amen friends so many times we s sit and
[51:27] we scrape our hurts and our
[51:30] Brokenness and we sit there and
[51:34] just I need to get this
[51:38] off it's not going to heal it you ever
[51:41] got a
[51:43] scab your body won't heal if you keep
[51:46] scraping it off amen it'll continue to
[51:49] bleed it'll continue to
[51:53] ooze it will continue to stay
[51:57] a
[51:59] scab and as long as you're doing this
[52:01] with your hurt and as long as you're
[52:04] doing this and saying I can't make it
[52:07] over to I can't have my healing and I
[52:10] can't have Del as long as we're doing
[52:13] this I do this too so I'm not I'm not
[52:16] I'm not shaming no one it's human
[52:20] nature we always struggle with ourself
[52:27] brother brandom said that your flesh
[52:29] cannot be
[52:33] converted but we got to take courage and
[52:36] stand up and go take the land amen amen
[52:39] now Joshua 1 and9 have not I commanded
[52:43] thee be strong and of good courage Be

[59:49] was once the Judgment seat of the
[59:54] world there's a great spring and many
[59:58] little Springs LED off from
[1:00:01] it which is a perfect type again Christ
[1:00:05] The Big
[1:00:07] Spring the church the little spring off
[1:00:11] from Christ the Judgment seat judgment
[1:00:15] begins in the house of
[1:00:17] God here's where we are
[1:00:21] judged and it isn't a
[1:00:24] Pity when that when we see that we're
[1:00:27] wrong in doing the wrong thing living
[1:00:30] the wrong kind of Life associating wrong
[1:00:34] and everything that we're just not big
[1:00:38] enough to walk up and say God I'm
[1:00:44] sorry I'm the one that is wrong you're
[1:00:49] right and I'm wrong you forgive me and
[1:00:51] help me to do better next
[1:00:54] time if we just
[1:00:57] that if we were just that real about
[1:01:00] ourselves but we don't we hear the
[1:01:03] gospel preach and we say oh well I don't
[1:01:06] believe in it
[1:01:09] anyway you know so many times we walk
[1:01:13] and we just come to
[1:01:15] church I'm speaking this I'm going to
[1:01:17] lift my hand I'm speaking this from my
[1:01:21] experience where we come to church and
[1:01:23] we listen to the preacher
[1:01:26] and we listen to what he says but then
[1:01:30] so many times
[1:01:31] we're ready to just go to the soccer
[1:01:35] game and go to eat lunch and we just
[1:01:40] completely forget about what he
[1:01:43] said and I I know this is from my
[1:01:46] experience where I'd come to
[1:01:48] church I might as well be honest you
[1:01:50] know confession is good for the soul
[1:01:53] amen you know and we go to church and
[1:01:56] you know I I've been raised in church
[1:01:57] all my life but how many times I sat on

[1:02:02] Pew knowing I wasn't living right but I
[1:02:05] would wear my jacket just
[1:02:06] right you
[1:02:08] know and I'm saying this to say that so
[1:02:12] many times we use our religion as a
[1:02:16] covering brother brandham taught that
[1:02:18] religion is just a
[1:02:21] covering and so many times we sit there
[1:02:24] and just
[1:02:26] pretend like everything's okay but we
[1:02:27] know deep down inside we got something
[1:02:32] wrong and we're scared about admitting
[1:02:37] it because we're worried what people
[1:02:40] might
[1:02:41] think we're worried what God would think
[1:02:44] but I'll tell you one thing God won't
[1:02:48] beat you over the head he loves you
[1:02:53] amen if you would be honest with God God
[1:02:57] and show
[1:02:58] him how honest you are by telling him
[1:03:01] what's wrong he already knows what's
[1:03:04] wrong so it's not any surprise to God
[1:03:06] Amen he just wants you to admit it
[1:03:10] amen that's when pride gets torn down
[1:03:18] amen we need to stop living in fear amen
[1:03:21] amen I'm going to leave you with this
[1:03:23] last scripture and we'll musicians just
[1:03:25] come on

[1:12:45] faithful you know I begin to think
[1:12:48] there's a story I heard one
[1:12:50] time about a young man who was raised in
[1:12:53] a church
[1:12:56] his mom and dad instilled it into him to
[1:12:59] come to church every
[1:13:01] Sunday about the age of 13 He Got
[1:13:04] rebellious it's common for a young man
[1:13:07] get rebellious and not want to go to
[1:13:10] church his dad was a he was in a
[1:13:16] wheelchair couldn't do
[1:13:20] much and this boy he got smart aliy to
[1:13:23] his mom one day said hey I'm not going
[1:13:26] to church she said you need to and he
[1:13:28] says no I'm not I don't want to go I
[1:13:30] don't want nothing to do with
[1:13:33] church so he
[1:13:36] didn't and while the mom and the dad
[1:13:38] went to church together the boy decided
[1:13:41] they lived in a very wintry Place unlike
[1:13:48] here but they lived next to a
[1:13:53] lake and at this Lake it was frozen and
[1:13:56] the boy decided he's going to grab some
[1:13:58] ice skates and he's going to go skate
[1:14:02] alone he goes out on the ice skating
[1:14:07] just letting out the anger that he had
[1:14:08] with his
[1:14:10] mom and in the perial vision of his eyes
[1:14:13] he sees two
[1:14:15] flags that would be shown on the ice if
[1:14:18] the ice is
[1:14:21] thin but by the time he saw the flag
[1:14:25] it was too
[1:14:27] late the boy fell through the
[1:14:31] ice yelling for help and no one's
[1:14:35] around begins to
[1:14:37] drown there happens to be a
[1:14:40] man walking by this Lake you might see
[1:14:44] where I'm going this man hears the faint
[1:14:48] Cry of a young man screaming help me
[1:14:53] help me I'm drowned
[1:14:56] help me I'm hurt help me and he begins
[1:15:01] to
[1:15:02] scream and this man who's walking his
[1:15:05] dog lets his dog who's a rescue dog goes
[1:15:09] and rescues the boy the man balances out
[1:15:13] his weight to get down to the boy on the
[1:15:15] ice pulls the boy out of the ice gets
[1:15:18] him dry takes him home dries him up gets
[1:15:21] him
[1:15:23] warm that boy then would say thank you
[1:15:25] sir for saving
[1:15:28] me and he went on his way years later
[1:15:32] this boy who's still out of church
[1:15:34] shoots a police
[1:15:36] officer kills
[1:15:39] him just because the police officer to
[1:15:41] move his told him to move his vehicle he
