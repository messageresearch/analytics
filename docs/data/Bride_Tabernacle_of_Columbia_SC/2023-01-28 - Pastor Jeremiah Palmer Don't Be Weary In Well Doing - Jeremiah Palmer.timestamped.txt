[20:26] maybe you seated
[20:32] you know I feel like shouting already
[20:37] listening to the song service and
[20:40] listening to this different song and I
[20:43] said Lord
[20:44] I see no this is a great time right now
[20:47] to praise the Lord
[20:51] uh I want to speak to you just in a few
[20:53] minutes this morning excuse that morning
[20:56] I'm already mourning already
[21:00] but I want to speak there on every on
[21:01] don't be weary
[21:04] in well-doing
[21:07] don't be weary
[21:10] in well doing the word weary it means to
[21:14] be exhausted
[21:17] uh you know low in strength your patient
[21:21] gets short
[21:23] and I believe that all of us at some
[21:27] times in our life we
[21:29] get a little weary
[21:32] I believe the Bible said one place that
[21:35] sends the Lord delayed his coming all
[21:38] thing continue as they were
[21:42] you know the words since the Lord hasn't
[21:45] come when people thought he should
[21:49] they begin to get a little weary about
[21:51] the journey
[21:53] some even decide that what's the use
[21:58] because we've been hearing the Lord is
[22:00] coming the Lord is coming
[22:02] for a long long long time
[22:07] but I still want to tell you he's on his
[22:10] way
[22:12] even so more
[22:15] now than it was back then
[22:20] I've reminded and hearing Paul and the
[22:25] different uh prophets and uh the
[22:28] ministers in the Bible they were
[22:31] speaking
[22:33] a lot of things concerning the end time
[22:37] talking about the great trouble and
[22:40] uh matter of fact let's go to one place
[22:43] there and I want to get this sin so
[22:45] badly I can't understand it second
[22:48] Corinthians and we're going to come back
[22:50] come in second Corinthians
[22:53] just a little peace we're not going to
[22:55] get all is that what I want though
[22:58] so much it's second Corinthians I said I
[23:02] believe is full
[23:07] um
[23:15] yes second Corinthians 4 and 8 there's
[23:18] two or three verses there
[23:20] Paul here
[23:23] was saying we are troubled
[23:26] on every side
[23:28] yet not distressed
[23:32] we are perplexed
[23:34] but not in despair
[23:37] persecuted
[23:39] but not forsaken
[23:41] cast down
[23:44] oh my but not destroyed
[23:47] always bearing about
[23:50] in the body of the dying of the Lord
[23:53] Jesus Christ
[23:55] that the life also of Jesus Christ might
[23:59] be made manifested in our body
[24:03] we are facing trouble sometimes
[24:08] I like the way Paul put it he said we uh
[24:11] cast down but not destroyed
[24:16] another place Paul said in Romans 8 he
[24:19] says who shall separate us
[24:24] from the love of Christ
[24:27] you see a shield Trouse your tribulation
[24:30] he said they eat all these things we are
[24:34] more than conquerors
[24:37] I want to tell you tonight don't be
[24:39] weary
[24:41] in well-doing
[24:44] I know right look wrong and wrong look
[24:47] right but don't be weary
[24:51] something is about to happen
[24:56] I want to encourage you tonight all that
[25:01] you going through don't be weary
[25:05] Shake Yourself
[25:08] don't let nothing take your focus upon
[25:12] Jesus Christ
[25:15] I don't care what happens I don't care
[25:17] what comes I don't care where to go be
[25:20] still
[25:22] don't move hastily
[25:27] be sober be diligent
[25:30] wake I say on the Lord
[25:33] don't be in a hurry to move now
[25:37] soon as you'll be in a hurry that's when
[25:40] you mess up but if you can be still
[25:44] oh my my it's hard to get people to be
[25:48] still when they are troubled
[25:50] it's hard to get them to be still when
[25:53] they get a little wisdom but Church
[25:55] let's be still tonight
[26:00] oh my I like that so let's see he could
[26:04] have Let Me Drown
[26:06] oh so many times and a lot of us a lot
[26:10] of time thought we were going to drown
[26:13] oh but God came and he picked you up
[26:19] when you can even pick your own self up
[26:23] oh I like that
[26:25] I like it you know when he picked me up
[26:29] because then we rely more upon him and
[26:33] less of us
[26:39] you know I say the best time to have a
[26:42] Revival right in the midst of the storm
[26:44] brother
[26:46] I'll be the service God said in the
[26:49] darkest hour that's when the
[26:51] supernatural take place when everything
[26:53] is all tore up when people's minds are
[26:56] all on this and that our mind is on
[26:59] Jesus Christ
[27:01] I'm not gonna move to the left I'm not
[27:04] going to move to the right I'm going to
[27:06] work it right in the middle of the road
[27:09] Lord Keep Me in the word
[27:13] oh come on it ain't no time to leave the
[27:15] word now it's time to get anchored in
[27:18] the word
[27:20] Come On My Mind Is Made Up brother
[27:24] regardless of who or what or this or
[27:28] that one thing I know Jesus is mine
[27:33] oh my
[27:35] God mine mine mine brother Gardner Jesus
[27:40] Is Mine
[27:42] oh wow
[27:45] I feel good
[27:48] I'm telling you
[27:49] I know we all are suffering
[27:53] we're dealing with some
[27:55] hardships
[27:57] things beyond our control
[28:02] things that
[28:04] we didn't expect
[28:06] but I want to tell you God's still in
[28:08] control
[28:12] God's still in control of everything
[28:16] he knows exactly
[28:18] when you know how he knew what
[28:22] but then God got a season
[28:25] see there's a season
[28:28] I believe that you know the church a lot
[28:31] of time had got in such a comfortable
[28:34] Zone
[28:36] but God now is pulling those soft
[28:39] cushions
[28:41] come on those soft days and they don't
[28:44] relax times
[28:46] now it's desperation
[28:49] in desperation always bring God on the
[28:53] scene
[28:54] when the church get desperate for God
[28:58] and not looking to this other dad but
[29:01] I'm looking for you Lord
[29:03] that's how we ought to be we come to
[29:06] church don't come to church to spectate
[29:08] don't come to church to look around come
[29:11] looking for Jesus
[29:13] that's what we need
[29:16] um
[29:18] oh my
[29:22] Paul sound persuaded
[29:25] I wonder you persuaded today
[29:29] yes
[29:31] trouble
[29:33] perplexed
[29:35] distress
[29:37] but yet not destroyed
[29:40] let me read another scripture
[29:44] The Book of Psalms
[29:46] please
[29:54] I believe it's 37 I won't
[30:03] so many times
[30:06] when things begin to
[30:09] arise
[30:11] in our life and I'm learning this
[30:16] the worst time is to try to move away
[30:18] from God when things are not going like
[30:20] they ought
[30:24] the best thing to do then stay at
[30:26] brother children say I'm going to stay
[30:28] under the blood
[30:31] because under the blood is your
[30:33] protection
[30:36] if you go anyplace else you're leaving
[30:38] your protection
[30:40] it seems that I know by now that we
[30:44] ought to be a little more understanding
[30:46] the things of God that you know God
[30:49] ain't never in a hurry
[30:53] if you remember the story of those
[30:55] Hebrew boys
[30:56] God sat right there
[30:59] and watched them go into the fire
[31:04] you come from the beginning yes he could
[31:07] but he stood there and he looked he said
[31:12] now
[31:12] I got something in them I I know what
[31:15] they're going to do
[31:17] and they ain't gonna deny me regardless
[31:20] of what the Kings the crazy
[31:24] and he sit there and see God is a god of
[31:26] action
[31:28] God sat there looking
[31:31] on his people
[31:34] put them in a position that they had to
[31:38] make a choice come on somebody
[31:40] God would allow you to have to make some
[31:43] decisions and some choices brother Caleb
[31:48] to see where you really Act
[31:52] can you say I love you Jesus in the
[31:56] midst of what you're going through
[31:59] come on it's easy to praise God when
[32:02] things are good but how about we think
[32:05] you're real alone
[32:06] come on to God on the mountain in the
[32:09] garden of Valley you got to have the
[32:12] violence to be able to join the
[32:14] mountaintops
[32:16] no Valley no Mountaintop
[32:19] no child no Crown no suffering no
[32:24] Victory you got to be an overcoming in
[32:27] this hour
[32:29] oh
[32:31] whoa
[32:34] Lord have mercy
[32:37] I wish we had some real praises
[32:40] that can praise God even when they're
[32:42] going through
[32:45] come on ain't no time to be solid
[32:48] I believe a lot of times if we start
[32:50] praising God in the midst of it
[32:53] or what you're going through there the
[32:55] blessings that come down
[32:57] come on without weeping and it's looking
[33:00] sad we know who we believe
[33:03] we know that our God
[33:11] the real
[33:15] you got to be real to you
[33:18] you have to know God to be real
[33:20] not what nobody else say
[33:23] not what you're reading a book
[33:25] no matter what you hear on the tapes
[33:27] that same God got to be real to you
[33:30] personally
[33:32] every one of them got to have our own
[33:35] visitation
[33:37] your own experience that you can say
[33:41] that I know my redeemer
[33:45] do he lives
[33:49] you have to know that
[33:51] doesn't live with you
[33:53] can you call on them

[36:55] take that and make it a blessing
[37:00] to a true child of God
[37:03] a lot of times most of our mistakes that
[37:05] one brought us to God anyhow
[37:09] and God let you went down wrong Avenue
[37:14] and let you see you ain't nothing but a
[37:16] failure and that you can't live without

[37:33] God is the one that protected us even
[37:37] when you will gave up on God said I'm

[39:53] come on it's going to take a press
[39:56] in this hour like never
[39:59] it's gonna take more
[40:02] of us really pressing their brother
[40:05] pressing my way through
[40:07] through every obstacle
[40:10] though you may can't see your way out
[40:12] I'll be there to someone promotions
[40:14] saying that Jesus is a Waymaker
[40:17] come on way maker come on promise keeper
[40:22] we did what are you worried about
[40:24] he's a Waymaker when there isn't no way
[40:28] God Will Make A Way did not God open up
[40:32] the Red Sea
[40:34] who did it
[40:36] they couldn't go wrong undid or over it
[40:39] but God said now I'm going to show you
[40:41] what I can do he parted
[40:46] the Red Sea
[40:48] and they walked through on the waters
[40:51] was right there on the east side they
[40:53] could have probably feel it
[40:56] God will show them see what I can do
[41:00] I'm a miracle worker
[41:02] allow you to walk on dry ground in your
[41:06] enemies he destroyed them
[41:09] with the very water he had parted
[41:12] and that's how God will do your enemies
[41:15] come on a very enemy that's trying to
[41:18] hinder you oh don't let nothing in there
[41:21] Paul said he said you did run wild but
[41:25] what hinder yeah
[41:27] What stopped you from praying What
[41:31] stopped you from seeking God what
[41:33] hindered you from giving God all your
[41:35] praise
[41:38] oh my
[41:40] if I was taking all the bait I said you
[41:42] know we don't give God oh the praise he
[41:45] deserves
[41:49] we don't give God all the prayer we so
[41:51] we ought to praise Him higher
[41:54] higher
[41:56] the heart of the child Praise Him higher
[42:00] we ought to worship God with all of our
[42:04] heart
[42:05] oh my that's the kind of people
[42:09] that understand and have a revelation
[42:12] what they came here to do
[42:16] nothing Paul said what yahusha separate
[42:20] us
[42:22] nothing
[42:24] he said in all these things
[42:27] I want to say in all that you're going
[42:29] through you are more than conquerors
[42:34] disgrace trouble yes but not destroyed
[42:39] we've been knocked out but we got up
[42:42] we may have failed but I want to tell
[42:45] you it wasn't over yet
[42:49] you must have them kind of experiences
[42:52] in order to really appreciate what God
[42:56] is able to do
[42:58] let me tell you something there ain't
[43:00] nobody
[43:02] under the Earth on Earth can do you like
[43:05] Jesus can
[43:07] I don't care how good he is how much
[43:09] they say they love you they can't do
[43:11] what Jesus can for you
[43:15] too many times and God let us
[43:18] let people fail you
[43:21] let them feel you
[43:23] because sometimes we have too much of
[43:25] people we lean on
[43:29] and God said I want you to lead on me
[43:32] I want you to trust me even when you
[43:35] can't trust nobody else
[43:38] you can I will not forsake you
[43:42] there is the one police that God had
[43:44] forsook
[43:45] you and I may have been in some
[43:47] situation we've been in some condition
[43:50] that was very difficult
[43:54] even now and you know in this life it
[43:58] seemed like things keep on happening
[44:01] one after the other
[44:03] and we wonder sometimes Lord I'm tired
[44:07] and we get a little weak in the party
[44:10] that's when you got to go and pray up
[44:14] you got to get along somewhere and say
[44:16] God here I am
[44:18] Lord if there's nothing I can trust on
[44:21] nobody I can go to God that can give me
[44:24] what I need yeah let me tell you well I
[44:26] I understand no no no you really don't
[44:29] you understand physically but God
[44:33] understands everything there is about
[44:35] you
[44:37] he knows your weakness but in your
[44:40] weakness then you remain strong
[44:44] your mind just say that to change the
[44:46] strong man is the weakest link
[44:49] you're more stronger
[44:51] when you're weak
[44:55] it don't sound like that that's writing
[44:57] that ain't proper English sound like
[44:59] stronger when you're weak
[45:01] everybody I feel I can do it you got all
[45:05] the ability you got all the screen you
[45:07] got all the muscle physically
[45:10] but you can't fight one devil
[45:14] or for you
[45:16] you can't bring your own Deliverance
[45:18] even if you wanna
[45:20] the joy
[45:22] and what you were looking for inside of
[45:25] you
[45:26] you can do all this other thing and get
[45:28] this and get that and guess what you're
[45:30] still miserable
[45:32] but when you get something inside of you
[45:36] it will satisfy
[45:39] everything you ever need
[45:43] that's the problem with most people they
[45:45] try to satisfy a spiritual thirst for
[45:48] God with a a natural things
[45:51] it'll never take the place
[45:54] got people who was David said that my
[45:57] soul
[45:59] my soul thirsts after who
[46:02] see not materialistic things
[46:06] those things are temporal
[46:09] but you need an everlasting Joy
[46:12] you need something going to give you Joy
[46:15] even when you feel bad
[46:18] come on anyone that don't know what to
[46:20] do you can have some real consolation
[46:25] oh my
[46:26] I'm not going to read that script to you
[46:28] I'm going to read one
[46:30] place here I'm gonna turn over to Pastor
[46:34] server to God he was seen
[46:37] you know I I I read things and I hear
[46:42] server called speaking things and you
[46:45] know we have this uh little I say they
[46:48] call it a saying
[46:50] you know around this message of the
[46:52] album nothing wrong with it but to me I
[46:54] want to be more than just a sing
[46:57] and they always want to tell us you know
[46:58] say what the prophet said
[47:02] but I want more than just to say what he
[47:04] said I want to see God make that real
[47:08] you know what I want to see the
[47:10] manifestation brother
[47:13] not just what somebody said but God if
[47:16] that word isn't me manifest in our life
[47:20] you can say what he say all you like
[47:23] but what we need is something that takes
[47:26] place
[47:27] something to Quicken
[47:30] that word and make it live
[47:34] that it won't be just things sad brother
[47:37] but it'll be a demonstration of what was
[47:41] said
[47:42] and only the Holy Ghost can do that
[47:47] so if we're going to say don't be weary
[47:52] in well-doing
[47:54] for you will certainly reap
[47:57] in due season
[48:00] if you think not always he said always
[48:04] not sometime
[48:06] always do that which is right
[48:12] it's hard to do right when wrong going
[48:15] on see
[48:17] it's easy to get off
[48:20] but he said always do that which is
[48:23] right
[48:26] even if somebody else do wrong you do
[48:30] right
[48:33] that's like a sacrifice
[48:35] because sometimes you take Rome for
[48:39] right
[48:40] it is all right Jesus did that
[48:45] but will it probably we don't want to
[48:47] take nothing
[48:49] you have to learn that take something
[48:52] if you ain't willing to take you won't
[48:55] be able to appreciate
[48:59] a Christian Life is a suffering
[49:03] it's a sacrifice
[49:06] giving up your right
[49:09] for God right
[49:12] um
[49:13] that's where the people of God fail that
[49:17] God have to teach us
[49:20] and God has been teaching how he teaches
[49:23] through the things that you suffer
[49:27] through the thing that you go through in
[49:29] your daily life and it seems to be all
[49:31] that we have to deal with this let me
[49:33] tell you something there's a lesson in
[49:35] it
[49:37] that God is trying to get you to a place
[49:40] that you're gonna take something
[49:43] and go ahead and take it because see
[49:45] whatever you you you're the soul you're
[49:48] gonna reap
[49:50] he said always
[49:52] always
[49:54] always do that which is right
[49:58] and whatever
[50:00] that God has said in his book The Bible
[50:04] you believe that
[50:07] for you can hang your soul on any phase
[50:11] of the word of God
[50:16] now whatever he has promised
[50:20] in the word
[50:22] God will do
[50:25] but he is under obligation
[50:28] come on somebody
[50:30] stay with the word
[50:32] I said stay with the word
[50:36] don't be wearing well doing
[50:40] when things get rough and things get
[50:43] tough
[50:44] praise the Lord anyhow
[50:47] don't say come on uh don't let your
[50:50] problems get you down he said lift your
[50:53] head high and safe hey man praise God
[50:56] anyhow

[51:01] through circumstances through
[51:04] difficulties through even when you're
[51:06] sick through whatever it is I'm gonna
[51:09] praise God anyhow
