[31:44] another year amen by God's grace and but
[31:49] we all know
[31:51] that it's going to take
[31:54] more pressing
[31:58] now than ever before
[32:01] amen I want to title this just for a few
[32:05] minutes making your
[32:08] calling and your election
[32:13] sure and as I
[32:16] was
[32:19] thinking about the things that each and
[32:23] every one of us
[32:25] do from day to day
[32:29] not so much in the natural sense but
[32:31] that's okay to but I'm talking about the
[32:34] spiritual
[32:37] things seeing
[32:40] that we are the people of God that is
[32:44] seeing the closing of the
[32:49] hours seeing modern events made
[32:52] clear by prophecy
[32:58] seeing the warning sign the Judgment
[33:03] signs everything seemed to be pointing
[33:07] toward it's
[33:12] over and sometimes I wonder as
[33:15] Christians
[33:18] especially for those of us that have
[33:20] heard what God is doing in this hour and
[33:24] what God has already spoken that will
[33:27] take
[33:29] place I believe it ought to make us
[33:32] pinch
[33:36] ourselves and wake
[33:39] up that it's a serious
[33:44] time we don't know it could be over in
[33:48] the
[33:52] morning some of us had asked ourself
[33:54] what am I doing
[34:00] how is my Christian walk with God I'm
[34:04] talking about each individual
[34:07] now I'm was telling the church man
[34:09] there's no need for us looking around at
[34:11] the neighbor or the church down the road
[34:13] or dis know let's look at each and
[34:16] personally our own
[34:19] selves the Bible say examine your own
[34:22] self right so every one of us need a
[34:25] spiritual examination
[34:29] you need to know where you
[34:32] stand you need to know if God called you
[34:35] to the Salvation of the
[34:38] Gospel then that it comes
[34:42] with a
[34:46] sacrifice I was telling one brother I
[34:48] said I just don't believe that we have
[34:51] the time to be wondering around doing
[34:54] this and doing that we got to be sure
[34:56] not what we doing brother s
[34:59] time pass we did this and this and this
[35:01] and Tred to do this and this but now we
[35:05] want to be have some type of vision or
[35:08] uh
[35:09] inspiration what we are doing and
[35:16] why we are not looking for great
[35:19] [Music]
[35:22] members we're looking for God elect amen
[35:28] God chosen his
[35:31] seed and if you notice it's a very real
[35:34] thing now to see people come to the
[35:37] Gospel of Jesus
[35:40] Christ we don't see very many that come
[35:43] to accept Jesus Christ as their personal
[35:47] savior we're gleaning the
[35:51] fields one here and one
[35:55] there but for those of us who
[35:59] have heard that voice of God and you
[36:03] know that it was God that called
[36:07] you and I never want to overemphasize
[36:10] that because it has to be something
[36:14] direct true amen I can't live on what
[36:18] somebody tell
[36:20] me though that might be
[36:23] okay but I got to hear God's voice for
[36:26] myself
[36:28] amen even the young people even the
[36:30] children there has to be something that
[36:33] is drawing you am not your sisters not
[36:37] your aunties or your brothers it has to
[36:40] be something that is drawing you to get
[36:44] yourself right with God and brother fed
[36:47] said get right get right get right with
[36:50] God and do it when yes right
[36:55] now we have no time to wait
[36:59] you have no time to look to 20 years and
[37:03] and this happened and that happened
[37:06] because it could be over in just a
[37:09] twinkling of an eye for some of
[37:12] us well we at any time pieace of
[37:18] God everything is
[37:22] pointing to a nuclear bomb
[37:27] California and different places having
[37:31] earthquakes the
[37:34] fires
[37:39] disasters everything seem to be getting
[37:42] worse and
[37:45] worse but I believe that our Christian
[37:49] Life ought to be getting a little more
[37:53] sincere true amen your walk with God
[37:57] ought to be ought to mean more to you
[37:59] even than your career
[38:03] amen your career can only help you here
[38:07] on this Earth and not with that that
[38:10] don't even
[38:13] last but we don't know what to expect
[38:16] what's coming but one thing we know that
[38:18] is coming God is coming
[38:22] amen you're not going to have time to
[38:24] get the Holy Ghost later
[38:27] get it now
[38:29] amen if nobody else don't want it you
[38:34] seek God for it amen and if you got it
[38:37] you're going to need more am amen we can
[38:41] never have
[38:43] enough I believe what we need we need a
[38:45] refilling amen
[38:48] amen we need another touch from God in
[38:51] our lives
[38:53] am we need something as the Church of
[38:56] God that's going to set our souls on
[39:00] fire again
[39:03] amen what we need I've been thinking
[39:05] about I said we we need a re a a
[39:08] spiritual Reviving amen
[39:12] amen something to connect us back to God
[39:16] that we won't be looking around for God
[39:19] over here and over there you will know
[39:21] he's within you
[39:25] amen a lot of was I was the H I was
[39:30] telling them down there I said we we
[39:32] always I was that Brother Anderson last
[39:34] week I believe and I was saying that you
[39:36] know we we be waiting for minister to
[39:40] come abroad to speak certain things to
[39:43] us but you shouldn't have to have
[39:47] that cuz God has spoken to us in these
[39:52] days the The searchable Riches of Christ
[39:55] he have uh let us know what we are up
[39:59] against he let us know that a 200,000
[40:03] demons have been let loose out of the
[40:05] river Euphrates to come against
[40:10] us you're going to need a prayer
[40:14] life I'm not talking about these five
[40:16] minutes and 10 minutes you going to need
[40:18] to spend some time with
[40:20] God all of we need to spend more time
[40:25] amen prayer ought to become
[40:32] breakast there used to be a time brother
[40:34] SED door stayed
[40:37] open for
[40:41] prayer now it's hard to get the people
[40:44] to come to those
[40:46] things but that was really the very
[40:49] Foundation of where we at
[40:54] today I heard the servant of God said he
[40:56] said the very Secrets behind the opening
[40:59] of the seals he said it because of
[41:05] prayer what's the secret be behind our
[41:09] life being illuminated with God is
[41:15] prayer you can study you can remember
[41:18] you can recite and all that's all right
[41:22] but without a prayer life without a
[41:25] communication that shows so begin to
[41:27] just pour out on the altar of God until
[41:31] God come and do something am amen and I
[41:34] ain't just talking about a thrill or a
[41:36] little uh a chill bump but I'm talking
[41:39] about some fire amen
[41:45] amen the way we can die to our own self
[41:48] daily amen that nothing else matters
[41:52] more to you but getting a hold of God
[41:54] amen amen
[41:57] the time that we don't spend anymore
[42:00] listening and reading our Bibles and
[42:03] consecrating our
[42:07] lives getting spiritual breakthrough
[42:10] because of these conditions that we got
[42:14] going on in our body in our
[42:16] homes in our
[42:22] churches Lord help us
[42:27] to get back to the old
[42:32] Landmark let me just read something I
[42:35] looked up something
[42:37] and and it said that making a calling in
[42:40] your election sure he said it means to
[42:43] confirm that God has
[42:46] called and chosen you and this the part
[42:49] I like and to live in a way that
[42:53] reflects
[42:55] that see
[42:57] to live in a way that reflects your
[43:02] calling and your election we we are not
[43:05] just church
[43:10] gos that's why we not part of
[43:13] denomination because God has called us
[43:16] to a higher calling than just coming to
[43:19] church amen
[43:22] amen there has been too long of a
[43:25] program with the whole church CH World
[43:28] they know how to go to church but they
[43:30] don't get in contact with
[43:37] God and then when they do get in contact
[43:40] with God we allow the devil to come in
[43:42] and
[43:44] steal the joy of our
[43:51] Salvation oh I I'm
[43:55] understanding little by little perfect
[43:57] God say how that we ought to be the most
[44:00] happiest
[44:02] people on the face of the Earth
[44:06] why because when you have a full
[44:09] understanding what Calvary and what he
[44:12] did for
[44:13] you amen as an
[44:16] individual as those sister say it'll
[44:19] make you
[44:20] shout amen but it becomes personal that
[44:25] he died for me and me
[44:27] alone
[44:30] amen and he chose you above everybody
[44:35] else not that you were better not what
[44:38] you were something speci but it was God
[44:41] before the foundation of the world had
[44:45] already amen chosen you amen that's why
[44:50] you could come to the word cuz you
[44:53] already a part of him though we didn't
[44:56] know it
[44:58] it but then that great connection
[45:03] came God came and found us where were we
[45:08] didn't went looking for
[45:12] him I just care how to get away
[45:16] from how God will go to the lowest the
[45:20] lowest to get one of his
[45:23] amen thank you Jesus there are no
[45:27] boundaries thank you
[45:30] Lord there are no
[45:33] limits no place where God won't go to
[45:38] get his elect amen amen a lot of people
[45:42] like the say they're talking to people
[45:43] and witness to them you know they have
[45:45] this consultion and you probably heard
[45:47] it too that I come to God when I get
[45:50] ready not
[45:55] so and let Le God have called you for it
[46:00] that's true amen and be yes Bible say
[46:02] yeah many are called but only a few are
[46:06] chosen the gospel of Salvation is for
[46:09] all amen but God already know who is
[46:14] going to accept
[46:17] that but being just he has to make it
[46:20] for everybody Amen to give you an
[46:24] opportunity so you want to say well God
[46:26] didn't give me a a
[46:27] chance oh no nobody won't have that
