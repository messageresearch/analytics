[31:39] and it
[31:46] reads and it reads and Saul yet
[31:49] breathing out threatening and Slaughter
[31:51] against the Disciples of the Lord went
[31:53] unto the high priest and desired of him
[31:56] letter us to Damascus to the
[32:04] synagogue that if he found any of this
[32:07] way whether they were men or women and
[32:10] he might bring them bound to Jerusalem
[32:12] and as he journeyed he came near
[32:14] Damascus and suddenly there Shine from
[32:17] Heaven round about him a light from
[32:18] heaven and he fell in to the Earth and
[32:22] heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul
[32:25] why persecutest thou me and and he said
[32:27] who art thou
[32:29] Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom
[32:32] thou persecutest and if it and it and it
[32:36] is hard for thee to kick against the
[32:38] prick and he trembled astonished and
[32:40] said Lord what would thou have me to do
[32:43] and the Lord said unto him arise and go
[32:45] into the City and it shall be told thee
[32:48] what thou must do
[32:50] amen may God bless the reading those
[32:52] word you may be
[32:56] seated
[32:59] amen this morning I'd like to speak on a
[33:01] small of the topic that I entitled a
[33:04] finished work or a complete work amen
[33:07] and I looked at the I looked at the
[33:09] scripture with Paul and I wanted to come
[33:11] down a little bit further um in verse 17
[33:15] and it
[33:16] says and ananas went his way and entered
[33:19] into the house and put his hands on him
[33:22] saying brother Saul the Lord even Jesus
[33:25] that appeared unto thee in the way that
[33:28] thou camest has sent me that thou
[33:30] mightest receive thy sight and be filled
[33:33] with the Holy Ghost and immediately
[33:35] there fell from his eyes as it had been
[33:37] scales and he received sight forth with
[33:40] and arose and was baptized and when he
[33:42] had received meat he was strengthened
[33:44] then was saw certain days with the
[33:47] disciples that were at Damascus and
[33:49] straight way he preached Christ in the
[33:51] synagogues that he is the Son of God but
[33:55] all that heard him were amazed and and
[33:57] said is not this he that destroyed them
[34:00] which called on this name in Jerusalem
[34:04] it came hither for the intent that he
[34:06] might bring them bound unto the chief
[34:08] priest but Saul increased the more in
[34:11] strength and confounded the Jews which
[34:13] dwelt in Damascus proving that this is
[34:16] very Christ amen and I was looking at
[34:19] the story of Saul this morning now and I
[34:22] like I said I entitled it a complete
[34:25] work and I said when saw when he met
[34:28] Jesus on the road to Damascus his life
[34:31] changed it was a change from night and
[34:33] like night and day to even they said
[34:36] when in verse 21 they said that when the
[34:38] people heard him they were amazed they
[34:41] were astonished at what God had done in
[34:43] his life they were astonished at the
[34:45] transformation that had happened in his
[34:47] life and see they they understood that
[34:50] something was different but some didn't
[34:52] want to believe it they didn't want to
[34:54] see it they didn't want to believe it
[34:56] because because they couldn't believe of
[34:58] what had happened they went from one day
[35:01] seeing a man go out and kill people
[35:03] because they professed the name of Jesus
[35:05] they seen one day a man go out and he
[35:08] reached out and he was going against
[35:10] these people and yet he turns around and
[35:12] a few weeks later is preaching the same
[35:14] thing and they said how can this be but
[35:17] they didn't understand that he had had a
[35:19] visitation with Jesus he had met Jesus
[35:22] along the way and his life was changed
[35:26] and see God had done a complete work in
[35:28] his life he had done a completed work
[35:31] that when people looked at him they knew
[35:33] it was nothing but God it was nothing
[35:35] but him that had come down and changed
[35:38] his life had changed his life for the
[35:39] better had done a complete work in his
[35:41] life and Saul was just he was what it
[35:44] was such a complete word that God
[35:46] changed his name he said I can't call
[35:49] you by what you used to be he said I got
[35:51] to change your name I got to give you a
[35:53] new name he had to give him a new name
[35:55] because he had a work for him to do he
[35:58] had something that he wanted Paul to do
[36:00] he had something that Paul had and no
[36:02] matter what his life looked like before
[36:04] God had changed his life God had done a
[36:07] complete reworking of his life and made
[36:09] him into who he wanted him to
[36:11] be and I was reading something and I
[36:14] said but and it says but the thing of it
[36:17] is is having nothing that you can depend
[36:19] on in your own self or anything that you
[36:22] can do just a complete total surrender
[36:25] of your weakness is unto God and say
[36:29] here am I have nothing or or no ability
[36:32] that you can trust in see God wants you
[36:35] to come to him and say Lord I I can't do
[36:38] nothing all that I have learned all that
[36:40] I have attained is nothing Lord I want
[36:43] you to do a complete work in my life
[36:46] that Lord my life every day when I live
[36:48] every day when I wake up every day when
[36:50] I go around those that are around me
[36:52] they can testify and prove that you are
[36:54] God it can prove that you you are the
[36:57] one that can change things Lord you they
[36:59] may have seen me yesterday but that's
[37:01] not today they may have seen me last
[37:04] night but that's not today cuz God can
[37:06] do a complete work in my life and make
[37:08] sure that everything that I do can
[37:10] testify of him see Paul had that
[37:13] testimony he said I've been to the best
[37:15] of the best I've learned under the best
[37:17] of the best but I count it all not I
[37:20] count it as nothing that I have done
[37:22] because I have not attained anything
[37:24] it's only because of the grace of God
[37:26] and the mercy of God on my life that I
[37:29] can even sit here and testify that God
[37:31] is good and said God said that he wanted
[37:34] to be a savior but he had to let some
[37:36] people be lost he had to give you the
[37:39] opportunity to choose him and today we
[37:42] all had the opportunity to choose him
[37:45] and say Lord I want you to do a complete
[37:47] work in my life I want you to do a work
[37:50] and finish this work in my life and I
[37:53] was looking back through the scripture
[37:55] and I was thinking about many many
[37:58] stories that I that I want to point to
[38:00] and just for a short time this morning
[38:02] and ask if you turn in your Bible to 1
[38:06] Samuel 1st Samuel chapter
[38:09] 17 I thought of a very familiar
[38:12] scripture and you may you may know it
[38:13] and you may have read it many times but
[38:16] I want to look at the latter part of the
[38:17] scripture said there was a man in 1
[38:20] Samuel and his name was David and David
[38:23] he had went out and David was a little
[38:25] little Ruddy boy they said and he had
[38:28] went out and he was a sheep herder and
[38:30] nobody looked at David as anything
[38:32] special the only one that knew that he
[38:35] was special was God he knew that what
[38:37] was in him was going to come out one day
[38:40] but he had to go into the sheep field to
[38:42] learn the lessons that God was going to
[38:44] prepare him for and then you looked at
[38:46] the story and David killed a lion and he
[38:49] killed the bear and God was building up
[38:51] a testimony God was doing a work in
[38:54] David's life God was doing a special
[38:56] work in his life but when David came and
[38:59] he came into he had a test one day he
[39:02] went to his brothers his brothers was
[39:04] fighting was fighting the enemy and the
[39:06] enemy had a champion and the champion's
[39:09] name was Goliath and Goliath was bigger
[39:12] than everybody stronger than everybody
[39:14] and was a Warrior from his Youth and
[39:17] nobody wanted to fight Goliath cuz they
[39:20] thought for sure that they will get
[39:21] killed and sometimes if you are afraid
[39:24] of your enemy you will be destroyed
[39:27] if you are afraid of what's coming
[39:28] against you you will lose that fight not
[39:31] because you're not able and God's not
[39:32] able to do it it's because you're afraid
[39:35] that he won't do it you have doubt in
[39:37] your heart but you got to come with
[39:38] faith but when there was nobody in that
[39:40] camp that had faith that they could
[39:42] defeat the Goliath but one day David he
[39:45] came and he brought some supplies to his
[39:47] brothers and he came out of there and he
[39:49] he realized he he heard Goliath
[39:53] boasting in front of them and basically
[39:56] like y' y'all don't have nobody that can
[39:57] fight me y'all just weak to paraphrase
[40:00] it y'all ain't got nobody and so he came
[40:03] he came and David heard him and it's
[40:05] like what are y'all doing he he looked
[40:08] at his brother like what are y'all doing
[40:10] isn't this the same God that brought us
[40:12] out of Egypt isn't this the same God
[40:14] that delivered Jericho to us isn't this
[40:17] the same God that did so many wonderful
[40:20] things before us and we can't trust him
[40:22] to defeat this enemy see David had seen
[40:25] that God can deliver him from a bear
[40:28] David has seen that God can deliver him
[40:30] from the a lion and David said what is
[40:33] this this is nothing there's nothing too
[40:35] big for my God there's nothing that God
[40:38] can't do for me because he has seen God
[40:40] work he has seen God do these things and
[40:43] David heard heard this Goliath he said
[40:46] man I'm not afraid I'm not afraid to
[40:49] attack this go this Goliath and when and
[40:52] David
[40:53] said and said and David he went out out
[40:56] and he went to Saul and Saul was like
[40:59] well if you want to go fight him let's
[41:00] protect you let's put you on some armor
[41:03] let's put you on but David realized what
[41:05] they were putting on wasn't what he used
[41:07] to fight the enemy he he realized this
[41:10] this just going to weigh me down this
[41:12] ain't helping me cuz this ain't how God
[41:14] delivered me before he realized that God
[41:17] ain't have to use all this to deliver me
[41:20] God didn't have to use armor and
[41:21] protection to deliver me he just wanted
[41:23] me to walk out on faith he just wanted
[41:26] me to go out and trust him and say God
[41:28] you're the same God that can deliver me
[41:30] before you'll deliver me
[41:32] again and David he got out there and he
[41:35] went to he went to he went out there and
[41:37] he grabbed his five stones out of the
[41:39] brook and he he got out there and in
[41:42] verse 41 and it reads and the Philistine
[41:45] came on and Drew near unto
[41:48] David and the man that bear The Shield
[41:51] went before him and I I just explained
[41:54] that there there David Goliath was so
[41:57] big that he had someone to carry his
[42:00] shield for him he was so big that he The
[42:03] Shield was so big that he had someone
[42:05] else to carry it for him in verse 42 and
[42:08] when the Philistine looked about and saw
[42:10] David he disdained him and for he was
[42:14] but a youth and Ruddy and of a fair
[42:17] countenance and the Philistine said unto
[42:20] David am I a dog that thou comest to me
[42:22] with staves and the Philistine cursed
[42:25] David by his
[42:27] Gods excuse me and the Philistines said
[42:30] unto said to David come to me and I will
[42:33] give thy flesh unto the fouls of the air
[42:36] and to the beasts of the field then
[42:38] David said to the Philistine thou comest
[42:41] to me with the sword and with the spear
[42:44] and with the shield but I come to thee
[42:47] in the name of the Lord of hosts the god
[42:49] of the armies of Israel whom thou Hast
[42:52] defied see David wasn't worried about
[42:54] what goliath believed in
[42:56] he wasn't worried about all the gods
[42:58] that Goliath cursed him out in he wasn't
[43:01] worried about that cuz he said I come in
[43:03] the name of the Lord of hosts he knew
[43:05] the God that he served and he knew what
[43:08] he was capable of
[43:09] doing in verse 46 this day will the Lord
[43:13] deliver thee into mine hand see David
[43:16] didn't even have to fight the battle to
[43:18] know that he was going to have the
[43:19] victory he didn't even have to fight the
[43:21] battle he already knew that God was
[43:23] going to deliver Goliath into his hand
[43:26] and he said and I will smite thee David
[43:29] wasn't worried about anybody else he he
[43:32] was telling Goliath exactly what was
[43:33] going to happen to him because he knew
[43:36] what God can do and and and he said I
[43:39] will smite thee and take thine head from
[43:41] thee and I will give the carcasses of
[43:44] the host of the Philistines this day
[43:46] unto the fouls of the air and to the
[43:48] wild beasts of the earth that all the
[43:50] Earth may know that there is a God in
[43:53] Israel see David had to show them that
[43:56] my God is real I don't know who you
[43:59] believe or who you serve but my God is
[44:01] real and he he was so careful he didn't
[44:05] even tell him what was going to happen
[44:06] to Goliath he told him to all Goliath
[44:08] friends he said all y'all going to die
[44:10] too said I'm going to tell y'all when
[44:13] God does thing he completes it he does
[44:15] an other works in your life he makes
[44:17] sure that he doesn't just destroy the
[44:19] the biggest thing he destroys all the
[44:21] friends that come along with you he
[44:23] destroys everything that comes against
[44:25] you he said that my God is real and God
[44:28] will complete the work and said that and
[44:32] that the all the Earth may know that
[44:34] there is a God in Israel now David could
[44:37] look back at them and said do y'all not
[44:39] trust the god that you serve because the
[44:42] God that I serve can do Mighty things he
[44:46] said there's nothing that can stand in
[44:47] front of
[44:50] him and I'll skip down to verse 48 and
[44:53] it came to pass when the Philistine
[44:55] arose
[44:56] and came and Drew not of David that
[44:58] David hasted and ran towards the army of
[45:01] the to meet the Philistine see David he
[45:04] got going into the battle when the
[45:06] battle started David wasn't even afraid
[45:08] he started running towards this
[45:10] Philistine and verse 49 and David put
[45:13] his hands in his bag and took then of
[45:15] stone and slang it and smoked the
[45:17] Philistine in the forehead that the
[45:19] stone stone sunk into his forehead and
[45:22] he fell upon his face to the
[45:24] Earth so David prevailed over the
[45:27] Philistine with a sling and with a stone
[45:30] and smok the Philistine and slew him but
[45:32] there was no sword in the hand of David
[45:34] David all he had was a stone and a sling
[45:38] and this Philistine had all the armor
[45:40] the newest things the greatest
[45:42] protection that he probably could have
[45:44] because he was a warrior since his Youth
[45:47] and and David all he had was just a
[45:49] sling in a stone and a belief in God
[45:52] that God can do anything that that that
[45:55] that was was more greater than he was
[45:57] able to do David wasn't strong enough he
[46:00] wasn't big enough but one thing David
[46:02] trusted God and he wasn't afraid those
[46:04] were the two things that David
[46:08] had and said in verse 51 therefore David
[46:11] ran and stood upon the Philistine took
[46:14] his sore and Drew it out and cut off and
[46:17] sheath there and slew him and cut off
[46:19] his head there with and when the
[46:21] Philistines saw their Champion was dead
[46:23] they fled see all you to do is trust God
[46:26] to defeat your enemy and when that
[46:29] happens the ones that around you will
[46:31] flee because they just look it up and
[46:33] say as long as he got you we good we
[46:36] good as long as you fighting that we
[46:38] good as long as you working with that
[46:40] but when God comes and he does a
[46:42] complete work all the other ones will
[46:45] flee and 52 and he said and the men of
[46:47] Israel and Judah arose and shouted and
[46:50] pursued the Philistine see the men of
[46:53] Israel had something to shout about now
[46:55] they they had something to give joy
[46:57] about cuz they realized that the god
[46:59] that they sered was still the same God
[47:01] he was still the one that brought them
[47:03] out of egyp he was still the one that
[47:05] raised from the dead he was still the
[47:07] one that can do mightiest work and they
[47:10] shouted and pursued the Philistines till
[47:12] they came into the valley and the gates
[47:14] of eon and the wounded Philistines fled
[47:17] fell down by the way of sharum and even
[47:20] unto G unto
[47:22] Eon see everything that David told
[47:25] Goliath was going to happen happen
[47:28] exactly how he said not because David
[47:31] was great not because David was strong
[47:35] not because David was mighty but because
[47:38] David trusted God David had such a great
[47:41] faith in God that he said I I can speak
[47:44] this and I believe it will be so I can
[47:47] speak this and I believe that my enemy
[47:49] will be defeated I can speak this and I
[47:51] believe that these things will happen
[47:54] just like I say they will because I
[47:56] trust God to do it I trust God that he's
[47:59] the same yesterday today and forever
[48:01] he's the same God that can move
[48:04] mountains he's the same God that when
[48:06] you speak to the sun the sun will stop
[48:09] he's the same God that left the sun to
[48:11] stop so that Joshua could defeat the
[48:13] rest of his enemies he said Lord the Sun
[48:16] is going down I I'm not finished
[48:19] destroying the rest of my enemies cuz
[48:21] God when he does something he does it
[48:23] completely he finishes thing he does
[48:25] just leave it
[48:27] halfway he wants to make sure that you
[48:30] have utterly and total Deliverance over
[48:32] whatever may be in your path and David
[48:35] was just an example of this and I I said
[48:40] that I had another example when I
[48:42] thought about the story of Abraham and I
[48:45] said when God blesses you He blesses you
[48:47] completely as well he doesn't just do it
[48:50] only bless part he doesn't in hold see
[48:53] when God came to Abraham and he a and
[48:56] and he said I'm going to give you a son
[48:58] he he came and he came to Abraham and he
[49:01] said Sarah laughed and I I had one thing
[49:05] that I I wanted to read because it stood
[49:07] out to me in Genesis chapter
[49:14] 22 Genesis chapter
[49:24] 22
[49:35] I think I got the wrong
[49:38] scripture actually Genesis Chapter
[49:43] 18 and chapter 18 and verse
[49:48] 14 verse 13 I'll start in verse 13 and
[49:52] the and and God told Abraham and Sarah
[49:55] they were going to to have a child but
[49:57] Abraham and Sarah they said that we're
[49:58] old and Sarah laughed at the word of the
[50:02] Lord that they were going to have a
[50:03] child because the time had passed for
[50:06] for her and childbearing and the Lord
[50:09] said
[50:10] uh and the Lord said unto Abraham
[50:14] wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I
[50:17] of assurity bear a child which am
[50:20] old and is and verse 14 says and this is
[50:24] what I wanted to point out say is
[50:26] anything too hard for the
[50:29] Lord he asked him is anything too hard
[50:31] for the
[50:33] Lord said at the time appointed I will
[50:36] return unto thee according to the time
[50:38] of life and Sarah shall have a son and
[50:41] see even in verse 15 it shows that then
[50:43] Sarah denied saying I laugh not cuz
[50:46] Sarah was embarrassed because when God
[50:49] says something he does it when God says
[50:52] I'm going to do a thing he's going to do
[50:54] it exactly how he said he was going to
[50:56] do it he said at the time appointed
[50:59] these things shall happen he didn't tell
[51:01] him when exactly it was going to happen
[51:03] but he said it shall happen because he
[51:05] spoke the word so you can hold on to
[51:07] that word and know that God will
[51:09] complete exactly what he said he would
[51:12] do and and it said in verse if any is
[51:16] there anything too hard for the Lord and
[51:19] I'm here this morning to let you know
[51:20] that there's nothing too hard for God
[51:23] there's nothing that he cannot do for
[51:25] for you there's no battle That's too
[51:28] great for him because he's done so many
[51:30] things and he said if you trust in him
[51:33] as the song writer said song writer said
[51:35] if I trust in him and never doubt he
[51:37] will surely bring me out said God is
[51:40] that good and that gracious and that
[51:42] merciful that I can look at him and I
[51:45] can and I said that I think about how
[51:48] that in the beginning God created
[51:50] everything he created everything and
[51:52] when he got done he said this is very
[51:55] good because God knew that he was the
[51:57] only one that could create he's the only
[52:00] one that can do these
[52:02] things you see God did and when he
[52:05] created everything from the very
[52:07] beginning he didn't leave nothing out he
[52:10] didn't Overlook anything he made sure
[52:12] that all things would work in Harmony
[52:15] and when he finished the work he gave
[52:17] man Domin dominion over it see God when
[52:20] he does a thing he does it completely
[52:23] God didn't Overlook anything he made
[52:25] sure he said that he was the beginning
[52:27] and the end so God knew from the very
[52:30] beginning what the end was going to be
[52:33] and he could create the beginning to
[52:35] make sure the end ended a certain way
[52:37] because he's God he's the god that's
[52:39] always there he's the god that always
[52:41] has been there he's a God that always
[52:44] will be there because he's God there's
[52:47] nothing too big and too hard for him
[52:49] because he's God and if I if you look
[52:52] back and say what what has the Lord even
[52:54] in your own life what has the Lord done
[52:56] for
[52:57] me what has the Lord done for me when I
[53:00] looked and I said that things were
[53:02] impossible and he still made the
[53:04] impossible possible because he's God and
[53:08] when he does something he completes it
[53:10] if he says by his strikes I am healed I
[53:13] can hold on to that because he's God and
[53:15] I can look at when he went to calvalry
[53:18] he defeated everything that was before
[53:20] he defeated every devil that may come up
[53:22] against you because he's God and he said
[53:25] I'm going to finish this it says in in
[53:28] John it says when Jesus was on the cross
[53:31] and he came to the end of the road he
[53:33] stretched out and he said it is finished
[53:36] it was right then and there the devil
[53:38] had no Dominion he had no control over
[53:41] anything else because what was going on
[53:44] everything that was there before was
[53:46] finished cuz God had done a complete
[53:48] work he had given us a way to get back
[53:51] to Heaven he had given us a way and
[53:53] given us an opportunity that said
[53:55] because I shed my blood I'm going to
[53:58] take your place I'm going to make sure
[54:00] that you have a way of
[54:02] Escape I'm going to make sure that you
[54:05] have a way to come to me and he said
[54:07] come to me all ye that are heavy laden
[54:09] and I will give you rest take my yoke
[54:12] upon you and learn of me for and he said
[54:15] that he would make your burdens e easy
[54:17] and your burdens light amen he make the
[54:20] Yoke easy in your burdens light amen see
[54:22] God he wants to take your burdens
[54:25] he wants to take what you've been going
[54:27] through and said I know that you can't
[54:29] defeat it that's why I gave it to you so
[54:31] that you can learn to trust me I gave
[54:34] this to you so that I can prove that I'm
[54:36] a deliverer I gave this to you so I can
[54:39] prove that I'm a Healer I gave this to
[54:41] you so I can prove that I'm a provider I
[54:44] gave this to you that you can come back
[54:46] and say I understood what David was
[54:49] saying recently Lord if I had 10,000
[54:51] tongues I couldn't praise you enough
[54:54] because God had been been that good to
[54:55] him God had done a complete work in
[54:58] David's life and when he looked back
[55:00] over his life he said you know God been
[55:02] too good to me God has been too good to
[55:05] me and when God starts something he
[55:07] completes it when God starts something
[55:10] he finishes it he's not a runner that
[55:12] starts a race and gets tired and say you
[55:14] know what I'm done I
[55:17] quit that's not God God when he starts
[55:20] the race when you when he gives you the
[55:23] race that he gives you he make sure that
[55:25] he gives you the strength he said I will
[55:28] supply all your needs I will make sure
[55:30] that I give you the strength that when
[55:32] you get tired I'm going to give you
[55:34] something to encourage you I'm going to
[55:36] give you something that's going to
[55:37] uplift you I'm going to give you
[55:38] something that's going to propel you
[55:39] forward and say and remind you that I'm
[55:42] still here with you I'm still God and I
[55:45] can change things in the moment in the
[55:47] twinkle of an eye I can make things
[55:49] disappear I can make things reappear I
[55:52] can make all that's going against you be
[55:55] a blessing for you so sometimes we look
[55:57] at our struggles and our trials and say
[56:00] man this this is hard for me but when
[56:03] you look back and said you know
[56:04] everything that was hard was just a
[56:06] lesson that God was trying to teach me
[56:09] it was just something that was a
[56:10] blessing even though even while I was
[56:13] stressing it was still a
[56:15] blessing because I would not be the one
[56:18] that I am today if God didn't start this
[56:20] work and complete it I would not be
[56:22] where I am today if I hadn't gone
[56:24] through what God had allowed me to go
[56:26] through because when God starts
[56:28] something he never leaves you confidence
[56:31] he never leaves you by yourself he never
[56:33] leaves you going through and continue to
[56:35] struggle he as long as you keep your
[56:38] eyes on him I said there was a story in
[56:41] the Bible where the disciples they had
[56:43] went out at night and I think the Book
[56:45] of John and they had went out and they
[56:48] were fishing all night and they were
[56:51] fishing and they were fishing and they
[56:53] couldn't catch anything
[56:55] now imagine if your livelihood the thing
[56:58] that you were good at the thing that you
[57:00] were great at all of a sudden you're no
[57:04] longer great at it you got to think
[57:06] about it Simon and those they were
[57:08] fishermen in all their lives they have
[57:10] been fishermen so you would think they
[57:12] know where to catch fish they know how
[57:14] to catch fish they know where to go and
[57:16] what time and what season to catch fish
[57:19] you don't go at certain Seasons because
[57:21] of the different things that and there's
[57:23] some that could tell you better than me
[57:25] but there are certain times when you go
[57:27] fishing and you expect to catch fish see
[57:31] they went out and they was expecting to
[57:33] catch something and they had they had
[57:35] fished all night long they had toiled
[57:37] all night long they might have moved
[57:39] from this spot to this spot to this spot
[57:41] and they were looking for some fish but
[57:43] they couldn't find
[57:45] nothing and when they got done and then
[57:48] Jesus came and they didn't know it was
[57:50] him and he said hey cast your nets on
[57:54] the other side now mind you if you was
[57:58] in that boat would you have
[58:01] listened would you have said you know
[58:03] what we've been doing this all our lives
[58:05] we don't even know who that is and they
[58:06] saying cast your net on the other side
[58:08] of the boat now now you don't think we
[58:10] tried that you can imagine what they
[58:13] might have thought but you know what
[58:14] someone might have said you know what
[58:16] let's just try it let's just see what
[58:18] happens and you know and and in the
[58:21] scripture said he said cast your net on
[58:23] the right side of the ship and ye shall
[58:25] find and they cast therefore and John
[58:29] chapter 21 and6 and he said they cast
[58:32] therefore and now they were not able to
[58:34] draw in for the multitude of fish see
[58:37] they were not able to draw in because
[58:40] God when he starts something he
[58:41] completes
[58:42] it and they said and that that's when
[58:45] they recognized that it wasn't just
[58:47] someone on that on that Shore it was
[58:49] Jesus it was Jesus it was the one that
[58:52] had been there with him the one that can
[58:54] speak things into existence whenever he
[58:57] wanted to and said when they got done
[59:01] and they counted it
[59:03] up it said it was 153 fish in that in
[59:07] that net and it was a small boat but
[59:10] they said the thing about it was with
[59:12] all the fish that was in it all types of
[59:14] fish the net never
[59:17] broke because when God does something he
[59:20] doesn't allow you to just if one
[59:23] blessing comes he wants you to get all
[59:25] the blessings everything that he has
[59:28] bestowed on you he wants you to capture
[59:30] it all he want to make sure that you get
[59:32] everything that he has for you he want
[59:35] to make sure that when I do this work
[59:37] you going to I'm going to complete it
[59:39] not you I think of how when God said he
[59:42] was going to destroy the Earth he
[59:44] destroyed everything he didn't leave
[59:46] nothing out but Noah who he said I was
[59:48] going to provide a way for you he said
[59:51] build this because I'm going to provide
[59:52] a way for you and God destroyed
[59:55] everything that the world was no longer
[59:57] like it was before because God when he
[1:00:00] does something he does a complete work
[1:00:02] he does something and he changes it in
[1:00:05] such a way that you know it was God that
[1:00:07] you can look back and say I know because
[1:00:10] of where I've been and what I've done
[1:00:12] Lord I know that it's only you that
[1:00:14] brought me out I know that what I was
[1:00:17] going through and where I was might have
[1:00:19] been in the bed of Affliction you might
[1:00:20] have been going through hard things in
[1:00:22] life but when I came to you Jesus
[1:00:25] I realize that Lord I was forever
[1:00:27] changed I realize that God you was you
[1:00:30] can do a work that nobody can do you can
[1:00:33] do a work in such a way that God that
[1:00:35] you can change my life no matter what I
[1:00:39] face no matter what I go through no
[1:00:41] matter what may be attacking me no
[1:00:44] matter what I may look at no matter
[1:00:46] who's around me God you can do this work
[1:00:50] said when I come to him I said the only
[1:00:53] thing that stops you is that you got to
[1:00:55] give a total surrender you got to give a
[1:00:58] total surrender to God that said Lord I
[1:01:00] want you to do the work I said there's a
[1:01:03] saying that says the Lord will keep you
[1:01:05] but I heard someone say if only if you
[1:01:08] want to be kept see you got to want God
[1:01:11] to do a change in a work in your life
[1:01:13] you got to want the Lord to change you
[1:01:15] you got to want the Lord to do a special
[1:01:17] work in your life and said Lord I give
[1:01:19] you everything Lord I can stand up and
[1:01:22] say Lord I trust you
[1:01:25] see David got before Goliath and he knew
[1:01:27] that Lord I trust you I can run towards
[1:01:30] my enemy because my enemy is going to be
[1:01:32] my foot stol today I can run towards my
[1:01:35] enemy because I know that God you're
[1:01:37] going to deliver him into my hand Lord I
[1:01:39] can run towards my enemy because I know
[1:01:42] when I get there you're already going to
[1:01:44] perform the work Lord I can run towards
[1:01:46] my enemy because I'm no longer afraid
[1:01:49] because I know that you're behind me
[1:01:51] Lord Lord I can run towards my enemy
[1:01:53] because I know there's nothing nothing
[1:01:54] too hard for you Lord I can run towards
[1:01:57] my enemy because I know that all things
[1:01:59] are possible if I only believe Lord
[1:02:02] you're the one that can do the work and
[1:02:04] there nothing that I can
[1:02:06] do there's no reason that I can point to
[1:02:08] myself and say that I did this my only
[1:02:11] thing I can do is point to you I can
[1:02:14] look up and say Lord my Help Cometh From
[1:02:16] The Lord my help and my strength and my
[1:02:19] Lord everything that I have each and
[1:02:22] every day that I wake up every breath
[1:02:23] that I breathe
[1:02:24] it comes from the Lord and I can look up
[1:02:27] and say Lord if you can give me life to
[1:02:28] breathe I know that you can keep me I
[1:02:31] know that you can direct me Lord I know
[1:02:33] that you can guide me Lord I know that
[1:02:35] you can watch over me Lord I know that
[1:02:37] you can bless me Lord I know that you
[1:02:39] can heal me Lord I know that you can
[1:02:41] deliver me Lord I know that you can save
[1:02:44] me because you're God and there's
[1:02:46] nothing too hard for you cuz when God
[1:02:49] does a thing he finishes it he completes
[1:02:52] it and he leaves nothing to nothing to
[1:02:55] to chance because he's God he said I
[1:02:58] know your beginning and I know your
[1:03:01] ending amen he knew when you started he
[1:03:04] knew all the ups and downs that you were
[1:03:05] going to go through he knew that when
[1:03:07] you got to certain points and places you
[1:03:10] was going to have no one to turn to but
[1:03:12] God and he said I had to give you that
[1:03:15] so that you could trust me more said I
[1:03:17] can't give you more if you if you're not
[1:03:19] using what I already gave you I can't
[1:03:23] give you more cuz God God wants to do a
[1:03:25] complete work he he does nothing halfway
[1:03:28] if God builds something he said I can
[1:03:31] imagine the best reward that you can
[1:03:34] ever get I said I started thinking the
[1:03:36] other day I said you know some people
[1:03:39] look to retire but I said there's no
[1:03:41] retirement like heaven there's no
[1:03:44] retirement when you get over there you
[1:03:46] don't have to worry about trying to find
[1:03:47] a house when you get over there you got
[1:03:50] a mansion and when you step out your
[1:03:52] door you're walking on Street streets of
[1:03:54] gold said when God does something he
[1:03:57] does it so spectacular that even you
[1:03:59] can't imagine it when he does something
[1:04:02] he does it so mighti full that even you
[1:04:04] couldn't even fathom it you didn't
[1:04:07] understand how God was going to do it
[1:04:09] but he did it you didn't understand how
[1:04:11] it was going to happen but he did it and
[1:04:14] he did it and said I sometimes I just
[1:04:16] want to prove to you that I'm God I
[1:04:19] remember the story in the Bible there
[1:04:20] was a blind man and the fa and God when
[1:04:23] he healed him the Jews they came back to
[1:04:25] him and they asked him or people asked
[1:04:27] him was it because of his parents'
[1:04:30] sin well that he was blind all his life
[1:04:34] and then then they as and Jesus said no
[1:04:36] was it because of his sin they asked and
[1:04:39] Jesus said no and and to paraphrase it
[1:04:42] and when he got down to it he said the
[1:04:45] reason that he was blind so that one day
[1:04:48] I could get Glory God allows certain
[1:04:51] things to happen so that he can get
[1:04:53] Glory so that he can say the work that I
[1:04:55] started was always going to be completed
[1:04:59] I just had to wait and let you go
[1:05:01] through so that I can complete the work
[1:05:03] so that I can show you that it's not
[1:05:05] anything that you could do it's not
[1:05:07] anything that you could say it's not
[1:05:09] anyone around you that can do it but I
[1:05:11] am God and I change not and I will do
