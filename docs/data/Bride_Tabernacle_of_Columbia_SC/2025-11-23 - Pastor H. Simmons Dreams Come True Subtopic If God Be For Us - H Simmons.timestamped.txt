[35:47] The book of Genesis 37.
[35:51] God is good in three.
[35:56] As we stand for the reading,
[36:00] 3-10,
[36:04] Genesis 37 3-10.
[36:07] I read the first, you read the next.
[36:09] We'll read the 10th verse together.
[36:13] Now, Israel loved Joseph or Jacob.
[36:18] Israel loved Joseph more than all the
[36:20] his children because he was the son of
[36:24] his old age. And he made him a coat of
[36:29] many colors. Four. And when his brethren
[36:32] saw that their father loved him more
[36:35] than all his brethren, they hated him
[36:38] and could not speak peacefully unto him.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; And Joseph dreamed the dream, and he
[36:44] told it [clears throat]
[36:47] it his brethren, and they hated him yet
[36:52] the more. Six. And he said unto them,
[36:55] "Here I pray you this."
[37:00] &gt;&gt; For behold, he we were by the sheav and
[37:04] in the field. And lo, my she arose, and
[37:10] also stood upright. And behold, your she
[37:13] stood around and made obbyent to my she.
[37:20] And his brethren said to him, "Shalt
[37:22] thou indeed over us, or shalt thou
[37:26] indeed have over us?" And they hated him
[37:29] yet more for his dreams and for his
[37:32] words.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; And he dreamed yet another dream. And
[37:36] behold, it was
[37:39] I and told it brethren, his brethren,
[37:44] and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream
[37:48] more. And behold, the sun and the moon,
[37:51] and 11 stars made a beast unto me
[37:55] together. And he told it to his father
[37:58] and his f brethren. and his father
[38:01] rebuked him, said unto him, What is this
[38:05] dream that thou has dreamed? Shall I and
[38:08] thy mother and thy brethren indeed come
[38:11] and bow down ourselves to thee and to
[38:15] the earth? God bless you. Read this
[38:17] word. You may be seated.
[38:19] [clears throat]
[38:21] We want to talk this morning about
[38:23] dreams come true.
[38:27] Dreams come true.
[38:30] And in the book of uh Romans
[38:35] 8,
[38:38] Romans 8
[38:43] and 28. 8 and 28.
[38:47] And for we know that what?
[38:51] &gt;&gt; All things work together for what?
[38:55] &gt;&gt; To them that love God. To them who are
[38:57] the what?
[39:01] For whom he did for know, he also did
[39:05] predestinate to be conformed to the
[39:07] image of his son, that he might be the
[39:11] firstborn among many brethren. Moreover,
[39:14] whom he did predestinate, them he also
[39:16] called, and whom he called, to them he
[39:20] also justified, and whom he justified,
[39:24] them he also what?
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Glorified. What shall we say to these
[39:29] things? What
[39:31] &gt;&gt; if us against us?
[39:34] &gt;&gt; God bless you in this word. Again, we
[39:36] thank God.
[39:38] If God be for us. Amen.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; We want to talk for a little
[39:46] uh
[39:47] dreams come true if God be for us. For a
[39:51] subtopic, if God be for us. Amen.
[39:55] And as we look at
[39:58] um Joseph and his dreams,
[40:02] a lot of often times in life in life and
[40:06] in living.
[40:09] People dream dreams
[40:11] and they said, "I have a dream."
[40:14] We we heard that phrase a lot of times
[40:17] in Martin Luther King. He said, "I have
[40:19] a dream." And he told about the things
[40:20] that he envisioned that would happen.
[40:23] Amen. that would cause, you know,
[40:27] whether you're white, black, or
[40:28] whatever, all coming together
[40:31] and being one. Amen. So, uh, it's many
[40:36] dreams that people have. But, you know,
[40:40] I find out that the Bible says,
[40:46] uh, it's going out.
[40:49] Praise God. I got to look to this other,
[40:51] but
[40:55] It didn't go out.
[41:01] Okay.
[41:02] Praise God. That in the last days he
[41:05] he'll pour out his spirit upon all
[41:07] flesh. Your sons and daughters should
[41:10] prophesy. Your young men should see
[41:12] vision and old men should dream dreams.
[41:16] And in the light of uh old men dreaming
[41:18] dreams and young men seeing visions,
[41:22] the Bible says also without a vision the
[41:25] people perish.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; So visions are dreams are
[41:31] realities that
[41:34] uh people have and that was promised in
[41:37] the hour that we live in that there will
[41:40] be dreams and there will be visions.
[41:42] Amen.
[41:44] And I said now to every one of us
[41:47] sometimes we we have visions and and
[41:51] sometimes we look at a vision as
[41:52] something that's going to happen. We
[41:54] look for different things that we see in
[41:57] our lives for the future.
[42:00] We want to you see ourselves going, you
[42:02] know, go graduating from high school or
[42:05] going to college and you have visions
[42:08] that you want to be a nurse, you want to
[42:10] be a, you know, mechanic, you want to be
[42:12] this or that. You have visions of
[42:17] working and having a house and having a
[42:20] car and you know that just um things
[42:23] that you
[42:25] want to achieve or want to accomplish.
[42:27] Sometime we style that as a we have a
[42:29] vision you know things that we hope to
[42:33] accomplish
[42:34] and then other things visions when we
[42:38] talk prophetically or Biblewise we're
[42:42] talking about uh
[42:45] being able to be awoke.
[42:49] You're awoke and then it's almost like a
[42:52] television screen come before you, but
[42:54] your eyes are wide open and you see
[42:57] things that will be in the future that
[43:01] going to come to pass. So that's what
[43:03] you s call a prophetic gift.
[43:07] And if you're a prophet or a prophetist,
[43:10] then that means that you can see in
[43:13] vision. You can be wide awake and you
[43:16] can be looking and all of a sudden
[43:18] something will drop down and you can see
[43:22] a vision. You can see things. You see
[43:24] people that's this person is going to
[43:27] get in an accident and this is how it's
[43:30] going to happen. That's that's a vision.
[43:33] the dreams and when you were asleep
[43:37] and sometimes I and and sometimes I I'm
[43:41] asleep and I it's almost like a a movie
[43:44] going before you and you see this
[43:47] happen, that happen, this happen and
[43:49] it's a dream. You wake up sometimes in
[43:52] the middle of the night, you get your
[43:53] pencil and your paper and you start
[43:55] writing what you see. Then you date it
[43:59] and you put the time by and you see
[44:01] whether or not your dream would come
[44:04] true.
[44:05] Now I dreamed that and it may happen,
[44:08] you know, a couple of weeks later, may
[44:10] happen a month later, it may have a year
[44:12] later. Now the prophet when he saw
[44:15] vengeance and sometimes it took, you
[44:18] know, years down the road. So he put him
[44:20] in a in a book and he'll write it down
[44:23] because not one of his visions that he
[44:26] saw, every time he saw a vision, he knew
[44:29] that that was God speaking.
[44:34] Now
[44:38] when you know God is speaking to you and
[44:41] somehow how many of you know when God is
[44:43] speaking to you through a vision,
[44:45] through a dream or just something come
[44:48] over you and you hear the voice of God.
[44:51] How many of you know when that's God is
[44:53] speaking to you?
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Okay. So often times we're not a
[44:57] conscious that God of the of the
[45:00] invisible God being visible to you and
[45:03] making himself known to you. Now God
[45:05] would come down. You remember uh Samuel
[45:08] was sleeping and uh he thought Eli was
[45:12] calling him and he went to Eli uh the
[45:15] prophet because he was raised up in the
[45:17] temple and uh he was just a young man
[45:20] and uh and a voice called Samuel. And
[45:24] then Samuel thought Eli was calling him.
[45:27] Are you with me? How many you with me?
[45:30] &gt;&gt; So Samuel thought Eli was calling him.
[45:33] Thought uh the priest or the prophet was
[45:36] calling him. But it was God that was
[45:38] talking to Samuel. Isn't that right?
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Now when he heard that voice, he went
[45:43] back to sleep and the voice called
[45:45] again. And then he says, "Oh, you said
[45:49] hear my Lord." And so he realized the
[45:53] Lord was calling. Eli told him, "The
[45:55] Lord is calling you. You got to go back
[45:57] and tell the Lord, yes, you know, I hear
[46:00] you, Lord. Speak." And the Lord told him
[46:03] about his ministry and about what he was
[46:06] calling him to do.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[46:09] &gt;&gt; And often times a minister feel like I
[46:12] have a calling to be a preacher. You
[46:14] know, sometimes I have children come to
[46:16] me and they're little children and they
[46:19] they have a calling. God called me to be
[46:22] a preacher. And uh and I said, "Okay,
[46:26] God call you to be a preacher, wait till
[46:27] you get the Holy Ghost. When you get the
[46:29] Holy Ghost, you can preach."
[46:32] You know, but they, you know, a lot of
[46:34] times they and so there's a there's a
[46:37] delay. If God call them, you know, it
[46:41] could be a delay. Uh I could say, "Well,
[46:44] God call you to preach. Hallelujah. We
[46:46] glad." And you might be six, seven years
[46:49] old, 10 years old, and you believe God
[46:51] call you to preach. Well, we know if
[46:53] you're going to preach, you're going to
[46:54] need the Holy Ghost.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; And if God call you to preach, then
[46:58] he'll fill you with the Holy Ghost, and
[47:00] you'll be a a Holy Ghost called
[47:02] preaching.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[47:05] &gt;&gt; So,
[47:08] and that's what we look for. You, you
[47:09] know, God deals with you in your life.
[47:12] Now you most preachers or the reason why
[47:14] they became preachers because God dealt
[47:17] with them in a dream. God dealt with
[47:19] them in a vision. Some supernatural
[47:21] occurrence happens in their life and and
[47:24] and there's a call of God. But to the
[47:28] normal preacher, he's smart, he's
[47:30] intelligent, and he went to school and
[47:33] he thinks he's a smart person. They got
[47:35] a lot of confidence in themselves and
[47:37] and they want to do something for the
[47:39] Lord. So the normal preacher want to do
[47:42] something for the Lord and they might be
[47:44] educated and they might be not be afraid
[47:47] to talk in front of the public or speak
[47:49] in front of the public. So they feel
[47:52] like well you know I might as well be a
[47:54] preacher
[47:56] because I can talk in front of the
[47:58] people and and I I feel like I can help
[48:01] people and I want to be help. I want to
[48:03] be a help to the church and a help to
[48:05] the people. So they go to preaching
[48:09] now not so much as so they've been
[48:11] called but they they felt like I I I
[48:15] want to do something good and to help
[48:17] the people but the co real genuine call
[48:21] preaching has to be you know Jesus said
[48:24] the spirit of the lord is upon me and
[48:26] for he has anointed me to what preach
[48:29] &gt;&gt; to preach the gospel and then he said in
[48:32] uh Ephesians 4 wherefore he said when he
[48:35] ascended up and high. He led captivity
[48:38] captive and he gave what? Gifts unto
[48:41] men.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; Now, uh preaching, he gave some
[48:45] apostles, some prophets, some pastors
[48:47] and teachers for the perfecting of the
[48:49] saints, for the edified in the ministry.
[48:51] God gives gifts, amen, to the uh the to
[48:55] the ministry. And that gift just as much
[48:58] is is real. It's a gift and it's a
[49:01] calling. God gives that gift to that
[49:04] person. Not that he goes off to school
[49:06] and get an education, get a degree, and
[49:09] he comes back said, "I've been ordained
[49:10] by such and such a church and I have a
[49:13] license by such and such and I can be a
[49:16] preacher." You know what I'm saying?
[49:18] Those are the things that happen to
[49:20] people. Now, we must search ourselves
[49:24] and know that uh all things would work
[49:27] together to them.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; And we know that all things work
[49:35] together to the good to them.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[49:46] that love the Lord.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Now you say, "I love the Lord, but all
[49:54] things work together to the good, to
[49:57] them that love the Lord." To them who
[49:58] are the what?
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Call.
[50:02] You and I must feel a calling. You know,
[50:05] a calling on our lives as individuals,
[50:07] not just a preacher feeling a calling to
[50:09] preach,
[50:11] &gt;&gt; but a calling.
[50:14] God call you. Amen.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; And God predestinated you. God chooses
[50:20] you.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God called. And you're here
[50:25] not just to come into church. You're
[50:27] here because there's a true call and a
[50:29] true deep call to the deep. God call
[50:33] you.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. No man that's you know you have
[50:38] not chosen me but I chosen you and
[50:40] ordain you. Amen.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; God made a choice. God, it's God echoing
[50:46] through you that you don't have to come
[50:48] to church, but it's something that you
[50:50] want to come to church
[50:52] &gt;&gt; because what God call you
[50:55] &gt;&gt; to be a saint, to be saved,
[50:58] &gt;&gt; to be a Christian.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; That is a call by God.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; To them who are the called according to
[51:05] his what?
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Purpose.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Purpose.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; God got a purpose in your life. Look at
[51:11] somebody. Tell them, "God got a
[51:13] purpose."
[51:14] &gt;&gt; God
[51:15] &gt;&gt; for your life.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; God got a purpose. He You're not just
[51:19] coming to church just to cuz this is the
[51:21] thing to do to be a good person, but
[51:24] it's a calling.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[51:28] &gt;&gt; God has called you for a purpose. Amen.
[51:32] And when God call you justified,
[51:35] glorified, and but he says, Amen. If God
[51:39] be for us, who can be against us?
[51:42] Amen. So I I I'm going to move on from
[51:45] that. I'm not even going to go through
[51:47] all of those the Romans and all those
[51:49] scriptures, but I want to talk to you,
[51:51] you know,
[51:53] about uh Joseph and his vision and his
[51:57] dream. Joseph had a dream.
[52:01] His father loved him.
[52:04] But your dream
[52:08] for your life even in the natural what
[52:10] you envision and what you want to be and
[52:12] what you're trying to be sometimes there
[52:14] all kind of obstacles
[52:19] there are all kind of uh stumbling
[52:21] blocks that will get in your way to
[52:23] cause you not to fulfill your dream.
[52:28] You know, often times a young lady
[52:30] dreams of getting married, having two
[52:34] children, a boy and a girl,
[52:37] and a house,
[52:39] and a nice
[52:42] Lexus,
[52:43] Mercedes,
[52:46] uh, and a nice house with, you know,
[52:50] this and that, and a husband that, you
[52:53] know, this and that, a young man, uh, in
[52:56] visions and dreams. Well, I have a nice
[52:59] wife
[53:01] and she's beautiful and I have a boy and
[53:04] a girl
[53:06] and uh you know I got a nice house, a
[53:10] nice job and um you know I I envisioned
[53:13] that. But you know, if everything was
[53:16] just so perfect,
[53:19] everything can align. And you maybe
[53:21] we'll look around and we think we see
[53:23] the the the perfect situation. A lot of
[53:28] perfect uh uh uh people that you know, a
[53:32] lot of things that you wish you could
[53:34] have and wish it could be possible for
[53:37] you
[53:39] and uh a and that's what you want for
[53:42] your life. But you know, you know, you
[53:45] might have the right kind of mindset,
[53:47] the right kind of desire and the things
[53:50] that uh uh you want to achieve and
[53:52] things that you would like to see happen
[53:54] for your life. But do you don't you know
[53:57] that there's a spirit as a devil there
[54:00] to hinder those things from happen?
[54:02] Amen.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; And sometimes you might voice
[54:07] a a friend of mine, he used to talk
[54:09] about, you know,
[54:12] you know, he says, you know, Simmons,
[54:15] he call me Doc. Dr. Simmons, you know,
[54:18] we all young ministers. He said, doc,
[54:20] you know what I'mma do? I'm I'm going to
[54:24] go to Texas and I'mma have such and such
[54:26] or that. And he envisioned that and went
[54:30] off to school. He got a a a doctor
[54:33] degree in theology, went to Harvard,
[54:36] Yale, something and got a law degree,
[54:38] ended up doing exactly what he said
[54:42] and went to Texas and became this. And I
[54:46] I said, man, you know, some people look
[54:47] like things go smooth.
[54:50] And some people, you know, I'm sure it
[54:53] didn't go as smooth as it looked,
[54:56] but it looked like it just went
[54:57] clockwise, you know, and some people,
[54:59] you know, desired that, okay, I'm going
[55:03] to play professional football,
[55:05] basketball, and then work real hard and,

[55:13] LIKE A a glove will fit your hand
[55:15] perfectly, you know, cuz they vision
[55:18] that and they wanted to be that. Some
[55:20] people, you know, I I remember Rachel
[55:22] since she was a little girl, probably
[55:24] two or I mean three or four years old,
[55:26] she said, "I want to teach school."
[55:29] You know what I'm saying? And it came on
[55:31] about, she she didn't just want to teach
[55:33] school. She want to uh help the special
[55:36] needs. You know what I'm saying?
[55:40] And as she come got to a little age like
[55:43] all she people ask you what you want to
[55:44] do I want to teach be a teacher I want
[55:46] to be a teacher look like everything
[55:49] work out she wants to be a teacher and
[55:52] and Caleb wanted to be a CEO or
[55:55] something I don't know whether he well
[55:57] on the way or not [laughter]
[55:59] in his head but hope he might be there
[56:03] you know
[56:06] so somebody grace God people have dreams
[56:09] and visions they want to be certain
[56:12] things and and and Rachel vision man she
[56:18] work hard
[56:19] she worked hard but it's a lot of things
[56:23] would hinder you in your work but if you
[56:26] have that vision if God be what
[56:30] &gt;&gt; if you put God first if you put God
[56:32] first
[56:34] &gt;&gt; thing you won't achieve certain things
[56:36] but you got to put God first
[56:38] &gt;&gt; amen Amen. Amen.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; You know, and I, you know, I thank the
[56:41] Lord that uh uh God will allow you to
[56:44] achieve certain things, but if it's not
[56:47] the will of God, please tell God, "Don't
[56:49] let it happen."
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; God, this is what I want and this is the
[56:55] path I want to take. BUT IF THAT'S NOT
[56:57] YOUR WILL,
[56:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Please don't let it happen.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; And you know, things could be better for
[57:04] us, but things wasn't better. But
[57:08] sometimes the the permissit will some
[57:11] things happen to your life and some
[57:13] things trip you up and cause you to
[57:15] stumble and it becomes permiss will. And
[57:18] God will allow permissit will sometimes
[57:22] to work out to the good of and makes it
[57:26] his perfect will.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even in the mistakes and things
[57:30] that you make in life,
[57:33] &gt;&gt; even when the bad decisions that you
[57:35] make in life, God can take those bad
[57:38] decisions and cause it to work to your
[57:41] good.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Cuz if God be for you,
[57:46] &gt;&gt; who can be against you?
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Dreams come true.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Look at somebody. Tell them, "Dreams
[57:55] come true."
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Dreams come true.
[57:58] Amen. And we we want to uh we want to
[58:01] talk about dreams come true. Amen. The
[58:05] things that you desire, the things you
[58:07] dream.
[58:09] And you know sometime people don't they
[58:12] stop dreaming because of disappoint. It
[58:14] don't look like my dreams, my
[58:16] expectation, the things that I I want to
[58:19] see happen in my life. So sometimes
[58:23] people just give up on dreams.
[58:26] they give up on on trying to accomplish
[58:29] achieve certain goals. It's only those
[58:32] that will stick to it, you know, stick
[58:36] to what you believe your calling is,
[58:39] your purpose is, and what Amen. What
[58:43] would make you s happy?
[58:46] Amen. And also, you want to please God.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and sometimes we give up
[58:55] too easy
[58:58] and we get satisfied and comfortable and
[59:01] not achieving.
[59:04] Now when I go back to the spiritual
[59:06] aspect sometime and you know I'm walking
[59:07] both ways you know so when I go back on
[59:10] the spiritual perspective of the thing
[59:13] when the prophet saw a vision
[59:17] you know he saw a vision of this person
[59:19] getting healed and he goes to the
[59:22] hospital or he goes to the home of the
[59:26] individual and they are dying
[59:29] on the deathbed. If God don't help them,
[59:31] they going to die. But he goes there, he
[59:35] sees a vision that this person going to
[59:37] be healed.
[59:39] But it that healing, Amen, took place uh
[59:44] that this certain person
[59:46] had to come in the house with a certain
[59:49] colored shirt on
[59:52] and they had to sat in a certain chair.
[59:55] And if that if and that person came in
[59:58] and didn't sat in that chair,
[1:00:00] then he could not do he could not do
[1:00:04] what God told him to do until that
[1:00:06] happened,
[1:00:08] you know. And the the prophet would wait
[1:00:12] sometime he would wait all night
[1:00:15] and then that person walk in there, sit
[1:00:18] down in that chair and then he could
[1:00:20] stand UP AND SAY, "THUS said the Lord,
[1:00:23] you're healed." OR THUS SAID THE LORD
[1:00:26] GET UP OUT THE BED and walk. No matter
[1:00:29] how they might be paralyzed, they might
[1:00:32] be whatever happen in their life, BUT HE
[1:00:35] SAID, "THUS SAY THE LORD, GET UP OUT THE
[1:00:37] WHEELCHAIR. THUS SAID THE LORD, RISE UP
[1:00:39] and walk." Because he's seated in the
[1:00:42] vision. And everything he saw in that
[1:00:44] vision happened just like he said. And
[1:00:48] he said, "Not one time out of the
[1:00:50] hundreds and thousands of time did one
[1:00:53] vision ever fail me." He said, "If it if
[1:00:57] it fail me one time," he said, "Call me
[1:01:00] a false prophet." He said, "A true
[1:01:02] prophet of God, it he never fail." If
[1:01:06] he's the true prophet of God, God gave
[1:01:08] him a dream, it would never fail.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:14] And and that's what God, you know, gave
[1:01:17] us a true prophet in this age that when
[1:01:20] he spoke, nothing would fail.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:01:26] When he said, "Thus said the Lord."
[1:01:28] Are you with me?
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Because he saw it and he had a
[1:01:34] confidence that it would not fail
[1:01:37] because God, it's God. He said, "You
[1:01:39] don't have a vision on your own. Neither
[1:01:41] do you dream a dream on your own.
[1:01:44] You say, "I'm going to dream a dream
[1:01:45] tonight. I'm going see a vision today."
[1:01:50] It's something that it it's controlled
[1:01:53] by God.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; It's not controlled by you.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; So, uh, in our, you know, way of
[1:02:02] thinking, human thinking, we're talking
[1:02:04] about our little vision and our little
[1:02:06] desires that we try to achieve. But what
[1:02:08] does we put it on the spiritual aspect?
[1:02:13] Let's put God up first. Dreams come
[1:02:18] true. So, Joseph dream,
[1:02:23] you know, I'm going tell you something.
[1:02:25] I've had a lot of things that I tell
[1:02:27] people. I I You ever seen somebody take
[1:02:30] your vision and your dream and jump in
[1:02:32] front of you
[1:02:34] and try to outdo you?
[1:02:37] Y'all don't y'all ain't with me.
[1:02:40] You go around and tell the wrong person,
[1:02:42] they'll jump up and they'll do it before
[1:02:44] you get to it.
[1:02:46] And when you you said, "I might as well
[1:02:48] leave it alone cuz they done messed it
[1:02:50] all up."
[1:02:51] You know what I'm saying? You had the
[1:02:53] dream and you told them about what you
[1:02:56] was dreaming of. You said, "Well, you
[1:02:58] might have had a, oh, I'mma open up some
[1:03:01] certain business and this is how I'm
[1:03:03] going to do it." You tell them all about
[1:03:04] it. They'll open up the business before
[1:03:06] you get to it.
[1:03:07] They already opened up the little shop,
[1:03:10] starting the business, and you said,
[1:03:12] "HUH?
[1:03:13] I TOLD THEM this what I was going to
[1:03:15] do." And they done beat you to it.
[1:03:19] And then they successful
[1:03:21] and they doing it. And you said, "Well,
[1:03:24] I might as well."
[1:03:27] MAN, I WAS I THAT'S I TOLD THEM about it
[1:03:30] and now they going to outdo me or outrun
[1:03:32] me. Oh, well, I don't want to do it no
[1:03:35] more.
[1:03:37] Don't you let
[1:03:39] somebody take your vision and your dream
[1:03:42] from you.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; You have all kind of disappointment.
[1:03:49] People that don't believe in your dream.
[1:03:52] People that don't believe in your
[1:03:53] vision. People that will try to keep you
[1:03:56] from attaining achieving what God want
[1:04:00] to use. Even yourself. Sometime you
[1:04:02] would doubt yourself.
[1:04:05] you would even doubt. You know, all you
[1:04:08] got to do is just have a little delays.
[1:04:12] You know what I'm saying? And in in your
[1:04:15] delays,
[1:04:16] sometimes you you you would you would
[1:04:20] believe that it ain't going to happen.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; So in your delays,
[1:04:26] you said, "Well, I don't know.
[1:04:29] Maybe this ain't for me."
[1:04:32] Now in in Habac
[1:04:35] two
[1:04:37] and and one it says
[1:04:40] sometimes things are delayed.
[1:04:44] Amen. And sometimes you because they are
[1:04:48] delayed we want it to happen
[1:04:53] you know without struggle sometimes.
[1:04:56] Sometimes you going to have struggles.
[1:05:02] I Caleb was one of the ones that said,
[1:05:05] "Daddy, pray for me." I'm having this
[1:05:08] test. Woo! This math is Oh, good lord
[1:05:12] have mercy. Daddy, please pray for me.
[1:05:17] You know,
[1:05:18] and he would come, you know,
[1:05:21] before he take a test said, "Daddy,
[1:05:23] please pray. this thing is hard.
[1:05:27] And I would pray with him
[1:05:30] but [laughter] and and God work it out
[1:05:33] and he passes. Thank the Lord.
[1:05:35] Hallelujah.
[1:05:36] Cuz some things take a struggle.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; You know, and some things make you think
[1:05:42] you taking the wrong course,
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; man. I might drop it. [laughter]
[1:05:49] You know what I'm saying?
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; I might as well give up.
[1:05:56] dreams come true. Something said, "You
[1:05:58] got to speak this message this morning
[1:06:04] for a certain purpose." I said, "Huh?"
[1:06:07] Yeah. You got to say this because
[1:06:11] sometimes people
[1:06:14] would discourage you.
[1:06:17] They make you doubt whether or not you
[1:06:20] see. I I want you to let God do it for
[1:06:23] you.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Where he can get all the glory.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; He said,
[1:06:30] "I will stand upon my watch, and I'll
[1:06:33] set me upon the tower, and I will watch
[1:06:36] to see what he will what
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; say unto me."
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; And what I shall answer when I am
[1:06:44] reproved.
[1:06:46] And the Lord answered and said, "What?
[1:06:50] vision.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; That's why I say in in in the middle of
[1:06:53] the night,
[1:06:54] a lot of times I get messages in the
[1:06:57] middle of the night and I said, "This
[1:07:00] message is so powerful, so simple. You
[1:07:03] know what? I ain't getting up out this
[1:07:05] bed to write that down."
[1:07:08] Yeah, I got it. I got it.
[1:07:11] And I get up.
[1:07:14] What did I dream last night? What did
[1:07:17] God? I know that was God. Goodness. I
[1:07:21] said, "Lord, next time I ain't going to
[1:07:23] do it no more. Tell me what what did I
[1:07:26] dream?
[1:07:27] What was the message you was telling me
[1:07:29] last night?" I said, "I ain't going to
[1:07:31] do it no more. I'm going to get up. I'm
[1:07:32] going to get up."
[1:07:35] I said, "Lord, please bring it back to
[1:07:37] my cuz the thing is, you know, it's
[1:07:39] getting next to you now." I said, "Lord,
[1:07:41] please." I go, "I can't hardly make it
[1:07:44] through the thing." I said, "Well, what
[1:07:46] was I supposed to TELL THE PEOPLE? WHAT
[1:07:48] WAS THAT dream about?" Then all of a
[1:07:51] sudden, I said, "God is good." He said,
[1:07:54] "Son and son, it's simple a lot of
[1:07:57] time." And he bring it back. Because
[1:07:59] when he speaks through a a dream or
[1:08:02] whatever and he speaks to you, it's
[1:08:05] better to give up, write it down, put
[1:08:07] the time, put the date, and you know, if
[1:08:10] it's God speaking to you in a
[1:08:13] supernatural way, it's going to come to
[1:08:15] pass.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; But if you don't get up, forget it.
[1:08:21] [clears throat] It It's gone.
[1:08:24] God will tell you what's going to happen
[1:08:25] on He'll give you the answer on the
[1:08:28] test. He'll tell you what what the
[1:08:30] teacher going to say before the teacher
[1:08:32] said it. He'll write all of that. You
[1:08:34] know, God will tell you things, tell you
[1:08:36] the future. You say, "Huh?" Then you
[1:08:39] realize you're getting to know God. You
[1:08:42] getting to know that God is real.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; And God works in your life.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; And and that's what we want you to get
[1:08:50] get in tune with. Get in tune with God.
[1:08:53] Some of you sitting around with with
[1:08:56] gifts that God has given you and you're
[1:08:59] not using those gifts because you know
[1:09:02] you don't even know if it's really you
[1:09:05] really gifted. You don't really know
[1:09:08] you're really gifted. You don't know
[1:09:09] that. You just think you know you're
[1:09:12] normal. But not everybody in here ain't
[1:09:16] normal.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; It's you you might have a prophetist in
[1:09:20] here. You might have a prophet in here.
[1:09:23] somebody that God is using in a
[1:09:25] supernatural way, but they don't know it
[1:09:27] because they think that I'm normal.
[1:09:30] You know what I'm saying? But you're not
[1:09:32] normal. You You're gifted. And you got a
[1:09:35] gift to be a blessing to the bride of
[1:09:38] Jesus Christ and to the body of Jesus
[1:09:40] Christ. Are you with me?
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; And God want to use that gift to his
[1:09:46] glory and for the edifying of the body
[1:09:49] of Christ. Are you with me?
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:53] Now he says, "Write the vision." Are you
[1:09:57] with me?
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; And make it plain upon tables
[1:10:01] that he may run that what?
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Readth it. For the vision is yet for
[1:10:07] what?
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Appointed time. But at the end it shall
[1:10:13] what?
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Speak.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Now he talked about the end and what the
[1:10:16] vision is going to speak. Daniel was
[1:10:18] told to seal up the book to the time of
[1:10:20] the end. Habach was told to write the
[1:10:22] vision. The vision going to speak at the
[1:10:24] time of the end. He was telling you
[1:10:26] things that was going to happen as you
[1:10:27] read the preceding chapter and so forth.
[1:10:30] Things going to happen at the end. Amen.
[1:10:33] And it
[1:10:34] it should speak and not lie.
[1:10:38] The vision is for a pointed time. It's
[1:10:40] going to speak and it won't tell a lie.
[1:10:42] Are you with me?
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Though it tars,
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; wait for it.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Wait for it.
[1:10:50] You know, like like the prophet had to
[1:10:52] wait. He had to wait for it. He had the
[1:10:56] vision, but he had it's for a point of
[1:10:59] time. He had to wait.
[1:11:03] He saw the little boy crushed by a car
[1:11:06] and ran over. You know what I'm saying?
[1:11:09] He had to wait and it happened over in
[1:11:12] Finland and then he it came back to him.
[1:11:14] This is the vision.
[1:11:17] Fell ran over by a car. He was dead in
[1:11:19] the street. Speak the word and the
[1:11:22] fellow would come back to life. You see
[1:11:24] what I'm saying? So God showed him that
[1:11:28] before it happened, right? And God will
[1:11:31] show you things to come. That's one of
[1:11:34] the gifts of of the Holy Ghost. He'll
[1:11:35] show you things to come. He'll show you
[1:11:38] things that's going to happen before it
[1:11:40] happen. You know,
[1:11:44] and sometimes when a person have a dream
[1:11:47] and they ask the prophet to interpret
[1:11:49] their dream, he said, "I can't interpret
[1:11:52] it until I see it."
[1:11:57] And he sees the dream that they had. And
[1:12:00] when he sees it, he could even fill in
[1:12:03] the things that they left out.
[1:12:08] And he said, "Now, this is the
[1:12:10] interpretation of your dream." Are you
[1:12:13] with me? So, let's go back to Genesis
[1:12:17] and and let's
[1:12:19] I'm going so slow and y'all going to be
[1:12:22] mad at me cuz I'm going too slow.
[1:12:26] Amen.
[1:12:28] Genesis uh 40,
[1:12:31] dreams come true.
[1:12:34] And these brothers, I'mma tell you
[1:12:36] something.
[1:12:38] You don't want your dream to come true.
[1:12:40] Tell the wrong person.
[1:12:44] You tell the wrong person. Lord have
[1:12:46] mercy. You know,
[1:12:50] there's some things I saw
[1:12:53] and I I tell my wife and sometime
[1:12:56] sometime I even forget. And she said,
[1:12:58] "Didn't you tell us this and that?" I
[1:13:01] said, "Yeah." I said, "Sometimes I say,
[1:13:04] "Oh, I I forgot." See, you told us
[1:13:07] before it happened.
[1:13:10] And uh now I'm not a you know, I'm not a
[1:13:14] prophet or nothing, but you know, every
[1:13:16] now and then something happened and God
[1:13:19] let me know. Amen.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; But I don't call myself a, you know,
[1:13:23] none of that, you know. But I, you know,
[1:13:26] God can use you even though you're not a
[1:13:29] prophetist, a prophet. God can use you
[1:13:32] and tell you things to come.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; One thing a lot of times
[1:13:40] you can know things and and and people
[1:13:44] tell you you don't know what you do
[1:13:45] know.
[1:13:48] They'll convince you. And then it's a
[1:13:51] it's a lonely life when you know things
[1:13:54] that spiritual things that's going to
[1:13:56] happen and you and people don't
[1:13:59] understand you.
[1:14:01] They they actually
[1:14:04] hate you because you telling them things
[1:14:07] that you know
[1:14:11] they hate you.
[1:14:13] But you got to if if if God reveal it to
[1:14:15] you and you know it, you got to hold
[1:14:17] true to them.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; It's very You got to hold true to the
[1:14:22] word of God.
[1:14:24] You take that stand for the word. If
[1:14:26] nobody lives it, you live it.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. If nobody want to go, you go
[1:14:32] anyhow.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; If you have to go by yourself, go by
[1:14:36] yourself.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; The word of God is right.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter who don't want to live
[1:14:41] it or who don't believe it's right.
[1:14:43] That's right. Anyhow,
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; stay with the word.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:50] Oh Lord. I wanted to get it's it's a few
[1:14:53] dreams I wanted to get to. But before I
[1:14:55] get to Isaiah
[1:14:57] 40, uh uh maybe I gone to Isaiah 40 and
[1:15:02] skip over I mean Genesis Genesis 40, but
[1:15:06] maybe I I want to go back to Genesis 20
[1:15:11] before I get to Genesis 40. Let me just
[1:15:13] do that.
[1:15:15] Genesis 20 and 1,
[1:15:21] the dreams come true. Amen.
[1:15:27] Caleb, you want to start reading?
[1:15:32] And Abraham journeyed
[1:15:34] from hence dense towards the south
[1:15:39] country and dwell between Kadesh and
[1:15:42] Shur. And so Jiren and Gedra,
[1:15:46] go ahead.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; And Abraham said to Sarah, his wife, she
[1:15:50] is my sister. And AMC, king of Gar sent
[1:15:54] and and took Sarah.
[1:15:57] Now we remember that in the preceding
[1:16:00] chapter, the God comes down to Sodom to
[1:16:03] burn Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:16:06] and Abraham and Sarah.
[1:16:09] Abraham was 90 and nine and Sarah was 90
[1:16:13] years old and an old lady. Are you with
[1:16:17] me?
[1:16:18] Now, here's a 90 year old lady
[1:16:23] and a 99y old man
[1:16:26] and [clears throat] and God come down
[1:16:28] and tells Sarah and Abraham that they
[1:16:31] going to have a child.
[1:16:33] Okay.
[1:16:36] just before Sodom burns.
[1:16:39] And this is the type of the rapture.
[1:16:42] Just before the rapture takes place,
[1:16:46] we're looking for something to happen in
[1:16:48] our lives. Now, the world has to come
[1:16:50] back to this condition. Sodom, he said,
[1:16:53] "As it was in the days of Noah and as it
[1:16:55] was in the days of Sodom, thus shall it
[1:16:57] be in the day when the son of man is
[1:16:59] revealed." So, we're living in the days
[1:17:02] of Sodom again. But what happened then
[1:17:05] was in shadow form and typho. But what
[1:17:08] happening now? Amen. This is reality
[1:17:11] time and it's happening again. Sodom is
[1:17:14] here. How many believe that?
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Sodom is here.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:22] [snorts]
[1:17:24] Pass the law. Men can marry men and
[1:17:26] women can marry women.
[1:17:29] Legalize.
[1:17:31] Oh, isn't that right? Amen.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; It's here. You better not say nothing
[1:17:35] about it either.
[1:17:38] But we have to speak where the Bible
[1:17:42] speak. Go ahead.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; But God took Aim came to Aimilec in a
[1:17:47] dream by night and said to him, "Behold,
[1:17:50] thou art but a dead man, for the woman
[1:17:53] which thou hast taken, for she is a
[1:17:56] man's wife." But Aimilec had not come
[1:17:59] near her. And he said, "Lord, without
[1:18:01] slay also a righteous nation."
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Now, what does a king
[1:18:06] of a nation want? A 90year-old woman.
[1:18:14] I mean, a king over a nation can have
[1:18:17] any the young brides that he can. Ain't
[1:18:20] that right? You think he want a 90 year
[1:18:23] old dried up and wrinkle
[1:18:27] woman?
[1:18:31] Huh?
[1:18:32] Are y'all with me?
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; But here's the scripture. Prior to that,
[1:18:37] Sarah laughed in the tent behind him and
[1:18:40] and and God said he was going to visit
[1:18:42] them, right?
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:44] So
[1:18:46] reason why these revelations are bought
[1:18:48] out in this hour that was hidden from
[1:18:51] the foundation of the world but they
[1:18:52] bought out in this hour to get you in
[1:18:54] rapturing condition to uh uh actually to
[1:18:58] settle and stable you and that you
[1:19:00] understand the time and the hour you
[1:19:02] living in
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; and you might be more ready to be
[1:19:07] prepared that I understand my day and
[1:19:10] the hour that I live in. And so you
[1:19:13] understand it, but the world out there
[1:19:15] and the people go to church all the
[1:19:17] time, they don't understand what day
[1:19:19] they're living in. Neither they
[1:19:21] understand the hour.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; But you understand exactly where you sit
[1:19:27] and where you stand. And you know what's
[1:19:29] going on.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:19:35] So
[1:19:36] this is that old lady ain't old no more.
[1:19:42] Are you with me?
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; That old lady
[1:19:47] had a body change.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; God promised that to Abraham and Sarah
[1:19:56] and they had body changes.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; God promised that the the Lord going to
[1:20:02] come and descend from heaven with a
[1:20:05] shout.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; And when God come down, you and I going
[1:20:09] to have a body change. And we believe
[1:20:11] that he's come.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; And he's here in a visible union.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; And that we are in a progress of a body
[1:20:20] change now.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; We're not waiting on the rapture. We are
[1:20:24] the rapture has already started. And we
[1:20:26] are part of the body change.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; We're being changed from glory to glory
[1:20:33] even by the spirit of the Lord.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Now, it may not look LIKE IT, BUT IT'S
[1:20:38] HAPPENING.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN. MY HAIR'S STILL [screaming] GRAY,
[1:20:41] BUT IT MIGHT TURN BLACK.
[1:20:45] Are

[1:20:57] black. Got some shampoo to do.
[1:21:00] [laughter]
[1:21:01] I ain't going to wash it, but I'm going
[1:21:02] to let it stay gray. And if it turn
[1:21:04] black, y'all better be doing getting
[1:21:06] ready to get out of here.
[1:21:08] Are you with me?
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, this old man that
[1:21:12] was can't hardly walk,
[1:21:16] all of a sudden he going to come in here
[1:21:17] running. So what happened to Brother
[1:21:19] Simmon? Oh, getting his pep back in his
[1:21:22] step,
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; getting ready to get out of here.

[1:21:30] things will start happening with inside
[1:21:33] of you. Oought to look for a
[1:21:34] translation. You ought to look for body
[1:21:37] change. You ought to in this hour as the
[1:21:40] world, amen, is experienced Sodom and it
[1:21:43] getting worse and worse. You ought to
[1:21:45] look from glory to glory being changed
[1:21:47] because the word of God has come to
[1:21:49] change you.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; It come to speak, Amen. faith inside of
[1:21:54] you.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; It come to Amen. TO TAKE YOU UP HIGHER.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; AND IF THINGS ARE NOT HAPPENING in your
[1:22:03] life, Amen. IS BECAUSE OF UNBELIEF. BUT
[1:22:06] IF you believed, THEN YOU KNOW THAT ALL
[1:22:09] THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; YOU [screaming] KNOW THAT GOD IS HERE.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE HOLY GHOST IS HERE.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; TO give you that body change.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NOT JUST GOING TO CHURCH.
[1:22:22] I'm here for a purpose. I'm looking for
[1:22:25] my body change.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; This thing was happening.
[1:22:30] Go ahead on. I I got to let you keep
[1:22:32] reading because uh oh
[1:22:35] I got I got to get through by 12 cuz
[1:22:37] y'all be ready to go to sleep.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:22:41] Said he not unto unto me. She is my
[1:22:44] sister and she even she herself said he
[1:22:47] is my brother. In the integrity of my
[1:22:50] heart and in the innocent innocency of
[1:22:53] my hands have I done this.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Now he was dreaming. See dreams come
[1:22:58] true. Sometime God speaks to people in
[1:23:01] dreams. God can speak to you in dreams.
[1:23:04] You know what I'm saying? You remember
[1:23:06] when uh Joseph was getting ready to put
[1:23:09] away Mary his wife and the angel of the
[1:23:12] Lord came to Joseph in a dream and said,
[1:23:15] "Fear not to take her to Mary uh your
[1:23:18] wife for that." You know what I'm
[1:23:20] saying? That which she has conceited is
[1:23:24] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; If God wouldn't have appeared to him in
[1:23:30] a dream, he would have put away Mary
[1:23:32] privately cuz he didn't want to kill her
[1:23:35] stone or to death.
[1:23:37] But God came to him and let him know
[1:23:39] this is a supernatural happening. And
[1:23:42] God has come to us privyly to make us
[1:23:45] understand that our pregnantation, amen,
[1:23:48] is the Holy Ghost impregnating us,
[1:23:51] getting us ready for our body change.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; See, Amen. God is saying the word that
[1:23:58] has come to you in this hour, you have
[1:24:00] become impregnated with the seed of God
[1:24:04] to bring forth Christ to this evil and
[1:24:07] adulterous generation. So God is
[1:24:10] impregnating you with the word like
[1:24:12] Mary. Amen. Say, "Be it unto me
[1:24:15] according to thy word." And you're
[1:24:17] saying, "Be it unto me according to your
[1:24:20] word." Lord, you said a virgin shall
[1:24:22] conceive and you're going to have a
[1:24:24] virgin church. a virgin church, a
[1:24:27] virtuous church, a church without spot
[1:24:30] or rank or blemish or any such thing.
[1:24:33] And Lord God, you are making me Amen.
[1:24:36] and you are using me and I'm one of them
[1:24:40] that you have Amen. for new
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF GOD BE FOR YOU,
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; who can be against you?
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. I'm I'm part I
[1:24:56] see myself in the dream. AMEN. DON'T YOU
[1:24:59] see yourself in the dream?
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:25:04] PRAISE GOD. YOU KNOW WHAT? JOSEPH
[1:25:06] brothers did not see the dream. They
[1:25:08] didn't believe the dream. But yet it the
[1:25:11] dream was what?
[1:25:13] Drew. It was true and it was coming true
[1:25:16] and they was MAKING IT HAPPEN.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; BUT YET THEY DID NOT KNOW THE PART THEY
[1:25:22] WERE PLAYING in the dream.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; But brother AND SISTER ONCE YOU
[1:25:26] RECOGNIZE WHAT PART you play in the
[1:25:30] vision of God in the DREAM OF GOD WHAT
[1:25:32] GOD FORTOLD. AMEN. That would happen OR
[1:25:35] IF YOU KNEW WHAT PART YOU PLAY. Are you
[1:25:39] with me?
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Once you know that, hallelujah. You can
[1:25:43] go with the flow. Amen. You can just
[1:25:46] flow right on along. knowing, amen, that
[1:25:49] all things work together to the good?
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. God, if you be fought me, who can
[1:25:55] be against me?
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I seen Joseph. Amen. He
[1:26:01] dreamed the dream and dreams come true.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he was a true prophet of
[1:26:07] God, and his dreams come true.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Go ahead on and read.
[1:26:13] And God said unto him in a dream, "Yay,
[1:26:15] I know that that thou didest this in the
[1:26:18] integrity of thy heart. For I also
[1:26:21] withheld thee from sinning against me.
[1:26:23] Therefore suffered I thee not to touch
[1:26:26] her." Now therefore restore the man his
[1:26:29] wife, but he is a prophet.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; No, now the man done told a lie. He
[1:26:33] said, [laughter] "Store, give that man
[1:26:35] his wife back cuz he's a what?
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Prophet."
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Cuz he's a prophet. You mean to tell me
[1:26:41] God will honor a lying prophet?
[1:26:45] Huh?
[1:26:47] You said, "Well,
[1:26:49] God said, you he done told a lie and yet
[1:26:53] God said, get that man and his wife back
[1:26:56] cuz he's a prophet." And what?
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; And he shall pray for thee.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; And he shall pray for you.
[1:27:04] You know,
[1:27:07] it it's something about when God got his
[1:27:10] hand upon your life.
[1:27:13] Even in your mistakes, when God got his
[1:27:16] hand upon your life.
[1:27:20] Now, I thank God for AMC. He didn't have
[1:27:23] an attitude. GOD, HE DONE TOLD YOU, he
[1:27:26] done told a lie. [laughter]
[1:27:28] He had an attitude. Lord, I didn't mean
[1:27:30] to do wrong. You know how you some man
[1:27:33] you told a lie. I ain't got no
[1:27:34] confidence in you. You
[1:27:39] but God said he is a prophet.
[1:27:44] Get that man his wife back. Are you with
[1:27:47] me? And he going to pray for you.
[1:27:51] That and if he don't pray for you I'm
[1:27:55] going to mess around and destroy you and
[1:27:56] the nation.
[1:27:59] But you got to obey God. Ain't that
[1:28:01] right?
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Some things we don't understand. Ain't
[1:28:03] that right? But believe it that God
[1:28:06] works things to the good. And if God be
[1:28:11] for you, who can be against you? God had
[1:28:14] a plan for Abraham's life and for
[1:28:16] Sarah's life. Amen. And he had already
[1:28:20] spoke it and nothing was going to make
[1:28:22] it the lack wasn't going to stop God
[1:28:24] from doing what he did said.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; So he couldn't touch her because God had
[1:28:29] a plan.
[1:28:31] Are you with me?
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Neither can the devil touch Amen. God's
[1:28:35] promise for your life.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Once you know what God promised for your
[1:28:40] life, don't you don't you believe that
[1:28:43] the devil can make it not happen.
[1:28:47] Amen. Now, let's go to uh Genesis 40. I
[1:28:50] I I guess we got to go faster, but 40
[1:28:53] and 12. Genesis 40 and 12. Uh let's
[1:28:58] let's just pick it up and see whether or
[1:29:00] not
[1:29:04] 12-4.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; And Joseph said unto him, this is the
[1:29:07] interpretation of it. The three
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; now we we we're dealing with the buck.
[1:29:11] Joseph done got in prison. How many you
[1:29:14] know the story Joseph? He in prison now.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; And in the prison the butler
[1:29:21] and the
[1:29:23] baker had a dream. Ain't that right?
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; And they couldn't uh they couldn't
[1:29:27] interpret the dream. I said, "Dreams
[1:29:30] come true."
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:34] So, let's look it up. And the three
[1:29:38] branches are three days. Yet within
[1:29:40] three days, Pharaoh shall lift up thine
[1:29:43] head and restore thee unto thy place.
[1:29:46] And thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup
[1:29:47] unto his hand after the former manner

[1:31:28] house and tell the king, I I I'm in here

[1:32:32] SIMMON FORGOT YOU, [screaming] DON'T

[1:32:40] towards his name. Brother Gerald,
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; GOD will never forget you.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; And you're dealing with a God that won't

[1:32:50] But the [laughter] man got back on his
[1:32:52] feet. He what? Forgot.
[1:32:57] Amen.
[1:33:00] Look at somebody tell them, "Don't
[1:33:01] forget the Lord.
[1:33:05] Don't forget to give him praise and
[1:33:06] thanks every day.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; It's another day the Lord has kept me.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Read on, brother Kellum.
[1:33:15] And bring me out of this house. For
[1:33:18] indeed I was stolen away out of the land
[1:33:20] of the Hebrews. Here also I have done
[1:33:22] nothing that they should put me into the
[1:33:25] dungeon. When the chief baker saw that
[1:33:27] the interpretation was good, he said
[1:33:29] unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and
[1:33:33] behold, I had three white baskets on my
[1:33:36] head, and in the utmost uttermost part
[1:33:39] uttermost basket, there was of all men
[1:33:42] of bread baked meat for Pharaoh, and the
[1:33:45] birds did eat them out of the basket
[1:33:47] upon my head. And Joseph answered and
[1:33:49] said, This is the interpretation
[1:33:52] thereof. The three baskets are three
[1:33:54] days. Yet within three days shall
[1:33:57] Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee.
[1:34:00] And the prophet had to tell Demons's
[1:34:03] carrier sister that she was going to
[1:34:06] die. And the time of her death therefore
[1:34:09] was going to be at 12:00 I think it was.
[1:34:12] And that she was going to die and not
[1:34:16] live. And get get prepared to die.
[1:34:18] You're going to die at 66 time at 12:00.
[1:34:24] He saw it in the vision
[1:34:26] and demon carry his sister which he was
[1:34:29] the head of the full gospel businessman
[1:34:32] and he was going his sister was going to
[1:34:34] die at 12:00.
[1:34:37] All of a sudden they was in a big
[1:34:39] meeting convention and a priest got up
[1:34:42] and said, "YOU SHALL NOT DIE BUT YOU
[1:34:45] SHALL LIVE." And the and the people said
[1:34:51] to brother Brano, "Hey,
[1:34:56] you hear that?"
[1:34:59] I ain't worried about that. He He said
[1:35:03] when you got thus said the Lord and you
[1:35:04] know the God is speak, you don't worry
[1:35:06] about that.
[1:35:09] You got thus said the Lord, you know
[1:35:11] what happened? She died just like he
[1:35:14] said. He told her to get her house in
[1:35:17] order cuz she going she going to die.
[1:35:19] You know what? When you hear all kind of
[1:35:21] prophets, all you want the prophet to do
[1:35:23] is tell you what.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Tell me a good thing. Don't tell me
[1:35:27] nothing.
[1:35:29] You know, we come to church, we want to
[1:35:30] hear all the good things. Well, brother
[1:35:32] Simmons
[1:35:34] ain't telling me no good thing. Let me
[1:35:36] go to a church where where somebody is
[1:35:38] is preaching the truth. Cuz the truth
[1:35:41] will set you free and it'll lift you up.
[1:35:43] It won't tie you down. It won't make you
[1:35:46] feel bad. IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD. I
[1:35:48] WANT TO GO CHURCH TO THE TO FEEL GOOD.
[1:35:50] CHURCH,
[1:35:54] love is what?
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Correct. And sometimes you have to
[1:35:57] correct. And sometimes you speaking
[1:36:00] things and you don't know why you're
[1:36:01] speaking it.
[1:36:04] You know, if Isaiah would have thought
[1:36:05] about a virgin conceived, he would have
[1:36:07] never said it.
[1:36:10] Cuz he know good and well a a woman that
[1:36:12] don't know no man can have a baby. So
[1:36:15] why I'm going to say something like a
[1:36:17] virgin going to conceive and have a
[1:36:19] child.
[1:36:20] He wouldn't said it, but it was God. He
[1:36:22] had to speak it because God said it.
[1:36:24] Ain't that right? And sometime the
[1:36:26] preacher up PREACHING AND HE'S SAYING
[1:36:28] STUFF AND HE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY HE SAID
[1:36:30] IT. And you COME TO HIM, WHY YOU SAY SO
[1:36:32] AND SO? I don't know.
[1:36:35] Did I say that? Yeah, you said it. You
[1:36:37] don't know me. You You YOU MESSING WITH
[1:36:40] MY BUSINESS. THAT'S MY BUSINESS. I don't
[1:36:44] care who told you that. But I tell you
[1:36:46] what, you better leave my business
[1:36:48] alone. You know, sometime I was
[1:36:50] handcuffed. Sometime I said this, I
[1:36:53] can't say that. Can't say. I said, "Take
[1:36:56] these handcuffs off me."
[1:36:59] Cuz a lot of times you know things
[1:37:01] sometimes personal private thing but at
[1:37:04] the same time you come forward you got
[1:37:06] to preach it is it's not like you
[1:37:08] telling person or private thing it's
[1:37:10] that you got to preach the word and if a
[1:37:13] person know you got to preach it. Amen.
[1:37:15] Doesn't matter if it is their condition
[1:37:17] you got to preach it anyhow. I said well
[1:37:20] Lord you know I I I can't I can't be
[1:37:23] like this. YOU CAN'T BIND ME UP. Why I
[1:37:25] can't sell this. I can't do. Oh. Oh, you
[1:37:28] going to think I'm picking on you. I got
[1:37:29] to be able to preach the word.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; And that's where a preacher held in in a
[1:37:37] place that he's got to please God. And
[1:37:39] sometimes he'll say things he didn't
[1:37:41] even know what he said.
[1:37:43] Are you with me?
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; If if he thought about it would hurt
[1:37:47] your feeling or hurt you, he probably
[1:37:49] wouldn't say it. But sometimes he can't
[1:37:52] think about your feeling or was it going
[1:37:53] to hurt you. He's got to know the
[1:37:55] scriptures. I got to say what God says
[1:37:58] in the Bible.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; And if it hurt you, it just have to hurt
[1:38:01] you.
[1:38:03] Are you with me? Because it hurt me,
[1:38:06] too.
[1:38:08] Okay, I got to I don't know why I said
[1:38:11] that. Go ahead.
[1:38:14] shall lift lift up thine head from off
[1:38:17] thee and shall hang thee on a tree and
[1:38:20] the birds shall eat thy.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; You think Joseph felt good telling the
[1:38:23] man you going your head going to be cut
[1:38:25] off and you going to do this?
[1:38:29] You know most of the modern day prophets
[1:38:31] or prophetist all they tell you God
[1:38:33] going to bless you. You're going to have
[1:38:34] a car. You're going to have a wife.
[1:38:36] You're going to have a husband. You're
[1:38:36] going to have this. They ain't never
[1:38:38] telling you, man, you know, I saw you
[1:38:42] and you committed adultery the other day
[1:38:45] and you did this, that, and the other.
[1:38:48] They ain't going to tell you that. They
[1:38:49] just going to tell you good things. You
[1:38:52] know what I'm saying? But some of the
[1:38:54] other things ought to be told that, you
[1:38:57] know, that exposes sin
[1:39:00] and and drive the devil out of people
[1:39:03] lives. You know what I'm saying?
[1:39:06] So, uh, let's see whether or not people
[1:39:09] say, "Oh, I would love to have a pro a
[1:39:12] prophet or prophetist or somebody with a
[1:39:15] gift." Amen. But you can have the gift
[1:39:18] of God and still, you know, be bound by
[1:39:23] people, opinion, and all of that. I got
[1:39:26] to close. Let me close with this. 41 and
[1:39:30] nine.
[1:39:35] Then spake the chief butler under
[1:39:37] Pharaoh, saying, "I do remember my
[1:39:39] faults this day." Pharaoh was wroth with
[1:39:42] his servants, and put me in ward in the
[1:39:44] captain of the guard's house, both me
[1:39:47] and the chief baker. And we dreamed a
[1:39:49] dream, and one night, I and he, we
[1:39:52] dreamed, each man according to the
[1:39:53] interpretation of his dream. And there
[1:39:56] was there with us a young man, a Hebrew,
[1:39:59] a servant to the captain of the guard.
[1:40:01] And he told him, and he interpreted to
[1:40:04] us our dreams, to each man according to
[1:40:06] his dream, he did interpret. And it came
[1:40:09] to pass as he interpreted to us. So it
[1:40:12] was me, he restored unto unto my office,
[1:40:16] and him he hanged. Then Pharaoh sent and
[1:40:18] called Joseph, and they brought him
[1:40:20] hastily out of the dungeon, and he
[1:40:22] shaved himself, and changed his
[1:40:24] reignment, and came in unto Pharaoh. And
[1:40:27] Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed
[1:40:29] a dream, and there is none that can
[1:40:31] interpret it, and I have heard say of
[1:40:34] thee that thou can't understand a dream
[1:40:38] to interpret it.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; And y'all know the dream that he told
[1:40:40] Pharaoh about the fame was going to come
[1:40:43] and so forth. And Pharaoh got him out of
[1:40:45] the prison and made him the man over to
[1:40:48] tell rule over Egypt and tell him how to
[1:40:52] get through the famine. Isn't that
[1:40:53] right? And then Joseph brothers and
[1:40:57] father and all came in and then they had
[1:41:00] to bow down to Joseph just like see what
[1:41:03] I'm saying. Dreams come true.
[1:41:07] Amen. Though it tar though it may take
[1:41:10] time. Dreams come true.
[1:41:13] Amen. And when God gives you dreams and
[1:41:18] visions and things don't worry about it.
[1:41:21] you you don't try to make it come true.
[1:41:26] You know, often times I talk I I tell
[1:41:29] you when you see people save and you see
[1:41:31] God deliver them. It's nothing that God
[1:41:34] just uses you. You just are part of the
[1:41:37] move of God, dreams come true. [snorts]
[1:41:41] His brothers and sist family had to bow
[1:41:44] down before him just like he saw in the
[1:41:49] dream
[1:41:50] just like they hate they hated him for
[1:41:53] that. They despised him because why? He
[1:41:58] was his father loved him and they were
[1:42:01] jealous of him and they didn't want it
[1:42:03] to. Huh? Even his dad said, "Well, mama,
[1:42:07] your mother and me, the sun and the
[1:42:09] moon, we going to bow down before you."
[1:42:13] And you see what I'm saying? Your path
[1:42:15] that you take. Sometimes it's a lonely
[1:42:18] road.
[1:42:20] Sometimes it's a misunderstood role.
[1:42:24] You as a Christian, as a believer,
[1:42:27] sometimes you're going to be
[1:42:28] misunderstood.
[1:42:30] Sometimes folks going to hate you
[1:42:31] without a cause. Sometimes people going
[1:42:34] to say, "Well, you know, you think this
[1:42:36] of yourself, you think that of yourself,
[1:42:39] you think you somebody special, you
[1:42:41] think, and those are your brothers,
[1:42:43] people that you love." They did him like
[1:42:45] that. Jesus came in the world, the world
[1:42:48] was fine. He went to his own and his own
[1:42:50] didn't receive him. They rejected him.
[1:42:53] And then Joseph got him a gentile wife,
[1:42:57] a bride. And Jesus was rejected by the
[1:43:01] Jews and got a gentile bride. Are you
[1:43:03] with me? These things happen.
[1:43:07] It happens. So, are you with me? And
[1:43:10] when these things happen in your life,
[1:43:13] are you with me? these things happen in
[1:43:16] your life. Don't think it's strange.
[1:43:19] Don't think it's strange that sometimes
[1:43:21] uh things would hinder you from your
[1:43:24] blessings and things would get in the
[1:43:26] way of the move of God in your life and
[1:43:29] sometimes it looked like amen. It things
[1:43:31] are not going to materialize and look
[1:43:34] look at how long it took Abraham and
[1:43:36] said it looked like things are not going
[1:43:38] to materialize. Things are not going to
[1:43:40] happen. But you got to have patience. Do
[1:43:42] it tar. He says what? Wait for it. Do
[1:43:46] it, Terry. Wait for it. Amen. Because
[1:43:49] you can get in a hurry and you can try
[1:43:51] to make it happen.
[1:43:53] Amen. And when you try to make it
[1:43:55] happen, how many you know it won't it
[1:43:58] won't happen.
[1:44:00] God God if God is in the business and
[1:44:04] God said, Amen. in his word, Amen.
[1:44:07] according to thy word, according to what
[1:44:10] God is written is written of me to do
[1:44:13] thy will, oh Lord.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Let us stand.
[1:44:23] Now those this is one of the two or
[1:44:26] three hour lessons,
[1:44:30] but we tried to cut it short.
[1:44:34] Are you with me?
[1:44:36] How many of you got anything? Did you
[1:44:38] get anything this morning?
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause and cheering]
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Let us just bow. Father, in
[1:44:47] Jesus name,
[1:44:50] thank you for the opportunity to share
[1:44:52] these things with your people.
[1:44:55] Dreams come true.
[1:44:59] Dreams do come true.
[1:45:03] as [clears throat] the baker and the
[1:45:05] buckler.
[1:45:07] One came true to the good and looked
[1:45:10] like the other came true,
[1:45:13] but it caused the baker head to be cut
[1:45:16] off.
[1:45:19] Lord, the Joseph brothers
[1:45:22] didn't understand that God was going to
[1:45:24] use him to be a blessing to them.
[1:45:28] Well, Lord, thank you that Jesus came
[1:45:30] down,
[1:45:32] died for the sins of the whole world,
[1:45:35] came to reconcile man back to God,
[1:45:40] but his brethren didn't understand.
[1:45:43] But thank God for your grace this
[1:45:45] morning.
[1:45:47] That your savior, your Lord,
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; YOUR GOD THAT COME DOWN TO DIE
[1:45:52] [screaming] FOR our sins.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:45:56] and our heads are bound, our hearts are
[1:45:58] looking unto him. How many of you would
[1:46:00] look to the Jesus and accept him as
[1:46:04] savior and as lord? As our heads are
[1:46:07] bowed, just raise your hand. Lord, I
[1:46:09] accept you. Thank you.
[1:46:12] Thank you. Thank you.
[1:46:15] Father God, you see the hands that have
[1:46:17] been lifted up, the hearts that are open
[1:46:19] this morning.
[1:46:22] Somebody say, "Lord, we welcome you.

[1:46:29] of my sin, Lord.
[1:46:31] For I receive you as Lord and Savior.
[1:46:35] Thank you for dying FOR ME.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU for shedding your blood.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Touch, heal, AND DELIVER.
