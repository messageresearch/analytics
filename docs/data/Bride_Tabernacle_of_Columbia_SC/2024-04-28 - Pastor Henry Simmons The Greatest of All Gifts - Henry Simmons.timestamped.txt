[36:12] amen backing up a little bit we were
[36:15] talking about the greatest gift and that
[36:18] which is perfect has come
[36:20] amen that which is perfect has
[36:23] come we'll start at the 15 and one I
[36:27] read the first you read the next
[36:30] and and we'll read through the 13th
[36:38] verse St John 15 And1 I am the True
[36:43] Vine my father is the husband too
[36:58] now ye are clean through the word which
[37:03] I have spoken unto you
[37:16] for I am the vine ye are the
[37:20] branches he that abideth in me and I in
[37:25] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[37:30] for without me ye can do nothing six
[37:45] a if ye abide in
[37:49] me and my words abide in you ye shall
[37:54] ask what ye will and it shall be done
[37:59] unto you
[38:07] eight as the father has loved me so have
[38:13] I love you continue ye in my love 10
[38:27] these things have I spoken unto
[38:30] you that my joy might remain in you and
[38:36] that your joy might be full
[38:44] 12 together greater love has no man than
[38:48] this that a man lay down his life for
[38:51] his friend God bless you read for you
[38:54] may be seated the 14th verse says ye are
[38:58] my
[38:59] friends if ye do what soever I command
[39:04] you he said henceforth I call you not
[39:09] servants for the servant knoweth not
[39:13] what his Lord doeth but I have called
[39:16] you friend for all things that I have
[39:20] heard of my father I have made known
[39:23] unto
[39:24] you so by the grace of God God
[39:29] I want to we said on last Sunday that
[39:32] which when that which is perfect is
[39:35] come and then that which is in part
[39:38] should be done away with isn't that
[39:40] right
[39:43] so it was thres throughout if if you
[39:48] ever studied the message of the
[39:50] hour the theme of it is love amen if you
[39:54] study the Bible the Bible tells us about
[39:57] about the love of
[39:59] God coming to us amen amen so we said
[40:04] the greatest of all
[40:07] gifts 1 Corinthians
[40:11] 13 and
[40:13] uh 1 Corinthians
[40:18] 13 and the the last verse he says now
[40:22] abided Faith Hope
[40:28] charity these three but the greatest of
[40:32] all of these is
[40:35] what love
[40:37] amen now we said the without the love of
[40:41] God Amen see to abide in God he said
[40:46] except you abide in me my word abide in
[40:48] you to abide in him is to abide in his
[40:54] love once we get out of the love of God
[40:57] once we be conduct Our
[41:02] Lives outside of the love of God then he
[41:07] says if a man abideth not in
[41:11] me he's no good he's just to be
[41:14] burnt in the
[41:17] fire I'm the vine ye the
[41:20] branches amen if we don't stay connected
[41:23] the only way we're going to stay
[41:25] connected with God
[41:28] is to stay in the love of
[41:30] God the only way we're going to have the
[41:33] love of God is we have the Holy
[41:36] Ghost now we can have
[41:41] love for one another for family and for
[41:44] friends
[41:46] and but to have the love of God in our
[41:50] hearts is a goday love that's God's
[41:54] love the greatest of all gifts
[41:58] though I have faith hope and
[42:01] charity but he said the greatest is
[42:05] charity is
[42:07] love
[42:09] now in St
[42:11] John I I guess I better stay here in
[42:19] Corinthians it's a lot of things that
[42:21] are done and I'm going tell
[42:25] you the
[42:28] devil he hates
[42:32] God he does not like
[42:35] God he hates to see you
[42:39] love one
[42:41] another he
[42:44] despise said in the Sunday school this
[42:46] morning one of the characteristics of
[42:49] Lucifer when he was lifted up in his
[42:51] heart is
[42:55] pride we were talking about the elect
[42:59] cannot be
[43:01] deceived what what makes you elect and
[43:04] what makes you
[43:07] not impossible to deceive
[43:14] you it came real strong to me you know
[43:18] in
[43:19] pray sometimes we see you feel so
[43:24] secure cuz God sent a prophet and we
[43:26] have have a
[43:29] message that has called us out of the
[43:33] denominational world and called us out
[43:35] of mystery
[43:37] Babylon and we know
[43:40] that denominationalism is is not of
[43:44] God an organized religion and so
[43:49] forth
[43:51] but what we fail to understand that that
[43:55] would not deceive us
[43:59] we understand that he said for the
[44:01] elect's sake God shorten the
[44:05] days are you with me the deception is
[44:09] going when
[44:11] Lucifer decided that he had
[44:17] something in his heart he was lifted up
[44:20] in his
[44:23] pride we talked
[44:25] about all that is in the world is the
[44:28] lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes
[44:30] and the what pride of life pride of
[44:35] life
[44:38] Pride I will Ascend above the stars of
[44:41] God I will be like the
[44:45] I I think brother Gerald say it's a
[44:47] selfish
[44:49] spirit it's a selfish
[44:52] Spirit people are selfish
[44:57] we're born to be
[44:59] selfish we're born Amen to be
[45:03] proudful proud of my family I'm proud of
[45:06] my children I'm proud sometimes that's
[45:09] all right you saying you know I'm
[45:11] thankful in other words and we might use
[45:14] proud I'm thankful to God that God has
[45:17] blessed my family and I'm proud to see
[45:20] him do the right thing and live the
[45:22] right kind of way and so forth I really
[45:25] sometimes I tell my children I'm really
[45:27] really really proud of
[45:29] you the choices that you make I thank
[45:33] God for your choices that you make the
[45:36] right choices and decision thank God for
[45:40] you am now it's a different type of
[45:45] Pride that Lucifer had he wanted to am
[45:49] me to lift himself
[45:52] up we talking about the greatest of all
[45:55] gift is the love
[45:58] but what we what what what what we
[46:00] seeing there's a constant war and a
[46:03] battle going on because Lucifer in
[46:07] himself wanted to exalt
[46:12] himself are you with
[46:14] me this flesh wanted to exalt itself
[46:18] itself above
[46:21] God above the word of God
[46:28] above the Revelation that God has given
[46:30] you and I in the hour we live in
[46:34] am the devil will allow himself to be
[46:38] exalted above the stars of
[46:42] God but the greatest of all
[46:46] gifts brother and sisters one of the
[46:50] character
[46:51] Riches of the
[46:53] devil is we call it the fire seated
[46:57] religion that we must be careful
[47:00] of the spirit of the Pharisees they said
[47:03] we have Abraham of our father and they
[47:06] believed in Miracles and they believe in
[47:08] the resurrection and Sadducees didn't
[47:10] believe in angels in the resurrection
[47:13] and so forth but the Pharisees they
[47:16] believed in that angels and they
[47:19] believed in the resurrection and so
[47:20] forth but here the Pharisees had such a
[47:25] SP proud spirit
[47:28] such a religious spirit that when Jesus
[47:30] came to
[47:32] them they thought that they were inly
[47:36] out of seal they said that we have a
[47:39] am we're rich we increase the good we
[47:42] don't need
[47:44] you they saw no need of God because they
[47:49] had their
[47:51] own
[47:53] Revelation they were
[47:55] Pharisees they had it
[47:58] all if you were of God then you would
[48:02] actually be a Pharisee you
[48:06] see and if he was a aen if if you were
[48:09] spiritual you would want to be a
[48:13] Pharisee Pharisees they thought they had
[48:16] it and lay out of seal the people be
[48:19] rich increasing good and they said I
[48:22] have need of
[48:23] nothing the deception of this age is to
[48:27] feel so self
[48:30] secure you know I was on my knes friend
[48:33] this morning I said you know
[48:35] something when we didn't have much we
[48:37] didn't worry about a thing we didn't
[48:40] worry about protecting it losing it now
[48:43] we take we'll work two or three job we
[48:45] work overtime and every kind of time we
[48:47] can get to try to keep the love that we
[48:52] got but we didn't have
[48:54] much man we get on our KNE cried to God
[48:58] love God all but when we get a little
[49:00] something we do everything we can do to
[49:02] try to what hold on to that little
[49:05] something and who's who's lacking
[49:11] spiritually
[49:12] materially we have it spiritually we
[49:16] lost
[49:18] it and on my knees this
[49:21] morning
[49:23] it's I looked at um
[49:28] Hosea says in Hosea
[49:31] 6 and and I said Lord you know something
[49:35] in my spirit was
[49:37] saying I said God we've gotten so rich
[49:41] and increasing Goods to where is the
[49:44] love of God where is our love for
[49:48] God the things of this world and the
[49:50] things that we possess have blinded us
[49:57] we're doing so much to try to hold on
[50:00] and try to get a little bit more of what
[50:02] we got that we don't L the
[50:07] most the thing that the greatest
[50:11] thing and that is to have the love of
[50:14] God in our
[50:15] heart it says in Hebrews I mean Hosea 6
[50:19] And1 it said come let us what
[50:26] and I said Lord I I I can hear the
[50:29] spirit inside of me and I said
[50:33] Lord oh god what
[50:36] happened what happened I I was looking
[50:39] at this age and what we live in the time
[50:42] that we living
[50:44] in the greatest of all gifts is missing
[50:47] in the
[50:49] church

[51:20] you to understand that God wants to be
[51:24] first amen he wants to be the utmost
[51:27] thing in your life is because it's the
[51:30] greatest of all
[51:32] gift the Bible said greater love has no
[51:35] man endur that he gain his life the lay
[51:39] on his life for
[51:41] us that's great
[51:44] love and the Bible tells us even while
[51:47] we were yet enemies in our mind with
[51:50] Wicked work Christ died for the
[51:53] ungodly are you with me regardless of
[51:57] how we were but hey we're more worried
[52:01] about our
[52:04] material your things then we're worried
