father God asks you or God to move in our midst Lord God Speak oh God what you would have us to know and to understand because I was late and we need to hear a word from you help us now in Jesus Christ's name amen Revelation 19 1 through 8. I read the first you read the next God we thank God for everyone and after these things I heard a great voice a much people in heaven saying hallelujah salvation and glory and honor and power unto the Lord Our God too and again they said Hallelujah and her smoke rolls up forever and ever for and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our God all ye his servant and ye that fear Him was small in great six let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready together and to her was granted as she should have been arraigned and finally and clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints may be seated [Music] God is good amen we're coming down to the the marriage of the lamb and and uh we talked about we want to say are you ready to be married are you prepared are you ready to be married CNN Young people when they get a certain age they're looking forward to it's a normal thing to look forward to being married that's the norm and with marriage they're looking for a life after marriage now here it we're talking I guess we getting some Echo back we're talking about the marriage of the Lamb we're talking about the wife has made herself ready but are you ready to be married the preparations sometimes I look back and my life and sometimes I knew that at an early age sometimes I you felt like yeah I want to be married but was I ready to be married somebody says well bro a young man I want to introduce you to my daughter a young man I want to introduce you to this one on the job everybody wants to introduce you to somebody but you got to know whether or not you're ready even though there was a desire to be married but whether you're ready for marriage the church that we came up in they had to future homes or something like that and they prepared the young girls young ladies they tried to prepare them for marriage how to be even in school you had with the home economics or whatever they had things to try to get you ready for marriage so you were taught how to do certain dishes cook then you're supposed to be taught how to clean how to sew and what was expected of you as a wife sometimes we come from all walks of life sometimes there were single parents sometimes there's no father figure so young man and marriage the future is what kind of father will I be what kind of mother will I be am I ready to be a mother am I ready to be a father so I must position myself and I got to see whether or not I'm ready for marriage but many times our attention on whether we're ready to be married most of the time our I find many times we are trying to get the image of marriage to set upon my wedding day the wedding day is all about marriage how I want to look what kind of dress I'm gonna wear and uh you know who I want to be in my wedding and I will all that preparation but am I prepared for marriage have I made ready for it Jesus said concerning his wife he told her that I'm gonna make preparation I'm going to prepare a place for you are you with me so I'm talking to you this morning but I was just praying about it oh I want to bring certain principles out you know marriage is also you got to look at who you're going to marry and are y'all compatible the Bible speaks and says be not unequally yoked is your yoke equal am I prepared in everywhere be not unequily yoked together with unbelievables in other words do you have the same purpose same mind probably God's talks about an invisible Union he also speaks of children abroad that invisible Union should take place in spirit form sometimes I was looking by consciousness do you choose the bride or does God choose you a bride so you can choose who you want but God chooses for you when God makes the choice it's different when you make the choice you're going to come into some pitfalls and some hard things that you're going to have to go through but when God chooses for you then he don't make a mistake many people have made choices for us but the choice that God makes that's that makes a difference are you with me now God doesn't doesn't make a mistake are you ready for marriage do you qualify what are your qualifications most of the time all we are looking for is the outward appearance is to fulfill our lust we're not looking for compatibility character we're looking for substance someone that can nurture because if you look forward to Eve was to reproduce Adam the product of What comes forth and who those individuals are the Bible said train up a child and where it should go and when his old won't depart do we have that nurturing that is needed can we provide that type of character are we just going to have a child and have children and don't know how to manage we can't manage ourselves we can't manage them we can't manage we will you know I want to use the word oblivious we just lost when uh a state of what did I just do but yet we want to be grown we want to be um strong we want to be I am a dog I am I am smart I'm intelligent I'm this all of that don't mean a thing the fruits of your label what are you going to produce sometimes a responsibility the lies within am I ready to be married sometimes if you really examine it you you're thoroughly hell no I don't know about that I'm not really really are you ready to take on the responsibilities are you ready to give up because marriage is no more Twain the two becoming to becoming one let me just go through a scripture two because we're living in an age of Chaos the churches are getting all confused the preachers are getting confused that used to understand separate principles I'm just going to read these scriptures because I want to set a little foundation around that because of what's going on around us and our environment sometimes the passages look like they've gotten a state of Amnesia confusion but the word of God it's the same the word of God is the same as it ever was what's written in this Bible is the same same Bible same truth it says here and uh Matthew 19 and 4. and he answered the Pharisees talking about my is it lawful to put away your wife and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at at the beginning made them what so don't worry about was a this woman with woman a man with man no made him what male and female so don't worry about that we're not dealing with that this morning made a male and female isn't that right and he said but it's called shall a man what and we'll live in we'll we're talking about my parents with David and Charlotte Simmons are you with me and if I'm going to be married to Christ then it's not denying David and Charlotte Simmons but I got to leave my natural birth which was a sinful birth are you with me I was born in sin shaping and iniquity so I got to in order to be married to Christ I got to leave that are you with me I can't be my are you married to Christ and still holding on to that damn it nature are you with me I'm getting ahead of myself but hopefully you understand leave your father and the mother shall cleave to his wife why and they twain shall be what one flesh the Bible teaches us by one Spirit or we baptize into what one body God is calling for a union a union with him are you ready to be United with Jesus Christ are you ready to be married the union with Christ is different in your union what Christ ought to be so that you can look at your union with Christ and your union in the natural marriage look at your union in the spiritual marriage okay because here it talks about his wife has made herself ready okay he said well for there are no more Twain but they're one flesh what therefore God has joined together let not what let no man put a son so I said this is an invisible Union here that you've been coming one in Christ he said your normal Twain you know more chew but you're one are you with me he said this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ in the church amen you are married amen and it's wife has made herself ready I was telling Caleb and I say your power of your Victory is in your prayers you must overcome in your prayers and get Victory through praying and when you pray through amen you can make it through When you pray and you know that your prayers have been heard and God has conquered your enemy a lot of times the lack of prayer crying out the god in desperation amen when you get detriment enough that God I need Deliverance I need your power God I can't make it without you get desperate concerning our faith in him are you ready to be married he said for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready are you with me so in Simplicity here uh as we read let not man put us on and they said unto him why didn't Moses then command to give a right and a divorce and then to put it away he said unto them Moses because of the what hardness of your heart because of the hardness of your heart suffered you to put away your wives right he suffered you because your heart was hard to put away he said but from the beginning it was what is not so amen so it wasn't so he said and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for what fornication the angel told uh Joseph in the dream fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife he was engaged to her but he said fear not to take him to thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceded here is of the Holy Ghost amen when he wanted to put a wave because he hadn't married her yet he was engaged but he said this is your wife and I'm saying you were married to Jesus Christ right now he's your husband are you with me it is already you've already made God decision you've already said I will I do are you a man so in that you have said that I made a commitment to Christ I said Lord I accept you as my Lord and my savior then you are my husband are you with me and I invite your Holy Ghost I invite your Holy Spirit in I want you to be welcome to come into my life so Holy Ghost come on I said I do I will I said I I I I want you to be my Lord my savior but I want you to know it wasn't your choice it wasn't you'd have made that decision it was God that gave you that heart that mind and that will and that Walton amen because he chose you you were willing to accept that little noise that little push that little thing that said do it something said it's for me in Christ and my savior he died for my sins I need my Lord and I want to accept him something inside you begin to believe that doesn't matter what Mama believed her daddy believe her sister brother it doesn't matter what friends believe something inside of me saying yes I believe praise God and what made you qualified to be the Lamb's wife amen why would you become under the qualification how do you fit that moles because the Lamb's wife is supposed to be his church his bride which is his body isn't that right the Bible said that he in order to marry him we we must be a church with our spot or without blemish amen without wrinkle or any such thing isn't that right so what makes you that way for his wife has made herself ready amen so what makes you so clean and so pure and so right inside of God that you can say that I'm Justified and I'm equally young and I can be one what makes you that way saying You must be perfect to marry perfection for he said be ye perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect if I'm going to marry Jesus Christ then I as an individual must be perfect and how can I be perfect when I'm born in sin shaping in iniquity how can that happen with God's God is looking for perfection without blemish without spot are you with me so how am I going to reach that particular how can he marry me a sinner a ratchet undone he said unto her was granted that she be arrayed and white linen amen it's going to be pure it's going to be white amen God is is granting you something he's given you that garment to be dressed to him and I believe that the Bible says he made himself sin that you might be clothed amen that you might be clothed with his righteousness are you with me see the lamb in the Old Testament amen when the lamb was without spot and it was offered as a sacrifice for your sins in the Old Testament it can only cover up your sins it could not take away your sin because you had the same desires but you had a covering for sin because of the Lamb that was sad his blood for you in the Old Testament he said for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready so actually you're looking at the lamb praise God if the lamb in the Old Testament could cover how much more the lamb that was without spot without the limits are you with me the lamb that does not spot without the limits shattered his blood that you might be made the righteousness of God that he could take away every blemish of his spot never rank away from your life oh God amen is because you can be equally yoked you can be holy because I am Holy praise God how can you be holy it's because a holy God came praise God and Jesus was demanded amen he became the justifier he justified us amen by his own blood are you with me so for fornication that's before you get married committed the door to whosoever uh married her that's put away committed adultery isn't that right a mark 10 and 5. I know I'm getting over some some things giving you a lot of information Mark 10 and 5. God is good amen don't go around and I hear make a mistake and then you got to deal with it the rest of your life are you with me there's no excuse I don't know what the preacher's preaching and teaching but the Bible says in the days of Noah there was marriage and giving in marriage I know God no hadn't changed his mind about his word I know Jesus Christ the same yesterday and the daily forever I don't know what they're teaching out there and what they're preaching and what they believe in but I know whose report I believe I believe what the word said are you with me are you believing what the Bible say I don't care how great or how eloquent some preacher can tell you something believe what the word says God is hidden in his own word he's there no confusion Mark 10 and 5. and Jesus answered and said unto her them Moses gave him a bill and divorcement they said for the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept but from the what from the beginning of creation amen he made them male and female for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave into his wife and the twain shall be one flesh so then they are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God has joined together let not what in the house his disciples asked him again of this matter I hope you asking him again in this matter let me see if he's going to say anything different we make it a little plainer in case you didn't understand it in Matthew let me make it a little plainer are you with me 11. and he said unto them whosoever shall put away his what wife and married or what committed adultery what okay the man can but the woman can the mankind but the woman can't who give him a right to say something different from what the Bible say who has a right to say something different than what the Bible Well ah an interpretation uh who has a right to interpret the word different God mean what he says it's plain isn't that right why are we why are we going to add an interpretation to that is that right we don't need no interpretation it's right there plane isn't that right let me read it again and he said unto them whosoever shall what put away his wife and what um committed what and if a woman shall what and be married to what she what the church might not get full up y'all understand why people say I don't want nothing to do with Brett Simmons y'all stay away from mine him he'll mind you up you bind up to the word ain't nothing but you know what I'm saying people are afraid of the word they want to make excuse for doing what they want to do and then they want to blame brother Simmons for it are you up man don't blame me blame the word amen I'm just only saying what he said isn't that right well y'all believe bro oh it ain't nothing about me it's about the word somebody got enough backbone to say what he said he said so what I say I'm saying what he's saying the Bible let God be what let God Be True in there every man alive isn't that right but something oh Lord have mercy oh I don't want you to stand stand with the word don't worry about standing with me stand on your conviction if you don't believe it then that's up to you but I believe what the Bible say in Romans 7. I don't know what's going on you asked me why are you saying all these things brother Sim somebody might be getting ready to do something crazy brother just before you do it crazy you'll be with that excuse me are you with me let's see all the season says just before you backslide are you with me just before just before you do it he said no you're not Romans 71 no you're not brother if I speak to them that know the law how that the law has dominion over man so as long as he what liveth for the woman which has and husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he imma tell you if you if you're married to Christ you should as long as he lived are you a man and I believe he'd never die amen he died one time and it Rose in Victory praise God and you marry him there's no out there's no going back there nowhere I'm Gonna Leave Him because he said I'll never leave you I'll never leave you I never forsake you so you don't have to worry about it God will never let you down he'll never give up on you yeah you might give up on God but he'll never give up on you praise God hallelujah he'll love you in spider he'll forgive you and in spite of what you've done in spite of where you go and fighting your problems in spite of your condition you'll still be there he'll still be there he'll forgive me and say come on home come on Amen if you're willing just to repent and say God I'm sorry his hand is still sharp out there praise God he still welcome your home amen he loves you amen unconditionally I love you even though you make mistakes I still can't they meant my blood is sufficient my grace is sufficient for you praise God hallelujah I'm so glad he didn't give up on me let him at the minute I made a mistake or maybe I amen Lord have mercy sometimes you get in the valley of decisions sometimes but God's still there for you I'm glad I got a God that's faithful praise God I can always come to him I can always depend on him I can't depend on myself but God didn't make a mistake with his savior when he chose you he knew you oh Hallelujah oh this is what Apostle Paul said in second Thessalonians and the second chapter brother I'm so glad that God knows me better than I know myself amen sometimes we we doubt ourselves but God never doubted you praise God sometimes we gave up on ours but God never gave up on us amen when I when I had doubts and amen when I couldn't understand and that's the way I took amen sometimes we can't understand what we go to why are we going through what we're going through but God didn't give up on us amen I'm so glad second Thessalonians uh 2 and 13 but I'm going to read the uh he talks about the strong delusion the 11th verse it says but this calls God shall sin them strong delusion that they should believe a what I'm gonna tell you don't get caught up in those illusions amen I'm gonna tell you something I believe amen what's sucking the Earth right now is people are getting strong delusions that's why they they're on doing any kind of thing think it's all right amen and instead of the word of God being the husband the headship amen instead of being married to the word they're just doing anything because why because they think they can do it and get away with it they think they can do it and get by with it they can still sing and shout and go around the world and still preach the gospel baby that's the same as they'll praise the Lord and God I'm getting by with it but they're only in a delusion brother and sister don't you get caught up in an illusion don't you get caught up with everything is all right in your sins and doing all kind of wicked stuff and living all kind of ways don't you think you're gonna get by God I don't want to deceive myself I don't want to fool myself thinking I'm all right when I'm when I'm not brother and sister let's get real amen I want to I want to be real with you praise God Amen are you up man amen a lot of folk ain't gonna be real with you because they thinking they pity and you're feeling sorry for you I feel sorry for you too and I feel I appear to you but nevertheless I got to tell you the truth because truth is gonna work the truth gonna set you free anything else I'm just patting you on the back telling you it's all right you're going to be all right in the morning you're gonna be all right in hell nobody will tell you the truth amen don't you get blinded by amen making yourself all right yes you'll end up in the Lake of Fire thinking that it was all right thinking that you got by you ain't get by God you'll never get by God the World's Gonna face you at the end you're gonna stand up and say I gotta look the word in the eye and I got to tell God [Music] [Applause] when I look face to face with the word what I'm going to tell God sometimes people want to make the prophet to Allah oh he said oh no it's what the word said well yeah yeah you know try to twist it to make it say something that he ain't say oh you want me Reverend sister you better go back to this Bible as a man I can make a mistake any man can make a mistake but the word of God is what you building your that's who you married to the word Jesus Christ who is the word in the beginning what the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh you're married to this Bible this is your husband are you with me no no man not me not no man not Peter not Paul not a prophet it's Jesus Christ that's your husband he's the word are you up man that's what it means see we put our confidence on her he said they said who said the word what do I say it about it what did Jesus say about what did the word say let's get caught up you can't prove it by the Bible then we just need to be quiet because you got one husband you don't got my one voice you listen to and that's the voice of the word amen brothers and sisters people ah this will say that and that would say that that it's all right all of them saying what they want to say but you stick with the word oh Lord that's why people get strong illusions and that's why they believe Allah oh yes sister brother you young you going to be able just a pan you you know nothing you do like that

understand that it's a great Revelation yeah it's a revelation you keep your revelation amen I'ma believe this is plain truth tell the truth just tell it plain just I just want to hear it playing don't make it so mystified what the Bible say about it well I'm gonna show you what the product I want to see what the Bible's saying is it all right with the word people tell you all kind of stuff
