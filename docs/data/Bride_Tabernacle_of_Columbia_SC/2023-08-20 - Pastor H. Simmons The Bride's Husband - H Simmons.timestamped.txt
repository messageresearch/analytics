[38:48] in the days of Sodom thus shall it be

[39:09] we're just praying that God would be
[39:11] merciful and wrath remember Mercy
[39:14] God have mercy
[39:16] God have mercy
[39:18] Revelation 19 7.
[39:22] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[39:24] honor to him
[39:26] for the marriage of the Lamb has come
[39:28] and his wife has made what
[39:32] herself ready
[39:35] to be seated for now God bless the
[39:37] reading this word
[39:38] his wife has made her separated
[39:42] and to her was granted day for in her
[39:46] into her was granted that she should be
[39:48] arraigned and find the linen clean and
[39:51] white for the fine lineness the
[39:53] righteousness of the Saints
[39:55] and he said unto me writing blessed are
[39:59] they which are called into the marriage
[40:01] supper of the Lamb
[40:03] and he said unto me
[40:07] these are the true Sands of God
[40:12] and I failed at defeat
[40:15] to worship Him
[40:19] and he said
[40:21] unto me see thou doeth not for I am what
[40:27] that fellow servant and of thy brethren
[40:31] so sometimes we think it's a
[40:33] supernatural I mean a spiritual Angel
[40:36] but he says I'm on your brethren
[40:39] are you with me
[40:41] that have the testimony of Jesus worship
[40:45] of who
[40:46] worship God for the testimony of Jesus
[40:49] is the spirit of what uh prophecy
[40:54] and I saw heaven open and behold a white
[40:58] horse and he that setteth upon him was
[41:03] called what
[41:04] faithful and what faithful and true
[41:08] and in it in righteousness he does judge
[41:12] and make war his eyes were as a flame of
[41:16] fire and on his head were many crowns
[41:19] and he had a name written that no man
[41:23] knew but he himself and he was clothed
[41:27] with the vexed dip in blood how many
[41:30] know who that is

[42:21] and thread The Wine Press of the
[42:24] pureness of the Wrath of the almighty
[42:27] God
[42:28] are you with me
[42:30] things are happening in
[42:32] now
[42:35] but people's eyes are closed to what's
[42:38] going on
[42:40] he said and he said uh
[42:43] and he had on his vesture
[42:47] and on his thigh a name written what
[42:53] they read what
[42:56] and what
[42:58] king of kings and Lord of lords
[43:01] are you with me
[43:03] see one time it was one time in history
[43:06] that Jesus came on the scene and they
[43:09] was expecting him to rule with a wrought
[43:11] iron
[43:12] they was expecting him to be the king
[43:14] the Messiah but he came amen
[43:19] humbly as the Lamb of God
[43:23] to take away the sins of the world
[43:25] yet the expectation was up so high
[43:29] that it was looking for him to
[43:31] amen take over amen and Rule
[43:37] with the wrong hands
[43:39] instead of coming in church man he came
[43:41] in Mercy
[43:44] are you with me
[43:46] amen
[43:47] the world Amen at this time amen is
[43:51] coming to his end

[43:58] him if we'd have read on down you would
[44:00] have seen
[44:04] the world is getting ready for the
[44:06] battle
[44:09] though not dog and Magog and Russia and
[44:12] all of those are getting ready for the
[44:14] great battle of Armageddon
[44:18] United States might think they're ready
[44:20] for the battle
[44:24] but it won't be long
[44:26] but before that battle takes place
[44:30] something got to happen
[44:34] you must recognize Who You Are
[44:38] I believe God has chosen himself
[44:41] a word bride
[44:44] this morning I'm talking about
[44:46] the bride husband
[44:50] I'm not so much as putting emphasis on
[44:52] the husband as I'm putting emphasis on
[44:54] the white this morning
[44:57] the bride
[44:59] the Lamb's wife
[45:01] are you with me
[45:04] so if we look at Revelation 21 and 9
[45:08] I started going and I said
[45:12] if I was a teacher I would be gone for
[45:14] hours
[45:18] sometimes teachers got a way of showing
[45:20] their intellect
[45:24] preachers try to you know preach
[45:27] that people might come convicted
[45:32] God is good to us
[45:34] the word
[45:36] must be a precept upon precept line upon
[45:39] line here a little there a little amen
[45:42] what you what we want you to have is an
[45:44] understanding of Who You Are
[45:48] amen he said in all I get and get
[45:50] understanding
[45:52] amen
[45:54] he said my people are destroyed because
[45:56] of lack of knowledge
[45:58] but if you know who you are amen you can
[46:02] even become
[46:06] what God's how God saw you
[46:09] before the world began
[46:12] he saw you and he plays your name in the
[46:15] last book of life before the foundation
[46:18] of the world
[46:19] are you up there
[46:20] but you must amen get a revelation
[46:24] or who you are or the devil make you
[46:27] anything
[46:29] but once you have a revelation in it's
[46:33] been revealed to you who you are
[46:36] amen the devil can't touch you because
[46:39] you have a revelation
[46:42] in that revelational uh even the gates
[46:45] of hell should not Prevail against you
[46:49] you notice I didn't say it against hell
[46:51] should not Prevail against the church
[46:53] but I'm against you
[46:58] amen because you know who the church is
[47:02] amen
[47:04] Revelation 21 and 9 it says
[47:14] that that came unto me one of the seven
[47:17] angels
[47:18] which had the seven vows
[47:21] full of
[47:23] the seventh last plagues and talk with
[47:28] me saying come here I will show what
[47:33] I'll show Thee the bride
[47:38] the what
[47:40] the Lamb's wife
[47:42] and see I said
[47:45] the bride husband
[47:50] oftentimes we talk about the bride
[47:53] husband
[47:56] the bride
[47:59] Adam's bride
[48:02] was the mystery of Adam being revealed
[48:08] are you with me
[48:09] because Adam broad was hid in Adam
[48:14] are y'all with me
[48:18] Eve was hid
[48:20] and Adam
[48:22] and Eve was a mystery of Adam being
[48:26] revealed
[48:31] that makes sense
[48:34] because she was here amen
[48:40] they can see he
[48:43] because she was still in Adam
[48:47] are you with me
[48:51] but when he was taken out of Adam
[48:58] she was still part of Adam
[49:02] are you with me
[49:04] but she came forward to do something
[49:07] amen the Bible said be fruitful and what
[49:12] so she was to reproduce Adam
[49:18] are you up man
[49:20] not something else
[49:22] amen
[49:24] praise God
[49:27] so by the grace of God we want you to
[49:30] know your purpose
[49:34] I show you the bride
[49:37] the Lamb's wife she had to be fruitful
[49:41] and to multiply
[49:44] amen now notice Corinthians tell us that
[49:48] uh Jesus is the last what
[49:52] Adam isn't that right
[49:56] the bright husband
[49:58] maybe I'm gonna skip over some things I
[50:01] go right to
[50:03] um Second Corinthians
[50:09] second Corinthians 11
[50:17] God is good amen
[50:21] he said what to God that get back with
[50:23] me a little while in my Folly and indeed
[50:25] bear with me before I've espoused you to
[50:27] what
[50:29] I'm jealous over you regardless jealous
[50:33] for I've inspired you to what
[50:36] one husband
[50:38] are you up man
[50:41] see if you don't know who your husband
[50:43] is
[50:46] are you a man
[50:47] yo the
[50:49] praise God
[50:51] as much as
[50:55] the husband
[50:57] must know by revelation
[51:00] it must be revealed to him who his wife
[51:03] is
[51:05] and I know the husband don't make no
[51:07] mistakes
[51:10] amen
[51:11] for who he knows
[51:15] them that are his
[51:19] are you a man
[51:21] but the wife also must have a revelation
[51:24] of who her husband is
[51:27] you must not be confused
[51:32] are you with me
[51:34] because without a revelation
[51:37] or who you're not
[51:40] you're married the wrong person
[51:44] are you with me
[51:46] you're married off of other things
[51:48] without revelation
[51:51] you're married off of fleshly sensation
[51:54] and not revelation
[51:58] you need to have a revelation
[52:05] of who
[52:07] your husband is
[52:11] the bride husband
[52:13] without that revelation
[52:16] praise God
[52:17] you're going to make a shipwreck of your
[52:19] life
[52:21] a lot of people are
[52:24] are looking to the church and they're
[52:27] looking to men and they'll look at the
[52:29] other things instead of getting a
[52:32] revelation
[52:34] or who your husband is
[52:39] people mixed up did they
[52:43] that's why we're having so much so many
[52:45] problems
[52:46] he said I'll expose you to one husband
[52:50] that I may present you as a chaste
[52:53] virgin in the Christ
[52:57] but I fear at least by any means as the
[53:01] serpent beguiled Eve through his utility
[53:04] he got Eve to adopt the word
[53:09] are you with me
[53:11] you must know
[53:15] praise God
[53:18] who your husband is
[53:22] and you need to be Sergeant unto him
[53:27] are you with me
[53:30] because he loves you
[53:33] enough to die for you
[53:37] are you with me
[53:39] I'm taking my time because I know I'm
[53:42] just going to start this
[53:44] I want to just make it a series and just
[53:46] go
[53:47] but
[53:49] I'm finding out people over so confused
[53:54] people are just so confused they go to
[53:56] church but they're completely
[53:58] confused
[54:02] they're looking for something outwardly
[54:04] instead of looking for to know God
[54:07] themselves personally
[54:11] and that the spirit of God reveals
[54:14] in it himself to you as an individual
[54:20] to have that personal relationship with
[54:23] God almighty
[54:25] I'm too you know I say preachers

[54:32] call you to preachers that preach the
[54:34] word

[55:23] but if you got the Holy Ghost you're
[55:25] gonna preach the word

[55:31] spirit

[1:23:20] as a Chris
[1:23:21] you want to do it tonight
[1:23:24] don't get baptized in your clothes
[1:23:27] so we took him down
[1:23:29] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:32] with his clothes on you had to deal with
[1:23:35] the wet clothes
[1:23:36] but he went down in the name of the Lord
[1:23:38] Jesus Christ
[1:23:40] I'm saying this morning

[1:24:04] coming
[1:24:05] locking girls and boys liking boys and
[1:24:09] all kind of things are happening because
[1:24:10] they refuse to give their life to Jesus
[1:24:16] don't you miss out on your opportunity
[1:24:19] people are looking for
[1:24:21] looking for happiness in in the games
[1:24:23] and
[1:24:24] they know and guns and in violence
[1:24:29] because they don't have Jesus
[1:24:32] because they turn them down
[1:24:35] you'll have an opportunity not to turn
[1:24:37] Jesus down
[1:24:39] we may not have enough clothes for all
[1:24:41] of y'all
[1:24:43] but get baptized in your clothes
[1:24:46] this morning if that's what God is doing
[1:24:49] if he's calling you
[1:24:52] come on to Jesus this morning
[1:24:54] don't leave here in the condition that
[1:24:57] you were in
[1:25:00] but the Bible says to repent
[1:25:04] repent
[1:25:06] give up the world
[1:25:09] Surrender Your Life to him
[1:25:11] ask God to forgive you
[1:25:13] and accept him as your savior
[1:25:17] Lord I want to go to Glory

[1:25:36] Jesus I want I I want Jesus
[1:25:40] you'll hear this morning
[1:25:43] in our hearts let us stand
[1:25:45] as Caleb and Josh plays and sings
[1:25:54] that there's no excuses
[1:25:58] for the call of God
[1:26:01] there's no excuses
[1:26:05] no excuses
[1:26:08] every excuse has been nailed to the
[1:26:10] cross
[1:26:12] no reason why you shouldn't accept him
[1:26:16] as our heads about
[1:26:18] father in Jesus name
[1:26:25] will there be one this morning
[1:26:30] double repent of your sins
[1:26:34] be baptized in water
[1:26:37] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:26:41] for the remission of sin

[1:26:47] that has a made-up mind
[1:26:51] I want to make Heaven my home I want to
[1:26:53] be a Christian
[1:26:55] I don't want to be a gangbanger
[1:26:59] I don't want to be caught out there in
[1:27:01] the rain
[1:27:01] [Music]
[1:27:03] when the floods of storms of life rich
[1:27:06] when the floods are coming and the world

[1:27:32] life
[1:27:34] father in Jesus name
[1:27:37] but these that have lifted their hands
[1:27:39] and opened their hearts
[1:27:41] make something come into them and
[1:27:44] energize their faith that was God's term
[1:27:47] up
[1:27:49] God never give them more grace to run
[1:27:52] this race
