[29:56] we want to look at the book of genesis
[29:59] 40 tonight
[30:04] by god's grace
[30:13] genesis 40.
[30:32] and we'll begin at the
[30:38] let's begin at the 16th verse
[30:46] the story of joseph in the baker and the
[30:50] butler
[30:51] the dream we'll begin at 16th first he
[30:53] says
[30:54] well let's let's move up a little bit in
[30:56] the ninth verse
[30:59] and the chief butler told his dream to
[31:02] joseph and said unto
[31:03] and said to him in my dream behold a
[31:06] vine was before me
[31:07] and in a vine there were three branches
[31:09] and it was as though it was butted
[31:11] and the blossoms shot forth and the
[31:13] clusters thereof
[31:14] brought forth right grapes and pharaoh's
[31:16] cup was in my hand
[31:18] and i took the grapes and pressed him
[31:20] into pharaoh's cup
[31:21] and gave the gave the cup unto pharaoh's
[31:25] hand
[31:26] and joseph said unto him this is an
[31:28] interpretation of it
[31:29] three branches are three days yet within
[31:32] three days
[31:33] shall pharaoh lift up thine head and
[31:35] restore unto thee
[31:37] unto that and restore thee unto thy
[31:39] place
[31:40] and thou shall deliver pharaoh's cup
[31:44] into his hand after the former manner
[31:46] and when thou
[31:48] was a form of manner when thou
[31:51] was his butler but think on me
[31:54] when it shall be well with thee and show
[31:57] kindness i pray unto me
[31:59] and make mention of me unto pharaoh and
[32:03] bring me out of this house
[32:04] for indeed i was stolen away
[32:08] out of the land of the hebrews and here
[32:11] also i have done nothing
[32:12] and that they should put me into the
[32:14] dungeon you may be seated
[32:17] i want to skip down a little bit to
[32:21] the 20th verse and it reads
[32:24] and it came to pass the third day which
[32:27] was joseph's birthday that he made a
[32:30] feast
[32:31] unto unto all his servants and he lifted
[32:35] up the head of the chief butler and the
[32:36] chief baker among his servants
[32:38] and he restored the chief butler unto
[32:40] his butlership again
[32:41] and he gave the cup into pharaoh's hand
[32:44] but he hanged the chief
[32:45] baker as joseph had interpreted to them
[32:49] yet did not the chief butler remember
[32:52] joseph but forgot him may god had bless
[32:55] your reading of his word
[32:56] tonight by god's grace just for our
[32:58] moment i want to
[33:00] speak to you just for a little something
[33:02] that was on my heart
[33:03] and i entitled it remember me amen
[33:07] remember me and i look looking here how
[33:10] how um joseph here in the 14th verse
[33:13] he was saying you know telling the chief
[33:16] butler he's saying you know you're going
[33:18] to be restored you know they both were
[33:20] in a bad
[33:21] place and and down in the dungeon the
[33:23] bible says and
[33:25] that he says you know he says that
[33:27] you're gonna be restored but
[33:29] you know it must have been a pretty bad
[33:30] in that place because
[33:32] you know joseph even in himself he's
[33:34] looking at the the butler
[33:36] and he's saying you know but when you
[33:37] get out of here he says remember me
[33:40] he says don't forget about me you know
[33:43] sometimes
[33:44] we find ourselves in places
[33:47] that that are dark or in low spots and
[33:50] and nevertheless you know we want to be
[33:53] remembered
[33:54] sometimes i like how joseph brought it
[33:57] out he says even i ain't even done
[33:59] nothing even be in this place
[34:01] he says but you know remember me maybe
[34:03] he was in his
[34:04] like they called it the juniper tree
[34:06] experience the way he's
[34:07] nothing looked like it was going right
[34:09] for him but one thing he did do he
[34:11] stayed faithful
[34:12] so i rem i was looking at you know in
[34:15] the age that we live in i says
[34:17] you know when you look around
[34:20] everybody's going through something
[34:22] everybody you talk to somewhat they say
[34:25] remember me
[34:26] in prayer or remember me i was telling a
[34:29] brother charles jr the other day i said
[34:30] you know
[34:31] you always seem to be in in a mode where
[34:35] you have to uplift
[34:36] everyone he says when when one person
[34:39] ain't going through you get that person
[34:41] uplifted
[34:42] then all of a sudden the devil is
[34:44] messing with this one
[34:45] so you get that one uplifted then here
[34:47] come the devil
[34:48] and that says what it is it's always
[34:51] going to be something
[34:52] you know and what it and you say what is
[34:55] it we know that
[34:56] it is the devil but i said as i was
[34:58] talking to a guy at work the other day
[35:01] he was saying you know ernest just
[35:03] looking at certain things and positions
[35:05] and
[35:05] certain things that you're capable of
[35:07] and he was saying you know what i would
[35:09] do
[35:10] i would throw i would throw my weight
[35:12] around i would do this and that
[35:13] and i says you know that's the mind
[35:16] frame as i told him of a lot of people
[35:18] but i says you never take an account of
[35:21] the position just because you up
[35:24] and you can do a person a certain way
[35:26] because they're in a certain position or
[35:27] they down
[35:28] i says because tomorrow might change
[35:32] i said you might wake up tomorrow i said
[35:34] if i'd done
[35:35] certain things act certain ways i said i
[35:37] could wake up tomorrow
[35:39] and i could not even have no knowledge
[35:41] of these things
[35:42] i said that's why i don't look at people
[35:45] and take an account for where they are
[35:47] because the only reason why they're
[35:49] there and i'm not there is by the grace
[35:51] of god
[35:52] so we we learn to to think that way that
[35:56] you know i says that what it is
[35:59] everybody going through something faced
[36:02] with something
[36:03] want to be remembered you know remember
[36:05] me don't forget about me i see joseph
[36:07] say that
[36:08] remember me don't forget about me and i
[36:10] that thought i said you know jesus
[36:12] when he came he says i i come to amend
[36:15] the brokenhearted to preach
[36:17] you know deliverance to the captives
[36:19] that the the
[36:20] the blind might receive their sight in
[36:22] these things jesus
[36:24] he came to to uh uh deliver those
[36:27] because he knew that
[36:29] as a preacher one time a world in pain
[36:31] that people would
[36:32] they would be in that place to go
[36:33] through something that they would be
[36:35] going through something
[36:36] but nevertheless in the in the age or in
[36:39] that place where the people's going
[36:41] through something
[36:42] he's the only answer for the world today
[36:44] how many believe that
[36:46] so you know i was at work and i was
[36:48] telling my wife i said you know
[36:50] something strange happened i says i was
[36:53] getting ready to leave working
[36:54] in the break room i seen i was one of
[36:56] the guys at work he was
[36:58] you know moving all around and he he was
[37:00] in obvious pain
[37:02] like like obvious pain and i says
[37:06] i says hey denzel i said you all right
[37:09] man
[37:09] he said man i got these kidney stones
[37:11] real bad
[37:12] and he says that i says well they can't
[37:15] crushing me he says that he said they
[37:16] said that they was too small or
[37:18] something why
[37:19] they couldn't crush him or whatever he
[37:20] just would have to pass him but he's
[37:22] been battling them for a while but
[37:24] you know it's an obvious pain and i know
[37:26] i had him before
[37:27] kidney stones before and i can i can
[37:29] identify with the pain
[37:31] but as i seen him in that pain i heard
[37:34] i heard something say to me uh lay your
[37:37] hands on them
[37:38] at the job right there in the break room
[37:40] something said lay your hands on them
[37:42] and i was i didn't i was a little
[37:44] nervous and then i heard something say
[37:46] to me
[37:46] didn't i say lay hands on the sick and
[37:48] they shall recover
[37:50] and as it said that i asked him i said
[37:52] you mind if i laid hands on you
[37:54] and prayed with you he looked up at me
[37:56] kind of strange
[37:58] he said yeah go ahead so i laid hands on
[38:01] him
[38:02] and began to pray with him right there
[38:05] and
[38:05] as i got done praying i asked him i said
[38:08] now do you believe in that
[38:09] he said i believe it's a higher power
[38:11] out there so
[38:13] i talked with him a little bit but when
[38:15] i seen him again
[38:17] i was telling my wife them he was around
[38:19] there dancing and everything
[38:21] i said denzel what happened he said oh
[38:24] ernest
[38:25] he said i went home and i passed him
[38:26] that same day
[38:28] yeah i said i said well thank the lord
[38:32] and i said you must be feeling mighty
[38:33] good because you out here dancing
[38:35] he said you did it ernest i said no no
[38:38] no no
[38:39] i didn't do it i said the lord did it i
[38:41] said because he told us he made us a
[38:43] promise that if we lay hands on a sick
[38:46] that they shall recover i said so he
[38:48] done it
[38:49] i says it's all in him and i said and i
[38:52] asked him i said now
[38:54] i said you want to go you're going to go
[38:56] to the doctor to make sure all i'm gone
[38:57] he looked at me and said uh-uh don't
[38:59] speak that on
[39:00] me he said don't speak that on me he
[39:02] said you you prayed and that's it
[39:04] it's over with and i thought about
[39:06] myself i said look at me trying to put
[39:08] trying to put these things back on him
[39:10] but what it is
[39:12] don't you know god is that real you know
[39:15] it was something it was a rebuke to me
[39:17] that god had to say that twice to me
[39:20] you know he says didn't i say lay hands
[39:24] on a sick
[39:24] and they shall recover do you know what
[39:27] that does
[39:28] that's a testimony to our faith that is
[39:31] not
[39:31] in you feeling i got to feel this of
[39:34] power no it's
[39:35] in you being in position and being
[39:39] willing
[39:40] to not be ashamed of the gospel come on
[39:42] because sometimes we're ashamed of the
[39:44] gospel
[39:45] i'm at work and all these things but
[39:47] when god tell you to do something
[39:49] then you move at all costs and watch
[39:52] god back it up i believe that with all
[39:55] of my heart
[39:56] how many believe that but he says
[39:59] you know i say is what it is you know i
[40:00] was thinking about that because my mind
[40:02] was already on that in that way i said
[40:04] everybody's got something
[40:05] everybody's dealing with something you
[40:08] know the world is hurting right now
[40:10] come on and what i was i was telling
[40:13] somebody
[40:14] i almost called a name the other day i
[40:16] says you know
[40:17] it's a lot we got to deal with it's
[40:19] demons
[40:20] fighting people battling and i said look
[40:23] what you called me to talk to me about
[40:25] i said this is nothing come on i said it
[40:28] don't mean nothing
[40:30] i said people are losing their souls
[40:32] people are hurting
[40:33] people need prayer come on and i said we
[40:35] don't have time to do that
[40:37] come on i said but what it is we got to
[40:39] be about our father's business
[40:41] i said i don't know about you but that's
[40:43] what i want to be i don't want to i
[40:45] don't want nothing
[40:46] in the way but when god asks me to move
[40:48] i want to be right with god
[40:50] so he can use me anywhere at any time
[40:52] come on
[40:53] not just saying you but i want to see
[40:55] people delivered
[40:56] i seen that that brother in pain and i
[40:59] know what that pain was like
[41:01] and sometimes you know we can't uh
[41:04] identify with the pain that
[41:06] people going through and that's why we
[41:08] don't extend to him
[41:09] but sometimes that's why i look at
[41:11] joseph and things that he went through
[41:14] sometimes god allows you to go through
[41:16] things
[41:17] then you'll know how to appreciate when
[41:20] you own the mountaintop
[41:21] because you've been down in the valley
[41:23] long enough hallelujah
[41:25] you've been through enough hurt and
[41:27] you've been through pain that when you
[41:29] see somebody else going through
[41:30] you can identify with them you can get
[41:33] in there suffering
[41:34] and you can say brother sister i know
[41:37] what you're going through
[41:38] so when you pray for him hallelujah i
[41:41] like that how it says that
[41:42] christ he was he was tested and tried
[41:45] just like a man from every angle that's
[41:48] why the bible says
[41:49] he can be touched by the feelings of our
[41:52] infirmities
[41:53] he knows what we're going through when
[41:55] he sees the
[41:56] the the pain that we're in he can
[41:59] identify with that pain
[42:00] hallelujah and he can get down where
[42:03] you're at and get right in there and
[42:05] bear those burdens
[42:06] he can say cast all your carols upon me
[42:09] because i care for you
[42:10] it's nothing like somebody praying for
[42:12] you that know what you're going through
[42:14] that they've been there they can get
[42:16] down in prayer for you and get a
[42:18] breakthrough
[42:19] lord pull them through hallelujah how
[42:21] many believe that
[42:23] so that's what we do we look at the
[42:25] trials that we go through come on
[42:27] and we don't complain why me hallelujah
[42:30] but when god brings us through then
[42:32] you're looking to testify
[42:34] that you can tell somebody else that if
[42:37] god
[42:37] did it for me then i know that god will
[42:40] do it for you
[42:41] if god can save me hallelujah then he
[42:43] can save anybody
[42:45] if he came i like that song and a sister
[42:47] saying
[42:48] she says maybe you never felt lost and
[42:50] alone
[42:51] or one day that a burning hell would be
[42:54] your home
[42:55] maybe you never felt that you needed
[42:57] someone to set you free
[42:59] but i know hallelujah i'm one of those
[43:02] that needed him and he might have not
[43:04] done it for you but he did it for me
[43:05] hallelujah
[43:07] and i can identify with the struggles
[43:09] and the pain that you're going through
[43:11] hallelujah
[43:13] how many thank the lord tonight that we
[43:15] serve a god
[43:16] that don't just sit high and he ain't
[43:18] been there he said but i've been there
[43:20] i know what it's like to be persecuted i
[43:22] know what it's like to be
[43:23] talked about and be spit on to be
[43:26] rejected
[43:27] by your own people come on somebody says
[43:29] my own family
[43:30] rejecting me god know what that's like
[43:32] come on they talking about me jesus
[43:34] knows what that's like
[43:36] they rejecting me jesus knows what
[43:38] that's like hallelujah
[43:40] he says walk that lonely road how many
[43:42] feel that way tonight

[43:49] how many want to be remembered tonight i
[43:52] says that we can be remembered by a lot
[43:54] of people
[43:55] but to be remembered by god come on you
[43:58] know he says that
[43:59] you engraved in the palm of his hand
[44:01] come on he

[44:37] says that if the seed of god is in there
[44:39] no matter what condition they're in you
[44:41] can see those shackles falling off
[44:43] you see those demon powers they got to
[44:45] give way
[44:46] to the name of jesus thank the lord for
[44:49] that
[44:50] what i said is what it is remember me i
[44:52] said you know
[44:53] everybody want to be remembered you know
[44:56] but we find joseph i i just sitting
[44:59] there meditating on joseph

[45:17] am
[45:18] come on he said i was stolen away but
[45:20] one thing i like about joseph and all of
[45:22] that
[45:23] he still was faithful to god god i don't
[45:26] understand why i'm in this place right
[45:28] now
[45:29] i don't understand why i got to go
[45:31] through this pain right now
[45:33] but i do know one thing imma stay
[45:35] faithful
[45:36] because i know that one day you'll see
[45:37] me out of here one day
[45:39] you'll remember me hallelujah and when
[45:42] god
[45:43] remembers you i like how joseph when his
[45:45] brothers and them came to him
[45:47] he says no it wasn't you that done that
[45:49] come on he said but it was god
[45:51] the whole time god put me in that place
[45:55] god placed him in that place he said he
[45:57] sent me here
[45:58] but before you to do what he says that a
[46:01] lot of lies can be saved today
[46:03] i went through all of it for the glory
[46:05] of god come on
[46:06] he can look back and see that it wasn't
[46:08] wasn't them but it was god
[46:11] the whole time how many want to how many
[46:13] can look back over what you're going
[46:15] through come on
[46:16] it might be hurting in pain right now
[46:18] but come on it was god come on
[46:20] god wants to use you god wants to use
[46:23] your testimony because somebody else
[46:24] somebody gonna struggle and
[46:26] they'll break hallelujah because they
[46:29] ain't strong enough sometimes you say it
[46:31] that like that
[46:32] but when they hear what god done for you
[46:36] that gives them strength to go on i
[46:38] believe is power
[46:39] in your testimony i believe your
[46:42] testimony got power in it
[46:44] that it's going to be something come on
[46:47] to
[46:47] to help someone to get from where
[46:49] they're at how many believe that tonight
[46:52] but we find that i says i says remember
[46:54] me come on
[46:56] you know what it is you know like we
[46:59] said
[46:59] maybe joseph was in that you know in a
[47:02] juniper tree or whatever experience
[47:04] so we find that eve but even in that
[47:06] like i said he was still faithful and we
[47:08] find ourselves
[47:10] from from i believe that from the pulpit
[47:12] to the back door we all find ourselves
[47:14] into those places you know i believe it
[47:17] was nehemiah
[47:18] and one of those uh forget who which one
[47:20] was what he says
[47:22] he says lord he says enlarge my
[47:24] territory
[47:25] god i want you to bless me come on
[47:27] because away is faced with so we
[47:29] we find ourselves in those places
[47:31] sometime
[47:32] where we're reaching out come on lord as
[47:35] you forgot about me
[47:37] come on what about me lord
[47:41] what everybody else around me and
[47:43] sometimes you
[47:44] you look say everybody prospering hey
[47:46] remember me
[47:47] come on in prayer but god ain't forgot
[47:49] about you
[47:50] i thought about john the baptist and how
[47:53] you know
[47:54] it was something how when he even after
[47:56] he baptized jesus and
[47:58] jesus went on and getting his own
[48:00] disciples and doing his own things and
[48:02] his disciples came up to him and said
[48:04] john the one that you
[48:06] baptized look at him he got people just
[48:08] paraphrasing it falling behind him
[48:10] come on and baptizing and all like that
[48:14] it's that's so to say he ain't even
[48:16] recognizing you
[48:17] you you open the way for a made the way
[48:20] and he don't even
[48:21] they don't even remembering you come on
[48:23] sometimes it feel that way
[48:25] but john rebuked he says did not i tell
[48:28] you come on
[48:29] dad he was the one he says the the the
[48:33] bridegroom
[48:34] the one who has the bride is the
[48:35] bridegroom he said he must increase as i
[48:38] must decrease
[48:39] it ain't about me come on i served my
[48:42] purpose
[48:43] god ain't forgot about me come on i did
[48:45] what god
[48:46] asked me to do it's not about me get
[48:48] that out your minds hallelujah
[48:50] but it's about him but yet we find
[48:53] even john when he went down into the
[48:56] prison
[48:57] you know i believe he might have got a
[48:59] little discouraged or
[49:01] confused that i'm in prison and jesus
[49:04] didn't even come visit me come on
[49:06] down in his place he said ask him is he
[49:09] the one
[49:09] or shall we look for another come on
[49:12] maybe wanting to be remembered
[49:14] but john jesus began to let him know
[49:18] the disciples i ain't forgot about him
[49:20] go show john
[49:21] the things you see me doing come on and
[49:24] he'll be able to
[49:25] identify what i'm doing hallelujah he
[49:27] says i tell you what you go to see
[49:29] a reed shaking in the wind come on
[49:32] or just this and that no he said a
[49:35] prophet
[49:36] he said no but i tell you greater than
[49:38] that
[49:39] he says that there was no man born of a
[49:41] woman greater
[49:42] than john the baptist you go tell him i
[49:45] ain't forgot about him hallelujah
[49:47] but i remember him and one day i
[49:49] believed
[49:50] hallelujah that john can go down in
[49:53] victory
[49:54] knowing that like like the brother
[49:56] senator said the other day he ran his
[49:57] race he finished his course
[49:59] like paul he can go down in victory
[50:01] hallelujah it's not my legacy
[50:04] but the legacy is christ it's not what i
[50:07] can do
[50:08] or what i've done but all what
[50:11] he can do what he has done for me
[50:14] hallelujah
[50:15] i can only stand before you because of
[50:16] what he's doing i can only testify
[50:19] because of what he done he could have
[50:21] left me in the muck in the mirror clay
[50:23] he could have left me in my sin and
[50:24] shame but he decided
[50:27] hallelujah that i'll choose him and i'm
[50:30] glad that god done that
[50:32] how many glad that god done that but i
[50:34] said that's what it is
[50:36] you know we don't look at what we've
[50:39] done
[50:40] or what we've achieved come on but
[50:43] it's all because of what he allowed if
[50:46] god didn't allow it it wouldn't be done
[50:49] if god didn't save you you wouldn't be
[50:51] saved
[50:52] you know he could take your voice he can
[50:55] do all these things
[50:56] but god allowed it we're walking how by
[50:59] the grace of god
[51:01] but i says tonight remember me come on
[51:03] when you're down in those places
[51:05] sometimes you want to be remembered come
[51:08] on but i want to say tonight

[54:19] uh definitely been a leadership of the
[54:21] spirit i can see it in
[54:23] everything from plane trip down here and
[54:26] i was telling the brother i was with
[54:28] group five and then the second plane i
[54:30] was with group seven
[54:31] and and i was just seeing how the lord
[54:33] has been with it ever since
[54:35] uh i've been here so i'm just happy to
[54:37] be here
[54:38] appreciate what i've been uh what i just
[54:40] heard i got this um
[54:42] thing on my arm when i went to see
[54:45] noah's ark they got in kentucky
[54:47] and i've been wearing it ever since and
[54:49] it's called god remembered noah and i
[54:52] just thought it was funny that he just
[54:53] preached this message called god
[54:55] remember me and i've been wearing this
[54:56] this whole time
[54:58] so i know that that message definitely
[55:00] was for me
[55:01] and that encouraged me it's just so
[55:04] amazing
[55:05] it doesn't it keeps happening over and
[55:06] over so it's nothing new but
[55:08] it always touches you know when god is
[55:10] speaking directly to you
[55:12] when the message is personally to you
[55:14] not just something you're hearing
[55:16] and so i knew that that was uh
[55:18] definitely for me
[55:19] and i definitely appreciated it and it
[55:22] definitely blessed me and encouraged me
[55:24] and so
[55:25] um i'm just happy to be here and it's
[55:27] nice to meet you all
[55:28] god bless you i thought you're gonna
[55:31] tell a little bit of your testimony you
[55:33] got a little time tonight
[55:35] brother ernest was short oh okay i don't
[55:38] mind
[55:38] um so um
[55:42] everything kind of started with uh
[55:45] just god just dealing with me from time
[55:48] i was a young man
[55:50] when i uh was around 11 years old my dad
[55:53] gave me a book it was a blue book he had
[55:56] from the 80s and
[55:58] it was falling apart he just made this
[56:01] book sound so mysterious it really
[56:02] pricked my 11 year old mind
[56:05] and i'm like wow what is this book my
[56:06] dad talking about
[56:08] and um it was a real it was an old blue
[56:11] book it was the church age book
[56:13] and um so i was reading it and reading
[56:16] it and i remember
[56:17] like what in the world am i reading and
[56:20] um
[56:21] so i kind of left it alone but i never
[56:23] forgot about it
[56:24] and then um i remember as i started to
[56:27] get older and guys start dealing with me
[56:29] and
[56:30] you know i just started praying and
[56:32] reading my bible and thought it would be
[56:34] interesting to just start reading and
[56:36] reading
[56:37] and i can't really explain how it
[56:39] happened god just put a hunger and
[56:40] thirst in my heart to want to
[56:42] know more about him and read you know i
[56:44] grew up in a household where my dad
[56:46] definitely believed in god and
[56:48] always uh taught us how to pray and
[56:52] would tell us the scriptures
[56:53] and you know but um so as i got older
[56:57] and god started dealing with me
[56:59] um i'm just trying to remember
[57:01] everything uh
[57:03] so i started reading my bible and
[57:06] everything started praying and um
[57:09] i was as god started dealing with me
[57:11] more and more i'm reading the bible i'm
[57:12] getting into it i'm praying
[57:14] and i was like wasn't there a book my
[57:16] dad told me about when i was younger
[57:18] and um i was like yeah so i went
[57:22] downstairs to go grab it
[57:24] and i went and grabbed that book and it
[57:26] was the church age book and i started
[57:27] reading the church age book and reading
[57:29] my bible together
[57:30] and i just remember how important
[57:32] brother branham kept on saying in the
[57:34] church book how important
[57:36] revelation was he said revelation and
[57:38] you have to have the holy ghost
[57:40] you have to have the spirit and um he
[57:43] said it's the importance of revelation
[57:44] to
[57:45] the believer can never be overemphasized
[57:48] like he was saying you have to have your
[57:49] own
[57:49] individual revelation and uh and i'm
[57:53] just
[57:53] a young man in my early 20s and i was
[57:56] like
[57:57] just reading it and so instead of just
[57:59] reading my bible i would really learn to
[58:02] not just read i would really get down
[58:03] and pray and
[58:04] ask god will you reveal this to me you
[58:07] know i
[58:08] didn't really know anything about the
[58:10] word or anything like that
[58:11] didn't really have nobody to really
[58:13] teach me in that kind of way and
[58:16] and so i just got down on my knees in my
[58:18] room and started praying and
[58:20] asking god and just doing what his
[58:22] prophet said to do
[58:23] so i started praying for revelation
[58:27] and just sitting in my room um god just
[58:31] began to come to me right there in my
[58:32] bedroom in spirit and would come and
[58:34] talk to me
[58:35] and just reveal things to me it was one
[58:38] of the most it was some of the most
[58:39] precious moments i ever had
[58:41] my dad used to be like boy what are you
[58:43] doing in there it's so quiet
[58:45] he's like you wouldn't hear anything for
[58:47] hours hours and hours he said you
[58:49] wouldn't hear
[58:50] a sound and i was like wow i didn't
[58:52] realize it but it was because god was in
[58:54] there talking to me
[58:55] and so i'm just praying and reading my
[58:58] bible and reading the church age book
[59:00] and god just began to open the word up
[59:02] to me
[59:03] but more than just i was understanding
[59:06] things i was really seeing the effect it
[59:07] was having on my life
[59:09] as a young man things i began to
[59:13] lose sight of the world and i started to
[59:15] become more god focused
[59:17] and i was telling
[59:20] the pastor i had a tv in my room and i
[59:23] never heard
[59:24] and i know i hadn't heard one quote or
[59:27] anything
[59:28] where brother branham up to that point
[59:30] had ever even said anything about
[59:31] kicking
[59:32] a tv out and uh and i think god did that
[59:34] for a reason because i was studying
[59:36] listening messages and tapes and books
[59:39] and i was falling
[59:40] so much in love with this i completely
[59:43] forgot all about that
[59:44] and so god was something god was really
[59:46] showing me you know that
[59:48] it wasn't about um trying to
[59:51] to manufacture anything it's a love i
[59:53] had such a love for god that
[59:55] it really made me lose sight of the
[59:58] entertainments of the world
[1:00:00] and so he always brings me back to that
[1:00:02] you know wherever i feel a certain kind
[1:00:04] of way or
[1:00:04] he always always brings me back to that
[1:00:07] moment
[1:00:07] remember your first love remember these
[1:00:10] things and so
[1:00:11] i was just praying reading my bible
[1:00:13] reading the church age book
[1:00:15] and just studying and loving it so much
[1:00:18] and seeing the effect it had on my mind
[1:00:20] being a young man in his early 20s with
[1:00:22] early
[1:00:23] worldly 20 year old mentality just
[1:00:26] wanting to live in the world and make a
[1:00:28] lot of money
[1:00:29] and this and that and now my mind is god
[1:00:31] conscious i'm thinking about the word
[1:00:33] i'm thinking about my soul
[1:00:35] and um brother branham always said you
[1:00:37] gotta have the holy ghost you gotta have
[1:00:38] the holy ghost
[1:00:40] and so um
[1:00:43] i was like well i want this you know i
[1:00:45] did this for about a whole year
[1:00:46] prayer study praying or study and uh i
[1:00:49] want to back up just a little bit
[1:00:51] but um me and my dad didn't really have
[1:00:54] the best relationship
[1:00:56] at that time and uh the more i began to
[1:00:59] study and feed the word i wanted someone
[1:01:01] to have fellowship
[1:01:02] with and so the only person i knew i
[1:01:05] could really talk to
[1:01:06] you know about the message and things
[1:01:08] like that was my dad and
[1:01:10] me and my dad used to didn't really get
[1:01:12] along you know early i'm becoming a man
[1:01:15] and i was kind of still living at home
[1:01:16] so
[1:01:18] that relationship wasn't always so good
[1:01:21] but
[1:01:22] when god started dealing with me and i
[1:01:25] started talking to my dad
[1:01:26] uh their whole atmosphere in our house
[1:01:29] really began to change
[1:01:31] because we were we i started talking to
[1:01:33] him about the word
[1:01:34] and it was really reviving all the
[1:01:36] things that god had once was dealing
[1:01:38] with him
[1:01:39] and uh and just to see how that whole
[1:01:41] atmosphere could change in the home
[1:01:43] just from us really fellowshipping
[1:01:45] around the word and
[1:01:47] talking about different things and i was
[1:01:48] i'd be in my room for hours praying and
[1:01:51] i come downstairs and like dad this is
[1:01:53] what god was showing me and he'd be like
[1:01:55] wow
[1:01:55] you know and it just changed the whole
[1:01:58] atmosphere
[1:01:59] our relationship got so much stronger so
[1:02:01] i was really seeing the
[1:02:03] effect of the message it wasn't so much
[1:02:05] as i can see this or understand that i
[1:02:08] was really seeing the effect it was
[1:02:09] having
[1:02:10] on my life and the whole family live and
[1:02:13] it started affecting people around me
[1:02:15] without me even realizing it
[1:02:17] and um uh you gotta forgive me i'm a
[1:02:21] little nervous i gotta
[1:02:22] relax but um so then um
[1:02:26] i was like well i wanna get baptized you
[1:02:28] know in jesus christ's name brother
[1:02:29] branham always talked about that you
[1:02:31] gotta be baptized
[1:02:32] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[1:02:34] so i was like uh what do i do where do i
[1:02:37] go
[1:02:37] i didn't even know what message churches
[1:02:40] was i never even heard of that term i
[1:02:41] didn't even know there was people that
[1:02:43] actually believed or followed what
[1:02:45] brother branham taught
[1:02:47] i just all i had was these books and
[1:02:49] tapes and i'm sitting in my room
[1:02:51] and um so um i was praying and praying
[1:02:55] about it and god said why don't you go
[1:02:57] on those
[1:02:57] on that website the voice of god website
[1:03:00] branham.org and ask those people
[1:03:02] so i like okay so i sent them my email
[1:03:06] and i said you know i'm a young man from
[1:03:08] ohio i've heard the message i believe it
[1:03:10] you know i want to get baptized but i
[1:03:11] have no idea where i'm supposed to go
[1:03:14] and so um they sent me
[1:03:17] a email back of churches in my area and
[1:03:20] i
[1:03:21] called a church in ohio and spoke with
[1:03:23] the pastor there it was where
[1:03:24] isaiah brooks used to be the pastor but
[1:03:27] when i was uh called it was a craig boor
[1:03:29] at the time and
[1:03:31] he did this i called him on a friday
[1:03:34] he's like brother i'm never in here on a
[1:03:36] friday
[1:03:37] he said i didn't even live anywhere near
[1:03:39] lima so i used to
[1:03:40] drive from a small town here you know
[1:03:43] and um
[1:03:44] so it was just god the whole way through
[1:03:47] and he said
[1:03:47] and even then i don't normally pick up
[1:03:49] the phone because it's normally as
[1:03:50] telemarketers and things
[1:03:52] so it was just god all the way through
[1:03:56] and um so we had a conversation and
[1:03:59] everything
[1:04:00] and i remember we was talking he said so
[1:04:03] brother you do you
[1:04:04] know anything about the message what do
[1:04:06] you do you know anything at all
[1:04:08] and you know this all i had did for a
[1:04:10] whole year by myself
[1:04:12] just felt feeding on the word feeding
[1:04:14] them everything brother branham taught
[1:04:16] so when he asked me that
[1:04:18] i just unloaded everything because you
[1:04:20] know i had someone i could fellowship
[1:04:22] with and talk to and
[1:04:24] you know i didn't know anything but it
[1:04:26] was just
[1:04:27] exciting time and it was just something
[1:04:29] for me as a young man and having someone
[1:04:31] else i could talk to
[1:04:33] and uh so to make long story short he
[1:04:36] i got uh i talked to him that friday he
[1:04:40] baptized me the next
[1:04:41] next day on a saturday and everything in
[1:04:44] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:04:46] and so that's kind of how my testimony
[1:04:49] of how i really
[1:04:50] just came into the message and how god
[1:04:53] started dealing with me
[1:04:54] it was just supernatural you know when i
[1:04:56] look back on it
[1:04:58] at that time i didn't have any i had
[1:05:01] the friends that i hung out with i
[1:05:02] didn't see them anymore
[1:05:04] i didn't have a job i wasn't in school
[1:05:07] and i really seen how god
[1:05:08] used that opportunity to start dealing
[1:05:11] with me
[1:05:12] and so now i look back and i could see
[1:05:15] what god was doing and so i'm really
[1:05:17] grateful for it
[1:05:18] and so it was just i always tell people
[1:05:21] a lot of time it was really just
[1:05:23] people used to ask what happened to you
[1:05:25] did something really tragic happen or
[1:05:26] did this happen to you did that happen
[1:05:28] to you
[1:05:29] and i said no i was just god just put a
[1:05:31] hunger and thirst
[1:05:32] for the word in my heart and i had
[1:05:35] nothing to distract me at that time you
[1:05:38] know no
[1:05:39] uh friendship no relationships no
[1:05:41] anything and god just started dealing
[1:05:43] with me
[1:05:43] and um and so i just started feeding it
[1:05:47] and really god just began to change me
[1:05:50] and how the bible says be transformed by
[1:05:52] the renewing of your mind
[1:05:54] and so that's what really took place
[1:05:56] with me was
[1:05:57] my entire mind frame changed you know
[1:06:00] just to go from
[1:06:02] this young man that's been in the world
[1:06:05] feeding on the world have a worldly
[1:06:07] mentality
[1:06:08] to go from that to have this spiritual
[1:06:12] frame of mind of thinking about god and
[1:06:14] my soul
[1:06:15] and you know and wanting to be born
[1:06:17] again and wanting to feed and
[1:06:19] you know it was just such a good thing
[1:06:21] and it's still a good thing
[1:06:23] you know brother uh brother branham
[1:06:26] talked about that he said i remember he
[1:06:27] was talking to her brother he said when
[1:06:29] was your uh
[1:06:30] best time and the brother told him right
[1:06:31] now you know you should still have that
[1:06:34] same kind of love right for right now
[1:06:36] from start to finish
[1:06:37] you know it should never stop never die
[1:06:40] down so
[1:06:41] i'm going to be honest it wasn't always
[1:06:43] like i was
[1:06:45] you know i had a lot of troubles you
[1:06:46] know from uh
[1:06:48] just being up and down but god's really
[1:06:51] been
[1:06:51] holding on to me and really giving me a
[1:06:54] real revelation of who he is
[1:06:56] like he was saying with uh job and what
[1:06:58] he was going through
[1:07:00] you know but right in that worst time in
[1:07:02] his life he said i know my redeemer
[1:07:04] liveth
[1:07:05] and so you really see the power of
[1:07:07] revelation and what brother branham was
[1:07:09] talking about
[1:07:10] when he was saying the gates of hell
[1:07:12] wouldn't prevail
[1:07:13] when jesus said the gates of hell would
[1:07:14] be able to prevail against this rock
[1:07:16] the rock of revelation and that's how i
[1:07:19] know
[1:07:20] something really changed with me because
[1:07:23] i'm
[1:07:24] i'm still here and i'm still believing
[1:07:26] and god's just been renewing my strength
[1:07:28] and
[1:07:28] hunger and thirst for the word and um
[1:07:32] you know so that was really just my
[1:07:33] testimony prayer study
[1:07:35] then after that then you know what
[1:07:37] happened my dad he started wanting to
[1:07:39] come to church with me
[1:07:41] you know and so uh he and he got
[1:07:44] re-baptized again
[1:07:46] and then my sister came and she wanted
[1:07:48] to get baptized
[1:07:49] and then my other sister came and she
[1:07:51] wanted to get baptized
[1:07:53] and so i was like wow it was really
[1:07:55] nothing that i did it was just god but
[1:07:58] to see how god can deal with one person
[1:08:01] and then how you don't realize how your
[1:08:03] life and how god dealing with you
[1:08:05] can affect so many people around you and
[1:08:08] that's really what happened to me but
[1:08:10] it was nothing that i planned i didn't
[1:08:13] say when i read that book i'm gonna be a
[1:08:15] christian i'm gonna start serving god
[1:08:17] it was just honestly something i was
[1:08:18] doing just because i was bored
[1:08:20] but god had a plan and um
[1:08:23] and so now that's really just it just
[1:08:26] prayer
[1:08:26] study just feeding on the word and god
[1:08:29] changed me
[1:08:30] and got baptized and started going to
[1:08:32] church there
[1:08:33] and um yeah that's pretty much my
[1:08:36] testimony
[1:08:42] i would actually sing a song but he said
[1:08:44] don't sing
[1:08:45] i don't say but i'm happy i'm here and
[1:08:50] god bless you
