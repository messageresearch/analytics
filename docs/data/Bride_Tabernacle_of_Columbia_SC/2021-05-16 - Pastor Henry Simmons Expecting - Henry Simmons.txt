oh god whatever the needs might be whatever the desires of our hearts so god that's according to your word lord may you grant it this day heal save and deliver in jesus name amen amen acts 1 praise god and 7. glory praise praise god acts 1 and 7 [Music] it says and he said unto them and said unto them it is not for you to know the time of the season which the father has put in his own power but you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judea and in samaritan and in the utmost parts of the earth may god bless you towards you may be seated luke 24 luke 24 and 44 [Music] and he said unto them these are the words which i spake unto you while i was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of moses and in the prophets and in the song concerning me then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scripture and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behooves christ to suffer and arise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem and you're witnesses of these things and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but terry in the city of jerusalem until ye be endured with power from on high they were under expectation expecting the power expecting the power they were expecting the power i believe the element of the church today is that their loss they have lost their expectation they don't really expect the prophet of god said we get what we what expect expecting the power god said i want you retiring in jerusalem and i want you to wait there until you be endured with power now without the power of god in our lives without his power we're not going to be able to do the greater works we need the power for he said the works that i do shall you do also and greater works than these shall you do because i go to my father so jesus said i go away but i shall return i'm coming back and you're gonna he said i'm with you but i shall be in you god that was with him promised to be in them and the works that he did are expectation or we ought to be expecting to do the same works but i feel like it's just a byword preachers are preaching it folks are repeating it but there must be a manifestation and a fulfillment of it not in the just the preacher but each and every individual for he said without me you can do nothing just talking to one of the store managers at a store yesterday in and he said he was spiritual and i said that's fine and he was talking about energy and he was talking about the creator and that he came from the word in the breath of god i said you call just creator an energy i call it and then he went on to say the holy ghost that's the whole lord he's talking about the holy ghost he got you i'm talking about folk and mis mix it all up messed it all up the folk don't know what the holy ghost is am and and when he got through talking i said he seemed to be a little deeper than most preachers i know even in the message of the hour i said but i i i want to rename what you call the creator and i'm talking about jesus and i'm talking about you don't want to recognize you know uh god but i want to tell you about god who is the word see brother and sister people are under expectation and they don't know what they're looking for just to die and become energy but you and i are on expectation not to die but to be changed glory to god it's got to be something to quicken your mortal body it's got to be quick and power inside of you amen the prophet of god talked about it in the horizon of the sun he was talking about the quickening power brother and sister we need quick and power in the church hallelujah i look for a church that full so full of the quicken power amen that when you walk through the doors the people are coming in there what other power of god is quicker than them amen somebody that's in gut with god in a real way in the power of god is activated in their life that quick in power real brother sister you got to amen it's not only good to feel it but to know that it's not just power but the person praise god oh yes the very person the very light oh god of god inside of you see we just don't want just the power we want amen the person we want jesus christ because if we got him we have the power see people just want to amen to do great works but they don't want jesus to have the preeminence in their life are you with me we ought to want jesus to live in me lord i want you to be my life amen that i live i want you to be my life god the life that i'll not live i don't want it to be me no more i want it to be jesus oh yes i want jesus to live oh god hallelujah it's something about expecting something from god amen expecting god to do what he said amen what he promised our lord you promised you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you amen i said if it has come upon you then i'm expecting to see the power come on somebody too many times folk claim to have something that they know nothing about come on somebody they're waiting on god to do what he said amen believers shall do in my name you shall cast out devils isn't that right because the power that's in you amen produces the miracles the signs and the oneness amen of produce because god is in you hallelujah oh we're not we're not just here just having uh a meeting or a church we here amen because the power of god is here when two or three are gathered in my name there i am in the midst i'm talking about genuine power that you as an individual possess inside of you not you confess but possess amen because many people are confessing but they're not possessing amen they don't have the goods are you with me but if you as an individual ain't it has been endured with power from on high if you have the baptism of the holy ghost amen then if you got the holy ghost power praise god paul said i didn't come to you with excellency of speech with the wisdom of amen but i came to you in demonstration of the spirit and in power amen is something about the power of god praise god it changes change they meant amen it transformed things they meant praise god you ought to be expecting amen a transformation amen praise god that's what happens when amen the power of god comes into your life amen when jesus come in it transforms you it changes you amen praise god it changes your whole life praise god change the way you talk it change the way it makes you walk it changes the places that you go the things that you used to do you don't do them no more because the power's coming hallelujah i'm not just coming amen to join a church i'll come in amen to receive the power hallelujah oh yes come and receive the power now this is what uh um hebrews 11 here for a moment but by the grace of god i wouldn't want to be in a dead church amen i wouldn't want to be in a dead church a church amen that don't have no power amen god is not the god of the dead but the what living amen praise god and i wan you know it's something about amen he said god not dead he's still alive i feel him in my hand feel him in my feet i'm feeling what is that a song or is that a reality it it's just a song that we sing but it is not real then you sing it something that you know nothing else but when it's real then you can feel god's anointing amen god power in your life well yes it's the power to influence it's the power to lead it's the power to guard you it's the power amen oh hallelujah expecting the power expecting god amen to do what he said amen amen so many people said i i expected this and i expected that but nothing happened i pray the acts are bad that please but nothing happened praise god hallelujah i'm so glad amen something happened amen when i got on the expectation and i said god you promised amen when you hold god to his word and you say lord you promise you promise that we repent of our sins be baptized in the name of jesus christ you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and lord you promise that's your promise

expecting god to do what he's saying praise god you ought to expect god amen if he said that he'll heal you then you are respect to be healed and he said i'll save you you are respect to be saved oh god i'm respected [Applause] i i'm expecting praise god i wouldn't want to be around the folks that ain't on the expectation i won't want to come to church and expect nothing to happen i want to come to church expecting god to be there expecting the move of god expecting the holy ghost to move expecting the power of god to come down praise god i'm not talking about somebody that can talk about it and can teach well i'm talking about manifestation i'm talking about real genuine god on the scene showing up oh god doing what he said praise god [Music] people talk about something they don't know nothing about amen but our god is real praise god you know what he's done for you you know where he brought you from you know who changed your life you know something happened praise god i'm a witness i'm a witness praise god hallelujah amen praise god somebody said can't you see what the lord has done praise god god made the change in each and every one of our lives that amen praise god has been
