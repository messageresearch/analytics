[8:51] things
[8:53] that sometimes it set others on fire
[8:57] that it could set our souls on fire
[9:04] also sometimes we think the Holy Ghost
[9:07] is just tongue speaking and just a dance
[9:10] and a
[9:14] shout acts
[9:16] one and it says excuse
[9:26] me a pag is somewhat coming together
[9:32] the formy treaties have I made o
[9:36] theophus of all that Jesus began both to
[9:40] do and teach until the day in which he
[9:44] was taken up after that he through the
[9:48] Holy Ghost had given Commandments unto
[9:52] the apostles whom he had chosen to whom
[9:55] also he showed himself alive after his
[9:59] Passion by many infallible proofs being
[10:02] seen of them 40 days and speaking of the
[10:08] things pertaining to the kingdom of God
[10:11] and being assembled together with them
[10:14] commanded them that they should not
[10:17] depart from Jerusalem but wait for the
[10:21] promise of the Father which he said ye
[10:25] have heard of me for John truly bapti
[10:29] baptized with water but ye shall be
[10:32] baptized with the Holy Ghost not many
[10:35] days hence and when they therefore were
[10:40] come together they asked him saying Lord
[10:44] will thou at this time restore the
[10:47] kingdom to Israel and he said unto them
[10:51] it is not for you to know the time or
[10:55] the season which the father has put in
[10:58] his own
[11:00] power but ye shall receive power after
[11:04] that the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[11:07] and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both
[11:10] in Jerusalem and in all the Judea and in
[11:14] Samaria and in the utmost parts of the
[11:17] earth may God bless the read word you

[18:33] was a young Minister and she said said
[18:36] to
[18:37] me she told me some things that were
[18:40] happening and and she said you know
