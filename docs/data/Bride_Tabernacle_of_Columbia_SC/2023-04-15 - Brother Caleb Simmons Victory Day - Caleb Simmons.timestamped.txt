[34:23] that are watching Jesus name we pray
[34:26] amen
[34:27] amen if you have your Bibles tonight I
[34:30] ask that you turn to the book of First
[34:32] Kings
[34:33] First Kings chapter 18.
[34:43] it's a very familiar scripture
[34:50] First Kings chapter 18 we're actually
[34:52] starting the 21st verse
[35:00] and it reads when you got to say Amen
[35:03] amen and the reason the logic came unto
[35:06] all the people and said how long halt
[35:08] you between two opinions if the Lord be
[35:11] God follow him but if bailed then follow
[35:14] him and the people answer him not a word
[35:16] then said Elijah unto the people I even
[35:19] not only remain a prophet of the Lord
[35:21] but Bale's Prophet are 450 Men Let Them
[35:25] therefore give us two Bullocks and let
[35:27] them choose one Bullock for themselves
[35:30] and cut it in
[35:32] in pieces and lay it on wood and put no
[35:35] fire under and I will dress the other
[35:37] Bullock and lay it on wood and put no
[35:40] fire under
[35:45] and call ye on the name of your God and
[35:48] I will call on the name of the Lord and
[35:50] the Lord answered by fire and the Lord
[35:52] that answered by fire let him be God and
[35:55] all the people
[35:56] answered and said it is well spoken
[36:00] God bless the reason that's where you
[36:02] may be seated I'm going to read a little
[36:03] bit further down here
[36:08] and Elijah said unto the prophets of
[36:10] Baal choose you one Bullock for
[36:12] yourselves and dress it first for ye are
[36:15] many and call on the name of your God
[36:17] but put no fire under and they took the
[36:19] bullet which was given them and they
[36:22] dressed it and called on the name of
[36:24] Bell from morning until noon saying Obel
[36:27] hear us but there was no voice nor any
[36:30] answer and they leaping in upon the
[36:33] altar which was made
[36:34] and it came and was dropped down to the
[36:37] 29th verse and it came to pass when
[36:39] midday was passed and they prophesied
[36:41] until the time of the offering of the
[36:43] evening sacrifice
[36:45] that there was neither a voice nor any
[36:47] answer
[36:48] no any to answer nor any that regarded
[36:51] and Elijah said unto the P unto all the
[36:54] people come near unto me and all the
[36:56] people came near unto him and he
[36:58] repaired the altar of the Lord that was
[37:00] broken down and Elijah took 12 Stones
[37:02] according to the number of the tribes of
[37:04] the sons of Jacob and not to whom the
[37:07] word of the Lord came saying Israel
[37:10] shall be thy name and the stones he
[37:12] built an altar in the name of the Lord
[37:14] and he made a trench about the altar as
[37:17] great as would contain two measures of
[37:19] seed and he put the wood in order and
[37:22] cut the Bullock in pieces and laid it on
[37:24] the wood and said fill four barrels with
[37:27] water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice
[37:29] and on the wood and he said do it a
[37:32] second time and they did it the second
[37:33] time and he said do it a third time and
[37:36] they did it a third time and the water
[37:37] ran round about the Altar and he filled
[37:41] the trench also with water
[37:44] and it came to pass at the time of the
[37:46] offering of the evening sacrifice that
[37:48] Elijah the prophet came there and said
[37:50] Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel
[37:53] let it be known this day that thou art
[37:56] God in Israel and that I am thy servant
[37:59] and that I have done all these things at
[38:02] Thy word Hear Me O Lord hear me that
[38:05] this people may know that thou art the
[38:07] Lord God and that thou has not that thou
[38:10] has turned their heart back again then
[38:13] the fire of the Lord fell and consumed
[38:16] the burnt sacrifice in the wood in the
[38:18] stones in the dust and licked up the
[38:21] water that was in in the trench
[38:24] and all and when all the people saw it
[38:26] they fell on their faces and they said
[38:27] the Lord he is the he is the god the
[38:31] Lord he is the god
[38:34] amen God bless you read another's word
[38:36] amen I read that because tonight I like
[38:39] to speak on a little topic and I
[38:41] entitled it Victory Day
[38:44] Victory Day at this moment in Junction
[38:46] as we read in the story there was two
[38:49] opposing forces they had There Was
[38:51] Elijah and there was the prophets of
[38:54] Baal and they came to this in this call
[38:56] many of times as many people call it
[38:59] they call it the Mount Caramel Showdown
[39:01] because of where it happened but there
[39:03] was something that was taking place and
[39:06] and Elijah said you've you've forgotten
[39:08] what God has done for you you've
[39:10] forgotten where God has brought you from
[39:12] you've forgotten from where you've come
[39:14] from but I want God to show you and give
[39:16] you Victory on this day so it was a Day
[39:19] of Victory it was something that was
[39:21] going to be miraculous see God had to
[39:24] remind them of where they was and what
[39:27] they needed so he brought them to a Day
[39:28] of Victory and so I I looked up the word
[39:31] Victory and they said the overcoming of
[39:33] an enemy
[39:35] it's an achievement of Mastery of
[39:37] success and a stroke in a struggle in
[39:40] the or an Endeavor against odds or
[39:42] difficulties see there this was against
[39:45] odds they put that sacrifice on the
[39:47] altar that Elijah had made and then they
[39:50] put water on it and many people know
[39:52] that if you got anything and you put you
[39:54] got fire and you put water on it it puts
[39:56] out the fire
[39:57] so anything that's wet shouldn't burn
[40:00] but this fire wasn't just regular fire
[40:02] it was Supernatural fire see it was a
[40:05] there was victory in this fire there was
[40:07] a victory so powerful that the water
[40:09] couldn't destroy it the stones couldn't
[40:11] destroy it what was in the trenches
[40:13] couldn't destroy it see that fire could
[40:15] take care of everything it could consume
[40:17] everything see that's the victory that
[40:20] God wants to give he gives you victory
[40:22] that nothing can stand against it
[40:23] nothing that comes against you can stand
[40:25] against it see that's how powerful the
[40:28] victory that God's has and see it had to
[40:30] come to a moment on a day
[40:33] see that's why I'm tired of Victory Day
[40:35] because it happened at a specific time
[40:37] in a specific place
[40:40] and I want to ask the question
[40:44] when did you get your victory
[40:46] when did you get your Victory and you
[40:49] say Victory maybe you say well it might
[40:52] not happen like did happen for Elijah
[40:54] but you mean victory over what and I
[40:57] asked the question when did you get your
[40:59] victory over your anger
[41:01] when did you get your victory over
[41:03] over your pride when did you get your
[41:07] victory over your fear when did you get
[41:09] victory over lying over stealing over
[41:12] cheating when did you get your Victory
[41:13] when did you get victory over
[41:15] self-righteousness
[41:17] or your attitude
[41:19] see today can be your day of Victory
[41:21] today could be the moment in time when
[41:24] you say I can walk away today was my day
[41:26] of Victory this was my moment where I
[41:29] came to my Showdown these two opposing
[41:31] forces came together and I said and I
[41:34] got my victory see each there are many
[41:37] stories and examples in the Bible that
[41:38] we can look back to and see there were
[41:40] specific moments when they got Victory
[41:43] you look at the story of Moses he one
[41:46] day he he got taken out of Egypt because
[41:49] he had done wrong and he got in the
[41:51] backside of the Wilderness but that
[41:52] wasn't where he was meant to stay that
[41:55] wasn't when he was going to get victory
[41:56] that wasn't when God was going to
[41:58] fulfill his promise to his children of
[42:01] Israel that he was going to bring them
[42:03] out of Egypt he was going to deliver
[42:04] them from captivity but he there came a
[42:07] moment on the day where after the he
[42:10] went back to Egypt he got back in his
[42:12] right position he got back in his right
[42:15] place God has showed him see Moses got
[42:18] victory in the wilderness when God came
[42:20] down in the burning bush where the Bush
[42:23] was not consumed he came to his victory
[42:25] day but that wasn't the children of
[42:27] Israel's Victory Day it was different
[42:29] see each one has got to be your own
[42:31] individual Day of Victory you can't lean
[42:34] on someone else you got to have your own
[42:36] experience you got to have your own time
[42:38] when you got a loan you got along with
[42:40] God and God has given you the victory
[42:42] and you can point back to that time and
[42:44] say this was when that was my day of
[42:47] victory that was the day I overcame that
[42:49] was the day I put all these things
[42:51] behind me and I died out and God took
[42:54] control it was that day
[42:56] that day of Victory see Moses had his in
[43:00] the wilderness but he had to go back and
[43:01] do what God told them and he said I
[43:03] can't speak but God said I don't need
[43:05] you to speak I do all of the I'll do all
[43:08] of that he went back and Pharaoh heart
[43:10] was hardened and it was hardened against
[43:12] Moses and the children of Israel but God
[43:15] worked all that out and one day they was
[43:17] delivered out of Egypt
[43:19] and they got to the Red Sea they had the
[43:22] mountain on one side and the sea in
[43:24] front of them and Pharaoh behind them
[43:26] and something else so they couldn't go
[43:28] back and they couldn't go to the size
[43:30] and Moses went to God and he said God
[43:32] what can what shall I do you didn't
[43:34] bring him this far to leave them see
[43:37] there was a victory that was about to
[43:39] happen and he said he said you speak
[43:41] don't you speak and you and Moses lifted
[43:45] up his hands and the Sea parted see that
[43:47] was the Day of Victory and they walked
[43:49] across that Red Sea on dragging around
[43:52] now everybody know that if you've been
[43:54] in water and you take all the water away
[43:56] you're still damn but they said it was
[43:58] dry ground because that was their Day of
[44:01] Victory and God was showing them if I
[44:03] can do this what else can I do if I can
[44:06] do this everything that I promise you is
[44:09] on the way everything that I promise you
[44:11] that promised land that flowed with milk
[44:13] and honey is on the way if I can do this
[44:16] what else can I do see there's a Day of
[44:18] Victory that you got to come to and you
[44:20] got to see that if God did this he's the
[44:22] same yesterday today and forever he's
[44:25] the same God and he said I change not
[44:27] because there was a Day of Victory and
[44:30] they came and they crossed the Red Sea
[44:32] and when they got Crossing Pharaoh
[44:34] chased them and God swallowed up the
[44:36] enemy he swallowed them up in the water
[44:38] the enemy was utterly destroyed just
[44:41] like the sacrifice it was utterly
[44:42] destroyed because when God does
[44:44] something he doesn't do it halfway when
[44:47] God does something he doesn't say I'm
[44:49] going to do part of it and lead the rest
[44:51] to you for you to pick figure out he
[44:53] said I already worked it out because
[44:54] there was their Day of Victory and he
[44:57] took that day and they got crossed that
[44:59] Red Sea and you know what they did
[45:01] there's a sound
[45:03] there's a sound once you get Victory you
[45:05] don't just sit still
[45:07] and you you they started thanking God
[45:09] they started praising God they started
[45:12] playing instruments they started singing
[45:14] songs because there was a shout with the
[45:16] victory there was a dance with their
[45:18] Victory it wasn't just the moment that
[45:20] carried on and they and they got the
[45:22] they realized that I got the victory
[45:24] there were some actions that had to
[45:26] follow when they got to Victory there
[45:28] were some things that had to happen
[45:29] after they got the victory because they
[45:31] realized we only got to Victory because
[45:33] of the Lord was with us we only got the
[45:36] victory because he was our strength we
[45:38] only got the victory because he came by
[45:40] and he did exactly what he said he would
[45:42] do see there was their Day of Victory
[45:44] and they can look back and see when he
[45:46] brought me through I praise the Lord
[45:48] then why can't I praise him now so he
[45:50] went and brought me through the Red Sea
[45:52] he can take me over Jordan because
[45:54] Jordan's not bigger than the Red Sea see
[45:56] he got to that point in their Day of
[45:58] Victory and one day Joshua they got to
[46:00] the red the Jordan ribbon it was
[46:02] overflowing it was flowing they said how
[46:04] we gonna get crossed who crosses the
[46:07] river the enemy was looking from the
[46:08] opposite Bank maybe and they was looking
[46:11] and saying who crossed the river when
[46:13] it's flooded
[46:14] who crosses a river when it's flooded
[46:16] ain't no way they're gonna cross that
[46:18] and Joshua walked up to it because he
[46:21] was given the word and the waters parted
[46:23] again he said if God brought us through
[46:26] the rest she Jordan ain't no match for
[46:28] him and they walked crossing the enemies
[46:30] got scared because they knew what was
[46:32] coming they might not have known to the
[46:34] fullness but they say our day our Day of
[46:38] Defeat is coming see there's two things
[46:40] that happens when when the Day of
[46:42] Victory happened there's a Day of Defeat
[46:44] there's a Day of Defeat for the enemy so
[46:47] you don't have to worry about that
[46:48] because you just worry about your
[46:50] Victory you just worry about the Lord
[46:52] taking you on higher and further on into
[46:55] your Victory and maybe you don't
[46:56] understand the extent of it but it is
[46:59] until you die out it is until you
[47:02] sacrificed it is until you come and you
[47:04] said when how when have when did I get
[47:08] my victory
[47:09] and if you haven't got your Victory
[47:11] what's holding you back
[47:13] if you haven't obtained your Victory
[47:16] what's holding you back what's stopping
[47:18] you from getting your Victory is it
[47:20] people is it friends is it status is it
[47:23] your dreams is it your things that you
[47:26] think that you're going to achieve in
[47:27] life is it maybe your the people that
[47:30] you're around what is holding you back
[47:32] from getting your victory
[47:35] see there was people that came to job
[47:37] when Cho was there and he was struggling
[47:39] he would look like he was down and out
[47:41] and his friends came to him and said and
[47:44] why don't you just give up on God there
[47:46] ain't nothing else you can do and his
[47:48] wife came to him and she said you might
[47:51] as well curse your God and die but one
[47:53] day job kept he kept holding on he said
[47:56] naked I came into this world and naked I
[47:58] shall return but that didn't cause him
[48:00] to give up on God and one day after the
[48:03] trials was over he had a Day of Victory
[48:05] he had a day where he could shout and he
[48:08] could sing about how much more God did
[48:10] than what he already had he replaced it
[48:12] and replenished it double for what he
[48:15] already had see job had a Day of Victory
[48:17] Dayton job had a day where he can look
[48:20] back and say what God has brought me
[48:22] through he can continue to carry me
[48:24] through see job had that experience and
[48:27] there was more of the Hebrew boys they
[48:29] had victory over the fire they have
[48:31] victory over a furnace that killed the
[48:34] ones that threw them in
[48:35] it killed the ones but it didn't harm
[48:37] them and when they got out they didn't
[48:39] even smell like smoke now if you've been
[48:42] around anything that has ever burned you
[48:45] ever been barbecuing on the grill and
[48:47] you stand next to the smoke you don't
[48:49] have to stand there alone to smell like
[48:51] smoke
[48:52] this fire was so hot it killed people
[48:54] when they got near the fire
[48:56] so you know the smoke was all over the
[48:59] place now how in the world do you not
[49:01] smell like smoke
[49:03] but it was their Day of Victory God was
[49:05] going to show them that I can do
[49:07] exceedingly abundantly more than you can
[49:09] ask a thing they said even they told
[49:11] they told the king that even if we die
[49:15] we still won't doubt the god that we
[49:17] serve that has no bearing if we die in
[49:20] the fire it has no bearing on the faith
[49:22] that we have in our god it has no
[49:25] bearing on how much we believe in our
[49:27] god it has no bearing that we will never
[49:29] doubt them because our Day of Victory is
[49:32] today whether we whether we live or
[49:34] whether we die it was still their Day of
[49:37] Victory it was still the day that they
[49:39] was going to overcome because God was
[49:41] with him God was with him and he was
[49:44] going to overcome it and see Daniel had
[49:46] victory over the Lions he got thrown
[49:49] into the lion's den and but the Lions
[49:52] did not touch him it was the God has
[49:55] shut them out to the Lions
[49:58] from attacking his servants see Daniel
[50:00] had a Day of Victory and then David had
[50:03] days multiple days of Victory they even
[50:05] had victory over the lion he had victory
[50:07] over the bear and then he had victory
[50:09] over Goliath sometimes God got to give
[50:12] you Victory after Victory after Victory
[50:14] to get you to where you need to be event
[50:16] David couldn't be a ruler without having
[50:18] victory over the lion David couldn't be
[50:21] a ruler without having victory over the
[50:22] bear David couldn't lead a nation
[50:24] without having victory over Goliath
[50:26] David couldn't have a victory until he
[50:29] had laid down and in himself and
[50:33] overcame his pride and said that I will
[50:35] let Saul live
[50:38] the many times he had to take him out
[50:40] even though it was his right to be king
[50:42] he said touch not God's anointed
[50:45] and see David had many a times where he
[50:48] had to overcome and it in this life that
[50:51] you live you have many moments where you
[50:53] got to overcome you got to have them
[50:55] days of Victory days and in battles that
[50:59] you're gonna face with and that's a NASA
[51:01] Victory and that's a mystery and many
[51:03] times we call them testimonies
[51:05] what is a life live if you don't have a
[51:08] testimony what is a life living you you
[51:11] have don't can't point back and say God
[51:13] did this and God did this and God did
[51:16] this and God did this and because he did
[51:19] all that I can believe him for this and
[51:21] because he did this and this I can
[51:23] believe him for this because he's the
[51:25] same God yesterday today and forever see
[51:28] he's the god that gives Victory he's the
[51:31] one that gives you overcoming power he's
[51:33] the one that gives you the power that
[51:35] you can rise above it all now you can
[51:37] take wings and you're gonna fly over the
[51:39] storm you can fly over and you can say
[51:41] Lord I I don't know what you're doing
[51:44] but I know you're keeping me I know
[51:46] you're holding me up here so that the
[51:48] storms don't bother me I know that
[51:50] you're keeping me and you continue to
[51:52] watching over me Lord and you're
[51:54] stopping me from going ways that I
[51:56] shouldn't go but that's after you've had
[51:59] victory over yourself that's after
[52:01] you've died out and you've given God all
[52:04] you've given him everything that he can
[52:06] have the victory not your Victory but
[52:09] his victory
[52:11] see he'll lead you through the storms
[52:13] he'll lead you through the through the
[52:15] past as you should go he'll take you
[52:17] through places that you never thought
[52:19] you would be and he'll take you on a on
[52:22] a path that you thought this was not my
[52:24] way
[52:25] but see that's the key it wasn't your
[52:27] way it was his way see he had given you
[52:30] the victory to overcome what was going
[52:32] to be in your way see it was a it was a
[52:35] Day of Victory
[52:37] see Jesus came he came to he came to the
[52:40] Garden of Gethsemane he got Victory
[52:42] because he got that he said Lord if this
[52:44] cup
[52:45] can't pass he said Lord not my will but
[52:48] thy will be none see Jesus had gotten a
[52:51] victory and because he got the victory
[52:53] we could get to Victory because he laid
[52:56] down his life he laid it down to save us
[52:59] he saw us in the back of his mind and he
[53:02] said I'm going to lay down my life so
[53:04] that they can get Victory I'm going to
[53:06] lay down my life so they can look up at
[53:08] the cross and at the cross
[53:12] where I first saw the light and the
[53:14] burdens of my heart was rolled away and
[53:16] it was there by faith I received my
[53:18] sight and now I'm happy all the day see
[53:20] that at that cross there was Victory see
[53:23] you know and if you read through the
[53:25] scripture many times you didn't see
[53:27] Victory without a sacrifice
[53:30] you didn't see Victory without a
[53:32] sacrifice before the before the many
[53:35] times the the Kings would go to battle
[53:37] they would say let's go consult the Lord
[53:40] let's offer up a sacrifice let's offer
[53:43] up a sacrifice to God to see what he
[53:45] wants us to do and everything it had to
[53:48] be by a blood sacrifice it couldn't just
[53:51] be by any sacrifice had to be the right
[53:54] sacrifice
[53:55] and see Jesus was the right sacrifice
[53:58] for you and I he understood that there
[54:00] was no nothing else that could take the
[54:02] place of him dying for us he understood
[54:05] and all and by him dying for us he'll he
[54:09] overcame and he had the victory over
[54:11] everything that could come over every
[54:13] sickness disease and over every demon
[54:15] power that was stand in the way of his
[54:18] people he overcame it in that moment at
[54:21] Calvary
[54:23] brother random said he said Godless
[54:26] disappointments happen to show victory
[54:29] he said God lets disappointments happens
[54:31] to show Victory see you'd only see that
[54:35] these things that seem to be burning you
[54:37] and upsetting you they are trials
[54:40] the things that are bothering you and
[54:43] upsetting you they are trials and see
[54:46] God lets those things happen so that he
[54:48] can gain victory said these things are
[54:51] these things they are things to stand
[54:54] still
[54:56] focus on the word of God and speak the
[54:59] word and then just walk forward
[55:02] that's all there is to do just and speak
[55:05] the word and just walk forward see when
[55:08] God gives you Victory you can just walk
[55:10] forward when God gives you Victory you
[55:12] might not know how you might not know
[55:14] why but God is all you got to do is walk
[55:17] forward I was going to read the
[55:19] scripture there was lepers that was
[55:21] sitting on the gates outside of Samaria
[55:23] and Samaria was surrounded by an army
[55:26] and there was no food going in and out
[55:29] and the people in the city were starving
[55:32] and these leopards because they couldn't
[55:35] be in the city because of their disease
[55:37] one day they got up and they consulted
[55:39] within themselves
[55:41] and they said you know if we go in the
[55:43] city city we gonna die
[55:46] and we go and we might as well try our
[55:49] chances with this Army we might as well
[55:51] try our chances because either way we're
[55:53] going to die so they went to the Army
[55:56] but they didn't know that God had
[55:57] already worked in the background God had
[56:00] sent a sound that the Army had fled
[56:04] because they thought that they they had
[56:06] consulted other armies and brought them
[56:08] in to take them out so they had fled but
[56:11] the lepers didn't know that so they
[56:12] walked by faith they took the faith that
[56:15] God had given them and they said we if
[56:18] we die we already was going to die one
[56:20] way or another and they got down there
[56:22] and they realized oh this tent is empty
[56:25] and they see oh there's some food and
[56:27] they got to eat and then they went to
[56:29] the next one they said this one empty
[56:31] hey go down there and check that one and
[56:33] it went down a little bit further and
[56:34] they checked that one and they checked
[56:35] us they said oh and then they got the oh
[56:37] they started celebrating because God had
[56:40] given them the victory but they started
[56:42] celebrating and then they said hold on
[56:43] wait a minute
[56:45] this Victory ain't good enough if we
[56:47] don't tell somebody
[56:48] we can have Victory all by ourselves but
[56:51] we need to share this Victory with
[56:52] others we need to go back and tell
[56:54] somebody of what God has done we need to
[56:57] go back and share so that they can
[56:58] celebrate in our Victory they can
[57:01] celebrate in what God has done they can
[57:03] celebrate with us because of how Mighty
[57:05] God has been and given us our Day of
[57:07] Victory it's not just my day but it's
[57:09] all our days of Victory that's that's
[57:12] what they wanted and they ran back and
[57:13] they told them they said come come come
[57:15] because God has done a mighty work and
[57:18] of course something was skeptical there
[57:21] were some that may be doubted
[57:23] but after they got going and one came
[57:26] back and they said no it's true no it's
[57:29] true how many times do you have to hear
[57:31] somebody say it's true before you
[57:33] believe
[57:34] before you accept it maybe this is my
[57:37] time for victory maybe I can accept
[57:39] Victory because if God Did It for this
[57:41] one and he did it for that one and he
[57:43] did it for this one why can't he do it
[57:45] for me he's the same God he said I'm God
[57:47] and I never change see there was a Day
[57:50] of Victory in those leopards they got
[57:52] they they decided to one day take take
[57:55] the word and move forward they decided
[57:57] to with that thought that came to them
[57:58] they decided to move on that thought
[58:00] they decided to go to that camp and say
[58:03] if we die but they didn't know God had
[58:05] done the word and sometimes that's how
[58:07] easy Victory is
[58:08] is to trust God and just move forward is
[58:11] to trust God and take him at his word
[58:13] and say God you're the god that delivers
[58:16] God you're the god that heals God you're
[58:19] the god that saves Lord I can believe
[58:21] that you will save Lord I can believe
[58:24] that you will deliver Lord I can believe
[58:26] that you will heal because you said it
[58:28] in your word I can believe for my Day of
[58:31] Victory and see even though I don't see
[58:34] Victory happening today I know that this
[58:36] Victory is is on the way I know that
[58:39] this Victory is on the way I can I can
[58:41] stand up I can shout today I can lift my
[58:43] hand and I can say today is my day of
[58:46] Victory I can turn to my neighbor and I
[58:48] can say today I got the victory today I
[58:51] can walk forward in faith and believe in
[58:53] that today was my day of Victory because
[58:55] God said it in his word
[58:59] see Paul had to come to his Crossroads
[59:01] he had to get on the road and and the
[59:04] Lord had to Blind him and said Paul Paul
[59:06] while persecuted thou me
[59:09] see Paul had to die to himself to get
[59:12] his victory to the point he died so much
[59:15] that he said all that I attained I
[59:17] counted as lost
[59:19] and Paul was a scholar The Scholar may
[59:21] be one of the brightest minds of his
[59:23] time
[59:24] he wrote half of the New Testament he
[59:27] was one of the brightest men but he had
[59:29] to die to himself he had to die and give
[59:32] himself completely over to gain Victory
[59:35] and Paul said all that I counted as laws
[59:38] and Paul said here in Philippians he
[59:41] said not as though I have already
[59:42] attained either were already perfect but
[59:46] I follow after
[59:47] if that I may apprehend that for which I
[59:51] also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus
[59:55] Paul came to the point that he wanted
[59:57] Victory he won the victory over
[59:59] everything that that he had done
[1:00:01] everything that had happened in his life
[1:00:03] he won a victory
[1:00:05] and God came down and gave him his Day
[1:00:08] of Victory he can point back to the time
[1:00:10] I said I used to be like this but this
[1:00:12] is what God has made me he could point
[1:00:15] back to the time and he said I used to
[1:00:17] do this thing but this is what God has
[1:00:20] done for me he had a testimony he had
[1:00:23] his days of Victories and he turned
[1:00:25] around and he could give his testimony
[1:00:27] to others and say this is where God has
[1:00:30] brought me from because of his days of
[1:00:32] victory
[1:00:34] now I asked when did you get your
[1:00:36] victory
[1:00:37] when did you when did you get your
[1:00:39] victory over what you were struggling
[1:00:41] with over what you may may have had in
[1:00:44] your life because these moments and
[1:00:46] these these battles will come
[1:00:49] but it takes something greater to
[1:00:51] overcome
[1:00:52] it takes something greater than you have
[1:00:54] inside of you it takes something greater
[1:00:56] on some battles only can be won by the
[1:00:59] Lord being in You by the Lord overcoming
[1:01:02] those battles for you so I asked when
[1:01:04] did you get your victory
[1:01:09] [Applause]
[1:01:19] they may appreciate the word amen
[1:01:21] she had a lot of hand clap of phrase
[1:01:23] [Applause]
[1:01:25] what a word we heard tonight amen I was
[1:01:28] thinking about it Lord give me a message
[1:01:30] I entitled a witness
[1:01:33] it says you got to be a witness
[1:01:35] of what the Lord is doing
[1:01:37] and I just thought that was good tonight
[1:01:39] how he was saying what what's good as a
[1:01:41] victory if you ain't gonna tell nobody
[1:01:44] God do those things for you because he
[1:01:46] wants you to be a witness
[1:01:48] I thought about so many things he was
[1:01:49] saying Victory Day I was in my mind
[1:01:52] going about Moses before he went there
[1:01:54] and then he went there standing on the
[1:01:56] Red Sea and the Lord told him after this
[1:01:59] day the enemy that fight against you
[1:02:02] they won't see him no more again at this
[1:02:05] this Victory Day that's the terminology
[1:02:07] he used after this day
[1:02:09] I thought about David before he went
[1:02:11] there
[1:02:12] David how he he told Goliath he says you
[1:02:16] know I'm gonna take your head off and
[1:02:17] I'm gonna feed it to the files I mean
[1:02:19] the carcass body file's gonna eat it he
[1:02:22] said in this day
[1:02:24] he said all the Earth gonna know there's
[1:02:26] a God in Israel I thought about it it's
[1:02:28] a victory day it come a point and I
[1:02:31] thought about it I said so many times in
[1:02:33] my Christian Journey
[1:02:34] I carried things and I wrestle with
[1:02:37] things but you get tired sometimes
[1:02:41] and that's why I always found my way
[1:02:43] right out here to the altar on my knees
[1:02:46] and I said I ain't carrying it no more
[1:02:47] after this day
[1:02:49] when I get up I ain't carrying that no
[1:02:51] more situation can get worse don't
[1:02:54] change nothing but after this day it
[1:02:57] ain't my fight I'm not fighting it no
[1:02:59] more and that that becomes your Victory
[1:03:01] because you get down like Jacob did you
[1:03:04] wrestle you say I've been carrying it
[1:03:06] and I'm tired
[1:03:07] I'm tired of carrying it I'm tired of
[1:03:09] having sleepless nights I'm tired of
[1:03:11] being worn out I'm tired
[1:03:13] and God you said to cast all my cares
[1:03:16] upon you because you care for me you
[1:03:18] said to take my yoke upon you and learn
[1:03:20] of me because my yoke is easy right and
[1:03:23] my burden is light so you come to that
[1:03:25] place those times and sometimes you come
[1:03:27] to them a little later than you should
[1:03:29] have you carry it a little longer than
[1:03:30] you should have but you get tired when
[1:03:33] you get tired you said Lord I don't care
[1:03:35] no more after this day I ain't I'm going
[1:03:37] on in God I ain't carrying it no more
[1:03:39] but I thought about that I said what a
[1:03:41] word tonight that we heard I believe it
[1:03:43] was still a small voice you know as like
[1:03:46] I said as the Lord I was I was going to
[1:03:48] minister on and I still probably with
[1:03:50] the Lord's will on being a witness
[1:03:51] because all week long I don't know about
[1:03:53] y'all but all week long I've been
[1:03:55] testifying at work
[1:03:57] I've been telling somebody about the
[1:03:59] goodness of Jesus
[1:04:00] all week long I know this morning God
[1:04:04] forgive us we're supposed to be out
[1:04:05] there working
[1:04:06] probably about an hour and a half we was
[1:04:08] going over scriptures
[1:04:10] talking about the goodness of Jesus
[1:04:13] one of the guys at work the other night
[1:04:14] because they had a problem right after
[1:04:16] the Bible study as soon as I walk out
[1:04:18] the door they call me we need you to
[1:04:19] come out here because the ball are down
[1:04:22] so I went out there and uh Lord will
[1:04:25] Lord blessed in 10 minutes we had it
[1:04:27] back on so the next day everybody
[1:04:29] looking at you as a hero man you what'd
[1:04:31] you do and I said you know what I said
[1:04:34] let me tell y'all like this
[1:04:36] I says if it ain't God that show me
[1:04:39] these things
[1:04:41] I wouldn't know it
[1:04:43] I said I said if I tell you I did this
[1:04:46] whatever like that I said God might take
[1:04:48] everything from me right now I says I
[1:04:51] can't tell you nothing without saying
[1:04:53] how good God is to him I said everybody
[1:04:55] looking at this I said but don't you
[1:04:57] know God be showing me all these things
[1:04:58] God that be God doing that I started and
[1:05:01] from there it turned into a testimony
[1:05:03] service I started telling them about the
[1:05:05] goodness of God and I said you know we
[1:05:07] started talking about health and
[1:05:10] sicknesses and I said you know if you've
[1:05:13] got health or good health you you a
[1:05:16] blessed individual
[1:05:18] but you take it for granted but let the
[1:05:20] Lord take a little bit of that away
[1:05:22] you'll understand how good that Health
[1:05:24] was or how good God was you woke up in
[1:05:28] the morning and you had good lungs I
[1:05:29] always say that you woke up in the
[1:05:31] morning you had legs I started talking
[1:05:33] my I said you know those are the things
[1:05:35] that you learn to praise God for you
[1:05:38] know we out there on the floor post to
[1:05:39] be working now talking about the
[1:05:41] goodness of Jesus one guy we call them

[1:05:47] almost 70 years old still working he
[1:05:49] said Earnest he said let me tell you
[1:05:51] something he said you see that one of
[1:05:53] these trial is he says about 30 years
[1:05:55] ago ran out and I wasn't watching it and
[1:05:58] ran and hit my leg he said it broke my
[1:06:00] leg in like three places he named the
[1:06:03] bones that it broke and he said that so
[1:06:06] I was out of work for a little while not
[1:06:07] sitting in the house he said I was so
[1:06:09] frustrated he said enough
[1:06:11] I got in the car he says I'm gonna go in
[1:06:13] the car and go to the store he said I
[1:06:15] got my crutch and I was pushing that
[1:06:18] driving with the crutch going to the
[1:06:20] store and he says I was miserable he
[1:06:22] says and I was so mad because I couldn't
[1:06:23] work and all this other stuff because my
[1:06:25] leg was messed up he says but no soon as
[1:06:28] I got to the to the store he said this
[1:06:30] guy got out the car
[1:06:32] he had but one leg
[1:06:35] and he says I looked at that
[1:06:37] he said I'm glad for this broken leg
[1:06:41] you know but he didn't start telling me
[1:06:44] about how his mama died when he was when
[1:06:47] she was 39 and it was eight of those
[1:06:49] children and how good all of his
[1:06:52] siblings still living and how God been
[1:06:54] keeping them and blessing them I tell
[1:06:55] you we started having testimony service
[1:06:57] but I said you know what I said God is
[1:07:00] good
[1:07:02] we got to tell somebody about the
[1:07:04] goodness of Jesus all that he did for us
[1:07:07] and brought us from a mighty long way
[1:07:08] like brother Kayla was saying tonight a
[1:07:11] victory what good is a victory you ain't
[1:07:12] gonna tell somebody about it you got to
[1:07:14] tell somebody about the goodness of
[1:07:16] Jesus I was talking to them boys this
[1:07:19] morning at work and just talking I said
[1:07:20] you know through all the the the stuff
[1:07:22] you had to deal with with racism and all
[1:07:25] this other things had to deal with in in
[1:07:27] certain departments at work and all the
[1:07:29] I said but God give me favor all the
[1:07:31] time
[1:07:32] I said God is so good I said don't you
[1:07:34] know God he's he set up whoever he won't
[1:07:37] he tear down whoever he wants because
[1:07:39] he's God and he don't got no respect to
[1:07:41] persons I said so the thing is I
[1:07:44] recognize the place that I am in the
[1:07:46] place in the mind that I am in life I
[1:07:48] recognize that everything I have belongs
[1:07:51] to God
[1:07:52] and I can't tell you nothing people
[1:07:54] don't believe in God and all these
[1:07:56] things I says but I I wish you know you
[1:07:58] would believe I was telling the um
[1:08:00] testimony about how you know y'all
[1:08:03] forgive me but I was telling testimony
[1:08:05] at work but we worked all night one time

[1:08:38] good to me and I says that the little
[1:08:40] thing that you think about that's a lot
[1:08:42] because you you press your with that
[1:08:44] ain't nothing compared to the blessings
[1:08:45] that God gave you and as I was talking
