[39:55] you believe in in God believe also in me
[39:58] you know in my father's house or my
[40:00] father's Kingdom there many palaces you
[40:02] know interpreted but either way he was
[40:05] talking to them about a place that he
[40:07] has he was going away and sometimes they
[40:10] was thinking it was a bad thing but he
[40:12] was going away he didn't know the whole
[40:14] purpose of his coming but he was going
[40:15] away and he was going to prepare a place
[40:17] for you and he says that if it were not
[40:20] so I would have told you you know and
[40:22] that's the thing about it God God God
[40:25] doesn't tell tell uh God isn't doesn't
[40:28] tell lies like
[40:30] men God doesn't make promises you know
[40:33] that he can't he can't uphold he don't
[40:36] do that you know we do that sometimes
[40:39] well you know you shouldn't do that but
[40:42] sometimes people do that they make
[40:43] promises and they can't hold they can't
[40:45] uphold those promises but one thing
[40:47] about Christ he he never make a promise
[40:50] that he can't keep never not one time
[40:54] all his promises he can uphold every one
[40:57] of his promises so you know and you
[41:00] think about that he says if it wasn't so
[41:02] I would have told you I want you to have
[41:04] comforted that that what I'm telling you
[41:06] is the
[41:07] truth what I where what I'm telling you
[41:09] I got prepared for you I want you to
[41:11] believe it come on and I don't want you
[41:13] to be troubled down here you know down
[41:16] here in this life like we say we down
[41:17] here be down here long enough you going
[41:19] to have troubles and things and but what
[41:21] what keeps you all messed up and all
[41:25] where you can't ever seem to get settled
[41:27] in your spirit is because sometimes this
[41:30] is where your treasure is so if this is
[41:33] where your treasure is this that's where
[41:35] your heart at this this is this is all
[41:38] you know like it says we don't sorrow as
[41:40] those that don't have hope this ain't
[41:42] this ain't the place we got all our
[41:44] confidence
[41:46] in now if we got all our confidence in
[41:48] this life we all upset we didn't achieve
[41:51] this thing I didn't get this what I want
[41:52] didn't get that I want always want this
[41:53] always want that so you gonna always
[41:55] this what because that's just where your
[41:57] hope is but you know it got to come into
[42:01] a place in your life where you release
[42:03] this ain't this is not what your your
[42:06] dreams and all are for come on we got
[42:09] goals and things don't get me wrong but
[42:12] this ain't the this ain't my my f if I
[42:14] don't I got goals but if I don't achieve
[42:16] that this is what I'm really living
[42:19] for this is all I'm you know we was
[42:23] talking to a a guy today at work he's in
[42:25] early
[42:26] and was telling them we was laughing
[42:29] about it I says you know I'm only 40 I
[42:32] says was telling them how fast time
[42:33] going and there another guy he's 60
[42:36] something he says and ask him he says
[42:38] man he says he just talk about how fast
[42:41] time going but I told him I said you
[42:43] know uh he says I ain't trying to get no
[42:46] older and one guy tells him well every
[42:48] he said you can't help it every day you
[42:50] go to sleep you wake up you older you
[42:53] can't help it and I said every heartbeat
[42:55] is bringing bringing you closer to the
[42:57] Grave you can't help it he said man
[42:59] that's that's kind of scary it is to
[43:01] those that don't have no
[43:03] hope but to you and I who have hope
[43:06] we're not afraid of those things you
[43:08] know why because it's the same spirit
[43:11] that raised him from Christ from the
[43:13] dead if it dwell in you you got to
[43:15] believe that right come on that when you
[43:17] go on the ground you know like I was
[43:19] listening to the prophet of God talking
[43:21] about that the how they how they cloning
[43:23] the corn and all those things like that
[43:25] he saying that they look the same all
[43:27] that they look the same they everything
[43:29] you can't tell the difference taste the
[43:30] same but the only difference is you put
[43:32] it in the ground you bury it and it
[43:35] won't come back because it don't have
[43:37] that germ of life in it but you and I
[43:40] that's been born again that's the thing
[43:42] about it it this flesh
[43:44] deteriorates it goes down but but that
[43:47] Soul what God did in in that place that
[43:51] that nothing can't nothing can't uproot
[43:53] that shake that that's life in there
[43:56] amen come on so you you ain't worried
[43:58] about that that's the Eternal part
[44:00] that's why he says I'm going I got
[44:01] another body prepared for you anyway
[44:03] this right here is fading away all these
[44:05] things you know so we look this ain't
[44:07] Our Hope right our hope is in what
[44:10] Christ has for us and the thing is if
[44:14] you don't believe it you won't live that
[44:16] way you won't believe you you we can
[44:18] come to church hear it you're in and
[44:20] you're out but if you don't believe it
[44:23] you'll say Amen to it but you won't live
[44:25] that way
[44:26] you know y like somebody I believe they
[44:29] told Peter or once them said you're a
[44:31] Galilean somebody where where you from
[44:33] he said no but they say your speech
[44:35] betray you your your speech will betray
[44:37] you your life will betray you it'll show
[44:41] sometimes we say oh we people think you
[44:44] live this place think you live that way
[44:46] but sooner or later it's going to show
[44:49] because the life that's in you got to
[44:51] come
[44:52] out whatever's inside you can only wear
[44:55] a mask for so long it's got to come out
[44:58] that's why you know the thing is we you
[45:01] look at your life as an individual you
[45:04] say Lord search me heart my heart and
[45:06] try my Reigns The Deep things God I want
[45:10] you to uncover them come on and let and
[45:13] let God do that but a lot of times we
[45:15] don't want it it ain't that sometimes
[45:17] we're afraid to let God go into that
[45:19] deep place but we don't want to you
[45:22] don't you don't want to you know live
[45:25] right you don't want to live that life
[45:28] so you you love those things so as long
[45:31] as you love them you won't let God deal
[45:33] with them but it comes to a place that
[45:36] you know as I said even when the Lord
[45:39] first saved me I come to that I I knew I
[45:42] want I said God I I need you I love you
[45:44] I want to serve you but I'm afraid of
[45:46] myself I knew I was but what did I need
[45:48] I needed the Holy
[45:50] Ghost you know I was talking with uh
[45:53] several people this week but I was
[45:55] saying to to somebody I says you know I
[45:57] says do you want to be saved do you want
[46:00] to serve the Lord and they said yeah I
[46:03] want to but I'm afraid I might backslide
[46:06] I says but the thing is you living in
[46:09] yourself you will I says but that's why
[46:12] he knew you couldn't live the life he
[46:14] knew you could not Israel tried it they
[46:17] could not and he knew that they could
[46:19] not keep his statutes keep his he knew
[46:21] they couldn't do it he said that's why
[46:23] I'mma write it in their hearts God God
[46:26] would have to do something to the inner
[46:29] man that's why he says you know except a
[46:32] man be born again he can't he don't
[46:34] understand he won't see the kingdom he
[46:35] can't understand he got to be born again
[46:37] he might be around it here at all the
[46:39] time might seem like his you know
[46:42] mystified all that to him or seem like
[46:44] it's too deep or it might seem too
[46:45] simple whatever it is but until he's
[46:49] born again the Revelation breaks forth
[46:52] in his heart things change he see it oh
[46:54] I see it now I heard but I see now I you
[46:59] can't help but to live because I was
[47:01] telling someone I said you know you
[47:04] sometimes every might talk about the old
[47:06] Earnest and old things he did and all
[47:08] those things and I says yes I says and
[47:11] you know at one point you know those
[47:13] things used to bother you but they don't
[47:15] bother you no more because you know that
[47:17] that man you're not that man that man is
[47:20] dead that man died back there so it
[47:23] doesn't bother you you say how could I
[47:25] that that that's not me come on I've
[47:27] been born again that old that's the old
[47:30] man all things have become new I'm not
[47:32] afraid of backslid afraid of going back
[47:35] to that man you can't how because that
[47:38] man is dead and he can't come back
[47:41] Christ is now living inside of you the
[47:43] life and that's what it is you say
[47:45] you're not boasting I I can live this no
[47:48] you knew you couldn't do it you knew
[47:51] that he had to come and that's what I
[47:53] was sharing with a couple people this
[47:55] week I said that's what it is you can't
[47:58] you you got you do I says what he says
[48:00] unto you is to repent that's number one
[48:03] thing to repent repent be Godly Sorry
[48:07] God lord how when they heard this they
[48:10] were what pricked in their hearts
[48:13] conviction set in didn't it come on he
[48:16] says repent and be baptized every one of
[48:18] you in the name of Jesus Christ for
[48:19] remission your sins and you shall
[48:21] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now
[48:23] that was a promise that God made and
[48:25] that's why I say we go back to that God
[48:27] don't make promises that he can't keep
[48:30] he promised it so if you do what he says
[48:34] he's he he'll do his part he'll give the
[48:36] Holy Ghost to them that what obey him so
[48:39] it's not that like we was saying I know
[48:41] we was talking about it in the Bible
[48:43] study the other night but it had already
[48:44] been on my heart too you you hear
[48:47] sometimes when you praying for people
[48:49] they begging Lord please Lord please I
[48:51] want it but it's not that you got to beg
[48:53] God please it's a promise that he gave
[48:55] you
[48:56] so in that you're saying Lord this is
[48:59] what you promised I did my part now the
[49:01] devil come to your mind all this things
[49:03] but long as you know that you done your
[49:05] part you wait until he does his part cuz
[49:08] he's got to do his part because he made
[49:09] that promise and it ain't never fail
[49:13] come on that's the promise that God made
[49:15] I was sharing with somebody that uh two
[49:17] days ago and I shared also I said now
[49:20] the same promise he made about the Holy
[49:22] Ghost all his promises are the same he
[49:24] said the same thing about about healing
[49:26] didn't he with his stripes we were
[49:28] healed I'm the Lord thy God that he he
[49:30] said if you lay hands on the sick they
[49:31] what they shall recover any s any sick
[49:34] among you call for the elders ain't that
[49:36] what the Bible says that's a promise
[49:38] that he made and he can't break he he
[49:41] can't break his Pro he ain't going to
[49:43] never give out nothing he can't deliver
[49:45] on now the devil will keep you
[49:49] doubting or or or keep your mind jammed
[49:53] up to where that's the right word
[49:56] clogged up to where you you just can't
[49:59] have enough Faith to believe what God
[50:01] says so you so you don't believe it you
[50:04] won't act on it will you come on you
[50:07] don't if you don't believe that if you
[50:09] lay hands on the sick there recover you
[50:10] won't do it first thing you'll do is run
[50:12] jump run to the doctor won't you why
[50:15] because you don't believe it Hallelujah
[50:18] but when you get to believing it come on
[50:21] believing then what it is God God he
[50:24] never said nothing he
[50:25] deliver he want to show you that that
[50:28] I'm going keep my promises that I'm the
[50:30] Lord and I ain't change I'm just as real
[50:34] as I was then I'm just as real now
[50:37] because I am not was not shall be but I
[50:40] am the same Hallelujah and that's what
[50:44] it is so you know I say what it is Jesus
[50:48] said he said I'm the way you know I was
[50:50] thinking about that you know and and how
[50:52] you know they saying here Lord show us
[50:54] the father because you know looking at
[50:57] something the prophet of God was talking
[50:58] about how you know is always been in
[51:01] man's uh heart or desire for man to see
[51:05] God they always want to see him right
[51:07] always want to see God and sometimes
[51:10] people say oh you can't see or you see
[51:12] them and you see them and me whatever
[51:14] they they always wanted to see them
[51:16] right but it's something to how Jesus
[51:18] told them I've been switch you so long
[51:20] yet you still don't know who I am but
[51:23] that's what happens people can go to
[51:25] church maybe years and years and years
[51:27] and still hadn't seen him still don't
[51:29] know who he is still don't know where to
[51:30] find him at come on it happens don't it
[51:33] Hallelujah but I don't know about you I
[51:35] said but I want to see
[51:37] him I want to see him I want to know him
[51:40] not just only just in the letter but
[51:43] through through the power come on the
[51:46] power of the res I want I want to know
[51:47] him in the power and the fellowship of
[51:50] his suffering yeah you suffering but
[51:52] don't Suffer Without the power come on
[51:55] come come on if I'm going suffer I want
[51:56] to see the power to come on glory to God
[52:01] hallelujah but we find that you know I
[52:03] say that what happened he he said show
[52:06] show us it'll satisfy he said I've been
[52:08] so long a time with you you can you
[52:10] imagine Jesus been there and they still
[52:12] didn't know who he was still couldn't
[52:13] recognize still couldn't see him right
[52:16] but the Holy Ghost had to come to do
[52:18] what open their eyes then Peter can
[52:21] stand up and say that same one you
[52:23] crucified go he's now made both what
[52:25] Lord and Christ come on he was here the
[52:28] Messiah the Christ was here living among
[52:30] us walked among us but we didn't know
[52:32] who he was but now we know why because
[52:36] he came back just like he said and he's
[52:38] living in us and we got the power now
[52:41] Hallelujah well how can we get the power
[52:44] oh he had a we didn't he come on God
[52:48] gave a promise but I say what it is man
[52:51] always want to see him even Moses after
[52:54] the burning bushy experienced all the
[52:56] Miracles and all he still came to a
[52:57] place he said Lord I want to see your
[52:59] glory
[53:01] amen what more sometimes you say do you
[53:04] have to see for God to show you that he
[53:06] is who he said he is what more does he
[53:10] got to show you come on what more does
[53:13] he have to do for you to just take it
[53:16] and say Lord I believe
[53:18] it I don't got to see no you don't have
[53:21] to do nothing I believe your word and
[53:23] I'll take it just like that what what
[53:25] more does he have to do Miracles after
[53:27] Miracles come on I was reading the other
[53:31] day how you know uh David was talking
[53:34] about in Psalms and how you know they
[53:36] they cried for bread I gave them bread
[53:38] they cried for this I gave he said and
[53:39] they still still didn't believe me he
[53:42] says but you know while their mouth was
[53:43] filled I slew the fattest of them
[53:46] because they they still didn't believe
[53:48] all I did for them and what more does he
[53:50] have to do what more come on what what
[53:53] what more do we got to take him through
[53:57] Hallelujah but he said sure you know
[54:00] it's always been uh uh in in man's uh uh
[54:02] heart uh desire to see God you know and
[54:06] the thing is it it it took it took me
[54:07] back uh you know in my mind I
[54:10] says you know the prophet of God was
[54:13] talking about something else he was
[54:14] saying you know when when a person first
[54:16] get converted you know how you
[54:17] illuminated everything look good to you
[54:18] everything changes you're excited about
[54:21] everything so I you know start thinking
[54:23] about how you know even in my own
[54:26] personal life how the Lord he first
[54:28] saved you filled you with his Spirit you
[54:31] couldn't even get through chapters of
[54:33] the Bible because you reading and all of
[54:35] a sudden you stirb heart stirb you
[54:38] crying tears of joy you thanking the
[54:40] Lord for everything because you're so
[54:43] you couldn't wait to get in the house of
[54:44] prayer prayer was your main thing
[54:47] because that was that was your
[54:48] fellowship with God that was because you
[54:51] knew that on your knees God was going to
[54:53] meet you there you was praying to a god
[54:56] that spoke back to you Hallelujah you
[54:58] were looking for him to speak back
[55:00] wasn't you Hallelujah but what happened
[55:03] sometimes you say what happened just as
[55:05] man always you saying always desired to
[55:08] see God but in this hour it looks like
[55:11] the whole thing is reversed people don't
[55:13] look to see God no more do they I know
[55:18] say it like that but it it's not just
[55:21] not just out in the the world you
[55:24] looking at in the church they don't look
[55:26] to see God they ain't looking for him
[55:30] why sometimes could be because
[55:32] everything is so accessible and
[55:34] everything is so easy now right I was
[55:37] thinking to myself I said you know we
[55:39] know desperation bring God on the scene
[55:42] but what does what does God have to do
[55:44] for us to look for him again I said God
[55:46] I don't want that I want I'm looking for
[55:48] you every day God I'm looking for you
[55:51] you know I was praying to myself today I
[55:54] was saying and I've been doing this for
[55:55] a couple days now I said Lord I says I
[55:58] want to tell you thank you for
[56:01] everything you blessed me with I want to
[56:03] tell you thank you for blessing my wife
[56:06] to be healthy for blessing my children
[56:08] to be healthy I want to tell you thank
[56:10] you I said Lord I don't want for one
[56:12] moment and I know I said I know you
[56:14] don't but I don't want for one moment it
[56:16] to even look or appear like I ain't
[56:19] appreciative for what you're doing for
[56:21] me so God I know I told you already but
[56:24] I'm going tell you again Lord I Thank
[56:26] you I said I already know I told you but
[56:29] Lord I'm going say again I love you I I
[56:32] know I told but I'm going say it again
[56:33] Lord I Thank you for saving me you
[56:36] couldn't you didn't have to God I was
[56:38] saying just like that but Lord you did
[56:40] and I want to tell you thank you I want
[56:41] to show I appreciate you I'm glad you
[56:45] did Hallelujah and that's been in my
[56:48] heart and that's and that's sh and know
[56:51] somebody was telling saying something to
[56:52] me the other day and what it is I says
[56:55] you you you come to church and what
[56:58] happens you know the devil you got all
[57:02] the devil got all kind of things going
[57:04] on on the
[57:05] outside in our lives you like got all
[57:08] kind of things so you come in the house
[57:09] of God he'll put them all on your mind
[57:11] at
[57:12] once he'll tangle you all you get in the
[57:15] house of God you can't even you can't
[57:17] even worship God what you came to do
[57:19] because the devil follows you in here
[57:21] and he got in your mind tangle your mind
[57:23] all up right or or something maybe in
[57:27] your life or a situation that's come
[57:30] upon now and you can't praise God can't

[57:36] because you Bound by circumstances you
[57:39] bound you Bound by situations and demon
[57:41] powers come on that's only the hell cap
[57:45] held you captive in your mind because
[57:48] Christ has made you free already it's
[57:50] only the devil that got your mind
[57:52] tangled up I said so what I want want
[57:54] you to do is what I want you to do when
[57:57] the Devil comes in your mind I want you
[57:59] to throw both hands up and say Lord
[58:01] thank you thank you for Joy thank you
[58:04] for peace thank you for saving me I said
[58:06] just throw both hands up and start

[1:04:20] Desiring to see
[1:04:22] him as you know maybe we can say it used
[1:04:25] to be but it's still those individuals
[1:04:29] that's why I says it can't be I sh
[1:04:31] somebody is not you know you got to you
[1:04:33] got to realize Jesus said I'm the way
[1:04:36] Mom and Daddy ain't the way the church
[1:04:38] ain't the way Jesus said I am the way
[1:04:42] you can't you can't ride off somebody
[1:04:44] else salvation you can't ride off this
[1:04:46] one experence or that one because I know
[1:04:49] you know yes they might have they might
[1:04:50] have lived good and they might have been
[1:04:52] filled with the Holy Ghost and they
[1:04:53] might have made it but you as an
[1:04:54] individual got to come and meet God for
[1:04:56] yourself you got to come down that
[1:04:58] lonely road that straight and that
[1:05:00] narrow way come on but if the desire is
[1:05:02] in your heart don't worry about whether
[1:05:04] you will make it or not let go to that
[1:05:06] desire God will come in I know he will
[1:05:10] come on sometimes you know and that's
[1:05:12] the thing God makes God makes his own
[1:05:14] way you don't we can't fig God makes his
[1:05:17] own way you know can you imagine in the
[1:05:21] in the in the face of the mountains on

[1:05:50] come on why cry speak God going to make
[1:05:53] it his own way wa it God make his own
[1:05:57] way I seen it I says even you know you
[1:06:00] go back to that part that's what you got
[1:06:02] to from the beginning got to be
[1:06:05] right you can't build a house and the
[1:06:07] foundation ain't right it might last a
[1:06:10] year or two whatever but when that

[1:06:17] foundation ain't right it's going to
[1:06:20] show up sooner or later it might last 10
[1:06:22] years but if it ain't been poured right

[1:18:02] yesterday and today and forever it's
[1:18:06] always Jesus anytime Jesus has not been
[1:18:10] exalted then you're in the wrong place
[1:18:13] Jesus Christ must be the center of all
