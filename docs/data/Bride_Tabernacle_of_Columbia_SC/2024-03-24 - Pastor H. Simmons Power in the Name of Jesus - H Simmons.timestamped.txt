[34:15] the name of
[34:17] Jesus
[34:19] Amen sometimes it's it's not the Deep
[34:22] things it's the simple things God hides
[34:25] himself in Simplicity and re reveals
[34:28] himself in the same so sometimes we can
[34:31] get too
[34:33] deep and forget about the thing that
[34:36] really
[34:39] matters he says how God anointed Jesus
[34:43] of Nazareth with the Holy
[34:46] Ghost and with
[34:48] power who went about doing
[34:52] good and heeding all that were oppressed
[34:55] of devils for God God was with
[34:59] him and we Are Witnesses of all these
[35:02] things which he did both in the land of
[35:06] Jews and in Jerusalem whom they slew and
[35:11] hang on a
[35:12] tree him God raised up the third day and
[35:18] showed him
[35:20] openly not to all the people but unto
[35:23] Witnesses chosen before God even to us
[35:29] who did eat and drink with him after he
[35:33] rose from the
[35:35] dead and he commanded us to preach unto
[35:40] the people and to testify that it is he
[35:45] which was ordained of God to be the
[35:49] judge of the quick and the
[35:51] dead and to him give all the prophets
[35:56] witness that through his name whosoever
[36:00] believe in him shall receive remission
[36:04] of sin may God bless you re words you
[36:07] may be
[36:09] seated he says in the 43rd verse andto
[36:13] him give all the prophets witness that
[36:16] through his name whosoever believe in
[36:21] him shall receive remission of
[36:24] sin the power that's in the name of
[36:27] Jesus
[36:28] Jesus he went on to say in the 44th
[36:32] verse and while Peter yet spake these
[36:35] words the Holy Ghost fell on them which
[36:39] heard the
[36:40] word and they of the circumcision which
[36:44] believe were
[36:46] astonished as many as came with Peter
[36:49] because that on the Gentiles also was
[36:53] ped out the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[36:57] they heard heard them speak with tongues
[36:59] and magnify God then answered Peter can
[37:04] any man forbid
[37:06] water that these should not be baptized
[37:10] which have received the Holy Ghost as
[37:12] well as we and he commanded them to be
[37:16] baptized in the name of
[37:19] who the Lord I know Saul on his way to
[37:23] damasc said who are thy Lord the Lord
[37:25] said I'm Jesus
[37:28] Jesus
[37:29] amen then pray they him to T certain
[37:34] days the power in the name of
[37:37] Jesus Proverbs says in Proverbs
[37:41] 1810 the name of the Lord is a strong
[37:44] tower the righteous run there in and
[37:47] they are
[37:48] safe so we realize the name of the Lord
[37:51] is a strong tower now as we go back to
[37:55] the book of Acts here we were talking
[37:57] talking about the book of Acts church
[37:59] but because of the name of
[38:03] Jesus he told us why
[38:08] Amen in Acts
[38:16] 3 it
[38:17] says the account of Peter and John going
[38:20] into the temple and they saw a man
[38:24] laying and they said unto him
[38:29] when he asking arms of
[38:32] them and they told them sing
[38:35] gold have we none but such as we have we
[38:38] give unto thee and they told him that in
[38:41] the name of Jesus Christ of
[38:44] Nazareth I want you to sixth verse he
[38:46] said rise up and
[38:48] walk see they use the name and in the
[38:52] 11th verse here in the same chapter it
[38:55] says here and as the lame
[38:59] man which was healed held Peter and John
[39:04] all the people ran together to them in
[39:08] the
[39:09] porch that is called
[39:13] Solomon greatly
[39:15] wondering people were excited they seen
[39:18] something happen and we're saying that
[39:21] we want to see Jesus Christ the same
[39:24] yesterday and today and
[39:26] forever
[39:28] there's power in the name of
[39:30] Jesus the people ran together because
[39:33] they saw the man
[39:37] walking and when Peter the 12th verse
[39:40] and Peter saw it he answered unto the
[39:43] people ye men of Israel why
[39:46] Marvel at ye at this or why look ye so
[39:53] earnestly on us as though by our our own
[39:58] what our own power of
[40:01] Holiness we had made this man to
[40:07] walk and God the god of Abraham and of
[40:11] Isaac and of Jacob the god of our
[40:15] fathers which glorified his son
[40:18] Jesus whom ye delivered up and denied
[40:22] him in the presence of P when he had
[40:27] when he was determined to let him go but
[40:30] ye deny the Holy One and Je the just and
[40:36] desired a murder to be granted unto you
[40:39] and you killed the
[40:41] what you killed
[40:44] who the Prince of Life whom God raised
[40:49] from the dead well we Are
[40:53] Witnesses
[40:55] and here what
[40:58] and his name through faith in
[41:01] what faith in his name you see it's

[58:38] day and all night they'll still do the
[58:41] same sinful stuff that they done the
[58:44] only reason they doing that stuff is
[58:46] because they would not humble
[58:51] themselves watch what comes out of their
[58:54] mouth it's a lack of
[58:59] humility they're still worrying about
[59:01] who did this or who did that to
[59:05] them you know I I see a lot of people
[59:08] been hurt in a lot of
[59:10] ways and every time I look around I'm
[59:13] running into somebody who's got a lot of
[59:14] hurt and a lot of
[59:16] pain some folks have been messed up
[59:18] since
[59:20] childhood they went through things that
[59:23] they had no no power no
[59:26] strength over
[59:28] it and
[59:30] then they so they they feel so
[59:34] victimized until they do anything
[59:37] because they can't stand to live with
[59:40] what have happened to them in their
[59:43] life those are the people that gives up
[59:46] give up hope give up
[59:48] life and they become a
[59:52] victim and they wonder why God has left
[59:56] them and why God has allowed them to go
[59:59] through the things the hurt and the pain
[1:00:02] and the suffering that they've been
[1:00:04] through and then wonder where where was
[1:00:07] God
[1:00:08] then and why didn't God do something
[1:00:10] about my situation and my
[1:00:14] case and they come to church and
[1:00:16] sometimes in the church they get
[1:00:18] hurt sometimes they go through pain they
[1:00:20] go through things some sometimes the
[1:00:23] preacher is a hypocrite sometime the
[1:00:25] Deacon is a hypocrit sometime amen folks
[1:00:28] in the church are
[1:00:31] hypocritical sometimes things are all
[1:00:33] twisted up people all twisted up in
[1:00:35] their head and in their mind
[1:00:39] because they're hurting in the
[1:00:45] inside somebody asked me can you help
[1:00:47] the hurt that's said too many hurting
[1:00:50] people out here I can't help them
[1:00:53] all sometimes it's too many po people
[1:00:56] you can't have them
[1:01:00] on are you with
[1:01:02] me we come to places in our in life
[1:01:07] where people fail to go to the source go
[1:01:11] to Jesus Christ because he's the only
[1:01:12] one that can help us but instead of
[1:01:15] going to Jesus Christ they do
[1:01:18] anything because they said if Jesus was
[1:01:21] real why did he let it
[1:01:24] happen why did he let it happen happened
[1:01:26] to me if he was real why did he let it
[1:01:28] happen to
[1:01:33] me but Jesus is standing there with his
[1:01:35] arm outstretched said I'm here to help
[1:01:39] you somebody said why I said God didn't
[1:01:43] do it the devil did
[1:01:44] it whatever you were went through the
[1:01:47] devil did it why God let the devil did
[1:01:50] it you know sometime we say why
[1:01:53] you let you yourself become a
[1:01:58] victim why don't you get
[1:02:01] up why don't you
[1:02:03] take the situation to make a better
[1:02:08] life instead of letting it beat you die
[1:02:11] want you let it lift you
[1:02:14] up see some situation you take and use
[1:02:18] it for a stepping
[1:02:20] stone I can do
[1:02:23] better I'm not gonna do this because
[1:02:26] I've seen what it done to
[1:02:32] others some things I didn't want to do
[1:02:34] because I seen what it done to my family
[1:02:36] members I ain't going to do it but do

[1:02:46] you say you ain't going to do you ain't
[1:02:48] strong enough not to do it that's why

[1:02:53] God without God you'll do anything
[1:02:57] Lord I'm depending on
[1:03:00] you to see me

[1:03:05] come by and save me I don't know where I
[1:03:08] would have
[1:03:09] been or what I would have done but God
[1:03:13] saved me in
[1:03:14] time amen and I thank
[1:03:18] God because I probably would have been
[1:03:21] dead and
[1:03:24] gone somebody think we privileged it's
[1:03:27] just the mercy of
[1:03:29] God it's just God's mercy on us that's
[1:03:33] all it is it's not that you were better
