[26:35] think we need revival as we talked this
[26:39] morning time to unite it's time to unite
[26:48] different things that happens in life
[26:51] and when different things happen it's a
[26:57] call for unity
[27:00] and we've seen that the nation in the
[27:05] country in the world needs to be unified
[27:13] somebody said where there's unity there
[27:16] is strength Jesus declared when two or
[27:23] three are gathered in my name there I'll
[27:26] be in the mists x2 and one says and when
[27:38] the day of Pentecost was fully come they
[27:40] were all with one Accord in one place
[27:48] something that came a sound from heaven
[27:50] as of a rushing mighty wind and to fill
[27:53] all the house where they were sitting if
[27:58] we unite something will happen and there
[28:04] appeared and then there my clothes and
[28:07] turns like of the fire and it's set upon
[28:10] each of them and they were all filled
[28:14] with the Holy Ghost that's what we need
[28:19] we need a feeling of the Holy Ghost and
[28:22] a refueling and began to speak with
[28:27] other tongues as the Spirit gave them
[28:30] utterance and there were dwelling at
[28:33] Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every
[28:37] nation under heaven now when this was
[28:41] noised abroad the multitude came
[28:45] together and were confounded because
[28:48] that they that every man heard them
[28:52] speak in his own language hallelujah and
[28:57] they were all amazed and marvelled
[29:01] saying one to another behold about all
[29:06] these which speak galilaeans
[29:08] and how hear we every man in our own way
[29:12] which way and we were born parthians and

[36:06] up his voice and said unto them you man
[36:10] up to dare and all you to dwell at
[36:14] Jerusalem be this known and the youth
[36:18] and hearken to my words for these are
[36:22] not drunk as you suppose seeing it is
[36:27] but the third hour of the day but this
[36:30] is that which was spoken by the Prophet
[36:33] Joel that it should come to pass that in
[36:39] the last days said god I will pour my
[36:47] spirit upon all flesh your sons and
[36:52] daughters shall prophesy your young men
[36:56] shall see visions your old men shall
[37:01] dream dreams and all my servant and on
[37:06] my handmaid I will pour in those days of
[37:13] my spirit and they shall prophesy amen
[37:19] God even promised that he'll pour out
[37:24] his spirit and God did exactly what he
[37:30] promised he will feel exactly what he
[37:34] said he said I'll do it and God did
[37:38] exactly what he said but when God pulled
[37:43] out his spirit there were many men
[37:46] thought that this was just a host that
[37:50] these men painted what's just jumped II
[37:54] don't it was a natural happening they
[37:58] did not realize the spirits are
[38:01] significant of what was going on
[38:05] the natural man conscious that there is
[38:09] a call for a spiritual United signs and
[38:14] time that God is doing something Wow he
[38:18] met the natural world I fell trying to
[38:24] unite and become one he been there's a
[38:29] spiritual Kingdom that God is calling
[38:33] back to return to Jerusalem to return
[38:40] even to the please Wow two days I've
[38:49] said it's time to return in the Book of
[38:56] Kings first Kings 18 first Kings 18 God
[39:05] is a merciful God and God is a great God
[39:09] and God wants to bless us
[39:13] first Kings 18 and 36 I want you to
[39:20] remind you of the story of Elijah they
[39:25] meant hills were had drifted so far away
[39:28] from God and then they're drifting away
[39:33] from God they had worn down that random
[39:37] nation king he had and he had a wife he
[39:44] meant that wasn't a believer and her
[39:48] name was Jezebel and at that time
[39:54] Jezebel he had caused the people to be
[39:58] seduced and steerer amanda was him in
[40:04] gone to she led the nation into our
[40:08] dollars here to worship bale and began
[40:13] to amen to have false worship
[40:19] People of God they is even on Sanibel
[40:25] spirit that have pretend to the church
[40:30] and has seduced imagination and I
[40:35] seduced the church and still a washer in
[40:39] the true and living God then they began
[40:44] to worship in a bale I want you to be
[40:51] conscious in a way just because you go
[40:56] to church that don't mean that you
[40:59] worship in God just because you say I'm
[41:04] a Christian that doesn't mean a mana no
[41:12] folks that say they were Jews the Bible
[41:17] said that they were not the synagogue of
[41:22] Satan I want you to know the people
[41:27] that's all
[41:31] to unite no union is not with the world
[41:44] God is calling you to unite is with the
[41:53] world 36 there was a mark almost
[42:01] showdown where the true believers what's
[42:05] going to be identified Amen I wish today
[42:10] that we recognize God is calling you and
[42:17] I to return not to the church because a
[42:22] lot of people come back to the church
[42:26] and said I'm coming home coming back to
[42:30] where grandma
[42:31] was coming back your granddaddy
[42:35] they come to the physical building in it
[42:40] but we're grandmama hard was and how my

[43:04] to God the sacrificing this should be
[43:08] they remember problem they remember
[43:14] mothers but they don't remember the life
[43:17] that my believe they don't remember the
[43:21] life I said it's time not return to the
[43:30] church or to the building or to some
[43:34] denomination it's time to come back to
[43:37] Jerusalem not to resume the land of
[43:46] Palestine not to Teresa over there
[43:51] praise God as a nation that we're
[43:55] talking about but I'm talking about two
[43:58] heavenly Jerusalem I'm talking about the
[44:02] spirits of Jerusalem it's time to return
[44:06] back to that needs the place where God
[44:10] promised that I'll meet today I'll meet
[44:15] you in Jerusalem time to return but
[44:24] Israel at the time was call to
[44:31] remembrance what you think you are and
[44:37] who you take your washing I will choose
[44:42] to be open
[44:45] People of God I want a challenge
[44:52] Jezebel prophets but ones that eat at
[44:57] Jezebel's evil Elijah came down to are

[45:14] antenna bel religion I will call you oh

[45:29] you to make a sacrifice turn yoga under
[45:36] guard and answer by fire let me go go
[45:44] ahead I'll let you go first and they
[45:49] offered sacrifice they build the altar
[45:54] under cold upon bail but there was no
[45:58] answer I'm saying brother sister if
[46:03] you're not gonna answer down if
[46:08] you're playing and you're crying out to
[46:11] God and God is not answered I said
[46:15] something in wrong in your life look
[46:21] oldest even God not to respond until you
[46:26] cry if God is not responded then I want
[46:31] you to look and examine yourself and see
[46:37] whether you be in the faith or not
[46:40] examine yourself human dancin you've
[46:45] been shot in you've been taken but there
[46:50] is no power in your worship does no the
[46:54] leverage in your worship you still
[46:58] living in like the world you still acted
[47:03] like the world you're still rested like
[47:07] the world there's no change in your life
[47:11] please be that you're not worshipping
[47:15] the true and living God amen are you
[47:19] doing the choir might saying good the
[47:23] preacher might preach eloquent but where
[47:26] is gone a sudden let us return first
[47:36] Kings 1836 and it came to pass at the
[47:45] time I said it's time to unite at the
[47:51] time of the offering of the evening
[47:56] sacrifice I believe that there shall be
[47:58] light in the end of time I believe the
[48:03] scene the time I believe that God
[48:07] promised that the Sun of righteousness
[48:10] shall arise with healing in his wings I
[48:14] believe is even the time and I believe
[48:17] right there's no sign a star spring from
[48:24] her but God won't deliver his people and
[48:29] I believe that somebody needs to
[48:31] leverage somebody needs healing somebody
[48:35] needs that tree in their lives they made
[48:39] a time to return and Elijah it even is
[48:50] sacrificing larger the Prophet came then
[48:53] said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[49:00] and even her eyes and in Israel let it
[49:06] be known this day that thou our God in
[49:10] Israel
[49:12] saying I know the Sun is hot they meant
[49:15] we are come from distances to be here
[49:19] but let us come for something
[49:22] let us not just come set in the Sun in
[49:26] the heat of the day let us come with an
[49:30] expectation that God can deliver on his
[49:34] promise let us come and let the Steep be
[49:38] a differently they meant let us say he
[49:42] meant that a toonie I'm not tuning in
[49:45] just to hear another sermon
[49:47] I'm not tuning in just to hear some
[49:50] elegant words but I want to hear from
[49:53] God and I want to know that this God
[50:00] routine he means me that God calls my
[50:05] heart to burn me that God speak to my
