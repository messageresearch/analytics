pray amen and amen and god is good this morning amen amen let's look at the book of first peter 5. it's good to be here this morning amen first peter 5. i won't be before you long amen just try to give you a few words of encouragement first peter 5 and we'll begin at the first verse we got to say amen and it reads the elders which are among you i exhort whom am also an elder and witness of the sufferings of christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed you may be seated this morning we'll read a little further down feed the flock of god which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucr but of a ready mind neither has been lords over god's heritage but in samples to the flock and when the chief shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a crown of glory that fade if not away likewise your youngest submit yourselves until the elder yea all used to be subject one to another and be clothed with humility and god for god resists the proud and give grace unto the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you be sober be viligent because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour how many know the devil is out to destroy you this morning he says your adversary the devil he ain't playing games with you come on but he's he's a roaring lichen lion i mean seeking whom he may devour you know i always says if it ain't for the grace of god the devil would have been knocking many of us out wouldn't he you know i was ministering i said a lot of times you know we be careful of how we look at others because i says you know was i i made an example once we were at the the job and over across the street you know it's a lot of homeless and drug addicts and things and you know some of the guys were saying some things and i said you know with me i can't look at people a certain way no matter what condition they are right i said because that could have been me come on that could have been you i said i remember my parents one day i says that you know god is it's only a measure of grace that god has given us through what through election and you don't know who god who's god's seed amen you don't know the one that you count out remember that might be god's chosen one that might be the one that god take come on man many times they said saul come on do you know he even questioned god once he uh i believe they questioned god he said you know this man got letters come on to destroy the church of god are you sure he said come on god is sure god knows god knows them that are he is how many believe that but it's a measure i believe that of grace so we're only here this morning by the grace of god we're only here in church praising god being able to lift our hands and say thank you jesus by the grace of god because our adversary as a as a roaring lion come on he's walking seeking whom he may devour but when he would devour you the angels of god was there come on when he would devour you god kept you through the night when he would devour you god kept you through the week hallelujah and he giving you the opportunity to be here this morning and don't waste that opportunity come on don't waste that opportunity to tell god thank you don't waste that opportunity to lift your hands come on and say thank you jesus hallelujah you ain't pretending come on you giving god glory because of who he is come on i like that song it says we worship you because of who you are hallelujah oh jesus we give honor to many people come on in many things but the king of glory hallelujah what about giving him his honor how many believe that this morning but we find that i said come on you adversary the devil he has a roaring lion come on seeking to devour you but i like that in the scripture he said his grace he has he has extended to me come on god gave us extended grace you know many times our feet would have failed but god extended the path for us didn't he many times we would have fallen but god extended out grace many times our our what he called it accuser was there accusing us lord look at him but that extended grace hallelujah what was it it was the blood the blood uh catching all of our faults the blood covering it says come on we ain't looking at us but he's looking at us through the blood hallelujah and when he sees us through the blood we are already justified we already come on sanctified and glorified not because of what we've done but because of all of what he has done hallelujah how can i stand before you this morning only by the grace of god how can i minister to you today only by the grace of god there was many oh god that was better than maybe you say you were in life but nevertheless god saw you and god knew you hallelujah he knew what was in your heart he knew if you had an opportunity you'd give him thanks he know that if he saved you you wouldn't be like those that didn't come back but you come back and say lord thank you hallelujah oh jesus oh glory to god hallelujah come on i said god is so good to us come on we all understand hallelujah and that's what we want to talk about this morning being partakers of his glory come on we don't understand sometimes how good god is to us you know we don't miss certain things until we can't do it or until it's taken away come on but what it is god allows those things to happen so he can bring out the best in us how many believe that this morning let me read a little further down it says whom he says he is seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brother that are in the world you ain't in this by yourself come on sometimes you think lord i'm going through and ain't nobody else going through you ain't in this by yourself he says you got is the the same afflictions uh come on it's something that been through and they made it through how did they get through because god pulled them through hallelujah come on we got a cloud of witnesses you ain't in this fight by yourself i said pick your head up this morning i said quit walking around like you in this by yourself come on we got a cloud of witnesses and if they made it through hallelujah i know that i can make it i know that i can stand no matter what comes my way my life is in his hands hallelujah god's done it how many believe that this morning oh jesus somebody give god praise this morning i said no matter what hallelujah no matter what comes your way we got a cloud of witnesses come on we got a cloud of witnesses this morning i said i ain't in this by myself you know i got a saying i always say i says when i'm going through and i sometimes don't know what to do i say to myself i said i know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna praise god i know exactly what i'm gonna do i'm gonna wait on god i've done all i can do now i'm just gonna stand hallelujah and i'm gonna wait on god to show up because he never failed me yet hallelujah and he won't fail you now how many believe that this morning i says whom resists steadfast in faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the god of all grace come on who have called you unto his eternal glory god has called you to glory this morning come on by je by christ jesus after that this department want to get to after that you have suffered a while after you suffered a while how many believe that this morning i said partakers of his glory he said he calls you until his eternal glory after you suffered a while somebody said i don't want to go through nothing but you want we want to be partakers of his glory but he says we going to be partakers after come on after you suffered a while we glory in in the tribulations knowing that god is working things out it's raining it's pouring but nevertheless god is bringing life hallelujah in the midst of the storm it's a peace somewhere in the midst of the rain when the sun comes out it's going to draw out the life of the dead ground hallelujah well it wasn't never dead it was just down under the dirt somewhere but it took rain it took light it took god bringing it out how many believe that i was sharing me and brother caleb was talking this morning and i said you know i told caleb i said i'm only 38 years old but i said the lord done brought me from a mighty long way i said now every day was not easy i'm gonna tell you that every day was not easy sometimes it looks like more clouds i know we sang the song the other way but it looks like more clouds sometimes then it is the sun i said but nevertheless like i told brother candle i said i'm stronger today hallelujah than i was yesterday i felt like caleb when he says he said yes god promised me this i think was 45 years ago a mountain he said and i'm 85 now he said but i'm stronger today than i was when the promise was made i've been through some storms i've been through some battles i might be a little older you might say hey the time is gone but if god made me a promise i don't care how old i get i don't care how my health feel god made me a promise and i want my promise hallelujah oh jesus you know i was praying with the guy just now before i came out and he was he was telling me he's going through it someone called and i said come on let's have a word of prayer we begin praying i said you know what it is i said lord you know we ain't asking you to do it come down and do it again because you said that with your stripes we are healed hallelujah you don't have to come down and do it again just give us faith to believe it hallelujah now be healed oh jesus how is it why because it's god that done it hallelujah i said let your faith pick up the word how many believe that this morning oh jesus says after you suffered a while make perfect come on god i want to make you perfect strengthen you god want to make you strong come on he said after you suffered a while he gonna make you perfect he gonna strengthen you i said when you weak god go strengthen you you say i'm suffering don't worry about his strength is on the way hallelujah you might be going through but all of a sudden you feel like hey i feel like traveling on i feel like going a little further why because you suffered but god promised he's going to perfect you and he's going to give you strength hallelujah do you believe that this morning strengthen you come on and settle you hallelujah i like that part settle you sometimes we have sleepless nights tossing and turning come on suffering afflictions but god he says i'm going to perfect you i'm going to strengthen you and i'm going to settle you come on settle down hallelujah don't worry about worm and moving on settle down come on what it is let god take over the situation i was sharing with someone the other week i said you know we always say give it to god and sometimes that's easier said than done come on sometimes it's hard to let go and give god things but when you learn how to hallelujah oh you can be wrestling with things day in and day out year in and year out but when you learn how to let go hallelujah and give it to god hallelujah oh no he says cast all your cares upon you me he says take my yoke he says and he said learn of me come on but my yoke is easy and my burden is light come on don't carry those burdens give it to god hallelujah learn i'm learning how to lean hallelujah you didn't always know how to lean you learn you learn how to lean that's what these trials and sufferings are doing they teaching you how to lean come on they teaching you that if god brought me through this then i know he's going to bring me through that i'm learning how to lean hallelujah i believe david on the back side of the the the the wilderness or whatever heard in the sheep he was learning how to lean he was learning how to trust and depend on the promise that god made him how many believed that this morning that when that lion came what was he doing learning how to lean hallelujah he went after that lion when that bear came he was learning how to lean hallelujah so when goliath showed up he knew how to lean hallelujah i like that song jesus said if you lean on me hallelujah i'll fight all your battles if you lean on me what are you doing learning how to lean how many want to lean on him this morning come on what are these trials and tribulations showing teaching you learn and how to lead me hallelujah learning that god you ain't never failed me yet come on that and you could be like paul when he says i'm persuaded come on that life death principalities powers rules darkness all no matter what it is come on angels nothing will separate us from the love that's in christ come on nothing can't be able to separate he says i'm persuaded i've been through enough now that i know hallelujah i ain't just saying it but i know i've been through enough that now i know i'm persuaded that life nor death principalities powers world shaking and everything else falling apart nevertheless i'm still here why because the word brought me here and the word is what's keeping me here right now hallelujah oh glory to god i said what it is it's god the whole time how many believe that this morning i says partakers of his glory he says he's going to str establish you come on strengthen you and settle you and this is you know i want me to finish this morning i won't be long but i says you know the thing is i says that you know peter here opening up he says he says that he says in the first verse who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of christ come on he talked about he was an elder but he says he was also a witness of the sufferings of christ not only did he physically walk with jesus and witness the sufferings that jesus went through but he went through suffering his own self come on he says i'm a witness of the suffering but he didn't leave it there he says not only am i a witness of the suffering he says and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed come on i said that's what we're talking about this morning being a partaker of the glory not only he says i witnessed the suffering but it was all for the good come on if i had to go through it i'd go through it again why because i'm gonna be a partaker of the glory that's to be revealed sometimes we look at uh great statues of people like like i was making an example one time we look at a sometimes an oak tree and a big oak tree and how it might be great and mighty and the roots of it it's stretched out and the limbs are so big and maybe that tree being around sometimes they'll say those oak trees may have been around hundreds of years come on and we marvel at the statue of that tree come on but we don't never take into account the seasons that that tree been through come on to get to the statue to where it is we don't take an account sometimes on the storms hallelujah i made a statement i said one time if trees could talk maybe they can tell you about some hurricanes that they've been through hallelujah maybe they'll tell you about some droughts that they made it through maybe they'll tell you about some cold winters that they made it through but they looked like sometimes they died but nevertheless they didn't die because the roots still had life in it you marveling at the tree but you didn't take an account of what the tree been through i've been through some storms i've been through some rains but nevertheless i'm still standing tall today hallelujah oh jesus so what it is it says what we go through things come on and then but you know god bringing you through these things to do what he want to show you all come on i said being partakers of his glory come on we want the glory but do we want to go through the afflictions do we want to go through the suffering i got many examples we wanted to go to this morning i wanted to talk about daniel come on we like oh i want to be like daniel come on but daniel had to go through something to get to that glory didn't he come on to get to that glory daniel had to go through the lions then didn't he he had to go through being bondage and all those things but in all of that brought out the glory didn't it come on because god never left them but god wanted to show that in the midst of a mess hallelujah then in the midst of you know in your worst condition when you had to look like the worst state when all hope is gone god wanted to show forth glory out of that hallelujah but how did he get the glory he had to go through didn't he those hebrew boys come on partakers of his glory they went through something to get to that glory didn't they joseph went through something come on to get through that glory come on let me get to that glory it says i'm a witness of it so don't we we take these things these light afflictions these things we go through and we don't lay down and die hallelujah but we keep pressing we keep praying we keep making it through hallelujah we say i'm taking it one day at a time hallelujah lord i'm depending on you god i'm waiting on you yeah the storm is hidden but god i'm still the anchor's still holding i'm still holding fast i'm still holding strong i believe job said don't enslave me yet i'll trust him hallelujah he said though the skin worms may eat this flesh yet in my flesh i'll see god come on he said in the last days i believe he said that i stand on the earth didn't he say that come on he'll stand on her he'll call my name one day and i'll answer how many believe that this morning but i said being partakers of his glory come on witness he says i witness the sufferings not only that i've been through come on but i'm gonna be a partaker of his glory you know what it is i says god you know looking at this age when he talked about this age he says that you know they'd be rich increased with goods ain't that what he said and how they said they'll say they have need of nothing come on but he says they didn't know what kind of condition they would be in they would be wretched miserable blind and naked come on just paraphrasing it in the world lost without god hallelujah they'd be in that condition and they wouldn't know it ain't that what he said he says but he says behold i'm standing at the door knocking any man that would hear me come on open the door let me and i'll come suck with him he told him he he made a cry he said i counseled thee to buy me gold tried in the fire hallelujah and i saw that i might anoint your eyes come on god he looked at this age and he knew that one thing this age would lack would be character come on i believe it was einstein made a statement once that that he was saying that he was he was afraid that technology would surpass humanity into a way that the people wouldn't even be able to socialize with each other wouldn't even be able to work things out they would lose just the decency of of the home living family life come on wouldn't know how to communicate they would like character hallelujah but nevertheless it doesn't matter which way the world is going hallelujah what god has called us to come on i'm counseling you come on i'm gonna come to me i'm gonna give you gold hallelujah tried in the fire hallelujah what is that trying about beating out all the impurities beating out all the dirt beating out all the sin beating out everything out of your life that you can come forth as pure gold how many believe that this morning tried in the fire whether those afflictions do trying you hallelujah i always say please be patient with me god ain't through with me yet hallelujah and god ain't through with you yet you know i was talking with my grandmother the other day it was kind of encouraging talking to her and she says to me she says jermaine she says they tell me i'm going crazy they tell me i don't lost my mind she says and i can't remember and all these things and i said well grandma i said are you crazy she said yeah i'm crazy like that i said well ken you lost your mouth yeah she said i reckon i have so i told her i said grandma how old are you she told me how she was she just missed it by a year but she told me when she was born and all and i said well grandma i said i'll tell you what i said the lord is mine and she said shepherd i shall not want i said if you repent and be baptized she said in the name of jesus christ or miss your sins you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost i said grandma i thought she was crazy i said what if somebody come tell you to be baptized and titled father son holy god she said uh uh uh-uh-uh-uh she said they can't tell me that she said i don't got it in me now hallelujah and i said no matter what i say grandma you forgetting but you ain't forgetting the word you know what she told me she said the word in there i'll never forget that come on though you might feel like you're losing your mind it's something about the word of god hallelujah that heaven and earth will pass away by this word hallelujah be there forever hallelujah she started she started laughing she said you know what jermaine she said you mismade my day that's what she said i said see that grandma said you might forget we all forget certain things but you ain't crazy i said don't let nobody tell you crazy come on you lost your mind then she said i ain't going i ain't been going to church because i ain't being able i said hold on you sound like them 10 them 10 spies saying you ain't they said hold up she said i'm able i'm able that's what she said i'm able come on but what it is it marvel i was marvel at that because how powerful the word is come on you can forget a lot of stuff but it's up about the word come on that's why it says train up a child and the way they should go clone and and not that they won't depart from it but it won't depart from them come on once you get the word in there come on when it's in your heart not in your head now but when it's in your heart come on it'll always be there and that's the part this that's the part when it gets down in your soul come on that's the part that that word in there though this body might be dead you still got life in you it's still the word in there hallelujah and one day when he called your name hallelujah it don't matter how long you been dead the prophet of god talked about the people that was torn to pieces by lions and burn and all that he says god has the ability to bring back all the ashes all the bone no matter what it is god has that ability come on to bring it back why it's the word of god hallelujah i believe he told ezekiel he says look on the valley of dry bones he says can he son of man can these bones live hallelujah he said lord thou know us he said prophesy out to the bones or bones hear ye hallelujah the word of the lord clicking and clacking and the bones came together didn't he hallelujah god didn't leave it like that flesh came on it come on the breath of life came in and what god wants to show us some things now we know what the problem of god's bringing out but what i'm saying even here today it ain't your word but it's god's word hallelujah it ain't that my body is feeling this way come on
