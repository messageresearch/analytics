[40:21] good
[40:23] fight I was kind of preaching on in
[40:25] Mullins but I'm talking to you now
[40:28] I fought a good
[40:32] fight you know sometimes we think that
[40:36] when we get the Holy Ghost all is well
[40:39] and we just sat back and relax
[40:42] and put the plane on automatic and get a
[40:46] land where we it's supposed to land
[40:49] automatic
[40:51] pilot amen just take me to my
[40:54] destination not knowing amen it's going
[40:57] to be some
[40:59] turbulence on that
[41:01] flight praise God and you sometimes have
[41:04] to amen take the wheel and the pilot
[41:08] have to come back and say hey it's some
[41:11] turbulence got to get this thing off
[41:14] automatic and then we got to fly blood
[41:17] these clouds and these storms and all we
[41:20] got to try to escape that or we got to
[41:23] go through it and while we're going
[41:24] through it I got to make sure
[41:27] I'm
[41:29] holding steady
[41:31] amen keeping it from
[41:35] crashing you got to realize though God
[41:38] is you're on the flight you're on your
[41:40] way to heaven and on your way to heaven

[41:45] started but you must complete your
[41:49] journey you must finish it amen you just
[41:52] can't start some
[41:54] people thank God and that's the way to
[41:57] the children of Israel they got out of
[41:58] Egypt and it crossed the Red Sea and
[42:01] they thought it was so it's we got it
[42:03] made now I'm saying your greatest battle
[42:07] is going to be within Egyptians was gone
[42:11] but they didn't know they themselves had
[42:13] their
[42:15] battles it was you now it wasn't the

[53:25] in church
[53:27] amen oh Lord let the devil get in the
[53:31] church disguise himself as a
[53:34] Christian goes on under disguise that he
[53:39] he's a Christian he's a Believer just

[54:04] amen praise God not all that came out of
[54:08] Egypt amen praise God had good
[54:10] intentions
[54:13] amen some that came out they came out am
[54:17] me with Moses some came out but you can
[54:21] pretty assume that they had their
[54:24] own uh agenda
[54:27] now the devil amen though he was next to
[54:31] God in heaven Lucifer the Archangel
[54:34] though he was next to God yet he was not
[54:37] satisfied he wasn't satisfied with his
[54:41] position where God how God made him and
[54:44] where God placed him amen you know folks
[54:48] amen when we when we don't understand
[54:51] our position our place in Christ and we
[54:56] don't understand our calling amen and

[56:16] other folk and and they can speak like
[56:18] this and speak like that and you get all
[56:21] caught up in that but it's stay in your
[56:23] lane now you might hear somebody that

[56:28] angel and you can hardly hold a tune
[56:32] amen but you got to stay in your lane

[57:53] chaotic they couldn't make it amen to
[57:56] the I
[57:58] mean it could have been just 11 days and

[58:33] by faith they was
[58:34] running praise
[58:36] God they was running their
[58:39] course but after a while what the they
[58:42] they took their eyes out it's just like
[58:45] the church even on the day of Pentecost
[58:47] they aimed at God they were
[58:49] running praise
[58:53] God but Paul found out they found lady
[58:56] he said as a wise master builder I have
[58:59] leid the
[59:01] foundation amen the building ain't
[59:03] completed yet amen it's not finished yet
[59:07] I'm I've laid the foundation amen amen
[59:11] you got to be careful how you build on
[59:13] this
[59:14] Foundation amen so Paul really realized
[59:17] I finished my course I I I I you know
[59:21] can you imagine the church Paul you know
[59:24] you had the Old Testament and and the
[59:27] Bible of the Old Testament and they read
[59:29] it and they knew it but here go Paul
[59:33] amen taking the seals off of the Old
[59:36] Testament and all of a sudden he's
[59:38] revealing to them amen all of that was
[59:41] just tipes and just Shadows of things to
[59:44] come I want you to know
[59:47] amen
[59:50] Paul he said behold I show you a mystery
[59:55] we shall not all
[59:56] sleep but we should be changed and
[1:00:00] somebody said well that's what uh joob
[1:00:04] was talking about I know my redeemer
[1:00:08] live and Paul was talking about a
[1:00:12] Rapture amen a place that God has
[1:00:15] prepared for us amen and the church was
[1:00:19] getting stirred on fire Paul coming out
[1:00:21] with the mysteries of the rature he's
[1:00:24] showing you how the Rapture is going to
[1:00:27] take place we should be
[1:00:29] changed in the moment of a twinking of
[1:00:32] an
[1:00:33] eye for the trunk shall
[1:00:37] sound amen and the dead in Christ shall
[1:00:40] rise first amen and we that alive and
[1:00:44] remain can you see Hallelujah you say
[1:00:47] that now look
[1:00:49] at everybody just said don't excite
[1:00:52] nobody why because they didn't heard all
[1:00:56] their life but what happened when Paul
[1:00:59] went out the
[1:01:01] scene Paul said after my
[1:01:05] departure Grievous W going to enter in

[1:03:03] experience they in the church but they
[1:03:05] never had they never really got
[1:03:09] saved though they went through the

[1:04:55] said they take this over
[1:04:59] there they're not going to be
[1:05:01] representing
[1:05:02] me are you with me amen because God

[1:29:58] he said there's a lack of love for God
[1:30:02] he said the people don't love God that's
[1:30:05] why they can't love one
[1:30:09] another that's where all the friction
[1:30:12] is like a love for
[1:30:16] God cuz when we got the love of
[1:30:21] God God looked beyond our faults
[1:30:25] and he saw our
[1:30:27] need he beyond all our error and all our
[1:30:32] mistake and he said I forgive
[1:30:35] you that's the kind of church you want
[1:30:38] to be in a church were are full of the
[1:30:41] love of God all the other stuff can mean
[1:30:45] a lot but people that really come with
[1:30:49] their mind I love God there's no problem
[1:30:52] with loving others when you can love God
[1:30:55] enough other than that you're going to
[1:30:57] see all the
[1:30:58] faults in everybody's
[1:31:01] life all the
[1:31:04] error but when you love God you realize
[1:31:09] Lord wo is me for I'm
[1:31:14] undone

[1:31:34] you I'm bubbling up in the
[1:31:41] inside cuz I don't feel I'm doing

[1:32:01] the greatest
[1:32:09] way because that'll be your
[1:32:14] position that'll be your placing where's
[1:32:17] the victory where's folks coming to the
