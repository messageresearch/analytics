[33:55] our Bibles out tonight but it's good to
[33:58] be here tonight to be in fellowship with

[34:02] I tell you when I got here we had a
[34:06] little dilemma
[34:07] the hotels was trying to get paid
[34:10] so they bought me
[34:13] yeah and uh
[34:16] brother Simmons came up there and we
[34:18] were trying to talk him into it and we
[34:21] really want to put the little lady under
[34:23] no type of pressure she boy she was like
[34:26] y'all don't do this to me I'm like what
[34:29] a manager he ran out and left you hole
[34:31] in the bag
[34:33] but uh by the grace of God we was able
[34:35] to get a nice room but it's a real nice
[34:38] room hey man so I appreciate that second
[34:41] Corinthians chapter
[34:42] um 12.
[34:46] um and we want to maybe start at the uh
[34:48] seventh verse
[34:52] but it's just good to be his it's always
[34:54] good to be here
[34:56] it's always good to see
[34:59] uh brother Simmons
[35:01] and his wife and family
[35:04] and uh
[35:07] everybody have it
[35:10] uh let's start at the seventh verse and
[35:12] it says and and at least I should exalt
[35:15] above measured through the abundance of
[35:18] the revelation
[35:19] that was giving me a thorn in the flesh
[35:22] the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest
[35:26] I should be exalted above measure
[35:29] for this thing I besought the Lord
[35:32] Thrice that it might depart from me
[35:36] and he said unto me my grace is
[35:38] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[35:41] made perfect in weakness most gladly
[35:44] therefore will I rather glory in my
[35:46] infirmities that the power of Christ May
[35:50] rest upon me therefore I take pleasure
[35:54] and infirmities and reproaches and
[35:56] necessities and persecution and distress
[35:59] for Christ's sake for when I'm weak then
[36:02] I'm strong let's bow his gracious father
[36:05] we just thank you tonight for just
[36:07] allowing us to be here to be in the
[36:09] house of the Lord tonight we just pray
[36:12] that father that you just uh use us
[36:15] tonight in some small way to just uh
[36:18] encourage this portion of the Bride of
[36:20] Jesus Christ
[36:22] Lord and that when it's all said and
[36:25] done Lord you can get the glory
[36:27] just hide me behind the cross Lord I'm
[36:29] just a man
[36:31] and uh I just thank you for all things
[36:33] traveling mercies for providing for us
[36:36] today
[36:38] we thank you for all things in Jesus
[36:40] name amen amen you may be seated
[36:42] uh I'd just like to use tonight
[36:45] uh for a little topic what God uses
[36:49] who God uses and how God uses and maybe
[36:54] we'll start out a little slow to kind of
[36:57] give you a little background
[37:00] but Larry always say this
[37:04] um he would always say he's not an
[37:06] evangelist and I'm not quite sure now uh
[37:10] what I am I don't have a church but uh I
[37:13] don't I don't conduct myself and act
[37:15] like an evangelist I'm getting older now
[37:17] brother Jeremiah so I'm I'm learning to
[37:20] take my time you know somebody young
[37:23] they might be up here doing sprints and
[37:26] running through the building but uh you
[37:28] know I got a few years up under me
[37:31] uh now and uh you know after preaching
[37:34] for just about 30 years you you start
[37:38] learning that uh
[37:40] excitement is good and I I enjoy
[37:43] excitement y'all just
[37:48] I normally try to keep my coat on but
[37:50] I'm a little
[37:51] a little warm uh you you find that in 30
[37:55] years of of uh ministering and and
[37:58] brother Simmons made a statement we was
[38:00] talking for a brief minute in the back
[38:02] he said we we can really see changes
[38:05] around uh around the the word of the
[38:09] hour
[38:10] right uh things aren't like they used to
[38:13] be people don't have a stand the way
[38:16] that they used to have a stand and and
[38:18] we we've seen a lot of people come and
[38:21] we've seen a lot of people go is that
[38:23] right
[38:24] and and so so uh our objective in the
[38:28] hour that that we're in is to try to
[38:30] make sure first and foremost that uh
[38:33] people are are steadfast people are
[38:36] stable I believe that that's the thing
[38:39] that the Apostle Paul taught in the book
[38:41] of Ephesians right he wanted to make
[38:44] sure that the people weren't tossed to
[38:46] and fro you know he wanted to make sure
[38:49] his his ministry was about under the
[38:52] anointing that he ministered under was
[38:55] to make sure that the people got the
[38:57] word
[38:58] right and that that the people were
[39:01] stable that that the people weren't
[39:04] weren't over here this week and over
[39:06] there next week and things of that
[39:08] nature right I believe that the gospel
[39:11] comes to to stabilize us to Anchor us
[39:14] into Faith to to make us uh sure about
[39:18] who we are as individuals that is that
[39:21] right uh wanna before we get started I
[39:24] just kind of want to uh make reference
[39:27] to something that I've preached it
[39:29] several times but uh
[39:32] just felt led to do it again uh
[39:35] uh we must uh have a basis for our stand
[39:40] is that right
[39:42] you it's it's so imperative that that we
[39:45] have a basis for our stand because what
[39:48] we found is so many people said that
[39:50] they believe the word of the hour and
[39:53] and then you know they've they've run
[39:56] and they've jumped and things of that
[39:57] nature now they're not around is that
[39:59] right
[40:00] and and what what that is an indication
[40:03] what that shows is that people weren't
[40:05] really anchored they didn't really have
[40:08] a basis I like something that brother
[40:10] Burley says he always come up with these
[40:12] crazy things he says if if you know
[40:15] people can bring you in with a hamburger
[40:18] somebody can take you out with the state
[40:21] is that right
[40:22] amen if you could be led in with a
[40:25] hamburger somebody could lead you out
[40:27] with a steak
[40:29] right but but if if you're grounded if
[40:33] if you're rooted right then then you you
[40:36] you you won't move
[40:38] is that right when when because things
[40:40] is going to come right you're going to
[40:43] face faith countless challenges right
[40:47] but but no matter what you face as long
[40:50] as you got a basis
[40:52] see you you got to be clear about why
[40:56] you're here
[40:58] right that's that's got to be clear even
[41:01] if you know sometimes people say well
[41:03] they don't run and things of that nature
[41:05] I'm not I'm not worried about whether
[41:07] you run and screaming all of the night
[41:09] I just I just want to drop a few golden
[41:12] nuggets off tonight so that so that you
[41:15] could leave and say you know what uh
[41:17] brother Smiley made a statement I must
[41:20] have a basis for my stand
[41:23] and see I'll quickly say this your basis
[41:26] can't be emotion
[41:29] right you you can't base it on emotions
[41:32] you can't base it upon some sort of
[41:34] feeling or something some Goosebumps we
[41:37] know that brother Brown I'm kind of uh
[41:40] line those things up and and our bases
[41:44] must be the word of God right see we we
[41:49] got to be sound
[41:52] we we got to be sound in this hour not
[41:56] just emotional
[41:58] see I in our emotions our emotions has
[42:02] got to be based upon something that's
[42:05] been quickened to us
[42:08] is that right like brother Bradham say
[42:11] stimulation of Revelation it's the
[42:14] revelation of the word of God that
[42:16] stimulates us and brings forth an
[42:19] emotion
[42:21] is that right not just because everybody
[42:23] in the building waving handkerchiefs
[42:28] I'm reminded of a story that a a sister
[42:32] told long time ago she passed away from
[42:34] uh Trinidad I think brother uh Simmons
[42:38] Lord's sister Joseph
[42:40] she said one time she was she was in
[42:42] church and uh he said this one this one
[42:44] couple had left this one Church to go to
[42:47] this this other church that they thought
[42:49] like we would say they got it going on
[42:51] over there
[42:53] and say and say the the prop the pastor
[42:56] was preaching it and and this is got
[42:59] nothing to do with Ministry it's got to
[43:00] do with you as individuals and so uh she
[43:04] she told me she said uh man the church
[43:07] was lit
[43:09] y'all know what I'm talking about
[43:11] the church was it
[43:13] and say the sister was jumping and and
[43:16] just screaming and pumping a fist and
[43:19] everything and and a husband her husband
[43:22] pulled her down
[43:24] say do you even understand what the man
[43:27] is talking about
[43:29] and she was like he say we going back to
[43:33] our old church
[43:34] right she she because they wanted to be
[43:37] where I was lit
[43:39] right but that wasn't the place where
[43:42] she was growing
[43:44] she was maturing so the man says listen
[43:47] it might be lit here for other folk
[43:52] but for us it's not lit because we're
[43:56] there's no growth
[43:58] and see that there's got to be growth
[44:01] there's got to be maturity there's got
[44:04] to be stability without without question
[44:07] it it's it's a must
[44:10] is that right and so when I was looking
[44:13] at this thought you know some time ago
[44:16] and and especially in today's society
[44:18] where we we find that you know it's it's
[44:22] there's a lot of people who's not really
[44:25] sure especially as it relates to our
[44:27] younger generation and not just young
[44:29] sometimes even us older ones we we come
[44:33] to a place in in our thinking because
[44:36] we're in a battle all the time and the
[44:38] devil brings things to our our minds and
[44:40] and we we get to this this spot where
[44:44] where we feel like we're we're in in
[44:47] some forms we are insufficient but then
[44:51] uh uh for me I just like to be able to
[44:54] look at something uh and see the way
[44:58] that God sees a thing
[45:01] right because a lot of times we look at
[45:05] ourselves and then we we look at other
[45:08] people and we feel like in ourselves as
[45:12] humans and brother Branham did it
[45:16] with a Ministry that went around the
[45:18] world and had discernment and and and
[45:21] and and and broke the word he looked at
[45:24] he looked at Oral Roberts in in all the
[45:28] things that Oral Roberts had and he
[45:31] looked at himself like
[45:33] man I ain't got myself nothing
[45:35] you know I got I got a little a little
[45:38] spot over here in the cut but this guy
[45:40] got a university and and he has this
[45:44] great big office and he has all of this
[45:47] and I could imagine In the Flesh a
[45:49] little depression kind of set in is that
[45:52] right
[45:53] and and God just kind of had to
[45:55] straighten him out like listen you know
[45:58] uh uh that's his portion
[46:02] I'm your portion
[46:05] but that makes the difference church
[46:07] when God's your portion
[46:10] is that right and so you know one of the
[46:13] things that that we have to look at we
[46:16] have to keep in mind that uh the
[46:18] scripture says that we're fearfully and
[46:20] wonderfully made
[46:23] is that right
[46:25] regardless of what anybody says about
[46:27] you what anybody thinks about you you
[46:30] know you may not have as much money as
[46:33] the next person you may not be as
[46:35] educated as the next person you know us
[46:38] as preachers we not may not preach the
[46:40] same has nothing to do with it
[46:43] because because you know what we're
[46:46] fearfully and wonderfully made and and
[46:49] we have our place in the body
[46:53] and I like this the prophet makes a
[46:55] statements say nobody can't take your
[46:57] place
[46:59] see and and that that makes a difference
[47:03] in our understanding when the enemy kind
[47:07] of comes in to try to bombard us with
[47:10] these shallow thoughts because you know
[47:14] we could we could you know
[47:17] become real carnal and Earthly
[47:21] right but we must have a spiritual
[47:24] perspective to combat the enemy when he
[47:28] comes in with carnal thoughts and common
[47:31] way of thinking it's important for you
[47:34] to be able to look at yourself as an
[47:36] individual and understand when God looks
[47:40] at you how God perceives you
[47:45] is that right
[47:47] amen when God saw me and brother Ernest
[47:50] he he knew what brother Ernest would be
[47:53] he knew what I what I would be
[47:55] he and he knew what type of Ministries
[47:57] he would give us is that right so we
[48:00] don't have to fight
[48:01] we don't have to get jealous we don't we
[48:04] don't have to you know and and I can
[48:07] remember when I first started pastoring
[48:09] years ago and uh
[48:12] this is back in the day when
[48:14] Charles pays and brother blue and all of
[48:17] us coming down I remember the first time
[48:19] I heard brother Simmons brother Simmons
[48:21] quoted just about the entire Bible by
[48:25] heart
[48:26] I don't know if he could still do that
[48:28] now he might can at seven he told me he
[48:30] was 70. but he he quoted I'm like
[48:34] this man is a machine
[48:37] and I have to paraphrase and and all of
[48:40] that and brother them brothers would
[48:42] come down and preach and leave the
[48:44] church and and I start crying
[48:47] oh God those Brothers
[48:51] and God just say hi son you gonna be all
[48:55] right
[48:56] you're gonna grow up
[48:59] you just a pup right now
[49:01] amen and if and it seems like they're
[49:04] Dynamic but you're gonna grow up and
[49:06] after a while
[49:08] that came to be the case people people
[49:11] would come in and preach and and and not
[49:14] really know the congregation as well as
[49:16] I did and and I would watch them some
[49:18] people who ain't said amen in six months
[49:21] tell the building down
[49:24] y'all know what I'm talking about
[49:26] right
[49:28] but they didn't know it they was just
[49:30] preaching but you know just that person
[49:32] might have had a spirit against the
[49:33] pastor
[49:35] that didn't make it right at all I was
[49:37] probably trying to do is bring them to a
[49:39] place of perfection
[49:41] right but but the devil had anointed
[49:44] them
[49:45] right but then but then you know as as
[49:48] you growing you're mature and you
[49:50] understand
[49:51] uh your allotment
[49:55] what the thing that's that's been been
[49:57] given to you as an adopted son
[50:02] right
[50:03] then then things don't even matter you
[50:06] you appreciate the word because you
[50:09] realize that iron shopping is iron but
[50:13] we're not in a contest we've been given
[50:16] a commission to perfect the bride
[50:19] right now the preaching contest I'm not
[50:22] I don't come to try to put all the
[50:25] swelling cloaks quotes together to try
[50:27] to make it feel like boy brother smiling
[50:30] deep
[50:31] well what what good is it it you know is
[50:34] brother being deep in everything and
[50:36] you're you're not getting anything
[50:38] you're not you're not being being stable
[50:42] you don't you don't understand you know
[50:45] who you are in in your peculiar I can't
[50:49] say that word to save my life y'all know
[50:51] what I'm talking about peculiarities I
[50:53] get tied tongue on certain words that's
[50:55] one of them huh why why you are so
[50:59] different
[51:01] right well you know uh it's such a
[51:04] so-and-so listen
[51:07] she got her allotment
[51:09] right in the body her place
[51:12] in her adoption her abilities right her
[51:17] inheritances and you got yours
[51:21] you just got to understand what's been
[51:24] given to you
[51:26] what what's your land
[51:30] see what's your land what's been lighted
[51:34] to you like Caleb
[51:36] I think Hebron was given to him
[51:39] see
[51:40] you you just got to know who you are and
[51:44] and what's been given to you and you
[51:47] just gotta be good with that dude
[51:50] and realize if if God has called you
[51:55] right into the body
[51:57] right you got a place you got a position
[52:02] you're needed
[52:05] I'll never tell I'll never tell my my
[52:08] left hand even though I'm right hand and
[52:10] left hand I don't need you
[52:14] it's just as much needed and it's my
[52:16] right hand
[52:18] it may not be able to do what my right
[52:22] hand could do
[52:24] right but but unlimited
[52:28] I just said something
[52:31] see
[52:33] listen church this church is limited
[52:37] when the people don't understand why God
[52:40] has called them to be here
[52:43] right
[52:45] and understand why they're hearing their
[52:47] function you you limit the church when
[52:50] you just really you know when we find
[52:53] people clamoring for positions and
[52:56] jockeying and things of that nature and
[52:58] cut throat and it's not even necessary
[53:05] it's it's not it and you know uh brother
[53:08] Brandon he makes a statement because he
[53:11] was talking about weakness
[53:13] right and and he was saying how much a
[53:19] message like that needed to be preached
[53:22] in the day in time that he preached it
[53:25] especially amongst Pentecostal
[53:27] Pentecostal church right and I believe
[53:30] we are
[53:34] not by denomination y'all know that we
[53:37] clear on that
[53:39] right
[53:40] but but by experience
[53:43] but sometimes you know things like this
[53:46] may seem simplistic but these things
[53:49] need to be preached so that people can
[53:52] be sure about uh who they are
[53:56] and why and why God places him in a
[54:00] place and why God may give this one
[54:03] person a mansion it may not just give
[54:05] you a double but give you a double wide
[54:09] right
[54:11] and you said well I just don't sound
[54:12] like that but people struggle
[54:16] come on
[54:17] people struggle in in these different
[54:21] things is that right I got I got an 11
[54:24] year old Cadillac and if I drive it to
[54:26] the job
[54:28] everybody just get bent all out of shape
[54:31] and it's sad that you have to explain to
[54:34] people this car got 165 000 miles on it
[54:38] and it's 11 years old
[54:40] right
[54:42] because people aren't sure you know
[54:45] about who they are
[54:46] and and they get carnal and they see
[54:49] something and they like trying to figure
[54:51] it out see you can't curse with God I'm
[54:54] blessed
[54:56] and if God blessed me with with a
[54:59] Rolls-Royce tomorrow right don't ain't
[55:02] no sense again been out of shape just
[55:04] ask me for a ride
[55:07] come on
[55:09] cause his father is for the Believers
[55:12] it's just use useful as long as I got
[55:16] breath when I ain't got no breath
[55:18] anybody can have it
[55:20] don't matter is that right
[55:22] glory to God but see we we get we get
[55:26] envious and jealous over
[55:29] frivolous things is that right things
[55:31] that really don't even matter that much
[55:35] but we just gotta understand you know
[55:38] God got us oh you know y'all on this
[55:41] side of Colombia Colombia is Big too
[55:43] a big old spot
[55:45] and brother Anderson them way over there
[55:48] and you know
[55:49] and and Swansea way down then
[55:53] right but but it's so that you know
[55:57] you're the lighthouse
[56:00] you're the lighthouse in this area
[56:05] is that right glory to God it's not by
[56:08] chance that you're here
[56:10] it was delighted by God predestinated
[56:13] for the foundation of the world
[56:17] right
[56:18] Oh Glory to God you say well you know
[56:21] what we may not have a church full of
[56:23] folk what that got to do with it
[56:25] right because God could fill up a
[56:28] building overnight a blinking a blink of
[56:30] an eye
[56:31] can fill up a building
[56:34] but sometimes God just you know have to
[56:37] uh retrain people
[56:41] reassure people
[56:43] re-establish people
[56:45] because you know sometimes we we we get
[56:49] we get a little carnal or sometimes you
[56:53] know we get a little uh a little amnesia
[56:59] right because we get a little shocked
[57:01] because we're in a battle
[57:04] is that right come on now go back to
[57:06] spiritual Amnesia I'm just gonna I'm
[57:08] just gonna talk preach however I'm doing
[57:11] it tonight
[57:12] but if you want to know something I know
[57:15] where I'm at I think these brothers are
[57:17] straight me out if I go off somewhere
[57:19] right they be looking at you like eagles
[57:22] but I ain't worried about it
[57:24] right because because you know we we all
[57:29] go through things and and you know it's
[57:33] important for people to be in church
[57:36] yeah
[57:36] I don't know Kobe Justin oh Lord
[57:40] exposed folks that's all Kobe did
[57:44] it exposed the real Believers from the
[57:47] make-believers
[57:49] well praise the Lord I ain't gonna get
[57:50] too many witnesses on that one
[57:52] I already know that
[57:55] right
[57:56] but but the True Believer the True
[57:58] Believer is consistent
[58:01] the True Believer understands his
[58:03] position he understands his place
[58:05] right he understands the authority
[58:08] that's been given to him is that right
[58:10] and so like like we were saying brother
[58:12] banham felt he felt the need you know to
[58:16] preach a message of perfect strength by
[58:18] Perfect weakness right uh because
[58:22] sometimes people just feel like you know
[58:25] they're weak and they're in their uh um
[58:30] insufficient and everything but
[58:33] just to try to straighten out like he
[58:36] said to straighten out our thinking and
[58:41] I don't know about you you know I always
[58:43] want my thinking straightened out
[58:45] see I I've in 30 years of preaching I'm
[58:49] not I'm still not above God
[58:52] right glory to God I'm not above God I I
[58:57] want to be able as as I const because
[59:00] it's all growth and it's it's constant
[59:02] maturity I want I want I want to
[59:05] constantly elevate
[59:08] right and and just
[59:11] spiritual things and natural things
[59:14] right I don't want to be so heavily
[59:16] minded I ain't no earthly good
[59:19] come on
[59:21] I remember I remember when I first got
[59:24] saved I realized you know a lot of times
[59:26] folks didn't really have a good good
[59:28] balance
[59:30] right
[59:32] they didn't really have a real good
[59:34] balance because it just just made us
[59:37] if I could use this word y'all forgive
[59:40] me spiritual uh I won't say it
[59:42] but you know we we were so
[59:46] that we was not not really
[59:49] uh functional
[59:52] as it relates to Earthly things
[59:56] right
[59:57] amen glory to God glory to God
[1:00:00] our mindsets
[1:00:03] right
[1:00:05] you know it was all
[1:00:07] I hate to say things like this but it's
[1:00:10] in my heart you know and I and I love
[1:00:12] the revealed word because it's the thing
[1:00:15] that has made me what I am
[1:00:17] right but it's other facets
[1:00:22] of the word that I wish I would have
[1:00:24] gotten early on you know uh in life that
[1:00:29] maybe I would be just even sometimes in
[1:00:32] a better position financially because
[1:00:34] the the message to me never preached
[1:00:36] that we had to be broke
[1:00:44] somebody preach with me
[1:00:46] that somebody can right
[1:00:49] and and and you know when I came along I
[1:00:53] started saying it and see sometimes we
[1:00:55] clown denomination and things of that
[1:00:58] nature and then when you look at it you
[1:01:01] like but but really it's not
[1:01:04] non-scriptural
[1:01:06] for people to have businesses
[1:01:09] and the people people with the right
[1:01:12] mindset because we do need money in the
[1:01:15] body of Christ
[1:01:16] lights ain't gonna get paid by
[1:01:19] themselves
[1:01:21] right
[1:01:22] amen and see for me I never wanted for
[1:01:25] my children to struggle
[1:01:28] come on
[1:01:30] amen you you want I've wanted for my
[1:01:33] children to be be smart
[1:01:37] self-reliant
[1:01:39] come on
[1:01:40] glory to God glory to God it's it's
[1:01:44] almost like the that uh Black Wall
[1:01:48] Street mentality was kind of taken out
[1:01:50] of the core African-American church and
[1:01:54] we just we just spiritual you know we on
[1:01:58] our way to heaven but we on our way to
[1:02:00] heaven broke and we don't have to be
[1:02:01] broke
[1:02:05] preach tonight whether y'all want me to
[1:02:08] right
[1:02:11] amen see go back and study this little
[1:02:14] thought right perfect strength by
[1:02:16] Perfect weaknesses it's it's in in
[1:02:19] brother branham's watch this now in his
[1:02:22] approach was to change the way that we
[1:02:25] we look at things
[1:02:28] the way that we look at weakness
[1:02:31] right because you you look well and we
[1:02:35] walk around like wowzy wow and Pull Me
[1:02:38] pro you wait a minute there's no Poe you
[1:02:41] in the body of Christ
[1:02:43] come on
[1:02:44] come on
[1:02:46] see you're a soldier
[1:02:50] glory to God and I'm quite sure man
[1:02:53] they'll root you out in in these
[1:02:56] branches if you you just piling away and
[1:02:59] weak and wimpy and all that bro you're
[1:03:01] gonna get killed
[1:03:04] and so if you if you'll study it right
[1:03:08] it's to change our and I got quotes but
[1:03:12] I'm just gonna preach tonight
[1:03:14] y'all go back and read
[1:03:16] come on I already know what's in on the
[1:03:17] book and then on the tape and then these
[1:03:19] notes too
[1:03:21] right
[1:03:22] but but
[1:03:24] so so that so that our mindsets listen
[1:03:28] Church never get complacent
[1:03:32] come on I don't care I'm 60 years old
[1:03:35] and I'm not complacent
[1:03:38] right I mean I'm I'm growing
[1:03:43] right uh now more
[1:03:46] than I have in the last year
[1:03:49] in the last few weeks
[1:03:52] in in my in my mind in the way that I I
[1:03:55] look at things and the way that you know
[1:03:57] I look at my children
[1:04:00] and and the way the conversations
[1:04:04] right that that I'm having with them
[1:04:08] right because sometimes you know uh as
[1:04:11] parents around the world and we we
[1:04:13] forgot that we used to drink liquor well
[1:04:15] praise the Lord
[1:04:17] and we forgot
[1:04:19] that we used to smoke weed and we've got
[1:04:22] we used to do all of these different
[1:04:25] things because now we holy
[1:04:28] praise the Lord
[1:04:30] we Sanctified Holy Ghost Field fire
[1:04:33] baptized blood running warm in my veins
[1:04:39] right
[1:04:42] but we can't even relate to our own
[1:04:46] unsaved children
[1:04:49] Lord
[1:04:51] well Lord help me
[1:04:53] huh we we don't even know how to relate
[1:04:56] we don't really know how to communicate
[1:05:00] right we we don't you know especially us
[1:05:04] as fathers and let me tell you something
[1:05:07] it's it's difficult I've learned I was
[1:05:10] talking to my son and and I just broke
[1:05:13] down talking to him and I I just I cried
[1:05:16] because sometimes I look back and I
[1:05:19] realize as a dad I failed
[1:05:25] Pastor in a church
[1:05:27] right you can pass it a church that
[1:05:30] still failed Moses did
[1:05:34] right Moses was so caught up in the two
[1:05:37] million people that had come out in the
[1:05:40] ministry and everything that he didn't
[1:05:42] even circumcise his own children his own
[1:05:45] child right
[1:05:47] and then the wife got in the wrong
[1:05:49] spirit
[1:05:51] when she throwed the bloody bloody uh uh
[1:05:55] you know foreskin at him
[1:05:58] right
[1:06:00] Lord help us
[1:06:02] Lord help us right and you you could
[1:06:06] preach the the truth in the revealed
[1:06:08] word but you can also be missing
[1:06:12] something
[1:06:13] right you could be missing something in
[1:06:16] the same token
[1:06:18] and and and I realized my son and
[1:06:21] talking to him he was crying and I was
[1:06:24] crying right and uh said well yeah I'm a
[1:06:30] human being they're my children
[1:06:33] and and I don't want to I don't ever
[1:06:36] ever want to fail them again
[1:06:38] right and and he was saying dad I always
[1:06:42] just wanted to talk to you as my daddy
[1:06:46] not as my pastor
[1:06:49] right
[1:06:50] because sometimes because sometimes as
[1:06:53] you know when we're looking at
[1:06:56] everything from a pastor of mine's set
[1:07:01] we miss things
[1:07:05] come on
[1:07:07] and then we you know we have this in our
[1:07:10] mind because because sometimes people
[1:07:12] are carnal and people are legalistic
[1:07:16] as it relates to the scripture in the
[1:07:18] Bible said this
[1:07:20] and and it's like we haven't we we have
[1:07:24] totally totally taken the blood off The
[1:07:27] Mercy Seat
[1:07:29] and there's no blood it's it's just all
[1:07:33] judgment and judgment right and and and
[1:07:37] sometimes you know and then I just I'm
[1:07:40] just using I'm using myself as an
[1:07:41] example and I hope this helped us all in
[1:07:43] the future
[1:07:44] right uh there sometimes you know your
[1:07:49] children just maybe want us to uh put
[1:07:52] our missionary code up our Pastoria coat
[1:07:55] our evangelist coach put that up and
[1:07:58] just be my dad for 10 minutes
[1:08:01] and and let me let me express myself as
[1:08:05] your son not not as a a man a congregant
[1:08:10] right
[1:08:12] and I tell you what we'll find ourselves
[1:08:16] we'll find ourselves probably winning
[1:08:20] our children more so than losing them
[1:08:23] because because with this spiritual part
[1:08:28] it should give us wisdom how to break
[1:08:32] ourselves down
[1:08:34] because this comes in our adoption
[1:08:40] right
[1:08:41] to be to be able to be sensitive enough
[1:08:45] to the spirit right not leaving the word
[1:08:50] but not not being self-righteous like we
[1:08:53] never did nothing
[1:08:56] all right
[1:08:58] and see you know I was talking to him
[1:09:00] and when I started talking to him I
[1:09:02] could see the spirit raising up because
[1:09:05] he wanted to be uh confrontational
[1:09:08] and I said whoa whoa whoa relax
[1:09:12] right control control the atmosphere
[1:09:16] right we look creators
[1:09:19] controlling the atmosphere and say
[1:09:22] listen I'm not talking to you to try to
[1:09:24] belittle you
[1:09:26] to put you down I understand you my
[1:09:29] child I Know Who You Are
[1:09:32] right parents
[1:09:35] sometimes our kids think
[1:09:37] you me in another form I was you once
[1:09:40] upon a time so you can't fool me
[1:09:44] right but I have to you know my kids
[1:09:46] ain't there around me it's like bro
[1:09:48] y'all not fooling me
[1:09:50] y'all my seed I understand you better
[1:09:54] than you understand yourself
[1:09:57] and regardless of what you're telling me
[1:10:00] I know where you're going outside of the
[1:10:02] new birth
[1:10:04] you you're gonna go in that same Circle
[1:10:06] that I went in and you ain't gonna go
[1:10:08] nowhere
[1:10:10] come on cause the new birth is the thing
[1:10:13] that changed to amen the course
[1:10:16] of my destiny
[1:10:19] is that right all of us should be able
[1:10:22] to say Amen to that the new birth a man
[1:10:25] changed the course of all of our destiny
[1:10:28] we was all Hellbound some of us wasn't
[1:10:30] maybe as bad as the other
[1:10:33] right but we were all on our way to hell
[1:10:37] but I ain't spin on sidewalk you was on
[1:10:40] your way to Hell Without this confession
[1:10:41] without this life without this new birth
[1:10:44] without this word
[1:10:47] right
[1:10:48] but but by by studying by studying the
[1:10:53] word and understanding what God uses and
[1:10:57] how God uses and what God uses right God
[1:11:02] God can't see a lot of times what what
[1:11:05] we find is and why we don't get the kind
[1:11:07] of results that we should be getting is
[1:11:10] because it's just so much of us in the
[1:11:12] way
[1:11:14] come on Church
[1:11:16] it's so much of us when when
[1:11:20] God God cannot use
[1:11:23] our human ability
[1:11:26] right you you if if we look at if we
[1:11:29] look at Moses right
[1:11:32] Moses was taught from a child what he
[1:11:36] you know he was born for right his his
[1:11:40] mother informed him you were a proper
[1:11:42] child you was raised up for this purpose
[1:11:44] him and Pharaoh looked out the same
[1:11:47] window but but they saw different things
[1:11:50] right but then but then uh uh Moses
[1:11:55] tried to get ahead of the thing and and
[1:11:58] do something
[1:12:00] and I believe God allowed that to happen
[1:12:03] so that he could fail
[1:12:05] Ure to show him that it's not my power I
[1:12:09] mean it's not by the flesh
[1:12:12] it's the spirit of God
[1:12:14] amen is that right he bitterly fell and
[1:12:17] found himself a runaway prophet
[1:12:20] see why if he hadn't delivered
[1:12:25] amen the children of Israel
[1:12:28] in in human man-made might that would
[1:12:32] have broke the types of the scripture
[1:12:34] come on preach with me somebody
[1:12:37] see because God has identified by his
[1:12:40] characteristics
[1:12:41] right and and what God uh displays in
[1:12:46] the beginning is the standard it's the
[1:12:49] pattern that he uses Through the Bible
[1:12:53] right just like back in Genesis with
[1:12:57] with Cain and Abel if God would have
[1:13:00] amen accepted the fruits of the field
[1:13:03] and and all of that he would have had to
[1:13:06] all the way down through the history of
[1:13:09] the scriptures
[1:13:11] amen put the stamp of approval on that
[1:13:15] is that right
[1:13:17] but then he would have had to say that
[1:13:22] Humanity's mentality and ability
[1:13:25] supersedes a man his mentality his his
[1:13:29] characteristics his order and and things
[1:13:32] of that nature is that right
[1:13:34] he would have had to say that you know
[1:13:37] what amen uh
[1:13:40] we need the Holy Ghost for
[1:13:43] right come on you you we would have had
[1:13:46] to take all of that out in the Bible
[1:13:50] right
[1:13:51] or if it's there it's it's contrasting
[1:13:56] right because there's the law contrast
[1:13:59] right and wrong come on
[1:14:03] good and evil things of that nature
[1:14:05] then
[1:14:07] fruits of the field and and the things
[1:14:10] that we do as human beings would have to
[1:14:14] be the standard and if that's the
[1:14:17] standard we gotta Miss we could just got
[1:14:19] a mess come on
[1:14:21] come on
[1:14:22] hello
[1:14:24] see if if if if
[1:14:26] the things that we could accomplish are
[1:14:30] the things that we do in the flesh was
[1:14:32] the standard we got a mask because God
[1:14:35] looked down in the Book of Jesus say
[1:14:37] well I just I'm fixing to whack this
[1:14:39] thing off cause I'm gonna repent that I
[1:14:40] even made man
[1:14:42] because look at what man has done
[1:14:47] right look at what man has done through
[1:14:50] human ability apart from God
[1:14:54] come on y'all want to preach with me now
[1:14:57] God was so vexed he said well I'll tell
[1:15:00] you what
[1:15:01] I just ought to clean this thing on up
[1:15:05] right
[1:15:07] come on because look at look at the
[1:15:10] imagination and we back in Genesis
[1:15:13] right so so what if what if from the
[1:15:18] beginning let's go even further back
[1:15:20] let's let's go back to Adam
[1:15:23] right when when Adam after amen he fell
[1:15:27] and and sold fig leaves right
[1:15:31] and to think about what amen that stood
[1:15:35] for if that would have been accepted
[1:15:39] well I'll tell you what it wouldn't even
[1:15:40] be worth going to church
[1:15:42] come on y'all don't talk to me
[1:15:45] come on right
[1:15:48] it smokes of denominationalism it just
[1:15:51] speaks to so many different things right
[1:15:55] but but then you know everything else
[1:15:59] that that we know is positive would have
[1:16:02] had to be negatives
[1:16:05] and I would want to be in the house
[1:16:06] somewhere never coming out because
[1:16:08] people would be showing up crazy
[1:16:10] if nobody had the Holy Ghost
[1:16:14] nobody
[1:16:17] no no Holy Ghost to keep these demons at
[1:16:22] bay
[1:16:27] you see what you see what the climate
[1:16:30] was in a day where they didn't have any
[1:16:34] open Word
[1:16:36] no profit and and and you know uh
[1:16:40] everybody was kind of doing what they
[1:16:43] felt was good in their own sight
[1:16:47] unfortunately now I thank God that we we
[1:16:50] have had a prophet we do still have the
[1:16:55] son of man Ministry
[1:16:57] right
[1:16:59] we do have that
[1:17:01] right and we're part of that we
[1:17:04] identified but we also are part of that
[1:17:06] but but think about it right and the
[1:17:11] other realms
[1:17:14] right
[1:17:15] glory to God where where the voice has
[1:17:19] been rejected
[1:17:21] look at the climate
[1:17:25] look at the climate
[1:17:28] right and and just everything go
[1:17:33] everything go
[1:17:37] to God it's it looks it it looks
[1:17:40] appealing
[1:17:42] right to the eye
[1:17:45] like like the service say you know it
[1:17:47] was a fruit to be designed and look you
[1:17:49] know Pleasant
[1:17:50] right
[1:17:51] even brother Banner brother Banner as he
[1:17:54] was kind of breaking down the Beast he
[1:17:56] know he said here's probably you know
[1:18:00] really handsome guy
[1:18:02] good on the eyes y'all want to talk to
[1:18:04] me
[1:18:06] all right
[1:18:10] y'all like
[1:18:13] huh
[1:18:15] right
[1:18:17] males and females brother Benham had to
[1:18:19] put across he wasn't crazy
[1:18:22] sometimes listen to Listen to brother
[1:18:25] Banner when he preached and how he
[1:18:26] describes
[1:18:28] he describes sometimes sisters he didn't
[1:18:32] describe him like he was crazy
[1:18:35] y'all ought to talk to somebody
[1:18:38] you see he he wasn't that spiritual
[1:18:42] he was but I mean in this he like man I
[1:18:45] got to put a cross up here
[1:18:47] he wouldn't need crosses all through his
[1:18:49] car now day
[1:18:52] y'all know to talk to me now
[1:18:54] come on man he would have to have
[1:18:57] crosses all around interior
[1:19:03] right come on
[1:19:05] come on
[1:19:07] cause they crazy now
[1:19:09] realistically realistically to think of
[1:19:14] to think of the things that
[1:19:17] men and women put on
[1:19:20] to come out the door to take pictures in
[1:19:24] skill in men and and
[1:19:28] Society is dumbing them down
[1:19:32] and and I'm I'm an advocate for looking
[1:19:34] good in style now I know I don't I ain't
[1:19:37] no antique box you ain't never gonna
[1:19:39] catch me like that but
[1:19:41] some of that stuff that you see these
[1:19:43] guys it's like right I don't know I'm
[1:19:47] sorry
[1:19:48] little jacket up here with this long
[1:19:51] dress on and all that kind of stuff it's
[1:19:52] like wait a minute wait a minute what
[1:19:54] are we doing
[1:19:58] but this but it just kind of shows you
[1:20:00] you know and the women just coming out
[1:20:02] but it just shows you prophecy being
[1:20:05] fulfilled also
[1:20:07] right and and I thank God for the son of
[1:20:10] man Ministry because it helps me to
[1:20:13] rightly divide things and look at things
[1:20:16] for what it really is
[1:20:19] and say what it actually is and I thank
[1:20:23] God for these brothers who who's not
[1:20:25] ashamed of the Gospel
[1:20:27] right that that's that understands the
[1:20:31] difference between wrong and right
[1:20:35] right because amen you know this world
[1:20:39] is is in a mess
[1:20:41] and and you realistically has to pity
[1:20:44] don't ever let the people of the world
[1:20:48] put a Pity Spirit on you where boy y'all
[1:20:52] going over there the brother Henry
[1:20:54] Simmons church and y'all be right out
[1:20:57] here wearing them skirts and boy and all
[1:21:02] that
[1:21:03] man you ought to just be proud as you
[1:21:06] want to be show layers
[1:21:10] you're outside I am praise the Lord
[1:21:14] you're not going to talk me into a short
[1:21:16] skirt
[1:21:18] come on tight skit down you know and
[1:21:22] they used to wear these them leotard
[1:21:24] things
[1:21:25] y'all know what I'm on my they used to
[1:21:28] wear that stuff back in the day up
[1:21:29] underneath something
[1:21:31] now they come out and they be out in 20
[1:21:34] degree 10 degree weather
[1:21:37] in that stuff
[1:21:39] in a coat where the rest of your clothes
[1:21:41] at it's cold outside
[1:21:46] last time here brother Jack and my wife
[1:21:49] and uh sister Erica we got there we went
[1:21:50] to we went to uh Arizona we had a
[1:21:53] meeting over there and man they were
[1:21:55] kind of chilling I ain't doing today
[1:21:57] they were prancing through there every
[1:21:58] little little leotard thing I just like
[1:22:01] this is absolutely crazy it just shows
[1:22:04] you it shows you why this thing got to
[1:22:07] be burnt off
[1:22:10] but then it it just really shows you if
[1:22:14] you try to bring that in the church God
[1:22:16] can't use that now remember what we're
[1:22:18] talking about what God uses right how
[1:22:21] God uses
[1:22:22] see God God that's why we needed a
[1:22:26] restoration
[1:22:29] right to set things in order
[1:22:32] because the religious World down Through
[1:22:34] the Ages was you know they had reformers
[1:22:38] right but they never lived long enough
[1:22:41] to move into another age and bring forth
[1:22:45] another portion of light
[1:22:50] right
[1:22:51] but then but then when the founders go
[1:22:54] off then they denominate they stop
[1:22:57] instead of moving on
[1:23:00] right and see even with Pentecostals
[1:23:03] under the restoration of the gifts
[1:23:06] right the Pentecostal Church Great
[1:23:08] Revival my grandmothers and uncles and
[1:23:12] all of them they came up Church of God
[1:23:13] Church of God in Christ and and all of
[1:23:17] those different churches
[1:23:19] man I'm quite sure they doing
[1:23:22] somersaults
[1:23:24] looking at the church now
[1:23:27] right and think about what brother
[1:23:29] Branham said he said in a hundred years
[1:23:32] he say the Pentecostal Church will be
[1:23:35] worse than the Catholic Church
[1:23:38] are y'all gonna talk to me look at look
[1:23:42] at look at the prophecy
[1:23:45] right
[1:23:47] and and you have to ask yourself the
[1:23:49] question
[1:23:50] if if we've been restored back
[1:23:54] right to the original work the original
[1:23:57] faith holy decency and all of that
[1:24:03] can God use that only in a permissive
[1:24:07] will
[1:24:09] it's permissive
[1:24:11] at best it ain't perfect
[1:24:15] because that which is perfect has come
[1:24:21] right
[1:24:22] the intelligence of God is here
[1:24:26] and everything you know uh that's in
[1:24:29] part should be done away with
[1:24:32] it right as far as I'm concerned
[1:24:35] but you see we're best about how you say
[1:24:37] it say that you know they're getting
[1:24:39] people and they're doing this and
[1:24:40] probably yeah it is permissively
[1:24:45] right but I want to be in God perfect
[1:24:48] Wilson solutions to say in your that's
[1:24:52] where I want to be Lord
[1:24:55] all right
[1:24:56] that's where I want to be look and she
[1:24:59] are going all right that's where y'all
[1:25:01] want to be Lord y'all didn't come to
[1:25:03] have church with me that's
[1:25:05] huh y'all just got to follow me rock
[1:25:08] with me when I rock
[1:25:11] if I'm rocking y'all mother that's where
[1:25:13] I want to be Lord in your perfect right
[1:25:18] not in the permissive will
[1:25:21] see God didn't change his mind about his
[1:25:24] word when it came down to uh balam
[1:25:30] right no men no
[1:25:34] right
[1:25:36] well you know he said no but just maybe
[1:25:38] let me go ask him again
[1:25:40] no he ain't changed his mind okay you're
[1:25:42] gonna go anyway
[1:25:44] and since you're gonna go anyway going
[1:25:46] on
[1:25:47] but she'll never be able to curse him
[1:25:51] right no no matter no matter no matter
[1:25:54] how you dislike them
[1:25:57] right no matter how you dislike them
[1:26:00] no matter you know because uh what I
[1:26:03] gotta think now
[1:26:05] balac
[1:26:07] was the King right
[1:26:08] they took him up and showed beta look at
[1:26:12] this look at them people man
[1:26:15] don't want to be God's people just show
[1:26:18] them the high parts right
[1:26:20] amen he what what that meant he just
[1:26:23] showed them all of all of their wrongs
[1:26:27] God I was like I already I already know
[1:26:29] that
[1:26:30] that telling me nothing new but you
[1:26:33] still cannot curse them
[1:26:38] right
[1:26:40] you know it ain't like God don't know us
[1:26:45] but what God has blessed nobody can't
[1:26:48] curse and what God cursed nobody came
[1:26:51] bless
[1:26:52] is that right if you were in the mind of
[1:26:55] God before the foundation of the world
[1:27:00] God don't see your little minor mistake
[1:27:02] because he know you're gonna make those
[1:27:03] things right
[1:27:06] the Holy Ghost will were you
[1:27:10] huh so after a while you be sitting
[1:27:13] there you just get to telling on
[1:27:14] yourself and confessing and making
[1:27:16] things right
[1:27:17] if you got the Holy Ghost if you were in
[1:27:20] the mind of God
[1:27:22] is that right because because those are
[1:27:25] the kind of people that God uses
[1:27:29] how much time I got
[1:27:31] see God God uses God uses people that I
[1:27:36] feel
[1:27:37] is that right God uses people that has a
[1:27:41] life
[1:27:42] is that right God uses people that are
[1:27:45] humble
[1:27:47] is that right God uses people and things
[1:27:51] right that that you know has mastered
[1:27:55] human ability that understands it's got
[1:27:59] to be God
[1:28:01] oh it won't work
[1:28:04] if it ain't God it won't work
[1:28:07] if it ain't God operating this gift it
[1:28:10] won't work it will not produce the
[1:28:13] results
[1:28:16] is that right I'm glad I ain't all I'm
[1:28:18] I'm not illiterate like I used to tell
[1:28:21] the church now I may not be as smart as
[1:28:23] some folk but don't don't play with me
[1:28:26] God it will kind of
[1:28:29] intellectually hurt your feeling
[1:28:32] I think that part of me will come alive
[1:28:34] I I mean I ain't been to school in a
[1:28:36] long time but every now and then it's
[1:28:39] surfaces
[1:28:41] to let intellects appear you ain't that
[1:28:43] smart
[1:28:45] it just take me a minute to to get a
[1:28:48] hold of that big words you might have
[1:28:50] used but once I'm able to break it down
[1:28:52] or I'm riding with you baby
[1:28:55] come on
[1:28:57] come on it's true anyhow
[1:29:00] amen that's the truth anyhow I see it I
[1:29:03] gotta know and that makes me my time to
[1:29:05] go law
[1:29:08] hey I feel good now
[1:29:13] how did I can't come up here
[1:29:16] hey what it's a good atmosphere up in
[1:29:19] here now you know y'all may not be
[1:29:21] running all around around the building
[1:29:23] but it's the kind of atmosphere that
[1:29:27] that I can break into things right and
[1:29:30] and show us things by the spirit about
[1:29:33] about a message not not just reading a
[1:29:36] quote
[1:29:38] no wrong with reading the quote sometime
[1:29:39] I read sometime I don't but I know
[1:29:41] what's in my heart already
[1:29:43] I already know I know it's it I just
[1:29:46] studied for 30 years I already know what
[1:29:48] brother Brandon talk
[1:29:50] sometimes when I really really want you
[1:29:52] to get the
[1:29:53] um of what he said I might read but I
[1:29:56] already know what he said cause I've
[1:29:58] been studying and I understand the
[1:30:01] spirit behind it
[1:30:05] what is he trying to do what by this
[1:30:08] word he's trying to produce see in
[1:30:11] perfect strength and I'm gonna go and
[1:30:13] perfect strip but he's trying to change
[1:30:15] the way that we we think the way that we
[1:30:18] look at things help us to see this is
[1:30:21] how God sees you
[1:30:23] it's it's the weak and and and and those
[1:30:28] types of individuals that God uses on
[1:30:32] the front line to get the job done that
[1:30:37] is a quote
[1:30:39] right and so when we well I'm so no no
[1:30:45] no you just write for God
[1:30:50] and see in that same message brother
[1:30:52] Brandon tried to encourage the young
[1:30:55] ministers
[1:30:57] right
[1:30:58] Amen in the young lady to stay humble
[1:31:04] because we you know what I'm just gonna
[1:31:06] say this we're living in a generation
[1:31:08] now where this I
[1:31:11] I don't know what day is now
[1:31:13] uh what y'all help me uh what's the
[1:31:17] generation supposed to be now because
[1:31:18] they they change so much X
[1:31:21] uh whatever ZZ I don't know what they is
[1:31:24] my my son them at one point they was
[1:31:27] talking about their little generation is
[1:31:29] uh well I can't think good now right and
[1:31:32] they had this little attitude going
[1:31:34] where the where the this and we don't we
[1:31:37] don't we don't y'all just disrespectful
[1:31:40] that's just how all you might as well
[1:31:42] say
[1:31:43] y'all disrespectful y'all don't y'all
[1:31:47] don't respect authority
[1:31:50] come on y'all try to uh you serve
[1:31:54] position right with a little bit of
[1:31:56] knowledge
[1:31:58] you know more than the people walking
[1:31:59] around like man sit down
[1:32:04] he used to be tired I used to just hey
[1:32:07] you know I'm glad I got a good spirit
[1:32:09] about that I didn't want
[1:32:12] sit out
[1:32:15] of the house chew
[1:32:16] and you ain't that deep
[1:32:19] I can't stand people to think that they
[1:32:23] so smart and they're so deep and you
[1:32:25] don't know nothing
[1:32:27] that insults my integrity
[1:32:30] my righteous indignation Rises up
[1:32:34] sit down somewhere
[1:32:38] because you ain't special you ain't all
[1:32:41] that
[1:32:42] right and people be pumping them
[1:32:51] need to stay on his knees is that right
[1:32:55] before the devil tricking
[1:32:58] come on
[1:33:00] come on
[1:33:02] look what he said go back and read it he
[1:33:05] was talking to young lady members and
[1:33:07] all because he's saying the man who
[1:33:09] think that he can get the job done he
[1:33:11] can't get the job done
[1:33:15] if he feel like he could pull it off
[1:33:17] ain't gonna do nothing but make a mess
[1:33:21] that's the Bible
[1:33:22] right but but it's it's that it's that
[1:33:25] one little brother that come in with
[1:33:28] with you know sometimes little suit and
[1:33:32] a little cold up to the side he's
[1:33:34] sitting in the cut and you don't think
[1:33:36] he nothing
[1:33:37] right in the moment God touch him again
[1:33:41] you'll be like
[1:33:44] yeah that one you ain't thinking nothing
[1:33:48] right
[1:33:49] amen because sometimes you know you you
[1:33:51] look at this maybe my last statement you
[1:33:54] you think about when when God said you
[1:33:57] know the prophet uh uh to to uh get one
[1:34:02] of uh Jesse's Sons right
[1:34:04] and boy all these Big Fellas come out
[1:34:08] right man real big Scrappy handsome
[1:34:13] fellows and all that they're all
[1:34:16] wouldn't even come out
[1:34:19] huh he pranced all them fellas through
[1:34:22] there no all came out nowhere
[1:34:26] the prophet said I know he told me to
[1:34:28] come down here uh do you have another
[1:34:31] son
[1:34:34] he had to think about it it seemed like
[1:34:37] yeah we
[1:34:40] where are you at
[1:34:44] he out there with the Sheep he ain't
[1:34:47] much of nothing but yeah
[1:34:50] you know he probably ain't much doing
[1:34:53] because the daddy was looking at all
[1:34:55] these boys like they was his pride and
[1:34:58] joy right they was in the Army come on
[1:35:03] they were supposed to be Warriors
[1:35:05] and David out there killing animals
[1:35:08] bears and lions
[1:35:10] right
[1:35:12] glory to God they go get David
[1:35:16] and the oil just come running I'm quite
[1:35:19] sure daddy was sitting there dumbfounded
[1:35:23] but that meets in the characteristics of
[1:35:26] God God hidden and revealing simplicity
[1:35:31] and then and then and then you know
[1:35:34] he sent David out there to the battle
[1:35:37] right and and told him take this out
[1:35:40] there to your brothers and them you know
[1:35:42] they they see him coming once you come
[1:35:44] out here to spy on us
[1:35:45] right
[1:35:47] now they back up in the cut scared
[1:35:51] all of the big handsome boys right
[1:35:54] supposed to be Warriors and the King had
[1:35:57] his shoulders Above the Rest
[1:36:00] huh had to be bowed out by a little
[1:36:04] Ruddy fella with the spirit of God on it
[1:36:09] huh
[1:36:13] so so I I'll say this I made a statement
[1:36:16] I made a statement uh a couple of weeks
[1:36:19] ago in Sarasota
[1:36:20] and I was telling I was telling the
[1:36:23] parents don't ever don't ever
[1:36:27] uh uh size up your children
[1:36:31] and and and put one child over the next
[1:36:34] child because he seems like he may be a
[1:36:38] little bit more than the next child
[1:36:41] we're fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:36:44] God made us different
[1:36:47] you can't point at that child and say
[1:36:49] you need to be like him he cannot be
[1:36:52] like him
[1:36:54] he was never made to be like him
[1:36:57] right and and all you you'll do is is
[1:37:00] cause trauma in the child's life trying
[1:37:04] to get that child to be something he was
[1:37:07] never ordained to be
[1:37:12] huh I'm telling you I could preach that
[1:37:15] now I got five boys
[1:37:18] right and and you know my oldest he is
[1:37:21] what he is
[1:37:23] right and and you know
[1:37:27] he was always that one you know it was
[1:37:29] out there and and you look at this this
[1:37:32] one here and you say
[1:37:35] it'd be no no no no no he don't
[1:37:39] he fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:37:41] he'll find himself he'll come to himself
[1:37:45] he'll find out what he good at because
[1:37:48] he may not be good at what this one good
[1:37:51] at
[1:37:52] because he was never ordained to be that
[1:37:58] and we cause trauma
[1:38:00] and man I came outside brother ran up to
[1:38:04] me he said boy brother Smiley he said
[1:38:06] boy I was so glad you preached that
[1:38:09] he said because the very thing I was
[1:38:12] getting ready to do I was getting ready
[1:38:13] to tell my other two boys y'all need to
[1:38:15] be like y'all Big Brother
[1:38:18] he not the standard
[1:38:21] you're not
[1:38:23] stand it
[1:38:25] it
[1:38:26] no he's not
[1:38:28] amen because they individuals
[1:38:32] so he cannot be the standard
[1:38:35] right
[1:38:37] he can only be himself
[1:38:39] right
[1:38:41] come come to to a spot as an individual
[1:38:45] but but you you can't just look at the
[1:38:48] rest of the children boy y'all ain't by
[1:38:50] nothing
[1:38:53] right and not be the very one to leave
[1:38:55] home and never think about you
[1:38:57] never call you on the phone y'all notice

[1:54:13] your life to Jesus Christ in the day
[1:54:16] is your day
[1:54:19] to surrender your life
[1:54:21] and ask Jesus
[1:54:24] I was teaching on Wednesday and
[1:54:27] something
[1:54:28] about
[1:54:31] salvation and so forth and
[1:54:35] and just came on me real strong today
[1:54:39] you know the Lord has already saved us
[1:54:43] when he died on the cross
[1:54:47] and people want to do some kind of work
[1:54:49] to get this salvation or to save
[1:54:51] themselves
[1:54:53] maybe I get baptized
[1:54:56] maybe I'll do this I'll do that
[1:55:00] but if you could have done anything to
[1:55:02] save ourselves Jesus wouldn't have had
[1:55:04] that he wouldn't have had to die
[1:55:08] but the reason he died because
[1:55:11] we need
[1:55:13] the blood of Jesus
[1:55:16] amen he can't he's the savior
[1:55:21] and I just try to stress that he's the
[1:55:24] Savior and you let nothing take the
[1:55:26] place of the blood of Jesus
[1:55:29] nothing takes the place of the Cross all
[1:55:32] you got to do to accept what he's done
[1:55:35] and if you accept what he's done then
[1:55:39] you've received
[1:55:41] amen
[1:55:44] your deliverance your salvation whatever
[1:55:47] the need is Jesus did it for you
