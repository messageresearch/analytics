the Book of Romans amen thank you Jesus how many say Lord have your your way tonight Romans the 8th chapter I think it's 8th chapter let's look Romans the 8th chapter let's start at Verse 18 Romans 88:18 I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worth worthy be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who have subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the everybody say the adoption the adoption to wit the Redemption of our body father bless these words that we've shared Lord anoint them oh God and Lord God bring the inspiration and open it up to your people even more so than what they've already know in the name of Jesus Christ we give you the praise the honor and the glory in Jesus name let you say Amen you can be seated so um I I say tonight that amen that it's not going to be long before everything that we've been waiting on everything that we've been expecting everything that that we've been hungering and thirsting for is going to come to pass how many believe that tonight say amen amen now I'm looking at that clock because I'm not going to keep you too long tonight but how many you been looking at the news come on how how many you been looking at the news if you haven't um there's something happening in the Middle East there's something taking place and I know uh brother Simmons probably and shared with you the the uh the nature of what's going on but God servant said time was not allowed to the Gentiles amen time was not allotted to uh the G Gentiles meaning uh there wasn't a specific amount of time given to us other than uh the uh the time period where Grace came to the Gentiles after the Jews rejected their Messiah how many know that when they crucified the Lord Jesus it opened a door of grace to you and I well how many thank God for that today amen and that's the fullness of the Gentiles a time period that at uh that started around ad60 when uh acts the 13th chapter when Paul said uh L we turn to the Gentiles amen and in that time period it's called Uh the seven Church ages amen that's why uh the anointing was on God's servant to go and and and pull out of History who those seven Messengers were Amen to pull it out of History amen we know Paul was the first first one to laid the foundation but we know also the seventh messenger was William Brown how many believe that say amen that's the grace age to us Gentiles but when those Seven Seals were revealed how many know that that seven seal message was revealed it was the capping off of the Gentile Church how many thank God for that tonight when no s were revealed The Headstone message came down and capped off the church capped it off no more message to the Gentiles no more message needed because the Seven Seals sealed it off it sealed off the pyramid it sealed off those who were forn by God Amen those who he fornew he called and those that he called he is already Justified and those that he's Justified he's already glorified how many can say tonight I thank God that I'm one of them oh come on somebody how many know who you are tonight that seven seal message capped off the message to the Gentiles what's next what's coming next I'll tell you what's coming next two prophets going to rise up in the Middle East and they're going to preach the same message to the Jews amen and and our Revelation 7 chapter manifestation going to take place where the Jews are going to receive the Holy Ghost the same holy ghost that you and I haveed oh how many thank God tonight that the holy ghost that we have received is the revelation of Jesus Christ oh how many thank God tonight that God have chosen you from the foundation of the world to reveal his son in you oh give him praise for that amen come on come on somebody give him praise somebody shout hallelujah hallelujah how many believe that you have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost let me see your hands tonight how many have received the revelation of Jesus Christ let me see your hands tonight thank you Jesus well let me say this to you you are a special people you're special amen you are a people that was forn by God before the world was oh come on somebody you were forn by God you were chosen by God Amen for this day and for this hour amen and the Bible says the whole creation is groaning waiting for you and I to understand who we are for you and I to to to manifest that which is inside of us oh somebody say amen hallelujah we have the revelation of Jesus Christ it was God above us in the Old Testament in a pill of fire in a pill of cloud it was God With Us when the Lord Jesus came and the fullness of godhead was inside of him bodily amen it was God in Christ but now it's God in you and I oh how many believe that say amenah I know you have heard it many times we've heard it but now the whole creation is waiting for you and I to get in position and to manifest that which was inside of us thank you Jesus to manifest it amen to get in position amen stop waiting on the preacher to do everything amen stop wait waiting on the deacons to do everything sons of God Daughters of God are being manifested why we're sitting here tonight and and what do they manifested to do what what what is the purpose for what God did for us and has done for us is it for us to come here and just get fed and get fat on the word and let's go home and and just's do what we usually do no no the Holy Ghost is given that he might continue the work of Redemption on the earth the Holy Ghost is given to equip you with power to be a true witness of the resurrection of Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost is given that he might continue the work of Redemption where people are going out into the world and witnessing that Jesus Christ is still alive and I wonder what you doing with your Holy Ghost what are you doing with your Holy Ghost hallu thank you Jesus Hallelujah I'm not taking it from you I'm I'm I'm I'm acknowledging that God has given it to you why because by grace are we saved through faith which is a gift of God Amen the love of God has been revealed to us God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son amen and that love projected and it has produced an end time bride amen and you are one of them oh how many believe it tonight let me see your hands if you really believe who you are tonight thank you Jesus thank you Jesus the Bible in the book of Hebrews 11th chapter said all of those Old Testament saints that suffered amen that um allowed themselves to be crucified or killed or Marty they can't be made perfect without you oh God thank you Jesus they're waiting on us I could read it but I'm I'm just going to quote it you go back and read it the whole creation is waiting on the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God for them to be made known thank you Jesus and and God has already given us what it takes to be manifested I'm going to read something now let's go to St John the 1 chapter and I'm going to testify just a little bit when I get to the end of the message because I believe I believe that God is is already given us what it takes to manifest him he's already given us the Holy Ghost he's already given us the revelation of Jesus Christ he's already opened up the seals and capped off the church how many thank God for that tonight the next thing that's going to happen is the rapture it's the Rapture and I believe that it's at hand it's not far off it's at hand and how many know the only ones going in that Rapture those who have rapturing faith come on how many believe that say Amen the only ones going in that Rapture those who have that faith that perfect Faith amen that works by love amen faith

sent to Bear witness of that light that was the True Light with light of every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not amen he came unto his own and his own received him not amen who is that that he came to when he came the first time he came seeking the lost sheep of the House of Israel how many believe that say amen and they received him not they didn't receive him but one thing about it one thing about it all Israel is going to be saved amen why because God blinded them intentionally how many thank God tonight that God blinded his people so that you and I could be brought in oh somebody give him praise tonight amen oh somebody give him praise tonight somebody say thank you Lord for your mercy because if they would receed that Messiah none of us would be here tonight but let me read on he came unto his own his own received him not but as many as received him how many have received the Lord Jesus come on how many have received the Lord Jesus come on how many has really received him in your heart how many has the love of God been shed abroad in your heart oh come on somebody how many have have heard the word of and believed the word and have passed from Death unto life oh somebody give him praise tonight amen hallelujah thank you Jesus I ain't saying nothing with you that you haven't heard before I'm here to stir up your uh your mind about what God has done and what he is expecting out of us notice this as many has received him to them gave he what power to be become what the sons of God even to them that what believe on his name well yeah brother Jackson I've read that scripture before and you know I know that's the word but let me let me let me put it in perspective how many you know that if you're a son or daughter of God how many know that you are God's oh my that went over with a big thud how many know you are amateur Gods oh somebody say Lord help me to understand my position how many somebody say Lord help me to understand who I am he has given us power to become God's power to become rulers over our condition power to become rulers over our circumstance power become rulers over all that the devil can throw at us glory to God Power To Tread on serpents amen power to cast out Devils amen power to raise the dead power to heal the sick power to redeem those that are bound by Satan power

scripture is saying he has given us [Applause] power hallelujah thank you Jesus what are you doing with what God has given you thank you Jesus but to as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name Oh Glory God thank you Jesus you know um God servant preached a lesson on adoption he preached it four times um he's preached spiritual adoption once and in those lessons he he went back before the foundation of the world he talked about how he was Elohim the self-existent one one existed by himself and while he was existing by himself he had desires inside of himself to manifest himself he wanted to be a father how many know he wanted to be a Healer how many know he wanted to be a deliverer how many know he had all of those desires inside of him Amen to be a savior and what did he do what did he do he expressed himself and the Bible ible say Jesus Christ was a lamb slain from the foundation of the world how many believe that say Amen our Salvation didn't start when we came to church it started before the world was thank you Jesus he ordained you and I to receive the revelation of Jesus Christ before the world was oh somebody give him praise tonight amen oh somebody say thank you [Applause] Lord which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God and the Word was made what flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glor is of the only begotten of the father full of what Grace and trueu in that lesson on spiritual adoption or adoption God servant um he pivoted he told uh the church that um they are gods and how many believe the Psalms 82 says that do I need to read that amen Psalms 82 says that that you are Gods I want you to do something for me I want you to reach over to somebody and shake the hand and said hello Miss God or Mr God come on I want you to confess it with your mouth thank you Jesus what happened when God created a man in the Garden of Eden what happened he gave him what Dominion he gave him dominion over all of the um of his creation what happened to that Dominion that he gave what happened to his his his sunship or his authority when he went out uh in sin with his wife he lost his sunship he lost his authority over the Earth and where did it go to it went to the devil how many know the devil has been running um loose upon the Earth for I don't know 6,000 years or so but how many know his time is coming come on how many know that's why the whole creation is groan waiting for who the manifestation of you and I is waiting for us to understand who we are thank you Jesus in that lesson God servant pivoted to Abraham and he talked about um Hebrews the 7th chapter where um meis day talks about me KDAY and I always wonder why in adoption series he was talking about me KDAY but how many you know there was a purpose behind that melkisedek without father without mother without beginning of days end of life who was melkisedek somebody tell me who he was he was God see Paul was talking about in Ephesians 1 uh God has revealed unto us the mystery of his will who is he revealing these Mysteries to and why is he revealing these Mysteries to you he's revealing the mystery secrets to you so that you would uh have the Revelation from Genesis the revelation of the word so that the word could be made flesh in you how many believe that say Amen the word be made flesh and new what was the significance of mesed he came to Abraham after Abraham Abram actually commissioned his servants in his house they were farmers and Shepherds to go after the kings that had come against Sodom and gomorra Waring Kings that had come against Sodom and gomorra and when those kings came against Sodom and gorah guess who got caught up into it one of Abraham's relatives how many know that's right say amen and they and lot was taken captive in his whole house and one of the men that was um witnessed to what had taken place came to Abram and told him lot has been taken captive lot has been taken captive what did AB do it serves him right he shouldn't have looked down there to the plains of whatever he looked at the Jordan the well water place it's it turns them right to go back in the world and I ain't going out there against them Kings cuz all I got is a couple hundred little uh peasants that's working in the field how am I going to go after a king that's got an army God knows how many uh Warriors He's got that now had came against 10 Kings eight Kings something like that and defeated them all how am I going to go after you know that's the thoughts that some of us have when we hear about one of our relatives that got bound up and crack cocaine or they got messed up in something um that they messed up in the law or or maybe somebody done got um Bound by the the devil as far as a an Affliction what am I going to do about it let me tell you something you have the authority from God to go after them how many believe that say Amen you have the anointing to go after them what did Abraham do or Abram do he took his hired servants so those was raised up in his house he equipped them and he went after the Kings he went after them and how many know that he won the war oh how many believe that with a hundred or so servants I don't know how many it was 100 200 he went after King that had multitudes of Warriors and he beat them down how many believe that say Amen why because God was with him why because he was a manifested Son of God that's why he won the battle somebody say Amen am go that's why he won the battle at night he went out against them and he won the battle and he brought back all the goods all the goods all of it that the enemy had taken captive oh come on somebody say amen amen somebody shout hallelujah not part of it all of it he brought it all back yes and how many know God has anointed us to go after our loved ones to that the devil has bound and we'll bring them all back we ain't leaving a hook in Egypt amen oh somebody shout hallelujah hallelujah I know I'm I'm shouting at you but I really believe that bring them all back bring them all all of them you you you children of Abraham by faith amen go after them thank you Jesus amen if not now then when if not who then if not you then who go God has provided everything we need what happened when Abram came back with the goods here come the king of Sodom give me the the people and um you keep all the other stuff give me the people he wanted the people back how me know that's what the devil does after the battle's over and the Victory is won he wants you to come back in bondage under him what did Abraham say he said I I'm I'm not taking a sho latcher from you because you'll come back and say that you made Abraham Rich how many believe that say amen and after that um after he had that experience what came MEC mesc came to him without father without mother without beginning days without end of life and what did mesc do he gave him communion how many believe that say amen he said Blessed Be Abraham of the most high God Amen and Abraham um gave him a tithe of all how many believe that say Amen who is meis the mystery of God being revealed God came to that manifested son it was God and gave him communion and how many know the Bible in Matthew 26 says the Lord Jesus said I'm not going to eat the fruit of the Vine with you while I'm here but I'm going to eat it a new with you in the Kingdom how many believe that when we get in position come somebody say Lord help me to get in Possession come on somebody say Lord help me to get in possession L say it like this Lord anoint me to go after my lost loved ones say it Lord anoint me to go after my lost loved ones and when the battle is over how many know that we're going to get caught up together with him and we're going to go to the marriage supper of the Lamb where the Lord's going to drink wine with us oh how many believe that say Amen come on how many really believe that say Amen what else is there to do before the Rapture goes what else is there to do everything has been done everything has been prepared now it's time for us to get up and go do something with what God has given us thanks somebody say thank you Jesus there was a thought that I had is leaving me the whole creation is is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God amen thank you Jesus it'll come back to me so so what what is it that we ought to be doing with what God's given us what are we what all we ought to be doing I'll tell you um when I came into this way when the Lord blessed me to come into this way I didn't come into it the Lord draw me into it amen once I heard uh these things you know Daniel 70 weeks and and all of the great Mysteries that God opened up it lit a fire inside of my soul it lit a fire inside of me and that fire wasn't going to uh just uh sit and burn in the church but me and another brother or we decided that even though we wern't preachers we wern't we wern't even professing to be preachers but it lfy in us to go out and witness to different ones about what God has done and is doing how many you know that's what ought to be happening in the church now a fire ought to be burning inside of your soul a Holy Ghost Fire amen and ought to make you like that woman at the well when the Lord Jesus revealed himself to her she went into the City and said come see a man that told me everything that I ever done isn't just the very Messiah isn't just the Christ she stirred up a whole city and it came out to see the Lord Jesus how many know that you have that potential inside of you oh come on somebody say Amen somebody say well I I Ain I ain't got it like brother Simmons got it I ain't got it like the preachers got you know what I remember a lady that was come to the church in in my house in in the in the basement you know she brought more people uh to that meeting to those to those Services than any Preachers did and you know what the scripture that she used there was one scripture that she had there's a way to seem him right unto a man and the end there of is the ways of death she used that scripture to evangelize of the city let Church amen you don't have to have it like the Priestess got it if you ain't got nothing to say just tell how your fire got lit oh how many believe that say amen and what will God do these signs shall follow them that believe let me say this and and and I'm going to say this and then I'm going to testify a minute or twoo how many believe believe that there was three pools in the ministry of Malachi 4 first pool was healing second pool was discernment but the third pool was what spoken word Spoken Word Ministry I can point back to that wave sheath and say what he said he said it has been thoroughly identified amongst you five times was it used on his wife amen on um that lady who had her sons in the room when the whole house shook and and God asked him uh to tell her to ask whatever she want she get it had it right she asked for her the salvation of her sons God gave them to her the squirrels were created how many believer say Amen storms were stopped amen five times was it used and here's what God's servant said he said this he said it has been identified amongst you how many believe that the third pool has been identified amongst us come on how many believe the third pool has been identified amongst us but he said it won't be utilized in its fullness until what that counsel clamps down but me say this I'm saying it in respect uh to what God is doing in this church I know God is doing great things in this church but all I can do is testify of what God is doing um in the little Ministry that we have done a um that third pull that spoken word it's already being manifested it's been manifested and it's been manifested in a humble way it's being manifested in in a way that's outside of the mainstream but it's being manifested amongst the brides I'll give you a recent testimony it was a sister in our church her name was George howman I'll just call her name out and um she's a sister that's done been through a lot and been through a lot of Trials and a lot of uh tests and but she's hanging in there how many thank God tonight that um that you're hanging in there come on how many thank God tonight that you you're hanging in there you haven't um allowed the enemy to push you away get a lord of hand clap praise amen thank you Jesus this sister um had been witnessing to her her blood sister down in Atlanta uh blood sister Atlanta um professed to be a woman preacher and she's in denomination and um but yet still George loves her sister and she' been testifying to her well what happened recently was that she had a heart attack she had a heart attack it was a massive heart attack so much and so that when um Geor heard about it she got on a bus to Atlanta to go and see about her sister while she was riding on the bus being a Praying Woman like she is she began to pray Lord go before us and and meet us there Lord help my sister uh before I even get there Lord I send your anointing and and break the Yoke and she said it like this now I hope I can say it like like she said it she said just a scripture came to her mind how many you know God speaks through his word come on how many Believers say amen he said ask whatever ever you will and it shall be done how many know that scripture that scripture came to her mind R Simmons and and she kept that scripture in her heart when she got to Atlanta and she went in the room and witnessed all the tubes and everything that was coming out of her uh sister uh you know I don't know what kind of tube breathing tubes and all kind of tubes that her heart was like mush is what what the doctor said they wasn't given a no hole she said when she got in the room her continence just dropped because she saw a sister at at at the point of death and and and she just you know she she kind of forgot about what God told her how many know that's what happens when we look at circumstances come on how many believe that say Amen am but as she sat there the spirit of God spoke to her again ask whatever you will and it shall be done here's what she did she got all of her little nieces and nephews that was in the room and and her uh sister's uh fiance I believe it was I I don't know and she got them together and said let's pray and all the nieces and nephews came together and they joined hands and and the fiance wasn't going to come she said well come pray with us and he did she and she asked him said why don't you pray he said no no no I I ain't praying I can't pray how many thank God for a manifested son and daughter of God she said I'll pray and she don't even remember the prayer that she prayed it was a simple prayer probably Lord move on my sister something like that she don't remember but but said after she prayed she went and sat down and over time the uh machines that was monitoring her sister begin to come to a normal State you understand what I'm saying how many how many done seen people on uh intensive care the machines begin to read normal the the one that was breathing for begin to alarm and they called it the the doctors in and when the doctors came in they said no that's good because she don't need the the machine she's breathing on her own come on how how many believe that say Amen come on somebody say Amen but let me tell you this now and I'm going to stop because I can go on I can talk about some things but while the doctor was in the room she had another heart attack another heart attack and then the doctor to begin to work on her work on her work on her work on her and finally after so much of times of working on her they they got her stabilized and machines went back to normal went back to normal doctor came over and began to question her he began to question her he he was asking her about her faith cuz she had heard that she prayed and she told him I believe in him that dwells on high and looks down low and he told her he said You Keep On Believing on him because in our experience somebody who's heart is in that condition when they have two heart attacks they just about gone they gone but something has happened in this room to your sister that your sister is still holding on Let Her Say Amen what happened what happened God anointed a manifested daughter of God to move on the spoken word oh somebody say Amen oh somebody give him praise amen and what happened that was last week sometime I believe it was and this week she got a call from Atlanta a sister hadn't open eyes yet but yet she was still you know what I mean maintaining she got a call from Atlanta that the sister had opened her eyes and guess what they were feeding her with uh you know liquids and she asked for a hamburger she wanted a hamburger oh somebody shout hallelujah somebody shout praise the Lord she wanted a hamburger the doctor said you ain't eating no hamburgers not what you done going through you Ain eat no hamburgers we going to keep feeding you this this this liquid but how many know our God is God just sweetly real sweetly the spoken word is coming back into the cow I had a sister her name was Betty Williams um she suffered with diabetes and heart trouble for long years her mama said at the funeral that um the doctors didn't give her to live to she was about 30 something 35 or something because she had Ms multi sclerosis I believe is that what it is right she

expect her to live till she 35 but um she had many many battles with um her body many battles and the last battles that she had um they her son threw in a nursing home and when she went in that nursing home her body just went down totally went down to the point that the nursing home was was shipping her back and forth to the to uh to intensive care and um long story short is she she was uh in intensive care and she's about gone she she's literally about dead but she had expressed to me a desire to go home to her house to go home to her house and she wanted to go home to her house before

I fell on the floor fell on the floor she said she checked my post and it wasn't there she immediately went to the phone and called The Paramedic and said my husband has had a heart attack but she before she did I think she beat on my heart right she beat on my heart I'm looking at her to see whether I'm telling it right cuz she say I tells it wrong you beat on my heart right okay she hit my heart and then post came back post came back she went and called the paramedics paramedics came to to the house and you know they did what they do strapped me into that chair and took me into that thing and had all them things um hooked up to me they was asking me Mr Jackson you feeling any pain I said I ain't feeling no pain said anything going on in your body I said no ain't nothing going on in my body nothing got me to the hospital did the EKGs and all that stuff they couldn't find a trace of a heart attack they couldn't find a trace but they kept me overnight and um still ran some test and all couldn't find nothing wrong couldn't find a thing wrong they let me go and when they let me go my heart rate was down well in the hospital my heart rate was down to 40 was it 40 something or 30 something 30 something that means you you in heart failure in heart failure but they kicked me out the hospital because I wouldn't let them put a pacemaker in me I told that doctor said I ain't get

wouldn't even giv me an appointment cuz I wouldn't let them put that pacemaker in me my regular physician recommended another heart doctor from Augusta and they saw me and when I went to see him first
