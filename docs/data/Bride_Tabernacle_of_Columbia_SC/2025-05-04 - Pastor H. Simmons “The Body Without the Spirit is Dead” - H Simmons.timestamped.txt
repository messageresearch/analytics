[20:10] [Music]
[20:16] [Music]
[20:27] Okay. So, last week was finals weekend.
[20:31] So, you know, you take the test and you
[20:33] get your grade and then you pass or not.
[20:36] So, I took my the hardest exam I took
[20:39] this semester was for my business calc.
[20:42] And I tell you, I was studying hard. I
[20:44] had a study buddy with me. We we p we
[20:47] every day. So, I take the test Thursday
[20:51] and yesterday I finally looked at my
[20:54] grade for the total of the class. My
[20:57] grade came up to a
[21:01] 69.76. That is one point away from
[21:04] passing with a C. I was upset. I went to
[21:08] mom. I said, "I don't know what to do.
[21:10] We're going to have to change my summer
[21:12] classes cuz I need this math class to in
[21:14] order to keep going." And then we were
[21:17] trying to figure everything out. And mom
[21:18] was like, "Just email them." I said, "I
[21:21] can't do that." And she said, "Why not?
[21:23] Just email them and ask. You're one
[21:25] point away. just ask for the point. I
[21:28] said that can't happen because that
[21:30] won't happen because there's this girl
[21:32] in my class, she had there they had a
[21:36] rule that if you made a certain average
[21:39] on a test throughout the whole semester,
[21:41] you could exempt the final. And this
[21:44] girl, she had the right p the right
[21:46] answer on her paper, but she circled the
[21:49] wrong one. Like she had all the work and
[21:51] it led up to the right answer, but she
[21:52] circled the wrong one. And when she
[21:54] asked him if he could just, you know,
[21:56] excuse that mistake cuz the answer was
[21:58] right there. He said no. And I said,
[22:00] "Well, how is he going to give me a C?"
[22:02] He told her no. When she clearly proved
[22:04] that she knew what to do for that
[22:06] answer. So mom said, "Just email him."
[22:08] So I emailed him. In the email, I was
[22:10] like, "Hello, you probably don't know
[22:12] me. I was in your class though. I was
[22:14] attentive. I asked questions when I had
[22:17] them. My name is Grace. I mean, you
[22:21] know, please, if there's anything I need
[22:23] to do to prove that I deserve one point,
[22:27] just let me know. And uh, you know, I
[22:31] sent it in the email and everything and
[22:33] I was like, I'm going on vacation. I'm
[22:35] not really going to stress about this.
[22:37] So yesterday in the kitchen, I was
[22:40] sitting down and this morning I was in
[22:42] the kitchen and Joy was near my phone
[22:45] and she was like, "Grace," he said,
[22:48] "he'll give you a C." I was
[22:51] like,
[22:53] "Yeah." Yeah. And all he said was, "I
[22:56] will give you a C." That was it. I said,
[22:59] "Oh my gosh, thank you, Lord. Now I
[23:02] don't have to fail a class." Yeah.
[23:06] So, we wanted to sing this
[23:13] song. I'm looking for a
[23:17] miracle. I expect the
[23:20] impossible. I see the
[23:24] invisible. I feel the
[23:28] invisible. I'm looking for a
[23:31] miracle. Heat. Heat. Heat.

[35:20] grandmother family and sister hope
[35:23] there.
[35:26] Okay, let's just Father, in the precious
[35:30] name of Jesus Christ, we thank you
[35:32] again for being here this morning with
[35:37] us, Lord. Yes. For you said when two or
[35:40] three are gathered in my name, there I
[35:42] will be in the midst. So Lord God, we
[35:45] welcome your presence. Lord, we pray
[35:48] Lord that you would say something, do
[35:51] something that would cause us, oh God,
[35:54] to draw nigh unto you. And you said you
[35:58] would draw nigh unto us. So, Father, I
[36:02] pray, God, that you would touch the sick
[36:04] and afflicted, those on the prayer list,
[36:08] little brother Crawford, Lord, oh God,
[36:11] they're trying to feed him, Lord.
[36:14] So, Father, we pray God that you would
[36:17] work things out, Lord. God, you've done
[36:20] it thus
[36:21] far. And Lord, you that begun a good
[36:25] work, you you're able to complete it,
[36:28] Lord. So, Father, I just pray, God, this
[36:31] morning, God, that you would minister to
[36:33] each and every one of our needs in the
[36:36] name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[36:42] The book of James, the 2nd chapter, the
[36:45] 26th
[36:49] verse. I was just looking over some
[36:52] things
[36:54] and message
[36:57] Noah. It's not Amen.
[37:02] And something really came into my spirit
[37:05] real
[37:06] strong and I trust that I'll be able to
[37:10] share it with you. I don't know if the
[37:11] words can properly
[37:14] explain but I thought on this scripture
[37:18] here for as the body without the spirit
[37:22] is dead so faith without works is dead.
[37:26] Amen. May God bless you his word. You
[37:28] may be seated.
[37:34] You know, I thought about so many times
[37:36] people lay before the
[37:39] altar and we say that they are
[37:43] dead because the spirit is gone.
[37:51] Sometimes people lie in the hospital and
[37:54] and they said they're not breathing on
[37:56] their
[37:57] own. They're gone. They they're
[38:02] passed. But sometimes through a
[38:04] incubator or machine, you're able to,
[38:08] you know, prolong the
[38:11] time. And sometimes
[38:14] it's they look at the brain and see
[38:16] whether or not it's
[38:18] functioning and it's not functioning.
[38:20] And then it
[38:21] says it's brain
[38:24] dead. So we got all kind of medical
[38:28] terminologies
[38:29] concerning what death
[38:32] is and when death is
[38:36] determined. And with all these different
[38:39] types of medical
[38:42] terminologies through scientific
[38:45] means, there's a spiritual application
[38:49] that we would like to apply here this
[38:52] morning.
[38:54] And I just want to talk to you a little
[38:55] bit and and I trust I won't be
[39:00] long. But it came
[39:03] so look like I just
[39:06] spontaneously in my
[39:09] spirit. The body without the spirit is
[39:12] dead.
[39:14] I'm just
[39:16] saying what part of
[39:19] you, you know, because
[39:22] sometimes most of our attraction, most
[39:25] of the things we do,
[39:28] uh, we're concerned
[39:29] about it is the
[39:34] body. And uh what makes us so concerned
[39:38] about the body, how it
[39:42] looks,
[39:44] because if it does not have the
[39:48] spirit, it's
[39:51] dead. And I thought about Ephesians
[39:54] 2 as we look into the spiritual
[39:57] application which we're trying to get
[39:59] there. Ephesians 2 and
[40:03] one it begins to
[40:07] say about death, spiritual
[40:11] death. Because we can look at what we
[40:14] think about in the natural death, the
[40:18] body without the spirit is dead.
[40:24] I I had the opportunities many times to
[40:27] see almost like you see something just
[40:30] go up out of the body and it just goes
[40:34] and all of a
[40:35] sudden person just
[40:38] out. I remember one time I working in a
[40:42] hospital I seen the spirit just
[40:46] and the person became stiff right away.
[40:50] Boom.
[40:53] In a few seconds
[40:55] we call cold blue and everybody getting
[40:59] ready just come
[41:02] back. Just came
[41:06] back. I says,
[41:08] "Oh, before you could
[41:11] start doing CPR or whatever and trying
[41:15] to revive him, he just came back."
[41:20] That's how quick we can go and God can
[41:24] bring us back if he wish choose to.
[41:26] Amen. Amen. But life is somewhat like a
[41:30] vapor. It's here today, it's gone
[41:31] tomorrow.
[41:34] And I just
[41:35] wonder and this is uh the point I was
[41:40] dealing with the
[41:43] mind. The
[41:46] mind is see we were talking about
[41:52] uh the breath of life that we
[41:58] have somewhat he says it didn't come
[42:01] from God but it was permitted by God.
[42:07] The life that we have when we come in
[42:09] this world, we were born in sin shaped
[42:12] in
[42:13] iniquity. So it was
[42:16] permitted by God. Are
[42:21] you so God gave us we have a we're
[42:26] living because God permits us
[42:28] to by
[42:31] permission because it didn't come forth
[42:34] right. We were born in
[42:37] sin shapen in
[42:40] iniquity come to the world it say
[42:43] speaking lies or
[42:45] whatever. So we by nature were the
[42:47] children of wrath.
[42:50] Amen. We were
[42:52] enemies in our minds by wicked works. We
[42:56] were against God contrary to God. Now,
[42:59] why would God permit that kind of nature
[43:01] to come or that kind of spirit to come
[43:06] in the
[43:09] world? I think God had a
[43:12] way even through that God
[43:16] had people that he
[43:19] forneew that he had for known before the
[43:22] foundation of the world. Amen. that
[43:24] would come forth in the world as
[43:27] sinners, but God will make a way of
[43:31] escape.
[43:34] This corruptible, this corrupt nature,
[43:37] corrupt
[43:39] mind. Now we know that the body is the
[43:46] physical. It's dust,
[43:49] dirt. Dust th and dust thou shalt
[43:52] return. naked came out of the word,
[43:54] naked shall I return and so forth. But
[43:57] what do we really why do we spend so
[44:00] much time glorifying dust?
[44:04] Amen.
[44:07] Because it's not the dust so much that
[44:10] controls our life. It's the spirit.
[44:15] It is the spirit that controls our life.
[44:20] Cuz this body Amen. without the spirit
[44:23] is dead.
[44:29] But I heard the scripture said, "We must
[44:32] be renewed in the spirit of our mind."
[44:37] Are you with me?
[44:40] In other words, he said on one occasion,
[44:42] "If any man be in Christ, he's a new
[44:45] creation." Amen.
[44:48] I I'll get there hope hopefully. But he
[44:50] said, "And you has he made alive at
[44:54] Quicken who were dead in trespass and
[44:57] sin, when in time past you walk
[45:00] according to the what?"
[45:03] See, he he he talks about your walk, the
[45:06] way you live, that he he styles that you
[45:10] were dead.
[45:13] Are you with me? Amen.
[45:15] You were dead without the spirit of God
[45:19] in you, then you are actually dead.
[45:24] Amen.
[45:25] Spiritually spiritual death.
[45:29] So being spiritually
[45:31] dead people because they have a
[45:36] permitted life, God has permitted you to
[45:39] exist on this
[45:42] earth by
[45:46] permission. Are you with me? Because the
[45:49] day they ate of the tree, that's the day
[45:51] they
[45:53] died. Don't touch it. Don't eat it. If
[45:56] you do, you'll die. Are you with me?
[45:59] They sinned and they died
[46:03] spiritually. Are you with
[46:05] me? And as a sinner,
[46:08] if God has made a way like he did for
[46:12] Adam, he made a way for you and I. Amen.
[46:16] He has made a way for us.
[46:20] That we don't have to stay in the
[46:22] condition that we were born in. Amen.
[46:25] Amen. That's why Jesus told Nicodemus
[46:28] you must
[46:30] He didn't say you might or you uh you
[46:32] can't. He said you must be born again.
[46:37] If you expect to see the kingdom of
[46:39] heaven if you expect to enter into the
[46:42] kingdom of God, you must be born again.
[46:46] Amen. Why? Because our first birth that
[46:50] was permitted when we were born, we were
[46:52] born in sin. Amen.
[46:55] Sometimes I said we were still born. We
[46:57] were born dead.
[46:59] Are you with
[47:01] me? We said cuz sometimes people are
[47:04] dead and don't know they dead.
[47:08] Amen. And you and I Amen. thought we
[47:10] were living but we were dead.
[47:13] Dead in our sins. Amen. Without the
[47:17] spirit of God, you're spiritually dead.
[47:21] Amen. Amen.
[47:24] So, who would want what can we do with
[47:27] somebody when they dead?
[47:31] You got that? What?
[47:35] Are you with
[47:38] me?
[47:39] So, he says, "You walk according to the
[47:43] course of this world." Are you with me?
[47:46] Amen. The world will uh cause you to
[47:51] walk a certain way.
[47:56] Hallelujah.
[47:58] It'll cause you to walk a certain way.
[48:01] Carry yourself in a certain way. Amen.
[48:04] But I want you to understand that this
[48:07] body ain't nothing but dust. Amen.
[48:12] So you you got long hair, short hair, no
[48:15] hair.
[48:17] It don't make a difference. Amen. The
[48:20] body without the spirit is dead. Amen.
[48:24] Are you with me? Amen.
[48:28] Some folk, white, black, yellow, brown,
[48:30] blue, black, uh it doesn't make a
[48:33] difference. The body without the spirit
[48:35] is dead. Amen.
[48:38] You know, it was said concerning a a
[48:43] sculpture that made a sculpture
[48:46] uh of Jesus, I think it was. And uh and
[48:52] the sculpture did such a job. And
[48:56] everybody that looked at the sculpture,
[48:59] they looked at
[49:00] it and they said, "Boy, I wonder what
[49:03] the uh sculpture had in mind." what the
[49:07] artist had in mind when he made the
[49:12] sculpture. The people just wagged their
[49:15] head and looked at it. Wonder what they
[49:17] had in mind when they made Oh, this in
[49:21] other words, they thought this this
[49:24] sculpture or this person that did
[49:27] this, what a what a mess they
[49:31] made. And
[49:33] then
[49:35] so somebody walked up, this man and his
[49:38] wife, somebody walked up to him and
[49:40] says, "Sir,
[49:46] um, I know what you're thinking." He
[49:49] said, he said, "Yeah, I wonder what this
[49:55] sculpture, what this person was thinking
[49:57] when they made this sculpture." And he
[50:01] said, "Yes, everybody that looks at it,
[50:04] most people think, "Oh, what a terrible
[50:07] job or whatever." You know,
[50:11] man, you know, then he says,
[50:15] "Well, you
[50:18] know, he said, "Well, you're looking at
[50:22] it wrong."
[50:24] You know, so often in times in life, we
[50:28] can be looking at God from the
[50:33] wrong
[50:35] place. We can be looking at things
[50:38] wrong. Amen. You know, so many times you
[50:42] see I don't see see what that thing see
[50:46] God to a lot of people is not
[50:49] attractive. It don't look beautiful. It
[50:52] don't it don't look like something that
[50:55] you know would attract your attention
[50:57] would you would you you know you would
[51:00] esteem to be you know
[51:03] uh but he said you're looking at it
[51:05] wrong then he says let me show you
[51:08] something because they were at a
[51:11] distance he said come on and he took
[51:14] them
[51:15] closer and then in the closeness you got
[51:20] to get
[51:21] down and you look
[51:24] up. And when they looked up,
[51:27] ah, what a beautiful
[51:29] sight. And see, sometimes you got to get
[51:32] down
[51:34] and look up.
[51:37] Amen. Are you a friend? But as long as
[51:39] you are far
[51:41] off and looking, it don't look like
[51:43] something
[51:44] you understand. What?
[51:47] What? You know what God has in mind for
[51:51] you and I in our lives? Amen. What how
[51:55] you know it don't look so beautiful.
[52:00] Hallelujah. But when we get down
[52:02] and look up,
[52:05] oh what glory. Amen. Oh what beauty.
[52:10] Amen.
[52:13] says it's like in a man that does not
[52:16] have the spirit of
[52:17] God. He's a far off and he looks at
[52:22] God. If you don't have the spirit of
[52:24] God, you look at God and he may not be
[52:27] so beautiful. You might not understand
[52:31] why is it lack because of the way you
[52:33] act.
[52:36] Because you're so far off. That's right.
[52:39] Amen. There was no beauty to be desired
[52:41] of him.
[52:43] Amen. Yet he was wounded for our
[52:45] transgression. Amen. Yet he was bruised
[52:48] for our iniquities. Amen. It's where you
[52:50] at. Amen. Long as you fall off, but you
[52:54] got to come on up here. Amen. Amen. And
[52:57] get
[52:58] down and start looking up. Amen. Amen.
[53:02] When I look to the heels. Amen. Amen.
[53:05] From which cometh to my heart.
[53:09] Yes, Jesus.
[53:11] Amen. I look to heaven.
[53:14] Amen. I'm looking up.
[53:17] Hallelujah. Amen. But in order for me to
[53:20] look up, I got to get down. To see what
[53:23] God has for me. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[53:27] But as long as I'm a far off, I can't
[53:29] see it. Amen. Amen. What God has in
[53:32] store for them to love him. Amen.
[53:35] It takes that the spirit of God. Amen.
[53:39] To see and understand the things of God.
[53:42] Amen. I wish somebody would just get
[53:44] come and be humble enough to get down.
[53:47] Oh yes. And look up and see God's glory.
[53:51] Amen. Hallelujah. Some people trying to
[53:54] understand God from a distance
[53:57] sometimes. Amen. They're trying to
[53:58] understand God through their reasoning.
[54:00] Amen. But you can't get you can't see
[54:03] him that way. Amen. Amen. You can't see
[54:05] him. It's only one way you're going to
[54:07] see God. That is by faith. Amen. You got
[54:11] to have faith. Amen. To believe that God
[54:14] is. Amen. And he's he's a rewarder of
[54:17] them that will seek him. Amen. You got
[54:21] to get in that place.
[54:24] Now I I I said that you
[54:28] know it's it's our
[54:32] mindset. It's not your outside beautiful
[54:36] beauty that makes you beautiful
[54:39] because you're just dirt.
[54:42] You're just dust.
[54:45] So I don't care how much you fix it
[54:48] up. Somebody can fall in love with it.
[54:52] But if the spirit go out of
[54:55] it, you're dead.
[54:58] Oh, I know. I Yeah, you know that the
[55:02] spirit goes out of it, you see how
[55:05] rotten you are. Amen. And then and if
[55:08] you're not careful, you'll find yourself
[55:11] stinking
[55:13] cuz I'll tell you the worst kind of
[55:16] smell you can smell is the the uh
[55:20] somebody to start to
[55:23] mortify. And I went to see somebody and
[55:27] I didn't know how to undertake. He said,
[55:28] "You don't want to go in here." And went
[55:30] to see my uncle. He says he's already
[55:33] start they in bonding but yet they
[55:36] didn't really do a good job. I said yeah
[55:41] I seen autopsies and all kind of stuff
[55:44] so I can I can stand
[55:47] it boy. I went in there and what I
[55:51] smelled went inside of me. It must have
[55:55] stayed with me look like
[55:59] months because even though I've seen
[56:02] autopsies and all of that, but I never
[56:05] saw I never smelled something that was
[56:10] so mortified.
[56:14] And uh you know you you can smell a dead
[56:17] dog when you're going by the highway or
[56:20] or a deer or something, but a human
[56:24] smell look like it's
[56:26] worse, you know?
[56:30] So I'm saying when you dead and you can
[56:34] get so rotten in your
[56:36] spirit, your spirit becomes so rotten
[56:40] and so stink. That's why he says sins
[56:44] stink in the nostrils of God.
[56:48] It smells, you know. So when when you
[56:54] when you a
[56:56] sinner, God, it it it has a smell to
[57:01] it. That's why the old people say, "You
[57:04] smelling what?" just
[57:10] I didn't want to say that in the pull
[57:11] pit, but y'all said it.
[57:15] But but by the grace of
[57:19] God, let me tell you, get to this point.
[57:23] I'm going to have to skip over here and
[57:24] go to Romans
[57:26] 12 because I want you to know because
[57:29] sometimes we're not conscious. We're not
[57:32] conscious. And I and it looked like it
[57:34] was magnified to me. Uh today
[57:38] uh you know we're not conscious because
[57:41] we are always I mean you can't tell the
[57:45] average young person that you know
[57:48] they about this body because they put on
[57:53] a a a couple hundred pair of tennis
[57:56] shoes or
[57:58] something. Lord have mercy. the tennis
[58:02] shoes, maybe put on a nice
[58:06] uh tuxeda suit and go to weeping and
[58:09] bopping.
[58:13] That's old timey talk. But
[58:18] but think they cool and all this and all
[58:22] that. But that ain't I mean that's just
[58:24] a all that
[58:28] drama on
[58:31] dust dirt.
[58:36] So when the body don't have the
[58:41] spirit, it's
[58:45] dirt. It ain't nothing it. And I don't
[58:49] care what you do to it to doctor it up
[58:52] and make it look all pretty and bomb it
[58:54] good, but it's still dirt.
[58:57] Are you with me? Amen. Cuz the life done
[59:00] gone out the
[59:03] body. And the life when it goes out of
[59:06] the body is
[59:09] dead. And I I I want you I want you to
[59:12] know that the life that I'm talking
[59:15] about is eternal life. Amen. Amen.
[59:20] A life that cannot die. Death don't have
[59:23] control over this life. Amen.
[59:28] If a man liveth and believeth in me, he
[59:31] shall never die. Amen. Amen. Not only
[59:35] that, I'm I'm going to take this
[59:38] corruptible body and I'm going to give
[59:40] him an incorruptible body.
[59:43] Are you with me? I'm going to I I don't
[59:46] need this corruptible. I'm going to put
[59:49] on incorruption. Amen. This was just a
[59:53] mere image, a shadow of what I was to
[59:56] be. Amen. And a shadow ain't the real
[1:00:00] thing. Amen. Are you a man? Amen.
[1:00:04] But your character,
[1:00:07] your
[1:00:08] character, the
[1:00:10] spirit that's being formed in you as a
[1:00:13] Christian is the spirit of the God
[1:00:17] Christ is being formed in you. Amen.
[1:00:23] And if Christ is being formed in you,
[1:00:26] Amen. you must be
[1:00:29] transformed.
[1:00:31] Cuz until you are
[1:00:34] transformed, it it all all all the
[1:00:37] Christian walk becomes
[1:00:39] law and it brings you into bondage
[1:00:43] because Amen. you are under the law
[1:00:46] because you're not under the life,
[1:00:49] eternal life. Amen.
[1:00:52] So when the church say you can't do this
[1:00:54] and you can't do that and don't do this
[1:00:56] or the word said it's all law to you
[1:01:00] because you cannot understand the things
[1:01:02] that be of God because you don't have
[1:01:04] the spirit of God and you're not subject
[1:01:07] to the things of the spirit amen of God.
[1:01:11] Amen. You won't subject yourself to the
[1:01:14] things of the spirit of God. You're not
[1:01:16] going to humble yourself. Amen. But when
[1:01:18] you have the spirit of God, it's easy.
[1:01:21] Amen.
[1:01:24] Not to do certain things. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:27] Amen. It's easy that you're not tempted
[1:01:30] to wear. Uh oh. A woman should not wear
[1:01:32] that retainer to a man. Oh, so she not
[1:01:34] supposed to put on pants. You're not
[1:01:36] tempted by that because why? You got
[1:01:38] another spirit in you. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:41] You want to do that which is right.
[1:01:43] Amen. Nobody has to preach to you, you
[1:01:46] can't do this or you can't do that. You
[1:01:48] don't want to do it. Why? Because you
[1:01:51] got a new nature. So you love doing the
[1:01:54] things of God, it's easier to do the
[1:01:56] things of God. But if your spirit is not
[1:01:59] right in the inside, Amen. Let me let me
[1:02:03] let me let me tell you
[1:02:05] something. You know, we think the Holy
[1:02:07] Spirit is just a thing or just a
[1:02:09] something. But I I it is the spirit of
[1:02:13] God that we are talking about that
[1:02:15] controls your mind. Amen.
[1:02:20] The way you think. Amen. Thank you,
[1:02:22] Jesus. He said, "Let this mind be in
[1:02:26] you. In you that was also in Christ."
[1:02:29] Also in Christ. Now, you know, you can
[1:02:33] be told, Amen. This is what we stand for
[1:02:36] as a bride of Jesus Christ, as a
[1:02:38] Christian. And I can tell you you you're
[1:02:41] not supposed to do this. You're not
[1:02:43] supposed to do that. You can't go here.
[1:02:45] You can't go there. But if you had the
[1:02:47] spirit of God in you, you wouldn't want
[1:02:49] to do this or that. And you wouldn't
[1:02:51] want to go there here and there. Amen.
[1:02:53] Amen. You wouldn't want to Amen. walk
[1:02:56] around naked. Amen. Amen. Little clothes
[1:02:58] on showing yourself. Amen. Amen. Like
[1:03:02] you want everybody to see old dead
[1:03:04] flesh. Amen. Amen.
[1:03:08] Rotten stuff.
[1:03:10] Amen. Praise God. When you trying to
[1:03:12] kill somebody with it.
[1:03:14] Amen. They cause spiritually death to
[1:03:16] hit somebody and look on on a woman and
[1:03:19] lust after her causing him to what?
[1:03:22] Commit what? Adultery. Isn't that right?
[1:03:26] So you trying to kill people?
[1:03:30] Are you with me? See, some people are
[1:03:32] death traps.
[1:03:34] They dead and they trying to kill
[1:03:36] everybody that can. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:03:40] Are you with me? Amen.
[1:03:42] So the Bible said in in Proverbs 7, I
[1:03:46] think he said her house is the way to
[1:03:48] hell going down into the chambers of
[1:03:50] death.
[1:03:52] Are you Are you with me? Amen. So So you
[1:03:56] want to go to her house?
[1:03:59] He said those that
[1:04:01] simple Amen. the supper man. He he he
[1:04:05] going to go the way of her house. She
[1:04:07] said he said in the twilight she caught
[1:04:11] him. She he found she found a man simple
[1:04:15] young man full void of understanding.
[1:04:18] Are you with me? Amen. But when you got
[1:04:20] when you got the Holy Ghost, praise God,

[1:05:39] So when you love the world, Amen. You're

[1:05:44] that are temporal and not the things
[1:05:46] that are eternal. Amen. Amen. Amen. But

[1:05:59] then you put on his divine nature.
[1:06:03] Amen. Amen. So you have a new nature.
[1:06:06] You were by nature the children of wrath
[1:06:09] and the children of disobedience. But

[1:06:14] his divine nature. Amen.
[1:06:17] Your appetite change when you Amen. when

[1:06:30] spoke in tongue, they felt something.
[1:06:32] But Amen. You got to be ordained to
[1:06:35] eternal life. Amen. Amen. You can have
[1:06:37] the Holy Ghost on your flesh, on your
[1:06:39] spirit, but down in the soul, you can be
[1:06:42] full of the devil. Amen.
[1:06:45] Amen. Are you with me? Amen. So you want
[1:06:48] the Holy Spirit of body, soul, and
[1:06:51] spirit. Lord, I want you to baptize me
[1:06:54] completely. Emerge me. Amen. I want my
[1:06:58] cup to run over. I want all of you,

[1:07:14] me. Amen.
[1:07:16] Praise God. Some people just give God a
[1:07:18] a portion. It's all right to have this
[1:07:21] much, this much, but I, you know, I
[1:07:23] ain't
[1:07:25] ignorant. I got to have common
[1:07:27] sense. Ain't nobody going to control
[1:07:31] me. No man, no church, nobody
[1:07:34] controlling me. So, I I I'm just going
[1:07:36] to do what I feel led to
[1:07:39] do. You don't need the Holy Ghost. just
[1:07:42] go on and do your
[1:07:43] thing because God ain't g He don't do
[1:07:46] that. He don't want all or nothing.
[1:07:50] True. Amen. You don't dictate to God.
[1:07:54] Are you with me? You don't tell God
[1:07:57] what? Uh-uh. All or nothing.
[1:08:01] Amen.
[1:08:04] And that's why people people do like
[1:08:06] they got they got to say so in the
[1:08:08] matter.
[1:08:10] Are you with me? Faith does not try to
[1:08:14] explain.
[1:08:16] Faith just what? Believes. Amen. When
[1:08:20] you have faith in God, you just believe
[1:08:22] what he's saying. Amen. Amen. We don't
[1:08:25] try to explain it. We don't try to
[1:08:28] reason with it. When you have faith in
[1:08:29] God, Amen. You just believe what he's
[1:08:32] saying. Amen. Amen. Lord, I believe it.
[1:08:35] Amen.
[1:08:36] And the body without the spirit is dead.
[1:08:39] And faith without what? Works is dead.
[1:08:41] Work works is dead. Amen. If you're not
[1:08:43] going to put your faith in action is
[1:08:45] dead. Amen. Are you with me? Let me go
[1:08:49] and read this verse and I better quit.
[1:08:52] But uh before I quit, I want this you to
[1:08:55] understand this one point. It says, "I
[1:08:58] beseech you therefore, brethren, by the
[1:09:01] mercies of God that you present what?
[1:09:03] Your bodies.
[1:09:06] Now this you see here this the dirt this
[1:09:09] body your body is a living sacrifice
[1:09:13] because this is what got people all you
[1:09:16] know you got all kind of racial tensions
[1:09:19] and all one black one right all that
[1:09:23] kind of stuff
[1:09:25] man some folks need to be repainted or
[1:09:28] something get away all that prejudice
[1:09:31] out of their heart just Lord just make
[1:09:34] me over or
[1:09:36] something. You know, it's something
[1:09:38] about people get stuck on things that
[1:09:41] don't even matter.
[1:09:43] Are you a man? Amen. The important thing
[1:09:46] is your soul. Amen. And where your soul
[1:09:49] is going to spend eternity. Amen. Where
[1:09:52] you going to get right with God? So you
[1:09:54] present your body as a living sacrifice.
[1:09:57] What are you
[1:09:58] sacrificing? I said that the other
[1:10:00] Sunday. What are you
[1:10:02] sacrificing? Are you just doing what you
[1:10:04] want to do, going where you want to go,
[1:10:08] living like you want to live, or you
[1:10:12] present your bodies as a living
[1:10:14] sacrifice?
[1:10:17] That's why, you know, let me stay with
[1:10:20] these pants for for
[1:10:23] females. That's a sacrifice in this
[1:10:25] world where everybody's wearing
[1:10:27] it. Everybody's all made up.
[1:10:31] We got a earring in the nose, earring in
[1:10:34] the lips, earring I mean uh piercing
[1:10:37] this and tattooing that and all of that.
[1:10:40] Everything God tell you not to do, they
[1:10:41] doing it.
[1:10:44] So here it says that you might
[1:10:49] prove the sacrifice holy and accept
[1:10:52] holy. Nobody want to be holy no more.
[1:10:54] That's what brother Nathan told me the
[1:10:56] other other night, other day. He says,
[1:10:58] "Brother 7, you know something? Nobody
[1:11:01] want people don't want to be holy no
[1:11:02] more. Matter of fact, they done lost the
[1:11:04] meaning of holiness.
[1:11:07] Back in the old back anytime a person
[1:11:09] was go into a holiness church, a
[1:11:11] sanctified church, anywhere you you you
[1:11:14] call people Holy Ghost
[1:11:17] fil the women, no makeup, no earrings,
[1:11:22] no no cutting their hair, all of that
[1:11:25] stuff. when they were holy, everybody,
[1:11:28] church of God, church of God in Christ,
[1:11:31] uh,
[1:11:32] sanctified church, uh, uh, Pentecostal
[1:11:35] church, anybody that was holy, all the,
[1:11:38] everybody, white, black, no matter who
[1:11:40] you was, Spanish, whatever, everybody
[1:11:44] look alike, you can tell that's a
[1:11:47] sanctified person there. Right. right
[1:11:50] off. But
[1:11:53] now
[1:11:56] holiness, well, I wonder why those
[1:11:58] people were holy back then and the
[1:12:00] holiness is taking on another meaning
[1:12:02] now.
[1:12:04] Are you with me? Amen. Holiness has
[1:12:06] taken on another grandmama holy and all
[1:12:09] those folk was holy and it took on
[1:12:12] another meaning when the other 2000 came
[1:12:14] in look like they just forgot about what
[1:12:16] holiness is was. They got another
[1:12:19] definition. We're supposed to be
[1:12:21] sanctified. We supposed to be separated
[1:12:23] from the world and the things of the
[1:12:25] world. Amen. We supposed to look
[1:12:26] different, talk different, live
[1:12:27] different. Amen. Amen. Holiness. Amen.
[1:12:34] Is a price. We want to be identified.
[1:12:37] Bless.
[1:12:39] We want to be identified with the rest
[1:12:41] of the world. Holy and acceptable to
[1:12:43] God, which is your what? reasonable
[1:12:45] service and be not what this world
[1:12:49] conformed to this world. Don't don't
[1:12:50] don't you conform yourself after this
[1:12:53] world. Amen. But be you what?
[1:12:56] Transformed by the what? Renewing of
[1:12:59] your mind. That's what I want to to
[1:13:01] close out in.
[1:13:04] Your mindset,
[1:13:07] how you think. Amen. Amen.
[1:13:11] See, you can't have the mind of Christ
[1:13:13] without the spirit of Christ. Yes.
[1:13:16] You can't even think like Christ without
[1:13:18] his spirit. Amen. So, you're going to
[1:13:21] think like a dead person,
[1:13:24] dead in trespassing, sin. You're going
[1:13:27] to think like an enemy of God, somebody
[1:13:29] that is against God. You can't help
[1:13:32] yourself. Amen. Things that you want to
[1:13:34] do, it's going to be the things that the
[1:13:37] world dictates. Amen. the prince and the
[1:13:40] power of the air. It's going to be what
[1:13:43] the devil said
[1:13:45] do. You going to say, "Well, uh, I I
[1:13:49] just No. No. He said, uh-uh, don't tell
[1:13:52] me that the God will lead you to do
[1:13:54] something contrary to the word." Amen.
[1:13:57] Amen. So, the people have trouble and I
[1:13:59] know they have trouble and and that's
[1:14:01] why I don't understand because people,
[1:14:04] Amen. can't take no pressure. Now we
[1:14:07] living in a a a in a world where just a
[1:14:11] little bit pressure cause oppression
[1:14:14] almost to lose their mind.
[1:14:17] Are you with me? So I I I I wish would
[1:14:22] to God that people just get the Holy
[1:14:25] Spirit and let the spirit of God take
[1:14:28] over and they have the mind of Christ to
[1:14:30] want to do the things of Christ. Amen.
[1:14:33] Amen. Because this body without the
[1:14:35] spirit is dead. So the
[1:14:41] mind it it hits me so
[1:14:44] hard in my
[1:14:47] spirit. I mean it just like something
[1:14:49] came in the room and said here here it
[1:14:53] is. Said here it
[1:14:56] is. I
[1:14:58] said it's a presence that came in the
[1:15:01] room. It say here it
[1:15:03] is. I said oh God what is
[1:15:07] this said? Tap into
[1:15:11] this. Tap into
[1:15:14] it. I said this is
[1:15:18] dead. It's the way that people
[1:15:22] think. The way you
[1:15:25] think. That's why you do the things you
[1:15:27] do. Amen. Amen. The control tower. Who's
[1:15:31] running? Who's running the ship? Amen.
[1:15:35] Who's running? Who Who's in control of
[1:15:37] your life? Amen. Why you think like you
[1:15:40] think? Amen.
[1:15:45] Why you do like you do? Because it's the
[1:15:48] spirit. Amen. Amen.
[1:15:52] Then I could see something come
[1:15:55] in. This is there's anointing.
[1:16:00] said that's why people not
[1:16:03] heal. That's why people not
[1:16:06] delivering
[1:16:08] because they got to let you have
[1:16:12] control. Their mind is so twisted. Amen.
[1:16:16] Amen. But they got to surrender their
[1:16:18] mind. Amen. Surrender themselves to God.
[1:16:22] Amen. And let God be in control of their
[1:16:25] thinking.
[1:16:26] Yes. Amen. That's right. Amen. Be

[1:16:32] Mind.
[1:16:35] Transformed by the renewing of your
[1:16:38] mind. Amen. Amen.

[1:16:46] your life. Amen. Amen. Amen. You're
[1:16:50] going to think different. You're going

[1:17:09] let God have my mind. Amen. Amen. Yes,
[1:17:13] Lord.

[1:17:23] against God. Amen. As long as

[1:17:39] spirit and it's the nature of the enemy.
[1:17:42] It's the devil that's controlling you.

[1:24:02] Sometimes we we only
[1:24:05] love when it's concerning somebody that
[1:24:08] we love. How about your enemy? Can you
[1:24:11] have that same loving kindness with
[1:24:12] them? Somebody that you don't even
[1:24:15] know. Can you have that same compassion?
[1:24:18] God bless you. I just This is talk this
[1:24:22] morning, but I trust that something said
[1:24:24] that help us. Amen. Because the greatest
[1:24:29] thing I saw healing, I saw miracles when
[1:24:33] I
[1:24:36] saw the mind. Amen. You don't love with
[1:24:41] your
[1:24:42] body. I don't care how good your body.
[1:24:45] You don't love with your
[1:24:47] body. I don't care how beautiful your So
[1:24:50] don't use going out. You don't love with
[1:24:52] your
[1:24:54] body. You love with your what?
[1:24:57] Spirit, your
[1:25:00] mind. Are you with me? Amen.
[1:25:04] Cuz your body is just laying there dead.
[1:25:07] So you don't fall in love with a body
[1:25:09] because you don't love with the body.
[1:25:11] That's why it's very important that you
[1:25:13] have character. Amen. Are you with me?
[1:25:16] Because you don't think with your body.
[1:25:21] Are you with me? Amen. Your
[1:25:24] thinking in your mind. Are you with me?
[1:25:28] Your body is
[1:25:31] just it's just a house that you your
[1:25:34] spirit dwell in it.
[1:25:37] Your soul is in the body. Are you with
[1:25:40] me? But the body itself is just a
[1:25:44] vessel.
[1:25:45] Are you with me? So think on that. The
[1:25:49] body that you spend all the money on and
[1:25:53] dress it all
[1:25:56] up. It's not you dress. It's the spirit
[1:26:00] that you entertaining. That's why you're
[1:26:03] doing these things. Amen. It's the
[1:26:06] spirit that you're entertaining. Some
[1:26:08] spirit are driving you to do certain
[1:26:10] things and you got to see where it's
[1:26:12] coming from. Amen. Where's the spirit
[1:26:15] coming from? Beneath or from above?
[1:26:18] Amen. Amen. Where is it coming from?
[1:26:21] Amen. I got I got to check out my spirit
[1:26:24] because this body here, it said it has a
[1:26:27] need. I have a need. I have a need of a
[1:26:29] wife. I have a need of a husband. I have
[1:26:31] a need of this. But actually, the body
[1:26:33] don't need it.
[1:26:36] It's the spirit in you
[1:26:40] that is saying I
[1:26:42] need. Are you with me?
[1:26:45] But you got to listen closely to the
[1:26:49] spirit and see whether it's coming from
[1:26:53] God or it's coming from
[1:26:57] beneath. Are you with me? Amen.
[1:27:00] So
[1:27:02] friends, brothers and
[1:27:05] sisters, young people,
[1:27:09] remember the body without the spirit
[1:27:12] is
[1:27:13] dead. God bless
[1:27:16] you. Thank you. Let us
[1:27:18] [Music]
[1:27:20] stand. Don't let the devil fool you that
[1:27:22] the body is so beautiful, so this and
[1:27:25] that.
[1:27:29] That's a spirit that gets on
[1:27:32] you that puts emphasis on the flesh and
[1:27:36] not on the spirit
[1:27:38] man. Have you thinking about beneath and
[1:27:42] not above
[1:27:46] [Music]
[1:27:51] let God lead
[1:27:52] you. Father, in the precious name of
[1:27:55] Jesus Christ,
[1:27:57] I thank you, Lord.
[1:27:59] [Music]
[1:28:02] Lord, I hope that it makes sense this
[1:28:04] morning.
[1:28:08] I hope you can. I trust you can get our
[1:28:10] thinking right.
[1:28:13] [Music]
[1:28:15] That we can think like you would have us
[1:28:18] to think.
[1:28:20] [Music]
[1:28:22] that the spirit that controls us might
[1:28:24] be the Holy Spirit. Yes. And not our
[1:28:28] own.
[1:28:32] Father, I just pray that
[1:28:34] you we want to come closer to you,
[1:28:37] Lord, and we want to look up where we
[1:28:40] can see your true image and your
[1:28:43] likeness that we want to be like you,
[1:28:46] Lord.
[1:28:50] As our heads are bowed, hearts are
[1:28:51] looking to
[1:28:52] him. I wonder this
[1:28:55] morning, there's something
[1:28:59] said, have you given Jesus Christ your
[1:29:05] heart? He's given
[1:29:07] you, he's permitted you to
[1:29:10] live. He's permitted you to have health
[1:29:13] and strength.
[1:29:18] But would you give back to him what he's
[1:29:21] given to you, your
[1:29:24] heart, your
[1:29:26] life, and let him give you a new life, a
[1:29:30] new
[1:29:31] life. As our heads are bowed, hearts are
[1:29:34] looking to him. Is there one this
[1:29:36] morning that would say, "Jesus, come
[1:29:38] into my
[1:29:40] heart." Brother Simmons, pray for me.
[1:29:43] Thank you. Thank you. I want Jesus to
[1:29:47] come into my life. Thank you. Thank
[1:29:49] [Music]
[1:29:52] you. Father in Jesus
[1:29:56] name. Thank you for these hands,
[1:29:59] hearts. Lord, may you, oh God, make your
[1:30:03] board. For you said, if any man be in
[1:30:06] Christ, he's a new
[1:30:08] creature. Old things have passed away,
[1:30:10] behold, all things become new.
[1:30:14] Lord, may you come and make your
[1:30:16] board. Change the way we think. Change
[1:30:20] the way we
[1:30:21] live. Lord, I want you to be in control
[1:30:24] of my
[1:30:25] life. I don't want to try to live this
[1:30:29] life without
[1:30:31] you. I want you to to come, Lord, and
[1:30:35] send your
[1:30:37] anointing. Let your spirit dwell,
[1:30:40] Lord. Forgive us, Lord.
[1:30:44] and Lord have
[1:30:46] control in Jesus Christ's name I yield.
[1:30:52] [Music]
[1:30:57] Amen. What about
[1:30:59] you? It's time to
[1:31:02] go.
[1:31:04] [Music]
[1:31:06] But
[1:31:07] [Music]
[1:31:10] remember, you can't think
[1:31:12] [Music]
[1:31:14] right. And you won't ever think right
[1:31:17] until you get the Holy
[1:31:21] Ghost. That is the mind of
[1:31:25] Christ. And you want that more than
[1:31:28] anything.
[1:31:32] As we get depart this place
[1:31:35] today, let's just lift our hands to the
[1:31:39] Lord. May the Lord watch between me and
[1:31:41] thee while we absent one from the other.
[1:31:44] Let us all say amen. Amen. God bless
[1:31:49] [Music]
[1:31:56] you. Heat. Heat.
[1:32:10] [Music]
