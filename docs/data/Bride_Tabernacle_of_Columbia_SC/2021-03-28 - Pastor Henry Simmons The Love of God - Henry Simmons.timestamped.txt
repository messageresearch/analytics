[41:27] some would even dare to die but god
[41:30] commanded his love towards us
[41:34] and that while we were yet sentenced
[41:36] christ died for us
[41:38] much more than been now
[41:41] justified by his blood we shall be saved
[41:45] from wrath through him
[41:46] for if when we were enemies we were
[41:50] reconciled to god
[41:52] by the death of his son much more being
[41:55] reconciled
[41:56] we shall be saved by his life
[42:00] may god bless you reading towards you
[42:01] may be seated
[42:07] the great creator became
[42:11] [Music]
[42:13] our savior amen ohio
[42:22] down from his glory
[42:28] heavily story
[42:35] my god and savior came
[42:40] and jesus was
[42:44] his name mourning
[42:48] a manger
[42:53] to his own a stranger
[42:59] a man a sorrow tears in
[43:06] agony
[43:11] oh how i love
[43:15] him i
[43:19] adore him
[43:23] my my sunshine
[43:30] my all in all
[43:36] the grey cream
[43:43] became my savior
[43:49] and all god's goodness
[43:55] [Music]
[44:01] oh how i love him
[44:12] [Music]
[44:20] my all in all
[44:26] the great creator
[44:34] became my savior
[44:39] and all god's glory
[44:52] and all gospel
[44:57] next dwelleth
[45:00] in him
[45:06] without reluctance flesh and blood his
[45:09] substance
[45:11] amen praise god i'm glad he came
[45:16] this morning as i look
[45:19] at romans 5 and
[45:23] for a good while i was just
[45:28] thinking on the love of god and
[45:32] and what it means to mean
[45:35] what it should mean to each and every
[45:37] one of us
[45:39] the love of god you know i can but talk
[45:43] to you a little bit about the love of
[45:44] god this morning
[45:48] it says
[45:53] falling in love with jesus
[45:56] is the best thing that ever happened
[46:00] to me
[46:04] you know sometimes the bible said
[46:07] whosoever find that the wife find it the
[46:09] good thing
[46:13] there's something about when the
[46:15] individuals think
[46:18] that they're in love
[46:22] and when they are in love
[46:26] it means an awful lot to them
[46:31] and i i thought about the love of god
[46:35] and what love is all about
[46:38] the bible says in saint john
[46:42] 3 16 god so loved the world that he gave
[46:49] and i thought about love he gave his
[46:51] only begotten son
[46:53] whichever believe in him should not
[46:54] perish you have everlasting life
[46:58] when we think about love we think about
[47:00] giving
[47:03] we cannot use the word love
[47:08] because love is something that we have
[47:10] to express
[47:11] [Music]
[47:13] love is something that is manifest
[47:17] something that is made known something
[47:18] that is revealed
[47:21] so love the love of god
[47:25] here it says in romans 5 therefore being
[47:28] justified by faith
[47:32] we have peace with god through our lord
[47:34] jesus christ
[47:38] without the love of god there's no peace
[47:40] with god
[47:44] but we have peace with god through our
[47:46] lord jesus christ thank god for brother
[47:48] branham
[47:49] bye from trinity died
[47:52] we have peace with god through our lord
[47:54] jesus christ
[47:57] he said by whom also we have access by
[47:59] faith into disgrace
[48:01] wherein we stand
[48:06] and we rejoice in the hope of the glory
[48:08] of god
[48:09] [Music]
[48:11] you know those are the outstanding
[48:12] statements that paul
[48:14] was writing and mean it means so much to
[48:17] us
[48:18] it's by the grace of god we stand
[48:22] we could not stand without his grace
[48:27] and he's talking about we rejoice in
[48:30] this faith that god has given us for
[48:34] what god has done for us
[48:36] amen it causes us to rejoice
[48:41] because not only rejoicing in what he's
[48:44] done for us
[48:45] he said also the hope of the glory of
[48:48] god
[48:49] [Music]
[48:52] amen god got more that he's going to
[48:55] express
[48:56] unto us and and more that he's got in
[48:59] store for us
[49:02] are you with me so god love is so
[49:05] amazing
[49:05] it's beyond our comprehension
[49:09] but nevertheless he lets us experience
[49:13] his love here on the earth
[49:17] and sometimes people want love from
[49:21] family members love for mama love from
[49:23] daddy love from
[49:25] siblings or whatever people are seeking
[49:27] love
[49:28] in many ways and people are
[49:32] looking for love in the wrong places
[49:37] but we're talking we're not just talking
[49:39] about feeling your love and errors or
[49:42] lust type love we're talking about the
[49:44] love of god
[49:48] when we speak of the love of god the
[49:50] english word is not sufficient so it
[49:52] talks about the greek word
[49:54] of agape love god's love
[49:58] so man does not have that love just
[50:02] god to love jesus is the love of god
[50:05] expressed so in order to have
[50:09] a god pay love we're going to go
[50:12] go down a little bit a bit farther he
[50:14] says in the third verse
[50:16] and not only so but we glory in what
[50:22] what causes us the glory and the things
[50:23] that we're going through
[50:28] we're glory in tribulation
[50:32] i i i'm talking about sometimes when
[50:35] we're going through
[50:36] look like the worst of the worst
[50:39] things that are seem to be unbearable
[50:45] but we glory in tribulation
[50:49] because we have something that gives us
[50:51] the ability
[50:53] even though we're going through to glory
[50:59] so we have something that excels our
[51:01] tribulation
[51:03] something that amen causes our
[51:05] tribulation
[51:06] to seemed to be a light thing
[51:11] a thing that cannot overtake us
[51:14] or overcome us it gives us the power to
[51:18] defeat our tribulation
[51:20] to conquer our tribulation
[51:24] to defeat our tribulation
[51:30] so we glory in tribulation also knowing
[51:32] that tribulation working
[51:36] so god allows revelation to works
[51:38] patience
[51:41] and patience he says experience
[51:44] and experience hope amen and hope makers
[51:49] is not ashamed
[51:54] because what the fifth verse because
[51:58] what
[51:59] because the love of god is what
[52:04] the love of god is shedded about now how
[52:06] is it
[52:07] shattered abroad in our heart how do we
[52:09] know that we have the love of god
[52:11] and how is the love of god how do we get
[52:13] the love of god
[52:14] because he said it shut it abroad in our
[52:16] hearts by what
[52:19] so a god paid love but god's love is
[52:22] shedded abroad in our hearts
[52:24] by the holy ghost okay so first of all
[52:27] therefore being justified by faith
[52:29] faith in what faith in what
[52:32] god has done for us so we'll as as we
[52:35] look
[52:36] farther in these verses we'll find that
[52:38] god has
[52:39] done something for us
[52:43] and when he's done something for us and
[52:46] we'll reset
[52:47] and we receive what he's done for us
[52:51] amen then we become amen
[52:54] uh we began to receive
[52:58] his love inside of us
[53:01] amen then the love of god can be
[53:04] expressed
[53:05] not only in jesus christ but god's love
[53:08] can be expressed in our lives
[53:12] so god amen not only express his love
[53:16] towards us
[53:17] through jesus christ but god wants to
[53:19] express his love in our lives
[53:22] he wants you to amen know how it feels
[53:26] to
[53:27] aim aiming to have god's love
[53:30] he wants to know that amen you
[53:34] you can have peace and you can be
[53:37] justified
[53:40] amen and have peace with god
[53:44] he says because the holy ghost is
[53:47] shedded abroad in our hearts
[53:50] because the love of god is shedding
[53:51] wrought in our hearts by the holy ghost
[53:52] which has given us
[53:54] for when we were yet without what
[53:57] without strength in due
[54:01] time christ died for
[54:06] see the thing is
[54:09] falling in love with jesus is to
[54:11] understand
[54:14] praise god it's an understanding we
[54:16] could fall in love with a lot of things
[54:20] the bible said love not the world
[54:24] these are the things that are of the
[54:26] world
[54:31] for their experience in progress says
[54:34] there are many women out there
[54:38] and there are three women that you
[54:39] should not fall in love with
[54:45] and that's one of the women
[54:48] is miss lust of the flesh
[54:53] the lust of the eye and the pride of the
[54:57] life
[54:59] don't fall in love with those women
[55:02] are you with me see you can fall
[55:06] in love with those women amen
[55:09] but the bible said love not the world
[55:12] neither the things of the world
[55:13] for all that is in the world the lust of
[55:15] the flesh
[55:18] lust of the eyes and what these things
[55:21] are not of the father but of the world
[55:24] and all of that'll pass away amen
[55:28] but god's love will not pass away
[55:31] again pay love but see we fall in love
[55:33] with the wrong
[55:35] one we fall in the love with miss
[55:39] lust of the flesh
[55:42] amen lust of the eye and the pride of
[55:45] life
[55:46] so don't fall in love with these ladies
[55:51] all you really mean because these ladies
[55:54] the bible says her house is the way to
[55:56] hell going down
[55:57] into the chambers of death that's what
[55:59] proverbs 7 says
[56:02] amen don't go in to her house
[56:05] because you're going into a place of
[56:07] death
[56:09] amen don't love the world
[56:14] okay the bible said whosoever find us
[56:18] the wife founded a good thing
[56:20] amen don't fall in love with these
[56:22] strange women
[56:24] amen proverbs 5. you got to watch these
[56:27] strange women
[56:32] miss lust of the flesh
[56:35] the eyes and the pride of life don't
[56:36] fall in love with those women
[56:40] okay let's go on a little further
[56:44] christ died for us when we were ungodly
[56:48] i mean i don't know about you but i know
[56:51] i was ungodly
[56:52] [Music]
[56:55] but god that didn't stop look god for
[56:57] loving me
[56:58] [Music]
[57:01] in spite of how you lived and how you
[57:03] conducted your life
[57:05] god still loves you
[57:09] amen you can look back at your life and
[57:11] you say
[57:12] why did god choose me why did god choose
[57:14] to love me
[57:16] see because there are many that don't
[57:18] set in the house of god
[57:20] there are many that are not tuning in to
[57:22] listen amen to the word of god but
[57:24] somehow god has gotten your attention
[57:27] enough that you said i love you lord
[57:30] i love you enough to tune in i love you
[57:32] enough to come to church
[57:35] and god he sees your love
[57:38] he sees your love by your action
[57:42] and god knows that there's something
[57:43] inside of you to disarm
[57:45] something
[57:49] and and god wants to meet that desire
[57:52] of your heart
[57:55] because god you know it's something
[57:57] about god can look deeper
[57:59] amen then all of the devil tries to give
[58:02] you all kind of excuses
[58:04] why you ought not to love the lord
[58:08] i i want to give you some uh
[58:11] some reasons why you should love him
[58:15] why you shouldn't love him and why amen
[58:18] it's not a force or something that god
[58:21] is going to force on you
[58:22] but but because you can see his love
[58:25] towards you
[58:26] it's something you know this love is for
[58:29] me this is what i needed all my life
[58:32] i needed this kind of love mother
[58:35] couldn't give it father couldn't give it
[58:37] amen friends wife and husband can't give
[58:41] me this kind of love but i needed this
[58:43] love
[58:45] amen this kind of love amen
[58:49] and i i i i i'm of the persuasion
[58:54] that as many people that have come to
[58:57] church for year in and year out
[58:59] that went through all emotions of
[59:01] everything that they
[59:02] knew to do that was supposedly
[59:05] godly in a sense they have accepted
[59:08] jesus in their life
[59:10] but they have not gone deep enough to
[59:12] understand
[59:13] what god's love mean to them
[59:18] and and and and that's what i'm saying
[59:20] to
[59:21] it it can become a somewhat a tradition
[59:24] somewhat form and
[59:26] fashion amen but to know the love of god
[59:30] amen and that's what i i i want you to
[59:34] understand
[59:35] amen that if you fall in love with jesus
[59:39] then it's the best thing that could
[59:42] it's the best thing that could ever
[59:44] happen to you
[59:46] amen it's the best thing that they
[59:50] you say well you know when i find my
[59:51] wife that's the best thing to happen to
[59:53] me
[59:53] i find my husband was the best thing
[59:55] that ever happened to me
[59:57] even my children was the best thing that
[59:59] ever happened to me
[1:00:00] amen my job is you know some folk they
[1:00:03] mean
[1:00:04] they they thank god for their job
[1:00:07] and they would give more honor to their
[1:00:09] job than they would give to god's word
[1:00:13] amen i mean jesus seemed to be
[1:00:17] secondary they're more happy for
[1:00:21] the money that they got the house that
[1:00:23] they live in the car
[1:00:24] that they drive they give more honor to
[1:00:26] that than they give to the lord
[1:00:29] but we understand all this all this
[1:00:32] carnal stuff will pass away
[1:00:35] amen i mean you can lose all of that but
[1:00:38] don't you lose jesus
[1:00:42] all of that can you you can lose but
[1:00:44] don't lose jesus
[1:00:46] amen the love of god i believe
[1:00:50] we'll hold true we'll do everything we
[1:00:53] can do
[1:00:53] to try to hold on to the natural things
[1:00:55] that we got
[1:00:57] even if it means giving up coming to
[1:00:59] church eating
[1:01:00] or giving up your faithfulness to god i
[1:01:03] i got to make my ends meet i got to do
[1:01:06] this i got to do
[1:01:07] how about serving the lord how about
[1:01:09] putting him first
[1:01:12] amen does he means that much to you
[1:01:17] somebody said my husband won't let me
[1:01:19] amen come to church my wife won't let me
[1:01:22] amen serve the law amen
[1:01:25] if that means more but once you come in
[1:01:27] contact with a god pay love
[1:01:30] amen you let nothing separate you
[1:01:33] from the love of god amen
[1:01:37] when you come but you must have you you
[1:01:39] must have that
[1:01:41] experience in your life
[1:01:44] if you do not have that experience of
[1:01:47] god's
[1:01:47] love then something will come by
[1:01:51] and separate you come on somebody
[1:01:55] you know how folks get involved
[1:01:57] marriages and

[1:27:28] acting all strange are you what man
[1:27:32] you know if that happens in the natural
[1:27:34] cause then that's strength

[1:28:32] praise god happy smiling when you ought
[1:28:35] to be sad
[1:28:36] because it's something that's happening
[1:28:40] i i got to say this and then i got to
[1:28:43] close
[1:28:44] there's one verse i wanted to get to but
[1:28:46] i won't be able to get down
[1:28:48] but first john you can read the whole
[1:28:51] book
[1:28:52] the first john to really get some of
[1:28:54] those points that i would like to
[1:28:56] express
[1:28:57] but here it says to know the love of god
[1:29:00] that can pass us the 19th verse
[1:29:04] that you may be able to comprehend in
[1:29:05] 18th verse
[1:29:08] the breadth and length and depth and
[1:29:10] height the 19th verse to know the love
[1:29:12] of christ
[1:29:13] which passes knowledge that you may be
[1:29:17] filled with all the fullness of god
[1:29:21] see once you're filled with the love of
[1:29:23] god the fullness of god
[1:29:26] then what happens when you're filled
[1:29:28] with the fullness of god
[1:29:31] see what happens he said here now to him
[1:29:34] that
[1:29:36] is able to do what
[1:29:42] let's see what happens why we don't get
[1:29:45] to exceeding abundantly
[1:29:47] because we're not rooted in groundness
[1:29:50] but if you want to exceed it and
[1:29:52] abundantly
[1:29:54] if you want that if you want the
[1:29:57] exceeding and abundantly
[1:29:59] then you got to fall in love
[1:30:02] fall in love with jesus falling in love
[1:30:05] with jesus is the what
[1:30:08] the best thing that ever happened and
[1:30:11] that's the best thing that
[1:30:12] could ever happen to you in your life
[1:30:15] that you
[1:30:15] fall in love with jesus
[1:30:18] see something about it really uh taking
[1:30:22] uh
[1:30:22] uh uh a root in your life
[1:30:25] that this this is jesus god
[1:30:28] it's real this love that
[1:30:32] when i accept it and i received jesus
[1:30:34] into my life
[1:30:36] this this it really took an effect on me
[1:30:39] praise god i don't care you you know you
[1:30:42] say
[1:30:42] i wasn't going to tell nobody but i
[1:30:47] you didn't i mean you couldn't because
[1:30:49] it they began to shine you begin to glow
[1:30:52] you begin to stop doing stuff and you
[1:30:55] just i just stopped no you didn't stop
[1:30:57] the love of god praise god just
[1:31:01] it took it away i remember
