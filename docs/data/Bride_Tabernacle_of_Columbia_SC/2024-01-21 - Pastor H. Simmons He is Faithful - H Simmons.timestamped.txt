[45:07] what love and to what and good works
[45:11] then he says not forsaking to assemble
[45:13] ourselves to what together as the man of
[45:17] su is but exalting one another so much
[45:22] the more as you see the what approach
[45:27] the day
[45:29] approaching amen I believe I was
[45:33] thinking on the day of
[45:37] judgment and it just makes you made me
[45:41] just just how how would it be in the day
[45:45] of
[45:47] judgment when you got to stand before a
[45:49] judge I don't know how many of you in
[45:51] here ever stood before a
[45:54] judge uh uh maybe a traffic ticket maybe
[45:59] something that you went through uh and
[46:02] you had to stand before the judge how
[46:04] many you ever experienced standing
[46:06] before a
[46:08] judge okay and you stand before the
[46:12] judge I don't know how you felt but I
[46:15] was even when I was in the
[46:17] right just being there I remember as a
[46:21] little boy I went through a little
[46:22] incident and my mom you know she had
[46:28] the issue or Whata call them because
[46:32] somebody had mishandled me or whatever I
[46:35] just a little
[46:37] child and the judge is speaking and I
[46:40] was
[46:42] nervous just standing there before the
[46:46] judge and uh goes they found the man and
[46:49] sentencing him and all but just to stand
[46:53] before a
[46:54] judge uh in makes you feel a
[46:57] little you know even when you're in the
[46:59] right standing before a judge it's just
[47:02] that it it's kind
[47:04] of I I I kind of felt a little
[47:08] sensitive you know some people get stand
[47:11] before a judge and just I don't know but
[47:15] even when the judge come out he ask they
[47:17] ask everybody to what stand in other
[47:21] words you give
[47:23] honor for that judge
[47:26] amen
[47:28] so he said that that day is
[47:32] approaching it's going to become a time
[47:36] where you and
[47:38] I the Bible says is appointed to man
[47:41] wants to die but after that is the what
[47:45] judgment as you think about Judgment Day
[47:48] is
[47:52] coming Judgment Day is coming
[47:56] and I was thinking about that this
[47:58] morning as I was praying Judgment Day is
[48:02] coming and every time I think about that
[48:05] we got to give account for the things
[48:07] that we
[48:09] do when I even think about that even
[48:13] though we try to live a Godly life and a
[48:17] life that we think that God would be
[48:20] pleased with even in that it
[48:24] is it makes you understand that one day
[48:28] you going to have to stand before
[48:32] God and when you stand before
[48:36] God I I want to you know some of us I
[48:39] ain't afraid I ain't nervous I stand
[48:42] there and tell him how good I've
[48:45] been and how righteous I've been how
[48:48] holy I've been I I want to stand the
[48:51] Bible say judgment begins
[48:54] where in the house of God and he said if
[48:58] it first began at us where should a
[49:01] sinner in the ungodly
[49:03] appear are you with me so here we are
[49:09] amen God is Faith he is faithful that
[49:14] promise you and I got to appear before a
[49:18] a a just
[49:22] God and when you know that God is
[49:27] just and I I was in Genesis it say uh
[49:32] surely the god of the whole earth will
[49:34] do
[49:36] right God going to do
[49:39] right somebody say somebody did me wrong
[49:42] and the judge that many folks are in
[49:45] prison or many folks have went to the uh
[49:48] the the electric chair and died because
[49:51] and they were in the
[49:52] right I'm going to tell you God Don't
[49:55] Make No mist
[49:57] mistakes and he'll he'll judge righteous
[50:01] judgment are you with me but I I when
[50:05] you appear before God uh I want to know
[50:09] how will you appear before him it
[50:12] doesn't matter how all the the the stuff
[50:15] folks do and say and all the uh
[50:23] must I'm trying to say a word that I
[50:25] can't hardly
[50:27] pronounce so massage or whatever you
[50:30] know all of
[50:34] this
[50:36] huh all of
[50:39] this stuff people try to make it so
[50:42] glamorous
[50:44] and make it appear that everything is
[50:47] fine when you appear before God all of
[50:50] that stuff fake stuff ain't going to
[50:52] work all of the make believe world that
[50:55] we live in and try to make ourselves
[50:58] righteous and try to make ourselves holy
[51:01] and and try to justify our wrong when we
[51:04] know in our heart the Bible said the
[51:07] heart knows its own
[51:08] wickedness when we know ourselves to be
[51:12] amen that we are not doing or living
[51:15] what we supposed to live and doing what
[51:18] we know to do it
[51:22] right you know all of that stuff ain't
[51:25] going
[51:26] work God is faithful he's faithful that
[51:31] promise it doesn't matter how
[51:33] comfortable we might try to make
[51:36] ourselves
[51:38] feel because it doesn't matter how
[51:41] secure we can you know you know try to
[51:44] make believe that ah God going to
[51:49] accept when I appear before God I'm
[51:53] going to say I'm all right
[51:57] when I appear before God I know God
[52:00] going to say look at my child well done
[52:05] good and faithful servant come on in
[52:07] into the joy of the
[52:09] Lord but it's going to be a a time when
[52:14] you and I got to come and face
[52:18] reality we got to come to the point with
[52:21] God that we're going to face reality and
[52:24] we're going to actually amen stand
[52:27] before him and he going to give our just
[52:32] reward I will just reward just as a man
[52:37] soul that shall he
[52:40] reath it won't be any way out of it we
[52:45] can't talk our way out of
[52:49] it you can't lie about
[52:52] it you're going to stand before a just
[52:58] God let me try to go back here in
[53:02] Hebrews
[53:07] here in 26 verse 10 if we sin willfully
[53:12] after that we have received the
[53:13] knowledge of the truth there remaineth
[53:17] what but as certain
[53:20] fearful the Bible says it's a fearful
[53:23] thing to fall into the hands of the
[53:24] Living God
[53:26] of a a a certain
[53:30] fearful looking
[53:34] for of the
[53:36] what of judgment and fiery
[53:41] indignation which shall
[53:45] what Devour the
[53:49] adversaries he that despised Moses law
[53:52] died without
[53:54] what under two or three
[53:57] Witnesses y'all understand
[54:00] that the Bible said if you love me

[55:15] right but I'm asking you you telling the

[55:42] mercy I need Mercy this morning I need
[55:46] mercy God have mercy on my
[55:49] soul lord I need

[55:55] recognize your
[55:56] condition when you recognize your
[55:59] condition you can repent and say God
[56:01] have
[56:02] mercy cuz one day there's going to come
[56:04] A Day of
[56:06] Reckoning a day we going to have to be
[56:09] accountable for the things that we done
[56:11] in this
[56:13] body that's going to come accountability
[56:16] we going to have to give
[56:20] account that's why I never wanted to be
[56:22] in a condition to be a preacher because
[56:24] I didn't want nobody blood on my hand
[56:28] and I got to give a
[56:30] account you know most people don't care
[56:32] what the preacher say hey preach ain't
[56:34] no count for me
[56:36] I I got a relationship me and
[56:41] God who want to be in the position where
[56:43] you got to be give account for people's
[56:48] Souls will you tell them what thus said
[56:51] the word is what thus said the Lord is
[56:54] and they say say who you think you
[56:59] are it's just
[57:01] like uh the police out there trying to
[57:06] tell you not to speed and they pull you
[57:09] over you told him wa who you think you
[57:12] are he's the
[57:15] police
[57:17] well you ain't got
[57:20] no jurisdiction over
[57:23] me
[57:25] are you with me and see that's the way
[57:28] the word of God say you broke the
[57:33] law you have not obeyed the
[57:38] truth and you said who under who's going
[57:42] to execute
[57:45] judgment who going to make me do
[57:48] right who's going to stop me from doing
[57:53] wrong
[57:55] for we have the little saying all have
[57:58] sinned and come short of the glory of
[58:02] God so who can judge me when we all in
[58:08] bad
[58:09] shape see we're not going to be judged
[58:12] by one
[58:13] another not merging ourselves by
[58:18] ourselves God going to have every man to
[58:21] be judged he going to look at the
[58:26] book this Bible is going to judge every
[58:30] man the preacher
[58:33] too every man is going to be judged by
[58:36] the
[58:38] word and what the word
[58:40] say is
[58:42] right I say he's
[58:45] faithful God is faithful that
[58:49] promise
[58:52] amen it said it's a
[58:55] a certain fear for
[58:59] amen the day of judgment the
