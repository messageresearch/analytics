[37:38] the book of jude
[37:43] the book of jude
[37:47] amen
[37:54] jude one if you have it say man
[37:58] jude one and
[38:00] three
[38:02] he says beloved
[38:04] when i gave all diligence to write unto
[38:07] you
[38:08] of the common salvation
[38:11] see it's common just common salvation
[38:16] if
[38:18] it was needful for me to write unto you
[38:21] and exalt you
[38:23] that you should earnestly
[38:25] contend
[38:27] for the faith which was once delivered
[38:29] unto the saints
[38:31] for there are certain men crept in
[38:33] unawares
[38:35] who were before of old ordained unto
[38:37] this condemnation
[38:39] ungodly men turning the grace of our god
[38:42] into luciferousness
[38:46] and denying the only lord god and our
[38:48] lord jesus christ
[38:52] i will therefore put you in remembrance
[38:56] though ye once knew
[38:59] this
[39:00] how that the lord having saved the
[39:02] people out of the land of egypt after
[39:05] what destroyed them that believed not
[39:09] and the angels which kept not their
[39:11] first estate
[39:13] but left their own habitation
[39:15] he had reserved in everlasting chains
[39:17] into darkness until the judgment of the
[39:20] great day
[39:22] even as sodom and gomorrah and the
[39:25] cities about them in like manner giving
[39:28] themselves over to fornication and going
[39:30] after strange flesh are set forth for an
[39:33] example of suffering and vengeance of
[39:35] eternal fire
[39:37] may the lord had a blessing to the
[39:38] reason of swords you may be seated
[39:42] i've thought tonight
[39:44] faith once delivered unto the saints
[39:47] faith once delivered unto the saints now
[39:50] we know
[39:51] faith is direct
[39:55] faith is a direct revelation
[39:58] it's a complete confidence and trust in
[40:00] god
[40:02] it settles you
[40:04] it establishes you
[40:06] so the faith that was once delivered
[40:08] unto the saints jude saying i earnestly
[40:11] i want you to earnestly contend for the
[40:13] faith that was once delivered unto the
[40:15] saints
[40:16] so what faith is he talking about
[40:19] what faith is he talking about once
[40:21] delivered unto the saints the faith of
[40:24] the children
[40:26] of the gospel of this bible
[40:29] the apostles and the prophets he's he as
[40:32] as
[40:33] as malachi said turn your hearts back to
[40:35] the faith that was once delivered unto
[40:37] the saints so this faith that we're
[40:39] talking about tonight we have to come
[40:42] back to it
[40:43] where the supernatural
[40:46] is taking place in our midst
[40:49] i want to read something here
[40:51] before i get too excited
[40:53] pastor simmons gave me this book
[40:55] years ago
[40:57] amen
[40:58] love forgives
[41:03] what produces faith
[41:05] forgiveness
[41:11] forgive continually
[41:14] and it forgives comprehensively
[41:17] forgiveness wipe clean the slate of
[41:19] offense
[41:22] hence it is freeing for everyone
[41:26] forgiveness was the heartbeat of jesus
[41:31] some of his last words requested
[41:33] forgiveness from god for the ignorant
[41:35] acts
[41:36] of his offenders
[41:40] christ's greatest act of love was
[41:42] forgiveness
[41:44] he extended by his voluntary death at
[41:48] the cross
[41:49] colossians 2
[41:51] 13-15
[41:53] forgiveness is the fuel
[41:56] for living a life free of clutter and
[41:58] cutting
[42:00] words
[42:01] of unjust acts
[42:04] see forgiveness
[42:07] is a fuel
[42:08] for living a life free of clutter of
[42:11] cutting words or unjust acts see when
[42:14] you begin to forgive tonight
[42:17] you don't have to worry about
[42:19] words that come out that shouldn't come
[42:21] out
[42:22] you don't have to worry about seeing
[42:24] things that you shouldn't say
[42:26] when you got a heart of forgiveness
[42:29] because forgiveness a checkmate
[42:32] it will begin to check your attitude and
[42:34] your behavior because
[42:36] let me don't get too excited
[42:39] a life without forgiveness is a lonely
[42:42] life locked up in his solitary
[42:44] confinement
[42:46] of sin
[42:48] forgiveness flows when you have been
[42:50] authenticated
[42:52] authentically and thoroughly forgiven
[42:56] half-hearted forgiveness
[42:58] is the destiny of those who have not
[43:01] tasted the tender touch of forgiveness
[43:05] from their heavenly father from from
[43:07] their heavenly father
[43:08] useless unless the forgiveness of god
[43:11] have graced your heart and soul your
[43:14] capacity forgiveness will be foreign and
[43:17] futile
[43:19] it is the grace of god and faith in him
[43:23] that fuels forgiveness
[43:26] to christ's followers
[43:29] the job description of christians is to
[43:32] love with forgiveness because we have
[43:34] been forgiven colossians 3 and 13.
[43:38] think about the depths and the breath of
[43:40] forgiveness
[43:43] ignorant acts they are forgiven
[43:47] drunkenness is forgiveness
[43:49] lust is forgiven
[43:52] immorality is forgiven hate is forgiven
[43:56] ignoring god is forgiven
[43:58] unbelief is forgiven
[44:01] love forgives because it has been
[44:03] forgiven
[44:05] see love forgives because it have been
[44:07] forgiven but we talking about faith
[44:09] tonight once delivered
[44:12] but as i started this sermon on last
[44:13] night
[44:14] god began to show me this morning
[44:17] to have faith they have to forgive
[44:20] you have to forgive to have faith and
[44:23] when you forgive it now anchors the love
[44:27] because first you recognize that you
[44:30] have been forgiven for your sins
[44:33] and once you recognize what love have
[44:36] been forgiven for what you have
[44:38] committed then you can look to your
[44:40] brother and your sister and forgive them
[44:42] for their ignorant acts
[44:44] and that is faith that's once delivered
[44:47] unto the saints
[44:49] see when the book of acts
[44:51] let's go to isaiah
[44:54] isaiah sometimes i get a little excited
[44:56] don't pray for me
[44:58] isaiah 53
[45:03] and one he said who i believed i report
[45:07] and to whom the arm of the lord has been
[45:09] revealed
[45:11] for he should grow up before him as a
[45:12] tender plant and a root out of dry
[45:14] ground
[45:15] he had no form or comeliness and when we
[45:17] should see him there's no beauty that we
[45:20] should desire him
[45:21] he is despised and rejected of men see
[45:24] he was rejected
[45:26] for you and i
[45:28] he was despised for you and i but yet he
[45:30] opened not his mouth
[45:33] he didn't see anything because of the
[45:36] way he went because he went for you and
[45:38] i
[45:39] he took the cross and he took it
[45:41] willingly and he took it and forgive
[45:44] them that put him there
[45:48] and when people put you at calvary and
[45:50] they kneel you to the cross of not being
[45:53] a christian or not loving you just begin
[45:55] to forgive them
[46:00] see you got to look over a person
[46:02] ignorance
[46:04] sometimes it begin to be stupidity but
[46:06] you have to look over it why because the
[46:08] forgiveness of god is in you by the
[46:11] baptism of the holy ghost it's the holy
[46:14] ghost that produces the faith that was
[46:17] once delivered unto the saints
[46:19] and that is the faith and be faith
[46:22] tonight if we if god held by the help of
[46:24] god the faith is the holy ghost inside
[46:27] of you that produces forgiveness that it
[46:30] produces love
[46:32] see your faith must produce love
[46:36] what's first faith
[46:38] virtue
[46:39] knowledge
[46:40] temperance
[46:42] patience
[46:43] brotherly kindness
[46:45] charity
[46:47] if these things be in you and abound
[46:49] they should neither make you barrel no
[46:51] and fruitful in the knowledge of our
[46:53] lord jesus christ so you got to look at
[46:56] your enemy you got to look at your
[46:58] brothers and sisters and said i'm going
[47:00] to forgive until it hurts
[47:05] because you will be tested on every hand
[47:08] to show forth that that holy ghost that
[47:11] you say you got it's gonna be tested
[47:14] it's harvest time now
[47:17] look what he says
[47:19] he is despised and rejected
[47:21] a man of sorrow and acquainted with
[47:23] grief and we hid as if it were our faces
[47:25] from him
[47:28] we esteemed him not surely i burned our
[47:31] griefs and carried our sorrows
[47:33] yet we did esteem him stricken smitten
[47:35] of god and afflicted
[47:38] but he was wounded for our
[47:39] transgressions
[47:41] he would bruise fire with nicoties
[47:44] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[47:45] him and with his stripes we are healed
[47:48] so when he was whipped
[47:51] you was healed
[47:53] when he was whipped you was healed
[47:55] of your sick sin condition
[47:58] he took your beating tonight
[48:01] he was he forgive them that beat him for
[48:04] you
[48:06] he was beaten for you and i but yet he
[48:09] forgave them because he saw you and i he
[48:12] saw the bride the lamb's wife
[48:14] and that's what he saw and when he saw
[48:16] you he said i'll take anything for you
[48:18] lord i take anything for you bride why
[48:21] and if you got the same spirit as romans
[48:24] 9 and 10 says if the same spirit that
[48:27] raised jesus from the dead if it dwell
[48:29] in you it he that raised up christ shall
[48:32] also quicken your mortal bodies what
[48:34] kind of quickening we looking for
[48:36] tonight are we looking for the
[48:38] supernatural are we looking for a life
[48:40] that's clean and pure before god
[48:43] because that's what we got to produce
[48:46] a clean pure life and that's what brings
[48:49] the faith that was once delivered unto
[48:51] the saints
[48:56] we all like sheep
[48:58] have gone astray and we have turned
[48:59] everyone to his own way and the lord
[49:02] have laid on him the iniquity of us all
[49:06] so
[49:07] who tonight can be
[49:09] angry
[49:11] or biased against somebody
[49:14] because if you have accepted his
[49:15] forgiveness
[49:17] then you got his faith
[49:20] and his faith can forgive your brother
[49:23] it can forgive your sister
[49:25] it can forgive your enemy i'm not
[49:28] talking about nobody in here but your
[49:30] enemy tonight
[49:31] is the devil and he can get in anybody
[49:34] in the world and test your faith tonight
[49:37] that was once delivered unto the saints
[49:39] he's going to test you why because this
[49:41] is harvest time
[49:45] harvest time i like harvest time because
[49:46] it mean i get to the end i don't have to
[49:48] work no more
[49:50] in the natural harvest time when you got
[49:52] five or ten acres of garden
[49:54] harvest time is the best time
[49:57] when you get everything out the field
[49:58] you ain't got to worry about going back
[49:59] to next year
[50:01] but it's harvest time now what's harvest
[50:04] time harvest time now
[50:06] is you're going to either produce
[50:08] the supernatural
[50:11] are you not
[50:13] you're going to have the faith or you
[50:15] not
[50:16] it is no in between
[50:18] you either got faith now are you not
[50:22] acts 2 and 1.
[50:28] acts 2 and 1.
[50:32] and see to have the faith the faith
[50:35] you must have the holy spirit
[50:38] it takes the holy spirit to forgive
[50:41] if you can't forgive you don't have the
[50:42] holy ghost
[50:44] because forgiveness starts with love
[50:47] you got the first love god to forgive
[50:49] your brother
[50:51] and see jesus had a god pay love that's
[50:53] why he could forgive them that whipped
[50:54] him
[50:55] he could forgive them that nailed his
[50:57] hands into the the post and his feeding
[50:59] to the post he could forgive them his
[51:02] own enemies and you don't have to go
[51:04] there but acts 7 51 the bible says
[51:07] stephen looked up steadfastly into
[51:09] heaven and saw jesus sitting on the
[51:11] right hand of god and said father
[51:13] forgive them for they know not what they
[51:15] do they throw them out of the city and
[51:17] begin to bash his head in the ground but
[51:20] he said that verse i think 40 something
[51:22] he said you stiff neck and
[51:24] uncircumcising heart you do always
[51:26] resist the holy ghost just like your
[51:28] father do
[51:30] so
[51:33] so them that want the holy ghost tonight
[51:35] and them that have it
[51:37] they can forgive and love
[51:39] and they won't complain about it
[51:41] their love without without any problem
[51:45] acts two and one
[51:46] and when the day of pentecost was fully
[51:48] come they were all in one place and one
[51:49] accord
[51:53] in one place and suddenly there came a
[51:55] sound from heaven as a rushing mighty
[51:56] wind and it filled all the house where
[51:57] they were sitting
[51:59] and they appeared unto them clothing
[52:00] tongues like as a fire and sat upon each
[52:02] of them
[52:03] and they were all all filled with the
[52:05] holy ghost
[52:08] filled with the holy ghost
[52:10] and began to speak with other tongues
[52:11] that the spear gave them utterance
[52:14] and they were dealing dwelling at
[52:15] jerusalem devout men out of every nation
[52:17] under heaven now when this was gnaws
[52:19] abroad the multitude came together and
[52:20] were confounded because that every man
[52:23] heard them speak in their own language
[52:27] just because they spoke in tongues they
[52:28] didn't have the holy ghost
[52:30] but the bible said they spoke with
[52:31] tongues after the holy ghost came upon
[52:33] them
[52:34] now let's go to verse 32.
[52:38] he said this jesus
[52:40] have god raised up where we are
[52:42] witnesses see when you got the holy
[52:44] ghost you are a witness tonight
[52:46] you are a witness of faith tonight when
[52:48] you have the holy ghost we are witnesses
[52:51] witnesses of what of a christian life
[52:55] witnesses of the resurrection
[52:57] that's what we are witnesses of
[52:59] we're not just coming to church we are a
[53:01] witness tonight
[53:03] glory to god i'm supposed to have two
[53:05] families tonight come with uh visit to
[53:07] me tonight but one of his wife got home
[53:10] late and he said it was coming but the
[53:12] lord knows all things the lord knows all
[53:15] things
[53:16] y'all just pray for them we have bible
[53:18] study with them on monday
[53:19] friday saturday and mondays y'all pray
[53:22] for our strength in the lord because
[53:24] it's got to be jesus
[53:26] you got to build a foundation a platform
[53:29] you got to let people know it's jesus
[53:31] and jesus alone
[53:32] they want to make him anything but i
[53:34] want to make him jesus christ the same
[53:35] yesterday today in favor he's the lord
[53:38] above us he's jesus with us and he's
[53:40] christ in us the holy spirit and once he
[53:42] comes inside of you you don't have to
[53:44] worry about him leaving you no more once
[53:46] he comes inside of you then you got the
[53:48] power to have faith and you got the
[53:51] power to forgive
[53:54] wonder why brotherly kindness is at the
[53:56] top so close to the top of the ladder
[53:58] in the pyramid
[54:00] because that's what peter had to do
[54:03] he said lord increase my faith he went
[54:05] all the way back to the first
[54:07] part of the pyramid of faith but jesus
[54:10] was trying to put him at the sixth piece
[54:12] which was brotherly kindness
[54:15] he said if your brother offends you
[54:17] you got to forgive him jesus is just
[54:19] talking about a brother forgiving you
[54:21] not not an enemy doing you wrong but a
[54:23] brother forgiven you he said how many
[54:25] times i got to forgive him lord he said
[54:27] unto seven times seven no no no no seven
[54:29] times seventy you got to forgive him
[54:32] but he didn't have the holy ghost in
[54:34] but after he got the holy ghost then he
[54:36] said you men of israel hawking unto my
[54:38] words these men are not drunk as ye
[54:39] suppose seeing is the third hour of the
[54:41] day but this is that which is spoken by
[54:43] the prophet joel that in the last days
[54:45] said god i'll pour out my spirit upon
[54:47] all flesh your sons and daughters shall
[54:48] prophesy your young men should see
[54:50] vision your old man's your dream tree
[54:51] and upon my handmaids and upon my
[54:52] servants i'll pour out my spirit that's
[54:54] what we're looking for tonight god to
[54:56] pour out his spirit if you've been
[54:57] filled we need a refilling we need a
[54:59] refilling of the holy ghost god brought
[55:01] your spirit upon all men
[55:03] that the sons and daughters shall
[55:04] prophesy we can't make it with dr holy
[55:07] ghost
[55:08] you can't get past first first base
[55:10] without the holy ghost you must be born
[55:13] again
[55:15] you must be born out of water only but
[55:17] by the spirit you must have a birth in
[55:20] your soul that anchors you and seals you
[55:23] into the kingdom
[55:25] and now you ready to be adopted but we
[55:28] can't be adopted if we sit in there
[55:30] worrying about somebody say about us
[55:34] stephen they whipped him they bashed his
[55:35] head in
[55:37] they had to let paul down in a basket
[55:40] because they were trying to kill him but
[55:42] paul the bible said he was stoned and
[55:44] left dead outside the city and the bible
[55:47] said when he came back through i believe
[55:49] the holy ghost wake got him back up
[55:52] when he came back through what did he do
[55:55] he he went jumping and leaping into the
[55:58] next city to tell somebody about jesus
[56:06] he got up went to the next city to
[56:08] preach jesus
[56:10] so if you despise tonight
[56:12] if you reject it tonight
[56:14] know that you're god's children
[56:17] notice you're a child of god people get
[56:19] all up tight when somebody do something
[56:21] do them wrong or talk about them or say
[56:23] something about them that is part of
[56:25] your
[56:26] character building
[56:29] get with the program this is a test of
[56:31] the american broadcast system this is
[56:33] only a test
[56:35] and you got to pass it
[56:37] but you first must be born again with
[56:39] the holy ghost not on your flesh not on
[56:41] your spirit but down in your soul where
[56:44] you're anchored in the word
[56:46] you will not reject none of the word
[56:47] when the holy ghost come now and that is
[56:49] your seal and getting you ready for
[56:51] adoption
[56:56] jesus on mount transfiguration i'm
[56:58] getting off my sermon now matthew 17.
[57:02] peter said let's make three tabernacles
[57:04] one for moses one for elijah and one for
[57:05] thee
[57:07] and it came down and said jesus only
[57:10] he been accepted the bible said the
[57:12] angels of god ascending and descending
[57:14] upon the son of man
[57:16] so now he'd been accepted and he had
[57:17] power without measure so he could go
[57:20] about doing all signs and wonders so no
[57:22] matter somebody spitting his face it was
[57:24] all right with him
[57:25] nobody somebody whipped him it was all
[57:27] right with him if you see that casket
[57:29] laying down in front of the church right
[57:30] here don't matter what somebody how much
[57:32] they cry no matter how much tears come
[57:35] no matter how much they kiss him in
[57:36] touch he ain't gonna say nothing
[57:41] because he didn't transfer to the other
[57:42] side
[57:44] and you as a christian
[57:46] paul said if i live i live in christ
[57:49] and if you live tonight you live by the
[57:51] faith of the son of god that died for
[57:53] you
[57:59] there it is too and this jesus whom god
[58:01] raised up wherever we are witnesses
[58:03] therefore being by the right hand of god
[58:05] exalted having received of the father
[58:08] the promise of the holy ghost he has
[58:10] shed forth this which ye now see
[58:12] and hear
[58:14] for david is ascended into the heavens
[58:16] but he said
[58:17] himself the lord said unto my lord sit
[58:20] down thy right hand until i make thy
[58:22] foes that footstool
[58:23] therefore let all the house of israel
[58:25] know surely that god had made this same
[58:26] jesus whom you crucified both lord and
[58:29] christ
[58:31] see my bible still denies that this is
[58:33] one lord
[58:36] people have been taught all kind of ways
[58:38] but paul said i've laid the foundation
[58:40] of the
[58:41] earth
[58:42] and paul said if a man built upon this
[58:44] foundation you better watch how you
[58:45] build
[58:47] hey stubble whatever you build has got
[58:49] to be built upon jesus christ
[58:51] because acts 4 and 12 that says none
[58:53] other name under heaven given among men
[58:54] whereby you must be saved by the name of
[58:56] jesus it ain't yahshua it ain't rosa
[58:58] sharon it ain't father son holy ghost
[59:00] it's jesus christ
[59:03] paul
[59:04] they act like they didn't want to they
[59:06] didn't understand about baptizing john
[59:08] the baptist
[59:10] paul passing through the upper coast of
[59:11] essex acts 19 he said have you received
[59:13] the holy ghost since you believe he's
[59:15] we're not ever heard in the holy ghost
[59:16] he said then were you baptized under
[59:18] john the baptist baptism of repentance
[59:19] saying it's your weight on him which has
[59:20] come after him which is christ the lord
[59:23] and they baptized him in the name of the
[59:25] lord jesus christ
[59:27] and at the power of the name of jesus
[59:29] your faith in jesus name tonight demons
[59:32] got to flee
[59:34] demons got to go tonight in the name of
[59:36] jesus and when you call the name of
[59:38] jesus there's power in that name there's
[59:41] victory in that name there's forgiveness
[59:43] in that name there's faith in that name
[59:45] there's love in that name when you call
[59:47] it
[59:49] but what anchors your
[59:51] what anchors when you call it
[59:53] if your heart is right
[59:55] and it must be the holy ghost in your
[59:56] heart
[59:57] it must be the baptism of the holy ghost
[59:59] in your heart because we know as humans
[1:00:01] we know ourselves each individual know
[1:00:04] ourselves where we stand with god
[1:00:06] and it must be by faith and that of
[1:00:09] works not only but it's the gift of god
[1:00:15] therefore let all the house of israel
[1:00:16] know surely that god had made the same
[1:00:18] jesus whom he crucified both lord and
[1:00:20] christ
[1:00:20] and now when they heard this they were
[1:00:22] pricked in their what
[1:00:24] hearts and said unto peter and the rest
[1:00:25] of the apostles men and brethren what
[1:00:27] shall we do then peter said unto them
[1:00:29] repent become godly sorry
[1:00:32] don't just hear the preacher from sunday
[1:00:33] to sunday no repent
[1:00:36] become repent and be godly sorry
[1:00:39] and as you repent you will repent until
[1:00:42] you leave here
[1:00:44] just because you got the holy ghost it
[1:00:45] don't mean you shouldn't repent no more
[1:00:46] all you're doing is fortifying that
[1:00:48] spirit of god in you the bible say pray
[1:00:50] in your most holy faith praying in the
[1:00:52] what
[1:00:53] holy ghost
[1:00:55] so sometimes god had to clean his stuff
[1:00:57] off the side of us you know the gold
[1:00:59] sometimes get a little dross on it gotta
[1:01:01] be polished
[1:01:02] and prayer polishes
[1:01:04] that goal
[1:01:07] then peter said unto them repent be
[1:01:08] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:01:10] jesus christ for the remission of sins
[1:01:12] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:01:13] holy ghost for the promises unto you
[1:01:15] unto your children to them that are
[1:01:16] fallen even as men as the lord our god
[1:01:18] shall call
[1:01:19] our children need the holy ghost
[1:01:21] they can't make it with that
[1:01:23] in this time now children cannot make it
[1:01:25] without the holy ghost
[1:01:26] we got to get on our knees and pray with

[1:02:56] and we can't get old and say we just
[1:02:58] coming in and out of the church we're
[1:02:59] just hearing the pastor no lord what
[1:03:01] will you have me to do
[1:03:03] and
[1:03:04] god set you on fire with something to do
[1:03:06] then now
[1:03:08] you part of the kingdom
[1:03:10] look what he says
[1:03:12] and saul arose
[1:03:15] and the men which journeyed with him
[1:03:19] stood speechless hearing a voice but
[1:03:21] seeing no man and saul arose from the
[1:03:23] earth and when his eyes were open he saw
[1:03:26] no man but they led him by the hand
[1:03:29] and brought him unto damascus and he was
[1:03:32] three days without sight and neither did
[1:03:35] eat or drink
[1:03:36] and there was a certain man
[1:03:38] certain disciple at damascus named
[1:03:40] ananias and to him said the lord in a
[1:03:43] vision
[1:03:45] ananias and he said
[1:03:47] behold i am here lord and his lord said
[1:03:50] unto him arise go in the street which is
[1:03:52] called straight and inquire in the house
[1:03:53] of judas one called saul of tarsus for
[1:03:56] behold he what
[1:03:58] prayer see after god doesn't stop paul
[1:04:01] saul now he praying he's the lord what
[1:04:03] were you having to do now he without
[1:04:05] sight three days and he praying god what
[1:04:06] will you have me to do now look what
[1:04:08] happens
[1:04:09] and he seen any vision and the man named
[1:04:12] ananias coming in and putting his hand
[1:04:14] on him that he might receive his sight
[1:04:16] and ananias ananias was scared of that
[1:04:18] paul saul
[1:04:20] i have heard by this man of how evil he
[1:04:23] have done to thy saints at jerusalem and
[1:04:25] here he have authority from the chief
[1:04:26] priest to bind all that call on his name
[1:04:29] see it's coming back to that point
[1:04:32] that's what's going to bring the faith
[1:04:33] tonight
[1:04:35] when they're buying you for calling on
[1:04:37] the name of jesus when you can't have
[1:04:39] services in a setting like this you
[1:04:41] won't be able to have this service after
[1:04:43] a while and then your faith is going to
[1:04:45] be tested then it's going to be the
[1:04:47] faith you're going to put people in jail
[1:04:48] they're going to do all kind of stuff
[1:04:49] and then you got to be ready then
[1:04:51] because when they put paul and silas in
[1:04:53] prison in acts 16 the bible said they
[1:04:56] sang praises under god and the
[1:04:58] foundation of the prison bars was
[1:05:01] sheikah
[1:05:03] amen
[1:05:05] see god has to get us in a condition
[1:05:08] that now the faith is coming out of us
[1:05:11] but it must be the holy ghost in you to
[1:05:13] bring the faith out of you
[1:05:16] the faith was once delivered unto the
[1:05:18] saints
[1:05:19] when they took jesus the disciples
[1:05:21] walked with him three years and a half
[1:05:24] and all of them they didn't know him
[1:05:27] they left him
[1:05:29] they left him
[1:05:31] he said you'll deny me three times but
[1:05:32] after you convert it strengthen your
[1:05:34] brother
[1:05:35] if you can't take somebody persecuting
[1:05:37] you not in the church or in the world
[1:05:39] what you gonna do when they come against
[1:05:41] the church
[1:05:43] what you gonna do then you got to have
[1:05:45] it now
[1:05:46] you got to have per you got to be able
[1:05:48] to let people persecute you now and
[1:05:50] that's what's going to increase your
[1:05:51] faith
[1:05:53] right now
[1:05:55] we're not playing games now this is real
[1:05:57] business
[1:05:58] this is serious business all the plan is
[1:06:00] bought over
[1:06:01] when they turn away from you ukrainian
[1:06:03] it could turn on us
[1:06:05] amen
[1:06:06] they're already killing christians in
[1:06:07] other countries already
[1:06:10] because of the name of jesus
[1:06:12] when they turn on you what a free
[1:06:14] democracy it won't be free after a while
[1:06:17] you can't say and do what you want you
[1:06:19] can't say nothing about certain people
[1:06:20] now that don't change
[1:06:22] or flip or transgender you can't say
[1:06:24] nothing not in the public and don't get
[1:06:27] locked up
[1:06:29] look what he says
[1:06:31] let's go to verse 17. and ananias went
[1:06:34] his way and entered into the house
[1:06:36] and putting his hands on him said
[1:06:37] brother saul the lord even jesus that
[1:06:40] appeared unto thee in the way
[1:06:42] and
[1:06:42] as thou came us has sent me that thou
[1:06:45] mightest receive thy sight and be filled
[1:06:47] with the
[1:06:50] and immediately there fell from his eyes
[1:06:52] as he'd been
[1:06:54] scales
[1:06:56] and he received sight at full with and
[1:06:58] arose and was baptized
[1:07:00] and when he had received meat he was
[1:07:02] strengthened then
[1:07:04] then was saw certain days with the
[1:07:06] disciples which were at damascus and
[1:07:08] then after that he began to preach jesus
[1:07:11] he began to preach jesus but let's go
[1:07:12] back to luke 24.
[1:07:17] luke 24
[1:07:19] and 25.
[1:07:22] see these people didn't have the faith
[1:07:23] that they should have
[1:07:25] see sometimes we can be in the church
[1:07:27] and we ain't got the faith that we need
[1:07:30] we're just going to read is going along
[1:07:33] but look what happened luke 24 and 25
[1:07:36] then he said unto them o fools and slow
[1:07:38] of heart to believe all that the
[1:07:41] prophets have spoken
[1:07:43] see we got to see what have been spoken
[1:07:47] ought not christ to have suffered these
[1:07:49] things and to enter into his glory and
[1:07:51] beginning at moses and all the prophets
[1:07:54] he expounded in all the scriptures of
[1:07:57] things concerning him
[1:08:00] it ain't two gods it ain't three gods
[1:08:01] it's one god the things concerning
[1:08:04] himself
[1:08:05] he expounded unto them the things
[1:08:07] concerning himself so he began to tell
[1:08:10] them hey look in the scriptures look in
[1:08:12] the word this thing is concerning me
[1:08:15] i've already suffered you're going to
[1:08:17] have to suffer also and you're going to
[1:08:19] have to forgive the unforgivable you're
[1:08:22] going gonna have to be blessed you're
[1:08:24] gonna have to bless them that catch you
[1:08:26] you're gonna have to love them that hate
[1:08:28] you you're gonna it's gonna take that
[1:08:30] kind of faith
[1:08:32] that take you into the next dimension
[1:08:34] that now you walking in the very
[1:08:37] presence
[1:08:38] of the anointing of jesus christ you're
[1:08:41] walking by the very power of forgiveness
[1:08:44] tonight and everyone that has died that
[1:08:47] had the holy ghost
[1:08:48] they had supreme
[1:08:50] deity of forgiveness and love
[1:08:53] in their heart because they know it was
[1:08:55] time to transfer over
[1:09:00] so when somebody spit in your face
[1:09:02] somebody do you wrong
[1:09:06] dar is over there we worked together
[1:09:08] years ago
[1:09:10] holy spirit had me fasting for seven
[1:09:12] days i don't know why
[1:09:14] but during that time sister dars can
[1:09:16] tell you me and this guy working
[1:09:18] together he slapped me the holy spirit
[1:09:20] said that's why i had you faster just go
[1:09:22] ahead don't take it brother
[1:09:24] god bless you love him anyway
[1:09:27] and i just went on by my business
[1:09:30] that's the enemy
[1:09:32] and somebody but i'm saying god has to
[1:09:35] show us where we get into then we get to
[1:09:38] the point where somebody do what's wrong
[1:09:39] then we ain't the way we thought we was
[1:09:42] we ain't where we say we are
[1:09:45] in christ
[1:09:46] you know so i ain't gonna say none of
[1:09:47] y'all said but i got some people at the
[1:09:49] job they hired me at this page and i
[1:09:52] look at my paycheck a month or two later
[1:09:54] and it ain't where it's supposed to be i
[1:09:56] said man
[1:09:57] i'd make sure my paycheck right before i
[1:09:59] take the job
[1:10:01] but that's how some people are
[1:10:03] see god
[1:10:05] send tests to you
[1:10:07] and as you fail the test god sent it
[1:10:10] back again
[1:10:11] so somebody come to slap you or spit on
[1:10:13] you or talk about your children
[1:10:15] i talk about your mama or daddy
[1:10:19] prophet they talk about the prophet mama
[1:10:21] he said the man didn't mean it
[1:10:23] and then he he said he didn't mean it
[1:10:25] then he come then he went around and
[1:10:27] said yeah he
[1:10:28] he he didn't mean it but i forgive him
[1:10:30] anyway the man couldn't even turn the
[1:10:32] prophet
[1:10:33] on the man talking about his mama
[1:10:36] but what if somebody talked about one of
[1:10:37] your children
[1:10:39] say something about them or say
[1:10:41] something about your church
[1:10:43] or say something about your daddy
[1:10:46] see god the devil nowhere to turn it on
[1:10:49] and off with you
[1:10:51] or talk about your house or anything
[1:10:53] your job or anything the devil know
[1:10:55] where to turn it off and turn it on with
[1:10:57] you
[1:10:58] but you got to be to the point now that
[1:11:00] your holy ghost doing the forgiveness
[1:11:02] where it doesn't make a difference my
[1:11:04] eyes are set as a flint toward calvary
[1:11:07] i saw he forgave me for my sins and my
[1:11:09] shortcomings i saw what he did for me
[1:11:12] and what he did for me should transform
[1:11:15] you into the very image of the
[1:11:17] resurrection
[1:11:19] it must transform you into a place that
[1:11:21] no matter what somebody say or do to you
[1:11:23] should harm you
[1:11:25] but you know what
[1:11:26] at first you said i forgive them
[1:11:29] then the devil brother josh just get you
[1:11:31] to thinking about it a week later why
[1:11:32] did he did that to me
[1:11:34] the next thing you know he done made it
[1:11:36] into a goliath
[1:11:38] you forgive him at that point but the
[1:11:39] devil bring it back to your remembrance
[1:11:40] you know what you shouldn't take that
[1:11:43] you don't know who you are you're a
[1:11:45] great man
[1:11:46] see that's a problem with people they
[1:11:48] think they're great
[1:11:49] they think they're great
[1:11:51] see the devil want you to think you're
[1:11:53] great you're somebody big but you ain't
[1:11:54] nothing
[1:11:56] you're not nothing none of us are
[1:11:57] nothing
[1:11:59] and as long as you can stay nothing
[1:12:01] then the devil can't move you
[1:12:03] never can never thought he was a great
[1:12:04] man
[1:12:05] and god made him back to eat grass as a
[1:12:08] oxen
[1:12:09] he took his mind and everything then
[1:12:11] when god gave it back to him he said now
[1:12:12] i extolled the lord
[1:12:14] see when you begin to think that you
[1:12:16] something
[1:12:17] i didn't read it in my book of
[1:12:18] forgiveness but that's the way the devil
[1:12:20] get us
[1:12:21] when you think you somebody because you
[1:12:23] got education or you got a statues or
[1:12:25] whatever then that's what the devil
[1:12:26] worked with
[1:12:28] when you think you're somebody
[1:12:31] i'm the pastor
[1:12:32] i'm the bishop
[1:12:34] i'm a minister of jesus christ you know
[1:12:36] how long i've been ministering and they
[1:12:37] did me did that to me
[1:12:39] let them do it
[1:12:41] because ain't nothing on this earth is
[1:12:42] yours everything is yours in heaven
[1:12:44] don't worry about what they did to you
[1:12:46] here
[1:12:47] cause all your treasures is in heaven
[1:12:51] that's where your treasures are so don't
[1:12:53] worry about what they do to you you know
[1:12:55] they might open the door and bump your
[1:12:56] car
[1:12:58] man i'm sorry hitting your car man don't
[1:12:59] worry about this end up with a piece of
[1:13:00] metal
[1:13:02] you see what i'm saying don't worry
[1:13:04] about those things the more you begin to
[1:13:07] dip into that love
[1:13:09] that love began to anchor your faith in
[1:13:12] the very promises of the resurrection
[1:13:15] and now
[1:13:16] you're not seeing like a hawker buzzard
[1:13:20] you're seeing like an eagle
[1:13:23] a hawker buzzer can see anything on the
[1:13:25] ground because they're looking below the
[1:13:27] clouds
[1:13:29] but you are eagle all you can look down
[1:13:32] and see is clouds of glory man you're
[1:13:34] looking at clouds of glory but if you're
[1:13:36] a hawk you're on the telegram pole
[1:13:38] looking down you can see everything rats
[1:13:41] and turtles and snakes and everything
[1:13:43] but the eagle flies above the clouds
[1:13:46] and the eagle can forgive
[1:13:48] unconditionally
[1:13:50] eagle represents a prophetic anointing
[1:13:53] and that's what we are under a prophetic
[1:13:55] anointing and if you under that your
[1:13:58] prophet is jesus
[1:14:01] [Applause]
[1:14:02] amen

[1:14:20] his vineyard

[1:14:27] i've been in the church three years
[1:14:30] and ain't got the holy ghost
[1:14:34] i've been in the church three years i
[1:14:35] ain't got the holy ghost
[1:14:37] these three years
[1:14:41] i come seeking fruit on this fig tree
[1:14:46] and find it none
[1:14:51] cut it down why cumbereth hit the ground
[1:14:56] and he answered and said unto the lord
[1:14:59] let it alone this year
[1:15:02] also till i shall dig around it and
[1:15:06] dung it
[1:15:07] and if it bear fruit well and if not
[1:15:11] there
[1:15:12] after that thou shalt cut it to the
[1:15:15] ground
[1:15:17] i wonder what he's digging for
[1:15:19] see you got to get down on your knees
[1:15:21] and dig in prayer
[1:15:23] that that same faith that was once
[1:15:25] delivered unto the saints you got to
[1:15:27] just not a dry eye prayer you got to
[1:15:30] pray until something takes place

[1:15:38] down that you can put your television
[1:15:39] down that something takes you to a level
[1:15:43] that now you are digging into the very
[1:15:45] promises of the resurrection

[1:17:54] 50 years old i said yes ma'am
[1:17:58] i said i'll come and get it tomorrow
[1:18:00] after work just put it up i'll come and
[1:18:01] get it
[1:18:02] but see
[1:18:04] god
[1:18:05] by sovereign grace
[1:18:09] your faith
[1:18:11] is going to be translated into
[1:18:14] the supernatural
[1:18:15] because of the obstacles that is against
[1:18:18] you
[1:18:20] when god sees that you rather pray than
[1:18:22] look at your phone
[1:18:23] you rather pray than look at play games
[1:18:26] you rather prayed and do these things
[1:18:28] then now that's what see god already
[1:18:30] knew before the foundation the world
[1:18:31] what we'll be up against in this age
[1:18:33] with the young people but the holy ghost
[1:18:36] is able to sustain us
[1:18:38] the holy ghost is able to get us there
[1:18:41] by a supernatural intervention
[1:18:44] he's able to get us there into a place
[1:18:47] of the resurrection
[1:18:50] he's able to get us there
[1:18:52] one last scripture
[1:18:56] galatians
[1:18:57] 5 and 22.
[1:19:01] he's able to get us that d faith
[1:19:06] [Music]
[1:19:08] but the fruit of the spirit is love
[1:19:10] joy
[1:19:12] peace
[1:19:13] long suffering gentleness goodness
[1:19:15] faith
[1:19:17] meekness temperance
[1:19:19] against their
[1:19:20] against such there is no what
[1:19:24] law
[1:19:26] there's no law and they that are crisis
[1:19:29] have crucified the
[1:19:31] flesh
[1:19:33] with the affections and
[1:19:36] lust
[1:19:37] see
[1:19:38] they that are crisis
[1:19:40] have crucified see nothing controls you
[1:19:43] but christ now not the cell phone not
[1:19:46] the car not the house but christ
[1:19:49] controls you now cause the flesh and the
[1:19:52] lust have been crucified
[1:19:58] now that's powerful
[1:20:01] if we live in the spirit
[1:20:03] let us also walk in the spirit
[1:20:06] let us not be desires of vain glory
[1:20:09] provoking one another envying one
[1:20:11] another
[1:20:13] see if we walk in the spirit
[1:20:16] we walking in the spirit
[1:20:18] then the things of the flesh don't
[1:20:20] bother us
[1:20:22] see you have and see the faith is gonna
[1:20:24] get you there
[1:20:26] the faith is gonna get you i said lord
[1:20:28] let me teach this tonight as best i can
[1:20:30] because if i get excited i i go off
[1:20:32] where i i don't want to go sometimes i
[1:20:34] get off i can i don't get my point
[1:20:36] across but
[1:20:37] the faith
[1:20:39] the faith is the holy ghost tonight
[1:20:42] the baptism of the holy ghost put the
[1:20:44] faith once delivered unto the saints
[1:20:47] because they didn't have the faith until
[1:20:49] the day of pentecost and then after the
[1:20:51] day of pentecost then the faith was once
[1:20:54] delivered unto them and they went about
[1:20:56] doing all things look what they told the
[1:20:58] sanhedrin council they said we ought to
[1:21:00] obey man than god
[1:21:02] peter began to let them know
[1:21:04] this man that was healed
[1:21:06] we ought to obey man god than man they
[1:21:09] was looking for they said now you whip
[1:21:11] them and you beat them
[1:21:14] because they don't call jesus name again
[1:21:16] and the bible said they were beat and it
[1:21:18] was whipped
[1:21:19] and they went rejoicing because they
[1:21:22] what
[1:21:23] it was whipped for the name of jesus
[1:21:25] and they went in the next city
[1:21:27] they see the synagogue didn't we just
[1:21:28] not let tell you don't say no name of
[1:21:30] jesus
[1:21:32] because in the power in the name of
[1:21:34] jesus but their faith the faith made
[1:21:37] them anchor the very promises of the
[1:21:40] resurrection so as your faith tonight
[1:21:44] the faith is anchored by the baptism of
[1:21:46] the holy ghost
[1:21:48] and when it anchors your faith you're
[1:21:50] ready to go to the next level
[1:21:52] and guess what the first thing you're
[1:21:53] gonna do is forgive
[1:21:58] because you're going to be despised and
[1:21:59] rejected you're going to be beat you're
[1:22:00] going something's going to happen to us
[1:22:03] and we got to be able to know that we at
[1:22:06] a certain level in god
[1:22:08] to withstand it now stephen in acts 6 7
[1:22:12] and 51.
[1:22:13] look what happened to him they bashed
[1:22:16] his head and threw it about to sit the
[1:22:17] bible said they stopped their ears they
[1:22:19] didn't want to hear no more what he was
[1:22:21] saying
[1:22:24] he stopped the ears and ran unto him
[1:22:26] with one accord threw him out the city
[1:22:28] and beat him bash his head in with rocks
[1:22:31] and stones
[1:22:33] and they're doing the same thing to paul
[1:22:37] so what are we coming to
[1:22:39] just another great church service
[1:22:43] or are we doing what the preacher is
[1:22:45] saying
[1:22:46] are we really living it and manifesting
[1:22:48] it oh he'll preach it
[1:22:50] before you get out the door you're mad
[1:22:52] with somebody
[1:22:55] some days it's gonna be over after a
[1:22:57] while
[1:22:58] we got the love
[1:23:00] with a passion and the only way you're
[1:23:01] gonna love with a passion
[1:23:03] it's got to be a prayer
[1:23:05] you got to dig in in prayer
[1:23:07] until the holy ghost call
[1:23:10] amen
[1:23:11] i ain't getting mad with people that i
[1:23:12] have bible study with i just see where
[1:23:14] they they're not where they need to be
[1:23:15] at and they ask questions
[1:23:18] constructive criticism is great
[1:23:21] because you want to answer a person's
[1:23:23] questions because you don't you want
[1:23:24] them to get god where they need it
[1:23:28] because it's going to come a time
[1:23:31] where marriages is not
[1:23:32] successful families is not successful
[1:23:35] they can't make it under the screen and
[1:23:37] the pressure that the devil is going to
[1:23:39] bring to them
[1:23:41] families is going to be the star toss to
[1:23:43] and fro why because they didn't dig in
[1:23:46] in prayer to sustain their families by
[1:23:49] the power of the faith
[1:23:52] son i forgive you
[1:23:55] son i love you daughter i love you
[1:23:58] even though they are wrong
[1:24:00] the devil looking for you to be angry
[1:24:03] with them
[1:24:04] but if you show them perfect love
[1:24:07] glory to god that's what brings up but
[1:24:09] if you said bruh son you did this you
[1:24:11] did this you did that you did that
[1:24:13] always finding what he done wrong or she
[1:24:15] done wrong instead of looking at what
[1:24:17] she's done right
[1:24:19] jimmy you're going to look at what she's
[1:24:20] done right and that only not works with
[1:24:22] your children it works with your wife
[1:24:24] your husband and the church members find
[1:24:26] out what they do good instead of always
[1:24:29] beating them up and say what they've
[1:24:30] done wrong
[1:24:33] so we help us of one another because god
[1:24:35] forgave all of us
[1:24:37] from sin
[1:24:39] amen and that is the grace and power of
[1:24:42] the resurrection
[1:24:45] and that's leaders
[1:24:47] leaders ain't always looking at what you
[1:24:48] did wrong
[1:24:51] the superintendent said man everybody
[1:24:52] want to work with you
[1:24:54] he said why that's cause they never do
[1:24:56] no wrong when they're with me they ain't
[1:24:58] gonna take up no equipment
[1:25:00] they make all the mistakes they can make
[1:25:01] they say well what you think what do you
[1:25:03] think uh preacher can i try this i said
[1:25:05] yeah try as long as it's in the bounds
[1:25:06] of getting the equipment back going
[1:25:08] then they see where they fall on their
[1:25:10] face now let's do it my way now you
[1:25:11] don't have your way now go ahead and do
[1:25:13] it this way and they find out it worked
[1:25:15] right
[1:25:17] you said i'm saying a leader a great
[1:25:20] leader had been a great follower
[1:25:23] a great follower will become a great
[1:25:25] leader
[1:25:26] because i ain't always know everything
[1:25:28] and neither do you
[1:25:30] so let's work together for the kingdom's
[1:25:31] sake god bless you brothers
[1:25:34] [Applause]
[1:25:49] [Applause]
[1:25:52] him i i
[1:25:54] prayed with him in the back i
[1:25:56] told him i said the lord must have
[1:25:57] wanted you to preach tonight i said
[1:25:59] brother gordon called me

[1:26:14] couple of songs on my heart anyway so
[1:26:17] and then he i says you know i'm about to
[1:26:18] go out there right now
[1:26:20] a little bit an hour or so that was
[1:26:22] about five o'clock something like that

[1:26:41] i said lord lord if we get there
[1:26:44] just let it be something simple
[1:26:46] god you know so we got there and
[1:26:48] it wasn't really simple but was able by
[1:26:51] the grace of god to get back up here so
[1:26:53] i thank the lord for that
[1:26:55] but
[1:26:56] i just said that you know the devil's
[1:26:59] he's in he gets in your way all the time
[1:27:01] but why because maybe it's a i know it's
[1:27:03] a blessing there
[1:27:04] so you still gotta press i i didn't
[1:27:07] wanna hug brother carl i got smud all
[1:27:08] over my hands so i put it all the back
[1:27:10] his shirt but
[1:27:11] god knows anyway don't he you know it's
[1:27:14] something about that what he was talking
[1:27:16] about love
[1:27:18] i was sharing with um
[1:27:20] last sunday and i was telling my wife
[1:27:21] i'ma say it i said
[1:27:24] you know uh i think sister dale shared
[1:27:26] with me a while back that in in the
[1:27:28] black homes the males don't tell their
[1:27:30] sons they love them
[1:27:32] it says majority of them don't and
[1:27:34] that's a problem
[1:27:35] and they never get that affection from
[1:27:38] their dads
[1:27:39] so i thought about that and i told my
[1:27:41] dad i said
[1:27:42] i ain't never heard you say you love me
[1:27:44] i told my daddy that and you know he's
[1:27:46] still there saying
[1:27:49] he told me he said you know i do boy
[1:27:51] ain't got to tell you that i said you
[1:27:52] told bricktale britain or rachel all the
[1:27:54] time i never heard you say you love me
[1:27:55] never ever
[1:27:57] he still has said it
[1:27:58] right but last last week i told
[1:28:02] charlotte he called me by accident
[1:28:04] then i called him back he was like he's
[1:28:07] just talking and he just said son you
[1:28:09] know i love you
[1:28:11] he just kept saying
[1:28:12] you know i love you i thought maybe
[1:28:14] something was wrong
[1:28:17] but i said i you know that really felt
[1:28:19] good to hear him say that
[1:28:23] and uh
[1:28:24] i don't think he even realized that
[1:28:25] maybe if he see the tape you know i told
[1:28:28] charlotte i wasn't gonna say that to him
[1:28:30] but he actually told me he loved me
[1:28:32] and i felt good when he told me he loved
[1:28:34] me
[1:28:35] you know it means a lot to hear somebody
[1:28:37] say they love you
[1:28:39] you know how you think god god feels
[1:28:42] when you tell him you love him have you
[1:28:44] told god you love him lately
[1:28:46] you know
[1:28:47] his brother carl was preaching i was
[1:28:49] thinking also about
[1:28:51] you know that love
[1:28:52] you know the prophet of god was saying i
[1:28:54] said it about a week or so ago the
[1:28:56] prophet of god i was reading something
[1:28:58] he said the church people struggle with
[1:28:59] forgiveness
[1:29:02] he said they struggle with it
[1:29:04] he said he said they run so many people
[1:29:06] away from the church because they won't
[1:29:07] forgive them
[1:29:09] he says instead of instead of rallying
[1:29:12] and everybody rallying together and try
[1:29:14] to restore such a one he said they get
[1:29:16] to talking he said in the way he says
[1:29:18] they get
[1:29:19] going about this and that and he says
[1:29:21] that what does that do run them away he
[1:29:23] said they struggle with forgiveness
[1:29:25] he said the reason why they do because
[1:29:27] they never really experienced it they
[1:29:29] self
[1:29:31] and i believe that with all of my heart
[1:29:34] you know god got to show you yourself
[1:29:37] we see each other all the time but god
[1:29:40] got to show you yourself
[1:29:42] he got to show you how much of a critic
[1:29:44] you are
[1:29:45] and how you see everybody else fault but
[1:29:48] you didn't look you couldn't you
[1:29:50] couldn't look at yourself somebody else
[1:29:53] got to tell you your faults
[1:29:55] or god got to let you look down he got
[1:29:58] to let you look where he brought you
[1:30:00] from
[1:30:01] you know uh from the way down you know i
[1:30:04] always say if he had he had to reach way
[1:30:07] down some of y'all say he had to reach
[1:30:09] down and pick you all up well he had to
[1:30:10] reach 10 times further down to get me up
[1:30:13] but when i think about that forgiveness
[1:30:17] then i said lord
[1:30:19] how can i hold something against anybody
[1:30:21] when what you did for me
[1:30:24] people make mistakes how can i hold it
[1:30:26] against anybody when i know what you did
[1:30:28] for me
[1:30:29] if god would show you a tenth of some of
[1:30:31] the rightness that was in my life come
[1:30:34] on i i wouldn't i'm not even worthy to
[1:30:37] be a a be called a minister of the
[1:30:39] gospel
[1:30:40] but it's a little word called grace
[1:30:44] come on
[1:30:45] the bible says by grace
[1:30:48] are ye saved
[1:30:50] through what faith
[1:30:52] not of works
[1:30:53] i was ministering last week about i was
[1:30:56] talking about martin luther and how
[1:30:58] he did all those rituals working and
[1:31:00] working and working but he come to the
[1:31:02] conclusion that god was so holy you
[1:31:04] could never work enough to please him
[1:31:07] you couldn't work enough to get your way
[1:31:08] into heaven
[1:31:09] he said he he had this thing nagging him
[1:31:12] but then he said when he began to study
[1:31:13] the scriptures then he came up with his
[1:31:15] revelation that the just shall live by
[1:31:18] faith
[1:31:19] he said from there the gates of heaven
[1:31:22] was opened to him
[1:31:23] because he realized that it ain't by
[1:31:26] your works
[1:31:28] but it's in it's by your faith
[1:31:30] and what he already done for you
[1:31:33] come on
[1:31:36] nothing that you can do you can't live
[1:31:38] good enough
[1:31:39] i don't care how how much you come to
[1:31:41] prayer how much you come to church how
[1:31:42] many times you paid you can't live good
[1:31:45] enough
[1:31:46] it's not not of works unless any man
[1:31:48] should boast
[1:31:50] but he came down
[1:31:52] by grace
[1:31:54] you deserve to die come on i deserve to
[1:31:57] die
[1:31:58] and go to hell but what did god do he
[1:32:00] said i'm gonna give i'm gonna extend my
[1:32:02] grace to him the grace
[1:32:05] that he has extended to us
[1:32:07] come on and all we got to do is have
[1:32:09] faith don't you know the accusers
[1:32:11] standing there accusing you but remember
[1:32:14] i ain't got to stand for my own self i'm
[1:32:16] looking at that blood hallelujah the
[1:32:19] blood that was shed for me
[1:32:21] that's what that that's where i'm at

[1:33:04] he says but what you need to get your
[1:33:06] mind on right now it's love
