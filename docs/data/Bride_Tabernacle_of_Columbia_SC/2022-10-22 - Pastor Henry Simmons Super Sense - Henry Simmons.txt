your lamb should be without blemish a male of the first year Hallelujah you should take it out from the sheep and from the goat and ye shall keep it until the 12th month the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel she'll kill it in the evening and praise God it's very important that that that lamb that he says praise God it's got to be without blemish you can't have any blemishes on that land the Lamb of God when he it it can't be in any spots and any blemishes it's got to be holy amen and that's what it's all about holiness Jesus Christ proved himself to be holy amen he proved himself to be without blemish amen and it's something about when God actually asks us to have a church without spot we're not wrinkle and we're not blemish are you with me so the Lamb of God that was slain for us he was without blemish you know what Paula said he said I find no fault a final four and God want to look at the church blessed is the man whom the Lord would not repeat the nicotine and God want to look at us and say I find no soul you know sometimes we the reason why we don't have Victory we reason why things don't happen for us it's not that God find fault in us we find fault in ourselves because he said if you confess your sins he's faith and just to forgive you in the blood of Jesus Christ that blood still works if you confess the blood still works if you confess your sins he's faithful and just to what you see because when your sins are not forgiven you don't find yourself worthy you don't find yourself worthy because you are living in guilt you're too guilty to approach God you could too guilty to believe that God can do what he's saying it's guilt because amen we're afraid to confess our sins but if we confess our sins then the blood of Jesus Christ amen we cleanse us amen the blood still has power to clean if you confess the guilt can go and you can come boldly before the throne of grace and find help in the time of need you can come and approach God Amen not with a guilty conscience but with a pill conscious amen praise God knowing amen that we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous that he's a perpetuation for our sins if we're willing to go to him and tell him about our troubles tell him about our weakness tell him about our fails and we're willing to go to him and be honest with him but we want to put it off on somebody else brother sister other than this one and that one and in the church the preaching somebody but we don't want to look at ourselves I'm guilty of not taking you by the word I'm guilty Lord

clear conscience amen I want to go before God [Music] praise God and accept what he done for me praise God no we're not worried about the lamb is Worthy praise God because he paid the price for you and I praise God he made us Worthy because we're worthy in Christ Jesus so our worthiness is not of ourselves it's because of blood as the lamb took our place praise God the Lamb of God took our place and he let us go free brother sister that's where it is Jesus has taken our place took our guilt took our shame buried our pain are you with me thank you Jesus oh the blood has been applied brother the blood is through an applied sister amen when I see the blood I'll pass over you amen you have what you have what you can't have it when you've got guilty conscious amen when you feel like you're not worthy amen but Worthy is the Lamb that was shed his blood for me that's who I'm trusting he's wearing it I'm not worried but he's worthy for he's made me Worthy because he was made sin for me
