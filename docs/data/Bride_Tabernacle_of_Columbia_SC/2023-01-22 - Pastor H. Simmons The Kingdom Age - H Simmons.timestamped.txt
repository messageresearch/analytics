[42:49] to talk this morning about the kingdom
[42:52] age amen
[42:54] there's an age coming
[42:56] amen that
[42:58] you and I are looking forward to
[43:01] if you're a Christian then you're
[43:03] looking forward to a time where
[43:06] amen
[43:07] got your rule
[43:10] in the Kingdom
[43:12] not only that but he says in Revelation
[43:15] 1 and 6 that he's made you and I Kings
[43:19] and Priests unto God
[43:21] so by the grace of God the kingdom age
[43:25] Jesus talked about I go to prepare a
[43:28] place for you that where I am there you
[43:31] may be also
[43:32] so there's a Time amen and you know I
[43:35] thought about it this morning serving
[43:37] the lord will pay off
[43:40] I don't care what the devil can offer
[43:42] you in this life but serving God will
[43:45] pay off
[43:46] praise God the devil can offer you a
[43:48] little bit of this and a little bit of
[43:50] that but it's not worth it amen
[43:53] when I talk about the kingdom age and
[43:55] I'm talking about the Millennium Reign
[43:57] the 1000 Years where amen it should be
[44:01] peace on the earth amen man is trying to
[44:05] achieve it with all the U.N and the
[44:09] European cancer and all the different
[44:11] people trying to come together for World
[44:14] Peace but yet there would be no peace
[44:17] the Bible says in Thessalonians when
[44:19] they said Peace and safety then sudden
[44:21] Destruction come in
[44:23] so here we are at the time where men is
[44:26] trying with all their uh trying and
[44:29] everything all that means they cannot
[44:32] achieve peace why because the devil amen
[44:36] he don't want peace amen he said God is
[44:39] not the author of confusion as long as
[44:42] you have a few confusion the devil is
[44:45] satisfied
[44:47] but God is not the odds of confusion but
[44:49] a peace
[44:51] and when one rejects the Prince of Peace
[44:55] then we would have no peace
[44:57] because the one that came to give us
[44:59] peace they rejected the Prince of Peace
[45:02] amen
[45:03] he's the prince of peace and everlasting
[45:06] father amen
[45:07] praise God they rejected him when he
[45:10] came amen
[45:12] he said my peace I give you not is the
[45:15] world give now I want to talk about the
[45:17] Kingdom of Egypt when we talk about
[45:19] Kingdom
[45:20] um
[45:21] we know that God comes to establish his
[45:24] kingdom
[45:25] and then when John the Baptist came he
[45:28] said I'm the voice and one crying in the
[45:30] wilderness prepare you the way of the
[45:32] Lord make straight in the desert a
[45:33] highway for our God now he came to say
[45:37] repent in Matthew 3
[45:40] he said repent for the Kingdom of Heaven
[45:43] is at hand
[45:45] now he came now where there's a kingdom
[45:48] then there must be a king
[45:51] are you a man
[45:52] and now pilot declared that Jesus Christ
[45:55] was the king of the Jews
[45:58] and Jesus declared my kingdom is not of
[46:02] this world
[46:04] are you with me
[46:06] yet I I want you to see that amen you
[46:10] have something to look forward to
[46:13] amen you God Amen if you wait patiently
[46:18] amen God has prepared a place for you
[46:23] and I
[46:24] but what it is the devil would do
[46:27] everything to bombard your mind and mess
[46:31] up your life amen he would do everything
[46:34] to deter you and to try to get you to
[46:38] displease what Jesus is saying
[46:41] and that's what happens by Nature we
[46:44] were born in sin shaping and iniquity
[46:46] and the word of God Amen it just seemed
[46:49] like this old flesh this old pest house
[46:52] amen it don't wanna uh you know a
[46:55] knowledge that God Amen is amen worth
[46:59] worshiping
[47:01] amen because this old pass house wants
[47:04] you to aim at the feed your flesh and
[47:06] desires of the flesh
[47:09] amen praise God the devil wants to give
[47:12] you amen what's going to satisfy you
[47:15] only temporarily he gives you a pacifier
[47:18] you're not getting the real thing
[47:21] and people fall for the devil's schemes
[47:24] and the devil tricked and amen their
[47:28] succumb and the devil actually put them
[47:30] in the bondage and in traps and snares
[47:34] of the devil

[1:13:27] you know
[1:13:29] why the people believe the lie that the
[1:13:33] devil telling them

[1:13:40] the truth
[1:13:41] are you with me
[1:13:45] do you know
[1:13:47] God knows them that he hears
[1:13:50] he knows each and every one of his
[1:13:52] children
[1:13:54] and you know some folk I just come to
[1:13:57] the conclusion
[1:13:58] some folk just don't want God
[1:14:01] they just don't want to be saved
[1:14:05] some folk just want to be big and bad
[1:14:08] and act up
[1:14:09] and they love the devil and then even
[1:14:12] though they know
[1:14:14] than an eight foot Four Season
[1:14:18] but I'm talking about the kingdom age
[1:14:21] can I get into that just for the next
[1:14:23] few minutes the kingdom age
[1:14:26] God has a kingdom
[1:14:29] and that Kingdom
[1:14:30] is for his children let's go back to
[1:14:33] Revelation 20 and uh
[1:14:40] y'all got quiet but we got to get quiet
[1:14:44] because I don't want the devil to take
[1:14:46] that away from you
[1:14:48] you know when you sell out
[1:14:50] if you live to be 70 80 years old 1900
[1:14:56] what about
[1:14:58] if you had an opportunity to
[1:15:01] and I gave you
[1:15:03] a hundred dollars
[1:15:06] and I said well
[1:15:08] you can have this hundred day
[1:15:11] but if you wait a little while
[1:15:14] I give you a thousand
[1:15:19] you know some folks I want what I can
[1:15:21] have with
[1:15:23] right now hunted in my hand
[1:15:26] is better than the thousand
[1:15:30] that I can't see
[1:15:35] and see they want their hundred and
[1:15:38] that's what the people want the devil
[1:15:39] now
[1:15:41] because I can't see God
[1:15:46] so I can't see him so I give me what I
[1:15:49] can see
[1:15:50] and I can put in my hand give me
[1:15:53] what I can feel
[1:15:56] what's going to make me happy right now
[1:15:58] in this life
[1:16:00] give me what I want you know the young
[1:16:03] man say father give me all the blown to
[1:16:06] me and he went out and spent all
[1:16:09] right she's living
[1:16:12] find himself in the world
[1:16:14] the pig pen isn't that right
[1:16:18] and that's what the devil would do he'll
[1:16:20] get you
[1:16:21] you give it to you now
[1:16:23] but he know where you're going to end up
[1:16:25] at
[1:16:26] in the pig pen
[1:16:28] and when you're in the pig pen you're
[1:16:30] gonna think about what you had
[1:16:33] in your father's house
[1:16:36] are you with me
[1:16:38] but it won't be to your eyes if your eye
[1:16:41] at that young man I wouldn't open he
[1:16:43] would have ate the slop out the pig pen
[1:16:49] you know the devil can take you kind of
[1:16:51] low
[1:16:52] he can put you down so low
[1:16:55] that you eat the slop
[1:16:58] out of the pig pen
[1:17:01] some folk act like they ain't got sense
[1:17:04] enough
[1:17:07] you didn't take the little hammer and
[1:17:09] hit them side the head they got sense
[1:17:12] enough to believe what God Said
[1:17:15] Lord have mercy
[1:17:17] I wish I could get some sense in the
[1:17:19] people that they can believe what God
[1:17:20] Said
[1:17:22] the devil lying to you
[1:17:26] can you tell somebody next to you the
[1:17:28] devil will tell you a lie in a minute
[1:17:31] because you ain't nothing but a liar
[1:17:35] he'll tell you he can make you happy and
[1:17:37] make you feel good but you know that
[1:17:39] feeling is a lie
[1:17:41] because it ain't gonna last
[1:17:44] what do you give you you're gonna make
[1:17:45] you want some money
[1:17:47] he gets you addicted and hook
[1:17:50] and you're gonna keep on running back I
[1:17:51] need a little bit more
[1:17:53] anything the devil give you won't
[1:17:55] satisfy
[1:17:57] when God give you to you
[1:18:00] amen that peace that Joy ain't nothing
[1:18:04] nothing the devil gives you can
[1:18:07] matches
[1:18:08] and that's why somebody said well I
[1:18:10] tried serving the lord I tried being a
[1:18:13] Christian but it didn't work for me
[1:18:19] that's because
[1:18:23] see sometimes we ain't surrendered all
[1:18:25] and we think we've surrendered all we
[1:18:28] just went through the motion
[1:18:30] we went through the motion with God and
[1:18:32] we thought we really knew God
[1:18:34] you know how many people thought they
[1:18:36] knew God
[1:18:38] and then they ended up saying well I
[1:18:40] knew the law a long long time ago oh
[1:18:43] Lord
[1:18:44] I don't know nothing that would cause me
[1:18:47] since I started
[1:18:49] as a young man to 70 years old ain't
[1:18:53] nothing that I saw
[1:18:55] that would make me want to turn from God
[1:19:01] I wouldn't trade nothing for God
[1:19:05] nothing that the devil or the world can
[1:19:08] offer me to make me exchange it for the
[1:19:12] love of God
[1:19:14] I know the love of God and Means
[1:19:17] Everything
[1:19:18] when you love God and he loves you know
[1:19:21] he loves you
[1:19:22] you would trade nothing for that love
[1:19:26] because his love ain't nobody else can
[1:19:29] treat you like that
[1:19:34] his love is so above I can't even
[1:19:37] explain the love of God
[1:19:39] and what God you know what's what what
[1:19:42] kept me
[1:19:44] is the love of God
[1:19:46] knowing that my father loved me that
[1:19:49] kept me through the years I've been
[1:19:52] camped because of the love of God
[1:19:55] because God you know the Bible said he
[1:19:58] so loved the world and he became a
[1:20:01] reality to me
[1:20:03] it's the love of God that delivered me
[1:20:06] from
[1:20:06] my sins and all the filth and rotten
[1:20:09] stuff that I've done
[1:20:11] but it was the love of God that Set Me
[1:20:13] Free from that
[1:20:15] to know that he forgave me
[1:20:18] and know that he comes in my life and
[1:20:21] makes me a new creature
[1:20:25] sometimes you walk down the street and
[1:20:27] you want to hold your head now but you
[1:20:29] can hold your head up
[1:20:31] because you know you've forgiven
[1:20:34] man might not never forgive you
[1:20:39] but you know the heavenly father has
[1:20:40] forgiven you
[1:20:43] man might forever look down on you
[1:20:46] but you know the heavenly father you
[1:20:48] just said your sins and Nicholas will I
[1:20:50] remember no more
[1:20:51] to know that God can forgive and forget
[1:20:54] about what you've done
[1:20:57] it means everything
[1:21:01] who wouldn't serve a god like this I
[1:21:04] thought I could get to the kingdom age
[1:21:05] but I I can't get there
[1:21:07] but there's a kingdom
[1:21:10] that God has given you
[1:21:12] maybe I just read the 24 first chapter
[1:21:15] it says and John said I saw a new Heaven
[1:21:18] and a new Earth for the first heaven and
[1:21:20] first Samuel to pass away and there was
[1:21:22] no more sin now John saw the holy city
[1:21:24] New Jerusalem coming down from God out
[1:21:28] of heaven
[1:21:29] prepared as a bride are known for her
[1:21:31] husband
[1:21:32] I want to tell you the streets are paid
[1:21:35] with gold
[1:21:38] amen
[1:21:40] when you talk about
[1:21:43] the sapphire
[1:21:45] the Diamonds the rubies
[1:21:48] the embryos and all the precious stone
[1:21:53] in that City
[1:21:57] the devil cannot match it
[1:22:00] you try to make love Las Vegas like it
[1:22:04] try to take the islands and to try to
[1:22:06] beautify them and make them enticing
[1:22:10] Hawaii and different places
[1:22:14] but I did not seen
[1:22:16] Heir have not heard
[1:22:19] but why you let the devil ah I go lay up
[1:22:24] or not go to the mouth and I go to the
[1:22:27] beach
[1:22:27] the Beast and I go there
[1:22:33] I'll tell you so don't let the devil
[1:22:34] fool you
[1:22:37] are you with me
[1:22:38] what he's offering you just
[1:22:41] Allah
[1:22:43] the biggest lie that he can tell you
[1:22:46] all this that I give to you
[1:22:49] but it's not
[1:22:51] he not giving it to you unless you were
[1:22:54] bow down and what
[1:22:57] are you with me
[1:22:59] somebody said I never worship the devil
[1:23:01] but the only way you're getting what the
[1:23:04] devil giving you is you up
[1:23:06] hang on give you nothing for nothing
[1:23:09] you're gonna have to worship the devil
[1:23:11] to get what he got
[1:23:14] are you with me
[1:23:16] and when God gave you his Spirit you
[1:23:18] worship him because he gives you his
[1:23:20] Spirit isn't that right
[1:23:21] so the devil gives you his anointing his
[1:23:24] demons and his power to worship him and
[1:23:28] to give him honor and you can't give him
[1:23:31] no glory he ain't got no glory
[1:23:35] he wants you to respect and honor him
[1:23:38] the devil is not going to give you what
[1:23:41] he got for nothing he wants your soul
[1:23:44] are you with me
[1:23:46] and if you're alive the devil to deceive
[1:23:48] you is because you want to be deceived
[1:23:51] the prophet of God said if we are
[1:23:54] deceived and we're willfully disease
[1:23:57] is not because we don't know no better
[1:24:00] we know but we refuse
[1:24:03] the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:24:06] so there's no excuse
[1:24:09] Lord I didn't know no better you knew
[1:24:11] better you willfully
[1:24:14] you willfully reject the Gospel of Jesus
[1:24:17] Christ you said I don't want Jesus I
[1:24:20] don't want him he said this my blood
[1:24:23] that was shedded for you for your sins
[1:24:25] you can accept me and I'll give you I'll
[1:24:27] make you a new creature
[1:24:30] I give you eternal life
[1:24:35] I want what I what the devil is offering
[1:24:37] me right now
[1:24:43] I wish I could take and do something
[1:24:46] with the ears
[1:24:49] and if you could only hear
[1:24:52] then it'll make a difference in your
[1:24:54] life
[1:24:55] but do you know what the devil does
[1:24:58] some kind of way here
[1:25:00] it blocks
[1:25:02] I remember being a young person
[1:25:05] and you don't have to be young you can
[1:25:07] be old
[1:25:08] the devil can block you
[1:25:10] you can block you
[1:25:14] and when God is trying to talk to you
[1:25:15] the devil can block you
[1:25:18] and he can keep blocking and blocking
[1:25:22] but it's something's got to Rise Up In
[1:25:24] You
[1:25:27] and you got something got to Rise Up In
[1:25:29] You
[1:25:30] and some got to want
[1:25:33] I want change in my life
[1:25:37] I want to be a Christian
[1:25:40] it's got to be a willing mind
[1:25:43] whosoever
[1:25:45] will
[1:25:47] let him come
[1:25:49] there's got to be something that you
[1:25:50] want
[1:25:54] the devil
[1:25:55] you ain't got to want it the devil or
[1:25:57] what
[1:25:58] he'll try to force you
[1:26:01] try to make you feel so bad if you don't
[1:26:04] do it you're in Squire you lame you this
[1:26:08] you that
[1:26:10] you come on man come on the devil will
[1:26:13] make you God ain't gonna put no pressure
[1:26:15] on you
[1:26:17] ain't put no pressure on you why
[1:26:20] when you know you got it
[1:26:23] ain't no pressure
[1:26:26] Jesus know who he is
[1:26:28] and he know that the devil don't have no
[1:26:31] matter what he's offered
[1:26:33] are you with me so he could just wait
[1:26:37] try everything you want to try
[1:26:40] but at the end it ain't gonna do you no
[1:26:42] good
[1:26:44] so you might as well wake up now
[1:26:49] because at the end you're gonna find out
[1:26:52] I should have
[1:26:55] I should have listened
[1:26:57] I should have come to Jesus
[1:27:01] the father got in the shape that I'm in
[1:27:04] I should have
[1:27:06] surrendered my life before I got into
[1:27:09] condition
[1:27:13] are you
[1:27:16] I know each and every one of us I regret
[1:27:18] every day I lived in sin
[1:27:22] I regret every year I lived at the
[1:27:24] center
[1:27:26] I wish I would listen to Mama
[1:27:30] I wish I would have listened to the
[1:27:31] preacher

[1:27:36] why because when I have now
[1:27:40] as far better than what I had out there
[1:27:44] in that world

[1:28:27] thousand years
