where we forget about everything and we worship Jesus Christ uh the King of Kings this morning so we appreciate you again we thank you for your love and your grace if you would stand with me this morning I'd like to go into a couple of places uh in the scriptures to lay the foundation for uh the message are you ready for the word and I'm just going to let the Lord have his way in this meeting today in and speak to you from from my heart and as the spirit of the Lord will give me unction this morning in the Book of Psalms chapter 1 18. and verses 22. okay now you understand that David is speaking now prophetically spirit of God has struck his innermost being and he's groaning under the inspiration and the anointing of the Holy Spirit and he cried out the stones which the builder refused has become The Headstone of the corner this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes I want you to watch that carefully Matthew chapter 21 beginning in verses 33 please if you have it say Amen what a blessing to be able to turn the scriptures and go right into the word of God here are not a parable there was a certain household which planted a Vineyard in a head Stitch round about and digged a VIN wine prestonage and built a tower and led it out to a husbandman and went into a far country and when the time of the fruit Drew near he sent the servant to the husbandman that he might receive the fruit of it and the husband took his servant and beat one and killed another and stoned another and again he sent another servant more than the first and they did unto him likewise At Last of all he sent unto them his son saying they will not Revenge my son but when the husband saw the son they said among themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and let us cease on the inheritance I want you to notice now that this this Parable is is very profound because it is portraying what God is doing in the last days he's portraying a people in this age that is out in the world that is filled with violence filled with uncertainties filled with a number of uh uh corruption agenda but I believe that there's a people that is sent in this age that will overcome overcome everything I believe that has been anointed and sent to destroy them right and I believe it's the Church of the Living God go down to Isaiah as I laid a foundation I want to make sure is that it's very secure we've read this the first night I minister Isaiah 53 and verses 3. he is despised and rejected a man a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief we did hit as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him a notch first Peter and then we'll be seated well How Sweet It Is to trust in Jesus and to take him out his word second Peter 2 verses 5. our first Peter rather first Peter two I'm sorry he also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices accepted to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded what a scripture aren't you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which uh be disobedient the stone which the builders disallow the stone is made the head of the corner a stone of stumbling a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient unto also they were appointed where unto also they were appointed but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood hallelujah holy nation A peculiar people that he should show Force the Praises of him who had called you out of Darkness unto this marvelous light I wonder this morning that you may have a need if you'll just slip your hands up to God our heavenly father we come before you this morning we just want to thank you for your Amazing Grace we thank you for the fellowship that we feel today in the love divine we pray God that your sweet holy spirit will move across this congregation this morning and every need might be matched every hands that were lifted every sick will leave this billing holds those that are struggling internally will be healed by the power of the spoken word have your way in this meeting Lord bless the word as we now Venture into the scriptures Lord in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the church says amen God bless you you may be seated I like to pull from these scriptures this morning a thought in a brother Isaiah saying the song that was a confirmation in my spirits to come up into the perfect word I believe that we live in an un imperfect world a religious world that's filled with ideology in theology man's Concepts traditions and religion but I believe in the midst of all of this that's that God has called out a people that is separated from all people of the land we are like the Israelites coming out of Egypt we are not like the Egyptians we're not of this world we can't seem to into society culture cannot capture Vape our minds and calls up to be conformed to their ideologies we are different we are a misfit in this Society we live in the world that somehow we feel that we somehow cannot blend into this dimension and this is because that there is a higher Dimension another form a theophany word Dimension that is trying to call us of voice that is calling us we try our best just to be a part of everything on the job with our families in our church in our societies how many of you as have went on to a job interview and somehow you didn't get the job and you received an email we thank you for the interview however you know when they say however you didn't get the job you didn't sits the criteria of what we were looking for you see the world is looking for a certain type of fish and the church is looking for a certain type of fit but somehow you can't fit in some of you hear you uh when growing up you you somehow came up into a family to where about Misfortune perhaps some of you don't know who your daddy is who your mama was you are put out on the streets some of you have had a background that's uh you would not even want to even talk about and excuse me for maybe going back into those paths just for a moment but I want to build on something to say your rejections you were rejected shh and I want to speak this morning on the rejected stones the rejected stones that did not fit in those that somehow can just be a part of everything that was going on there was a reason behind it you are a rejected Stone came out of the lines of God just give me a little moment here let me build and I'll preach to you Amen on the rejected stones in a message the prophet said in my travels I find that's it is the rejected stones that keeps the billing uh being fit together it's always the rejected shh it has always been the rejected it has always been those kinds that God somehow lay his hand upon their lives when you try to run from it when you try to forget it when you try to drug it out and you try to drink it out and you try to prostitute it out and you did everything in your life tried to drive that out somehow there was something there you know Jesus was rejected shh and it came from the most unlikely socialists he knew life he knew all about you what it feels like to be rejected yes he knows the life of an unjust a rejection he knows the pain and hurts caused by rejection from unlikely sources we've seen John 1 and 11 the Bible said he came to his own and his own received them notch I will speak to you in a moment I want to tell you that God's got a purpose for your life Hallelujah you might be rejected shh you might not fit in but you see the stone that the business rejected will become the Capstone in the states [Applause] Jesus is rejected by his own people rejected uh continually Jesus rejections continues throughout his ministry and I'm thoroughly studying for gospels right now and I noticed that in every campaign that Jesus had that they seem to be this battle of rejection against him and every meeting that he went into he felt the power of that rejection on the bulk of his rejection came from the unlikely sources those that claim to be the religious people of his day is she the religious people of Jesus day rejected him they failed to see that he was the Chief Cornerstone their eyes could not recognize the Christ unveiled before them but God had blinded their eyes that you and I can have eyes that we see today I believe they failed to see that he was that Cornerstone and I want to say today that God's elected our Lively stones rejected stones Revelation stones and for Century back these stones have been rejected and overlooked by the religious you know our persecution doesn't come from the unbelievers and comes from the religious those in a ranks those in our searches indulging our affiliations pillow somebody for centuries we have seen this pattern Moses was rejected by his own brethren cast aside but he had a message of Deliverance I want to say to you this morning it doesn't matter what you're facing What opposition is against you God has raised you up in your community and your family in your marriage young people hear me that you will be a deliverer you see the stone that was rejected became the Cornerstone of an exodus it was that religious system that was holding the people in bondage it was the religious pharaohs of those days that kept the people enslaved in their minds but it wasn't a rejected one that brought an exodus oh to those that did not look like much that did not have much that did not seem to fit in that a society that was around them they were the rejected Stone as Moses was but he led an exodus are you with me now you see Moses grew up in the wilderness was a rejected people down in Egypt beaten down under slavery Pharaoh looking out of this window and seeing the Israelites as nothing but you my Dabber they were seemed to have no value in their lives this is how Satan views us some time well does he realize that down side there's a germ seed that comes from God [Applause] so wonderful how Moses looked out of the same window and saw the same people as Lively stones of God those humor have been rejected cast out looked upon with shame and disgrace but yet God said I see purpose in their lives yes all Pharaoh saw was defeats Rejects but praise God Moses Moses saw victory instead of people who was once enslaved I became the head over all Israel led by the pitifier every saying God had in his plan and purpose was coming to a masterpiece manifestation and Joseph was rejected by his own Brethren is that correct his life types Christ in every aspect is seven color coats represents seven colors in a rainbow which was a covenant oh the Butcher and the baker one was refused and one was rejected like the two thieves on the cross and when he was dying make mention that his bones be taken out of Egypt a type of Christ leaving an empty tomb as an Evidence of his resurrection Joseph was given a gentile bride I'm laying the foundation to talk to your church Jesus after rejected by the Jews received a gentile bride prophesied by Jacob and the blessing of Joseph's two sons Ephraim and Manasseh he crossed his hand and the blessing went from the eldest to the youngest and some of you here you might be wondering what God is doing it looked like the pit you're in you'll never get out of it it looked like you'll never walk again Shout again Dance Again Pray Again be healed again but God's gonna run across his hands come on somebody I was gonna run across his hands Hallelujah and the blessing is coming your way praise God Joseph being the rejected Stone became the answer to his Brethren's cry in the time of a great drought you see God had used him to store our food I want to say today even though we are the rejected Stones we have a spiritual food in due season I'm coming back hold it I'm coming back just on the thoughts Hallelujah David was a rejected King these thrown and went up over the hills weeping over Jerusalem Hallelujah his own people the Bible will tell us ran them off of the throne listen pastors I'm singing you this

Hallelujah and you're going to leave with your salmon you're gonna leave with your spiritual hustling the revelation of the Third Exodus this is the weight of your matter you believe that this is a way to your matter French this is not like stuff I'm talking about this is the weighty stuff I'm talking of the secret Rapture of the Bride understand now just give me a few moments amen Moses in the consolation of the pillar fire on Mount Sinai that's the consolation of seven angels in a cloud revealing Sanders of Revelation and rapturing face to the bride of Christ you believe that uses that already start breaking the seals of Mount Sinai Hallelujah seven angels had already pre-facing what they will do in this last age as he was caught up in the consolation of angels of what he sought that he was designing the natural Tabernacle but God was pre-facing the future home of the Earthly bride and the Heavenly bridegroom you believe it something you look at me funny what do you think that Moses was doing there and the consolation of angels God was revealing the secret message to him the Rapture messaged to him all right I know you want to quote unveiling of God Amen and the pit of fire appearing this for me amongst us identifying the message that's right like you did among Sinai remember before the true message came forth Moses preached and led them out of Egypt but there before the real Commandments was laid down Seven Seals brought in God came down before the people and proved that Moses was sent from him that's rights and the pill fire that Moses said yet it's seen the bush and talk to him Moses was receiving the anointing of the Rapture message to bring the people over only that his face and this time will come to an end on the Joshua anoint you will come in he'll take the bride over into canaan's land you believe it's the seven Thunders reveal in the Seven Seals is the bill rapturing says are you with me listen I I ask God for my healing every day I ask God for my family every day I've got a son two daughters praise God hallelujah I'm believing I know by God's grace they'll be in the Rapture I've got six grandchildren now I ask God for their

message for you rejected Stones I got something to tell you your families your loved ones coming your brother's coming your end is coming your husband shall return spilling faith but then God's taking us up not a face down it's called ratcheting face is your life worthy of the Gospel the Third Exodus is when the same pin of fire takes the bride from the church you believe it's the same feeling of fire that was free faced in the seventh seed under that message will Rapture the church shh not for everybody not for everybody [Applause] not for everybody only rejected stones the revelations in the seventh sonder which is the voice of God reveals to the bride the secrets of rapturing face seven thunders of Revelation may show the bride how to prepare for the great translation face fossil don't get them quote on me some of you thinking that seven Thunders that's your message do you know what the seven Thunders are the rapture y'all getting quiet or if somebody says seven virtues all this

Thunders that's not even written at all that's right I believe that through those seven Thunders will be revealed in the last day in order to get the bride together for rapturing face why do you think Moses was rejected he was part of this Choir Hallelujah because God was pre-facing through him and God showed the rejection All Through Time as he's showing it now amen praise God you believe it's oh praise God revealing to the bride the Seven Seals of Stripes Seven Thunders is the voice of God with a rapturing message Revelation 10 the mighty angel came down when a shout sander the shout is a

listen I'm talking to rejected Stones now stay with me now stay with me I'm going home soon but I gotta tell you this God told me before you go back to Tennessee tell the church something they are the rejected stones you believe it they are the rejected Stones I'm not speaking about the seven written seals now amen I just mentioned that amen the Antichrist spirit that Ministry to the Jews amen but I'm bringing you up now to the backside of the book where the Revelation is amen the messages has been preached on the anointing of the Holy Ghost who is this Mel cassador choosing of a branch recognizing your day and this message the future home of the Earthly bride and the Heavenly bridegroom Hallelujah I like to say it this way men of the Brethren like to preach the message on the open book I'd like to say I preached the open and closed book because you see on the back side of the book there was something else written there for I rejected people in this h are you with me now they weren't even written on the inside they were written on the outside why because it was a revelation that the prophet was bringing seeing what Moses was doing [Music] come on Church then the Bible said that they don't know what happened to Moses Moses was was buried I don't even know where his body is you know what because the spirits connected shh the spirit of Moses connected with the spirit I mean Elijah and this dispensation that continue on the Rapture fulfillments are the rejected Church of this age Church systems cannot all us brother Brooks you love them Hallelujah seven unknown Thunders that's not written in the book the back side of the book is the weightier matter Hallelujah this is what Jesus was telling the the Saints there Amen in the Gospels he said you give your tithes and your uh your fruits and your herbs but you neglect the weight of your matter Hallelujah of law mercy and Grace what law was to the Israelites is what the Seven Seals are to the bride hello Church hallelujah hallelujah praise God we've been given mercies amen we've been given Mercy in this age amen by the opening of the word of God you believe it we've been given mercy and we've been given Grace amen because there are some people in this age that's been given a special Grace don't do it again yes sir I gotta close I gotta close but overcoming power comes through hearing the revelation of the word for your day everybody's saying waiting that's weighty that's heavy stuff that's like what them sisters cook back here amen fat back and biscuits and gravy sausage and bacon they'll stick to your rib come on Church I hear and recognizing and acting on the body word of the son of man the bride is now eating on the Tree of Life Christ the reveal worship headed back to the midst of paradise fully restore the Eden again this is only for the bride but I say we need a prophet circumcision to cut out all the man-made religion I want you to remember at the time of the revealing of the open book The Seven Seals uh what happened to Sabino Kenya a sword appeared in the prophet hand and they said I just fit my hand just exactly come on preachers come on preachers it's not your revelation God's already given us a revelation we can't add to it or take to it it fit one man's hand and fit in one man's hand and he said the saber Blaze was so long and it was like razor sharp and he said this was the king's sword this was the king's sword I believe it was a time the circumcise of people that possess their inheritance you see the sword of the word Ascot the bride out of mixed multitudes that follow the message and the bride is the rejected completes in a rejection completes the Pyramid of the rapture this is our time the Seven Seas everybody say with me there's no mystery no mystery Seven Seals literal literal Seven Seals for its second third three Arts Riders Antichrist spirits amen fourth fifth sixth Ministries to the Jews did the same thing and then the Seven Seals bring him back to Earth the written seals when you hear don't don't climb up on the inside oh what are you talking about I'm talking about the bride and the sage let me clear up your
