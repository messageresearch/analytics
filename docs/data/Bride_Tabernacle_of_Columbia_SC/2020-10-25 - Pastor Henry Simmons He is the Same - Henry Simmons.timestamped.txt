[38:25] the book of hebrews 13 chapter
[38:28] first verse
[38:36] god is so good
[38:40] he says let brotherly love continually
[38:43] continue not forgetful they understand
[38:47] entertain strangers
[38:50] well thereby some entertain
[38:53] angels unawares
[38:57] remember them that are in bounds
[39:01] as bound with them and then which suffer
[39:05] adversities as being yourself
[39:08] also in the body marriage is honorable
[39:13] and all in the bed under fire
[39:18] but whole mongols and adulterers god
[39:20] will judge
[39:22] let your conversation be without
[39:24] coverages
[39:27] and be content with such things
[39:30] as ye have for he has said
[39:34] i would never leave thee not for safety
[39:39] so that we may boldly say
[39:42] the lord is my hepar and i will not
[39:47] fear what man should do
[39:50] unto me remember them which
[39:53] have rule over you who have spoken
[39:57] unto you the word of god whose faith
[40:00] follow
[40:01] consider the end of their conversation
[40:06] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[40:09] and forever
[40:11] god bless during his word you may be
[40:12] seated
[40:15] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[40:18] and forever i want to talk this morning
[40:24] concerning he's the same he is the same
[40:29] amen god identifies himself by his own
[40:33] characteristics
[40:36] what he was he is now
[40:41] what it was yesterday he is today
[40:46] hebrews put it in the words jesus christ
[40:49] the same yesterday
[40:51] and today and forever
[40:54] so jesus christ is the same he is the
[40:57] same
[40:59] the book of moderate
[41:04] three
[41:10] and 6. for it says
[41:13] for he says for i am the lord
[41:19] and i what and i change
[41:23] not for i am the lord and i change
[41:27] not
[41:30] god does not change his mind about his
[41:33] word
[41:35] god does not change you don't have to
[41:38] change
[41:39] why we change but god don't have to
[41:42] change
[41:43] because whatsoever god do it is perfect
[41:46] it's perfect in itself
[41:50] so he don't have to add to it or take
[41:53] away from it
[41:55] and that's what he said don't add to my
[41:57] word don't take away from my word
[42:00] are you with me because the word of the
[42:03] lord shall stand
[42:05] heaven and earth are passed away but my
[42:07] word
[42:09] it'll stand are you with me
[42:13] so the word of god is sure steadfast
[42:16] you can anchor your soul in the word
[42:21] and he's the same brother and sister
[42:29] what you get
[42:33] from being a christian or
[42:38] and what it means to you and i
[42:41] to be a christian
[42:46] to be a christian is the state for a
[42:49] fact that i
[42:50] am a part of god
[42:58] and i said he is the same
[43:02] the same god
[43:06] the bible tells us in saint john 1 1 in
[43:10] the beginning
[43:11] was the word isn't that right
[43:15] the word was with god in the word was
[43:18] god
[43:22] amen in the beginning
[43:28] that's when time started
[43:33] but god is eternal he's not
[43:37] limited to space
[43:41] he's not limited to time he's eternal
[43:45] so before the beginning before
[43:48] time as we say
[43:52] god the eternal god always existed
[43:58] amen jesus said i

[52:21] ghost
[52:22] to quicken the word to bring it to life
[52:25] amen praise god and if the word is in
[52:28] you
