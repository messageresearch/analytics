[37:32] In The Name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[37:34] and
[37:36] amen want to look at the Book of Job
[37:39] tonight Job 1 by the grace of God and
[37:43] six very familiar familiar scripture
[37:45] amen try not to be long tonight Job 1
[37:49] and6
[38:00] you got it say
[38:01] amen and it reads now there was a day
[38:06] when the sons of God came and came to
[38:09] present themselves before the Lord and
[38:12] Satan came also among them and the Lord
[38:14] said unto Satan whence comest thou then
[38:17] Satan answered the Lord and said from
[38:19] going to and fro in the earth and
[38:22] walking up and down in it and the Lord
[38:24] said unto Satan hast thou considered my
[38:26] servant Jo that there is none like him
[38:29] in the earth a perfect and upright man
[38:32] one that fearth God and is trueth evil
[38:35] then Satan answered the Lord and said
[38:38] does job fear God for not has not Thou
[38:42] made an hedge about him and about his
[38:45] house and about all that he have on
[38:47] every side that thou H has blessed the
[38:50] work of his hands and his substance is
[38:52] increased in the land but put forth
[38:55] thine hand now and touch all that he
[38:57] hath and he will curse thee to thy face
[39:00] and the Lord said unto Satan behold all
[39:04] that he hath is in thy power only upon
[39:07] himself put not forth thine hand so
[39:10] Satan went from the presence of the Lord
[39:13] may God is blessed to the reading of his
[39:15] word tonight may be
[39:17] seated we want to minister just for a
[39:20] moment on a little topic and I I
[39:22] entitled it the Hedge
[39:24] amen the Hedge it's little something
[39:26] that the Lord
[39:28] you know put on my heart when we're
[39:31] talking about a hedge you know how how
[39:34] Satan told God here in this place he
[39:36] says you know job is only serving you
[39:40] because you got a hedge around him he
[39:43] says not only do you got a hedge around
[39:46] him but all of his house and everything
[39:48] around him and everything he touched
[39:50] you're blessing and that's the only
[39:52] reason why he's serving you so you know
[39:56] look at a hedge a hedge is is something
[39:58] like a boundaries you know or or or the
[40:01] fence that's put up to keep things out
[40:05] so I was thinking about that here the
[40:07] devil here is even testifying that I
[40:11] can't come near job because of
[40:12] boundaries that you got around them and
[40:15] I thought about that you know even in
[40:18] our individual lives that's what I going
[40:20] to title tonight the Hedge in our
[40:23] individual lives you know we're on we're
[40:26] unconscious sometimes we just go about
[40:28] our daily business but not thinking
[40:31] about the Hedge that God has around us
[40:34] you know and and in that like we says in
[40:37] that hedge it to realize that the devil
[40:41] can't come near you he's got boundaries
[40:43] amen that he can't do but so much to you
[40:46] am because of the Lord got a hedge
[40:48] around you and I begin thinking about
[40:51] that you know one day I was in prayer
[40:54] last week and I said Lord I think I
[40:57] thank you for the Hedge that you put
[40:59] around us you know what the devil does
[41:02] is he Bluffs and tries to get you to
[41:03] come from behind what fortifying you
[41:07] then he can have his way with you but
[41:09] other than that here he is testifying
[41:11] that I can't do nothing because you
[41:13] protecting them hallelujah amen and I
[41:16] thought about that I said God you know
[41:18] just thinking Lord thank you for your
[41:20] protection we're so unconscious of just
[41:23] how good God is to us amen amen of the
[41:26] the Bible you know was I was thinking I
[41:28] said you know sometimes you know uh uh
[41:31] he what he was implying that you know
[41:34] job is only serving you because of I
[41:36] can't get near him but if I can get near
[41:38] him you know I'll he I'll make
[41:41] him curse you to your face come on but
[41:45] God had confidence in Job that job ain't
[41:47] serving me for that I'm blessing job
[41:50] because I know what's in job's heart job
[41:52] going to serve me through the good and
[41:54] through the bad job going he he going to
[41:57] maintain like they say his Integrity
[41:59] through all he's going to maintain this
[42:02] integrity that's why I'm blessing him
[42:04] because I know what's in his heart and I
[42:07] thank God that a lot of times you know
[42:09] everything we do sometimes the way it
[42:11] looks might not come out right but God
[42:14] has the ability to look beyond what the
[42:17] natural eyes can see and that's what
[42:20] stumbles Men A lot of times because of
[42:23] sometimes God blesses the most unlikely
[42:25] of people or God protects and watches
[42:28] over the most unlikely of people but
[42:30] that's because God is looking at
[42:32] something that you and I can't
[42:34] see what he's looking at a lot of times
[42:36] is the the seed that he planted before
[42:38] the world even
[42:40] began come on and he knew that one day
[42:43] the light would flash across that seed
[42:45] and you'd be quickened and you'd come
[42:47] until what he ordained you to be before
[42:49] the foundation of the
[42:51] world that's why he told I believe
[42:54] Jeremiah at one place he says to him he
[42:56] said says don't say you're a child he
[42:58] says because this day before you was

[45:18] angels to come near y'all believe that
[45:20] tonight come on we're unconscious of the
[45:24] spirit realm what's going on around us
[45:25] but what God has got to do is make us
[45:28] conscious of that Hallelujah and when he
[45:30] makes us conscious of what's around us
[45:33] we'll be we'll watch then what we act
[45:35] how we act you'll watch what you say

[45:44] the presence of God because you need it
[45:46] every day and every hour Lord I need you
[45:50] oh Jesus come on I like how job job was
[45:55] conscious of that hedge wasn't he

[46:22] said job you're a mighty man you got all
[46:24] this wealth and all this land and all
[46:26] this wisdom and everybody coming to you
[46:28] but yet he was still making sacrifices
[46:30] to God Amen because up somewhere he knew
[46:33] that he was nothing without God
[46:35] somewhere he knew that God took his
[46:38] hands off Hallelujah somewhere he knew
[46:41] that didn't he oh Jesus and you and I
[46:45] know that tonight God if you take your
[46:47] hands off us oh Jesus it'll make you get

[47:27] was saying the other day I said a lot of
[47:29] times you know we wave the spirit of God
[47:31] off we wave the presence of God off I
[47:33] said one day you wish you had to waved
[47:35] it off one day you'll wish that you
[47:38] hearkened to the voice that you heard

[47:44] you'll wish come on but it's the Hedge I
[47:48] says Lord you know you you getting up I
[47:50] said RIS up early you rise up early to
[47:52] pray because you don't know what's
[47:54] getting ready to take place that day so
[47:57] you praying that God send your angels
[47:59] before me Lord amen Let Your Presence go
[48:02] and cleared away Hallelujah because the
[48:04] devil remember he was was walking to and

[48:10] what he was doing looking for a life to
[48:13] destroy amen hallelujah and he'll
[48:17] destroy those lives if the Hedge ain't
[48:19] there amen but God keeps the HS there
[48:22] hallelujah amen oh Jesus the devil don't
[48:25] care nothing about you

[48:40] the mercy of God hallelujah amen amen is
[48:43] keeping us and watching over us from day
[48:45] to day from hour to hour minute to
[48:48] minute God Is Watching Over You
[48:51] hallelujah oh Jesus you know something
[48:54] was ringing out in my spirit uh that
[48:56] little scripture from The Book of Micah
[48:58] he is saying what hath the Lord required
[49:00] of thee old man he says but to do justly
[49:04] come
[49:05] on to do justly to love Mercy come on we
[49:10] so we so quick brother Gordon got it
[49:14] walk humbly before thy God we so quick
[49:16] to do things but I said Lord he said
[49:18] what is he required of you do justly
[49:20] come on watch how you handle things
[49:23] Hallelujah come on love Mercy I I don't
[49:26] know about you but I love Mercy Mercy
[49:29] rewrote my life
[49:31] Hallelujah when I was on that somebody
[49:34] saying today Ernest we glad you came to
[49:36] the other side Hallelujah Mercy rewrote
[49:40] my life I said if God wouldn't have
[49:42] brought me to the other side I wouldn't
[49:43] be here today amen I know I wouldn't
[49:46] with the mind frame I had I wouldn't
[49:48] have been here amen but Mercy rewrote my
[49:51] life Hallelujah wasn't me finding God
[49:55] but God found me one day he am in my sin
[49:58] just where I was at Hallelujah come on
[50:01] but the Hedge I thank God for the Hedge
[50:04] you know what it is I says that when
[50:07] God's got a got a hedge you know that
[50:09] ought to make your faith rise to another
[50:11] level cuz the only way to he just like
[50:14] even for him to get past that hedge God
[50:16] had to say okay he had to give the devil
[50:18] permission you could do that but what
[50:20] God already knew what job can handle
[50:22] what he could bear amen so you look at
[50:25] your situation a little different
[50:26] hallelujah amen that if God allowed it
[50:29] then he's trying to bring something out
[50:30] of me he's showing me something in this
[50:33] situation and I know that I can overcome
[50:36] why because the Overcomer is in Me God
[50:39] brought me to it he'll bring me through
[50:41] it I believe that amen hallelujah yes
[50:44] Lord oh Jesus come on amen God does
[50:49] those things don't he the Hedge he's got
[50:52] boundaries that he can't cross we don't
[50:54] realize it but this is real now amen we
[50:57] sitting here angels are here Hallelujah
[51:00] Jesus is here how you say that because
[51:02] the Bible says that where two or three
[51:04] are gathered in my name there I am in
[51:06] the midst can you see them
[51:09] tonight Hallelujah he's here come on you
[51:15] know I I says that what it is it it it
[51:17] it's the Hedge Hallelujah I thought
[51:19] about Elicia and and Gaza on the
[51:21] mountain that day come on though the
[51:24] syrians and the Army was all around them
[51:26] it was a hedge there come on they could
[51:28] see it with their natural eyes their
[51:30] enemy but Elicia could see something
[51:33] that nobody else could see that's why he
[51:36] can have confidence in faith in the
[51:39] midst of being
[51:41] surrounded cuz he know that a hedge was
[51:43] there he know that Angels were there
[51:47] amen hallelujah and they can't do
[51:49] nothing but what God allow I believe
[51:52] that and that's in the face of sickness
[51:55] that's in the face of death anything say
[51:57] that might come your way you feel
[51:59] Victorious because you know that God's
[52:01] got it all in control he's got it all in
[52:04] his hands I ain't worried about these
[52:06] things I believe it was Paul said these
[52:09] things don't move me Hallelujah I'm
[52:12] steady I'm founded on a rock oh Jesus Oh
[52:18] Hallelujah Jesus the Hedge come on he
[52:21] put a hedge there you know and that's
[52:23] the thing I like how I was I was looking
[52:25] at that we're saying about bound
[52:28] boundaries come on this one guy at work
[52:30] was was talking with him and and I says
[52:33] a lot of times you know he was saying
[52:35] that his sister he said you know my
[52:37] sister sees
[52:38] angels He says one day when the preacher
[52:41] was preaching she she clear up and down
[52:44] she see angels all around he thought it
[52:46] was a joke but I told him I said I
[52:50] believe it we got scripture on that I
[52:53] said the angel of God is encamped about
[52:54] all that fear him come come on Amen I
[52:57] said but I believe in angels I said you
[53:00] taking it for granted you saying you
[53:02] laughing about it but I said I believe
[53:04] she brought it she might have didn't see
[53:05] it I believe it come on I said the
[53:08] reason why you can't believe cuz you're
[53:10] not a Believer Hallelujah I says but
[53:13] God's got to do something one day in
[53:16] your life you know there a lot of people
[53:18] sitting in church that don't believe
[53:21] amen but God's got to do something in
[53:23] your life one day amen come on Amen that

[53:40] Jesus those type of experiences will
[53:42] stick with you the rest of your life
[53:44] amen come on Amen they will but we were
[53:48] talking about you know things and I was
[53:49] saying you know I was saying you know
[53:52] you don't realize you know that even the
[53:54] Bible says in Ephesians when we were
[53:56] dead and trespass and sin come on God

[54:28] don't trust in your money come on don't
[54:31] trust in nothing you got is not by might
[54:33] nor by power but it's by the spirit of
[54:36] the Living God that's what it is oh
[54:40] Jesus I like that little song everything
[54:43] is moving by the power of God Amen and
[54:46] the devil don't like that Hallelujah
[54:48] walking to and fro waiting on a little
[54:50] crack that he can get in but God's got
[54:52] all the cracks filled up amen oh Jesus I
[54:56] thank God for that you know what it does
[54:59] it takes fear out of your heart come on

[55:06] these eyes and these ears these senses
[55:08] to cause you to fear come on and the
[55:11] Bible says fear got torment don't it

[55:15] devil's got limits he's got boundaries
[55:18] he can't do but so much whatever the
[55:19] Lord allow him to do come on he's a
[55:22] puppet in God's hand I believe that God

[56:06] times we come from behind the Hedge it
[56:09] ain't that God moved it but you come
[56:11] from behind it come on then your blood
[56:14] will be on your own head come on but I
[56:17] thank God tonight don't you thank God

[1:05:40] amen I was talking about
[1:05:42] brother Shifty Williams and I said he
[1:05:46] said what does the Lord require of the
[1:05:48] old
[1:05:49] man to do justice love mercy and to walk
[1:05:54] humbly before God God Amen that's what
[1:05:57] he would always
[1:05:59] say and then I thought about brother
[1:06:01] Ernest say he scared of those like
[1:06:04] demons
[1:06:06] riches I remember me and him was in
[1:06:09] Louisiana and I want to get on the other
[1:06:11] side of the
[1:06:12] street because I I felt some Demon
[1:06:15] Spirits coming and brother Ernest I said
[1:06:18] brother Ernest you see
[1:06:20] that what the name of that gameat Mortal
[1:06:24] Kombat I said man look all those demons
[1:06:27] coming off of that building he said he
[1:06:30] said I used to play
[1:06:32] that I see you there what I said man you
[1:06:36] can't feel all those demons I said man
[1:06:39] those demons is so strong and it was
[1:06:43] just like death you like hell I mean
[1:06:45] those Spirits coming you know what I'm
[1:06:49] saying some of y'all might got them in
[1:06:52] y'all Y let me see who looking at on
[1:06:55] come back how many y'all been
[1:06:58] playing come on up here and get those
[1:07:00] Devils cast out
[1:07:06] you you got Mary Magdalene had Seven
[1:07:09] Devils don't be ashamed she had seven
[1:07:12] she was glad to get them cast out Mortal
[1:07:15] Combat demons I'm calling them out
[1:07:18] they've been
[1:07:19] identified y'all want them out or y'all
[1:07:22] going to let them stay
[1:07:24] in okay
[1:07:26] Mortal
[1:07:29] Combat some of the strongest
[1:07:32] demons I I done cast out a lot of devils
[1:07:36] but I got I want to get on the other
[1:07:39] other side of the
[1:07:41] street and he told me he played the game
[1:07:45] and I said oh man let me
[1:07:49] get I don't even want to walk past the
[1:07:52] building and you a tell me you played
[1:07:54] the game ain't felt
[1:07:58] nothing man God I
[1:08:02] don't I don't see how
[1:08:06] people I remember Caleb when he was when
[1:08:09] he was
[1:08:10] little it's just anything would get him
[1:08:13] and Rachel what you what's wrong with
[1:08:19] you
[1:08:20] because and
[1:08:22] then but he was real sensitive to
[1:08:26] Spirits he was real
[1:08:29] sensitive it's better to be sensitive
[1:08:31] when some Spirits ain't
[1:08:34] right can they not be
[1:08:37] sensitive some people don't know the
[1:08:40] spirit world is
[1:08:41] there and some people are sensed to the
[1:08:44] spirit world some people the spirit
[1:08:45] world just engulf them just take over
[1:08:48] them and you wonder why children act
[1:08:51] like they act is because those demons
[1:08:55] sometimes it's sexual demons and and
[1:08:59] those demons never leave
[1:09:02] you those demons are there you have to
[1:09:05] battle those demons the rest of your
[1:09:07] life because they come back they keep
[1:09:10] coming back and they want to inject
[1:09:13] themselves into your
[1:09:15] life they CA you not only to look at
[1:09:18] things they C you to do
[1:09:20] things that you wouldn't normally do had
[1:09:23] those demons not gotten in you
[1:09:26] they had to get an
[1:09:27] inlet that make you do
[1:09:31] stuff that you never would have thought
[1:09:33] about doing but because you entertain
[1:09:38] those demons those demons were able to
[1:09:41] inject themselves into you just like
[1:09:43] brother Ernest said said put spells on
[1:09:46] you they put spells on
[1:09:51] you turn ball in the to Toy Box you say
[1:09:54] you found it
[1:09:57] okay sometimes I want the parents to go
[1:09:59] back over some of those books we used to
[1:10:01] have they tell you about those demon
[1:10:05] spirits and toys and so
[1:10:09] forth there was a book we used to uh let
[1:10:12] the parents read turmo in the toy box
[1:10:17] there was several books dancing with
[1:10:19] demons that was another
[1:10:22] book and that was talking about the
[1:10:24] music it and how it was injected from um
[1:10:29] sometimes the different singers would go
[1:10:31] to Africa and they con you up spirits
[1:10:35] and they put those spirits and they tell
[1:10:38] you to play certain records backwards
[1:10:40] just
[1:10:41] playing back and you'll hear the them
[1:10:46] demon
[1:10:47] spirits and they'll tell you bed and you
[1:10:50] didn't even know existed you think you
[1:10:52] listen to some innocent and demons they
[1:10:55] worshiping the devil demon
[1:10:58] spirits that was dancing with the
[1:11:01] demons I had all kind of books like that
[1:11:04] you know why you know where those books
[1:11:05] at now anybody know where those books at

[1:11:19] material and Bible book stores you see
[1:11:21] all them about closed down you can't get
